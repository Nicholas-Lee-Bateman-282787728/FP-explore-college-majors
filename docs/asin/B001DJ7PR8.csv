Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[11, 15]","I used to be a huge fan of Woody Allen back in the Annie Hall days but that was a long time ago before he turned into a caricature of himself. I'd heard this was his best for years so I decided to give it a try.It wasn't bad; lovely photography of Barcelona and four very attractive main characters providing ample eye candy. The plot is as simple as it is absurd. Vicky and Cristina come for two months to Barcelona and are propositioned by a handsome painter (Javie Bardem) who wants to sleep with them both. Cristina played by a Scarlett Johansson, is up for it but Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaged to a boring American guy, is not. Nevertheless, after Christina comes down with a stomach complaint, it's Vicky who succumbs.Later, Juan-Antonio's beautiful but disturbed ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) makes an appearance and a love triangle with Cristina develops. In the end, everyone emerges from the complications a little older but no wiser.The problem I found is that every single character in the movie sounds and thinks like Woody Allen. Several of them even affect his nasal, self-satisfied yet anguished whine. This is a man of monumental ego who cannot imagine anyone else in the world but himself.Ultimately, I found this movie mildly amusing but hugely pretentious.

1181283,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001DJ7PR8,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I have been reviewing Woody Allen productions in this space over the past year or so. I have highly rated such old Woody classics as ""Annie Hall, ""Manhattan"" and ""Radio Days"", those memorable films with New York City its trials, tribulations and traumas as an epicenter. I have also given mixed reviews to some of his later productions like ""Manhattan Mystery"" and others based in other geographic locales (""Purple Rose Of Cairo"", etc.). I was, however, fully prepared to fulsomely praise the film under review, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", after having heard the hype about Penelope Cruz's performance as, Maria Elena, the talented estranged artsy wife of the central male character, Juan Antonia (Javier Bardem), a Spanish avant guarde artist. After viewing the film Ms. Cruz's performance was certainly Oscar-worthy. Nevertheless the overall production falls flat. And here is why.Woody Allen has created an important cinematic niche for himself as a performer, director, writer and producer in that netherworld of the alienated modern urbanite, especially of distracted women unsure of their place in the world and their ability to navigate it with (or without) a man. The classic examples of such angst and confusion were various film vehicles created for Diane Keaton (""Annie Hall"") Mia Farrow (""Broadway Danny Rose"", ""Stardust Memories"") and along the way Woody himself, his doubts and his inhibitions (in about six billion of his films starting with ""Take The Money And Run""). Here Woody has gathered the old familiar concerns about sexual inhibitions, the vacuity of upper middle class suburban life, the eternal problems with the opposite sex and various social conventions like bisexuality, adultery, threesomes and the like. All very familiar Woody material, although not always set in Barcelona.With the above-mentioned exception of Ms. Cruz the other characters are Woody's stock and trade of late: young woman with various personal and social problems, with or without Woody as conduit. The truly beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson is wooden here as Cristina. The lesser known actress, Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky's role is the same. In the end I did not care whether the two women (or three, if we include Ms. Cruz) got their issues resolved, or not. That is not a good sign in a Woody Allen film where in earlier, better films , if nothing else, we are at least left wondering about their fates. Woody, come back to your New York hearth and home with all its tangled energies, excitement, enigmas and hangups. There you are ""king of the hill"".

1181285,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B001DJ7PR8,Allan M. Lees,"[1, 1]","Although this movie has garnered more than its share of rave reviews I confess myself somewhat puzzled.  It's a pleasant romp through familiar Woody Allen territory, though thankfully minus Allen himself as the primary protagonist and thankfully not set in Manhattan.  There are essentially three human characters in the movie. The first is The Romantic Artist, here incarnated in cliched form as Juan Antonio and his ex-wife Maria Elena. Then comes American Woman, here incarnated not only as the two young American tourists but also as their elder female hostess.  Finally comes American Man, uniformly drab and materialistic and rather dim, incarnated as the the male host and the guy from New York whom Vicky will end up marrying and additionally, in case the point wasn't made obviously enough, the male half of a couple that makes a brief over-dinner appearance full of chatter about expensive houses and entertainment systems. The fourth character - if we want to stretch the point just a little - is Barcelona, or at least a tourist's notion of the city-as-backdrop.Allen's point seems to be that American women are incapable of really engaging with life.  Vicky holds life at bay through a series of elaborate quasi-intellectual charades in which she always misses the key point. Christina, who seems more willing to throw herself into the stream of life and let it carry her, in fact always extricates herself at the moment when she'd have to commit to really living.  As the movie puts it, ""she didn't know what she wanted, but she knew what she didn't want."" And finally the hostess is living one of those lives of quiet desperation, too afraid to leave a dead marriage and too afraid to begin an affair.  Likewise American Man is the walking dead.  Only the Artist - in this case the Spanish binary star of Maria Elena and Juan Antonio - is willing to risk all (health, sanity, relationships) to swim with the currents of life.This is, however, a fairly humdrum theme around which to try to wrap a movie.  Barcelona, which is one of the world's great cities, makes a vague and fleeting appearance from time to time but the air pollution precludes sweeping panoramas and the camera work is so uninspired that the street shots could have been done almost anywhere.  The dialog is authentically banal and without great camera work there's little to draw us into the movie and carry us along.  The overall issue is that there simply isn't much of interest in the tale of two American female tourists who are so wrapped up in their own neuroses that they utterly fail to be changed by their summer experiences.  We already know that Americans are, in general, repressed and that they cling to sterile and restrictive ""appropriate"" norms in order to navigate the strange world that otherwise might overwhelm them.  We already know that people who work in Manhattan are, for the most part, acquisitive empty shells. And frankly few of us will buy Allen's thesis that The Great Artist holds the keys to anything other than a barn full of pretentious canvases.On the bright side Penelope Cruz does yeoman work as the histrionic Maria Elena and the quite dramatic consumption of cigarettes in the movie must have boosted the share price of at least one tobacco company.This is an inoffensive but essentially empty movie in which little happens and less is achieved. If this is all Allen has to say after so long, perhaps it's time to head for the Old Moviemakers' Rest Home.",3,Four Characters and No Funeral,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,3477,"['movie', 'garnered', 'more', 'share', 'rave', 'reviews', 'confess', 'somewhat', 'puzzled', 'pleasant', 'romp', 'familiar', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'territory', 'thankfully', 'minus', 'Allen', 'primary', 'protagonist', 'thankfully', 'not', 'set', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'essentially', 'three', 'human', 'characters', 'movie', 'first', 'Romantic', 'Artist', 'here', 'incarnated', 'cliched', 'form', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Then', 'American', 'Woman', 'here', 'incarnated', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'young', 'American', 'tourists', 'also', 'elder', 'female', 'hostess', 'Finally', 'American', 'Man', 'uniformly', 'drab', 'materialistic', 'rather', 'dim', 'incarnated', 'male', 'host', 'guy', 'New', 'York', 'whom', 'Vicky', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'additionally', 'case', 'point', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'obviously', 'enough', 'male', 'half', 'couple', 'brief', 'over-dinner', 'appearance', 'full', 'chatter', 'expensive', 'houses', 'entertainment', 'systems', 'fourth', 'character', 'want', 'stretch', 'point', 'just', 'little', 'Barcelona', 'least', 'tourist', 'notion', 'city-as-backdrop.Allen', 'point', 'be', 'American', 'women', 'are', 'incapable', 'really', 'engaging', 'life', 'Vicky', 'life', 'bay', 'series', 'elaborate', 'quasi-intellectual', 'charades', 'always', 'key', 'point', 'Christina', 'who', 'more', 'willing', 'throw', 'stream', 'life', 'let', 'carry', 'fact', 'always', 'moment', 'when', ""'d"", 'have', 'commit', 'really', 'living', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'knew', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'finally', 'hostess', 'living', 'one', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'too', 'afraid', 'leave', 'dead', 'marriage', 'too', 'afraid', 'begin', 'affair', 'Likewise', 'American', 'Man', 'walking', 'dead', 'Only', 'Artist', 'case', 'Spanish', 'binary', 'star', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'willing', 'risk', 'health', 'sanity', 'relationships', 'swim', 'currents', 'life.This', 'however', 'fairly', 'humdrum', 'theme', 'try', 'wrap', 'movie', 'Barcelona', 'one', 'world', 'great', 'cities', 'vague', 'fleeting', 'appearance', 'time', 'time', 'air', 'pollution', 'sweeping', 'panoramas', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'uninspired', 'street', 'shots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'dialog', 'authentically', 'banal', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'little', 'draw', 'movie', 'carry', 'along', 'overall', 'issue', 'simply', ""n't"", 'much', 'interest', 'tale', 'two', 'American', 'female', 'tourists', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'own', 'neuroses', 'utterly', 'fail', 'be', 'changed', 'summer', 'experiences', 'already', 'know', 'Americans', 'are', 'general', 'repressed', 'cling', 'sterile', 'restrictive', 'appropriate', 'norms', 'order', 'navigate', 'strange', 'world', 'otherwise', 'might', 'overwhelm', 'already', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'acquisitive', 'empty', 'shells', 'frankly', 'few', 'will', 'buy', 'Allen', 'thesis', 'Great', 'Artist', 'keys', 'anything', 'other', 'barn', 'full', 'pretentious', 'canvases.On', 'bright', 'side', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'yeoman', 'work', 'histrionic', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'consumption', 'cigarettes', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'boosted', 'share', 'price', 'least', 'one', 'tobacco', 'company.This', 'inoffensive', 'essentially', 'empty', 'movie', 'little', 'happens', 'less', 'achieved', 'Allen', 'say', 'so', 'long', 'perhaps', 'time', 'head', 'Old', 'Moviemakers', 'Rest', 'Home']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

The scenes of her as a painter and taking pictures are painful to watch. I would say there are really only a couple of bright spots in the movie. Javier Bardem does a good and convincing job of acting, and Scarlett Johansson's character seems fairly believable.

1181294,A6F61DLQJEURB,B001DJ7PR8,Andrea Bowhill,"[28, 33]","On first hearing about this new Woody Allen film - Vicky Cristina Barcelona, marked up as a comedy and listed as Woody Allen return to form, I was certain to see this on release date in the UK. But life once again had me side tracked and I've only managed to get around to it now. Even though I've heard good/bad opinions from friends it was still a film I was always going to view for myself; so rented this film to draw my own conclusion.The whole film is interwoven and shaped so that different storylines are voiced together by a narrator who fills us; the viewer; with a bigger picture of what happening at all times. Vicky Cristina Barcelona, three characters are placed in the title, starting with two americans who have different attitudes to life and love. Victoria (Rebecca Hall) plays it straight laced; a no nonsense attitude; questioning everything; her sensible cerebral life is her. Currently working on a Master's degree in Catalan Culture she leaves a well-off fiance behind in New York and travels to Barcelona with Cristina to stay with friends for the summer. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) free spirit; sexually adventurous; committed only to herself; knowing what she doesn't want in life rather than what she does. Cristina's art is photography. The third character Barcelona with amazing architecture, music, cuisine, a beautiful enriched festively soak up the sun atmospheric city.Living in Barcelona; Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) plays the moody, seductive Picasso-ish artist who in turn sets out to seduce both girls alone or even both at the same time, a distraction part time, using what he needs to remain creative. Juan might even be looking for a re-placement of losted love as he clearly has not gotten over Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) the passionate muse and fiery ex-wife who returns when mood suits.Before long Victoria begins to question her own life; could she live on the other side like Cristina; Carefree. While Cristina questions commitment to any life with either one or two people in it. As for the artist and his ex-wife fire and passion holds the bond but realistically a third party is needed for them to remain harmonic. Could happiness be elusive?One thing I did notice from the off: Woody Allen had chosen not to give himself an acting role but British actress Rebecca Hall; (Vicky) who does a great american accent for her part, seemed to be playing Woody's part in this film, the mannerisms are more than recognizable here. Other film trademarks are visible like encounters in the street also Cristina's artistic bent, like Annie Hall's so long ago, should be for photography. Also the fact Vicky and Cristina speak in that distinctive indulgent conversational babble which worked quiet well from both actress.But there is no doubt the Spanish players have it; presence and forthright energy, Javier Bardem as the artist; alpha male; Pen&eacute;lope Cruz clearly stealing the show; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more, she certainly walks off with the film and an Oscar.Summing up: What I loved mostly was the beauty of Barcelona on film, the photography was marvelous. Things I could relate too in this; Victoria taking in the local music played, this is certainly something I'd do; seek out and find wonderful acoustic guitar outside a Caf&eacute; or Bar. It deals quiet nicely with modern day relationships; in tune with our times this film is PG rated; which would not have been the case maybe ten years ago; dealing with sexual topic's on a PG shows life; moving forward. Overall perfectly watchable; evening in; glass of wine. Three and a half stars I'd give this; I wouldn't put this down as a return to form for Allen; comically speaking, but it's more than a likable film to watch; worth seeing.Andrea Bowhill",3,Vicky Cristina Barcelona - Romance Shake up!,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,3812,"['first', 'hearing', 'new', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'marked', 'up', 'comedy', 'listed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'return', 'form', 'was', 'certain', 'see', 'release', 'date', 'UK', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'had', 'side', 'tracked', ""'ve"", 'only', 'managed', 'get', 'now', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good/bad', 'opinions', 'friends', 'was', 'still', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'view', 'so', 'rented', 'film', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion.The', 'whole', 'film', 'interwoven', 'shaped', 'so', 'different', 'storylines', 'are', 'voiced', 'together', 'narrator', 'who', 'viewer', 'bigger', 'picture', 'what', 'happening', 'times', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'placed', 'title', 'starting', 'two', 'americans', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'attitudes', 'life', 'love', 'Victoria', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'straight', 'laced', 'nonsense', 'attitude', 'questioning', 'everything', 'sensible', 'cerebral', 'life', 'Currently', 'working', 'Master', 'degree', 'Catalan', 'Culture', 'well-off', 'fiance', 'New', 'York', 'travels', 'Barcelona', 'Cristina', 'stay', 'friends', 'summer', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'free', 'spirit', 'sexually', 'adventurous', 'committed', 'only', 'knowing', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'life', 'rather', 'what', 'Cristina', 'art', 'photography', 'third', 'character', 'Barcelona', 'amazing', 'architecture', 'music', 'cuisine', 'beautiful', 'enriched', 'festively', 'soak', 'up', 'sun', 'atmospheric', 'city.Living', 'Barcelona', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Gonzalo', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'moody', 'seductive', 'Picasso-ish', 'artist', 'who', 'turn', 'sets', 'out', 'seduce', 'girls', 'alone', 'even', 'same', 'time', 'distraction', 'part', 'time', 'using', 'what', 'remain', 'creative', 'Juan', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'looking', 're-placement', 'losted', 'love', 'clearly', 'not', 'gotten', 'over', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'passionate', 'muse', 'fiery', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'when', 'mood', 'suits.Before', 'long', 'Victoria', 'question', 'own', 'life', 'could', 'live', 'other', 'side', 'Cristina', 'Carefree', 'Cristina', 'questions', 'commitment', 'life', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'artist', 'ex-wife', 'fire', 'passion', 'bond', 'realistically', 'third', 'party', 'needed', 'remain', 'harmonic', 'Could', 'happiness', 'be', 'elusive', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'off', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'had', 'chosen', 'not', 'give', 'acting', 'role', 'British', 'actress', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Vicky', 'who', 'great', 'american', 'accent', 'part', 'seemed', 'be', 'playing', 'Woody', 'part', 'film', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'more', 'recognizable', 'here', 'Other', 'film', 'trademarks', 'are', 'visible', 'encounters', 'street', 'also', 'Cristina', 'artistic', 'bent', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'should', 'be', 'photography', 'Also', 'fact', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'speak', 'distinctive', 'indulgent', 'conversational', 'babble', 'worked', 'quiet', 'well', 'actress.But', 'doubt', 'Spanish', 'players', 'have', 'presence', 'forthright', 'energy', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'artist', 'male', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'clearly', 'stealing', 'show', 'everything', 'mean', 'more', 'count', 'more', 'certainly', 'walks', 'off', 'film', 'Oscar.Summing', 'up', 'What', 'loved', 'mostly', 'was', 'beauty', 'Barcelona', 'film', 'photography', 'was', 'marvelous', 'Things', 'could', 'relate', 'too', 'Victoria', 'taking', 'local', 'music', 'played', 'certainly', 'something', ""'d"", 'do', 'seek', 'out', 'find', 'wonderful', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Bar', 'quiet', 'nicely', 'modern', 'day', 'relationships', 'tune', 'times', 'film', 'PG', 'rated', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'maybe', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'dealing', 'sexual', 'topic', 'PG', 'life', 'moving', 'forward', 'Overall', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'evening', 'glass', 'wine', 'Three', 'half', 'stars', ""'d"", 'give', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'return', 'form', 'Allen', 'comically', 'speaking', 'more', 'likable', 'film', 'watch', 'worth', 'seeing.Andrea', 'Bowhill']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1181295,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B001DJ7PR8,Andrew Desmond,"[4, 4]","""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is a wonderful, eclectic and typically Woody Allen film.  In some respects, it could be seen as a chic flick but it is more.  There is a rambling story told against the beauty of Barcelona.  It is also the story of American innocents abroad.In brief, the film has four attractive stars in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem.  Indeed, there is a m&eacute;nage a quarte and it is how the characters interact that is the core of the film.  Bardem is the modern Lothario, Johansson the footloose lover, Hall the conservative modern woman and Cruz the crazy Latin woman.  There is little in the way of plot.  Instead, the viewer is entranced by the characters themselves.The film is full of amusing situations.  The dialogue is quintessentially Woody Allen.  As such it is a film of words rather than action.  However, the film is set against the backdrop of beautiful Barcelona in summer.  Indeed, as with so many of Woody Allen's films, we almost get an architecture lesson as an added surprise.  Usually, it's New York; this time, Barcelona.It is hard to say which of the four main actors actually stars in the film.  It is very much that each actor has his or her own role to play and they are all equals.  Bardem is so different from his previous film with the Coen brothers, while of the women, Cruz is certainly the most volatile.  Yet Johansson and Hall are also excellent.One cannot leave this film without feeling that they are better for the experience.",5,Innocents Abroad,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,1518,"['Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'wonderful', 'eclectic', 'typically', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'respects', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'chic', 'flick', 'more', 'rambling', 'story', 'told', 'beauty', 'Barcelona', 'also', 'story', 'American', 'innocents', 'abroad.In', 'brief', 'film', 'four', 'attractive', 'stars', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Indeed', 'm', 'eacute', 'quarte', 'how', 'characters', 'interact', 'core', 'film', 'Bardem', 'modern', 'Lothario', 'Johansson', 'footloose', 'lover', 'Hall', 'conservative', 'modern', 'woman', 'Cruz', 'crazy', 'Latin', 'woman', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'entranced', 'characters', 'themselves.The', 'film', 'full', 'amusing', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'quintessentially', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'such', 'film', 'words', 'rather', 'action', 'However', 'film', 'set', 'backdrop', 'beautiful', 'Barcelona', 'summer', 'Indeed', 'so', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'almost', 'get', 'architecture', 'lesson', 'added', 'surprise', 'Usually', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'Barcelona.It', 'hard', 'say', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'actually', 'stars', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'actor', 'own', 'role', 'play', 'are', 'equals', 'Bardem', 'so', 'different', 'previous', 'film', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'women', 'Cruz', 'certainly', 'most', 'volatile', 'Johansson', 'Hall', 'are', 'also', 'excellent.One', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'are', 'better', 'experience']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1181296,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001DJ7PR8,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I'm so excited to be writing a review for Woody's latest film `Vicky Cristina Barcelona'.  This was one of the more rewarding cinematic experiences for me this past year and I just melt every time I think about its splendor.  There are few films that ignite in me a warmth that is of the delightful kind, mostly because I relish more brooding fare, but every once in a while I find myself smitten with a film that has the ability to transport me to a happy place, and this film does that very thing.  Instead of wrecking me emotionally, `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' manages to revitalize me, making me feel refreshed and anew.The film tells the story of two young friends, Vicky and Cristina, who travel to (you guessed it) Barcelona for a summer of freedom before Vicky marries her boyfriend Doug.  Vicky, who is getting her major in Catalan Identity, is intrigued with immersing herself in the culture all around her while Cristina, who is flirtatiously trying to find herself, is ready to immerse herself in just about anything.  When the girls meet the mysteriously charming painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo they have very differing opinions of him.  Vicky is immediately turned off by his rather blunt offer (to take them away for the weekend to eat, drink and make love) while Cristina finds him interesting and intriguing and is ready to jump right in (literally).  What sparks next is a love triangle that becomes a square when Juan's feisty ex-wife Maria Elena walks back into his life.Vicky, who has always felt that all she wanted was a stable life with her very ordinary boyfriend Doug has found that all she thought she wanted has been questioned by her unpredictable affair with Juan, and Cristina, who has never really ever known what she really wanted, has found that all she knows is what she doesn't want when her relationship with Juan and Maria, which seems to be going so well, fails to keep her satisfied.Some have baulked at the films blatant stereotyping and seemingly banal view of relationships, but what those complainers are failing to see is that the whole point of this film is that nothing is what we as typical Americans (or even typical humans) expect it to be.  The film attacks our narrow view of what is normal and bizarre by giving us two very opposite extremes of our perspective of relationships.  There is the cookie-cutter idea that man loves woman, man marries woman, they live happily ever after and then there is the free-love idea of woman loves man who loves woman and another woman and that woman loves the other woman so they all get together and live happily ever after.  There is no balance because the film is attacking the simplistic and exacting view of modern society who at times fails to see that there are many types of relationships and many types of lives.  Cristina, who knows that she doesn't want what Vicky has, is quick to plunge herself into something new, something out of the box, with Juan and Maria.  This is her idea of what she thinks she wants, beings that she only knows what she doesn't want.  She herself doesn't realize that just because she doesn't want the `ordinary' life doesn't mean that she has to want to `extraordinary' life either.When you understand why the stereotypes are there then you can appreciate the film much more.The acting across the board is superb.  A lot of people have attacked Scarlett Johansson as of late for her supposed throwaway acting.  They accuse her of not trying, of playing it safe; but when you exude the type of sensuality needed to play Cristina without having to try, why should she be panned.  She is perfection here, capturing the spirit of Cristina magnificently.  Rebecca Hall is also stunning here as Vicky, the complete opposite of Cristina.  She balances her characters standoffish almost snobbery with her natural curiosity and confused emotional breakdown very well.  Javier Bardem is charming and entertaining and engaging as Juan, but the women around him steal his light.  No one steals the light quite like the breathtaking Penelope Cruz, who just sizzles and pops as Maria Elena.  Her feisty take on the angry ex-wife is stunning.  She may be the biggest stereotype, but like I said, it is that stereotype that propels the films message.I am in awe of this film and it is truly one of Woody Allen's greatest films.  This feels very fresh when you consider that a lot of Allen's films can carry the same vibe.  He attacks his favorite subject, that of relationships, but he does so with a different spin, with a refreshing cast and with a very bright, sunny and enjoyable result.",5,"One of the sunniest, brightest more insightful films in Woody's catalogue...",1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,4603,"[""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'be', 'writing', 'review', 'Woody', 'latest', 'film', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'rewarding', 'cinematic', 'experiences', 'past', 'year', 'just', 'melt', 'time', 'think', 'splendor', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'ignite', 'warmth', 'delightful', 'kind', 'mostly', 'relish', 'more', 'brooding', 'fare', 'once', 'while', 'find', 'smitten', 'film', 'ability', 'transport', 'happy', 'place', 'film', 'very', 'thing', 'Instead', 'wrecking', 'emotionally', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'manages', 'revitalize', 'making', 'feel', 'refreshed', 'anew.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'friends', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'who', 'travel', 'guessed', 'Barcelona', 'summer', 'freedom', 'Vicky', 'boyfriend', 'Doug', 'Vicky', 'who', 'getting', 'major', 'Catalan', 'Identity', 'intrigued', 'immersing', 'culture', 'Cristina', 'who', 'flirtatiously', 'trying', 'find', 'ready', 'immerse', 'just', 'anything', 'When', 'girls', 'meet', 'mysteriously', 'charming', 'painter', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Gonzalo', 'have', 'very', 'differing', 'opinions', 'Vicky', 'immediately', 'turned', 'off', 'rather', 'blunt', 'offer', 'take', 'away', 'weekend', 'eat', 'drink', 'make', 'love', 'Cristina', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'ready', 'jump', 'right', 'literally', 'What', 'next', 'love', 'triangle', 'square', 'when', 'Juan', 'feisty', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'back', 'life.Vicky', 'who', 'always', 'felt', 'wanted', 'was', 'stable', 'life', 'very', 'ordinary', 'boyfriend', 'Doug', 'found', 'thought', 'wanted', 'been', 'questioned', 'unpredictable', 'affair', 'Juan', 'Cristina', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'ever', 'known', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'found', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'when', 'relationship', 'Juan', 'Maria', 'be', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'keep', 'satisfied.Some', 'have', 'baulked', 'films', 'blatant', 'stereotyping', 'seemingly', 'banal', 'view', 'relationships', 'what', 'complainers', 'are', 'failing', 'see', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'nothing', 'what', 'as', 'typical', 'Americans', 'even', 'typical', 'humans', 'expect', 'be', 'film', 'narrow', 'view', 'what', 'normal', 'bizarre', 'giving', 'two', 'very', 'opposite', 'extremes', 'perspective', 'relationships', 'cookie-cutter', 'idea', 'man', 'woman', 'man', 'marries', 'woman', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'then', 'free-love', 'idea', 'woman', 'loves', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'woman', 'woman', 'other', 'woman', 'get', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'balance', 'film', 'attacking', 'simplistic', 'exacting', 'view', 'modern', 'society', 'who', 'times', 'fails', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'types', 'relationships', 'many', 'types', 'lives', 'Cristina', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'what', 'Vicky', 'quick', 'plunge', 'something', 'new', 'something', 'box', 'Juan', 'Maria', 'idea', 'what', 'beings', 'only', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'ordinary', 'life', ""n't"", 'mean', 'want', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'there', 'then', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'much', 'more.The', 'acting', 'board', 'superb', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'attacked', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'late', 'supposed', 'throwaway', 'acting', 'accuse', 'not', 'trying', 'playing', 'safe', 'when', 'exude', 'type', 'sensuality', 'needed', 'play', 'Cristina', 'having', 'try', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'panned', 'perfection', 'here', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'Cristina', 'magnificently', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'also', 'stunning', 'here', 'Vicky', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Cristina', 'characters', 'standoffish', 'almost', 'snobbery', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'confused', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'very', 'well', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'charming', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'Juan', 'women', 'steal', 'light', 'one', 'light', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'pops', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'feisty', 'take', 'angry', 'ex-wife', 'stunning', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'stereotype', 'said', 'stereotype', 'films', 'message.I', 'am', 'awe', 'film', 'truly', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'greatest', 'films', 'feels', 'very', 'fresh', 'when', 'consider', 'lot', 'Allen', 'films', 'can', 'carry', 'same', 'vibe', 'favorite', 'subject', 'relationships', 'so', 'different', 'spin', 'refreshing', 'cast', 'very', 'bright', 'sunny', 'enjoyable', 'result']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1181297,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001DJ7PR8,Andy Orrock,"[10, 12]","Penelope Cruz might have won the Oscar for her brief but explosive performance, but it's Rebecca Hall that dominates this film.  Having seen it, I'm stunned more people aren't talking about her performance.  It is nothing less than brilliant, shaded with complex nuances and emotions right down to the last fade-out scene with the anguished look on her face as she walks away from her what-might-have-been with Javier Bardem's character.  Of course, the excellence of her performance is thrown into greater relief by the near-in comparison with Scarlett Johansson.  Woody Allen is obviously smitten; many of the rest of us...not so much.I'm not a great fan of Allen, but he's in top form here.  I especially loved the way that the initial presence of Bardem hovered off-screen while the female characters whispered excitedly and furtively about him.  You think:  this guy better be something else.  When he's first shown -  wordlessly - my wife gasped.The same with Allen's direction of Cruz's appearance:  45 minutes into a move clocked in at a tidy 1 hour 38 minutes, the divine Ms. P had yet to make an appearance.  I thought to myself ""Wow, she must come into this film like a ball of fire.""  Indeed.  For those of us used to Cruz' knockout performances in her native tongue (see Pedro Almod&oacute;var'sVolverforemost), it's wonderful to see her ability on display in an English language film.By the way, the sleeve blurb on my rented copy described Cruz' character as ""insanely jealous"" about her ex-husband (Bardem).  Viewers will agree: she's not insanely jealous, just flat-out insane.One additional observation:  parts of Christopher Evan Welch's voice-over could serve as a commercial for Spain.  The country itself is like a fifth main character in the film.",4,"Cruz' performance is worthy of award, but it's Rebecca Hall's performance that is the true knockout",1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,1770,"['Penelope', 'Cruz', 'might', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'brief', 'explosive', 'performance', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'film', 'Having', 'seen', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'more', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'performance', 'nothing', 'less', 'brilliant', 'shaded', 'complex', 'nuances', 'emotions', 'right', 'down', 'last', 'fade-out', 'scene', 'anguished', 'look', 'face', 'away', 'what-might-have-been', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'character', 'course', 'excellence', 'performance', 'thrown', 'greater', 'relief', 'near-in', 'comparison', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'many', 'rest', 'not', 'much.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'great', 'fan', 'Allen', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'especially', 'loved', 'way', 'initial', 'presence', 'Bardem', 'hovered', 'off-screen', 'female', 'characters', 'whispered', 'excitedly', 'furtively', 'think', 'guy', 'better', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'When', 'first', 'shown', 'wordlessly', 'wife', 'gasped.The', 'same', 'Allen', 'direction', 'Cruz', 'appearance', '45', 'minutes', 'move', 'clocked', 'tidy', '1', 'hour', '38', 'minutes', 'divine', 'Ms.', 'P', 'had', 'yet', 'make', 'appearance', 'thought', 'myself', 'Wow', 'must', 'come', 'film', 'ball', 'fire', 'Indeed', 'used', 'Cruz', 'knockout', 'performances', 'native', 'tongue', 'see', 'Pedro', 'Almod', 'oacute', ""var'sVolverforemost"", 'wonderful', 'see', 'ability', 'display', 'English', 'language', 'film.By', 'way', 'sleeve', 'blurb', 'rented', 'copy', 'described', 'Cruz', 'character', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'ex-husband', 'Bardem', 'Viewers', 'will', 'agree', 'not', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'just', 'flat-out', 'insane.One', 'additional', 'observation', 'parts', 'Christopher', 'Evan', 'Welch', 'voice-over', 'could', 'serve', 'commercial', 'Spain', 'country', 'fifth', 'main', 'character', 'film']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Unfortunately, I'm not. I found the premise interesting: Two American young women, propositioned by an attractive, charming, Spaniard, actually do fly away with him for the weekend. But even though both end up in bed with him (although not at the same time, as he proposed) the experience - and the surrounding drama, seem to produce no changes in anyone. It's almost like a porno film, where people have sex, but it doesn't matter.Beyond that, there are only questions. Why does Vicky (Rebecca Hall) seem to be such a depressive that even an affair with handsome Spaniard can't jolt her out of her stupor? Why is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) never satisfied with the love she has? These are some of the issues the film raises, but never really explores. The downer ending wouldn't bother me if the film provided some resolution to the conflicts it has set up. But it doesn't, except for Woodyphiles, who seem willing to accept whatever the master offers. Yes, life doesn't always offer a resolution, but art should.

I'm not a Woody Allen fan, but occasionally he crafts a movie that appeals to me. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) is one of those films, along with Match Point (2005). Both films get 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. I think what I really liked about Vicky Cristina Barcelona was the complexity and absurdity of the love triangles between the main characters. From my point of view and experience, Allen does a great job of capturing the craziness that can come with love triangles and relationships in general. Relationships are messy and undefined at times, especially in the early stages. All of the actors in this film have spectacular chemistry with each other and it really comes through in their performances throughout the film.Of course you can't beat the setting in Spain for the film. The golden saturated cinematography is very pleasing to look at. You feel like you're on a European summer vacation while watching the film (as the still images below showcase). I even felt a little sun-burned at the end of the film! What Woody Allen specializes in is movies about people and their interactions with each other. This is definitely an ""adult"" movie in terms of its topic...it probably wouldn't interest anyone under 30. I never would have watched this film 5-10 years ago, but now that I'm in my 30s, I find myself interested in social dynamics, relationships, romance and love.

1181308,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001DJ7PR8,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","It's official: Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) is the luckiest man/actor on the planet! I mean, this guy gets to make out with three of the most gorgeous women acting today. Forget that one of them is his current girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). He also got down with hottie Rebecca Hall (The Prestige) and ultimate hottie Scarlett Johansson (Match Point). Regardless of how I felt about the rest of the film, there was plenty of eye-candy for guys. And those ladies who think Javier isn't too shabby himself, well, there's that, too.But let me explain why I'm talking about how good-looking these folks are on-screen and why I started my review in such an unabashed way. Director Woody Allen is well-known for his love of beautiful people. Everything fromSleepertoMatch Pointhas been sexually charged, to say the least. But his take on relationships is exceptionally skewed toward the hyper-sexual, and that's even more true here. Some might compare this to his private life, but I'll leave that alone ...for now.***CONTAINS SPOILERS***This time we have two women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) on vacation in Barcelona, Spain. The two are good friends and Vicky (Hall) is taking a break in preparation for marriage to Doug (Chris Messina), whom she leaves back in the States. Cristina isn't even close to being ready for marriage, and rips through relationships like a laundry woman through sheets. Then the two ladies meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who approaches them with a unique proposal: fly away with him to his house in the north and have sex with him; both of them. At the same time, perhaps. This doesn't surprise Vicky, who immediately labels him a troll with artistic aspirations. But Cristina is intrigued by his forwardness, and the two ladies go with him to his beautiful Spanish home. But Cristina gets sick after eating some bad food, which leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio together, and opposite sparks fly. Then, after Cristina gets better, Juan Antonio takes her into his bed, too. But then a phone call in the middle of the night leads to Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), coming to stay with them after a suicide attempt. Cristina and Juan become closer. His ex-wife and Cristina become closer. Juan Antonio and his ex-wife reignite their passions ...with Cristina getting involved with both of them, if you know what I mean.Meanwhile, Vicky is struggling to deal with her feelings on the night when she weakened and had sex with Juan Antonio. She begins questioning whether she's ready for marriage. But then Dough, her fianc&eacute;, comes to Spain with the option to get married there before returning to the States and ""doing it up right.""***END SPOILERS***There are quite a few twists and turns in the multiple relationships that wind and unwind themselves. And that is what made most of the story interesting (that and the beautiful people surrounded by the beauty of Barcelona). So you can see why I started my review the way I did. It's mainly about how sexually charged relationships can change (or maybe not change) who we are. Which brings me to my next point: Penelope Cruz's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not gonna take anything away from her. She did a fine job. But she wasn't on-screen very much. Personally, I think Rebecca Hall got gypped during the Oscar's. Her battles for her emotional stability were what kept me watching, not Penelope Cruz. Hall's character was so conflicted that I could empathize with her. While Cruz's character only made me laugh because she seemed almost like a caricature.Still, it's an interesting film to watch.

The ending just seems like he ran out of money and shut the camera off. Plus the way he actually treats relationships is almost cartoonish. the potential in the story is there but he's unable to weave multiple storylines (hey, Woodman, go watch a guy Ritchie caper flick to see how it's done in the 21st century) without seeing them simply left hanging and unresolved.Also, stop treating us adults like we can't figure out the gaps in scenes. the voiceover narration is like some sort of instructions to the blind. It's beyond annoying. First rule of cinema, if you have to use narration, especially a third person one, to explain what is going on you've done a terrible job in filmmaking and are flat-out lazy.There are zero extras on the version of this DVD I watched the flick on.

1181321,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001DJ7PR8,C. B Collins Jr.,"[8, 9]","Woody Allen has produced an excellent film for thinking adults in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I say this because he is able to capture much of the paradox of relationships as two young women in their 20s begin to explore what they want from life and from their relationships.The character of Vicky, played wonderfully by Rebecca Hall, is a young woman who plays it safe most of the time. However a short and unexpected fling with artist Juan Antonio, played by Javier Bardem, opens up emotional doors for her that she can't close with her rational mind. Vicky and her good friend Cristina are staying at the home of Vicki's family friends, where Vicky accidentally sees the wife in the embrace of her Spanish lover. Patricia Clarkson plays the middle aged woman who tries to explain to Vicky why she has taken a lover and then begins to take the role of advisor to Vicky so that Vicky doesn't make the same mistake of marriage for stability rather than passion.Cristina on the other hand moves in with the artist and his mentally unstable wife, Maria Elena, played by Penelope Cruz.  Despite all the freedom, drama and sex, in the end Cristina sadly learns that they are a highly dependent couple, passionate about each other, but so unstable that they can not maintain a solid relationships.In the end we might expect Vicky to learn from her experiences with Juan Antonio and drop her wealthy privileged boyfriend, Doug. Or we might expect Cristina to learn some lessons about dependency and stability from living in a 3-way relationship with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena. But this is a Woody Allen film and behind the wry humor Woody is a wise philosopher. For in the end we can only learn from our own mistakes and unfortunately we often have to make the same mistakes repeatedly before our foolish hearts get a clue.This is excellent film making. The film is warm and sunny and often shot outdoors, exploring the Catalan landscape. The architecture of Gaudi pops up here and there in scenes in Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia.All the actors were in top form with Rebecca Hall emerging to the top with a subtle performance of a naive and insecure young woman playing the role of a determined and stable woman. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as the risk taking young woman who gradually understands that she is the third party to a highly dynamic mutually dependent relationship which really holds no future for her. Javier Bardem is very good as an intelligent, intuitive, man who finds he can't live in peace with his soul mate. Penelope Cruz is superb as a volatile dramatic creative woman who struggles against her own dependency needs. Last of all, Patricia Clarkson is excellent as the older woman who has been there and done that and now wishes that others would not make the same mistakes.",5,You can't always want what you get.,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2796,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'produced', 'excellent', 'film', 'thinking', 'adults', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'say', 'able', 'capture', 'much', 'paradox', 'relationships', 'two', 'young', 'women', '20s', 'begin', 'explore', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'relationships.The', 'character', 'Vicky', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'safe', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'short', 'unexpected', 'fling', 'artist', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'up', 'emotional', 'doors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'close', 'rational', 'mind', 'Vicky', 'good', 'friend', 'Cristina', 'are', 'staying', 'home', 'Vicki', 'family', 'friends', 'where', 'Vicky', 'accidentally', 'wife', 'embrace', 'Spanish', 'lover', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'explain', 'Vicky', 'why', 'taken', 'lover', 'then', 'take', 'role', 'advisor', 'Vicky', 'Vicky', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'marriage', 'stability', 'rather', 'passion.Cristina', 'other', 'hand', 'moves', 'artist', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'freedom', 'drama', 'sex', 'end', 'Cristina', 'sadly', 'are', 'highly', 'dependent', 'couple', 'passionate', 'other', 'so', 'unstable', 'can', 'not', 'maintain', 'solid', 'relationships.In', 'end', 'might', 'expect', 'Vicky', 'learn', 'experiences', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'drop', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'boyfriend', 'Doug', 'might', 'expect', 'Cristina', 'learn', 'lessons', 'dependency', 'stability', 'living', '3-way', 'relationship', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'wry', 'humor', 'Woody', 'wise', 'philosopher', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'learn', 'own', 'mistakes', 'unfortunately', 'often', 'have', 'make', 'same', 'mistakes', 'repeatedly', 'foolish', 'hearts', 'get', 'clue.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'warm', 'sunny', 'often', 'shot', 'outdoors', 'exploring', 'Catalan', 'landscape', 'architecture', 'Gaudi', 'here', 'there', 'scenes', 'Parc', 'Guell', 'Sagrada', 'Familia.All', 'actors', 'were', 'top', 'form', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'emerging', 'top', 'subtle', 'performance', 'naive', 'insecure', 'young', 'woman', 'playing', 'role', 'determined', 'stable', 'woman', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'excellent', 'risk', 'taking', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'gradually', 'third', 'party', 'highly', 'dynamic', 'mutually', 'dependent', 'relationship', 'really', 'future', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'very', 'good', 'intelligent', 'intuitive', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'peace', 'soul', 'mate', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'superb', 'volatile', 'dramatic', 'creative', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'dependency', 'needs', 'Last', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'excellent', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'now', 'others', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistakes']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1181322,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001DJ7PR8,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a Woody Allen film, but in his new mature style. His style has evolved over the years. It is a comedy, but not so broad--it is a sophisticated comedy. In a way, it is almost a panel discussion about why it is so difficult to define love. Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall & Scarlett Johansson) are two young American women who have radically different approaches to love. Cristina knows what she doesn't want, and that is a stable but boring relationship. She wants to gamble with her feelings, putting them at risk, for the sake of grand passion. She has accepted that love might cause her great pain, but to her it was worth it. It is significant that prior to the film's beginning, she has made a 12-minute film about why love is so difficult to define. She felt her film had failed in its objective. Vicky, on the other hand, values stability above all, and has picked her fianc&eacute;, Doug, because ""he was decent and successful and understood the beauty of commitment."" While Vicky and Cristina are in Spain on vacation they meet a dashing painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who tries to seduce them both. Cristina is interested, but Vicky is having none of it. However, against her better judgment, she agrees to accompany Juan Antonio and Cristina on a side trip to a small Spanish town. This little snippet sums up the dynamics of the situation:Cristina: [Looking at a sculpture of Jesus] Are you very religious?Juan Antonio: No, no, no, no, I'm not. The trick is to enjoy life, accepting it has no meaning whatsoever.Cristina: No meaning? You don't think that authentic love gives life meaning?Juan Antonio: Yes, but love is so transient. Isn't it? I was in love with a most incredible woman... and then in the end...Vicky: Yes?Juan Antonio: She put a knife into me.Cristina: My God, that's terrible!Vicky: Well, maybe you did something to deserve it.Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) is the woman from his past. She doesn't even appear for the first half of the film, but when she does arrive, she is a force of nature. Bardem and Cruz made a charming, if troubled couple. Their relationship was nothing if not tempestuous. Cruz earned a supporting actress Oscar for this role. Javier Bardem and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz ended up married two years after this film was made.Woody Allen had Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson in mind when he wrote the script, and he never even considered anyone else for the role Bardem played. The script was originally set in San Francisco, but Woody Allen had a deal to make a film in Spain, so he dug out an old script that could be reset there. It seems such a perfect location that it is surprising it wasn't originally set in Spain. Woody Allen films used to always feature the writer/director in a leading role, but as he got older, it became problematic. At one point he tried using Larry David, one of the creators of Seinfeld who later had the show Curb Your Enthusiasm. This substitution of one curmudgeon for another didn't solve his dilemma. But with someone like Bardem in the leading role, or as in his latest film, Owen Wilson, all of that is changed. Bardem plays well the dashing Spanish artist who can proposition two women. Bardem can get away with propositions that would make you cringe if it was the aging Woody doing the propositioning. No country for old men, indeed. Bardem totally gets away with it. Another point in Bardem's favor is that in spite of his good fortune, his luck with the ladies, there is always a cloud on his horizon. Even while living with both Cristina and Maria Elena, things aren't perfect. He is always brooding. This makes him much more likeable. If he were just a suave womanizer he'd be totally and irredeemably insufferable.The lush Spanish setting is beautiful and the Spanish guitar music evokes a transcendent mood. Why is it so difficult to define love? Woody Allen has really matured as a director and he knows how to tell a story with film. The actors are all excellent, with my personal favorite being Rebecca Hall, who played Vicky. I really enjoyed Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Vicky. It was fun to see her initial hostility to Juan Antonio melt. She was so judgmental, so condescending, so sure of herself, but then... she questions all the fundamental beliefs she has held so firmly up to this point.The Bottom Line is, even if you don't like Woody Allen films, you will probably like this one, and don't worry, Woody stays behind the camera at all times.Cristina: If you don't start undressing me soon this is going to turn into a panel

1181328,A1LMQHB3ZANNVN,B001DJ7PR8,C. Oliver,"[3, 4]","I think has a special ressonance for me, as both a writer, and a traveler.  As a young college student, I wouldn't claim to have watched Woody Allen's entire ouevre, but from the twenty or so that I've seen, some I've liked, some I haven't liked, some I loved, and some I wish I didn't waste my money with, but this movie seems to be unlike anything he's done, while being so similiar to all of his films.  The dramatic display, the performance he gets from the actors, is so spot on, it is no wonder the film won best comedy at the Golden Globes.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is on first viewing, a travel film.  Two young American women who fall for the same spaniard painter Juan Antonio (played by Javier Bardem). Vicky (Played by Rebecca Hall in an amazing performance), is engaged to be married, likes responsibility, and doesn't like something that effects the norm, finds herself alone with the painter when Cristina--who was first drawn to the painter--gets sick, and they share a night together.  She says nothing however and the two women go back to Vicky's Aunt's house, where they are staying.  They don't hear from Juan Antonio for some days, and when they do, he calls for Cristina.  Cristina (wild, artistic bohemian, played by Scarlett Johansen in such an erotic and beautiful performance) is instantly taken and starts a relationship.  Unlike many American/Hollywood movies, Vicky neither shows bitterness nor anger, though some despondency.  What seems like a tamed love story that you begin to wonder where it will go, quickly becomes something completely different.  One night, Maria Elena (Juan Antonio's ex-wife, played by Penelope Cruz, with a fierceness that deserved the Golden Globe Nom) tries to commit suicide, and Juan Antonio picks her up from the hospital and brings her home.  Without revealing too much, the film begins to become male fantasy, and a meditation on art and connection and friendship and self-discovery.On the second viewing, you start to pick up the subtleness of the cogitation on love and romance, the possibilities and restraints of romantic love (unrequited love is the only form of romantic love) as the movie espouses, for neither Juan Antonio nor Maria Elena can stand each other, but then neither can they stay away from each other for long (odds are, and you might get this feeling also) they'll probably one day end up killing each other.On a third viewing the film becomes a meditation on art, on beauty, on how those two things coincide with love.  The tears from the Spanish Guitar, the emotion driven upward from the playing of such gentle music.  Vicky can be seen reading Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides (the book is on her bedside table), and Cristina can be seen reading Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.The voice over, this has been a point of discontent for some on the message boards on IMDB.  This voice over, some say, shows what a hack Woody Allen has become.  But I must disagree.  The Voice over I believe aides in the story, it describes in a flat tone sometime the most erotic of scenes, but this aides in keeping us grounded in the story of the girls, and not in the lust, or sexuality that's portrayed in the film.  It helps develope and move away from American Travel movies, away from the actual events, and allows you to remember to watch the girls, watch their lives, watch the film, and not get drawn away into your own imaginations.  I believe the narrator was used much more effectively than it was in Little Children.  It also helps you understand where you are in the movie, through this foreign country, and gives the feel of a book.This movie may very well be my favorite Woody Allen film, with some excelent performances as only Woody Allen could pull from an actress (what director in the world has gotten fifteen nomination for writing--two wins--sixteen of their actors nomination for acting--five wins--and six for best direction--one win).  It was funny, romantic, intellectually stimulating, and each viewing there's something new.If you like Woody Allent, I do believe you will like this movie, and I do believe you will adore these characters.  For me, still in my twenties, an artist with large aspirations, in a moderately upper middle class family, this film seems to be made exactly for me.  Besides Adaptation and Wonder Boys, I haven't felt like that about a movie, and I go to see one to three movies a week--not to mention rentals and old buys.  So I feel I have a certain credibility to my opinion--but again, it is only my opinion.  I say buy it, if you don't like it, give it to someone who is the exact opposite of you, give it to your Cristina (we all have a friend that's exactly opposite of us and so much the same), and maybe you will be giving them a film that they can love as much I love it.",5,This Movie,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,4802,"['think', 'special', 'ressonance', 'writer', 'traveler', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'would', ""n't"", 'claim', 'have', 'watched', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'entire', 'ouevre', 'twenty', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'loved', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'movie', 'be', 'anything', 'done', 'being', 'so', 'similiar', 'films', 'dramatic', 'display', 'performance', 'actors', 'so', 'spot', 'wonder', 'film', 'won', 'best', 'comedy', 'Golden', 'Globes.Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'first', 'viewing', 'travel', 'film', 'Two', 'young', 'American', 'women', 'who', 'fall', 'same', 'spaniard', 'painter', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Vicky', 'Played', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'amazing', 'performance', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'responsibility', ""n't"", 'like', 'something', 'effects', 'norm', 'alone', 'painter', 'when', 'Cristina', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'drawn', 'painter', 'sick', 'share', 'night', 'together', 'nothing', 'however', 'two', 'women', 'go', 'back', 'Vicky', 'Aunt', 'house', 'where', 'are', 'staying', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'days', 'when', 'do', 'Cristina', 'Cristina', 'wild', 'artistic', 'bohemian', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansen', 'such', 'erotic', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'instantly', 'taken', 'relationship', 'many', 'American/Hollywood', 'movies', 'Vicky', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'despondency', 'What', 'tamed', 'love', 'story', 'begin', 'wonder', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'quickly', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'One', 'night', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'fierceness', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Nom', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'up', 'hospital', 'home', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'become', 'male', 'fantasy', 'meditation', 'art', 'connection', 'friendship', 'self-discovery.On', 'second', 'viewing', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'subtleness', 'cogitation', 'love', 'romance', 'possibilities', 'restraints', 'romantic', 'love', 'unrequited', 'love', 'only', 'form', 'romantic', 'love', 'movie', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'can', 'stand', 'other', 'then', 'can', 'stay', 'away', 'other', 'long', 'odds', 'are', 'might', 'get', 'feeling', 'also', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'day', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'other.On', 'third', 'viewing', 'film', 'meditation', 'art', 'beauty', 'how', 'two', 'things', 'coincide', 'love', 'tears', 'Spanish', 'Guitar', 'emotion', 'driven', 'upward', 'playing', 'such', 'gentle', 'music', 'Vicky', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reading', 'Middlesex', 'Jeffrey', 'Eugenides', 'book', 'bedside', 'table', 'Cristina', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reading', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'Tropic', 'Cancer.The', 'voice', 'over', 'been', 'point', 'discontent', 'message', 'boards', 'IMDB', 'voice', 'say', 'what', 'hack', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'become', 'must', 'disagree', 'Voice', 'believe', 'aides', 'story', 'flat', 'tone', 'sometime', 'most', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'aides', 'keeping', 'grounded', 'story', 'girls', 'not', 'lust', 'sexuality', 'portrayed', 'film', 'develope', 'move', 'away', 'American', 'Travel', 'movies', 'away', 'actual', 'events', 'remember', 'watch', 'girls', 'watch', 'lives', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'drawn', 'away', 'own', 'imaginations', 'believe', 'narrator', 'was', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'was', 'Little', 'Children', 'also', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'movie', 'foreign', 'country', 'feel', 'book.This', 'movie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'favorite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'excelent', 'performances', 'only', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'could', 'pull', 'actress', 'what', 'director', 'world', 'gotten', 'fifteen', 'nomination', 'writing', 'two', 'wins', 'sixteen', 'actors', 'nomination', 'acting', 'five', 'wins', 'six', 'best', 'direction', 'one', 'win', 'was', 'funny', 'romantic', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'viewing', 'something', 'new.If', 'Woody', 'Allent', 'do', 'believe', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'do', 'believe', 'will', 'adore', 'characters', 'still', 'twenties', 'artist', 'large', 'aspirations', 'moderately', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'exactly', 'Adaptation', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'one', 'three', 'movies', 'week', 'not', 'mention', 'rentals', 'old', 'buys', 'feel', 'have', 'certain', 'credibility', 'opinion', 'again', 'only', 'opinion', 'say', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'give', 'someone', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'give', 'Cristina', 'have', 'friend', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'so', 'much', 'same', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'giving', 'film', 'can', 'love', 'much', 'love']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

1181331,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B001DJ7PR8,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 3]","Some critics have praised the use of a voiceover narrator in the film, while others, like James Berardinelli, have condemned it. The truth is that it's neither here nor there. Yes, there are moments when it is needlessly recapitulative, but others where it makes for handy elisions of superfluous moments. The voice of Welch, though, is perhaps too much like a young Woody Allen's, and given that Hall's Vicky is clearly the designated neurotic Woody character, this vocal affinity of Welch's subliminally biases the viewer toward feeling a certain way toward Vicky that otherwise might not exist- i.e.- it makes the screenplay seem more about Vicky because she is seen as the Woody character- pro or con, depending on the viewer's preconceptions of the real life Allen and his neurotic onscreen characterizations. The film's strongest point, however, is its anti-climactic ending, wherein all the characters return to where they were. If only the rest of the film were as spare and poetic, then Vicky Cristina Barcelona would have been a film that could be argued for greatness.As for the actors, the best performance was likely given by Bardem, although he also had the least complicated part- the slimeball user (best described by Vicky as a `charmingly candid wifebeater'). Hall and Messina actually had good chemistry together, which made a viewer wonder why Vicky would give a damn about the slimy Juan, except for the obvious; that Allen was pandering to the Lowest Common Denominator Hollywood ideal of romantic love (being in love) somehow being better than true love (being loved). Scarlett Johansson was again misused by Allen. Her best role was in Allen's light comedy, Scoop, where she proved to be quite an adept comedienne- surpassed in the Allen pantheon of female comic talents only by Diane Keaton. But where this idea arose of her as a sex symbol is mystifying. She's simply a rather average looking young woman, far more suited to the girl next door roles that would have once gone to Donna Reed or Doris Day than the roles she gets, which would have once gone to Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. It's truly mystifying, as Johansson simply lacks the sexual `It' factor. But, worst of all is Penelope Cruz. Putting aside the character's stereotypes, I have seen her in a handful of films and a) she cannot act (despite claims that she is far better in Spanish language films than English ones, for over 50% of her role here is in Spanish), and b) like Johansson, she is almost always cast as a sex bomb, despite the fact that she's just an average looking woman and, in this film, looks scrawny, if not outright anorexic. Despite, at times looking like a younger, prettier Mackenzie Phillips, the best looking female in the film, by far, is Rebecca Hall, the least known of the trio. She also is, easily, the best actress.The film also benefits from some great cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, and by that I do not mean merely that Barcelona was beautiful to look at. There are numerous well framed shots, and shots from interesting angles, such as when Cristina and Maria go around the city photographing sights and people. Aguirresarobe is not a cinematographer I've seen the work of before, but after this film, and given his great surname, his is work I will look for in the future, despite whatever director he works with in the future. It is because of the strengths of the film (the cinematography, Bardem's and Hall's performances, the sometimes great deployment of ellipses and narration) that I can recommend Vicky Cristina Barcelona as, at least, a good way to spend a couple of hours in filmic revery. Don't expect a masterpiece from Allen's Golden Age, and you will do ok. Go in thinking it's another Hollywood Ending, though, and you will end the film smiling. Given the lows of some of Allen's work post-Golden Age, that's as close to a rave as you will find, at least from me.",3,Good,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,3920,"['critics', 'have', 'praised', 'use', 'voiceover', 'narrator', 'film', 'others', 'James', 'Berardinelli', 'have', 'condemned', 'truth', 'here', 'there', 'Yes', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'needlessly', 'recapitulative', 'others', 'where', 'handy', 'elisions', 'superfluous', 'moments', 'voice', 'Welch', 'though', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'young', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'given', 'Hall', 'Vicky', 'clearly', 'designated', 'neurotic', 'Woody', 'character', 'vocal', 'affinity', 'Welch', 'subliminally', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'certain', 'way', 'Vicky', 'otherwise', 'might', 'not', 'exist-', 'i.e.-', 'screenplay', 'seem', 'more', 'Vicky', 'seen', 'Woody', 'character-', 'pro', 'con', 'depending', 'viewer', 'preconceptions', 'real', 'life', 'Allen', 'neurotic', 'onscreen', 'characterizations', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'however', 'anti-climactic', 'ending', 'characters', 'return', 'where', 'were', 'only', 'rest', 'film', 'were', 'spare', 'poetic', 'then', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'greatness.As', 'actors', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'likely', 'given', 'Bardem', 'also', 'had', 'least', 'complicated', 'part-', 'slimeball', 'user', 'best', 'described', 'Vicky', 'charmingly', 'candid', 'wifebeater', 'Hall', 'Messina', 'actually', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'made', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'why', 'Vicky', 'would', 'give', 'damn', 'slimy', 'Juan', 'obvious', 'Allen', 'was', 'pandering', 'Lowest', 'Common', 'Denominator', 'Hollywood', 'ideal', 'romantic', 'love', 'being', 'love', 'somehow', 'being', 'better', 'true', 'love', 'being', 'loved', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'again', 'misused', 'Allen', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'Allen', 'light', 'comedy', 'Scoop', 'where', 'proved', 'be', 'quite', 'adept', 'comedienne-', 'surpassed', 'Allen', 'pantheon', 'female', 'comic', 'talents', 'only', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'where', 'idea', 'arose', 'sex', 'symbol', 'mystifying', 'simply', 'rather', 'average', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'far', 'more', 'suited', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'once', 'gone', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Doris', 'Day', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'once', 'gone', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'truly', 'mystifying', 'Johansson', 'simply', 'sexual', 'factor', 'worst', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Putting', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'seen', 'handful', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'claims', 'far', 'better', 'Spanish', 'language', 'films', 'English', 'ones', '50', '%', 'role', 'here', 'Spanish', 'b', 'Johansson', 'almost', 'always', 'cast', 'sex', 'bomb', 'fact', 'just', 'average', 'looking', 'woman', 'film', 'scrawny', 'not', 'outright', 'anorexic', 'times', 'looking', 'younger', 'prettier', 'Mackenzie', 'Phillips', 'best', 'looking', 'female', 'film', 'far', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'least', 'known', 'trio', 'also', 'easily', 'best', 'actress.The', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'merely', 'Barcelona', 'was', 'beautiful', 'look', 'are', 'numerous', 'well', 'framed', 'shots', 'shots', 'interesting', 'angles', 'such', 'when', 'Cristina', 'Maria', 'go', 'city', 'photographing', 'sights', 'people', 'Aguirresarobe', 'not', 'cinematographer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'work', 'before', 'film', 'given', 'great', 'surname', 'work', 'will', 'look', 'future', 'director', 'future', 'strengths', 'film', 'cinematography', 'Bardem', 'Hall', 'performances', 'sometimes', 'great', 'deployment', 'ellipses', 'narration', 'can', 'recommend', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'least', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'filmic', 'revery', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'Allen', 'Golden', 'Age', 'will', 'do', 'ok.', 'Go', 'thinking', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'though', 'will', 'end', 'film', 'smiling', 'Given', 'lows', 'Allen', 'work', 'post-Golden', 'Age', 'as', 'close', 'rave', 'will', 'find', 'least']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

1181335,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001DJ7PR8,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 4]","About half way through Vicky Cristina Barcelona, my wife and I decided this was just not a good movie. I managed to slog through to the bitter end. The most annoying part of the film is the voice over narration read by Christopher Evan Welch. This was supposed to be some form of creative funny device, that just served to annoy after the first 30 minutes. Technically this is a good film, Woody Allen does know how to direct skillfully. Story-wise and acting, this was just a mess.Two women go to Barcelona. One, Vicky (Rebecca Hall), is an intellectual that does not speak the native language, but is doing a masters' degree in Catalan identity (honestly, at this point I no longer had any respect for this movie). The other, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), is a floosy looking to excite herself with new adventures. The conflict is already set up; over analyze everything, or just go do it (stimulate that huge bundle of nerves in your head or the one between your legs). Does that sound like a particular director's life story? The two girls meet a super hot Latin artist who wants to bed both of them at the same time during a weekend in his private home. Of course we are forced to listen to one of them overanalyze the situation and the other say OK. Turns out Penelope Cruz is Mr. Hot Latin Guy's ex-wife. She shows up later in the movie after the floosy has decided to stay with the hot guy. Oh of course there's another conflict in that Vicky is engaged to Mr. Normal Super Boring Guy. Ah the comedic tension.After watching many Woody Allen films, I'm beginning to believe he makes movies around female stars that he adores, and I think that Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz fill that bill in this movie. Let's get this over with - he made the film for not much more of a reason than to show these two actresses making out at one hour and 14 minutes and one hour 17 minutes into the film (chapter 15, but who's counting). Actually the only real acting in this film is by Penelope Cruz, she explodes beautifully in Spanish. She shows emotion. All the other actors move around like robots repeating their lines. This is Allen's style, he likes to have his actors improvise, show their true colors, become the characters. The sad part of all this, actors are not exactly the most intersting people in the world, they act like other people all the time. So not giving them lines and having them improvise is just painful, they don't have worthwhile personal thoughts. Ms. Cruz is the exception to this rule, by a long measure.The film is pretty. The scenery is beautiful. The actresses are gorgeous. The filming is done very well. The sound well recorded. The music is a bit annoying, but I'm not a big fan of Spanish music. But watching pretty things for 96 minutes is just not my idea of a great film; that works for a good 10 or 15 minutes. The menage a trois or quatre is an old story. There's nothing interesting or new in the way Woody Allen approached this story. Pretty, but not worth sitting through.The DVD has nothing bonus on it. The movie and previews. It is rated PG-13. Pretty accurate rating. Younger viewers probably not a great idea, there's a few covered bedroom scenes. Not much violence to speak of, Penelope Cruz tries to shoot Scarlett and Javier.

1181344,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001DJ7PR8,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[7, 13]","If there is a message to be garnered from the 2008 film, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" its that director, Woody Allen, at 72 seems just as confused about life as he did way back in the 70s when he first pondered life and romance in his classics, ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan."" Instead of focusing on life from his seasoned vantage point by portraying characters that are a little more chronologically concurrent with his personal experience, Allen resorts to having a cast of relative youngsters--in particular Rebecca Hall as Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as Cristina--voice his quintessential New York angst. No longer his own leading man, he remains the same old Allen, posing the same questions from out of the past as he did as the strange befuddled uber-middle-class-head-scratching thinker paralyzed by the constraints of his identity within the sky-scrapered confines of his beloved metropolis.What has Allen learned about human existence? Plenty, I am sure and not in the sense of a vacuous coffee shop conversation complete with plenty of cigarette smoke and accompanying pseudo sophisticated scowls. Yet in this film set in glorious Antoni Gaudi-studded Barcelona under the ersatz innocuous guise of two American tourists doing the Henry James Europe thing before facing their lifestyle crossroads--settling down to either a staid predictable convention or a reckless feckless bohemia--in terms of theory, he seems to be starting out rather than finishing up which leads me to think that he has revolved along the periphery of his own mindset for far too long. Then again, I doubt that this reflects the truth, as he knows it. Perhaps it's just a case of senior citizen heartburn where old ideas badly digested keep resurfacing like some awful garlic-tasting ""agita."" Allen's own art/life is fraught with fear regarding growing older and dying; his experiences have taught him something--yes? Somehow I think he is too afraid even at 72 to explore them.Not that I don't like this ensemble of wonderfully talented actors set against the dreamy Catalan backdrop. The character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall (""the Prestige"") strikes me as the most uninspired. With her almost nave intonations, she sounds and acts like Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow (who both spout Allenesque quips like a Greek chorus), two wonderfully mature actresses portrayed forever bewildered in their prisons of WASP repression by Allen's films. Graduate student, Vicky chooses the safe route as explored by Allen back in the 70s when he started his cinematic quest for self. Secure behind the structure of routine with no surprises, she acquires a husband who makes oodles of money, has already planned his retirement before he has reached the age of 30, researched the best neighborhoods to help him reach middle classed nirvana ASAP and has conditioned himself to believe that his way is the only sensible path to attaining the best that life has to offer. How sad that Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem without his ""No Country for Old Men"" air-gun and Dutch boy bob) of the hooded lids and sensually accented English comes along, releases her from the entrapment of stepping outside her safety net and in one weekend destroys her happily-ever-after delusion.Johansson, on the other hand, slides deliciously into Allen's role of blonde muse of the moment as she has now in this, her third Woody Allen film. As wannabe actress Cristina, she barely acts. Her luscious body lazily moves along with the same insouciance that it did in 'Match Point' and 'Scoop.' Yet in spite of the fact that she is portrayed as being comfortable in her own skin, sexually and in terms of her willingness for adventure, she is similar to other Allen heroines as she hangs a little too tightly to a world fraught with manners and reigned-in emotions. When she speaks, she sounds as if she is intoning about a recipe at a garden party rather than big questions that actually mean something to her in the grand scheme of things. Like her creator, she seems a voyeur rather than a participant, unsure of who she is or what her talent is, she examines herself critically and although impulsive in her desire to live a more exciting alternative life from Vicky, her friend, is similarly perplexed and stuck in her own boundaries of unevolved self-identity.Bardem slithers into this role as the Latin Lothario with the same startling authenticity he applies to Anton Chigurh the loathsome Terminator in ""No Country for Old Men."" As the resigned artist Juan Antonio, he sizzles with enough testosterone to equalize nearly all the estrogen emitted by this almost female cast--that is until Penelope Cruz hits the screen as his slightly overly passionate ex-wife (thank God she packs only a pistol and not Chigurh's trademark air-gun). Cruz's wild restlessness perfectly offsets Johansson's voluptuous indolence; she appears in only half of the movie, but quite literally steals the show in a performance that smacks of effortless perfection.Allen begins his film with a shot of the two girls arriving at the Barcelona airport and ends with them departing for America. The experience of the summer now said and done results in a reaffirmation of the same mindset Allen ponders over and over again in all of his films. Life's pleasures and pains are indeed ephemeral, but one's overall sensibilities remain confused no matter what the exposure or how intimate the contact.Bottom Line? In general, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" entertains once one gets past director Woody Allen's insistence on revisiting themes that he should develop now as seen from his older vantage point. Utilizing a third person male narrative voice-over, this film seems an innocuous fable about a life changing summer in beautiful Barcelona, but actually comments about Allen's own unwillingness or inability to let go of some of his lifelong phobias. Although Allen's queries are timeless, I would like to see him shed some of his thirty-something-year-old angst and write and direct a film that truly reflects him as artist and a man in the 21st century rather than hide beneath the skin of the young and restless. Let's face it, old and restless is okay, too, and beats the alternative of old and dead. Recommended. Performances by Bardem and especially Cruz are well worth the price of admissionDiana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Chronic Disillusion,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,6348,"['message', 'be',

1181347,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001DJ7PR8,Doug Anderson,"[57, 68]","VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is a film about youth, about self-discovery, and about the anything goes freedom and spontaneity that Americans feel (or try to feel) when far from their own homeland and therefore liberated from their own cultures notions about love and life. Abroad one escapes the tyranny of ingrained convention and habits of mind and one gives oneself permission to experience another version of self and life in another land, or such is the promise of travel.The problem with Vicky and Cristina (and perhaps with this film) is that Barcelona does not really liberate either of them from anything. Both seem too self-conscious and/or too self-occupied to step outside themselves and what they know. Both have a comfort level with themselves and each other that is never breeched. And so although Barcelona promises and delivers a certain amount of adventure, it does not really deliver either girl from themselves. During their stay, they are exposed to a passionate Spanish culture and introduced to a fiery tempered Spaniard but ultimately they both make the same kinds of choices that they made back home. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) has always been an impulsive free spirit who starts things, loses interest, and does not finish them. It does not matter what country she is in, she is the same, and so the Spanish trip ultimately changes nothing for her. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) has always been conservative in matters of life and love. Although she is attracted to others that feel things and act on those feelings (like her friend Cristina) Vicky does not altogether trust emotions and is afraid to have them and, therefore, is never certain what she feels or if she feels anything at all. Vicky is very much like a classic Henry James male and she is driven by the same fear that drives James' male characters which is a fear that they are missing out on life. Although engaged before she embarks on her Spanish holiday, and apparently immune from the advances of strangers, she, nonetheless, remains fearful that she is missing out on something. Its really only when her friend enjoys a spontaneous summer with the painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his former lover Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) that she wishes that she too could live so passionately, so recklessly. The fact that she holds everything in is what makes her so alluring to the passion-drunk Juan Antonio. But she is who she is, neither Spain nor Juan Antonio have the power to changer her.And so there is something sad about this trip (and this film). Woody Allen is one of the few directors who gives us genuinely interesting characters and stories and that should be applauded. In this film the two main characters, Vicky and Cristina, are ultimately incapable of being anything but who they are and who they are is Vicky and Cristina. Whether Woody thinks that their inability to live or think outside of their own comfort zone is an affliction that is peculiarly American is not exactly clear, but likely. Marie Elena's view of the Americans is that they are too self-involved to really live. Of course Maria Elena who does allow herself to live also opens herself up to suffering. I'm guessing that with Vicky Cristina Barcelona Woody is perhaps analyzing the American psyche (which is what he does best) and that what he finds is a psyche that is firmly rooted in and addicted to self and that resists any kind of self-surrender. This seems to be the sober reflection of an artist who has seen and contemplated America and Americans for many years.Despite the location this is a very sober film and, despite a few well-placed laughs, also a very somber one.",4,The Americans,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,3654,"['VICKY', 'CRISTINA', 'BARCELONA', 'film', 'youth', 'self-discovery', 'anything', 'freedom', 'spontaneity', 'Americans', 'feel', 'try', 'feel', 'when', 'far', 'own', 'homeland', 'therefore', 'liberated', 'own', 'cultures', 'notions', 'love', 'life', 'Abroad', 'one', 'tyranny', 'ingrained', 'convention', 'habits', 'mind', 'one', 'permission', 'experience', 'version', 'self', 'life', 'land', 'such', 'promise', 'travel.The', 'problem', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'perhaps', 'film', 'Barcelona', 'not', 'really', 'liberate', 'anything', 'seem', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'and/or', 'too', 'self-occupied', 'step', 'outside', 'what', 'know', 'have', 'comfort', 'level', 'other', 'never', 'breeched', 'so', 'Barcelona', 'promises', 'delivers', 'certain', 'amount', 'adventure', 'not', 'really', 'deliver', 'either', 'girl', 'stay', 'are', 'exposed', 'passionate', 'Spanish', 'culture', 'introduced', 'fiery', 'tempered', 'Spaniard', 'ultimately', 'make', 'same', 'kinds', 'choices', 'made', 'back', 'home', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'always', 'been', 'impulsive', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'things', 'interest', 'not', 'finish', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'country', 'same', 'so', 'Spanish', 'trip', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'always', 'been', 'conservative', 'matters', 'life', 'love', 'attracted', 'others', 'feel', 'things', 'act', 'feelings', 'friend', 'Cristina', 'Vicky', 'not', 'altogether', 'trust', 'emotions', 'afraid', 'have', 'therefore', 'never', 'certain', 'what', 'anything', 'Vicky', 'very', 'much', 'classic', 'Henry', 'James', 'male', 'driven', 'same', 'fear', 'James', 'male', 'characters', 'fear', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'life', 'engaged', 'Spanish', 'holiday', 'apparently', 'immune', 'advances', 'strangers', 'nonetheless', 'fearful', 'missing', 'out', 'something', 'really', 'only', 'when', 'friend', 'spontaneous', 'summer', 'painter', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'former', 'lover', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'too', 'could', 'live', 'so', 'passionately', 'so', 'recklessly', 'fact', 'everything', 'what', 'so', 'alluring', 'passion-drunk', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'who', 'neither', 'Spain', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'have', 'power', 'changer', 'her.And', 'something', 'sad', 'trip', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'few', 'directors', 'who', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'characters', 'stories', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'are', 'ultimately', 'incapable', 'being', 'anything', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Whether', 'Woody', 'inability', 'live', 'think', 'own', 'comfort', 'zone', 'affliction', 'peculiarly', 'American', 'not', 'exactly', 'clear', 'likely', 'Marie', 'Elena', 'view', 'Americans', 'are', 'too', 'self-involved', 'really', 'live', 'course', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'who', 'allow', 'live', 'also', 'up', 'suffering', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Woody', 'perhaps', 'analyzing', 'American', 'psyche', 'what', 'best', 'what', 'psyche', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'addicted', 'self', 'kind', 'self-surrender', 'be', 'sober', 'reflection', 'artist', 'who', 'seen', 'contemplated', 'America', 'Americans', 'many', 'location', 'very', 'sober', 'film', 'few', 'well-placed', 'laughs', 'also', 'very', 'somber', 'one']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Vicky is a straight laced academic who is engaged to an equally straight laced man. She wants to spend the majority of her time in libraries and research repositories working on her thesis in Catalana identity. Cristina is basically the antithesis of Vicky in that she is fun loving and free-wheeling. The way that she is introduced makes me appear like a loose woman who is lost in life. Cristina has come to Barcelona to find herself. What both women find is an attractive Spanish artist who woos both women, even though Vicky tries to resist. Though Vicky believes herself in love with the artist, she refuses to continue a relationship with him. Instead, Cristina takes up with him and eventually moves into his villa. The movie really gets interesting when the artist's wife tries to kill herself and must move in with Cristina and the artist in order to protect her. Of course, drama ensues.Though the movie is filled with strong performances, I still found it to be boring and the plot hackneyed.

1181350,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001DJ7PR8,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","From a thematic standpoint, Woody Allen's second 2008 film offers nothing we haven't already seen in his earlier work likeManhattanandHannah and Her Sisters. Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000'sSmall Time Crooks.The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study ""Catalan Identity"" as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen'sA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films likeCrimes and MisdemeanorsandHusbands and Wives. What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm. InMatch Point, Allen exploited her effortless sensuality, while he tried to make her a fumbling Diane Keaton copy inScoop. As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers'No Country for Old Men, Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almod&oacute;var film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes. Regardless, this is a genuine return to form for Allen and well worth seeing for fans.",4,"Allen Finds His Romantic and Artistic Muse in Spain with a Sharp, Eclectic Cast",1261267200,"12 20,

1181353,A2XJBEKIST9OB6,B001DJ7PR8,Eli,"[0, 5]","A friend recommended this film to me because of my academic and personal interests in polyamory (literally ""many loves"") and, particularly, how love is negotiated in film. Many films feature and/or follow a character who authentically loves more than one other person, but I thought ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" would be different (better) since this is actually a focal point or central theme. Sadly, the film barely scratched the surface of the complex issue. Instead, the film was boring, predictable, and... trite. It offered nothing new. While there were a couple of good talking points between characters (on love being transient, counter-intuitive, and/or hard to define), the conversations never went anywhere and the issues were never explored. I've seen other reviewers say the film is about ""youth"" or ""self-discovery"" but these are individuals in their late twenties to early thirties thinking about and making huge, life-changing decisions (like marriage - or going off with a stranger) and hardly taking any of it seriously. I find the characters largely irresponsible, inconsiderate, and shallow -- if not just dull and predictable.What is supposed to make the plot interesting is the fact that Vicky and Cristina are so unlike each other and even more unlike Maria Elena [Juan Antonio's ex-wife] - and yet all three of them have or develop feelings for Juan Antonio. He's the glue, the one thing all the character's have in common: their interest in him. Unfortunately, efforts to step out of their usual way of doing things or explore new ways of arranging relationships are short-lived. For example, (SPOILER) Juan Antonio, Cristina, and Maria Elena wind up in a triad that seems to work really well, with reciprocated love between all three of them, but Cristina leaves the triad because it ""doesn't work for her"". Then the dyad between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena falls apart because they no longer have Cristina, the mediator. That was the only somewhat interesting glimpse into non-monogamy the film offered, unless you count the one--almost two--times that Vicky has an affair with Juan Antonio and all the distress that causes her (especially since it becomes clear that she emotionally favors him over her husband). (/SPOILER)These characters were not interesting. The plot was not interesting. The script was not interesting. The acting was not good or inspired. And the narration was extremely annoying. The only real saving points were the beauty of Barcelona AND PENELOPE CRUZ. GOD YES. She looked radiant and her acting *almost* got the film a second star. Almost.",1,Interested in Polyamory?

In the midst of this I found myself becoming increasingly unhappy by the choices made by ALL of the women in this film who found convenient reasons to lie, cheat, and deceive.  First they deceive themselves and then everyone else around them....for what?  Is that the question of this film.... What are we searching for and what are we capable of during the search to find and ACHIEVE it?  Secondarily, do we even understand ourselves well enough to define our happiness when we so easily toss away the things we search for once we have them?If character development is your thing, this could be your film.

1181364,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B001DJ7PR8,F. S. L'hoir,"[4, 5]","In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", Woody Allen explores yet another variation on his central theme of complex sexual relationships, but this time through the lens of the tourist's camera. The tourist is Scarlett Johansson in her role as the restless Cristina, who has no idea what, exactly, she is compulsively seeking through the lens of her digital camera (Metaphorically, she begins to catch a glimpse of it only after she exchanges digital for film.). Both Cristina and her intellectual best friend, Vicky (Rebecca Hall), arrive in Barcelona, where they are quickly captivated by the attentions of an aspiring artist (Javier Bardem), who is encumbered by baggage--the baggage in question being his suicidal/homicidal wife, Maria Elena (played to the hilt by Penelope Cruz).Through the splendid cinematography of Javier Aguirresarobe, Allen makes it evident that the two friends are seduced as much by the spell of Spain in general--with its ""gently weeping"" guitars, midnight tapas and golden wines--and Barcelona in particular--with its magnificent art and architecture, ingredients that render the scenario, which in a more mundane setting would seem improbable, plausible. In other words, the city--the third ingredient of the title--works its magic both on characters and viewers, who are able to suspend their disbelief as one tends to do when actually traveling to the enchanting cities of southern Europe. Allen demonstrates this proposition with Vicky's husband and his friends who discuss nothing but computers and business affairs while her thoughts drift away with the notes of a classical Spanish guitar.Some reviewers have criticized the voice-over, but as far as I'm concerned, this straightforward device lent the film an old-fashioned charm. Others have criticized the intrusion of Woody Allen's narrative voice into the dialogue. And yes, there certainly are lines that one can ""hear"" Woody Allen reciting, but such intrusions made the film all the more enjoyable for me; and I suppose that the enjoyment of this film will depend on whether one likes Woody Allen's humor, or not. To some it may seem like the same old schtick; to others [as in the case of his title ""Vicky Cristina""], Allen's idiosyncratic brand of humor represents the third ingredient without which his film would not seem complete.",5,Barcelona: The Third Ingredient,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,2318,"['Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'yet', 'variation', 'central', 'theme', 'complex', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'time', 'lens', 'tourist', 'camera', 'tourist', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'role', 'restless', 'Cristina', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'exactly', 'compulsively', 'seeking', 'lens', 'digital', 'camera', 'Metaphorically', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'only', 'exchanges', 'digital', 'film.', 'Cristina', 'intellectual', 'best', 'friend', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'arrive', 'Barcelona', 'where', 'are', 'quickly', 'captivated', 'attentions', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'encumbered', 'baggage', 'baggage', 'question', 'being', 'suicidal/homicidal', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'played', 'hilt', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'splendid', 'cinematography', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'Allen', 'evident', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'seduced', 'much', 'spell', 'Spain', 'general', 'gently', 'weeping', 'guitars', 'midnight', 'tapas', 'golden', 'wines', 'Barcelona', 'particular', 'magnificent', 'art', 'architecture', 'ingredients', 'render', 'scenario', 'more', 'mundane', 'setting', 'would', 'seem', 'improbable', 'plausible', 'other', 'words', 'city', 'third', 'ingredient', 'title', 'magic', 'characters', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'one', 'do', 'when', 'actually', 'traveling', 'enchanting', 'cities', 'southern', 'Europe', 'Allen', 'proposition', 'Vicky', 'husband', 'friends', 'who', 'discuss', 'nothing', 'computers', 'business', 'affairs', 'thoughts', 'drift', 'away', 'notes', 'classical', 'Spanish', 'guitar.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'voice-over', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'straightforward', 'device', 'lent', 'film', 'old-fashioned', 'charm', 'Others', 'have', 'criticized', 'intrusion', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'narrative', 'voice', 'dialogue', 'yes', 'certainly', 'are', 'lines', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'reciting', 'such', 'intrusions', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'suppose', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'humor', 'not', 'may', 'seem', 'same', 'old', 'schtick', 'others', '[', 'case', 'title', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', ']', 'Allen', 'idiosyncratic', 'brand', 'humor', 'third', 'ingredient', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'complete']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Honestly, though, I can't say that I would have chosen to spend almost two hours ""in the company"" of that pair of vacuities!

I'd believe the portrayal of Christina if only she had 'cutter' scars on her arms.The tour guide isn't Javier Bardem, if that's what you're thinking. It's that mealy-mouthed narrator!

Oh, you think it was a stylish touch of cinema, do you? &iexcl;Que noci&oacute;n tan ingenua!As for Bardem, well... Woody Allen's projections and wishful self-images have gotten tedious long since, but perhaps this time he's over-reached.I've lived in Spain, by the way, in the university city of Salamanca. I found nothing very evocative or realistic about the sketches of Spain in this film, from the few scenes involving Spaniards other than as passing pedestrians, to the living spaces of the characters, to the travelogue photography of Barcelona and Oviedo.This is the sort of film that I like less and less the more I think of it.

1181369,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001DJ7PR8,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others.  As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements.  In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film.  Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina)  while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent.  The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a m&eacute;nage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene.  Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain.Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket.  Watching them both is reason enough to see this film.  As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere.  The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast.

Here he displays his Continental sex god charm to full effect as a bohemian painter who romances not one, but three separate women over the course of a summer in Barcelona. Mr. Bardem espressed wonderment in a magazine interview that he got paid to make love to three gorgeous women in the same movie. Why not, say I? This Spaniard is sexy as all get out. Woody Allen's muse du jour, Scarlett Johansson can't even compete on the sexy scale with Bardem, though she tries a lot harder. As if we needed further evidence that Woody Allen is a lecherous old man, here it is! Though it is contrived and self-conscious in the manner of all Allen films (was a Narrator really necessary?

1181376,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B001DJ7PR8,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[1, 1]","The first serious filmmaker who paid full attention around the complex feminine world was Ingmar Bergman (""The silence"" and ""Persona""), but when Robert Bresson threw his hat to arena with Mouchette (1967), we should wait for Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Lina Wertmuller, Liliana Cavani The Von Trotta sisters, Percy Aldon  and Rainer Fassbinder during the seventies and eighties the feminine affections resided in Europe as the main gravity creative center. But since the middle eighties, (since Fassbinder's death) the old continent seemed to have given up as main creative exponent (until the successful arrival of ""The scent of green papaya"" and ""Amelie"") and since then only a fist of selected films have dealt with the emotional feminine universe. As a matter of fact, after the extraordinary Robert Van Ackeren's  ""The woman in flames""(1984), the American cinema has turned its attention around the countless narrative possibilities of this genre. We could cite Norman Jewison's ""Moonstruck"" (1987),  Donald Petrie's ""Mystic pizza"", (1988), Herbert Ross' ""Steel magnolias"" (1989),  Rob Reiner's ""Misery"" (1990)"", Ridley Scott's ""Thelma and Louise"" (1991) and "" Paul Verhoven ""Basic instinct"" (1992).  But besides, it would be convenient to remark : in South America there were two names of egregious significance:  the unforgettable Maria Luisa Bamberg's  ""Camila"", who passed away in 1992 and the Venezuelan Fina Torres (Oriana our maxim awarded film in Cannes). Both of them explored the feminine nostalgia from different perspectives.Allen has bet again for this distant and European gaze project. The first release was ""Match Point"". A worthy and honest proposal, that intends to give birth a new and warm breadth to a variegated crowd of commonplaces in his beloved and admired NYC.""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is far to be an original proposal. After having explored the conflictive and tempestuous relation in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" with Mira Sorvino (who coincidentally won the Academy Award as best Supporting Actress) Woody Allen seems to have been inspired by two almost forgotten Truffaut's films ""Two English girls"" (1972) and Ken Russell's ""Women in love"" (1970) and a more recent Romantic comedy starred by Diane Lane, ""Under the Tuscan sun (2003).""So he retells a contemporary amorous quartet. An underground painter (Javier Bardem) (signed by a dark affair with her conflictive couple; Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz)) establishes direct contact with two North American girls the alluring Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) a girl who really knows what she doesn't want, a liberal and free thinker, avid to experience in own flesh the Spanish passion far beyond the architecture and the guitar, a modern Aphrodite and her friend Vicky, the mother Goddess who is committed with her North American fianc&eacute;e.This painter is not only a self biographical depiction of his director ; besides epitomizes the ancestral seduction codes and arouses in both of them the mysterious ""taste of the forbidden"". In last instance, Allen once more, carves in relief the impossibility for reaching the happiness through the love, due every one of us - and specially the complex feminine universe - expects of this feeling. The arresting landscapes work out and invite as silent background in which the relation of power and self destructive possession, the fascination for the exotic and the breakthrough of the quotidian find in Maria Elena, Cristina and Vicky an interesting but unexpected cocktail of unthinkable passions and a web of questions without answers.The last shot of the film is hardly eloquent.

Alvi,"[4, 5]","The reviews of this movie are all over the place, which tells me that a lot of people just don't get Woody Allen's distinctive approach to making movies.  Yes, of course the plot and characters are exaggerated, to the point where the plot seems implausible and the characters seem like caracitures.  They're meant to be that way.  In a Woody Allen movie, the plot and characters are intended only as vehicles to bring particular themes into sharp relief.In this movie, the theme is indeed quite clear.  If you were wealthy enough to have financial freedom, how would you live your life?  Most of us can't relate to that situation, but we aspire to it, so it's worth exploring as a thought experiment.  Would you go for passion and adventure, throwing yourself into unfamiliar situations, thereby risking physical and emotional harm for the hope of a life filled with uniquely rich experiences and self-expression?  Or would you instead go for an (upper-class) mainstream life of material consumption, social networking, stability, and security, all at the expense of predictable and monotonous conformity?This movie explores these two options, revealing the pros and cons of each, and showing that neither option is ideal, with tradeoffs involved either way.  For some people, the choice is clear, so at least they don't have to worry about making the wrong choice.  For other people, the choice isn't clear at all, so they at least have a genuine choice, but either choice will come with a painful awareness of what was given up.  Not surprisingly, what the movie fails to point out is that both of these options are relatively hedonistic, whereas there's also the option of living according to a purpose which transcends the self.  In fact, the inadequacy of the two presented options could be considered evidence that a self-transcendent option may make more sense.Despite this major limitation, I still think the movie explores its theme in a worthy and stimulating way, and the acting and scenery are also very good, so I recommend it and I'm happy to give it 4 stars.",4,"Very good, but missing something important",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,2073,"['reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'place', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'distinctive', 'approach', 'making', 'movies', 'Yes', 'course', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'point', 'where', 'plot', 'implausible', 'characters', 'seem', 'caracitures', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'intended', 'only', 'vehicles', 'bring', 'particular', 'themes', 'sharp', 'relief.In', 'movie', 'theme', 'indeed', 'quite', 'clear', 'were', 'wealthy', 'enough', 'have', 'financial', 'freedom', 'how', 'would', 'live', 'life', 'Most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'situation', 'aspire', 'worth', 'exploring', 'thought', 'experiment', 'Would', 'go', 'passion', 'adventure', 'throwing', 'unfamiliar', 'situations', 'thereby', 'risking', 'physical', 'emotional', 'harm', 'hope', 'life', 'filled', 'uniquely', 'rich', 'experiences', 'self-expression', 'would', 'instead', 'go', 'upper-class', 'life', 'material', 'consumption', 'social', 'networking', 'stability', 'security', 'expense', 'predictable', 'monotonous', 'conformity', 'movie', 'two', 'options', 'revealing', 'pros', 'cons', 'showing', 'option', 'ideal', 'tradeoffs', 'involved', 'way', 'people', 'choice', 'clear', 'so', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'making', 'wrong', 'choice', 'other', 'people', 'choice', ""n't"", 'clear', 'least', 'have', 'genuine', 'choice', 'choice', 'will', 'come', 'painful', 'awareness', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'what', 'movie', 'point', 'out', 'options', 'are', 'relatively', 'hedonistic', 'also', 'option', 'living', 'according', 'purpose', 'self', 'fact', 'inadequacy', 'two', 'presented', 'options', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'evidence', 'self-transcendent', 'option', 'may', 'make', 'more', 'sense.Despite', 'major', 'limitation', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'theme', 'worthy', 'stimulating', 'way', 'acting', 'scenery', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'happy', 'give', '4', 'stars']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

1181393,A140XH16IKR4B0,B001DJ7PR8,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen movies are nearly always can't-miss affairs. His humor can be broad or dry, but it's always a treat to watch the endless combinations of the common neuroses and foibles of his New York characters. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona ,"" he launches three personalities into his comic maelstrom. There's conventional and soon-be-married Vicky (Rebecca Hall), nutty/slutty Cristina (Scarlett Johansson ) and volcanically sexy Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky and Christina are in Barcelona for a vacation before Vicky's wedding to a rich but dull stocks analyst. A chance encounter at an art show and a restaurant brings them into the orbit of Juan Antonio, who quickly and nonchalantly offers to make love to both of them. Vicky and Christina find the offer simultaneously repellent and intriguing, setting the plot into motion.I'm not sure what caused this movie to fail. The voice-over narration, used lamely to lend comic irony to the characters' inner feelings, did not help. That a film needs narration to explain itself is always a bad sign. Perhaps Allen asked too much of Bardem and Hall, who seemed incapable of portraying the complexity of character that makes Allen's characters so memorable. An hour into this comedy, my wife and I both wondered what we were missing. Penelope Cruz provided a ray of light, playing Maria Elena, Bardem's sexy and unstable ex-wife. Oscar notwithstanding, her performance was so-so, though in comparison with the dullness of her co-stars, it was positively brilliant.""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" was a real disappointment.

1181395,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B001DJ7PR8,Jiang Xueqin,"[1, 1]","Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a Woody Allen movie that offers three of the most luminous presences in film today: Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson. Because this is a Woody Allen film the characters are cheesy, and the plot very flimsy. The plot centers around two American best friends who are polar opposites of each other: Cautious and prudent Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who is about to marry a successful and stable man who loves her very much, and wild and voluptuous Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) who is on a journey to discover and enjoy life. In Spain for the summer they run into a Spanish artist who just came out of a literally bloody divorce, and who promised the two fun, sex, and self-discovery. After a weekend with the artist Vicky has made love with him, and now questions the very foundation of her life, and Cristina decides the artist is very fun and sexy and so moves in with him. Then the artist's ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up, and after some initial tension the three fall in love with each other. Maria Elena tells Vicky that before the couple was always fighting, and even though they were madly in love with each other they just couldn't be with each other -- something was missing, and that person was Vicky. Vicky completed them, and as the summer comes to an end Vicky sits by the sparkling Spanish coast, and thinks to herself, ""Well, that's all very good -- but what's in it for me?"" So she leaves, and after some more misadventures everybody and everything ends up the way they and things were in the beginning.This is an enjoyable movie, and it's enjoyable because Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson are truly great screen presences. Javier Bardem has had a long and storied career, and one of our greatest living actors. He was scary and eery in ""No Country for Old Men,"" and now he's charming and nice.Penelope Cruz made some interesting movies in her native Spain before Hollywood stole and abused her. She was very good in ""Ham! Ham!"" (where she starred alongside Javier Bardem) and very bad in everything that she's made for Hollywood. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" she is very much the star. She's startling beautiful, and when she's posing for Vicky's camera she's incredibly sultry and sexy. And when she's crazy she's even sexier.If there's a role that Hollywood leading ladies can play extremely well it's that of the psychopath. Angelina Jolie was absolutely mesmerizing in ""Girl, Interrupted"" -- and acting the part of a teenage psychopath you had to think she wasn't acting at all. Ditto for Salma Hayek. She's a terrible actress, and the one good solid credible performance she delivers is in ""Lonely Hearts"" where she plays a deranged psychopath who kills as passionately as she loves. In Woody Allen's movie Penelope Cruz playing the part of the neurotic and moody, violent and deranged artist comes across so eloquently and naturally we have think she must be like this in real life as well. Whatever the reason Penelope Cruz is just so fun and pleasant to be with in this movie.And then there's Scarlett Johannson. Of late she has become Woody Allen's muse and leading lady, having starred in his previous two films (""Scoop"" and ""Match Point""). Seeing her alongside Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz we see her limitations as an actress -- she just doesn't have the presence and charisma of these two brilliant Spanish actors. But she does have Woody Allen who gives her more screen time than anyone else -- even though in this film she is by far the least talented of all the actors.Once upon a time Woody Allen made fresh and energetic and clever movies. Then he turned his film-making into psychotherapy for himself, and from then on we had to endure Woody Allen's neurotic navel-gazing and mental masturbation. And now Woody Allen's filmmaking is motivated by something else entirely.For the first thirty minutes of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" I really couldn't figure what it was. Woody Allen was never a good writer -- his jokes were too forced and too artificial. In this movie all the dialogue is wooden and stiff, and decidedly unfunny -- and we only tolerate the bad dialogue because of Woody Allen's overuse of narration which does keep the film moving at a fairly fast clip and because the bad dialogue is delivered by some of the most accomplished actors we have today. And even though the actors are very good about one-third in I started to get itchy because the movie, quite frankly, just didn't have a story.Allen's also a very limited film-maker. Many of the transitions in the movie were clumsy and amateurish. Most of the time the cinematography comes across as succinct and economical but there are some moments when the movie looks clumsy and haphazard.So if Woody Allen's got nothing to say and he's not particularly adept at the technique of film-making why is he still making movies? I was struggling with this question before I finally awoke to the answer staring right in front of me: Scarlett Johannson.Woody Allen has fallen in love with Scarlett Johannson -- just like the way the artist couple played by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz fell in love with her. Scarlett's sexy, she's young, she's unmolded and extremely impressionable, she's self-absorbed, and at the end of the day she's going to use you and then dump you and then completely forget about you. When Vicky (Scarlett Johannson) tells the artist couple that she needs to leave and discover more of herself Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) becomes angry and says she knew that Vicky would just use them and then when it was no longer fun for her she would just leave. Woody Allen is by far the most narcisstic filmmaker we have today so we have to believe that Woody's subconsciously saying to Scarlett: ""I love you, I worship you, I've made you into a star and given you more screen time than what aesthetics and audiences would permit but you don't really care about me right? And you could leave me at anytime, right?"" And how does Scarlett respond to Woody Allen's surrogates in the film? ""It's not about you, it's about me.""So arguably ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is about Woody Allen's romantic frustrations with his leading lady. Woody Allen's psychotherapy sessions masquerading as films worked commercially because they articulated the phobias and anxieties of his loyal audience. And we're willing to tolerate Woody Allen's new obsession with Scarlett Johannson because let's face it -- we're also obsessed with her. There are many actresses more talented and more beautiful than her -- but she's easily one of the sexiest. And on the big screen she's like a magnet, drawing us in, unable to take our eyes off her.

It's beautifully shot, nicely written and directed. There are some good performances. But it's also  Woody Allen at his most cynical. As he did nearly three decades ago with ""Interiors,"" Allen gives us a world in which happiness is impossible and love is a cruel little joke played on the upper crust. Every character here, you see, is some combination of beautiful, wealthy, educated, artistically gifted and entitled. The fact that they have lifestyles and assets we only dream about does make them a bit annoying when they wallow in their discontent. Honestly, it's just hard to work up much sympathy for someone who looks like Scarlett Johansson and gets to spend her summers vacationing in Barcelona when the sum of her problems seems to be, well, she doesn't quite know what she wants in a boyfriend.

The narrator's voice itself is rather nasal and not at all pleasant on the ears.  It seems as if Woody Allen was attempting to emulate the ironic detachment and science-doc parody narrator of the far superiorLittle Children.  He fails.  The voiceover is NEVER used appropriately.  At times, it actually impairs the performance of the actors.  In one scene, for example, it tells us that a character is drunk.  When you hire an Oscar winner like Javier Bardem, it seems safe to assume that he can play drunk convincingly, and that we don't need a narrator to tell us this.  And if for some reason he can't do it, maybe all the empty wine glasses helpfully supplied by the prop department can clue us in.  At other times, the voiceover carries us forward in time, or sets up a scene.  A good writer can accomplish that with a few lines of exposition hidden in the dialogue, and a good director can accomplish it with a montage or some nifty editing.  If I could ask Woody Allen one question about this movie, it would be why he suddenly felt he wasn't equal to that task, and instead needed this wholly intrusive narrator to do his job for him.Narration aside, I enjoyed the film.  It's just a fun, frothy, frisky romp though the Spanish countryside.  The background is even more attractive than the cast.  The premise is a little trite and the characters are paper-thin, but it certainly met my entertainment quotient, and my expectations.  This in spite of the fact that, as is apparently usual with Woody Allen's DVD releases, there are zero extras.Oh, and as for that recent Oscar win?  Penelope Cruz didn't deserve it.

On one evening, the girls are having dinner at a restaurant when, by chance, they encounter Juan Antonio (Bardem), a charismatic, womanizing painter.

Vicky comes to Barcelona happy and secure about her upcoming marriage, but a one-night-stand with Juan Antonio leaves her ambivalent and unsure of her intentions.

To be sure all of the actors turned out great performances, especially Penelope Cruz, and the eye candy of Barcelona and Oviedo, not to mention the sultry, fun music, was exciting. But the actual plot is so thin and the character development so lacking, that once I reached the end I felt like there was nothing to carry away from this film.Vicky and Cristina both face separate problems when it comes to romance. Cristina wants someone to settle with. Vicky wants someone to ignite her passion, which she isn't getting from her nice but dull fiance. Both of them think they might find solutions to their problems with the refreshing, exotic Juan Antonio, but neither of them can because they can't change themselves. The change of scenery can't change their habits in dealing with romance. Maria Elena and Juan Antonio have the passion, but not the stability. And the film is pervaded with the sense that they will never find that quality, and are shackled to a kind of half-love.It seems like Woody Allen is critiquing all forms of romantic relationships as ultimately unsatisfying if not outright doomed to failure, and I found this to be cynical and unfair. Vicky and Cristina seem to go through a series of potentially life-altering experiences, but in the end they are the same as they were before they came to Barcelona, except maybe a little unhappier. It seems like a terrible waste of opportunity. And without question, Maria Elena and Juan Antonio don't develop at all, and you just know that they will continue on as they always have.And I couldn't help but feel that the narration was in place because the feelings and actions of the characters weren't relatable enough without it, and that's not good, especially in a film; either not enough work went into showing, or else there was little to show in the first place. I think it was a little of both in this case.This movie was saved by a seductive sensory experience of Catalonia, but it couldn't quite make up for the lackluster story or the static characters. Any deep revelations it tried to make were muddled and fell flat. The only thing this movie leaves you with is that relationships fail and people are too complicated to work through it. To sum it up with a line from Juan Antonio: ""Love is so transient."" That's just not true, but the characters will apparently never understand that. Even if they do see that they have to reconcile the problems within themselves before they can succeed in love and life, they won't try.

In my view the main point can be summarized as follows: can only unfulfilled love be romantic? Is complete, fulfilling love destined to inevitable demise? Intriguing if somewhat disconcerting. We all look for love, and there is inescapable tension in the process. That is what produces romance. Once we get there, things start to turn routine, normal, and the spark is killed. That was not the plan of course, but what was the plan? What is is that we want from life? Do we need to know? Does it matter? Not really, Allen seems to suggest.

Vicky, engaged to be married, is the practical one and Cristina is a failed artist with a free spirit.Shortly after their arrival, the girls meet Javier Bardem, a sexy artist with a jealous ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who immediately invites them to come away with him for a romantic weekend.Vicky is appalled, but Christina is game, so Vicky goes along to keep her friend out of trouble.It isn't long before the handsome Bardem beds both of the girls, but then the unstable Penelope appears on the scene, which definitely complicates matters.Allen has written some marvelous, restrained and humorous scenes for his film, which examines the volatility of human relationships.  The scene in which Bardem proposes that the girls go away with him is classic.Director Allen has also extracted fine performances from his cast, particularly Cruz who appears late in the film.Also impressive is Rebecca Hall, who might very well become a major star.

Let us count its many oozing blemishes: a flat and not effectively ironic narrator (the technique and voice nauseate), a pervasive neurotic New Yaakness (ie. Allen's tired aura) which infects all the actors, including Bardem, and the now tiresome comparison of bohemian and bourgeois values.  The actors don't have the humor or presence to hold up such a trite plot.  Unintentionally, we Americans, represented here by some truly abyssmal acting, are once again seen as uniformly banal.  The scene in which Johannson kvetches ad nauseum on the plane trip back from Oviedo is truly painful.  The one saving grace is Penelope Cruz.  With a matador's stare she jabs her nymphfetish ""guapa"" rival, played by Johannson, who can mutter just one foreign phrase, in Chinese: ""You think that sounds pretty?""

1181450,A1FG91CM8221X1,B001DJ7PR8,Miles D. Moore,"[96, 106]","In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen begs to contradict another pundit of his age, Mick Jagger. Woody demonstrates in his latest movie that you can't EVER get what you want, and you also can't get what you need. He demonstrates this in the story of how Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two lovely young Americans staying in Barcelona for a few months, react to the romantic overtures of the dashing, primally sexy artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky--a master's candidate in ""Catalan identity,"" although she is not Catalan and barely speaks Catalan or even Spanish--finds that sex with Juan Antonio shakes up her previously solid feelings for her dullish American fiance, Doug (Chris Messina). Cristina--a dilettantish photographer/filmmaker who is defined by the fact that she only knows what she DOESN'T want in a relationship with a man--finds greater satisfaction with Juan Antonio, at least until Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), Juan Antonio's volatile, insanely jealous ex-wife, shows up.Some critics have opined that ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a hackneyed blast at naive Americans left at sea by European sexual sophistication. However, I think it's more a delineation of Woody's basic belief that happiness in love is transitory at best. How can you possibly hold up Juan Antonio and Maria Elena--who are constantly at each other's throats, to the point that Maria Elena brandishes knives and guns--as an example of sexual sophistication? They can't live with each other, they can't live without each other, but she may end up killing him, herself, and a few innocent bystanders. As enacted in a scintillating performance by Cruz, Maria Elena embodies the eternal irrationality of love, a blind craziness that--at least in Woody's view--stamps an irrevocable expiration date on even the tenderest, most ardent love.Not quite a comedy but certainly not a tragedy, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a rueful commentary on the constant dissatisfactions of love and life, made all the more bittersweet by the heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of Barcelona and Catalunya wrapped in golden light by photographer Javier Aguirresarobe. The film offers us multiple pleasures--not least the excellent performances--yet, in the end, it feels slight. There are too many of Woody's familiar tropes for us to take the film at face value, especially the overly familiar characters; personally, I'm tired of the gorgeous, nubile young ""Woody women"" who are drawn vaguely toward a career in the arts yet are completely confused about everything except their need for hot sex. And, yes, Woody, we got the point decades ago that you consider life and the Universe meaningless; why do you always have to have one character in every movie (in this case, Juan Antonio) declare that belief baldly? ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is worth seeing, but it falls short of being one of Woody's masterpieces.",4,You can't EVER get what you want...,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2914,"['Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'begs', 'contradict', 'pundit', 'age', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Woody', 'latest', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'EVER', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'need', 'story', 'how', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'two', 'lovely', 'young', 'Americans', 'staying', 'Barcelona', 'few', 'months', 'react', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'dashing', 'primally', 'sexy', 'artist', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Vicky', 'master', 'candidate', 'Catalan', 'identity', 'not', 'Catalan', 'barely', 'speaks', 'Catalan', 'even', 'Spanish', 'sex', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'up', 'previously', 'solid', 'feelings', 'dullish', 'American', 'fiance', 'Doug', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'Cristina', 'dilettantish', 'photographer/filmmaker', 'who', 'defined', 'fact', 'only', 'what', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'want', 'relationship', 'man', 'greater', 'satisfaction', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'least', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'volatile', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'ex-wife', 'up.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'opined', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'hackneyed', 'blast', 'naive', 'Americans', 'left', 'sea', 'European', 'sexual', 'sophistication', 'However', 'think', 'more', 'delineation', 'Woody', 'basic', 'belief', 'happiness', 'love', 'transitory', 'best', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'hold', 'up', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'other', 'throats', 'point', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'knives', 'guns', 'example', 'sexual', 'sophistication', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'other', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'few', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'enacted', 'scintillating', 'performance', 'Cruz', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'eternal', 'irrationality', 'love', 'blind', 'craziness', 'least', 'Woody', 'view', 'irrevocable', 'expiration', 'date', 'even', 'tenderest', 'most', 'ardent', 'love.Not', 'quite', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'tragedy', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'rueful', 'commentary', 'constant', 'dissatisfactions', 'love', 'life', 'made', 'more', 'bittersweet', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Barcelona', 'Catalunya', 'wrapped', 'golden', 'light', 'photographer', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'film', 'multiple', 'pleasures', 'not', 'excellent', 'performances', 'yet', 'end', 'slight', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'Woody', 'familiar', 'tropes', 'take', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'especially', 'overly', 'familiar', 'characters', 'personally', ""'m"", 'tired', 'gorgeous', 'nubile', 'young', 'Woody', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'drawn', 'vaguely', 'career', 'arts', 'yet', 'are', 'completely', 'confused', 'everything', 'need', 'hot', 'sex', 'yes', 'Woody', 'got', 'point', 'decades', 'consider', 'life', 'Universe', 'meaningless', 'why', 'do', 'always', 'have', 'have', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'case', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'declare', 'belief', 'baldly', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'worth', 'seeing', 'short', 'being', 'one', 'Woody', 'masterpieces']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are twenty-something women, best friends since college, who spend the summer in Barcelona while Vicky works on her master's thesis on Catalan identity. Cristina's flirtatious nature encourages a local painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) to invite the ladies on a spur-of-the-moment romantic tryst in Oviedo. Vicky, the sensible woman with a staid fianc&eacute; back in the States, is taken aback by Juan Antonio's effrontery. Cristina, a woman who thrives on passion and new experiences, is intrigued, setting in motion what will be an uncommon and unforgettable summer in Barcelona.Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance as Juan Antonio's volatile, talented ex-wife Maria Elena. Cruz is always much better in her native Spanish than in English, and here she speaks both. It's nice to see her playing this jealous, slightly scary woman instead of her usual protagonist. Vicky is torn between her plans for a sensible marriage and her capacity for spontaneity and romance. Cristina is unconventional, throws herself into her passions, but her restlessness won't allow her to be happy with anything for long. Neurotic on both counts, but played more for light irony than drama. Javier Bardem doesn't have much to do except be charming and generous with his affections, but he does both with flair.

Simply put, the world isn't smart enough for that brand of movie being made. people don't get that way of communicating, studios don't get why anyone would make a movie for the art and so on. Woody himself isn't that person anymore. he is a man in his 70s, and he can't keep stooping these young women. That being said, it could be nice to see him as an old man, married to a woman his own age, in some sort of adventure, not unlike Manhattan Murder Mysteries again, but, what with the US studios not fronting him the cash, I guess he won't make movies where he ties up parts of Manahattan again?All that being said, Woody Allen is timeless, yet he keeps fresh, and keeps up with current actors and so on. His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them. He is an actors director, trusting that they know their craft. That shows, also in this movie.Should you preffer humour and cringe at drama with people behaving in a... sexually embarrassing way,w ell then this is probably not the movie for you.If you love watching movies where the relationship between human beings, with all their beauty, all their faults, desires, cruelty, egotism and horny behaviour out there for all to see, well, then this is the movie for you.Sure, Woody doesn't have a real grasp of Europe anno 2008, or for that matter, New York, but I love him for it.

1181459,A3UVOJ61A8J48U,B001DJ7PR8,Natasha Brooks,"[1, 1]","Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is a film by writer/director Woody Allen. This film is a romantic comedy that explores that notion of love; and why love is so difficult to define. Unlike many of Woody Allen's films, this film is less of a comedy and more of an romantic exploration documentingthe personal difficulties that can prevent one from loving deeply and ultimately from finding true love. Can lust,override love and sex? Does any of these three elements(sex, love, lust) weigh more than the other?The two main characters, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are two best friends who come to Barcelona for a summer of exploration and self discovery.  Both Vicky and Cristina have two very different views on love. Vicky appeared to be the more stable, predictable, the ""low risk"" type of women who likes to plan her life out. While Cristina, more impulsive and enjoys the challenges and complexity of love and even craves the drama involved in passionate love affairs. The two women met artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and theirdefinition of love was soon challenged and perhaps changed.Vicky, appeared to be the most rational, and was at first reluctant to give into Juan Antonio's Spanish charm. She didn't even appear to want to give him the time of day. However, Vicky became the first of the best friends to become seduced by Juan Antonio's Spanish masculinecharm, more quicker than her best friend Cristina.  And despite her reservations which included her being engaged to be married, Vicky ended up having a secret sexual encounter with Juan Antonio. Vicky, overwhelmedand deeply infatuated with Juan Antonio failed to disclose to Cristina that she had sex with Juan Antonio.Christina also fell deeply in love with Juan Antonio and moved in with him for the summer. Cristina explored her sexuality with Juan Antonio.  Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz),  moved into Juan Antonio's home shortly afterwards. The trio had an ""open sexualrelationship"" and become lovers.  Cristina, realized that she enjoyed the love and the sexual intimacy of both a man and woman. This experience taught her more about herself and especially her own expectations of love.Although, at the end she still had uncertainty about what she truly wanted when it came to love, Cristina, by the end of the summer ended her love affair with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena and once again was in search of what she desired in love.She knew what she didn't want, but just didn't know what she really wanted when it came to love.What makes this film interesting is the reflective male narrator who narrates the characters feelings, actions and desires throughout the movie. I was not bothered by this all of the time, but at times I found his narrative rather dry and distracting.  The cinematography of the film was good. The overall erotic appeal of the movie could have offered more. There were no nudity in the sex scenes.

The tall rangy broad is a sort of pale Keaton character with the same delivery and lines that might've been recycled from Annie Hall. Penelope is an angst ridden loca whose outbursts and violence are right out one of her Aldomavar films. While Scarlet is a angst ridden blond who has cruised through life on her good looks. Javier Bardem plays an artist whose ex-wife is Penelope and in the course of the movie bangs all three of women (nice work if you can get it).  The comedic complications derive from the tall rangy broad being engaged/married to someone else and Scarlet, Penelope and Javier forming a short term m&eacute;nage a tois with titillating girl on girl action.

He is and has been our only truly world class auteur (ok, Scorsese too).  He is quite simply our Ingmar Bergman and as such deserves all the praise he gets and then some.From the low farce and Catskill schtick of Bananas and the Sex comedies through the darkness of Crimes, Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhatten, no one in American cinema has the range of Woody.While I liked Matchpoint I thought it finally a Woody gimmick piece not unlike Purple Rose of Cairo (which I really loved anyway) and Broadway Danny Rose.  But this latest piece Vicky Christina Barcelona was truly an exercise in modern existential loneliness and isolation.  It isn't so much about Henry James' lost Americans abroad as it is about how none of us can find the happiness we seek even when it is there for the taking.  Sartre says, &#34;Each man must undergo his own death&#34; and for all the laughs and romance VCB is finally about the aloneness that is the human condtion and even when we are surrounded by beautiful music and beautiful art we will finally go to the airport in search of the unhappiness we so richly deserve.Hats off Woody and folks rent or buy.....it's a better night than you'll get with the current Hollywood movies about 30 something men playing video games while thinking about the Swim Suit issue.

Allen has some sharp things to say, I think, about our confounding refusal to be happy with what we have, about our futile and often-destructive tendency to be on constant lookout for something or (more to the point) someone who will bring us a lifetime of unbroken joy and fulfillment. It's fun to watch actors as skilled as Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Patricia Clarkson sparring, romancing and searching for happiness while trying to maintain a semblance of personal dignity. And I've added Barcelona to my list of cities to visit. But I eventually found myself wondering if, in the end, this movie didn't just amount to a ridiculous male fantasy: Bardem manages to effortlessly bed some of the world's most beautiful women, sometimes two at a time, while remaining a basically decent, grounded guy. The two main characters here are essentially living a fantasy themselves, despite the tumult in their personal lives. Fresh out of college, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) spend a summer in Spain, dining in fashionable restaurants, visiting museums and hanging out with artists. This lifestyle would cost a fortune. No doubt, some families can afford these indulgences. But are their troubles really worth the attention of such a talented writer and filmmaker? Wouldn't the vast majority of people on this planet gladly trade places with characters simply exempt from the some of the biggest challenges of ordinary life - financial pressure, bad bosses, compromised career dreams? But that, I finally decided, may be Allen's point precisely: These characters have everything - beauty, brains, money, youth, freedom, artistic passion.

A nice travelog with characters and a sexy plot.Allen is obviously highly enamored of Scarlett Johansen and who could blame him---she is gorgeous and lights up every scene she's in, even if you can't call what she does ""acting.""  Penelope Cruz is her match and the scenes with the two of them are probably the most interesting.  Javier Barden is appropriately swarthy, sexy and Spanish and fills the bill for the role, which is pretty one-dimensional. Rebecca Hall who plays Vicky really plays Scarlett Johansen, who is sort of playing Woody Allen.  I found Ms. Hall's performance slightly better than execrable and I have to assume that the only reason she was cast was that she resembles Ms. Johansen a lot....just without the star quality.  All of them do Woody's stumbling word shtick that was cute about thirty years ago but now.....no!The story concerns two young American girls spending their summer in Europe and find romance, or something like it, and then....go home again.  It's a story that has been lived out countless times by countless American college girls.

The title refers to two young American women, Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johanssen), lifelong friends who travel together to Barcelona to spend a summer of discovery.  Vicki, engaged to a straight as an arrow, tightly controlled young corporate executive, is a graduate student researching ""Catalan Identity"". Cristina, more free-wheeling and open to life's opportunities, is in search of adventure and her own identity.They meet an uninhibited, passionate artist (Javier Bardem), who ultimately seduces them both and exposes them to a culture, lifestyle and thinking that has profound impacts on their lives and dreams.  Penelope Cruz as the artist's ex-wife, Maria Elena, is exceptional as an artist driven by wild passionate moods, unable to live with or without her ex-husband.Like most of Woody Allen's films, this is a story about angst, insecurity and relationships.  It is one of his best and the background of Barcelona is magnificent.  Oddly, all the women reminded me of different aspects of Mia Farrow, Woody's ex-wife and muse who starred in so many of his films.  I could almost see or hear her in each female role.One of the things I enjoyed most about this film was the narration.  Allen has used this technique successfully before and it enhanced this film as well. It is as though someone is reading a story to you, yet the Director is providing the necessary visual images.

I dunno. I'm only a mortal, not a god like Woody.Vicky Christina Barcelona is a movie that's every bit as annoying and ""gritting-teeth-to-sit-through"" as it's title.

I forgot! Penelope Cruz is in this movie!!!! Except she plays an unlikeable bitchy character who Bardem was married to in the past. Oh, and a love triangle begins... are you able to follow this at all? Because I'm not.Thank God I rented this. I gave it 1 out of 2 stars mainly for Penelope Cruz's awesome performance (although her character was an unlikeable headcase) and the other star being for the gorgeously hot Scarlett Johansson. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I loved his performance as Anton Chigurh in the spectacular ""No Country For Old Men"", which remains to this day as the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. However, not even he could save this movie. His performance is a very bored and tired one, he goes through the motions and never changes his experession on his face.I am also going to have to tear the narrator to shreds too. The moment the narrator's voice came on, I began laughing. He sounds like a spokesperson for Mac!!!!! What kind of drugs was he taking when he decided to hire the narrator? I am also going to tear down the ""tension building"" argument too. What tension was there? Were sentences like ""They had lunch"" or ""2 Days later, she apologized"" supposed to be tension builders????In short, I have not seen Whatever Works yet, but I currently have no plans to.

His self-effacing cynicism has evolved into a somewhat mean-spirited display of cruel behavior. Each of Woody's films have been an homage to one classic director from cinema's past. ""Match Point"", a tribute to Hitchcock, was cold and bleak, with none of Hitchcock's wit and charm. If ""Vicky C B"" is an homage, I would say it is to Eric Rohmer, always devoted to that enigma that is ""love"". Woody has done a fine job here, and the casting is flawless. Rebecca Hall is especially good, but she's ably supported by Scarlett Johasson and Javier Bardem. The DVD I watched had NO extras. It's all silly, and rife with bad decisions, but it isn't until Penelope Cruz explodes on the scene, as the mysterious first wife, Maria Elena, that the film takes off. Unfortunately, her role wasn't as fully realized as I would've liked, but all of her scenes were enjoyable. I have no problem with her Oscar win. All in all, I thought ""VCB"" was more entertaining than most of Woody's recent films. He's still got it, but may be grasping for ideas. I would like to see him parody Alain Resnais as a comedy; that existential confusion of films like ""Last Year at Marienbad"" ('62) could be quite accessible in the hands of the brilliant Mr. Allen. Anyone remember ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?""? NOTE: I read the script of ""Last Year at Marienbad"", with director's notes, and it made sense.

Schwartz,"[1, 2]","It's nice to see Woody shooting in an exotic setting, but there's little here of Barcelona proper aside from a brief sampling of Gaudi architecture and a scenic street/alleyway.  Several scenes appear to be of the Rambla, but they are tight shots, not long shots, so one does not have the full effect.  That is not to say that the film is not beautiful.  It is simply not an extended, loving portrait of Barcelona.  That is somewhat surprising, since the film is part 'Americans Abroad' in the sun, getting into romantic situations they would otherwise avoid and part Almodovar, with passionate lovers fondling one another one moment and shooting at one another the next.  The 'Americans Abroad' theme dominates.  Its separate scenes are linked by an ongoing voiceover which I found to be intrusive and inauthentic.  The film comes alive when Penelope Cruz enters, but the film lacks the exquisite script, urgency and momentum that one expects from Almodovar.

1181489,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001DJ7PR8,RMurray847,"[4, 5]","It's been a LONG time since Woody Allen gave us a film that was truly meaningful and had something ""deep"" to say about life, love and the human condition.  My favorite is HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS and HUSBANDS & WIVES (with Sydney Pollack's and Judy Davis' greatest performances) are Allen's most recent classics.  Since that time, almost everyone would agree that his work has been pretty mediocre.  In recent years, MATCH POINT saw Allen moving to London and the change in locale seemed to energize him into making his most ""un-Woody"" film in ages and a darn good psychological crime thriller at that.  But SCOOP and CASSANDRA'S DREAM (also London based), offered rapidly diminishing returns.  So Allen has moved to Barcelona, Spain with VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, and once again, the rewards of this new location have jazzed up the Allen formula.  However, the film still fails to reward on a philosophical level.  It is a surface level delight, with a wry irony about the human condition.In brief, the story starts with two rich, bored American girls coming to Barcelona for a summer.  Vicky (Rebecca Hall) is engaged to marry a nice, safe, boring stockbroker type...a man who is mostly interested in picking their perfect home in the perfect NYC bedroom community.  Her friend Cristina (Scarlett Johansen) is more a free spirit.  She scorns the idea of settling down.  Early in their visit, they meet  Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), a somewhat well-known artist.  He's something of a lady's man, and he brazenly invites them to come to his country villa for a few days, where they will see beautiful sights, drink nice wine and make love.  This is after he's known them for 30 seconds.  Vicky basically tells him to bug off, but Cristina accepts, and Vicky finds herself going along, ostensibly so that she can keep an eye on Johanssen.I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that ""romantic"" (or at least sexual) entanglements follow.  They are made far more interesting with the return of Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), Juan Antonio's ex-wife.  To say that she is a ""fiery"" personality is putting it mildly.  She is looney tunes...but also very artistic, sensual and intuitive.  She and her ex have one of those relationships where one is the moth and the other the flame...they constantly burn each other yet instinctively they can't avoid each other.I've tried to reveal little of what actually HAPPENS in the film, because part of the fun is to kind of guess who will fall into bed with whom and when and why.  Suffice it to say that this is all frothy fun.  While the characters endure some pretty gut-wrenching, soul-searching times...for the viewer there is nothing to take terribly seriously.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing...but it's what puts this film just below ""classic Woody"" status.  It's a vigorous and fun film...looser than his movies have been in awhile.  But perhaps it's the Spanish flavor that has made it all seem a bit trivial.  The characters are all impossibly witty (when AREN'T they in an Allen film?) and there is also a narrator (and this device, of course, makes it a little tough to get drawn in deeply).But the good outweighs the bad, for certain.  Allen's script is VERY fast-moving and really pretty darn funny.  His characters are all fairly likeable and there are ample opportunities for all four lead characters to shine.  To me, Rebecca Hall was the eye-opener.  She is pretty much unknown to me, and I don't know how or why Allen cast her...but he had a pretty good eye with this one.  She reminded me of Frances O'Connor (another obscure name, I know...but perhaps a little less so to some).  She's strikingly intelligent and she plays her character with a believable mixture of reserve and vulnerability.  When unexpected deep feelings hit her, she is ""unmoored"" from her image of herself, and it's fun to watch her grow and change.  It's also GREAT fun to see her in the last scene of the movie...the point she arrives at in the end is the closest Allen comes to poignancy in this film.  Javier Bardem is very charismatic.  His character is barely more than a caricature (a hot-blooded Spanish artist with amazing skills in seduction!)...but Bardem makes us believe that Juan Antonio really is this person.  But what Bardem also does is show that while Juan Antonio wants to seem deep and warm and intuitive...he is really quite shallow and ineffective.  Also, if the last time you saw Bardem was as Anton Chigurh in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN...you'll be amazed at  how very, very different this guy is.  Penelope Cruz has been receiving a lot of accolades, and she is certainly a character who truly stirs the pot when she arrives.  To me, the part is the most underwritten of the four, and thus a little less successful.  However, I don't blame Cruz...she really pulls off the almost manic/depressive personality of Maria Elena with great energy.  It is Scarlett Johanssen who comes off the worst here.  I'm not a  huge fan of hers to start with...she can be a remarkably still and self-possessed actress...but I actually find her stillness not so much representing an inner life, but to show dullness.  I'm sure Scarlett is sharp as a tack and probably great fun in real life...but her acting, very effective in roles like GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, leaves her feeling stiff and unconvincing in parts like in VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that call for vivacity and some raw sensuality.  She is a contrast to the other women on the screen...but it's not really a contrast between fire and ice.  It's a contrast between fire and another fire that has been doused with water and is now just a burnt-out ember.If you've never liked Allen's movies before (and I know many people who can't abide him)...I feel there's a chance you might actually enjoy this one.  Except for the VERY Allen-like voice of the narrator, the Spanish setting creates a warmer, more colorful tone than we've seen in awhile.  If you're a fan of Allen, then I believe this is a must-see.",4,ALMOST (but not quite) a return to form for Allen,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,6025,"['been', 'LONG', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'gave',

1181490,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B001DJ7PR8,Robert Morris,"[5, 7]","It was probably after Bullets Over Broadway (1994) that I became weary of Woody Allen's films and avoided those that followed. Then, while reading various reviews of recently released films, I was encouraged to see Vicky Cristina Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed it. Apparently content to write its screenplay and then direct it without appearing in it,  Allen's unique influence continues to be significant but inconspicuous as he allows his characters and plot to develop naturally. Here's the situation. Two young and attractive American women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johannson), arrive in Barcelona to spend much of the summer with Vicky's older friends, Judy and Mark Nash (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn). For reasons best revealed in the film, they become involved with a local artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem),  and develop separate, quite different relationships with him.Several complications gradually and sometimes suddenly occur. For example, Vicky is engaged to Doug (Chris Messina) back in the U.S. who impulsively decides to visit her in Barcelona and marry her immediately in a civil ceremony there, to be followed by a lavish wedding later in the year. He represents everything that the analytical and grounded Vicky repeatedly claims she wants (i.e. wealth, status, stability, security). However, he lacks the passion and sensitivity that she has found irresistible in Juan Antonio. In stunning contrast, Cristina is a free spirit, ""up for anything,"" who also finds the artist irresistible and eagerly moves in with him, to Vicky's predictable dismay. Meanwhile, Judy Nash confides to Vicky that there is no love in her marriage and urges Vicky to follow her heart, not her carefully calculated life plan. Nonetheless, Vicky marries Doug soon after he appears and they remain in Barcelona for awhile.Unexpectedly, Juan Antonio's former wife whom he still loves, Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), appears.  In fact, after her failed suicide attempt, Juan Antonio insists that she move back into the home they once shared and live with him and Cristina until she (Maria Elena) recovers. He loves all three women and they love him. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to reveal more plot details in this review of it.I think this is Allen's most coherent and engaging film since Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). His direction is crisp and sure, the dialogue is appropriate to various situations (e.g. there is an almost total absence of Allenesque quips), and the performances by the lead actors are outstanding. It is impossible for me to take my  eyes off Cruz whenever she is onscreen. Given her pyrotechnical personality, she is capable of literally anything. Clarkson does the best she can with her role as Judy Nash, one that allows her few opportunities to display her talents. (The same is true of her role in The Untouchables as Catherine Ness.) As for Bardem, he transcends the stereotype of a ""Latin Lover."" Heaven knows his Juan Antonio is charming but he is also a caring person who is completely truthful with others. (Note the direct approach he takes in his first encounter with the Vicky and Cristy who can't take their eyes off him in a restaurant  after first seeing him in an art gallery earlier.) He challenges other characters to examine their values and, perhaps, trust their feelings more than they would otherwise be willing to do. Also, credit Javier Aquirresarobe with superb cinematography. When portraying life in Barcelona and (briefly) in Oviedo, he and Allen provide a visual feast of gourmet images.I also appreciate the fact that questions remain as the film ends. Will Vicky experience the same disillusionment that Judy has? Will Cristina finally find what she wants in life, having experimented with and then eliminated so much that she doesn't? Will Juan Antonio and Maria Elena ever be able to accept each other (as is) as they love each other?""Lo que sera....""",5,Back in form but not in the U.S.A.,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,3975,"['was', 'probably', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', '1994', 'became', 'weary', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'avoided', 'followed', 'Then', 'reading', 'various', 'reviews', 'recently', 'released', 'films', 'was', 'encouraged', 'see', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Apparently', 'content', 'write', 'screenplay', 'then', 'direct', 'appearing', 'Allen', 'unique', 'influence', 'be', 'significant', 'inconspicuous', 'characters', 'plot', 'develop', 'naturally', 'Here', 'situation', 'Two', 'young', 'attractive', 'American', 'women', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'arrive', 'Barcelona', 'spend', 'much', 'summer', 'Vicky', 'older', 'friends', 'Judy', 'Mark', 'Nash', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'reasons', 'best', 'revealed', 'film', 'become', 'involved', 'local', 'artist', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'develop', 'separate', 'quite', 'different', 'relationships', 'him.Several', 'complications', 'gradually', 'sometimes', 'suddenly', 'occur', 'example', 'Vicky', 'engaged', 'Doug', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'back', 'U.S.', 'who', 'impulsively', 'visit', 'Barcelona', 'marry', 'immediately', 'civil', 'ceremony', 'there', 'be', 'followed', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'later', 'year', 'everything', 'analytical', 'grounded', 'Vicky', 'repeatedly', 'i.e', 'wealth', 'status', 'stability', 'security', 'However', 'passion', 'sensitivity', 'found', 'irresistible', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'stunning', 'contrast', 'Cristina', 'free', 'spirit', 'anything', 'who', 'also', 'artist', 'irresistible', 'eagerly', 'moves', 'Vicky', 'predictable', 'dismay', 'Meanwhile', 'Judy', 'Nash', 'confides', 'Vicky', 'love', 'marriage', 'Vicky', 'follow', 'heart', 'not', 'carefully', 'calculated', 'life', 'plan', 'Nonetheless', 'Vicky', 'Doug', 'soon', 'remain', 'Barcelona', 'awhile.Unexpectedly', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'former', 'wife', 'whom', 'still', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'fact', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'move', 'back', 'home', 'once', 'shared', 'live', 'Cristina', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'recovers', 'three', 'women', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'disservice', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'details', 'review', 'it.I', 'think', 'Allen', 'most', 'coherent', 'engaging', 'film', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', '1986', 'direction', 'crisp', 'sure', 'dialogue', 'appropriate', 'various', 'situations', 'e.g', 'almost', 'total', 'absence', 'Allenesque', 'quips', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Cruz', 'whenever', 'onscreen', 'Given', 'pyrotechnical', 'personality', 'capable', 'literally', 'anything', 'Clarkson', 'best', 'can', 'role', 'Judy', 'Nash', 'one', 'few', 'opportunities', 'display', 'talents', 'same', 'true', 'role', 'Untouchables', 'Catherine', 'Ness', 'Bardem', 'stereotype', 'Latin', 'Lover', 'Heaven', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'charming', 'also', 'caring', 'person', 'who', 'completely', 'truthful', 'others', 'Note', 'direct', 'approach', 'first', 'encounter', 'Vicky', 'Cristy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'restaurant', 'first', 'seeing', 'art', 'gallery', 'earlier', 'other', 'characters', 'examine', 'values', 'perhaps', 'trust', 'feelings', 'more', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'Also', 'credit', 'Javier', 'Aquirresarobe', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'When', 'portraying', 'life', 'Barcelona', 'briefly', 'Oviedo', 'Allen', 'provide', 'visual', 'feast', 'gourmet', 'images.I', 'also', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'questions', 'remain', 'film', 'Will', 'Vicky', 'experience', 'same', 'disillusionment', 'Judy', 'Will', 'Cristina', 'finally', 'find', 'what', 'life', 'having', 'experimented', 'then', 'eliminated', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'Will', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'other', 'love', 'other', 'Lo', 'que', 'sera']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men.  Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fiance, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky`s middlebrow conception of domestic bliss.  Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more ""dangerous"" breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and a smoldering sexuality.When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life.  And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew:  Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work.  This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance.  This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio.  But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio`s home.  With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through.  Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous.  In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.Although Penelope Cruz earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances.  And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut`s ""Jules and Jim,"" probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.The conclusion ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - ""Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow"" - was right after all.",4,the trials and tribulations of the hot and sexy,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,4181,"['latest', 'romantic', 'escapade', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'wry', 'purveyor', 'modern', 'relationships', 'sexiness', 'purely', 'aesthetic', 'experience', 'course', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'do', 'when', 'have', 'cast', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'exploring', 'fine', 'art', 'love', 'lovemaking', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'setting.The', 'two', 'main', 'women', 'story', 'represent', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'views', 'love', 'men', 'Vicky', 'clear-thinking', 'pragmatist', 'who', 'when', 'opposite', 'sex', 'opts', 'stodgy', 'reliable', 'type', 'dashing', 'romantic', 'ideal', 'preference', 'reflected', 'choice', 'fiance', 'stuffed-shirt', 'Doug', 'dutiful', 'dullness', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Vicky', 's', 'middlebrow', 'conception', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'Cristina', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'free-living', 'Bohemian', 'type', 'gifted', 'amateur', 'photographer', 'who', 'more', 'dangerous', 'breed', 'man', 'one', 'propensity', 'living', 'life', 'moment', 'simmers', 'just', 'surface', 'handsome', 'appearance', 'smoldering', 'sexuality.When', 'travel', 'Spain', 'summer', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'almost', 'immediately', 'find', 'entangled', 'complex', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'abstract', 'painter', 'who', 'women', 'cultured', 'temperament', 'devil-may-care', 'attitude', 'smooth-talking', 'ways', 'raw', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'Old', 'World', 'passion', 'life', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'get', 'fourth', 'ingredient', 'added', 'already', 'spicy', 'brew', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'beautiful', 'volatile', 'possibly', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'ex-wife', 'whom', 'artist', 'clearly', 'never', 'gotten', 'apparently', 'never', 'will.As', 'always', 'Allen', 'remarkable', 'complexity', 'characters', 'view', 'how', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'actually', 'work', 'reflected', 'most', 'intensely', 'character', 'Vicky', 'who', 'brief', 'sizzling', 'encounter', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'question', 'old', 'willingness', 'settle', 'staid', 'conformity', 'emotional', 'security', 'all-consuming', 'passion', 'romance', 'course', 'whole', 'future', 'marriage', 'jeopardy', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'Cristina', 'once', 'latter', 'live-in', 'lover', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Cristina', 'problems', 'own', 'contend', 'when', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'taking', 'up', 'residence', 'newly', 'formed', 'couple', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 's', 'home', 'additional', 'twist', 'plot', 'Allen', 'new', 'color', 'depth', 'canvas', 'now', 'complexities', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'self-destructive', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'come', 'racing', 'fore.At', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'close', 'bone', 'truths', 'human', 'relationships', 'so', 'pinpoint', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'sit', 'least', 'would', 'tone', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'consistently', 'scintillating', 'lighthearted', 'setting', 'so', 'eye-popping', 'sensuous', 'fact', 'predict', 'Barcelona', 'so', 'richly', 'photographed', 'here', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', '-will', 'be', 'experiencing', 'tourism', 'boom', 'years', 'come', 'thanks', 'film.Although', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'earned', 'number', 'awards', 'including', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'work', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'actors', 'film', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'deliver', 'rich', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'singsong', 'deliberately', 'simplistic', 'narration', 'Allen', 'attached', 'story', 'be', 'homage', 'sorts', 'Truffaut', 's', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'romantic', 'roundelay', 'ever', 'committed', 'film.The', 'conclusion', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'come', 'NEITHER', 'approach', 'love', 'really', 'long', 'run', 'too', 'little', 'passion', 'relationship', 'may', 'lead', 'life', 'endless', 'regrets', 'unrealized', 'possibilities', 'too', 'much', 'passion', 'can', 'result', 'burnout', 'serial', 'infidelity', 'mutual', 'self-destruction', 'individuals', 'involved.Perhaps', 'Friar', 'Lawrence', 'advice', 'impetuous', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Therefore', 'love', 'moderately', 'long', 'love', 'doth', 'so', 'too', 'swift', 'arrives', 'as', 'tardy', 'too', 'slow', 'was', 'right']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

It is very &#34;Woody Allen,&#34; in that the movie centers around what? Infidelity. Snore. This has all the pitfalls of a Woody Allen movie: the harmless, obnoxious music and dialogue and the boring plot twists. So many of the scenes are low energy and end with you thinking &#34;is THAT what this movie is about?&#34; and then it fails to get any more exciting. You can't believe that the rising dramatic question is whether or not this person will cheat on their spouse, and what will happen if their spouse finds out. The dialogue is also wholly unrealistic and wooden and sadly far too intellectual for real life. It is also incredibly awkward. It is just boring to see Woody Allen be defensive about his intelligence and his fear that he is a phony intellectual. Sadly, Woody Allen made one pretty good movie 40 years ago (&#34;Annie Hall&#34;) and he has now become a legend for putting out 40 years of mediocre drivel.

1181505,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001DJ7PR8,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 3]","Woody Allen's ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona"" is a frustrating mix of a movie.  On the surface, it is smart (Woody Allen, after all), beautifully shot in one of the world's most gorgeous locations - Barcelona and the surrounding Spanish countryside - and filled with talented, glorious actors.But ultimately, the movie has an emptiness at its core that rankles - namely, why are these people so unhappy?The story revolves around two ladies who just don't know how good they have it.  If you are beautiful, rich, and able to ""live well,"" you should be thankful and able to suck the marrow out of life.  And yet Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) perpetually frown and quibble with life's minor details as they spend the summer in Barcelona (for free!) as they crash at a friend's spectacular villa.Most of us would feel as if we'd won the Lottery of Life to spend a summer like this.  Things get even better when gorgeous artist Juan Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) propositions the duo with a sex romp - coming from him, it's charming rather than sleazy.  This ultimately leads to romantic crises for both Vicky as she cheats on her hum-drum fiance with Juan and Cristina as she gets involved in a love triangle with Juan and his ex-wife, Maria (Penelope Cruz, in her Oscar-winning role).Throughout the movie, you want to scream at these beautiful people living beautiful lives - why aren't you happy????  Things are just too good to be believed - nobody seems to lack for funds, nobody has a bad job, and everybody is a cover model.  The nagging unreality of it all ultimately undermines the movie's ruminations on life, happiness, and relationships.Imagine, if you will, you strive to be a bohemian artist in Europe.  You find yourself living in a villa with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, developing your art and having sex with two of the most beautiful people alive (as a friend of mine said, the scenes with Bardem and Cruz had both her straight and lesbian friends throwing [.........] at the screen).  How on earth could you ever conclude, ""this is not enough for me""?  Yet it happens in this movie.I really, really wanted to love this movie, and while I can admire its craft - can I be the location scouter for Woody's next movie, or help light the sets? - the fact that these people are so far removed from any real universe neuters the movie.  The blame lies not with the actors - they are each radiant and talented - but with the yawning void of self-centered narcissism inside each character.

Like several of Woody's recent scripts it has its own ebb and flow, but his varied musings over the years come together into this sunny little tale that carries you naturally through a mishmash of quietly whimsical characters.And some characters they are! Javier continues to astonish with his versatility. After the eerie gravitas of ""No Country for Old Men"", he is sensational here in his buffoonery as an uber-suave artist, just as devoted to an epicurean life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his deadpan yet extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for his perpetual Flirt mode. Johannson is what only she can be, bemused and befuddled, although expect some distance from her usual sultry exuberance as her coolness seems oddly stunted.Rebecca Hall as Vicky, to me, seemed a bit grating in her attempt to fit the glove of a Woody Allen film too snugly, scattered speech patterns and all, but fortunately that seemed to go with the righteous ennui of her character. Penelope Cruz is fiery! I am sure her histrionics in the film will make critics buckle and heave, although I'd venture to suggest that shrieking tour-de-force parts are relatively easier to enact; embodying the ordinary on camera is what presents a challenge. But she is painfully convincing nonetheless.It's the natural groove of these protagonists that makes the film what it is. If I were to nitpick, a couple of aesthetic choices puzzled me. For instance, an omnipresent voice-over starts off giving the impression of being glib and satirical, but quickly becomes run-on, and then abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. And then there's the overuse of certain musical motifs that gets a bit repetitive.But the setting is gorgeous and makes up in spades. Spain gets its own visual paean, and what a lyric it is! No cultural stone is left unturned: photography, drawing, music, poetry, food, architecture, fashion. It's a fine ensemble.While it's not your garden variety ""Juno"" brand of comedy, there is wit in the evocative undertones. The film oozes something visceral. A comedy for grown-ups perhaps. Whatever your views about  menage-a-trois (or polyamory, or whatever they are calling it these days), the denouement is so natural and so untouched by pat pretenses that it is, well, sublime.I was amazed at how this film came and went so effortlessly, and still managed to turn something in me upside down.

It's not because of my looks but rather because passion, beauty and sex are a function of life Spain, France and Italy. And so it happens for Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Christina (Scarlett Johansson). While spending a summer holiday in Barcelona, Vicky and Christina are given a ""best offer"" from Juan Antonio (the dreamy Javier Badem), to fly away for the weekend. Vicky is hostile to his offer-she knows what she wants-a drama free relationship with her fiancee. Christina finds the offer and the man interesting and states her desire to go. To protect her friend, Vicky goes along for the ride, but finds herself caught in the undertow of love and succumbs unexpectedly to Juan Antonio's gentle seduction.The three return to Barcelona and Vicky returns to her work and her plans for marriage. Christina begins a relationship with Juan Antonio. Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (the gorgeous Penelope Cruz) tries to kill herself and Juan tells Christina they have to take care of her until she gets on her feet. Oddly, the ethereal Christina acts like a salve in the tumultuous relationship between Maria Elena and Juan Antonio. The three of them fall in love and life is going along swimmingly until Vicky begins to feel a familar desire-one which Maria Elena correctly labels ""perpetual discontent"" in an emotional tearful moment.In the meantime, Vicky continues to yearn for Juan Antonio, and her discontented Aunt schemes to set the two up. They meet for a seductive lunch, but seduction is in the head as much as the heart and taking from an earlier scene where Christina tells Juan Antonio that he shouldn't blow it with with something small-the wrong pair of shorts for example, he blows the seduction of Vicky completely with the wrong kind of life-a life of drama which the staid Vicky can not really imagine being a part of.This film has it's problems. First and foremost, Christopher Evan Welch talks over some of the scenes-almost like he was presenting script direction, ""Vicky felt x, while Christina felt..."". I'm a fan of ""show, don't tell"" and would have preferred to ""get it"" on my own.  With this style of presentation, Allen feels a bit controlling, as if he's going to tell his audience his message because we're too dumb to infer it on our own.  But whatever the problems with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I loved it. I love Allens exploration of culture. I saw Annie Hall when I was five and I've been intrigued with Allens brand of dysfuction ever since.Vicky Christina Barcelona is a gorgeous film, you'll enjoy the background shots of La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Like earlier Allen filmsManhattanorAnnie Hallwhere New York goes a long way in effecting the psyche and neurosis of the characters-Barcelona and the charm of the spanish country side disenchant Vicky and Christina with the lives they are living back in the States. Setting is never just a backdrop in an Allen film.A great film with gorgeous actors and a contemplative script. Worth seeing.If you enjoy Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I'd recommendMargot at the Wedding,Eagle vs. Shark,The Housekeeperand all of the Pedro Almodovar films, particularlyAll About My Mother] and [[ASIN:B00005JLQW Talk to Her (Hable con Ella).",5,"What's It All About, Woody?",1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,3308,"['Spoiler', 'Alert***When', 'go', 'Europe', 'get', 'propositioned-a', 'lot-in', 'metro', 'cars', 'cafes', 'street', 'not', 'looks', 'rather', 'passion', 'beauty', 'sex', 'are', 'function', 'life', 'Spain', 'France', 'Italy', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Christina', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'spending', 'summer', 'holiday', 'Barcelona', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'are', 'given', 'best', 'offer', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'dreamy', 'Javier', 'Badem', 'fly', 'away', 'weekend', 'Vicky', 'hostile', 'offer-she', 'knows', 'what', 'wants-a', 'drama', 'free', 'relationship', 'fiancee', 'Christina', 'offer', 'man', 'interesting', 'desire', 'go', 'protect', 'friend', 'Vicky', 'along', 'ride', 'caught', 'undertow', 'love', 'succumbs', 'unexpectedly', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'gentle', 'seduction.The', 'three', 'return', 'Barcelona', 'Vicky', 'returns', 'work', 'plans', 'marriage', 'Christina', 'relationship', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Juan', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'gorgeous', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'kill', 'Juan', 'tells', 'Christina', 'have', 'take', 'care', 'feet', 'Oddly', 'ethereal', 'Christina', 'acts', 'salve', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'three', 'fall', 'love', 'life', 'going', 'along', 'swimmingly', 'Vicky', 'feel', 'familar', 'desire-one', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'correctly', 'perpetual', 'discontent', 'emotional', 'tearful', 'moment.In', 'meantime', 'Vicky', 'yearn', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'discontented', 'Aunt', 'schemes', 'set', 'two', 'up', 'meet', 'seductive', 'lunch', 'seduction', 'head', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'taking', 'earlier', 'scene', 'where', 'Christina', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'should', ""n't"", 'blow', 'something', 'small-the', 'wrong', 'pair', 'shorts', 'example', 'seduction', 'Vicky', 'completely', 'wrong', 'kind', 'life-a', 'life', 'drama', 'staid', 'Vicky', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'imagine', 'being', 'part', 'of.This', 'film', 'problems', 'First', 'foremost', 'Christopher', 'Evan', 'Welch', 'talks', 'scenes-almost', 'was', 'presenting', 'script', 'direction', 'Vicky', 'felt', 'x', 'Christina', 'felt', ""'m"", 'fan', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'get', 'own', 'style', 'presentation', 'Allen', 'bit', 'controlling', 'going', 'tell', 'audience', 'message', ""'re"", 'too', 'dumb', 'infer', 'own', 'whatever', 'problems', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'loved', 'love', 'Allens', 'exploration', 'culture', 'saw', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'when', 'was', 'five', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intrigued', 'Allens', 'brand', 'dysfuction', 'ever', 'since.Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'gorgeous', 'film', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'background', 'shots', 'La', 'Sagrada', 'Familia', 'Park', 'Guell', 'earlier', 'Allen', 'filmsManhattanorAnnie', 'Hallwhere', 'New', 'York', 'long', 'way', 'effecting', 'psyche', 'neurosis', 'characters-Barcelona', 'charm', 'spanish', 'country', 'side', 'disenchant', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'lives', 'are', 'living', 'back', 'States', 'Setting', 'never', 'just', 'backdrop', 'Allen', 'film.A', 'great', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'contemplative', 'script', 'Worth', 'seeing.If', 'enjoy', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', ""'d"", 'recommendMargot', 'Wedding', 'Eagle', 'vs.', 'Shark', 'Housekeeperand', 'Pedro', 'Almodovar', 'films', 'particularlyAll', 'My', 'Mother', ']', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B00005JLQW', 'Talk', 'Her', 'Hable', 'con', 'Ella']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

People think you long for the old days when he was &#34;funny&#34;, or that you have a problem with his sex life.  I hate his movies for the past 25 years because he has really only made one movie in his life.  Each one is about an annoying neurotic narcissistic whiner nebbish, which is to say, him.  The first ten times or so it was good--funny, interesting.  Manhattan is a great film, in fact.  Making the same movie over and over and over gets pretty tedious.  Hiring other actors to play you again and again after you are forced to admit you are too old is also tedious.  Most Woody impressions in his films are truly awful.  Owen Wilson stands out as being particularly horrifying.So I forgot this was a Woody Allen movie until it started, and then I thought &#34;What the hell, let's try another one.&#34;  Javier Bardem is good.  He's already demonstrated that he can even play a demon and bring something enjoyable to the role.  Here, he's the hunky fantasy guy for girls on vacation in a romantic locale.  This is probably as much as you need to know about the plot.  The brunette has the Woody role, by which I mean she starts expressing angst at some point.  She's better (slightly less annoying and/or putrid) than most of the male Woodys over the past couple of decades.What makes this movie truly awful is the narration, which is constant and pointless.  When a character is taking photographs, he says &#34;She took many more pictures&#34;.  Thanks.  Whatever slight entertainment value this film may have had is eaten alive by the endless and purposeless narration.

The first is for the acting of Bardem and Cruz which rises above the mediocrity of the material given them. The second is for the beautiful photography, in this case of Barcelona. The third is for the tentative hints of irony which fitfully peep out in the course of the numerous betrayals among lovers this film apparently accepts as standard operating procedure for sophisticated contemporary persons.Woody Allen's judgment - or lack of it - is clearly inferior to his talent. His characters have experiences, yet neither he nor any of them seems to seek after, much less grasp, their meaning. Theirs are lives only of sensations, not of thoughts; they can resist everything except temptation; adultery, for example, is presented here consequently as less a betrayal of integrity than a logistical inconvenience.  Eschewing judgment of actions lest he be thought ""judgmental"" of persons, Allen - and by extension his characters -  emerges as less sophisticated than as diminished by arrested development, one whose vision remains embarrassingly that of an overly-hormonal teenager.An infinitely greater artist Henry James, when he dealt with the international scene, saw that the key to a character's wholeness and maturity often rested with the ability to sacrifice, to renounce a less than finely human course of action.

1181515,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001DJ7PR8,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 5]","""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" a romantic comic drama from the popular, well-known American humorist/filmmaker Woody Allen, a New York native himself, is another good illustration of the theory numerous critics have put forward.  That, these days, Allen does his best work when he removes himself from New York's dominant island, Manhattan, and works elsewhere.Barcelona is certainly famous as a beautiful, historic city that boasts some world class architecture by Anton Gaudi; the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe captures it well. The film also contains some coming of age elements.  It opens as Vicky (Rebecca Hall,Wide Sargasso Sea); and Cristina (Scarlett Johanssen,The Other Boleyn Girl): college buddies, debark from a plane in Barcelona, planning to spend the summer there. They are to stay with friends. Mark (Kevin Dunn,Lions For Lambs (Widescreen Edition); and Judy Nash, (Patricia Clarkson,No Reservations).  And the best friends forever are intent on finding themselves.  Instead they find artist Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem,No Country for Old Men).  Gonzalo fancies them both, makes no secret of it and, along with the romantic entanglements, hard feelings will ensue.  Things will get even more intense as we and they meet his explosive, greatly talented ex-wife Maria Elana (Penelope Cruz,Volver).  The quartet will resolve itself into a series of love triangles, the points of which continuously rearrange themselves.Well, this time out, the Woodman has delivered a funny picture, though it's no competition for his great early comic films.  And, talking of earlier films, the writer-director's 2001The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, showed the 70ish Allen being ruthlessly pursued by three beautiful 30ish actresses: a situation that might reflect the dreams of a lot of men -or Hollywood reality - but I'd rather not pay money to see.  In this film, Bardem, who has a lot of Woody- like lines, is being pursued by two beautiful 20ish actresses, and one extremely beautiful 30ish actress.  Guess it's an improvement, but it sure is a limited one.",3,A Limited Improvement,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,2073,"['Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'romantic', 'comic', 'drama', 'popular', 'well-known', 'American', 'humorist/filmmaker', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'New', 'York', 'native', 'good', 'illustration', 'theory', 'numerous', 'critics', 'have', 'put', 'forward', 'days', 'Allen', 'best', 'work', 'when', 'New', 'York', 'dominant', 'island', 'Manhattan', 'elsewhere.Barcelona', 'certainly', 'famous', 'beautiful', 'historic', 'city', 'world', 'class', 'architecture', 'Anton', 'Gaudi', 'cinematography', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe', 'well', 'film', 'also', 'coming', 'age', 'elements', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'college', 'buddies', 'debark', 'plane', 'Barcelona', 'planning', 'spend', 'summer', 'there', 'are', 'stay', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Judy', 'Nash', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'No', 'Reservations', 'best', 'friends', 'forever', 'are', 'intent', 'finding', 'Instead', 'find', 'artist', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Gonzalo', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Gonzalo', 'secret', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'hard', 'feelings', 'will', 'ensue', 'Things', 'will', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'meet', 'explosive', 'greatly', 'talented', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Elana', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Volver', 'quartet', 'will', 'resolve', 'series', 'love', 'triangles', 'points', 'continuously', 'rearrange', 'themselves.Well', 'time', 'out', 'Woodman', 'delivered', 'funny', 'picture', 'competition', 'great', 'early', 'comic', 'films', 'talking', 'earlier', 'films', 'writer-director', '2001The', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'showed', '70ish', 'Allen', 'being', 'ruthlessly', 'pursued', 'three', 'beautiful', '30ish', 'actresses', 'situation', 'might', 'reflect', 'dreams', 'lot', 'men', '-or', 'Hollywood', 'reality', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'film', 'Bardem', 'who', 'lot', 'Woody-', 'lines', 'being', 'pursued', 'two', 'beautiful', '20ish', 'actresses', 'one', 'extremely', 'beautiful', '30ish', 'actress', 'Guess', 'improvement', 'sure', 'limited', 'one']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1181516,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001DJ7PR8,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","People often think that I don't have a sense of humor. This is mainly due to the fact that I don't tell jokes, and I rarely find comedies funny. Slapstick humor only works if it involves Peter Sellers, or similar genius. Most comedies are so predictable that I see the jokes coming, and they aren't very funny when they arrive. But that doesn't mean that I don't like to laugh. I look for comedy within other genres because I find that humor works better for me when it is witty, and buried within a believable situation. That's why I turn to directors like Quentin Tarantino, the Coens, Martin McDonagh, Wes Anderson, and Woody Allen when I want to laugh.Woody Allen's humor won't work for everyone. His earlier work did contain significant amounts of physical humor and jokes, but I think he's at his best when he writes more seriously. Vicky Cristina Barcelona falls into that category. It's an examination of human nature, more than a comedy, but there are still plenty of amusing scenes.What qualities do you find attractive in a romantic partner? Allen asks that question, and uses Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) to show two very different views. Vicky seeks stability, and likes to know what to expect from her man. Cristina is more of a free spirit, and wants her partners to have a similar outlook on life. Vicky has her future carefully planned, and is due to marry, whereas Cristina is still exploring and trying to find exactly what it is she is looking for. The thing is, she isn't sure what that is.Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is an artist, and boldly asks the two women to take a trip with him. He openly says that they will all make love during the trip. This proposition is attractive to Cristina, but Vicky is shocked by his brazen approach and wants nothing to do with him. Needless to say, the three do eventually make the trip. Juan Antonio is not a conventional man, and still has feelings for ex-wife Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz). Like him, she's passionate and unpredictable, as well as being an artist herself.The story uses a narrator, and it's a great vehicle for some of the humor. Allen assembles a fantastic cast, as always, and the principals all give strong performances. Other notable appearances come from Vicky's husband-to-be, Doug (Chris Messina), and Judy (Patricia Clarkson), who is an important part of the puzzle.Pen&eacute;lope Cruz won an Oscar for her supporting role, and she certainly steals most of the scenes in which she appears. Her character is a catalyst for the events that unfold in the second half of the movie, and it's during this time that Allen raises the most questions about the motives of his characters.The writing is superb and left me thinking about relationships I have been involved in, and also some of the relationships that I have watched develop between my friends and acquaintances. Human interactions are unpredictable, complicated, and fascinating, and Allen weaves an interesting tale featuring all of those elements.If you enjoyed such movies as Closer, Midnight in Paris, (500) Days of Summer, or The Graduate, you'll probably find something to like in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I think it's up there with Allen's most enjoyable work.",5,What makes us decide who is attractive?,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,3242,"['People', 'often', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'jokes', 'rarely', 'find', 'comedies', 'funny', 'Slapstick', 'humor', 'only', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'similar', 'genius', 'Most', 'comedies', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', 'see', 'jokes', 'coming', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'arrive', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'laugh', 'look', 'comedy', 'other', 'genres', 'find', 'humor', 'better', 'when', 'witty', 'buried', 'believable', 'situation', 'why', 'turn', 'directors', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Coens', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'when', 'want', 'laugh.Woody', 'Allen', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'everyone', 'earlier', 'work', 'did', 'contain', 'significant', 'amounts', 'physical', 'humor', 'jokes', 'think', 'best', 'when', 'more', 'seriously', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'category', 'examination', 'human', 'nature', 'more', 'comedy', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'amusing', 'scenes.What', 'qualities', 'do', 'find', 'attractive', 'romantic', 'partner', 'Allen', 'question', 'Vicky', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Cristina', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'show', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'views', 'Vicky', 'stability', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'man', 'Cristina', 'more', 'free', 'spirit', 'partners', 'have', 'similar', 'outlook', 'life', 'Vicky', 'future', 'carefully', 'planned', 'due', 'marry', 'Cristina', 'still', 'exploring', 'trying', 'find', 'exactly', 'what', 'looking', 'thing', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'is.Juan', 'Antonio', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'artist', 'boldly', 'two', 'women', 'take', 'trip', 'openly', 'will', 'make', 'love', 'trip', 'proposition', 'attractive', 'Cristina', 'Vicky', 'shocked', 'brazen', 'approach', 'nothing', 'do', 'Needless', 'say', 'three', 'do', 'eventually', 'make', 'trip', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'not', 'conventional', 'man', 'still', 'feelings', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'passionate', 'unpredictable', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'artist', 'herself.The', 'story', 'narrator', 'great', 'vehicle', 'humor', 'Allen', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'always', 'principals', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'Other', 'notable', 'appearances', 'come', 'Vicky', 'husband-to-be', 'Doug', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'Judy', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'important', 'part', 'puzzle.Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'won', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'role', 'certainly', 'most', 'scenes', 'character', 'catalyst', 'events', 'unfold', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'time', 'Allen', 'most', 'questions', 'motives', 'characters.The', 'writing', 'superb', 'left', 'thinking', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'also', 'relationships', 'have', 'watched', 'develop', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'Human', 'interactions', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'complicated', 'fascinating', 'Allen', 'interesting', 'tale', 'featuring', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'movies', 'Closer', 'Midnight', 'Paris', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Graduate', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'think', 'up', 'there', 'Allen', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'work']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

1181522,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B001DJ7PR8,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[11, 12]","In a way, Woody Allen is every bit the escapist a filmmaker as are the directors who give us CGI dinosaurs and galactic space battles.  In what world other than Woody's do Bohemian painters, sculptors, writers, photographers and poets live in handsome houses, drink fine wines, drive luxury cars, and buy expensive antiques?  Of course it's not that no great artists are so successful in the real world, but in Woody's movies everyone is.  And none of the other characters blink, or remark what an unusual situation we have here.  (For a more realistic vision of how a relatively obscure artist lives [a poet this time] see The Hours.)  Woody's people may still reside in the Village mentally, but materialistically their tastes are more Park Avenue, Rome and Paris, just like their creator.Woody wants to eat his cake and have it too.  His films always include boring characters (or more precisely, attractive, young and insecure females married or engaged to boring male characters) who work in the stuffy corporate world.  The implication from Allen is always that these are the dull people in life, that the Bohemians are the romantics with imagination and fire and passion.  Yet the Bohemians never pay the price by living as Bohemians do.  Their lifestyles and the incomes required to support them are those of the bean-counters that Woody seems to disdain.  Only their sexual appetites seem more acute, their mores looser.  Even though he's now 73, I can still feel Woody's adolescent insecurities, which he's never seemed to get over, and I'm not being puritanical here: I don't just mean the preverted insecurities...Which brings me to Vicky Cristina Barcelona.  This film is reminiscent of Manhattan, with a touch of Annie Hall, Match Point, Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Hannah and her Sisters, Mighty Aphrodite, and a dozen other films thrown in: young Ivy League-ish females of conflicting temperaments and values and have ""existential"" crises in the middle of the film; said crises are solved by rotating or experimenting with sex partners.  Or maybe the rotating of the sex partners *caused* the crises--we're so confused.  But we do a lot of hand-wringing in the second act, always over fine wines and killer views, or inside million-dollar apartments somehow owned by the aforementioned Bohemian artists.  In the end, there's a change once again of heart and we basically wind up at square one, where we started with these people.  After years of being accused of making the same basic idea over and over, Woody has bought a Fodor's guidebook and set some of his more recent remakes in Europe.At least it's all great fun.  Throughout VCB I felt Woody wasn't taking this too seriously: this *isn't,* thank heavens, Interiors.  It's almost as though Woody's become a self-aware manqu&eacute; of himself lately.  I mean, can we really expect anything new and eye-opening in the 30th film about young neurotic females on a journey that involves partner-swapping and clever allusions to the art world any more than we can expect anything new from Star Wars VII: Revenge of the Droid Clones, whenever George Lucas decides to make it?  By now attending Woody Allen films, like attending Lucas' films, has become ritual to the fans.Rebecca Hall plays the Diane Keaton part.  Scarlett Johansson plays the Mia Farrow, or Mariel Hemingway, or whoever, part.  It's well-written, within strict limits.  Woody has a great ear for how people, at least people of a particular circle, talk, and he lets them talk, which is refreshing in an era where so much film ""dialogue"" consists of the ""f"" word or sarcastic one-liners and immature sex jokes.  At he same time, name me, jokes aside, a really great, memorable line from any WA film. Most of it is throwaway, and you could cut and paste a rant from Dianne Wiest's mouth from Hannah And Her Sisters into one of the characters here. But at least Allen's gotten over his other big insecurity, which is filling his scripts with allusions to writers, philosophers, composers and other highbrows to show you how literate he is.*  (Yes, I know he makes fun of people like this--Diane Keaton in Manhattan--but he also fills his ""Woody"" character with enough knowledge from Everyman's Library to keep the writers on Jeopardy busy for months.)  The film is gorgeously shot, well-acted (especially by the women) and engaging.  But in the end, it feels hollow, partly because we've been there before, partly because he's not even *riffing* on himself anymore.  No one and nothing changes at the end of VCB.  Without giving away spoilers, I'll just say no one seems to come to any realizations, which is why I put quotes around the word existential.  They just have problems that last for two hours, conveniently. Fade out with some plucky music and those Windsor-font credits.Not a bad film, but nothing to write home (or send postcards) about either. Also, as a few others have pointed out, the narrator was unnecessary, and the film would have been a bit better if we could have reached for ourselves some of the conclusions we are spoon-fed.--* Of course I wrote this review before Midnight in Paris.",3,* * 1/2  Otra variaci&oacute;n de Manhattan...,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,5143,"['way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'bit', 'escapist', 'filmmaker',

1181527,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001DJ7PR8,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**In his early days, after he gave up writing comedies such as 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', Woody Allen desperately anted to join the ranks of the world's great directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. He churned out pretentious drivel such as ""Interiors"" in an attempt to emulate his beloved Bergman but deep down he always knew that he could never approach the great director's depth. So he turned to a mixture of romantic comedy and his own brand of 'art house fare' in the films that made him famous: 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters'. Unfortunately, until the impressive ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", he was never able to muster enough sympathy for his characters to make them credible enough or engaging. There was always that flash of arrogance underneath the surface that Allen was unable to hide; he was always one step above his characters, looking down on them rather then striking the necessary balance between sympathy and contempt.At a certain point, Allen threw up his hands and decided for awhile that maybe he should go back to his strong suit as an 'entertainer'. He churned out fluff pieces such as 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' but made one last attempt at joining the great directors' pantheon with ""Deconstructing Harry"", another failed attempt to emulate Bergman. Allen floundered until 2005 when he came out with 'Match Point' which marked a welcome move to the mainstream. No longer starring in his own films and filming in England, Allen decided that he no longer had to prove to the world that he was the next Fellini or Bergman. Up until the unconvincing climax, 'Match Point' was a taut drama chronicling the machinations of a lower-class retired tennis pro as he manipulates family members in an upper class milieu.Vicky Christina Barcelona is content to examine all strictly middle class characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Before Allen shows us the 'dark' side to his characters, he wisely builds sympathy for them. Both Vicky and Christina are adventurers. Vicky, the more conservative of the two, is extremely skeptical of Juan Antonio's proposal to fly in his private plane for a weekend of wild abandon in a picaresque Spanish town. Her skepticism and conservative nature are her strong points. Christina, in contrast, believes in taking chances without thinking about the consequences so she convinces Vicky to accept Juan Antonio's proposal. While Christina often acts recklessly, her desire for freedom often leads her to new, interesting experiences which the average person would never dream of entertaining.Juan Antonio, the suave Lothario, who sees nothing wrong in seducing as many women as he can, also has many likable attributes. Not only is he a 'smooth operator' but he has that 'senstive side' that women are drawn to. Vicky finds Juan Antonio's proposition to visit his father his ""first genuinely interesting proposition"". Juan Antonio's startling account of why his father won't share his poetry with the world draws Vicky to him. Juan Antonio's ex-girlfriend, the volatile Maria Elena, can hold her own with her ex in regards to creative pursuits. Not only does Juan Antonio claim that his strength as an artist can be attributed to Maria Elena but she is genuinely helpful to Christina when she teaches her how to become an accomplished photographer.The plot of VCB never bores. The break into Act II occurs when Juan Antonio takes Vicky and Christina on a wild weekend. Up until the midpoint there are many twists: Christina becomes sick right before making love; Juan Antonio's seduction of Vicky; Doug's proposal to get married first in Spain and his arrival and Christina's decision to move in with Juan Antonio.The midpoint marks escalating tension. This is when Maria Elena attempts suicide and moves in with Christina and Juan Antonio. More twists and turns occur in the second half of Act II: Maria Elena's terrible jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the m&eacute;nage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.Woody Allen does a much better job with his climax than in Match Point since Maria Elena's 'crime of passion' is more believable than Chris, the ex-tennis pro's foray into full-blown murder.Just as he views his characters with sympathy, Woody Allen doesn't hesitate to criticize them. Vicky admits that her husband Doug is a wonderful guy, someone who she's always wanted but cannot throw off her irrational attraction to Juan Antonio. Even at the end, she's about to be seduced by Juan Antonio AGAIN but is brought back to reality when Maria Elena's gun goes off and she sustains a flesh wound to her hand. Christina seems naturally drawn to vacuous affairs. Even at the beginning, she's telling Juan Antonio she'll go up to his room but ""you'll have to seduce ME"". She's also a bit arrogant when she tells him, ""You're home free, unless you blow it"". Christina never knows ""what she wants"" but does know ""what she DOESN'T want"".Juan Antonio seems to go from one woman to another but is unable to make a commitment. His narcissism seems to always lead to bad feelings of jealousy amongst the various women he seduces. And of course Maria Elena is the ultimate narcissist in that she can't accept others unless they give her 100% loyalty.The overuse of the narrator in VCB is perhaps the film's major flaw. One wonders why Woody Allen doesn't trust his audience to draw its own conclusions. Nonetheless, VCB marks a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen. It's a perceptive and critical look at European and American sensibilities regarding relationships and how they can go awry.",4,Women from both sides of the Atlantic have trouble walking away from

Vicky remained pragmatic and unable to do anything drastic to change her life, Christina was still unsatisfied and unsure about what she wanted in hers.So what was the point of all this?",3,Mixed feelings,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,636,"['First', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'Bohemian', 'life', 'style', 'always', 'fascinated', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'fantastic', 'location', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'good', 'least', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'delivered', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'never', 'boring.However', 'left', 'thinking', 'what', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'as', 'well', 'everybody', 'else', 'story', 'being', 'events', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'completely', 'untouched', 'Vicky', 'remained', 'pragmatic', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'drastic', 'change', 'life', 'Christina', 'was', 'still', 'unsatisfied', 'unsure', 'what', 'wanted', 'hers.So', 'what', 'was', 'point']",Vicky Cristina Barcelona

He reached the top of his form with Annie Hall and the beautifully filmed Manhattan. Since then, there have been some decent films, but most have been disappointing. Moving to Europe seems to have worked for him, first with the excellent Match Point and now with his best film in years. Vicky Cristina Barcelona features a great cast, an excellent script and picturesque locations in Spain. I recommend the blu-ray version for the shots of Gaudi's architectural creations in Barcelona and the scenery in Oviedo.
