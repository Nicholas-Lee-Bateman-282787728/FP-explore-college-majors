26094,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,0780022084,absent_minded_prof,"[16, 16]","This movie is a very skillful presentation of William Golding's eponymous, timeless sociological horror story. A group of boys ranging from around 6 to, I would guesstimate, 14 or 15, are stranded on a desert island. Unfortunately for the boys, the general spirit of their story parts ways with the spirit of &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; immediately, and they end up deteriorating into tribal, superstitious savages, rent with internecine strife, in a matter of (evidently) weeks.Any viewer out there who plans to see this movie should absolutely make an effort to read the book. You could possibly see the movie first, if you digest storylines more easily through movies than books. But whatever order you carry out the two activities in, you must see the movie AND read the book, if you want a full understanding of what the director was doing here.Here are a few good things to notice. First of all, you should be aware that this film was shot mostly on the islet of Vieques, off the coast of Puerto Rico. It's hard to believe that this is true, because it's just so perfect -- Vieques is the island where the U.S. Navy practices bombing these days, and protesters against war have been getting into all kinds of clashes with the authorities the past few months (spring and summer of 2001). Maybe &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was more prophetic than the director, actors and writers ever even realized.A second thing to notice is the song that is constantly playing, throughout most of the movie. The song is &quot;Kyrie Eleison.&quot; At first Jack's choir sings it, and then it sort of becomes general background music. If you happen not to be particularly into going to church, let me just clue you in that &quot;kyrie eleison&quot; is Greek for &quot;Lord have mercy,&quot; which I think you'll agree is a chillingly apt refrain for this relentlessly dark movie.A third good thing to notice is the little boy, who progressively loses his memory of his own identity, over the course of the film. At first, he automatically recites his full name, address and phone number to any stranger he meets, as he was apparently taught to do by his parents. Midway through the film, he can remember only his name, and part of his address. By the end, not to spoil the ending by giving too much away, he cannot even recollect his name. &quot;How quickly,&quot; one envisions William Golding bemoaning, &quot;we forget!&quot;But I'm just pointing out a few minor things to notice. The basic theme is obviously the clash between savagery and civilization, and the tendency for things to fall apart, for the center not to hold... George Washington himself used to say that the job of government has to do with Fear -- instilling it in possible malefactors, in enemies of the state, even in respected members of the community, just to keep everyone in line. This movie makes you think about what might happen if that force were removed from society as a whole. If the function of art is to raise awareness of painful truths, as this movie does, then the individual must be sure to bring things other than art into their lives, in order to raise awareness of kinder truths which are no less valid, no less serious, and no less important for being kind. That's what I think anyway.This is an interesting movie, and it will really make you think.

26097,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780022084,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 7]","I was having a discussion recently about unfilmable books, and I've come to the opinion that `Lord of the Flies' is one of those.  The reasons a piece of literature or a story in general could be considered unfilmable ar as varied as the day is long.  It could be the emotional context, the subject matter or the visual grandeur that is just lost on the screen.  Some stories thrive on the printed page and yet fizzle on the big screen.For me, `Lord of the Flies' is one of the greatest novels ever written.  Sadly, it has not made for a very good movie yet.  I think the biggest hindrance is the fact that child actors are hard to direct to perfection.  It takes something special in a child actor to convey the emotional range and decline of morale that is depicted in `Lord of the Flies', and while some directors have extracted Oscar caliber performances from children as young as four years old, it is very hard to do that with a cast of twenty all consisting of children.  It showed here (as well as in the 1990 version) and it distracts from the impact this film is supposed to have.Tom Gaman and Hugh Edwards are especially bad in this film.But there is more to it than that.  There are some things that one can read and take in that they don't wish to see actually portrayed on the screen, and I think that happens a lot when concerning children.  Golding's novel has no restraint, for it thrusts itself forward in an attempt to jar the reader and show them the severity of the times.  There is a sense of restraint in these film adaptations, mostly because some scenes are just too much for the big screen.  The 1990 version stupidly thinks that sprinkling curse words will make the film more edgy or relevant, and thankfully this 1963 version is more streamlined to the actual events and depictions of the book, but it still doesn't quite work.Neither version fully conveys the weight of Golding's message.  It is lost in the awkward delivery and the lack of clear subliminal symmetry.  We struggle, as a viewer, to piece together the relevance of the situation or the links between the boy's decline and the world surrounding them, and while this particular version attempts to connect the two it never manages to get us there.  It falls short of the mark.Personally, it's a coin toss as to which version is better.  Hook's 1990 version makes some poor `updating' choices and yet from a technical standpoint it towers over Brook's version.  The 1990 version has phenomenal cinematography, but both films fail to produce a cast of respectable talents and the stiff and awkward delivery of the material make these adaptations hard to rally behind.The score was fantastic though, so there's that.",2,The unfilmable film...,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2705,"['was', 'having', 'discussion', 'recently', 'unfilmable', 'books', ""'ve"", 'come', 'opinion', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'one', 'reasons', 'piece', 'literature', 'story', 'general', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'unfilmable', 'ar', 'as', 'varied', 'day', 'long', 'could', 'be', 'emotional', 'context', 'subject', 'matter', 'visual', 'grandeur', 'just', 'lost', 'screen', 'stories', 'thrive', 'printed', 'page', 'yet', 'fizzle', 'big', 'screen.For', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'one', 'greatest', 'novels', 'ever', 'written', 'Sadly', 'not', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'yet', 'think', 'biggest', 'hindrance', 'fact', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'hard', 'direct', 'perfection', 'something', 'special', 'child', 'actor', 'convey', 'emotional', 'range', 'decline', 'morale', 'depicted', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'directors', 'have', 'extracted', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performances', 'children', 'as', 'young', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'cast', 'twenty', 'consisting', 'children', 'showed', 'here', 'as', 'well', '1990', 'version', 'impact', 'film', 'supposed', 'have.Tom', 'Gaman', 'Hugh', 'Edwards', 'are', 'especially', 'bad', 'film.But', 'more', 'are', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'see', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'think', 'lot', 'when', 'concerning', 'children', 'Golding', 'novel', 'restraint', 'forward', 'attempt', 'jar', 'reader', 'show', 'severity', 'times', 'sense', 'restraint', 'film', 'adaptations', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'big', 'screen', '1990', 'version', 'stupidly', 'sprinkling', 'curse', 'words', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'edgy', 'relevant', 'thankfully', '1963', 'version', 'more', 'streamlined', 'actual', 'events', 'depictions', 'book', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.Neither', 'version', 'fully', 'weight', 'Golding', 'message', 'lost', 'awkward', 'delivery', 'lack', 'clear', 'subliminal', 'symmetry', 'struggle', 'viewer', 'piece', 'together', 'relevance', 'situation', 'links', 'boy', 'decline', 'world', 'surrounding', 'particular', 'version', 'attempts', 'connect', 'two', 'never', 'get', 'there', 'short', 'mark.Personally', 'coin', 'toss', 'version', 'better', 'Hook', '1990', 'version', 'poor', 'updating', 'choices', 'yet', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'Brook', 'version', '1990', 'version', 'phenomenal', 'cinematography', 'films', 'fail', 'produce', 'cast', 'respectable', 'talents', 'stiff', 'awkward', 'delivery', 'material', 'make', 'adaptations', 'hard', 'rally', 'behind.The', 'score', 'was', 'fantastic']",N/A

26099,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0780022084,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 2]","Very dark and literally savage, but pretty good. A comparatively accurate excerpt from the book. The movie only goes as far as when the clean white uniforms of some sort of adult officers show up, while the book follows them back to England and what trouble these kids had being re-civilized. It also starts somewhat before the airplane crash that brought them to their tropical island, which was only just suggested during the opening credits of the movie.A couple of groups of English schoolboys were on a plane flight that went down on a deserted island. We start with Ralph, who soon finds Piggy. who told Ralph not to tell the other kids to call him that, but of course he told. He argued that it was better than ""Fatty."" They walk along the beach for awhile and find a large conch shell. When Ralph blows on it, the sound attracts the rest of the kids. This includes a group of choir boys in their cloaks and hats and ruffled collars, singing Kyrie Elaison. [Which is probably not how you spell it.]Jack is the head boy of the choir, and so assumes he should be the chief of the tribe. But the boys other than the choir vote in Ralph. So Jack organizes the choir into a hunting party, with sharpened sticks. Apparently Jack had the only knife on the island.And Piggy wears glasses, which becomes critical when they go to light a signal fire so that any rescue party will know they are there.Without going into too much detail, let's just say that most of the boys, headed by Jack, turn into a truly savage tribe. Ralph tries to hold together the rational ones, but is very nearly killed for his efforts. And a couple of boys were really killed.As to the title, that is the severed pig's head which was put on a post as an offering to the Beast which all the children fear, even Ralph.

26100,A20IIR0422G3A5,0780022084,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[158, 160]","`Lord of the Flies' has been made into a movie at least twice since the William Golding novel of the same name became a cult classic / must read volume for high school and college students in the late 1950s. The first version, which follows the novel very closely, was done in black and white by the noted director, Peter Brook in 1963. The second version was done in color by Harry Hook and released in 1990.Like many remakes in the same language, one immediately wonders why bother, as the original Brook version is more than gripping enough to convey the message of the novel.To highlight the differences between the two versions, let me outline the story shared by the two versions.The scene is set when an airplane carrying school children crashes in the South Pacific, of the coast of a remote tropical island. Approximately 30 of the children, ages 6 to 13 make it to shore and gather on the beach to work out how they are to survive and assume that since they are far removed from their original destination and the island is small and uninhabited, there is a good chance it will take a long time, if ever, for grown-ups to find and rescue them. The first two principle characters are Ralph, one of the two or three oldest boys who we meet first, in the company of an intelligent, bespectacled, slightly overweight boy of the same age known as `Piggy'. The third main character is Jack, about as old and as fit as Ralph. Three minor named characters are Simon, who is prone to fainting and `seeing things' and Sam and Eric, a pair of twins.An early vote sets up Ralph as the leader, with a few rules establishing a conch shell found by Ralph and Piggy in the first reel as the symbol of the right to speak to the gathering of boys. Jack immediately assumes the responsibility as leader of a `gang' (later to become a `tribe') of hunters who will also take responsibility for maintaining a signal fire which Ralph succeeds in lighting by using Piggy's eyeglass lens as a means of concentrating sunlight on a clump of tinder.Jack's gang gets involved too much in hunting and allows the signal fire to go out just as an aircraft flies near the island. Soon, a story evolves about the presence of a monster on the island. This creates the pretext for Jack to split off from the group with his tribe and create a camp at a more defensible location. As this larger group becomes more and more primitive, they raid Ralph's camp and steal Piggy's specs since it is the only means they have for starting fires. To placate the monster, the head of a killed wild pig is cut from its carcass and stood on the top of a pole near the suspected monster's lair as an offering to the monster.After a few days, Simon observes this pig's head and its very large collection of flies feasting on the festering flesh and imagines he hears the pigs head speak to him, hence, the source of the title. Simon is then killed when the hunters mistake him in the night for the monster.When Ralph and Piggy walk to Jack's camp to recover Piggy's specs, Piggy is killed by another `accident' when Jack's tribe members pry a large boulder loose that falls on Piggy. Ralph and Jack fight, Ralph is driven off, and the whole tribe sets fire to the jungle to flush out Ralph and, presumably, kill him. Both stories end as Ralph runs to the beach to find himself at the feet of a very professionally uniformed member of his country's elite armed services.Hook spices up the dialogue by making the boys much more hip with lots of swear words and references to contemporary popular shows such as Alf and Miss Piggy of the Muppets. Unfortunately, Hook loses the two most important elements of the whole story. In the beginning of the novel and, subtly, in the beginning of Brook's film, we see that the world is once more at war and the boys from several different schools are on a plane to Australia to find relative safety from the coming (nuclear?) conflict. Hook shows nothing of this, giving us simply a group of boys from the same military academy on a trip to goodness knows where. This totally looses the whole allegorical sense of the story where the conflict between the boys mirrors the war in the world at large, especially the sense of the last scene where the world (island) is destroyed by the conflict (fire).The second major oversight in Hook's rendition is that there is never enough attention given to the significance of the pig's head, Simon's vision, and the sense of `The Lord of the Flies'. A less important point is that the origin of the monster myth is different in the two movies. Brook's film follows the book and has it be a misinterpretation of a billowing parachute from a fallen, dead pilot. Hook creates the myth out of the spasms of the downed plane's delirious pilot as he finds refuge in a cave and is rediscovered by Simon who believes he is a monster.Both movies do a credible job of depicting the fall of nominally civilized boys into savagery and myth. The combat between Ralph and Jack near the end is straight out of Frazier's `The Golden Bough' on the myth of killing the king. Unfortunately, Hook's version seems as eviscerated as the pig carcass, as all the great allegorical of the original story are totally lost. And, as minimal as they were, I even think the boys' performances in Brook's version are better done, as their initial innocence in the face of this loss of civilization makes their transformation all the more interesting.Brook's version is highly recommended.",5,"Excellent, durable version of the Novel.

Adapted from the book of Nobel Prize winner William Golding, the movie relates the adventures of a group of english  children lost in a desert island after the crash of their airplane. The  purpose of Golding-Brooks was not to describe another Robinson Cruso story  but rather to describe the evolution or rather the regression of a society  left without the protection of the laws established during 2000 years of  civilization.So, LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegory. One can easily  follow the ideas of Peter Brook if we keep in mind that the actions of the  children can be read in the mirror of ethnological or anthropological  recent discoveries. Their fear from the beast that some of the children  believe to have seen in the tropical nights is very close to the fear of  God or of the gods of our ancestors, and so on.Shot in black and white  and with children wonderfully directed by Peter Brook, LORD OF THE FLIES is  hypnotizing.

The credits, done in a slide-show fashion, do a great job of contextualizing the opening situation for students (although some explanation may be needed).

When we were done with the book, I replayed several scenes with the commentary: the casting of Piggy, how the night dancing scene was lit, the pig's head and how they rigged it, and how they did the rock scene with Piggy.  One or two of the people contributing are rather soft-spoken or don't enunciate well, so you may have to ""translate"" to the students, or play it again, but the trivia is interesting!Students tend to be amused when you point out to them that Ralph's voice changes from high to low frequently (thanks to his voice changing between the actual filming and additional dialogue recording).  Do beware: there is some brief rear and nearly-frontal nudity toward the end (when Jack's tribe whips a boy, and when Piggy talks to the few boys at Ralph's camp before they all go to confront Jack).

26108,ANCNEU3MD7RR,0780022084,FizzWiz,"[12, 15]","This film is truly a masterpiece!  Unless you're so up on your research, or unless you watched the extra stuff on the DVD, you'd have no idea that it was probably the first big picture which used a zoom lens!  Many of the camera shots were extremely complicated since the producers had to invent and tinker around until they could make temporary dolly mechanisms with proper tracks that worked for their sets in Puerto Rico.  Dialogue had to be done separately almost every time sinc eethe soun of the sea was so loud and since our video technolgoy was not so advanced.  (I don't know of advanced technology can even block the sound of the sea out.)  Long, hot hours for all 1st time actors and film people- most people involved in the film didn't realize at the time that the film was risky- limited time slot- all the students hasd to miss 1 month of school, not a day more, and summer vacation.Another interesting factoid is that this film for the Premier release had the sound all backwards, and it was fixed and played correctly all on time in 1.5 hours.  A police escort was provided to have the reel shipped to a UK theater.The DVD has a ""movie version"" where Golding himself reads an abridged version of his book while the entire movie plays.  There's also another ""movie version"" where directors and other staff make various comments on the movie.  Listening to the readings is probably good enough for ""cliff notes"" though I would not recommend ever readign only the cliff notes or just watching the video.  The book is too good to just read the cliff notes only, and that accentuates the video only more.  One thing to noe though is that Golding's readings do not always match up with what is being shown in the movie itself.In this original version, the pig does not talk because they had to remove many scenes.  Most of the scenes removed were due to the film being too long, but the pig talking portion may've been removed because it may have been too hard for people to handle at the time.  Even now, the movie's content is questionable for a rating because it's young male children living as savages, and sometimes there are captures with very little clothes.  You never see the front when someone is totally undressed, but there may be a quick flash or two or things that you can't really see distinctly.  This movie is definitely NOT sexual, but if you are looking for a clean, pure movie, non-realistic movie, or if you are vegetarian, this is probably not a good movie for you to watch.This version of the movie is very different than the 1990 version, as 1990 is in color, and this version is more raw and more real like Survivor minus all the hype and silliness.  I don't remember if Piggy's real name is even mentioned in the book or the 1990 version, but it's definitely not in this version.  Most people would say this version is critically much better than the 1990 version as the 1990 version strips away the fact that about half of the boys are from a choir school.  American actors will tend to act different than actors from various countries with a UK background, and since the book was written from a UK perspective, in this sense, the 1990 movie loses that degree of originality from the book.  There have been other ""versions"" of the movie, and one mentioned in the extra stuff on this DVD that was so offkilter that they wouldn't even name it ""Lord of the Flies.""  This particular version mentioned even had girls in it and a very happy ending.  This is a movie of true value, substance, and realism.",5,Don't Let the Pig Speak to You!

26110,AC4Z26E60FBEM,0780022084,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[8, 8]","The original 1963 British version of ""Lord of the Flies"" is a must see movie. I remember seeing it when I was a teenager and being moved by it. Recently, I've been watching movies with my 15 year old son, and we trade off choosing movies. He chose Iron Man 2: I chose ""Lord of the Flies."" It clearly affected and upset him. He kept thinking how stupid and terrible it was the way things turned out.The movie is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel and is better than the later American version. It's important that those who become savages are English choirboys. The contrast between the height of civilization (English choirboys in post World War II England) and the depths of savagery to which they descend is all-important. The boys they chose to play Ralph and Piggy, in particular, were excellent choices.It's amazing how the movie portrays the sinful nature of man and how, step by step, humans can descend from an orderly and peaceful civilization to a depraved inhumanity. The process begins by dehumanizing Piggy by making fun of him because of his name, his weight, his asthma, and his intellect. It's no wonder that junior high is like Hell on earth for many people and is a somewhat civilized version of Lord of the Flies!Jack's treatment of Piggy is especially symbolic of the way our sinfulness and savagery are shown. It all starts with little moments of selfishness and pride, but it doesn't take long for matters to become worse. Jack is not content to be subordinate to anyone, and so he eventually challenges the rightful (and better) chief, Ralph. This act of rebellion eventually leads to an all-out rebellion by almost all of the children against Ralph. It should remind us that acts of murder and hate begin with smaller acts of pride, jealousy, and bullying.The Lord of the Flies is a parable of the sinfulness of man and the veneer of civilization that sometimes only thinly masks our underlying evil. It powerfully communicates this truth without in any way being ""preachy."" It also leaves one with an overwhelming emotional feeling of the importance of the movie's truth. In other words, it's not merely a cerebral film but one that addresses the whole person.Modern viewers may be put off by the black and white color and the relatively slow speed of the movie. But these things only accentuate the crescendo of horror that slowly emerges and which happens without a soundtrack or rapid scene changes to do the thinking and feeling for us or keep us entertained. The film is riveting the whole way through without these things.In summary, the original ""Lord of the Flies"" qualifies, in my mind, as a classic film that merits watching by all who are old enough to deal with the intensity of the themes and scenes.",5,A Rare Movie That's as Good as the Book!,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,2745,"['original', '1963', 'British', 'version', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'being', 'moved', 'Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', '15', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'trade', 'off', 'choosing', 'movies', 'chose', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'chose', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'clearly', 'affected', 'upset', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'stupid', 'terrible', 'was', 'way', 'things', 'turned', 'out.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'better', 'later', 'American', 'version', 'important', 'who', 'become', 'savages', 'are', 'English', 'choirboys', 'contrast', 'height', 'civilization', 'English', 'choirboys', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'depths', 'savagery', 'descend', 'all-important', 'boys', 'chose', 'play', 'Ralph', 'Piggy', 'particular', 'were', 'excellent', 'choices.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'movie', 'sinful', 'nature', 'man', 'how', 'step', 'step', 'humans', 'can', 'descend', 'orderly', 'peaceful', 'civilization', 'depraved', 'inhumanity', 'process', 'dehumanizing', 'Piggy', 'making', 'fun', 'name', 'weight', 'asthma', 'intellect', 'wonder', 'junior', 'high', 'Hell', 'earth', 'many', 'people', 'somewhat', 'civilized', 'version', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Jack', 'treatment', 'Piggy', 'especially', 'symbolic', 'way', 'sinfulness', 'savagery', 'are', 'shown', 'little', 'moments', 'selfishness', 'pride', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'matters', 'become', 'worse', 'Jack', 'not', 'content', 'be', 'subordinate', 'anyone', 'so', 'eventually', 'rightful', 'better', 'chief', 'Ralph', 'act', 'rebellion', 'eventually', 'all-out', 'rebellion', 'almost', 'children', 'Ralph', 'should', 'remind', 'murder', 'hate', 'begin', 'smaller', 'acts', 'pride', 'jealousy', 'bullying.The', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'parable', 'sinfulness', 'man', 'veneer', 'civilization', 'only', 'thinly', 'underlying', 'evil', 'powerfully', 'truth', 'way', 'being', 'preachy', 'also', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'importance', 'movie', 'truth', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'merely', 'cerebral', 'film', 'one', 'whole', 'person.Modern', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'relatively', 'slow', 'speed', 'movie', 'things', 'only', 'accentuate', 'crescendo', 'horror', 'slowly', 'emerges', 'soundtrack', 'rapid', 'scene', 'changes', 'do', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'keep', 'entertained', 'film', 'riveting', 'whole', 'way', 'things.In', 'summary', 'original', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'qualifies', 'mind', 'classic', 'film', 'merits', 'watching', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'deal', 'intensity', 'themes', 'scenes']",N/A
26111,A2BVCT2MPS6LHI,0780022084,Huge Viking,"[10, 12]","We were handed paperback copies of Sir William Golding's novel in my seventh grade class back in 1973, and it was not until three years later when I saw the 1963 movie. The plot was about thirty or so British schoolboys, ages 6 to 13, whose plane crashes in the South Pacific Ocean and were the only survivors. They came ashore on a small uncharted, uninhabited tropical island where survival and the hopes of being rescued took precedence. While the pilot perished in the crash, there were no other adults and the boys were left to fend for themselves.The task was left to two of the oldest boys, Ralph and Jack. Ralph did his best to keep order with the younger boys where survival was the key by building shelters and gathering food. They would also build a fire as a signal to alert any passing ship or plane. While exploring the island and walking along the surf, Ralph and a fat, nearsighted boy, suffering from asthma, named Piggy stumbled upon a conch washed up on the shore. To Ralph the conch was an important symbol that whoever held onto it had the power to speak.During their isolation on the island, the boys managed to get along until Jack, a choirboy who initially proclaimed that the British people were the most civilized on earth, wanted to have fun and hunt since the island was inhabited by wild pigs. This led to a falling out between him and Ralph, and two separate factions ensued. Jack's group were mainly other choirboys who split away from the main group, settling on one part of the island where they would engage in savagery with painted faces and long hair. Aside from Piggy, Ralph's group included a boy named Simon, two twins named Sam'n'Eric and some of the smaller boys that were called ""littleuns"".The longer the two groups remained, hostilities between them grew more and more.Since no adults were present, one fear they faced was that of ""the Beast"". Jack's group was determined to hunt down the beast, and the nightly rituals was dancing around the fire and chanting, ""Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!""The trauma was that of a weak Simon who happened to stumble upon one of these rituals and was killed by Jack's group. His bloodied body thrown into the sea. The traumas continued as Jack's attention turned toward Ralph's group. The need for Piggy's spectacles to start fires was one thing and finishing off Ralph was another. Piggy would later be killed by a boulder falling on top of him and the conch smashed into worthless pieces. Sam'n'Eric would be apprehended and forced into Jack's group. This led to the littleuns abandoning Ralph as well.Ralph, now alone, was in fear for his own life. Jack's goal now was to hunt him down and kill him, even if it meant smoking him out by burning the entire island. While Jack and his group were in pursuit, Ralph ran as fast as he could until he stumbled on the beach and would look up at a naval officer who happened to come ashore with a rescue party.The plot in the film came very close to that of the novel. There was a remake of ""Lord of the Flies"" in 1990 that, to me, did not make any impression. The plot was altered where American boys from a military school faced similar situations.

A bunchof kids evacuated from England during the Second World War regress tothe worst imaginable savage state. They recreate all evils. They recreate superstitions. They recreate killing as a way to cope with their fear of the night. They recreate killing for the sake of their own unity and their own belief in the possibility to survive. The blood of their victims becomes the rite of their sanity. Modern men cannot any more go back to any kind of primitive state without losing their culture, their civilisation, their humanity. They go back to animaldom. The most frightening element is that any one who speaks loud and strong is able to unify a pack of human animals behind him, on the basis of their frustration. It is a clear lesson about our society. We live with wolves among us. Economic wolves who are ready to devour us to increase their power and their fortune. Moral and political wolves who are ready to kill those that are considered as non-social to get popular support and votes. Even cultural wolves who are ready to destroy any sanity in order to become stars and gurus. Man is a sectarian animal. That is what this film tells us.

I can easily say that I was one of the 20% who didn't find the book dumb and completely boring. I actually understood most of the hidden meanings (half through the help of spark notes)!  I enjoyed the story, even though it was incredibly sad and horrifying. I was eager to check out both movie versions, and I bought both. I tried the modern retelling version by Harry Hook, and thought that it was okay, but nowhere near like the book. Then I watched this version, and immediately was drawn. It liked how simply everything was done. It almost seemed like there could have not been a script and half of the dialogue was just the kids talking like normal. As not ""mainstream"" as this is, it had an amazing effect on the movie and really mirrored how the books style of dialogue was written. The death scenes of Simon and Piggy were not done distastefully, as they were in Harry Hook's version, and left most of the gore up to how the audience perceived it.

It is so profound that it makes one wonder about not what we are like but what we are REALLY like.In the story, young, English schoolboys are castaways stranded on an island with little hope of being rescued or even detected. They form their own microcosm of a government so as to establish an organized, daily routine that will enable them to hunt, gather, and shelter themselves in order to withstand the harshest elements of Mother Nature.At the start, they are, again, English schoolboys who are well-mannered and civilized. However, as the days pass, they lose their capacity to maintain any stable, social order as the ""warrior within"" that helps them to hunt down and kill wild animals for food, thus survival, becomes the haunting, albeit primal, emotion of savage paranoia that causes them to hunt down their own kind.Two programs come to mind. One is Survivor, because of the island setting (The movie was shot in Puerto Rico), and the other is the Twilight Zone classic The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street, because there was a perception that in the island was a beast out there that the boys would have to either appease or kill.Quite frightening is that what might be described as a Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde metamorphosis as one sees the breakdowns in Lord of the Flies is a character devolution that would be so gradual and so subtle that it would be difficult for many to see the perils that would lie ahead.A great classic is this movie, a forthcoming of a psychological case study that has often been shunned and ignored by many industrialized societies that choose to deny that youngsters are not necessarily the so-called sweet, little angels that they have been stereotyped. Truly, this was a bold step to possibly suggest that, no matter our background or social status, there is that beast within us that must be both acknowledged and contained and that to not be so frank can lead to destruction, both individually and societally.",5,The Survivors Are Due on Maple Street,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2078,"['1963', 'version', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'very', 'interesting', 'adaptation', 'savagery', 'so', 'profound', 'one', 'wonder', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'REALLY', 'story', 'young', 'English', 'schoolboys', 'are', 'castaways', 'stranded', 'island', 'little', 'hope', 'being', 'rescued', 'even', 'detected', 'form', 'own', 'microcosm', 'government', 'so', 'establish', 'organized', 'daily', 'routine', 'will', 'enable', 'hunt', 'gather', 'shelter', 'order', 'withstand', 'harshest', 'elements', 'Mother', 'Nature.At', 'start', 'are', 'again', 'English', 'schoolboys', 'who', 'are', 'well-mannered', 'civilized', 'However', 'days', 'pass', 'lose', 'capacity', 'maintain', 'stable', 'social', 'order', 'warrior', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'wild', 'animals', 'food', 'thus', 'survival', 'haunting', 'primal', 'emotion', 'savage', 'paranoia', 'hunt', 'down', 'own', 'kind.Two', 'programs', 'come', 'mind', 'One', 'Survivor', 'island', 'setting', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'other', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'classic', 'Monsters', 'Are', 'Due', 'Maple', 'Street', 'was', 'perception', 'island', 'was', 'beast', 'there', 'boys', 'would', 'have', 'appease', 'kill.Quite', 'frightening', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'metamorphosis', 'one', 'breakdowns', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'character', 'devolution', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'gradual', 'so', 'subtle', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'many', 'see', 'perils', 'would', 'lie', 'ahead.A', 'great', 'classic', 'movie', 'forthcoming', 'psychological', 'case', 'study', 'often', 'been', 'shunned', 'ignored', 'many', 'industrialized', 'societies', 'choose', 'deny', 'youngsters', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'so-called', 'sweet', 'little', 'angels', 'have', 'been', 'stereotyped', 'Truly', 'was', 'bold', 'step', 'possibly', 'suggest', 'matter', 'background', 'social', 'status', 'beast', 'must', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'contained', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'frank', 'can', 'lead', 'destruction', 'individually', 'societally']",N/A

From the first time you see each of the principals and hear them speak, you want to nod.  When the choir first arrives, singing a Kyrie that slowly fades in and ends in a trumpet fanfare as they reach the other boys, it gives you chills.  Lord have Mercy, indeed, those who know what's coming will think.  We're on the right track.The film is remarkably faithful to the story, including many of the little moments that subtly define the characters.  The buildup is just right, including Ralph's increasing desperation as he tries to hold the boys together and the gradual change in Jack.  When the most horrendous moment of the story arrives - I don't want to give it away but those who read the book will know what I mean - it's almost unbearable to watch.  There's no merciful tact here to let viewers off the hook.  You're forced to deal with exactly what's happening and the irony of who, out of all the boys, it's happening to.I will note, though, that Simon's notorious interview with the title character (a scene that admittedly must give directors everywhere nightmares at the mere thought of trying to film it) is not heard, which might leave you a little puzzled and missing an important part of the story if you haven't read it.

26123,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780022084,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","The 1963 version of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was made on an island off of Puerto Rico by director Peter Brook with a cast made up on the sons of English parents that could be found on the island and in the United States.  Only one of the children playing a major character, James Aubrey, who played Ralph, ever made another movie (although Nicholas Hammond, who played Robert, would have a real career in films and television).  This becomes a key factor in the film because we are not dealing with child actors, which usually works for the film, but not always.  But the more telling factor is that this film is only 92 minutes long, which meant some key elements from William Golding's celebrated novel are omitted.  Ultimately, your feelings for this film are going to depend on your familiarity with the novel.Brooks creates an effective prologue consisting of a series of stills that set up the key elements of the situation: a boys school, a war, an evacuation, and a plane going down near enough to an island for a group of boys to survive.  They find themselves on the island without any adults.  Ralph (James Aubrey) argues that there have to be rules, while Jack (Tom Chapin), the leader of the choir (he can hit high C) thinks he should be in charge.  If Ralph represents civilization while Jack is hearing the call of the wild, then it is Piggy (Hugh Edwards) who represents human intelligence.  But in the inevitable shift in power that goes from Ralph to Jack as the children devolve into savages, it is Piggy who becomes the pivotal victim.What is sacrificed in the film are the two characters who occupy the next level of significance in the novel, Roger (Roger Elwin) and Simon (Tom Gaman), and while that choice is understandable it is what keeps this from being a great adaptation.  Still, you cannot fault Brook for reducing the novel to the pivotal triad and the essence of Golding's novel is here if not the depth and rich symbolism.  But even as we marvel at the performances that Brook coaxes from his young actors, and the cinematography by Tom Hollyman (who had been a still photographer before this film), we really do have to remember that it is 1963 and the idea of depicting the horrors of this novel on the screen was a risky endeavor.  The fact that the novel is allegorical (i.e., Brooks is probably right in claiming on the basis of his filming experience that in the real world the boys would not have lasted a week) would not be enough to temper the reactions of audiences to little boys killing one another in the wild.This Criterion Collection edition has the usually goodies, although instead of a scholarly commentary track this time it consists of reminiscences by Brook, producer Lewis Allen, director of photography Tom Hollyman and cameraman/editor Gerald Feil.  As such tracks go it is certainly above average, but I have to admit that I enjoy the academic approach usually found on Criterion's DVDs.  There are also excerpts from the novel read by Golding that are interesting, although obviously not insightful (the excerpts are keyed to the same scenes in the movie).  There is also a clip from Gerald Feil's documentary &quot;The Empty Space&quot; showing Brook's method of creating theater, a production scrapbook, outtakes, home movies, a deleted scene, and the original theatrical trailer",4,Peter Brook's 1963 version of William Golding's novel,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,3345,"['1963', 'version', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'island', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'director', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'cast', 'made', 'up', 'sons', 'English', 'parents', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'island', 'United', 'States', 'Only', 'one', 'children', 'playing', 'major', 'character', 'James', 'Aubrey', 'who', 'played', 'Ralph', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'Nicholas', 'Hammond', 'who', 'played', 'Robert', 'would', 'have', 'real', 'career', 'films', 'television', 'key', 'factor', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'dealing', 'child', 'actors', 'usually', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'more', 'telling', 'factor', 'film', 'only', '92', 'minutes', 'long', 'meant', 'key', 'elements', 'William', 'Golding', 'celebrated', 'novel', 'are', 'omitted', 'Ultimately', 'feelings', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'depend', 'familiarity', 'novel.Brooks', 'effective', 'prologue', 'consisting', 'series', 'stills', 'set', 'up', 'key', 'elements', 'situation', 'boys', 'school', 'war', 'evacuation', 'plane', 'going', 'down', 'near', 'enough', 'island', 'group', 'boys', 'survive', 'find', 'island', 'adults', 'Ralph', 'James', 'Aubrey', 'have', 'be', 'rules', 'Jack', 'Tom', 'Chapin', 'leader', 'choir', 'can', 'hit', 'high', 'C', 'should', 'be', 'charge', 'Ralph', 'civilization', 'Jack', 'hearing', 'call', 'wild', 'then', 'Piggy', 'Hugh', 'Edwards', 'who', 'human', 'intelligence', 'inevitable', 'shift', 'power', 'Ralph', 'Jack', 'children', 'devolve', 'savages', 'Piggy', 'who', 'pivotal', 'victim.What', 'sacrificed', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'occupy', 'next', 'level', 'significance', 'novel', 'Roger', 'Roger', 'Elwin', 'Simon', 'Tom', 'Gaman', 'choice', 'understandable', 'what', 'being', 'great', 'adaptation', 'Still', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'Brook', 'reducing', 'novel', 'pivotal', 'triad', 'essence', 'Golding', 'novel', 'here', 'not', 'depth', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'even', 'marvel', 'performances', 'Brook', 'coaxes', 'young', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'Tom', 'Hollyman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'still', 'photographer', 'film', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'remember', '1963', 'idea', 'depicting', 'horrors', 'novel', 'screen', 'was', 'risky', 'endeavor', 'fact', 'novel', 'allegorical', 'i.e.', 'Brooks', 'probably', 'right', 'claiming', 'basis', 'filming', 'experience', 'real', 'world', 'boys', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'lasted', 'week', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'temper', 'reactions', 'audiences', 'little', 'boys', 'killing', 'one', 'wild.This', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'edition', 'usually', 'goodies', 'instead', 'scholarly', 'commentary', 'track', 'time', 'reminiscences', 'Brook', 'producer', 'Lewis', 'Allen', 'director', 'photography', 'Tom', 'Hollyman', 'cameraman/editor', 'Gerald', 'Feil', 'such', 'tracks', 'go', 'certainly', 'above', 'average', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'academic', 'approach', 'usually', 'found', 'Criterion', 'DVDs', 'are', 'also', 'excerpts', 'novel', 'read', 'Golding', 'are', 'interesting', 'obviously', 'not', 'insightful', 'excerpts', 'are', 'keyed', 'same', 'scenes', 'movie', 'also', 'clip', 'Gerald', 'Feil', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Empty', 'Space', 'quot', 'showing', 'Brook', 'method', 'creating', 'theater', 'production', 'scrapbook', 'outtakes', 'home', 'movies', 'deleted', 'scene', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

It's a brilliant film that must be seen by everyone who has read the book for school since it is recommended reading and under 200 hundred pages for the small minded readers of today that can't handle 200 hundred plus pages. It's adapted brilliantly and the absence of a score really sets the mood because music isn't necessary for this version. This is the definitive version of the book to be filmed and won't ever be equaled.This is perhaps my favourite mainstream novel of all time and the stark black and white cinematography shows that colour wouldn't be useful for this dark and bleak tale.If you've read the book, and haven't seen the film with genuine natural performances from the boys then do yourself a favour and snag it when it's released.""Kill the pig!

26128,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,0780022084,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[20, 24]","First things first: William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ is one of the best novels I've ever read.  It is suspenseful, terrifying, disturbing, brilliantly symbolistic, and deeply moving--all at the same time.  The book gets 5/5 stars, no question about it.Now for the 1963 movie: Well, for the most part the acting is decent (Ralph and Simon are especially good) and the scenery depicts images from the book well.  (I love the scene with the choir boys walking on the beach in their costumes!)  Unfortunately, this movie is just too rushed in its storytelling and too short to have the same lasting effect as the book.  The movie kind of zipped through the first half of the book within 20 minutes, and the characters weren't given enough solo screen time, so their personalities don't really shine like they did in the book.  (For example, Roger is taken as a very minor character except when he suddenly killed Piggy, so I didn't really feel that he was representing all that is evil in human nature.)I also never really felt the rivalry building up between Jack and Ralph in the movie, since there weren't really enough examples of it.  (For example: Before Jack became a savage, there was only the one scene in which Jack argues with Ralph and says ""Bollocks to the rules!""  He then became a savage soon after.  I would have liked to see more arguments between Jack and Ralph before Jack went ahead in becoming a savage.)And the name ""Lord of the Flies"" is never explained or even mentioned during the entire film (except when it is displayed during the opening and closing credits, of course).  This is probably one of the most important examples of symbolism in the entire book!Finally there's the ending, which doesn't include the scene painted by the last two paragraphs.  These lines are, IMHO, the most powerful in the book.  I was expecting a scene to go with these lines, one that would really hit home.  Instead the movie just ends when the officer appears.I suppose I'll give the movie 3 out of 5.",3,Hmmm.....,1026950400,"07 18, 2002",2002,2012,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'William', 'Golding', '_Lord', 'Flies_', 'one', 'best', 'novels', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'suspenseful', 'terrifying', 'disturbing', 'brilliantly', 'symbolistic', 'deeply', 'moving', 'same', 'time', 'book', '5/5', 'stars', 'question', 'it.Now', '1963', 'movie', 'Well', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'decent', 'Ralph', 'Simon', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'scenery', 'images', 'book', 'well', 'love', 'scene', 'choir', 'walking', 'beach', 'costumes', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'rushed', 'storytelling', 'too', 'short', 'have', 'same', 'lasting', 'effect', 'book', 'movie', 'kind', 'zipped', 'first', 'half', 'book', '20', 'minutes', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'solo', 'screen', 'time', 'personalities', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'shine', 'did', 'book', 'example', 'Roger', 'taken', 'very', 'minor', 'character', 'when', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'Piggy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'was', 'representing', 'evil', 'human', 'nature', 'also', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'rivalry', 'building', 'up', 'Jack', 'Ralph', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'examples', 'example', 'Jack', 'became', 'savage', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Ralph', 'Bollocks', 'rules', 'then', 'became', 'savage', 'soon', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'arguments', 'Jack', 'Ralph', 'Jack', 'went', 'ahead', 'becoming', 'savage', 'name', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'never', 'explained', 'even', 'mentioned', 'entire', 'film', 'when', 'displayed', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'course', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'examples', 'symbolism', 'entire', 'book', 'Finally', 'ending', ""n't"", 'include', 'scene', 'painted', 'last', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'lines', 'are', 'IMHO', 'most', 'powerful', 'book', 'was', 'expecting', 'scene', 'go', 'lines', 'one', 'would', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'Instead', 'movie', 'just', 'when', 'officer', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', '3', '5']",N/A

Oleson,"[1, 1]","Shot in 1961 and based on William Golding's classic novel, ""Lord Of The Flies"" tells the tale of 30 young boys marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific.  British director Peter Brook had trouble getting the movie made but eventually found financial support from a young American, Lewis Allen.  Allen found a few investors and the film was made on a shoe string budget of about $250K.  Shot on a small island off the coast of Puerto Rico, the filmmakers used a combination of American and British first time actors, most of whom never acted again.The financial constraints can be seen early on as we only see a plane floating on the ocean, the result of an unexplained crash.  Once you get past the fact that only these choirboys survived intact on the beach with no discernable injuries or even dirty uniforms, the film is excellent.  Brook emphasizes the angelic faces of the lads who range in age from about 7 to 11.  At first, the boys show their British ""stiff upper lip"" and organize and even elect a leader.  Ralph (James Aubrey) is elected.  He is one of the older boys and his only competitor was Jack (Tom Chapin) who we see early on, has his own followers.Ralph is focused on being rescued.  Jack's bravado turns to bulling and eventually the two butt heads.  Piggy (Hugh Edwards) is another primary character and ally of Ralph.  While Jack and his followers strike out to hunt the wild pigs on the island, they discover what they believe to be a ""beast.""  Their focus is survival and protection.  Ralph and his tribe are intent on maintaining a large fire which would be seen by rescue planes.  One of Jack's jobs was to maintain the fire.  When he decides to go hunting the fire goes out, and sure enough a plane passes over.  This leads to an eventual split between the two factions.Jack and his now ""warriors"" paint their faces and devolve into uncivilized killers.  True to Golding's novel, Brook delivers an agonizing truth of what happens to humans, even young innocents, when survival is at stake.  It truly does become survival of the fittest as Darwin suggested.The Criterion Blu ray version comes in the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution.  Here is the text Criterion includes in an informative 28 page booklet that comes with the package:""Supervised by cameraman and editor Gerald Feil, this new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from a 35mm composite fine grain and a 35mm duplicate negative; the restoration was then performed in 2K resolution. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, and jitter were manually removed using using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise reduction, and flicker.Transfer supervisors: Gerald Feil, Lee Kline.Colorist: Lee Kline/Criterion, New York.""In a word the transfer is beautiful.  The black and white film shows excellent variations between the two.  Greys of all shadings are well presented.  The close ups of the boys faces are detailed.  I could see no dirt, scratches or other abnormalities.  Night time shots are clear and well defined.  There was no jitter that I saw.  A remarkable restoration.  The audio is excellent as well.  Criterion has only one option, a lossless mono track but it is well rendered over 2 channels.  There are no dropouts.  No noise or any other issues.

In elementary school we had to regularly practice hiding under the desks to avoid the flying glass from the smashed windows.  This was the background of the novel and the film.  You younger people have no idea of what it was like.  I never read the novel or saw the remake.  My memory of a film which I saw fifty years ago is not all that great.  I do remember being frightened.  In those days one could still make a film out of the book without having the boys wear shorts and without having a token black boy who wasn't in the book (I'm really gonna catch it for that remark!)  This was a very depressing film to watch.  100,000,000 people had been killed between 1914 and 1954 and Sir William was lecturing us about how very wicked we all were (well, he wasn't Sir William yet in those days, not yet given the Nobel Prize and all that).  The boys were all amateurs as actors, but it worked out just fine.  The stark black-and-white allowed the viewer to concentrate on the action without being distracted by the beauty of nature.  Nothing like this had ever been seen, it was unique.  It was brilliantly done, very powerful and gloomy.  I didn't feel guilty of anything as I left the theatre, although the message was that we were all devils and would soon blow ourselves up.  They didn't teach the book yet in the schools like they do now.  I do have a paperback, but it just sits there unread.  William Faulkner said, ""Mankind will not merely endure, mankind will triumph.""  Well, it's fifty years later and we're still here, so I guess he was right, although Sir William (Golding) was right in a way.",5,descent into savagery,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,1773,"['saw', '1963', 'version', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'threat', 'new', 'world', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'Saturday', 'was', 'spoiled', 'testing', 'air-raid', 'siren', 'elementary', 'school', 'had', 'regularly', 'practice', 'hiding', 'desks', 'avoid', 'flying', 'glass', 'smashed', 'windows', 'was', 'background', 'novel', 'film', 'younger', 'people', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'saw', 'remake', 'memory', 'film', 'saw', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'great', 'do', 'remember', 'being', 'frightened', 'days', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'make', 'film', 'book', 'having', 'boys', 'wear', 'shorts', 'having', 'token', 'black', 'boy', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', ""'m"", 'really', 'gon', 'catch', 'remark', 'was', 'very', 'depressing', 'film', 'watch', '100,000,000', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'killed', '1914', '1954', 'Sir', 'William', 'was', 'lecturing', 'how', 'very', 'wicked', 'were', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'Sir', 'William', 'yet', 'days', 'not', 'yet', 'given', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'boys', 'were', 'amateurs', 'actors', 'worked', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'stark', 'black-and-white', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'concentrate', 'action', 'being', 'distracted', 'beauty', 'nature', 'Nothing', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'was', 'unique', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'very', 'powerful', 'gloomy', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'anything', 'left', 'theatre', 'message', 'was', 'were', 'devils', 'would', 'soon', 'blow', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'teach', 'book', 'yet', 'schools', 'do', 'now', 'do', 'have', 'paperback', 'just', 'there', 'unread', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'said', 'Mankind', 'will', 'not', 'merely', 'endure', 'mankind', 'will', 'triumph', 'Well', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'still', 'here', 'guess', 'was', 'right', 'Sir', 'William', 'Golding', 'was', 'right', 'way']",N/A

It has been widely acknowledged as capturing the great depth and substance of the highly acclaimed book. Definitely one for your movie collection, to keep for years to come.The story is simple yet profound. An airplane with a group of schoolboys crash lands on a beautiful remote tropical island, with the only survivors not more than 10 or so years old, and some as young as 4 or 5. Nobody knows exactly where they are, so their chance of rescue whilst real, but not great. They have to find food, shelter, a level of organisation, and direction. Simple, or is it? What do young people really think about, away form their teachers and parents? How would they cope with such a situation? What kind of things can go wrong in such an environment? There are no TV viewer's voting system, no edited TV shows, just Nature and young, vibrant children. What do you think would happen in such a situation? Would they all behave, or would they fight each other? How would they cope with such simple things as feeding themselves, and organising their priorities? Would the older boys bully the younger, and what would they do to try to deal with this? You'll have to see the film for yourself to find out.The film touches on notions of religion, fear, superstition, government, science, knowledge, and tribalism- to mention just a few. Chance and accident play a large part in the development of the story.Golding wrote the book on which this movie is based, in one sense as a parody of the book &quot;the Coral Island&quot;, which describes a somewhat different set of outcomes as to what would transpire in such a situation. Interested viewers/readers might like to research the latter for alternative notions regarding human nature and co-operation.The film is to say the least, very well done. The characters are very true to the book (and life), the images and scenery exquisite, the film's direction simple on the surface, but delicately contrived.",5,Still the best 'survivor' story (1963 version).,990057600,"05 17, 2001",2001,2068,"['1963', 'version', 'Golding', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'through', 'flying', 'colours', 'been', 'widely', 'acknowledged', 'capturing', 'great', 'depth', 'substance', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'book', 'Definitely', 'one', 'movie', 'collection', 'keep', 'years', 'come.The', 'story', 'simple', 'yet', 'profound', 'airplane', 'group', 'schoolboys', 'crash', 'lands', 'beautiful', 'remote', 'tropical', 'island', 'only', 'survivors', 'not', 'more', '10', 'so', 'years', 'old', 'as', 'young', '4', '5', 'Nobody', 'exactly', 'where', 'are', 'chance', 'rescue', 'whilst', 'real', 'not', 'great', 'have', 'find', 'food', 'shelter', 'level', 'organisation', 'direction', 'Simple', 'What', 'do', 'young', 'people', 'really', 'think', 'away', 'form', 'teachers', 'parents', 'How', 'would', 'cope', 'such', 'situation', 'What', 'kind', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'such', 'environment', 'are', 'TV', 'viewer', 'voting', 'system', 'edited', 'TV', 'shows', 'just', 'Nature', 'young', 'vibrant', 'children', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'happen', 'such', 'situation', 'behave', 'would', 'fight', 'other', 'How', 'would', 'cope', 'such', 'simple', 'things', 'feeding', 'organising', 'priorities', 'Would', 'older', 'boys', 'bully', 'younger', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'try', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'film', 'find', 'out.The', 'film', 'touches', 'notions', 'religion', 'fear', 'superstition', 'government', 'science', 'knowledge', 'tribalism-', 'mention', 'just', 'few', 'Chance', 'accident', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'development', 'story.Golding', 'wrote', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'one', 'sense', 'parody', 'book', 'quot', 'Coral', 'Island', 'quot', 'somewhat', 'different', 'set', 'outcomes', 'what', 'would', 'transpire', 'such', 'situation', 'Interested', 'viewers/readers', 'might', 'like', 'research', 'latter', 'alternative', 'notions', 'regarding', 'human', 'nature', 'co-operation.The', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'life', 'images', 'scenery', 'exquisite', 'film', 'direction', 'simple', 'surface', 'delicately', 'contrived']",N/A

To have rules and agree, or to hurt and kill""Then above quote said by one of the main characters is actually the crux of this extremely interesting movie based on the 1954 novel of the same name by William Golding.The story is actually a simple one.  A plane crashes on an uninhabited island.  The survivors are a group of privileged preadolescent British schoolboys including some choirboys.  They must learn to survive on this island until they are rescued.We get to see what happens as the boys adapt to their new environment.  We also get to observe how the veneer of civilization slowly erodes from them.  We get to see how their primitive instincts overtakes the majority of them and how their moral compasses seem to get lost.This is not just a tale of lost innocence.  It's a case study of the behaviour of kids in the wilderness.This movie was not filmed in a studio somewhere but the director (Peter Brook) and his young cast of school kids really were on a desert island together.  (Filming took place entirely in Puerto Rico and on the island of Vieques)The actors were young amateur actors, few of whom ever acted again.For those that have read the novel, this film closely follows the trajectory of the book.This movie was filmed in black and white, adding yet another dimension to it.  This particular disc has a newly, restored digital film transfer.Finally, the DVD set (the Criterion Collection released in 2013) has a long list of excellent extras including audio recordings of William Golding reading from his novel ""Lord of the Flies,"" accompanied by the corresponding scenes from this film.  A booklet is also included which has a superb essay about this movie by a film critic and an excerpt from the director's autobiography.In conclusion, this is truly a unique movie that shows that even innocent schoolboys can be reduced to the level of...savages.(1963;  1 hr, 30 min;  black and white;  2 discs;  full screen;  14 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,"""Kill the pig!

26139,A31ACI0E88ORDE,0780022084,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","I've already reviewed the book, and this is so faithful (Piggy's story of Camberley notwithstanding) that it doesn't have a screenplay credit.  That being the case, I won't review the plot or characters, just the cinematic aspects of it.********THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS********First, the score is EXCELLENT.  I especially like the contrast between the angelic-sounding &#34;Kyrie eleison&#34; and the non-melodic drumming echoing it that sounds so primitive and pagan.  This is especially effective at the beginning, which is told entirely by still photographs, no moving pictures or scripted dialogue--perfect for the prologue of a film adaptation of a book that begins (and rightly so) on the island, so that we have a minimum of context.Second, this goes to show that sometimes things are more dramatic the LESS we see of them.  For example, we don't see Simon or Piggy being killed--and I think Piggy's death in particular would fall flat if they tried to show it on-screen (unless they subjected the poor child actor to an actual bludgeoning!).  Likewise, when Ralph is being hunted at the end, we hear the savages hunting him but we never see them.  They could be anywhere.  They are the manifestation of the Beast, which is everywhere.  Better still, that's in perfect keeping with the point of the story, because the whole reason the boys are afraid of the Beast is because they don't actually SEE it, or know anything about it!The only thing I don't like about this film is that context is lost because we're not made to understand in no uncertain terms the nature of the Beast--the pig's head on the stake doesn't talk, and it isn't as clear as it could be that Ralph is crying in despair, not relief, at seeing the British naval officers (what's the difference between them, fighting a war that caused them to be on this island in the first place, and the savages who just tried to kill him?).  Ordinarily I like it when a movie knows how to use silence well (something lost in many films in this day and age), but I fear something is lost thereby.********END SPOILERS********Other than that, I consider this to be THE adaptation of the novel--there is no other.  I don't say the American remake has nothing to offer (I liked how it opened with the boys struggling to stay above water, and I liked the score for that as well), but not only was it inferior, it was necessarily inferior--indeed, it was unnecessary, as unnecessary as if they'd made it a book instead of a movie.So check out this film and watch it--but have the book handy.God bless you all.",5,THE adaptation of the novel,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,2571,"[""'ve"", 'already', 'reviewed', 'book', 'so', 'faithful', 'Piggy', 'story', 'Camberley', 'notwithstanding', ""n't"", 'have', 'screenplay', 'credit', 'being', 'case', 'wo', ""n't"", 'review', 'plot', 'characters', 'just', 'cinematic', 'aspects', '********THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS********First', 'score', 'EXCELLENT', 'especially', 'contrast', 'angelic-sounding', '34', 'Kyrie', 'eleison', '34', 'non-melodic', 'drumming', 'echoing', 'so', 'primitive', 'pagan', 'especially', 'effective', 'beginning', 'told', 'entirely', 'still', 'photographs', 'moving', 'pictures', 'scripted', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'prologue', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'rightly', 'so', 'island', 'have', 'minimum', 'context.Second', 'show', 'sometimes', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'dramatic', 'LESS', 'see', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Simon', 'Piggy', 'being', 'killed', 'think', 'Piggy', 'death', 'particular', 'would', 'fall', 'flat', 'tried', 'show', 'on-screen', 'subjected', 'poor', 'child', 'actor', 'actual', 'bludgeoning', 'Likewise', 'when', 'Ralph', 'being', 'hunted', 'end', 'hear', 'savages', 'hunting', 'never', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'are', 'manifestation', 'Beast', 'everywhere', 'Better', 'still', 'perfect', 'keeping', 'point', 'story', 'whole', 'reason', 'boys', 'are', 'afraid', 'Beast', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'SEE', 'know', 'anything', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'context', 'lost', ""'re"", 'not', 'made', 'understand', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'nature', 'Beast', 'pig', 'head', 'stake', ""n't"", 'talk', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'could', 'be', 'Ralph', 'crying', 'despair', 'not', 'relief', 'seeing', 'British', 'naval', 'officers', 'what', 'difference', 'fighting', 'war', 'caused', 'be', 'island', 'first', 'place', 'savages', 'who', 'just', 'tried', 'kill', 'Ordinarily', 'like', 'when', 'movie', 'how', 'use', 'silence', 'well', 'something', 'lost', 'many', 'films', 'day', 'age', 'fear', 'something', 'lost', 'thereby', '********END', 'SPOILERS********Other', 'consider', 'be', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'American', 'remake', 'nothing', 'offer', 'liked', 'how', 'opened', 'boys', 'struggling', 'stay', 'water', 'liked', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'inferior', 'was', 'necessarily', 'inferior', 'indeed', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'as', 'unnecessary', ""'d"", 'made', 'book', 'instead', 'movie.So', 'check', 'film', 'watch', 'have', 'book', 'handy.God', 'bless']",N/A
26140,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,0780022084,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 3]","""Lord of the Flies"" is Peter Brook's adaptation of the William Golding novel, a staple of high school English classes. The film is the first of two big-screen versions, this one in black and white. A color version was made in 1990, but the Brook version is definitive.A plane crashes near a deserted island and all the adults die. A group of English schoolboys, ages 10 to 12, survive and hope to be rescued. They establish a makeshift but initially workable government that soon degenerates into anarchy. Tribal strife occurs based on class differences and a power play ensues as the boys evolve from decent kids to savage survivalists.Director Brook strived for a documentary look and selected for his cast mostly British boys who had grown up with structure, parental guidance, and societal law to reflect the characters in Golding's novel. On location without parents, the boys loosened up. A lot of the action was improvised.The film metaphorically illustrates what happens when civilization breaks down and man's true nature is revealed. Because the boys are stranded in a tropical paradise, they have plenty to eat, fresh water, and a temperate climate, so the dissolution of morality is planted squarely on human flaws and frailty and the lack of moral leadership rather than solely on environment.The Blu-ray edition contains audio commentary by Peter Brook, audio recordings of William Golding reading from the novel, a 2008 interview with Brook, never-before-seen footage, and a booklet featuring a critical essay.",5,The Original Lost Boys,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1525,"['Lord', 'Flies', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'adaptation', 'William', 'Golding', 'novel', 'staple', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'classes', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'big-screen', 'versions', 'one', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'version', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'Brook', 'version', 'definitive.A', 'plane', 'crashes', 'deserted', 'island', 'adults', 'die', 'group', 'English', 'schoolboys', '10', '12', 'survive', 'hope', 'be', 'rescued', 'establish', 'makeshift', 'initially', 'workable', 'government', 'soon', 'anarchy', 'Tribal', 'strife', 'occurs', 'based', 'class', 'differences', 'power', 'play', 'boys', 'evolve', 'decent', 'kids', 'savage', 'survivalists.Director', 'Brook', 'strived', 'documentary', 'look', 'selected', 'cast', 'mostly', 'British', 'boys', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'structure', 'parental', 'guidance', 'societal', 'law', 'reflect', 'characters', 'Golding', 'novel', 'location', 'parents', 'boys', 'loosened', 'up', 'lot', 'action', 'was', 'improvised.The', 'film', 'metaphorically', 'what', 'when', 'civilization', 'breaks', 'down', 'man', 'true', 'nature', 'revealed', 'boys', 'are', 'stranded', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'have', 'plenty', 'eat', 'fresh', 'water', 'temperate', 'climate', 'dissolution', 'morality', 'planted', 'squarely', 'human', 'flaws', 'frailty', 'lack', 'moral', 'leadership', 'rather', 'solely', 'environment.The', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'audio', 'recordings', 'William', 'Golding', 'reading', 'novel', '2008', 'interview', 'Brook', 'never-before-seen', 'footage', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'critical', 'essay']",N/A

We've been brought up to hide from our natures, only to make us even more so just beneath the surface. We see this brutal and honest film and want to think it's just a story, but it's not. It's raw and scary. It's probably too adult for the average viewer. We can't withstand that long, hard stare into the mirror. It's a gritty art film.
