I own all six seasons of the show on DVD already and have loved the high-quality unedited versions. I have not had a chance to see these movies yet, so I am super excited to check them out! Such a great show with great writing! As far as what others are saying about costs; I do agree that Season Six was a disappointment as it was only 12 episodes and cost the same ($30+) as the other full seasons. At the time I was annoyed by the cost and the fact that I really wish they would have given us these movies than or at least some other special features. However, I am excited to see these movies and I am glad the pricing is under $20 for each half. So although I may sound like a hypocrite I do agree that DVD sets are way over priced... sometimes you just can't put a price on something so great like The Rockford Files!

I agree they should have all the movies together in one set and could have made it match the seasons. But, movie and music companies always leave something to be desired in how they release things so I am not gonna write a review of that. I am writing this in regards to the actual made for tv movies. I personally do not understand why everyone is talking so negatively about these movies. My personal opinion is that, anytime you add James Garner to the mix you're gonna get your money's worth. I am a collector of dvds so I am happy/proud to say that I can finally have these to complete the Rockford Collection. Although the actor is older, you don't get the feeling that they tried to underplay his age. They accept it, they broach the subject many times with humor, and all-in-all you get an actor playing his age as well as not losing any of the qualities that made the actor so memorable. there are the trademark one liners, though he does seem a bit more rough around the edges he is still the same old rockford we grew up with in the 70s and in reruns. The saddest part was that Rocky wasn't able to be in them. Anyone who is/was a fan of the show will feel as if they've lost a family member as well. The storylines are fine, and are excellent vehicles for the Rockford character. There are a few reunions (for us as well) as he is joined by Beth and Angel (throughought the course of the movies) too bad Isaac Hayes didn't show up though. That would have made it more complete. I would glady reccomend this set to anyone who has seen the series and loved it as I did. I'd support anything I can with Garner's name on it. He is a fine actor who simply made it look easy and natural. I really would have liked it released differently (one complete set) but that is a minor qualm. Just be grateful these made it to dvd. Many companies are always looking for what's new and hot and not necessarily for what is good. Garner never made a movie/series I didn't like. He was the type that could elevate the material to levels it was probably not meant to be at. Even though the set is not out yet (I have recently seen these episodes...recorded off the Hallmark channel) and will tell you you won't be disappointed if you buy these.",4,Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2356,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'review', 'not', 'company', 'out', 'dvd', 'manner', 'dvd', 'was', 'released', 'agree', 'should', 'have', 'movies', 'together', 'one', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'match', 'seasons', 'movie', 'music', 'companies', 'always', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'how', 'release', 'things', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'gon', 'write', 'review', 'am', 'writing', 'regards', 'actual', 'made', 'tv', 'movies', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'everyone', 'talking', 'so', 'negatively', 'movies', 'personal', 'opinion', 'anytime', 'add', 'James', 'Garner', 'mix', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'am', 'collector', 'dvds', 'am', 'happy/proud', 'say', 'can', 'finally', 'have', 'complete', 'Rockford', 'Collection', 'actor', 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'tried', 'underplay', 'age', 'accept', 'broach', 'subject', 'many', 'times', 'humor', 'all-in-all', 'get', 'actor', 'playing', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'losing', 'qualities', 'made', 'actor', 'so', 'memorable', 'are', 'trademark', 'one', 'liners', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'rough', 'edges', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'rockford', 'grew', 'up', '70s', 'reruns', 'saddest', 'part', 'was', 'Rocky', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'be', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'family', 'member', 'as', 'well', 'storylines', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'excellent', 'vehicles', 'Rockford', 'character', 'are', 'few', 'reunions', 'as', 'well', 'joined', 'Beth', 'Angel', 'throughought', 'course', 'movies', 'too', 'bad', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'complete', 'would', 'glady', 'reccomend', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'series', 'loved', 'did', ""'d"", 'support', 'anything', 'can', 'Garner', 'name', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'simply', 'made', 'look', 'easy', 'natural', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'released', 'differently', 'one', 'complete', 'set', 'minor', 'qualm', 'Just', 'be', 'grateful', 'made', 'dvd', 'Many', 'companies', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'what', 'new', 'hot', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'good', 'Garner', 'never', 'made', 'movie/series', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'type', 'could', 'elevate', 'material', 'levels', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Even', 'set', 'not', 'out', 'yet', 'have', 'recently', 'seen', 'episodes', 'recorded', 'off', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'will', 'tell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'buy']",The Rockford Files: Movie Collection - Volume 1

The portrayal of Jim Rockford by James Garner is a masterpiece of acting.""Rocky"" has died and Jimbo is on his own, except for his good friends Dennis Becker,Beth, and Angel.  Jim is kind of a loner, but he is dragged into life by his occupation and loyalty to friends.  When his dad is mentioned you can see the emotion from all the actors for fellow actor Noah Beery, Jr. come through their eyes and voice.  But Jim is still Jim.  The walk is a little more limping and slower, the reaction time is slowed, even the music is a little slower, but it is still the same old Jim Rockford. When he should be in someother line of work, and age is starting to take its effect, Jim is still in there, slugging it out for the little guy who never gets a break or justice.  The feel of the movies is the 1990's and you can see a little bit that Jim is a little out of touch with the cultural changes that took place over the last 15 years.

Still, I hope Universal releases those movies sometime soon.  I do have one minor complaint and that is the First Season, at least my copy, was done on two sided DVDs which requires better care.

1276425,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B002LFQIL2,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[37, 51]","I believe the original 1970's television series ""The Rockford Files"" was one of the finest drama series ever made.  This was largely on the strength of the performance of James Garner in the starring role, in addition to the fine scripts by people like Steven Cannell, David Chase and others. Garner NEVER put in a bad performance, something that few actors of even the most successfull series can say.  The stories, both those that had more comic aspects (such as those with the unforgettable character Angel, played by Stuart Margolin) or those with a more serious storyline always kept the attention of the audience and provided top entertainment.  Few other series can say this.HAVING SAID THIS, I am afraid that I can not wholeheartedly recommend the movies that made up the revival of the series in the 1990's.  These movies fell victim to the common problem of all revivals using a famous older star. Whether or not they are concious of it or not,  they are being paid a fortune, they have nothing to prove, they usually don't have the energy they had when they were young,  and they know that the show can not be made without them.  This almost inevitably has the actor ease up and it frequently seems that they are simply going through the motions. Unfortunately we see this syndrome in these movies. As fine an actor as Garner was in his glory days, by the time these movies came along, he simply was not the same man.  In addition, the nature of television had changed between the 1970's and 1990's.  The 1970's had directing oriented towards a ""natural"" feel regarding lighting, sets, camera angles and such.  In the 1990's there is something more of a ""surreal"" feeling in which rather unnatural lighting is used and the furnishing of the sets seems sterile compared to that of the earlier period, which I personally don't care for.  Also, because of changing taste, things like profanity and explicit talk about sex became more accepted and this is often used as an out for lazy writers who don't have to work hard in order to make more creative stories, relying simply on the decreasing shock value to hold the audience's attention.It is also sad to see fine supporting actors such as Joe Santos and Pat Finley (Jim's pal Dennis Becker and his wife, Peggy) who were so dynamic in the original series seemingly becoming aging relics. James Luisi, who was so good as Rockford's nemesis Lt. Chapman in the LAPD here appears as simply a goofy caricature.The bottom line is that these movies are yet another proof of Thomas Wolfe's immortal line ""You Can't Go Home Again"".",3,"Where Have You Gone, James Garner?",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,2582,"['believe', 'original', '1970', 'television', 'series', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'drama', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'largely', 'strength', 'performance', 'James', 'Garner', 'starring', 'role', 'addition', 'fine', 'scripts', 'people', 'Steven', 'Cannell', 'David', 'Chase', 'others', 'Garner', 'NEVER', 'put', 'bad', 'performance', 'something', 'few', 'actors', 'even', 'most', 'successfull', 'series', 'can', 'say', 'stories', 'had', 'more', 'comic', 'aspects', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'Angel', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Margolin', 'more', 'serious', 'storyline', 'always', 'kept', 'attention', 'audience', 'provided', 'top', 'entertainment', 'Few', 'other', 'series', 'can', 'say', 'this.HAVING', 'SAID', 'THIS', 'am', 'afraid', 'can', 'not', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'movies', 'made', 'up', 'revival', 'series', '1990', 'movies', 'fell', 'victim', 'common', 'problem', 'revivals', 'using', 'famous', 'older', 'star', 'not', 'are', 'concious', 'not', 'are', 'being', 'paid', 'fortune', 'have', 'nothing', 'prove', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'know', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'actor', 'ease', 'up', 'frequently', 'are', 'simply', 'going', 'motions', 'Unfortunately', 'see', 'syndrome', 'movies', 'fine', 'actor', 'Garner', 'was', 'glory', 'days', 'time', 'movies', 'came', 'along', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'man', 'addition', 'nature', 'television', 'had', 'changed', '1970', '1990', '1970', 'had', 'directing', 'oriented', 'natural', 'feel', 'regarding', 'lighting', 'sets', 'camera', 'angles', 'such', '1990', 'something', 'more', 'surreal', 'feeling', 'rather', 'unnatural', 'lighting', 'used', 'furnishing', 'sets', 'sterile', 'compared', 'earlier', 'period', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Also', 'changing', 'taste', 'things', 'profanity', 'explicit', 'talk', 'sex', 'became', 'more', 'accepted', 'often', 'used', 'lazy', 'writers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'creative', 'stories', 'relying', 'simply', 'decreasing', 'shock', 'value', 'hold', 'audience', 'attention.It', 'also', 'sad', 'see', 'fine', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Joe', 'Santos', 'Pat', 'Finley', 'Jim', 'pal', 'Dennis', 'Becker', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'dynamic', 'original', 'series', 'seemingly', 'becoming', 'aging', 'relics', 'James', 'Luisi', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Rockford', 'nemesis', 'Lt.', 'Chapman', 'LAPD', 'here', 'simply', 'goofy', 'caricature.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'movies', 'are', 'yet', 'proof', 'Thomas', 'Wolfe', 'immortal', 'line', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Home', 'Again']",The Rockford Files: Movie Collection - Volume 1

Jim has the same crummy cases that hardly pay and everything he owns is needs to be fixed.  I think that is oner reason I liked the series so much...it is like all of our lives. Unlike Magnum who lived on an estate in Hawaii and drove a red Ferrari (good luck tailing anyone incognito in that machine) Jim Rockford lives in an old trailer parked in a restaurant parking lot by the beach and has to keep repairing his Firebird (pretty much a stock auto off the lot). Jim is a realist that still holds to his moral values. He is slightly jaded (you would be jaded to if you pulled five years in prison on a frame) but he has a good heart and still believes in humanity's basic goodness. He is not naieve and has the street smarts to function as a private investigator. Jim tries to avoid fights but does swing a fist when he needs to (invariably in self-defence).  He is no weenie and has used a gun when necessary (we all have a right to protect ourselves and loved ones with firearms should the need arise) but does not play the typical ""gun show commando.""  Rockford is a loyal friend and a good son to his dad. He will try and make a buck on gambling (Brett Maverick) or make an easy score on some mark with questionable income.  He ain't perfect but he is us.

It is hard to dislike anything that James Garner is in. And that is the case for me with this set. I am amazed that the role was so well reprised so many years after the original series was made. Even though older, Rockford still seems much the same, and more. Perhaps he seems more life experienced. The character seems more mellow and warm in his relationships and this is appropriate for the age of the actor, and makes his character continue to be charismatic. That his character is still physical allows the continuity necessary for the role to be so successfully reprised.

Super VHS tapes were.  In short, these reunions, like so many other reunions and shows post the mid 80's, don't ""look"" as good or rich as the original ones.  I also felt that they made Rockford too cranky, and less like the easy-going, likeable guy he was in early seasons.  Finally, many a good Rockford's did not rely on fist fights.

I could not imagine the 70's without Jim Rockford, or some of the other shows of his genre like Starsky and Hutch, etc. And, James Garner, he is one of the all time greatest actors that ever lived in my humble opinion. Certainly the only person we all remember as Maverick, and who remembers him from Cheyenne, where he periodically played the same soldier from a nearby fort. James Garner is and always has been a true acting treasure. Certainly, I have all 6 seasons of the Rockford Files, and would love to own these movies, but not until I can get a full set at a fair price. A half set for what they charge is just not fair.

These 90-minute movies are first-rate and have all the spirit and humor of the original series.They are a follow-up to the original 6 seasons of the TV show. Garner's knee and back problems, which resulted from his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights and car chases, caused him excruciating physical pain, and he opted not to continue with the show, and NBC canceled the program in mid-season.It took 14 years for the ill will between his production company and the network to subside, during which time a decade-long lawsuit over profits was finally settled in his favor.So beginning in the mid-1990s eight movies were produced. Its great to see Lt. Becker and Angel again in these movies.Video quality is very high. The image is clean, colors are true. It looks better than we all saw when broadcast.Note for fans: Not many actual location sets from 70s shows still exist, but the Sandcastle restaurant is still there on the beach in Malibu (and the food is high quality).

He was too ill to be in the movie.""A Blessing In Disguise"" (1995) - an old friend is up to a dangerous new trick when Jim catches Angel preaching from the pulpit of the Temple of Holy Light church, whose members have put the life of a young actress at risk.""If The Frame Fits"" (1996) - It's up to Jim to clear his own name when he becomes the primary suspect in the death of a rival P.I. and the police, FBI and a Latino gang all want to get their hands on him. Rocky's death is addressed. The giant mural seen in this episode is still there: Victor Clothing Company, 242 South Broadway.

I have my own set, recording on the DVDR, editing out commercials, etc but still didn't perfectly get every commercial cut out or release the pause in time. I don't know why all 7 weren't released together but imagine it's the whole legalities / dick slapping on the table / who has the rights to this and that nonsense. I remember an interview with Mr. Garner after the first movie where he stated that Rockford was one of his favorite characters and alot of himself was in Rockford. He said that, while approached many times with the prospect of reviving the character there had to be the right scripts as he didn't want to tarnish the integrity of the series. He said the timing was right and, at 66, if he didn't do it then he really would have been too old to do it.I believe the scripts were good and Mr. Garner was incredible as well as the supporting cast. It says alot about Mr. Garner as a person and actor that many of the original supporting cast as well as writers and staff participated, some coming out of retirement to do so.I have shared my thoughts on many things from music to movies, etc however, if anyone ever listened to a nobody like me I hope this review is taken in the respectful spirit it is intended. While meeting Mr. Garner just to shake his hand and thank him for the many hours growing up watching him, almost in some ways using his character as a role model, buy this and enjoy it for the wit and skill in writing and acting that seems to have been lost in a world of special effects and how many things can be blown up over skill. I anxiously await the remainder of the movies being released, maybe we'll even get the bonus of a movie not released or some great gag reel footage.A shame the world can't be simplified to what it was when the original series ran and gas was 69 cents a gallon. these movies open a window in the 90's of a simpler time.

I think that says it all.  These 1990's Rockford films have all the punch of a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation.  Remember that while they were produced by the original Rockford studio, Universal, they aired on CBS, which in the 90's produced some of the tamest, lamest television of all time.  The plot lines here are feeble, and the characters are parodies of themselves (especially Angel).  They are not the classic works by Stephen J Cannell and David Chase. What these films do, however, is answer the questions that I had up until the point they were produced: ""What would Rockford be doing now and how would he react to current events ie: floods, wildfires, riots etc.?)  Now we know.  The physical stunts (falling down a mountainside, punching people etc.) were believable in the 1970's when James Garner was fit as a fiddle and nearing 50. But they were just plain silly in the 90's when he was nearing 70.  This was why Barnaby Jones was so rediculous!  Ironically, Peter Falk was reprising his Columbo role for ABC about this time and was superb.  But that's because Columbo was more cerebral, and less physical, and thus a perfect match for a man of 49 or 89!As for the packaging, I too would have rather seen these movies boxed into one set... for a litle more money.  Stringing them out into two sets seems absurd, since it's likely that only diehard fans will return for volume two.",3,A Not-So-Great Capper For A Superb Series,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1613,"['When', 'asked', '1999', 'interviewer', 'Museum', 'Television', 'Radio', 'intended', 'continue', 'making', 'Rockford', 'movies', 'James', 'Garner', 'chuckled', 'said', 'No', 'one', '71-year-old', 'private', 'investigator', 'think', '1990', 'Rockford', 'films', 'have', 'punch', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'presentation', 'Remember', 'were', 'produced', 'original', 'Rockford', 'studio', 'Universal', 'aired', 'CBS', '90', 'produced', 'tamest', 'lamest', 'television', 'time', 'plot', 'lines', 'here', 'are', 'feeble', 'characters', 'are', 'parodies', 'especially', 'Angel', 'are', 'not', 'classic', 'works', 'Stephen', 'J', 'Cannell', 'David', 'Chase', 'What', 'films', 'do', 'however', 'answer', 'questions', 'had', 'up', 'point', 'were', 'produced', 'What', 'would', 'Rockford', 'be', 'doing', 'now', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'current', 'events', 'ie', 'floods', 'wildfires', 'riots', 'etc.', 'Now', 'know', 'physical', 'stunts', 'falling', 'down', 'mountainside', 'punching', 'people', 'etc', 'were', 'believable', '1970', 'when', 'James', 'Garner', 'was', 'fit', 'fiddle', 'nearing', '50', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', '90', 'when', 'was', 'nearing', '70', 'was', 'why', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'was', 'so', 'rediculous', 'Ironically', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'was', 'reprising', 'Columbo', 'role', 'ABC', 'time', 'was', 'superb', 'Columbo', 'was', 'more', 'cerebral', 'less', 'physical', 'thus', 'perfect', 'match', 'man', '49', '89', 'packaging', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'movies', 'boxed', 'one', 'set', 'litle', 'more', 'money', 'Stringing', 'out', 'two', 'sets', 'absurd', 'likely', 'only', 'diehard', 'fans', 'will', 'return', 'volume', 'two']",The Rockford Files: Movie Collection - Volume 1

Niles ""Nomad""","[2, 2]","Like most of the reviewers I have a very positive opinion of the Rockford Files and everything that came out of that series.The movies were extensions of the series and completely believable and better, amusing or flat out funny. There were times when I would driving in the LA area in the 70s (I'd moved there in 1977) and just by chance, there would be the Rockford crew, shooting on location! ONE major result of the merger in my mind of the Rockford Files and my entry into LA is that seeing the series episodes is like traveling in time back to that era... pretty amazing experiences are bottled up on the DVDs.I'm in the process of re-collecting the series (like many of the other reviewers, before the DVD sets were released, I recorded all the episodes and the movies on tape.) The movies are next.Two final comments: Garner recently released an autobiography (assisted) that I found fascinating, about how he found himself on TV and movies, how the two major TV series, Rockford Files and Maverick (NOW finally on DVDs as well, I bought the Columbia House Maverick collection in the 90s, 25 tapes for $25 each) were developed and how things in his portion of Hollywood worked [his comment about Hollywood was pointed: ""Of course here, people will lie to you... even when they don't need to.""], also about how uncomfortable he has been speaking in public; I'd suggest that you sample Maverick as well, it's hard to believe that he was only 30 when that series started, with only modest acting experience, it's like watching the birth of a major star.",5,The Garner Files,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,1558,"['most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'very', 'positive', 'opinion', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'everything', 'came', 'series.The', 'movies', 'were', 'extensions', 'series', 'completely', 'believable', 'better', 'amusing', 'flat', 'out', 'funny', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'would', 'driving', 'LA', 'area', '70s', ""'d"", 'moved', 'there', '1977', 'just', 'chance', 'would', 'be', 'Rockford', 'crew', 'shooting', 'location', 'ONE', 'major', 'result', 'merger', 'mind', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'entry', 'LA', 'seeing', 'series', 'traveling', 'time', 'back', 'era', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'experiences', 'are', 'bottled', 'up', 'DVDs.I', ""'m"", 'process', 're-collecting', 'series', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'sets', 'were', 'released', 'recorded', 'episodes', 'movies', 'tape', 'movies', 'are', 'next.Two', 'final', 'comments', 'Garner', 'recently', 'released', 'autobiography', 'assisted', 'found', 'fascinating', 'how', 'found', 'TV', 'movies', 'how', 'two', 'major', 'TV', 'series', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Maverick', 'NOW', 'finally', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'bought', 'Columbia', 'House', 'Maverick', 'collection', '90s', '25', 'tapes', '25', 'were', 'developed', 'how', 'things', 'portion', 'Hollywood', 'worked', '[', 'comment', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'pointed', 'course', 'here', 'people', 'will', 'lie', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', ']', 'also', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'been', 'speaking', 'public', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'sample', 'Maverick', 'as', 'well', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'only', '30', 'when', 'series', 'started', 'only', 'modest', 'acting', 'experience', 'watching', 'birth', 'major', 'star']",The Rockford Files: Movie Collection - Volume 1
