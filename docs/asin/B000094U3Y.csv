It doesn't start out animated right away, because Jeff's asleep and Greg, Murray and Anthony wonder what he is dreaming about.  When the Wiggles are finally in his dream, the're all animated and stil inside Wigglehouse.While visiting Planet Rock in Outer Space, the Wiggles and friends are invited by King Mondo to dance and sing in his rock and roll band...singing ""Eagle Rock"".

It's fun seeing things from Jeff's dreamland point-of-view and the songs are quite cute.  This really is a good time and a nice change from the studio Wiggles shows.  It's just something different and quite welcome.  Now on that ""Dance the Gloomies Away"" song, just TRY to get it out of your head!  It's very cute and well worth the money.  My little guy just sat there not moving throughout the video - something he normally doesn't do.  And, since it has something to do with space, rocket ships, you name it, we have to watch this over, and over, and over....  The Wiggles are captivating even in cartoon form and this is just a great idea.  No, the story isn't all that fantastic, especially with the little people.  They really could have expanded on that one.  But, all-in-all, it's a great video and I'm glad we got it.",5,"Great, fun video",1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,956,"['Boy', 'what', 'cute', 'video', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'upset', 'really', 'really', 'cute', 'quite', 'imaginative', 'fun', 'seeing', 'things', 'Jeff', 'dreamland', 'point-of-view', 'songs', 'are', 'quite', 'cute', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'nice', 'change', 'studio', 'Wiggles', 'just', 'something', 'different', 'quite', 'welcome', 'Now', 'Dance', 'Gloomies', 'Away', 'song', 'just', 'TRY', 'get', 'head', 'very', 'cute', 'well', 'money', 'little', 'guy', 'just', 'sat', 'not', 'moving', 'video', 'something', 'normally', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'do', 'space', 'rocket', 'ships', 'name', 'have', 'watch', 'over', 'Wiggles', 'are', 'captivating', 'even', 'cartoon', 'form', 'just', 'great', 'idea', 'No', 'story', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'especially', 'little', 'people', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'expanded', 'one', 'all-in-all', 'great', 'video', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got']",The Wiggles: Wiggles Space Dancing

751988,A32HEH9BZ1B0KY,B000094U3Y,Faramarz Rabii,"[3, 4]","This is my all time favorite. It is totally different from all other Wiggles DVDs that I have ever seen. The story is based on an animated adventure happening inside Jeff's dream. In this adventure, they visit 3 planets on an alien ship then rock and roll their way back to earth. The reason I like this is that unlike so many children's movies, it is fun without having evil monsters or horrible tragedies. It is also weird enough to appeal to a 46 year old male like me as well as my 4 year old daughter. We have enjoyed watching this one together many times. Unfortunately, our copy has gone missing.

751993,AGFW667QNHDOY,B000094U3Y,S. Lipson,"[3, 4]","I was very skeptical of this cartoon release by the Wiggles, and quite hesitent when my kid really wanted it. I will say that our family has enjoyed this release just fine. The story and cartoon format is interesting and different. It is interspersed with little ""real Wiggles"" footage. I was surprised how the story moved along even with only 6 songs. Special features of this DVD are; The making of Space Dancing, a section on characters, an audience with King Mondo, and a Return to Earth game (7 sequential questions from the story--a review format to test comprehension/memory of the story). My kids love the game (they are only 3 & 4) and strangely want to play it again and again even though it is never different! If you really like just the traditional Wiggles, I would recommend trying to borrow or rent this release for viewing first before buying it.
