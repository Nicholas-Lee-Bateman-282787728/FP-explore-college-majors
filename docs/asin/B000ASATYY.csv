932720,A11TJ31AZBWSGK,B000ASATYY,Jocasta Stephenson,"[8, 9]","Call me crazy (most do, anyway), but I absolutely adore this series. The first is your classic adventure flick, of course, with all the romance, action and comedy that entails. The second, and my personal favorite, delves much further into the story and cranks up the character development for practically every major character (I even cried for Imhotep at one point. Yeah... you don't want to get me started on that subject). Since I'm such a sucker for that sort of thing, you can bet I was captivated. Scorpion King, while not exactly mind-blowing, is cool for backstory on a previously sketchy character and pure actiony fun. Plus, Mathayus kicks butt in high style. :DThe box set itself is really quite durable, though it might not look it at first glance. An interesting choice, making it out of cardboard like that, but it works nicely. As for the extras and such, I love running through these. Having been fascinated with the ancient country from early childhood, the Egyptology lessons are nothing that I didn't already know, but they make me grin all the same. All in all, there are some lovely goodies in this set, especially the music videos for TMR and SK.Mind you, I already own the lot of them on VHS (despite the fact that they're in another state with my grandmother while I'm at college), but we all know what happens to those things after so many viewings. So yeah, I didn't think getting one of my favorite series for the price of one new release was such a bad thing.ps: The guys, particularly Brendan and Oded, are great eye candy. The Rock and Arnold add their own flavor of ""hot,"" too, which is nothing to complain about for this female.

It's a nice compilation of the first two ""Mummy"" flicks and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's vehicle, ""The Scorpion King.""  Odds are that if you've watched these films and enjoyed them, this is a great boxed set for you to pick up.  A newer set was released this year, which includes the first two ""Mummy"" films and the latest installment of the series, ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.""  ""The Scorpion King"" is not included in that set, but can be purchased on its own (as can all four of these films).The first two films are similar, with the Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) being raised from the dead and hoping to bring back is lost love in the first film (and unleashing plagues on the world) and his lost love attempting to bring him back (as well as the Scorpion King) to take over the world.  In their way in both films is Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn and Jonathan (Rachel Weisz, John Hannah) and Ardeth Bay (the underused Oded Fehr).The third film, ""The Scorpion King,"" is a pure action/popcorn flick littered with comedy in the same vein as ""Hercules:  The Legendary Journeys.""  Dwayne Johnson and Michael Clarke Duncan lead this film that is something of a prequel to the other films.  You do not need to watch this film in order to understand anything going on in the other two and vice versa.  This film stands apart as its own entity.Special features range from outtakes and deleted scenes to a couple of brief documentaries on Egyptology.  There are also a couple of music videos and a look at the ""real"" Scorpion King.If you're in the mood for big action, big effects and big bad guys, pick up ""The Mummy Collector's Set.""

The Scorpion King is like all of The Rock's other movies - brainless, but charming because The Rock is charming.Overall it's hard to recommend a set like this because popcorn flicks don't appeal to everyone.

It's a great buy since buying them together here is cheaper than seperately.  The packaging is good.  It's a regular plastic snap case with a cardboard cover that slips over the outside.The reason I bought this one was because I liked the first and second Mummy movies but not the third one.  I didn't really want Scorpion King, but it came with it and is was still cheaper to get this than them seperately.  This has some good bonus features too, like deleted scenes, behind the scenes etc...If you like theses movies and don't own them, you might want to check this out.  If you already own them, nothing different here from seperate versions.",5,3 movies for the price of one!,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,750,"['Mummy', 'Collector', 'Set', '3', 'movies', 'Mummy', '1999', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'great', 'buy', 'buying', 'together', 'here', 'cheaper', 'seperately', 'packaging', 'good', 'regular', 'plastic', 'snap', 'case', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'outside.The', 'reason', 'bought', 'one', 'was', 'liked', 'first', 'second', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'not', 'third', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'came', 'was', 'still', 'cheaper', 'get', 'seperately', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', 'too', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'etc', 'like', 'theses', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'already', 'own', 'nothing', 'different', 'here', 'seperate', 'versions']",N/A

""Paul White""","[0, 1]","I got this having never seen Scorpion King; I picked it up for the same price as getting both The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.These movies are what they are, and are enjoyable brainless fare.  The first movie is a straight up action flick with the obligitory comedy, but it's well done, preformances are credible and FX are good.  It ain't art but it ain't bad either.  Rival treasure hunters, a love interest, an evil mummy, some pretty cool FX and a plot that isn't terrible (although not great either) add up to a watchable, enjoyable popcorn movie.Some people don't like the Mummy Returns. I do; it engaged in some funny self and genre paradoy (although that may be more apparent to fans of the genre).  The plot was less coherent, but if you watch flicks like this for the plot, something is clinically wrong with you.  Same holds true, but I'd say there's more comedy in this than the original. Worth watching, and fun in it's own way.  I agree that FX got overdone on occasion, but it is still an enjoyable movie, very similar to the first one in tone and style (just iwth a bigger budget).Scorpion King is an average flick, and I wouldn't miss it, but given that it's basically a freebie if you were going to buy the other two, who cares? I think both ""Mummy"" titles were superior, but SK is good for a saturday night boozefest with friends.There really aren't any extras, so if you like extras and commentary then this ain't for you, but the transfer is good, as is the image quality.  These movies are fine for what they are; they avoid pretension while delivering some escapist thrills.  I don't view them as horror, but as comedy-adventure.  They're both fun and funny.",4,Good popcorn flicks,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,1681,"['got', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'picked', 'up', 'same', 'price', 'getting', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns.These', 'movies', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'brainless', 'fare', 'first', 'movie', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'flick', 'obligitory', 'comedy', 'well', 'done', 'preformances', 'are', 'credible', 'FX', 'are', 'good', 'ai', ""n't"", 'art', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'Rival', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'love', 'interest', 'evil', 'mummy', 'pretty', 'cool', 'FX', 'plot', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'not', 'great', 'add', 'up', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'popcorn', 'movie.Some', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'do', 'engaged', 'funny', 'self', 'genre', 'paradoy', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'apparent', 'fans', 'genre', 'plot', 'was', 'less', 'coherent', 'watch', 'flicks', 'plot', 'something', 'clinically', 'wrong', 'Same', 'true', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'comedy', 'original', 'Worth', 'watching', 'fun', 'own', 'way', 'agree', 'FX', 'got', 'overdone', 'occasion', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'first', 'one', 'tone', 'style', 'just', 'iwth', 'bigger', 'budget', '.Scorpion', 'King', 'average', 'flick', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'given', 'basically', 'freebie', 'were', 'going', 'buy', 'other', 'two', 'who', 'think', 'Mummy', 'titles', 'were', 'superior', 'SK', 'good', 'saturday', 'night', 'boozefest', 'friends.There', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'so', 'like', 'extras', 'commentary', 'then', 'ai', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'good', 'image', 'quality', 'movies', 'are', 'fine', 'what', 'are', 'avoid', 'pretension', 'delivering', 'escapist', 'thrills', 'do', ""n't"", 'view', 'horror', 'comedy-adventure', ""'re"", 'fun', 'funny']",N/A
