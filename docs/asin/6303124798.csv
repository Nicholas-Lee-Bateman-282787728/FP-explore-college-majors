359112,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,6303124798,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[3, 3]","I recently saw an episode of the Fox cartoon ""American Dad!"" that has a parody of WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE using squirrels. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Well, so I felt at the time. That's what brought to my attention this great movie that I enjoyed all those years ago back in the 90s and several times since. A memory I have from back then is while hanging out telling a friend ""his mom is eating him"" and my friend just looking at me and his eyes widening like he just heard something profound. Makes me laugh just thinking about it now. Grape's morbidly obese mom is a problem along with his retarded brother Arnie that he has to look after. And it's that small town life isn't it? He wants to go. Leonardo Dicaprio is incredible -I mean I'm talking 100% convincing. I remember people saying they thought the person playing Arnie was actually mentally retarded. Needless to say this was before TITANIC. I always thought Dicaprio deserved an Oscar and just now read he was nominated. Leonardo Dicaprio will never top this performance. Genius actor Johnny Depp, great as always. Just another notch on his belt. Juliette Lewis is good as romantic interest Becky. Everyone did a fine job. Gilbert's mom is played by nonactor real life obese person Darlene Cates. It's one of my favorite movies when I think about it.

359115,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,6303124798,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 2]","""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is the kind of movie which you don't expect too much before you see it, but after you've seen it, a smile in your face will appear.The movie tells the story of Gilbert Grape, a nice guy trapped in a small town, with a dysfunctional family (as almost every family is), a job without a future and a relationship with a married woman. And despite all this, he is not a sad man, he is not depressed, he is not worried about himself; his main reason to live is to take care of his family. Everything else comes in a second place, including himself.Johnny Depp is the center of the movie and his low-key performance is excellent, but the reason why this movie works so fine is the supporting cast; Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as the mentally retarded brother, he and Depp are the fuel of the story. The rest of the cast includes: Darlene Cates as the big, big, big mother, John C. Reilly as Gilbert's best friend, Juliette Lewis as Gilbert's new love interest and Mary Steenburgen as the married woman who is having an affair with Gilbert, all of them are terrific in their roles.The main purpose of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is to entertain audiences, and it does...a very enjoyable movie.",4,"THIS IS AN ENTERTAINING, ENJOYABLE AND SWEET MOVIE.",1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,1220,"['What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'kind', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'smile', 'face', 'will', 'appear.The', 'movie', 'story', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'nice', 'guy', 'trapped', 'small', 'town', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'almost', 'family', 'job', 'future', 'relationship', 'married', 'woman', 'not', 'sad', 'man', 'not', 'depressed', 'not', 'worried', 'main', 'reason', 'live', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'Everything', 'else', 'second', 'place', 'including', 'himself.Johnny', 'Depp', 'center', 'movie', 'low-key', 'performance', 'excellent', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'terrific', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'brother', 'Depp', 'are', 'fuel', 'story', 'rest', 'cast', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'mother', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Gilbert', 'best', 'friend', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'Gilbert', 'are', 'terrific', 'roles.The', 'main', 'purpose', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

I had been meaning to watch it for years but never seemed to be able to find the time. When I saw it came out on one of our high def movie channels I made sure to set the DVR to record it.This movie is both fun and sad. Mostly it's sad though. Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape. He's a young man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He has a mom who hasn't come out of the house in years since his father committed suicide in the basement. He has a brother with a disability who is unable to care for himself. And, to top it off, he has three other sisters to watch out for. Try juggling that while working at a grocery store, having an affair with an insurance salesman's wife, and falling in love with a young woman who is only in town for a short period of time.They live in a small town in Iowa that is going no where. His only friends is the local mortician and a handyman with a dream of owning a Burger Barn.Over the summer, everything changes for him. The aforementioned young lady has caught his eye, his brother's eighteenth birthday is nearing, a super mega grocery store has opened outside of town, and his own emotional needs are coming to a head.It's a really good movie and I'm looking forward to reading the book now so I can see what all was left out.

359122,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,6303124798,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 3]","I've watched What's Eating Gilbert Grape a couple of times over the last 10 years or so, and always thought it was a pretty good movie, but it never really hit home until my most recent viewing. This movie, as dreary as it might seem at times, is one of the few that I can wholeheartedly recommend to just about anyone. It's a light drama, but depending on how you look at certain situations in the movie, it could also come off as a dark comedy. There's something for everyone here.Gilbert Grape is a young man living in the small [fictional] town of Endora, Illinois with his two sisters, 500 pound mother and mentally challenged brother, Arnie. Gilbert's father committed suicide a while ago, and he's been doing his best to keep things going for the family by working in a small grocery store and repairing the house. When he's not working, Gilbert usually spends time with Arnie, whether it's doing fun things or getting Arnie out of trouble, like when he goes on yet another adventure trying to climb the water reservoir. Something is clearly bothering Gilbert, though he has a cool exterior and doesn't seem annoyed at his situation, but he appears to just be going with the flow of life, not trying to get anything more than what he's got. Even the affair he's having with a married woman comes off as a distraction more than anything else. But one day, a young woman and her grandmother come to Endora, passing through while on a trip and their car breaks down. She's different from everyone else he's known...could she be the shot in the arm that he needs?Right off the bat in Gilbert's narration, he mentions that doctors said Arnie wasn't going to live longer than 6, but here he is about to turn 18. Whenever Arnie would go off and do something, I'd wonder ""is this it?"". Arnie doesn't realize just how easy it is to get hurt, and needs constant supervision. Even something as simple as taking a bath by himself isn't a good idea. Gilbert loves Arnie with all his heart, but how long can he deal with outbursts and laughter during inappropriate times? Screaming with joy that a Burger Barn is coming to town, during a funeral, would grind anyone's gears. The little grocery store that Gilbert works in never seems to have any business, especially now that a much larger store just a few miles away has opened up, and his boss is worried about it. Yet Gilbert insists that people will start coming back on a regular basis once things have settled down. We know the truth, and I'm pretty sure Gilbert knows the truth too. It might not sound that interesting, but it's the characters that drive this story, and the situations too. One of his friends is a mortician, played by Crispin Glover, and he's always eager to know how someone's doing, obviously wanting more business. Simply asking someone how their mom's doing always gets a little laugh out of me. Another friend, played by John C. Reilly, helps Gilbert with repairs now and then, but constantly brings up how great Burger Barn is, and how it'll help the city once one opens up. It's quaint conversations like this that somehow got my interest. These are plain, simple people with problems a lot of us can relate to in one way or another. How many more times is Gilbert going to slip under the cheating wife's husband's nose before he gets caught? How can someone so nice do something as heartless as letting a kid peek through his window to see his huge mom? What is it that will finally make Gilbert snap, having given so much in his life without getting anything in return?Johnny Depp doesn't exactly stretch his acting abilities with this role, but it's such a plain character compared to what most people are used to, that it makes the character stand out. It's not up there with his performance in Ed Wood, but it's certainly worth watching for. Leonardo DiCaprio though, is the one that'll get most people. Just like how Depp loses himself in his character most of the time, Leo does it as Arnie. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who's been in some of the biggest recent movies, or even as a troubled teen on Growing Pains. The rest of the cast does great as well, especially Darlene Cates as their mother. The anguish in her voice during certain scenes will send a chill up your spine.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the kind of movie you kinda have to be in the mood for. It's not a downer of a movie, but it's definitely not upbeat either. Give it a go on a slow, rainy weekend evening by yourself or with another person.",4,I wonder when Tim Burton's gonna remake this one...,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,4514,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'couple', 'times', 'last', '10', 'years', 'so', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'most', 'recent', 'viewing', 'movie', 'as', 'dreary', 'might', 'seem', 'times', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'light', 'drama', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'certain', 'situations', 'movie', 'could', 'also', 'come', 'off', 'dark', 'comedy', 'something', 'everyone', 'here.Gilbert', 'Grape', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'small', '[', 'fictional', ']', 'town', 'Endora', 'Illinois', 'two', 'sisters', '500', 'pound', 'mother', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'brother', 'Arnie', 'Gilbert', 'father', 'committed', 'while', 'ago', 'been', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'family', 'working', 'small', 'grocery', 'store', 'repairing', 'house', 'When', 'not', 'working', 'Gilbert', 'usually', 'time', 'Arnie', 'doing', 'fun', 'things', 'getting', 'Arnie', 'trouble', 'when', 'yet', 'adventure', 'trying', 'climb', 'water', 'reservoir', 'Something', 'clearly', 'bothering', 'Gilbert', 'cool', 'exterior', ""n't"", 'seem', 'annoyed', 'situation', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'flow', 'life', 'not', 'trying', 'get', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'Even', 'affair', 'having', 'married', 'woman', 'off', 'distraction', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'woman', 'grandmother', 'come', 'Endora', 'passing', 'trip', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'known', 'could', 'be', 'shot', 'arm', 'Right', 'bat', 'Gilbert', 'narration', 'doctors', 'said', 'Arnie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'live', 'longer', '6', 'here', 'turn', '18', 'Whenever', 'Arnie', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'do', 'something', ""'d"", 'wonder', 'Arnie', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'easy', 'get', 'hurt', 'constant', 'supervision', 'Even', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'taking', 'bath', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'Gilbert', 'Arnie', 'heart', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'deal', 'outbursts', 'laughter', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'Screaming', 'joy', 'Burger', 'Barn', 'coming', 'town', 'funeral', 'would', 'grind', 'anyone', 'gears', 'little', 'grocery', 'store', 'Gilbert', 'never', 'have', 'business', 'especially', 'now', 'much', 'larger', 'store', 'just', 'few', 'miles', 'away', 'opened', 'up', 'boss', 'worried', 'Gilbert', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'coming', 'back', 'regular', 'basis', 'once', 'things', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'know', 'truth', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Gilbert', 'truth', 'too', 'might', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'characters', 'drive', 'story', 'situations', 'too', 'One', 'friends', 'mortician', 'played', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'always', 'eager', 'know', 'how', 'someone', 'doing', 'obviously', 'wanting', 'more', 'business', 'Simply', 'asking', 'someone', 'how', 'mom', 'doing', 'always', 'little', 'laugh', 'friend', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Gilbert', 'repairs', 'now', 'then', 'constantly', 'up', 'how', 'great', 'Burger', 'Barn', 'how', ""'ll"", 'help', 'city', 'once', 'one', 'up', 'quaint', 'conversations', 'somehow', 'got', 'interest', 'are', 'plain', 'simple', 'people', 'problems', 'lot', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'Gilbert', 'going', 'slip', 'cheating', 'wife', 'husband', 'nose', 'caught', 'How', 'can', 'someone', 'so', 'nice', 'do', 'something', 'as', 'heartless', 'letting', 'kid', 'peek', 'window', 'see', 'huge', 'mom', 'What', 'will', 'finally', 'make', 'Gilbert', 'snap', 'having', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'getting', 'anything', 'return', 'Johnny', 'Depp', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stretch', 'acting', 'abilities', 'role', 'such', 'plain', 'character', 'compared', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'character', 'stand', 'out', 'not', 'there', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', ""'ll"", 'get', 'most', 'people', 'Just', 'how', 'Depp', 'character', 'most', 'time', 'Leo', 'Arnie', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'biggest', 'recent', 'movies', 'even', 'troubled', 'teen', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'mother', 'anguish', 'voice', 'certain', 'scenes', 'will', 'send', 'chill', 'up', 'spine.What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'kind', 'movie', 'kinda', 'have', 'be', 'mood', 'not', 'downer', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'upbeat', 'either', 'Give', 'go', 'slow', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'evening', 'person']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS
359123,AZXNBK1K43Y69,6303124798,audreylynn,"[5, 6]","This is a sad story about a lonely, depressed man living a life that is surrounded by complete chaos. ""Poor Gilbert,"" is all I can say. It is truly a touching, emotional movie, and I assure that every viewer of this movie will sympathize with Gilbert and his completely wrecked life.Gilbert Grape (Depp) lives with his mother, two sisters, and brother in an old rotting house in a small dead town. His father committed suicide in their basement several years ago. One sister is bothersome and cruel. His mother became severely depressed after the death of her husband and gained so much weight that Gilbert refers to her as a ""beached whale."" The saddest of Gilbert's problems is his younger brother, Arnie (DiCaprio). Arnie is a mentally retarded teenager, and he is not expected to live very long. Despite all of this, Gilbert is selfless and does everything humanly possible for his hopeless family. Most important is Gilbert's relationship with Arnie. Gilbert loves and takes care of Arnie, and he swears to never let anything happen to him. Many more depressing events occur in this movie, but Gilbert does meet a carefree young woman (Juliette Lewis) who shows him that life doesn't have to be perfect to feel happy.This is yet another unsurpassable performance by Johnny Depp. Johnny is the only actor I know that makes the viewer feel what he's feeling solely by the expressions he makes on his face.

You see, I have been morbidly obese, too, although not as large as she is. So on the one hand, I have real admiration for her courage in making this film, and I can appreciate how hard it must have been for her. On the other hand I am acutely aware of the fact that the only solution to the problem of Mama the screenplay writer could come up with was her death. She cries about how much of a burden she knows she is on her kids, and the next thing you know, she's dead. Was it suicide? It was her husband's suicide all those years ago that started her on her spiraling weight gain. That's another topic on which I am sensitive, as my husband committed suicide.Then there is the incredibly real performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie, Gilbert Grape's retarded little brother. Sorry; I know the correct language is mentally impaired or something, but the performance is a stunningly accurate one of someone who is retarded, held back, limited, slow, developmentally disabled. He's a real handful, and because of Mama's limitations, he's mostly Gilbert's handful. Gilbert, of course, is played by the delicious Johnny Depp. Mrs. Carver (Mary Steenburgen) certainly finds him delicious. She, too, is hard to like, but easy to envy.It's very hard to like Arnie, although one can have compassion for him. Just as it is very hard to like Gilbert's selfish little sister Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), although one can't help sympathizing with the fact that her family has been an embarrassment to her all her life, and teen-agers are so sensitive about such things.All in all, it's a story of people who are doing their best, and they do love each other, but their best just doesn't seem to work very well. It all falls on Gilbert, and when he finally finds a nice girl to get close to (Becky is played by Juliette Lewis), he ends up screwing up and hurting others just to try to get a little something for himself.One touching scene occurs when Becky asks Gilbert what he wants, and he mentions all these things for his family. What do you want for yourself, she asks, possibly hoping he would say she was what he wanted. ""To be a good person,"" he replies.

This movie has to have one of the cheesiest titles in history, but that's the only bad thing that can be said about it. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is both powerful and poignant. From the opening shot, it creates a realistic mood that only dissipates upon completion. The film is funny, joyous, anxious, and depressing which means that it is an accurate reflection of the emotions most of us go experience everyday. The plot is interesting but it is the characters that make it so memorable. As far as the acting goes, I agree with the other reviewers as Johnny Depp are Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding. With Depp, his portrayal of Gilbert is both sedate and authentic. His skill makes the audience temporarily forget that this modelesque guy with golden locks would rarely be found in a sleepy Iowa town. Concerning DiCaprio, few thespians could play a mentally retarded child with such aplomb. I have to admit that I've never really liked his work, but DiCaprio deserves his due here. My only reservation was that I thought the depiction of rural life was a little over the top with John C. Reilly's character being more a caricature than an actual person.

This is one such film.The story of Gilbert Grape is a coming-of-age story like none other.  His father committed suicide when Gilbert was a preteen, and since then he's been the man of the family.  And oh, what a family.  This is as dysfunctional a lot as anyone you know.But the great thing about the film is that they don't look down on this gang of misfits in any way.  They are handled with dignity and realism, and Gilbert's stuck-in-a-rut life is as understandable as a stop sign.  While the &quot;and then enters the beautiful girl&quot; plot line could easily become a too-easy Hollywood cliche, it doesn't come close.Naturally I could say much about the plot here, but won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this masterpiece.  Leonardo DiCaprio, in his debut as a featured movie performer, steals the show as mentally incapacitated Arnie, blowing away anyone's thought that he's just another pretty face.  Johnny Depp is dead-on as the perpetually frustrated Gilbert, who's finally about to stop holding it together.

Johnny Depp turns in a credible performance as Big Brother-Caretaker who simmers slightly beneath the surface to escape to a better life somewhere other than this backward southern town. In supporting roles, Mary Steenburgen is in the rare role of older woman who sparks Gilbert's sexual awakening, but the multi-talented Juliette Lewis truly has Gilbert's heart after igniting his feeling of love. Both they and the lead are virtually upstaged, however, by Leonardo diCaprio's Oscar-nominated tour de force as Gilbert's brain-damaged kid brother, and diCaprio is not less than overwhelmingly convincing in his portrayal. A subplot focuses on Gilbert's grossly obese mother, seldom seen in public, and the storyline serves to further explain Gilbert's simmering desire to go for a better life somewhere else. Depp, Lewis and Steenburgen command the viewer's attention. But catch this film if for no other reason than diCaprio's performance.

At the time, de Caprio was a little boy though received an Oscar nomination that launched this actor into a successful career, which has proved he has the right ""stuff"" to portray anyone, a natural actor.One of the interesting casting stories is that Bonnie, Darelene Cates, `Momma"", was not a professional actor, but chosen from the town where the film was shot.

Under its surface goings-on What's Eating Gilbert Grape has much to say about guilt, love, duty, family loyalty, and the power of all these things to enslave. Playing the title character, Johnny Depp is expectedly superb with his restrained, sensitive performance as a good-hearted, overburdened young man struggling to be all things to too many people, and long before Titanic, a then little known Leonardo DiCaprio proved his acting skills as Depp's risk-taking retarded younger brother, Arnie. (So adept at acting was DiCaprio here that I can remember people asking if ""that kid from Growing Pains"" really was retarded.)What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a thoughtful movie. As what remains of his youth drifts toward conclusion and life seems in danger of passing him by, Gilbert Grape lives his days in a static prairie town, working for a corner grocery, overseeing his sisters, his mentally disabled brother, and his mother, who is shut-in by her disfiguring obesity. Grape feels obligated to take on many roles, breadwinner, dutiful son, loyal employee, and he does all this so thoroughly that there is no space in his own existence for himself. At times Grape allows his imagination to wander and he dreams of moving on and finding a place in the outer world, but always he feels the tug of what holds him behind. When one day a whim of fate brings the girl of his dreams into town, Grape is finally forced to confront the roles he plays for others: and Grape's decision will probably surprise many.As it flows through its deliberately-paced run-time What's Eating Gilbert Grape becomes like a river that alters its channel several times before reaching its destination, and the events that transpire between its opening and ending have the power to shock and sadden, but also make you feel like cheering. There just aren't too many movies out there like this one, and that's part of why so many have found it so special.",4,"Depp, DiCaprio, Glover, Lewis, Reilly, Steenburgen...What Can Go Wrong?",1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2051,"['1993', 'on-screen', 'version', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'quirky', 'novel', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'really', 'fine', 'motion', 'picture', 'see', 'surface', 'goings-on', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'much', 'say', 'guilt', 'love', 'duty', 'family', 'loyalty', 'power', 'things', 'enslave', 'Playing', 'title', 'character', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'expectedly', 'superb', 'restrained', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'good-hearted', 'overburdened', 'young', 'man', 'struggling', 'be', 'things', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'long', 'before', 'Titanic', 'then', 'little', 'known', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'proved', 'acting', 'skills', 'Depp', 'risk-taking', 'retarded', 'younger', 'brother', 'Arnie', 'So', 'adept', 'acting', 'was', 'DiCaprio', 'here', 'can', 'remember', 'people', 'asking', 'kid', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'really', 'was', 'retarded', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'what', 'youth', 'drifts', 'conclusion', 'life', 'danger', 'passing', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'days', 'static', 'prairie', 'town', 'working', 'corner', 'grocery', 'overseeing', 'sisters', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'brother', 'mother', 'who', 'shut-in', 'disfiguring', 'obesity', 'Grape', 'feels', 'obligated', 'take', 'many', 'roles', 'breadwinner', 'dutiful', 'son', 'loyal', 'employee', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'space', 'own', 'existence', 'times', 'Grape', 'imagination', 'wander', 'moving', 'finding', 'place', 'outer', 'world', 'always', 'tug', 'what', 'behind', 'When', 'one', 'day', 'whim', 'fate', 'girl', 'dreams', 'town', 'Grape', 'finally', 'forced', 'confront', 'roles', 'others', 'Grape', 'decision', 'will', 'probably', 'surprise', 'many.As', 'deliberately-paced', 'run-time', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'river', 'channel', 'several', 'times', 'reaching', 'destination', 'events', 'transpire', 'opening', 'ending', 'have', 'power', 'shock', 'sadden', 'also', 'make', 'feel', 'cheering', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'part', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'found', 'so', 'special']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

359147,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6303124798,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[7, 8]","`What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is one of those rare accomplishments in cinema where you learn something about yourself while you watch the credits role.  This is a film that, instead of focusing all its efforts in developing a plot heavy script, creates an atmosphere that absorbs the viewer into the hearts of the central characters, forcing us to look at these people, their everyday lives, their ordinary, and compare their feelings and emotions to our own.  We watch Gilbert (Johnny Depp) as he takes the reigns of his dysfunctional family and tries his hardest to make things better for them, with almost no recognition and or appreciation.  We watch Gilbert battle his feelings of abandonment and his almost innate desire to abandon those around him, to think about himself for a change.  We watch Gilbert selflessly do the right thing regardless of the fact that no one notices and we pray that we have a little Gilbert in is all.Gilbert's home life is far from normal.  Having suffered the suicide of his father at a young age he was left to take care of his two sisters Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), his mentally challenged brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his obese mother Bonnie (Darlene Cates) who hasn't left the house since her husband died.  Gilbert works for a local family run grocer that's slowly going out of business due to the `Wal-Mart' type super center that's come to town.  He has a few good friends, more notably Tucker (John C. Reilly) who helps out around the house, and with the influx of vacationers he has a new love interest Becky (Juliette Lewis) who's stranded in town with her Grandmother (Penelope Branning) due to a broken-down truck.  This new girl also strikes jealosy in the eyes of Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen) the married mother of two whom Gilbert has been `servicing' for a while now.The film, as I said, is less plot driven and more character driven.  It really builds its characters strongly, letting us know everyone in the cast and realize their dreams, their motives and their fears.  The strongest relationship built is between Gilbert and his brother Arnie, and this of course is driven mostly by DiCaprio's brilliant performance.  Leonardo is so convincing, so calculated and brilliant in his delivery that it's hard to grasp the concept that he isn't handicapped.  This has to be one of the most realistic performances in recent years (if you count 13 years recent).  As you watch Gilbert's reaction to Arnie and everyone around him you can see his deep love and concern for his brother...it's touching...moving even.I think that best describes this film.  Touching and moving, for it truly is.  Driven by wonderful performances, DiCaprio and Cates leading the pack by completely becoming absorbed in their characters, this is truly a brilliantly made film.  Every character, every performance is different than the next and aided only by the strength of the next.  Depp in particular feeds off the rest of the cast in order to survive, for even though his story may be the most important it's also the least interesting (I'll explain in a minute) and so he steals his glory from the strength of others.  That's not a nark on Depp at all; it's just that his character is so selfless and so caring that he's almost...boring.  Depp plays Gilbert with such subtlety that he almost appears to have no emotion (except for a few scenes, the scene where he hits Arnie for one)...and this is something that could have easily caused him to sink into the background, but instead of allowing that to happen, as I mentioned, Depp uses the strength of his cast mates performances to propel him further instead of drown him out.`What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is an extraordinary film that will touch the heart and tug at those tear ducts.",5,'Gilbert Grape' is sheer cinematic brilliance!,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,3811,"['What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'one', 'rare', 'accomplishments', 'cinema', 'where', 'learn', 'something', 'watch', 'credits', 'role', 'film', 'instead', 'focusing', 'efforts', 'developing', 'plot', 'heavy', 'script', 'atmosphere', 'viewer', 'hearts', 'central', 'characters', 'forcing', 'look', 'people', 'everyday', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'compare', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'own', 'watch', 'Gilbert', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'reigns', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'hardest', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'almost', 'recognition', 'appreciation', 'watch', 'Gilbert', 'battle', 'feelings', 'abandonment', 'almost', 'innate', 'desire', 'abandon', 'think', 'change', 'watch', 'Gilbert', 'selflessly', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'regardless', 'fact', 'one', 'pray', 'have', 'little', 'Gilbert', 'all.Gilbert', 'home', 'life', 'far', 'normal', 'Having', 'suffered', 'suicide', 'father', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'left', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'sisters', 'Amy', 'Laura', 'Harrington', 'Ellen', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Schellhardt', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'brother', 'Arnie', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'obese', 'mother', 'Bonnie', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'who', ""n't"", 'left', 'house', 'husband', 'died', 'Gilbert', 'local', 'family', 'run', 'grocer', 'slowly', 'going', 'business', 'due', 'Wal-Mart', 'type', 'super', 'center', 'come', 'town', 'few', 'good', 'friends', 'more', 'notably', 'Tucker', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'out', 'house', 'influx', 'vacationers', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Becky', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'who', 'stranded', 'town', 'Grandmother', 'Penelope', 'Branning', 'due', 'broken-down', 'truck', 'new', 'girl', 'also', 'jealosy', 'eyes', 'Betty', 'Carver', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'married', 'mother', 'two', 'whom', 'Gilbert', 'been', 'servicing', 'while', 'now.The', 'film', 'said', 'less', 'plot', 'driven', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'really', 'characters', 'strongly', 'letting', 'know', 'everyone', 'cast', 'realize', 'dreams', 'motives', 'fears', 'strongest', 'relationship', 'built', 'Gilbert', 'brother', 'Arnie', 'course', 'driven', 'mostly', 'DiCaprio', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Leonardo', 'so', 'convincing', 'so', 'calculated', 'brilliant', 'delivery', 'hard', 'grasp', 'concept', ""n't"", 'handicapped', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'performances', 'recent', 'years', 'count', '13', 'years', 'recent', 'watch', 'Gilbert', 'reaction', 'Arnie', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'deep', 'love', 'concern', 'brother', 'touching', 'moving', 'even.I', 'think', 'best', 'describes', 'film', 'Touching', 'moving', 'truly', 'Driven', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'DiCaprio', 'Cates', 'leading', 'pack', 'completely', 'becoming', 'absorbed', 'characters', 'truly', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'film', 'character', 'performance', 'different', 'next', 'aided', 'only', 'strength', 'next', 'Depp', 'particular', 'feeds', 'rest', 'cast', 'order', 'survive', 'even', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'also', 'least', 'interesting', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'minute', 'so', 'glory', 'strength', 'others', 'not', 'nark', 'Depp', 'just', 'character', 'so', 'selfless', 'so', 'caring', 'almost', 'boring', 'Depp', 'Gilbert', 'such', 'subtlety', 'almost', 'have', 'emotion', 'few', 'scenes', 'scene', 'where', 'Arnie', 'one', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'caused', 'sink', 'background', 'instead', 'allowing', 'happen', 'mentioned', 'Depp', 'strength', 'cast', 'mates', 'performances', 'propel', 'further', 'instead', 'drown', 'out.', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'tug', 'tear', 'ducts']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

Rather they are a loving one that hold together despite personal tragedy.  Director Lasse Hallstrom relates their story with the correct degree of understatement and virtually no sugar coating.  The film is aided by a superb cast.  Johnny Depp is stupendous as the taciturn title character who is the rock and support mechanism of the Grapes after the absence of the father.  Darlene Cates is a real find as the morbidly obese Momma.  Cates evokes the tragedy of her character with little pathos.  The best performance here comes from Leonardo DiCaprio as the mentally handicapped Arnie.  I cannot recall a performance in any other film where retardation was presented so realistically and it's even more amazing when considering DiCaprio's relative youth at the time.

He's got to take care of him.  He works in a grocery store.  His life is about groceries.  Honk if you've got groceries...He's trapped in Endora, somewhere, probably Kansas or Nebraska or Iowa (actually filmed in Texas), somewhere in the heart of the Heartland--by the way this is the sort of American film that plays as a foreign film in, say, France or Sweden.  Along comes Juliette Lewis who's a bit of a short-haired punk to his long-haired country (""Get in the car, longhair"").  He is wallowing in self-pity and she sees it.  ""What about you?"" she asks.  ""What do you want?""She attracts him and frightens him.  She may make him upset his predictable life as Job.  And then one day, he loses it and hits Arnie, and hits him again.  Who can blame him?

Gilbert is an America hero.  He knows the good and the bad, and he always tries to do the good.  But it's tough.  Life is an embarrassment and a boredom, and when it isn't boring, it's scary emotionally.  Depp is perfectly cast as a man whose loyalty to his family and his love for them has trapped him.  And they are using him, and they don't appreciate him.  His father disappeared.  His older brother is gone.  Gilbert has the responsibility.  And he knows it.  And he can't escape it.But it's hard, and when Becky comes along, she is something different.  She is something he's never seen before.  She isn't predictable, and she is striking.

359159,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6303124798,D. Litton,"[4, 4]","Some people will grumble about the excessive absence of anything spectacular in &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape,&quot; a slice of life comedy/drama that takes us to a place where no one is special, no one is famous, nothing is large-scale, and simple is all the rage. Nothing particularly interesting happens to the characters we meet, nothing explodes and no one gets shot at; life simply goes on.And that's the beauty of Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m's gloriously simplistic film: nothing gets in the way, allowing us to get to know the characters in ways that no other movie can provide. As the world of cinema expands, getting bigger and more complex everyday, &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; feels like a small miracle, a great American film that captures life at its most joyous and its most depressing.In one of the best performances of his career, Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape, a young man who can't seem to see the joy in his life. His career at the local market, a small mom-and-pop store that has seen suffering sales as a result of the new supermarket outside of town, is less than satisfying; he is having an affair with a married woman, who becomes scornful when Gilbert takes an interest in Becky (Juliette Lewis) a young girl traveling across the country with her grandmother in whom he sees a spark of the wonder of life.It is his family life, however, that becomes bothersome to him. His mother, who weighs 500 pounds and has not left the house in seven years, constantly puts him to work taking care of his brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who suffers from mental retardation. There are times when this family experiences moments of happiness, which is crossed with moments of angst and bickering, all of which builds up to the point that Gilbert cannot stand another minute of his family.And this is pretty much the plot of the movie; you may never find one more simplistic than this, or one more moving. There is a blunt truthfulness in its approaches to the issues of mental retardation and obesity: the other children of the town pick on Arnie for being different, and his mother's obesity, a result of depression from her husband's passing, is the talk of the town. Yet, these traits are embraced by the audience rather than made into an object of laughter: Arnie possesses a certain childlike charm that quickly catches on, while his mother is a warm-hearted, endearing woman with a gentle, maternal soul.The film's focus on the characters is in its favor, giving us a chance to get to know their lives and the frustrations they must face each day. For Gilbert, referring to his mother as a &quot;beached whale&quot; is an everyday thing, while putting up with Arnie's disappearing and climbing to the top of the town water tower is a regular event. In his face, we see the hidden angst, the wanting in him that cries out to break free and leave what he has known all of his life for something, anything different, though not necessarily better. He finds this in Becky, with whom he shares a warm relationship that opens his eyes and makes him realize that leaving his family behind is not the answer.These realizations and small glimpses of reality are brought to life under some striking performances, from a cast composed of stars and first-time actors. Depp brings out the subtle expressions and feelings of confusion and wanting in Gilbert with supreme impact; DiCaprio delivers equally powerful acting as Arnie, creating a character that we first want to consider annoying, but in the end, have come to care for. Newcomer Darlene Cates steals the show as Gilbert's mother, filling her with true emotional depth that gives us a reason to feel sorrow for her.With this talented cast and a story that gains its complexity from its simplicity, &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; is not a blockbuster or an epic, yet its juxtaposition of sorrow and happiness is endearing and warm, and its focus on people rather than spectacle is astounding. There is a subtle brilliance that bleeds from this film's story, one that is rarely seen in movies of today; any lover of good movies won't find a better film.",5,Finds its complexity within its simplicity.,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,4140,"['people', 'will', 'grumble', 'excessive', 'absence', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'quot', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'quot', 'slice', 'life', 'comedy/drama', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'special', 'one', 'famous', 'nothing', 'large-scale', 'simple', 'rage', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'happens', 'characters', 'meet', 'nothing', 'explodes', 'one', 'shot', 'life', 'simply', 'on.And', 'beauty', 'Lasse', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'gloriously', 'simplistic', 'film', 'nothing', 'way', 'allowing', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'ways', 'other', 'movie', 'can', 'provide', 'world', 'cinema', 'expands', 'getting', 'bigger', 'more', 'complex', 'everyday', 'quot', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'quot', 'feels', 'small', 'miracle', 'great', 'American', 'film', 'life', 'most', 'joyous', 'most', 'depressing.In', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'joy', 'life', 'career', 'local', 'market', 'small', 'mom-and-pop', 'store', 'seen', 'suffering', 'sales', 'result', 'new', 'supermarket', 'town', 'less', 'satisfying', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'scornful', 'when', 'Gilbert', 'interest', 'Becky', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'young', 'girl', 'traveling', 'country', 'grandmother', 'whom', 'spark', 'wonder', 'life.It', 'family', 'life', 'however', 'bothersome', 'mother', 'who', '500', 'pounds', 'not', 'left', 'house', 'seven', 'years', 'constantly', 'work', 'taking', 'care', 'brother', 'Arnie', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'mental', 'retardation', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'family', 'moments', 'happiness', 'crossed', 'moments', 'angst', 'bickering', 'point', 'Gilbert', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'minute', 'family.And', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'may', 'never', 'find', 'one', 'more', 'simplistic', 'one', 'more', 'moving', 'blunt', 'truthfulness', 'approaches', 'issues', 'mental', 'retardation', 'obesity', 'other', 'children', 'town', 'pick', 'Arnie', 'being', 'different', 'mother', 'obesity', 'result', 'depression', 'husband', 'passing', 'talk', 'town', 'traits', 'are', 'embraced', 'audience', 'rather', 'made', 'object', 'laughter', 'Arnie', 'certain', 'childlike', 'charm', 'quickly', 'mother', 'warm-hearted', 'endearing', 'woman', 'gentle', 'maternal', 'soul.The', 'film', 'focus', 'characters', 'favor', 'giving', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'lives', 'frustrations', 'must', 'face', 'day', 'Gilbert', 'referring', 'mother', 'quot', 'beached', 'whale', 'quot', 'everyday', 'thing', 'putting', 'up', 'Arnie', 'disappearing', 'climbing', 'top', 'town', 'water', 'tower', 'regular', 'event', 'face', 'see', 'hidden', 'angst', 'wanting', 'out', 'break', 'free', 'leave', 'what', 'known', 'life', 'something', 'anything', 'different', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'Becky', 'whom', 'shares', 'warm', 'relationship', 'eyes', 'realize', 'leaving', 'family', 'behind', 'not', 'answer.These', 'realizations', 'small', 'glimpses', 'reality', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'striking', 'performances', 'cast', 'composed', 'stars', 'first-time', 'actors', 'Depp', 'out', 'subtle', 'expressions', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'wanting', 'Gilbert', 'supreme', 'impact', 'DiCaprio', 'equally', 'powerful', 'acting', 'Arnie', 'creating', 'character', 'first', 'want', 'consider', 'annoying', 'end', 'have', 'come', 'care', 'Newcomer', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'show', 'Gilbert', 'mother', 'filling', 'true', 'emotional', 'depth', 'reason', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'her.With', 'talented', 'cast', 'story', 'gains', 'complexity', 'simplicity', 'quot', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'quot', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'epic', 'juxtaposition', 'sorrow', 'happiness', 'endearing', 'warm', 'focus', 'people', 'rather', 'spectacle', 'astounding', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'today', 'lover', 'good', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'film']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

He is so incredibly gifted, he has played different kinds of characters.  Straying from the stereotypes, he just shines in everything he does.Gilbert Grape lives in a small town, he has two younger sisters, a retarded brother, played brilliantly by Leonardo Dicaprio, and a morbidly obese mother.  Gilbert is the father figure in this film, and he has little chance to just be himself for awhile.  He always seems to be the one taking care of his brother, ARnie, while his sisters complain about him.  He is just going through life, working at the local grocery store, and fooling around with a married woman, played quite well by Mary Steenbergen.Then enter Becky, played cooly by Juliette Lewis.

359176,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303124798,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","One of these films that are an essential step in the career of an actor. It was true for Leonardo DiCaprio who got his first Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for the role of a differently-abled kid . It is true he does a good job in that part and he is a brilliant couple with Johnny Depp as his bigger brother. The film is entertaining though on many other levels. The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford.  On her disabled son's birthday, after having accepted to be introduced to her elder son's girl friend (a young woman who had to stop in Endora with her mother and their travelling bus for a couple of weeks because of the breakdown of the car they travel in), after climbing back up to the second floor bedroom of the house for the first time in many years and lying there on her back, she dies without any kind of pain or noise with her disabled son calling for her to wake up. The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too. That's what happens when a mechanical incident forces you to stop over in a lost village in the countryside for a couple of weeks. You get trapped in some kind of sentimental cage like the disabled brother's crickets in his glass jar where he raises them. A good decent softly entertaining film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Unpredictable DiCaprio,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3278,"['One', 'films', 'are', 'essential', 'step', 'career', 'actor', 'was', 'true', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'got', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'role', 'differently-abled', 'kid', 'true', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'brilliant', 'couple', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'bigger', 'brother', 'film', 'entertaining', 'many', 'other', 'levels', 'survival', 'small', 'town', 'US', 'time', 'when', 'big', 'shopping', 'malls', 'are', 'opening', 'everywhere', 'small', 'towns', 'are', 'doomed', 'die', 'sooner', 'later', 'only', 'chance', 'become', 'suburban', 'development', 'projects', 'become', 'home', 'people', 'working', 'big', 'city', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'want', 'live', 'away', 'hectic', 'activity', 'city', 'commute', 'there', 'day', 'are', 'development', 'Endora', 'second', 'interest', 'fate', 'family', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'child', 'Here', 'have', 'opportunity', 'provide', 'education', 'professional', 'activity', 'more', 'less', 'attached', 'member', 'family', 'haunting', 'not', 'even', 'worse', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'police', 'neighbors', 'never', 'vicious', 'really', 'bothering', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'peace', 'quiet', 'place', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'people', 'society', 'something', 'difficult', 'envisage', 'are', 'necessarily', 'burden', 'normative', 'people', 'normative', 'system', 'adapt', 'not', 'reverse', 'Today', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'lot', 'thanks', 'such', 'films', 'probably', 'definitely', 'Then', 'film', 'showing', 'mother', 'who', 'extremely', 'obese', 'person', 'shame', 'humiliation', 'lot', 'close', 'ordeal', 'film', 'how', 'dependent', 'own', 'family', 'own', 'children', 'father', 'having', 'died', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'tries', 'show', 'best', 'light', 'can', 'afford', 'disabled', 'son', 'birthday', 'having', 'accepted', 'be', 'introduced', 'elder', 'son', 'girl', 'friend', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'stop', 'Endora', 'mother', 'travelling', 'bus', 'couple', 'weeks', 'breakdown', 'car', 'travel', 'climbing', 'back', 'second', 'floor', 'bedroom', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'lying', 'there', 'back', 'kind', 'pain', 'noise', 'disabled', 'son', 'calling', 'wake', 'up', 'film', 'though', 'strange', 'ending', 'children', 'decide', 'burn', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'domestic', 'pyre', 'mother', 'complete', 'liberation', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'scattered', 'away', 'now', 'are', 'homeless', 'burial', 'old', 'civilizations', 'Hinduist', 'tradition', 'Amazing', 'yet', 'not', 'end', 'last', 'scene', 'how', 'elder', 'brother', 'recuperated', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'back', 'pick', 'up', 'away', 'Endora', 'picking', 'one', 'two', 'disabled', 'brother', 'along', 'too', 'what', 'when', 'mechanical', 'incident', 'forces', 'stop', 'over', 'lost', 'village', 'countryside', 'couple', 'weeks', 'get', 'trapped', 'kind', 'sentimental', 'cage', 'disabled', 'brother', 'crickets', 'glass', 'jar', 'where', 'good', 'decent', 'softly', 'entertaining', 'film.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

Included among his additional sufferings Gilbert must endure is his obese mother, who blames her huge weight problem on her husband's death. His two sisters add to his burden as does an unfaithful wife and traveling woman in a streamline trailer. Gilbert endures the given facts of his dull, uneventful and nondescript life with seemingly limitless patience. He further accepts the troubling circumstances of his half-wit brother who persistently seeks the summits of a city water tower. His world drifts from tedium to tedium until finally it explodes with an unexpected but understandable rage. Somewhere in the aftermath, Gilbert discovers a renewed compassion, a soul saving reason for continuing his existence and the dark root of his mother's weighty affliction. Gilbert saves her humiliation with a modicum of dignity.

He lives with a grossly overweight mom, a former local beauty who started overeating when her husband died years before.

My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, gave one heck of a performance as the loner Gilbert, who has so much responsibility: his mentally disabled brother Arnie, brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo diCaprio, his two sisters, his morbidly obese mother (one excellent performance by Darlene Cates).  The movie basically centers around Gilbert and his dysfunctional family and all the problems they're having, and how their mom hadn't left the house for over 7 years, and how Gilbert had to work a lot to be able to feed her and the family.  Grape was so moving, just so realistic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, however, is because the special features only have the theatrical trailer.  I thought this DVD screamed extras!  I really would've liked to see interviews with the cast, director, producer, etc, especially with Leo for his very demanding character.  I would've liked to see how he had to prepare for that role, because he was just so magnificent and so believable, so deserving of the Oscar nod.

Particularly troubling is Depp's younger brother, brilliantly portrayed by Leo DiCaprio, whose main hobbies include running away, climbing trees, and attempting to scale the town watertower.

Gilbert (Johnny Depp) feels trapped: his younger brother, a high maintenance problem is mentally challenged (in a brilliant acting job by Leonardo Di Caprio), his mother is reclusive and grossly overweight at 500 pounds, he's in a deadend job in a small grocery store trying to compete with a giant supermarket, he's fooling around with a married woman (beautifully played by Mary Steenburger), and he's stuck in the deadened small town of Endora which equals Endure. DiCaprio's character loves to climb water towers, trees, roofs, and it's challenging to keep an eye on him.Gilbert's problems are too much for any one man to handle, but he finds love in a girl who is trapped in town when her truck-pulling trailer breaks down. Pick-up trucks are almost characters in this flick.The 1993 movie is blessed by an unusually large number of individual three-dimensional character studies. Minor roles are fleshed out, and real people emerge. It's a film that doesn't try to sugarcoat or look for easy solutions. At the beginning Gilbert shows some mean streaks in his attitude toward his mother, but the developing story brings out tenderness and love. It has its comic moments, its sad bits, but manages to keep the audience involved. The family's father is gone, and Gilbert is standing in for him, up to his hips in mire.

The Grapes of WrathEach time I watch 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' I am transported in memory to the small town in which I was raised on the Western border of the panhandle of Idaho, population: pert near 90; almost all related one way or another. My uncle, four years younger than I, was diagnosed with several physical anomalies shortly after birth. Within a year or two, it became apparent that he was learning disabled. He tolerated several surgeries on his eyes and legs, and having seven older siblings giving him all kinds of attention, he thrived. Our small town became his little sovereign nation, of sorts, as did the Grape family and their house in the country. A sort of soft isolation which protects and nurtures can be a great defense for a while, at least. Eventually, though, the outside world must be allowed its chance to either toughen us up or do its damage. Arnie, Gilbert's affected brother, played brilliantly by Leo DiCaprio, and their mother each have issues away from the safety of home. Bonnie, having eaten herself to enormity after her husband abandons the family, so to speak, finds it very difficult both physically and emotionally to leave her house. Arnie, on the other hand, loves to take off with Gilbert whenever possible or flee into town and climb the water tower at will, regardless of consequences. Then, there is sister Ellen, a handful, who also lives at home. This leaves Gilbert, a teenager, toting a bulging load. Relief comes in the form of Becky, Juliette Lewis, who befriends Gilbert and becomes a conduit, bringing hope and dreams back to life for him.This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The power behind this picture is in the alchemic synergy of Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio so closely paired in this great project. So many viewers have lauded DiCaprio for the genius he brought to his role, but without Depp's unique talent to receive and react...I don't know.To sum it all up, as Gilbert puts a bandage on Arnie, he asks him, ""And why am I going to make it better?""Arnie replies, ""Cause you are Gilbert.""""Cause I am Gilbert,"" his brother reassures.Pure gold!",5,Grapes and Grit...,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,2241,"['souls', 'people', 'grapes', 'wrath', 'are', 'filling', 'growing', 'heavy', 'growing', 'heavy', 'vintage', 'Grapes', 'WrathEach', 'time', 'watch', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'am', 'transported', 'memory', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'raised', 'Western', 'border', 'panhandle', 'Idaho', 'population', 'pert', '90', 'almost', 'related', 'one', 'way', 'uncle', 'four', 'years', 'younger', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'several', 'physical', 'anomalies', 'shortly', 'birth', 'year', 'two', 'became', 'apparent', 'was', 'learning', 'disabled', 'tolerated', 'several', 'surgeries', 'eyes', 'legs', 'having', 'seven', 'older', 'siblings', 'giving', 'kinds', 'attention', 'thrived', 'small', 'town', 'became', 'little', 'sovereign', 'nation', 'sorts', 'did', 'Grape', 'family', 'house', 'country', 'sort', 'soft', 'isolation', 'nurtures', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'defense', 'while', 'least', 'Eventually', 'outside', 'world', 'must', 'be', 'allowed', 'chance', 'toughen', 'up', 'do', 'damage', 'Arnie', 'Gilbert', 'affected', 'brother', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'mother', 'have', 'issues', 'away', 'safety', 'home', 'Bonnie', 'having', 'eaten', 'enormity', 'husband', 'family', 'so', 'speak', 'very', 'difficult', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'leave', 'house', 'Arnie', 'other', 'hand', 'take', 'off', 'Gilbert', 'whenever', 'possible', 'flee', 'town', 'climb', 'water', 'tower', 'will', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'Then', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'handful', 'who', 'also', 'home', 'Gilbert', 'teenager', 'toting', 'bulging', 'load', 'Relief', 'form', 'Becky', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'who', 'Gilbert', 'conduit', 'bringing', 'hope', 'dreams', 'back', 'life', 'him.This', 'far', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'power', 'picture', 'alchemic', 'synergy', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'so', 'closely', 'paired', 'great', 'project', 'So', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'lauded', 'DiCaprio', 'genius', 'brought', 'role', 'Depp', 'unique', 'talent', 'receive', 'react', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Gilbert', 'bandage', 'Arnie', 'why', 'am', 'going', 'make', 'better', 'Arnie', 'replies', 'are', 'Gilbert', 'Cause', 'am', 'Gilbert', 'brother', 'reassures.Pure', 'gold']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

Take my favorite director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules (Miramax Collector's Series),Casanova) and Oscar winning screenplay writer Peter Hedges (About a Boy (Widescreen Edition), andPieces of April...he always writes, with great tenderness, very conflicted characters!), and VOILA, you have a look back in time when the ""great ones"" were still yet to reach their pinnacle of success!GILBERT GRAPE has ALL the earmarks of that greatness to come.First off, if you have no patience with intimate films that have deliberate character development and no action, you may want to pass.If you relish great acting and a rising action story line, then read on!Gilbert is the second son of five on whom his entire family hangs! The oldest son flew the coup, the father committed suicide, the mother is a depressed obese and, the youngest son is a retarded boy who was not supposed to live, and the two sisters seem to have their own issues in life.Gilbert (expertly crafted by Depp) is the model of restraint and co-dependent behaviour as he cares for all of his family.But what is eating at Gilbert? He should be exploding any minute, but his feelings seem so repressed as he runs after his younger brother (DiCaprio- who received an Oscar nom),helps to deal with his Mother's depression and 500 pound+ obesity and also work in a dead end job as a grocery store stock boy.In fact, the only sign that Gilbert has any life in him, is when he delivers groceries to an older and married housewife (Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen,as only she could deliver this performance!)where Gilbert finds himself somewhat entrapped,but afraid to let go.Enter Becky, a passer-through Airstream trailer girl whose rig breaks down in Endora.It is this relationship that awakens Gilbert and the rest of the family to confront all of the repressed and suppressed feelings as a family that somehow functions.Every performance in this film is A+ and should be viewed for the quality of acting and adeptness at direction and screenplay.The Special Edition has wonderful interviews with the cast and director that give perspective of people who can now look back at the film and examine it with fresh perspective.One of the best Special Editions on DVD and well worth the $$$.",5,"Excellent Edition**GET IT** See the ""greats"" before they became so!",1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2875,"['What', 'now', 'so', 'wonderful', 'revisiting', 'WHAT', 'EATING', 'GILBERT', 'GRAPE', 'several', 'years', 'see', 'multi', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performers', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'when', 'were', 'road', 'stardom.WHAT', ""'S"", 'EATING', 'GILBERT', 'GRAPE', 'one', 'incredible', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'pieces', 'required', 'JUST', 'right', 'kind', 'actors.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Depp', 'DiCaprio', 'Lewis', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'been', 'listed', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'intriguing', 'actors', '.This', 'greatness', 'heart', 'touching', '1993', 'look', 'confused', 'repressed', 'quirky', 'people', 'dead', 'Texas', 'town', 'called', 'Endora', 'Take', 'favorite', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'Miramax', 'Collector', 'Series', 'Casanova', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'Boy', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andPieces', 'April', 'always', 'great', 'tenderness', 'very', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'VOILA', 'have', 'look', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'great', 'ones', 'were', 'still', 'yet', 'reach', 'pinnacle', 'success', 'GILBERT', 'GRAPE', 'earmarks', 'greatness', 'come.First', 'off', 'have', 'patience', 'intimate', 'films', 'have', 'deliberate', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'may', 'want', 'pass.If', 'relish', 'great', 'acting', 'rising', 'action', 'story', 'line', 'then', 'read', 'Gilbert', 'second', 'son', 'five', 'whom', 'entire', 'family', 'hangs', 'oldest', 'son', 'flew', 'coup', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'mother', 'depressed', 'obese', 'youngest', 'son', 'retarded', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'live', 'two', 'sisters', 'seem', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'life.Gilbert', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'Depp', 'model', 'restraint', 'co-dependent', 'behaviour', 'family.But', 'what', 'eating', 'Gilbert', 'should', 'be', 'exploding', 'minute', 'feelings', 'seem', 'so', 'repressed', 'younger', 'brother', 'DiCaprio-', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'deal', 'Mother', 'depression', '500', 'pound+', 'obesity', 'also', 'work', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'grocery', 'store', 'stock', 'boy.In', 'fact', 'only', 'sign', 'Gilbert', 'life', 'when', 'groceries', 'older', 'married', 'housewife', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'only', 'could', 'deliver', 'performance', 'where', 'Gilbert', 'somewhat', 'entrapped', 'afraid', 'let', 'go.Enter', 'Becky', 'passer-through', 'Airstream', 'trailer', 'girl', 'rig', 'down', 'Endora.It', 'relationship', 'Gilbert', 'rest', 'family', 'confront', 'repressed', 'suppressed', 'feelings', 'family', 'somehow', 'functions.Every', 'performance', 'film', 'A+', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'quality', 'acting', 'adeptness', 'direction', 'screenplay.The', 'Special', 'Edition', 'wonderful', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'give', 'perspective', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'now', 'look', 'back', 'film', 'examine', 'fresh', 'perspective.One', 'best', 'Special', 'Editions', 'DVD', 'well']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

As the mentally retarded Arnie, Leonardo DiCaprio turns in an incredibly realistic performance; his gestures, his often repetitive speech...everything about his acting seems so perfect for the role he plays. (And I say this as one who has worked with the mentally retarded). It is no wonder he received an Oscar nomination. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Johnny Depp's character, Gilbert who despite his deep love for Arnie is still frustrated by the limitations that caring for Arnie places on his life. Top that off with a morbidly obese mother whom Gilbert is (reluctantly) ashamed of and a younger sister who is an oftentimes irritating troublemaker and you can see why Gilbert sometimes yearns for life to be a little easier. As a clerk in the local grocery store, Gilbert has fallen into a relationship with an older married woman (played by Mary Steenburgen) but finds himself drawn to a new girl in town (Juliette Lewis) with whom he develops a friendly, then caring relationship. Strained relations with the town's law enforcement officials ensue after Arnie repeatedly climbs the water tower and Arnie is arrested. Gilbert's mother played by Darlene Cates) who hasn't left the house in seven years, takes matters into her own hands and the results are at once triumphant and tragic. Depp is marvelous as Gilbert. His sense of despair and self hatred after he loses control and hits Arnie seem totally realistic and understandable. The younger sister who seems like such a brat at the beginning becomes more humanized as we see her vulnerability. The mother's battle with shame and humiliation over her obesity makes us all more attuned to our own shameful insensitivity. Quirky, no doubt, sad - no doubt again. But ultimately, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" turns out to be a testament to love, caring and family loyalty.

This is the first movie I associated with Johnny Depp, and he didnt let me down.We have Gilbert, basically stuck in a bad situation, working at a grocery store, having an affair, constantly having to answer for why his mentally ill brother is climbing the water tower or eating the cake in the fridge. If his brother gets in trouble, then his mother has to come into town to bail him out, which is more of an embarrassment for Gilbert because his mother is very overweight. The movie is very sad, and you will find yourself crying through a few parts of it.

If you've seen Titanic, and a couple of his other movie roles, you'll be really shocked, that he can play a totally different role. He's not a pretty-boy as he normally is.It's never really explained what's the matter with Leo's character, Arnie. He has a lot of different characteristics which relate to different special needs people. I tend to think he's autistic, but he never comes across as especially autistic. So it does get a bit confusing.There is a really powerful connection between Johnny Depp's character, Gilbert, and Arnie. Gilbert is really protective of his younger brother, and ashamed by everyone else in his family. This relationship comes to a terrific climax later in the movie, which will shock everyone who's enjoyed their relationship up until then.Juliette Lewis plays the girl Gilbert falls in love with, and who he gives up his older, married lover for. Most people in other reviews I've read don't seem to like her character, but I do. She was great for the part, and although I wasn't keen on her too short hair, I loved everything else about her role.Darlene Cates plays the abnormally obese mother, who hasn't stepped out of the house in 7 years, until Arnie gets arrested. I'm not sure whether the sheer size of her was for real, or whether it was body padding/suit kinda thing.

It focuses on the Grapes, a rather unusual, but disturbingly realistic, family.  Johnny Depp gives a marvelous performance as Gilbert, the ""father figure"" to his mentally retarded brother, an amazingly brilliant Leonardo diCaprio.  There is so much love and frustration conveyed in the scenes these two megastars inhabit, and considering it was before they became superstars, it's a credit to these young men's acting abilities.  The film is fleshed out with remarkable supporting turns from John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover as Gilbert's buddies; Mary Steenburgen as the flirtatious housewife who makes sure she gets ""special deliveries"" from Gilbert; Kevin Tighe as Steenburgen's hyper insurance salesman husband; Juliette Lewis as the young girl who brings Gilbert into his own world; and of course, Darlene Cates, who plays Gilbert's morbidly obese mother---a self-imposed recluse who sits in her sofa, eating and watching TV, a brilliant performance for a woman who had never acted before.  The film's tragic tone is softened by some scenes of hilarity, and the ending is truly a sad, but effective, one.

359214,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6303124798,Mike Stone,"[66, 73]","Set in the fictional town of Endora, Illinois (quite a pregnant name for a city), ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" focuses on the down but not yet out Grape family: a mother (Darlene Cates) who weighs over 500 pounds, two sisters (Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt) with enough bottled up anger to drown a desert town, a mentally retarded brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who's about to turn 18 despite assurances that he'd never live a third that long, and Gilbert (Johnny Depp), the glue that holds them all together.  The burdens of the family, be they running errands in his truck or bathing his brother, all fall on Gilbert's shoulders.  The purpose of this particular story is to find out what happens when that burden is too heavy a weight to bear.Everyone in the film is constantly expecting a lot from Gilbert.  Whether it's the plea from his momma that he's ""gotta do better"", the complaints from his sisters that he never does anything (when in fact, he does everything), or the selfishness of the married woman (Mary Steenburgen) with whom he's having an unfulfilling affair, Gilbert can't seem to ever be good enough.  Contrast this with the just-happy-to-be-here existence of Arnie, who blithely tells anyone that will listen, ""I can go at anytime.""  It's a wonder that Gilbert ever has the strength to go on.But go on he does, using just as much effort to keep the family together as he does repressing his own anger.  The film's title is ironic, in that Gilbert shows little anguish; it just appears that something is ""eating"" at him.  It's a rather benign description of his state of mind, but on the surface it works quite well.  For the most part, he vents his anger in passively destructive ways.  One early scene features a couple of kids standing by the side of the road, staring at the Grape house.  When Gilbert sees them, he motions one over.  All the kid wants to do is get a gander at the 500 pound woman inside, and Gilbert resignedly obliges, even going so far as lifting the kid up so he can see through the window.  It's a very mean moment from a young man who is angelic by most accounts.  But when he lets loose of his control, when his primal nature comes out, the anger and violence and wrath and fear is very apparent.The actors are uniformly good, with a few who should be pointed out for special recognition.Darlene Cates, who legend has it was discovered after an appearance on ""The Sally Jessy Raphael"" show, plays Momma.  It was important for the story that Momma not be played by an actor in a fat suit; the audience needs to be as repulsed by her as the townspeople are.  But it is equally important that the audience comes to understand her plight, and feel for the woman.  Cates is authentic looking, and, more importantly, authentic acting.  The pathos of Momma is apparent in every defeated sigh.  And when she's called on for anger, as she is in one pivotal scene where she makes the terrifying choice to leave the house, it's painfully real.Leonardo DiCaprio, in the years since this film came out, has polarized moviegoers in to two camps.  There are those who swoon at the mere mention of his name, ""Titanic""-philes and Tiger Beaters all.  And there are those turn up their noses at the pretty boy actor, who will always be more style than substance.  Neither of these groups will enjoy what Leo does in ""Gilbert Grape"".  They may have to scrub clean all benefits of hindsight, or at the very least time travel back to 1993, to fully enjoy his performance.  And oh what a performance it is.  Common wisdom states that roles with physical or mental challenges, despite being the most often praised, are actually the easiest to play.  Actors develop a series of ticks, and voila!  A character!  Leo, to his credit, is more than just a collection of ticks as Arnie.  Sure, he's got messy hair, dirty fingernails, a nose in constant need of wiping, and a primal scream laugh.  But he so disappears into his character, that any preconceptions you might have about the actor get lost, and a character fully emerges.  It's a seamless and highly endearing performance.As poignant as Cates is, and as flashy and sublime as DiCaprio is, it is Depp who holds the movie together.  He has to play Gilbert close to the chest for the most part, relying more on his facial expressions rather than on the sparse dialogue to communicate what the character is all about.  It's not an outwardly remarkable performance, but it is supremely effective.  He gets drawn out of his shell, bit by bit, when Becky shows up.  Becky, Juliette Lewis in star-child mode, is a perfect contrast to Gilbert.  She's open and honest and willing to let others in.  Lewis is charming here, a trait she doesn't get to show often enough.  She and Depp have fine chemistry together, as they try to feel their way through young love.But for most of the movie Depp plays a kind of straight man to DiCaprio's goofball antics.  They have a wonderful chemistry together, for not only do they mine some restrained comedy from these scenes, but they also ably portray a strong brotherly bond.  Gilbert will care for Arnie till the day he dies; Arnie loves and trusts Gilbert, even if he has not the mental capacity to understand why.Lasse Hallstrom has a wise knack for silences, not just in the performances, where silence is golden, but also in the film's musical score.  For the most part, except for some light piano work in the most important moments, everything is quiet and still.  Which perfectly mimics the solitude of the small town, in which this heartbreaking, but ultimately life-affirming story, takes place.",5,The Grape Of Repressed Wrath,1028246400,"08 2,

The acting is perfect, especially Johnny Depp (never fails to turn in a great performance) and Leonardo DiCaprio (my brother has Autism and I don't know how a young Leo pulled it off).

His brother (Leonardo DiCaprio) is mentally challenged, his mother (Darlene Cates) is morbidly obese, his youngest sister is a brat, there is also a house wife (Mary Steenburgen) who orders groceries from the store Gilbert works at, she has reasons of her own that does not include the need for food. She's quite capable of going to the supermarket herself. Let's just say she has more than a little thing for Gilbert. Gilbert's father passed away years earlier. Now only himself and the older sister seem able to take care of the home and family. I would like to mention that actress Darlene Cates has lost over 200 lbs. since this film was made. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a wonderful, funny, sad and off beat drama that is sure to have something for everyone. I think it was very silly for one reviewer to say that this film makes fun of obesity and mentally impaired people. Are we not ever to have these types of characters in movies? I'm not sure if this person watched the entire film. It does have a positive message about these issues. This film doesn't make fun it only points out ignorance in people who do. When you see an overweight person do you stare at them? What if they are very overweight? I really liked the scene when Gilbert's mother said &quot;I haven't always been like this.&quot; and Becky (Juliette Lewis) said &quot;I haven't always been like this either.&quot; As if Becky didn't even notice that Gilbert's mother was of a beyond plus size. I myself work with mentally challenged kids everyday so Arnie just seemed like a kid to me. But in reality I have to say Leonardo DiCaprio was superb. On a less superb note however the DVD has zero extras. Well I guess if you wanna call having a theatrical trailer an extra feature go right ahead. I think a few featurettes and a director commentary is a must now days. Other than the lacks of DVD features this is a must purchase.

It sounds like a bad Nickelodeon show for pre-k kids. I would bet that three times as many people would have seen this movie if it had had a better title.WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, really, is a sensitive look at a family that doesn't like its own members. They don't hate each other, but each member is in its own little orbit that happens to revolve in the same house. The eldest child, Gilbert (one of Depp's best early roles), however is burdened the most. His impulse to establish himself and go after his own needs are one of the hinges of the plot. Fatherless Gilbert and his sister are left to feed themselves and their quarter-ton mother; no easy task. The mentally challenged younger brother Arnie (frighteningly well played by DiCaprio) compounds Gilbert's already growing list of responsibilities. In a strange but not illogical way, he is also responsible, unwillingly, to satisfy the carnal urges of a local housewife.It seems that everything in Gilbert's world has come to a deadly stop: his mother doesn't leave the couch; he can't leave his dead-end job (the only other potential for employment is the brand new mega-burger diner); he has no love interest; and the passing through of hundreds of hundreds of motor homes on their way to some vacation Mecca is the only source of entertainment in town. Only Arnie seems to be able, in his own way, to communicate the need to get out--he climbs the town's water tower on an almost weekly basis. He knows he has to get out. Only Gilbert can talk him down, as if Arnie wants to share with his brother the desire for escape.When one of the campers in the convoy breaks down, Gilbert finds his love interest (Juliette Lewis in a quiet but convincing portrayal) dropped on his lap. Her presence in town and its effect on Gilbert set everything on its ear. Gilbert starts asserting himself--to the point of dangerously neglecting Arnie. The seductive housewife inherits her husband's money--the husband, by the way, dies in the strangest way--and leaves Gilbert to the girl. And mother decides she will finally get off the couch and go sleep in her own bed. And then even more things are set off.There's too much to tell. The point is that WHAT'S EATING GILBERT is one of those films where all the elements blend together seamlessly to create a perfect, mature film.

Gilbert is a young adult who lives with his morbidly obese mother Bonnie, his adult sister Amy, his teenaged sister Ellen, and his mentally challenged younger brother Arnie. Gilbert's older brother ""got away"" and his father is deceased (the details I'll leave out because they are important to the story).Not much happens in Endora, Iowa, and not much ever will, to paraphrase Gilbert, until a series of events culminate on Arnie's eighteenth birthday.The acting in this film is above par, especially that of Johnny Depp as Gilbert and Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie. This was an early role for DiCaprio, before his Titanic fame, and it is in my opinion his best work to date. Whereas DiCaprio is able to play Arnie's emotions candidly and outlandishly, Depp plays the multidimensional, introspective Gilbert with subtlety, revealing his emotions through his facial expressions and his voice in a way that allows the audience to experience his feelings of frustration and bewilderment, feelings that occasionally brim over.

It has a lot of symbolic value.  Mr. Grape married the prettiest girl in town, and fathered the kids in the movie, but the house is not stable, and the family is not stable.  The family is left to survive in the house his dad built on a careless, wrongly-built foundation.  The mother hides inside the house built by the father, who hanged himself.  Just like the house is being held together by the inept efforts of young Gilbert, nailing up little pieces of wood down in the basement, so is the family.  The book reveals more than the movie that Gilbert's buddy, who helps with the basement, is kind of fixated with Gilbert's mom.  Gilbert's buddy, as well as the town's policeman is attracted to her, the image of the prettiest girl in town going to ruin.  Poor Gilbert is doing the best he can, and Johnny Depp does a great job portraying the heroic efforts of this better than average young man.  DeCaprio is equally great as Depp's younger, mentally handicapped brother, who ties Gilbert to his dying home town, his job at a dying grocery store, and his crumbling house.  Notice how Arnie keeps trying to climb?  The water tower has a lot of symbolic value, too.  This movie is almost too good to be a movie.

I think the Amazon reviewer said something about this should have been the movie he won an award for five years before Titanic and I could not agree more. This movie touches on some difficult issues like dealing with someone who is mentally challenged, a woman so obese and depressed she confines herself to a couch while Johnny Depp as Gilbert Grape, who helps care for his two sisters and Arni (DiCaprio) his retarded brother. Gilbert actually encourages the kids in the town to look in the window at his morbidly obese mother. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a movie that will make you cry, laugh, think and feel.

Saturen,"[2, 2]","What's Eating Gilbert Grape captures the lives and inner struggles of its characters with a rare tenderness and realism, thanks in part to truly shining performances on the part of its cast. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular, plays to perfection the role of Arnie, a mentally handicapped teenager, immersing himself in the character with stunning talent. The focus of the film is Gilbert (played by Johnny Depp), a young man in an isolated, rural community who suppresses his own hopes and desires out of loyalty to a family he alternately views as a burden and a blessing. His selfless devotion becomes increasingly unbearable when the free-spirited Becky (Juliette Lewis) appears in his life, then prepares to leave the town where Gilbert is anchored. As his lifelong self-denial becomes harder to maintain, Gilbert neglects and lashes out at his younger brother, but his genuine love for his brother remains undying, as does his devotion to his mother, of whom he is sometimes ashamed because of her extreme obesity. Darlene Cates gives a beautiful, heartfelt performance as Bonnie Grape despite the fact she is not a professional actress, perhaps because of her identification with the character (Cates, who weighs 500 pounds, was chosen for the part after her appearance on Sally Jessie Raphael, where she described being imprisoned by her weight). Although Bonnie's weight makes her the laughing stock of the small town, her love for her children prompts her to gather her courage and leave the house for the first time in years after Arnie is taken in by the police for climbing a water tank.This is a film laden with unusual sensitivity and remarkable acting, treating its theme with nuance, complexity, and tenderness.",5,Beautiful Movie with Heartfelt Performances,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,1726,"['What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'lives', 'inner', 'struggles', 'characters', 'rare', 'tenderness', 'realism', 'thanks', 'part', 'truly', 'shining', 'performances', 'part', 'cast', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'particular', 'perfection', 'role', 'Arnie', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'teenager', 'immersing', 'character', 'stunning', 'talent', 'focus', 'film', 'Gilbert', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'young', 'man', 'isolated', 'rural', 'community', 'who', 'own', 'hopes', 'loyalty', 'family', 'alternately', 'burden', 'blessing', 'selfless', 'devotion', 'increasingly', 'unbearable', 'when', 'free-spirited', 'Becky', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'life', 'then', 'leave', 'town', 'where', 'Gilbert', 'anchored', 'lifelong', 'self-denial', 'becomes', 'harder', 'maintain', 'Gilbert', 'neglects', 'out', 'younger', 'brother', 'genuine', 'love', 'brother', 'undying', 'devotion', 'mother', 'whom', 'sometimes', 'ashamed', 'extreme', 'obesity', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Bonnie', 'Grape', 'fact', 'not', 'professional', 'actress', 'perhaps', 'identification', 'character', 'Cates', 'who', '500', 'pounds', 'was', 'chosen', 'part', 'appearance', 'Sally', 'Jessie', 'Raphael', 'where', 'described', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'weight', 'Bonnie', 'weight', 'laughing', 'stock', 'small', 'town', 'love', 'children', 'gather', 'courage', 'leave', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'Arnie', 'taken', 'police', 'climbing', 'water', 'tank.This', 'film', 'laden', 'unusual', 'sensitivity', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'treating', 'theme', 'nuance', 'complexity', 'tenderness']",What's Eating Gilbert Grape VHS

Perhaps the most moving performance in this movie is played by Darlene Cates.  She plays the part of an incredibly obese woman who is the mother of a poor, dysfunctional family.
