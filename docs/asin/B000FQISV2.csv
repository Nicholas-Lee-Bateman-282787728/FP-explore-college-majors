994255,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FQISV2,A Customer,"[26, 33]","With all intents and purposes, On A Clear Day should be a terrific movie - the acting is strong, the direction is polished and the stark Glasgow, Dover, and Isle of Man landscapes also help toughen up the mood. Then why was my reaction to the movie so lukewarm? Perhaps it's because On A Clear Day is a retread of so much that has come before it.Like a waterlogged and less persuasive iteration of The Full Monty, director Gaby Dellal's movie is another the tale of working-class heroes, the salt of the earth who lose their jobs but, by taking on a seemingly impracticable, even outlandish challenge, maintain their self-respect, and even get to squelch the ghosts of their past.In this case, it's the - admittedly quite brilliant Peter Mullen - playing a retrenched ship builder who decides to swim the English Channel. At the same time he gets to tackle with estrangement with Rob, his adult son (Jamie Sives) and deal with issues of honesty with Joan his late middle-aged Scottish wife (Brenda Blethyn).Frank (Mullen) just doesn't know what to do with himself after he gets laid off from the Glasgow shipbuilding company. Understandably upset Frank and his former colleagues spend their newly empty days facing the indignities of the employment offices, visiting bemused members of their extended families and swimming out their frustrations down at the city pool.In fact, doing the daily laps becomes Frank's only source of consolation and with all this free time on his hands he decides at age fifty-five swimming the English Channel is a way to move on from his past. Frank is haunted by a tragedy involving a son he lost to the sea when the lad was seven and his relationship with his grown son Rob (Sives) is almost nonexistent, so Frank's decision to swim the Channel is a way of winning his heart back into the family.The storyline is slight, almost textbook in its inexorableness and the film is riddled with clich&eacute;'s. Also, Frank's aspiration - while no doubt admirable, doesn't make a lot of sense.  If he wants to remake himself in the eyes of his family, he could hardly have chosen a more isolating pastime, and it is hardly going to help his family. It's also uncertain how he pays the bills while he spends every day at the pool. And why does he inexplicably lie to both his son and his wife?Brenda Blethyn as Joan and Jamie Sives as Rob are both excellent in their supporting roles, but the subplots involving their characters seem tacked on, underwritten and ultimately rather trivial. All she wants is to learn to drive a bus. Of course, these are working-class people, but a movie needs a little more oomph than the dream of getting a bus license.And likewise, Rob is supposed to be a stay-at-home dad - and the scenes where he's shown lovingly caring for his young twins - are indeed touching, but his conflict over not working is never really developed as well as it should be. Similarly, Frank's assortment of kooky, diffident friends are all served up as sort of stock stereotypes; of course they're loveable, but we've seen them all before in other similarly themed English films.I guess the main reason to watch On A Clear Day is Peter Mullen's quite affecting and subtle performance as Frank. He's a crusty, sexy salt of the earth type, a man who has spent much of his life punching the clock with a time card. He's well and truly been imbued with the protestant work ethic and a kind of obstinate pride. Mullen delicately lets you see how Frank was able to push unhappy thoughts of his dead son from his mind as long as he was working, but with too much time on his hands, he is forced to confront these long buried emotions.In the end, On A Clear day does attempt to make some pertinent social observations about following your dreams into late middle age, the effects of redundancy and unemployment, and the benefits of never giving up. But the film does this in such a trite, corny and predicable way that certain scenes feel as though they have been padded out to the point of distraction, and it almost feels as though the film as a whole is threatening to swim away from you.

This wee, warm Scottish flick does a great job balancing out comedy and melancholy, with a bit of family strife thrown in. It's just a small-scale, sweet little film.A Scottish shipyard is laying off workers, and Frank (Peter Mullan) suddenly finds himself without a job. His wife Joan (Brenda Blethyn) starts training to be a bus driver, and his relationship with his son Rob (Jamie Sives) remains chilly, as it has been ever since his other son's death. Frank becomes increasingly depressed and antsy, unsure what to do next.But while on a ""booze cruise"" with his friends, inspiration strikes -- he'll swim the Channel. He keeps his plans a secret from his family, but allows Chinese-Scot Chan (Benedict Wong) to be his trainer, with his pals as moral support. But his secret alienates his wife and son even further, and as he faces the biggest swim of his life, Frank will have to overcome his worst, most haunting memories of the sea.""One Clear Day"" is basically a heartwarming little family dramedy, which avoids the usual cliches and schmaltz, even in scenes where it could have easily become goopy. It takes a pretty talented director to handle things like government layoffs and racism without being heavy-handed, or dealing with emotional trauma without being soppy about it.The plot seems even more colourful against the grey skies and seas of Scotland -- there are sad flashbacks and some melancholy moments, but Dellal balances it out with kooky good-ol'-lads comedy, such as Danny joyously careening around on a tiny motoboat. And the dialogue is nothing short of hilarious, whether it's bawdy jokes or banter (""Shark. Thirty-five footer."" ""Fell off my bike. Two-wheeler!"").Mullan has a very challenging role -- his character has repressed his grief, and doesn't want to let anyone see his problems. So Frank is gruff, secretive, but has moments of unbridled delight. Blethyn and Sives round out the family beautifully, as Frank's loving wife and emotionally starved son -- the beach scene with the three of them is enchanting.But the supporting cast is also great -- Jodhi May has a small, good role as Rob's wife, and Ron Cook and Sean McGinley are snappily solid as two of Frank's pals. And Billy Boyd simply steals every scene he's in, as the perpetually upbeat, charmingly troublesome Danny. But comedy isn't his only skill: his best scene would have to be when Danny sadly confesses that he's always wanted to be like Frank.""On A Clear Day"" is a sweet, small Scottish movie with plenty of heart and joking-around, and the ability to warm your heart without turning your stomach.

Writer Alex Rose and Director Gaby Dellal have managed to explore the psyches of the ordinary folk who face the crises of unemployment, of strained family relations and the fear of loss of pride in one's self and have created not only a sympathetic story with a message, but have also delivered their story with humor and a glint of the eye that makes the whole thing work - very well indeed.Frank (Peter Mullen) watches as the last ship he will ever have worked on is launched as his wife Joan (Brenda Blethyn) and his son Rob (Jamie Sives), daughter in law Angela (Johdi May), and grandson twins celebrate the launching.  We soon learn that Frank is now jobless, that there is friction with his son Rob (who had been a twin but the other twin died at age 7) who doesn't have a traditional job but instead is a stay at home Dad.  Money is tight and Joan secretly is training to be a bus driver.  Franks cronies Eddie (Sean McGinley), Danny (Billy Boyd), and Norman (Ron Cook) see Frank slipping into depression.  Frank spends his time swimming at the public swimming pool and while there he sees three young physically challenged boys trying and by will power succeeding to swim.  Frank decides he needs to prove himself to his friends, family and himself and decides to swim the English Channel.  He enlists his buddy Chan (Benedict Wong) and eventually his cronies and they prepare for the challenging swim.  The manner in which this drive influences his marriage, his relationship with his son and his perception of himself is the driver for the very tender ending.The cast is first class all the way, acting with that inimitable UK fashion of finding reality in the simplest of characters. The story is a joy to watch for its understated manner and for the glowing theme of the film.  Recommended for all audiences.

It's five stars of pure enjoyment with a heart-hug ending.We watched with the English subtitles on. Wendy's review stated that her copy had no captioning.  It does help with certain areas when the heavier British accent is hard to catch.  I didn't have to rely on it much but we watch a lot of British, Irish, Scottish, and BBC movies.  If you have a problem with that, make sure your purchase has the captions.Yes, I agree with everyone, Frank (Peter Mullan)is an outstanding character and superbly casted.  But I also felt that his wife, Joan (Brenda Blethyn) also was excellent. Both of them display a drive within that spells inspiration to others in similar situations--that being, reaching an age when something else has to begin to mark life's milestone.Another point of inspiration is the young little swimmer at the pool. If he's an actor that is not really handicapped then he deserves a major award for the acting.  If he's truly handicapped, then he deserves a bigger than major award for displaying his own true inspiration and for the accomplishments of doing the film. To his ability, sorry I don't know his name, I shout ""YES!""  As he did with each pool length.You also will fall in love with the antics, and roles of the group of pals that assist Frank in the Channel swim attempt.

Now they have been laid off and are struggling to restart their lives after decades of sure employment. Frank is taking his new status particularly hard, and seems on the verge of a heart attack or nervous breakdown when he has an idea -- why not resurrect his self-esteem by swimming the English Channel?""On a Clear Day"" boils down to a story we have seen a thousands times: the underdog who struggles valiantly against all odds to reclaim his dignity and (more importantly) learn about Life. Think ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""Calendar Girls"" and ""The Full Monty."" What rescues this film from the banality of repetition is the superb cast, the inclusion of neat motifs and the diversion of a few interesting subplots.The main subplot relates to an unresolved tragedy in Frank's family that keeps him from being opening up to his son. Then, Frank's wife is secretly trying to get her bus-driving license to supplement the diminished family income, something she doesn't want Frank to find out.There's not much suspense in the film -- in the sense that only a completely boorish or devilishly artsy director would withhold some form of ultimate triumph -- but it's fun watching this cast of misfits get there. These include the Chinese cook who can't stand up to abuse from his customers and suppliers; the goofy young lad (Billy Boyd in a post-LOTR/Pippin role) who wants (but can't manage) to be just like Frank; and the middle-aged man equally afraid of women and sailing. The strained relationship between Frank (Peter Mullan) and his son Rob (Jamie Sives) is exquisitely painful, and unfolds through marvelous scenes in which neither says a word, but in which the audience knows exactly what each is thinking and feeling.

After a time he comes up with the idea to swim the English Channel as a symbolic way to regain his self esteem. His friends and family, who have their own issues, either help him or don't know about it until later (leading to further complications, of course).

The tale has its ups and downs but its meant to be an inspirational story but as the hero progresses his victories begin to inspire his friends to do more with their lives. The relationship between the father and son is gradually revealed and poignant. This isn't something you watch for extreme dramatic points nor to see cars exploding.

Instead, it engages the viewer and draws us into the story of these everyday people - eliciting our empathy and convincingly portraying the various facets of human relationships and struggles. The focal point of the story is Frank Redmond (played convincingly by Peter Mullan), a shipyard worker who has been laid off, and becomes 'lost' as a result, until he finds a new purpose, that of swimming the English Channel, no mean feat for an accomplished athlete, much less a middle-aged man. Frank is lucky in that he has a group of loyal friends who stick with him, providing him moral support and lots of encouragement, even when he is later assailed by doubts. The friends are played by among others, Billy Boyd (best known for his role as Pippin the hobbit in LOTR).The story has many interconnected arcs - that of Frank's strained relationship with his son,Rob (Jamie Sives) who is a stay-at-home dad to twin boys. This has something to do with a tragedy in the past involving the death of Frank's other son. The talented Brenda Blethyn portrays Frank's wife, who tries desperately to pass a bus driver's exam so that she can supplement the family income, something that she keeps hidden from Frank. In the meantime, Frank doesn't tell his wife about his Channel crossing aspirations, which says a lot about the state of the couple's marriage.There are many scenes in this movie that will resonate with viewers - the quiet confrontation between Frank's wife and Frank at the dining table, Rob's confrontation with Frank at the swimming pool, and one in particular which also tugs at the heartstrings - when Frank, almost at the point of giving up sits by the pool, watching a young boy with cerebral palsy dive into the pool and swim by himself, and experiences an epiphany - that his struggles are nothing compared to the great courage it takes the boy to get into the pool and not drown, swimming independently without help.
