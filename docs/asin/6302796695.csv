This video makes it clear that torture has been a commonplace practice in US foreign policy.  This movie tells the story of how Dan Mitrione (he's given another name in the film) was sent to Uruguay to teach the police of the Uruguayan dictatorship to torture ""leftist radicals.""  According to some testimonies, in order to teach his techniques, he used homeless indigents as guinea pigs and tortured them to death.  He was captured by the Tupamaro (a left-wing guerrilla group) and finally executed when the government refused to make the group's demands.  The movie was filmed in Chile a year before the Pinochet coup.  It is in French and was not widely circulated in the U.S. (for clearly evident reasons).",5,A story more Americans should know about,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,870,"['story', 'more', 'Americans', 'should', 'know', 'especially', 'now', 'evidence', 'U.S.', 'implementation', 'torture', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'Iraq', 'Guantamo', 'Cuba', 'video', 'clear', 'torture', 'been', 'commonplace', 'practice', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'Dan', 'Mitrione', 'given', 'name', 'film', 'was', 'sent', 'Uruguay', 'teach', 'police', 'Uruguayan', 'dictatorship', 'torture', 'leftist', 'radicals', 'According', 'testimonies', 'order', 'teach', 'techniques', 'used', 'homeless', 'indigents', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'tortured', 'death', 'was', 'captured', 'Tupamaro', 'left-wing', 'guerrilla', 'group', 'finally', 'executed', 'when', 'government', 'refused', 'make', 'group', 'demands', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Chile', 'year', 'Pinochet', 'coup', 'French', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'circulated', 'U.S.', 'clearly', 'evident', 'reasons']",State of Siege VHS

It shows a ""traffic expert"", played by Yves Montland, going to a South American country to ""assist"" in traffic, but in reality, he is a CIA operative specialising in torture squads, trained by the US.  He is kidnapped and held for ransom by leftist factions, the government refuses to negotiate with them, and he ends up getting killed.  There is a scene where operatives torture live subjects on stage in front of the South American's military.  It's an extraordinarily difficult scene to watch, but it is very powerful and is not done for shock value.  The film is a bitter condemnation of American involvement in Latin America.  It shows that the US government (and quite a lot of other governments...the French did this in Algeria) tortures people, so the Abu Ghraib scandal wasn't that surprising.  The film isn't as good as Z, Costa-Gavras's first political film, but it's definitely worth watching and searching out.",5,Needs to be out on DVD....,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,997,"['reviewer', 'noted', 'important', 'film', 'one', 'based', 'fact', 'traffic', 'expert', 'played', 'Yves', 'Montland', 'going', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'assist', 'traffic', 'reality', 'CIA', 'operative', 'specialising', 'torture', 'squads', 'trained', 'US', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'ransom', 'leftist', 'factions', 'government', 'negotiate', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'scene', 'where', 'torture', 'live', 'subjects', 'stage', 'front', 'South', 'American', 'military', 'extraordinarily', 'difficult', 'scene', 'watch', 'very', 'powerful', 'not', 'done', 'shock', 'value', 'film', 'bitter', 'condemnation', 'American', 'involvement', 'Latin', 'America', 'US', 'government', 'quite', 'lot', 'other', 'governments', 'French', 'did', 'Algeria', 'people', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'scandal', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Z', 'Costa-Gavras', 'first', 'political', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'searching', 'out']",State of Siege VHS
334989,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6302796695,Linda Linguvic,"[21, 29]","This 1973 film is set in Uruguay.  There's a revolution going on.  An American, played by Yves Montand, had been kidnapped and murdered by the Tupamaro guerillas.  What follows is a flashback on the seven days leading up to this.  Mostly, it focuses on the American's interrogation.  Gradually, the audience learns that he has been sent there by the American government to teach torture to the Uruguayan police.Directed by Costa-Gavras, the tone of the film is that of a thriller, with broad sweeps of action and cross cutting between characters.  There's very little historical base for all this, just the immediacy of the moment-by-moment tension.  The filmmaker clearly favors the guerillas and their attempt to topple their corrupt government.  But the story is less about these political ideas than an attack on American imperialism and complicity with the government.Viewed from the 2002 perspective, the question of whether these guerillas are terrorists or freedom fighters surfaces.  They've targeted their actions towards a particular person who they know is responsible for heinous deeds, not the general public.  But yet they have a political agenda that they are trying to push through violent means.  Certainly, the film makes the viewer think seriously about this.The film is too long.  And it's in French with English subtitles even though it takes place in South America where people speak Spanish.  Yves Montand is a fine actor and plays his role well.  He keeps his composure throughout, even though he was aware of the sensitive situation he was in.  For me, this challenged the film's authenticity, as did the French language.  I therefore found it impossible to be emotionally moved by his plight.  The message therefore, which must have been shocking to 1973 audiences, was an unmasking of the United States' complicity with dictatorships in Latin America.Despite its flaws, I'm glad this film exists.  It brings something important to the public.  It certainly piqued my interest in Latin America.  Personally, I'm always surprised when people are so shocked about government misdeeds.  Americans are idealists.  We've been brought up to believe in freedom and democracy.  Problem is we thought that achieving these goals were easy.  There're notThe fillm is worth seeing, particularly for a historical perspective.  It's all about its message, which is an important one.

334991,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302796695,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","When I was editing a magazine, the only review I ever regretted publishing was of this film: I watched it only hours before the deadline and my review was based on my immediate impressions, when this is a film that really needs time to sink in. Partially it's because there is so much information thrown at the audience but also because it's one of those films that doesn't wear its humanity on its sleeve, and it takes a while for its full effect to really permeate.The film's structure is shifting and driven by events rather than character - it begins with roadblocks and house-to-house searches before the discovery of the body of an American 'aid' worker (a quietly impressive Yves Montand in a complete reversal of his role in Z), then moves back from his funeral to his kidnapping, the gradual realisation from the press that he was rather more important than that and only some half an hour into the film introduces him as a character through a series of interrogations. Hopes are raised and dashed, the corruption of a dictatorship masquerading as a democracy is briefly threatened with exposure, American foreign policy motives debated (aid agencies being an excellent way of discovery the weaknesses of Latin American countries) and gradually the futility of the kidnapping and the inevitable murder become apparent as both kidnappers and victim come to realise that he is worth more to the government dead than alive.All of this is played out with a number of memorable scenes (not least Montand's realisation that he is going to be killed in the film's most human moment, all the more so for being played with cold logic), some black humour (the taxi driver who has had his cab expropriated by terrorist before and knows the drill, the police childishly giving each other electric shocks with torture equipment or the businessman ignoring an escaped bound-and-gagged kidnap victim on his way to work) and a great eye for details (the too-expensive watch on a vegetable seller revealing him as a secret policeman). While the film lacks the immediacy of Z and the emotion of Missing, Costa-Gavras brings an overwhelming sense of impotence to the actions of both sides and adopts an interesting visual approach in the many scenes shot from rooftops looking down on the police and army about their dirty work, constantly panning and backtracking to reveal new details in every corner, giving a sense of omnipresent chaos and subjugation. It's genuinely impressive stuff, and it's also intriguing to note the film's location - it was shot in Chile not long before the violent US-backed Allende coup. Maybe it's that familiarity with the locale that makes Costa-Gavras' later Missing seem so authentic.On a historical note, this was the film that George Stevens Jr. and Charlton Heston successfully banned, initially from opening the Kennedy Center but eventually, such was the fallout, from US cinemas (it premiered on TV instead). The reason given was that the film 'encouraged acts of terrorism,' something which is patently absurd - the film very clearly and unequivocally reaches the conclusion that the torturer's murder is a backward and counterproductive step. It seems all the more hypocritical considering the Kennedy family's own financial and political support for terrorist groups such as the IRA, not to mention the large number of pro-IRA films (and even, in the 80s, pro Taliban and Al Quedah films) that have played the same venue without any protest from Messrs Stevens or Heston.",5,Costa-Gavras goes to Chile,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,3505,"['When', 'was', 'editing', 'magazine', 'only', 'review', 'ever', 'regretted', 'publishing', 'was', 'film', 'watched', 'only', 'hours', 'deadline', 'review', 'was', 'based', 'immediate', 'impressions', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'time', 'sink', 'Partially', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'thrown', 'audience', 'also', 'one', 'films', ""n't"", 'wear', 'humanity', 'sleeve', 'while', 'full', 'effect', 'really', 'permeate.The', 'film', 'structure', 'shifting', 'driven', 'events', 'rather', 'character', 'roadblocks', 'house-to-house', 'searches', 'discovery', 'body', 'American', ""'aid"", 'worker', 'quietly', 'impressive', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'complete', 'reversal', 'role', 'Z', 'then', 'back', 'funeral', 'kidnapping', 'gradual', 'realisation', 'press', 'was', 'rather', 'more', 'important', 'only', 'hour', 'film', 'character', 'series', 'interrogations', 'Hopes', 'are', 'raised', 'dashed', 'corruption', 'dictatorship', 'masquerading', 'democracy', 'briefly', 'threatened', 'exposure', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'motives', 'debated', 'aid', 'agencies', 'being', 'excellent', 'way', 'discovery', 'weaknesses', 'Latin', 'American', 'countries', 'gradually', 'futility', 'kidnapping', 'inevitable', 'murder', 'become', 'apparent', 'kidnappers', 'victim', 'come', 'realise', 'worth', 'more', 'government', 'dead', 'alive.All', 'played', 'out', 'number', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'not', 'least', 'Montand', 'realisation', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'film', 'most', 'human', 'moment', 'more', 'so', 'being', 'played', 'cold', 'logic', 'black', 'humour', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'had', 'cab', 'expropriated', 'terrorist', 'drill', 'police', 'childishly', 'giving', 'other', 'electric', 'shocks', 'torture', 'equipment', 'businessman', 'ignoring', 'escaped', 'bound-and-gagged', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'way', 'work', 'great', 'eye', 'details', 'too-expensive', 'watch', 'vegetable', 'seller', 'revealing', 'secret', 'policeman', 'film', 'immediacy', 'Z', 'emotion', 'Missing', 'Costa-Gavras', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'impotence', 'actions', 'sides', 'adopts', 'interesting', 'visual', 'approach', 'many', 'scenes', 'shot', 'rooftops', 'looking', 'down', 'police', 'army', 'dirty', 'work', 'constantly', 'panning', 'backtracking', 'reveal', 'new', 'details', 'corner', 'giving', 'sense', 'omnipresent', 'chaos', 'subjugation', 'genuinely', 'impressive', 'stuff', 'also', 'intriguing', 'note', 'film', 'location', 'was', 'shot', 'Chile', 'not', 'long', 'violent', 'US-backed', 'Allende', 'coup', 'familiarity', 'locale', 'Costa-Gavras', 'later', 'Missing', 'seem', 'so', 'authentic.On', 'historical', 'note', 'was', 'film', 'George', 'Stevens', 'Jr.', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'successfully', 'banned', 'initially', 'opening', 'Kennedy', 'Center', 'eventually', 'such', 'was', 'fallout', 'US', 'cinemas', 'premiered', 'TV', 'instead', 'reason', 'given', 'was', 'film', ""'encouraged"", 'acts', 'terrorism', 'something', 'patently', 'absurd', 'film', 'very', 'clearly', 'unequivocally', 'conclusion', 'torturer', 'murder', 'backward', 'counterproductive', 'step', 'more', 'hypocritical', 'considering', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'own', 'financial', 'political', 'support', 'terrorist', 'groups', 'such', 'IRA', 'not', 'mention', 'large', 'number', 'pro-IRA', 'films', 'even', '80s', 'pro', 'Taliban', 'Al', 'Quedah', 'films', 'have', 'played', 'same', 'venue', 'protest', 'Messrs', 'Stevens', 'Heston']",State of Siege VHS
