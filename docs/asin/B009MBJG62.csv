They actually used the real deal ""players"" from the community.This film actually portrayed some redeeming thoughts! It talks about the 10% of the gay population that everyone sees, and perceives as the ""stereotypical"" gay person, as well as the hidden gay population, like the guys that just go to work and don't wear their sexual orientation as a badge of honor or difference to society.It also sheds light on the ""straight"" guys who enjoy fooling around, in the gym showers or at an adult theater, maybe they're not so straight...As the film introduces each of the guests, there is an extended video montage of their works. These montages are great for the graphic nudity, sexual situations and eye candy!Stuff I didn't like about the film...This DVD turns into a preview of other Toby Ross, Hornbill, BDF films, complete with not so subliminal product placements...While I am not a video producer, and the quality is certainly better than I could do, I think you need some constructive feedback. Maybe those close to you, are too close to criticize your work.This production group needs guidance with lighting, lots of hot spots in just about every scene. This production group needs guidance with audio, too much variation with the sound, in one scene shots from one angle are loud, and from another are soft. Audio throughout fluctuates greatly from scene to scene. This production group needs guidance with editing and continuity, several very rough cuts, with inappropriate frames between. A sleeveless arm from a man (wearing a jacket) is seen in a close up as he reaches toward another character. This production group needs guidance with acting, quit reading your lines, memorize them and live them! Give the actors the freedom to become their characters and talk in a dialect that is natural for them, you don't need to read the script verbatim.Like the DVD ""Justin, A Gift from the Gods"" most of the hot, nude, sexual footage, is reused and recycled (some editing room floor footage from other films, recognizable to Toby Ross followers) from other previous productions and just spliced in to juice up the film.Overall, there is something special about Hornbill, BDF, and Toby Ross films, as long as they're still producing them, I'm still buying them!",3,Good premice,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,2376,"['like', 'premice', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'talking', 'gay', 'culture', 'players', 'Chicago', 'gay', 'crowd', 'actually', 'used', 'real', 'deal', 'players', 'community.This', 'film', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'redeeming', 'thoughts', '10', '%', 'gay', 'population', 'everyone', 'sees', 'perceives', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'hidden', 'gay', 'population', 'guys', 'just', 'go', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'badge', 'honor', 'difference', 'society.It', 'also', 'sheds', 'light', 'straight', 'guys', 'who', 'enjoy', 'fooling', 'around', 'gym', 'showers', 'adult', 'theater', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'straight', 'film', 'guests', 'extended', 'video', 'montage', 'works', 'montages', 'are', 'great', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'eye', 'candy', 'Stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'DVD', 'preview', 'other', 'Toby', 'Ross', 'Hornbill', 'BDF', 'films', 'complete', 'not', 'subliminal', 'product', 'placements', 'am', 'not', 'video', 'producer', 'quality', 'certainly', 'better', 'could', 'do', 'think', 'need', 'constructive', 'feedback', 'Maybe', 'close', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'criticize', 'work.This', 'production', 'group', 'guidance', 'lighting', 'lots', 'hot', 'spots', 'just', 'scene', 'production', 'group', 'guidance', 'audio', 'too', 'much', 'variation', 'sound', 'one', 'scene', 'shots', 'one', 'angle', 'are', 'loud', 'are', 'soft', 'Audio', 'fluctuates', 'greatly', 'scene', 'scene', 'production', 'group', 'guidance', 'editing', 'continuity', 'several', 'very', 'rough', 'cuts', 'inappropriate', 'frames', 'A', 'sleeveless', 'arm', 'man', 'wearing', 'jacket', 'seen', 'close', 'up', 'character', 'production', 'group', 'guidance', 'acting', 'quit', 'reading', 'lines', 'memorize', 'live', 'Give', 'actors', 'freedom', 'become', 'characters', 'talk', 'dialect', 'natural', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'read', 'script', 'DVD', 'Justin', 'A', 'Gift', 'Gods', 'most', 'hot', 'nude', 'sexual', 'footage', 'reused', 'recycled', 'editing', 'room', 'floor', 'footage', 'other', 'films', 'recognizable', 'Toby', 'Ross', 'followers', 'other', 'previous', 'productions', 'just', 'spliced', 'juice', 'up', 'film.Overall', 'something', 'special', 'Hornbill', 'BDF', 'Toby', 'Ross', 'films', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'still', 'producing', ""'m"", 'still', 'buying']",Homosexual
1598987,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B009MBJG62,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[5, 5]","I've enjoyed exploring the world of Toby Ross over the past couple of years and naturally I'm always thrilled to check out any Ross endeavor. Homosexual is a great example of what a Mockumentary should be as it's filled with great insights, sly humor, and liberal doses of warmth. Toby has chosen to explore the various aspects of gay culture and lifestyles which aren't always shown through various forms of media or even talked about as a general rule of thumb. Rather than ridiculing or judging any particular party or groups of people, the film chooses to shed light on the issues most of us have always had a secret desire to know but probably didn't know exactly who to ask. Ross, himself, makes an appearance and lends his view in regards to specifics he recalls and the men that he adored. Compliments of the Ross photography archives, we are also treated to some very lovely photographs of beautiful men in various levels of dress or lack thereof. As one has to come to expect, we also are allotted several passionate scenes of lovemaking. If you are curious about the homosexual male and would like clarification on the lifestyle, Homosexual is certainly a great film as far as starting places go. Fans of Ross' work in general will swoon as well.",4,Underwater,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1257,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'exploring', 'world', 'Toby', 'Ross', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'naturally', ""'m"", 'always', 'thrilled', 'check', 'out', 'Ross', 'endeavor', 'Homosexual', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'Mockumentary', 'should', 'be', 'filled', 'great', 'insights', 'sly', 'humor', 'liberal', 'doses', 'warmth', 'Toby', 'chosen', 'explore', 'various', 'aspects', 'gay', 'culture', 'lifestyles', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'shown', 'various', 'forms', 'media', 'even', 'talked', 'general', 'rule', 'thumb', 'Rather', 'ridiculing', 'judging', 'particular', 'party', 'groups', 'people', 'film', 'shed', 'light', 'issues', 'most', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'secret', 'desire', 'know', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'ask', 'Ross', 'appearance', 'view', 'regards', 'specifics', 'men', 'adored', 'Compliments', 'Ross', 'photography', 'archives', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'very', 'lovely', 'photographs', 'beautiful', 'men', 'various', 'levels', 'dress', 'lack', 'thereof', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'also', 'are', 'allotted', 'several', 'passionate', 'scenes', 'lovemaking', 'are', 'curious', 'homosexual', 'male', 'would', 'like', 'clarification', 'lifestyle', 'Homosexual', 'certainly', 'great', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'starting', 'places', 'go', 'Fans', 'Ross', 'work', 'general', 'will', 'swoon', 'as', 'well']",Homosexual

This one is diffent in that it sort of sets a milemarker and point of reference.The interviews or little monologues were good because they showed indication of some sense of wanting to be intentional and lossing some of the false bravado of youth.  It would be so easy to get critical and point out all the flaws however, since the film is playful in its structure, let's leave it there.One major highlight is the interview with Joe Rubin.  Joe has been in Toby's other films and has done some directing in them as well as other various aspects of film making.  I believe in the film he said he is 23.  I am very interested to see how he matures in his craft.  He is becoming purposeful.

I am a parent to a gay son and was curious to take a look at this Mock-Umentary for obvious reasons.It tells you that Gays basically divide into two major group : Those who are into it for the sex and those who are looking for relationships (Hey is it really that black and white? how about those who are into it for both) Although it is a bit unforgiving and I don't know if I agree with it all, I found it worthwhile. The live reenactments were an eyeful and it goes through all the levels and strands of gay guys. At one point the young (23) director claims ""It's the flamboyance that keeps us from being totally accepted"" Well I would say it is the narrow minds more then the flamboyance. The highlight of this piece was when two sailor (the real thing) one gay one straight come for a naked photo session unveiling a plethora of mental issues. The photo session its self looked beautiful and would remind you of a different time. A more innocent and friendly time.

To me, the flamboyance of the pride marches are making us/ LGBT community) look rather freaky, if we want equality, and most of us do, we should be more respectful of ourselves and the public.
