Sometimes that is the thing I first check of any movie. In this one, the performances are deep and hilarious. Then there is the content, I like a movie also by it's content, if it's interesting, boring, fictious or real life themes. In this case intersting, find out why by watching this one. And there is also the dialogues, many movies depend on dialogues. In this case there are smartly funny dialogues between Har&uacute; and Sensei or Gobei.I suggest you go buy, rent or anything that is more comfortable for you in which the results are watching the movie.

Though slapstick humor isn't really my thing, I guess as a black belt in Martial arts myself, having the show revolve around Martial Arts from awesome moves, to the complete rediculous was enjoyable. Chris Farely did a far better job than in Black Sheep which was almost the same movie as Tommy boy, and the kind of boring &quot;Almost heroes&quot; which just kind of dragged on.the movie itself was a great show, but I was extremely disappointed in the DVD version. DVD's have been around for a while before they released this movie, and they have done great things with them. Behind the scenes looks, interviews, language changes, subtitles, deleted scenes, character and actor bios, and much more can be found in the special menus. On my Mortal Kombat 2 and Crow:Salvation DVD they even added a mini interactive game.This special menu had cast bios and the trailer. That is it. Nothing else. I know there were a lot of deleted funny scenes because they showed the movie deleted scenes and all, on tv last year. And Robin Shou (Who played Gobi, Haru's adopted brother) Had just as big of a part as Chris Rock, and was more of an important character since he took all the heat for keeping Haru out of trouble, and yet he wasn't even added in the actor bio.It just lacked a lot of extras that could have made it a great DVD. So the movie was hilarious...yes it was stupid, but come on, at least it was meant to be unlike some movies that send people home laughing when they were trying to be serious...And I loved the acting of all the characters, all who blended perfectly with eachother. (Especially Soon Tek Oh- Haru's adopted father). But the DVD just could have done a lot more in the extras department. This seemed more like the first line of DVD's rather than the already advanced and sophisticated one with extras we've come to love.

166832,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0800187865,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Chris Farley was probably the greatest physical comedian of his generation, and his unique skills are truly showcased in Beverly Hills Ninja.  It's sort of a no-brainer: cast Chris Farley as ""the great white Ninja"" and stand back while hilarity ensues.  That's basically what happens, although the story itself isn't all that bad on its own.  Obviously, there are lots of stunts and comedic pratfalls in the film, but the dialogue is hilarious, as well - Beverly Hills Ninja is eminently quotable.  Adding Chris Rock to the comedic mix makes a good thing even better.As a babe, little Haru (Farley) washed up on the shores of Japan and was taken in by a ninja master.  Legends foretold of a white child who would become the greatest ninja in the world, and Sensei adopted the child as one of his own.  By the time Haru grew up, though, it seemed rather obvious that he was not the prophesied Great White Ninja - he had plenty of heart and dedication, but no ninja skills whatsoever.  Then a shapely American blonde (Nicollette Sheridan) comes to the dojo asking for help, and Haru readily agrees to put his ninja stealth skills to use for her.  He discovers that the lady's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, and - hearing nothing else from her - he decides it is his duty to follow her to the Hills of Beverly and safeguard her life.  Knowing that Haru is a clumsy goof, Sensei (Soon-Tek Oh) sends Haru's ""brother"" Gobei (Robin Shou) to surreptitiously watch over and assist him.  Gobei is plenty busy, as Haru soon finds himself blamed for a couple of murders and basically keeps putting himself in peril.  Incredibly, Haru does manage to find his client again, which puts him on a collision course with bad guys more than willing to rob and kill in order to get their counterfeit operation up and going.  Haru makes some interesting detours along the way: forgetting everything he's ever learned about being one with the universe at a local strip joint, posing as an inking expert, and even serving up a most memorable meal at a Japanese restaurant.  In case you're wondering, there is some martial arts action in the closing minutes, and it's quite a kick to see Farley actually take care of a little business.Beverly Hills Ninja is a very funny movie.  The world will never see the likes of Chris Farley again, and this role was seemingly made for him to play.  It's like a highlight reel of all Farley's funniest stunts and hijinx, and great one-liners just pour out of the characters' mouths in abundance.  If you're not into comedy for comedy's sake, you can even take heart in seeing Haru succeed at finally proving himself and earning the respect of his Sensei and ""brother.""  The music, which does include both ""Turning Japanese"" and ""Kung Fu Fighting,"" also adds a lot to the comedy.

166835,A138826JMC0J3T,0800187865,E. Batica,"[0, 0]","This one was funny but I think it could've been a little better.  Chris Farley in BEVERLY HILLS NINJA was a good role for him and I have to give him his props because he did a lot of his own stunts and he studied and trained in martial arts for months before they started shooting this movie.  And like all Chris Farley movies, there is loads and loads of physical comedy in this one.  And who could forget his side kick and another SNL alumni, Chris Rock.The story outs that it is written that one day a foreign child would come to a clan of ninjas and that foreign child would be the Greatest Ninja ever.  Boy were they ever wrong!  Now 20 years after the arrival of Haru (Farley) and still no sign of greatness, his master and father feels that he will never be a true ninja.  One night while training by himself, a woman stops in their dojo and tells Haru of her problem that she suspects that her boyfriend is doing something illegal.  After spying on him, he finds out that her boyfriend is a crime boss and now Haru must travel to America, stop him and protect the girl.  But he won't be alone because following him in the shadows is his friend Gobei (Robin Shou).You can't deny it, this movie had a lot of funny parts to it like when Farley is disguise, the fight scenes are also good in the sense of a goof martial arts fight scene and they're pretty funny as well (the sushi bar fight).  My problem with this movie is that Chris Rock's character really didn't get to be funny.  He was pretty much just there and he really didn't do much.  My other problem was that Robin Shou was trying to be funny and he's just not funny at all.

He prefers acting that is rigid and focused rather than experimental and unique.  Chris Farley was a brilliant comedic performer, not because he was overweight and fell through things, but because he was willing to do ANYTHING to make others laugh.  Not everything funny has to be intelligent, in fact stupidity is very funny.  Farley's acting feels free and natural, and he is in fact one of the most emotional actors I have ever seen.  When he is sad, angry, or confused it comes across very well on screen.  This movie, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, and his work on Saturday Night Live all reflect his unique, powerful, incredibly energetic comedic style.  If you want to dismiss Farley's comedy as &quot;physical comedy&quot; then you can dismiss Michael Caine's much praised acting as &quot;rigid and strict&quot;.  In my opinion Farley was a one-of-a-kind actor who strived to be different and Michael Caine is just an actor who strives to be accepted.  Leonard Maltin loves white, arrogant, priveleged actors, and so of course he loves Michael Caine.

166840,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,0800187865,H. Thompson,"[0, 0]","INTRO:  Well, at least I think its his second funniest movie.  The original script for this movie was written up in the mid-80's and took a while to get situated with a company for production.  In the end, Chris Farley was hired to play the part of &quot;Haru&quot; the &quot;Great White Ninja&quot;.  If you haven't seen this, then I suggest you do so.MOVIE:  The movie itself (I'll admit) isn't Farley's funniest, but it is a good one nonetheless.  It tells about a Japanese legend that talks about how a &quot;Great White Ninja&quot; would come and be the greatest ninja around, but when a young white baby is found close to a shrine in Japan, they feel its the legend.  Soon do they find out that Haru isn't a great ninja...or even a good one for that fact.  He is a total foul-up and failure and manages to screw up a lot of stuff.  Soon, Haru gets hired for a mission across seas (sorta') and he goes to help.  What follows is definitely interesting.  And with some other great co-actors Robin Shou (Mortal Kombat) and Chris Rock (SNL) you'll find yourself laughing to the end...especially at the end.DVD/EXTRAS:  The DVD isn't anything to brag about, but its not awful.  Its just pretty good.  It has some bios, a theatrical trailer, and the typical menus that you find on most average DVDs.  This DVD is just good for the movie basically.OVERALL:  Overall, I just suggesting buying this if you love Chris Farley or SNL humor in movie form.  Also, if you like Japanes comedies, this will sort of deliver in that field too.

been handled with better deftness and a much smarter comedy mind and technique than Farley could ever muster.The supporting cast,consisting of folks like veteran Soon-Tek Oh,Nicolette Sheridan,Nathaniel Parker,Chris Rock and a small part by Billy Connolly,are more than competent to handle their supporting duties.The plot is also good,even though it is simple and quite see through.No,it is the ""star"" who is the problem with this flick.He is very wooden,doing his schtick and looking at times very uncomfortable.You can almost see him asking himself ""I don't think this stuff is going over,is it?"".The plot begins with the unlikeliness of events,which is a washed up crate containing a baby,discovered by a secret convent of ninjas.The sensei raises him as his own and he is raised,of course,in all things ninja.When he comes of age he engages,with his brethren,in their right of passage to become an official ninja.Haru/Farley,of course,is nothing short of incompetent at everything he does and he doesn't become an official ninja that day.One night while minding the dojo,a woman enters looking for help with a problem.Since Farley is the only one present he vows to make her problem his problem,and follows her to Beverley Hills.His parting from his home is filled with many a slip and faux paux.He is ordered tailed by his sensei,who chooses his ""brother"",the one who has been the closest to him.So as Haru stumbles and bumbles his way around Beverley Hills in search of,and the eventual helping of,the lady who approached him for help,he gets himself deeper and deeper into trouble.However when things get too troublesome,his brother is always there in the shadows to rescue him,unbeknownst to Haru.Haru's lady is seeking revenge for her sisters murder,so she has ingratiated herself into the murderer's favour.However he has not only killed her sister,he has already killed rival Chinese gang members in an attempt to obtain counterfeit money plates.It of course all goes south and the lady has her cover blown and is tied up in a warehouse awaiting to go to pieces,when the bomb on a timer goes off.Haru enters the warehouse in an attempt to rescue her when he is overwhelmed.It is at this time his brother finally jumps in and reveals himself.Together they send the bad guys packing and save the girl.The end of the film finds the unlikely pairing of Haru and the lovely lady and as they leave the ninja compound for good,his brother,in a wheelchair,is thrown like a rocket off a cliff and into the ocean.The laughs are forced throughout and Farley had a LONG way to go in order to perfect his ""comedy"".He was throwing his usual SNL schtick into things,along with the oh-so obvious let's laugh at the fat guy's physique and incompetence routine.As I said earlier,handled by someone much more competent than Farley,this movie could have gone through the roof.As it is,he is so far out of his league the gags fall mostly flat.It is all been-there,done-that stuff,sorry to say.Technically speaking the movie is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and contains the trailer and some info on the actors and director.All in all a disappointing movie,that should have been much better than it was.Farley is wooden,going lackadaisically from one scene to the next,and his heart is just not into what he is doing,and unfortunately it shows.Only for true Farley fans.I'd give it a pass.",3,2 1/2-3 stars-Another SNL alumnus trying for gold and getting dust!,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,3519,"['Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', 'released', 'Jan/97',

Boy, were they wrong. Haru (Chris Farley) grew up to be the most clumsy person in Japan and caused lots of trouble. When the dojo was empty one evening, Haru was in charge to guard the place. A simple task, yes, but no, he fouled it up by breaking walls, burning scrolls and meeting Sally, a mysterious woman who needed a ninja. Haru helped this Sally and traveled to Beverly Hills where he disguised himself as a pimp and helped Sally. Gobei (Robin Shou) went to Beverly Hills as well to keep an eye out for the goofball. Haru lost many shoes and caused lots of damage. He also tried cooking Japanese food, but failed miserably. I was ashamed to have witnessed men getting beat up with fish.

166859,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0800187865,trebe,"[0, 1]","After two films co-starring with SNL buddy David Spade, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) was Chris Farley's first as a headliner, and the last film released before his untimely death in 1997.  Sophisticated it isn't, but Beverly Hills Ninja is still a very entertaining time.  The film features a ton of gags that showcase Farley's special talent for physical humor.  Director Dennis Dugan (Just Go With It, Happy Gilmore) does a good job of keeping things moving and under control, as Farley plays an earnest but not very competent ninja.Somewhere in Japan, a Caucasian baby is found by a group of ninjas who name him Haru, and raise him as one of their own.  Haru (Farley) grows to adulthood receiving the traditional training of a ninja, but unfortunately does not excel in the practice of the secret fighting arts.  One night while alone at his dojo, Haru encounters a blonde woman named Sally Jones who asks him to investigate her boyfriend Martin Tanley (Nathaniel Parker).  Tanley is involved in a counterfeiting scheme, and is at the waterfront to pick up some counterfeit plates.  Haru is also present, and gets the blame when Tanley commits a murder.  With the Tokyo police seeking a ninja in connection with the crime, Haru's sensei (Soon-Tek Oh) reluctantly approves of Haru's plan to go to Los Angeles, to try and find Sally Jones.  As backup, Sensei instructs Haru's brother Gobei (Robin Shou), a skilled ninja, to tag along and help Haru in his mission.Arriving in LA, Haru uses gold given to him by Sensei, to check into the ritzy Rodeo Plaza Hotel in Beverly Hills.  Joey Washington (Chris Rock), an employee at the hotel, is totally impressed by Haru's talents, and receives some tips on how to become a ninja.  Dressed in a tiger print coat, and with secret help from his brother Gobei at almost every turn, Haru manages to locate ""Sally"", whose real name is Allison Page.  Discovering that Allison is in deep trouble, Haru teams up with her to try and break up the counterfeit scheme that involves Tanley and a rival Asian gang.With Haru finally displaying his amazing skills, the film finishes strongly with an impressive fight sequence.  While cheesy and somewhat predictable, Beverly Hills Ninja is good clean fun.  Terrific at physical comedy, Chris Farley shows that he can carry a film, as well as take a kick to the head.  The hilarious scene with Farley as a chef, wielding a pair of huge fish as weapons, is just one of many gags that work without seeming too overdone.  Anyone familiar with Farley's SNL sketch as a Chippendale dancer, is aware that he was quite nimble for a big person.  Sadly, the life of the man who played Matt Foley with so much enthusiasm, ended much too soon.Beverly Hills Ninja is family type entertainment, without malice or profanity.  Nicolette Sheridan turns in a likeable performance, and Robin Shou is excellent as the much abused Gobei.  Chris Rock steals many of the scenes he is in, although the stunt where he is launched from a palm tree, comes off looking pretty bad.  If you find Chris Farley's brand of innocuous humor cool, be sure to add this to your collection along with Tommy Boy (1995), Black Sheep (1996), and Almost Heroes (1998).",4,"Chris Farley becomes ""One with the Universe""...",1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,3201,"['two', 'films', 'co-starring', 'SNL', 'buddy', 'David', 'Spade', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', '1997', 'was', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'first', 'headliner', 'last', 'film', 'released', 'untimely', 'death', '1997', 'Sophisticated', ""n't"", 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'time', 'film', 'ton', 'gags', 'showcase', 'Farley', 'special', 'talent', 'physical', 'humor', 'Director', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'Just', 'Go', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'moving', 'control', 'Farley', 'earnest', 'not', 'very', 'competent', 'ninja.Somewhere', 'Japan', 'Caucasian', 'baby', 'found', 'group', 'ninjas', 'who', 'Haru', 'raise', 'one', 'own', 'Haru', 'Farley', 'adulthood', 'receiving', 'traditional', 'training', 'ninja', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'excel', 'practice', 'secret', 'fighting', 'arts', 'One', 'night', 'alone', 'dojo', 'Haru', 'blonde', 'woman', 'named', 'Sally', 'Jones', 'who', 'investigate', 'boyfriend', 'Martin', 'Tanley', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Tanley', 'involved', 'counterfeiting', 'scheme', 'waterfront', 'pick', 'up', 'counterfeit', 'plates', 'Haru', 'also', 'present', 'blame', 'when', 'Tanley', 'murder', 'Tokyo', 'police', 'seeking', 'ninja', 'connection', 'crime', 'Haru', 'sensei', 'Soon-Tek', 'Oh', 'reluctantly', 'Haru', 'plan', 'go', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'try', 'find', 'Sally', 'Jones', 'backup', 'Sensei', 'Haru', 'brother', 'Gobei', 'Robin', 'Shou', 'skilled', 'ninja', 'tag', 'along', 'help', 'Haru', 'mission.Arriving', 'LA', 'Haru', 'gold', 'given', 'Sensei', 'check', 'ritzy', 'Rodeo', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Joey', 'Washington', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'employee', 'hotel', 'totally', 'impressed', 'Haru', 'talents', 'tips', 'how', 'become', 'ninja', 'Dressed', 'tiger', 'print', 'coat', 'secret', 'help', 'brother', 'Gobei', 'almost', 'turn', 'Haru', 'locate', 'Sally', 'real', 'name', 'Allison', 'Page', 'Discovering', 'Allison', 'deep', 'trouble', 'Haru', 'up', 'try', 'break', 'up', 'counterfeit', 'scheme', 'Tanley', 'rival', 'Asian', 'gang.With', 'Haru', 'finally', 'displaying', 'amazing', 'skills', 'film', 'finishes', 'strongly', 'impressive', 'fight', 'sequence', 'cheesy', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'Terrific', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'kick', 'head', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Farley', 'chef', 'wielding', 'pair', 'huge', 'fish', 'weapons', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'gags', 'work', 'seeming', 'too', 'overdone', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Farley', 'SNL', 'sketch', 'Chippendale', 'dancer', 'aware', 'was', 'quite', 'nimble', 'big', 'person', 'Sadly', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Matt', 'Foley', 'so', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'ended', 'much', 'too', 'soon.Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', 'family', 'type', 'entertainment', 'malice', 'profanity', 'Nicolette', 'Sheridan', 'likeable', 'performance', 'Robin', 'Shou', 'excellent', 'much', 'abused', 'Gobei', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'stunt', 'where', 'launched', 'palm', 'tree', 'off', 'looking', 'pretty', 'bad', 'find', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'brand', 'innocuous', 'humor', 'cool', 'be', 'sure', 'add', 'collection', 'Tommy', 'Boy', '1995', 'Black', 'Sheep', '1996', 'Almost', 'Heroes', '1998']",N/A
166860,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,0800187865,wellwellwell,"[0, 1]","I think it's safe to say that Chris Farley may be the last person you'd expect to see as a ninja.  For one thing he's white.  Not to mention he's fat, slow and a bit dumb.  But that's what makes this movie so great.  The now deceased Farley has left us with some of the best comedies known to man.  That being the populars &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, for anyone who is not a true fanatic.This movie was mostly overlooked, even by some Farley fans.  It's very funny, and it's good to see Chris not using his obesity and lack of brains as means of 'good' comedy.  Although that's what he did best.  In this movie he plays Haru, a white kid who washed up onto the ocean shore of China.  He's then picked up by a group of ninjas and attempts to learn their ways throughout his life.  And, as you may have guessed, was not very good at it.  And that's where the comedy is generated here.  It's the fact that Haru shouldn't be doing what he's doing that makes the movie what it is.If you are wondering where Beverly Hills comes in, you're not alone.  I never really got why the girl went to China to find a ninja.  A lack of a good plot might be the way to explain it.  It makes sense once you see it, but it's kind of stupid.  No, 'stupid' is a harsh word; it's more of a stretch.  It's also one of those movies where you can guess everything that's going to happen.  There's never really any surprises, or things that make you say &quot;wow&quot;.  But I do have to say the appearance by Chris Rock was a plus for the movie.  Rock plays the apprentice of Haru, something that is rather droll, yet impresive.  And the way Farley attempts to teach him is hilarious; one of the best scenes, I thought.The reason this movie got 3 stars was for the acting.  Chris Farley does a great job as a ninja, and he gives us more than just a few laughs.  And him taking off his shoes before he enters the hotel, every time, is by far the best part of the movie.  If the movie had a better story it might have reached 4 maybe even 5 stars.  All in all it is a very funny movie; and if you liked Chris Farley you'll like this film.  Whether you liked him in &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; or not, I recommend this movie to you.  Enjoy it for what it's worth, we owe Chris at least that.",3,An all-around good movie,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,2280,"['think', 'safe', 'say', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'person', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'ninja', 'one', 'thing', 'white', 'Not', 'mention', 'fat', 'slow', 'bit', 'dumb', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'now', 'deceased', 'Farley', 'left', 'best', 'comedies', 'known', 'man', 'being', 'populars', 'quot', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'quot', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'true', 'fanatic.This', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'overlooked', 'even', 'Farley', 'fans', 'very', 'funny', 'good', 'see', 'Chris', 'not', 'using', 'obesity', 'lack', 'brains', 'means', ""'good"", 'comedy', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'movie', 'Haru', 'white', 'kid', 'who', 'washed', 'up', 'ocean', 'shore', 'China', 'then', 'picked', 'up', 'group', 'ninjas', 'attempts', 'learn', 'ways', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'where', 'comedy', 'generated', 'here', 'fact', 'Haru', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'wondering', 'where', 'Beverly', 'Hills', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'why', 'girl', 'went', 'China', 'find', 'ninja', 'lack', 'good', 'plot', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'explain', 'sense', 'once', 'see', 'kind', 'stupid', 'No', ""'stupid"", 'harsh', 'word', 'more', 'stretch', 'also', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'can', 'guess', 'everything', 'going', 'happen', 'never', 'really', 'surprises', 'things', 'make', 'say', 'quot', 'quot', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'appearance', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'was', 'plus', 'movie', 'Rock', 'apprentice', 'Haru', 'something', 'rather', 'droll', 'yet', 'impresive', 'way', 'Farley', 'attempts', 'teach', 'hilarious', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'thought.The', 'reason', 'movie', 'got', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'acting', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'great', 'job', 'ninja', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'laughs', 'taking', 'off', 'shoes', 'hotel', 'time', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'reached', '4', 'maybe', 'even', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'liked', 'Chris', 'Farley', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'liked', 'quot', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'quot', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Enjoy', 'what', 'worth', 'owe', 'Chris', 'least']",N/A
