1365588,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B003UESJIS,Amit Talpade,"[4, 4]","Another year is one of the better character driven films that has come out in the last year. The film is about stability, love and balance in life. Why do some people have the best wives, jobs, houses, kids all at the same time, how do they achieve such a balance, and then why do some people do not manage to find peace in any aspect of their life, why are they constantly in shambles and their life a constant struggle. Does it have to do with the fact that these people were skillful at making bad choices thus chose misery and unhappiness or did life just give them lemons? `Another Year' certainly raises these questions but I did not find any answers. However after watching several questions such as these still linger in my mind.At the heart of this tale are Tom and Gerri, happy in their professions (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen), married for several years, they are the text book happy couple, doing everything together, comfortable with each other and loving deeply. Thiers is a rare union, they also have a son who is successful and they also have a great relation with him. We get to follow the happenings in their life over the course of a year as many friends and a relative go through crises. Amidst these wreckages Tom and Gerri are the only survivors.Ken (Peter Wright) is a friend, a life spent working and approaching retirement, he is petrified at the daunting prospects that await him. He has no one or nothing to look forwards too, and he has happily resorted to alcohol as his partner. An emotional breakdown has him confessing that he is absolutely dreads taking the train to his town of Hull these days.Then there is Ruth's co-worker, Mary (Lesley Manning) who is a nervous wreck and her life as well. Every step is a misstep and every decision a disaster for her. Her life has been wasted on frivolous pursuits and trying to fill the vacuum. She is falling to pieces as well. She develops a crush on Ruth's son, who does not reciprocate but is polite. One of the better scenes is watching her crumble when he introduces his much younger girl friend to her.Another year is not a story that has a neat conclusion; it is just another year in a family's life. The acting and the well written dialogue makes it engaging. Each one of the cast is exceptional, but I felt it was Mary (Lesley Manning ) who towers above everyone else, just for this act alone I may go and watch this film again. If you need an example of her trade, watch the final scene as the camera pans on her face with a puzzling gaze. Sensational.

1365589,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003UESJIS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I'm kind of new into the whole Mike Leigh film-fan thing.  I've seen a few of his films, but I actually really need to get into his 90's work, which is where a lot of my friends say his real gems are.  That being said, I really do like what I've seen so far.  Even films that initially didn't strike me (like `Happy-Go-Lucky') have intrigued me all the more as time as passed; and there really is no denying that `Vera Drake' is a modern masterpiece.So that brings me to `Another Year', a film that seemed rather dull and bland to me (from an outsider's point of view) that wound up being anything but.The film revolves around an aged couple, Tom and Gerri, who live in England.  They have an eclectic group of friends, namely the middle-aged Mary.  Mary is desperate for attention, in and out of bad relationships and determined to find Mr. Right, but Mr. Right is elusive and her personality (possessive, clingy, frantic, pathetic) is a deterrent, especially when her obsession with age and feeling or appearing younger than the lines on her face would suggest cause her to seek out the affections of inappropriate suitors, namely Tom and Gerri's son Joe.  Spanning over the course of a year, the aptly named `Another Year' takes the time to expose the frailties in friendships as well as the lasting bond formed by those who share something special.  As the characters are introduced and incorporated into the fabric of Tom and Gerri's lives, we can see how the dynamic works between everyone.  Each character has their own identity, all but Tom and Gerri who seem to be mere props to `tie everyone together'.  That is probably my one quibble with this film.  I would have liked to see the two central characters feel a little more alive, especially Tom, but at the end of the day their reflective and observational personalities allowed the more aggressive characters to shine, so maybe it was for the best.We can't all be scene stealers.The film is broken down into four sections (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), and those sections mainly consist of one elongated scene each, thus playing out much like a play would.  I actually adore this structure because it allows the dialog and character interaction to take center stage and really unfold beautifully, giving the characters rich development and persona's all their own that mesh and conflict and cause that feeling of awkward, uneasiness that lets the audience know that what is happening is `real', as in `authentic'.  And that is really one of the best assets this film has in its arsenal; it feels real.  The acting is all splendid, especially Lesley Manville who nails every ounce of Mary's emotional complexity.  She creates a character that is equal parts adorable and repulsive.  You can understand why Tom and Gerri love her, but you can also understand why she grates their nerves so excessively, and it is very hard to construct a character that obnoxious that doesn't make the audience long for their departure.  In fact, I kept hoping she'd come back the moment she faded from view.Parts of `Another Year' could have been cleaned up, especially in the first section, which took some time to pick up, but overall I really enjoyed what Leigh did with his characters here.  This is the type of film that demands subsequent viewings, for once is certainly not enough to fully `get' everything that Leigh is delivering.",4,A lot can happen in a year...,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,3387,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'new', 'whole', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'film-fan', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'actually', 'really', 'need', 'get', '90', 'work', 'where', 'lot', 'friends', 'say', 'real', 'gems', 'are', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'do', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Even', 'films', 'initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'have', 'intrigued', 'more', 'as', 'time', 'passed', 'really', 'denying', 'Vera', 'Drake', 'modern', 'masterpiece.So', 'Year', 'film', 'seemed', 'rather', 'dull', 'bland', 'outsider', 'point', 'view', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'anything', 'but.The', 'film', 'aged', 'couple', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'who', 'live', 'England', 'have', 'eclectic', 'group', 'friends', 'namely', 'middle-aged', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'desperate', 'attention', 'bad', 'relationships', 'determined', 'find', 'Mr', 'Right', 'Mr', 'Right', 'elusive', 'personality', 'possessive', 'clingy', 'frantic', 'pathetic', 'deterrent', 'especially', 'when', 'obsession', 'age', 'feeling', 'appearing', 'younger', 'lines', 'face', 'would', 'suggest', 'cause', 'seek', 'out', 'affections', 'inappropriate', 'suitors', 'namely', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'son', 'Joe', 'Spanning', 'course', 'year', 'aptly', 'named', 'Year', 'time', 'expose', 'frailties', 'friendships', 'as', 'well', 'lasting', 'bond', 'formed', 'who', 'share', 'something', 'special', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'incorporated', 'fabric', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'lives', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'dynamic', 'works', 'everyone', 'character', 'own', 'identity', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'mere', 'props', 'tie', 'everyone', 'together', 'probably', 'one', 'quibble', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'alive', 'especially', 'Tom', 'end', 'day', 'reflective', 'observational', 'personalities', 'allowed', 'more', 'aggressive', 'characters', 'shine', 'maybe', 'was', 'best.We', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'scene', 'stealers.The', 'film', 'broken', 'down', 'four', 'sections', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter', 'sections', 'mainly', 'consist', 'one', 'elongated', 'scene', 'thus', 'playing', 'out', 'much', 'play', 'would', 'actually', 'adore', 'structure', 'dialog', 'character', 'interaction', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'really', 'unfold', 'beautifully', 'giving', 'characters', 'rich', 'development', 'persona', 'own', 'mesh', 'conflict', 'cause', 'feeling', 'awkward', 'uneasiness', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'real', 'authentic', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'assets', 'film', 'arsenal', 'real', 'acting', 'splendid', 'especially', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'who', 'ounce', 'Mary', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'character', 'equal', 'parts', 'adorable', 'repulsive', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'love', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'nerves', 'so', 'excessively', 'very', 'hard', 'construct', 'character', 'obnoxious', ""n't"", 'make', 'audience', 'long', 'departure', 'fact', 'kept', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'come', 'back', 'moment', 'faded', 'view.Parts', 'Year', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'especially', 'first', 'section', 'took', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'Leigh', 'did', 'characters', 'here', 'type', 'film', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'once', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'fully', 'get', 'everything', 'Leigh', 'delivering']",N/A
1365590,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B003UESJIS,Andy Orrock,"[2, 2]","I'm a huge fan of Mike Leigh's work.  ""Another Year"" represents his third strong outing in a row, following up 2004'sVera Drakeand 2008'sHappy-Go-Lucky.  Like all Leigh films, these three feel so life-like...nothing artificial here.  This is life unfolding as most of us mortals know it.  A lot of that stems from Leigh's unlike way of working: there's no script; the actors get together and work out their characters, their back-stories and their relationships; then, they rehearse (and rehearse and rehearse).  The result: magic.Of the players in this latest piece: Jim Broadbent is great (as ever); Ruth Sheen winning and lovely as his wife; and Oliver Maltman charming and likable as their adult-aged son.  But you have to go to another level to express your admiration for what Lesley Manville does in this film.  How she didn't get an Academy Award nomination is beyond me.  Her performance as Tom and Gerri's friend Mary is astonishingly good.  First, you're put off by her neediness and endless chattering.  Slowly, you start to realize: wait, this is an *amazing* performance.  At times, it's so uncomfortable you want to look away...but you never do.  It just gets too compelling.And, oh, if I were a director, I would put Karina Fernandez in every single one of my movies.",5,"""Another Year"" represents Mike Leigh's third strong outing in a row",1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1283,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'work', 'Year', 'third', 'strong', 'outing', 'row', 'following', 'up', ""2004'sVera"", 'Drakeand', ""2008'sHappy-Go-Lucky"", 'Leigh', 'films', 'three', 'feel', 'so', 'life-like', 'nothing', 'artificial', 'here', 'life', 'unfolding', 'most', 'mortals', 'know', 'lot', 'Leigh', 'way', 'working', 'script', 'actors', 'get', 'together', 'work', 'out', 'characters', 'back-stories', 'relationships', 'then', 'rehearse', 'rehearse', 'rehearse', 'result', 'magic.Of', 'players', 'latest', 'piece', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'great', 'ever', 'Ruth', 'Sheen', 'winning', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Oliver', 'Maltman', 'charming', 'likable', 'adult-aged', 'son', 'have', 'go', 'level', 'express', 'admiration', 'what', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'film', 'How', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'friend', 'Mary', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'First', ""'re"", 'put', 'off', 'neediness', 'endless', 'chattering', 'Slowly', 'start', 'realize', 'wait', '*amazing*', 'performance', 'times', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'never', 'do', 'just', 'too', 'compelling.And', 'oh', 'were', 'director', 'would', 'put', 'Karina', 'Fernandez', 'single', 'one', 'movies']",N/A
1365591,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B003UESJIS,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[5, 6]","Any port in a storm.Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) are a long-married, comfortable upper middle class  couple. Long past cat and mouse games (the pun in their name once called ""brilliant,"" then not mentioned again), Tom is a successful geologist and Gerri a counselor. They are happy with their lives and have reached a point where the knowing look or wink becomes its own code.Their subtle love language and calm demeanor centers and stabilizes their social circle which, in Mike Leigh's intimate, disturbing ""Another Year,""  resembles a downward spiral.  Gerri's 20-year co-worker Mary (the picture's centerpiece, portrayed by Leslie Manville) is  a lonely, needy forty-something divorcee thinly portraying herself happy spending more time with more wine at Tom and Gerri's. Tom's bloated buddy Ken (Peter Wight) fights drink to forget his workaday job. Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) deals with the shock of losing wife Linda and with his bitter son Carl (Martin Savage, who jolts sour lightning into the final 30 minutes of what had been a low-key drama.) Characters and episodes (family cookout, funeral, golf game, gentle lunches forming Tom and Gerri's social life) split across four seasons forming the title.""Another Year"" meditates on self-acceptance. Tom and Gerri are happy to stay in, cook meals, grow tomatoes in their garden and share their bounty with friends. Mostly they listen, occasionally plying guests with drink we know they don't need. Mary and Peter, meanwhile, deny what age and bad choices have done to them, even attempting to deceive themselves. A scene where Mary takes Peter to the train station, then coldly refuses his advances provides one example., But more painful is Mary's failed pursuit of Tom and Gerri's son Joe and her cold treatment of Joe's fiance' Katie, leading to a rift in their friendship.Leigh's film also comprises everyday life vignettes. We learn in its first scenes the film provides no closure; a woman desperate for sleep and to overcome depression gets pills, is offered counseling, then leaves without our seeing her again. Ken does not return from his train ride; we see only glimpses of a nurse in Gerri's office who'd just had a baby. In a culture dominated by fabricated ""reality"" television, Leigh, cinematographer Dick Pope, and composer Gary Yershon let details accumulate, present them in  pastoral settings (backyard patios, gardens, even a golf course) and wrap them in subtle guitar/woodwind soundtrack belying the characters' angst and pain. It spoils nothing to say the dinner party, and life itself, went on after the lingering close-up of Mary closing the film. (The film clearly sends a message about alcohol being life's worst medicant and lubricant. The slogan on Ken's shirt - ""Less Thinking, More Drinking"" - becomes self-fulfilling.)Finally, ""Another Year""  is about validation. Mary looks for a young lover/cook/gardener to validate herself, but her choices are as wrong as red used car causing nothing but trouble from her starting it. Carl self-centeredly attacks his father and everyone in the room after his mother's cremation (which he irresponsibly missed by minutes). Tom and Gerri find enough validation in each other (although much of it unspoken), but more in friends' lives observed and commented on (but left unhelped and even enabled until the end.) No villains, heroes or even closure here: ""Another Year"" came between last year and next year, snapshots of a life developed slowly and empathetically.

1365592,A325KX422P54IS,B003UESJIS,"Bill the Cat ""Irish Film Nut""","[0, 0]","This film continues my love-hate relationship with Mike Leigh films. It has all the things I love about Leigh's films in spades. It feels paced as close to real life as is possible for a film, it has dialogue that seems as ordinary and imprecise as what you'll hear from real people in real life. It's well shot and very well acted.And I hated it.Why? Because it feels like some sick sort of emotional voyeurism, in which we're made to watch people suffer while their 'friends' casually accept their plight. As viewers we can all sit in judgement of the 'lucky' and 'unlucky' in this film and point out obvious reasons why their lives are what they are, or we can even imagine a backstory that explains how these people arrived at their current position in life because of past events and/or emotional trauma. As in most Mike Leigh films, you can accept that these characters did not come into existence the moment the camera rolled, but rather were living these lives when the camera showed up. And for me this fully fleshed-out and honest sense of reality is what made the suffering of these characters so unbearable to watch. Perhaps I have better friends than Tom and Jerri, because I found myself almost disgusted with the casual way in which they not only accepted the suffering of their 'friends', but by just how clueless they were about their own good fortune; living their lives and interacting with others as if everyone's destiny was set in stone and unchangeable. Tom and Jerri offer support for their 'friends', but it's a lazy, barely involved, purely superficial gesture. In the end, they essentially accept the fate of their supposed friends with the emotional equivalent of a shrug.This movie was very effective in stirring emotion in this viewer, unfortunately, the emotions I felt were all unpleasant and negative, and I certainly don't need to watch a fictional narrative to feel that way, as the real world is chock-full of opportunities to be disappointed and repulsed by human behavior. In the end I felt as if I'd watched a dog being kicked for two hours while not one person did a damn thing to stop it. Watching this movie may be an interesting intellectual exercise for some, but I couldn't in any context call it entertaining.",2,And my love-hate relationship with Mike Leigh films continues...,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,2255,"['film', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'films', 'things', 'love', 'Leigh', 'films', 'spades', 'paced', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'possible', 'film', 'dialogue', 'ordinary', 'imprecise', 'what', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'well', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'hated', 'it.Why', 'sick', 'sort', 'emotional', 'voyeurism', ""'re"", 'made', 'watch', 'people', 'suffer', ""'friends"", 'casually', 'accept', 'plight', 'viewers', 'can', 'sit', 'judgement', ""'lucky"", ""'unlucky"", 'film', 'point', 'out', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'why', 'lives', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'can', 'even', 'imagine', 'backstory', 'how', 'people', 'arrived', 'current', 'position', 'life', 'past', 'events', 'and/or', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'most', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'films', 'can', 'accept', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'existence', 'moment', 'camera', 'rolled', 'rather', 'were', 'living', 'lives', 'when', 'camera', 'showed', 'up', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'honest', 'sense', 'reality', 'what', 'made', 'suffering', 'characters', 'so', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'better', 'friends', 'Tom', 'Jerri', 'found', 'almost', 'disgusted', 'casual', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'accepted', 'suffering', ""'friends"", 'just', 'how', 'clueless', 'were', 'own', 'good', 'fortune', 'living', 'lives', 'interacting', 'others', 'everyone', 'destiny', 'was', 'set', 'stone', 'unchangeable', 'Tom', 'Jerri', 'offer', 'support', ""'friends"", 'lazy', 'barely', 'involved', 'purely', 'superficial', 'gesture', 'end', 'essentially', 'accept', 'fate', 'supposed', 'friends', 'emotional', 'equivalent', 'shrug.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'stirring', 'emotion', 'viewer', 'unfortunately', 'emotions', 'felt', 'were', 'unpleasant', 'negative', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'feel', 'way', 'real', 'world', 'chock-full', 'opportunities', 'be', 'disappointed', 'repulsed', 'human', 'behavior', 'end', 'felt', ""'d"", 'watched', 'dog', 'being', 'kicked', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'did', 'damn', 'thing', 'stop', 'Watching', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'could', ""n't"", 'context', 'call', 'entertaining']",N/A
1365593,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003UESJIS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 5]","FILM RATING:  2.5 starsLet me start by saying that Another Year (2010) is not a bad movie, as you might assume from my rating. Even though I didn't connect with it, it's a well made film that will connect with certain audiences who appreciate the subtle nuances of the story. Many film critics seem to love the movie, but I'm not one of them. It was just average for me...hence the 2.5 star rating.  I just couldn't get into the story and characters emotionally as much as I wanted to. The plot felt dragged out and a bit too boring.Writer/Director Mike Leigh, whose probably best known for Secrets & Lies (1996), continues his small character-driven indie films with Another Year. I haven't seen Secrets & Lies yet, but I'm definitely interested to see if its better than Another Year since I've heard such good things about it. Another Year was my first Mike Leigh film, and while I wasn't impressed with it, I could appreciate the artistic and technical craft that went into producing it. The production design and cinematography supported the story perfectly. The photography didn't stand out for me, but it wasn't bad either. I tend to favor more stylistic photography in my movies, but Director of Photography Dick Pope gave the film a realistic look and feel with lots of natural lighting that made it feel like the 4 different seasons in the UK.The lead actors all gave good solid performances within the story and writing they had to work with. Leslie Manville is probably the best performance, but her character also began to annoy me and get on my nerves by the end. She was just so clingy and immature. So kudos to Manville if that is what she and director Mike Leigh wanted to accomplish. But it didn't make for a character I could ultimately root for and want to watch again. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen were definitely believable as an older couple in the twilight years of their marriage.I watched Another Year on DVD, where it looked ok. I'm sure there is a color and picture quality difference that you see on blu-ray. So if you're going to check this film out, I would watch it in the high definition format and see if that helps you appreciate the film more. I'll be curious to see what Mike Leigh cooks up next.",3,Maybe a bit TOO realistic of a portrayal of life,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2233,"['FILM', 'RATING', '2.5', 'starsLet', 'start', 'saying', 'Year', '2010', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'might', 'assume', 'rating', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'will', 'connect', 'certain', 'audiences', 'who', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'story', 'Many', 'film', 'critics', 'seem', 'love', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'hence', '2.5', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'story', 'characters', 'emotionally', 'as', 'much', 'wanted', 'plot', 'felt', 'dragged', 'out', 'bit', 'too', 'boring.Writer/Director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Secrets', 'Lies', '1996', 'small', 'character-driven', 'indie', 'films', 'Year', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'yet', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'interested', 'see', 'better', 'Year', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'such', 'good', 'things', 'Year', 'was', 'first', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'could', 'appreciate', 'artistic', 'technical', 'craft', 'went', 'producing', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'supported', 'story', 'perfectly', 'photography', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'tend', 'favor', 'more', 'stylistic', 'photography', 'movies', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Dick', 'Pope', 'gave', 'film', 'realistic', 'look', 'feel', 'lots', 'natural', 'lighting', 'made', 'feel', '4', 'different', 'seasons', 'UK.The', 'lead', 'actors', 'gave', 'good', 'solid', 'performances', 'story', 'writing', 'had', 'work', 'Leslie', 'Manville', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'character', 'also', 'began', 'annoy', 'get', 'nerves', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'clingy', 'immature', 'So', 'kudos', 'Manville', 'what', 'director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'character', 'could', 'ultimately', 'root', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Ruth', 'Sheen', 'were', 'definitely', 'believable', 'older', 'couple', 'twilight', 'years', 'marriage.I', 'watched', 'Year', 'DVD', 'where', 'looked', 'ok', ""'m"", 'sure', 'color', 'picture', 'quality', 'difference', 'see', 'blu-ray', 'So', ""'re"", 'going', 'check', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'high', 'definition', 'format', 'see', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', ""'ll"", 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'up', 'next']",N/A
1365594,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJIS,Chris Pandolfi,"[20, 24]","If ""Another Year"" comes off as unsatisfying, perhaps that's a testament to director Mike Leigh's affinity for depicting real life as it naturally unfolds. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but it does have a strong sense of character, believable dialogue, and a definite theme, namely that life simply goes on. It's about ordinary people with ordinary problems; they may initially seem otherworldly, but they become more real as the film progresses, and by the end, we feel as if we've known them for years. This isn't to suggest that we automatically like all of them. You can understand a person and still think they're better suited in someone else's company. The film doesn't offer a lot in the way of resolution, but then again, neither does life, so I guess there's no sense in complaining.Taking place in England, the center of the story is Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen), and before you ask, yes, they get the occasional joke about how their names are pared. They're in their autumn years and have been married a long time. They're perfectly content; Tom is an engineering geologist, Gerri is a counselor, and after some years of travelling, the two now enjoy gardening and harvesting vegetables. Their thirty-year-old son, Joe (Oliver Maltman), hasn't yet found a girlfriend but is about as content as his parents. They address each other simply and don't seem to have any issues with one another. We follow them through the course of four seasons as they interact with friends and family, who all seem to suffer from some degree of unhappiness.The most prominent is Gerri's coworker, Mary (Lesley Manville). At first, she's a comical figure, a woman who can't seem to stop talking and always nurses a glass of wine. With every passing scene, she becomes more and more tragic until we realize that she's a desperately lonely alcoholic in serious need of professional help. She has known Joe since he was ten, and now that he's a man, she finds that she's incredibly attracted to him. He doesn't feel the same way, but he never avoids her; in fact, there are times when he makes it a point to have a conversation with her. And, when he finally does get a girlfriend, he isn't afraid to introduce her to Mary, who, as you can probably guess, is crushed. She realizes that she wasn't ready for her first marriage. She finally fell in love in her thirties, but it was to a man who ultimately divorced her and left her with nothing. At this advanced stage in her life, she just wants someone to talk to.Mary's life is symbolized by a used car she purchased with what little money she had stashed away. We never see it fall to pieces, but there are a couple of densely worded scenes in which she rants about the mechanical problems, the break-ins, and the financial woes they entail. She's a terrible driver and gets lost quite easily, even on routes she has successfully walked many times. She relies a little too often on take-away food, since she's not much of a cook and hasn't dated anyone who would take that responsibility. She says in an early scene that she's happy to be independent, but the fact is, she wants to be taken care of. Gerri addresses her just as simply as she does her husband; if she considers Mary a friend, then I find it peculiar she didn't make more of an effort to get her help. She is, after all, a counselor.Other characters are introduced. Some are written out much sooner than we'd expect them to be, begging the question of why they were included in the first place. Consider Tom's friend, Ken (Peter Wight), who's aging, overweight, a smoker, a drinker, and being dragged into retirement kicking and screaming. He realizes, with depressing clarity, that he doesn't want to take the train back home, for there's absolutely nothing there waiting for him. He's attracted to Mary. She most certainly doesn't feel the same way about him. The most curious character is Janet (Imelda Staunton), who appears in exactly two scenes as a clinically depressed insomniac unwilling to partake in Gerri's counseling. When the film was over, I was certain that nothing would have been lost had this character been eliminated.A more substantial but equally subdued subplot is introduced later in the film, when Tom attends the funeral of his sister-in-law and invites his brother, Ronnie (David Bradley), to stay with him for a couple of days. Ronnie's son, Carl (Martin Savage), is an undependable hothead who I suspect was that way long before the death of his mother. Ronnie and Mary eventually have a conversation, although Mary does most of the talking. Is this her story? It might seem that way, especially since she's the subject of the final shot. Still, I have a feeling that ""Another Year"" isn't anyone's story in particular. Friends come and go. Families get together and separate. People live, people die - seasons change. I grant you that this isn't a particularly fulfilling message. But this is a movie about the mundane, about still frames in people's lives. You see this movie, and then you move on.",4,"Seasons Change, Life Goes On",1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,5057,"['Year', 'off', 'unsatisfying', 'perhaps', 'testament', 'director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'affinity', 'depicting', 'real', 'life', 'naturally', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'character', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'definite', 'theme', 'namely', 'life', 'simply', 'ordinary', 'people', 'ordinary', 'problems', 'may', 'initially', 'seem', 'otherworldly', 'become', 'more', 'real', 'film', 'end', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'known', 'years', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'automatically', 'can', 'understand', 'person', 'still', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'suited', 'someone', 'else', 'company', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'lot', 'way', 'resolution', 'then', 'again', 'life', 'guess', 'sense', 'complaining.Taking', 'place', 'England', 'center', 'story', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Ruth', 'Sheen', 'ask', 'yes', 'get', 'occasional', 'joke', 'how', 'names', 'are', 'pared', ""'re"", 'autumn', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'long', 'time', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'content', 'Tom', 'engineering', 'geologist', 'Gerri', 'counselor', 'years', 'travelling', 'two', 'now', 'enjoy', 'gardening', 'harvesting', 'vegetables', 'thirty-year-old', 'son', 'Joe', 'Oliver', 'Maltman', ""n't"", 'yet', 'found', 'girlfriend', 'about', 'as', 'content', 'parents', 'address', 'other', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'issues', 'one', 'follow', 'course', 'four', 'seasons', 'interact', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'seem', 'suffer', 'degree', 'unhappiness.The', 'most', 'prominent', 'Gerri', 'coworker', 'Mary', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'first', 'comical', 'figure', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'talking', 'always', 'glass', 'wine', 'passing', 'scene', 'more', 'more', 'tragic', 'realize', 'desperately', 'lonely', 'alcoholic', 'serious', 'need', 'professional', 'help', 'known', 'Joe', 'was', 'ten', 'now', 'man', 'incredibly', 'attracted', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'never', 'fact', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'point', 'have', 'conversation', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'introduce', 'Mary', 'who', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'crushed', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'first', 'marriage', 'finally', 'fell', 'love', 'thirties', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'divorced', 'left', 'nothing', 'advanced', 'stage', 'life', 'just', 'someone', 'talk', 'to.Mary', 'life', 'symbolized', 'used', 'car', 'purchased', 'what', 'little', 'money', 'had', 'stashed', 'away', 'never', 'see', 'fall', 'pieces', 'are', 'couple', 'densely', 'worded', 'scenes', 'mechanical', 'problems', 'break-ins', 'financial', 'woes', 'entail', 'terrible', 'driver', 'lost', 'quite', 'easily', 'even', 'routes', 'successfully', 'walked', 'many', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'take-away', 'food', 'not', 'much', 'cook', ""n't"", 'dated', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'responsibility', 'early', 'scene', 'happy', 'be', 'independent', 'fact', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'Gerri', 'just', 'as', 'simply', 'husband', 'Mary', 'friend', 'then', 'find', 'peculiar', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'effort', 'get', 'help', 'counselor.Other', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'written', 'out', 'much', 'sooner', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'begging', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'included', 'first', 'place', 'Consider', 'Tom', 'friend', 'Ken', 'Peter', 'Wight', 'who', 'aging', 'overweight', 'smoker', 'drinker', 'being', 'dragged', 'retirement', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'depressing', 'clarity', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'train', 'back', 'home', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'there', 'waiting', 'attracted', 'Mary', 'most', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'curious', 'character', 'Janet', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'who', 'exactly', 'two', 'scenes', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'insomniac', 'unwilling', 'partake', 'Gerri', 'counseling', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'certain', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'had', 'character', 'been', 'eliminated.A', 'more', 'substantial', 'equally', 'subdued', 'subplot', 'introduced', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'Tom', 'funeral', 'sister-in-law', 'brother', 'Ronnie', 'David', 'Bradley', 'stay', 'couple', 'days', 'Ronnie', 'son', 'Carl', 'Martin', 'Savage', 'undependable', 'hothead', 'who', 'suspect', 'was', 'way', 'long', 'death', 'mother', 'Ronnie', 'Mary', 'eventually', 'have', 'conversation', 'Mary', 'most', 'talking', 'story', 'might', 'seem', 'way', 'especially', 'subject', 'final', 'shot', 'Still', 'have', 'feeling', 'Year', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'story', 'particular', 'Friends', 'come', 'go', 'Families', 'get', 'together', 'separate', 'People', 'live', 'people', 'die', 'seasons', 'change', 'grant', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'fulfilling', 'message', 'movie', 'mundane', 'still', 'frames', 'people', 'lives', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'move']",N/A

You may remember her from the 80's movie Peter's Friends. She does a superb job of acting, even though her character is only a minor role and not really integral to the story. The film then proceeds into the lives of the main characters; geologist Tom (Jim Broadbent) and his medical counsellor wife Gerri (Ruth Sheen). This charming couple and their relationships with other characters is the heart of the story... and they are just so lovely to watch. Then, there's Gerri's co-worker, Mary (Lesley Manville). Mary is self-involved with too many issues and problems, yet Tom and Gerri continue their generous kindness and patient support of their friend. The film tends to focus too much on Mary, but returns often enough to Tom and Gerri. This is a slow meandering journey through the lives of these characters. There is no bang or clatter of a plot, just a laid-back drama which requires a gentle reader.

Gone is the tight dialogue, gone is the insight, gone is the sometimes almost unbearable honesty. ""Another Year"" is a dire and lazy 129-minute mess of a film that should have been cut by at least half an hour. Even that might not have saved it.The movie is about an old couple, Tom and Gerri, a pair of two-dimensional supposedly intellectual characters who have enjoyed a comfortable life for decades in a nice part of London. In the words of Helen Fielding, they are ""smug marrieds"". They have a great time. But they have some friends who are not so fortunate. One is an alcoholic divorced co-worker of Gerri's who frets openly about her various lack of successes and another is an alcoholic friend of Tom's who has screwed up his life. They come for visits and are not so subtly put in their places. ""You screwed up and we didn't. We're happier than you,"" is the message.Well goodness. Do we need more than two hours to tell us that some people are happier than others and that it can be tough being single and short of money as you start to realise the years are running out? No we don't. We need a lot more subtlety than that, since Leigh puts before us a brutal and boring scenario.Did I say boring? Oh yes. It's boring, largely because the script is so hopeless lazy.

1365602,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003UESJIS,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","ANOTHER YEAR is another victory for Mike Leigh.  How he is able to write and create characters that embody the problems we all see around us and in us is nothing short of a little miracle.  This film is a microcosm of extended families and how they circle around the wounded members like feral animal groups, protecting, feeding, tending  and nurturing even the most impaired ones so that they know they are safe.  Leigh tackles a  number of problems we are seeing in our society - alcoholism, drug dependency, depression, coping with death, dissociation between child and parent, aging, retirement, an other forms of human frailties and instead of preaching about them he simply places his characters representing these problems before us for our consideration.The film opens quietly with an interview between a severely depressed insomniac Janet (Imelda Staunton) and a kind healthcare provider Tanya (Michele Austin): Janet just wants sleeping pills but finally agrees to accept Tanya's advice to seek counseling - Janet's counselor is Gerri (Ruth Sheen) who happens be one half of the couple that glues this film together, her husband being geologist Tom (Jim Broadbent).  This opening encounter sets the tone for the film: there are those who are genuinely happy (Tom and Gerri, both at retirement age but very close and share their hobby of gardening with the many friends who seek solace in their presence.  They have a son Joe (Oliver Maltman) who visits often, alone, sensitive about the fact that he is 30 and without a mate.  Their other friends in various stages of neediness include Mary (Lesley Manville, in a stunning performance) as divorced and deserted alcoholic whose loquacious self-centered personality usually ends her visits by sleeping over, unable to drive.  Mary feels her problems will resolve if she has a car and proceeds to buy a used car that is as undependable and prone to problems as is Mary.  Of interest, Gerri, Tanya and Mary all work in the same establishment and Tanya is also a frequent guest at Tom and Gerri's comfortable and comforting home.  Another frequent visitor is Tom's friend Ken (Peter Wight), an aging and lonely obese man who drinks constantly and fears going to his own quite empty solitary house: he is so desperate for female companionship that he approaches the needy Mary who will have nothing to do with him.  Mary fantasizes  a pairing with Joe, but the fantasy crashes when Joe finally brings home a girlfriend Katie (Karina Fernandez).The film is divided into seasons - spring, summer, autumn, winter - and as the seasons pass the only evidence of progress is the well ended garden of Tom and Gerri, a garden that is as happy and productive as its owners. As winter approaches a new character is introduced - Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) has just lost his wife when he discovers her dead body beside him one morning.  He turns to  Tom and Gerri for support and they with their extended family attend the simple funeral, a funeral completed by the time Ronnie's absentee angry son Carl (Martin Savage) arrives.  In the tiny wake that follows the camera dwells on each of the faces of the 'tribe' - lingering last on the empty vessel of Mary - and begs the question 'Why can some people find happiness while others cannot even imagine it?.'Writer/director Mike Leigh's ability to create profoundly moving stories simply by placing his camera on ordinary people's lives is a unique gift as a filmmaker. He is less interested in presenting answers as in posing questions, and he is aided in this successful effort with the work of some of Britain's finest actors. This is a gentle but powerful film.

His target is the baby-boomers who are unable today when they finally reach the age to retire, to face life with any positive outlook and project. They believed the world was theirs, especially after 1968, and they wake up to find the young are the kings in the pubs and everywhere else, that these young, even when they are their own children, consider they owe them nothing and at best do what they want without asking for advice. So they develop an unbearable life style, drinking too much, smoking too much, eating too much, doing no exercise, and expecting everyone else, especially the young, to be their servants, the satisfiers of their needs and desires, including vaguely sexual or sentimental impulses. And they hardly know how to take NO for an answer.They have become predators and cannibalistic predators what's more, and they suddenly wake up in a world where everyone is strict vegetarians. The cannibalism of leaks, tomatoes and courgettes, or should I say zucchinis, is not very attractive and even difficult to imagine. In other words they have cultivated in the private gardens of their minds a full homegrown schizophrenia that makes them totally misfit for life and the world. That's how you end up under a train or dangling from a beam, or, quite normal for baby-boomers, dying of an overdose.Even if Mike Leigh is making fun of these clowns of mid-life and menopause, his cruelty has no limit to show how vain and how pathetic they are in their little worlds so secluded that they do not know the world exists outside. They have not been able to find the second inspiration in their life they need to keep doing something or a few things when they retire not to sink without any hope to come back to the surface again, into depression, alcoholism, tobacco fixation, sexual drives, desires and delusions, and a fast train to hell even before dying. For them Alzheimer or simple senility will be early companions in their finishing life, finishing too early. Even simple tasks like working in the garden become chores and they don't know that a simple girdle would protect their backs from pain.This being said the film is irritatingly slow and speed-deprived, banal and tasteless, centered on innocuous and valueless artifacts like a cup of tea, a beer, a glass of wine multiplied ad infinitum, one funeral and the impossibility for these over-educated doctors or lawyers or therapists or geologists to understand there are so many other things of interest in the world and that any other human being is not only an animated virtual robot but a heart and a soul and a mind.The only moment when the film is slightly more humane is when the black pregnant lady-doctor is trying to help a woman fully engrossed with her menopause depression and that white patient is not even able to look at the doctor in the eyes and insists on getting her prescription and nothing else, unable to express what she must be thinking at this moment when she expects nothing from this... and there words are evading me to pinpoint the thinking of this woman who had never imagine that one day she might be in such a situation, discussing her personal problems with a black ... The baby scene of this black lady-doctor will be so flat later on that I just wonder if this film is not a manifesto against racism.Enjoy the film but keep in mind what Jimi Hendrix would think if he could come back in our world just for a couple of weeks of vacation from the hell where he must be rotting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,The baby-boomers have finally met with their fate: sad and pathetic.,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,3574,"['Mike', 'Leigh', 'supposed', 'be', 'cruel', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'target', 'baby-boomers', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'today', 'when', 'finally', 'reach', 'age', 'retire', 'face', 'life', 'positive', 'outlook', 'project', 'believed', 'world', 'was', 'theirs', 'especially', '1968', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'young', 'are', 'kings', 'pubs', 'everywhere', 'else', 'young', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'own', 'children', 'consider', 'owe', 'nothing', 'best', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'asking', 'advice', 'develop', 'unbearable', 'life', 'style', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'smoking', 'too', 'much', 'eating', 'too', 'much', 'doing', 'exercise', 'expecting', 'everyone', 'else', 'especially', 'young', 'be', 'servants', 'satisfiers', 'needs', 'desires', 'including', 'vaguely', 'sexual', 'sentimental', 'impulses', 'hardly', 'know', 'how', 'take', 'NO', 'answer.They', 'have', 'become', 'predators', 'cannibalistic', 'predators', 'what', 'more', 'suddenly', 'wake', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'strict', 'vegetarians', 'cannibalism', 'leaks', 'tomatoes', 'courgettes', 'should', 'say', 'zucchinis', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'even', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'cultivated', 'private', 'gardens', 'minds', 'full', 'homegrown', 'schizophrenia', 'totally', 'misfit', 'life', 'world', 'how', 'end', 'up', 'train', 'dangling', 'beam', 'quite', 'normal', 'baby-boomers', 'dying', 'overdose.Even', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'making', 'fun', 'clowns', 'mid-life', 'menopause', 'cruelty', 'limit', 'show', 'how', 'vain', 'how', 'pathetic', 'are', 'little', 'worlds', 'so', 'secluded', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'world', 'outside', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'second', 'inspiration', 'life', 'need', 'keep', 'doing', 'something', 'few', 'things', 'when', 'retire', 'not', 'sink', 'hope', 'come', 'back', 'surface', 'again', 'depression', 'alcoholism', 'tobacco', 'fixation', 'sexual', 'drives', 'desires', 'delusions', 'fast', 'train', 'hell', 'even', 'dying', 'Alzheimer', 'simple', 'senility', 'will', 'be', 'early', 'companions', 'finishing', 'life', 'finishing', 'too', 'early', 'Even', 'simple', 'tasks', 'working', 'garden', 'become', 'chores', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'simple', 'girdle', 'would', 'protect', 'backs', 'pain.This', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'irritatingly', 'slow', 'speed-deprived', 'banal', 'tasteless', 'centered', 'innocuous', 'valueless', 'artifacts', 'cup', 'tea', 'beer', 'glass', 'wine', 'multiplied', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'one', 'funeral', 'impossibility', 'over-educated', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'therapists', 'geologists', 'understand', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'interest', 'world', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'animated', 'virtual', 'robot', 'heart', 'soul', 'mind.The', 'only', 'moment', 'when', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'humane', 'when', 'black', 'pregnant', 'lady-doctor', 'trying', 'help', 'woman', 'fully', 'engrossed', 'menopause', 'depression', 'white', 'patient', 'not', 'even', 'able', 'look', 'doctor', 'eyes', 'insists', 'getting', 'prescription', 'nothing', 'else', 'unable', 'express', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'thinking', 'moment', 'when', 'nothing', 'words', 'are', 'evading', 'pinpoint', 'thinking', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'imagine', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'be', 'such', 'situation', 'discussing', 'personal', 'problems', 'black', 'baby', 'scene', 'black', 'lady-doctor', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'flat', 'later', 'just', 'wonder', 'film', 'not', 'manifesto', 'racism.Enjoy', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'what', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'come', 'back', 'world', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'vacation', 'hell', 'where', 'must', 'be', 'rotting.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Still, it is a wonderful character study, a slowly unspooling story of how people make themselves -- yes -- happy or unhappy through their actions and, in some cases, their self-deception.  Many scenes from Another Year remain with me a couple weeks after seeing the film -- Tom and Gerri having tea under a makeshift shelter as they are caught in the rain at their community garden patch; the awkward moment when the sad sack Mary brings them a bottle of Argentine wine because she thinks they visited there; the near catatonic mourning of Tom's brother at the loss of his wife; and late in the film Gerri telling Mary that people have to take responsibility for their lives.  None of the events in the movie are hyped beyond what they are -- scenes in lives well or not-so-well lived through one year, and the implication that the year, portrayed so well by all the actors and Leigh's unobtrusive direction, is a microcosm of all the years of the characters's lives.",5,"The Kinder, Gentler Mike Leigh Continues",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1079,"['thought', 'Happy', 'Go', 'Lucky', 'was', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'best', 'film', 'Year', 'not', 'quite', 'match', 'high', 'standard', 'Still', 'wonderful', 'character', 'study', 'slowly', 'unspooling', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'make', 'yes', 'happy', 'unhappy', 'actions', 'cases', 'self-deception', 'Many', 'scenes', 'Year', 'remain', 'couple', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'film', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'having', 'tea', 'makeshift', 'shelter', 'are', 'caught', 'rain', 'community', 'garden', 'patch', 'awkward', 'moment', 'when', 'sad', 'sack', 'Mary', 'bottle', 'Argentine', 'wine', 'visited', 'near', 'catatonic', 'mourning', 'Tom', 'brother', 'loss', 'wife', 'late', 'film', 'Gerri', 'telling', 'Mary', 'people', 'have', 'take', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'None', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'hyped', 'what', 'are', 'scenes', 'lives', 'well', 'not-so-well', 'lived', 'one', 'year', 'implication', 'year', 'portrayed', 'so', 'well', 'actors', 'Leigh', 'unobtrusive', 'direction', 'microcosm', 'years', 'characters', 'lives']",N/A

Like many of us, they garden and recycle and wonder if it does any good as they bemoan the corporate control of the world.  They have a 30-year-old son, Joe.  But the movie is mostly about Mary, Gerri's friend, a receptionist at the office where Gerri is a counselor.  Mary (played superbly by Lesley Manville) hangs out a lot at Tom and Gerri's.  Hoping to find freedom, she buys a car, but no one who drinks like she does has any business with a car.  She thinks a man is the answer to her search for happiness, but she has no sense of who is a possible partner for her.  Along the way of her growing awakening we meet other characters, the most wondrous of whom is Tom's nephew, who shows up late and seethingly angry at his mother's funeral.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[6, 7]","When you see a movie by Mike Leigh, you expect a film with a minimum of plot, a quiet, deliberate pace and characters who are quite ordinary human beings; people we know, or even us.  Yet, despite the absence of gunfire, explosions or overly dramatic sequences, you find yourself mesmerized, completely drawn into the lives of these emotionally damaged characters.ANOTHER YEAR(2010), which earned Leigh an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, is no different.Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) have been married for over thirty years and have the quintessential happy marriage.  He's an engineer and she's a counselor.  Together they serve as a steady anchor to their unmarried circle of family and friends, including Mary (Lesley Manville), Gerri's alcoholic, overly needy co-worker, who desperately wants to find her ""Prince Charming"" (but never will).  In fact, at one point, she fantasizes that Tom and Gerri's grown son, considerably her junior, might fulfill that dream for her.  When he turns up with his beautiful young girl friend, Mary is devastated.Mary's storyline dominates this engrossing drama about the vicissitudes of family and friendship, following the lives of these characters over a one-year period.Ms. Manville is brilliant as a woman ""drowning in quicksand,"" who cannot help herself and, by film's end, is simply tolerated by her friends.  The final lonely image of her, sitting at a table full of happy people, is unforgettable.ANOTHER YEAR is available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

1365613,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B003UESJIS,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","I was certainly looking forward to seeing this acclaimed Mike Leigh film.  We are introduced to a middle aged London couple enjoying each other and their lives.  Tom (Jim Broadbent) is an engineering geologist and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) a psychologist/counselor in a medical center.  They have a 30 year old son, Joe (Oliver Maltman) who is an attorney.  The couple spends all of their non-work hours talking, reading and working in their city garden.  All is well, so where's the movie?Tom and Gerri (yes they get it too) each have their drunken friends who border on being sociopaths.  Mary (an excellent Lesley Manville) is a co-worker/secretary whose life is in shambles due to her husband recently deserting her.  She is probably in her late 40's to early 50's and is having a hard time coming to grips with the fact that she may not be marrying material again.  So much so that she flirts and hopes that something romantic will occur between her and the much younger son of her friend.  When that doesn't work she even comes on to Tom's older brother fresh off the funeral of his wife.  Mary is a mess and a burgeoning alcoholic.  But kind Tom and Gerri put up with her.  But Mary won't put up with Tom's best friend Ken (Peter Wight) who is a card carrying alcoholic, heavy smoker and non-stop eater.  He has his baggage as well.  Gerri and Tom put up with him as also.  That's about it.Leigh (who also wrote the screenplay) moves around the interaction between the characters, mostly in the kitchen of Tom and Gerri's home.  I doubt most of us would have the patience to handle these social misfits, but I guess that is Leigh's point.  At 2 hours and 10 minutes I certainly had enough. As you would expect, the Blu ray disc looks great.  While there are a few exterior shots, most of the film is shot inside on sound stages.  The DTS-HD surround is fine with the dialog clear.

People with flaws, people who are not movie star handsome, people we know, like our neighbors, our inlaws, our children. Mike Leigh has written and directed this superb film about these people.Tom, played by Jim Broadbent, and Gerry, played by Ruth Sheen live in North London. They have been married for years, happily married, even. They have a son, Joe, played by oliver Maltman, who loves his parents and seems to be a perfectly normal young man. He is looking for a soulmate and feels the pressure from his parents, at times. Gerry is a therapist. For thirty years she has worked with Mary, superbly played by Lesley Manville, a secretary who has porblems. She wants the perfect man who will never be available, and she drinks too much to get her through her day. She has glammed on to Tom and Gerry. Their home is a warm, inviting place, and they are not judgemental. After a perfectly hideous evening of too much drinking and obvious jealousy of Joe's new girlfriend, Tom says of Mary, ""It's Sad"" That really says it all. A family funeral portrays a funeral like no other, but does point out the foibles we see in other families, and sometimes our own.  All this time, going home to Tom and Gerry's is the best place to be. Tom and Gerry love their friends and family and support them, through thick and thin. We see much of the thin in this film, but that is real life.Mike Leigh has given us a film where we feel embarrassment, amusement and sadness. This is real life, folks. We all know folks like this and maybe it is us. We are peeking into the lives of people who have foibles and we can learn from their predicaments, and from the manner that Tom and Gerry deal with life and with these folks they welcome into their lives. This is a film that gave me a sense of joy, that good folks like Tom and Gerry abound. Life is not all about the beautiful people making too much money and getting into too much trouble.

1365615,A3GIESLBKUBGZQ,B003UESJIS,Richard R. Powell,"[2, 2]","Much has been written about this film already and I will try not to retrace ground already covered. It is not a film for those who want tidy endings or a formulaic sequence of feel-good moments. Those negative reviewers who say they hate it are perhaps telling us more about themselves than about the film. But I will grant that it takes a certain perspective to appreciate all that is going on in this beautifully crafted work of art.I came to the reviews to find out what others thought of the film because I was deeply moved by it. Now, I am close in age to many of the main characters, and can relate in some way to all of them, so maybe that is part of the reason it hit me so hard. Whatever the reasons, I gained real insight about human development, the root of loneliness, and the components of contentment.Gerri and Tom are beautiful people who radiate an almost saintly magnetism but with all the traits of real people. Can we hope to achieve their level of maturity? You can watch the film just to enjoy their resonant calm.The tension in the movie is created by the various wounded individuals who come and go, particularly the central character Mary. Lesley Manville's portrayal of Mary is impressively achingly believable. The changes in this character from the beginning of the film to the end are subtle and rich. With seemingly only the movement of her eyes and turn of her mouth we feel how deeply she is descending into grief about all the possibilities that have slipped away. As other reviewers have noted, Mary is by turns self-absorbed, flawed, deluded, and desperate, but lovable at the end in her epiphany and continued hope in the wrong things (i.e. a romance).When Gerri, towards the end of the film, tells Mary she needs to talk to a professional, we see how resistant the psyche can be to admitting it's own troubles. We see how hard it is to shift out of old patterns of thought and longing, how hard it is to wake up to who we really are.As a viewer I wanted to tell Mary to just relax, to take stock of what she had going for her, to spend some time developing and appreciating herself. But the bright sparks of fortune she has in her life seem to dwindle under the darkness of mortality and her fear of loneliness.There is a complex ""message"" in the film. Something to do with facing what is, thinking of others, and generally growing up. The story's fabric contains sub-threads about social skills, the advantages of intelligence/education, and how we get stuck.Mary's ""style"" of interacting with others is similar to Joe's girlfriend Katie's style (both extroverted and lively), but while both are interestingly animated, Mary's escalates to a manic level before crashing. Part of the attraction of the film is trying to figure out what makes Katie's style work so well, while Mary's overloads the nerves. Are we looking at the same basic person in different contexts?I have not seen other films by Mike Leigh, but if this one is anything to go on, I have some enjoyable viewing ahead of me!",4,Sparks of Enlightenment Amid the Grief,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,3026,"['Much', 'been', 'written', 'film', 'already', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'retrace', 'ground', 'already', 'covered', 'not', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'tidy', 'endings', 'formulaic', 'sequence', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'hate', 'are', 'perhaps', 'telling', 'more', 'film', 'will', 'grant', 'certain', 'perspective', 'appreciate', 'going', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'work', 'art.I', 'came', 'reviews', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'others', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Now', 'am', 'close', 'age', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'way', 'so', 'maybe', 'part', 'reason', 'hit', 'so', 'hard', 'Whatever', 'reasons', 'gained', 'real', 'insight', 'human', 'development', 'root', 'loneliness', 'components', 'contentment.Gerri', 'Tom', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'radiate', 'almost', 'saintly', 'magnetism', 'traits', 'real', 'people', 'Can', 'hope', 'achieve', 'level', 'maturity', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'enjoy', 'resonant', 'calm.The', 'tension', 'movie', 'created', 'various', 'wounded', 'individuals', 'who', 'come', 'go', 'particularly', 'central', 'character', 'Mary', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'impressively', 'achingly', 'believable', 'changes', 'character', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'subtle', 'rich', 'seemingly', 'only', 'movement', 'eyes', 'turn', 'mouth', 'feel', 'how', 'deeply', 'descending', 'grief', 'possibilities', 'have', 'slipped', 'away', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Mary', 'turns', 'self-absorbed', 'flawed', 'deluded', 'desperate', 'lovable', 'end', 'epiphany', 'continued', 'hope', 'wrong', 'things', 'i.e', 'romance', '.When', 'Gerri', 'end', 'film', 'tells', 'Mary', 'talk', 'professional', 'see', 'how', 'resistant', 'psyche', 'can', 'be', 'admitting', 'own', 'troubles', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'shift', 'old', 'patterns', 'thought', 'longing', 'how', 'hard', 'wake', 'up', 'who', 'really', 'are.As', 'viewer', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Mary', 'just', 'relax', 'take', 'stock', 'what', 'had', 'going', 'spend', 'time', 'developing', 'appreciating', 'bright', 'sparks', 'fortune', 'life', 'seem', 'dwindle', 'darkness', 'mortality', 'fear', 'loneliness.There', 'complex', 'message', 'film', 'Something', 'do', 'facing', 'what', 'thinking', 'others', 'generally', 'growing', 'up', 'story', 'fabric', 'sub-threads', 'social', 'skills', 'advantages', 'intelligence/education', 'how', 'get', 'stuck.Mary', 'style', 'interacting', 'others', 'similar', 'Joe', 'girlfriend', 'Katie', 'style', 'extroverted', 'lively', 'are', 'interestingly', 'animated', 'Mary', 'escalates', 'manic', 'level', 'crashing', 'Part', 'attraction', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Katie', 'style', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Mary', 'nerves', 'Are', 'looking', 'same', 'basic', 'person', 'different', 'contexts', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'one', 'anything', 'go', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'ahead']",N/A

1365617,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003UESJIS,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2Watching a Mike Leigh movie is a bit like eavesdropping on the lives and conversations of people we may not know personally but whom we sure do recognize, since we see so much of ourselves reflected in them.  Part of the reason for this is that Leigh always casts his films with actors who look as little like conventional movie stars as one can imagine (Hollywood, please take note).  It's also because the characters he concerns himself with are ordinary middle- and working class folk, many of them middle-aged, who are suddenly waking up to the fact this may indeed be all there is to life - just a series of ruts and dull routines on the inexorable, if sometimes dawdling, march towards impending death.The individuals in Leigh's latest work, ""Another Year,"" perfectly fit the bill.  There's Mary (Lesley Manville), a ditzy divorcee who worries she'll never meet the right man, and Ken (Peter Wight), a brooding, lonely, overweight man who feels keenly the loss of his youth; then there's Imelda Staunton in a very small role as a woman trapped in a state of depression so severe she cannot recall a single happy moment in her life.At the core of the film, however, lie Gerri (Ruth Sheen) and Tom (Jim Broadbent), a happily married couple who somehow seem to have come to terms with the realities of life and aging and, thus, serve as pillars of moral strength and emotional stability that others can lean on in times of stress.As the title suggests, the story spans a twelve-month period, with the script divided into four parts, one for each season.  The ""story,"" such as it is, is basically a series of social gatherings (including one funeral) in which the characters discuss the day-to-day realities of their lives.  Only Gerri and Tom remain generally reticent, preferring rather to lend an ear and offer advice than to articulate their own views on life and relationships.  As such, they provide a great calming presence both for the other characters and for the audience, and we can see why each of these individuals is emotionally drawn to them.The flawless cast also features Oliver Maltman as Gerri and Tom's thirty-year-old son, Joe; David Bradley as Tom's recently widowed brother, Ronnie; and Martin Savage as Ronnie's ne'er-do-well son, Ronnie.Set in and around London, Leigh's screenplay makes art out of small-talk, as hurting people hide their pain under a veneer of everyday banter and banalities.  And it's only in rare moments that those true feelings rise to the surface and manifest themselves for all to see.

I will tell you what I thought about it.  Like THE SOCIAL NETWORK, the thing I liked the most about ANOTHER YEAR was the amazing dialogue.  The actors don't do much in the film, but I understood who they were and what they were like from what they said to eachother.  In some ways, the dialgue reminded me of something Harold Pinter would've written--especially THE HOMECOMING.  Check out the conversation between Mary and Ronnie.  You can tell how awkward and uncomfortable Mary was talking to Ronnie through her dialogue.  To me, that was the brilliance of ANOTHER YEAR.  For a lackluster year, it was definitely one of the best films of the year for moviegoers who appreciate good writing snd acting.  Don't bother seeing it if you have a short attention span.

The main characters are `Stepford Wives' automatons, always saying the right thing at the right time simply because it seems to be the right thing to say.  The core family around which the movie revolves (father, wife, and grown son) are studies in shallowness and superficiality.  It wouldn't be true to say that they wouldn't know a real emotion or thought if it bit them, but that they avoid such disruptions of their `astroturf' world like the plague.Conversations and family discussions generally consist of recountings of substance-free past trivialities, trivial current events, and snappy one-liners intended to show their wit and mental agility, but which evidence a disturbing vacuous pathology instead.  The brother of the father/husband adds another dimension of Stepford drollness by skipping the superficiality of trite and largely meaningless conversation and simply says virtually nothing at all, sort of a study in Stepford superficial muteness and inner dullardness.The character that moves the movie is the great ""Mary"", Gerry's (the wife) co-worker and longtime friend.  Mary makes the mistake of actually having real emotions underneath her attempted and often failed `Stepford-speak' (which she seems to have picked up from hanging around Gerry too much), and worse yet, having them for the Stepford son.  At first, she seems to be merely a deeply disturbed neurotic, but as the story unfolds it seems that she is actually the only sane one of the bunch, being cursed with the possession of real emotions while surrounded by emotionally eviscerated automatons, only neither she nor her friends that she tries so hard to please realize it.""Another Year"" presents an accurate portrayal and dramatized critique of a far too common sociological defect and is definitely worth seeing.",4,Revenge of the Stepfords,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,1882,"['Great', 'performances', 'actors', 'portraying', 'characters', 'are', 'anything', 'great', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'automatons', 'always', 'saying', 'right', 'thing', 'right', 'time', 'simply', 'be', 'right', 'thing', 'say', 'core', 'family', 'movie', 'father', 'wife', 'grown', 'son', 'are', 'studies', 'shallowness', 'superficiality', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'emotion', 'thought', 'avoid', 'such', 'disruptions', 'astroturf', 'world', 'plague.Conversations', 'family', 'discussions', 'generally', 'consist', 'recountings', 'substance-free', 'past', 'trivialities', 'trivial', 'current', 'events', 'snappy', 'one-liners', 'intended', 'show', 'wit', 'mental', 'agility', 'evidence', 'disturbing', 'vacuous', 'pathology', 'instead', 'brother', 'father/husband', 'dimension', 'Stepford', 'drollness', 'skipping', 'superficiality', 'trite', 'largely', 'meaningless', 'conversation', 'simply', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'sort', 'study', 'Stepford', 'superficial', 'muteness', 'inner', 'dullardness.The', 'character', 'movie', 'great', 'Mary', 'Gerry', 'wife', 'co-worker', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Mary', 'mistake', 'actually', 'having', 'real', 'emotions', 'attempted', 'often', 'failed', 'Stepford-speak', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'hanging', 'around', 'Gerry', 'too', 'much', 'worse', 'yet', 'having', 'Stepford', 'son', 'first', 'be', 'merely', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'neurotic', 'story', 'actually', 'only', 'sane', 'one', 'bunch', 'being', 'cursed', 'possession', 'real', 'emotions', 'surrounded', 'emotionally', 'eviscerated', 'automatons', 'only', 'friends', 'so', 'hard', 'please', 'realize', 'Year', 'presents', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'dramatized', 'critique', 'far', 'too', 'common', 'sociological', 'defect', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
1365622,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B003UESJIS,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 1]","This 2010 film has the usual Leigh hallmarks -- detailed attention to ordinary lives, an absence of melodrama, a strong ensemble cast, and an emotional force that is not diminished by the focus on the everyday.  All the performances are fine, but Lesley Manville's portrayal of the needy and near-alcoholic Mary is particularly noteworthy, for she is the source of the tension in the film and a weak performance in that role would have been very damaging.  Mary's needs are acknowledged and to a certain extent enabled by Tom and Gerri, a married couple nearing retirement age.  He is a geologist, she a counselor at a clinic.  We first see Gerri dealing with a client, played by the great Imelda Staunton in a cameo, who is rendered mute by unhappiness.  We never see Staunton again, but a mood has been set, and although Mary is as garrulous as Staunton's character is uncommunicative, we see throughout the film the texture of her unhappiness too.  She is divorced and needs connection (and would like a man in her life), and we see how Tom's and Gerri's kindness to her leads her to see herself almost as part of their family (with pathetic designs on their son, who is considerably younger than she is), until in the final section of the movie a line is crossed and boundaries, hitherto tacit, are made explicit.The movie is divided into four sections, each corresponding to a season, and in the first three Mary's interactions with Tom and Gerri are as an invited guest  (she works as a receptionist at the clinic where Gerri works, and they have known each other for twenty years).  A pretense is kept up in these social gatherings that Mary is moving towards independence and a fuller life, although Mary's white wine consumption and occasional drunken laments let us see how empty the likelihood of independence and maturity is for her.  Her disappointments with her new (to her) car -- a symbol of her sense of herself as beginning a new life bravely -- and with the fact that Tom and Gerri's son gets a girlfriend are painful to watch, but the writing is so good throughout that we never feel that the characters communicate with one another in a way that isn't credible.The ""Winter"" section of the movie is a genuine climax, notwithstanding Leigh's resolute eschewal of overstatement or drama.  In the interest of not giving too much away, I will only say that here a boundary is crossed and things need to be said that Gerri perhaps hoped she would never have to say -- not that her saying them is ""explosive"" or obviously climactic.  But it's in that final section that Mary, at her most pathetic, also has her finest hour, for what it's worth.  Tom's recently widowed brother Ron is staying with the family, and Mary comes to the house not knowing that he's there and at a time when Tom and Gerri are out.  From the moment that Ron opens the door until Tom's and Gerri's return, the interaction of Mary and Ron is absolutely riveting -- literally suspenseful.  The dialogue between them, which is pretty minimal, shows us Mary as we haven't quite seen her before but in a way that is utterly consistent with what we have seen.  This is acting on a very high level from both Manville and David Bradley, who plays Ron.By the end nothing is resolved, and yet both we and the characters know and understand things we didn't know earlier.  And to be fair to the other actors, all of them show, as the movie goes on, characters who have the capacity to surprise us.  All that need to be added is that the cinematography is unobtrusively excellent, and the music catches the melancholy that is an important facet of the story but by no means the only one.",5,Another fine movie from Mike Leigh,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,3663,"['2010', 'film', 'usual', 'Leigh', 'hallmarks', 'detailed', 'attention', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'absence', 'melodrama', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'emotional', 'force', 'not', 'diminished', 'focus', 'everyday', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'portrayal', 'needy', 'near-alcoholic', 'Mary', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'source', 'tension', 'film', 'weak', 'performance', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'damaging', 'Mary', 'needs', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'certain', 'extent', 'enabled', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'married', 'couple', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'age', 'geologist', 'counselor', 'clinic', 'first', 'see', 'Gerri', 'dealing', 'client', 'played', 'great', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'cameo', 'who', 'rendered', 'mute', 'unhappiness', 'never', 'see', 'Staunton', 'again', 'mood', 'been', 'set', 'Mary', 'as', 'garrulous', 'Staunton', 'character', 'uncommunicative', 'see', 'film', 'texture', 'unhappiness', 'too', 'divorced', 'needs', 'connection', 'would', 'like', 'man', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'kindness', 'leads', 'see', 'almost', 'part', 'family', 'pathetic', 'designs', 'son', 'who', 'considerably', 'younger', 'final', 'section', 'movie', 'line', 'crossed', 'boundaries', 'hitherto', 'tacit', 'are', 'made', 'explicit.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'four', 'sections', 'corresponding', 'season', 'first', 'three', 'Mary', 'interactions', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'are', 'invited', 'guest', 'receptionist', 'clinic', 'where', 'Gerri', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'twenty', 'years', 'pretense', 'kept', 'up', 'social', 'gatherings', 'Mary', 'moving', 'towards', 'independence', 'fuller', 'life', 'Mary', 'white', 'wine', 'consumption', 'occasional', 'drunken', 'laments', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'empty', 'likelihood', 'independence', 'maturity', 'disappointments', 'new', 'car', 'symbol', 'sense', 'herself', 'beginning', 'new', 'life', 'bravely', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'writing', 'so', 'good', 'never', 'feel', 'characters', 'communicate', 'one', 'way', ""n't"", 'credible.The', 'Winter', 'section', 'movie', 'genuine', 'climax', 'notwithstanding', 'Leigh', 'resolute', 'eschewal', 'overstatement', 'drama', 'interest', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'here', 'boundary', 'crossed', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'Gerri', 'perhaps', 'hoped', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'saying', 'explosive', 'obviously', 'climactic', 'final', 'section', 'Mary', 'most', 'pathetic', 'also', 'finest', 'hour', 'what', 'worth', 'Tom', 'recently', 'widowed', 'brother', 'Ron', 'staying', 'family', 'Mary', 'house', 'not', 'knowing', 'there', 'time', 'when', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'are', 'out', 'moment', 'Ron', 'door', 'Tom', 'Gerri', 'return', 'interaction', 'Mary', 'Ron', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'literally', 'suspenseful', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'Mary', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seen', 'way', 'utterly', 'consistent', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'acting', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'Manville', 'David', 'Bradley', 'who', 'Ron.By', 'end', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'yet', 'characters', 'know', 'understand', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'earlier', 'be', 'fair', 'other', 'actors', 'show', 'movie', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'capacity', 'surprise', 'need', 'be', 'added', 'cinematography', 'unobtrusively', 'excellent', 'music', 'melancholy', 'important', 'facet', 'story', 'only', 'one']",N/A
