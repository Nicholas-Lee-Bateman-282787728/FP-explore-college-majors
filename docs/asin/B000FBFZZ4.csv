987319,A3PD0NM46NWGU6,B000FBFZZ4,Carlos,"[4, 6]","These ""unauthorized/under review/critical overview/etc"" DVD's are a dime a dozen. Practically half of the DVD section at my local record shop is now comprised of these cheap knock-offs. I can understand the frustration of Smiths fans who were hoping for an all encompassing documentary on what made these Mancunian mopesters tick but if you're familiar with the ""Under Review"" series you really ought to lower your expectations...I mean..REALLY lower them. After all, this entire ""Under Review"" series is just a half step above a bootleg.That said, Stephen Street, John Porter and Craig Gannon ARE worth listening to and the no-name journalists who rehash the story of The Smiths do a concise if somewhat repetitive and generic job. The actual clips of The Smiths are all taken from ""The Complete Picture"" DVD so if you have that and you've read ""Morrissey And Marr: The Severed Alliance"" you basically have this DVD already.I think the main problem with this DVD is that way WAY too much time is devoted to interviewing these so-called rock writers. Often times they have nothing to say about the subject at hand (the ""How Soon Is Now"" single, the ""Meat Is Murder"" album etc.) but their babbling is included anyway just to fill up the time.This DVD probably would've been more effective at 60 minutes and with a little more judicious editing.If you're a Smiths fan..and you're not expecting much from a rush job..you might enjoy reliving it all again.",3,I was'nt expecting much but...,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1452,"['unauthorized/under', 'review/critical', 'overview/etc', 'DVD', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'Practically', 'half', 'DVD', 'section', 'local', 'record', 'shop', 'now', 'comprised', 'cheap', 'knock-offs', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'Smiths', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'encompassing', 'documentary', 'what', 'made', 'Mancunian', 'mopesters', 'tick', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Review', 'series', 'really', 'ought', 'lower', 'expectations', 'mean..REALLY', 'lower', 'entire', 'Review', 'series', 'just', 'half', 'step', 'bootleg.That', 'said', 'Stephen', 'Street', 'John', 'Porter', 'Craig', 'Gannon', 'ARE', 'worth', 'listening', 'no-name', 'journalists', 'who', 'rehash', 'story', 'Smiths', 'do', 'concise', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'generic', 'job', 'actual', 'clips', 'Smiths', 'are', 'taken', 'Complete', 'Picture', 'DVD', 'so', 'have', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Morrissey', 'Marr', 'Severed', 'Alliance', 'basically', 'have', 'DVD', 'already.I', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'DVD', 'way', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'interviewing', 'so-called', 'rock', 'writers', 'Often', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'subject', 'hand', 'How', 'Soon', 'Now', 'single', 'Meat', 'Murder', 'album', 'etc', 'babbling', 'included', 'anyway', 'just', 'fill', 'up', 'time.This', 'DVD', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'effective', '60', 'minutes', 'little', 'more', 'judicious', 'editing.If', ""'re"", 'Smiths', 'fan..and', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'rush', 'job..you', 'might', 'enjoy', 'reliving', 'again']",N/A

For what? I got hosed, the DVD says there are 'extended interviews' which I assumed was of the band, NO. Here we get ramblings of past producers whom offer little we already know about the band. I was at least looking forward to what Stephen Street had to say, since he produced some of my all time favorite albums, but what a drab that guy is. Of all the sessions he had with band all he could say is 'Johnny Marr' is brilliant? WOW! Thanks man! I shelled out $20 to hear that? THIS IS A COMPLETE SHAM RIP OFF!!

Rosenberg ""pop culturalist""","[0, 2]","This series of DVDs is inherently limited by its low budgets and lack of ""official"" authorization, but this is one of the more satisfying releases of its kind I've seen, and for anyone hungry to learn more about the most important British band of the 80s (and that might be putting it too mildly) and see at least a taste of rare footage, it's compelling viewing.  I found the contributors largely interesting and often amusing.  The extensive dialogues with producers John Porter and Stephen Street are fascinating to anyone curious about how they put some of their records together.  Yes, there are some omissions in the too-quick career overview, and the band members themselves are conspicuous by their absence, but again, that's the limitations of the form, and within those limitations I think this video succeeds very satisfactorily.  If the Smiths' classic catalog ever gets the overhaul it so richly deserves, I hope there will be an official documentary produced that leaves this one behind in the dust.  In the meantime, if you wish you had a better, or another, Smiths DVD than Complete Picture, this will do nicely, especially if you can pick it up used at a decent price.",4,"Far from definitive, but the best out there for now",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1185,"['series', 'DVDs', 'inherently', 'limited', 'low', 'budgets', 'lack', 'official', 'authorization', 'one', 'more', 'satisfying', 'releases', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anyone', 'hungry', 'learn', 'more', 'most', 'important', 'British', 'band', '80s', 'might', 'be', 'putting', 'too', 'mildly', 'see', 'least', 'taste', 'rare', 'footage', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'found', 'contributors', 'largely', 'interesting', 'often', 'amusing', 'extensive', 'dialogues', 'producers', 'John', 'Porter', 'Stephen', 'Street', 'are', 'fascinating', 'anyone', 'curious', 'how', 'put', 'records', 'together', 'Yes', 'are', 'omissions', 'too-quick', 'career', 'overview', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'again', 'limitations', 'form', 'limitations', 'think', 'video', 'very', 'satisfactorily', 'Smiths', 'classic', 'catalog', 'ever', 'overhaul', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'official', 'documentary', 'produced', 'one', 'behind', 'dust', 'meantime', 'wish', 'had', 'better', 'Smiths', 'DVD', 'Complete', 'Picture', 'will', 'do', 'nicely', 'especially', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'used', 'decent', 'price']",N/A

The contributors were journalists and critics as well as some producers and engineers who worked with the band; And let's not forget Craig Gannon, a.k.a. the 5th Smith. The commentary was more enjoyable than insightful for the most part. You'll get more out of reading the books that you probably already own. Although I found Gannon interesting in that he really seems to respect the band so much despite his obviously feeling that he got screwed over and badly mistreated.As others have noted, the quiz is fun... I also got 20 which graded out as ""Excellent"". Otherwise the extras are lacking. I was somewhat disappointed that the commentary basically just tracks the singles chronologically.
