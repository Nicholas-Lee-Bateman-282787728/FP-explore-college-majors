945643,A1DGAYHCDXE7FU,B000BNX3AU,AH-1Z,"[35, 63]","As far as movies go, you must love ""dogs"" to like this one.  The story is totally predictable, the dialogue is banal, the direction is wooden and the pace can be charitably described as glacial.  The movie is like that battery rabbit-""It just keeps going and going and going"".Yes, it's a 'chick flick', but that doesn't explain why this one just lays there.  Yes, we have the requisite gorgeous and intelligent female protagonist who inexplicably thinks she can't enter into a relationship.  We have the sensitive ""diamond in the rough"" man who doesn't yet realize that he is damn near perfect.  We have the standard misadventures until they realize they are Meant To Be Together.  So what's wrong?I wouldn't have believed it possible, but someone has actually made Diane Lane uninteresting.  You really don't care about her, and it's hard to tell if she cares about the men in her life because she really cares or because she thinks she should care.  She eventually meets two men who seem great and there are a few humorous incidents, including the ""search for condoms"", but mostly it just excruciatingly drags along.One problem they write themselves into is that the guy who is a ""rival"" to John Cusack (whose character also has no charisma) is such a great guy.  The only way the writers know how to handle this is to have him turn out to be an ass.  Problem is, this is totally out of character relative to how he's been in the entire rest of the movie.  Diane Lane then has no choice (after the standard epiphany of self awareness) but to fly to the man who basically is second choice.  In other words, ""We belong together because who I'd rather be with is a bum and I choose you by process of elimination"".The real flaw is here is that none of the characters have any depth or are particularly interesting.  ""Chick flicks"" can be well done and fun, just go back about 10 years and ask Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock.  They aren't though, when everyone walks through ""Chick Flick by the Numbers"", which is what we have here.

Well, it would have.  Unfortunately, this ain't it.  Few of the scenes work; most are horribly written and it's sad to see the on-screen talent struggle to make them work.  We kept rooting for the thing to get better, and that's what's so frustrating about a film like this; just when you think it's turned a corner, it stalls again.""Must Love Dogs"" is a cute enough title and the lead actors appealing enough, but it takes no time at all to encounter the first of a plethora of problems that run throughout this film.  The opening plot exposition and backstory, are the sloppiest I've seen since, perhaps, ""Dune.""  Also, after 10 minutes we know how our happy ending will take shape, but that's forgivable; it's not always the destination that's interesting, but sometimes the journey.  It's unforgivable when both journey and destination are miserably executed, as they are here.One of the other problems is that none of these people are interesting at all.  ""Must Love Dogs"" is basically a romance between animatrons, not people with any substance.  We learn in the opening scenes that the still-lovely Diane Lane plays a divorced teacher of toddlers who still can't bring herself to go on a date, and that the still-geeky Jon Cusack plays a sensitive, more recently divorced boatbuilder with a scuzzy lawyer buddy who thinks Cusack just needs to get laid.  By the end of the film we really know nothing more about either of these two, and the chemistry between them is spotty at best.  Worse, the lawyer buddy doesn't even have the redeeming quality of being likeable at all, or even funny.  He's just putrid.Fortunately Christopher Plummer is around to add some desperately-needed class, although the equally talented Stockard Channing is wasted in a role that seems cribbed from Marsha Mason's sometime character on TV's ""Frasier.""  She's wasted in the role because the director of this Dog won't let her play it as brassy as Mason did; if they'd been more honest and just blatantly copycatted, it would've added some pizzazz, but they don't even have enough guts for that much.We should have left early.  By the time Lane inexplicably finds herself aboard a canoe rowed by a team of college girls, apparently strangers to her, that came out of nowhere to help her chase down Cusack, we were no longer very disappointed.

945654,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000BNX3AU,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","One of the least appreciated films of 2005 is Must Love Dogs, an upbeat romantic comedy about two recent divorcees. Directed and adapted to screen by Gary David Goldberg, veteran TV writer for such shows as MASH and Family Ties, the film offers a number of laughs and very little in the way of strained or forced moments. As usual, John Cusack's character appears on the big screen as an amicable and enigmatic personality. Cusack and Diane Lane make for a good onscreen pairing, but the script is somewhat lacking in its ability to deliver. Much like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail, the concept and the couple are intriguing, but the unmet high expectations leave much to be desired...Must Love Dogs follows the life of Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane), a recently divorced preschool teacher attempting to move on with her life. Sarah's sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) is constantly nagging her to get out and meet Mr. Right, but her prodding does nothing to animate the borderline depressed Sarah. Nevertheless, Carol's well-intentioned act of signing her sister onto PerfectMatch.com provides a handful of prospective leads. One of them is a recently divorced woodworking artist named Jake (John Cusack), and the two agree to meet in the park with their dogs. The encounter is a forgettable one, but the two develop a mild attraction to one another.Meanwhile, Bob (Dermot Mulroney) the father of one of Sarah's students, develops his own attraction for Sarah, forming a love triangle that leaves Sarah in utter confusion. As Sarah's widowed father Bill (Christopher Plummer) plays the field with much greater success, it only seems to exacerbate Sarah's disillusioned outlook. But when one of her father's new female friends, the likeable and spunky Dolly (Stockard Channing) dispenses some of her own advice on life and relationships, it makes for a more interesting and humorous film. Caught in the lurch between two unknown outcomes, Sarah must choose the relationship that is right for her. But in the course of her hesitation, she risks losing the only relationship of the two which is truly worth her while.Fun and oftentimes witty, Must Love Dogs has some great scenes and original one-liners. Based on the bestselling novel by Claire Cook, Must Love Dogs will never be confused with a deeply symbolic or Oscar worthy picture, and the plot itself is quite predictable. But the film manages to do the most important job a film can do: entertain. Although it suffers at moments from use of bad dialogue, it's not a total throwaway film. Like another recent Diane Lane movie, Under The Tuscan Sun, the mandatory gay friend with attractive significant other is present for relationship advice. That's just one of a variety of overused Hollywood clich?s the viewer will encounter, along with the coincidence of Jake meeting Sarah's father and Sarah's end-of-the-movie race to embrace Jake, of which I must ask, why couldn't she just wait until he got ashore? Because it wouldn't make for a magical romantic movie ending, that's why. Otherwise, Must Love Dogs is a likeable picture with many funny moments most will enjoy...The DVD Report",3,A fun romantic comedy...,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,3146,"['One', 'least', 'appreciated', 'films', '2005', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'upbeat', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'recent', 'divorcees', 'Directed', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Gary', 'David', 'Goldberg', 'veteran', 'TV', 'writer', 'such', 'shows', 'MASH', 'Family', 'Ties', 'film', 'number', 'laughs', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'strained', 'forced', 'moments', 'usual', 'John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'big', 'screen', 'amicable', 'enigmatic', 'personality', 'Cusack', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'make', 'good', 'onscreen', 'pairing', 'script', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'ability', 'deliver', 'Much', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'concept', 'couple', 'are', 'intriguing', 'unmet', 'high', 'expectations', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'life', 'Sarah', 'Nolan', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'recently', 'divorced', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'attempting', 'move', 'life', 'Sarah', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'constantly', 'nagging', 'get', 'out', 'meet', 'Mr', 'Right', 'prodding', 'nothing', 'animate', 'borderline', 'depressed', 'Sarah', 'Nevertheless', 'Carol', 'well-intentioned', 'act', 'signing', 'sister', 'PerfectMatch.com', 'handful', 'prospective', 'leads', 'One', 'recently', 'divorced', 'woodworking', 'artist', 'named', 'Jake', 'John', 'Cusack', 'two', 'agree', 'meet', 'park', 'dogs', 'encounter', 'forgettable', 'one', 'two', 'develop', 'mild', 'attraction', 'one', 'another.Meanwhile', 'Bob', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'father', 'one', 'Sarah', 'students', 'own', 'attraction', 'Sarah', 'forming', 'love', 'triangle', 'Sarah', 'utter', 'confusion', 'Sarah', 'widowed', 'father', 'Bill', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'field', 'much', 'greater', 'success', 'only', 'exacerbate', 'Sarah', 'disillusioned', 'outlook', 'when', 'one', 'father', 'new', 'female', 'friends', 'likeable', 'spunky', 'Dolly', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'own', 'advice', 'life', 'relationships', 'more', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'film', 'Caught', 'lurch', 'two', 'unknown', 'outcomes', 'Sarah', 'must', 'choose', 'relationship', 'right', 'course', 'hesitation', 'losing', 'only', 'relationship', 'two', 'truly', 'worth', 'while.Fun', 'oftentimes', 'witty', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'great', 'scenes', 'original', 'one-liners', 'Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Claire', 'Cook', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'confused', 'deeply', 'symbolic', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'picture', 'plot', 'quite', 'predictable', 'film', 'manages', 'do', 'most', 'important', 'job', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'entertain', 'moments', 'use', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'not', 'total', 'throwaway', 'film', 'recent', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'movie', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'mandatory', 'gay', 'friend', 'attractive', 'significant', 'other', 'present', 'relationship', 'advice', 'just', 'one', 'variety', 'overused', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 's', 'viewer', 'will', 'encounter', 'coincidence', 'Jake', 'meeting', 'Sarah', 'father', 'Sarah', 'end-of-the-movie', 'race', 'embrace', 'Jake', 'must', 'ask', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'wait', 'got', 'ashore', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'magical', 'romantic', 'movie', 'ending', 'why', 'Otherwise', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'likeable', 'picture', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'most', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I love his self-deprecating, boy-next-door charm and we got that one in this film as well.  However, Must Love Dogs is a dud in more ways than one.  Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane) is a divorcee in her late thirties.  Her meddling family members feel she should start dating again.  After all, she's been divorced for eight months!  So, her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins) places an ad at an online dating agency to force her sister to get back in the game.  The dates are disasters, especially one in particular -- a cute, sweet, but awkward and intense boat designer (Cusack) who is immediately smitten by Sarah, though the feeling is not mutual, for she's got her eye set on the father of one of her preschool students (Dermot Mulroney).  Which one is the right one for her?There are various things wrong with this movie. For one, it's boring.  It's also filled with cliches and full of the most embarrassing dialogue that great actors like Cusack and Lane should not be subjected to.  It is also not very believable.  Sarah must have had one heck of a brilliant divorce attorney.  That's the only way that could explain her owning such a big, beautiful house with a preschool teacher's salary.  Same goes for Cusack's character.  He makes boats that don't sell, yet he owns a chic loft.  And then there is the biggest flaw of all: no chemistry between the protagonists.  I don't know why Cusack's character (whose name escapes me) is so smitten by a woman who seems repelled by him for 95% of the movie.  There was absolutely no spark between them.  I don't know, perhaps I'm missing something here.  There are a few amusing moments though.  Elizabeth Perkins's character was wonderfully witty and she's about the only person with a decent role here.  That's about it.  I give Must Love Dogs two stars  because I managed to finish it up and because it features some rather cute dogs, but I could get cute dogs AND a nice story by watching Homeward Bound.",2,Must Love Duds,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2054,"['love', 'chick', 'flicks', ""'m"", 'not', 'afraid', 'admit', 'Also', 'love', 'chick', 'flicks', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'love', 'self-deprecating', 'boy-next-door', 'charm', 'got', 'one', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'dud', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Sarah', 'Nolan', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'divorcee', 'late', 'thirties', 'meddling', 'family', 'members', 'feel', 'should', 'start', 'dating', 'again', 'been', 'divorced', 'eight', 'months', 'So', 'older', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'ad', 'online', 'dating', 'agency', 'force', 'sister', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'dates', 'are', 'disasters', 'especially', 'one', 'particular', 'cute', 'sweet', 'awkward', 'intense', 'boat', 'designer', 'Cusack', 'who', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'Sarah', 'feeling', 'not', 'mutual', 'got', 'eye', 'set', 'father', 'one', 'preschool', 'students', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Which', 'one', 'right', 'one', 'are', 'various', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'one', 'boring', 'also', 'filled', 'cliches', 'full', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'dialogue', 'great', 'actors', 'Cusack', 'Lane', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'subjected', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'Sarah', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'heck', 'brilliant', 'divorce', 'attorney', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'explain', 'owning', 'big', 'beautiful', 'house', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'salary', 'Same', 'Cusack', 'character', 'boats', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'yet', 'chic', 'loft', 'then', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'chemistry', 'protagonists', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Cusack', 'character', 'name', 'so', 'smitten', 'woman', 'who', 'repelled', '95', '%', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'spark', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'character', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'witty', 'only', 'person', 'decent', 'role', 'here', 'give', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'two', 'stars', 'managed', 'finish', 'up', 'rather', 'cute', 'dogs', 'could', 'get', 'cute', 'dogs', 'nice', 'story', 'watching', 'Homeward', 'Bound']",N/A

Levine,"[2, 4]","This movie had a fundamental problem; the recent phenomenon of internet dating services provides a great premise for spoofs but you would have to milk the subject matter to make a full legnth movie out of it. If you don't milk the spoof, then the movie becomes another of the many predictable romantic comedies. So it was here. As a divorcee who has used internet dating services, I howled at the satirical material. The collection of strange dates and exagerrated profiles posted on the dating sites were hilarious. Unfortunately, this was not a half hour situation comedy on television and the romatic comedy was utterly predictable. John Cusak was the somewhat oddball internet date and, predictably enough, Sarah (Diane Cusak's) character and he did not initially hit it off.Sarah is a preschool teacher and there is chemistry between her and the father of a student. There is a predictable triangle and the outcome is predictable (does anyone care to predict whether the guy from the dating service, who intially appears to be an oddball, or the father of the student ultimately ends up with Sarah?).

Although the film topically addresses the world of online matchmaking, it doesn't feel relevant given the tendency toward convention. It's not too surprising to find out that this is the product of TV sitcom director-writer Gary David Goldberg as it feels like there is an absent laugh track with pauses after certain line readings to make room for the gales of laughter that never really come. This is the type of movie that depends on a sing-along with ""The Partridge Family"" theme song for a nostalgic guffaw.The story centers on Sarah, an attractive, fortyish woman freshly divorced and prodded by her meddlesome family to start dating again. I think it could have helped if Lane, wallowing in self-doubt and analysis paralysis, did not play such a similar character in last year's ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". This time she's a pre-school teacher with - surprise! - a love for dogs. As is routine with this sort of set-up, Sarah is surrounded by stock characters - an acid-tongued, married older sister, Carol, who submits Sarah's online profile behind her back; a bromide-spouting father with a brogue that would make Barry Fitzgerald wince; a happily partnered colleague with a heart of gold; and Bob, a recently separated man who may or may not have the best intentions in pursuing Sarah. Complicating matters is Jake, an iconoclastic, ""Doctor Zhivago""-loving boat-builder who immediately falls for Sarah.Even though Lane is as lovely as usual (and constantly reminded of this by her family) and Cusack seems to default easily back to his Lloyd Dobler persona from ""Say Anything"", it's hard to see why Jake falls for Sarah given her continuing trepidation, but alas, that seems to be the only viable point of conflict in the plot since there is so little character development. A sturdy supporting cast is wasted - Elizabeth Perkins back to second-banana status as the sister; Christopher Plummer somewhere between twinkly philosopher and aging lothario as the father; Dermot Mulroney whose character Bob is made so inconsistent as to render his subplot confusing; Ben Shenkman irritating as Jake's sleazy lawyer best friend and Stockard Channing sorely misused as a trailer-park hippie woman infatuated with Sarah's father.Granted there are a few chuckles (for example, when they careen through town hunting for a condom), the movie feels disjointed with scenes that simply stop and start with little sense of plot development other than getting to its inevitable ending. Goldberg doesn't have the sensibilities of a Cameron Crowe to get away with such an eccentric cast of characters, and the plot just feels overloaded with clich&eacute;s. Even with Lane and Cusack, the film should sadly be passed over.",2,Online Matchmaking Novelty Fails to Ignite Feeble Romantic Comedy,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2890,"['shame', 'movie', 'starring', 'two', 'more', 'likable', 'screen', 'actors', 'today', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'John', 'Cusack', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'such', 'overly', 'deliberate', 'Hollywood', 'contrivance', 'film', 'topically', 'world', 'online', 'matchmaking', ""n't"", 'feel', 'relevant', 'given', 'tendency', 'convention', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'find', 'out', 'product', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'director-writer', 'Gary', 'David', 'Goldberg', 'absent', 'laugh', 'track', 'pauses', 'certain', 'line', 'readings', 'make', 'room', 'gales', 'laughter', 'never', 'really', 'come', 'type', 'movie', 'sing-along', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'theme', 'song', 'nostalgic', 'guffaw.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Sarah', 'attractive', 'fortyish', 'woman', 'freshly', 'divorced', 'prodded', 'meddlesome', 'family', 'start', 'dating', 'again', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'Lane', 'wallowing', 'self-doubt', 'analysis', 'paralysis', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'similar', 'character', 'last', 'year', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'time', 'pre-school', 'teacher', 'surprise', 'love', 'dogs', 'routine', 'sort', 'set-up', 'Sarah', 'surrounded', 'stock', 'characters', 'acid-tongued', 'married', 'older', 'sister', 'Carol', 'who', 'Sarah', 'online', 'profile', 'back', 'bromide-spouting', 'father', 'brogue', 'would', 'make', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'wince', 'happily', 'partnered', 'colleague', 'heart', 'gold', 'Bob', 'recently', 'separated', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'intentions', 'pursuing', 'Sarah', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'Jake', 'iconoclastic', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', '-loving', 'boat-builder', 'who', 'immediately', 'Sarah.Even', 'Lane', 'as', 'lovely', 'usual', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'family', 'Cusack', 'default', 'easily', 'back', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'persona', 'Say', 'Anything', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Jake', 'Sarah', 'given', 'continuing', 'trepidation', 'alas', 'be', 'only', 'viable', 'point', 'conflict', 'plot', 'so', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'sturdy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wasted', 'Elizabeth', 'back', 'second-banana', 'status', 'sister', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'somewhere', 'twinkly', 'philosopher', 'aging', 'lothario', 'father', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'character', 'Bob', 'made', 'so', 'inconsistent', 'render', 'subplot', 'confusing', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'irritating', 'Jake', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'best', 'friend', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'sorely', 'misused', 'trailer-park', 'hippie', 'woman', 'infatuated', 'Sarah', 'father.Granted', 'are', 'few', 'chuckles', 'example', 'when', 'careen', 'town', 'hunting', 'condom', 'movie', 'feels', 'disjointed', 'scenes', 'simply', 'stop', 'start', 'little', 'sense', 'plot', 'development', 'other', 'getting', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'Goldberg', ""n't"", 'have', 'sensibilities', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'get', 'away', 'such', 'eccentric', 'cast', 'characters', 'plot', 'just', 'feels', 'overloaded', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Even', 'Lane', 'Cusack', 'film', 'should', 'sadly', 'be', 'passed']",N/A

I had read the book, which was mediocre, but when I saw that the premise had been updated for Internet dating, the changes sounded promising.  While the Internet dating thing didn't really add to the story in the end, putting some focus on Cusack's character's side of the plot kind of did.Overall there was too much to the film that was too thinly sketched.  For example:  Cusack's character, Jake is a boat maker who crafts his boats like an artist for a market that no longer exists.  I am sure the filmmaker was trying to say something about appreciation for the quaint and old-fashioned, (his character also loves old movies) but the message didn't really come across with any meaning.  Throughout the whole film, much is made about how Jake has yet to sell a boat.  Okay, so where's his money come from then?A love triangle kind of develops between Lane, Mulrooney and Cusack, but the triangle is so obtuse that it just doesn't ring true. Arguments spring up simply to enable the plot, so that they make no sense to the viewer, and the female lead comes off like she's either crazy or suffering from PMS.To be fair, Lane and Cusack try hard to work with the material they're given, but that's tough when none of it seems based in reality. The romance hardly works, and as for the comedy, there were more smirks than laughs here.  The plot is narrow, and none of the supporting characters have any kind of personality or story to them.  The writers should have boiled the main character's siblings down to just one, or perhaps one of each because there were too many to keep track of, and not enough jobs for them to do.As for the dogs, two come in and out of the picture for no reason, (or perhaps just to add a little ""cute"") and at no particular interval whatsoever, much like  Christopher Plummer's laughable (not to mention - completely cliche-riddled) Irish brogue.Pick this one up with a pooper scooper.",1,Woof!,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1969,"['example', 'script', 'really', 'went', 'dogs', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'mediocre', 'when', 'saw', 'premise', 'had', 'been', 'updated', 'Internet', 'dating', 'changes', 'sounded', 'promising', 'Internet', 'dating', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'story', 'end', 'putting', 'focus', 'Cusack', 'character', 'side', 'plot', 'kind', 'did.Overall', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'thinly', 'sketched', 'example', 'Cusack', 'character', 'Jake', 'boat', 'maker', 'who', 'boats', 'artist', 'market', 'longer', 'am', 'sure', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'appreciation', 'quaint', 'old-fashioned', 'character', 'also', 'old', 'movies', 'message', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'meaning', 'whole', 'film', 'much', 'made', 'how', 'Jake', 'yet', 'sell', 'boat', 'Okay', 'where', 'money', 'come', 'then', 'love', 'triangle', 'kind', 'develops', 'Lane', 'Mulrooney', 'Cusack', 'triangle', 'so', 'just', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'Arguments', 'spring', 'up', 'simply', 'enable', 'plot', 'make', 'sense', 'viewer', 'female', 'lead', 'crazy', 'suffering', 'PMS.To', 'be', 'fair', 'Lane', 'Cusack', 'try', 'hard', 'work', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', 'tough', 'when', 'none', 'based', 'reality', 'romance', 'hardly', 'comedy', 'were', 'more', 'smirks', 'laughs', 'here', 'plot', 'narrow', 'none', 'supporting', 'characters', 'have', 'kind', 'personality', 'story', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'boiled', 'main', 'character', 'siblings', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'perhaps', 'one', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'keep', 'track', 'not', 'enough', 'jobs', 'do.As', 'dogs', 'two', 'come', 'picture', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'just', 'add', 'little', 'cute', 'particular', 'interval', 'whatsoever', 'much', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'laughable', 'not', 'mention', 'completely', 'cliche-riddled', 'Irish', 'brogue.Pick', 'one', 'up', 'pooper', 'scooper']",N/A

Methinks that by definition that means that it's a silly, dopey fluff piece; not something deeply inspirational. Adjust your expectations accordingly. 2) Though not featured as prominently as one might have hoped, the dogs were great. 3) There was actually some considerable humor involved. No, not the 'condom' chase (which was pretty tacky), but several subtler moments of wit.Hmmm...I guess that's about it, though I still enjoy seeing Diane Lane all grown up.

Trouble is, this movie just doesn't seem to be the vehicle for them as a couple.I love watching Diane Lane on screen, and this movie was a visual feast for Diane Lane fans.  She's a fascinating beauty, and delightful in every way, yet in this movie I couldn't help noticing how contrived her scenes (or was it the director's touches?) seemed to be.  She seemed posed instead of natural in almost every scene.I've also enjoyed John Cusack's energy in every movie he's been in, and this was no exception.  In this movie, however, his scenes showing his angst about dating often seemed overplayed in relation to subsequent scenes that indicate he's suddenly transcended all his own internal questions, and then fallen into them again shortly thereafter.  Again, this confusion stems from a director's choices, not an actor's.The rest of the cast was fine, but used very conventionally.  I was even dismayed by Christopher Plummer's Irish accent, which seemed non-existent in his first scene but blossomed thereafter.  The only reason I felt compelled to think about it at all was that the dialogue reflected his Irishman status...Dermot Mulroney was such an obvious plot foil it was painful when he showed up.  Yes, the audience should often have an advantage over the characters in a story, but this was used again so conventionally that his role was more of a backhanded effort to add spice to a predictable plot, and, as such, failed.Disappointment in this film comes from a director who is TOO conventional with a conventional plot.

Usually it would be fifteen dollars for one film and the price will always increase. I also enjoy films with Diane Lane. In my DVD collection I have 'Under The Tuscan Sun' and 'Unfaithful'.I was also appealed by John Cusack. In this movie his favorite film was Dr. Zhivargo. In 'Serendipity' with Kate Beckinsale, he enjoyed 'Cool Hand Luke'. I was also pleased to see Dermot Muloney from 'The Wedding Date' in this film as I thought just recently that he looked a little like John Cusack, and purhaps should have been in Dermot's place in 'The Wedding Date'. Still no harm has been done and I am delighted that they are both in this film.From the looks of the title dog lovers should enjoy this film. Indeed there should be enough moments in this film with dogs to keep people happy. The only thing is, maybe the lure and love of two people no longer got the producers of this film excited, so opted for a different approach with the dog title. A new direction is always important with films. There is really nothing worse then being like all the other films around.There is a wonderfully attractive cast that purhaps isn't put to as good use as they could have been with a stronger story. There doesn't seem much of one, and what is there, they could have done a lot more with. From the looks of both actors sitting on a park bench beside a dog and surrounded by green trees and lush green grass, we could be in for some fun. And while the park bench is occupied by more people then lone Tom Hanks in 1994's 'Forrest Gump', this 'Must Love Dogs' film feels quite empty of the couple together and a lot of running around in circles by everyone. So maybe the couple in question should enrich their life experiences by not advertising themselves online, but take a chocolate from Forrest's chocolate box. If anything it might increase the viewers interest and pleasure in this film. Still I'm sure this film will be fondly remembered by some.While I enjoyed a scene where John Cusack and Diane Lane had to go to the chemist so John could replenish his condom suply, that was funny and indeed could happen. I remembered a movie called 'Trojan War' from 1997 with Jennifer Love Hewitt, in which the guy Will Friedle, who's after another girl's affection, that of Marley Sheldon, spends most of the film in search of a pack of condoms. So it has been done before but not often, so at least that's one thing it's got going for it. Still I'm glad this film is around. Just a bit of a let down in places I'm sorry to say. Still cute looking at dogs and stars.

945715,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000BNX3AU,L.A. Scene,"[2, 2]","There are a couple of reasons why the movie ""Must Love Dogs"" appealed to me.  The first reason is that I like movies that don't have the big ""megastar"" in it.  I like to give a movie a chance on its merit as opposed to its star power.  The second reason is - yes, I like Romantic Comedies.  This may seem odd coming from a thirtysomething male, but yes I happen to be a fan of the romantic comedy.  Therefore with two ingredients getting a thumbs-up in my book, I figured the movie ""Must Love Dogs"" was one worth checking.  Overall, I thought the movie was good - but unfortunately the movie does fall short in some areas and therefore cannot be considered one of the great romantic comedies of recent years.The focus of the movie revolves around a preschool teacher Sarah Nolan (played by Diane Lane).  Sarah has recently been divorced and is looking to get back into the dating game and find ""Mr. Right"".  At the same time, her sisters are also looking to help Sarah find the right guy.  Sarah's sister Carol (played by Elizabeth Perkins) puts her profile on an internet dating service.  After a series of failures, Sarah manages to meet up with a romantic boat builder named Jake Anderson (played by John Cusack).  Jake is in a similar situation to Sarah in that he is recently divorced and has his best friend Charlie prodding at him to get back in the dating game.  At the same time, Sarah meets Bob Connor (played by Delmot Mulroney) - the father of one of her students.  The dynamics between Sarah and these two men are really what will ignite the storyline.  Sarah definitely sees some ""potential"" with Jake, but also sees a connection with Bob.  Eventually things will come to a head between Sarah, Jake, and Bob - and as a result Sarah's life will be more complicated than ever.The strong point of this movie is the performance of Sarah by Diane Lane.  Lane is one of those actresses who has done a steady body of work for about 20 years, yet still seems to have superstardom allude her.  The character of Sarah was one that was both ""peppy"" and reserved.  Lane seemed to nail this character down and fit the character's role like a glove.  It is Lane that is going to provide some of the film's most humorous moments - particularly the parts when she is engaging in the internet dating service.  I've read a lot of reviews that said that it is going to be her character that is quickly going to be the film's main force.  I couldn't agree more with those reviews.  I'm not sure that even the ""big name"" romantic comedy actresses (like Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts, Renee Zellweger, and Sandra Bullock) could have pulled off this role as well as Lane.On the other hand, the leading actor of this film John Cusack does nothing for me.  I think blame could be shared between Cusack and the film's writers and producers.  Despite the fact that Cusack also has had a steady body of work, I can't say I have been very impressed with John Cusack's body of work.  On top of that, the role of Jake Anderson isn't very exciting or interesting.  While Cusack gets stuck with a lackluster character like Jake, Cusack does little to elevate the character of Jake.There are two other characters of note in this movie - one positive and one negative.  On the positive end, Christopher Plummer delivers a nice performance as Sarah's father Bill.  Bill is a widower who is also exploring the dating game.  He provides a gentle, but strong presence in the film.  Plummer reminds me a lot of a modern day Cesar Romero in his style to acting - and his performance in this film clearly solidifies this.  On the negative end, Stockard Channing plays Dolly - one of Bill's girlfriends.  Channing plays a 61 year old woman in this movie (which happened to be her age in the movie).  Unfortunately, I found the character of Dolly to be annoying.  While I'm not the biggest Channing fan, she is given a character that really isn't the ""scene stealer"" that this character had the potential to be.  Thus I must say the character of Dolly is negative.The opening credits feature some ""interviews"" that help set the stage for the theme of the movie (looking for love).  It is worth noting that one of the people interviewed is a character - Vinnie from Brooklyn.  This character is played by Steven R. Schirippa (a.k.a Bobby ""Bacala"" from ""The Sopranos"").  Schirippa is perfect for this role.  There is also a series of ""interviews"" in the closing credits that feature some of the cast members.  The style for all of these interviews was seen in ""When Harry Met Sally"".  They work as well in ""Must Love Dogs"" as they did in that movie.Romantic comedies are tough movies to pull off because usually there is a lot of predictability - especially in the endings.  The components of a good romantic comedy will interweave storylines and often have a subplot or two going on.  How good those interweaved storylines or subplots are will usually determine how good the romantic comedy is.  ""Must Have Dogs"" is predictable and has a predictable ending. While ""Must Have Dogs"" has Lane's presence and some funny moments, it lacks these components to help overcome the predictability.Overall, this movie can best be summed up as a good romantic comedy.  There have been better ones - there have been worse ones.  Still I think this one is worth checking out - if not for Diane Lane's performance alone.  While I gave this movie a chance on merit as opposed to star power, it did fall a bit short.  Therefore I'd moderately recommend this one.",3,In the scheme of Romantic Comedies - Good not Great,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,5508,"['are', 'couple', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'Must', 'Love',

945717,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BNX3AU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","""Must Love Dogs"" is not so much a bad romantic comedy as it is a disappointing one.  That is because it features a strong cast that has Diane Lane and John Cusack as the romantic leads, with Elizabeth Perkins, Christopher Plummer, Dermot Mulroney and Stockard Channing is the supporting roles.  I had a crush of Diane Lane when she was on the cover of ""TIME"" for being in ""A Little Romance"" and was grateful when she grew up so that such feelings were no longer inappropriate.  I have liked John Cusack since before ""Say Anything"" (starting with ""Eight Men Out"" in fact), and have admired his choices for roles (and siblings).  Put these two together in a romantic comedy and I might actually go to the theater to see it instead of waiting until it comes out on DVD.  But I did not and I have to say I am glad that was the case.Sarah (Lane) is a kindergarten teacher who is now divorced and her family refuses to let her wallow in despair.  So her sister Carol (Perkins) puts Sarah's profile on an Internet dating service, using her high school graduation picture and the word ""voluptuous.""  Meanwhile, Jake (John Cusack), who is also now divorced, finds that his friend has answered Sarah's add placed by Carol in his (Jake's) name.  So Sarah and Jack meet, each taking a dog that does not belong to them, and it does not go well.  This strikes us as being odd since they are obviously perfect for each other (their names appear before the titles, which is always a good clue).  But then when Sarah answers a personal add in the paper it turns out to be placed by her widowed father (Plummer), so odd is apparently her lot in life.  Besides, Sarah is interested in Bob (Mulroney), the father of one her students, even though obviously he is charm without substance.  Consequently, you have this 98-minute film, take off five minutes for the end credits and add another five to that total and figure out that at around the 88-minute mark Sarah will (a) figure out Jake is the guy for her and (b) do something about it.The 2005 film is based on Claire Cook's novel, but since Gary David Goldberg did the screenplay and directed the film the fault lies not with the stars but with the guy who created ""Family Ties"" and ""Spin City.""  For me the point where the film derails is when Sarah goes to the store to buy a chicken for dinner.  The butcher tries to push a complete fryer on her for an extra 75 cents, but she does not want it and finally explodes.  The guy is not hitting on her, just trying to help, so instead of the scene being comic because she has to confess to being divorced and not needing more it just makes her seem rude.  It sets up a running gag with a bit of a payoff at the end, but by then it is too little too late.You understand that the characters are behind the viewers in that we know these two will end up together and they do not.  There are obstacles thrown in their way, but they are so minor and transparent they should not matter.  Then we get to the point where Sarah realizes she really likes Jake and goes to tell him only to discover he is on a date.  This would be a bad sign.  But the date in question makes it painfully obvious that she is from Pluto while Jake is from Venus (I also love ""Doctor Zhivago"").  The girl should be the only one in the scene who does not know that Jake is going to unhook her and throw her back in the sea, but, no, Sarah cannot see the obvious either (Jake sure can).  The final nail in the coffin is when we get to the grand romantic gesture at the end that brings the couple together, because compared to standing there with a ghetto blaster playing ""In Your Eyes,"" what this film comes up with is all wet.",3,Stellar cast wasted in a romantic comedy that just does not click,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,3676,"['Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'disappointing', 'one', 'strong', 'cast', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'John', 'Cusack', 'romantic', 'leads', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'supporting', 'roles', 'had', 'crush', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'when', 'was', 'cover', 'TIME', 'being', 'A', 'Little', 'Romance', 'was', 'grateful', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'so', 'such', 'feelings', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'inappropriate', 'have', 'liked', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Say', 'Anything', 'starting', 'Eight', 'Men', 'Out', 'fact', 'have', 'admired', 'choices', 'roles', 'siblings', 'Put', 'two', 'together', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'might', 'actually', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'instead', 'waiting', 'out', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'case.Sarah', 'Lane', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'who', 'now', 'divorced', 'family', 'let', 'wallow', 'despair', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Perkins', 'Sarah', 'profile', 'Internet', 'dating', 'service', 'using', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'picture', 'word', 'voluptuous', 'Meanwhile', 'Jake', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'also', 'now', 'divorced', 'friend', 'answered', 'Sarah', 'add', 'placed', 'Carol', 'Jake', 'name', 'Sarah', 'Jack', 'meet', 'taking', 'dog', 'not', 'belong', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'being', 'odd', 'are', 'obviously', 'perfect', 'other', 'names', 'appear', 'titles', 'always', 'good', 'clue', 'then', 'when', 'Sarah', 'personal', 'add', 'paper', 'out', 'be', 'placed', 'widowed', 'father', 'Plummer', 'so', 'odd', 'apparently', 'lot', 'life', 'Besides', 'Sarah', 'interested', 'Bob', 'Mulroney', 'father', 'one', 'students', 'even', 'obviously', 'charm', 'substance', 'Consequently', 'have', '98-minute', 'film', 'take', 'off', 'five', 'minutes', 'end', 'credits', 'add', 'five', 'total', 'figure', 'out', '88-minute', 'mark', 'Sarah', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'Jake', 'guy', 'b', 'do', 'something', 'it.The', '2005', 'film', 'based', 'Claire', 'Cook', 'novel', 'Gary', 'David', 'Goldberg', 'did', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'film', 'fault', 'not', 'stars', 'guy', 'who', 'created', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Spin', 'City', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'derails', 'when', 'Sarah', 'store', 'buy', 'chicken', 'dinner', 'butcher', 'push', 'complete', 'fryer', 'extra', '75', 'cents', 'not', 'want', 'finally', 'explodes', 'guy', 'not', 'hitting', 'just', 'trying', 'help', 'instead', 'scene', 'being', 'comic', 'confess', 'being', 'divorced', 'not', 'needing', 'more', 'just', 'seem', 'rude', 'up', 'running', 'gag', 'bit', 'payoff', 'end', 'then', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.You', 'understand', 'characters', 'are', 'viewers', 'know', 'two', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'do', 'not', 'are', 'obstacles', 'thrown', 'way', 'are', 'so', 'minor', 'transparent', 'should', 'not', 'matter', 'Then', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'Sarah', 'really', 'likes', 'Jake', 'tell', 'only', 'discover', 'date', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'sign', 'date', 'question', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Pluto', 'Jake', 'Venus', 'also', 'love', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'girl', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'Jake', 'going', 'unhook', 'throw', 'back', 'sea', 'Sarah', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'obvious', 'Jake', 'sure', 'can', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'when', 'get', 'grand', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'end', 'couple', 'together', 'compared', 'standing', 'there', 'ghetto', 'blaster', 'playing', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'what', 'film', 'up', 'wet']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised because, though this romantic comedy is nothing earth shatteringly new, it worked for me!  Cute, sparkling dialogue, and a fantastic cast in Cusack, Diane Lane, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing, Elizabeth Perkins, and Dermot Mulroney.  These are the things that make an otherwise rather conventional formula script come to life in its own way.Without going into the plot like so many others have, I will state what I think makes the movie work.  Diane Lane is a woman other women my age (none of your friggin' business!) can relate to, and the bad dates, familial meddling, and other embarrassing situations definitely hit home.  John Cusack--yes, I admit I'm a fan--is believable as a romantic lead because he isn't great looking, which makes him the ""normal guy"" believable that women end up chosing more times than not over a Brad Pitt type.  Add to the fact that his character has the obscure interest in boat making and is romantically sensitive, and you know the girls are going to love this dating movie.The supporting cast is as strong as the leads, and I found myself simultaneously laughing or being moved quite often.  Most pleasing to me was that the family dog, Mother Teresa, was a Newfoundland, because they are so very rarely used in movies, and I happen to have a dog that is part Newfie and lab.  They tend to be loyal, lovable animals just like that one, and are the greatest companions.

945732,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B000BNX3AU,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[6, 10]","""Must Love Dogs"" is like the Taco Bell Chihuahua: it's cute at first, but very quickly becomes tiresome. ""Dogs"" is a sloppy assemblage of all of romantic comedy's most common and most boring aspects: the large, supportive (preferably Irish Catholic) family; the unsure, slightly neurotic but beautiful divorc&eacute;e; the sensitive, emotional man who is good with his hands but not his feelings; the pert, too-perky dialogue; and yes, even the dreaded family singalong. (There are poetry recitations too, in case you wondered.)A movie like this is almost entirely dependent on how much we like and are engaged by its leads. Unfortunately there isn't much to like about them here; the characters of Jake and Sarah (played by John Cusack and Diane Lane) are such one-dimensional stereotypes that there is little the actors can do to make them engaging. The dialogue feels rehearsed and overdelivered. Jake is so alarmingly upfront and intense in his first date with Sarah that it's impossible to really believe a stressed-out neurotic like her would actually agree to a second date, let alone go home with him. And as for the ""dogs"" of the title, they feel as contrived and extraneous as anything else; they don't contribute to the plot, they just provide a catchy title.The plot feels contrived and forced, even for a romantic comedy; the only reason that Sarah and Jake don't immediately get together seems to be that there wouldn't be a movie if they did. There is a series of actions they have to perform first, and they go through all the motions like clockwork: they doubt their own feelings. They doubt each other's feelings. Sarah misplaces her affection and gets burned. There is even a  final climax involving...you guessed it, boats. The usual miscommunications, crossed wires, and mishaps occur, but they don't seem to have any real purpose except to flesh out the movie's running time before the inevitable ending. There isn't much focus on character development: we're shown that Sarah likes kids and teaches kindergarten (which means she must be a decent, lovable woman without faults) and that Jake builds boats by hand and cries when he watches Doctor Zhivago (which means he must be a sensitive, tender-hearted man).And then there is Sarah's family. It is rare even in romantic comedies to have a family simultaneously this obnoxiously annoying and completely unbelievable. Sarah's sister Carol is the typical meddlesome older sister bent on playing matchmaker; she is officious and callous, but only with the best of intentions, so Sarah forgives her. Christopher Plummer as Sarah's father Bill is an aging lothario; Plummer plays it well, but is it very believable for Bill, supposedly married to the ""love of his life"" for 45 years before losing her, to immediately become an inconsiderate philanderer who strings several women along at once? I think not. This is the kind of family who invites a practical stranger over for dinner and then has a goofy family singalong in front of him. And they're not even drunk when they do this. And then there are the requisite Gay Buddies, who are so stereotypically ""Hollywood Gay"" that it's painful and offensive to watch.There are only two characters in the whole mess who are believable at all: Dermot Mulroney's Bob, a seemingly wonderful guy who smoothly conceals a sleazier side and wins Sarah's heart before breaking it, and Stockard Channing's Dolly, a 50ish hippie with a kind heart, though she is treated badly, and more wisdom than everyone else in this movie combined. Sad, that the only thing this romantic comedy convincingly portrays is the existence of cads and heartbreak.",1,Must Love Dogs?

It's basically a less substantial version of Dianne Lane's earlier ""Under the Tuscan Sun"".  Just subtract the fantastic scenery and add a more traditional ending.Lane (just as gorgeous as ever) is a newly divorced teacher being pushed, pulled and prodded back into the dating world by various family members.  Sadly, one possible suitor offered up by an elderly aunt is a first cousin (but he was adopted!).  At the behest of her sister, she answers an online singles ad and arrives at a restaurant only to learn that the ad was placed by... her father!  Of course that doesn't stop sis from ghost-writing an ad for her.Lane rebounds from her self-characterized ""disturbing on so many levels"" blind date with her dad to browse through the various prospects and suspects, meeting with decidedly mixed results.  The one prospect among the respondents is John Cusack, at his rumpled and affable best.  Cusack manages to be that rare personality that women fall for, without being threatening to the men.  He wins the girl without having to flash washboard abs or artificially white teeth.Watching Lane and Cusack work is fun enough, but they get a strong assist from a supporting cast that features Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing.  Plummer is Lane's father, a poetry-quoting widower determined to enjoy life despite losing his beloved wife of over forty years.  Somehow though, I wish that his character might have lapsed into a brief performance of ""Edelweiss"" instead of reciting another poem by Yeats.  Wouldn't that have been a nice little homage?  Channing plays one of Dad's many girlfriends, with all of her usual (and substantial appeal).It's a light and very appealing comedy.",3,"Fun, witty romance!",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,1782,"['Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'appealing', 'characters', 'basically', 'less', 'substantial', 'version', 'Dianne', 'Lane', 'earlier', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Just', 'subtract', 'fantastic', 'scenery', 'add', 'more', 'traditional', 'ending.Lane', 'just', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'ever', 'newly', 'divorced', 'teacher', 'being', 'pushed', 'pulled', 'prodded', 'back', 'dating', 'world', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'Sadly', 'one', 'possible', 'suitor', 'offered', 'up', 'elderly', 'aunt', 'first', 'cousin', 'was', 'adopted', 'behest', 'sister', 'online', 'singles', 'ad', 'restaurant', 'only', 'learn', 'ad', 'was', 'placed', 'father', 'course', ""n't"", 'stop', 'sis', 'ghost-writing', 'ad', 'her.Lane', 'rebounds', 'self-characterized', 'disturbing', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'blind', 'date', 'dad', 'browse', 'various', 'prospects', 'suspects', 'meeting', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'results', 'one', 'prospect', 'respondents', 'John', 'Cusack', 'rumpled', 'affable', 'best', 'Cusack', 'be', 'rare', 'personality', 'women', 'fall', 'being', 'threatening', 'men', 'girl', 'having', 'flash', 'washboard', 'abs', 'artificially', 'white', 'teeth.Watching', 'Lane', 'Cusack', 'work', 'fun', 'enough', 'get', 'strong', 'assist', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Plummer', 'Lane', 'father', 'poetry-quoting', 'widower', 'determined', 'enjoy', 'life', 'losing', 'beloved', 'wife', 'forty', 'years', 'Somehow', 'wish', 'character', 'might', 'have', 'lapsed', 'brief', 'performance', 'Edelweiss', 'instead', 'reciting', 'poem', 'Yeats', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'little', 'homage', 'Channing', 'one', 'Dad', 'many', 'girlfriends', 'usual', 'substantial', 'appeal', '.It', 'light', 'very', 'appealing', 'comedy']",N/A

I HIGHLY recommend this movie for women between ages 25-50. It contains several references to women that age, including a David Cassidy joke.I, a 16 year old guy, was bored to death. I found no interesting story that could stand out from the millions of other chick-flick romantic comedies out there.I do like John Cusack, but in this one he seemed kind of dull and boring and just not a very amusing character. I like him in roles that are a little more outgoing, like America's Sweethearts and Serendipity. In this movie, he seemed king of ""mopey"" and infected me with it too.Diane Lane is quite a talented woman, but in this one she showed no real spark. She just played the divorced, middle-aged woman who just whines about wanting true love and how uninteresting she is.

945746,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000BNX3AU,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 1]","I'm a huge John Cusack fan. I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD and it took me a while of going back and forth for a few years to finish it. I didn't care for it too much at the beginning but recently I watched it again and it's an okay film.This is a romantic comedy (no surprise). The premise is nothing original or even that entertaining. This is like the basic setup for romantic comedies. Two lonely over-the-hill people are afraid to get back into the dating scene. She is an uptight, repressed woman who has sworn off men. He is a damaged, pathetic soul who is convinced romance is dead. Their friends and loved ones put ads on the Internet and WA LA! You have a movie.We all know how it's gonna turn out. Sarah (Lane) and Jake (Cusack) get together, fall for each other but then other obstacles get in the way. Of course Sarah finds herself attracted to a school teacher (Dermot Mulroney) but doesn't let Jake know this until he catches them kissing in a very badly put together scene. No surprise here in fact, nothing in this movie was a surprise.The supporting characters saved this film for the little it was worth. Elizabeth Perkins was a hoot as Diane Lane's sister. Stockard Channing's performance was excellent as Lane's soon-to-be stepmother. She really kept the fire going for some otherwise boring scenes. Sarah was an okay character and more enjoyable than Jake. I found Jake very annoying. His actions did not fit the character at all. Jake has been turned off of dating to the point where he didn't want to try again, yet he meets Sarah and he falls so hard for her he thinks she's the one? Why? Because she turned him down at the dog park? It was silly and unrealistic how Jake got so attached to Sarah so quickly. On the flip side, Sarah acted like she didn't care for Jake much at all and it wasn't believable that she would even go out with him seeing how he offended her the first time they met.Some of the scenes between Lane and Cusack were cute but they had no chemistry. I hate to be vicious but Lane looked like Cusack's mother. She is a lovely lady and I appreciate she's aging gracefully but she looked way older than Cusack even though it's obvious Cusack's had some botox treatment which would explain the puffy eyes. That's another thing that irked me. I couldn't stop staring at how weird and bloated Cusack's face was. It was also hard to watch how Jake gushed over Sarah like some schoolboy with a crush. You just didn't feel it to be genuine. Lane has more chemistry with Mulroney who would have better been suited as Jake in my opinion.This movie is not terrible but it's not great either. I'd skip the scenes with the main characters and stick to the scenes with the supporting characters. What's so bad is that Jake is not even shown half as much as some of the other characters. This film was supposed to be about Jake and Sarah yet it gets lost on all these other subplots. There was too much going on at one time. The tragedy was that the dad's love life was more interesting than watching Sarah and Jake.Maybe if Sarah had showed more emotion toward Jake you could take the romance seriously. But you never feel like she really cares but instead is just going with the man she thinks is the best of the pack. She's gone out with so many dogs, Jake seems to just be the one she sticks with. I didn't buy that she actually cared for him.You ""must love dogs"" if you loved this film. This is something that should've been made on DVD and never released on a wide scale. I feel like with a little more work this would have been a romantic comedy worthy of the Julia Roberts' fans stamp of approval but this just fell short in every way.I gave three stars for Stockard Channing and believe me, I'm being incredibly generous. It won't hurt to watch it but there are at least 50 more romantic comedies ten times better than this.",3,Just A Movie,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,3883,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'John', 'Cusack', 'fan', 'bought', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'took', 'while', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'few', 'years', 'finish', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'beginning', 'recently', 'watched', 'again', 'okay', 'film.This', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'surprise', 'premise', 'nothing', 'original', 'even', 'entertaining', 'basic', 'setup', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Two', 'lonely', 'over-the-hill', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'get', 'back', 'dating', 'scene', 'uptight', 'repressed', 'woman', 'who', 'sworn', 'off', 'men', 'damaged', 'pathetic', 'soul', 'who', 'convinced', 'romance', 'dead', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'put', 'ads', 'Internet', 'WA', 'LA', 'have', 'movie.We', 'know', 'how', 'gon', 'turn', 'out', 'Sarah', 'Lane', 'Jake', 'Cusack', 'get', 'together', 'fall', 'other', 'then', 'other', 'obstacles', 'get', 'way', 'course', 'Sarah', 'attracted', 'school', 'teacher', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', ""n't"", 'let', 'Jake', 'know', 'kissing', 'very', 'badly', 'put', 'together', 'scene', 'surprise', 'here', 'fact', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'saved', 'film', 'little', 'was', 'worth', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'was', 'hoot', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'sister', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'performance', 'was', 'excellent', 'Lane', 'soon-to-be', 'stepmother', 'really', 'kept', 'fire', 'going', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'scenes', 'Sarah', 'was', 'okay', 'character', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Jake', 'found', 'Jake', 'very', 'annoying', 'actions', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'character', 'Jake', 'been', 'turned', 'dating', 'point', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'try', 'again', 'yet', 'Sarah', 'so', 'hard', 'one', 'Why', 'turned', 'down', 'dog', 'park', 'was', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'how', 'Jake', 'got', 'so', 'attached', 'Sarah', 'so', 'quickly', 'flip', 'side', 'Sarah', 'acted', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Jake', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'out', 'seeing', 'how', 'offended', 'first', 'time', 'met.Some', 'scenes', 'Lane', 'Cusack', 'were', 'cute', 'had', 'chemistry', 'hate', 'be', 'vicious', 'Lane', 'looked', 'Cusack', 'mother', 'lovely', 'lady', 'appreciate', 'aging', 'gracefully', 'looked', 'way', 'older', 'Cusack', 'even', 'obvious', 'Cusack', 'had', 'botox', 'treatment', 'would', 'explain', 'puffy', 'eyes', 'thing', 'irked', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'staring', 'how', 'weird', 'bloated', 'Cusack', 'face', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'hard', 'watch', 'how', 'Jake', 'gushed', 'Sarah', 'schoolboy', 'crush', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'be', 'genuine', 'Lane', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Mulroney', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'been', 'suited', 'Jake', 'opinion.This', 'movie', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'great', ""'d"", 'skip', 'scenes', 'main', 'characters', 'stick', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'characters', 'What', 'so', 'bad', 'Jake', 'not', 'even', 'shown', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Jake', 'Sarah', 'yet', 'lost', 'other', 'subplots', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'one', 'time', 'tragedy', 'was', 'dad', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'watching', 'Sarah', 'Jake.Maybe', 'Sarah', 'had', 'showed', 'more', 'emotion', 'Jake', 'could', 'take', 'romance', 'seriously', 'never', 'feel', 'really', 'instead', 'just', 'going', 'man', 'best', 'pack', 'gone', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'dogs', 'Jake', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'actually', 'cared', 'him.You', 'must', 'love', 'dogs', 'loved', 'film', 'something', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'DVD', 'never', 'released', 'wide', 'scale', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'worthy', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'fans', 'stamp', 'approval', 'just', 'fell', 'short', 'way.I', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'believe', ""'m"", 'being', 'incredibly', 'generous', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'watch', 'are', 'least', '50', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ten', 'times', 'better']",N/A

Yes, the story is cliche.  Diane's character is a young, smart and attractive divorcee and a teacher in a preschool.  She happens to be from a tight and loving family that finds all ways to get her to be fallen in love again.  As quoted in the movie, her sister remarked that it's been 9 months!  Is that really a long time to grieve over a marriage that doesn't work out?  Anyway, as story would have it, the sister, played by Elizabeth Perkins from ""Big"", enlists her in an Internet dating website and Diane's character meets a few oddballs which draws a few laughs.  However, the crucial ""mis-dates"" would be between her and John Cusack's character who himself is coming to term with his own break-up by watching Dr Zhivago reruns over and over again.

Diane Lane and John Cusack do credible performances as recent divorcees whose meddling families and friends are always trying to set them up.  After the usual fumbling and bumbling and misconstrued circumstances, of course they hook up.  On the way, they have some interesting dates (that clever screenplay including Lane answering an ad from her own father and Dr. Zhivago-adoring Cusack going out with a cinema-hating bubblehead).Ah, the dogs.  Lane ends up with her brother's adorable Newfie Dog, a loving gentle giant named ""Mother Theresa.""  Both ladies have some fear issues to deal with.The best part of the film is the supporting cast.  Christopher Plummer is pure genius as Lane's widower Irish father with more dates than her.

She's given the task of trying to throw off ""witty"" lines in the style of 1930's films and yet she's supposed to be the quiet,sincere pre-school teacher.  It doesn't work.  She's totally gorgeous and yet is supposed to be really insecure about trying to date again.  Nothing makes sense but who cares...this is Hollywood at work.We're supposed to wonder if she's going to fall for the sexy guy who talks out of the corner of his mouth, but we know, from looking at the DVD cover she's going to end up with John Cuzack...duhBut, as others have written, if you don't expect art, and have two hours of your life to kill, then this might fit the bill.

945765,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000BNX3AU,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","I'm sad to say that this movie doesn't live up to even modest expectations.  Diane Lane and John Cusack are SUCH appealing performers, and the idea of the two of them paired in a romantic comedy was enough to make my wife and I eager to see the film on opening weekend.  We didn't expect Best Picture-like entertainment, but we did expect to laugh and enjoy ourselves.The movie does have some laughs, no question.  But it has long stretches that simply are unbelievable enough that you are unable to suspend disbelief enough.  Many, many movies have similar plot holes:  for example, Lane's character lives in a beautiful, bungalow style home with exquisite furnishings.  She works for a day care.  Well, perhaps her ex-husband was rich?  Nope...a fireman.  Yet they could afford this sweet home.  John Cusack builds, by hand, row boats from wood.  Actually, I should say ""boat"" in the singular.  At the beginning of the movie, he's built one.  At the end of the movie, he's still looking to sell that FIRST boat.  Yet he lives in a large place with a large workshop...and pays alimony!  RIGHT!!!  I know a lot of romantic comedies expect us to believe ridiculous things...like Will Smith's character in HITCH could exist in real life, for example.  Yet we happily suspend our doubts because the characters are so appealing.In MUST LOVE DOGS, our central characters are wrecks.  And in John Cusack's case, not very likeable ones.  He never smiles and he seems to have almost no internal censor on his speech...he just rattles on annoyingly.  I have always LOVED John Cusack...he's always a delight...HIGH FIDELITY, SAY ANYTHING, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY...heck, even BETTER OFF DEAD.  But he actually wears out his welcome in this film.  Dermot Mulroney plays a ""we're trying it apart"" separated dad who puts the moves on Lane...and we can see almost right away that he's shallow and disingenuous.  He's looking forward to trying the life of the bachelor again.  Yet Lane develops an interest in him, and pursues him even when she believes he can't be trusted.Lane is pretty good in the film, but her character is a bit ill-defined.  She feels like a retread of her UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN character, before finding the healing Italian climate.  Her ""laugh"" lines often feel delivered like a piece of standup...not as actual human thoughts.  She's a highly appealing actress, and her innate appeal keeps the movie afloat.  Not much else does.Christopher Plummer, as her father, is charismatic and totally unbelievable.  A father like he is would never have children like he does.  Elizabeth Perkins, as Lane's meddling sister, is totally unappealing and unlikable.  If she were MY sister, I'd smack her.  And Perkins is usually so tart and funny...here's she's just irritating.  The wonderful Stockard Channing simply looks WEIRD...what did they do to her??  I thought she was a man in drag!Speaking of drag...why do all single women who feel doomed to a life alone have a wonderful gay couple as their best, most understanding friends?  It's become a chiche now in these films that the leading lady confides primarily with a male gay friend.  And the friend is always the most warm, understanding, caring person in the film.  It's beginning to stretch credulity.We did have some good laughs in the scenes were Lane and Cusack are trying to find an open store where they can buy a condom.

945766,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BNX3AU,Robert Moore,"[3, 5]","So many movies seem to fall on the fence between ""see it in the theater"" and ""wait for DVD.""  This is one of those, and normally I would just recommend anyone interested to wait for it on DVD or cable, but this has been one of the worst movie summers in memory, so my recommendation is a bit different.  If, like me, you've been upset by the incredible lack of decent films to see this summer, you might want to give this one a look.  It isn't great, but neither is it unwatchable.  All in all, it is a pleasant enough way to waste ninety minutes.Though the ads present this as a Diane Lane-John Cusack vehicle, this is very much a Diane Lane film.  The film is largely told from her point of view, the narrative is situated in her world, and she gets most of the screen time.  There is no problem with this if you like Diane Lane, but those who are excited about a new John Cusack film should moderate their expectations.  Both are good in their roles, though together they generate a lot less chemistry than I would have liked, largely because of many awkward turns in the script.  Indeed, much of the film is hurt by poor execution on the production side.  While there are many funny moments, and several satisfyingly reflective ones, as a rule the movie is a tad on the flat side.  Scenes drag on too long or are curtailed too quickly, something that in the end is the result of either poor direction or poor editing (poor writing can be dealt with by a director).  There are several poorly written scenes.  So, many good moments are offset by many weak moments.  This all undermines efforts of a strong overall cast.  In addition to Lane and Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Elizabeth Perkins, and Stockard Channing were all excellent in their roles.This should have been a better movie than it turned out being.  There is a great cast, and the topic of the difficulty of over-40 dating is one that is increasingly relevant as the Baby Boomers all age.  There is a bit of disingenuousness in the central conceit.  Diane Lane is presented as dating a somewhat younger man, but the fact is that John Cusack is only a year younger than she is.  A great deal could have been done with the lying and deception that takes place as people present themselves over the Internet.  Still, despite the shortcomings of the film, it is one of the more palatable options we have seen recently in theaters.

945767,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000BNX3AU,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[3, 5]","I had a conversation with a friend who was busy panning ""Must Love Dogs,"" the recent Diane Lane/John Cusack movie that is now making the rounds in the video stores.  In support of his argument, my friend pointed to the many reviews that panned the movie on sites such as Amazon.com and Rotten Tomatoes.  ""It's not only `just' a chick flick,"" my friend said, echoing many reviewers' complaints, ""but it's a BAD chick flick.""  Having seen the movie, however, I must object to this assessment.  My take on this film is that it is like going to Denny's for a burger: maybe it's not up to the standards of a pricy steak house, but that doesn't mean it is a bad meal.This film is standard issue almost every step of the way; there are NO surprises: boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl back again.  It isn't Hamlet; it is basic romantic comedy all the wayBut, one thing this film DOES have (in addition to a FANTASTIC soundtrack!) is a cast that handles every line, every quirk, every inside joke and every moment with style, grace and a warm believability.  Diane Lane has never been sexier, more appealing, or more likely to have every male in the audience wishing he could meet her in person for even just five minutes.  Cusack does not hit a single false note; and their chemistry together is palpable.  Stockard Channing and Elizabeth Perkins turn in familiar, well received performances...and Christopher Plummer simply shines.  The screenplay, too, should be credited for providing small one-liners that help carry the movie easily from one plot point to the next.Maybe the best part of the entire exercise, however, was that it featured a cast of ADULTS, who more than ably gave lie to the popular Hollywood concept (Are you listening WB?) that the ups and downs of romance are only for teens and twenty-somethings; indeed the only two twenty-somethings in the film come off quite badly as shallow, brainless, and not worth the time of either rest of the case or the audience.  More to the point, perhaps, was the underlying message that maybe it really DOES take some maturity and wrinkles before we truly understand -and deserve- real love.This film was, right down to the closing a pleasant experience, and watching the credits roll was much like paying the bill after a meal at the local hamburger palace: it certainly wasn't sirloin, but it wasn't bad either.",5,"It might not be sirloin, but..........",1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2375,"['had', 'conversation', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'busy', 'panning', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'recent', 'Diane', 'Lane/John', 'Cusack', 'movie', 'now', 'making', 'rounds', 'video', 'stores', 'support', 'argument', 'friend', 'pointed', 'many', 'reviews', 'panned', 'movie', 'sites', 'such', 'Amazon.com', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'chick', 'flick', 'friend', 'said', 'echoing', 'many', 'reviewers', 'complaints', 'BAD', 'chick', 'flick', 'Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'however', 'must', 'object', 'assessment', 'take', 'film', 'going', 'Denny', 'burger', 'maybe', 'not', 'up', 'standards', 'pricy', 'steak', 'house', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'meal.This', 'film', 'standard', 'issue', 'almost', 'step', 'way', 'are', 'surprises', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'back', 'again', ""n't"", 'Hamlet', 'basic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wayBut', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'DOES', 'have', 'addition', 'FANTASTIC', 'soundtrack', 'cast', 'line', 'quirk', 'joke', 'moment', 'style', 'grace', 'warm', 'believability', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'never', 'been', 'sexier', 'more', 'appealing', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'male', 'audience', 'wishing', 'could', 'meet', 'person', 'even', 'just', 'five', 'minutes', 'Cusack', 'not', 'hit', 'single', 'false', 'note', 'chemistry', 'together', 'palpable', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'turn', 'familiar', 'well', 'received', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'simply', 'screenplay', 'too', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'providing', 'small', 'one-liners', 'help', 'carry', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'plot', 'point', 'next.Maybe', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'exercise', 'however', 'was', 'featured', 'cast', 'ADULTS', 'who', 'more', 'ably', 'gave', 'lie', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'concept', 'Are', 'listening', 'WB', 'ups', 'downs', 'romance', 'are', 'only', 'teens', 'twenty-somethings', 'indeed', 'only', 'two', 'twenty-somethings', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'quite', 'badly', 'shallow', 'brainless', 'not', 'time', 'rest', 'case', 'audience', 'More', 'point', 'perhaps', 'was', 'underlying', 'message', 'really', 'DOES', 'take', 'maturity', 'wrinkles', 'truly', 'understand', '-and', 'deserve-', 'real', 'love.This', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'down', 'closing', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'watching', 'credits', 'roll', 'was', 'much', 'paying', 'bill', 'meal', 'local', 'hamburger', 'palace', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'sirloin', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either']",N/A

I picked up Must Love Dogs thinking ""chick flicks can't all be bad.""  After all, this one has John Cusack and Diane Lane.So-called ""date"" movies or chickflicks are unsettling not just for the cutesy content.  They perpetuate the destructive myth that Sir Gallahad is out there somewhere, perhaps on an online dating site, waiting to swoop into your life and make everything peachy.Sir Gallahad must have the ""unique constellation of attributes"" to transform a woman's life.  Sensitive but not weak, handsome but not a pretty boy, strong but not domineering,  kind and considerate buy not wimpy.  He must be have the drive and determination to be successful but not so much that it hinders his unstinting support of his woman's myriad interests, which will be covered daily in cheery discussions (happy strings plucking).  He can't be brainy (too distant, lost in thought), but he must have a ""fine mind.""  He needs to have a good but not Chippendalish body.  Etc. Etc. Etc.Must Love Dogs opens with her big lovable movie family gathered around Sarah Nolan (Lane), who has been divorced for eight months.  The family is trying to convince her to get back in the swing of dating.  They give her pictures of prospective Sir Gallahads.  Already my finger is moving toward the stop button on the DVD player.  I remind myself not to be closed-minded.  I'll see this through.This should be a time of blissful freedom for a middle-aged woman whose marriage ends because her husband inexplicably stops loving her.  A character as charming and good-looking as Sarah doesn't need to be in any hurry to find men.  Lane is not believable as a divorce victim moping around and licking her wounds.  I'm not sure Cusack is comfortable in a traditional leading man role.  He plays Jake, a heartbroken builder of racing sculls.The early scenes establish the pervasive desperation that will be resolved by the feel-good payoff everyone knows is coming. We still have to see all the bittersweet misunderstands and missed connections that plague the budding romance right up to the glorious climax.We have to see just how desperate things can get on the singles scene.  Sarah's well-meaning but meddling sister enrolls her in an online dating service.  The result is a string of dates with assorted wierdos and losers. The movies are making up for all of the unflattering bimbo portrayals we have seen over the years.  Soon Sarah is cheerfully creating her own single ads with all the flair of a Cosmo art director.If you set out to design a movie to score high on the heart-warming scale, there must be a  ""unique constellation"" of lovable characters.  Well, let's see.  How about an adorable gay couple (a scrumptious hunk and a lovable schlub)?  How about a quirky older gal (Stockard Channing), an internet-addicted guru of singles advertising?  How about a venerable poetry-spouting dad (Christopher Plummer) with his own heartache to deal with.  Dermot Mulroney does a good job as the too-good-to-be-true single dad who lives at the Whispering Breeze trailer park.The movie builds to a joyous crescendo as we watch Sara jump in a lake. That's right, the elegant Diane Lane takes a header into water that looks laden with pond scum. At this point, many viewers may want to jump too. But Sarah isn't jumping out of desperation. She's swimming toward destiny.Already we have seen the seeds of the relationship's potential undoing.  God forbid Sarah ever finds out that Jake went to a topless bar.

The supporting cast has some impressive actors as well: the awesome Christopher Plummer, Elizabeth Perkins, Stockard Channing, a delightfully smarmy Dermot Mulroney, and some of the cutest dogs in cinema.  You really can't go wrong.I know this movie so well I can recite some of the dialogue and will laugh before the punch lines.  It is simply a feel-good story.  I love the dynamic of Sarah's family - they gather around when times are hard, they don't take themselves or each other too seriously, but they have that foundation of love.  Everybody wants a family like that.  I like to think my family is like that.The dialogue is really good and always manages to hit the right notes.There is a fair amount of talk today among professional movie critics to the effect that no one makes a good romantic comedy any more.  It's easy to make a bad one.  The plots are all similar, and a subpar script can make even an excellent actor look bad.  Must Love Dogs has good actors and a great script.

I do agree that the movie was a tad uneven in terms of its dialogue.  Sometimes the dialogue seemed a bit forced and other times it was so witty as to have been inspired.  The condom-chasing scene was hilarious and is worth the price of the rental in and of itself.I loved that the heroine, Sarah, was a preschool teacher (it's refreshing to see the leading lady in an underappreciated and underpaid profession).  She wasn't the high-fluting CEO of a Fortune 100 company, yet she's an engagingly intelligent woman who loves her job.This movie boasts a very talented cast, and they all pool together to create some magical scenes. I still think of John Cusack as a kid because of his earlier movies, so I forget that he's actually in his 40s and able to play the grown-up, leading man.

As for chick flicks, that's pretty much the list except for one caveat; oddly enough John Cusack who has somehow make a career out of making watchable romantic comedies from hoisting up the jukebox in Say Anything all the way up to one of the best movies of the past ten years, High Fidelity.Cusack's latest entry into the genre is Must Love Dogs, a movie centered on what seems to be a booming business, internet dating.  Both Cusack and his female counterpart, Diane Lane, are recently divorced yet not ready to get back into the game.  But thanks to some nosey family members and an over-sex lawyer, both inadvertently make into the world of on-line dating.  Sadly that's where the hilarity stops.The start of the movie starts off with a few chucklers and looks to be focused on the two main characters as they are forced to get back on the horse.  But once the internet profile is set up, it quickly turns into Lane's movie and Cusack wrongly takes a back seat.  At this point the movie is rarely romantic or comedic, which is never good for a film that is supposed to be in the genre.  Speaking of underused, Stockard Channing is grossly underused as one of Lane's father's girlfriends.  Much like the Cusack character, Channing's looked as if they had a bigger part for it, but never got around to fleshing it out.Plenty of romantic comedy clich&eacute; about most notably the obligatory spontaneous break out into song scene.  Oddly Dermot Mulroney, who may have started this clich&eacute; in My Best Friend's Wedding, is involved in the scene and adds to the insainity of the premise by rushing to the piano to accompany the singing.  And what mobile home doesn't have a piano?  The biggest fraud of this movie hough is that not only did neither main character actually own a dog; Snoop Doggy Dogg didn't even appear in the movie.

Well, Goldberg has spent his career writing and directing sitcoms.  From creating Family Ties, to Spin City, from writing for MASH to Battery Park, Goldberg only has a handful of actual movies under his belt.  The truth is that sitcoms and movies are two entirely separate beasts.  A sitcom is about 20 minutes in length and is there to elicit candy corn laughs that are helped along by a laugh track to tell you when to laugh.  A movie does not have the benefit of a laugh track and is considerably longer than sitcoms, meaning that the hour and a half of sitcom laughs probably won't cut it.I don't mean to be down on sitcoms, in fact I like them.  But there is a difference between the dialogue and humor of a sitcom and the dialogue and humor in a movie.  From the first scene and before I knew who directed and wrote Must Love Dogs, I felt like I was watching a sitcom where sarcastic characters sit around and make barbs at one another.  True, I chuckled at some of the lines, but realistic or even reelistic it wasn't.  At times, it felt like the scenes were mostly there for a witty repartee with each other.  Particularly John Cusack's friend who is a complete stock character and offers up such witty sayings as ""Hey....hey....hey!""And then there's Diane Lane's friends and family who flit in and out of the picture, either to add unhelpful advice or date options or to try and flesh out the story a bit.  But they don't add much, even when in scene.  By far the more interesting character was Stockard Channing's Dolly, a woman who uses the online dating services to try out different personalities and attract different guys.  There's even an awkward scene involving a 15 year old who meets up with Dolly (who's like 61 in the movie).  The scene doesn't work right and comes across more weird and stilted than funny.Diane Lane is lovely and John Cusack is always a favorite of mine, but even they aren't enough to keep this movie going.  The lines just don't sound right coming out of their mouths.  Granted, they do a better job than most of their costars but it still doesn't feel right.  With a better script, this movie would be more enjoyable.All of the romantic comedy conventions are in tact.  You have Diane Lane's love triangle with John Cusack and Dermot Mulroney, one of who is perfect for her, the other not so much.  There's the misunderstanding and the eventual realization.  All standard, romantic comedy stuff.  In the right hands, it works.  In the wrong hands it doesn't.  In my opinion, this movie does not work as well as some of the others I've seen.  It's more intent to be an hour and a half sitcom than a movie.  And we all know those sitcoms that try and stretch the humor from 30 minutes to an hour generally don't succeed.  My recommendation is to miss this one.",3,Mediocre,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2896,"['Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Gary', 'David', 'Goldberg', 'What', 'mean', 'exactly', 'Well', 'Goldberg', 'spent', 'career', 'writing', 'directing', 'sitcoms', 'creating', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Spin', 'City', 'writing', 'MASH', 'Battery', 'Park', 'Goldberg', 'only', 'handful', 'actual', 'movies', 'belt', 'truth', 'sitcoms', 'movies', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'separate', 'beasts', 'sitcom', '20', 'minutes', 'length', 'there', 'elicit', 'candy', 'corn', 'are', 'helped', 'laugh', 'track', 'tell', 'when', 'laugh', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'benefit', 'laugh', 'track', 'considerably', 'longer', 'sitcoms', 'meaning', 'hour', 'half', 'sitcom', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cut', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'down', 'sitcoms', 'fact', 'difference', 'dialogue', 'humor', 'sitcom', 'dialogue', 'humor', 'movie', 'first', 'scene', 'knew', 'who', 'directed', 'wrote', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'sitcom', 'where', 'sarcastic', 'characters', 'sit', 'make', 'barbs', 'one', 'True', 'chuckled', 'lines', 'realistic', 'even', 'reelistic', 'was', ""n't"", 'times', 'felt', 'scenes', 'were', 'mostly', 'witty', 'repartee', 'other', 'Particularly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'friend', 'who', 'complete', 'stock', 'character', 'up', 'such', 'witty', 'sayings', 'Hey', '.hey', '.hey', 'then', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'flit', 'picture', 'add', 'unhelpful', 'advice', 'date', 'options', 'try', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'even', 'when', 'scene', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Dolly', 'woman', 'who', 'online', 'dating', 'services', 'try', 'out', 'different', 'personalities', 'attract', 'different', 'guys', 'even', 'awkward', 'scene', 'involving', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'up', 'Dolly', 'who', '61', 'movie', 'scene', ""n't"", 'work', 'right', 'more', 'weird', 'stilted', 'funny.Diane', 'Lane', 'lovely', 'John', 'Cusack', 'always', 'favorite', 'mine', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'lines', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'coming', 'mouths', 'Granted', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'most', 'costars', 'still', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'better', 'script', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable.All', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'conventions', 'are', 'tact', 'have', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'love', 'triangle', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'one', 'who', 'perfect', 'other', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'misunderstanding', 'eventual', 'realization', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stuff', 'right', 'hands', 'wrong', 'hands', ""n't"", 'opinion', 'movie', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'intent', 'be', 'hour', 'half', 'sitcom', 'movie', 'know', 'sitcoms', 'try', 'stretch', 'humor', '30', 'minutes', 'hour', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'recommendation', 'miss', 'one']",N/A

I'm in the minority of people who think that virginity is attractive and sexual humor shouldn't be funny. The immoral, self-focused life style of every character in the movie made it a completely unenjoyable experience for me. Cussack's friend was a disgusting loser but so were the rest - he was simply open about it. Besides the content, the actors (excluding the likable-despite-himself Cussack) were horribly shallow and sad! Diane Lane seemed to think everyone around her was stupid and less than her wonderful self. She couldn't stick with one facial expression, I think in an attempt to be cute and funny(she succeeded in neither). The plot was simple enough - every man for her/himself, trying to make themselves happy. I often tolerate a bit of the risqu&eacute; for a good movie - this one was way over board and made me wonder why I tolerate any ammount of such garbage.

945791,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BNX3AU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 7]","Admittedly, I am not the demographic for this film. As hard as it tries to cross over and appeal to guys, it can't transcend the boundaries of ""chick flick"".And it isn't even a good `chick flick' at that. Yes, I've seen my share.Sarah (Diane Lane), a recently divorced preschool teacher, is lost when it comes to the dating scene. Her `crazy family' comes over for dinner carrying pictures of eligible guys they want to hook her up with. Her brother-in-law doesn't know of anyone, so he brings a picture of a model from a magazine. After dinner, as they leave, they each pin their picture to her refrigerator. As her father (Christopher Plummer), older sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins), and other brothers and sisters leave, she begins taking the pictures down. Carol also posts Sarah's profile on a singles website under the heading `Must Love Dogs'. She goes on a couple of dates, all of which end in disaster. One day, at the preschool, she realizes that Bob (Dermot Mulroney), a single dad, is really attractive and they begin flirting. She also goes on a strange first date with Jake (John Cusack), a recently divorced wooden scull builder (no, not kidding) who answers her ad.The biggest problem with ""Dogs"", which is actually a very apt name for the film, just remove the `s', is that the screenplay is terrible. Diane Lane and John Cusack are very likable actors and this story would seem tailor fit for their personalities, but they both are simply boring. The story is about Sarah, yet, the only thing we ever learn about her character is that she needs a man in her life to feel happy. Not very enlightened or interesting. We never learn about her hobbies, her interests, anything except that she needs a man. Her character serves as a vehicle for writer/ director Gary David Goldberg to introduce all of the other wacky characters in her life. Except that they aren't that wacky. Dad is an aging widower who lies on his singles website profile, he also juggles three women at once, one of whom, Molly (Swoosie Kurtz, er... actually, it's Stockard Channing, but it's difficult to tell them apart these days) really falls for him and sticks with him even when he has a harem of women around him. Carol buys meat for Sarah to give to each of her dates. Are you laughing yet? I know, I wasn't either.When Sarah and Jake meet for the first time, each of them borrows a dog. I guess Sarah loves dogs so much she doesn't want one in the house. Jake borrows the dog of his friend/ lawyer. The dog is really cute, but their dialogue, which is supposed to smart and witty, is just painful. Jake questions why Sarah put voluptuous in her profile. She gets offended and they make more pained small talk before she leaves. Remarkably, she goes on another date, with similarly awkward circumstances. Then, inexplicably, they are racing around town looking for a condom. This scene might have been funny, if the two characters even seemed remotely interested in one another. Instead, Lane's Sarah is depressed and dour all of the time.Unfortunately, Goldberg seems stuck in the TV landscape he has lived in for so long, he created ""Family Ties"" and worked on many others. He feels it necessary to create wacky situations rather than to create real characters and let the situations come from their real lives. The father's harem, the condom race, Sarah's riding a boat out to meet Jake, all of these situations are so contrived. Normal people don't act like this. Normal film characters don't act like this. TV characters act like this. I half expected Plummer to do a pratfall and land at the feet of a blonde and brunette who console him by rubbing up and down against him.Yes, you ""Must Love Dogs"" if you are going to like this film.",2,Aptly Named Film,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,3733,"['Admittedly', 'am', 'not', 'demographic', 'film', 'As', 'hard', 'cross', 'appeal', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'transcend', 'boundaries', 'chick', 'flick', '.And', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'chick', 'flick', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share.Sarah', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'recently', 'divorced', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'lost', 'when', 'dating', 'scene', 'crazy', 'family', 'dinner', 'carrying', 'pictures', 'eligible', 'guys', 'want', 'hook', 'up', 'brother-in-law', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'picture', 'model', 'magazine', 'dinner', 'leave', 'pin', 'picture', 'refrigerator', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'older', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'other', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'leave', 'taking', 'pictures', 'down', 'Carol', 'also', 'Sarah', 'profile', 'singles', 'heading', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'couple', 'dates', 'end', 'disaster', 'One', 'day', 'preschool', 'Bob', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'single', 'dad', 'really', 'attractive', 'begin', 'flirting', 'also', 'strange', 'first', 'date', 'Jake', 'John', 'Cusack', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wooden', 'scull', 'builder', 'not', 'kidding', 'who', 'ad.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Dogs', 'actually', 'very', 'apt', 'name', 'film', 'just', 'remove', 's', 'screenplay', 'terrible', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'John', 'Cusack', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'actors', 'story', 'would', 'seem', 'tailor', 'fit', 'personalities', 'are', 'simply', 'boring', 'story', 'Sarah', 'yet', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'learn', 'character', 'man', 'life', 'feel', 'happy', 'Not', 'very', 'enlightened', 'interesting', 'never', 'learn', 'hobbies', 'interests', 'anything', 'man', 'character', 'vehicle', 'writer/', 'director', 'Gary', 'David', 'Goldberg', 'introduce', 'other', 'wacky', 'characters', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'wacky', 'Dad', 'aging', 'widower', 'who', 'singles', 'website', 'profile', 'also', 'three', 'women', 'once', 'one', 'whom', 'Molly', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'er', 'actually', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'difficult', 'tell', 'apart', 'days', 'really', 'sticks', 'even', 'when', 'harem', 'women', 'Carol', 'meat', 'Sarah', 'give', 'dates', 'Are', 'laughing', 'yet', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'either.When', 'Sarah', 'Jake', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'dog', 'guess', 'Sarah', 'loves', 'dogs', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'one', 'house', 'Jake', 'dog', 'friend/', 'lawyer', 'dog', 'really', 'cute', 'dialogue', 'supposed', 'smart', 'witty', 'just', 'painful', 'Jake', 'questions', 'why', 'Sarah', 'put', 'voluptuous', 'profile', 'offended', 'make', 'more', 'pained', 'small', 'talk', 'Remarkably', 'date', 'similarly', 'awkward', 'circumstances', 'Then', 'inexplicably', 'are', 'racing', 'town', 'looking', 'condom', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'two', 'characters', 'even', 'seemed', 'remotely', 'interested', 'one', 'Instead', 'Lane', 'Sarah', 'depressed', 'dour', 'time.Unfortunately', 'Goldberg', 'stuck', 'TV', 'landscape', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'created', 'Family', 'Ties', 'worked', 'many', 'others', 'necessary', 'create', 'wacky', 'situations', 'rather', 'create', 'real', 'characters', 'let', 'situations', 'come', 'real', 'lives', 'father', 'harem', 'condom', 'race', 'Sarah', 'riding', 'boat', 'meet', 'Jake', 'situations', 'are', 'so', 'contrived', 'Normal', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'Normal', 'film', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'TV', 'characters', 'act', 'half', 'expected', 'Plummer', 'do', 'pratfall', 'land', 'feet', 'blonde', 'brunette', 'who', 'console', 'rubbing', 'up', 'down', 'him.Yes', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'film']",N/A

945796,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BNX3AU,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 5]","There's nothing wrong with 'Must Love Dogs.'  It has two exceptionally likable characters in center played by Diane Lane and John CUsack, is supported by solid acting from Elizabeth Perkins and Durmot Mulroney, plus veterans Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing, and also features two cute dogs.  The only problem is that what you see in this film, you have already seen in other romantic comedies that have been made these last twenty years.Sarah (Lane) is a kindergarten teacher, recently divorced (for 8 months), who is afraid of dating.  She meets two possible boyfriends -- Bob (Mulroney) daddy of her kids, a handsome, slightly caddish but not a bad guy, and Jake (Cusack) a boat-builder, avid fan of old films like Doctor Zhivago, who also recently parted from his love.  Sounds familiar, isn't it?But of course there are some differences.  Sarah meets Jake through the internet site.  And you can see lovely Lane in 'CATS'-like Holloween costume.  And ... did I tell you about wonderful Christopher Plummer, who reads a poem very beautifully?  That much I can tell you.In spite of many things recycled from the past films, the two leads Lane and Cusack are quite good.  They have played similar roles in the past, but that doesn't mean that 'Must Love Dogs' is waste of your time.

945797,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000BNX3AU,Tucker Andersen,"[4, 7]","Diane Lane is wonderful as Sarah Nolan, the preschool teacher whose family is convinced needs their help in escaping from the emotional wasteland which they see as the result of her recent divorce. In an effort to help Sarah find an interesting date which might blossom into real romance, her sisters Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) and Christine (Ali Hillis) conspire to post her somewhat embellished description which ends with the tag line ""MUST LOVE DOGS"" on an internet dating site. And while Sarah is at first mortified, she becomes intrigued enough to eventually search through the replies and arrange a blind date which initially reinforces her belief in the folly of the endeavor. However, she subsequently decides to make one more attempt, and meets Jake Anderson at the dog park. Jake is there because his friend has convinced him that he needs to stop wallowing in self-pity while repeatedly watching Dr. Zhivago in the belief that it will eventually end happily if he simply waits long enough. The moviegoer immediately senses the symmetry of their emotions, since Jake is also still recovering from his recent divorce and spends his time fashioning wonderful handcrafted wooden racing sculls whose details of master craftmanship are unappreciated by buyers who now want the convenience and speed of the new generation of fiberglass hulls. Of course, as in all romantic comedies, their initial conversation hits several speed bumps and Jake and Sarah and their borrowed (but beloved) dogs each head their separate ways.They do subsequently decide that there was enough attraction to get together for dinner, and a truly hilarious although overblown scene regarding their lack of a condom ensues. (Yes, this movie has some adult moments despite the PG-13 rating and generally bland humor.) Their lives subsequently drift along, with Sarah being gently hit upon Bob Connor (Dermot Mulroney), the recently separated Dad of a very precocious student in her nursery school. After that relationship ends in disappointment (surprise, surprise, since you know Lane and Cusack share the biliing as the two co-stars), a furher obstacle gets in the way when Sarah encounters Jake on a date with a very good looking young woman who a friend has repeatedly implored him to meet. There is also an interrelated plot involving the internet dating habits of Sarah's recently widowed father Bill (Christopher Plummer) and several interested widows including Dolly (Stockard Channing). Of course, after several twists and turns and lots of funny moments, Sarah and Jake eventually reunite in a scene appropriately shared by their third co-star, the Newfoundland wonderfully named Mother Teresa. (No your eyes aren't deceiving you, if you stay for the outtakes which accompany the credits you will see that two slightly different looking dogs shared the work involved in stealing many of the scenes in which Mother Teresa was on camera.)This movie is exactly what it is advertised to be. It is a lighthearted adult romantic comedy to simply be enjoyed in the knowledge that there will be many truly funny moments and that you will feel good when you leave the theater. (The audience when we attended laughed out loud frequently, not just smiled and chuckled.)  It doesn't have the star power of NOTTING HILL or the chemistry of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in PRETTY WOMAN, but the performances of the leads are very good and the moviegoer soon thinks of them as Sarah and Jake, not Diane Lane and John Cusack. It also has the most memorable dogs in a romantic comedy since Bear and Bryant in the also critically panned but extremely enjoyable SWEET HOME ALABAMA. So, while strictly speaking there is no requirement that you MUST LOVE DOGS to enjoy this film, if you do you will certainly get an extra measure of enjoyment from it.Tucker Andersen",4,(4-) A Dog Named Mother Teresa Saves Two Lost Souls,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3835,"['Diane', 'Lane', 'wonderful', 'Sarah', 'Nolan', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'family', 'convinced', 'needs', 'help', 'escaping', 'emotional', 'wasteland', 'see', 'result', 'recent', 'divorce', 'effort', 'help', 'Sarah', 'find', 'interesting', 'date', 'might', 'blossom', 'real', 'romance', 'sisters', 'Carol', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Christine', 'Ali', 'Hillis', 'conspire', 'post', 'somewhat', 'embellished', 'description', 'tag', 'line', 'MUST', 'LOVE', 'DOGS', 'internet', 'dating', 'site', 'Sarah', 'first', 'mortified', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'eventually', 'search', 'replies', 'arrange', 'blind', 'date', 'initially', 'belief', 'folly', 'endeavor', 'However', 'subsequently', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'attempt', 'meets', 'Jake', 'Anderson', 'dog', 'park', 'Jake', 'there', 'friend', 'convinced', 'stop', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'repeatedly', 'watching', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'belief', 'will', 'eventually', 'end', 'happily', 'simply', 'long', 'enough', 'moviegoer', 'immediately', 'symmetry', 'emotions', 'Jake', 'also', 'still', 'recovering', 'recent', 'divorce', 'time', 'fashioning', 'wonderful', 'handcrafted', 'wooden', 'racing', 'sculls', 'details', 'master', 'craftmanship', 'are', 'unappreciated', 'buyers', 'who', 'now', 'want', 'convenience', 'speed', 'new', 'generation', 'fiberglass', 'hulls', 'course', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'initial', 'conversation', 'several', 'speed', 'bumps', 'Jake', 'Sarah', 'borrowed', 'beloved', 'dogs', 'head', 'separate', 'ways.They', 'do', 'subsequently', 'decide', 'was', 'enough', 'attraction', 'get', 'together', 'dinner', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'overblown', 'scene', 'regarding', 'lack', 'condom', 'ensues', 'Yes', 'movie', 'adult', 'moments', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'generally', 'bland', 'humor', 'lives', 'subsequently', 'drift', 'along', 'Sarah', 'being', 'gently', 'hit', 'Bob', 'Connor', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'recently', 'separated', 'Dad', 'very', 'precocious', 'student', 'nursery', 'school', 'relationship', 'disappointment', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'know', 'Lane', 'Cusack', 'share', 'biliing', 'two', 'co-stars', 'furher', 'obstacle', 'way', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Jake', 'date', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'friend', 'repeatedly', 'implored', 'meet', 'also', 'interrelated', 'plot', 'involving', 'internet', 'dating', 'habits', 'Sarah', 'recently', 'widowed', 'father', 'Bill', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'several', 'interested', 'widows', 'including', 'Dolly', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'course', 'several', 'twists', 'turns', 'lots', 'funny', 'moments', 'Sarah', 'Jake', 'eventually', 'scene', 'appropriately', 'shared', 'third', 'co-star', 'Newfoundland', 'wonderfully', 'named', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'eyes', 'are', ""n't"", 'deceiving', 'stay', 'outtakes', 'accompany', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'two', 'slightly', 'different', 'looking', 'dogs', 'shared', 'work', 'involved', 'stealing', 'many', 'scenes', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'was', 'camera', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'advertised', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'adult', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'simply', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'knowledge', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'will', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'leave', 'theater', 'audience', 'when', 'attended', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'frequently', 'not', 'just', 'smiled', 'chuckled', ""n't"", 'have', 'star', 'power', 'NOTTING', 'HILL', 'chemistry', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'moviegoer', 'soon', 'thinks', 'Sarah', 'Jake', 'not', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'John', 'Cusack', 'also', 'most', 'memorable', 'dogs', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Bear', 'Bryant', 'also', 'critically', 'panned', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'SWEET', 'HOME', 'ALABAMA', 'So', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'requirement', 'MUST', 'LOVE', 'DOGS', 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', 'will', 'certainly', 'get', 'extra', 'measure', 'enjoyment', 'it.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

I thought that the basic plot (that revolves around internet dating) was pretty good.  I did not feel, however, that the writers used enough imagination in constructing the scenes and dialogue.  So many of the lines and situations seem like those I have seen and heard in other movies.I especially remember a scene between the female romantic lead, Diane Lane, and her father played by Christopher Plummer.  The daughter is complaining to her father about all the women he keeps stringing along, including her friend played by Stockard Channing.  The father's reply is that he has already had the great love of his life (his late wife and the mother of Diane Lane's character) and so can now do little more than just go through the motions.  I have seen this same scene and dialogue in other movies!While watching this movie, I felt like I often knew what the characters are going to say before they spoke their lines.  It is as if the writers had a dictionary of to movie cliches to which they constantly refered in constructing the dialogue!One scene that I did like, however, was the one in which Stochard Channing is showing Diane Lane all of her various internet dating profiles.  In one she presents herself as an outdoorsy cowgirl--in another as an artsy type, etc.I also liked the scene on Cusack and Lane's first date he realizes that he doesn't have any condoms, so they end up driving all over town late at night in search of a drug store that is still open.There really were things in this movie that I liked.  But there were others things that disappointed me.

This film is certainly more tailor-made for Lane, since she dominated most of the movie, and she's good, even if not as good as her previous career revival roles in Unfaithful and Under The Tuscan Sun. John Cusack is a bit underexposed and miscast for his part, and he's been far more enjoyable to watch in movies like High Fidelity or Bullets Over Broadway.Sarah(Lane) is divorced pre-school teacher and she's been encouraged by her family to get out and start dating again. She reluctantly goes on dates with men whom responded to an internet ad that was posted by her sister(Elizabeth Perkins). She had to go through a string of aweful first dates before meeting her ideal soulmate(Jake/John Cusack), who happened to be on the mend from an unpleasant divorce. He's the only guy that she went beyond the first date, but she's not ready to open herself emotionally. It was very funny to see them on the second date together when they had to drive all over town to buy condoms.  Meanwhile, she's got another potential boyfriend(Bob/Dermot Mulroney) trying to enter her life. Bob is a single ""hot dad"" whose kid happens to be Sarah's student, and they are obviously attracted to each other.Sarah's Dad(Christopher Plummer) also goes on serial dating women he met on-line. (Dolly)Stockard Channing is the one that truly fell for him, despite the fact that he's not serious about falling in love again after his departed wife. Channing stole scenes with her comic moments, especially in the scenes when she showed Sarah her ads on various websites and when a teenage guy came to see her after corresponding on line.Sarah eventually learned to let herself go and be brave and went on as many dates as she could. She soon realized that Bob was just taking an advantage of her sexually and didn't take her seriously like Jake did, but she had turned Jake away when he saw her with Bob. Can ""Dog Park Girl"" find her way back into the arms of ""Condom Man"" before he loses his good intension and go for other girls?Overall, this film is pretty funny and so-so romantic ,and it's got lots of chick-flick cliche jokes that will work for the female crowds.
