334299,AZ1PS5SHWHE0U,6302787513,Erka16,"[15, 15]","North and South by far has to be the best TV miniseries of all time.  The saga of the Hazard and Main families is set against a back drop of a fairly young country about to be divided by civil war.The series begins with Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) of Mount Royal, South Carolina setting off to go to the Military Academy at West Point.  On his way he rescues the very beautiful Madeline Fabray(Leslie-Anne Down) from a buggy accident and a snake.  After taking Ms. Fabray to her destination, he is back on his journey to West Point.  Another character that Orry meets on his trip is George Hazard(James Read) and they soon become life long friends.  North and South follows both Orry and George during their time at the Point, the Mexican War and after.  There is an all-star cast too many to mention.This first installment of the North and South Trilogy follows the lives of both Orry and George and their respective families through the period leading up to the Civil War.  North and South written by John Jakes is the best historical fiction book I have read and this Miniseries has stayed true to form.  Because of the historical correctness I would say that this movie has enough appeal for those men that can't get enough of Civil War history or even general war history.  The main characters in this are fictional, however there are references to historical figures like Lincoln, Grant and Lee to name a few.  However there is certainly plenty of appeal to women, namely Swayze and there is an excellent love story as well.  That being said I definitely recommend seeing this miniseries as well as North and South Book Two: Love and War.",5,Simply EXCELLENT,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,1643,"['North', 'South', 'far', 'be', 'best', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'time', 'saga', 'Hazard', 'Main', 'families', 'set', 'back', 'drop', 'fairly', 'young', 'country', 'be', 'divided', 'civil', 'war.The', 'series', 'Orry', 'Main', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Mount', 'Royal', 'South', 'Carolina', 'setting', 'off', 'go', 'Military', 'Academy', 'West', 'Point', 'way', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Madeline', 'Fabray', 'Leslie-Anne', 'Down', 'buggy', 'accident', 'snake', 'taking', 'Ms.', 'Fabray', 'destination', 'back', 'journey', 'West', 'Point', 'character', 'Orry', 'trip', 'George', 'Hazard', 'James', 'Read', 'soon', 'become', 'life', 'long', 'friends', 'North', 'South', 'Orry', 'George', 'time', 'Point', 'Mexican', 'War', 'all-star', 'cast', 'too', 'many', 'mention.This', 'first', 'installment', 'North', 'South', 'Trilogy', 'lives', 'Orry', 'George', 'respective', 'families', 'period', 'leading', 'up', 'Civil', 'War', 'North', 'South', 'written', 'John', 'Jakes', 'best', 'historical', 'fiction', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'Miniseries', 'stayed', 'true', 'form', 'historical', 'correctness', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'enough', 'appeal', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'even', 'general', 'war', 'history', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'fictional', 'however', 'are', 'references', 'historical', 'figures', 'Lincoln', 'Grant', 'Lee', 'name', 'few', 'However', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'appeal', 'women', 'namely', 'Swayze', 'excellent', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'said', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'miniseries', 'as', 'well', 'North', 'South', 'Book', 'Two', 'Love', 'War']",N/A

One friend is from the South and the other from the North.  The Abolitionist were preaching about the evils of slavery, the brutality of the slave owners, and the inevitiblity of machines.North and South is filled with action, carnage, tragedy, sorrow, joy, marriages, obligations, jealousy, true love, and passion.  This is probably the best work for Patrick Swayze.  Swayze acting and character were likely and complex, filled with emotion, anger, confidence, love, romance, and empathy.""Gone with the wind"" is a boring epic, in comparison too, ""North and South"".  North and South ranks among great Civil War movies, such as, ""Gods and Generals"" and ""Gettysburg"".South Carolina repulsion of Union law and confederacy too succeed from the Union sets the stage for the drama.  The war with Mexico for Texas one campaign.  The soap opera of family tradegy ends to the first Civil war battle.Tradegy at Harpers Ferry is painful.  Virgal's prediction of blood happens as her husband is shot and killed.  Billie and Brent marry.  Whoredoms, backstabbing, betrayal, incest, abortion, infidelity, and adultery are source of embarrassment and degeneration of the chastity Mount Royal and Resolute Southern women.  Pride hardens the heart of the Southern way of life - believing slaves were property and must be controlled by torture.  Gentlemen rules reign supreme and honor maintained by dueling.  Slave labour will endure because the North misunderstands - Uncle Toms cabin would end that.  The machine would produce great wealth for Mount Royal but not free the slaves on the plantation even though one of the agreements was ""no slaves"".  The darkeness of slavery will not dispel immediately and hundreds of years of oppression can not be lifted with sacrifice.

Both North and South, Books 1 &amp; 2, are the perfect compliment to the historical setting and diverse sentiment prior to and during the American Civil War.

A great deal of the first movie was filmed almost exclusively in and around Charleston, SC.  Bill Conti's musical score fits perfectly with production.

334305,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6302787513,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[3, 3]","The best thing about this series is the way it doesn't just present the war as a fait accompli, but as an inevitable consequence of having two strongly divergent ways of life taking root in one country. It makes no overt attempt to judge either, simply presents them as they were: In the North you have crowded factory cities, floods of immigrants, no traditions, no respect for Europe, new money, social Darwinism, corruption, a fast pace, and a sense of advancing into tomorrow. In the South you have agriculture, small towns, plantations where the 18th century never ended, a slow and leisurely pace of life, a European code of honor (and of aristocracy), and a way of life predicated on slavery which, if people had their druthers, would never change. Wherein lies part of the problem -- ""Progress"" to the North meant just that -- change. To the South it meant a pleasant sort of stagnation. It was only a matter of time before they came into conflict, and ""N & S"" also does a good, if somewhat TV-moviesh, job of presenting this slow buildup. It avoids the anti-Southern bias which infects Hollywood films to this day and shows that in most cases, Southerners fought out of a sense of resentment -- i.e., that their way of life was being attacked by Northerners -- and out of patriotism for their particular ""state"" (which they viewed as their real country) rather than out of racism, greed, or hate for the U.S. In those days the concept of the U.S. as a single country was more of an idea than a fact, and the series ably demonstrates this. ""North & South"" is sometimes dismissed by people who turn up their noses at television movies or by people who don't like Patrick Swayze, but Swayze does a very commendable job of showing the complexities of Southern character -- goods, bads, and uglies -- and how not all the good was on one side.

334313,ALD1CRUBY1365,6302787513,R. L. MILLER,"[7, 10]","The superb casting and directing of this miniseries aside, it taught even this miniseries buff that all miniseries aren't necessarily great simply because they're big. The schools of western New York taught me about the struggle between us Noble Yankees and our saintly belief in human dignity, versus the evil-nasty Johnny Rebs with their ingratitude towards their own country and their cruelty towards their slaves. Give a man a drawl, a bullwhip and dress him in a Klan robe, ya gotcha basic southerner. Which is to say, the way character Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) feels about southerners in this film. Although care was taken to portray co-protagonist Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) as a good sort of guy, there is the feeling that he's an exception to the general run of his kinfolk. Look at his own kid sister Ashton (Teri Garber), for example. You take Scarlett O'Hara's vixenish little-ole-me hypocrisy and self-centeredness, leave out her courage, and you've got Ashton. But even that isn't enough Reb-bashing for the producers--they transplant villain Elkanah Bent (Phillip Casnoff) from the Ohio that Jakes has him coming from to Carolina to give them yet another sneering Southron. TV Guide gave Casnoff's protrayal of Bent the ""Snidely Whiplash Award"", and rightly so. I'll admit that this film taught me the correct pronunciation of Bent's first name--it rhymes with ""Dana"", not ""marijuana"". But come on already! As a Yankee, I was taught revisionist history decades before I heard the term for it. Now that I'm old enough to have a less-biased view of that part of my country's history, do I really need the same thing in fiction? John Jakes remarks that, while he was doing research for the book, at least one local asked indignantly; ""How can a Yankee presume to come down here and write about US?"" I wouldn't doubt that some of those people, if they later read the book, would regret being so defensive toward Jakes. But then they'd watch this film and regret not having had tar and feathers with them at the time.",3,Regional bias that John Jakes never put in the book,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2034,"['superb', 'casting', 'directing', 'miniseries', 'aside', 'taught', 'even', 'miniseries', 'buff', 'miniseries', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'great', 'simply', ""'re"", 'big', 'schools', 'western', 'New', 'York', 'taught', 'struggle', 'Noble', 'Yankees', 'saintly', 'belief', 'human', 'dignity', 'evil-nasty', 'Johnny', 'Rebs', 'ingratitude', 'own', 'country', 'cruelty', 'slaves', 'Give', 'man', 'drawl', 'bullwhip', 'dress', 'Klan', 'robe', 'gotcha', 'basic', 'southerner', 'say', 'way', 'character', 'Virgilia', 'Hazard', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'southerners', 'film', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'portray', 'co-protagonist', 'Orry', 'Main', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'good', 'sort', 'guy', 'feeling', 'exception', 'general', 'run', 'kinfolk', 'Look', 'own', 'kid', 'sister', 'Ashton', 'Teri', 'Garber', 'example', 'take', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'vixenish', 'little-ole-me', 'hypocrisy', 'self-centeredness', 'leave', 'out', 'courage', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Ashton', 'even', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Reb-bashing', 'producers', 'transplant', 'villain', 'Elkanah', 'Bent', 'Phillip', 'Casnoff', 'Ohio', 'Jakes', 'coming', 'Carolina', 'give', 'yet', 'sneering', 'Southron', 'TV', 'Guide', 'gave', 'Casnoff', 'protrayal', 'Bent', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'Award', 'rightly', 'so', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'film', 'taught', 'correct', 'pronunciation', 'Bent', 'first', 'name', 'Dana', 'not', 'marijuana', 'come', 'already', 'Yankee', 'was', 'taught', 'revisionist', 'history', 'decades', 'heard', 'term', 'Now', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'less-biased', 'view', 'part', 'country', 'history', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'same', 'thing', 'fiction', 'John', 'Jakes', 'remarks', 'was', 'doing', 'research', 'book', 'least', 'one', 'local', 'asked', 'indignantly', 'How', 'can', 'Yankee', 'presume', 'come', 'down', 'here', 'write', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'people', 'later', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'regret', 'being', 'so', 'defensive', 'Jakes', 'then', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'regret', 'not', 'having', 'had', 'tar', 'feathers', 'time']",N/A
334314,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6302787513,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[1, 1]","This 1985 epic miniseries aired on television only and starred the popular and sexy actor Patrick Swayzee (from Dirty Dancing and Ghost) and the equally sexy James Read (Love Crimes). The saga follows two families, a Yankee Northern family and a Southern one, effectively depicting the divided country during the American Civil War. It is a highly engaging work of historical fiction, a costume drama that vividly portrays the reality of the period. As this is true to historic fact, although romanticized and dramatized for the sake of a movie, it is still very suitable for a class that is teaching the period of the Civil War. Since it is so long, it's best to watch only highlights. However, for history buffs and for those who are interested in the Civil Ware in particular, this film is quite a treat.Patrick Swayzee oozes with charm and Southern gentility, as well as courage. James Read hold his own with his own sex appeal and his acting prowess. The women who are their love interests also do a good job. The industrialized, more modern and progressive North does come off as more humanitarian and idealistic, as historic accounts manage to give us the impression, whereas the rural South holds darker aspects- slavery and abuse, ironically amid the wealthy and leisure classes of the rich. We have come along way since the Civil War. Although we are far more united than we were then, there are still so many differences that tend to pull people apart- race, ethnic groups, culture, religion, gender, social status, political affiliations, sexuality, etc. We are a motley bunch that lives in the same country but seem to inhabit our seperate own. Let us hope movies such as this teach us that this country is best loved for its freedom and equal rights for all its inhabitants.",5,An Enjoyable And Educational Costume Drama,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1788,"['1985', 'epic', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'television', 'only', 'starred', 'popular', 'sexy', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'Swayzee', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Ghost', 'equally', 'sexy', 'James', 'Read', 'Love', 'Crimes', 'saga', 'two', 'families', 'Yankee', 'Northern', 'family', 'Southern', 'one', 'effectively', 'depicting', 'divided', 'country', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'highly', 'engaging', 'work', 'historical', 'fiction', 'costume', 'drama', 'vividly', 'reality', 'period', 'true', 'historic', 'fact', 'romanticized', 'dramatized', 'sake', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'suitable', 'class', 'teaching', 'period', 'Civil', 'War', 'so', 'long', 'best', 'watch', 'only', 'highlights', 'However', 'history', 'buffs', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Civil', 'Ware', 'particular', 'film', 'quite', 'treat.Patrick', 'Swayzee', 'charm', 'Southern', 'gentility', 'as', 'well', 'courage', 'James', 'Read', 'hold', 'own', 'own', 'sex', 'appeal', 'acting', 'prowess', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'love', 'interests', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'industrialized', 'more', 'modern', 'progressive', 'North', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'humanitarian', 'idealistic', 'historic', 'accounts', 'manage', 'give', 'impression', 'rural', 'South', 'darker', 'aspects-', 'slavery', 'abuse', 'ironically', 'wealthy', 'leisure', 'classes', 'rich', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'Civil', 'War', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'united', 'were', 'then', 'are', 'still', 'so', 'many', 'differences', 'tend', 'pull', 'people', 'apart-', 'race', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'culture', 'religion', 'gender', 'social', 'status', 'political', 'affiliations', 'sexuality', 'etc', 'are', 'motley', 'bunch', 'same', 'country', 'seem', 'inhabit', 'seperate', 'own', 'Let', 'hope', 'movies', 'such', 'teach', 'country', 'best', 'loved', 'freedom', 'equal', 'rights', 'inhabitants']",N/A

Sadly, they failed with HEAVEN AND HELL: NORTH AND SOUTH, BOOK 3). I was only one year old when the miniseries first came out. When I finally saw it, I was impressed by the superb acting by all of the actors, and the battle sequences were handled with the utmost care, making them look both exciting AND accurate. It takes you back to that time before the Civil War began, and shows us the many reasons why the bloodiest war on the face of the continent was fought.
