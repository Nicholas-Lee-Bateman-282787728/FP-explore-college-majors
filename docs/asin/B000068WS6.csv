For 30 years, America went to sleep at 11:30 with Johnny Carson. Though he kept a pretty low profile after he left the show in 1992, he still remained a legend in tv history.""The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments From The Tonight Show (Vols. 1-3) (1962-1992)"" is 3 discs filled with some of the most memorable moments in the show's history, from Ed Ames' tomahawak throw to Buddy Hackett talking about his boat to Tiny Tim's wedding to Jimmy Stewart's poetry. Plus many of his great characters are here - Art Fern, Aunt Blabby, and of course, Carnac (Question: Dippy Doo? Answer: What forms on your dippy in the morning).Disc 2 also features ""Johnny Goes Home"", a somber look at his return to his hometown in Nebraska. It features a surprisingly serious Carson as he returns to his house and his school. Disc 3 features Johnny's last 2 shows. First is his last show with guests. Featuring memorable appearances by Robin Williams and Bette Midler (whose serenade at the end is heartwrenching), it is a true tv classic. Then there's his last show, a look back at 30 years of laughter.This is a great collection of classic American comedy. I hope that a second volume will come out to showcase the many more memorable moments from Johnny's 30 years on the show.",5,"Hilarious, Truly Carson At His Best",1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,1369,"['When', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'died', 'January', '23rd', '2005', 'huge', 'void', 'was', 'left', 'world', 'tv', '30', 'years', 'America', 'went', 'sleep', '11:30', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'kept', 'pretty', 'low', 'profile', 'left', 'show', '1992', 'still', 'remained', 'legend', 'tv', 'history', 'Ultimate', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Collection', 'Favorite', 'Moments', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Vols', '1-3', '1962-1992', '3', 'discs', 'filled', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'show', 'history', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'tomahawak', 'throw', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'talking', 'boat', 'Tiny', 'Tim', 'wedding', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'poetry', 'many', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'Art', 'Fern', 'Aunt', 'Blabby', 'course', 'Carnac', 'Question', 'Dippy', 'Doo', 'Answer', 'What', 'dippy', 'morning', '2', 'also', 'Johnny', 'Goes', 'Home', 'somber', 'look', 'return', 'hometown', 'Nebraska', 'surprisingly', 'serious', 'Carson', 'house', 'school', 'Disc', '3', 'features', 'Johnny', 'last', '2', 'shows', 'First', 'last', 'show', 'guests', 'Featuring', 'memorable', 'appearances', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'serenade', 'end', 'heartwrenching', 'true', 'tv', 'classic', 'Then', 'last', 'show', 'look', 'back', '30', 'years', 'laughter.This', 'great', 'collection', 'classic', 'American', 'comedy', 'hope', 'second', 'volume', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'showcase', 'many', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Johnny', '30', 'years', 'show']",The Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show 1962-1992  VHS

You get the real feeling you know Johnny as you get everything from behind stage scenes to a view of Johnny's home town told by Johnny himself.The three DVD's are a little much to view in one sitting and are fun to rematch.

Don't get me wrong. There are some great ones in here but too many duff ones, too. Does anyone on the globe think Albert Brooks is remotely funny (he was like the Ray Romano of the '80s)?Anyway, where was more of Johnny--no Floyd R. Turbo, no ""take the Slausen cutoff"" guy, no Aunt Blabby. How about a clip of where Bob Hope suddenly appears and cuts into the show unannounced. That happened numerous times and is a classic. Or Stump the Band when Johnny goes into the audience and interacts with the ""regular"" folks. Or his stuff with Carol Wayne as his sidekick. There was some busty babe in a couple of routines but didn't look like Carol.There's overkill on animals and on bizarre people. Hey, the chip lady is fine but the accordian lady?

706409,A218A1NFBSHZ0U,B000068WS6,David B. Minter,"[29, 32]","If you have the VHS tape collection that was released in the 1990's, you may want to hold on to them.  This collection contains the same episodes, however, there are some segments that were trimmed.  For instance, within the actual video files themselves on the DVD are the opening title cards used on the VHS tapes, e.g. ""KING OF LAUGHS!""  The control files on the DVD, though, start playing the video after that.  However, the major disappointment is in however actually authored these DVD's.Sloppy and erroneous programming abounds on these discs.  For instance, if you use your remote to try to access the main menu directly, the 1 to 2 minute opening introduction plays.  You can Next skip past this BUT it loads the next video file in the stream, which on these discs can be any of the sub menus from the main menu.  You're forced to watch through it or fast forward just to get to the main menu again.  Disc 2 is entirely unforgivable because it's Scenes menu for The Best Of The 80's And 90's does not work at all on any player I tested, stand alone, computer, or otherwise!  Select your favorite scene, and, oh!  Nope!  It acts as a Start button instead, playing the VERY FIRST scene.  Regardless of the Scene you pick!There are abundant video errors, too, converting the material.  Granted, some of the source video is not the best.  Many of the surviving Carson shows only exist on kinescope, basically using a film camera to record the broadcast off of a TV screen.  Still, most of the errors are in existing color material that has aired fine before on the VHS tapes and on TV.  For instance, one scene from Disc 1 clearly goes into off shades of solid green colors for a few frames.  Another develops wavy static momentarily.  Another has pixelated pink that shows up.However, just in general, there's poor video conversion to begin with.  Even stuff from the 1980's and 90's on Disc 2 is blurry when things move.  Stuff appears to be slightly slow mo, too.  Like the old experience of video on a PC, frames are dropped, even though the DVD picture quality is higher.While offering some new material, what you have to sacrifice in exchange is most likely not worth the price.",3,Non-existing quality control mars existing material,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2189,"['have', 'VHS', 'tape', 'collection', 'was', 'released', '1990', 'may', 'want', 'hold', 'collection', 'same', 'episodes', 'however', 'are', 'segments', 'were', 'trimmed', 'instance', 'actual', 'video', 'DVD', 'are', 'opening', 'title', 'cards', 'used', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'e.g', 'KING', 'OF', 'LAUGHS', 'control', 'DVD', 'though', 'start', 'playing', 'video', 'However', 'major', 'disappointment', 'however', 'actually', 'authored', ""DVD's.Sloppy"", 'erroneous', 'programming', 'abounds', 'discs', 'instance', 'use', 'remote', 'try', 'access', 'main', 'menu', 'directly', '1', '2', 'minute', 'opening', 'introduction', 'plays', 'can', 'Next', 'skip', 'past', 'BUT', 'next', 'video', 'file', 'stream', 'discs', 'can', 'be', 'sub', 'menus', 'main', 'menu', ""'re"", 'forced', 'watch', 'fast', 'forward', 'just', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'again', 'Disc', '2', 'entirely', 'unforgivable', 'Scenes', 'menu', 'Best', '80', '90', 'not', 'work', 'player', 'tested', 'stand', 'alone', 'computer', 'otherwise', 'Select', 'favorite', 'scene', 'oh', 'Nope', 'Start', 'button', 'instead', 'playing', 'VERY', 'FIRST', 'scene', 'Regardless', 'Scene', 'pick', 'are', 'abundant', 'video', 'errors', 'too', 'converting', 'material', 'Granted', 'source', 'video', 'not', 'best', 'Many', 'surviving', 'Carson', 'only', 'exist', 'kinescope', 'basically', 'using', 'film', 'camera', 'record', 'broadcast', 'off', 'TV', 'screen', 'Still', 'most', 'errors', 'are', 'existing', 'color', 'material', 'aired', 'fine', 'before', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'TV', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'Disc', '1', 'clearly', 'off', 'shades', 'solid', 'green', 'colors', 'few', 'frames', 'wavy', 'static', 'momentarily', 'pixelated', 'pink', 'up.However', 'just', 'general', 'poor', 'video', 'conversion', 'begin', 'Even', 'stuff', '1980', '90', 'Disc', '2', 'blurry', 'when', 'things', 'move', 'Stuff', 'be', 'slightly', 'slow', 'mo', 'too', 'old', 'experience', 'video', 'PC', 'frames', 'are', 'dropped', 'even', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'higher.While', 'offering', 'new', 'material', 'what', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'exchange', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'price']",The Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show 1962-1992  VHS

Lund ""jazzbrat""","[10, 11]","Although this ""highlights"" format isn't my first choice for how I'd like to see the Johnny Carson archives reissued, it's hard to argue with nearly three hours of mostly hilarious highlights (in three segments, basically covering the early, middle and later years of the show's 1962-1992 run).  It's fine for starters, but with so much quality material to choose from, one hopes for more in-depth DVDs to come (special videos devoted to multiple appearances by a single guest is merely one idea for how they could proceed).These segments contain clips from Carson's monologues, some of his skits (Carnac, Carson as Reagan adapting the ""Who's on first?"" routine, etc.), chatting with famous guests (entertainers, political figures), a number of the more memorable segments with animals, children, and non-showbiz people, classic bits with Ed and Doc, and other highlights that have stood the test of time moreso than most other comedians of ANY era.  Carson is one tv legend whose brand of comedy is apt to continue to attract younger generations, even those too young to have watched the shows when they originally aired.  The humor is a charming mixture of still-edgy material with comedy appropriate for all ages.I was disappointed that the last two shows from May 1992 are incomplete.  Among the no-shows are the memorable collage of music performers from the final episode.  Licensing problems, perhaps?  What does make the cut is classic, of course.  There is also an excellent 1982 prime-time special where a relaxed Johnny revisits his home town.  Not intended to be a comedy show, it is rather a highly-watchable peek at Carson away from the showbiz environment (revealing a down-to-earth side of him that will likely surprise a lot of viewers).  While there are a few other minor extras, it is the areas I mentioned that make this three-DVD set an excellent overview of television's all-time premiere late-night host.

I always loved Johnny's anniversary shows where he would break out old clips from over the years along with the highlights of the year just ended.  So the package seemed intringing, but I decided to rent first.  Good decision.It is not that the content of the shows is terrible.  Far from it.  It's just woefully short on material to justify the rather steep pricetag of a 3 disc set.  Understanding that a lot of the tapes from the early years were destroyed years ago, there still had to be over 20 years of material to put together several more hours.  Instead, there is a ""Best of the 60s/70s"", ""Best of the 70s/80s"" and ""Best of the 80s/90s"" segment, each about 45 minutes each.  Many of the classics are here (the Ed Ames hatchet throw, George Gobel's brown shoes joke, the marmoset using Johnny's head as a restroom, Jimmy Stewart's poem about his dog Bo, even a very funny intro of future president Clinton), but there had to be more.  There were no Floyd R. Turbo (who I consider the first right wing militant) bits nor was my favorite Carnac the Magnificent moment included (the answer is Sis-Boom-Bah, the question: What sound does an exploding sheep make).  The latter omission is interesting because I seem to recall Carson saying at one time that that bit garned the biggest laugh in the show's history.There's also Carson's last shows, which I actually already have on tape, so other than a better picture, it doesn't do it for me.  There's also a show from 1982 when Johnny went back home to Nebraska to visit old hangouts and friends that was interesting.In summary, some great moments, but there should have been more!",3,"What's There Is Great, But There Should Be A Lot More",1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,1697,"['himmed', 'hawed', 'purchasing', 'Carson', 'DVD', 'package', 'always', 'loved', 'Johnny', 'anniversary', 'shows', 'where', 'would', 'break', 'out', 'old', 'clips', 'years', 'highlights', 'year', 'just', 'ended', 'package', 'seemed', 'intringing', 'decided', 'rent', 'first', 'Good', 'decision.It', 'not', 'content', 'shows', 'terrible', 'Far', 'just', 'woefully', 'short', 'material', 'justify', 'rather', 'steep', 'pricetag', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'Understanding', 'lot', 'tapes', 'early', 'years', 'were', 'destroyed', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'had', 'be', '20', 'years', 'material', 'put', 'together', 'several', 'more', 'hours', 'Instead', 'Best', '60s/70s', 'Best', '70s/80s', 'Best', '80s/90s', 'segment', '45', 'minutes', 'Many', 'classics', 'are', 'here', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'hatchet', 'throw', 'George', 'Gobel', 'brown', 'shoes', 'joke', 'marmoset', 'using', 'Johnny', 'head', 'restroom', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'poem', 'dog', 'Bo', 'even', 'very', 'funny', 'intro', 'future', 'president', 'Clinton', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'more', 'were', 'Floyd', 'R.', 'Turbo', 'who', 'consider', 'first', 'right', 'wing', 'militant', 'bits', 'was', 'favorite', 'Carnac', 'Magnificent', 'moment', 'included', 'answer', 'Sis-Boom-Bah', 'question', 'What', 'sound', 'exploding', 'sheep', 'make', 'latter', 'omission', 'interesting', 'seem', 'recall', 'Carson', 'saying', 'one', 'time', 'bit', 'garned', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'show', 'history.There', 'also', 'Carson', 'last', 'shows', 'actually', 'already', 'have', 'tape', 'other', 'better', 'picture', ""n't"", 'do', 'also', 'show', '1982', 'when', 'Johnny', 'went', 'back', 'home', 'Nebraska', 'visit', 'old', 'hangouts', 'friends', 'was', 'interesting.In', 'summary', 'great', 'moments', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more']",The Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show 1962-1992  VHS

From 1962 to 1992, Carson reigned supreme as a comedian and broadcaster. Unlike Letterman and Leno, Johnny did his homework when it came to nightly conversation. No matter who sat on the couch, he remained an astute and observant host. ""The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection"" is an expanded three-DVD set of ""Tonight Show"" highlights selected by Johnny himself, with the welcome addition of his final two programs. The set also includes the 1982 NBC special ""Johnny Goes Home"" - a nostalgic, affectionate look at Carson's return to his hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska. Loaded with extras (and some recently discovered film clips from the early 1960s), the DVD collection provides first-rate material at a reasonable price. If this set leaves you wanting more, the six-DVD ""Timeless Moments"" series is highly recommended.",5,The Man Behind the Desk,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,1103,"['today', 'era', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'younger', 'generations', 'should', 'remember', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'predecessors', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'defined', 'talk-show', 'format', 'made', 'late-night', 'television', 'enduring', 'immensely', 'profitable', 'enterprise', '1962', '1992', 'Carson', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'comedian', 'broadcaster', 'Letterman', 'Leno', 'Johnny', 'did', 'homework', 'when', 'came', 'nightly', 'conversation', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'sat', 'couch', 'remained', 'astute', 'observant', 'host', 'Ultimate', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Collection', 'expanded', 'three-DVD', 'set', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'highlights', 'selected', 'Johnny', 'welcome', 'addition', 'final', 'two', 'programs', 'set', 'also', '1982', 'NBC', 'special', 'Johnny', 'Goes', 'Home', 'nostalgic', 'affectionate', 'look', 'Carson', 'return', 'hometown', 'Norfolk', 'Nebraska', 'Loaded', 'extras', 'recently', 'discovered', 'film', 'clips', 'early', '1960s', 'DVD', 'collection', 'first-rate', 'material', 'reasonable', 'price', 'set', 'wanting', 'more', 'six-DVD', 'Timeless', 'Moments', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show 1962-1992  VHS
706431,AHD101501WCN1,B000068WS6,"Shalom Freedman ""Shalom Freedman""","[11, 19]","Sometimes I start to review a certain item, and caution myself against it. Why? Because I know that there are other people who care about the book, movie, music, television show,  in question in a way I do not. They are passionate about it. They know it from inside. Consider the excellent review of J. Grabowski of the 'The Ultimate Carson Collection' on this Amazon site. It is outstanding, and cannot be matched by anything I, a very occasional watcher of Carson through the years, can say.Nonetheless I'll just do what I often do in these reviews, simply write what I think. I watched Carson in and out, occasionally for many years. I never became addicted to it like some people I know. These were the ones who simply had to watch the 'Tonight' show every night. My guess is America had millions of these.I think for most of the years I underappreciated Carson. I thought of him as kind of corny.And as I am not a special fan of what might be called 'physical humor ' I just did not care for some of the stuff. Also the various tics and repetitions, the whole hokum which goes with these shows, the various chitchat with Ed and Doc never really got me.In latter years though I thought of the matter again, and became a bit nostalgic watching the show. He was quick- minded certainly and fast he had something else I really liked, great curiosity. He would bring someone like Carl Sagan on the show because he wanted to understand the stuff Sagan was talking about. He of course kidded and made fun of many guests but he did it without depriving them of their dignity. He gave them a chance , as far as I could tell, to get on whatever they wanted to say or promote.Moreover he stuck it out for a long time. And what happens is when someone becomes familiar, even if you don't particularly like them at first , they sort of grow on you, and you get to feel you know them, and sort of like them. Old Johnny was like that.When you think of it really , all these people who were so young once and so full in life, and who it seemed would last forever, and you understand that they are old or most likely, dead, it makes you kind of sad.It's funny. The twentieth century invented this business of film and now you can see people actually acting, speaking moving as if they were alive. It's uncanny really. There is Johnny out there young as ever when you know he's somewhere else six - feet under. It's strange and it makes you sad.This man probably entertained more Americans than any other person in history. Got more laughs. Made more people smile when they went to bed.He deserves a lot of credit and recognition for that. And he certainly got it in buckets in his lifetime.This does not however stop him from being , I guess what he always was, a kind of lonely quirky guy all troubled in himself.Thank you Johnny.

706437,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B000068WS6,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[29, 33]","In a free-association test, if you said ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" I think most people would respond with ""Classy."" Carson's show was always a class act that aimed high rather than low, and there was never a better interviewer than Johnny. Whether the guest was a Hollywood heavyweight or a 10-year-old spelling bee winner, Carson found the right questions, elicited surprising reaction (as opposed to Leno, who is a master only at stating and restating the obvious), and kept audiences laughing. Yet, like everyone else who was born to do what they do, he made it look effortless. And apparently for him it was. Carson was famous for arriving at the studio very late and doing little in the form of rehearsals. But who could knock what worked?Carson was an enigma. He wanted to entertain crowds, yet he was reclusive, with few close relationships. He was charming yet distant. He could be petulant, but also a gentleman. He had a midwest ""aw-shucks"" personality coupled with an ego the size of Manhattan. He was known around NBC for being difficult as well as lazy--after the 1970s, he took off two nights a week, turning over Monday's show to a string of guest hosts and running repeats on Tuesdays. Yet he could get away with it, because he delivered the goods. All other late night entertainers were also-rans, and the list of performers who sank trying to take his crown is long and varied.When you watch these DVDs, you realize how class and civility in the land of television has all but disappeared. And how much humor has been dumbed down. Not that Carson invited all Nobel Laureates to his show, but compared to Leno's guests--and Leno himself--they seem just about that! It's instructive to see, in one of the bonus features on this DVD set, a shot of the audience on his last show. They were much older than the audience that comes to a Leno taping. The emphasis has shifted to teens and early college-students, and boy does it show. As Homer Simpson once observed in a different context, Is there no place for a man with a 105 IQ?The three discs contain much material from Carson's three decades on the air, but honestly, not enough, and that's one reason why I'm only giving it four stars. While the stuff is excellent, each disc is only filled to about half-capacity. Also, some of the extras are a little lame. For example, we're promised a gallery of magazine covers and the ""More To Come"" artwork. We don't get many of either (there were probably thousands of the ""More To Come"" graphics made over the years) and they're displayed very small on the screen--and I'm watching on a 46"" TV. I can only imagine what you see on a more modest television set. There's no reason these items can't take up the full screen. Also, some of the behind-the-scenes features look like they were cut down from longer features. Why not just use the longer features?But the material that's there is terrific. Guests include Elizabeth Taylor, Flip Wilson, Richard Pryor, Dean Martin, Eva Gabor, Steve Martin, Alan King, David Letterman, George Carlin, Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, Albert Brooks, Tiny Tim, Pearl Bailey, Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton, and so many others, too numerous to mention. There's even a young, curly-haired Jay Leno, wearing a green suit that has to be seen to be believed. But the best guests are the animals. I don't know if Carson was the first to book animal acts, but no one interacted with the creatures better. Particularly noteworthy is a bird that can imitate other animals, and seems to actually understand Carson and answer his questions. This sort of material is far more entertaining than the beach-and-bikini-type antics that Jay Leno seems to uncover in skits such as ""Jaywalking.""Let's not leave out Carson's supporting cast. McMahon seemingly did little more than announce the opening with a burly voice and laugh like a drunken Santa Claus at Johnny's jokes, yet he was still lightyears more effective in his job than Leno's John Melendez or Edd Hall. But it's Doc Severson's swinging, zinging Tonight Show Band that really gave the show its signature. The catchy theme (penned by Paul Anka and Carson himself) was a guarantee for 30 years that you were about to have a good time, and honestly it still gets me excited to hear it. And some of that bridge music during commercials was so good that you almost wanted them to continue playing for the next ten minutes. Compare this to the awful Kevin Eubanks band and the shrill screams of the frizzy-haired vocalist Vicky behind him, on today's Tonight Show. And who can even *hum* the current Tonight Show theme? Think it will ever become the icon that Johnny's Daa-da-daa-duuum-duum is?The first two discs are highlights from the 60s through the 90s. As I said, they could have been a lot longer: despite a fire in the NBC vaults that destroyed most of the early 60s material (including, sadly, the pilot show), there's still enough Carson episodes to fill a hundred DVDs. But what's there is a real treasure, and a master class for aspiring comedians. There's also a faded print of Carson's only prime-time special, wherein he returns to his home town in Nebraska. It's interesting, but not essential. Another extra is called ""Danger Johnny"" and consists of footage of stunts Carson performed for another show he hosted prior to The Tonight Show. It's mildy entertaining, but most Tonight Show fans probably won't care much. The last disc contains, complete, the final two shows--the last with guests (Robin Williams and Bette Midler in a now-famous performance saluting Carson) and finally the big goodbye, with Johnny alone on a stool. I saw them both back in 1992 and they are still a blast.Once again, I seem to be stuck in the rut of saying things aren't as good as they used to be. (See most of my other reviews!)  But watch these DVDs and you'll see how true it is. I realize this is a ""best of"" compilation and so it's going to have the cream. Still, Leno's been on the air more than 13 years now, and as far as I've seen he hasn't had one moment as good as any of those here. The other late night hosts--even Letterman--seem to be just weird for the sake of being weird, and don't really seem interested in their guests. No, there was only one Johnny Carson, and once he was gone, there was nothing left for any of his ""heirs"" to do.",4,The once and future king of late night,1150675200,"06 19,
