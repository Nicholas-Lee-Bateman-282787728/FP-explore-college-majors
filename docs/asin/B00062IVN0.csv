856904,AXJTNYD3UK1BP,B00062IVN0,"1smileycat ""1smileycat""","[3, 3]","Sleepover is a great movie for young teen girls, especially if they are having a sleepover! I have 5 & 6 year old girls and they found it entertaining as well - tho they didn't understand a lot of it.This is a movie about Julie (Alex Vega), a Junior High student entering the summer before her Freshman year of High School.  Julie is dealing with the reality that her best friend is moving away and she will face High School without her.  A sleepover is planned at Julie's house for Julie, Hannah (Mika Boorem), Gabby (Jane Lynch) and Stacie (Sara Paxton), however Stacie is now part of the ""in"" crowd and cannot make it to the sleepover due to a dance she will be attending with her older boyfriend.  As Stacie disses Yancy (Kalie Flynn Childress) in front of the rest of the girls, Julie hands Stacie's invitation to the slumber party to Yancy.Stacie ends up not attending the dance and decides it would be fun to plan a scavenger hunt. Stacie teams with a group of ""popular"" girls (and a driving permit) against Julie & the gang. Winner takes all! (The best seats for lunch next year at school! - the seats NOT next to the garbage dumpsters!)  Without a permit or a vehicle it seems a cinch that Stacie and her friends will win, but wait! Yancy has a plan!This is a cute movie full of exciting twists & turns during the scavenger hunt - especially since the girls were not to leave the house! There is also a ""first crush"" love story here.Cute movie!

In hopes of shedding their not-so-cool reputations during the summer before their freshman year, best friends Julie (Alexa Vega), Hannah (Mika Boorem), Yancy (Kalli Flynn Childress), and Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) decide to host the sleepover of their lives. Far from a mere pillow-fight-laden girl talk-fest, this sleepover includes an intense scavenger hunt against the most simultaneously loathed and envied young women they know: the infamous ""popular"" clique.

856908,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00062IVN0,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I admit, I enjoy my fair share of pre-teen or teen movie fluff, and some of them turn out to be far better than I could have hoped for.  To say that `Sleepover' isn't entertaining would be a lie, of sorts, but to say that it deserves the right to entertain you is another thing.  In fact, looking over `Sleepover' and trying to find reasons to applaud this movie was one of the most difficult tasks of my weekend.I think I found ONE.I'll start with that `reason'.  Kallie Flynn Childress.  As the overweight yet big-hearted Yancy, Childress proves to be the only actress here actually delivering a believably acted character.  You understand and relate to and simply adore her.  Her sub-plot is sweet (even if it is overloaded with clich&eacute;s and improbabilities) and she is basically the only thing you will want to remember about this movie.Sadly, that is about all in the `positive' department.The concept behind this film is ridiculously thrown together.  The whole `girl gets dumped by guy so decides to humiliate her ex-friends by throwing together a scavenger hunt' is so unbelievable it made me roll my eyes.  The writers here didn't even TRY to make this work.  They probably just figured that a bunch of pre-teen girls wouldn't care if the film made any sense whatsoever, they'd watch it anyways.  The acting by everyone outside of Childress is also an issue.  I think that Sara Paxton is one of the worst young actresses TRYING to make it out there, and this is no exception.  Mika Boorem (who looks far too much like someone else) has spunk, but she doesn't no how to make it work for her.  She comes off manufactured.  Alexa Vega is rather boring, Steve Carell is generic slapstick and Sam Huntington looks like he desperately wants to be Nicolas Cage, and that is NOT a good thing.  Then you have Evan Peters who is just down right obnoxious to the point where it is nearly painful to watch him act.Another issue that I have with this movie is that it makes appear fun things that I would NEVER want my daughter to ever find herself involved in, and it makes it seem `okay'.  The fact that one of the things on their `list' is to get a date from a website to buy them a drink at a nightclub is awful, and the fact that the mother finds out they were there and doesn't take any action (showing that she condones it) is ridiculous.  YOUR DAUGHTER IS FOURTEEN!  Stealing a boy's underwear (and the way that she does it) is all stuff that is not harmless fun, it is bordering on dangerous.  In fact, this is a major issue with me.  It would be different if the film gave some sort of consequence for their actions, but everything is presented as a `good time'.I'm not sure why I'm giving this a D.  Maybe it's because I was slightly amused with the film.  Like I said, it's entertaining (what film of this nature isn't at least slightly entertaining), but it doesn't deserve to be seen.  It lacks a lot of everything needed to be considered a good film.",2,Don't spend the night with this one...,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2967,"['admit', 'enjoy', 'fair', 'share', 'pre-teen', 'teen', 'movie', 'fluff', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'say', 'Sleepover', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'would', 'be', 'lie', 'sorts', 'say', 'right', 'entertain', 'thing', 'fact', 'looking', 'Sleepover', 'trying', 'find', 'reasons', 'applaud', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'weekend.I', 'think', 'found', 'ONE.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'reason', 'Kallie', 'Flynn', 'Childress', 'overweight', 'yet', 'big-hearted', 'Yancy', 'Childress', 'be', 'only', 'actress', 'here', 'actually', 'delivering', 'believably', 'acted', 'character', 'understand', 'relate', 'simply', 'adore', 'sub-plot', 'sweet', 'even', 'overloaded', 'clich', 'eacute', 'improbabilities', 'basically', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'want', 'remember', 'movie.Sadly', 'positive', 'department.The', 'concept', 'film', 'ridiculously', 'thrown', 'together', 'whole', 'girl', 'dumped', 'guy', 'so', 'humiliate', 'ex-friends', 'throwing', 'together', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'made', 'roll', 'eyes', 'writers', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'TRY', 'make', 'work', 'probably', 'just', 'figured', 'bunch', 'pre-teen', 'girls', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'made', 'sense', 'whatsoever', ""'d"", 'watch', 'acting', 'everyone', 'Childress', 'also', 'issue', 'think', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'one', 'worst', 'young', 'actresses', 'TRYING', 'make', 'there', 'exception', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'someone', 'else', 'spunk', ""n't"", 'no', 'how', 'make', 'work', 'off', 'manufactured', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'rather', 'boring', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'generic', 'slapstick', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'desperately', 'be', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'NOT', 'good', 'thing', 'Then', 'have', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'who', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'obnoxious', 'point', 'where', 'nearly', 'painful', 'watch', 'act.Another', 'issue', 'have', 'movie', 'appear', 'fun', 'things', 'would', 'NEVER', 'want', 'daughter', 'ever', 'find', 'involved', 'seem', 'okay', 'fact', 'one', 'things', 'list', 'get', 'date', 'website', 'buy', 'drink', 'nightclub', 'awful', 'fact', 'mother', 'out', 'were', 'there', ""n't"", 'take', 'action', 'showing', 'ridiculous', 'DAUGHTER', 'FOURTEEN', 'Stealing', 'boy', 'underwear', 'way', 'stuff', 'not', 'harmless', 'fun', 'bordering', 'dangerous', 'fact', 'major', 'issue', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'film', 'gave', 'sort', 'consequence', 'actions', 'everything', 'presented', 'good', ""time'.I"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'D.', 'Maybe', 'was', 'slightly', 'amused', 'film', 'said', 'entertaining', 'what', 'film', 'nature', ""n't"", 'least', 'slightly', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'seen', 'lot', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'film']",N/A

I was extremely surprised. I laughed so hard at the mannequin scene (you'll know why when you see it). Also, there was a reviewer on here that commented on several points of the movie. One of them was talking about Julie's friend Hannah moving to Vancouver and said the following:Quote:""...at the end, we find out that Julie's best friend is moving. No prior mention of this, just a ""I have to go home and pack"" ""So you're really moving"" exchange.""Just to let you know (since you obviously weren't paying that much attention, the very first line of the movie is from Julie saying: ""I can't believe you're moving.

856926,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B00062IVN0,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[8, 11]","I was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star. Someone even accused them of not being young at heart. Well, I don't like this film, and I'm young at heart; I'm just not immature, so try not to confuse the two. Some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing. Having said that, on to the film:Julie and friends are simply DYING to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school, so on the night Julie has a sleepover, they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a ""scavenger"" hunt, which is basically one huge dare game. The group that fulfills the dares first gets to be popular by... (drumroll, please) sitting at The Popular Lunch Spot. That is, a picnic bench by the school fountain. That's right; popularity is not guaranteed by WHO you sit with, but WHERE you sit. Pick the right spot, and you may just magically become Queen Bee for the rest of the year. In case you couldn't tell by my sarcasm, the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times. We all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks, but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it. Granted, a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film; in fact, the movie's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips. However, there is such a thing as going too far.The movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like...well, the dumbest, scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet. Not that all the boys are like this, mind you; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for. It got worse, however, when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes. If the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time, it might've worked. Instead,the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction. For example, there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten Julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says, ""Julie, I KNOW you can do this; I believe in you"" in a tone which implies that they're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game.The worst ""serious"" scene, however, is when Julie attempts to get into a dance (therefore fulfilling the final dare) and the ticket seller won't let her in because she doesn't have a ticket. Suddenly inspired, Julie gives the ticket seller a sickening ""I know who you are"" speech, telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now, because of her former nerdiness, she's become a poor ticket seller. Julie ends her speech by wailing, ""I can see myself being you in four years if I don't go to this dance!""  The ticket seller leaps to her feet but, instead of punching Julie, suddenly breaks into a smile and says, ""Go ahead and go in!"" Um, WHAT?? Whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity isn't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans? (Not to mention that nice sock in the mouth I was hoping Julie would get). Is this what we want to teach our kids, that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life? I personally think the ""nerds"" are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything. It was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion. I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message. Maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange. I recommend ""Never been Kissed"" and ""Mean Girls"" far more than this film; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor.Oh, before I finish, here's one more valuable lesson from this film: Girls, if you want to win a guy who's never noticed you, all you have to do is strike a cool pose, hop on a skateboard, and ride it directly in front of his car. (Don't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you're at it). Do this, and he will be so in love with you that he won't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear.

856927,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00062IVN0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[29, 32]","""Sleepover"" is a four star flick--if you're thirteen.  I'm not saying that it's a bad film, it's just very, very demographically targeted at a specific audience.  The producers knew exactly what they were doing when they green-lighted this project.  It stars ""Spy Kids"" alum Alexa Vega, and ""Darcy's Wild Life"" and ""Aquamarine"" star Sara Paxton.  It also features Sam Huntington (""Jungle 2 Jungle,"" ""Superman Returns""), and pre-teen starlets Kallie Flynn Childress, Mika Boorem, and Scout Taylor-Compton.  The adult cast features a pre-""40 Year Old Virgin"" Steve Carell, fellow ""Virgin"" star Jane Lynch and ""Daddy Day Care"" star Jeff Garlin.The plot revolves around a, you guessed it, sleepover, in which a jilted Paxton decides to gang up with her friends to challenge Vega and her brood to a scavenger hunt.  The prize in the balance is to either sit at the fountain during lunch or near the trash bins.  Sophomoric, I know, but it works perfectly in this little comedy.  The tasks in the hunt range from swiping a tag off of a rent-a-cop car to ""borrowing"" a pair of underwear from the apple of Vega's eye.From there, the story becomes pretty formulaic.  The girls go from one task to another and achieve them with pre-teen humor in full force.  Carell fails horribly in his attempt to catch the girls in the act.  It all plays out like an expanded episode of ""Full House"" where D.J. and her pal Kimmy get into typical pre-teen sitcom trouble.  In the end it works as a pre-teen story, but most people older than fifteen will probably not care to watch it more than once.Although it's a pretty good flick, I'd only consider buying it when my daughter hits the age of ten or eleven.  Even then, however, this movie would probably only warrant a four year shelf life before my daughter grew tired with it.  It's perfect for sleepovers, and coupled with Paxton's ""Aquamarine"" (which is actually pretty good), it's a guaranteed good time for young girls.",3,"Silly, Pre-teen Fun",1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,1953,"['Sleepover', 'four', 'star', 'flick', ""'re"", 'thirteen', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'demographically', 'targeted', 'specific', 'audience', 'producers', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'green-lighted', 'project', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'alum', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'Darcy', 'Wild', 'Life', 'Aquamarine', 'star', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'also', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Jungle', '2', 'Jungle', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'pre-teen', 'starlets', 'Kallie', 'Flynn', 'Childress', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'adult', 'cast', 'pre-', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'fellow', 'Virgin', 'star', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Daddy', 'Day', 'Care', 'star', 'Jeff', 'Garlin.The', 'plot', 'guessed', 'sleepover', 'jilted', 'Paxton', 'gang', 'up', 'friends', 'challenge', 'Vega', 'brood', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'prize', 'balance', 'sit', 'fountain', 'lunch', 'trash', 'bins', 'Sophomoric', 'know', 'perfectly', 'little', 'comedy', 'tasks', 'hunt', 'range', 'swiping', 'tag', 'rent-a-cop', 'car', 'borrowing', 'pair', 'underwear', 'apple', 'Vega', 'eye.From', 'there', 'story', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'girls', 'go', 'one', 'task', 'achieve', 'pre-teen', 'humor', 'full', 'force', 'Carell', 'horribly', 'attempt', 'catch', 'girls', 'act', 'out', 'expanded', 'episode', 'Full', 'House', 'where', 'D.J', 'pal', 'Kimmy', 'get', 'typical', 'pre-teen', 'sitcom', 'trouble', 'end', 'pre-teen', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'older', 'fifteen', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'care', 'watch', 'more', 'pretty', 'good', 'flick', ""'d"", 'only', 'consider', 'buying', 'when', 'daughter', 'age', 'ten', 'eleven', 'Even', 'then', 'however', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'only', 'warrant', 'four', 'year', 'shelf', 'life', 'daughter', 'grew', 'tired', 'perfect', 'sleepovers', 'coupled', 'Paxton', 'Aquamarine', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'guaranteed', 'good', 'time', 'young', 'girls']",N/A
856928,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00062IVN0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","When I watched ""Mean Girls"" I could not help but think juniors in high school have nothing on girls in junior high. Surviving eighth grade is the hard part for teenage girls, but at that age you still have to be driven by somebody to the movie theater, so Hollywood continues to aim for older adolescents. ""Sleepover"" is about junior high girls, although on the final day of junior high, as they are about to become freshmen. But while we once again have the clash between the girls who rule the school and those who aspire to such lofty positions, this is a film that emphasizes ""cute"" over ""cruel.""Julie (Alexa Vega) is having a sleepover not only because it is the last day of school but also because her best friend Hannah (Mika Boorem) is moving away. Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) is coming as well, but Julie's former best friend Stacie (Sara Paxton), has moved on to be Queen Bee of the snooty girls and will not be attending. When Stacie and her pack of brats insult Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress), Julie invites her to be the fourth. Stacie has a date to go to the high school dance with the second string quarterback in his sports car, but he is more interested in parking than in dancing, so Stacie decides it would be more worthwhile to crash Julie's sleepover and challenge the girls to a scavenger hunt. This will require Julie and her friends to break the rules laid down by her mom, Gabby (Jane Lynch), because they will have to leave the house. But at stake is the prime seating place for eating lunch in high school, and there is also a good-looking boy.Now, if the most high and mighty junior high girls on the face of the Earth think they are going to get to sit in the best place at lunch in high school, then they have a rude awakening in store for them. But the idea of a privileged place is certainly going to resonate with young viewers (although an outdoor lunchroom is not really a part of our culture) and ""Sleepover"" is clearly intended as an adolescent fantasy. How else do you explain the interest of high school boys in under-aged girls (who manage to get into dance clubs) or why there are kings and queens named at end of the school year dances (or why anyone other than a senior would get the crown).Ultimately, ""Sleepover"" is above Julie and her friends getting a boost of adolescent self-confidence that will allow them to survive the horrors of high school. Julie has an advantage in that Hannah is there to give her a push. Hannah has her act together in a way that Stacie and the others never will; you get the feeling Hannah could be Queen Bee but that the role never goes to anyone who would be a benevolent leader. Your tolerance for this film will have to do entirely with your ability to enjoy all the cuteness. But subtlety is often lost in such adolescent fare (and there is an unexpected ""nude"" scene), and if other films directed at the 'tween audience could follow in the wake of this one that would be a good thing. The problem of course is by the time a film like this gets made and ends up on DVD a leading girl like Vega is already beyond the 'tween stage and in danger of becoming another yet Lindsay Lohan or Hillary Duff and the vicious circle continues in terms of teenage movies. But hopefully the success of this film will engender more to follow, even if a new crop of young stars will need to be found for each one.My biggest complaint with ""Sleepover"" is actually about the end credits. This is where we get to see photographs of the cast with their names. We get Alex Vega (Julie), Mika Boorem (Hannah), Jane Lynch (Gabby), Sam Huntington (Ron), the trio of Sara Paxton (Staci), Brie Larson (Liz), and Scout Taylor-Compton (Farrah), the duo of Douglas Smith (Gregg) and Katija Pevec (Molly), with Steve (Sherman) and Jeff Garlin (Jay). Left out are Kalie Flynn Childress as Yancy, who had more to do than the Stacie or Liz characters, Russell (Evan Peters) who had way more to do that Gregg, and Sean Faris as Steve, the boy toy in the bottom of the box is even further down. Here is this above average juvenile cast in a nice ensemble effort and suddenly at the end what becomes important are what their agents negotiated for their clients rather than what actually happens in the film. At least on the DVD you have a commentary track with director Joe Nussbaum and Vega, Boorem, Taylor-Compton and Childress giggling their way through the film to get you back to thinking happy thoughts about the movie.",4,"""Sleepover"" is ""Mean Girls"" for the 'tween crowd",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,4470,"['When', 'watched', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'juniors', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'nothing', 'girls', 'junior', 'high', 'Surviving', 'eighth', 'grade', 'hard', 'part', 'teenage', 'girls', 'age', 'still', 'have', 'be', 'driven', 'somebody', 'movie', 'theater', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'aim', 'older', 'adolescents', 'Sleepover', 'junior', 'high', 'girls', 'final', 'day', 'junior', 'high', 'are', 'become', 'freshmen', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'clash', 'girls', 'who', 'rule', 'school', 'who', 'aspire', 'such', 'lofty', 'positions', 'film', 'cute', 'cruel', 'Julie', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'having', 'sleepover', 'not', 'only', 'last', 'day', 'school', 'also', 'best', 'friend', 'Hannah', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'moving', 'away', 'Farrah', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'coming', 'as', 'well', 'Julie', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Stacie', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'moved', 'be', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'snooty', 'girls', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'attending', 'When', 'Stacie', 'pack', 'brats', 'insult', 'Yancy', 'Kallie', 'Flynn', 'Childress', 'Julie', 'be', 'fourth', 'Stacie', 'date', 'go', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'second', 'string', 'quarterback', 'sports', 'car', 'more', 'interested', 'parking', 'dancing', 'so', 'Stacie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'crash', 'Julie', 'sleepover', 'challenge', 'girls', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'will', 'require', 'Julie', 'friends', 'break', 'rules', 'laid', 'down', 'mom', 'Gabby', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'will', 'have', 'leave', 'house', 'stake', 'prime', 'seating', 'place', 'eating', 'lunch', 'high', 'school', 'also', 'good-looking', 'boy.Now', 'most', 'high', 'mighty', 'junior', 'high', 'girls', 'face', 'Earth', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'sit', 'best', 'place', 'lunch', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'have', 'rude', 'awakening', 'store', 'idea', 'privileged', 'place', 'certainly', 'going', 'resonate', 'young', 'viewers', 'outdoor', 'lunchroom', 'not', 'really', 'part', 'culture', 'Sleepover', 'clearly', 'intended', 'adolescent', 'fantasy', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'interest', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'under-aged', 'girls', 'who', 'manage', 'get', 'dance', 'clubs', 'why', 'are', 'kings', 'queens', 'named', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'dances', 'why', 'anyone', 'other', 'senior', 'would', 'get', 'crown', '.Ultimately', 'Sleepover', 'Julie', 'friends', 'getting', 'boost', 'adolescent', 'self-confidence', 'will', 'allow', 'survive', 'horrors', 'high', 'school', 'Julie', 'advantage', 'Hannah', 'there', 'give', 'push', 'Hannah', 'act', 'together', 'way', 'Stacie', 'others', 'never', 'will', 'get', 'feeling', 'Hannah', 'could', 'be', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'role', 'never', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'benevolent', 'leader', 'tolerance', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'entirely', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'cuteness', 'subtlety', 'often', 'lost', 'such', 'adolescent', 'fare', 'unexpected', 'nude', 'scene', 'other', 'films', 'directed', ""'tween"", 'audience', 'could', 'follow', 'wake', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'problem', 'course', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'up', 'DVD', 'leading', 'girl', 'Vega', 'already', ""'tween"", 'stage', 'danger', 'becoming', 'yet', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'vicious', 'circle', 'terms', 'teenage', 'movies', 'hopefully', 'success', 'film', 'will', 'engender', 'more', 'follow', 'even', 'new', 'crop', 'young', 'stars', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'found', 'one.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Sleepover', 'actually', 'end', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'photographs', 'cast', 'names', 'get', 'Alex', 'Vega', 'Julie', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'Hannah', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Gabby', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Ron', 'trio', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'Staci', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'Liz', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Farrah', 'duo', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'Gregg', 'Katija', 'Pevec', 'Molly', 'Steve', 'Sherman', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'Jay', 'Left', 'out', 'are', 'Kalie', 'Flynn', 'Childress', 'Yancy', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'Stacie', 'Liz', 'characters', 'Russell', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'who', 'had', 'way', 'more', 'do', 'Gregg', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'Steve', 'boy', 'toy', 'bottom', 'box', 'even', 'further', 'down', 'Here', 'above', 'average', 'juvenile', 'cast', 'nice', 'ensemble', 'effort', 'suddenly', 'end', 'what', 'important', 'are', 'what', 'agents', 'negotiated', 'clients', 'rather', 'what', 'actually', 'film', 'least', 'DVD', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Joe', 'Nussbaum', 'Vega', 'Boorem', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Childress', 'giggling', 'way', 'film', 'get', 'back', 'thinking', 'happy', 'thoughts', 'movie']",N/A

Lively and funny, it brings back all the memories for us now beyond adolescence and gives the present day teenagers a chance to see that many are facing the same problems they are. Having a friend move away, crushes and unrequited love, being unaccepted, confused, invisible, chubby, feeling unattractive and yes, finding love in spite of it all.
