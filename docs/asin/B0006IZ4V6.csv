870030,A3DG93E8TXMKZF,B0006IZ4V6,"BytemanProofreader at Gmail ""JohnnyWill""","[0, 0]","At first, when I saw that Amazon had &#34;THE MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (2005)&#34; listed for the title of this item, I thought it was a 2005 adaptation. Even when I saw that it was in black and white, I was, at first, thinking that they had taken the original 1947 movie and done voiceovers and actor changes for some parts.By the time I did my research, I realized that Amazon needs to put the proper year next to the title,THE MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1955)This is the &#34;Hour of Stars&#34; show for December 14, 1955.In many ways, it seems more logical than the 1947 movie it is adapting. It never seemed logical to me that Doris would mail Susan's letter to the courthouse as she did in the 1947 movie. It makes more sense that she would be someone to think to call the post office and give them the idea about delivering all the mail.I didn't know this version even existed until I saw it in the &#34;Prime Eligible&#34; section. I'm glad I watched it, and I will watch it again, along with the other versions that I can get ahold of each season.If I were to compare this version to the 1947 version, I'm not sure which one I'd give 5.0 starts to, and which one I'd give 4.9 stars to. But both numbers round to 5.I highly recommend both 1947 and 1955 versions.",5,Amazon's title is confusing but the 1950's TV adaptation is better than I thought,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1265,"['first', 'when', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'had', '34', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'ON', '34TH', 'STREET', '2005', '34', 'listed', 'title', 'item', 'thought', 'was', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Even', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'first', 'thinking', 'had', 'taken', 'original', '1947', 'movie', 'done', 'voiceovers', 'actor', 'changes', 'parts.By', 'time', 'did', 'research', 'realized', 'Amazon', 'put', 'proper', 'year', 'title', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'ON', '34TH', 'STREET', '1955', '34', 'Hour', 'Stars', '34', 'show', 'December', '14', '1955.In', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'logical', '1947', 'movie', 'adapting', 'never', 'seemed', 'logical', 'Doris', 'would', 'mail', 'Susan', 'letter', 'courthouse', 'did', '1947', 'movie', 'more', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'think', 'call', 'post', 'office', 'give', 'idea', 'delivering', 'mail.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'version', 'even', 'existed', 'saw', '34', 'Prime', 'Eligible', '34', 'section', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'other', 'versions', 'can', 'get', 'ahold', 'season.If', 'were', 'compare', 'version', '1947', 'version', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', ""'d"", 'give', '5.0', 'starts', 'one', ""'d"", 'give', '4.9', 'stars', 'numbers', 'round', '5.I', 'highly', 'recommend', '1947', '1955', 'versions']",N/A

870037,A11ATJK36KXJS6,B0006IZ4V6,M. Miller,"[5, 10]","If I could have I would have rated this -10! This movie is a disaster and what makes it so is the acting. Its amateur and thats putting it as nicely as possible. Its as if they're all reading straight off the cue cards with no expressions on their faces or inflection or emotion in their voices. I despise the '94 remake but this version makes the '94 film seem Oscar worthy. Now I hate when people imply sinister things that aren't really there in a film thats wholesome fare, but there's something about the way this Santa interacts with Susan, it comes off creepy. Made me uncomfortable watching their scenes together. And his portrayal of Santa didn't help matters, his performance was awkward at best. He had this wild look in his eyes throughout the whole film, that really did make him look like he should be committed. And when he hit Mr. Sawyer, it was not the innocent ""V8 bop"" Gwenn gives in the '47 version, instead he literally clubs him, rather viciously in fact, and in front of the children and their parents, then after stands there with this evil grin on his face -  making the viewer hardly sympathetic to his plight. Also, the whole plot that involved Mr. Sawyer giving a speech about the non-existence of Santa at Susans school, where the incident I just mentioned took place, was beyond contrived. What kind of school would hold an assembly for the purpose of ruining the fantasy idol of grade school children?? I understand that this is fiction, but there still has to be a basis in reality somewhere. The scene I just described was one of many deviations from the original movie. Another that didn't sit well was that Doris only finds Kris after he applies for the job as Santa instead of stumbling upon him at the actual parade....I think that sort of took some ""magic"" out of the tale. It just seemed the lightheartedness, innocence, sentiment and charm captured by the 1947 original was completely lacking in this. It was wholly miscast and poorly acted and it completely missed its mark. They should have just aired the original movie back in 1955 and made an annual tradition of it similar to what they did with 'The Wizard of Oz' and maybe the original 'Miracle' would be just as beloved.

I found this version to be quite enjoyable, not as good as the Edmond Gwenn version, no one plays Santa like Gwenn, but this was a neat little trip back in time when TV put on their own abbreviated version of classic movies.  Lux Radio Theater in the days of radio put on their radio audio version of classic movies and in the '50's when TV came along Lux continued in the new medium with hour long versions made for TV of movies.
