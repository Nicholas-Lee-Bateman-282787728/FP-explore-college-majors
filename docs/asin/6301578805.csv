256273,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301578805,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","There are two film stars who shine brightly in the pantheon of those whose lives were tragically cut short just at the cusp of iconic movie greatness...James Dean and Sal Mineo. Yet there is a third who by rights should join them. This actor made but one film, yet his ability to project bravery, loyalty, compassion and the boisterous joy of living through his acting was, many believe, without parallel. He died at the height of his fame, a mere three years after his triumphant success in this film. Let there now be three stars in that tragic but noble pantheon...Dean, Mineo and Beasley. And let it be recognized, without envy or jealousy, that Beasley's ability to project drool was far greater and more accurate than Dean and Mineo combined.Turner & Hooch is a low key, modest comedy crime caper with a heavy dose of light romance thrown in. Tom Hanks plays Detective Scott Turner, a young man who is far too neat for his own good. He's about to transfer from his small town of Cypress Beach to the big city when a friend, an old man played by that great character actor John McIntire, is murdered. Turner delays his move and pleads with his police chief to be given the case. He's sure the old man's dog, a big, slobbering French Mastiff named Hooch (Beasley) saw what happened and can help identify the killer. Turner agrees to have Hooch live with him while he's on the case. Not to cut the plot to short, Turner and Hooch solve the case, but not without wild car chases, tense shoot-outs, money laundering, veterinary examinations, furniture chewing, refrigerator raiding and a lot of slobber.The movie's plot, of course, is just an excuse to allow two actors with great likability to do their stuff. Hanks had by now already proven how skilled a light comedy actor he was. More to the point, he had the sort of personality and slightly goofy looks that created instant empathy with an audience. Beasley, however, was the surprise. A novice actor, he was an unknown without even off-Broadway experience. He carried out his role with the skill and subtlety of a pro. Just as some actors can cause real tears to run down their faces at the command of a director, Beasley was uncanny in his ability to generate, as needed, drool. His resourcefulness also has become legend. In one scene, the sight of Hanks prancing around his apartment wearing a pair of tighty-whities (black ones) threatened to derail Hollywood's gay fashion industry. Fortunately, Beasley suggested quietly to the director that some amusing antics on his part might distract the audience from the odd awfulness of Hank's appearance. He was right. Yet the scene where Hanks and Beasley are on the pier and Scott Turner must wrestle Hooch to the police car is a fine example of ensemble acting by two talented and unselfish actors, each totally into their characters and yet giving fully to the other.At the end of the movie the murder has been solved, the mastermind unmasked and young Turner has become chief of police. He has a wife, the veterinarian Dr. Emily Carson (played winningly by Mare Winningham). They have a baby on the way. They will remember Hooch in many ways, and so will Emily's collie.I like Turner & Hooch a lot. It's pleasant entertainment with two likeable and skilled actors and a story that hangs together. Wherever in that pantheon they reside, I'm sure Dean and Mineo are working with Beasley, now all of them close friends, to perfect slobber on command. The DVD transfer looks just fine. There are no extras.",4,"Hanks is first-rate, but he can't match the slobber production of Beasley, his co-star",1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,3513,"['are', 'two', 'film', 'stars', 'who', 'shine', 'brightly', 'pantheon', 'lives', 'were', 'tragically', 'cut', 'short', 'just', 'cusp', 'iconic', 'movie', 'greatness', 'James', 'Dean', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'third', 'who', 'rights', 'should', 'join', 'actor', 'made', 'one', 'film', 'yet', 'ability', 'project', 'bravery', 'loyalty', 'compassion', 'boisterous', 'joy', 'living', 'acting', 'was', 'many', 'believe', 'parallel', 'died', 'height', 'fame', 'mere', 'three', 'years', 'triumphant', 'success', 'film', 'Let', 'now', 'be', 'three', 'stars', 'tragic', 'noble', 'pantheon', 'Dean', 'Mineo', 'Beasley', 'let', 'be', 'recognized', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'Beasley', 'ability', 'project', 'drool', 'was', 'far', 'greater', 'more', 'accurate', 'Dean', 'Mineo', 'combined.Turner', 'Hooch', 'low', 'key', 'modest', 'comedy', 'crime', 'caper', 'heavy', 'dose', 'light', 'romance', 'thrown', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Detective', 'Scott', 'Turner', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'neat', 'own', 'good', 'transfer', 'small', 'town', 'Cypress', 'Beach', 'big', 'city', 'when', 'friend', 'old', 'man', 'played', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'John', 'McIntire', 'murdered', 'Turner', 'move', 'pleads', 'police', 'chief', 'be', 'given', 'case', 'sure', 'old', 'man', 'dog', 'big', 'slobbering', 'French', 'Mastiff', 'named', 'Hooch', 'Beasley', 'saw', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'help', 'identify', 'killer', 'Turner', 'have', 'Hooch', 'live', 'case', 'Not', 'cut', 'plot', 'short', 'Turner', 'Hooch', 'solve', 'case', 'not', 'wild', 'car', 'chases', 'tense', 'shoot-outs', 'money', 'laundering', 'veterinary', 'examinations', 'furniture', 'chewing', 'refrigerator', 'raiding', 'lot', 'slobber.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'course', 'just', 'excuse', 'allow', 'two', 'actors', 'great', 'likability', 'do', 'stuff', 'Hanks', 'had', 'now', 'already', 'proven', 'how', 'skilled', 'light', 'comedy', 'actor', 'was', 'More', 'point', 'had', 'sort', 'personality', 'slightly', 'goofy', 'looks', 'created', 'instant', 'empathy', 'audience', 'Beasley', 'however', 'was', 'surprise', 'novice', 'actor', 'was', 'unknown', 'even', 'off-Broadway', 'experience', 'carried', 'out', 'role', 'skill', 'subtlety', 'pro', 'Just', 'actors', 'can', 'cause', 'real', 'tears', 'run', 'down', 'command', 'director', 'Beasley', 'was', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'generate', 'needed', 'drool', 'resourcefulness', 'also', 'become', 'legend', 'one', 'scene', 'sight', 'Hanks', 'prancing', 'apartment', 'wearing', 'pair', 'tighty-whities', 'black', 'ones', 'threatened', 'derail', 'Hollywood', 'gay', 'fashion', 'industry', 'Fortunately', 'Beasley', 'suggested', 'quietly', 'director', 'amusing', 'antics', 'part', 'might', 'distract', 'audience', 'odd', 'awfulness', 'Hank', 'appearance', 'was', 'right', 'scene', 'where', 'Hanks', 'Beasley', 'are', 'pier', 'Scott', 'Turner', 'must', 'wrestle', 'Hooch', 'police', 'car', 'fine', 'example', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'two', 'talented', 'unselfish', 'actors', 'totally', 'characters', 'yet', 'giving', 'fully', 'other.At', 'end', 'movie', 'murder', 'been', 'solved', 'mastermind', 'unmasked', 'young', 'Turner', 'become', 'chief', 'police', 'wife', 'veterinarian', 'Dr.', 'Emily', 'Carson', 'played', 'winningly', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'have', 'baby', 'way', 'will', 'remember', 'Hooch', 'many', 'ways', 'so', 'will', 'Emily', 'collie.I', 'Turner', 'Hooch', 'lot', 'pleasant', 'entertainment', 'two', 'likeable', 'skilled', 'actors', 'story', 'together', 'Wherever', 'pantheon', 'reside', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Dean', 'Mineo', 'are', 'working', 'Beasley', 'now', 'close', 'friends', 'perfect', 'slobber', 'command', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'extras']",N/A

Hanks plays Turner, a police detective who is assigned to housesit a bulldog named Hooch after his owner dies. Turner has quite an adventure with his new pooch partner, who aimlessly tears up Turner's apartment upside-down. He even goes one step further by chewing the upholstery in Turner's car! Turner is at his wit's end - so much so that he wants to put Hooch out of his misery! When a verterinarian (Mare Winningham) sees how Turner is treating the animal, she is tempted to report Turner to the SPCA. Craig T. Nelson also stars as Turner's turncoat boss. Reginald VelJohnson stars as Turner's right-hand man, or associate detective. Through it all, Turner & Hooch manage to work things out - albeit roughly, still they manage to bring corrupt evildoers to justice. This movie does have a happy ending, I'm glad to say.

In this case, it happens to be a dog (a very unusual beloved beast).  There are little gems of performances, John McIntire as Amos, who brings the old saw about &quot;people look like their dogs&quot; to life, and Mare Winningham who really shows how powerful a performance understatement can make.  And of course Tom Hanks, who is as always the most charming human being in the world.  He also brings this very flawed person to admirable life. Then Hooch, of course, whose real name is sadly lacking in the list of credits.The screenplay itself is a marvel of simple, unassuming comedy. If we want to get &quot;appreciatin'&quot;, then Hanks' urgently yelled, &quot;I got a muffin for you, Hooch!&quot; is a far more immediate and understandable cry of the everyman than &quot;Reuben!  Reuben!&quot;  And there can be no more perfect cry of human frustration than Hanks imploring Hooch (who has, after eating, sleeping, and going on his nightly &quot;rounds&quot;, continued to howl all night), &quot;What?!  What?!&quot;Hooch's ending is very sad, especially if you have young ones in the house, but the sadness is redeemed by a hopeful ending.  I love this movie.

But sometimes i think i prefer k-9 not that k9 is better, both are great dog comedies, but the dog in k-9 with jim belushi lives at the end. To me, i find the ending to turner and hooch to be devastatingly sad, even though there was a brilliant attempt to make it less sad, and not completely ruined, the scene that was put in at the end when the puppy looked like hooch when we didnt know that camile and hooch mated till that point. But still, it's awful when it shows the dog being shot in the air, it's a little graphic, and to back that up, this film was on tv the other day on tnt, and they had to cut that part out, when it shows the bloody spot on his fur when he is shot. It's a bit much, there is enough violence in movies. I'm fine with people getting killed in films because it is fake, and the animals also getting killed is fake, but still too unbearable for me, and animal lovers. Not that the ending ruined the film, because i can still enjoy the film, and laugh at the parts that were meant to be funny as a distraction from the horrible ending. Also, the way that hooch died. Like k9's do, and any animal that loves his owner, they will risk their own life for you, it's a reminder to the world to treat their dogs/pets/any animal good and humane, because you wouldnt believe how loyal animals are. They would put their lives on the line to save you, just out of love for you, and they dont ask for much in return. What person do you know that you can honestly say that about?? End animal cruelty now, and raise your children right, to respect and be kind to animals who are more capable of extraordinary things than you would realize. They are living breathing beings, and they should be respected and cherished. I cant even watch animal cops on animalplanet, because of how stupid and ignorant people are.
