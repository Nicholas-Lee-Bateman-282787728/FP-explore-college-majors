1420738,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B004NBHVNQ,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[3, 4]","South Riding is a three part serial from a long tradition of period dramas made for TV. However, it stands out from most of its peers as it based on the book of the same name by Winifred Holtby, which is a classic. In the 1930s Sarah returns to her native South Riding of Yorkshire from London, and is interviewed for the job of headteacher at a local girls high school which Ofsted would certainly describe as failing! Despite fundamental differences with some members of the interviewing panel she gets the job.There are two different ways of rating this mini series. Taken in isolation it is absorbing and entertaining and is certainly worth Five Stars, and this is what I have based my rating on. However, there is no way that a book of this complexity can be adequately translated into three hours of TV viewing so of necessity, only some of the major strands can be picked up and to some extent developed in this time period. I would imagine that the previous TV series from the 1970s which ran to 13 parts was much more satisfactory in this respect. Therefore based on a judgement of how well the series reflects the book, we are probably looking at Two Stars.The beauty of the book, which does translate to a large extent into the TV adaptation, is the superb portrayal of the diverse characters within this rural community. Some are major and memorable characters such as Lydia, the brilliant scholar from the shacks (temporary slum housing scheduled for demolition) with a difficult family background who like Sarah is new to the school - when her mother dies she struggles to keep her scholarship place at the school. Another key figure is Robert Carne, who has enormous pressures in his life with a mentally unbalanced wife and a delicate daughter as well as extreme economic difficulties and who develops a rapport with Sarah which initially appears unlikely. There are also a host of minor characters who enrich the community with their complex and varied individual quirks. This is all set against the background of the depressed economy of the 1930s and the strains within the community which this creates.Like most of these TV mini series, this will be better viewed in one go with the boxed set rather than waiting a frustrating week to see the next instalment on TV. Provided you do not watch with too many pre conceived expectations you will thoroughly enjoy it. However, if you are looking for a series which reflects the book it is based on you are going to be sorely disappointed and would probably do best to avoid.",5,Entertaining TV Drama Based on a Classic Book,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,2539,"['South', 'Riding', 'three', 'part', 'serial', 'long', 'tradition', 'period', 'dramas', 'made', 'TV', 'However', 'out', 'most', 'peers', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Winifred', 'Holtby', 'classic', '1930s', 'Sarah', 'returns', 'native', 'South', 'Riding', 'Yorkshire', 'London', 'interviewed', 'job', 'headteacher', 'local', 'girls', 'high', 'school', 'Ofsted', 'would', 'certainly', 'describe', 'failing', 'fundamental', 'differences', 'members', 'interviewing', 'panel', 'job.There', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'ways', 'rating', 'mini', 'series', 'Taken', 'isolation', 'absorbing', 'entertaining', 'certainly', 'worth', 'Five', 'Stars', 'what', 'have', 'based', 'rating', 'However', 'way', 'book', 'complexity', 'can', 'be', 'adequately', 'translated', 'three', 'hours', 'TV', 'viewing', 'so', 'necessity', 'only', 'major', 'strands', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'extent', 'developed', 'time', 'period', 'would', 'imagine', 'previous', 'TV', 'series', '1970s', 'ran', '13', 'parts', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'respect', 'Therefore', 'based', 'judgement', 'how', 'well', 'series', 'book', 'are', 'probably', 'looking', 'Two', 'Stars.The', 'beauty', 'book', 'translate', 'large', 'extent', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'diverse', 'characters', 'rural', 'community', 'are', 'major', 'memorable', 'characters', 'such', 'Lydia', 'brilliant', 'scholar', 'shacks', 'temporary', 'slum', 'housing', 'scheduled', 'demolition', 'difficult', 'family', 'background', 'who', 'Sarah', 'new', 'school', 'when', 'mother', 'keep', 'scholarship', 'place', 'school', 'key', 'figure', 'Robert', 'Carne', 'who', 'enormous', 'pressures', 'life', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'wife', 'delicate', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'extreme', 'economic', 'difficulties', 'who', 'rapport', 'Sarah', 'initially', 'unlikely', 'are', 'also', 'host', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'enrich', 'community', 'complex', 'varied', 'individual', 'quirks', 'set', 'background', 'depressed', 'economy', '1930s', 'strains', 'community', 'most', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'viewed', 'one', 'go', 'boxed', 'set', 'rather', 'waiting', 'frustrating', 'week', 'see', 'next', 'instalment', 'TV', 'Provided', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'pre', 'conceived', 'expectations', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'series', 'book', 'based', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'best', 'avoid']",South Riding

The plot of South Riding would do Thomas Hardy proud except that he would have filled in the spaces.  There were so many possibilities here that were not explored adequately or at all and were brought to a hurried and jumbled end, and of course the overall tenor was grim.  I did like the actors--especially Anna Maxwell-Martin..  All the central characters were well acted--  David Morrissey and Penelope Wilton were both memorable but were constricted by the script.  I would very much like to see more of Maxwell-Martin because she is new to me.  The scenery was, as many have noted, stunning, and it certainly got across the dismal quality of life in that era.

1420741,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B004NBHVNQ,F. S. L'hoir,"[5, 6]","This well-acted drama, based on a beloved novel, certainly has possibilities: Anna Maxwell Martin as the school's new headmistress, Penelope Wilton as her eventual ally on the town council, and David Morrissey as the handsome brooding hero are all excellent, as are the various youngsters playing the schoolgirls. The cinematography of the churning North Sea is spectacular. But too many unresolved plot-lines have been left hanging like tangled wires in an unfinished construction of a schoolroom. We get glimpses of characters and plot rather than fully developed characterisations and motivations. For example, in this production, the abrupt introduction of the woman, who was prepared to drop everything to keep house in a shanty for the rather unpleasant father of five children, seems to serve merely as a plot device to get Lydia back to school. As with the three new episodes of ""Upstairs-Donwstairs"", the writers have tried to stuff too many ideas into too short-a time slot.Let us hope that this BBC trend does not continue!P.S. There is a 1974 version (DVD issued in 2007), with the late great actress of British theatre, Dorothy Tutin, playing the Schoolmistress. Highly rated, this ""South Riding"" is on four discs and in thirteen episodes, an indication of what viewers are missing.

1420742,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004NBHVNQ,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[58, 63]","Sarah Burton arrives in early 1930s a Yorkshire town, her hometown, to serve as headmistress in a girl's school. Is she an early feminist? The drama is conflicting, emotion interspersed, but the period telling is superb. Anna Maxwell Martin gives the Sarah character a believable struggle in this BBC adaptation of the last written book by Winifred Holtby. Equally stellar in performance is David Morrisey as Carne, a conservative farmer and politician initially opposed to Sarah. This farmer has a sick wife, a shy daughter, and plenty of opinion. Of course there is conflict as well as prejudicial issues dealing with others from the community and the school. Not really a romance, more of a study on characters and struggles of life in a time and place when one should know and keep their place.There is politicking in the British style, especially through Alderwoman Beddows (Penelope Wilton). Council meetings do some havoc on the community and individual family situations. As a result, not everything turns up a bed of roses. There is struggle with recession. A truth quite realistic on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s. A nice period piece. Sit back and enjoy the characters and the interaction.

1420744,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004NBHVNQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 18]","Originally, I had no particular inclination to review the BBC production of ""South Riding.""  This perfectly pleasant presentation is far from perfect and yet it has plenty to recommend it as well.  However, with only two other reviews, I felt compelled to chime in with the middle ground and present a few pros and cons of the miniseries.  To rate this at the five star level indicating that it is at the top echelon of quality might seem to set unreasonable expectations.  While nice, this is hardly on the level of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" or the sublime recent version of ""Bleak House.""  Everything can't be five stars or the classification loses any meaning!  Conversely, even if you don't particularly care for the program--there are many solid elements (especially the performances) that would elevate it beyond a dismissive one star.  So here I am, standing squarely in the middle--at about 3 1/2 stars rounded up for three very convincing actors (a strong Anna Maxwell-Martin, the always reliable David Morrissey, and the increasingly entertaining Penelope Wilton).If this three part miniseries is guilty of anything, it is of having too much story to compress into its limited timeframe.  Ostensibly the tale covers an entire town's worth of characters and story lines and three episodes is not adequate time to present them in an in-depth way.  The heart of the story involves a local girl (Maxwell-Martin) returning to South Riding to take up a position as the school mistress.  Headstrong and independent, she immediately clashes with some of more traditional town leaders--including Morrissey.  You know immediately where this battle of wills is headed, but credit the writer and actors for maintaining a credible conflict without an easy resolution.  This is, by far, the most intriguing aspect of the story as Morrissey is haunted by an unresolved relationship in his life.  Maxwell-Martin may be a little progressive and modern for this tiny 1930's village, but she plays with a wide eyed conviction that keeps you on her side.The story, however, also extends to subplots about an illicit affair, a land grab scheme, an impoverished girl making good, unrequited attraction and a number of other narrative elements battling for screen time.  The talented supporting cast is very much underserved by the script that has little time or interest to develop them beyond the most superficial qualities.  As such, much of the drama and impact of ""South Riding"" is limited.  The second episode is probably the most engaging with the Maxwell-Martin and Morrissey pairing being explored at length.  But even that plot point comes to an abrupt end.  The complicated and overstuffed plot points, however, all come to tidy conclusions in a rushed ending filled with pat solutions and cliched narration.For its faults, though, this is still a handsome production filled with terrific actors.  I'm glad I watched it, and I found it entertaining and pleasurable.  Is it the best that BBC or Masterpiece Theater has to offer?  Not even close!  But if you enjoy this type of entertainment, this show has its share of charm even if it's not particularly substantive.  A good effort that simply has too much going on and, thus, leaves the viewer wanting more story and character development.
