842331,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002OXRSG,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 7]","Saved! was a common case of coming in way too strong and using all the good material first, only to allow an ending that seemed like it could fit into any other simplistic teenie-bopper film.  Let me explain.  When I first started watching this film, I was impressed.  I was laughing at the characters, the story, the themes; I was enjoying the brief flashback into my youth as a student at a Catholic school.  I remembered students like the ones portrayed in this film.  I was ready for it all.  I had heard so much about this film, that with the stunningly powerful and humorous beginning, I knew it was going to be an instant favorite.  I was wrong.  About thirty minutes into this film, when Mary starts finding an interest in an oddly developed love interest (Patrick Fugit), I began to see the beginnings of a normal, everyday love story.  Stories where those less fortunate come together to reek havoc over those that are ""too perfect"" or in this case ""too religious"".  Finally, in the end, everyone learns a lesson and we all go home happy ... like God would have wanted.Where was the raw, dark humor in this film?  Again, the way it started out it could have easily been an interesting film, but then it just went so far down hill it was un-Save-able.  Perhaps it was the acting.  Mandy Moore was so over the top she overshadowed the other characters that we were to care for.  Whenever she was on screen, she seemed to be pushing the other characters to the side, creating a distraction instead of any character development.  Mac ... oh poor Mac, isn't it sad when your brother makes a better religious film than you do?  When was it a good idea to have him in this film?  Honestly, he mumbled through this film trying to give some emotion to his character, but instead acting like he didn't need the money he just wanted to be in front of the camera.  Jena Malone was decent, but just didn't ever seem to fit into her role.  At the Prom, when she was dancing pregnant, it really didn't seem like she was ""acting"" pregnant.  She didn't know how, and I think that was a flaw in her character.  The only other person we haven't talked about is Cassandra, who actually held her role pretty well.  The trouble that I had with her is that sometimes her lines seemed jumbled or cut off well too soon.  Her comment about the Christian surfboard team was funny, but for some strange reason was cut off too early on my DVD copy that I watched.  So, outside of a failing story, we have mediocre actors fighting their way through this film.What else...?  The overall theme of this film was inconsistent.  I was having trouble with the way that Mary was acting compared to the way that her mother was acting, and overall comparing it to the way that Hilary Faye was acting.  Didn't they all have the same beliefs?  It seemed like they could turn these beliefs on and off with just a quick flick of a switch.  I never truly understood what Roland's feelings on religion were, and why he suddenly found an attraction with the ""rebel"" girl.  Didn't anyone else see this as a foregone conclusion?  They had to get together because they were two characters with ""disabilities"".  That nearly made me gag.  I also felt that the entire connection between Pastor Skip and Mary's mom was unnecessary.  I felt the director put that in this film for more of a dramatic element, but instead it just became an excess vegetable in this already spoiled bowl of soup.I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but by the middle of the film you could already predict the rest of the movie.  It was clich&eacute; filled to the very top.  I, having watched several movies in my lifetime, could predict everything that was going to happen before it happened.  Thus making this film predictable, instead of cultishly blasphemous.  There was nothing intelligent about this film, just sex jokes followed by debunked religious humor.  I was not impressed.  I expected to be laughing hysterically with the immense force of the wit and creativity, sadly that was not the case.  Instead, I just watched another Hollywood film that used semi-large stars to draw in the audiences that may not normally see this film.  This was very predictable and dull.

842335,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002OXRSG,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 6]","I hadn't seen many ads for this movie going in, but I knew that Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, and Macauly Culkin were in it. I didn't set my hopes very high, thinking that the film was going to be a bit of a letdown. I was so wrong! This is one of the funniest and best movies that I've seen in a very long time. The story follows Mary (Malone), an oh-so-Christian girl who has never wavered in spirituallity. She has two best friends, the so-good-she's-bad Hilary Faye (Moore), and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), a Vietnamese girl who was &quot;saved&quot; when she was adopted by an African-American family. The three of them are part of a group called the Christian Jewels, and they are a Christian Rock band. Mary also has a boyfriend named Dean (Chad Faust), who is also a perfect Christian... until one day, Mary and Dean are swimming, when Dean tells Mary that he thinks he might be gay. Mary is so shocked that she bangs her head and starts to drown. A kid by the pool, who has long brown hair and a beard, jumps in and saves her. In a delusional state, Mary believes the boy to be Jesus, and he tells her to save Dean. Mary does everything she can think of short of sex to save her boyfriend from homosexualality. One day, while talking with Hilary Faye, they get on the subject of intercourse. Hilary Faye says that, in certain circumstances, like rape, God can restore a person's virginity. Mary believes that, if she is able to save Dean through sex, her virginity will be restored. So they do it. And not only does Dean not become straight, Mary gets pregnant.Soon, Mary begins to question her faith, and she is thrown out of the Jewels group, only to be replaced by a nerdy wannabe (Heather Matarazzo). Mary also begins hanging out with Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the only Jewish girl and the only bad girl at the school, and Roland (Culkin), Hilary Faye's handicapped and laid back brother. The two kids, who are fast developping a relationship, help get her through the pregnancy as best they can.This movie is about religion gone nuts. The girls at the school, Hilary Faye in particular, are examples of people who use religion for the wrong reasons. Hilary Faye believes anyone who isn't Christian is going to Hell, and it is her mission to save them all. Also, the movie addresses ways of remedying situations. When Dean is sent to a place called Mercy House to get de-gayified, Mary soon discovers that it is not a place for those who are sent there, it is a place for those who do the sending.This movie may be offensive to some people. For example, when we are first introduced to Cassandra, we see her pull into a handicap parking space, she is smoking, there are beer bottles in her car, and right away we learn she is Jewish. There are bad girls in every religion, and we needed to know why she did the things she did, but it's almost as if the writer assossiated Jews with evil. Probably not though, because of the film's theme. Anyway, if you can handle religion bashing, you will love this movie.",5,This Movie Saves All From Being Bored!,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3013,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'ads', 'movie', 'going', 'knew', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Macauly', 'Culkin', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'hopes', 'very', 'high', 'thinking', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'letdown', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'one', 'funniest', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'story', 'Mary', 'Malone', 'oh-so-Christian', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'wavered', 'spirituallity', 'two', 'best', 'friends', ""so-good-she's-bad"", 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'Moore', 'Veronica', 'Elizabeth', 'Thai', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'quot', 'saved', 'quot', 'when', 'was', 'adopted', 'African-American', 'family', 'three', 'are', 'part', 'group', 'called', 'Christian', 'Jewels', 'are', 'Christian', 'Rock', 'band', 'Mary', 'also', 'boyfriend', 'named', 'Dean', 'Chad', 'Faust', 'who', 'also', 'perfect', 'Christian', 'one', 'day', 'Mary', 'Dean', 'are', 'swimming', 'when', 'Dean', 'Mary', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'Mary', 'so', 'shocked', 'head', 'drown', 'kid', 'pool', 'who', 'long', 'brown', 'hair', 'beard', 'jumps', 'delusional', 'state', 'Mary', 'boy', 'be', 'Jesus', 'save', 'Dean', 'Mary', 'everything', 'can', 'think', 'short', 'sex', 'save', 'boyfriend', 'homosexualality', 'One', 'day', 'talking', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'get', 'subject', 'intercourse', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'rape', 'God', 'can', 'restore', 'person', 'virginity', 'Mary', 'able', 'save', 'Dean', 'sex', 'virginity', 'will', 'be', 'restored', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'Dean', 'not', 'become', 'straight', 'Mary', 'pregnant.Soon', 'Mary', 'question', 'faith', 'thrown', 'Jewels', 'group', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'nerdy', 'wannabe', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Mary', 'also', 'hanging', 'out', 'Cassandra', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'only', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'only', 'bad', 'girl', 'school', 'Roland', 'Culkin', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'handicapped', 'laid', 'back', 'brother', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'fast', 'developping', 'relationship', 'help', 'get', 'pregnancy', 'best', 'can.This', 'movie', 'religion', 'gone', 'nuts', 'girls', 'school', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'particular', 'are', 'examples', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'religion', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'going', 'Hell', 'mission', 'save', 'Also', 'movie', 'ways', 'remedying', 'situations', 'When', 'Dean', 'sent', 'place', 'called', 'Mercy', 'House', 'get', 'de-gayified', 'Mary', 'soon', 'not', 'place', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'there', 'place', 'who', 'do', 'sending.This', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'offensive', 'people', 'example', 'when', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'Cassandra', 'see', 'pull', 'handicap', 'parking', 'space', 'smoking', 'are', 'beer', 'bottles', 'car', 'right', 'away', 'learn', 'Jewish', 'are', 'bad', 'girls', 'religion', 'needed', 'know', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'almost', 'writer', 'assossiated', 'Jews', 'evil', 'Probably', 'not', 'film', 'theme', 'Anyway', 'can', 'handle', 'religion', 'bashing', 'will', 'love', 'movie']",Saved!

But I went anyway, and to say that I thought ""Saved!"" was one of the best teen movies since the John Hughes heyday of the mid-eighties is an understatement.If you have never gone to a Chrisitan school, then many of the jokes in ""Saved!"" will probably fall flat to you. But first time director Brian Dannelly, directing from a script he co-wrote, balances the films satrical elements perfectly with some of the good old sticky-sappy conventions that its pretty easy to like this movie.The story centers around Mary(Jena Malone), a devout born again Christian who believes she see's Jesus in a pool and tells her to sleep with her [...] boyfriend. And wouldn't you know that she gets pregnant.The film balances a group of excellent supporting charactors, led by Mandy Moore, who makes for a surprising good villian and proves her acting talents pretty well, and Maculaly Culkin, who has comic timing that Billy Wilder and Preston Sturgess would've gladly tipped their hats too.The film was slightly controversial upon its release, but this film doesn't make fun of Christians. It points out how some Chrisitans use the Bible for their own justification. This movie is never as mean, callous or redundently stupid as, oh, say ""Mean Girls"".The movies has a few flaws, like the deep dark secret Moore's Hilary Faye has hidden away, which is a pretty sad excuse for friction amongst the characters, and the end lacks the wit and satire of the first ninty five percent of the movie, content on being just another typical Hollywood teen movie.But who cares?

The impressive thing about this is that I saw it in Kansas, where they're seriously considering changing the state motto to ""I Ain't Come From No Monkey.""Not that there's any reason at all why anybody should get uppity about this film, of course.  ""Saved!"" is perfectly harmless, even bland in its satire.  The characters are all very broadly drawn, the format is 80's teen flick, and the ending wraps everything up in a nice happy package, sitcom-style.  Only people who dispute evolution, picket abortion clinics, lobby against gay marriage, etc., are likely to take offense to anything contained here; and I know better than to argue with lunatics.  The rest of us aren't learning anything we didn't know from this movie.  Relax, Mr. Falwell, ""Saved!"" is ""preaching to the converted"" (so to speak) exactly as ""SuperSize Me"" was, and neither is likely to have much effect on core bases of fundamentalists and the morbidly obese respectively.Then there are the people who complain that ""Saved!"" puts the emphasis on psycho-Christian Hilary (are we really so surprised that Mandy Moore pulled this off?), and naive, misguided outsider Mary (Jena Malone), but doesn't provide a solid counter-example of a good Christian girl who's devout but not judgemental or confused or manifestly insane.  Well, nice try, but I'm afraid that's only valid as a ""criticism"" if you're Christian.  Sure, most of the reasonable, down-to-earth, open-minded characters in this film are non-Christians; but you know, maybe that's just ""the way it was"" in this one particular hypothetical instance.  Movies have no more responsibility to constantly promote the Christian agenda than they do the ""gay agenda"" (much discussed by Christians), or the Puerto Rican, or the vegan, or ANY agenda other than that of making their backers some scrilla.  Anyway, this is supposed to be a satire, remember?  It doesn't always have to hit above the belt, even when the target is religion - at least in this country.  (Thank God!)""Saved!"" isn't nearly as venemous or vindictive towards religion as it could've been, especially in light of recent events.  Yes, Hilary is ridiculous, over-the-top, flamboyantly hypocritical - again, that's how you know it's a JOKE.  But about the most ""blasphemous"" thing that happens in the film is that at one point she drives her car into a 50-foot Jesus-shaped billboard in a fit of rage, and the head lands on her windshield.  Compared with what he goes through in ""The Passion,"" that's a cake walk.  The writers are actually very careful to make the point - at the end of the film - that true spirituality is (or ought to be) positive and balanced rather than vicious and bigoted.  They don't insist on denomination, and why should they?  Yet ""Saved!"" has in fact been embraced by a few Christian groups whose faith was evidently strong enough to withstand a trip to the movies.  I daresay the typical televangelist could learn something from them.I've chosen not to rehash the plot for you in this review because that's already been done.  To me this film is more interesting for the way people react to it than for the content itself.  I enjoyed it, but not as much as I figured I would considering how much certain people hate it.  Still, I like the fact that somebody made this kind of picture, and I hope more follow.  The actors are all OK; Eva Amurri steals the show as obnoxious punk Jew transfer student Cassandra; Patrick Fugit is the Christian skateboarder and oft-overlooked example of a non-insane but religious youth in the film; Macaulay Culkin's in here too as the wheelchair-bound wiseacre Roland (get it), and he can't act, but we already knew that.

But first, I want to disagree with the reviewer who believes that satire is meant to be funny and not taken seriously. Just the opposite. Satire uses humor to address deadly serious subjects. It is difficult to do well, as it needs to achieve a precarious balance between being too biting and being too gentle.  This movie achieves that balance, and is the main reason why it is so delicious!We have been fortunate that two excellent satires have been made recently, ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"". The former satirizes the death merchants who sell cigarettes (the main character is likable, although his job is detestable), and the latter takes pot shots at the self-motivational industry and child beauty pageants. There is also a satire of an ""American Idol""-like TV show, which also stars Mandy Moore, which is pretty good (I forget the name).I will not summarize the movie here. Suffice it to say that ""Saved"" has an excellent script--funny, warm, and wise. The characters are well-developed and believable.  The acting is superb, from everyone, nothing over the top (inappropriate in a satire).  Moore's Hillary Fay is played as a devout Born Again Christian whose religious zeal has made her lose some of her basic humanity.  Jena Malone's Mary is a sweet religious girl who gets woken up by a jolt of reality and ends up confused about what to believe. Mary's mother is delightful, and has some of the  film's best lines.Some reviewers have said that this is an anti-Christian film.  It is not.  It is a plea for tolerance and understanding from certain religious fundamentalists who see the world in terms of black and white, good or bad.

It's probably a good thing; if I had seen this movie in public, they would have had to sedate me.Jena Malone stars as Mary, a student at a Christian high school.  When her boyfriend comes out and tells her he's gay, she is determined to save him, to the point that she has sex with him.  It doesn't work.  He's carted off to a special facility that's supposed to fix wayward teens, and she winds up pregnant.  Finally she realizes that Jesus was never there for her at all, and that the only ones that can help her are the ones who think differently from the masses.While not exactly mean-spirited, this film does make fun of dogmatic Christians mercilessly, though they aren't likely to realize it if they watch.  With the climate in this country the way it's been lately, I found this very refreshing.  I haven't laughed as hard at a movie in a very long time.

Saved's biggest fault is it wavers between scathing humor aimed at the hypocrisy of religion to schmaltzy feel good warm fuzzy moments.  It's a minor distraction that takes some of the sting out of its bite.  Culkin is okay as wheelchair bound Roland but he still sports his perpetual smirk made famous from his Home Alone movies.  It's Eva  Amurri who steals the show as the rebellious Jewish outcast Cassandra although her sudden sympathetic change of heart halfway through is a bit out of character.  A fun and smart film but ultimately it fails to deliver nothing more than a couple lumps of processed sugar.,3,worth watching but not as edgy as it could be,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,749,"['mildly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'certainly', ""'ve"", 'attended', 'Christian', 'school', 'point', 'life', 'really', 'true', 'Saved', 'biggest', 'fault', 'scathing', 'humor', 'aimed', 'hypocrisy', 'religion', 'schmaltzy', 'feel', 'good', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'moments', 'minor', 'distraction', 'sting', 'bite', 'Culkin', 'okay', 'wheelchair', 'Roland', 'still', 'sports', 'perpetual', 'smirk', 'made', 'famous', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'who', 'show', 'rebellious', 'Jewish', 'outcast', 'Cassandra', 'sudden', 'sympathetic', 'change', 'heart', 'halfway', 'bit', 'character', 'fun', 'smart', 'film', 'ultimately', 'deliver', 'nothing', 'more', 'couple', 'lumps', 'processed', 'sugar']",Saved!

While, in some cases, obviously over the top, it was very right on with how many evangelical communities think and function.  While completely outrageous and hysterical, the first time watching it was almost painful instead of funny.  As stated before, Saved does an ingenious job of bringing to life some of idiotic prejudices in some religious communities.  However, upon second watching, I was much more able to simply laugh at the lives we live.  The writing in Saved is superb, quick, irreverent, believable, go for the punches funny.  This movie would be enjoyable as just a movie to anyone that has a sense of humor.  However, to those of us who grew up in similar situations, it will act as therapy and help you see the humor in things we took so serious.  Highly, highly recommended.

It's a comedy with some dramatic twists, and some interesting points to make about modern Christianity.  The performances are all really good!  The actors play this very real.  Mandy Moore (as the sometimes cruel Hillary Faye) is not pure evil - just self-centered and not empathetic towards others.  Jena Malone plays Mary who becomes heavy with child after trying to save her gay boyfriend.  She makes her innocent and sympathetic.  Mac Culkin plays a handicapped brother, and does it with a wry wit and sly style.  Patrick Fugit is great as the pastor's son - who happens to be a semi-professional Christian skateboarder.  Very moving also is Mary Louise Parker as Malone's mom - who finds the situation with her daughter quite hard to take.Ultimately the movie is about tolerance - something I think most Christians understand already.  It turns its critical eye on people who force others to feel inferior because of mistakes they make or faiths they have which do not line up with their own views.  They also have some clever bits about the new face of Christianity - where the secular and sacred seemed to have become blurred (rock bands with Jesus messages, WWJD bracelets, etc).  In the end it's a movie with a big heart - just maybe not an orthodox one.  All the characters end up in an okay place, and no one is judged too harshly.

I can't remember how many times I've laughed out loud in a movie theater after seeing this film.In an era of oppressive ""politial correctness"" comes a movie that spits in the face of all conservative conventions.  The film goes for broke and isn't ashamed or self-conscious of being a biting social satire.This movie is really portraying a larger truth by satirizing a pedogogy and crippling fundamentalism that chooses to give any human being who isn't  a WASP no chance of hope in our society.I'll be happy to show this to any pedophile Catholic Priest who abuses his power to the advances of innocent victims, usually young boys.  It shows the hypocrisy that has made fundamental Catholic religion what it is today.  There is a part of me that truly believes that a majority of people use religion the wrong way.  That way is to hurt, embarrass, shame, and use their powers to belittle people who don't necessary agree with their view points.  The film shows the suffocation this mentality can bring upon the main characters of the film.The film has a happy tone and that is orchestrated through it's director, Brian Dannelly, who said in a recent interview that he was surprised at the controversy that the film has raised.

Not because we like Mandy Moore or anyone in the cast, but because a movie knocking the hilarity of how dumb Christians are interested us.  Now I know all of you Passion of the Christ lovers out there reading this probably hate me, but you know I'm right!  I'm Catholic too, but at least I'm honest enough to admit that Saved! is completely true.  If 'God is love,' he would have no problem with homosexuality.  If 'God is people,' then why can't teenagers keep their babies?  The whole religion idea SUCKS!  Just face it.Enough with my ranting...  Onto the review.  As I already stated, Saved! is true.  It really does portray this lifestyle we've all come to be familiar with.  It shows that it's ridiculous and I'm happy for it.  It's such an awesome film because it's a teen movie with heart.  It doesn't cliche itself with the typical teen movie rules.  I mean sure, it does kind of take steps into other teen movies but at the same to it adds its own... oomph.  Plus, I have to say the whole cast pulls off really great performances.  Yes, even little Miss Moore.  And Jena Malone does an excellent job as the lead character Mary.  What I also liked about it was the controversy it was bringing to town.  My church said if we saw it, and I quote, ""you will rot forever in Hell.""  How stupid are these people?  No movie starring a pop star could ever cause Satan to take me anymore, dude.  Why don't they say anything about us rotting in Hell for seeing ""The Passion?""  Can you answer me that?

Yes, here in the South we do say ""y'all"" and you'll be hard-pressed to find a restaurant without deep-fat-treated chicken, but the reality of the culture is infinitely more complex. So too, Christian subculture is much more than the sum of its parts. I simply was not convinced that a two-hour movie could tackle the subject with anything more than a slap-dash spirit of disdain.Therefore, you must imagine my surprise to find Saved! a funny, true, rather touching and not altogether unsympathetic snapshot of Christian adolescence.Many of the complaints I'd heard about this movie revolved around what amounts to a misunderstanding: people who were not raised within this subculture watch Saved! and sneer at what they perceive to be a gross exaggeration. However, the crowning glory of this movie is not its elaborate caricature, but its restraint. If the writers had wanted to go over-the-top with their portrayal of a Jesus-centric culture, it would have been terrifically easy ... but they didn't.As I am prepared to attest, before God and everybody, Saved! gets it just about right.All the congregation archetypes are present: the dorky/hip late thirty-something youth pastor, the single mom who dresses too sexy for her reputation's good, the band of pretty-and-popular/hyper-sincere teenage girls who have their own Christian music group, the token ""outsider,"" the good-looking athlete who is probably gay ... and even a few of the more subtle, less obvious characters appear as well. I was particularly impressed with the home room teacher -- a woman you only see a couple of times, but you get a pretty good sense of who she is. She's a well-educated, down-to-earth woman who is probably the best quiet ally the girls could have.Overall, Saved! is an exceptional study in superficiality of all kinds, not just the expected ""Oh, Christians are so shallow."" This facet is present, sure, but it's not the focus -- and for the most part the film makes it abundantly clear that the prejudices of these people are very much their own, merely bolstered and buttressed by a social culture that permits them the freedom to close their minds.The ""moral"" of the film is not the easy ""Christians are scary and weird,"" but ""socially-imposed religion tends to set standards that are well-nigh impossible to live up to."" During the final ""confrontation"" at the school prom, the gay athlete insists -- completely without irony -- that he's pretty sure Jesus still loves him anyway; and Mary demands to know why, since God made everyone so different, Christianity wants everyone to be the same?And best of all, at the end of the picture there is no catastrophic anti-religion walk-out.

The film really exaggerates a lot of the faith's -usually- more subtle cultural idiosyncrasies, especially Christians' attempt at mimicking popular culture but with a spiritual angle... and failing miserably.  Of particular amusement was when some of the main character's friends try to exorcise her because she is asking legitimate, but serious questions about God. The movie's Christian community perceives and labels these honest questions as the work of the devil etc. Yet the ""leaders"" of the community themselves embody almost everything wrong with Christianity: hypocrisy, superficial relationships, refusal to ask real questions, insensitive, judgmental and just plain ignorant.If you are a Christian and find the movie too offensive, then maybe it should serve as a wake-up call. Like it or not, this movie reflects how much of our culture views Christians. Fortunately, most people have a high degree of respect for Jesus; it's his followers that mess it up more often than not. We should take note of that. But kudos to the Christian viewers of this movie who find themselves thinking, ""that's NOT what being a Christian is about."" And even more kudos to those believers motivated to change the underlying causes for this caricature of their faith.Christians could (and should) be known for their authenticity, love and forgiveness, and not for all of the hate, judgmental attitudes and hypocrisy they are usually identified with. This film capitalizes on the distance between the ideal and the all too often reality of the modern faithful. Whatever you believe (or don't believe) this movie is very entertaining and worth taking the time for at least once.

Exposing religion for all the hypocrisy, this film may step on quite a few toes, but it's all in good fun and whether you want to agree or not, it's hard not to see the point.When Mary (Jena Malone) hears that her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust) is gay she's devastated.  So devastated that she hallucinates Jesus has told her to `un-gay' her boyfriend.  So she does this by forsaking her faith and sleeping with him, trying to force him straight.  This only results in bad things for her boyfriend is still caught looking at gay porn and is sent to a rehab center and Mary is left pregnant and frightened for no one even knows she had sex.Her best friend, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), proves herself to be less and friend and more a self-promoter as she uses Mary's situation to criticize and humiliate her.  And then the new kid moves in, the new pastor's son Patrick (Patrick Fugit).  Both Mary and Hilary like him, but it's apparent that he is after Mary, who while she likes him is keeping her distance for she doesn't want anyone to know of her pregnancy.As Mary becomes more and more disgusted with her faith, mostly after realizing that the very `married' Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan) is dating her mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker), she starts exploring other beliefs only to find that nothing is working, but when a small group of kids find out she's pregnant and accept her she's finally at ease, at least for a little while.The supporting cast includes Macaulay Culkin in one of his smartest roles in years as Roland, Hilary's handicapped brother, and Eva Amurri who plays the Cassandra, the rebel Jew who joins the Christian school after being expelled from everywhere else.  Hilary has a special vendetta with her, trying her hardest to convert her with some hilarious results.  The rest of the acting is strong as well, with Mandy Moore taking the most of my praise.  She's impressed me before, and after watching her performance here I'm convinced she's one of our most talented cross-over stars!`Saved' is smart and funny...funny because it's true, and it does a brilliant job of exposing most religion for the hypocrites they really are.

(gotta include that exclamation point there) is a comedy about the out-of-control antics of kids attending a Christian high school.  And yes, we get it:  this is no ordinary Christian school, this is a shining Holier-than-thou-on-the-Hill kind of school, where God and Jesus are bounced around like an over-inflated beach ball.Granted, SAVED! (Amen!) has many cute and cuddly moments, and the cast (accept for MaCaulay Culkin, more on that later) is fun to watch, and even more fun to get to know, yet the movie hits the viewer between the eyes with its satirical message of fundamentalist Christianity in hypocritical overdrive to the point said viewer has a knot on his noggin'.  Kind of like:  Okay, we understand the hypocracy message, thank you very much.  Let's see some more of Mandy Moore in a cute blouse.Without giving away any of the plot (as I'm too darned lazy at the moment), this flick presents the trials and tribulations of a group of very devout young people as they attend their last year of Super Duper Christian school, and even though all of them are immersed in the Faith, somehow the Faith just don't seem to measure up to Biblical expectations.  There's heartbreak, confusion, anxiety, anger--heck, all of the things one expects from normal teens.  The story is predictable, the ending rather weak, and even though I chuckled a handful of times I still would like to see Mandy Moore in yet another cute blouse.  Maybe a tube top.SAVED! is a whirlwind of satirical overkill.  Yet it still has its fair share of humorous moments; I just can't recall them right now.  Jena Malone, Mandy Moore (cute blouse), Patrick Fugit, and Mary-Louise Parker headline a very solid cast, with one exception.  MaCaulay Culkin went through his entire annoying role with a disinterested smirk on his face, and that pretty much sums up how SAVED! (Hallelujah!) affected me.

Critics who are fervourChristians will scream blasphemy but actually this movie is much more than the teen stars who act in it.The script is clever, which I am sure most know by now. It's the actring that suprisingly connects the audience with the issue at heart. Jena Malone is wide-eyed and sweet, turning from a precarious teen deeply involved in the christian faith to a disillusioned pregnant mum-to-be by her g*y boyfriend. Mandy Moore plays a religiously indoctrinated girl who's bent on reaching eternal divinity at all costs. Maculay Culkin turns in an unexpectedly sensitive portrayal of a wheelchair-bound kid brother of her evil sister. Props must go to the faboulous Eva Amurri for her stunning portrayal of wayward rebel Cassandra and the real highlight in the movie is when she breaks out in a delirious fit during the school's first Assembly spewing Jewish as if she was possessed by God until Mandy Moore's character reveals that she's talking dirty! Funny!At the end, this film is much more than teen pregancy, h*mose*uality and God. It's about how many of us pray to the same God but see so many things on our own. It also serves a timely reminder that religion, like most other things, must move with the times without becoming overly rigid.

I thought that it would be a dark, edgy black comedy about a Christian high school. Instead, I found it to be a fairly straightforward teen comedy (albeit a clever and well-acted one). Although funny and well-written, the script tends to play it a little too safe, keeping the film from living up to its potential. However, the film is redeemed by the terrific, talented cast. The young actors flesh out their characters well, making them funny, deeply flawed and endearing. Mandy Moore is surprisingly great playing ruthless, holier-than-thou Hilary Faye, Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) is adorable playing good-hearted rebel Cassandra, and MacCaulay Culkin is snide and mischievious as Hilary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother Roland. The script does poke plenty of fun at the Christian church's youth ministries, and I can say from my personal experience (I went to church every week till I was 17 and attended plenty of Christian youth events) that it portrays the scene fairly accurately. However, for the most part, the film never really pushes the envelope too far. It almost seems as though the creators were holding back, afraid of offending people or seeming disrespectful.

842379,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B0002OXRSG,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 7]","I just had the opportunity to view this nazarene cult-comedy tonight on cable, and was rather repulsed by this presentation, yet both morbid curiosity and evocative meditation beckoned Me on. Having attended Christian schools until Junior High, this proposed satirical film actually contains many truths in the behavior and attitudes exhibited by these subhuman types. The sad dependence on others' opinions, all seemingly administered by the moldy babble according to the personal translation of the particular preacher at the school or church, the sub-par music, the sacharrine niceness, etc. Although the Protestants are much more nauseating and exagerrated than the Catholics.*Seeking to ""save"" her boyfriend Dean from being gay, a girl named Mary fornicates with him and becomes pregnant from this devirginization, hiding it from the rest of the christian-cult subculture. She claims 'Jesus' told her to do so, after an underwater bump in the head yields a hallucination - the face of the nazarene super-imposed upon the likened visage of the poolboy who also happens to have long hair and a beard.Finding a copy of 'Macho' magazine, his parents send him to a rehabilitation center for ""degayification"", where he actually finds a gay partner and male prom date.Cassandra, the resident bad girl, rumored to be a 'stripper', a smoking Jewish rebel, goes about expressing her independence against the christian oppression from lighting a cigarette in the cafeteria, to undulating in a sensual euphoria, jesting at the supposed 'speaking in tongues' glossolalia while tearing at her clothes. I like the way she plays with the sheeps' mind from time to time  - in one instance claiming to want to convert to Christianity, but at the last moment decides to side with Satan instead. In reality, she would have been expelled the second she was spotted with a cigarette in her mouth, even from the parking lot.Mary's secret is eventually discovered and exploited by smug classmates. I thought the ""drive-by exorcism"" was amusing, as the christians actually consider the bible a veritable 'weapon', as in the so-called ""sword of the spirit"", which Hilary Faye, a very 'Chastity Paraya"" / ""Betty Bowers""-like character takes to a literal extreme and actually throws it at 'Mary' {'coincidence' that she was named such? As she finds herself in a similar position as the fabled 'Virgin Mary'}.Predictably, Hilary Faye demonstrtaes her hypocrisy at the Prom, as it turns out that it was she who was responsible for vandalizing the school with devil-worshipping symbols such as the inverted cross and a '666', all in an attempt to blame the 'bad kids' and assure her place as the Prom Queen. In another amusing scene towards the finale, in a nervous fit, she actually drives her van into a garish image of Jesus.Keep in mind that there are actually clonish people who act like this, existing in an entire haze of justified delusion. This film is actually not far-fetched at all, which is probably the most disturbing element herein._________* So what was a naturally-born Satanist to do in that environment? Either operate incognito and just ""lay low"", or go over the top a violate the dress code by merely wearing a Heavy Metal t-shirt or allowing one's hair to grow over the ears.

Chances are that ""Hilary Faye"", Moore's character, was behind it...The only major flaw I found with it was the ""feel good"" ending that harkened back to John Hughes movies of the 80s, prom scene and all. Even though it's somewhat a black comedy, it doesn't quite go into that territory all that much.I didn't think that they attacked Christianity (like some of the people who protested the movie had said) as much as they were attacking intolerance, mixed messages, and ""holier than thou"" types.I would recommend this one more as a rental than a purchase, unless you know someone who had actually gone to schools like that or were around the type of people that are portrayed in the film.

So how do you come up with a twist on combining some tried-and-true formulas?  Set your picture at a Christian high school, throw in some better-than-average talented actors, and back it up with a great sounding Christian-influenced movie soundtrack, and the end result is SAVED!, a scathingly funny indictment of all-things-Christian as well as it is a wholesome bit of praise for just the same sentiments.Mary (played by the winning Jena Malone) is at a crossroads in her life: entering her senior year at school, she learns that her hunky Christian boyfriend is gay.  An inadvertant bump on the head forces her to believe that Jesus wants her to sacrifice her virginity in order to ""save"" the youth ... who still ends up being carted off to Mercy House, a religious-themed halfway house for drug-abusers and the ""sexually confused.""  Now pregnant, Mary must make the best of her situation, making and losing friends and coming to grips with the fact that -- despite her beliefs -- the Lord is going to see to it that her life has changed.At times, SAVED is hilariously funny.  The script is very tight, and it makes great use of some very funny characters: a haughty-taughty high school drama queen thinking she's God's gift to mankind (played with surprising spirit by pop star Mandy Moore); her brother -- wheelchair-bound -- and certain he's no Christian (underplayed by Macaulay Culkin); the bad-girl Jewish teen who's been kicked out of every other religious school in the area and has to settle on a Christian alternative; and the principal's son, a bright-eyed charming young man who just wants to do the right thing.  All of these characters mesh perfectly to the level of writing provided, and Mary Louise Parker makes a wonderful cameo-style appearance as Mary's mother -- a woman who can't quite separate what's right from ... well ... what's religiously right.Sadly, the last twenty minute (or so) of the film do descend to the level of the typical teen comedy -- just above the cut of an After School Special but well below the bawdy mirth of PORKIES or any installment of the AMERICAN PIE series -- sliding heavily into the predictable.  However, like a good Christian, the film finds redemption in its closing moments, chucking more family sentiment into a few frames than most family dramas manage in two hours of film.Forget the fact that the film deals with Christianity: the story satirizes the religion's convictions as much as it supports them.  Forget the fact that this is a cut-above-average teen film: again, the story satirizes teen angst as much as it validates it.  Forget the fact that SAVED! might just be what God wanted: even Christ is given a hilarious cameo in the form of a message-delivering billboard without being heavy-handed.  In the end, the movie will put a smile on your face ... and quite possibly leave it there for several days later.",4,SAVED From Obscurity,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,2993,"['Teen', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'Unfortunately', 'movies', 'focusing', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'prevalent', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'twist', 'combining', 'tried-and-true', 'formulas', 'Set', 'picture', 'Christian', 'high', 'school', 'throw', 'better-than-average', 'talented', 'actors', 'back', 'up', 'great', 'sounding', 'Christian-influenced', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'end', 'result', 'SAVED', 'scathingly', 'funny', 'indictment', 'all-things-Christian', 'as', 'well', 'wholesome', 'bit', 'praise', 'just', 'same', 'sentiments.Mary', 'played', 'winning', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'crossroads', 'life', 'entering', 'senior', 'year', 'school', 'hunky', 'Christian', 'boyfriend', 'gay', 'inadvertant', 'bump', 'head', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'sacrifice', 'virginity', 'order', 'save', 'youth', 'who', 'still', 'up', 'being', 'carted', 'Mercy', 'House', 'religious-themed', 'halfway', 'house', 'drug-abusers', 'sexually', 'confused', 'Now', 'pregnant', 'Mary', 'must', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'making', 'losing', 'friends', 'coming', 'grips', 'fact', 'beliefs', 'Lord', 'going', 'see', 'life', 'changed.At', 'times', 'SAVED', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'script', 'very', 'tight', 'great', 'use', 'very', 'funny', 'characters', 'haughty-taughty', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'queen', 'thinking', 'God', 'gift', 'mankind', 'played', 'surprising', 'spirit', 'pop', 'star', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'brother', 'wheelchair-bound', 'certain', 'Christian', 'underplayed', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'bad-girl', 'Jewish', 'teen', 'who', 'been', 'kicked', 'other', 'religious', 'school', 'area', 'settle', 'Christian', 'alternative', 'principal', 'son', 'bright-eyed', 'charming', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'characters', 'mesh', 'perfectly', 'level', 'writing', 'provided', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'wonderful', 'cameo-style', 'appearance', 'Mary', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'separate', 'what', 'right', 'well', 'what', 'religiously', 'right.Sadly', 'last', 'twenty', 'minute', 'so', 'film', 'do', 'descend', 'level', 'typical', 'teen', 'comedy', 'just', 'cut', 'School', 'Special', 'well', 'bawdy', 'mirth', 'PORKIES', 'installment', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'series', 'sliding', 'heavily', 'predictable', 'However', 'good', 'Christian', 'film', 'redemption', 'closing', 'moments', 'chucking', 'more', 'family', 'sentiment', 'few', 'frames', 'most', 'family', 'dramas', 'manage', 'two', 'hours', 'film.Forget', 'fact', 'film', 'deals', 'Christianity', 'story', 'religion', 'convictions', 'as', 'much', 'Forget', 'fact', 'cut-above-average', 'teen', 'film', 'again', 'story', 'teen', 'angst', 'as', 'much', 'Forget', 'fact', 'SAVED', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'what', 'God', 'wanted', 'even', 'Christ', 'given', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'form', 'message-delivering', 'billboard', 'being', 'heavy-handed', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'quite', 'possibly', 'leave', 'there', 'several', 'days', 'later']",Saved!

In some ways it is...but...we all laugh (Christians included) at movies that make fun of married people, singles, races, religions, ethnicity, occupations, etc. Thus, Christians shouldn't take such an offense when made fun of in return.The simple fact that this movie highlights some of the attitudes and actions of Christians and blows them out of proportion through exaggeration is typical comedy. No surprise there. That there is truth in these ""jokes"" shouldn't get Christians upset but allow for introspection in asking, ""Why do we do such things?""Yes, there are the blatant off-beat messages that are either the writer's own personal agenda or simply stating a ""worldly"" misconception:1) There are no absolutes, no black and white, it is all grey2) Homosexuality is a genetic disorder3) 99% of Christians are angry, fake, nerdy and judgmental4) That teens will be more infinitely equipped and mature to make the right decisions than any other adult around themLike most Disney movies that don't have a strong (or existent) mother characters or well behaved adolescent role models, this movie doesn't have real ""good"" examples of a Christian to boot. The closest good Christian is the character of Richard. But his role as a Christian took back seat to his role as a love interest between characters.The fact that a movie was made the way it was shows more of how the world in general has a skewed view of what it is to be a Christian and to be born-again. Again we are left with more introspection of what we as Christians do to propagate such thoughts and misconceptions about Christianity to others.In many ways I think this can be used as a great movie for parents to sit down and watch with their teens. The discussion topics are limitless, such as:1) How do you differentiate ""God's leading"" from that of your own desires?2) How can you be a real friend to someone when their lifestyle choices (i.e. homosexuals) are contradictory to what the Bible teaches?3) Why are so many ""non-Christians"" sent to Christian schools?4) What does the Bible really say about sex outside of marriage and are there ever any exceptions?5) If a divorce is in the process, is it ok to date others?6) How do you balance ""showing the love of Christ"" with the current trend of uber-tolerance that frowns on people who take a stand for what they believe?7) Are there any absolutes?This movie should be viewed prior to watching this with your kids because my sense of ""its ok"" may be at a different level than someone else's.Overall, I liked the movie for the number of topics it hits on, even if the topics are presented through the filter of misconception.

When something bad happens to you does that mean that you are 'out of God's will'?  Why isn't the pastor sent away to a camp because of his sexual sin?  Why just the gay guy? Why didn't anyone question Hilary's (Mandy Moore's character) angry outbursts and rudeness before they found out that she framed Mary and the other girl?My last question is, why is it that it is 'speaking out against sin' for Christian groups like Focus on the Family to critisize anyone who disagrees with them but they are suffering 'persecution' because of this movie and other groups speak out against them?I have met Christians like the ones in Saved!, and I don't understand at all where they are coming from.",4,This raises a lot of questions,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,924,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'write', 'review', 'really', 'liked', 'think', 'raise', 'good', 'questions', 'Christianity.Does', 'being', 'Christian', 'mean', 'have', 'pretend', 'are', 'perfect', 'When', 'something', 'bad', 'mean', 'are', 'God', 'will', 'Why', ""n't"", 'pastor', 'sent', 'away', 'camp', 'sexual', 'sin', 'Why', 'just', 'gay', 'guy', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'question', 'Hilary', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'angry', 'outbursts', 'rudeness', 'found', 'out', 'framed', 'Mary', 'other', 'girl', 'last', 'question', 'why', ""'speaking"", 'out', 'sin', 'Christian', 'groups', 'Focus', 'Family', 'critisize', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', ""'persecution"", 'movie', 'other', 'groups', 'speak', 'out', 'have', 'met', 'Christians', 'ones', 'Saved', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'coming']",Saved!

The movie shows that Christianity is a beautiful, meaningful religion but sometimes people try to push themselves and others too hard to accept their version of what they believe is right and ""Godly"".The first half is more bright and vivid and you feel the movie is going somewhere. The second half, the movie begins to slide. Personally, I thought that Mandy Moore did the best acting. She carries the film on her shoulders. I took off two stars because I thought the other actors were mediocre, the second half of the movie was ok and of course there has to be a ""prince"" who loves a girl even though she is pregnant and he takes her in a limo.I think this is a good movie to watch once.

But this is a comedy and since Greek times, comedies find their most pungent lines  in making fun of contentious ideas.The setting is a fundamentalist Christian Baptist Highschool where everyone in the student body is endlessly praising Jesus and God and stretching their modes of entertainment and socialization to focus on religious concepts.  Mary (!) (Jena Malone) is a sweet kid whose mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker) is off in her own world but supportive of her daughter who can do no wrong.  Mary eyes handsome athletic Dean (Chad Faust) who is gay and Mary 'sacrifices' her virginity to save Dean's sinful soul: they bed and she becomes pregnant, but only after Dean is sent away to a de-gaying Mercy Center.  The leader of the student body Jesus group is Hilary (Mandy Moore) who seeks to 'save' every lost soul, especially the sole Jewish 'ex-stripper' Cassandra (Eva Amurri - Susan Sarandon's talented daughter) who smokes, drinks, and seduces physically challenged, wheelchair bound Roland (Macaulay Culkin) who has been in Hilary's keeping.  This set of problems all come to various resolutions at the infamous Prom, just like in all the old movies of the forties.  But in the meantime no variation of normal goes unscathed: the disabled, out of wedlock pregnancies, gays, Jews, and all people outside fundamental religious beliefs (sound familiar?).While much of the script is clunky and the story irritating to people of open minds, there is some fine work by most of the actors.  It is a black comedy and if taken as such, it shouldn't seriously offend anyone - unless you choose to let it.

842400,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0002OXRSG,James D. Leverton,"[7, 12]","I must admit, when I saw ""Saved!"" in the theaters, I wasn't that impressed.  It was amusing, yes, but it just didn't slay me the way great comedies do.  But something about it stuck with me, so I bought it when it became available on DVD and have begun watching it regularly.  With each successive viewing it gets funnier and funnier until I now find myself quoting dialog and cracking up before things even happen.  I'm now convinced ""Saved!"" is one of the best films of 2004.A wicked satire of born-again Christianity, or the surface-level, shallow version that is so popular nowadays, ""Saved!"" centers on young Mary (Jena Malone), who became born-again at age 3 and attends a Christian high school run by a hipster named Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan).  Mary belongs to a clique called the ""Christian Jewels,"" led by the wicked Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), a pampered princess who uses her religion as a source of power she wields over one and all, especially her wheelchair-bound brother Roland (McCauley Culkin).  Hilary Faye's chief rival is the school's rebel, and token ""Jewish,"" Cassandra (Susan Sarandon's beautiful daughter Eva Amurri), who delights in tormenting Hilary Faye by being a rude, crude and foul-mouthed chain-smoker.  Rounding out the cast is Mary's mother (Mary Louise Parker), who recently was named the region's top ""Christian Interior Decorator,"" and Pastor Skip's easygoing son Patrick (Patrick Fugit), who just returned from a missionary trip with other Christian ""Skateboarders for Christ.""  Oh, yes, and then there's Mary's boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust), who sets the plot in motion by telling Mary he's gay.  When Mary decides to ""cure"" Dean by seducing him, disaster strikes:  Dean is whisked away to a rehabilitation clinic called Mercy House (after his parents find his stash of gay skin magazines) and Mary ends up pregnant, which causes her to lose her faith and question Hilary Faye's sincerity as a Christian when Hilary Faye (against Mary's wishes) organizes a prayer vigil for Dean.  (Hilary Faye to Mary:  ""You're born again, not born a gay."")  The two friends then have a serious falling out and Mary is befriended by Cassandra, who has begun dating Roland.  She is also pursued by the amiable Patrick, who has a giant crush on her.  And then there's a subplot involving Mary's mother, who has begun dating Pastor Skip--Buoyed by witty dialog and genuinely funny situations, ""Saved!"" is expertly directed by co-writer Brian Dannelly, who gets uniformly excellent performances from his young cast.  The obvious standout is Amurri.  She is hilarious as the crude and obnoxious Cassandra, who reveals a surprisingly tender side that belies her tough exterior.  In fact, she becomes a much better friend to Mary than Hilary Faye ever was.  Amurri even has the single funniest scene in the movie, in which she feigns ""speaking in tongues"" at a school assembly.  And Culkin, who bombed badly in his adult comeback film ""Party Monster,"" redeems himself with a very funny, wry performance that is immensely appealing.  Fugit is pitch-perfect as a kid of real faith who is also open and accepting of people who are different than he is, and Faust has a few funny moments as the hapless Dean, who is in Roland's words ""a one-man gay pride parade.""  Parker and Donovan perform with the effortless ease of old pros and Heather Mattarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"") is amusing as a ""Christian Jewels"" wannabe.As for Mandy Moore, she is surprisingly good as the villain of the piece.  Hilary Faye is hypocritical, mean-spirited, judgmental, self-centered, loud and obnoxious, and seems to think being a Christian gives her a ticket to run roughshod over everyone around her.  (Her scene at a shooting range is a riot.)  Thankfully, Moore doesn't overplay this little gem of a role; in fact, I don't think she could have played it better.And then there's Jena Malone, who is simply the best young actress working in films today.  Her Mary is a total delight, and she carries the film on her shoulders like an old pro.  She's going to be around a long, long time.Some Christians will undoubtedly be offended by ""Saved!,"" and that's too bad, because it's not Christianity that's being satirized here, but hypocrisy and the tendency of today's Christian crowd to use their religion as a weapon against others instead of using it to make the world a better, more peaceful and loving place.  But then again, if someone is offended, then the truth must hurt.""Saved!"" is presented in a widescreen, 1:85:1 print from MGM/UA home video that offers the following extras:  bloopers, extra scenes, a standard behind-the-scenes featurette that was undoubtedly the same promotional feature sent to theater owners, and trailers.  The bloopers are lame, the extra scenes add nothing (which is undoubtedly why they were cut) and the featurette is as vacuous as anything you'll see on Entertainment Tonight.  So count me among the unimpressed.  The verdict:  feature rates a ****1/2 (out of *****) while the extras get a yawn and **.",4,Gets funnier with each viewing,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,5040,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'saw', 'Saved',

842401,A24D0DENA8N7GH,B0002OXRSG,James Sadler,"[6, 8]","I remember when this film was released there was strong backlash against it by conservatives and it never got much in the way of promotion from the studio. Too bad, because it ought to be must viewing for all Christians (and even most non-Christians).I've read through some, but not all of the reviews to date. Most are positive about the film, but I came across more than few that were negative. One reviewer even referred to it as ""Disgusting!""And I can tell you why that reviewer said that. Because this film turns a mirror on the hypocrisy that far too many Christians engage in, espousing ""love and forgiveness"" out of one side of their mouth while breathing ""hate and vitriol"" out of the other.But, back to our film. In a nutshell, Mary is a devout Christian who learns her boyfriend is gay. For reasons best explained by watching the film, she believes Jesus wishes for her to have intercourse with her boyfriend to make him straight. Naturally it doesn't work and backfire when it turns out that her first and only encounter with sex has resulted in her being pregnant.From there the film follows her travails as she tries to hide her pregnancy but has her eyes opened to the fact that the world isn't as black-and-white as she once thought. In fact, it's filled with a lot of gray.As is often the case in this type of film, the bad kids at the school turn out to be the good guys and the school's supposed good kids are either bad or just blindly following the lead of others. And as you might expect, everyone learns a lot about tolerance and the true meaning of Christianity by the end of the film.In fact, in its rush to have a nice, tidy happy ending, the film has its only real failing - everyone pretty much gets a happy ending. It's even alluded to that Mandy Moore's character, who is obstensively the villain, has had her eyes opened to a less closed mind view of Christianity.The film is filled with humor, actually rarely at the expense of anyone, and rye observations on the viewpoints of conservative Christians. As a Christian myself, I have to say I am frequently bothered by how closed minded so many conservatives are ( a problem that is growing and being fed by the current political environment in our country).It features a minister who could easily be turned into a caricature, but thanks to good acting and an intelligent script, it deftly sidesteps that potential pot hole. The preacher is one all Christians encounter at one time in their lives, the minister trying very hard to be ""cool."" But this is a minister with a few problems of his own, and the film doesn't allow him to descend into being yet another windbag preacher that we can all make fun of and judge harshly for his actions.All of the acting is first rate. In her role as Hilary, Mandy Moore is gloriously the pain-in-the-arse popular girl that haunts every high school in American; and Jena Malone deftly maneuvers from a simple, devout young girl to a young woman who questions her faith and ultimately reaffirms it.You'll love the ending, but in hindsight you'll probably feel (as I did), it ends a little too neatly.Like I said, this should be must viewing for all Christians. It won't be. And many of those conservative types who see it will decide it's a ""Hollywood"" attack on both their religion and their values. It's not, but it won't be the first time that a closed-mind group fails to ""get the logs"" out of their eyes and see the truth (for you non-Christians, the ""logs"" comment is a Biblical reference).",5,Aims High and Nealry Hits the Mark,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,3514,"['remember', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'strong', 'backlash', 'conservatives', 'never', 'got', 'much', 'way', 'promotion', 'studio', 'Too', 'bad', 'ought', 'be', 'must', 'viewing', 'Christians', 'even', 'most', 'non-Christians', '.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'reviews', 'date', 'Most', 'are', 'positive', 'film', 'came', 'more', 'few', 'were', 'negative', 'One', 'reviewer', 'even', 'referred', 'Disgusting', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'mirror', 'hypocrisy', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'Christians', 'engage', 'espousing', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'one', 'side', 'mouth', 'breathing', 'hate', 'vitriol', 'other.But', 'back', 'film', 'nutshell', 'Mary', 'devout', 'Christian', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'gay', 'reasons', 'best', 'explained', 'watching', 'film', 'Jesus', 'wishes', 'have', 'intercourse', 'boyfriend', 'make', 'straight', 'Naturally', ""n't"", 'work', 'backfire', 'when', 'out', 'first', 'only', 'encounter', 'sex', 'resulted', 'being', 'film', 'travails', 'hide', 'pregnancy', 'eyes', 'opened', 'fact', 'world', ""n't"", 'as', 'black-and-white', 'once', 'thought', 'fact', 'filled', 'lot', 'gray.As', 'often', 'case', 'type', 'film', 'bad', 'kids', 'school', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'school', 'supposed', 'good', 'kids', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'blindly', 'following', 'lead', 'others', 'might', 'expect', 'everyone', 'lot', 'tolerance', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christianity', 'end', 'film.In', 'fact', 'rush', 'have', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'failing', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'happy', 'ending', 'even', 'alluded', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'who', 'obstensively', 'villain', 'had', 'eyes', 'opened', 'less', 'closed', 'mind', 'view', 'Christianity.The', 'film', 'filled', 'humor', 'actually', 'rarely', 'expense', 'anyone', 'rye', 'observations', 'viewpoints', 'conservative', 'Christians', 'Christian', 'myself', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'frequently', 'bothered', 'how', 'closed', 'minded', 'so', 'many', 'conservatives', 'are', 'problem', 'growing', 'being', 'fed', 'current', 'political', 'environment', 'country', 'minister', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'turned', 'caricature', 'thanks', 'good', 'acting', 'intelligent', 'script', 'deftly', 'potential', 'pot', 'hole', 'preacher', 'one', 'Christians', 'encounter', 'one', 'time', 'lives', 'minister', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'minister', 'few', 'problems', 'own', 'film', ""n't"", 'allow', 'descend', 'being', 'yet', 'windbag', 'preacher', 'can', 'make', 'fun', 'judge', 'harshly', 'actions.All', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'role', 'Hilary', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'gloriously', 'pain-in-the-arse', 'popular', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'American', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'deftly', 'simple', 'young', 'girl', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'questions', 'faith', 'ultimately', 'it.You', ""'ll"", 'love', 'ending', 'hindsight', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'did', 'little', 'too', 'neatly.Like', 'said', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'viewing', 'Christians', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'many', 'conservative', 'types', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'decide', 'Hollywood', 'attack', 'religion', 'values', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'time', 'closed-mind', 'group', 'get', 'logs', 'eyes', 'see', 'truth', 'non-Christians', 'logs', 'comment', 'Biblical', 'reference']",Saved!

You have the main character, a pregnant teenager (her reasoning behind getting pregnant is hillarious!).  Her boyfriend who is desperate need of saving in most of the characters eyes.  Her mother whos constantly changing her hair color or something else to regain her youth.  A Jew.  A cripple who doesnt really consider himself a Christian.  The new kid in school who just happens to be the principals son. An uber Christian whos a bit crazy really, and her two hang ons.  Gee i think i got everybody...The point is, youd think this many characters would make it hard to develop most of them well.  But somehow they do.  Each character is unique and has their own story to tell, which does get told.  The basic story is personal faith versus public faith.  What each person thinks is right and how the Christian public says theyre right or wrong.  Everyone ends up going through thier own personal revelations as their beliefs get pushed and shoved.A very thought provoking movie.  Devout Christians, if they can get past the farce this movie makes of people who just blindly believe what is hand fed to them, probably will have trouble with the last part.  ###Basically one of the stands the film makes is that Jesus loves gay people too, so that would be hard for many people to swallow.###Even those who ARE devout in their faith should check this movie out.

I tend to like movies about high school when they bring back memories of my own teen years, and this movie is very remniscent of the atmosphere at my high school.  The pressure on students to conform to a specific interpretation of Christianity is very familiar, and - in a very satisfying way - ""SAVED!"" takes this issue and runs with it.  The movie is clever, funny, and for me, quite cathartic.The acting is outstanding.  My favorite performances are not from the two lead actresses - even though they are both great.  I like Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's real-life daughter)best. She plays the lone Jewish classmate that everyone wants to ""save"".  The scene where she is pretending to speak in tongues is worth the price of the DVD.  Macaulay Culkin does a very convincing job playing a free thinker who doesn't accept the company line.  Hopefully, for Macaulay this is a successful step back into starring movie roles.  Finally, I adored (sublimely sexy) Patrick Fugit (from ""Almost Famous"") because of the way his character balances the whole movie.

If you like coming of age comedies, and you are not a very sensitive member of the religious right, you will like it.  If you have been a victim of overzealous evangelicals, you will love it.

842410,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0002OXRSG,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","A film by Brian DannellyThe movie ""Saved!"" is a potentially controversial movie that just sort of slipped under the radar when it was released in theatres.  At first glance, and without putting any thought into what the movie is actually saying, it would seem that ""Saved!"" is absolutely savaging the Christian community.  The Christians in the film come off as hypocritical fools (at best) and the sympathetic characters are those with anti-Christian behaviors.  But that is only the candy coating on ""Saved!""  The heart of the picture has to do with a portion of the Christian sub-culture which shows a public veneer of popular Christianity but has none of the heart or the message of what Christ taught.  That is what ""Saved!"" is truly lampooning.Mary (Jena Malone) is a senior at a very Christian high school in a very Christian town.  Everything in her world is protected by the ""Christian"" label, from the music she listens to the Christian home decorators, and so on.  The only thing that does not fit into her Christian world is her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust), who has recently come out to her that he is gay.  Since this is an affront to everything she knows and believes in, and she knows that God does not want him to be gay, Mary believes that Jesus wants her to sleep with him to de-gayify Chad.  She does, and it doesn't.  He is sent away to Mercy House, which is intended to get him the ""help he needs"".  What comes out of this first encounter is that Mary becomes pregnant.She does not know this at first, of course, so Mary slides into her life in high school where she is friends with the uber-Christian Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore).  Hillary Faye is over the top Christian, but filled with bitterness which she takes out on her brother, Roland (Macaulay Culkin).  Roland has been crippled since childhood and is wheelchair bound.  When the Jewish Cassandra (Eva Amurri) begins school as the only Jew in the Christian high school, Hillary Faye makes it her personal mission to aggressively ""save"" Cassandra's soul.Initially, Cassandra is the outcast in Mary's eyes but as her pregnancy becomes more pronounced she becomes closer to Cassandra because Cassandra is the only person who would not judge Mary.  Funny how that works.  As the movie continues we see the conflict between Hillary Faye, who has turned her back on Mary when Mary questions her attitude, and the outcasts (Mary, Roland, Cassandra).  The movie builds, showing Hillary Faye's behavior to be increasingly anti-Christian with perhaps the film's signature scene having Hillary Faye angrily yell ""I am filled with Christ's love"" as she throws a Bible at Mary's back.  Mary had questioned whether Hillary Faye knew what love was.The ending of ""Saved!"" is somewhat over the top, but the portrayal of the Christian sub-culture is only somewhat exaggerated.  Having gone to a Christian college I know that the characters in ""Saved!"" are distorted portrayals of actual people.  The movie exaggerates the behavior, but these are very familiar situations and images and lines of dialogue to me.  But, that is what this film is discussing, and perhaps exposing.  The fakeness that some people can have when the cling so hard to the image of what a ""good Christian"" looks like that they lose sight of what it truly means to be a Christian and about the love that is central to the message of Christ.""Saved!"" is a movie that has a lot of heart and hopefully will find a home and a following on DVD.  This is a smartly written and well acted movie (especially Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin), and one that is worth seeing.-Joe Sherry",5,very well done skewering of the Christian subculture,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,3606,"['film', 'Brian', 'DannellyThe', 'movie', 'Saved', 'potentially', 'controversial', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'slipped', 'radar', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'first', 'glance', 'putting', 'thought', 'what', 'movie', 'actually', 'saying', 'would', 'seem', 'Saved', 'absolutely', 'savaging', 'Christian', 'community', 'Christians', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'hypocritical', 'fools', 'best', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'are', 'anti-Christian', 'behaviors', 'only', 'candy', 'coating', 'Saved', 'heart', 'picture', 'do', 'portion', 'Christian', 'sub-culture', 'public', 'veneer', 'popular', 'Christianity', 'none', 'heart', 'message', 'what', 'Christ', 'taught', 'what', 'Saved', 'truly', 'lampooning.Mary', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'senior', 'very', 'Christian', 'high', 'school', 'very', 'Christian', 'town', 'Everything', 'world', 'protected', 'Christian', 'label', 'music', 'Christian', 'home', 'decorators', 'so', 'only', 'thing', 'not', 'fit', 'Christian', 'world', 'boyfriend', 'Dean', 'Chad', 'Faust', 'who', 'recently', 'come', 'out', 'gay', 'affront', 'everything', 'God', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'gay', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'sleep', 'de-gayify', 'Chad', ""n't"", 'sent', 'away', 'Mercy', 'House', 'intended', 'get', 'help', 'What', 'out', 'first', 'encounter', 'Mary', 'pregnant.She', 'not', 'know', 'first', 'course', 'so', 'Mary', 'slides', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'friends', 'uber-Christian', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'top', 'Christian', 'filled', 'bitterness', 'out', 'brother', 'Roland', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Roland', 'been', 'crippled', 'childhood', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'When', 'Jewish', 'Cassandra', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'school', 'only', 'Jew', 'Christian', 'high', 'school', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'personal', 'mission', 'aggressively', 'save', 'Cassandra', 'soul.Initially', 'Cassandra', 'outcast', 'Mary', 'eyes', 'pregnancy', 'more', 'pronounced', 'closer', 'Cassandra', 'Cassandra', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'judge', 'Mary', 'Funny', 'how', 'movie', 'see', 'conflict', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'who', 'turned', 'back', 'Mary', 'when', 'Mary', 'questions', 'attitude', 'outcasts', 'Mary', 'Roland', 'Cassandra', 'movie', 'builds', 'showing', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'behavior', 'be', 'increasingly', 'anti-Christian', 'perhaps', 'film', 'signature', 'scene', 'having', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'angrily', 'yell', 'am', 'filled', 'Christ', 'love', 'Bible', 'Mary', 'back', 'Mary', 'had', 'questioned', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'knew', 'what', 'love', 'was.The', 'ending', 'Saved', 'somewhat', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Christian', 'sub-culture', 'only', 'somewhat', 'exaggerated', 'Having', 'gone', 'Christian', 'college', 'know', 'characters', 'Saved', 'are', 'distorted', 'portrayals', 'actual', 'people', 'movie', 'behavior', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'situations', 'images', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'what', 'film', 'discussing', 'perhaps', 'exposing', 'fakeness', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'when', 'cling', 'so', 'hard', 'image', 'what', 'good', 'Christian', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', 'truly', 'be', 'Christian', 'love', 'central', 'message', 'Christ.', 'Saved', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'home', 'following', 'DVD', 'smartly', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'especially', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing.-Joe', 'Sherry']",Saved!

But even before the movie came out, I found that group of people to be particularly entertaining, anyway.There is a great line in this movie when the Mandy Moore (Hilary) character throws a Bible at the Jena Malone character (Mary) and Mary says to her, ""This isn't a weapon...""Wow. Wow oh wow oh wow...the Bible isn't a weapon and yet sooo many ""good"" Christians use it that way. They're all about being loving BUT they'll only love you if you believe EXACTLY like they do. They're all about forgiveness and compassion, but only after you grovel and beg for it. Now, I'm sure there are a lot of really wonderful Christians out there and if you're one of them drop me an email at.....what...did you honestly think I was gonna tell you? Yeah, sorry, guys but I did the ""saved"" things years ago...somehow I couldn't swallow it hook, line, and sinker.Don't get me wrong. I love Jesus. I love his teachings. I think his teachings could totally transform the world. I just don't think it was his intention to be worshipped. Now, I could be wrong but if Jesus was truly ""God"" why would he get upset with that person when he said, ""There is none good, but God alone."" Why wouldn't he have said, ""There is none good but me!""Jesus was Divine...but so are you...so am I...we don't need a religion to follow to be worthy. Afterall, God created us in ""His"" Image and Likeness. We are not human beings who are having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience. This is  a very spiritual movie. Its message  that everyone of us is redeemable is very powerful. That all ""sin"" is a mistake and we can always go to God for everything we could ever want or need no matter what because the divine has never ever once refused us. No matter if we're gay, or belong to another religion, or even if we don't belong to any religion. God is with us now and forever.So, rent this movie or better yet, buy it. If you are a fundamentalist and it ruffles your feathers, good! Maybe you need to question your beliefs. Maybe you need to just follow the two commandments of Jesus (1) Love God with all your mind, heart and soul and (2) Love your neighbor as yourself because your neighbor is an expresion of God no matter what he/she may appear to be.Spirit loves you...always has...always will...get this movie.",5,"Save Me from Your Followers, Jesus",1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,2559,"['Oh', 'what', 'great', 'great', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'born', 'again', 'Christians', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'redeemable', 'way', 'afterall', 'poking', 'fun', 'Christian', 'faith', 'epecially', 'born', 'agains', 'fundamentalists', 'even', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'group', 'people', 'be', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'great', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Hilary', 'character', 'Bible', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'her', ""n't"", 'weapon', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'oh', 'wow', 'oh', 'wow', 'Bible', ""n't"", 'weapon', 'yet', 'sooo', 'many', 'good', 'Christians', 'use', 'way', ""'re"", 'being', 'loving', 'BUT', ""'ll"", 'only', 'love', 'believe', 'EXACTLY', 'do', ""'re"", 'forgiveness', 'compassion', 'only', 'grovel', 'beg', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'really', 'wonderful', 'Christians', 'there', ""'re"", 'one', 'drop', 'email', '..what', 'did', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'tell', 'Yeah', 'sorry', 'guys', 'did', 'saved', 'things', 'years', 'ago', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'swallow', 'line', 'sinker.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Jesus', 'love', 'teachings', 'think', 'teachings', 'could', 'totally', 'transform', 'world', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intention', 'be', 'worshipped', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'Jesus', 'was', 'truly', 'God', 'why', 'would', 'get', 'upset', 'person', 'when', 'said', 'none', 'good', 'God', 'alone', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'none', 'good', 'Jesus', 'was', 'Divine', 'so', 'are', 'so', 'am', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'religion', 'follow', 'be', 'worthy', 'Afterall', 'God', 'created', 'Image', 'Likeness', 'are', 'not', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'are', 'spiritual', 'beings', 'having', 'human', 'experience', 'very', 'spiritual', 'movie', 'message', 'everyone', 'redeemable', 'very', 'powerful', 'sin', 'mistake', 'can', 'always', 'go', 'God', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'need', 'matter', 'what', 'divine', 'never', 'ever', 'once', 'refused', 'No', 'matter', ""'re"", 'gay', 'belong', 'religion', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'religion', 'God', 'now', 'forever.So', 'rent', 'movie', 'better', 'yet', 'buy', 'are', 'fundamentalist', 'feathers', 'good', 'Maybe', 'need', 'question', 'beliefs', 'Maybe', 'need', 'just', 'follow', 'two', 'commandments', 'Jesus', '1', 'Love', 'God', 'mind', 'heart', 'soul', '2', 'Love', 'neighbor', 'neighbor', 'expresion', 'God', 'matter', 'what', 'he/she', 'may', 'appear', 'be.Spirit', 'loves', 'always', 'always', 'will', 'get', 'movie']",Saved!

842414,A8QYINCRYLLG9,B0002OXRSG,Josh Aterovis,"[2, 2]","From all appearances, Mary is the epitome of the perfect Christian girl. She attends a Baptist high school; she sings in a Christian girl band (the Christian Jewels) with her friends, the snotty, holier-than-thou Hillary Faye and her ever-present sidekick Veronica; and she keeps a photo of her cute Christian boyfriend Dean in a ""True Love Waits"" picture frame. Mary's world comes crashing down one summer day in the backyard pool when Dean confesses that he thinks he might be gay. In her shock, Mary bangs her head and sinks to the bottom of the pool, prompting the nearby long-haired, bearded pool boy to dive to the rescue. While stunned, Mary ""sees"" a vision of Jesus swimming towards her. He tells her it is her responsibility save Dean. Confused and concerned for her boyfriend's soul, Mary decides that means having sex with him to turn him straight.The next thing she knows, Dean's parents have shipped him off to a ""degayification"" center and Mary finds herself pregnant. She tries to keep her pregnancy a secret, but news of Dean's homosexuality spreads like wildfire through the school thanks to Hillary Faye's insidious prayer group meeting for Dean's soul. Between hiding her secret and her anger at Hillary Faye's hypocrisy, Mary finds herself ostracized by those she thought were her friends. She finds support from unexpected sources, however--the school misfits: Cassandra, the lone Jew who gleefully rebels against everything Christian, and Roland, Hillary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother. The three outcasts band together, but Hillary Faye isn't finished with them yet.The movie is quality from start to finish. The script is sharp and deliciously witty, the direction is pitch-perfect, and the acting is top-notch. Jena Malone as Mary perfectly captures the navet&eacute;, confusion, and anger of a young girl caught in the whirlwind of a crisis of faith. Mandy Moore proves once again that she is a force to be reckoned with, playing Hillary Faye with a ruthless intensity. Macaulay Culkin as Roland steals his scenes with some of the movies best lines and sight gags. In fact, every actor in this movie brings a resonance of sincerity and believability to their characters, from Mary-Louise Parker as Mary's single mother, to Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) as Cassandra, to Heather Matarazzo as Tia, Mary's replacement in Hillary Faye's clique.Compared to the rest of the movie, I thought the ending was a little weak--sugary sweet and a little too pat--but the strong message comes through loud and clear anyway. It's a message of acceptance and finding your true family in unexpected places.Some people have seen Saved! as mean-spirited towards the Christian community, but I think those people are missing the true intention of the film. Having come from the world depicted in the movie, I can attest that there is no exaggeration involved. The movie is honest--brutally so at times--but never sinks to the level of simply making fun of Christians. If anything, I think it shows the struggle we all have in reconciling what our religion and our heart tells us--something that is all too often two different messages--and illustrates the true spirit of Christianity. The real theme of this movie is celebrating diversity, something I think we could all use a little more of.

If you'll excuse the pun.  The film follows a motley crew of high school misfits through their final year at a christian academy. The film focuses mainly on Jenna Malone's character who becomes pregnant after offering up her virginity in an effort to prevent her boyfriend from his ""spiritually toxic"" homosexuality.  Jenna plays this role flawlessly portraying the denial, anger, rejection, acceptance, and devastation of losing one's illusions regarding religion or anything else.  Mandy Moore does a surprisingly good job of playing the righteous but misguided leader of Jenna's circle - the Christian Jewels.

842416,A1RJGDN1AD2PNO,B0002OXRSG,Kevin Davis,"[8, 26]","Like other reviewers, I also attended a Baptist, evangelical Christian academy from kindergarten through 12th grade. My experience was nothing like that portrayed in this movie, which pushes its polemic with exaggerated characters who exhibit every stereotype of evangelicals that one can imagine. Of course, there are certainly hypocrites in such schools and churches, as every Christian can attest, but exceptions do not make the rule nor justify the message this movie intends to make.The story involves a girl who gets pregnant because she had sex with her boyfriend (with same-sex attraction) to make him straight. Her reason: Jesus told her to do it in order to help him. The boy is cast aside by his parents, and the girl, for fear of the same, hides her pregnancy from her classmates and mom (who, by the way, is having an affair with the pastor). The girl's close friend, Mandy Moore's character, is the quintessential evangelical stereotype -- self-righteous, condemnatory, fanatical, etc. The ""bad girl"" at the school and a handicap boy are the only ones who reach out to the pregnant girl (as does, eventually, the pastor's son, but only after essentially losing his faith). By the end of the movie, all the characters have lost their evangelical faith and embraced a warm, fuzzy sort of universalism/unitarianism where God affirms all of our diversity. Of course, there is some good in that (aside from the issue of homosexuality, which is more than a simple matter of either being born that way or choosing it) insofar as we are all broken and have no right to condemn others as if we are righteous before God on our own merit. Evangelicals do immense work in reaching out to pregnant teenagers (e.g., Jerry Falwell's crisis pregnancy center and maternity house), in addition to numerous other ministries (whether it be to the third world poor or the prisons of America). As well, ""conservatives"" have been found to give more and do more charitable work than ""liberals"" (see the book, 'Who Really Cares,' by Arthur Brooks). Of course, that would not be the impression gained from this movie. I appreciate the movie's intent to criticize blatant hypocrisy, but the full-scale attack on traditional Christianity is unfounded and only serves to foster stereotypes.",2,Unfair portrait of evangelical Christendom,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,2275,"['other', 'reviewers', 'also', 'attended', 'Baptist', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'academy', 'kindergarten', '12th', 'grade', 'experience', 'was', 'nothing', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'polemic', 'exaggerated', 'characters', 'who', 'exhibit', 'stereotype', 'evangelicals', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'course', 'are', 'certainly', 'hypocrites', 'such', 'schools', 'churches', 'Christian', 'can', 'attest', 'exceptions', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'rule', 'justify', 'message', 'movie', 'make.The', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnant', 'had', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'same-sex', 'attraction', 'make', 'straight', 'reason', 'Jesus', 'told', 'do', 'order', 'help', 'boy', 'cast', 'aside', 'parents', 'girl', 'fear', 'same', 'pregnancy', 'classmates', 'mom', 'who', 'way', 'having', 'affair', 'pastor', 'girl', 'close', 'friend', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'quintessential', 'evangelical', 'stereotype', 'self-righteous', 'condemnatory', 'fanatical', 'etc', 'bad', 'girl', 'school', 'handicap', 'boy', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'reach', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'eventually', 'pastor', 'son', 'only', 'essentially', 'losing', 'faith', 'end', 'movie', 'characters', 'have', 'lost', 'evangelical', 'faith', 'embraced', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'sort', 'universalism/unitarianism', 'where', 'God', 'diversity', 'course', 'good', 'aside', 'issue', 'homosexuality', 'more', 'simple', 'matter', 'being', 'born', 'way', 'choosing', 'insofar', 'are', 'broken', 'have', 'right', 'condemn', 'others', 'are', 'righteous', 'God', 'own', 'merit', 'Evangelicals', 'do', 'immense', 'work', 'reaching', 'out', 'pregnant', 'teenagers', 'e.g.', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'crisis', 'pregnancy', 'center', 'maternity', 'house', 'addition', 'numerous', 'other', 'ministries', 'be', 'third', 'world', 'poor', 'prisons', 'America', 'well', 'conservatives', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'give', 'more', 'do', 'more', 'charitable', 'work', 'liberals', 'see', 'book', 'Really', 'Cares', 'Arthur', 'Brooks', 'course', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'impression', 'gained', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'intent', 'criticize', 'blatant', 'hypocrisy', 'full-scale', 'attack', 'traditional', 'Christianity', 'unfounded', 'only', 'serves', 'foster', 'stereotypes']",Saved!
842417,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0002OXRSG,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[9, 12]","Sometimes the truth can hurt.  In ""Saved!,"" fundamentalist Christians get a healthy dose of this fact.  Now before somebody jumps on me for attacking Christians, let me tell you that I grew up in a fundamental home.  When I went to college I became a ""Bible-thumper"" for a couple of years.  I'm not saying that that is a terrible thing, I'm just saying that many Christians, especially younger ones, can take their beliefs to an extreme level that not only discourages others into finding out about their faith, but can run people off completely.  I did the exact same thing whenever I got caught up in the Bible-study groups and the youth concerts.  I spouted ""truths"" that I had no basis for.  I attacked the heathens who didn't believe what I thought was the truth.  But when I started to take a hard look at my faith, I noticed that there are some things that can cause a rift between ""good"" Christians and those who go against the grain.  I was given the cold shoulder for some of my beliefs, which I now came to through the use of the Bible and not just what I was told by my so-called friends.I saw a lot of similarities in the characters portrayed in ""Saved!"" in myself during my college years, as well as in many of the people that I have interacted with during my life.  Mandy Moore's character is, unfortunately, one of the most realistic characters in this film.  She might have good intentions, but behind her fake front is a multitude of failures, weaknesses, and selfishness.  I would lose count trying to figure out how many people I know like her character.  Jena Malone's character reminded me a lot of myself in college.  I trusted everything that I was told until I made a decision on my own.  Granted, it wasn't a decision as extreme as hers to help turn a gay boy into a straight one, but it was a decision that alienated me from many of the people that I had befriended.  I chose to become Catholic.  Other than being a Satan worshipper, becoming Catholic is probably one of the worst things that a kid growing up Baptist can do.  Macauley Culkin turned in a grand performance as Moore's wheel-chair bound brother.  He seemed to be the most level-headed kid out of the bunch.  The ""only Jewish kid at the school"" represented, to me, all of the people on the outside looking in who can't understand what all of this is about.  Unfortunately, these types of people usually get confronted by people like Moore's character, who can do a great deal of damage.In the end, all of the characters presented in this film give us an extreme glimpse at fundamentalists and the way people see them in real life.  The sad thing is that this is an accurate portrayal of a lot of these people.  The only character who is a little out of whack is the preacher's son.  In my experience, these kids are usually the most dysfunctional in a fundamentalist church.  In this film, I think the preacher's son represents the average fundamentalist, who isn't out to force their beliefs on people, but wants everyone to know where they stand.  He's a good person, and I honestly think that most fundamentalists are like this.I'm willing to bet that most extreme fundamentalists will write this film off as a hateful and mean look at their people without even watching the entire film.  They'll say that only heathens will enjoy this movie and that it sends the wrong message to today's youth.  These are the same people who believe that Harry Potter is the devil and that heavy metal played backwards leads to suicide.  The fact is that this movie shows us the good and bad of fundamentalists and that they have problems just like everyone else.  I'll agree with another reviewer that the film does try to impress some worldly views on people, but I think that the overall message of this flick outweighs those views.  So what is that message?  Love one another.Highly recommended, but if you are a fundamentalist, you'll have to be ready to take a truth pill while watching this one.",4,The Truth Shall Set You Free,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,3981,"['Sometimes', 'truth', 'can', 'hurt', 'Saved', 'fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'get', 'healthy', 'dose', 'fact', 'Now', 'somebody', 'jumps', 'attacking', 'Christians', 'let', 'tell', 'grew', 'up', 'fundamental', 'home', 'When', 'went', 'college', 'became', 'Bible-thumper', 'couple', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'terrible', 'thing', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'many', 'Christians', 'especially', 'younger', 'ones', 'can', 'take', 'beliefs', 'extreme', 'level', 'not', 'only', 'others', 'finding', 'out', 'faith', 'can', 'run', 'people', 'off', 'completely', 'did', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'whenever', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'Bible-study', 'groups', 'youth', 'concerts', 'spouted', 'truths', 'had', 'basis', 'attacked', 'heathens', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'truth', 'when', 'started', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'faith', 'noticed', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'cause', 'rift', 'good', 'Christians', 'who', 'go', 'grain', 'was', 'given', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'beliefs', 'now', 'came', 'use', 'Bible', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'so-called', 'friends.I', 'saw', 'lot', 'similarities', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Saved', 'college', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'interacted', 'life', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'characters', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'fake', 'front', 'multitude', 'failures', 'weaknesses', 'selfishness', 'would', 'lose', 'count', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'character', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'reminded', 'lot', 'college', 'trusted', 'everything', 'was', 'told', 'made', 'decision', 'own', 'Granted', 'was', ""n't"", 'decision', 'as', 'extreme', 'hers', 'help', 'turn', 'gay', 'boy', 'straight', 'one', 'was', 'decision', 'alienated', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'befriended', 'chose', 'become', 'Catholic', 'Other', 'being', 'Satan', 'worshipper', 'becoming', 'Catholic', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'things', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'Baptist', 'can', 'do', 'Macauley', 'Culkin', 'turned', 'grand', 'performance', 'Moore', 'wheel-chair', 'bound', 'brother', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'level-headed', 'kid', 'bunch', 'only', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'school', 'represented', 'people', 'outside', 'looking', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'about', 'Unfortunately', 'types', 'people', 'usually', 'get', 'confronted', 'people', 'Moore', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'damage.In', 'end', 'characters', 'presented', 'film', 'give', 'extreme', 'glimpse', 'fundamentalists', 'way', 'people', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'sad', 'thing', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'lot', 'people', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'little', 'whack', 'preacher', 'son', 'experience', 'kids', 'are', 'usually', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'fundamentalist', 'church', 'film', 'think', 'preacher', 'son', 'average', 'fundamentalist', 'who', ""n't"", 'out', 'force', 'beliefs', 'people', 'everyone', 'know', 'where', 'stand', 'good', 'person', 'honestly', 'think', 'most', 'fundamentalists', 'are', 'this.I', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'most', 'extreme', 'fundamentalists', 'will', 'write', 'film', 'off', 'hateful', 'mean', 'look', 'people', 'even', 'watching', 'entire', 'film', ""'ll"", 'say', 'only', 'heathens', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'wrong', 'message', 'today', 'youth', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'devil', 'heavy', 'metal', 'played', 'backwards', 'suicide', 'fact', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'fundamentalists', 'have', 'problems', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'reviewer', 'film', 'try', 'impress', 'worldly', 'views', 'people', 'think', 'overall', 'message', 'flick', 'outweighs', 'views', 'what', 'message', 'Love', 'one', 'another.Highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'fundamentalist', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'ready', 'take', 'truth', 'pill', 'watching', 'one']",Saved!

She is then ostracized from her peer group of unChristian Christians, at which point the story becomes a morality play as well as juvenile comedy.At one point in the film Mary stands before the cross and utters profanities to it, her admission that she tried to do the Christian thing and it resulted in her world going into an abyss of misery, confusion and the frightful unknown instead of absolution. Her role in this movie is the portrayal of every Christian that is hidebound to carry out their learned beahvior while simultaneously living their life as a human and sinner on our planet.A cast of fine actors incluidng Macaulay Culkin and Martin Donovan contribute to this funny, touching and intimate look at life in a Christian school where all is not as moral and orderly as it appears. It gets a bit formulaic at the end but still succeeds as comedy, morality play and entertainment.What makes this film sensational is how closely the script mimics the real life of most Christians, who try to do what they're taught but somehow end up doing the human thing instead.

842420,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002OXRSG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 8]","The flaw in ""Saved!"" is that in the end Brian Dannelly's film wants to argue that the problem with evangelical Christians is that of hypocrisy. It does not matter that this hypocrisy is embodied by a single character in the film, the holier than thou, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), because it is clear Dannelly is going after all such true believers. But Hilary Faye's problem is not that she is Christian; what is wrong with her is that she is another teenage girl, the Queen Bee of her particular hornets nest, who loves to lord it over everyone in her domain. As far as Hilary Faye is concerned, Jesus is just another club that she can wield in exerting her will at the Christian school they attend (Yes, the minister in the movie is also something of a hypocrite, but for the most part the adults in this film are like those in a ""Peanuts"" cartoon, just making noise while the small fry have it out).Fortunately, where ""Saved!"" is different from other films in the ""Mean Girls"" tradition is that while Hilary Faye veers off into caricature despite Moore's captivating performance, the rest of the cast consists of some of the more realistic characters in this type of film. The focal point of the movie is Mary (Jenna Malone), who we meet at the bottom of the local swimming pool where she and her boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust), are exchanging secrets underwater. However, Mary was not expecting Dean to announce that he thinks he is gay. Because of a bang on the head Mary has a vision of Jesus and becomes convinced that what he wants is for her to save Dean, which she can do by having sex with him, at which point he will realize that he is not gay, and as a reward Jesus will restore her virginity. This hypothesis becomes moot when Mary becomes pregnant and Dean is sent off to a place where he can be deprogrammed into being straight.Mary is fated to be an outcast because of her pregnancy, so she gets a head start on her fate by becoming friends with those already ostracized, courtesy of Hilary Faye. That includes Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the only Jewish girl at the school, Roland (Macaulay Culkin), Hilary Faye's wheelchair bound brother), and Patrick (Patrick Fugit), the skateboarding son of the school's principal, Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan). Although Cassandra and Roland have their over the top moments, especially in regards to Hilary Faye and her small circle of friends, the relationships that spring up between these characters seem a lot more realistic than we usually see in movies about teenagers. Of course the big joke is that they are not fanatical Christians like the rest of the kids in school (which does not mean that they might not be better Christians, although that is something everyone who watches this movie can decide for themselves).It is not like this film is subtle about making its points: the main character's name is Mary.  There are some shades of gray here, but the battle lines in ""Saved!"" are drawn in such black and white terms early on that you might not notice there are such shadings to be seen.  When Hilary Faye and her disciples try to exorcise Mary back into the fold I see it as a statement of the weird way teenagers think and not as a reason to castigate religious belief.  The more ""Saved!"" wants to be about religion, the more I end up reading it as being more of a traditional teenage film, which is why the standout characters end up being the teenage boys more than the girls because for once they are not the total jerks that teenager boys invariable tend to be in this genre.",4,Imagine being an unwed mother in a Christian high school,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,3543,"['flaw', 'Saved', 'end', 'Brian', 'Dannelly', 'film', 'argue', 'problem', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'hypocrisy', 'not', 'matter', 'hypocrisy', 'embodied', 'single', 'character', 'film', 'holier', 'thou', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'clear', 'Dannelly', 'going', 'such', 'true', 'believers', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'problem', 'not', 'Christian', 'what', 'wrong', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'particular', 'hornets', 'nest', 'who', 'lord', 'over', 'everyone', 'domain', 'As', 'far', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'concerned', 'Jesus', 'just', 'club', 'can', 'wield', 'exerting', 'will', 'Christian', 'school', 'attend', 'Yes', 'minister', 'movie', 'also', 'something', 'hypocrite', 'most', 'part', 'adults', 'film', 'are', 'Peanuts', 'cartoon', 'just', 'making', 'noise', 'small', 'fry', 'have', 'out', '.Fortunately', 'where', 'Saved', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'tradition', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'veers', 'off', 'caricature', 'Moore', 'captivating', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'more', 'realistic', 'characters', 'type', 'film', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'who', 'meet', 'bottom', 'local', 'swimming', 'pool', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'Dean', 'Chad', 'Faust', 'are', 'exchanging', 'secrets', 'underwater', 'However', 'Mary', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'Dean', 'announce', 'gay', 'bang', 'head', 'Mary', 'vision', 'Jesus', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'what', 'save', 'Dean', 'can', 'do', 'having', 'sex', 'point', 'will', 'realize', 'not', 'gay', 'reward', 'Jesus', 'will', 'restore', 'virginity', 'hypothesis', 'moot', 'when', 'Mary', 'pregnant', 'Dean', 'sent', 'off', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'deprogrammed', 'being', 'straight.Mary', 'fated', 'be', 'outcast', 'pregnancy', 'head', 'start', 'fate', 'becoming', 'friends', 'already', 'ostracized', 'courtesy', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'Cassandra', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'only', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'school', 'Roland', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'wheelchair', 'brother', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'skateboarding', 'son', 'school', 'principal', 'Pastor', 'Skip', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'Cassandra', 'Roland', 'have', 'top', 'moments', 'especially', 'regards', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'small', 'circle', 'friends', 'relationships', 'spring', 'up', 'characters', 'seem', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'usually', 'see', 'movies', 'teenagers', 'course', 'big', 'joke', 'are', 'not', 'fanatical', 'Christians', 'rest', 'kids', 'school', 'not', 'mean', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'Christians', 'something', 'everyone', 'who', 'movie', 'can', 'decide', '.It', 'not', 'film', 'subtle', 'making', 'points', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'Mary', 'are', 'shades', 'gray', 'here', 'battle', 'lines', 'Saved', 'are', 'drawn', 'such', 'black', 'white', 'terms', 'early', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'are', 'such', 'shadings', 'be', 'seen', 'When', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'disciples', 'try', 'exorcise', 'Mary', 'back', 'fold', 'see', 'statement', 'weird', 'way', 'teenagers', 'think', 'not', 'reason', 'castigate', 'religious', 'belief', 'more', 'Saved', 'be', 'religion', 'more', 'end', 'up', 'reading', 'being', 'more', 'traditional', 'teenage', 'film', 'why', 'standout', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'teenage', 'more', 'girls', 'once', 'are', 'not', 'total', 'jerks', 'teenager', 'invariable', 'tend', 'be', 'genre']",Saved!

842426,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0002OXRSG,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[0, 7]","Saved! is a brilliantly biting satire about students at a strict Chrisitian high school and how they deal with the unwanted pregnancy of one of their prized students. It is brutal, honest, funny, and intense. The cast is simply amazing. Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Patrick Fugit, and Eva Amurri are all superb and it's great seeing Macaulay Culkin back in more adult roles (also see Party Monster). Mary-Louise Parker is fantastic as well, as always in her supporting roles. This is by far the perfect dream cast for any independent film. I think lots of people will be looking at Mandy Moore differently from now on, whether it be for better or for worse.As a gay Christian not accepted by his family, I can definitely relate to this film, and honestly say that none of it is exaggeration. All these people exist and they are all people I know. My friends and I really enjoyed the film because it definitely hit close to home and was something we could laugh at and also discuss seriously. Yes, the film is played for laughs, but it is also a very serious topic that really makes you think about society and the ridiculous expectations they have. All the situations in the film ring true with an emotional depth rarely seen in teen films. None of the events will seem off the wall to anyone familiar with modern adolescence or this particular religious subculture. Scary, isn't it?The film definitely made me think about what this world is coming to and how people so devoted to GOD fail to accept anyone who is a little different. As one of the characters said toward the end, GOD loves us all and that is something people should understand, but choose not to. It's ridiculous and this film explores that well.Compared to the rest of the film, the ending is a bit weak but it was compensated for by the main message of the film, which is acceptance of people and their differences (and this includes acceptance of Christian Fundamentalists). The film is not a mean-spirited parody; but while it pokes fun at some extreme examples of Christian Fundamentalism, it doesn't make anyone out to be a villain and it doesn't have an anti-Christian message despite what so many people think. People who think that Jews, gays, and unwed mothers need to be saved instead of accepted probably won't enjoy the message of this film, but they just need to deal with it.I commend everyone involved in the film. It is a movie that needed to be made and I am so glad it was. Many people will hate it, many will oppose it, but everyone should see it, because this is exactly how the world we live in is.

842427,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B0002OXRSG,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[6, 8]","This teen drama is set against the inventively hilarious background of a Christian community in which the main characters struggle to reconcile their actions with their faith; in some cases, their faith is subverted by the types of high school social politics that are the focus of so many other teen movies.Mandy Moore is fiercely cheerful and devout as the popular and powerful student who loves Jesus the most, and who uses her faith like a weapon to keep other students in line. McCaulay Culkin plays her wheelchair-bound brother, who is ejected from Moore's inner circle when he falls in love with the school's lone rebellious Jewish student. Jena Malone is similarly ostracized when she gets pregnant and disillusioned (after hitting her head, she sees a vision of Jesus telling her to have sex with her gay boyfriend in order to convert him to heterosexuality).Viewing the sometimes-affected and sometimes-sincere attention to worship is extremely funny, and those scenes are the ones in which the movie makes a genuine unique contribution. The actors all do a terrific job; Malone seems younger and more baby-faced than she has in previous roles, and Moore reminds us of the Reese Witherspoon character in Election (in a good way). Culkin's quirky character is interesting, but nothing about his performance can distract us from how little his features have changed since his Home Alone role.Unfortunately, after a promising beginning, the movie moves inexorably towards a wholly predictable ending, involving a comeuppance for the class snob at the annual prom.

842429,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0002OXRSG,M. Burns,"[0, 4]","I'm awesome. When playing basketball with my cousin, I whip out all my moves - dribbling right past his outstretched arms, whipping around him in circles, and then flying over his head when I touch the sky and nearly break the rim when I slam dunk the ball in. Oh wait, sorry, my cousin's seven years old and it's a little Fisher Price basketball hoop. My bad, I didn't tell you that he's an easy target and it requires no effort on my part whatsoever. Kind of like the writing that must have gone into what critics are calling the Anti-Passion.And it's pretty clear that Saved! isn't going to be breaking any satirical ground right in the film's first moments: an excruciatingly awful, teeny-bopper rendition of maybe the greatest rock song ever written, ""God Only Knows."" So I wasn't expecting much after that, let me tell you. Cue: Mary's (Jena Malone) narration, the setup that she lives among a throng of Christian zealots and has been brought up as one, and off we are on a steady roll (for nearly the film's entire first act) of low blows and potshots to Christianity that aren't even funny for the most part. Pick a part of Christian worship and Saved! lampoons it - the invitation to 'accept Jesus,' the praise-and-worship tunes, even prayer. So let me warn you: if stuff like this easily offends you, brace yourself. I'm a pretty liberal movie-goer and even I was checking the exits. But why?Well, much like Dogville by Lars von Trier (a movie I strongly disliked whereas, as you'll read on, I ended up being lukewarm about this one), the entire crux of Saved!s setup is based on a stereotype. In Dogville's case, it was that all Americans are evil, self-serving monsters who will do anything to demean others. In Saved!, Dannelly so immaturely conveys the idea that all Christians are phony, insincere, unaccepting hypocrites. But let me stop here - are there some Christians who are phony, insincere, unaccepting, and hypocritical? YES! (Attend any local church for a while and you'll believe me) But are all Christians like that? NO! So, Dannelly, strike one against you.Let me be non-phony, sincere, accepting, and honest for a moment and say, though, that Saved! does nail some things...and it's often quite funny, not to mention extremely well-done in parts. Jena Malone is well on her way to being a seriously great actress, Patrick Fugit should get more work, and Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter, who has inherited a killer rack, might I add) has a feisty glow to everything she does. And laugh-wise, it seems that the less blatantly offensive Saved! becomes, the funnier and more easy-to-like it becomes. I seriously hated this movie for a while, but then it does look it it starts to peek above your average teenage-message flick. A love story subplot with Malone and Fugit is incredibly effective in a cheesey way, the friendship (and more) formed between Culkin's 'differently disabled' teenager and Eva Amurri's Jewish girl provides quite a few laughs, and the more the movie lays off the pot shots the more it seems legit.But one of Saved!'s biggest faults is in the movie's most exaggerated and (rightly) annoying character, Moore's Hilary Faye. First of all, putting her in this movie is nothing more than a gimmick, letting the 'Christian Hollywood girl' satirize her own religion. Well, if I were Moore, I wouldn't be too proud of myself right now, first of all, and if I were Dannelly I would have made her more of a character and not a caricature. Her dialogue is implausible, her actions improbable, and a crucial twist in the film that rests on her shoulders crossed a line with me. And Moore should stick with something other than acting - she just can't be serious without looking properly ridiculous.So I've talked about some great things and some pretty awful things about this movie, but where does it stand in the end? Well, thanks to Dannelly and Urban, Saved! doesn't cut it. The whole movie feels like they're taking tips they learned in ""Satire 101"" and applying them in an awkward, ham-handed way. Yes, characters do emerge as loving and caring and the movie's overall theme is one of acceptance, but the way it's reached is so sophomoric and mechanical. There's a lot of talent lurking in this movie, a lot of potentially wicked wit, and a lot of potential, but it all comes down to the fact that the writers/director are playing basketball with a seven-year-old. Christianity is, and always will be, an easy target for comedy...so why not aim a little higher, be a little more creative? There comes a point when satire becomes fun-making, and Saved!, funny and occasionally decent as it can be, clearly shows where that point is.

But don't think this is a serious movie -- it's not, it's quite funny, and too true at parts.  My favorite line was when a character says ""You don't know what love is.""  Too true of too many people who proselytize their faith rather than simply love the people around them.The story tells the story of a senior at a Christian (evangelical) high school who gets pregnant (believing in her own tortured logic that she is ""saving"" her boyfriend from something worse by having sex with him).  Rather unbelievably, she gets through her senior year without anyone noticing, but in the course of the year, becomes increasingly disenchanted with the oppressively evangelical group she had been hanging out with (the Christian jewels, as they call themselves).

So she turned to acting, yet tries to show off her singing in practically every movie she stars in - including this one. I was willing to give the movie to go, after hearing and reading how good it was.I was pleasantly surprised! Some previous reviewers have gone on about the religion, the portrayal of Jews & Christians etc, but lets leave that up to Mel Gibson. We have got some stereotypes in this, which is typical of any movies these days, but means if you're not a stereotyped person yourself, you don't identify with anyone. You have the over-zealous, hypocritical angel with a gorgeous face but a heart of stone. The non-Christian outcast reeking of immorality and sin but concealing a heart of gold. The brainwashed, disconnected, naive Christian mother. And they're 'led' for want of a better word by Mandy Moore. (Plus I hate her name in the movie. Everyone calls her Hilary Faye. Why not just one or the other? The repetitiveness of Hilary Faye got on my nerves!) Her physically challenged brother, is played by Macaulay Culkin, and also stars Jena Malone, Eva Amurri, and Heather Matarazzo, in a small role, with blonde hair. Jena Malone is fantastic in this movie, and gets a much bigger role than she previously did in Donnie Darko. This time she's the centre of attention, through to trying to keep her pregnancy a secret, to the father only finding out just before she gives birth!I wouldn't say this movie is a comedy at all. OK, there's a few comedic moments, including Macaulay in his wheelchair, claiming he'll ""dance for food"", and promptly attempts to, and steals the show away from the main characters talking.Eva Amurri, the Jewish rebel, was terrific in this movie, and I was totally surprised when I went to look her up, and discovered she was Susan Sarandon's daughter! I'd only previously seen her being slapped by her mother, in the fictional TV show ""Days Of Our Lives"" in Friends! And Joey tried to chat her up. Despite the fact she chain smokes, she has a wicked bumper sticker - makes you almost wanna get a car so you can have that on it! She's got funky hair too. It would be great to see her in bigger roles after this, cos she's a fabby actress, with a terrific mother, and definitely gets the guys drooling.Macaulay's character goes through one of the bigger changes throughout the movie of any of the characters. From being pushed around by his sister at the start, he meets Eva Amurri's character, and puts in a subtly rebellious and thoughtful performance, to the end, where he appears suited & booted, and looking like a bit of eye candy!DVD extras include: commentary by director & co-writer Brian Bannelly, producer Sandy Stern and co-writer Michael Urban; commentary by Jena Malone and Mandy Moore; deleted scenes; bloopers; ""Saved! Revelations"" - outtakes; ""Heaven Help Us"": behind-the-scenes featurette; and easter eggs.Definitely get this movie, as it's one of the best teen movies out there at the moment, and well worth seeing when you get a chance. It's not even out in the UK yet at the cinema, but if you fancy seeing it before most others, get the DVD.And one other thing: REM's Michael Stipe co-produced this.",4,A realistic teen movie,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,3415,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'wary', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'who', 'tried', 'being', 'singer', 'same', 'time', 'blondes', 'were', 'around', 'Jessica', 'Christina', 'Britney', 'just', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'turned', 'acting', 'yet', 'show', 'off', 'singing', 'practically', 'movie', 'including', 'one', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'movie', 'go', 'hearing', 'reading', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gone', 'religion', 'portrayal', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'etc', 'lets', 'leave', 'up', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'have', 'got', 'stereotypes', 'typical', 'movies', 'days', ""'re"", 'not', 'stereotyped', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'identify', 'anyone', 'have', 'over-zealous', 'hypocritical', 'angel', 'gorgeous', 'face', 'heart', 'stone', 'non-Christian', 'outcast', 'reeking', 'immorality', 'sin', 'concealing', 'heart', 'gold', 'brainwashed', 'disconnected', 'naive', 'Christian', 'mother', ""'re"", ""'led"", 'want', 'better', 'word', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'hate', 'name', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'other', 'repetitiveness', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'got', 'nerves', 'physically', 'challenged', 'brother', 'played', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'also', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'small', 'role', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'previously', 'did', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'time', 'centre', 'attention', 'trying', 'keep', 'pregnancy', 'secret', 'father', 'only', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'birth', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'comedy', 'OK', 'few', 'comedic', 'moments', 'including', 'Macaulay', 'wheelchair', 'claiming', ""'ll"", 'dance', 'food', 'promptly', 'attempts', 'show', 'away', 'main', 'characters', 'talking.Eva', 'Amurri', 'Jewish', 'rebel', 'was', 'terrific', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'surprised', 'when', 'went', 'look', 'up', 'discovered', 'was', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'daughter', ""'d"", 'only', 'previously', 'seen', 'being', 'slapped', 'mother', 'fictional', 'TV', 'show', 'Days', 'Lives', 'Friends', 'Joey', 'tried', 'chat', 'up', 'fact', 'chain', 'smokes', 'wicked', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'almost', 'wan', 'get', 'car', 'can', 'have', 'got', 'funky', 'hair', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'see', 'bigger', 'roles', 'fabby', 'actress', 'terrific', 'mother', 'definitely', 'guys', 'drooling.Macaulay', 'character', 'one', 'bigger', 'changes', 'movie', 'characters', 'being', 'pushed', 'sister', 'start', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'character', 'subtly', 'rebellious', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'end', 'where', 'suited', 'booted', 'looking', 'bit', 'eye', 'candy', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Brian', 'Bannelly', 'producer', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'co-writer', 'Michael', 'Urban', 'commentary', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'Saved', 'Revelations', 'outtakes', 'Heaven', 'Help', 'Us', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'easter', 'eggs.Definitely', 'get', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'movies', 'there', 'moment', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'not', 'even', 'out', 'UK', 'yet', 'cinema', 'fancy', 'seeing', 'most', 'others', 'get', 'DVD.And', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'REM', 'Michael', 'Stipe', 'co-produced']",Saved!

842434,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002OXRSG,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 7]","Saved! was portrayed in trailers as a teen drama that mocks Christian fundamentalism.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.The cast consists of several familiar faces: Devout Christian Mary (Jena Malone, from the far superior Donnie Darko) discovers that her ice-skating boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust), is gay.  When she has a vision that Jesus tells her to ""help Dean,"" she takes that to mean she should ""cure"" him of his ""affliction.""  So she does it the way any red-blooded teenager might, which is how she gets pregnant.Of course, Dean can't possibly be cured, so he's shipped off to a...for lack of a better word, ""de-gay-ification"" camp.  If you think this is a joke, Google ""love in action"" to see a real life example of such a camp.In the mean time, Mary's in trouble.  She attends a Christian fundamentalist school (""American Eagle"") and is part of the Jewels, a girl gang led by the blonde and tanned Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore).  Hilary takes obnoxious fundamentalism to new levels, hosting prayer groups for Dean and shunning anyone who doesn't adhere to her own agenda.Unfortunately for Hilary, she has a disabled brother (Roland, played by Macaulay Culkin in his best role to date) who hates her.  I don't mean normal dislike between siblings.  In fact, it's difficult to believe they really are siblings.  Roland hooks up with the only other rebel (and Jew) in the school, Cassandra (Eva Amurri).  The inevitable ostracism that comes about from their differences binds Roland, Cassandra, and Mary together.Plot points continue to spin out from the main thread, including Mary's crush on the principal/pastor's son (Patrick, played by...Patrick Fugit) and her mom's crush (the delectable Mary-Louise Parker) on the principal/pastor (Skip, played by Martin Donovan).  These two side plots distract from the film's message.  In fact, both crushes are patently unbelievable.  The adult romance happens almost entirely off screen.  Conversely, Patrick pursues Mary against every deterrent, including rejection, the fact that she's pregnant, and that a hot chick (Hilary) is always after him.It's unfortunate that this film is considered so revolutionary, in that American media has a very difficult time openly criticizing Christian fundamentalism (especially these days).  The concepts here have been handled with much better directing and a tighter plot in Donnie Darko, Napoleon Dynamite and American Beauty.  Given that the plot bounces ahead from holiday to holiday, it's sometimes hard to follow what's going on.The main villain, Hilary, is a one-dimensional caricature.  It comes as no surprise when we discover that Hilary has a dark secret, but the secret's really lame.  What's worse is that her brother betrays her in such a horrible fashion, acting decidedly un-brother-like.On the other hand, the film shows Roland as a real teenager who happens to sit in a wheelchair.  His character develops throughout the movie and he truly comes of age, realizing that he doesn't want to depend on anybody (including his girlfriend) if he wants to respect himself.Throughout all the teen and adult angst is the persistent theme of Christianity being abused and used in ways that are borderline ridiculous. Or, it would be, if these schools didn't actually exist.  But they do, so it's not quite as amusing and a little disconcerting.  Can anyone use pseudo-speak words like ""gangsta"" and ""for the Lord"" in the same sentence without cracking up?  If you think this is a joke, Google ""Christian fundamentalist high school"" to see a real life example.Indeed, there's quite a bit of cult-like activity that takes place in the school, from the aforementioned hybridized speech to dozens of kids with their eyes closed, hands up, swaying to Christian rock.  Which sounds suspiciously like regular rock only with the words changed. The requirement for good girls to lust after boys is their connection to Christian groups, not their actual morality; so it's okay to want the bandleader of Godflight or the pastor's son.The director, Brian Dannelly, obviously has some issues he's working out (see the IMDB entry for his other film, He Bop).  His style is a little too heavy-handed for my tastes, smashing the audience over the head with Christ symbolism, the likes of which I haven't seen since Mimic.  The movie culminates in a prom, clumsily tying all the loose ends together in one neat, tidy package.  And we're expected to believe that the pretty, popular girls don't have dates-oh what sweet, unrealistic revenge this movie is!And that's the problem. Saved! is alternately too contrived or not vicious enough.  The characters aren't all convincing in their sins or their zeal, and sometimes it just feels like the film is a moral parable masquerading as a movie; a dumbed down liberal version of a Jack Chik rant against the perils of fundamentalism.  We get it: ""Why would God make us all so different,"" asks Mary,"" if he wanted us to be the same?""If the worst Saved! can point out is that Christian fundamentalism makes everyone boring, then that's a very mild chastisement indeed.",3,a teen drama that mocks Christian fundamentalism,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,5097,"['Saved', 'was', 'portrayed', 'trailers', 'teen', 'drama', 'Christian',

Her resulting pregnancy scandalizes the ""Christian Jewels"" clique at Mary's fundamentalist high school, led by the insufferable Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore). Some funny and lightly satirical complications ensue, enacted by a talented cast of teen-star royalty--not only Malone and Moore, but also Macaulay Culkin, Patrick Fugit and Heather Matarazzo. The standout, however, is Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) as Cassandra, the only Jewish student at Mary's high school, who sets herself in gleeful rebellion against Hillary Faye's hypocritical rat pack. ""Saved!"" sends up various affectations of both the teen and born-again cultures, but with more affection than vitriol. The film is not anti-Christian at all, just anti-Pharisee.

842436,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002OXRSG,mirasreviews,"[8, 8]","""Saved!"" is a black comedy, coming of age tale, and a morality play set, fittingly, at a Christian high school, where righteousness and irony abound. Mary (Jena Malone) is a devout young woman who tries in good faith to cure her gay boyfriend by sleeping with him. As her senior year begins, she finds herself pregnant and questioning the values that she once thought indisputable, which puts her at odds with her old friends. Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), the prettiest, most popular, and most self-righteous girl in school, makes it her mission to save Mary's soul. As everyone strives to find his or her place and decide what he believes, the principal's accepting son (Patrick Fugit) courts Mary, and Hilary Faye's cynical wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) finds a  kindred spirit in the school rebel, Cassandra (Eva Amurri).The first half-hour of ""Saved!"" is fantastic. The actors' straight delivery of their ardent  dialogue is priceless. This is some of the most brilliant black comedy that I've seen. Unfortunately, the movie then kicks into conventional morality play mode. It becomes extremely predictable. It's a lost opportunity, but I have to say that the characters continue to be interesting to watch, and the story is charming. They become clich&eacute;s, but they are three-dimensional clich&eacute;s. The cast embodies them perfectly. Mandy Moore seems to have a lot of fun with her self-possessed but vicious villainess, Hilary Faye. She's the kind of character that audiences love to hate, and Moore eggs us on. She even sings in the movie and on the soundtrack. Mary Louise Parker and Martin Donovan play caring, well-intentioned parents who tend to do the wrong thing when they are at a loss for what to do. And Eva Amurri makes quite an impression as Cassandra, the school's outsider and general thorn in its side. This is the second role in which Amurri's comic gestures have hilariously defined her character. The first was in ""The Banger Sisters"", where she played daughter to her real-life mother, Susan Sarandon. Physical comedy is very much her fort&eacute;, and I expect she will be a  successful comic actress.Morality is a little muddled at times, as the rogue students who have our sympathies are occasionally as mean-spirited as their detractors are self-righteous. I wish writers Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban hadn't abandoned irony in favor of hypocrisy as a theme. Obviously zealotry is hypocritical and immoral, but that's not interesting. I preferred the tone of the first third of the movie, but even so, ""Saved!"" is entertaining and has a great coming-of-age cast. Whether Christians will like the film or take offense probably depends on whether they are the type of Christians the film is lampooning. Mainline Christians may find ""Saved!"" quite funny.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, one featurette, 11 deleted and extended scenes, 4 bloopers, a theatrical trailer, and 6 ""Saved Revelations"", which are glimpses of what we didn't see in some scenes, such as what Mary was looking at when she slammed her laptop shut. Better not to know, actually. The ""Heaven Help Us"" featurette is a fun 4-minute montage of movie clips and interviews with the cast and crew. The first audio commentary is by writer/director Brian Dannelly, co-writer Michael Urban, and co-producer Sandy Stern. They discuss how they shot the film, remarkably,  in 28 days with less than $5 million, commenting on locations, filming, and story. In the second audio commentary, actresses Jena Malone and Mandy Moore talk about their experiences in making the film. Both audio commentaries are reasonably entertaining. Low and no-budget filmmakers may find the first commentary especially interesting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.",4,"Starts Out Darkly Comic, then Falters.

The movie is about a teenage girl (Jena Malone) who is brought up in a fundamentalist Christian home and goes to a fundamentalist Christian high school. She fears her boyfriend is gay, and after bonking her head in a swimming pool accident and becoming delirious, has a vision of ""Jesus"", which she interprets as Jesus telling her to try to cure the boyfriend by doing more than just kissing him -- ultimately they had sex and the girl got pregnant.Then the craziness ensues: including hiding the pregnancy, the actions of the nutter fundamentalist Miss Perfect friend, the Jewish misfit girl in the fundamentalist Christian school stirring things up against the school administration and befriending the pregnant girl, etc.All told, funny unsubtle satire. Jena Malone starred as the teenage girl and unlike most 17-year olds in Hollywood, she looks like a high schooler. She was OK, more a leaf in the breeze of the movie than anything else. Mandy Moore played the Miss Perfect, Hillary Faye with some giddy excess.Better still, Eva Amurri as the Jewish troublemaker who stole most of the scenes she was in, and Macauley Culkin as Hillary Faye's embittered paraplegic brother. Years ago some movie reviewer, in his review of The Good Son, wrote that Elijah Wood was a better actor than Culkin, but Culkin had a better role. Today, that's simply not true. Culkin is at his best when understated and not given the melodramatic lead role -- see My Girl. In Saved, he was very good as the sardonic and quietly anti-establishment unfavored sibling and easily the most sympathetic character in the whole bit.Sure, it has a semi-cheesy ending that wraps things up a little too neatly.

The insults are pretty much reserved for the egotistical fundamentalists whose faith is a means to hate and fear anything outside their definition of what is right.These people are almost too easy a target for satire and Brain Dannelly grabbed at this low hanging fruit because ""Saved!"" is a lazy movie that contains almost nothing original on its subject. Just elicit a feeling of intellectual superiority from your audience, by riffing the feeling of moral superiority the religious conservatives exhibit.Prospective viewers should know up front that ""Saved"" is the victim of two different Moore curses. The first is the Michael Moore curse where you applaud the concept but cringe about the execution. You agree and support the conclusions but are embarrassed by the ham- handed way they are presented and you wish desperately for a better spokesman.The second is the Mandy Moore curse. It is not my intention to cast ill will toward the recording artist profession, nor do I wish to give the impression that all female vocalists are bubble-headed idiots with aspirations toward bad acting. I am but a humble viewer with an opinion. The movie speaks for itself.""Saved! '' fails as a ""funny teen comedy"" because it is not particularly funny. With one exception it is a decent ensemble and many of the characters are entertaining. It works pretty well as a coming of age story told nicely from the POV of Mary who provides voice-over narration. Mary's relationship with her mother, a great performance by Mary-Louise Parker who looks almost too young for the role, is especially well handled. Mary's gay boyfriend gets her pregnant which provides most of the film's humor as she faces the prospect of being an unwed mother by a boy in whose name teen prayer circles have been formed.Moore plays Hilary Faye, who uses the Calvinist foundation of her personal faith to justify any means that yields a reward. She seems to be trying to channel Reese Witherspoon's frustrated manipulator in ""Election,'' but can't really pull it off. Over-the-top characters like this are the most difficult of roles because the actor needs to convey a subtle element of self-parody, and this takes a special talent. Watch almost anything by Witherspoon, Angela Bettis, Gary Oldham, or Jack Nicholson to see what this concept is all about.Initially there are two cynics in the artificial environment of the Christian school. Hilary Faye's brother (Macaulay Culkin) is in a wheelchair due to a childhood accident and has a detached perspective because of it. He has hooked up with chain-smoking Cassandra (Eva Amurri-Susan Sarandon's daughter), an outsider because she is Jewish and a rebel because the film needs one.Culkin is good but Amurri has the impossible task of convincing you that someone who lies, cheats, steals, swears, and treats everyone with disrespect is a hero. This doesn't work, even in this environment, and it almost undermines the whole project because it so obviously reflects Dannelly's underlying hypocrisy. Fortunately Culkin, Amurri, and Malone have enough scenes together that Cassandra's likable dimensions can be introduced.Mary is being romantically pursued by Patrick Fugit and their scenes together have a lot of charm. He is the son of school's unhappily married pastor (Martin Donovan) whose character is not even remotely believable? He is far too conflicted to ring true, just an implausible character who wavers between absolute extremes. Donovan's stuff should have found its way to the deleted scene bin.Bottom line, for all its faults ""Saved!"" is better than at least half the movies out there. It has some excellent elements but don't expect a lot of laughs. But do expect to feel a little ashamed and uncomfortable about having someone as clumsy and clueless as Dannelly representing you.Then again, what do I know?

They attend American Eagle Christian School, hold constant prayer meetings and even have their very own singing girl group, The Christian Jewels. Everything in Mary's life seems to be right on spiritual track, until one day (while swimming)...her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust) confesses he thinks he's gay. Mary is so shocked by his confession that she ends up hitting her head and almost drowning in the pool. She has a ""vision"" and believes that Jesus is telling her to do everything necessary to help ""save"" her boyfriend from becoming gay: and she does.Next thing you know school is starting, Dean is sent to Mercy Home Center to ""recover from his gayness,"" and Mary soon realizes that she is pregnant. Angry at God for letting her down and not protecting her from this when she was only trying to do ""His will,"" Mary begins to rebel at school. Shocked Hilary does everything she can to save ""the poor backsliding Mary"" who is going to ""end up in Hell if she doesn't repent."" Mary's mother Lillian (played by Mary-Louise Parker) seems to be ill-equipped to deal with things like teenage pregnancy, so Mary enlists the help of school rebel & Jewess Cassandra (Eva Amurri) and Hilary's handicapped brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) to hide her pregnancy from everyone.  Especially Hilary, her mom, and school principal Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan).Pastor Skip's oh-so-cute son Patrick Wheeler (Patrick Fugit) just returned from the missionary field (where he was living with his mother), seems to have developed a big crush on Mary, but Hilary also has a big crush on him. Roland and Cassandra begin to spend time together, as Roland takes up smoking and begins to find some freedom from his over-bearing sister, Hilary. All this melds together to create a situation filled with drama and tension that must come to a head at some point. But will everything turn out all right in the end, and will Mary find her faith again?There is some language in this film, including two f-words. Christ and God are mentioned often, but not in swearing: there is one instance where a character says ""Jesus Christ"" when scared and another one says ""G*d damn"" and seems to really mean it, but that is it. There are some ugly phrases and swear words done in graffiti on one scene that the camera pans on for a few seconds. There is smoking, it is inferred people are having sex in their cars, there is a scene where two characters have sex, but you see nothing and just hear a few seconds, and then they show the ""just after"" bit for a few seconds. It is spoken of and inferred that the pastor and a woman are having an affair. There is a few seconds spent during a sex-ed class, with a picture of a naked man and woman (areas ""blurred""). Something is stolen from a local store. There is a short stint where Mary is exploring different religions, and is reading a book and holding a crystal. Much of the content is fairly irreverent.From her license plate ""JC Girl,"" to her ""gossip filled"" prayer meetings, and Bible-throwing theatrics of ""Jesus's love,"" Hilary seems to epitomize all that can be bad about a Christian girl. She is portrayed as being filled with jealously, ""tough"" love, and scheming, more than with Christ's forgiving love. I didn't walk out of this movie feeling offended, but I should warn you that many of you may.  Much of the content of this films shows atypical Christian activities and functions, from Christian school assemblies to prayer meetings, all with a bit of dramatic flair and with the ""Christianese"" so overdone that it is very over-the-top. I couldn't help but chuckle at some of it (much of it was so true and a bit silly when looked at with an ""outsiders"" perspective), but some could easily take great offense; I think if you are going to be able to watch this film, you have to be very open-minded about the way they ""poke fun"" at the religious community. There is a definite line between making a valid point and ridiculing, and although they often came very close, I never felt like the moviemakers stepped over the line. But some of you may: all this to say, I still don't think this is for ""ye who be faint at heart""; it takes strength and openness to be able to look at yourself the way others may see you and understand where they may be coming from.The ending leaves some left to be desired, and I found myself wishing for a tiny bit more resolution on some points, including Mary's ""faith"" in God. In the end, I felt the movie painted a pretty realistic picture of life in the ""Christian world"" (as many Christians isolate themselves from the world) and how it is, and it does make some very valid points and even teaches some good life lessons. As one character says ""Why would God make us all so different if He wanted us to be the same?"" They seem to be telling Christians to be more open-minded, more accepting, and the world would be a better place as a whole. And I can't say that I don't agree with them on that. The world would be a much better place with more forgiveness and less grudges, more love and less hate.",3,"Amusing yet some mocking, and not for the faint of heart...",1086652800,"06 8,

842460,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002OXRSG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Saved! (Brian Dannelly, 2004)I've been finding myself quite enamored of the mean-spirited teen comedy recently. First it was Mean Girls, and now I find myself smitten by Saved!.Saved! Is the story of Mary (Jena Malone of Donnie Darko fame), a student at a strict Baptist school who becomes pregnant while trying to save her boyfriend Dean (The 4400's Chad Faust) from his homosexuality. Faced with what she is sure will be complete ostracism from her former friends, she tentatively befriends the school outcasts, Cassandra (Anywhere but Here's Eva Amurri) and Roland (child star Macaulay Culkin, all grown up). Things start to get complicated when both Mary and her best friend Hilary Faye (singer Mandy Moore) both fall for the new transfer student, Patrick (DeadBirds' Patrick Fugit).Where Mean Girls tried to hide its mean spirit to some extent, there's none of that in Saved!; the movie revels in its meanness in the same way, say, South Park does. Screenwriters Dannelly and Michael Urban obviously have a bone to pick with religious high schools, and they let out as many stops as they can and still have a marketable movie. The actors here are obviously having a ball with the material, and Dannelly's directorial role, in most cases, is to be as invisible as possible and simply let the drama play out in front of the camera. In the other cases, it's to add all sorts of odd little digs that will probably require multiple viewings to get (for example, having the supposedly uber-Christian rock band playing the prom cover Replacements songs rather than Christian rock standards).A barrel of fun, though I doubt your fundamentalist friends would appreciate it if you happened to have it on when they came over. *** ",4,Wonderful stuff.,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,1724,"['Saved', 'Brian', 'Dannelly', '2004', ""'ve"", 'been', 'finding', 'quite', 'enamored', 'mean-spirited', 'teen', 'comedy', 'recently', 'First', 'was', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'now', 'find', 'smitten', 'Saved', '.Saved', 'story', 'Mary', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'fame', 'student', 'strict', 'Baptist', 'school', 'who', 'pregnant', 'trying', 'save', 'boyfriend', 'Dean', '4400', 'Chad', 'Faust', 'homosexuality', 'Faced', 'what', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'ostracism', 'former', 'friends', 'tentatively', 'school', 'outcasts', 'Cassandra', 'Anywhere', 'Here', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'Roland', 'child', 'star', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'grown', 'up', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'Mary', 'best', 'friend', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'singer', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'fall', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'Patrick', 'DeadBirds', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', '.Where', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'tried', 'hide', 'mean', 'spirit', 'extent', 'none', 'Saved', 'movie', 'revels', 'meanness', 'same', 'way', 'say', 'South', 'Park', 'Screenwriters', 'Dannelly', 'Michael', 'Urban', 'obviously', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'religious', 'high', 'schools', 'let', 'out', 'many', 'stops', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'marketable', 'movie', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'ball', 'material', 'Dannelly', 'directorial', 'role', 'most', 'cases', 'be', 'as', 'invisible', 'possible', 'simply', 'let', 'drama', 'play', 'out', 'front', 'camera', 'other', 'cases', 'add', 'sorts', 'odd', 'little', 'digs', 'will', 'probably', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'get', 'example', 'having', 'supposedly', 'uber-Christian', 'rock', 'band', 'playing', 'prom', 'cover', 'Replacements', 'rather', 'Christian', 'rock', 'standards', '.A', 'barrel', 'fun', 'doubt', 'fundamentalist', 'friends', 'would', 'appreciate', 'happened', 'have', 'when', 'came', 'over', '***']",Saved!
842461,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002OXRSG,Robert Moore,"[208, 215]","There is no easy way to clear up the debate that this film generates for those who are either religious or nonreligious, or religious but not fundamentalist, but I will say this:  I attended a Southern Baptist college, and pretty much everything that one can find in this film I saw in real life.  I was in a play where a girl kissed me on the cheek, to have her parents pull her out of school the next day for immorality.  I knew a host of ""good"" Baptist girls and boys who could have written veritable Kama Sutras on things they can do together without having intercourse.  I have seen so many good things declared Satanic that one would imagine that there is no room left for God.  As one with an extensive evangelical fundamentalist background, I really didn't find anything too extreme.  I even knew some devout Christians who were just as mean in their faith as Hilary Faye in this film.  Overall, I don't think the film is anti-religious or anti-Christianity.  But it is a critique of the narrowness of many Christians, a critique that I personally think Jesus would completely endorse.  After all, in the Gospels, the two groups of people He had no patience with were the wealthy and the overly religious.The point of the film wasn't to provide a Polaroid of what life in Christian fundamentalist high schools is like.  If so, they would have included more of the really nice people that inhabit the schools.  The point of the film is to highlight something that Jena Malone's character Mary (albeit, a not so virginal one) says to Pastor Skip near the end:  ""Why would God make us all so different, if he wanted us to all be the same?""  I have witnessed first hand the way that many fundamentalist groups want to cut back on diversity, want to limit the number of legitimate lifestyle choices for people.  I think the point of this film is that underneath the rather artificial veneer that many fundamentalist groups impose on people, they still are more diverse than they want to acknowledge, and the individuality eventually comes out, even if suppressed in the short run.The cast is excellent, and I especially enjoyed Jena Malone as Mary.  She does a great job of combining fragility and innocence and strength.  The humor was sharp and to the point, and I found a host of the situations throughout the film to be thoroughly familiar.My main complaint with the film is the last half hour, where the narrative starts falling apart, not so much conceptually as visually.  Movies are always told with the camera, and not by the script, and the timing in many of the final scenes is just off a bit.  For instance, where we see the Pastor Skip walking towards the hospital, and then away, and then back.  Or many of the verbal encounters at the prom.  The narrative flow bogged down and didn't match the rhythm of the rest of the movie.All in all, this is a good movie about being in a teenager in a place that not everyone in our society is familiar with.  With a better-paced final half hour, it would have been even better.",4,"Totters at the end, but very strong overall",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,3034,"['easy', 'way', 'clear', 'up', 'debate', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'religious', 'nonreligious', 'religious', 'not', 'fundamentalist', 'will', 'say', 'attended', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'college', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'saw', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'play', 'where', 'girl', 'kissed', 'cheek', 'have', 'parents', 'pull', 'school', 'next', 'day', 'immorality', 'knew', 'host', 'good', 'Baptist', 'girls', 'boys', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'veritable', 'Kama', 'Sutras', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'together', 'having', 'intercourse', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'declared', 'Satanic', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'room', 'left', 'God', 'one', 'extensive', 'evangelical', 'fundamentalist', 'background', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'too', 'extreme', 'even', 'knew', 'devout', 'Christians', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'mean', 'faith', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'film', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'anti-religious', 'anti-Christianity', 'critique', 'narrowness', 'many', 'Christians', 'critique', 'personally', 'think', 'Jesus', 'would', 'completely', 'endorse', 'Gospels', 'two', 'groups', 'people', 'had', 'patience', 'were', 'wealthy', 'overly', 'religious.The', 'point', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'provide', 'Polaroid', 'what', 'life', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'high', 'schools', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'really', 'nice', 'people', 'inhabit', 'schools', 'point', 'film', 'highlight', 'something', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'Mary', 'albeit', 'not', 'virginal', 'one', 'Pastor', 'Skip', 'end', 'Why', 'would', 'God', 'make', 'so', 'different', 'wanted', 'be', 'same', 'have', 'witnessed', 'first', 'hand', 'way', 'many', 'fundamentalist', 'groups', 'want', 'cut', 'back', 'diversity', 'want', 'limit', 'number', 'legitimate', 'lifestyle', 'choices', 'people', 'think', 'point', 'film', 'rather', 'artificial', 'veneer', 'many', 'fundamentalist', 'groups', 'impose', 'people', 'still', 'are', 'more', 'diverse', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'individuality', 'eventually', 'out', 'even', 'suppressed', 'short', 'run.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Mary', 'great', 'job', 'combining', 'fragility', 'innocence', 'strength', 'humor', 'was', 'sharp', 'point', 'found', 'host', 'situations', 'film', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'familiar.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'where', 'narrative', 'starts', 'falling', 'apart', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'conceptually', 'visually', 'Movies', 'are', 'always', 'told', 'camera', 'not', 'script', 'timing', 'many', 'final', 'scenes', 'just', 'off', 'bit', 'instance', 'where', 'see', 'Pastor', 'Skip', 'walking', 'hospital', 'then', 'away', 'then', 'back', 'many', 'verbal', 'encounters', 'prom', 'narrative', 'flow', 'bogged', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'rhythm', 'rest', 'movie.All', 'good', 'movie', 'being', 'teenager', 'place', 'not', 'everyone', 'society', 'familiar', 'better-paced', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better']",Saved!
842462,A3G5B9IXVO48,B0002OXRSG,Rudiger,"[0, 0]","I was very unenthusiastic about this movie. The only reason I thought I should see it was because I thought I should keep up with the stereotypes that aloof, ignorant pseudo-intellectuals have for Christians. I was expecting loads of predictable dialogue about abortion clinics (""she's planting a pipe bomb?"") and unwarranted cliches. While there was some of this, I was impressed by the efforts of the filmmakers to show the humanity and complexity of all involved, even the ogre-ish character played by Mandy Moore.The characters are straight-up MTV personas, sort of like a ""Daria"" episode making fun of religion. We've got the snobby, mindless Moore (who does a great job) as the head goon; a youth pastor whose desperate attempts to be hip only accent his hopelessly traditional square-ness; a kooky mother who shelters her child from the secular world; and the protagonist (Jena Malone, lovely as always) who was once influenced by the hyper-fundamentalism of Moore's crew but is now having doubts. Then we've got Patrick, the sweet, sensitive, post-modern influence in the movie, who's more interested in skateboarding than converting heathens. And where would we be without the quintessential cynics, those adorably sarcastic ""others"" who light films up with their free thinking and quasi-anarchic ways (also, in the context of the film, non-Christians). Maculay Culkin does a respectable job as one of these, as does Eva Amurri, who is also Jewish.Oh yeah, and a recently-out homosexual teenager who provides for plenty of opportunity on the Christian kids' parts to show their ignorance and utter lack of compassion. I guess some things are  inevitable.Taken as it is, this would be an incredibly lazy film. However, director Brian Dannelly delves deeper, and we see the insecurities and doubts that plague even the most steadfastly (albeit disgustingly) faithful of them all. It's heart-breaking to watch Moore's character praying at her bed, trying her darndest to find out what God wants for her, when she's so close to realizing that she's too involved with her own self-righteousness to even hear God.Granted, it is just a teen comedy at heart, and the satire is rather light. And it's almost certain that people who don't know much about Christianity will like it a lot more than those who actually can support or denounce the stereotypes with authority. Still, a rather refreshing view of things we don't much like talking about.Now if only Hollywood could make a movie about REAL Christians, living under foreign governments, under pain of death for their faith, to spread Christ's love in a loving, UNforceful way ... huh, that'll be the day.",4,Surprisingly Human,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,2661,"['was', 'very', 'unenthusiastic', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'thought', 'should', 'see', 'was', 'thought', 'should', 'keep', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'aloof', 'ignorant', 'pseudo-intellectuals', 'have', 'Christians', 'was', 'expecting', 'loads', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'abortion', 'clinics', 'planting', 'pipe', 'bomb', 'unwarranted', 'cliches', 'was', 'was', 'impressed', 'efforts', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'humanity', 'complexity', 'involved', 'even', 'ogre-ish', 'character', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Moore.The', 'characters', 'are', 'straight-up', 'MTV', 'personas', 'sort', 'Daria', 'episode', 'making', 'fun', 'religion', ""'ve"", 'got', 'snobby', 'mindless', 'Moore', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'head', 'goon', 'youth', 'pastor', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'be', 'hip', 'only', 'accent', 'hopelessly', 'traditional', 'square-ness', 'kooky', 'mother', 'who', 'child', 'secular', 'world', 'protagonist', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'lovely', 'always', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'influenced', 'hyper-fundamentalism', 'Moore', 'crew', 'now', 'having', 'doubts', 'Then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Patrick', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'post-modern', 'influence', 'movie', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'skateboarding', 'converting', 'heathens', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'quintessential', 'cynics', 'adorably', 'sarcastic', 'others', 'who', 'light', 'films', 'free', 'thinking', 'quasi-anarchic', 'ways', 'also', 'context', 'film', 'non-Christians', 'Maculay', 'Culkin', 'respectable', 'job', 'one', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'who', 'also', 'Jewish.Oh', 'yeah', 'recently-out', 'homosexual', 'teenager', 'who', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'Christian', 'kids', 'parts', 'show', 'ignorance', 'utter', 'lack', 'compassion', 'guess', 'things', 'are', 'inevitable.Taken', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'lazy', 'film', 'However', 'director', 'Brian', 'Dannelly', 'deeper', 'see', 'insecurities', 'doubts', 'plague', 'even', 'most', 'steadfastly', 'disgustingly', 'faithful', 'heart-breaking', 'watch', 'Moore', 'character', 'praying', 'bed', 'trying', 'darndest', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'God', 'when', 'so', 'close', 'realizing', 'too', 'involved', 'own', 'self-righteousness', 'even', 'hear', 'God.Granted', 'just', 'teen', 'comedy', 'heart', 'satire', 'rather', 'light', 'almost', 'certain', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Christianity', 'will', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'who', 'actually', 'can', 'support', 'denounce', 'stereotypes', 'authority', 'Still', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'view', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'talking', 'about.Now', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'REAL', 'Christians', 'living', 'foreign', 'governments', 'pain', 'death', 'faith', 'spread', 'Christ', 'love', 'loving', 'UNforceful', 'way', 'huh', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day']",Saved!

842467,A37S3ACL57LN62,B0002OXRSG,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[13, 14]","The movie is a realistic yet comical portrayal of the problems of teenagers and criticisms of exaggerated religiousness. The characters are likable and the story flows well. Even the music is well suited for their scenes. The DVD release gave audiences a variety of extra features as well.The script is witty and genuine. Although the story seems outrageous, the other aspects make it an excellent movie. The music chosen is excellent; Mandy Moore sings ""God Only Knows,"" a version of Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" plays and Chantal Kreviazuk's ""In This Life"" plays during a particularly pivotal scene. The amazing young cast is very realistic in the roles.The film touched on controversial issues that others refuse to address.I love the scene where Mary comes back from her appointment with a doctor sure that she is pregnant. She stops by a church and holds out her arms, and in her swearing questions God for the first time. It is a very powerful scene. The prom sequences were also powerful as the climax of the movie.The story could be examined as an attack on Christianity, but that is far from the truth. It is instead an attack on hypocritical Christians. Scenes that show Pastor Skip trying as hard as he can to use teenage language to reach out to the students is in many ways admirable. His bursts of, ""Who's down with G-O-D?"" and ""I was thinking of something a little less gangsta'"" are funny, but they in no way degrade his character. Conversations in an extended scene included on the DVD about whether convicted felons who are saved just before execution go to heaven over those never taught of Christianity are never really solved and are thus left to the viewer to ponder and decide. The biggest attack is on Hilary Faye who means well through most of the movie but often uses her religion to put herself ahead of everyone. The character is commanding and hypocritical. She condemns Mary because Mary stands up for her boyfriend and Hilary frames Mary's group of new friends to get them expelled from the school. Then she lies about it. The whole time she acts as if she is a perfect person and has the right to judge other people for making mistakes. Eva Amurri played the Jewish rebel of the school extremely well and ironically embodies the spirit of a true Christian. She helps Mary when she needs a friend most. It is easy to see why Mary is the one that is happy in the end. The theme reflects humanity; it is living a life as best as a person can while knowing they cannot be perfect. As Mary says, ""No one fits in one hundred percent of the time.""The extras on the DVD are abundant. Two audio commentaries are added, one with the crew and one with two female cast members. Bloopers, deleted and extended scenes, a featurette, a trailer and subtitles are also included. The commentary featuring Jena Malone and Mandy Moore displays interesting personal opinions and secrets of production. The rest of the extra features, though abundant, are not as interesting. The bloopers are not very funny. The deleted and extended scenes were cut out for obvious reasons. The featurette is short and the trailer is not the one seen on television. Part of the reason for lack of quality in the additional features is the short shooting schedule. The movie was only filmed in twenty-eight days. However, this is yet just another reason why the movie itself is so wonderful.Women might like the movie more than men because of the love story involved, but they can be promised at least a few laughs.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[3, 5]","I normally stay clear of movies which tend to fall within the high school/adolescent genre, I already survived my teens and have no interest in revisiting them, but after reading some promising reviews and publicity of SAVED! I decided to give it a chance and I haven't regretted it. This movie is a different kind of flick that holds an important moral lesson transcending the teenage milieu; it carries a lesson for everyone.The subjects of this film attend American Eagle Christian High School full of young Born Again Christians who praise the Lord and Jesus Christ at every opportunity. At the center of the crowd is a clique headed by Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore) who is the loudest bible thumper of them all. She is obsessed with saving non-believers destined to spend eternity in hell.At the beginning of the senior year Hillary is steadfastly alarmed and outraged when several of her classmates and friends are revealed to not follow God's ordained scriptures and who consistently resist their Christian education including such attributes as being Jewish, homosexual, pregnant, and handicapped. It is these students who rise up against the oppressive Christian beliefs of Hillary and her like to claim that God loves and endures the wide diversity of human beings.Throughout SAVED! there is a tremendous amount of satiric humor aimed at the ridiculousness of the Born Again Christian movement and their follies. While many of the jokes are borderline slapstick there are some clever and memorable lines that made me laugh out loud. The role of the satiric humor enabled the plot and screenplay to lighten up. By watching this movie is becomes so easy to laugh at the characters. Without the humor there would be a much more serious and harsher tone highlighting the viciousness of the conservative Christian faith.SAVED! is not the run-of-the-mill teenage movie, but this is the reason why it worked for me.

842474,A5WYNVGEOGV4T,B0002OXRSG,SirTheory,"[4, 5]","The only problem with ""Saved!"" is that it has a narrow audience who will actually GET the movie. If you didn't grow up in the Christian culture, the movie will fall flat. And of those who did grow up in that culture, many will be offended by the movie's portrayal.As a Christian, I grew up in the church/youth group enviroment and went to a Christian highschool. Thankfully, my highschool was no where near that extreme, nor was it a bad experience. My youth group, however, has closer parallels to ""Saved!""When you grow up, regardless of your faith, you are concerned with popularity and how others see you. Thus, the interests of the majority will dictate who the ""popular girls"" will be... those who most effectively use the majority's interests to their advantage. In my school, as it is with most, people were obsessed with sports. So the atheletic people were popular. In ""Saved!"" the school's interest was Jesus and Evangelism, so the people who were viewed as ""super christians"" became the popular ones.There comes a point in sports where some people become so desperate to stay on top and in the spotlight that they resort to stooping to levels they would previously condemned. For instance, the Tonya Harding fiasco a number of years back when she ambushed a competitor, taking the competitor out of the competition.""Saved!,"" while following Mary's story of mishearing God's voice, shows Hilary Fay's treck into the Tonya Harding state of mind... where she will do anything to stay popular, to stay on top of the social game.While most of what happens is over-the-top (throwing a bible in ""love,"" Hilary Fay spray painting the school), a lot of the underlying aspects can be applied to many youth groups. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for a girl to feel that Jesus wants her to save a gay friend by having sex with him. I could totally see some of the girls from the youth group I went to trying to perform an exorcism on someone and having prayer meetings for a gay aquantence.When people complain about how genuine faith isn't portrayed in this movie, I feel that they are looking over several key points. The most obvious is Patrick, the son of the pastor/princple/youth group leader, who just returned from a skate boarding mission trip. You can tell that he has a personal faith and belief in Jesus. He is a good character and believable. The other person, while almost a side character, is Mary's gay ex-boyfriend/father of her child. After getting sent to Mercy House he should be bitter and depressed. Instead, he says with a smile on his face, ""I know that Jesus Loves Me."" He says it in a way that you know he believes it and doesn't care what the other people think. He loves Jesus and knows that whatever the other Christians think, that Jesus loves him.The element I liked best about ""Saved!"" is Cassandra, the Jewish girl. She, like most of the others, had her own sort of masks on, but her true self showed when she reached out to other people. While many may question the wisdom in helping Mary hide her pregnancy, she displayed a true sense of caring for other people that she usually tried to mask. She even opened up toward Hilary Fay in Fay's worst hour instead of saying ""she deserved it.""",4,...,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,3231,"['only', 'problem', 'Saved', 'narrow', 'audience', 'who', 'will', 'actually', 'GET', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Christian', 'culture', 'movie', 'will', 'fall', 'flat', 'who', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'culture', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'movie', 'portrayal.As', 'Christian', 'grew', 'up', 'church/youth', 'group', 'enviroment', 'went', 'Christian', 'highschool', 'Thankfully', 'highschool', 'was', 'where', 'extreme', 'was', 'bad', 'experience', 'My', 'youth', 'group', 'however', 'closer', 'parallels', 'Saved', 'When', 'grow', 'up', 'regardless', 'faith', 'are', 'concerned', 'popularity', 'how', 'others', 'see', 'Thus', 'interests', 'majority', 'will', 'dictate', 'who', 'popular', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'most', 'effectively', 'use', 'majority', 'interests', 'advantage', 'school', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'obsessed', 'sports', 'atheletic', 'people', 'were', 'popular', 'Saved', 'school', 'interest', 'was', 'Jesus', 'Evangelism', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'viewed', 'super', 'christians', 'became', 'popular', 'ones.There', 'point', 'sports', 'where', 'people', 'become', 'so', 'desperate', 'stay', 'top', 'spotlight', 'resort', 'stooping', 'levels', 'would', 'previously', 'condemned', 'instance', 'Tonya', 'Harding', 'number', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'ambushed', 'competitor', 'taking', 'competitor', 'competition', 'Saved', 'following', 'Mary', 'story', 'mishearing', 'God', 'voice', 'Hilary', 'Fay', 'treck', 'Tonya', 'Harding', 'state', 'mind', 'where', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'stay', 'popular', 'stay', 'top', 'social', 'game.While', 'most', 'what', 'over-the-top', 'throwing', 'bible', 'love', 'Hilary', 'Fay', 'spray', 'painting', 'school', 'lot', 'underlying', 'aspects', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'many', 'youth', 'groups', 'not', 'realm', 'possibility', 'girl', 'feel', 'Jesus', 'save', 'gay', 'friend', 'having', 'sex', 'could', 'totally', 'see', 'girls', 'youth', 'group', 'went', 'trying', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'someone', 'having', 'prayer', 'meetings', 'gay', 'aquantence.When', 'people', 'complain', 'how', 'genuine', 'faith', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'movie', 'feel', 'are', 'looking', 'several', 'key', 'points', 'most', 'obvious', 'Patrick', 'son', 'pastor/princple/youth', 'group', 'leader', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'skate', 'boarding', 'mission', 'trip', 'can', 'tell', 'personal', 'faith', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'good', 'character', 'believable', 'other', 'person', 'almost', 'side', 'character', 'Mary', 'gay', 'ex-boyfriend/father', 'child', 'getting', 'sent', 'Mercy', 'House', 'should', 'be', 'bitter', 'depressed', 'Instead', 'smile', 'face', 'know', 'Jesus', 'Me', 'way', 'know', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'Jesus', 'whatever', 'other', 'Christians', 'think', 'Jesus', 'him.The', 'element', 'liked', 'best', 'Saved', 'Cassandra', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'most', 'others', 'had', 'own', 'sort', 'masks', 'true', 'self', 'showed', 'when', 'reached', 'out', 'other', 'people', 'many', 'may', 'question', 'wisdom', 'helping', 'Mary', 'hide', 'pregnancy', 'displayed', 'true', 'sense', 'caring', 'other', 'people', 'usually', 'tried', 'mask', 'even', 'opened', 'up', 'Hilary', 'Fay', 'Fay', 'worst', 'hour', 'instead', 'saying', 'deserved']",Saved!

Morales,"[1, 7]","While this movie does a good job story-wise, featuring a girl in a Christian school who gets pregnant, thus breaking the Biblical teachings of avoiding premarital sex, thus causing a stir of controversy among her classmates and teachers, the ""spoofing"" of this movie against Christians is so clearly bigoted against Christians. Just ONCE I'd like to see a movie featuring Christians for who they really are - real everyday people who struggle yet hold on the hope of a loving and faithful Heavenly Father who has redeemed them through the punishment of His Son, Jesus. NOT a bunch of psycho brain-washed cult followers who clearly need psychological medication. Yes, I'm a Christian myself, and while I clearly understand the desire for rebellion, this movie not only takes it too far, but does an ignorant job of doing so.The movie is pretty contradictory even in it's attempted spoof, the directors clearly have no clear vision or desire to know who God really is, what Christianity really is, or who Christians really are. They simply are working off of an ignorant bias (most likely off of mass media assumptions), and while they do humor Christians into thinking that their attempts are genuine (by the ending which does CLAIM to accept the existence of ""A god,"" clearly this god has no personality, no care for His people, and no real right to be worshiped or cared for at all. The directors simply would rather preach a politically correct Deism point of view and expect the audience to follow suit, instead of actually challenging people and truly asking them to open their minds to something that might actually help them in life.This movie simply mocks Christians by pointing at them and saying ""hey look at those people, they think they know everything, don't be like them, but instead just be uncaring ignorant deists like us.""What most people fail to see is that even WE Christian do not understand God fully, we CANNOT, it is impossible. We struggle just as much as anyone else in this life. We also do not claim to know everything, and even though some MIGHT, that is basically the case with any group, religious or not, right?While Christian films like 'Fireproof' may not have the star-power of this film or the budget, I would easily recommend it over this one only because at least the Christians in those films are portrayed with genuineness, not cartoons masquerading as reality such as in this film. It would be great if more big budget films portrayed Christians as genuine, but we all know how biased and ignorant they are, yet just like these directors, people will still ignorantly believe what this film says about Christians yet neglect any other thing Hollywood does as fake and superficial.",2,"Decent Movie, Idiotic portrayal of Christians",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2720,"['movie', 'good', 'job', 'story-wise', 'featuring', 'girl', 'Christian', 'school', 'who', 'pregnant', 'thus', 'breaking', 'Biblical', 'teachings', 'avoiding', 'premarital', 'sex', 'thus', 'causing', 'stir', 'controversy', 'classmates', 'teachers', 'spoofing', 'movie', 'Christians', 'so', 'clearly', 'bigoted', 'Christians', 'Just', 'ONCE', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Christians', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'real', 'everyday', 'people', 'who', 'struggle', 'yet', 'hold', 'hope', 'loving', 'faithful', 'Heavenly', 'Father', 'who', 'redeemed', 'punishment', 'Son', 'Jesus', 'NOT', 'bunch', 'psycho', 'brain-washed', 'cult', 'followers', 'who', 'clearly', 'need', 'psychological', 'medication', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'Christian', 'myself', 'clearly', 'understand', 'desire', 'rebellion', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'far', 'ignorant', 'job', 'doing', 'so.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'contradictory', 'even', 'attempted', 'spoof', 'directors', 'clearly', 'have', 'clear', 'vision', 'desire', 'know', 'who', 'God', 'really', 'what', 'Christianity', 'really', 'who', 'Christians', 'really', 'are', 'simply', 'are', 'working', 'ignorant', 'bias', 'most', 'likely', 'mass', 'media', 'assumptions', 'do', 'humor', 'Christians', 'thinking', 'attempts', 'are', 'genuine', 'ending', 'CLAIM', 'accept', 'existence', 'A', 'god', 'clearly', 'god', 'personality', 'care', 'people', 'real', 'right', 'be', 'worshiped', 'cared', 'directors', 'simply', 'would', 'rather', 'preach', 'politically', 'correct', 'Deism', 'point', 'view', 'expect', 'audience', 'follow', 'suit', 'instead', 'actually', 'challenging', 'people', 'truly', 'asking', 'open', 'minds', 'something', 'might', 'actually', 'help', 'life.This', 'movie', 'simply', 'mocks', 'Christians', 'pointing', 'saying', 'hey', 'look', 'people', 'think', 'know', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'instead', 'just', 'be', 'uncaring', 'ignorant', 'deists', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'fail', 'see', 'even', 'WE', 'Christian', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'God', 'fully', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'impossible', 'struggle', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'life', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'claim', 'know', 'everything', 'even', 'MIGHT', 'basically', 'case', 'group', 'religious', 'not', 'right', 'Christian', 'films', ""'Fireproof"", 'may', 'not', 'have', 'star-power', 'film', 'budget', 'would', 'easily', 'recommend', 'one', 'only', 'least', 'Christians', 'films', 'are', 'portrayed', 'genuineness', 'not', 'cartoons', 'masquerading', 'reality', 'such', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'more', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'portrayed', 'Christians', 'genuine', 'know', 'how', 'biased', 'ignorant', 'are', 'yet', 'just', 'directors', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'ignorantly', 'believe', 'what', 'film', 'Christians', 'yet', 'neglect', 'other', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'fake', 'superficial']",Saved!

How this film sneaked past the cracks I will never know.This was the only trailer I saw placed before The Passion of the Christ. It seemed strange. Was this movie serious? Was it making fun of christianity? And if it was, how did it have the balls to advertise itself to the audience that its making fun of. After finally getting around to watching this movie I find that much like its message, it lies somewhere in the middle of it all.Jena Malone is Mary. Your typical High School girl who attends a Christian High School and lives in a Christian community. I have seen this world before. It amazed me that someone finally made a film about the queer lifestyle of these kinds of neighborhoods. Everything and anything must be Christian affiliated. From music to clothing it all must have the stamp of JC attached before these folks even lift an eye brow of interest. Jena Malones mother wins a prize for best Christian interior designer.Its a boxed in world. Its a scary world because faith is no longer a personal belief between you and God, its become an obsession that must be flaunted and shown to everyone and everything.The film covers your basic range of believers. Mandy Moore plays the self righteous Christian who is out to save the world. You aren't a person. You're just a soul that needs her help. And if you aren't saved than its her mission in life to get you to that place. Jena Malone is Mary, not as intense as Mandy, she's a believer, but doesn't push her believes down peoples throats. And god help her, she has her doubts. Macauley Culkin is Richard, Mandy Moores disabled brother. What no one bothers to learn about him is, he's not a believer at all, so he's a closeted unbeliever. Than you have the only Jewish student in the HS, who is of course berated by oh-so-perfect Mandy Moore character, Hillary Faye.The players here are some of our best young actors doing what they do best. Jena Malone has been in Donnie Darko and The Dangerious Lives of Altar Boys and is pretty much playing the same character here. But she carries this starring role a bit better than in those films where she is more of a supporting character. Mandy Moore finally convinces me that she should quit singing and stick to films. Sure you hate her character, but thats what your supposed to feel. Shes a hypocrite of the worst kind, and Mandy Moore plays it to a T. Macauley Culkin continues to climb his way out of Home-Alone hell and plays it smart by taking on these smaller but more human roles. I look forward to more from him.The film winks at us with every cliche. You can't help but laugh at a T-Shirt that says JC/DC. This little Christian world is funny, especially since so much of it seems familiar to me. I was sorta caught up in those kind of ppl for a short time in my life, needless to say I kept my faith but left these folks to their own thing. Its a story about tolerance, and it gets a tad bit preachy towards the end. Its a premise we don't see much of in films, and it doesn't make fun of Christians, it makes fun of bigots and hate mongers. This is all greatly represented in a scene where Mandy Moore throws a bible at Jena Malones character.

842482,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B0002OXRSG,The Wickerman,"[1, 1]","""Saved!"" is a mostly (and unfortunately) overlooked little film that deftly tackles the subject of religion, and the confusion and hypocrisy surrounding it.  Written by none other than REM frontman Michael Stipe, it manages to be a tasteful satire that makes you laugh as much as it makes you think.The story is centered around a girl named Mary, played by Jena Malone (who by the way is awesome because she's in not one, not two, but three of my favorite movies from the past few years: ""Donnie Darko"", ""Into the Wild"", and this one right here).  Mary is a straight-laced teenage girl who is devoutly religious, and a top student at a christian school.  She has a picture-perfect life, and a boyfriend she's madly in love with.  That is, until her boyfriend confesses to her that he is gay.  Now, since christianity doesn't take so kindly to the homosexual persuasion, Mary decides that she must try to ""convert"" him in order to save their relationship and his soul.  And how does she do this?  By having sex with him.  This of course does not work, and not only is the boyfriend still gay, but she is now pregnant.  And of course, christianity doesn't take too kindly to teen pregnancy or premarital sex either.This causes Mary to be shunned by her peers, leading her to question her faith, and everything she's always believed in.  She's confused, because she's gotten into this mess because she thought it was what God wanted her to do, and in the end it only made things worse.  This leads her on a path of attempting to reconcile her faith with certain aspects of her religion that no longer make sense to her.This all could potentially be a very dark and depressing film, but Stipe tackles the issues in a very light-hearted but still thought-provoking way.  The uproar that is caused by all of these events seems so silly, but at the same time it's the kind of thing that really happens all over the country.  Malone is excellent as a character who is so obviously naive, but at the same time is well-intentioned and introspective.  She learns important lessons from all of this, and hopefully the viewer does as well.  I am a non-religious person, but at the same time I'm not anti-religious either, so I really liked that Stipe chose to take a similar standpoint in making this.  It is highly critical of organized religion, and the things within it that frankly just make no sense to me, but at the same time it doesn't completely condemn religion either. It shows that you can still maintain your faith or whatever without necessarily becoming a mindless slave to it, which is why I think that no matter what kind of views you have on religion, you can identify with the movie's message without feeling like you're being told to take one side or the other.And of course there's tons of great performances here, like Mandy Moore as the hilariously over-the-top religious zealot Hilary Faye, and Macaulay Culkin as her wise-cracking younger brother.  Patrick Fugit excellently reprises his prototypical nice-guy role in ""Almost Famous"" as Mary's new potential love interest, and Eva Amurri (the lovely and talented daughter of Susan Sarandon) stands out as perhaps my favorite character of the film, the rebellious and acid-tongued Cassandra, who as the lone jew in an all-christian school is an unabashed outcast who isn't afraid to tell anyone exactly what she thinks.  Her character is especially interesting, because she's initially looked down upon by the whole school (Mary included), but after word gets out about what's happened to Mary, Cassandra is the only one who's really there for her, which is an important part of Mary changing her perspective on everything.Anyway, this is just a fun, intelligent, extremely well-written film that I highly recommend.  Michael Stipe has proven to be every bit as good of a screenwriter as he is a songwriter, and I for one really hope he continues to write more great stuff like this.",5,Funny and intelligent.,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3944,"['Saved', 'mostly', 'unfortunately', 'overlooked', 'little', 'film', 'deftly', 'subject', 'religion', 'confusion', 'hypocrisy', 'surrounding', 'Written', 'none', 'other', 'REM', 'frontman', 'Michael', 'Stipe', 'be', 'tasteful', 'satire', 'as', 'much', 'think.The', 'story', 'centered', 'girl', 'named', 'Mary', 'played', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'who', 'way', 'awesome', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'three', 'favorite', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Wild', 'one', 'right', 'here', 'Mary', 'straight-laced', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'devoutly', 'religious', 'top', 'student', 'christian', 'school', 'picture-perfect', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'madly', 'love', 'boyfriend', 'gay', 'Now', 'christianity', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'kindly', 'homosexual', 'persuasion', 'Mary', 'must', 'try', 'convert', 'order', 'save', 'relationship', 'soul', 'how', 'do', 'having', 'sex', 'course', 'not', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'boyfriend', 'still', 'gay', 'now', 'pregnant', 'course', 'christianity', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'premarital', 'sex', 'either.This', 'Mary', 'be', 'shunned', 'peers', 'leading', 'question', 'faith', 'everything', 'always', 'believed', 'confused', 'gotten', 'mess', 'thought', 'was', 'what', 'God', 'wanted', 'do', 'end', 'only', 'made', 'things', 'worse', 'path', 'attempting', 'reconcile', 'faith', 'certain', 'aspects', 'religion', 'longer', 'make', 'sense', 'her.This', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'very', 'dark', 'depressing', 'film', 'Stipe', 'issues', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'still', 'thought-provoking', 'way', 'uproar', 'caused', 'events', 'so', 'silly', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'thing', 'really', 'country', 'Malone', 'excellent', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'obviously', 'naive', 'same', 'time', 'well-intentioned', 'introspective', 'important', 'lessons', 'hopefully', 'viewer', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'non-religious', 'person', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'anti-religious', 'either', 'really', 'liked', 'Stipe', 'chose', 'take', 'similar', 'standpoint', 'making', 'highly', 'critical', 'organized', 'religion', 'things', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'completely', 'condemn', 'religion', 'can', 'still', 'maintain', 'faith', 'necessarily', 'becoming', 'mindless', 'slave', 'why', 'think', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'views', 'have', 'religion', 'can', 'identify', 'movie', 'message', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'being', 'told', 'take', 'one', 'side', 'other.And', 'course', 'tons', 'great', 'performances', 'here', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'religious', 'zealot', 'Hilary', 'Faye', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'wise-cracking', 'younger', 'brother', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'excellently', 'prototypical', 'nice-guy', 'role', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Mary', 'new', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'lovely', 'talented', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'out', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'rebellious', 'acid-tongued', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'lone', 'jew', 'all-christian', 'school', 'unabashed', 'outcast', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'tell', 'anyone', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'especially', 'interesting', 'initially', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'whole', 'school', 'Mary', 'included', 'word', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Mary', 'Cassandra', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'her', 'important', 'part', 'Mary', 'changing', 'perspective', 'everything.Anyway', 'just', 'fun', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Michael', 'Stipe', 'proven', 'be', 'bit', 'good', 'screenwriter', 'songwriter', 'one', 'really', 'hope', 'write', 'more', 'great', 'stuff']",Saved!

One that believes that in the joy of sin will mankind once lost, find itself again.This is one of those rare instances where satan comes close to breaching the surface and showing himself. And the reason that he's so up close and personal is because he wants your children really really bad. At first glance, it appears to be just another Ferris Bueller style tongue-in-cheek comedy where the kids are all-wise and secretly hip, while their parents are clueless, glassy-eyed buffoons. But don't allow this to fool you. Just beneath the surface is a simmering evil... a blatant and obvious attack against the values of the church. Within the first five minutes alone it assaults the church's stance on illicit teen pregnancy, premarital sex and gayizm.Initially it seems to be directed at the children. But not even they are the real objective here. The church itself is the main target. Like the enemy who sews thistles in the farmer's wheat, this movie makes a direct attempt to pollute the hearts and minds of the young and impressionable. Especially those who have not yet made their own personal commitment to Christ.Yes, satan has been hard at work chipping away at the church every day since the birth of Jesus. But it has never been more obvious than it is now. And in movies like this, it is plain to see a familiar angle of attack: undermine the church from within by sowing seeds of doubt in the children who are already on a Godly path, and from without by slowly strangling it from a lack of new convertees.So in closing, I beseech you... stay away from this movie. There is a demon waiting to whisper its deceptive message of Godless secularism in each and every viewing. In fact, I'd rather my teenage children sit through a one-on-one session with an Ouija board before I'd let them near something this deceptive and depraved.

I was unsure what to make of it, and the reviews were so strangely mixed, that I knew it was just one of those films that I'd just have to see. And I'm glad I did! It's not a five-star movie (no teen romantic dramedy is!), but definitely four stars.For an accurate description, read the critics reviews, not the users. Caulkin was actually very good! He was very subtle and deadpan.Moore was able to poke fun at herself and did a fine job, and the main character, Malone, was wonderful.The film was funny, sad and romantic. Mostly funny...very funny.And, yes, the film is didactic, but not forcefully so (other than the scene at the prom). Oftentimes it takes seeing anothers small-mindedness to help foster tolerance in oneself, as is the case in this movie. What we're presented with is a group of different people each with a different problem that doesn't jive with the conservative interpretation of the bible. How does one reconcile their reality (ego) with their ideals (superego)?Lest I ramble too long, allow me to summarize: the film is good and preaches a good lesson.

842486,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0002OXRSG,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","When saved was released in theatres, I had several acquaintances and friends tell me that it was a really good movie. I was told that it dealt honestly with faith and that I should see it because ""it's also a Christian movie."" I was a bit surprised by some of these words of praise because they came from people who were mainly atheists and agnostics. I wasn't able to see the movie when it was in theatres and forgot about the film until I happened to see it while browsing at a local video store. I was in a reflective mood and wanted to watch something at least slightly philosophical and I thought SAVED! would be a good choice.The movie revolves around Mary (Jena Malone). Mary is going to be a high school senior at American Eagle Christian High School (notice the name of the school--it's supposed to be a joke). Mary's dating a really cute guy named Dean (Chad Faust). Despite their upbringing, Dean's pressured Mary to have sex, but Mary wants to preserve her virginity until she's married and she's resisted. Then Dean starts to exhibit some homosexual tendencies and reveals to Mary that he thinks he's gay. Mary is upset and prays about what is happening. In what she believes is an answer to her prayer, she believes she sees Jesus in a swimming pool and takes that as a sign that she's supposed to have sex with Dean to save him from turning gay. Dean's parents find gay pornography in Dean's room and ship him off to a place that supposedly specializes in ""degayification.""This opening set up is just the beginning of the movie, but it says a great deal about what the movie is really about. Mary's ""revelation"" is supposed to be funny. It's also supposed to be ironic that Mary, a goody-two-shoe who is known for promoting abstinence becomes pregnant the first time she has sex with a man who has given in to his homosexual tendencies. It's all supposed to be fun and in good humor. But that's where the filmmakers fail. There isn't anything funny at all about Mary's vision--God never asks a person to commit a sin in his name; God will not ask someone to do something that is against his nature. As for Mary's pregnancy, it becomes the central plot device through the rest of the film, but really isn't ironic (partially because of biology) and is more sad than anything else. From the opening scenes it becomes clear that though the filmmakers pretended to make a satirical drama about Christian fundamentalism, they failed to do so because they show very little knowledge about Christian faith and how things operate at a Christian school.As for the rest of the movie's plot, Mary returns to school and her close knit group of friends, including the school's favorite daughter, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore). At first things seem normal, but as Mary begins to deal with the very real issue of having a baby inside of her, it seems to her that Hilary and all of her old brigade are a bunch of pious fakes and hypocrites. Mary starts hanging out with a new crowd that includes the school's only ""Jewish"" student, Cassandra (Eva Amurri)--which is another inaccuracy by the filmmakers because Cassandra is Jewish in name only; Hilary's handicapped younger brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin); and the new principal's skater son, Patrick (Patrick Fugit). Mary's old friends initially want to bring her back into the fold and even attempt to kidnap her to exercise whatever demons are within her. Of course, after that the once-best friends become arch rivals and Mary becomes just another outcast. Mary doesn't even feel comfortable talking to her mother (Mary-Louise Parker) because she is involved in a ""secret"" relationship with Mary's principal, Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan). One thing follows another until the climax at the school's prom.Since seeing this film I have read many other comments and reviews about it and there are many who believe it is an anti-Christian movie. In fact, according to director Brian Dannelly, several Christians working on the film quit and during the production after realizing the full extent of the movie, a church, a Christian rock band, and the homeowner whose house was to be used for important scenes pulled out of productions because of objections over the movie's unflattering content. I can understand why people would be offended by the film and can see why they think it is anti-Christian.Personally, I do not believe that. However, it is quite apparent that the filmmakers didn't know the first thing about real Christianity. I think the writers either took every incident they have ever heard about (no matter how remotely) evangelical Christians doing crazy (and usually stupid) things and set them in a Christian high school so they could make a formula teen drama movie that preaches a message they like to hear, one about tolerance. [...]That's not to say that SAVED! is a terrible movie because it's not. It is a typical teen drama, but it offers some extraordinary acting. Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Patrick Fugit, and the rest of the cast give some superb performances. They bring humanity and life to what could have been just cardboard characters. Especially impressive is Macaulay Culkin; anyone who has any doubts talent as an actor should watch this film to erase those doubts. The movie, though formulaic, is well-paced and only looses steam at the conclusion.Overall SAVED! is basically another teen drama, but one that desperately wants people to discuss issues the movie raises. I don't fault the movie for that, but I do fault the film for the way it presents certain issues. The movie could have raised itself about the genre and actually been meaningful, but instead it turns out to be a bigger hypocrite than some of the ones portrayed in the film.",3,Faith Light or

842489,A8W8JNQ9BJUYB,B0002OXRSG,"Worgelm ""The Grumpy""","[3, 4]","""Saved"" presents us with about an hour of juicy satire, deliciously mean and sometimes hillarious observations about the trappings of fundamentalism.  Then inexplicably, with the finish line in sight, it wraps up in such perfectly trite teen soap-opera pablum that not even John Hughes himself would admit to having penned it.Mary (oh, the symbolism!) is a perfectly innocent youth at a fundamentalist Christian high school, and is dating an obviously effeminite closet homosexual Dean who figure-skates for Jesus.  When he finally comes out of the closet (in a pool - baptism - oh those clever filmmakers), she is so confused that she strikes her head and has a vision of Jesus.  Jesus advises her to save her boyfriend at any cost, so Mary, desparate to drag Dean away from his gay porn magazines, chooses the LEAST responsible solution to restore his masculinity and has sex with him.  Dean is found out soon thereafter and banished to ""mercy house,"" which is sort of a wayward home for banished troubled teens from Christian houses.  And Mary's troubles are just beginning, as she is destined to be saved by uber-Christian Mandy Moore, playing fast and loose with her good-girl movie image as the delightfully hateful Hillary Faye.Needless to say, the comic possibilities are endless from this point on and its surprising that the filmmakers don't pursue them more pointedly.  Its as if they are afraid to risk the ""R"".  There are some great moments, such as the scene where Mary symbollically questions her faith by using up all of the PG-13 cursing allotment in front of a church, or the Jesus-themed high school pep rally, complete with group prayer and Glossolalia.I think in the end the movie suffers the Hughes curse more because there are lots of characters who are interesting or potentially interesting, and not enough screen time to devote them the attention they deserve.  The relationship between Pastor Skip and Mary's mother, or Culkin's character Roland and his romance with Cassandra (played by Eva Amurri),  need to be juiced out more.  When the denouement finally arrives, it is resolved so perfectly and neatly that nearly destroys any of the precious or absurd insights these characters have.  When Pastor Skip gets dressed down, or Hillary Faye gets her comeuppance, it's not because of any sort of genuine insight, but we note its the end of the movie, and according to the teen movie playbook its the time where these plot elements are *supposed* to get wrapped up.  That the juicy dilemmas are reduced and everything is made okay damages the impact of the movie's liberalized pseudo-christian agenda and somewhat nullifies the insight into the mindset of a teen in a genuine crisis of faith such as Mary.  Note to the filmmakers: we're not asking for Citizen Kane every time you roll out the celluloid, but take a chance once in a while and tell the damn happy ending gnomes to take a hike.Still, this movie is not at all bad.  The movie's basic Christian message -  respecting other folks for who they are - may be a ""common"" observation, but let's be honest here - its one that bears repeating.  Survivors of fundamentalist christian internments like American Eagle High will probably have a good laugh and shudder at the same time.  As others have noted, the soundtrack is definitely up to troubled teen movie standards and then some (was that *REALLY* Paul Westerburg at the senior prom?) And while the movie saves most of the best barbs for Hillary Faye, it is generally respectful to all of its characters and their viewpoints, and the uneven script occasionally resonates with uncanny intelligence.  But for those of you (Christian and non-Christian alike) looking for a more insightful and powerful deliberation on religion and humanity, try Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".",3,Above average for an average teen comedy,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,3821,"['Saved', 'presents', 'hour', 'juicy', 'satire', 'deliciously', 'mean', 'sometimes', 'hillarious', 'observations', 'trappings', 'fundamentalism', 'Then', 'inexplicably', 'finish', 'line', 'sight', 'up', 'such', 'perfectly', 'trite', 'teen', 'soap-opera', 'pablum', 'not', 'even', 'John', 'Hughes', 'would', 'admit', 'having', 'penned', 'it.Mary', 'oh', 'symbolism', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'youth', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'high', 'school', 'dating', 'obviously', 'effeminite', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'Dean', 'who', 'Jesus', 'When', 'finally', 'closet', 'pool', 'baptism', 'oh', 'clever', 'filmmakers', 'so', 'confused', 'head', 'vision', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'save', 'boyfriend', 'cost', 'so', 'Mary', 'desparate', 'drag', 'Dean', 'away', 'gay', 'porn', 'magazines', 'LEAST', 'responsible', 'solution', 'restore', 'masculinity', 'sex', 'Dean', 'found', 'out', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'banished', 'mercy', 'house', 'sort', 'wayward', 'home', 'banished', 'troubled', 'teens', 'Christian', 'houses', 'Mary', 'troubles', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'destined', 'be', 'saved', 'uber-Christian', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'playing', 'fast', 'loose', 'good-girl', 'movie', 'image', 'delightfully', 'hateful', 'Hillary', 'Faye.Needless', 'say', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'point', 'surprising', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'more', 'pointedly', 'are', 'afraid', 'risk', 'R', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Mary', 'symbollically', 'questions', 'faith', 'using', 'up', 'PG-13', 'cursing', 'allotment', 'front', 'church', 'Jesus-themed', 'high', 'school', 'pep', 'rally', 'complete', 'group', 'prayer', 'Glossolalia.I', 'think', 'end', 'movie', 'Hughes', 'curse', 'more', 'are', 'lots', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'not', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'devote', 'attention', 'deserve', 'relationship', 'Pastor', 'Skip', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Culkin', 'character', 'Roland', 'romance', 'Cassandra', 'played', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'need', 'be', 'juiced', 'out', 'more', 'When', 'denouement', 'finally', 'resolved', 'so', 'perfectly', 'neatly', 'nearly', 'precious', 'absurd', 'insights', 'characters', 'have', 'When', 'Pastor', 'Skip', 'dressed', 'down', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'comeuppance', 'not', 'sort', 'genuine', 'insight', 'note', 'end', 'movie', 'according', 'teen', 'movie', 'playbook', 'time', 'where', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', '*supposed*', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'juicy', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'reduced', 'everything', 'made', 'okay', 'damages', 'impact', 'movie', 'liberalized', 'pseudo-christian', 'agenda', 'somewhat', 'insight', 'mindset', 'teen', 'genuine', 'crisis', 'faith', 'such', 'Mary', 'Note', 'filmmakers', ""'re"", 'not', 'asking', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'time', 'roll', 'out', 'celluloid', 'take', 'chance', 'once', 'while', 'tell', 'damn', 'happy', 'ending', 'gnomes', 'take', 'hike.Still', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'basic', 'Christian', 'message', 'respecting', 'other', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'may', 'be', 'common', 'observation', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'one', 'repeating', 'Survivors', 'fundamentalist', 'christian', 'internments', 'American', 'Eagle', 'High', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'shudder', 'same', 'time', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'soundtrack', 'definitely', 'troubled', 'teen', 'movie', 'standards', 'then', 'was', '*REALLY*', 'Paul', 'Westerburg', 'senior', 'prom', 'movie', 'most', 'best', 'barbs', 'Hillary', 'Faye', 'generally', 'respectful', 'characters', 'viewpoints', 'uneven', 'script', 'occasionally', 'uncanny', 'intelligence', 'Christian', 'non-Christian', 'alike', 'looking', 'more', 'insightful', 'powerful', 'deliberation', 'religion', 'humanity', 'try', 'Scorcese', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ']",Saved!
842490,A3OND36Q71G76D,B0002OXRSG,W. Scott Heitman,"[10, 14]","So there are two types of reviews on this movie: reviews from Christians and reviews from non-Christian.  Typically, the non-Christians love it and many of the Christians hate it- although I'm seeing a few positive reviews here from Christians...I'm a very conservative Christian.  I take the entire Bible to be the inspired word of God.  That said, I loved Saved!- the characters were lovable, the dialogue was witty, and nearly everything just worked.  I do take one issue with the movie, which I'll get to later.The movie parodies Christian society very well.  I've never attended a Christian school per se, but I've seen many of the absurdities portrayed in the movie, and I've even been a lot of them, myself.  It's very healthy to be able to laugh at yourself or something you're a part of, and Saved! gave me ample opportunity.The parodies of Christian society are also useful because they show Christian viewers how utterly foolish we must look sometimes to non-Christians.  That's not to say that we should compromise our beliefs (at all!), but we have PLENTY of room to lighten up.Meanwhile, the acting is fantastic.  I absolutely loved Jena Malone (she's awesome in everything), Culkin, and a couple others in their roles.  If the message of the movie to Christians is that we need to stop loving just fellow Christians and turn our attentions outwards to others, then the characters alone accomplish this mission.  I strongly cared for all of the non-Christian or doubting characters by the half-point of the movie.OK, let me mention where I take issue with the movie.  This is a long explanation here, but this isn't a simple matter.  The movie ultimately gets into a theme of accepting everybody as they are and uses homosexuality as the prime example of society's inability to accept everybody.  I say there is a great difference between 1) loving everybody regardless of orientation and 2) accepting homosexual behavior.  (Certainly you've heard ""love the sinner, hate the sin"".)  The NEW testament is actually very explicit that acts of homosexuality are sins.  Saved! seems to want to ignore the Bible, itself- and that one thing I can't accept.On a practical level of treating people better, though, it has a point.  Homosexuality may be a sin, but so is robbery, lust, and the common lie.  Even though these are all sins, society tends to treat homosexuals as lepers rather than as people that Christ would love just as much as any other person.I must add, though, that loving those who are sinning (that's everybody) sometimes requires warning them that they are sinning and helping them through it- it may sound hard and mean, but love isn't always the fuzzy thing we've been taught about.  The movie does make a point, though- certainly the characters in the movie don't take this loving path- they want to hide problems rather than deal with them.But I digress...I didn't want to talk about that issue too little because it is a complex issue that Saved! gets half right.If you're a Christian wondering whether this movie is too hostile to your faith, then I encourage you to give it a try.  I found it thoughtful, touching, and thoroughly entertaining.",5,Fantastic! - with one reservation,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,3177,"['So', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'reviews', 'movie', 'reviews', 'Christians', 'reviews', 'non-Christian', 'Typically', 'non-Christians', 'love', 'many', 'Christians', 'hate', 'it-', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'few', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'Christians', ""'m"", 'very', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'take', 'entire', 'Bible', 'be', 'inspired', 'word', 'God', 'said', 'loved', 'Saved', 'characters', 'were', 'lovable', 'dialogue', 'was', 'witty', 'nearly', 'everything', 'just', 'worked', 'do', 'take', 'one', 'issue', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.The', 'movie', 'parodies', 'Christian', 'society', 'very', 'well', ""'ve"", 'never', 'attended', 'Christian', 'school', 'se', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'absurdities', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'even', 'been', 'lot', 'very', 'healthy', 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'something', ""'re"", 'part', 'Saved', 'gave', 'ample', 'opportunity.The', 'parodies', 'Christian', 'society', 'are', 'also', 'useful', 'show', 'Christian', 'viewers', 'how', 'utterly', 'foolish', 'must', 'look', 'sometimes', 'non-Christians', 'not', 'say', 'should', 'compromise', 'beliefs', 'have', 'PLENTY', 'room', 'lighten', 'up.Meanwhile', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'awesome', 'everything', 'Culkin', 'couple', 'others', 'roles', 'message', 'movie', 'Christians', 'need', 'stop', 'loving', 'just', 'fellow', 'Christians', 'turn', 'attentions', 'outwards', 'others', 'then', 'characters', 'alone', 'accomplish', 'mission', 'strongly', 'cared', 'non-Christian', 'doubting', 'characters', 'half-point', 'movie.OK', 'let', 'mention', 'where', 'take', 'issue', 'movie', 'long', 'explanation', 'here', ""n't"", 'simple', 'matter', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'theme', 'accepting', 'everybody', 'are', 'homosexuality', 'prime', 'example', 'society', 'inability', 'accept', 'everybody', 'say', 'great', 'difference', '1', 'loving', 'everybody', 'regardless', 'orientation', '2', 'accepting', 'homosexual', 'behavior', 'Certainly', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'love', 'sinner', 'hate', 'sin', 'NEW', 'testament', 'actually', 'very', 'explicit', 'acts', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'sins', 'Saved', 'want', 'ignore', 'Bible', 'itself-', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept.On', 'practical', 'level', 'treating', 'people', 'better', 'point', 'Homosexuality', 'may', 'be', 'sin', 'so', 'robbery', 'lust', 'common', 'lie', 'Even', 'are', 'sins', 'society', 'tends', 'treat', 'homosexuals', 'lepers', 'rather', 'people', 'Christ', 'would', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'person.I', 'must', 'add', 'though', 'loving', 'who', 'are', 'sinning', 'everybody', 'sometimes', 'warning', 'are', 'sinning', 'helping', 'it-', 'may', 'sound', 'hard', 'mean', 'love', ""n't"", 'always', 'fuzzy', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taught', 'movie', 'make', 'point', 'though-', 'certainly', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'loving', 'path-', 'want', 'hide', 'problems', 'rather', 'deal', 'them.But', 'digress', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'issue', 'too', 'little', 'complex', 'issue', 'Saved', 'half', 'right.If', ""'re"", 'Christian', 'wondering', 'movie', 'too', 'hostile', 'faith', 'then', 'encourage', 'give', 'try', 'found', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining']",Saved!

I did it on a whim, felt like going to a show and it was the only title I recognized. I'm agnostic, and not easily offended by any real humor directed at religion, but sitting through ninety minuets of secular propaganda is not my idea of fun. I'm glad I gave it a chance.I didn't find the humor in Saved offensive. Most of it is border-line slapstick. It doesn't attack Christian belief's or fundamental's. It has fun with the religions quirks. Some of the humor in the move is laugh-out-loud. Some is silent-chuckle. Some doesn't work at all. To be honest, the humor in the move would not be enough for me to recommend seeing it. What saves this film (pun intended-forgive me) are the touching moments pulled off by the characters and cast.The film centers on a sweet, nave, devoutly religious young girl who, in trying do a good and-in her mind-Christian thing for her boyfriend, becomes pregnant. She's played by Jena Malone, who has quickly become one of my favorite young actresses (also fantastic in Donnie Darko). This wouldn't be half the film without her. It's impossible not to sympathize with her and the enormous difficulty of her situation. This makes it also impossible to judge her as she questions (or completely looses) her faith.She soon finds herself cast out of her social circle and befriended by two other misfits. A boy who has no faith because he's crippled, and a girl who has no faith in Christianity because she's Jewish. Much of the movie deals with them butting heads with the self-righteous queen-bee of the school.The rest of the cast is also good. The most complex character is probably the pastor. He's a character who shows real caring and affection for his students/ parishioners in some scenes and intolerance and unacceptance in others. There is his great last scene at the end where he is torn between being a nice guy who wants to reach out and be there for the people he cares about, and being a strong moral leader. It's funny and sad at the same time.There are some moments where the movie crosses the line and seems to try making points about Christianity. One scene near the end where the students gang-up on the pastor and confront him about social intolerance made me feel like they should have been the ones speaking behind a pulpit. But the movie crosses this line only once or twice. Not nearly enough to diminish all the good parts of the film.If you're a deeply religious person or someone who thinks religion is a subject that shouldn't be treated lightly than this movie probably isn't for you. If your not that person, or even a Christian who's able to take a little nudge-in-the-rib humor about the stereotypes others have about your religion, you might want to see this. You'll probably find it offers more than promised from the previews and critical reviews. I did.",3,Not anti-Christian. Not pro-Christian.

Then how she figures she can ""fix"" him and the consequences of her failed attempt to do so...Those who have been brought up believing in a christian/catholic/mormon/protestant faith and are having doubts - or have become athiest or agnostic or just plain free from the fanaticism and oppression of religion - would probably get a kick out of this movie.Jena Malone is a very beautiful and talented actress who is proving herself in every role she plays. In Saved, she is the pivotal character who is trying to find her place in the religious atmosphere she lives in. The Rules tell her she is evil, yet she knows she is doing good things. With oppression and an attempted exorcism by her friends, who think she has become possessed by the devil just because she has started keeping to herself, she has a lot to deal with here and does a great job...Mandy Moore plays - you guessed it - the goody two shoes preppy witch with a B. And of course, she also conveniently has a scene where she belts out a christian song on stage. But after all her character's fanaticism and prejudice, justice falls flat in her face and she gets what she deserves.The movie is not just a christian movie. It deals with real life, religious fanaticism, and how people can come to terms with their own flaws and be fine with them. The feeling one gets when Mandy Moore's character throws a bible at Jena Malone's character screaming ""I am filled with christ's love!"" is how many of us feel when a religious fanatic tries to scare us into conversion. And, like Jena Malone's character, we are upset and somewhat confounded that these fanatics are so blinded by their faith that they just cannot accept that some people are different.McCauley Culkin is suave and quirky as the wheel-chair bound kid who falls for the ""evil girl"" who apparently is a jewish - turned catholic - teen who rebels under peer pressure, yet has a warm heart for those in need.It's funny, deals with the consequences of actions, and has amazing performances by much of the primary cast.",4,"Funny, realistic, excellent acting!",1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2141,"['Saved', 'funny', 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'dealing', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'announced', 'gay', 'Then', 'how', 'can', 'fix', 'consequences', 'failed', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'believing', 'christian/catholic/mormon/protestant', 'faith', 'are', 'having', 'doubts', 'have', 'become', 'athiest', 'agnostic', 'just', 'plain', 'free', 'fanaticism', 'oppression', 'religion', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'kick', 'movie.Jena', 'Malone', 'very', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'proving', 'role', 'Saved', 'pivotal', 'character', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'religious', 'atmosphere', 'Rules', 'tell', 'evil', 'yet', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'oppression', 'attempted', 'exorcism', 'friends', 'who', 'think', 'become', 'possessed', 'devil', 'just', 'started', 'keeping', 'herself', 'lot', 'deal', 'here', 'great', 'job', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'guessed', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'preppy', 'witch', 'B', 'course', 'also', 'conveniently', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'christian', 'song', 'stage', 'character', 'fanaticism', 'prejudice', 'justice', 'falls', 'flat', 'face', 'what', 'deserves.The', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'christian', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'flaws', 'be', 'fine', 'feeling', 'one', 'when', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'bible', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'screaming', 'am', 'filled', 'christ', 'love', 'how', 'many', 'feel', 'when', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'tries', 'scare', 'conversion', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'are', 'upset', 'somewhat', 'confounded', 'fanatics', 'are', 'so', 'blinded', 'faith', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'people', 'are', 'different.McCauley', 'Culkin', 'suave', 'quirky', 'wheel-chair', 'bound', 'kid', 'who', 'evil', 'girl', 'who', 'apparently', 'jewish', 'turned', 'catholic', 'teen', 'who', 'peer', 'pressure', 'yet', 'warm', 'heart', 'need.It', 'funny', 'deals', 'consequences', 'actions', 'amazing', 'performances', 'much', 'primary', 'cast']",Saved!
