1648610,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00CL1516E,Acute Observer,"[20, 42]","Perry Mason Complete Series PackThe ""Perry Mason"" TV show lasted nine seasons, a record then. Few TV series lasted longer (""Gunsmoke"", ""Bonanza""). Erle Stanley Gardner was ""the World's Greatest Author"" in his time, his books outsold the combined totals of his competitors. His stories were as stylized as baseball games. Season 1 used 36 of his novels for its 39 episodes, Season 2 used 15 of his novels for the 30 episodes. That was over half of his Perry Mason novels. The original novels are better. The films were the simplified and condensed versions of the novels, or new material. The later episodes became a formula where someone would confess in court at the end of the story. No story ever dealt with a false confession as in the 1947 movie ""Boomerang"". In its day ""Perry Mason"" was criticized for never losing a case. What is the record for most police TV shows? There is a Perry Mason Television Book on this series, you can find it on the Internet.Gardner's novels educated the readers by using examples from law and science or new technology. He dedicated novels to an important person in medicine or law. Gardner founded ""The Court of Last Resort"" to exonerate the convicted innocent. Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some of this stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). ""Perry Mason"" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. [There is a famous crime with these elements. You can read about Sacco & Vanzetti where they were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis. Many believed they were innocent and were convicted as part of the repression of the 1920s. There was no physical evidence to link them to the crime.]Erle Stanley Gardner generally avoided politics in this ""Perry Mason"" novels. Some of the ""A.A. Fair"" novels used political corruption in their stories. The 1967 novel ""The Case of the Queenly Contestant"" was publicized for the remark that a bullet found on a stretcher was not proof of anything. Dr. Milton Halpern was blacklisted by the government for criticizing the autopsy of JFK for its lack of an experienced medical examiner. A book written about the TV show said William Talman was not the first choice for DA Hamilton Burger. Raymond Burr played a DA in ""A Place in the Sun"" and a villain in earlier films like ""Borderline"". There were other legal dramas (""The Practice"") but never lasted nine seasons.",5,The Invincible Advocate,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2741,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Complete', 'Series', 'PackThe', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'TV', 'show', 'lasted', 'nine', 'seasons', 'record', 'then', 'Few', 'TV', 'series', 'lasted', 'longer', 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Author', 'time', 'books', 'outsold', 'combined', 'totals', 'competitors', 'stories', 'were', 'as', 'stylized', 'baseball', 'games', 'Season', '1', 'used', '36', 'novels', '39', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'used', '15', 'novels', '30', 'episodes', 'was', 'half', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'novels', 'original', 'novels', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'were', 'simplified', 'condensed', 'versions', 'novels', 'new', 'material', 'later', 'episodes', 'became', 'formula', 'where', 'someone', 'would', 'confess', 'court', 'end', 'story', 'No', 'story', 'ever', 'false', 'confession', '1947', 'movie', 'Boomerang', 'day', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'criticized', 'never', 'losing', 'case', 'What', 'record', 'most', 'police', 'TV', 'shows', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Television', 'Book', 'series', 'can', 'find', 'Internet.Gardner', 'novels', 'educated', 'readers', 'using', 'examples', 'law', 'science', 'new', 'technology', 'dedicated', 'novels', 'important', 'person', 'medicine', 'law', 'Gardner', 'founded', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'exonerate', 'convicted', 'innocent', 'Gardner', 'stories', 'warned', 'dangers', 'invalid', 'eyewitness', 'identification', 'drawing', 'wrong', 'conclusions', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'guilt', 'inference', 'prematurely', 'accusing', 'suspect', 'evidence', 'was', 'gathered', 'evaluated', 'stories', 'made', 'point', 'ballistics', 'can', 'identify', 'gun', 'fired', 'bullet', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'fired', 'crime', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'advised', 'clients', 'never', 'lie', 'police', 'was', 'better', 'say', 'nothing', 'call', 'lawyer', 'famous', 'crime', 'elements', 'can', 'read', 'Sacco', 'Vanzetti', 'where', 'were', 'convicted', 'robbery', 'murder', 'spite', 'alibis', 'Many', 'believed', 'were', 'innocent', 'were', 'convicted', 'part', 'repression', '1920s', 'was', 'physical', 'evidence', 'link', 'crime', ']', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'generally', 'avoided', 'politics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'novels', 'A.A.', 'Fair', 'novels', 'used', 'political', 'corruption', 'stories', '1967', 'novel', 'Case', 'Queenly', 'Contestant', 'was', 'publicized', 'remark', 'bullet', 'found', 'stretcher', 'was', 'not', 'proof', 'anything', 'Dr.', 'Milton', 'Halpern', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'government', 'criticizing', 'autopsy', 'JFK', 'lack', 'experienced', 'medical', 'examiner', 'book', 'written', 'TV', 'show', 'said', 'William', 'Talman', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'DA', 'Hamilton', 'Burger', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'played', 'DA', 'Place', 'Sun', 'villain', 'earlier', 'films', 'Borderline', 'were', 'other', 'legal', 'dramas', 'Practice', 'never', 'lasted', 'nine', 'seasons']",Perry Mason: Complete Series Pack

Here in Utah our local PBS station has been playing a few episodes from here and there, very spotty and I can't tell if they're doing it sequence..so out of boredom I looked up the perry mason tv episodes on Wikipedia...Holy cow there's 270 of them!!  Turns out a bunch of these episodes have never been released for syndication either so they only showed the episode during their original tv airing...also there's apparently an episode where Perry technically loses a case...Anyway I knew i had to buy all of them.. I figure at my rate it's going to take me a good year to watch them all (or more..).  Some are quirky...some are very dated...(50's...times were...really different back then haha..and what about women's bras back there holy cow talk about pointed..) but for cold winter nights or not much going on and I feel like watching Perry Mason?  I got it covered...Anyway, I'm happy with the purchase.  All 9 seasons are here.  I wish they had these for blue ray (not for quality because the quality is good enough but...just to put more episodes on less disc's..) but I'm enjoying it and if you're a Perry Mason fan I think this is a good buy....some of these videos were like $20~$40 per season...and that was too much for 9 seasons...also the order of the episodes are in order of them being aired originally so you might get confused why some are out of sequence...so far I haven't seen any issues with the DVD's or quality...course then I'm only on Season 3...Great purchase - would do it again!",5,Della...get contact the drake detective agency...get paul working on it...,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1598,"['weird', 'love', 'perry', 'mason', ""'m"", '35', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', '60', 'Here', 'Utah', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'been', 'playing', 'few', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'spotty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'doing', 'boredom', 'looked', 'up', 'perry', 'mason', 'tv', 'episodes', 'Wikipedia', 'Holy', 'cow', '270', 'out', 'bunch', 'episodes', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'syndication', 'only', 'showed', 'episode', 'original', 'tv', 'airing', 'also', 'apparently', 'episode', 'where', 'Perry', 'technically', 'case', 'Anyway', 'knew', 'i', 'had', 'buy', 'them..', 'figure', 'rate', 'going', 'take', 'good', 'year', 'watch', 'more..', 'are', 'quirky', 'are', 'very', 'dated', '50', 'times', 'were', 'really', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'haha..and', 'what', 'women', 'bras', 'back', 'cow', 'talk', 'pointed..', 'cold', 'winter', 'nights', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'feel', 'watching', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'got', 'covered', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'happy', 'purchase', '9', 'seasons', 'are', 'here', 'wish', 'had', 'blue', 'ray', 'not', 'quality', 'quality', 'good', 'enough', 'just', 'put', 'more', 'episodes', 'less', ""disc's.."", ""'m"", 'enjoying', ""'re"", 'Perry', 'Mason', 'fan', 'think', 'good', 'buy', '.some', 'videos', 'were', '20~', '40', 'season', 'was', 'too', 'much', '9', 'seasons', 'also', 'order', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'being', 'aired', 'originally', 'so', 'might', 'get', 'confused', 'why', 'are', 'sequence', 'so', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'issues', 'DVD', 'quality', 'course', 'then', ""'m"", 'only', 'Season', '3', 'Great', 'purchase', 'would', 'do', 'again']",Perry Mason: Complete Series Pack

1648623,ASM25WTP80PMR,B00CL1516E,Reader,"[60, 61]","Wonderful to see these old shows again.To set some expectations...Not a boxed set. The individually shrink-wrapped season packs are banded into one giant bundle and shrink-wrapped overall. (A lot of work to get it all unwrapped.)Doesn't appear to include the bonus material that is part of the 4-disc ""50th Anniversary Edition"" sampler package. (The Anniversary Edition is inexpensive - and well worth buying for the test scenes alone. The contrast between William Hopper and Raymond Burr, each testing as Perry Mason is very interesting. Burr had already completely worked out the subtle character of Perry Mason. Burr as Hamilton Burger just didn't have the edge. No tests of Barbara Hale or William Tallman.)The order of the episodes on the discs is apparently the order in which the episodes were filmed, which does not always match the order of first broadcast given in the IMDB and in the Wikipedia episode list. This explains why sometimes the same cast members appear a couple of episodes apart on the discs, and why Wesley Lau is an ordinary suspect in one episode - and a detective lieutenant a couple of episodes later.Some glitches in producing the sets. For example, the cast list for ""The Case of the Sad Sicilian"" on disc 8/2/2 is also given as the cast list for ""The Case of the Nebulous Nephew"" on disc 7/1/1. (Very obvious given the Italian names of the characters and actors.)There are editing anomalies in some episodes. Sometimes a character pops up without any transition. Or there are odd transitions. For example, in ""The Case of the Hateful Hero"" (6/1/1) at 11:53 there is an odd truncated snippet of music - and it cuts to a closeup of a nameplate on a desk - ""Fleta York"" - as though picking up on a name mentioned earlier in the episode. She has two lines in that scene and never appears again - but the actress is listed on the first page of the credits ahead of actors who had bigger roles.These may be last-minute edits done when the original shows were made, or short chunks of damaged film that they couldn't restore, or lost for some other reason. Another commenter suggests that there may have been music rights issues.I checked a few episode lengths. The episode lengths are consistent within 15 seconds between the episodes in each season -  varying from 50 minutes to more than 52 minutes as network advertising space requirements changed over time.Perry Mason was not Great Cinema Art - and that's part of the fun. Making enough episodes of a one-hour show to fill a season is not precise or easy. There are different directors and styles. The guests sometimes chew the scenery (for example Jeanette Nolan in the ""Hateful Hero"") but Burr manages to work with them all. The plots often have major holes, especially when an entire Gardner book is condensed into a TV episode. Sometimes the story feels a bit ""off"" because it was not originally written for Perry Mason and has been adapted. The camera dolly wobbles. Someone drops something on the set. Sometimes an actor fluffs a line and it is fixed by re-recording the audio.The beautiful black-and-white photography is well-preserved and the sound is excellent. (When changing over from watching a color movie to watch a black-and-white Perry Mason episode, take a moment to adjust the contrast. It works best on my set to also turn the color level to zero.)The subtle portrayal by Raymond Burr; the fun he has in scenes with Ray Collins; the way Burr never steals scenes from other actors. The interplay between the ongoing characters. The teamwork and subtle humor. The way Mason, Drake, Berger, and Tragg often work together to nail the real murderer. (I never really realized how good William Tallman was in that role until I saw the Raymond Burr test for the Hamilton Berger role from the ""Anniversary"" set.)The series is also an insight into how things have changed over the decades: phone booths; the loving shots of the huge cars lent by Ford; people smoking all the time and offering each other cigarettes; racial and ethnic typecasting; men and women sometimes wearing hats; women wearing gloves; getting from place to place in LA in 15 minutes or to a beach house in 30 minutes...Great to see these again!",4,"Setting your expectations...

1648625,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00CL1516E,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[0, 0]","Perry Mason was the very definitionof what it meant to be a great lawyer.  There are few alive who haven't heard of Perry Mason.  Perry Mason is part of the cultural lexicon. If a lawyer does a really good job its considered a compliment to be called a real life, ""Perry Mason!""  Perry Mason struck a chord in America, he was a real hard nosed lawyer who was not afraid to sweat the details.  Perry Mason knew his stuff in the courtroom, the boardroom and on the streets.Helped by his able bodied executive assistant Della Street Perry Mason was always one step ahead of the criminals and prosecutor Burger.  The characters in Perry Mason were stock type characters.  Lt Tragg was the perfect hard bitten police detective, mistrustful, sly and cunning.  Always Tragg a sharp witty thing at the ready in hopes of catching Perry Mason off guard. The people who could afford to engage Perry Mason were generally from the upper classes behaving badly. It must be noted that one episode featured Perry Mason taking the case of a very poor lady who could never afford Perry Masons real life fees yet she engaged him. Perry Mason was the ladies advocate fighting for her cause with typical Perry Mason zeal.  He spared no expense investigating her case via Mr Drake Mason's favorite private detective.In the end the ladies cause was vindicated she won her case. Still oblivious to the true cost of the legal procedings she gave Perry Mason a few dollars down payment on her legal bill.  The kindly lady promised to make good on her entire bill having no idea of the real cost. Perry graciously took the small amount of money. Della processed it at which time we saw the real breakdown of the expenses associated with her case.  It was in the thousands. Perry told the sweet lady her tiny sum covered the entire expense of her case her bill was satisfied.  That showed me Perry Mason had a heart, that was the best episode in the series for me and it won Perry Mason my undying respect.Perry Mason while not strictly a Film Noir vehicle is still chock full of awesome film noir qualities.  The black and white media gives the world of Perry Mason a film noir quality as light and shadow are often used effectively to create mood and convey clandestine activities. Mr. Drake was a playboy and a good private investigator of a quality firm.  Drake was dapper and self assured if just a bit stiff.  I had a few of the Perry Mason episodes but I enjoy Perry Mason so much when the complete series pack was released I had to have it.  many people today hate anything in black and white. What most people don't realize that telling a story in black & white is a much richer experience because; it must draw you in, Good black and white story telling invites the viewer to fill in the voids with their own color.  Black and white stories challenge the viewer to participate in the narrative by supplying their own color via imagination.Color TV and todays show everything culture including every gruesome or sexual detail leaves nothing to the imagination. Black & White story telling does not encourage you to use your imagination it demands that you contribute to the viewing experience as you infuse the story with your own color. Perry Mason shows our adversarial legal system functioning at its best.  I'm too young to remember Perry Mason when it played prime time. I do remember Perry Mason was the last show to air Friday nights when I was young and TV went off the air at 12 midnight not to return till 6 AM the next morning.  I remember that on Fridays I was allowed to stay up and watch Perry Mason, then I had to go to sleep.  Awaken your best Perry Mason memories or check Perry Mason out for the first time.  See Perry Mason and experience our legal system the way it was meant to be.",5,PERRY MASON WAS THE VERY DEFINITION OF WHAT IT WAS TO BE A GREAT LAWYER IF JUST IN FICTION - BUT WHAT GREAT FICTION IT WAS!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,3783,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'very', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'great', 'lawyer', 'are', 'few', 'alive', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'part', 'cultural', 'lexicon', 'lawyer', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'considered', 'compliment', 'be', 'called', 'real', 'life', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'struck', 'chord', 'America', 'was', 'real', 'hard', 'nosed', 'lawyer', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'sweat', 'details', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'knew', 'stuff', 'courtroom', 'boardroom', 'streets.Helped', 'able', 'bodied', 'executive', 'assistant', 'Della', 'Street', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'criminals', 'prosecutor', 'Burger', 'characters', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'were', 'stock', 'type', 'characters', 'Lt', 'Tragg', 'was', 'perfect', 'hard', 'bitten', 'police', 'detective', 'mistrustful', 'sly', 'cunning', 'Always', 'Tragg', 'sharp', 'witty', 'thing', 'ready', 'hopes', 'catching', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'off', 'guard', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'engage', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'were', 'generally', 'upper', 'classes', 'behaving', 'badly', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'one', 'episode', 'featured', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'taking', 'case', 'very', 'poor', 'lady', 'who', 'could', 'never', 'afford', 'Perry', 'Masons', 'real', 'life', 'fees', 'yet', 'engaged', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'ladies', 'advocate', 'fighting', 'cause', 'typical', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'zeal', 'spared', 'expense', 'investigating', 'case', 'Mr', 'Drake', 'Mason', 'favorite', 'private', 'detective.In', 'end', 'ladies', 'cause', 'was', 'vindicated', 'won', 'case', 'Still', 'oblivious', 'true', 'cost', 'legal', 'procedings', 'gave', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'few', 'dollars', 'down', 'payment', 'legal', 'bill', 'kindly', 'lady', 'promised', 'make', 'good', 'entire', 'bill', 'having', 'idea', 'real', 'cost', 'Perry', 'graciously', 'took', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'Della', 'processed', 'time', 'saw', 'real', 'breakdown', 'expenses', 'associated', 'case', 'was', 'thousands', 'Perry', 'told', 'sweet', 'lady', 'tiny', 'sum', 'covered', 'entire', 'expense', 'case', 'bill', 'was', 'satisfied', 'showed', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'had', 'heart', 'was', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'won', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'undying', 'respect.Perry', 'Mason', 'not', 'strictly', 'Film', 'Noir', 'vehicle', 'still', 'chock', 'full', 'awesome', 'film', 'noir', 'qualities', 'black', 'white', 'media', 'world', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'film', 'noir', 'quality', 'light', 'shadow', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'effectively', 'create', 'mood', 'convey', 'clandestine', 'activities', 'Mr.', 'Drake', 'was', 'playboy', 'good', 'private', 'investigator', 'quality', 'firm', 'Drake', 'was', 'dapper', 'assured', 'just', 'bit', 'stiff', 'had', 'few', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'enjoy', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'complete', 'series', 'pack', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'have', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'hate', 'anything', 'black', 'white', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'telling', 'story', 'black', 'white', 'much', 'richer', 'experience', 'must', 'draw', 'Good', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'telling', 'viewer', 'fill', 'voids', 'own', 'color', 'Black', 'white', 'stories', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'participate', 'narrative', 'supplying', 'own', 'color', 'imagination.Color', 'TV', 'show', 'everything', 'culture', 'including', 'gruesome', 'sexual', 'detail', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'Black', 'White', 'story', 'telling', 'not', 'encourage', 'use', 'imagination', 'contribute', 'viewing', 'experience', 'infuse', 'story', 'own', 'color', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'adversarial', 'legal', 'system', 'functioning', 'best', ""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'when', 'played', 'prime', 'time', 'do', 'remember', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'last', 'show', 'air', 'Friday', 'nights', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'TV', 'went', 'air', '12', 'midnight', 'not', 'return', 'till', '6', 'AM', 'next', 'morning', 'remember', 'Fridays', 'was', 'allowed', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'then', 'had', 'go', 'sleep', 'Awaken', 'best', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'memories', 'check', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'first', 'time', 'See', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'experience', 'legal', 'system', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be']",Perry Mason: Complete Series Pack

He was a real trial lawyer, even if most all of his cases were won during the Preliminary Hearing. Like others, I wish this series was offered as a boxed set; not the series in a box.
