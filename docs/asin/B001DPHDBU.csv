1182642,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B001DPHDBU,Brett Corkins,"[0, 0]","I've loved Scrubs from the get-go. Its always been my favorite comedy on TV, and probably always will be. That being said, season seven was a disappointment...in a sense.The season as a whole is good, with some major happenings. As for the DVD, the first disc is classic Scrubs. It's extremely funny and even has a few parts that get you thinking. The second disc is where things wander off. I understand the season was cut short due to the writers strike. I get that. But the second disc's episodes aren't that good. I can watch them, and yes I'll laugh, but it's not the Scrubs we all know and love. It's different.I do like JD's progression from young inexperienced intern to older accomplished doctor/father. His transformation is one that has captivated me completely. Not to mention Turk and Carla's relationship. And is it just me or was it a mistake for them to be done with Elizabeth Banks? She was incredible in every episode she was in. Past that, it's business as usual at Sacred Heart.As passable as this season was, it had THE WORST season finale (that really wasn't) ever. If you haven't seen it, Dr. Cox is telling his son a bedtime story, that of course features everyone at Sacred Heart. Minus a couple pretty good parts, it was a complete letdown that went against pretty much everything Scrubs is.At the end of the day this IS Scrubs. So you can expect laughs. And if this is what we had to be given to get us to the eighth season--which is shaping up to be one of the best yet--I'll deal with it.",4,Scrubs-lite,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,1517,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'Scrubs', 'get-go', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'TV', 'probably', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'being', 'said', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'disappointment', 'sense.The', 'season', 'whole', 'good', 'major', 'happenings', 'DVD', 'first', 'disc', 'classic', 'Scrubs', 'extremely', 'funny', 'even', 'few', 'parts', 'get', 'thinking', 'second', 'disc', 'where', 'things', 'wander', 'understand', 'season', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'due', 'writers', 'strike', 'get', 'second', 'disc', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'can', 'watch', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'not', 'Scrubs', 'know', 'love', 'different.I', 'do', 'JD', 'progression', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'intern', 'older', 'accomplished', 'doctor/father', 'transformation', 'one', 'captivated', 'completely', 'Not', 'mention', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'relationship', 'just', 'was', 'mistake', 'be', 'done', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'was', 'incredible', 'episode', 'was', 'Past', 'business', 'usual', 'Sacred', 'Heart.As', 'passable', 'season', 'was', 'had', 'THE', 'WORST', 'season', 'finale', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'telling', 'son', 'bedtime', 'story', 'course', 'features', 'everyone', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'couple', 'pretty', 'good', 'parts', 'was', 'complete', 'letdown', 'went', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Scrubs', 'end', 'day', 'Scrubs', 'can', 'expect', 'laughs', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'given', 'get', 'eighth', 'season', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'deal']",Scrubs: Season 7

Ah well, M*A*S*H went on for several times longer than the Korean War actually lasted, so much can be forgiven in the name of consistently screwball comedy seamlessly intermingled with truly poignant dramatic moments. This seventh season was truncated by the writers' strike, and there truly do seem to be some curious gaps in the overall story arc... stories left incomplete, and whole characters and situations that are essentially left hanging in mid-air, with only eleven episodes in the season. There are a couple of funny ongoing bits, never developed - the female intern with a voice so helium-high that the eternally sarcastic Dr. Cox doesn't even want to listen to her speak, and some off-again-on-again-off-again romance between an assortment of couples that seems to just fizzle into the off-position from lack of interest.There was only one razzle-dazzle all-stops out and over the top episode; one of those which heads into the surreal for the entire length of the episode, instead of just momentary lurching in that direction.  ""My Princess"" - was told as a magical fairy tale sequence and appropriately showcased among the extra features as a ""making of"" sequence. Other extras included the obligatory alternate lines, deleted scenes and bloopers, most of which make you wonder why they weren't used instead, being at least as funny as what was included in the broadcast.

It didn't go out with a bang or even a whimper, but rather with a far-off flushing sound.

Without that romantic tension anymore, it's going to evolve into a live-action version of ""Dilbert"" (if it hasn't already - I only saw a few episodes from the fourth season, but the mood HAS changed a lot compared to the last two seasons).Thank God for the invention of DVD, though - at least I have BBC shows and Anime to entertain me 'til it's time to check out of this insane planet.Thanks to Scrubs for so many great episodes and having a worldview I could relate to - you deserved a 'final season' at best, a special finale episode at least.

Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with Season 7.  A number of characters went through a personality change.  The deceased nurse Laverne was brought back as nurse Shirley.  JD's insecurity gave way to a focus on his immaturity.  Dr. Cox softened up and no longer intimidated the other doctors (except when choosing not to stick up for Dr. Kelso).  The Janitor lost his mystique, becoming more human and vulnerable.  The Todd became even more of a buffoon.  Dr. Kelso was relegated to one liners from the background and then eventually written out of the show.  Jordan developed into a whiny distraction.  A new intern - Josephine - was added as a truly annoying, one-dimensional character.The good news: Background characters like Doug, Ted, Snoop Dog Attending, and Dr. Beardface were more relevant to the story lines.  The fairy tale episode was a good change of pace. (But did it really need to end on a sad note?).
