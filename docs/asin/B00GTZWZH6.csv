I used to watch the Sci Fi channel (yeah before they changed it to Sy Fy)) a lot but now their programming stinks. Big time. Other channels are getting my viewing time with Agents of shield ,The 100,  Almost Human and so on. Was the channel acquired by some redneck ? This channel has deteriorated with more and more stupid reality programming and wrestling. It seems you forgot who your fan base was. I guess you just want to pander to the low IQ crowd. You are certainly achieving your goal. I guess you put Homer Simpson in charge of programming. If I could think of a way to excoriate you more I would most happily do so.

Such was the case with Warehouse 13, but it took re-watching the pilot, after the Final Episode, to see how far the series has sunk.  SyFy appears to have gotten bored.Of course the very premise of the show is questionable at best---if even one of these artifacts is as dangerous as they are demonstrated to be, why would you put them all together in one place where the chances of some undesireable getting their hands on them, any of them, would be so much easier than having to traipse the world?  So, what we've got is something of a detective fantasy, where instead of high tech gizmos with which to solve crimes (or Grimm Fairy tale animals in real life) here the ""crimes"" are caused by artifacts that either someone has come into possession of accidentally, or has sought them out for illicit gain.  Secret Service agents Latimer and Bering are sent out on one mission after another to ""snag, bag, and tag"" these artifacts.The early episodes, of the first two seasons or so, were a marvel of steam punk aesthetic paired with action adventure.  Remember when the Warehouse had a zipline?  The big old computer with the ancient typewriter keys?  The cast grew--nicely I thought---but the fantasy began to fade, the steampunk slipped ever further into the background.  I can't even really remember seeing much of it anywhere in Season 5.  And it's not just  that.  The whole show was getting ever more stupid (and it wasn't very literary from the start...) well before Season 4 came to a conclusion with Latimer acting like a boy-man moron.  Season 5 resolves the last episode in the first show, then it pops back and forth until---way too soon---we're at the sixth and final episode---the  Very End, which is billed as a sort of flash back (you know, where they run clips of past episodes) but in fact all of the stuff recalled consists either of out-takes or cuts, or stuff put together specifically for this show,, yet to look as if it happened in previous episodes, so it's not really flash backs in the usual sense.  Nice touch.Still...So it's over.  You'll want to watch these last episodes if you've watched the rest, and you won't be too terribly disappointed, but it is certainly sad to see how far the show fell from the tree that produced it, from the spell casting charm of the early episodes.A Note:  I streamed all of season 5 as I have the others and these are all full episodes.

Such is the case with this fun and reasonably-intelligent series which, though it has plenty of violence and some sexual content, is far from mindless and can actually make you think.In this final season, Mr. Valda, one of the Regents who govern the Warehouse, has returned from oblivion from an alternate timeline. He seeks to take over the Warehouse and move it to a new location where he can exploit the artifacts for profit and power. In the end Valda is foiled, and the season (and series) ends with the Warehouse moving to a new, undisclosed, location.What I found most upsetting about this season of the show is that it was so short - only six episodes as opposed to the roughly 16 we are generally used to. It seems as if the people in charge of SyFy were tired of it and just threw it away! The same thing happened with Eureka which, though not quite as good in my opinion, was still a lot of fun and was really good sci-fi fantasy. At least with Eureka we got a full final season. The problem is that what this is being replaced with is material which I really don't like. I'm not a fan of reality-shows like Ghost Hunters or Ghost Mine (though I find the latter amusing enough to watch when there is absolutely nothing else on) nor do I like a steady diet of reality-competitions like Face-Off or the Jim Henson Creature Competition. And what in heck does wrestling have to do with science fiction ... anyone?Getting back to Warehouse 13 itself, the full series is a rollicking roller-coaster ride through items psychically imbued with the essence of their original owners, where they came from and how to retrieve them. Lewis Caroll's Mirror has the soul of Alice Liddel trapped inside. W.C. Fields' juggling balls cause anyone holding them to act like they were drunk. A katana forged by the discoverer of the principle of folded steel is so sharp it can  bend light and render its wielder invisible. These and many more are the objects which the Warehouse was built to house and protect the world from. The team consists of two Secret Service agents, an FBI agent, a young genius and a psychic all led by a grumpy ex-smuggler. The stories are less about the artifacts and more about the people who have dedicated their lives to finding them and keeping them hidden. There are history lessons and plenty of references to mythology both well-known and obscure. And, for those who enjoyed Eureka, there were two crossover episodes in which a side romace between the characters of Douglas Fargo (Eureka) and Claudia Donovan (Warehouse 13) seemed to promise seeing more of both shows.Finally, Warehouse 13 had many of the same qualities found in Doctor Who which has made that show the longest-running science-fiction television series of all time, as well as the longest scripted television series of any kind. The history they set up of the Warehouse changing hands could have been exploited if it was a cast-change which was necessary (though I don't think anyone was tired of any of the principles). It had the possibility of essentially going anywhere and to any genre, including futuristic space-opera. And the Warehouse itself is a lot like the TARDIS in many ways - a vehicle to the &#34;endless wonder&#34; which Mrs. Fredricks so often uses to sell life as a Warehouse Agent to prospective recruits.All in all, Season 5 is a short and disappointing ending to series which was a lot of fun to watch. And there is nothing remotely similar coming to replace it - with the possible exception of Terry Pratchett's &#34;The Watch&#34; which is years away from airing. There is, however, the hope that someone will eventually pick up the story of the Warehouse with Warehouse 14.As with the other seasons, Season 5 of Warehouse 13 is watchable by most people over the age of 10 or so. As always with my reviews I warn that kids can be very different at that age and those who are fearful might better wait a few years while braver 9-year-olds might eat this up. A good guage is if they like Doctor Who, they'll probably like Warehouse 13.

I really like this show and am sorry to see it go (with only 6 episodes at that).  SYFY is famous for this which is one of the reasons that I dumped cable.  But I digress, for those of you that got season passes for this final season, this may interest you:Amazon.com dropped the ball (again) with these &#8220;extras&#8221; that they are calling &#8220;episodes&#8221; which are only 6 or 7 minutes each.  I would urge you to contact amazon.com to get refunds x 2 ($1.89 each for standard def video).  They will need your order numbers which you can copy down from the emails you would have received when they notified you.  They did this before with other shows that were ending; trying to charge money for the tiniest of short extras that anyone could find online for free.I got a full refund for the two charges because amazon.com didn't mean to charge us for it.  If you really want to pay the $1.89, go for it.  But amazon wasn't supposed to do that.  It happened before, it's happening now, and it will happen again.
