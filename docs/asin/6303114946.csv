357628,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6303114946,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 2]","More than the pressure of winning, real life child chess prodigy, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), must guard himself from adult's expectations for success.  His father Fred (Joe Mantegna) makes most Little League parents look tame in comparison.  As a sportscaster he makes Josh feel ill-at-ease with the dimension and topic of his remarkable talent.  Fred finds Josh a determined but pushy and arrogant chess coach (Ben Kingsley).  One key scene is during a parent-teacher conference.  Josh's teacher is concerned that ""the chess thing"" is overtaking too much of Josh's time and interest.  To this Fred is pointed.  He accuses the teacher of belittling him.  It is ambiguous if the teacher wants normalcy, mediocrity, or sanity for Josh, but what is clear is that Fred will have none of it.  He pulls Josh out of his school and places him in a private school where he can take chess classes.  To the film's credit, we see some balance in the father.  Although he tells the teacher that Josh has an opportunity he never dreamed of having, he does talk to Josh about a friend who will be attending his new school. He also has some genuinely heart-to-heart talks--even if they are tainted with his own ambitions.  All the pressure to win hits the poor boy and the audience, for we can feel his pain.  Yet, there are refuges for Josh as well.  His mother, Bonnie (Joan Allen), genuinely puts his welfare first, and Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) his companion in the park, teaches Josh that his gift is meant to be enjoyed above all else.After seeing this little gem, I couldn't help but think of the more recent movie 'Akeelah and the Bee'.  Both movies have child prodigies, a nerve-racking family life, and Laurence Fishburne in a key performance.  This film is likable for the story and the parallels between Josh the protagonist and his hero, Bobby Fischer, complete with interweaving clips of the famous chess champion.  William Macy gives a great early performance as a nervous competitive parent, trying to play it cool. 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' makes some touching moves.",4,"Forget the King, Guard the Son",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2077,"['More', 'pressure', 'winning', 'real', 'life', 'child', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'Max', 'Pomeranc', 'must', 'guard', 'adult', 'expectations', 'success', 'father', 'Fred', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'most', 'Little', 'League', 'parents', 'look', 'tame', 'comparison', 'sportscaster', 'Josh', 'feel', 'ill-at-ease', 'dimension', 'topic', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'Fred', 'Josh', 'determined', 'pushy', 'arrogant', 'chess', 'coach', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'One', 'key', 'scene', 'parent-teacher', 'conference', 'Josh', 'teacher', 'concerned', 'chess', 'thing', 'overtaking', 'too', 'much', 'Josh', 'time', 'interest', 'Fred', 'pointed', 'teacher', 'belittling', 'ambiguous', 'teacher', 'normalcy', 'mediocrity', 'sanity', 'Josh', 'what', 'clear', 'Fred', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'Josh', 'school', 'places', 'private', 'school', 'where', 'can', 'take', 'chess', 'classes', 'film', 'credit', 'see', 'balance', 'father', 'teacher', 'Josh', 'opportunity', 'never', 'dreamed', 'having', 'talk', 'Josh', 'friend', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'new', 'school', 'also', 'genuinely', 'heart-to-heart', 'talks', 'even', 'are', 'tainted', 'own', 'ambitions', 'pressure', 'win', 'hits', 'poor', 'boy', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'are', 'refuges', 'Josh', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'Bonnie', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'genuinely', 'welfare', 'first', 'Vinnie', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'companion', 'park', 'teaches', 'Josh', 'gift', 'meant', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'else.After', 'seeing', 'little', 'gem', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'more', 'recent', 'movie', 'Bee', 'movies', 'have', 'child', 'prodigies', 'nerve-racking', 'family', 'life', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'key', 'performance', 'film', 'likable', 'story', 'parallels', 'Josh', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'complete', 'interweaving', 'clips', 'famous', 'chess', 'champion', 'William', 'Macy', 'great', 'early', 'performance', 'nervous', 'competitive', 'parent', 'trying', 'play', 'cool', ""'Searching"", 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'touching', 'moves']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

And that's because this film is not really about chess. It's about life. It's about the people who influence us, our fears, our struggles, respect and even compassion towards each other, and trying to decide what really is important in our lives. Knowing a little bit about chess might enhance your pleasure in the film but it also might not: chess is really only the context of the story.This film also has what seems like flawless acting.

357632,A34PCCROYXQM77,6303114946,"B. Breen ""Canuckster1127""","[5, 5]","Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm.Bobby Fischer began to play chess at the age of 7.  His meteoric rise to winning the national Championship in his early teens and then going on to defeat the World, is the Highlight of US Chess History.Chess, like Soccer, is much bigger in the rest of the world than it is in the US.  Fischer caused a blip in the radar screen that elevated Chess in the US.  The Chess community has since then been on the look-out for the next prodigy in hopes of repeating the same event.That's really not the main thrust of the movie, however.  It creates the context in which the relationship between Josh and his Father is explored.  In that regard, the movie is superior and excels.Bobby Fischer represents the megelomaniac for whom Chess is everything to the exclusion of family, friends and relationships.  (That's really a pretty accurate picture of Fischer the man, by the way.)  Josh rejects that path and chooses instead to retain his humanity, and tender conscience, despite the forces battling for him and his future.A Father who is tempted to live vicariously through his son's gift is all too common and present in sports and other areas as well.  A coach, who has his own ghosts and demons and recognizes the potential in Josh, who is unable to release him, for fear that he will leave the path of greatness.  Vinnie, the park speed chess player who represents the joy and fun of chess and rails against the establishment who wants to suck the life out of Josh to be their messiah.It's all there.  The chess provides the back-drop to it all.Many who have shied away from this movie imagining it to be a dull movie about Chess will be pleasantly surprised when they see it.Simply an outstanding film and well worth viewing, even if you don't know a bishop from a pawn!",5,Great Chess Movie but so much more!,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,1915,"['Not', 'really', 'movie', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'rather', 'drive', 'chess', 'community', 'find', 'next', 'prodigy', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'Chess', 'world', 'storm.Bobby', 'Fischer', 'began', 'play', 'chess', 'age', '7', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'winning', 'national', 'Championship', 'early', 'teens', 'then', 'going', 'defeat', 'World', 'Highlight', 'US', 'Chess', 'History.Chess', 'Soccer', 'much', 'bigger', 'rest', 'world', 'US', 'Fischer', 'caused', 'blip', 'radar', 'screen', 'elevated', 'Chess', 'US', 'Chess', 'community', 'then', 'been', 'look-out', 'next', 'prodigy', 'hopes', 'repeating', 'same', 'event.That', 'really', 'not', 'main', 'thrust', 'movie', 'however', 'context', 'relationship', 'Josh', 'Father', 'explored', 'regard', 'movie', 'superior', 'Fischer', 'megelomaniac', 'whom', 'Chess', 'everything', 'exclusion', 'family', 'friends', 'relationships', 'really', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'picture', 'Fischer', 'man', 'way', 'Josh', 'path', 'chooses', 'instead', 'retain', 'humanity', 'tender', 'conscience', 'forces', 'battling', 'future.A', 'Father', 'who', 'tempted', 'live', 'vicariously', 'son', 'gift', 'too', 'common', 'present', 'sports', 'other', 'areas', 'well', 'coach', 'who', 'own', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'potential', 'Josh', 'who', 'unable', 'release', 'fear', 'will', 'leave', 'path', 'greatness', 'Vinnie', 'park', 'speed', 'chess', 'player', 'who', 'joy', 'fun', 'chess', 'rails', 'establishment', 'who', 'suck', 'life', 'Josh', 'be', 'messiah.It', 'there', 'chess', 'back-drop', 'all.Many', 'who', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'movie', 'imagining', 'be', 'dull', 'movie', 'Chess', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'see', 'it.Simply', 'outstanding', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'bishop', 'pawn']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

It has a lot of wonderful points to make about the gifts children have and the way adults have to work to discover them, nurture the child while developing the gifts, teaching the child about using their gifts, but not going too far and not latching onto the child and living through them.The film is at its most touching when Josh struggles and the adults in his life struggle even more to try and find ways to help him.  Finally, the dad (superbly played by Joe Montegna) lets Josh off the hook and takes him fishing.  Josh then returns to competition and can take possession of his gift and competitiveness on his own terms.In real life, Josh Waitzkin has been a superb, but not dominant chess player, but I gather he has led a happy life which should be enough for everyone and is really the point of things, not gathering trophies or empty titles.  Josh learns a bit about the cruelty of real life competition in a painful but not destructive way.Yet, of course, the film has the final crisis against a very threatening opponent.  I am sure you can figure out what happens.  But this final scene isn't really the message of the movie, it is just the ending.Laurence Fishburne has a great role he plays wonderfully.  Joan Allen is great as the loving and intelligent mother who is protective but not over protective.  And Ben Kingsley plays Bruce Pandolfini who is the teacher of Josh.

357641,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,6303114946,"cs211 ""cs211""","[1, 1]","If you are in the mood for a Hollywood feel-good movie, with an appealing protagonist who overcomes adversity and triumphs by ""just being himself"", you can do a lot worse than ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"".  In this case the appealing protagonist is young chess prodigy Joel Waitzkin, well-played by child actor Max Pomeranc. Once Joel demonstrates an unexpected talent for chess, he faces a variety of pressures from adults and other kids and ultimately has to figure out his own path forward.  Many of the adults want him to be the next Bobby Fischer and a world-class chess champion (hence the name of the movie), but the tradeoffs involved in doing so may not be what Joel wants to do.Pomeranc turns in a surprisingly good performance for a child actor, delivering his lines well and portraying Joel's emotions through appropriate facial expressions.  Ben Kingsley's performance as Joel's chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini is the other noteworthy one.  The filmmakers sprinkle in archival footage of the real Bobby Fischer, and provide an interesting look inside the New York City chess scene.  They also convey the emotion and drama of intense chess matches, which can't be too easy to do on the big screen.  All this, coupled with an engrossing storyline and an appropriate ending, combine to make a feel good family movie that is appropriate for pretty much all ages.There are some flaws, but they are generally minor ones.  A few of the scenes, such as the confrontation between Joel's father and Joel's teacher, seem a bit contrived and perhaps over the top.

He manages this by maintaining strong connections to the world outside the rarefied atmosphere of chess addicts who live, eat, and breathe the game at the risk of losing touch with all else.  This balance doesn't come naturally, though.  The primary dramatic tension in this film comes from the question of what one owes to one's own gifts-if you are able to perform at the level of genius, do you have an obligation to do so?  To whom is this obligation owed?  And how much should be sacrificed in its name?  This is a powerful film about decent, intelligent people dealing with these issues and emerging triumphant.

Not only is he enthusiastic, he is a brilliant player that uses combinations that only the most advanced players would dare to try. The best part is Josh is just an everyday kid with a good heart. He has never been schooled in the techniques of the advanced rules of competition that accompany the game. Josh lacks the ""killer instinct"", and he finds himself up against kids whose lives are warped by their obsession for the game.Ben Kingsley plays the chess teacher hired by his dad to coach him in the ways of this competitive world where many of the moves are based on games played by such greats as Bobby Fischer. Laurence Fishburn's role introduces the flip side of the spectrum, a street player who plays for money in Washington Square, and shoots from the hip. Conflict is bound to ensue when oil meets water and it certainly does.Director Steven Zallian, interlaces live footage of Bobby Fischer's genius which Josh narrates, adding an interesting aspect to the possibilities and incredible vigor behind the competition that these kids are up against.

Well, as far as this DVD is concerned I'm nearing the double-digits in viewings.  This is essentially a Family Film with a great cast of actors such as Laurence Fishburn, Joan Allen, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, David Paymer, William H. Macy, and a small role by the then virtually unknown Laura Linney.  After that, there are some fine scenes filled with some excellent child acting.  I happen to think any film with good child acting is worth seeing, they are so rare.  The story is well-written and ranges in emotion from humor to borderline outrage and deep-seeded disappointment.  This film actually reminds me of ""The Color of Money"" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Tom Cruise and Paul Newman.  I got a similar buzz from both films.  After I watch ""The Color of Money"" I feel an unbridled desire to play pool.  After I watch ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" I need to break out my chess board or play on my chess program.  There is even a shot taken directly from ""The Color of Money"" that is used here.  In ""The Color of Money"" there is a great camera shot of a huge room that starts with a shot of the ceiling and gradually pans downward to reveal an empty hall with about twenty pool tables set up for play.  In ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" there is a sweeping camera shot that begins with a dark shot of a hallway ceiling then floats through an archway into a huge, empty hall filled with dozens of chess boards ready for play.  This film did get a single Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, and with shots like those it is easy to see why.  This is a very solid purchase for anyone, chess fans or no.  There are a couple of scenes that bend towards the over-dramatic for the sense of keeping the story thrilling.  Such as the final chess match, which is not what really happened, but it makes for a more entertaining scene.  I know this because the real Josh Waitzkin helped design my chess program Chessmaster 9000 and his championship games are all listed therein.

In fact, it's one of the better movies of the nineties, sadly underrated.It is mostly based on a book by the father of the chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin, which tells the true story of this boy's rise from obscurity to success in the chess world as a junior.  The timing, of course, is crucial: the movie was released in 1993, the year after the brilliant former world champion from the US Bobby Fischer came out of hiding after 20 years.  In 1992 Fischer defied an embargo on Serbia by successfully defeated his old Russian nemesis Boris Spassky in a rematch of the famous cold war world championship, and then again vanishing.  The Fischer-Spassky match was undoubtedly a catalyst for the making of the movie, with the media attention on Fischer's amazing victory and his eccentric disappearance making the time ripe for a chess movie to be palatable for the chess-ignorant masses.But actually ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is not about Bobby Fischer, nor is it first of all about chess.  Bobby Fischer's genius from childhood is the background for a study of the chess-playing genius of seven year old Joshua Waitzkin.  But in truth, the movie focuses more on the relationship between a boy and his father, who moves from the extremes of doubt about his son's talents, then pride and ambition, and finally a desire to develop these talents without hindering a normal childhood.  After hiring a professional chess teacher to tutor Joshua, his father comes to realize the danger of professional chess dominating his son's life.  What the movie portrays about parents of chess-playing children is a stark reality in most sports: it is the parents who are fanatic about their children's sports, and will do everything to make them succeed, placing their children under enormous pressure.  Joshua's father has to learn to rediscover a normal relationship with his son, and to relieve his son of the psychological pressure he has been under.  If only more of today's parents would learn the same lesson.But despite the touching father-son scenes, the conclusion is still a predictable feel-good ending: a win at a high level tournament.  But that doesn't take away from the other aspects of the movie.  In the end, it's an intelligent movie that the whole family can enjoy without a knowledge of chess, but undoubtedly chess buffs will enjoy it the most.  The New York park scenes where druggies and other street people are playing two-minute blitz chess will especially be memorable and satisfying for chess aficionados.  But ultimately this isn't just a movie for chess nuts, it's a movie for everyone.  Aside from just a couple of rare incidents of profanity, it's clean, wholesome and enjoyable.  Which is a lot more than can be said for most movies nowadays.",5,Making chess more interesting than watching paint dry.,1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,2981,"['lot', 'people', 'watching', 'chess', 'more', 'interesting', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'boring', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'chess', 'movie', 'put', 'off', 'making', 'same', 'mistake', 'movie', 'not', 'boring', 'movie', 'fact', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'nineties', 'sadly', 'underrated.It', 'mostly', 'based', 'book', 'father', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'Joshua', 'Waitzkin', 'true', 'story', 'boy', 'rise', 'obscurity', 'success', 'chess', 'world', 'junior', 'timing', 'course', 'crucial', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1993', 'year', 'brilliant', 'former', 'world', 'champion', 'US', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'came', 'hiding', '20', 'years', '1992', 'Fischer', 'defied', 'embargo', 'Serbia', 'successfully', 'defeated', 'old', 'Russian', 'nemesis', 'Boris', 'Spassky', 'rematch', 'famous', 'cold', 'war', 'world', 'championship', 'then', 'again', 'vanishing', 'Fischer-Spassky', 'match', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'catalyst', 'making', 'movie', 'media', 'attention', 'Fischer', 'amazing', 'victory', 'eccentric', 'disappearance', 'making', 'time', 'ripe', 'chess', 'movie', 'be', 'palatable', 'chess-ignorant', 'masses.But', 'actually', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'not', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'first', 'chess', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'genius', 'childhood', 'background', 'study', 'chess-playing', 'genius', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'Joshua', 'Waitzkin', 'truth', 'movie', 'more', 'relationship', 'boy', 'father', 'who', 'extremes', 'doubt', 'son', 'talents', 'then', 'pride', 'ambition', 'finally', 'desire', 'develop', 'talents', 'hindering', 'normal', 'childhood', 'hiring', 'professional', 'chess', 'teacher', 'tutor', 'Joshua', 'father', 'realize', 'danger', 'professional', 'chess', 'dominating', 'son', 'life', 'What', 'movie', 'parents', 'chess-playing', 'children', 'stark', 'reality', 'most', 'sports', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'fanatic', 'children', 'sports', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'make', 'succeed', 'placing', 'children', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'Joshua', 'father', 'learn', 'rediscover', 'normal', 'relationship', 'son', 'relieve', 'son', 'psychological', 'pressure', 'been', 'only', 'more', 'today', 'parents', 'would', 'learn', 'same', 'lesson.But', 'touching', 'father-son', 'scenes', 'conclusion', 'still', 'predictable', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'win', 'high', 'level', 'tournament', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'end', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'knowledge', 'chess', 'undoubtedly', 'chess', 'buffs', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'New', 'York', 'park', 'scenes', 'where', 'druggies', 'other', 'street', 'people', 'are', 'playing', 'two-minute', 'blitz', 'chess', 'will', 'especially', 'be', 'memorable', 'satisfying', 'chess', 'aficionados', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'chess', 'nuts', 'movie', 'everyone', 'Aside', 'just', 'couple', 'rare', 'incidents', 'profanity', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'enjoyable', 'Which', 'lot', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'movies', 'nowadays']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

The cinematography by Conrad Hall in particular is a standout in the film, beautiful and evocative, warm and pure, with beams of sunlight streaming through the corners of the windows and the edges of the frame, enveloping the characters in warm, golden tones. The film looks like your fondest memory of a Folgers' Commercial from the 80s and 90s.""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is an adaptation of the real-life story of chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin, discovering his gift for chess after being captivated watching the hustlers and homeless playing two-minute speed chess in the park. His parents are surprised when Josh exhibits a natural talent for the game. His mother wants to foster his love for chess without compromising his integrity or losing his humanity amid the often cold and calculated chess world. His sportswriter father is blinded by the competitive aspect of chess and his desire for Josh to move up the rankings, win tournaments, and dominate over his peers.Bobby Fischer is propped up as a paradigm of talent and a specter that looms over the film's characters and events. Fischer's legacy frames everyone's perceptions, becoming an important motif as Josh crumbles under the weight of everyone's expectations of him as ""the next Bobby Fischer"" to consistently deliver. The film explores the relationship between parent and child and the ways that adults often set their children up for failure if they fall short of expectations and not preparing them adequately to cope with disappointment. This theme is exceptionally explored through a triumvirate of mentors that pull Josh in opposing directions. Josh's father wants him to be a workhorse, consistently progressing as an athlete. Josh's chess coach, Bruce Pandolfini, tries to sculpt Josh into the perfect, disciplined chess player in the image of Bobby Fischer. Vinnie, one of the hustlers in the park who befriends Josh early on and serves as his first, informal chess tutor, constantly pushes Josh to be bold with his moves, spontaneous, and to disregard convention. What this all coalesces around is the central idea that a child's identity is guided (and misguided) by adults who sometimes let their ambition and misplaced aspirations cloud their judgement. The film makes the case that it is not enough to be an exceptional chess player like Bobby Fischer if you lose your compassion in the process. This is never more necessary to keep in mind than during childhood when it is so easy to psychologically damage a child by drilling into him or her to value only the end results. In a heartbreaking scene in the film, Josh's father reprimands his son in the rain after losing a game in only seven moves, not realizing the emotional gulf that is developing between him and Josh.""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is a coming-of-age film that is affecting without being ersatz, sensitive without being sentimental. It is a wonderfully moving and insightful portrait of a young child trying to find his voice while navigating the difficult and complex relationships with the adults around him. In addition, the film is important viewing for children, giving them much needed perspective that winning is not everything, that their parents' love and approval is not wholly contingent on whether they win or lose, and that compassion is not a sign of weakness but an indication of one's humanity.",5,Seek and You Shall Not Find,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,3507,"['movie', 'can', 'think', 'feeling', 'being', 'child', 'adult', 'world', 'better', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'cinematography', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'particular', 'standout', 'film', 'beautiful', 'evocative', 'warm', 'pure', 'beams', 'sunlight', 'streaming', 'corners', 'windows', 'edges', 'frame', 'enveloping', 'characters', 'warm', 'golden', 'tones', 'film', 'fondest', 'memory', 'Folgers', 'Commercial', '80s', '90s', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'adaptation', 'real-life', 'story', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'Joshua', 'Waitzkin', 'discovering', 'gift', 'chess', 'being', 'captivated', 'watching', 'hustlers', 'homeless', 'playing', 'two-minute', 'speed', 'chess', 'park', 'parents', 'are', 'surprised', 'when', 'Josh', 'natural', 'talent', 'game', 'mother', 'foster', 'love', 'chess', 'compromising', 'integrity', 'losing', 'humanity', 'often', 'cold', 'calculated', 'chess', 'world', 'sportswriter', 'father', 'blinded', 'competitive', 'aspect', 'chess', 'desire', 'Josh', 'move', 'up', 'rankings', 'win', 'tournaments', 'dominate', 'peers.Bobby', 'Fischer', 'propped', 'up', 'paradigm', 'talent', 'specter', 'film', 'characters', 'events', 'Fischer', 'legacy', 'everyone', 'perceptions', 'becoming', 'important', 'motif', 'Josh', 'crumbles', 'weight', 'everyone', 'expectations', 'next', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'consistently', 'deliver', 'film', 'relationship', 'parent', 'child', 'ways', 'adults', 'often', 'set', 'children', 'failure', 'fall', 'short', 'expectations', 'not', 'preparing', 'adequately', 'cope', 'disappointment', 'theme', 'exceptionally', 'explored', 'triumvirate', 'mentors', 'pull', 'Josh', 'opposing', 'directions', 'Josh', 'father', 'be', 'workhorse', 'consistently', 'progressing', 'athlete', 'Josh', 'chess', 'coach', 'Bruce', 'Pandolfini', 'sculpt', 'Josh', 'perfect', 'disciplined', 'chess', 'player', 'image', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'Vinnie', 'one', 'hustlers', 'park', 'who', 'Josh', 'early', 'serves', 'first', 'informal', 'chess', 'tutor', 'constantly', 'Josh', 'be', 'bold', 'moves', 'spontaneous', 'disregard', 'convention', 'What', 'coalesces', 'around', 'central', 'idea', 'child', 'identity', 'guided', 'misguided', 'adults', 'who', 'sometimes', 'let', 'ambition', 'misplaced', 'aspirations', 'cloud', 'judgement', 'film', 'case', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'exceptional', 'chess', 'player', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'lose', 'compassion', 'process', 'never', 'more', 'necessary', 'keep', 'mind', 'childhood', 'when', 'so', 'easy', 'psychologically', 'damage', 'child', 'drilling', 'value', 'only', 'end', 'results', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'film', 'Josh', 'father', 'son', 'rain', 'losing', 'game', 'only', 'seven', 'moves', 'not', 'realizing', 'emotional', 'gulf', 'developing', 'Josh', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'affecting', 'being', 'ersatz', 'sensitive', 'being', 'sentimental', 'wonderfully', 'moving', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'young', 'child', 'trying', 'find', 'voice', 'navigating', 'difficult', 'complex', 'relationships', 'adults', 'addition', 'film', 'important', 'viewing', 'children', 'giving', 'much', 'needed', 'perspective', 'winning', 'not', 'everything', 'parents', 'love', 'approval', 'not', 'wholly', 'contingent', 'win', 'lose', 'compassion', 'not', 'sign', 'weakness', 'indication', 'one', 'humanity']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. ""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film.Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the ""lower class"" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess.We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich.The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid.The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin.""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well!

But as a solid and delightful film, it stands on its own. Young Josh happens on a group of lowdown characters in the park who play chess for drug money.

What happens when a sportswriter, who has just given his son a new baseball glove for his 7th birthday, discovers that his son prefers chess over baseball. He not only prefers it but he is a child prodigy. He could be another Bobby Fischer. Unfortunately, as we see in flashbacks of Fischer's career throughout the film, being a genius and world champion did not necessarily make you a human success story. The question is: are genius and success as a human being mutually exclusive? Can you be a child prodigy and a 'normal' child? The film does a great job of exploring that question as we see the family struggle with first, Josh's gifts, and then, how to best use the incredible talent he has for visualizing the game of chess. As Josh says to one of his opponents during a match, 'It's over. You just don't know it yet."" Genius sees things the rest of us mortals do not. The acting is superb, the cinematography, especially of the chess tournaments, is amazing, and the degree to which the film addresses the question of genius versus having a life is sometimes heartbreaking.

He uses chess as a way to analyze carefully the moves and motivations of himself and others.He is put in a position to care about the game and at the same time make sense of his relationship with his over competitive Father(Joe Mantegna) A particularly avid sports writer, A homeless drug dealer, Vinnie (laurence Fishburne) who plays chess in the local park and a World Renown chess instructor named Bruce Pandolfini(Ben Kingsley).The movie starts out with an introduction about a Grand Master and  U.S. chess champion Bobby Fischer also a former child chess prodigy. He has disappeared and thus the search for him is what drives the motivation of others.Fischer, is the standard by which young Waitzkin is compared and from this reference the rest of the plot unfolds.The acting is tremendous, every actor is used appropriately and each add to the quality of the story. Particularly Max Pomeranc! Child actors are usually not convincing and I mostly avoid movies that revolve around them.As a chess player myself I found this movie to be beautifully well written and focuses on the art of the game and uses plenty of popular chess innuendos and complicated algebraic chess notation in honor of those that love the game. It does not insult those who do not understand the intricacies of the game as well.It accomplishes this by involving you into a story that most of us can identify and relate to. The relationships between a child and adults (who in most cases act more like children than this 7 year old boy.) That premise, is what makes this movie stand on its own two feet with movie audiences and critics alike.Even to this day, it is a warm heartfelt story that the entire family can enjoy.I cannot recommend this movie any higher! For those of you who want to walk away feeling uplifted and truly inspired, this movie has passed the tests of time for 17 years. It's hard for me to imagine that it ever will lose in that strategy, because of its universal subject matter.It will challenge you to put your thoughts and emotions in ""check"" and it successfully keeps them there!",5,"GOOD MOVIE, GOOD GAME.",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2275,"['Plot', 'Details', 'opinion', 'reveals', 'minor', 'details', 'movie', 's', 'plot.Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Joshua', 'Waitzkin', '[', 'Max', 'Pomeranc', 'A', 'Seven', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'chess', 'way', 'analyze', 'carefully', 'moves', 'motivations', 'put', 'position', 'care', 'game', 'same', 'time', 'make', 'sense', 'relationship', 'competitive', 'Father', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'A', 'particularly', 'avid', 'sports', 'writer', 'A', 'homeless', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Vinnie', 'laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'chess', 'local', 'park', 'World', 'Renown', 'chess', 'instructor', 'named', 'Bruce', 'Pandolfini', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', '.The', 'movie', 'out', 'introduction', 'Grand', 'Master', 'U.S.', 'chess', 'champion', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'also', 'former', 'child', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'disappeared', 'thus', 'search', 'what', 'motivation', 'others.Fischer', 'standard', 'young', 'Waitzkin', 'compared', 'reference', 'rest', 'plot', 'unfolds.The', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'actor', 'used', 'appropriately', 'add', 'quality', 'story', 'Particularly', 'Max', 'Pomeranc', 'Child', 'actors', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'convincing', 'mostly', 'avoid', 'movies', 'revolve', 'chess', 'player', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'beautifully', 'well', 'written', 'focuses', 'art', 'game', 'plenty', 'popular', 'chess', 'innuendos', 'complicated', 'algebraic', 'chess', 'notation', 'honor', 'love', 'game', 'not', 'insult', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'intricacies', 'game', 'well.It', 'accomplishes', 'involving', 'story', 'most', 'can', 'identify', 'relate', 'relationships', 'child', 'adults', 'who', 'most', 'cases', 'act', 'more', 'children', '7', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'premise', 'what', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'movie', 'audiences', 'critics', 'alike.Even', 'day', 'warm', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'higher', 'who', 'want', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'uplifted', 'truly', 'inspired', 'movie', 'passed', 'tests', 'time', '17', 'years', 'hard', 'imagine', 'ever', 'will', 'lose', 'strategy', 'universal', 'subject', 'matter.It', 'will', 'challenge', 'put', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'check', 'successfully']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

357698,A2M66S05KKNSWC,6303114946,"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby""","[19, 22]","This film is loosely based on the real story of chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin, who has outranked other junior players by so many points, that he is the first American player since Bobby Fischer who genuinely deserves to be hailed as the &quot;Next Fischer.&quot;Unlike Fischer, however, Waitzkin is a regular kid (or was, he's in his early 20's now), who loves baseball, fishing, other games, like Clue and Monopoly. He also likes playing blitz chess in Washington Square Park with the men, some of them homeless, yet still gifted chess players, who charge tourists for games to make a living, and play one another to prove their prowess.(The Washington Square Park players are real, by the way. Washington Square Park is in Manhattan a few blocks above Greenwich Village. It's a well kept park. Street performers often ply their trade there as well, and you can take your pick of street vended food.)Bobby Fischer single-mindedly pursued chess. He was the son of a single mother, who quite literally spent every moment he could muster working on chess problems. When he could find no one to challenge him, he played himself, and as Max Pomeranc in the film, playing Josh, says &quot;He always won.&quot; Armchair shrinks diagnose Fischer with Antisocial Personality Disorder, Sub-clinical Schizophrenia, Asperger's Syndrome, and a host of other neurological disorders; one of them may be right, but as far as I know, Fischer has never submitted to a D&amp;E.There is nothing wrong with Josh Waitzkin. He loves chess, but not to the exclusion of other pursuits. He loves chess enough to spend most of his time at it, just not all. He loves chess as long as it remains fun. He loves the rush of the daring and audacious blitz chess of the Park. He likes winning trophies at first, but soon the pressure builds, and tournaments become less and less fun, especially after he realizes that the other kids in the tournaments perceive him as the boss at the end of the final level.When one of the greatest chess strategists in the country becomes his teacher, he declares that the Park will corrupt Josh. Exposing him to the rough underbelly of chess will teach him all the wrong things; he must stick to proper chess; walk don't run. Chess loses its headiness, and for Josh, its fun.Chess in the Waitzkin family had become a means to a winning end. But Josh's parents have not stood idly by. Unlike Bobby Fischer's overworked and overtired mother, unwilling, or unable to struggle with her single-minded son, the Waitzkins realize the adults must make a choice. How much time for chess, and how much for baseball? For other academic subjects? For friends who aren't playing chess with him?It is a grand dilemma. A choice of paths, when the road diverges, and no crystal ball. We know what single-mindedness meant for Bobby Fischer: he drew national attention when he represented his country, winning several international titles. Then he embarrassed his country with complaints and insults about other nations' food, plumbing, and lack of bowling alleys. But he may be neurologically deficient. Josh has no deficits. Did chess make Fischer that way, or was his single-minded devotion a result of an existing impairment?&quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; is Fred Waitzkin's way of saying he is searching for his son the balance that Fischer never achieved. It is wondering which is more satisfying, fame or fitting in. It means wondering whether reclusive Bobby Fischer ever felt satisfaction. It is wondering whether having a talent obliges you to use it.The chess games here are splendidly filmed. Although Max Pomeranc is no Josh Waitzkin, he is a ranked chess player. The chess games are choreographed, but because the children really are accomplished players, they understand the moves, and reproduce them convincing. Their facial expressions and other obvious interest in the games sustain the lengthy and very suspenseful game scenes.Sterling performances from all cast members: Ben Kingsley as Bruce Pandolfini is a marvel of restraint. (The real Pandolfini has a cameo, as does Joel Benjamin, and some other champions.) Joe Mantegna as Fred Waitzkin didn't come across as the man who wrote the book Searching for Bobby Fischer, but he fit into the world of the film. After a couple of viewings, I exorcised the narrative voice of the book from my mind, and Mantegna was very much the father of Max Pomeranc's Josh, about whom I can't say enough, so I won't even get started, and just leave it at that.This is a simple movie: no CGI dinosaurs, hovercraft, guns, bullets, or cars exceeding the speed limit; also, no pan shots of countrysides, big houses, boats, people drinking casually out of glasses with stems, and having all kinds of Deep, Scary Secrets.Don't just see it once. I recommend seeing it at least twice (thrice is better).",5,Finding a Good Movie,1007942400,"12 10, 2001",2001,4842,"['film', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'Josh',

357707,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,6303114946,Sean Pasek,"[2, 2]","Coaches, teachers, and parents of kids often make one of two errors in competitive activities:1. They try to convince their kids that winning is the only thing that matters.2. They instill in their kids a great fear of losing.Josh Waitzkin is a young 7-year-old boy who enjoys playing the game of chess.  He's also a very nice, sweet kid who never feels comfortable or even enjoys ""beating"" an opponent.  He simply loves the game.  When he first plays his father in a game of chess, he doesn't try his hardest.  He's afraid of beating and hurting his father's feelings.  This part of the film lays the foundation for the entire rest of the film.  His mother has to tell him, ""it's okay if you beat him.  You won't hurt his feelings.""  Only then does Josh play at his best and wins.Fred Waitzkin (Joe Mantegna) represents the first fear that I listed.  He's an extremely supportive father who is very proud of his son.  ""He's better at this than anything that I will ever do in my whole life,"" he says of Josh.  While his passion and support are strong, he falls into the trap of living vicariously through his son.  Winning is the most important thing to him.  When Josh loses a match to an ""inferior"" opponent, Fred is upset and can't understand why Josh lost.  He doesn't realize that Josh loves his father and only wants to please him.  It isn't until then that Fred realizes his mistake, and he finally encourages Josh to play for fun.On the other side is Josh's chess teacher, Bruce (Ben Kingsley).  He represents the second fear that I listed.  He is afraid of Josh losing.  Bruce is a man who is so scarred by his own losses that happened long ago, that he more or less ""hides out"" in an old chess room.  At first, Fred Waitzkin has to talk him into taking his son as a student.  While Bruce's demeanor is somewhat cold, it's obvious that he truly loves Josh, and can't bear the thought of Josh going through the pain of losing a match.  It isn't until the end that he realizes that Josh is really in no danger of this, even if he did lose.  Josh isn't greatly affected by either winning or losing.  He only likes to play.  But, Bruce tries to tell Josh that he needs to hold his opponents in contempt.  That type of notion simply doesn't exist in Josh.""Bobby Fischer held the whole world in contempt,"" says Bruce.  Josh responds, ""I'm not him.""  Josh already knows who he is, and he isn't trying to be the next Bobby Fischer, no matter how much everyone else wants him to be.  He only wants to be himself.There are two characters in this movie that already know Josh's heart, and they give him the positive values and support that Josh needs.First, his mother (Joan Allen).  She is so enamored by Josh's good heart, that at one point, she threatens her husband.  ""He's not weak. He's decent. And if you or Bruce or anyone else tries to beat that out of him, I swear to God I'll take him away.""Second, is his friend Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a man that Josh meets in Washington Square where Vinnie spends his time playing speed chess with other people who are mostly transients.  Josh quickly makes friends with him, even though Bruce doesn't like it.  But, Vinnie holds the wisdom of competition that Bruce fails to give to Josh.  ""You're playing not to lose, Josh.  You have to risk losing.  You have to play on the edge of defeat.  That's where you want to be!""I can't stress the performance of young Max Pomeranc (Josh Waitzkin) enough.  He seems to know exactly who Josh is, and he plays him with a gentle sweetness that can't be ignored or overlooked.  You see it in his eyes and facial expressions.  He looks at his opponents not as enemies, but simply another kid sitting across from him who could easily be his friend.  Josh has a well-balanced life.  Chess isn't everything to him.  He enjoys doing other things.  Perhaps this is a testament to why his character is so strong.  His opponent at the end, Jonathan Poe, thinks of only chess, and we quickly find that he is a very unhappy and miserable kid.  He's the kind of player that Bruce tries to make Josh, and we are thankful that Josh never goes down that road.Competition is so strong in our culture.  Most parents, teachers, and coaches fall into these two fears without realizing it.  We push and push, we forget that they are children, and that we need to stress the importance of having fun, being a good sportsman, and being gracious in victory and defeat.  It's truly amazing to find that Josh Waitzkin already realized this at the tender age of 7.  Hopefully, we can begin to pass these values on to our own kids.Note* - Look for the real Josh and Vinnie during a scene when the movie Josh and Vinnie are playing chess in the park.  The real Josh Waitzkin and Vinnie are talking just in front of Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna.",5,Should Be Required Viewing For All Teachers & Parents,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,4809,"['Coaches', 'teachers', 'parents', 'kids', 'often', 'make', 'one', 'two', 'errors', 'competitive', 'activities:1', 'try', 'convince', 'kids', 'winning', 'only', 'thing', 'matters.2', 'instill', 'kids', 'great', 'fear', 'losing.Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'young', '7-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'playing', 'game', 'chess', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'sweet', 'kid', 'who', 'never', 'comfortable', 'even', 'beating', 'opponent', 'simply', 'game', 'When', 'first', 'father', 'game', 'chess', ""n't"", 'try', 'hardest', 'afraid', 'beating', 'hurting', 'father', 'feelings', 'part', 'film', 'foundation', 'entire', 'rest', 'film', 'mother', 'tell', 'okay', 'beat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'feelings', 'Only', 'then', 'Josh', 'play', 'best', 'wins.Fred', 'Waitzkin', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'first', 'fear', 'listed', 'extremely', 'supportive', 'father', 'who', 'very', 'proud', 'son', 'better', 'anything', 'will', 'ever', 'do', 'whole', 'life', 'Josh', 'passion', 'support', 'are', 'strong', 'trap', 'living', 'vicariously', 'son', 'Winning', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'When', 'Josh', 'match', 'inferior', 'opponent', 'Fred', 'upset', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Josh', 'lost', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Josh', 'father', 'only', 'please', ""n't"", 'then', 'Fred', 'mistake', 'finally', 'Josh', 'play', 'fun.On', 'other', 'side', 'Josh', 'chess', 'teacher', 'Bruce', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'second', 'fear', 'listed', 'afraid', 'Josh', 'losing', 'Bruce', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'scarred', 'own', 'losses', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'more', 'less', 'out', 'old', 'chess', 'room', 'first', 'Fred', 'Waitzkin', 'talk', 'taking', 'son', 'student', 'Bruce', 'demeanor', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'obvious', 'Josh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'thought', 'Josh', 'going', 'pain', 'losing', 'match', ""n't"", 'end', 'Josh', 'really', 'danger', 'even', 'did', 'lose', 'Josh', ""n't"", 'greatly', 'affected', 'winning', 'losing', 'only', 'play', 'Bruce', 'tell', 'Josh', 'hold', 'opponents', 'contempt', 'type', 'notion', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Josh', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'held', 'whole', 'world', 'contempt', 'Bruce', 'Josh', ""'m"", 'not', 'Josh', 'already', 'who', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'next', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'only', 'be', 'are', 'two', 'characters', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'Josh', 'heart', 'give', 'positive', 'values', 'support', 'Josh', 'needs.First', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'so', 'enamored', 'Josh', 'good', 'heart', 'one', 'point', 'husband', 'not', 'weak', 'decent', 'Bruce', 'anyone', 'else', 'tries', 'beat', 'swear', 'God', ""'ll"", 'take', 'away', 'Second', 'friend', 'Vinnie', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'man', 'Josh', 'meets', 'Washington', 'Square', 'where', 'Vinnie', 'time', 'playing', 'speed', 'chess', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'transients', 'Josh', 'quickly', 'friends', 'even', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'like', 'Vinnie', 'wisdom', 'competition', 'Bruce', 'give', 'Josh', ""'re"", 'playing', 'not', 'lose', 'Josh', 'have', 'risk', 'losing', 'have', 'play', 'edge', 'defeat', 'where', 'want', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'performance', 'young', 'Max', 'Pomeranc', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'enough', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'Josh', 'gentle', 'sweetness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'overlooked', 'see', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'opponents', 'not', 'enemies', 'simply', 'kid', 'sitting', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'friend', 'Josh', 'well-balanced', 'life', 'Chess', ""n't"", 'everything', 'doing', 'other', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'testament', 'why', 'character', 'so', 'strong', 'opponent', 'end', 'Jonathan', 'Poe', 'only', 'chess', 'quickly', 'find', 'very', 'unhappy', 'miserable', 'kid', 'kind', 'player', 'Bruce', 'make', 'Josh', 'are', 'thankful', 'Josh', 'never', 'down', 'road.Competition', 'so', 'strong', 'culture', 'Most', 'parents', 'teachers', 'coaches', 'fall', 'two', 'fears', 'realizing', 'push', 'push', 'forget', 'are', 'children', 'need', 'stress', 'importance', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'good', 'sportsman', 'being', 'gracious', 'victory', 'defeat', 'truly', 'amazing', 'find', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'already', 'realized', 'tender', 'age', '7', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'begin', 'pass', 'values', 'own', 'kids.Note*', 'Look', 'real', 'Josh', 'Vinnie', 'scene', 'when', 'movie', 'Josh', 'Vinnie', 'are', 'playing', 'chess', 'park', 'real', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'Vinnie', 'are', 'talking', 'just', 'front', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Joe', 'Mantegna']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS
357708,A2RDR5G65D9H84,6303114946,Sebastian Fernandez,"[3, 4]","This movie tells the story of Josh Waitzkin and it is based on the book with the same title written by his father. If you have read the book, you will certainly notice that the adaptation for the movie was flexible and does not really follow he facts, but it sure does make the story more exciting.The film starts at the time after Bobby Fischer withdrew from the international chess scene and went into seclusion. After winning his title, Fischer had many disagreements with FIDE (International Chess Federation) and  did not show up to defend his title against Karpov. As a result, he lost the title and left a huge crowd of fans, that had taken up chess after and American defeated the seemingly invincible Soviets, without a hero to carry their flag.In this setting we find small Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), who picks up chess from watching people playing in the park and soon shows his innate ability for the game. His parents soon find themselves in unfamiliar territory and have trouble coping with the requirements and stress even young chess players face. In an effort to help their son cultivate his gift, they contact Bruce Pandolfini, one of the most recognized chess coaches in the US (if you go to a bookstore and look for chess books you will see several written by him).This is when the search for Bobby Fischer within this child begins, and the journey could not be better. Kingsley, Mantegna and Pomeranc are all very good in their roles and give their characters with the right amount of emotion and passion. But if I had to pick a performance, it would be the one by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a character that will remain imprinted in the memory of all those that watch this movie.The fact that Pandolfini is presented in a slightly negative light, compared to reality and the modification of the end of the story do not really detract from the overall quality of the production. If you love chess, this movie is a must, but even if you do not, I bet you will really enjoy it.",5,"""Then your job is harder""",1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2002,"['movie', 'story', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'father', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'certainly', 'notice', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'was', 'flexible', 'not', 'really', 'follow', 'sure', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'exciting.The', 'film', 'starts', 'time', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'withdrew', 'international', 'chess', 'scene', 'went', 'seclusion', 'winning', 'title', 'Fischer', 'had', 'many', 'disagreements', 'FIDE', 'International', 'Chess', 'Federation', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'defend', 'title', 'Karpov', 'result', 'lost', 'title', 'left', 'huge', 'crowd', 'fans', 'had', 'taken', 'up', 'chess', 'American', 'defeated', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'Soviets', 'hero', 'carry', 'flag.In', 'setting', 'find', 'small', 'Josh', 'Waitzkin', 'Max', 'Pomeranc', 'who', 'up', 'chess', 'watching', 'people', 'playing', 'park', 'soon', 'innate', 'ability', 'game', 'parents', 'soon', 'find', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'have', 'trouble', 'coping', 'requirements', 'stress', 'even', 'young', 'chess', 'players', 'face', 'effort', 'help', 'son', 'cultivate', 'gift', 'contact', 'Bruce', 'Pandolfini', 'one', 'most', 'recognized', 'chess', 'coaches', 'US', 'go', 'bookstore', 'look', 'chess', 'books', 'will', 'see', 'several', 'written', '.This', 'when', 'search', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'child', 'journey', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'Kingsley', 'Mantegna', 'Pomeranc', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'give', 'characters', 'right', 'amount', 'emotion', 'passion', 'had', 'pick', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'character', 'will', 'remain', 'imprinted', 'memory', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'fact', 'Pandolfini', 'presented', 'slightly', 'negative', 'light', 'compared', 'reality', 'modification', 'end', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'detract', 'overall', 'quality', 'production', 'love', 'chess', 'movie', 'must', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'bet', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy']",Searching for Bobby Fischer VHS

The focus is less on the game itself (although it sure helps you appreciate matters more) and more on the people, their sentiments, the pressures they bring to bear.
