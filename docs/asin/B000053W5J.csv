Commentator,"[5, 6]","When I first encountered Ultraviolet I was afraid it was going to be another shoot-em-up vampire-killer flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the vampire premise was just an excuse to pump some blood into the dead genre of the Cold War drama. I couldn't help but notice parallels between UV and the great BBC Cold War epics like Jean LeCarre's 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Smiley's People' (ESPECIALLY the bridge scene at the end).You probably will not like Ultraviolet if you are not a fan of sci-fi, horror or British programming.  Some viewers may find the episodes involving pedophilia and abortion to be in poor taste.Interesting plot, great score, good (British) acting",5,The Vampire Who Came In From The Cold,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,692,"['When', 'first', 'encountered', 'Ultraviolet', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'shoot-em-up', 'vampire-killer', 'flick', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'vampire', 'premise', 'was', 'just', 'excuse', 'pump', 'blood', 'dead', 'genre', 'Cold', 'War', 'drama', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'parallels', 'UV', 'great', 'BBC', 'Cold', 'War', 'epics', 'Jean', 'LeCarre', ""'Tinker"", 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', ""'Smiley"", 'People', 'bridge', 'scene', 'end', '.You', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'Ultraviolet', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'British', 'programming', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'episodes', 'involving', 'pedophilia', 'abortion', 'be', 'poor', 'taste.Interesting', 'plot', 'great', 'score', 'good', 'British', 'acting']",N/A

Fangs, wooden stakes,garlic cloves,crucifixes are not the centerpiece of the weapons used against the &quot;leeches&quot;, as one character calls them.{Though all are employed,ingeniously}. The vampires present themselves as a persecuted minority, trying to live in harmony, hunted by the church and its associates. The hunters are a hemotologist, a Gulf war veteran, a London Cop and a priest,all of whom have their reasons{which unfurl brillaintly}. Only the priest never loses sight of what is at stake, for the eternal life offered is rather seductive.The story is multilayered,with political, financial, enviornmental, racial and religious overtones. The ultimate question is are they looking for peaceful co-existence{by creating synthetic blood} or is there something more sinister. This series succeeds on so many levels. The four leads{Jack davenport,Susannah Harker, Idris Elba and Philip Quast} are absolutely on target,each inhabiting their character to the degree that by the 6th episode{two discs], you feel something for these folks. Much of the violence is implied, with very few of the blody scenes usually accompanying this genre.Channel 4 has lived up to its usual brillaint standards. This is cool,creepy and very ,very good.

Ultraviolet is a miniseries which follows the well meaning English cop Michael. Right before Michael's best friend and partner, Jack is to marry his long time friend Krisy he disappears. Michael suspect that Jack's disappearance is not due to cold feet over the wedding, a suspicion which is strengthened when a strange group of people start poking around. This group turns out to be a surviving branch of the inquisition who dedicate itself to hunting vampires. reluctantly Michael agree to work with the vampire hunters to find out about the sinister plot which claimed Jack and which threaten all of humanity.Ultraviolet plays a little like X-Files, this group of vampire hunters are a government agency, they are formal and professional. At the same time the series deals well with emotional issues, all from the grief of having to kill a family member who is now a vampire to how to deal with serious illness. Ultraviolet have six episodes and there is an overarching plot which spends the entire series. One thing I can complain about is that while the story is generally very good the ending is a bit rushed, I think that had the series been eight instead of six episodes it would have been even better. That being said the storylines in Ultraviolet is solid and I have personally seen this series several times and I never seam to tire of it.The vampires in Ultraviolet is done in an interesting way, they are both very traditional but are made new and fresh by a very scientific focus. Perhaps the most striking quality of the Ultraviolet vampires is that they are immortal, completely and utterly. Yes when they are for example staked they turn to dust (and not in the Buffy way, they explode, violently, one of the characters actually use a vampire death to blast his way out of a locked room in one scene.) however that dust can be reanimated so not only do the hunters need to kill the vampires, they need to keep their ashes safe as well.The actors of Ultraviolet do a very good job and the characters they portray is multi faceted and interesting. The visuals are striking and considering that the series was made in 1998 the special effects are nice. The music of Ultraviolet is both fitting and fetching, all in all Ultraviolet scores high all over when it comes to it's technical quality.I warmly recommend Ultraviolet, if you like vampire stories, horror stories or just mystery and crime stories then this is a good choice. The series is well written, dark and different. The series should have been a few episodes longer but other than that I have no complaints and all I can say is that Ultraviolet is a very, very good TV series.",5,Amazing but to short English vampire show,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2744,"['was', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'bought', 'DVD', 'so', 'loved', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'Ultraviolet', 'miniseries', 'well', 'meaning', 'English', 'cop', 'Michael', 'Right', 'Michael', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'Jack', 'marry', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'Krisy', 'Michael', 'suspect', 'Jack', 'disappearance', 'not', 'due', 'cold', 'feet', 'wedding', 'suspicion', 'strengthened', 'when', 'strange', 'group', 'people', 'start', 'poking', 'around', 'group', 'out', 'be', 'surviving', 'branch', 'inquisition', 'who', 'dedicate', 'hunting', 'vampires', 'reluctantly', 'Michael', 'agree', 'work', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'find', 'out', 'sinister', 'plot', 'claimed', 'Jack', 'threaten', 'humanity.Ultraviolet', 'little', 'X-Files', 'group', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'are', 'government', 'agency', 'are', 'formal', 'professional', 'same', 'time', 'series', 'deals', 'well', 'emotional', 'issues', 'grief', 'having', 'kill', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'now', 'vampire', 'how', 'deal', 'serious', 'illness', 'Ultraviolet', 'have', 'six', 'episodes', 'overarching', 'plot', 'entire', 'series', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'complain', 'about', 'story', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'bit', 'rushed', 'think', 'had', 'series', 'been', 'eight', 'instead', 'six', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'being', 'said', 'storylines', 'Ultraviolet', 'solid', 'have', 'personally', 'seen', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'never', 'seam', 'tire', 'it.The', 'vampires', 'Ultraviolet', 'done', 'interesting', 'way', 'are', 'very', 'traditional', 'are', 'made', 'new', 'fresh', 'very', 'scientific', 'focus', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'striking', 'quality', 'Ultraviolet', 'vampires', 'are', 'immortal', 'completely', 'utterly', 'Yes', 'when', 'are', 'example', 'staked', 'turn', 'dust', 'not', 'Buffy', 'way', 'explode', 'violently', 'one', 'characters', 'actually', 'use', 'vampire', 'death', 'blast', 'way', 'locked', 'room', 'one', 'scene', 'however', 'dust', 'can', 'be', 'reanimated', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'hunters', 'need', 'kill', 'vampires', 'need', 'keep', 'ashes', 'safe', 'well.The', 'actors', 'Ultraviolet', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'characters', 'portray', 'multi', 'faceted', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'are', 'striking', 'considering', 'series', 'was', 'made', '1998', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nice', 'music', 'Ultraviolet', 'fitting', 'fetching', 'Ultraviolet', 'scores', 'high', 'when', 'technical', 'quality.I', 'warmly', 'recommend', 'Ultraviolet', 'like', 'vampire', 'stories', 'horror', 'stories', 'just', 'mystery', 'crime', 'stories', 'then', 'good', 'choice', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'dark', 'different', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'episodes', 'longer', 'other', 'have', 'complaints', 'can', 'say', 'Ultraviolet', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'TV', 'series']",N/A

I never really got into the X-Files, finding their concept compelling but the story lines a little repetitive.  Further, I dislike horror fiction and Ann Rice's take on vampires.  With all that said, you might wonder why I liked this.  The answer is simple: A great story.I like the concept of a vampire underground, organized and thoughtful, a sinister threat, not just a blood thirsty killing machine.  The characters are brilliant and the tension between them is spectacular.  The plots incorporate interesting ideas, updated for the modern era:  Vampires cannot be seen in mirrors, so today that also means, they can't be seen on cameras.  The greatest little suggestion in the series is that vampires often seek people in their 30's to convince to join them.  Why?  Because they realize their youth is slipping away and don't want to get older.  Brilliant.

I can see what drew some of the rave reactions, but the series did leave me rather unsatisfied.  The basic premise of the series, the central pin of the mystery of the Code V (as the vampires are called) depended on... a gimmick.  A never-explained gimmick, which made a gaping flaw in a series that was taking a more scientific approach to vampires.(This is a very common stumbling block in stories where the creator wants to steer away from the mysticism of the vampire legends.  To date, IMO, no-one's really succeeded at that.)The good:The score.  Moody, bluesy, and never overpowers the action on-screen.The actors:  the central cast (with one exception) all had good chemistry together, and it was a treat to see a show where the 'buddy element' wasn't hammered into the viewer's head.  These aren't 'best buds.'  They're not drones or fanatics.  They're people who've been through terrible things, pitting their intelligence and skills against an enemy who's way ahead of them.The plots: Hoo, boy.  Ultraviolet tackles some pretty controversial topics.  Great change from the usual fare.The bad:There isn't much in the way of resolution.  So much is left hanging.The gimmick:  These vampires can't be seen by machines--no recordings, photos, etc.  Vampirism is a type of virus.  Yet it's never explained just how a virus manages to make one's clothes invisible to machines, or voices unable to be captured on audio equipment.  Or why the 'active ingredient in garlic' has an unspecified effect, or why one needs special ammo to shoot one.In short, the 'new' mode of vampire looks surface-cool, but it doesn't hold up under a closer look.  If you can set that aside, you'll enjoy UV.  There's almost nothing in the way of extras on the two-disc set, so if you can't suspend disbelief, don't shell out for what will become very expensive drink coasters.",3,"Enjoyable, but with significant flaws.",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,1968,"[""'d"", 'been', 'hearing', 'people', 'rave', 'series', 'ages', 'so', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'snapped', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'drew', 'rave', 'reactions', 'series', 'did', 'leave', 'rather', 'unsatisfied', 'basic', 'premise', 'series', 'central', 'pin', 'mystery', 'Code', 'V', 'vampires', 'are', 'called', 'depended', 'gimmick', 'never-explained', 'gimmick', 'made', 'gaping', 'flaw', 'series', 'was', 'taking', 'more', 'scientific', 'approach', 'vampires', 'very', 'common', 'stumbling', 'block', 'stories', 'where', 'creator', 'steer', 'away', 'mysticism', 'vampire', 'date', 'IMO', 'no-one', 'really', 'succeeded', 'good', 'score', 'Moody', 'bluesy', 'never', 'action', 'on-screen.The', 'actors', 'central', 'cast', 'one', 'exception', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'show', 'where', ""'buddy"", 'element', 'was', ""n't"", 'hammered', 'viewer', 'head', 'are', ""n't"", ""'best"", 'buds', ""'re"", 'not', 'drones', 'fanatics', ""'re"", 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'terrible', 'things', 'pitting', 'intelligence', 'skills', 'enemy', 'who', 'way', 'ahead', 'them.The', 'plots', 'Hoo', 'boy', 'Ultraviolet', 'pretty', 'controversial', 'topics', 'Great', 'change', 'usual', 'fare.The', 'bad', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'resolution', 'So', 'much', 'left', 'hanging.The', 'gimmick', 'vampires', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'machines', 'recordings', 'photos', 'etc', 'Vampirism', 'type', 'virus', 'never', 'explained', 'just', 'how', 'virus', 'make', 'one', 'clothes', 'invisible', 'machines', 'voices', 'unable', 'be', 'captured', 'audio', 'equipment', 'why', ""'active"", 'ingredient', 'garlic', 'unspecified', 'effect', 'why', 'one', 'special', 'ammo', 'shoot', 'one.In', 'short', ""'new"", 'mode', 'vampire', 'surface-cool', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'closer', 'look', 'can', 'set', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'UV', 'almost', 'nothing', 'way', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'do', ""n't"", 'shell', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'very', 'expensive', 'drink', 'coasters']",N/A

The premise is a very well done update of the idea of vamps, with quite a bit more thought and careful craft put into it than many full-scale hollywood productions. I wish they'd make more. It asks questions about morality, and doesn't answer them, and like in real life motivation can only be determined by actions; but also like in life, all actions can have more than one explanation.I also love the people they picked as actors.

We are treated, finally, to a phantasmagoria that does not insult our intelligence but makes harsh demands on our perceptive capacities and our capacity for sensitivity and sophistication.  It rewards us, in turn, with something that stirs up the unsettled debris at the bottom of our souls and ignites our cognitive powers at white hot intensity.""Ultraviolet"" is not for children and it is doubly not for children masquerading as adults.  It plays games with the mind that remind me of the superior gamesmanship of Patrick McGoohan's sublime series ""The Prisoner"".  A covert agency working in the British government and allied with forces in the Catholic Church is dedicated to hunting down and destroying vampires but the strange plots it uncovers show that the vampires are not mere street thugs or the charismatic pseudo-erotic devil-deities we behold in so much fiction or film today.  The vampires are Up To Something and the brief glimpses we get of that Something convey a preternatural chill that will disturb both our hearts and minds.Gone are the raving lunatics and dope-fiend-like cariactures we've come to expect.  The vampires, when we encounter them, are truly bearers of something uncanny and alien, worthy of the best forays into the diabolic sublime in high european art.  They are handled with a marvellous degree of understatement that quietly emphasizes their non-human nature.  We are left doubting, through most of the series, who the real bad guys are.  Is the humanity the vampires seek to convey real or is a mask over something so non-human that cosmic dread can be the only response?""Ultraviolet"" is a profoundly mature and maturing work of art.  There are two sides to every story and Joe Ahearne, the creator and director, manages to find at least three until all sides resolve in a terrifying climax where all the philosophical and psychological reveries in the series are crowned with existential thunder.Good and evil are fierecely opposed in this work but we must pass through a thousand ambiguities and confusions until we come to the end.A great and stimulating work of art.

The series was the brainchild of Joe Ahearne, who wrote and directed all the episodes (the exhaustion brought about by which, and C4's request he do the same for the second season, is apparently the key reason why it never happened). Ahearne had formally worked on the acclaimed BBC-2 series This Life and more recently has directed several episodes of the new Doctor Who.Ultraviolet is a modern take on the vampire myth. As it was airing at the same time as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the writer clearly wanted to take a different approach (borrowing a fair bit from The X-Files as well). Ultraviolet is more realistic than Buffy, delving more into science of how vampires might work and showing in some cases greater fidelity to the myth (for example, vampires do not appear on camera as mirrors are part of the camera's focusing mechanism, whilst in Buffy they do) and taking it to new levels: these vampires cannot appear in any form of electronic recording, and cannot use phones either. Also, to avoid certain connotations of the word they never once use the term 'vampire' in the whole series, instead using the phrase 'Code 5' (which is rendered as 'Code V') or the nickname 'leech'. Ultraviolet does have a wry sense of humour, however, especially in the use of carbon bullets and ultraviolet-emitting detection gear (which replicates the effects of sunlight) to replicate more traditional vampire-killing weapons.The story follows Detective Sergeant Michael Colefield of the London Metropolitan Police Force (played by Jack Davenport, better-known these days for his turn as Captain/Commodore Norrington in the Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy). When his best friend and fellow policeman vanishes without a trace on the eve of his wedding, Colefield discovers his friend was leading a shady double-life that was being investigated by a organisation that the government refuses to acknowledge exists. This organisation is soon, almost reluctantly, forced to recruit Colefield into their ranks once he uncovers evidence of the existence of the 'leeches'. He is integrated into a team led by Father Pearse Harman (the Catholic Church co-funds the war against the leeches alongside national governments; played by Philip Quast), Dr. Angela March (Susannah Harker) and Vaughn Rice (Idris Elba, best-known for his role as Stringer Bell in The Wire), but intriguingly he doesn't fully trust his new team-members and they remain wary of him until quite late in the series. This is mostly because Colefield has a hopeless crush on his friend's jilted fiancee, Kirsty and continues to have contact with her, which the rest of the team suspects is a weakness the leeches will employ against him. However, when it is discovered that Harman has cancer, the leeches also find that they have a temptation they can use against him...Even though there was supposed to be a sequel, as a mini-series Ultraviolet works extremely well, with events starting at one point and coming full circle as the series proceeds. The notion of science versus faith is explored intelligently in the series: crucifixes and other symbols of faith are treated as placebos and only have an impact on those vampires who themselves are superstitious. The vampires themselves employ technology for their own ends, able to drive around with with use of UV-resistant glass and use vocoders to make phone calls, whilst the longer-lived specimens are able to manipulate the stock market over decades to make immense fortunes. The central theme of the series is also compelling: the vampires and those opposed to them have endured an uneasy truce over the centuries because the vampires want to protect their food supply and enjoy being the elite; they have no wish to turn the whole human race into vampires, for example. The truce is now over because humanity is getting perilously close to the point where it will destroy itself, and the vampires need to save us from ourselves...but whilst this may sound great the suggestion is that their preferred mode of existence for 'normals' is in immense battery farms. At the same time, the world governments are scared of going public for fear of causing a panic and the creation of a state of intolerance, surveillence and fear. As one character says, they walk the line between living on a Bernard Matthews farm or in Iran-writ-large. These themes, even more timely now than when the show was first transmitted, are explored intelligently and in-depth.This is a great series and no mistake, well-written, excellently acted (Davenport's finest hour by far; Quast is just fantastic as the multi-layered Harman) with moments of moral doubt, character drama and occasional moments of bad-ass action (Vaughn gets two of the most spectacular vampire kills in screen history), whilst the revelation of the vampire's final plan for humanity in the last episode is spine-chilling.Criticisms? Frankly, no, not really. When the episode aired with the paedophile case I was a bit bemused and pondered if the show was just trying to be 'edgy' for the sake of it. However, it ended with an absolutely monumental and somewhat disturbing twist that was just brilliant and exceedingly logical given the parameters of the show. Of course, the biggest criticism is that we never got a second season, but that may be for the best. The conclusion to the series would seem to make any further continuation of the story a bit too black-and-white, whilst it's the moral ambiguity of the two sides that makes Ultraviolet so interesting.Ultraviolet (*****) is absolutely recommended as being probably the finest exploration and use of the vampire in modern fiction I have come across.",5,Still the finest vampire TV series

Being a horror maniac, I found UV tepid and drawn-out. I soon forgot about it. In the meantime, I got addicted to british cop shows (Prime Suspect, Frost, Rebus, etc.), and returned to UV last week. Well, I actually paid attention this time and watched, amazed at what I seem to have missed the first time around! Watching all of those dark police procedurals certainly helped, especially in mood and atmosphere. ULTRAVIOLET is a smart, bleak series about two warring factions (humans and leeches) trying to gain species supremacy. Filled w/ social commentary, UV twists the vampire story into a tale of survival and desperation. The characters are intelligent and strong, the pacing is perfect, and the storyline never falters. Jack Davenport (Pirates Of The Carribean 1-3) is quite believable as Michael, the latest recruit in the war. Susannah Harker (is that a great name or what?!) is fantastic in a Scully sort of way. Idris Elba plays his tough, ex-military role with a stern ease. The leeches (or Code Vs) themselves are mostly unseen, adding to the mystery and tension. This isn't a hollywood production. There are only a few explosions, absolutely no karate-vampire fights, and not one black leather  outfit. Nope, this one requires a bit more than just a heartbeat from its audience.

However, as a rule of thumb, it was too good to last in the UK. An X-Files-look-alike about Vampires where the word Vampire is never mentioned and yet you never miss it?... that's GREAT writting, because the story is so compelling, and the characters so richly developed (in many ways, they had more development in one season than Mulder and Scully in years) that you end every episode with a provocative thought or question that leads you promptly to the next chapter. However, the series was not supported by the network (no suprises there) and got cancelled. The final chapter, well... it's bittersweet at best, because leaves you with many questions. But then again, that's what good television does, after all.The DVD's are bare-bones-basic. But the image and sound quality is as good as it gets. My advise here would be: buy it and watch it slowly.

They are secretive, incredibly well-funded and intimately involved in medical science and they supposedly ""only take those who want to cross over.""  Although the doctor/detective begs to differ.

I consider myself a relatively 'in the know' genre fan, and I had never even heard of this miniseries until I happened across it on the shelves at the local DVD store.  Impressive packaging.  Interesting premise.  It sounded like a winner ... but at what cost?  I read the other reviews on Amazon and from some related boards that I could find, and I was only learning great things.  Finally, for Xmas, I gave in, and let me tell you I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I was blown away.  ULTRAVIOLET is a six-episode miniseries (hint: it's left open enough for a follow-up, should the creative folk wish to do so) that did something very few miniseries do: it makes you think.

Perhaps it is a pity that we don't get to learn more about the hierarchy and organisation of the vampires other than some hints. This is strongly suggested by their organised and coordinated efforts, and willingness to act on their own initiative to pursue common goals.In other words, these were intelligent vampires who are able to transcend their individual needs for their greater good. Which is an interesting idea but which raises my skepticism. Like I said, maybe it would have helped if there were more explanation, but as the story is told from the perspective of the humans, there is no premise for that to happen within 6 episodes.As for the execution of the story, I thought the acting was not very credible.

He is miscast and mumbles all the way through this episode making a convoluted story even harder to follow, let alone swallow.Episode two:Eerie bit at the end ruined by a silly gas explosion. The music is great and sticks to you like glue. The ghost of Robert Vaughn stalks this 'government department' to risible effect. What, no Illya?Episode three:Couldn't follow the financial plot of the last one? Here Jack is joined by a whole bunch of mumbling people. The director is at fault here. Naturalism is just style if we can't hear the dialogue. Very plodding episode. A tree catches fire in a brief but doomed attempt to liven things up.Episode Four:Director Ahearne didn't want to do the usual cops and robbers, so why is the series so like 'Prime Suspect'? Taking the element of dread away from Vampires is counter-productive. Child abuse is tastlessly exploited yet again. More sci-fi mumbo jumbo. I've got a thing for Kirsty, though. How could the vampires resist her the whole series?Episode Five:This is what gets the three stars. A bona fide TV classic. The coffins. The old ticking bomb routine. The way the music builds up. Cracking performance from the guy who plays Vaughn (he stole the series from under Davenport). Great ending with cracked mirror. Corny stuff, but it works. But a long time coming. Why didn't the Guard disarm Vaughn when he clobbered him? If Vaughn had a gun, why was he worried? Anyway, he could have flipped the coffins on their back, or put one on top of the other, then he would have had only two to kill. A subtle 'love' scene with Harker (hired for her surname?) Is another highlight.Episode six:The juggling of naturalism with sci-fi tosh always threatened to collapse the series like a pack of cards and in the end it does. When the head honcho starts rambling on about nuclear winter and world domination you expect that Sgt Major from Monty Python to show up saying: &quot;Now, stop. This was a nice little show about vampires but now it's getting very silly.&quot; Ahearne realises this with the line: &quot;What's this, visiting hours?&quot; The bit where a vamp tells Kirsty to get a life and jumps into the Thames could be directed at us for watching this twaddle. It was fun but I'm too old. Young people may love it and the money is probably worth it.

Right off the bat it was very obvious that Ultraviolet is a British production - rather than beating you over the head in the first 15 mins, they give you credit for having a brain and piece things together in a way that really draws you in. The film/series runs 6 hours and the writer/director Joe Ahearne really understands how to set a pace to keep you engaged while moving the story along.Ultraviolet takes a wonderfully fresh and inventive approach towards vampires. I genuinely enjoyed the infusion of technology in relation to vampires -  If vampires don't have any reflection, how can they talk over a phone?  I also really liked the philosophical approach it took to the subject of vampires: Are vampires really bad? Should they be killed because they are who they are?In the early years of the X-Files I was certainly a fan, but the show really lost me over the years, after watching Ultraviolet I realized why. Rather than hyping up some big conspiracy and never doing anything about it, Ultraviolet creates a complex world where everything isn't black and white but there are very specific 'rules'. Rather than myopically focusing on the world it creates Ultraviolet concentrates on really telling complete stories about the people in that world.Ultraviolet was well acted, well directed and thoroughly enjoyable.

I was somewhat pleased.The premise is rather simple. Vampires (referred to primarily as ""leeches"" in the series) exist and have existed, governments have countered this threat with secret agencies designed to fight it. These agencies only recruit people that may have already been affected by the leeches. The series primarily follows one man, as he is brought into that world because of a friend.It is an original way of dealing with the vampire fiction. Over several episodes, you rarely see the vampires, and mainly deal with the fallout from their actions. You almost never see the same vampire in multiple episodes.Throughout the mini-series clues are dropped, and the mystery is not resolved until the final part of the final episode. Still, even at the conclusion, there remains a conflict.

566191,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B000053W5J,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","A quick opening statement: if I could give 3.5 stars for this one, I would.This show must have looked very, very strange to its original audience. As it is, this series still feels a bit alien and outlandish 15 years later (at the time of this review). ""Buffy"" fans might be jarred by this one because this show is deathly serious. In fact, never mind serious, it's approaching being noir.There is little banter, there are precious few moments spent on idle witticisms, and its purpose isn't to cheer people up. While the characters are distinctly complicated, the show has a uniquely cold feeling (perhaps it's all an intricate metaphor or a mirror to the undead nature of vampires?). That being said, the writing actually has some very high points. It's not a ""bloodbath"" show. Yes, it has moments of ""yuck"" and cringing and general visual grimness (more so at the beginning), but it's hardly gore material; it's entirely too smart for that. This isn't campy. It's a workable drama that happens to have vampire/sci-fi tendencies. The characterizations are excellent and were planned very methodically, so there aren't really any moments in which the storyline becomes laughable because it goes too far (unlike many other shows).Philip Quast is very noteworthy in this one, and the show simply wouldn't have worked without his character (or his face) in it. He rapidly becomes endearing and is a warmly welcome presence by the last episode, immediately a born leader and a father figure. His attention to detail becomes more and more layered with each successive episode, and it's really something to behold. The rest of the cast is generally enjoyable, but I think it's Quast who cements it all together.So why do I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Personal tastes, nothing else. I'm not entrenched in horror shows and perhaps I would understand this show better if I had the stomach for other similar fare (I appreciate the high caliber of writing/scripting in this series, but can't see myself watching it multiple times in a month). Again, the show has a rather ""cold"" and sobering feeling that you will either like or you won't. It might just be the conspiracy elements generating some of this vibe (which is a shame because this show doesn't quite stand on its own feet without the conspiracy bits).The big trick with ""Ultraviolet"" is that it doesn't wrap up neatly by the ending. The ending is acceptably viable (if not mildly cliched), but it feels like there was a second season (or a follow-up series?) partially in the works and was subsequently shelved. There's a hint of these 6 episodes being a bit ""out in the cold,"" as it were. What we might have here is a genuine case of a *miniseries* rather than a more traditional TV show format. It flows fine from one episode to the next, but the progression it makes in the course of one episode is startlingly dense (which is to say that film buffs averse to TV shows might love it and ""junk food"" TV show consumers will hate it and think the pacing is positively glacial).It's not flashy - and it certainly looks dated now in some ways - but it's really not bad if you appreciate complex writing and even more complex characters.",3,"Quite different - a little unsentimental, but very good drama",1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,3191,"['quick', 'opening', 'statement', 'could', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'one', 'would.This', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'very', 'very', 'strange', 'original', 'audience', 'series', 'still', 'bit', 'alien', 'outlandish', '15', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'review', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'jarred', 'one', 'show', 'deathly', 'serious', 'fact', 'never', 'mind', 'serious', 'approaching', 'being', 'noir.There', 'little', 'banter', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'moments', 'spent', 'idle', 'witticisms', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'cheer', 'people', 'up', 'characters', 'are', 'distinctly', 'complicated', 'show', 'uniquely', 'cold', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'intricate', 'metaphor', 'mirror', 'undead', 'nature', 'vampires', 'being', 'said', 'writing', 'actually', 'very', 'high', 'points', 'not', 'bloodbath', 'show', 'Yes', 'moments', 'yuck', 'cringing', 'general', 'visual', 'grimness', 'more', 'so', 'beginning', 'hardly', 'gore', 'material', 'entirely', 'too', 'smart', ""n't"", 'campy', 'workable', 'drama', 'have', 'vampire/sci-fi', 'tendencies', 'characterizations', 'are', 'excellent', 'were', 'planned', 'very', 'methodically', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'moments', 'storyline', 'laughable', 'too', 'far', 'many', 'other', 'shows', '.Philip', 'Quast', 'very', 'noteworthy', 'one', 'show', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'character', 'face', 'rapidly', 'endearing', 'warmly', 'welcome', 'presence', 'last', 'episode', 'immediately', 'born', 'leader', 'father', 'figure', 'attention', 'detail', 'becomes', 'more', 'more', 'layered', 'successive', 'episode', 'really', 'something', 'behold', 'rest', 'cast', 'generally', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'Quast', 'who', 'together.So', 'why', 'do', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '4', '5', 'Personal', 'tastes', 'nothing', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'entrenched', 'horror', 'shows', 'perhaps', 'would', 'understand', 'show', 'better', 'had', 'stomach', 'other', 'similar', 'fare', 'appreciate', 'high', 'caliber', 'writing/scripting', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'multiple', 'times', 'month', 'Again', 'show', 'rather', 'cold', 'sobering', 'feeling', 'will', 'either', 'wo', ""n't"", 'might', 'just', 'be', 'conspiracy', 'generating', 'vibe', 'shame', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stand', 'own', 'feet', 'conspiracy', 'bits', '.The', 'big', 'trick', 'Ultraviolet', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'up', 'neatly', 'ending', 'ending', 'acceptably', 'viable', 'not', 'mildly', 'cliched', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'follow-up', 'series', 'partially', 'works', 'was', 'subsequently', 'shelved', 'hint', '6', 'episodes', 'being', 'bit', 'cold', 'were', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'here', 'genuine', 'case', '*miniseries*', 'rather', 'more', 'traditional', 'TV', 'show', 'format', 'fine', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'progression', 'course', 'one', 'episode', 'startlingly', 'dense', 'say', 'film', 'buffs', 'averse', 'TV', 'shows', 'might', 'love', 'junk', 'food', 'TV', 'show', 'consumers', 'will', 'hate', 'think', 'pacing', 'positively', 'glacial', '.It', 'not', 'flashy', 'certainly', 'dated', 'now', 'ways', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'appreciate', 'complex', 'writing', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'characters']",N/A

The idea of likening vampires to multiple minorities is brilliant - the gay, the HIV+, the ill, the deaf, the disabled - because it keeps the protagonists morally ambiguous. Is what they're doing right? That's for you to decide. The whole thing is terribly scary, more so because it's rationalised by science. My biggest complaint is that the bloody thing ends just as it's getting more interesting than ever before!The characters are mostly well-drawn, headed by Jack Davenport (""Coupling,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") although I found the female characters rather lacking. Susannah Harker's character is every bitchy, cold scientist with a past that I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I think it's quite a mistake to have put her on the front cover as a sort of Scully to Jack Davenport's Mulder; they're barely seen together in the show! My personal favorite character was Philip Quast's fallen, tortured priest, the leader of the team. I ultimately wanted to know a lot more about him than the others.Of course, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't perfect - a few plot revelations are completely telegraphed, and the show changes its stance on some of the finer details of the vampire legend more than once - but it's still very good. In fact, I don't understand at all why they could only make six episodes out of it. Unlike most miniseries, there's easily enough unanswered questions to make a full British season of 13 episodes, or maybe even two.The DVD's quite good quality - the video looks quite crisp to me and the occasional bright colors (especially the blue of the labs) are very clear. I was also quite pleased by the 5.1 mix (which I believe the R2 release does not have?) - not usually the sort of thing I notice, but for a British series, the music is astonishingly full and pleasant. In fact, it sometimes overpowers the dialogue, especially in episodes one and two - and made me distinctly wish for a subtitle track. The text extras are a bit lacking (and hard to find - they're accessed via the ""V"" chapter selection of each episode, and then the ""Code V Area"" button), but the two-part audio interview with writer/director Joe Ahearne is very good.

566206,A10Q9341H2LYX0,B000053W5J,Shan Wickremesinghe,"[12, 14]","This is an outstanding 6 part series. It does deal with vampires as is clearly apparent from the excellent opening credits but the entire concept has been updated to a fully scientific and modern basis on both sides of the conflict. Treatment of the story in this fashion as well as the quality of the acting talent attracted helped the audience to take a show about vampires seriously and attracted a large audience in the UK when it first screened as a result. It bares little resemblance to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (though more so to the main theme of Season 4 of BTVS, when the US government finally takes an interest in the increasingly bizarre things that go on in Sunnydale) but I enjoy both that show and this one for different reasons, don't compare the two as each has different merits. At the time of writing this review, this is supported by the fact that the people who buy these tapes are still buying the Buffy (also an excellent show but a different style of show) boxed video sets in the UK even a year or more after this set was released there.Episode 1: Habeus Corpus is the best episode.After an informant turns up dead and his partner Jack (Stephen Moyer) goes missing the night before his wedding, Michael (Jack Davenport) starts investigating his disappearance. This leads to the startling discovery that vampires exist and a secret government organisation is battling them in a shadow war that the public is (mercifully) unaware of. Unwittingly, he finds himself drawn into the conflict as both sides try to use him to gain an advantage over the other side. After an intriguing opening that draws you in, some thrilling action follows and a very explosive finish.Episode 2: In Nomine PatrisThis episode further demonstrates that the battle between the government and the undead is fully grounded in the present day as the team investigates a financial operation that has come to their attention quite by chance and leads to the discovery of some of the plans of their enemy to fight them, both financially and scientifically. Michael also has to deal with the persistent enquiries of his partner's fianc&eacute; about his disappearance. She won't accept the explanation of the police, another theme that runs through the course of the series and fits well with Michael's personal conflicts over what he now knows about what is going on. Both sides are utilising the latest in available technology and not a crucifix in sight. A suitably explosive climax that even outdoes the one in the first episode.Episode 3: Sub JudiceA solicitor is saved by an unseen assailant who murders both her attackers. Given the nature of the event and the complete lack of video evidence despite extensive security cameras, the squad is called in. Not a bad episode by any means, in fact it has what is probably the most dramatic and emotional scene in the entire series. The main problem is that it has nothing to do with the overall 'big picture' of the show, which is the ongoing battle between the two sides. In fact, you could actually skip from the end of episode 2 to the start of 5 and not even noticeEpisode 4: Mea CulpaA stabbing in a school ultimately leads to a discovery of a weapon being developed by the vampires to control the populace. Unfortunately, it takes most of the episode to get to this point and most of the episode is mired in investigating child abuse. The weakest in the series and even though a little more relevant that the previous episode on the ongoing theme, you could also miss it and not notice.Episode 5: Terra IncognitaAfter episodes 3 and 4 lost some intensity and drifted off the main theme to varying degrees, the show is back to its brilliant best with this episode. After a man who has arrived from Brazil is found to have a mysterious bleeding disorder, it leads to the discovery of further experimentation and some mysterious containers in the plane's cargo. The best scene in the whole show has one of the team trapped in a warehouse and facing seemingly imminent death. For steadily mounting tension, drama and emotion, you cannot do much better than this episode.Episode 6: Persona Non GrataRevelations unfold about what the vampires' ultimate goals are. Things finally come to head as both sides converge on Michael, as he may be the key for both sides to achieve victory. Not surprisingly, he is under a lot of pressure from both sides due to his conflicting beliefs and loyalties that are unavoidably in direct opposition. The conclusion is very dramatic and answers a lot of the questions asked but still leaves things open for another series. Unfortunately, to date there has been no news about that so far, though a pilot for an American version of the show has been made with an airdate yet to be determined. With the airwaves currently cluttered with vaguely similar themes (though mostly involving the supernatural in some fashion), it probably means there may not be room for a full blown series of Ultraviolet in any form in the US at this time. As more time passes since this series first screened, a British follow up to this excellent UK series also seems less likely.Overall, this has been the best show on television for a long time. Using a measured approach and skillful writing so typical of the best British thrillers, they have taken a theme and made it something you will take just as seriously as any other police drama or thriller. The casting has been excellent, with the involvement of such well known veteran talents as Susannah Harker and the Australian actor Philip Quast, a good performance from Idris Elba as well as up and coming actor Jack Davenport.It is a show that you cannot afford to miss.",5,An excellent series and a must see.,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,5681,"['outstanding', '6', 'part', 'series', 'deal',

566209,A1HH53MJ15KATM,B000053W5J,"William M. Klepper ""BK""","[4, 8]","First of all, the people of Great Britan are wasted on this great show.  I mean, with a tv show this great, you'd think the responce would have the studio screaming for a second and third season.  I can understand the director/writer not wanting to do a second season in GB, but ... Hey people, step up, hand the ball off to someone who can run with it. If you can't find one locally, bring one over from one of your colonies (the one located to our North would be a good choise).This was VERY well done for a Brit show.  I mean, the last horror story that had any teeth in it was the ""28 days"" thingy. (And, hey, I kept thinking THAT had something to do with the mense's all the way to the end.  Shoulda picked a different number.)Story-line is better than fine; its Gr-rr-rate.  The Music is fine.  FX is fine.  Unknown actors that can really act fine.  Directed fine.  In fact, everything was fine enough for it to have gotten a Globe if it were done in U.S.  I read of rummors of it being picked up to be done for the U.S. market - Fox, I think.  Then I catch the name being used for some SCIFI ""Kill Bill"" knock off. Go figure.Anyway, the DVD stands on its own; every episode up to high standards to keep you wanting to see the next one, even with an excellent to superior plot twist at the end.  It's just such a good plot line, its disappointing it didn't have a least 2 more seasons, that's all.  I mean, it's kinda like listening half-way through an Alan Parsons album.Would I recommend getting this DVD?  Absolutly.  Am I still pissed about them not doing another season?  Yeah, but that's tempered a little after watching the DVD a few times.  And, that plot twist...
