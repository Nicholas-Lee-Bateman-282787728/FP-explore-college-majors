236910,AWA88F5TOX8VL,6300270572,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[1, 2]","[RAGE - 1972 - Widescreen - 100 Min. - Directed by George C. Scott] While one of my favorite actors, this film fails on multiple levels even though it had all the earmarks of its time - mistrust of both the government and military, conspiracy theories, a fear of martial law, hospital cover-ups, concealed enviornmental pollutants, etc., etc.Even Scott's talents seem to miss the mark here, as he fails to convey the deep sense of loss he's undergone and again falters while attempting to elicit the rage the film is centered upon. I hate to admit it, but even the direction is amiss and lacks the whallop George C. is known for.There's adequate pacing between the time he and his son are admitted to the hospital and the moment he plans his revenge against those who have lied to him, killed his son and livestock, tainted his land and left him terminally ill, but there's no knock-out punch delivered, no vindication evident, no taste of vengeance savored before Scott himself collapses and fails to complete his final act. The entire effort becomes an act of coitus interruptus, leaving me with a severe case of 'blue balls' the likes of which I've never experienced from a George C. Scott flick.There was a failure to establish an emotional bond with his son prior to the incident which caused all the dominos to fall, which I believe to be Scott's fault, as he's never been a warm and fuzzy guy to begin with (but in later roles like 'Hardcore' and 'The Changeling' he had expanded his emotional palatte to elicit such emotions), there was only a weak attempt to see him harden enough to plan his retribution, and he then lacked the execution of the film's title - and this AFTER 'Patton'? Where's the 'Rage'? I'm at a loss here to explain these events.Again, Scott's one of my favorite actors, and I had just seen him in 'The Hospital' and 'They Might Be Giants' around the same time and thought he was brilliant in both, but maybe the directorial duties took him away from his strengths in this flick. Regardless, I only think this film warrants 3 stars. Save your 'Rage' for my remarks here, watch this one closely, and maybe you'll agree.",3,A Pedestrian Effort From A Great Actor..,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,2147,"['[', 'RAGE', '1972', 'Widescreen', '100', 'Min', 'Directed', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', ']', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'film', 'multiple', 'levels', 'even', 'had', 'earmarks', 'time', 'mistrust', 'government', 'military', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'fear', 'martial', 'law', 'hospital', 'cover-ups', 'concealed', 'enviornmental', 'pollutants', 'etc.', 'etc.Even', 'Scott', 'talents', 'seem', 'miss', 'mark', 'here', 'convey', 'deep', 'sense', 'loss', 'undergone', 'again', 'falters', 'attempting', 'elicit', 'rage', 'film', 'centered', 'hate', 'admit', 'even', 'direction', 'amiss', 'whallop', 'George', 'C.', 'known', 'adequate', 'pacing', 'time', 'son', 'are', 'admitted', 'hospital', 'moment', 'revenge', 'who', 'have', 'lied', 'killed', 'son', 'livestock', 'tainted', 'land', 'left', 'terminally', 'ill', 'knock-out', 'punch', 'delivered', 'vindication', 'evident', 'taste', 'vengeance', 'savored', 'Scott', 'complete', 'final', 'act', 'entire', 'effort', 'act', 'coitus', 'interruptus', 'leaving', 'severe', 'case', ""'blue"", 'balls', 'likes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'flick.There', 'was', 'failure', 'establish', 'emotional', 'bond', 'son', 'prior', 'incident', 'caused', 'dominos', 'fall', 'believe', 'be', 'Scott', 'fault', 'never', 'been', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'guy', 'begin', 'later', 'roles', ""'The"", 'Changeling', 'had', 'expanded', 'emotional', 'palatte', 'elicit', 'such', 'emotions', 'was', 'only', 'weak', 'attempt', 'see', 'harden', 'enough', 'plan', 'retribution', 'then', 'lacked', 'execution', 'film', 'title', 'AFTER', ""'Patton"", 'Where', ""'Rage"", ""'m"", 'loss', 'here', 'explain', 'events.Again', 'Scott', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'had', 'just', 'seen', ""'The"", 'Hospital', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'same', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'maybe', 'directorial', 'duties', 'took', 'away', 'strengths', 'flick', 'Regardless', 'only', 'think', 'film', 'warrants', '3', 'stars', 'Save', ""'Rage"", 'remarks', 'here', 'watch', 'one', 'closely', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'agree']",N/A

I thought it was pretty cool watching George C. Scott go ballistic against the military that were trying to cover up what they had done with a deadly gas. Kind of like the biological weapon movies ""Outbreak"" with Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman or ""Chill Factor"" with Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.. Why hasn't it been remade? Some say it couldn't be done today. Why not? Gee we don't experiament with deadly biological weapons anymore? Umm sure we don't. In a pigs eye we don't. At any rate I will be glad to see some of Scott's works that aren't on DVD yet come out like this one and, ""Flim Flam Man"", ""The List of Adrian Messenger"", and ""They Might Be Giants"". He was truly a consumate actor and it is ashame these aren't on DVD yet.

But, in our movie, George C. Scott (who also directed) and his son were effected. Then is becomes the story of Scott looking for revenge before, he himself, dies.I was the Location Manager on this film and we shot in and around Tucson, Arizona. Also, we used Benson (about 45 miles away) for Rollings, Wyoming. Of course, the Army would not help so I had to create an Army base half way between Tucson and Phoenix. It was an area where they worked on airplanes and was easy to fix up.We also had a facade built half way between Tucson and Benson for the building we blew up.You will enjoy this movie because there is lots of action and family ties.Jack Young",3,Rage,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,790,"['beginning', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'US', 'plane', 'dropped', 'chemicals', 'herd', 'sheep', 'Wyoming', 'killed', 'movie', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'son', 'were', 'effected', 'Then', 'story', 'Scott', 'looking', 'revenge', 'before', 'dies.I', 'was', 'Location', 'Manager', 'film', 'shot', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'Also', 'used', 'Benson', '45', 'miles', 'away', 'Rollings', 'Wyoming', 'course', 'Army', 'would', 'not', 'help', 'so', 'had', 'create', 'Army', 'base', 'half', 'way', 'Tucson', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'area', 'where', 'worked', 'airplanes', 'was', 'easy', 'fix', 'up.We', 'also', 'had', 'facade', 'built', 'half', 'way', 'Tucson', 'Benson', 'building', 'blew', 'up.You', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'family', 'ties.Jack', 'Young']",N/A

The first violent encounter seems abrupt and jarring.  But.  The reasons for the transformation are convincing and the set-up is, unlike most modern movies, at least logical.  The rage thus engendered is portrayed with convincing implacability.  In most of his performances, George C. Scott has more than a touch of rage just under the surface; in this film, he lets it out.  The primary flaw, as I see it, is that although the plot line itself is more or less plausible, somehow the supporting actor roles are not convincing, and that I would guess is due more to Scott's directing debut than the actors themselves.  Nonetheless, it is a muted but powerful portrayal of a father's searing rage and the look on Scott's face as he scorches down the road on a motorcycle is one that is hard to forget.

The recent film &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;, while blessed with excellent special effects, turned out to be a real &#34;puker&#34; because of that garbage - half the film was about some stupid 3-way &#34;love affair&#34; between two guys and a gal separated by the beginning of WWII. THIS film, however, was just the opposite - it's a wonderful movie, even for one that dates back to the very early '70's, I believe. George C. Scott as the lead actor and film's producer was superb, as is the vast majority of his films usually are. While certainly not in the same genre' as &#34;Patton&#34;, nevertheless, it's excels because of it's simplicity - in fact, what strikes me about this film, as opposed to 99% of the garbage that Hollywood puts out, is the fact that had this film's scenario occurred for real back in those days, it likely would've turned out very much like the movie - art imitating real life! That is the key to this film's attraction: It's a relatively simple story about a rancher, his young son, along with a civilian and military bureaucracy that has it's own agenda and is willing to lie to anyone to cover up it's mistakes, no matter how those lies might hurt anyone in the process.
