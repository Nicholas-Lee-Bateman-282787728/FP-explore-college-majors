579931,A1T9YSDAYS097M,B00005B1ZM,D. Bannister,"[5, 5]","Playtime by Jacques Tati is a remarkable movie. It is a comedy and sweet commentary on the perseverance of man even when immersed in a city of steel and glass. For this last Hulot movie, Tati leaves the Paris of the Seine and places us in the 1960 emerging Paris of modern towers and thick transparent doors. In Playtime we not only follow Hulot, but a number of characters within this maze of stunning industrial architecture.While predominately thought of as a comedy, Tati in Playtime attempts to answer larger questions than a fumbling Hulot is able to muddle through alone.  Through each character we see into and around the impersonal technology that revolutionized our lives and environment. Playtime doesn't ask why this happened, but it does ask how can we live in this cold cacophony where our ideals become only reflections in a door.One supposes that the answers have something to do with the young photographer trying desperately to take the picture of a flower vendor absurdly juxtaposed outside a stark gray office tower while remarking, &quot;this is Paris&quot;. Or maybe it exists within the dilemma of choosing a prepared meal under a bright neon sign which makes all the food ghostly green. On the surface we see the humour and below we feel the exquisite simplicity of Tati's whimsically rigorous proof of life.Playtime is a gift of sight and sound that should not be missed. It is medicine of the most wonderful taste and a vicarious curative for any person in these modern times.",5,A Startling Movie of Life and Joy,994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,1502,"['Playtime', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'commentary', 'perseverance', 'man', 'even', 'when', 'immersed', 'city', 'steel', 'glass', 'last', 'Hulot', 'movie', 'Tati', 'Paris', 'Seine', 'places', '1960', 'emerging', 'Paris', 'modern', 'towers', 'thick', 'transparent', 'doors', 'Playtime', 'not', 'only', 'follow', 'Hulot', 'number', 'characters', 'maze', 'stunning', 'industrial', 'architecture.While', 'predominately', 'thought', 'comedy', 'Tati', 'Playtime', 'attempts', 'answer', 'larger', 'questions', 'fumbling', 'Hulot', 'able', 'muddle', 'alone', 'character', 'see', 'impersonal', 'technology', 'revolutionized', 'lives', 'environment', 'Playtime', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'happened', 'ask', 'how', 'can', 'live', 'cold', 'cacophony', 'where', 'ideals', 'become', 'only', 'reflections', 'door.One', 'answers', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'young', 'photographer', 'trying', 'desperately', 'take', 'picture', 'flower', 'vendor', 'absurdly', 'juxtaposed', 'stark', 'gray', 'office', 'tower', 'remarking', 'quot', 'Paris', 'quot', 'maybe', 'dilemma', 'choosing', 'prepared', 'meal', 'bright', 'neon', 'sign', 'food', 'ghostly', 'green', 'surface', 'see', 'humour', 'feel', 'exquisite', 'simplicity', 'Tati', 'whimsically', 'rigorous', 'proof', 'life.Playtime', 'gift', 'sight', 'sound', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'medicine', 'most', 'wonderful', 'taste', 'vicarious', 'curative', 'person', 'modern', 'times']",Playtime

Probably the closest would be his last appearance as Monsieur Hulot, in Traffic.  In Playtime, Hulot's 3rd appearance, it's just Tati wandering around a mechanized Paris, running into hinderances along the way.  This a a charming comedy, and not a laugh out loud one.  It does have it's funny moments, and you really need a second or even third viewing to appreciate all that is appearing on screen.  I love just popping this one in, and letting it play while I am doing things around the house.  With it not having a plot, you can jump in at any time, and catch glimpses of it here and there without missing much.  It's probably the only movie of it's kind you can do that with.This film literally emptied Tati's pocket's getting it made with the costly sets and hundreds of extras.  However, he pressed on and got it completed, much to the film going world's benefit.  It's a pleasant trip down a the lane of a film maker's mind we will probably never come close to gazing into again.  There just aren't any films around like this anymore, as the days of sight gags, and silent comedians are long over.  Hopefully it will get re-issued soon, either by Criterion or another company.  It deserves to be in print, and the UK apparently doesn't have any licensing issues, as it's in current release over there.As far as the debate over the aspect ratio is concerned, I do know this:  I had a Toshiba DVD player at one time, which had a unique feature of zooming out, as well as zooming in.  When I zoomed out, it made the film look even wider screen, but the important factor was, that it showed me a few millimeters more on either side, which I couldn't see on my other TV and DVD player.  In a film like this, which is full of long shots, and lots of people and things happening in every corner, it was a benefit to have that feature.  That was of course, until that DVD player of mine broke.  So there is actually more on the transfer, it's just that with every TV and DVD player cutting off a tiny bit on the sides, you lose a little something.  I wanted to see this film when it ran on the big screen for a limited time about 2 years ago, but it only hit select cities and didn't come near me.  Seeing it in the theater must be a huge treat!One tip if you are searching out the Criterion out of print version is to make sure you ask who you are buying it from, whether it says first printing or second printing in small print on the lower back of the case.  You want the second printing.  The DVD is rare to find either way, but the second printing is much, much rarer, as you either had to trade your first printing into Criterion to get the corrected version, or find it in the stores, if they even stocked the second one prior to it going out of print.  The difference is the first version had an incorrect aspect ration on the Terry Gilliam interview and the Tati short film.  They both appeared squished into widescreen format, when they should have been full screen.",5,"The best of it's kind ... but, wait, there is no other of it's kind!

579933,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005B1ZM,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[6, 7]","Jacques Tatischeff changed his name to Jacques Tati in the 1920's when he worked in the French Music Halls. In the early 1950's, he began to develop a character that would ultimately become his alter-ego-Mr. Hulot. Tati sculpted Hulot from the toes up-an umbrella carrying, pipe smoking raincoat-clad funny hat-wearing Everyman in argyle socks. As he moved he defied gravity-almost off balance as he lurched about-yet graceful as a dancer.PLAYTIME was the third in the Hulot series. He bankrupted himself shooting it in 70mm on a stretch of land he had to lease-constructing a whole city set-which came to be called Tativille. He wanted the polished chrome and glass look for all the buildings-and could not find them consistently in the real Paris. Tati took great artistic chances. Dialogue was incidental-almost feeling improvised. He shot it in all medium shots, mostly without specific dialogue-as a tip of the hat to Buster Keaton and silent films.  The zany action had to carry the plot-similar to the recent French Anime-THE TRIPLETS OF BELLVILLE (2003).He postulated that the future would be a place of shiny surfaces and deadly conformity-just huge towers of ticky-tacky that would all look the same. He suggested that modern society is trying to delete or destroy all the vestiges and symbols of the past. In this film, one only sees the landmarks in Paris as reflections in great glass windows. The complex and long Royal Nightclub Scene became a masterwork of mayhem-choreographed precisely. We were bombarded with multiple sight gags that all happened rapidly-even simultaneously. Tati paved the way for directors Richard Lester and Robert Altman to handle crowd scenes effectively-brimming with overlapping action and humorous asides.It took some energy to watch this film carefully. It could require multiple viewings to totally appreciate all that occurred within the frame. Tati completely reinvented comedy within silence-and made us love it. His routines ranged from broad slapstick to subtle bits of business with props and people. He taught us that there is a plethora of unintended humor surrounding us-if we would only pay attention to it-and take the trouble to allow ourselves to be touched and tickled by it.",4,City of Mirth,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2235,"['Jacques', 'Tatischeff', 'changed', 'name', 'Jacques', 'Tati', '1920', 'when', 'worked', 'French', 'Music', 'Halls', 'early', '1950', 'began', 'develop', 'character', 'would', 'ultimately', 'become', 'alter-ego-Mr.', 'Hulot', 'Tati', 'sculpted', 'Hulot', 'toes', 'up-an', 'umbrella', 'carrying', 'pipe', 'smoking', 'raincoat-clad', 'funny', 'hat-wearing', 'Everyman', 'argyle', 'socks', 'moved', 'defied', 'gravity-almost', 'off', 'balance', 'lurched', 'about-yet', 'graceful', 'dancer.PLAYTIME', 'was', 'third', 'Hulot', 'series', 'bankrupted', 'shooting', '70mm', 'stretch', 'land', 'had', 'lease-constructing', 'whole', 'city', 'set-which', 'came', 'be', 'called', 'Tativille', 'wanted', 'polished', 'chrome', 'glass', 'look', 'buildings-and', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'consistently', 'real', 'Paris', 'Tati', 'took', 'great', 'artistic', 'chances', 'Dialogue', 'was', 'incidental-almost', 'feeling', 'improvised', 'shot', 'medium', 'shots', 'mostly', 'specific', 'dialogue-as', 'tip', 'hat', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'silent', 'films', 'zany', 'action', 'had', 'carry', 'plot-similar', 'recent', 'French', 'Anime-THE', 'TRIPLETS', 'OF', 'BELLVILLE', '2003', '.He', 'postulated', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'place', 'shiny', 'surfaces', 'deadly', 'conformity-just', 'huge', 'towers', 'ticky-tacky', 'would', 'look', 'same', 'suggested', 'modern', 'society', 'trying', 'delete', 'destroy', 'vestiges', 'symbols', 'past', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'landmarks', 'Paris', 'reflections', 'great', 'glass', 'windows', 'complex', 'long', 'Royal', 'Nightclub', 'Scene', 'became', 'masterwork', 'mayhem-choreographed', 'precisely', 'were', 'bombarded', 'multiple', 'sight', 'gags', 'happened', 'rapidly-even', 'simultaneously', 'Tati', 'paved', 'way', 'directors', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'handle', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'effectively-brimming', 'overlapping', 'action', 'humorous', 'asides.It', 'took', 'energy', 'watch', 'film', 'carefully', 'could', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'totally', 'appreciate', 'occurred', 'frame', 'Tati', 'completely', 'reinvented', 'comedy', 'silence-and', 'made', 'love', 'routines', 'ranged', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'subtle', 'bits', 'business', 'props', 'people', 'taught', 'plethora', 'unintended', 'humor', 'surrounding', 'us-if', 'would', 'only', 'pay', 'attention', 'it-and', 'take', 'trouble', 'allow', 'be', 'touched', 'tickled']",Playtime

579935,A106016KSI0YQ,B00005B1ZM,Jay Dickson,"[5, 6]","Tati spent years working on this, the summa of all his comedic direction. PLAYTIME is a study of a day and night in an unrecognizable Paris, where modernist architecture have all but obliterated the city everyone remembers. Tati's point is that this is what urban life has done to Western civilization worldwide (indeed, in the film we frequently see travel posters advertising foreign cities where the same ugly concrete skyscraper appears, blocking out the views of more distinctive landmarks behind it.) But Tati's genius is that he doesn't linger on nostalgia: no matter what has been lost, Tati's characters must move forward and make do with what they've been given. This point is gorgeously made in the film when, fleetingly, the cupolas of Sacre Coeur and the spire of the Eiffel Tower are seen as reflections in glassed doorways. As we see these reflected images, the characters in the film look back at these pre-contemporary landmarks, softly sigh, and then move forward with the modernist Paris they have been given to work in and with.But the pleasure of PLAYTIME is that this modernist Paris may be ugly but it's all a kind of glass-and-cement playground for adults: everything in Tati's Paris is breaking down and is hopelessly confusing, but this is a source of tremendous fun for the viewer--and ultimately, for the film's participants. The story follows Tati's French Everyman, the endearingly clumsy Monsieur Hulot, as his path takes him in and out of a group of American tourists (their dialogue, written by Art Buchwald, becomes most memorable when they visit a technology fair: ""Ooh, and it's so pratical!"" one of them intones, as she watches a model demonstrate new eyeglasses with lift-up lenses for doing one's eyeshadow.) Although Hulot's confusion with modernity inevitably brings chaos in his wake, just about everyone adores him, and by the end of the film he's memorably charmed the prettiest of the tourists. Also by the film's brilliant ending the triumph of this sense of postmodern ""play"" is firmly in place: everytime I see this film I choke up at the end (and can't explain why) when the traffic circle becomes brilliantly transformed (by Tati's brilliant editing and choreography) into a kind of funfair. There's something very moving in seeing that, finally, that Tati reaffirms this landscape of modernity as a space for fun and play, rather than for alienation and disintegration.I was very lucky to have first seen this film in the Eighties on a widescreen, at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. It's just about impossible to see this film this way anymore, and it's a great shame: the widescreen ratio was employed to full use by Tati, and there's often something going on on both sides of the screen that the current DVD format can't pick up. But this is small potatoes: this film is a masterpiece, and deserves to be seen in any format.",5,Tati's masterpiece,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,2885,"['Tati', 'spent', 'years', 'working', 'summa', 'comedic', 'direction', 'PLAYTIME', 'study', 'day', 'night', 'unrecognizable', 'Paris', 'where', 'modernist', 'architecture', 'have', 'obliterated', 'city', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'Tati', 'point', 'what', 'urban', 'life', 'done', 'Western', 'civilization', 'worldwide', 'indeed', 'film', 'frequently', 'see', 'travel', 'posters', 'advertising', 'foreign', 'cities', 'where', 'same', 'ugly', 'concrete', 'skyscraper', 'blocking', 'out', 'views', 'more', 'distinctive', 'landmarks', 'Tati', 'genius', ""n't"", 'linger', 'nostalgia', 'matter', 'been', 'lost', 'Tati', 'characters', 'must', 'move', 'forward', 'make', 'do', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'point', 'gorgeously', 'made', 'film', 'when', 'fleetingly', 'cupolas', 'Sacre', 'Coeur', 'spire', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'are', 'seen', 'reflections', 'glassed', 'doorways', 'see', 'reflected', 'images', 'characters', 'film', 'look', 'back', 'pre-contemporary', 'landmarks', 'softly', 'sigh', 'then', 'move', 'forward', 'modernist', 'Paris', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'work', 'with.But', 'pleasure', 'PLAYTIME', 'modernist', 'Paris', 'may', 'be', 'ugly', 'kind', 'glass-and-cement', 'playground', 'adults', 'everything', 'Tati', 'Paris', 'breaking', 'down', 'hopelessly', 'confusing', 'source', 'tremendous', 'fun', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'film', 'participants', 'story', 'Tati', 'French', 'Everyman', 'endearingly', 'clumsy', 'Monsieur', 'Hulot', 'path', 'group', 'American', 'tourists', 'dialogue', 'written', 'Art', 'Buchwald', 'most', 'memorable', 'when', 'visit', 'technology', 'fair', 'Ooh', 'so', 'pratical', 'one', 'intones', 'model', 'demonstrate', 'new', 'eyeglasses', 'lift-up', 'lenses', 'doing', 'one', 'eyeshadow', 'Hulot', 'confusion', 'modernity', 'inevitably', 'chaos', 'wake', 'just', 'everyone', 'end', 'film', 'memorably', 'charmed', 'prettiest', 'tourists', 'Also', 'film', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'triumph', 'sense', 'postmodern', 'play', 'firmly', 'place', 'everytime', 'see', 'film', 'choke', 'up', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'when', 'traffic', 'circle', 'brilliantly', 'transformed', 'Tati', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'choreography', 'kind', 'funfair', 'something', 'very', 'moving', 'seeing', 'finally', 'Tati', 'landscape', 'modernity', 'space', 'fun', 'play', 'rather', 'alienation', 'disintegration.I', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'have', 'first', 'seen', 'film', 'Eighties', 'widescreen', 'Brattle', 'Theatre', 'Cambridge', 'Mass', 'just', 'about', 'impossible', 'see', 'film', 'way', 'anymore', 'great', 'shame', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'was', 'employed', 'full', 'use', 'Tati', 'often', 'something', 'going', 'sides', 'screen', 'current', 'DVD', 'format', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'small', 'potatoes', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'seen', 'format']",Playtime

What makes Tati's masterwork such an awe-inspiring experience for the senses is that he has developed and cultivated his very own Paris... and not the silly ""this is a movie"" dreamy, etherial romanticized Paris of AMELIE, but rather a more grounded-still-beatific-at-its-best Paris that could exist with the right set of eyes (as opposed to the right set of CGI, filters, etc.)Yes, Tati used his own visual trickery and the like, but again, it was more of a playful jaunt in contrast to a simple click of a button.This movie is amazing in that you are watching a reality constructed, almost as it seems, just for you (yes, YOU!!)

The humor, while brilliant, is often subtle; no comedian ever found more humor in inanimate objects (and, as here, design) than Tati.  Mr. Hulot isn't front and center in PLAYTIME; the main character's Paris, denatured and dehumanized by modernism.  (One of the picture's funniest, and most poignant, images is the rapid, lonely reflection of the Eiffel Tower in a quickly-opened skyscraper door.)  Viewers will have fun finding the abundent sight gags on display, frequently somewhere on the periphery of the action; this is one movie that should richly repay repeated viewings.

579939,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,B00005B1ZM,Wayne A.,"[7, 7]","This is the best example of Tati's experimental approach to humor. In fact it's sort of a cubist comedy with multiple layering of material and no discernible plot in any recognizable sense. Yet it works, it works well, and at no time will you feel it's aimless or merely episodic. Sounds a bit intellectual but this film is actually filled with endless great sight gags and some of the best slapstick you'll ever encounter. Keaton aside, this has two of the best &quot;falls&quot; in comedy. Also, the nightclub scene at the end is a masterpiece of timing and coordination. It reminds me of classic jazz improvisation. Like Keaton's &quot;The General&quot; this movie bombed when it was released but I'm betting it'll eventually be added to the list of great comedies of all time. Hopefully Criterion will re-release this soon and keep it in print.Two caveats: I've noticed that people who expect comedies to be consistently manic and/or aren't accustomed to the slower pacing of many French films don't care much for this movie. It does require the focused attention of its audience to work. Also, the film was originally released in some oddball format that doesn't always translate effectively to the home screen. Because of this one major routine doesn't work quite as well as intended. It's not a major problem though.",5,Amazing!,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1323,"['best', 'example', 'Tati', 'experimental', 'approach', 'humor', 'fact', 'sort', 'cubist', 'comedy', 'multiple', 'layering', 'material', 'discernible', 'plot', 'recognizable', 'sense', 'well', 'time', 'will', 'feel', 'aimless', 'merely', 'episodic', 'bit', 'intellectual', 'film', 'actually', 'filled', 'endless', 'great', 'sight', 'gags', 'best', 'slapstick', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'encounter', 'Keaton', 'aside', 'two', 'best', 'quot', 'quot', 'comedy', 'Also', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'end', 'masterpiece', 'timing', 'coordination', 'classic', 'jazz', 'improvisation', 'Keaton', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'movie', 'bombed', 'when', 'was', 'released', ""'m"", 'betting', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'be', 'added', 'list', 'great', 'comedies', 'time', 'Hopefully', 'Criterion', 'will', 're-release', 'soon', 'keep', 'print.Two', 'caveats', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'people', 'who', 'expect', 'comedies', 'be', 'consistently', 'manic', 'and/or', 'are', ""n't"", 'accustomed', 'slower', 'pacing', 'many', 'French', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'movie', 'require', 'focused', 'attention', 'audience', 'work', 'Also', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'oddball', 'format', ""n't"", 'always', 'translate', 'effectively', 'home', 'screen', 'one', 'major', 'routine', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'intended', 'not', 'major', 'problem']",Playtime
