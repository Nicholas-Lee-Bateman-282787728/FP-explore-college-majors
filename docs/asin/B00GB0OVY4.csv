Poor people and ruthless gangs used and controlled by government.  Brick Mansions depiction of Detroit is nothing but a shallow, self-righteous attempt to rewrite history and to fool the audience on why people are who they are.  20 Ft Below&#8217;s message was more internal and focused on the intestinal fortitude of characters overcoming their plight.  Both have lead characters who have lost a wife.  However, Brick Mansions has a single protagonist who leads the story, while 20 Ft Below is more an ensemble. Ensemble pieces are difficult to write; the writer did not bring out the best in the story.  But the story is there.  The Skeeter character was fun to watch.  Sound and lighting were very nice for an ultra low budget film.  Low budget films can jump start careers.  I hope to see some of these actors in bigger budget films.",3,20 Ft Below and Brick Mansions Have Similarities,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,888,"['20', 'Ft', 'Below', 'similar', 'Brick', 'Mansions', 'plot', 'Poor', 'people', 'ruthless', 'gangs', 'used', 'controlled', 'government', 'Brick', 'Mansions', 'depiction', 'Detroit', 'nothing', 'shallow', 'self-righteous', 'attempt', 'rewrite', 'history', 'fool', 'audience', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'who', 'are', '20', 'Ft', 'Below', '8217', 's', 'message', 'was', 'more', 'internal', 'focused', 'intestinal', 'fortitude', 'characters', 'overcoming', 'plight', 'have', 'lead', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'wife', 'However', 'Brick', 'Mansions', 'single', 'protagonist', 'who', 'story', '20', 'Ft', 'Below', 'more', 'ensemble', 'Ensemble', 'pieces', 'are', 'difficult', 'write', 'writer', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'story', 'story', 'there', 'Skeeter', 'character', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'Sound', 'lighting', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'ultra', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Low', 'budget', 'films', 'can', 'jump', 'start', 'careers', 'hope', 'see', 'actors', 'bigger', 'budget', 'films']",20ft Below
1677702,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00GB0OVY4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[5, 5]","Angel (Danny Trejo) is a tough intellectual anarchist who rules the deep underground of NYC. In the opening scene he kidnaps and kills the wealthy Jason Wells (Peter Dobson) which leads to an unsuccessful police sweep.  Jake (Frank Krueger) is an ex-cop who lost his wife, rules the area between the streets and Angel's world. Chelsea (Kinga Philipps) is a reporter who successfully gets an interview with Angel and then takes her time leaving the tunnels.Jake's speeches on his lost love were as badly written and delivered as Angel's anarchy fluff. In fact the whole film had a nausea that reminded me of &#34;Billy Jack.&#34;The film is supposed to be a metaphor about living in the dark and alone with Jake representing the microcosm and the underworld the macrocosm. It was done rather sloppily with unrealistic characters.For Trejo fans it is far better than &#34;Voodoo Possession&#34; but not as good as &#34;Bullet.&#34;  Can't wait for &#34;Volcano Zombies.&#34;No sex or nudity.

1677704,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B00GB0OVY4,Trejofan,"[1, 1]","Loved this movie.  It was pretty well done considering it was a low budget film. It starts out with a young female photojournalist, investigating a rumor of numerous people living underground in abandoned subway tunnels.(from the number of shows based on that premise, there must be a lot of abandoned subway tunnels.)  She is particularly interested in tracking down the leader of the cult, named &#34;Angel&#34; (Mr. Trejo).  She first connects with a young man who lives down there who appears to be somewhat delusional and perhaps schizophrenic and plays the part very well, but soon connects with an ex-policeman who went to the tunnels to deal with the grief of losing his wife leaving the world behind.  He and a few other underground characters become her guardians and guides as they explore the tunnels. Soon they encounter &#34;Angel&#34; (the majestic Mr Trejo) who plays the cult leader, poised to emerge from the tunnels to stage a revolution.  The acting is very good, with the Majestic Mr. Trejo being delightful evil and dressed in his sleeveless top displaying his impressive upper arms.
