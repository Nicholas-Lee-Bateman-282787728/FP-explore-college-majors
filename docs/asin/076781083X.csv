10111,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,076781083X,brainout,"[0, 0]","One can't help but think that the purpose of this movie was to answer a film project homework requirement in college.  The town didn't have anything to do with the movie, was just the destination.  Kinda over-the-top, to use the town's name for the movie's theme.  It only manages to be preachy.I think maybe they were trying to do a character study, of how bonding with one's kidnapper works, or other such philosophical angles.  The acting is okay, maybe even good, casting is okay, and they do work as a team/ensemble;  but the script is mediocre at best.  Maybe on purpose, to show that crime isn't at all fun.  Maybe that's why big-name stars like Rod Steiger and Martin Sheen signed on for bit parts.But it comes off as a movie you'd show to high school students to teach them why crime doesn't pay.  A little too heavy with that message;  pacing was not good.  We shouldn't make movies that glamorize crime, to be sure;  but we don't need to make them so boring, that the message isn't learned.",2,WHY did they make this movie?,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1001,"['One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'answer', 'film', 'project', 'homework', 'requirement', 'college', 'town', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'destination', 'Kinda', 'over-the-top', 'use', 'town', 'name', 'movie', 'theme', 'only', 'be', 'preachy.I', 'think', 'maybe', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'bonding', 'one', 'kidnapper', 'other', 'such', 'philosophical', 'angles', 'acting', 'okay', 'maybe', 'even', 'good', 'casting', 'okay', 'do', 'work', 'team/ensemble', 'script', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Maybe', 'purpose', 'show', 'crime', ""n't"", 'fun', 'why', 'big-name', 'stars', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'signed', 'bit', 'parts.But', 'off', 'movie', ""'d"", 'show', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'teach', 'why', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'message', 'pacing', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'glamorize', 'crime', 'be', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'so', 'boring', 'message', ""n't"", 'learned']",N/A
10112,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,076781083X,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I'm sure you've heard politicians make the following claim:  ""We need to reduce our deficit so that our children don't end up paying for our bad spending habits.""  While I agree wholeheartedly that the US spending is completely out of control -- I am for a forced balanced budget, with only possible exceptions being perhaps wartime scenarios --  I roll my eyes when I hear the ""children"" part.  Why?  Well, it devolves into an ""appeal to emotion"" argument, which actually makes it not an argument at all as it would then be invalid.  All you really need to say is, ""It is economically undesirable to run a debt,"" and that is sufficient.  Leave the whole ""children"" part out.And if you'll notice, not too many women or children are killed or harmed in this film.  The filmmakers know that they need the ""bad guys"" here to still be mildly sympathetic, at least to an American audience, so everyone that gets hurt or killed here seems to be a man.  It's OK to kill off guys in America, after all.  I did watch a home invasion reenactment on ID TV one time, where the two perps killed a whole family -- including a couple of very young children -- with hammers.  Yikes.  So yes, women and children are not safe from real-life criminals.But there's something even worse going on here.  If you watch closely, one of the only characters here that is both smart and ethical is the black guy.  Everyone else is ""ethically malleable"" for a lack of better phrasing; either that, or not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Why is this?  Well, most likely, the screenwriter succumbed to political correctness pressures on that front would be my guess.I was mildly interested in checking out this film due to an odd coincidence:  if you know the true story about ""The Toy Box Killer"" -- David Parker Ray -- you will realize that, while this film was being shot in Truth or Consequences, NM (peeking around the web it wasn't) -- Mr. Ray was torturing women in nearly unspeakable ways in that same city.  And right about the same time, 1997, his sidekick Cindy Hendy, who moved out of a town in Washington State just as I was moving in, was travelling down to join him.  It's ironic how life does imitate art, or vice versa, as we have some pretty bad characters in this film as well.This movie could have been actually pretty decent, but as I've been implying, it took the cowardly way out.  I did like some of the acting, in particular Vincent Gallo.  I tell you, he could act in the worst movie ever and still pull off a great performance.  He has a real raw edge to him while still holding his acting fundamentals.  And while I'm not the biggest Kiefer Sutherland fan overall, I think that he's actually pretty sharp here as well.But this film really falls apart in the believability department.  I didn't believe that the hostages would remain so calm, and I didn't believe that at least one of the hostages wouldn't have been treated much worse.  (You will know who I'm writing about if you choose to watch this minor misfire, and you know how that treatment would have happened.). And I have to admit, I almost hated the obvious whole there-but-for-the-Grace-of-God-go-I theme here; they try to show that criminals and law-abiding citizens aren't all that different, and how a supposed good guy can easily go bad.This film should have been called ""Not Much Truth but a Whole Lotta Consequences.""  That would have been more fitting after watching this unfortunate misfire.",3,Not Much Truth but a Whole Lotta Consequences,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,3462,"[""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'politicians', 'make', 'following', 'claim', 'need', 'reduce', 'deficit', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'bad', 'spending', 'habits', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'US', 'spending', 'completely', 'control', 'am', 'forced', 'balanced', 'budget', 'only', 'possible', 'exceptions', 'being', 'perhaps', 'wartime', 'scenarios', 'roll', 'eyes', 'when', 'hear', 'children', 'part', 'Why', 'Well', 'appeal', 'emotion', 'argument', 'actually', 'not', 'argument', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'invalid', 'really', 'need', 'say', 'economically', 'undesirable', 'run', 'debt', 'sufficient', 'Leave', 'whole', 'children', 'part', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'women', 'children', 'are', 'killed', 'harmed', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'need', 'bad', 'guys', 'here', 'still', 'be', 'mildly', 'sympathetic', 'least', 'American', 'audience', 'everyone', 'hurt', 'killed', 'here', 'be', 'man', 'OK', 'kill', 'off', 'guys', 'America', 'did', 'watch', 'home', 'invasion', 'reenactment', 'ID', 'TV', 'one', 'time', 'where', 'two', 'perps', 'killed', 'whole', 'family', 'including', 'couple', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'hammers', 'Yikes', 'So', 'yes', 'women', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'real-life', 'criminals.But', 'something', 'even', 'worse', 'going', 'here', 'watch', 'closely', 'one', 'only', 'characters', 'here', 'smart', 'ethical', 'black', 'guy', 'Everyone', 'else', 'ethically', 'malleable', 'lack', 'better', 'phrasing', 'not', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'Why', 'Well', 'most', 'likely', 'screenwriter', 'succumbed', 'political', 'correctness', 'pressures', 'front', 'would', 'be', 'guess.I', 'was', 'mildly', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'film', 'due', 'odd', 'coincidence', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'Toy', 'Box', 'Killer', 'David', 'Parker', 'Ray', 'will', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'shot', 'Truth', 'Consequences', 'NM', 'peeking', 'web', 'was', ""n't"", 'Mr.', 'Ray', 'was', 'torturing', 'women', 'nearly', 'unspeakable', 'ways', 'same', 'city', 'right', 'same', 'time', '1997', 'sidekick', 'Cindy', 'Hendy', 'who', 'moved', 'out', 'town', 'Washington', 'State', 'just', 'was', 'moving', 'was', 'travelling', 'down', 'join', 'ironic', 'how', 'life', 'imitate', 'art', 'vice', 'versa', 'have', 'pretty', 'bad', 'characters', 'film', 'well.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', ""'ve"", 'been', 'implying', 'took', 'cowardly', 'way', 'did', 'like', 'acting', 'particular', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'tell', 'could', 'act', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'performance', 'real', 'raw', 'edge', 'still', 'holding', 'acting', 'fundamentals', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'fan', 'overall', 'think', 'actually', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'here', 'well.But', 'film', 'really', 'apart', 'believability', 'department', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hostages', 'would', 'remain', 'so', 'calm', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'least', 'one', 'hostages', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'much', 'worse', 'will', 'know', 'who', ""'m"", 'writing', 'choose', 'watch', 'minor', 'misfire', 'know', 'how', 'treatment', 'would', 'have', 'happened.', 'have', 'admit', 'almost', 'hated', 'obvious', 'whole', 'there-but-for-the-Grace-of-God-go-I', 'theme', 'here', 'try', 'show', 'criminals', 'law-abiding', 'citizens', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'different', 'how', 'supposed', 'good', 'guy', 'can', 'easily', 'go', 'bad.This', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Not', 'Much', 'Truth', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Consequences', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fitting', 'watching', 'unfortunate', 'misfire']",N/A

10115,AY12DBB0U420B,076781083X,Gary Peterson,"[1, 2]","This evening's featured late-nite movie was ""Truth or Consequences, NM."" Strange name for a town. I remember when it got that name. It used to be named Hot Springs, or something like that. They changed it to T. or C. after the name of a TV-radio quiz show of the late 40s-early 50s. In any case, the final scenes of the movie were supposedly at Truth or Consequences, NM. Actually, the geology looked more like that of the Zion Park area of Utah about 400 miles to the west-horthwest. Sorry 'bout that. I'm a geologist and I always notice such details. Sometimes it ruins the movie. Not in this case. It made the movie more interesting.I don't know whether to call this a road movie or a chase movie. I guess it was a chase movie on the roads. Geographically, however, it was all mixed up and I found that distracting. The plot had some cheap hoods stealing dope and then transporting it around to seek their fortune in it's sale. Alas, they stole it from the mob and attempted to sell it back to the mob. Not a smart move! The cops were in hot pursuit and, the mob was in hot pursuit after the four guys and the dope. Did I mention that there were two women with the guys? Well, what would a story be without a few women along? In any case. this little melange of bad guys (the girls were OK) were on a rampage across the southwester US stealing cars and leaving a trail of dead bodies. How many dead? Well, I lost track by about 2/3 through the movie and most of the deaths were at the end. All of the original group (except one undercover cop in their midst) met their maker, even the women. Was it a violent movie? Well, yes. Was the violence a main selling point of the movie? Probably, I don't know what any other selling point would be. Was the plot of any value and scope other than the violence? Not really. Was the acting any good? Well, it  was neither particularly good nor bad. Was the movie entertaining? Yaawwwnnnn!

The story brings nothing new, consisting in another heist situation where we are presented to a bunch of criminals and their operations. What makes the movie work is the character development, since these criminals are three-dimensional individuals and the viewer actually gets to know them as flawed people and not merely one-sided badass charicatures. Sutherland gets some ideas from a couple of Tarantino and Roger Rodriguez` films, going for the young-villains-on-the-run perspective with some witty and offbeat scenes, but overall he makes it work despite these influences. The acting is overall consistent, with Sutherland himself, infant terrible Vincent Gallo, Kevin Pollack and Kim Dickens.

Keifer Sutherland is...well, Keifer Sutherland. He never plays against type, as the hardcore villain, and this role is no exception. Still, there are more twists than a licorice whip, and the film takes us through a grisly robbery and chase that thankfully omits the cliches of similar films. Outstanding performance from Myketi Williams.Recommended for fans of such fare.",3,"The Poor Man's ""One False Move""",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,580,"['action-packed', 'robbers', 'run', 'film', 'model', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'One', 'False', 'Move', 'Franklin', 'film', 'had', 'tightly-woven', 'plot', 'here', 'were', 'two', 'many', 'subplots', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'well', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'never', 'type', 'hardcore', 'villain', 'role', 'exception', 'Still', 'are', 'more', 'twists', 'licorice', 'whip', 'film', 'grisly', 'robbery', 'chase', 'thankfully', 'cliches', 'similar', 'films', 'Outstanding', 'performance', 'Myketi', 'Williams.Recommended', 'fans', 'such', 'fare']",N/A
10124,A352W7VHU57GYP,076781083X,"""vinces""","[0, 0]","This is a love story superimposed on top of an action crime drama.  Very smart marketing but you don't get the best of either that way.  Overall though it succeeds.Far less flaws than most big budget blockbusters but here they are anyway:1.  The dynamics between Sutherland's and Gallo's characters in the first quarter of the film are inconsistent.  Sutherland is a totally ruthless, remorseless killer who commits crime with the relentless one way commitment of a barracuda on the attack.  But his compatriots are opposed to killing and he endures way more whining, arguing and complaining than a softer character would have put up with.  There was a point early in the film when it would have been entirely logical and self consistent for his character to just blow his partners away (I TOLD you to shut up, whatchu gonna do now?) and proceed solo.2. Much the dialogue in the beginning is weak.  It improves later on.3. The the overbearing, overloud Gen Y point-something-or-other soundtrack.  The &quot;Hey we're just havin' a groovy time rockin' down the highway&quot; vibe it imparts is out of place.4. The romantic subplot.  It might have been possible to take the subplot alone and turn it into a great love story but here it only gets in the way.  Along with it comes the melodramatic bittersweet ending which epitomizes bathos (sic).Sutherland is the heavy even though Vincent Gallo has the lead role.  Gallo is sort of heavy #2.  He's a victim of circumstances, in a way, swept up in a storm of events that starts with a drug heist gone bad.  He's also the male half of the love story; Kim Dickens does a great job as the female half.  Mykelti Williamson is superb as Marcus, the undercover DEA agent.  My only prior exposure to Kevin Pollak was as a hardened criminal in, The Usual Suspects, and it's disorienting to see him here as a conflicted hostage but he pulls it off.  Grace Phillips is excellent as his girlfriend.Three and a half stars, almost four.  Very solid acting, excellent pacing and action.  Ya oughta check it.",3,Above Average,996451200,"07 30, 2001",2001,2040,"['love', 'story', 'superimposed', 'top', 'action', 'crime', 'drama', 'Very', 'smart', 'marketing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'best', 'way', 'Overall', 'less', 'flaws', 'most', 'big', 'budget', 'blockbusters', 'here', 'are', 'anyway:1', 'dynamics', 'Sutherland', 'Gallo', 'characters', 'first', 'quarter', 'film', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'Sutherland', 'totally', 'ruthless', 'remorseless', 'killer', 'who', 'crime', 'relentless', 'one', 'way', 'commitment', 'barracuda', 'attack', 'compatriots', 'are', 'opposed', 'killing', 'way', 'more', 'whining', 'arguing', 'complaining', 'softer', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'was', 'point', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'logical', 'self', 'consistent', 'character', 'just', 'blow', 'partners', 'away', 'TOLD', 'shut', 'up', 'whatchu', 'gon', 'do', 'now', 'proceed', 'solo.2', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'weak', 'later', 'on.3', 'overbearing', 'overloud', 'Gen', 'Y', 'point-something-or-other', 'soundtrack', 'quot', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'just', 'havin', 'groovy', 'time', 'rockin', 'down', 'highway', 'quot', 'place.4', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'take', 'subplot', 'alone', 'turn', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'only', 'way', 'melodramatic', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'bathos', 'sic', '.Sutherland', 'heavy', 'even', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'lead', 'role', 'Gallo', 'sort', 'heavy', '2', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'way', 'swept', 'up', 'storm', 'events', 'drug', 'heist', 'gone', 'bad', 'also', 'male', 'half', 'love', 'story', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'great', 'job', 'female', 'half', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'superb', 'Marcus', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'agent', 'only', 'prior', 'exposure', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'was', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'disorienting', 'see', 'here', 'conflicted', 'hostage', 'off', 'Grace', 'Phillips', 'excellent', 'girlfriend.Three', 'half', 'stars', 'almost', 'four', 'Very', 'solid', 'acting', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'action', 'Ya', 'oughta', 'check']",N/A
