751059,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00008ZZ9M,Anyechka,"[0, 0]","I first saw this film in the spring of 2001 in my Modern Russian Culture class and enjoyed it, so it was a pleasure to finally revisit it so many years later, particularly since it stars two of the best Russian actors in recent times, Oleg Menshikov and Sergey Bodrov, Jr. (who would star together again three years later in 'East-West').  Though it's never explicitly spelled out, we know that this is set during the disastrous Chechen conflict and takes place in Chechnya.  People used to American war movies might complain because it seems pretty slow-paced in comparison, with not a lot of action, but that's because this is a character-driven film.  It proceeds at the leisurely pace so we can get to know the characters and watch as their relationships unfold.  It makes the viewer think about things like the futility of war, whether there really are clear-cut good guys and bad guys, and what happens when cultures collide.Private Ivan Zhilin (Vanya), played by Bodrov, has just joined the Army and been sent into Chechnya.  Not long after arriving, his party is ambushed, and only he and the sergeant, Aleksandr Kostylin (Sasha), played by Menshikov, are left alive.  The two of them are taken prisoner by the rebels.  Normally they'd only take one hostage, but this time they decide to take both in case one of them should die of his injuries before they're able to use them as a bargaining chip.  They end up in chains in the house of Abdul Murat, whose son has been taken prisoner by the Russians.  While in captivity, these two soldiers, who are complete opposites, find themselves developing an unlikely friendship, with Sasha even becoming a bit of a father figure to Vanya, who doesn't have a father.  They also develop unlikely friendships with Hasan, the tongueless man who is guarding them, and Dina, Abdul's beautiful 13 year old daughter.  The plot thickens when Abdul orders them to write to their mothers asking them to come to the area and ask for a prisoner exchange.  Sasha doesn't have parents, but Vanya's mother is absolutely devoted to him, and he is confident that she's going to come through for him no matter what.  Overall, it shows the human side of war instead of endless battles and an us vs. them mentality, nor does it have the typical ending one would expect from an American film.  The photography is also absolutely gorgeous.This film is highly recommended to those who are interested in anti-war films, particularly when they're such a radical change of pace from the types of films made in Hollywood.  The acting is also first-rate, in spite of not being a very action-packed film.  It's a pity so few of the films of Oleg Menshikov and Sergey Bodrov, Jr. are available in the West.  Menshikov had been established as one of Russia's best younger actors for awhile, but this was only Bodrov's second film, and helped to make him one of Russia's most popular rising young stars.  Knowing he was killed in an avalanche in September of 2002 at the age of only 30 makes watching some parts of this film, given the perceived nearness of death and the topics of conversation the characters sometimes have, even sadder and more poignant.  What a waste of looks and talent.  Also very notable is the young woman playing Dina, the Chechen girl who forms an unlikely friendship with Vanya and whom Vanya falls in love with.  And what with barely any films having been made about the Chechen war, this can help to give the Western viewer an insightful look into what it was all about, beyond simplistic media headlines.",4,An unlikely war film,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3552,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'spring', '2001', 'Modern', 'Russian', 'Culture', 'class', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'pleasure', 'finally', 'revisit', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'particularly', 'two', 'best', 'Russian', 'actors', 'recent', 'times', 'Oleg', 'Menshikov', 'Sergey', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'who', 'would', 'star', 'together', 'again', 'three', 'years', 'later', ""'East-West"", 'never', 'explicitly', 'spelled', 'out', 'know', 'set', 'disastrous', 'Chechen', 'conflict', 'place', 'Chechnya', 'People', 'used', 'American', 'war', 'movies', 'might', 'complain', 'pretty', 'slow-paced', 'comparison', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'character-driven', 'film', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'watch', 'relationships', 'unfold', 'viewer', 'think', 'things', 'futility', 'war', 'really', 'are', 'clear-cut', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'what', 'when', 'cultures', 'collide.Private', 'Ivan', 'Zhilin', 'Vanya', 'played', 'Bodrov', 'just', 'joined', 'Army', 'been', 'sent', 'Chechnya', 'Not', 'long', 'arriving', 'party', 'ambushed', 'only', 'sergeant', 'Aleksandr', 'Kostylin', 'Sasha', 'played', 'Menshikov', 'are', 'left', 'alive', 'two', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'rebels', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'only', 'take', 'one', 'hostage', 'time', 'decide', 'take', 'case', 'one', 'should', 'die', 'injuries', ""'re"", 'able', 'use', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'end', 'up', 'chains', 'house', 'Abdul', 'Murat', 'son', 'been', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Russians', 'captivity', 'two', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'find', 'developing', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Sasha', 'even', 'becoming', 'bit', 'father', 'figure', 'Vanya', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'father', 'also', 'develop', 'unlikely', 'friendships', 'Hasan', 'tongueless', 'man', 'who', 'guarding', 'Dina', 'Abdul', 'beautiful', '13', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'plot', 'when', 'Abdul', 'orders', 'write', 'mothers', 'asking', 'come', 'area', 'ask', 'prisoner', 'exchange', 'Sasha', ""n't"", 'have', 'parents', 'Vanya', 'mother', 'absolutely', 'devoted', 'confident', 'going', 'come', 'matter', 'what', 'Overall', 'human', 'side', 'war', 'instead', 'endless', 'battles', 'vs.', 'mentality', 'have', 'typical', 'ending', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'American', 'film', 'photography', 'also', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous.This', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'anti-war', 'films', 'particularly', 'when', ""'re"", 'radical', 'change', 'pace', 'types', 'films', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'acting', 'also', 'first-rate', 'spite', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'action-packed', 'film', 'pity', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'Oleg', 'Menshikov', 'Sergey', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'are', 'available', 'West', 'Menshikov', 'had', 'been', 'established', 'one', 'Russia', 'best', 'younger', 'actors', 'awhile', 'was', 'only', 'Bodrov', 'second', 'film', 'helped', 'make', 'one', 'Russia', 'most', 'popular', 'rising', 'young', 'stars', 'Knowing', 'was', 'killed', 'avalanche', 'September', '2002', 'age', 'only', '30', 'watching', 'parts', 'film', 'given', 'perceived', 'nearness', 'death', 'topics', 'conversation', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'have', 'even', 'sadder', 'more', 'poignant', 'What', 'waste', 'looks', 'talent', 'Also', 'very', 'notable', 'young', 'woman', 'playing', 'Dina', 'Chechen', 'girl', 'who', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Vanya', 'whom', 'Vanya', 'love', 'what', 'barely', 'films', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'Chechen', 'war', 'can', 'help', 'give', 'Western', 'viewer', 'insightful', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'simplistic', 'media', 'headlines']",N/A

751061,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B00008ZZ9M,C. Rothlind,"[2, 2]","The cover of this DVD has to be one of the most misleading advertisements ever. Suggesting an up-lifting action adventure, the film is in fact an almost delicate, supremely objective yet lyrical tale of two soldiers taken hostage in the Caucasian Mountains during war with Russia. A film gratifyingly more interested in character development than action sequences.Bodrov Sr. seems not to want to impose any kind of style on his narrative, which made me rather suspicious watching it (was the director an auteur or just an amateur?!). As if not resisting the temptation to be flamboyant and maximize tension would have made the film better rather than just more obvious. Bodrov eschews tension, even when it would be justified.Bodrov tells his story from several perspectives rather than privileging good over bad personages. You come away understanding what's at stake for everyone involved. When justice is meted out it seems both horrific and karmically motivated. In his objectivity Bodrov reminds me especially of Otto Preminger, well-known for his refusal to privilege anyone's perspective or to simplify ambiguities of character. Both in his mis-en-scene and camera style, Bodrov is very much a classicist: the elements of cinematic style take a back seat to the story being told.The events unfold as seen from a distance. Against the desolate and serene beauty of the Caucasian mountains the actions of men appear miniscule; an element in the landscape destined to be submerged and forgotten in its vast, super-human dimension.The camera seems to love Sergei Bodrov Jr. (the director's son), who calls attention to himself with his luminous eyes, awkwardly ample lips, and shy, buck-toothed grin. He's got real screen presence. Or had: he died in a land-slide about six years after this while directing his own film. His body was never found.This is a very special film about a part of the world few people will ever get to experience first-hand. By all means take the journey.MGM has for once managed to issue a film in an immaculate and detailed transfer.

During their captivity, both the Russians and their Muslim captors begin to appreciate the humanity in each other.  However, the war continues to exert its dehumanizing influence, pressuring everyone concerned to follow the path of violence.  When one character makes a quiet break from this pattern, it is a small triumph in this low-key but affecting film.

I postponed ordering the DVD because of that.  What I saw when I finally watched the movie was one of the most outstanding anti-war movies I have seen.  I won't delve too far into the plot because what I watched took me by surprise and I wouldn't want to spoil that for anyone else.The story is about two Russian soldiers who are captured in an ambush by Chetnyn rebels.  A Chetnyn father had asked for a hostage as ransom for his son.  He got two instead.  What happens after that point is the essence of the film.While the storyline is very compelling, I really enjoyed the setting for the movie.  High in the Causcasion mountains in a village that couldn't have been designed by any set director, I witnessed a world that I was grateful to be able to see.  The Chetnyn village was a step back a century or so.The events that transpired were a transcension of cultures in a way that left a lasting impression.  That impression was very satisfying but it became all the more educational with the ending.  At first I sensed a transition from hope to dispair but I understood the director's message to be that the hope is real but it will take some work by all parties.",5,Tovarich,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,1267,"['was', 'rather', 'confused', 'Prisoner', 'Mountains', 'synopsis', 'read', 'postponed', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'What', 'saw', 'when', 'finally', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'anti-war', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'too', 'far', 'plot', 'what', 'watched', 'took', 'surprise', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'story', 'two', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'captured', 'ambush', 'Chetnyn', 'rebels', 'Chetnyn', 'father', 'had', 'asked', 'hostage', 'ransom', 'son', 'got', 'two', 'instead', 'What', 'point', 'essence', 'film.While', 'storyline', 'very', 'compelling', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'setting', 'movie', 'High', 'Causcasion', 'mountains', 'village', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'set', 'director', 'witnessed', 'world', 'was', 'grateful', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Chetnyn', 'village', 'was', 'step', 'back', 'century', 'so.The', 'events', 'transpired', 'were', 'transcension', 'cultures', 'way', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'impression', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying', 'became', 'more', 'educational', 'ending', 'first', 'sensed', 'transition', 'hope', 'dispair', 'understood', 'director', 'message', 'be', 'hope', 'real', 'will', 'take', 'work', 'parties']",N/A

The leader of the guerrillas wants the captives to exchange for his son who is being held by the Russians.  The captives are taken to a small village high in the mountains where they are chained to each other to prevent their escape.  Initially the battle-hardened, cynical sergeant has little time for the youngster, and they almost come to blows several times.  As the film develops, they develop a friendship, the sergeant becoming a mentor to the younger soldier.  We also learn a great deal about small town life of the Chechens, some of their customs and habits.  Both the Chechen and Russians develop a grudging respect for each other during their close interaction, even if they are at war.  The tense, tragic ending of the film is particularly well done.This is nominally a war film, but there isn't very much action, it is largely character driven.  The primary interest of this film will be, for  most viewers, to see and experience some of the moral complexities of the Chechen war from a Russian perspective.  From an American's perspective, many of the issues discussed in this film are probably relevant the US occupation of Iraq and (more directly relevant) Afghanistan.  The political issues surrounding the war are not discussed at all, this is really a study of the effect of the war on those who actually have to do the fighting and dying.  I think some of the most glowing reviews overrate this film a bit (it isn't something you are going to watch over and over again), but it is still a very nice story.  The developing, complex relationships between the captives and their captors are well portrayed.  These are a people at war, but both sides come to realize that the others are not animals.  The cinematography is outstanding.  I never realized how bleak and forboding the landscape of the Caucasus was (having never been there myself).  This alone is worth the price of admission.Bottom line - not destined to be an all time classic, but definitely worth a look, particularly if you want to learn a little bit about Chechnya or the Russian-Chechan war.",4,Compelling view of the Russian war in Chechnya during the 90s,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2229,"['Two', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'seasoned', 'sergeant', 'raw', 'recruit', 'are', 'captured', 'ambush', 'Chechen', 'separatists', 'war', 'Chechnya', '90s', 'leader', 'guerrillas', 'captives', 'exchange', 'son', 'who', 'being', 'held', 'Russians', 'captives', 'are', 'taken', 'small', 'village', 'high', 'mountains', 'where', 'are', 'chained', 'other', 'prevent', 'escape', 'Initially', 'battle-hardened', 'cynical', 'sergeant', 'little', 'time', 'youngster', 'almost', 'come', 'blows', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'develop', 'friendship', 'sergeant', 'becoming', 'mentor', 'younger', 'soldier', 'also', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'Chechens', 'customs', 'habits', 'Chechen', 'Russians', 'develop', 'grudging', 'respect', 'other', 'close', 'interaction', 'even', 'are', 'war', 'tense', 'tragic', 'ending', 'film', 'particularly', 'well', 'done.This', 'nominally', 'war', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'action', 'largely', 'character', 'driven', 'primary', 'interest', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'viewers', 'see', 'experience', 'moral', 'complexities', 'Chechen', 'war', 'Russian', 'perspective', 'American', 'perspective', 'many', 'issues', 'discussed', 'film', 'are', 'probably', 'relevant', 'US', 'occupation', 'Iraq', 'more', 'directly', 'relevant', 'Afghanistan', 'political', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'war', 'are', 'not', 'discussed', 'really', 'study', 'effect', 'war', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'do', 'fighting', 'dying', 'think', 'most', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'overrate', 'film', 'bit', ""n't"", 'something', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'story', 'developing', 'complex', 'relationships', 'captives', 'captors', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'are', 'people', 'war', 'sides', 'come', 'realize', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'animals', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'bleak', 'forboding', 'landscape', 'Caucasus', 'was', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'alone', 'price', 'admission.Bottom', 'line', 'not', 'destined', 'be', 'time', 'classic', 'definitely', 'look', 'particularly', 'want', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'Chechnya', 'Russian-Chechan', 'war']",N/A
