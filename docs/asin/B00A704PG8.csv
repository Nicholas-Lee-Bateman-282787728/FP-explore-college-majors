Then, in the last 15 or 20 minutes, very suddenly, there is a whirlwind of revelations that make it worth the wait. I recommend you watch the closing credits, which actually bring the story full circle, and add to the overall impact. One major shortcoming is an unfortunate lack of atmosphere, especially during the first 45 minutes or so, which is do largely to uninspired lighting, and an over reliance on loud whooshing wind effects. Nonetheless, worth sticking with, as the atmosphere does build; and, again, a nice pay off.",4,"Starts off iffy, but builds into a worthwhile ghost flick",1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,645,"['3.5', 'stars', 'pretty', 'iffy', 'like', 'ghost', 'stories', 'stick', 'slowly', 'more', 'interesting', 'Then', 'last', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'very', 'suddenly', 'whirlwind', 'revelations', 'make', 'wait', 'recommend', 'watch', 'closing', 'credits', 'actually', 'bring', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'add', 'overall', 'impact', 'One', 'major', 'shortcoming', 'unfortunate', 'lack', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'do', 'largely', 'uninspired', 'lighting', 'over', 'reliance', 'loud', 'whooshing', 'wind', 'effects', 'Nonetheless', 'worth', 'sticking', 'atmosphere', 'build', 'again', 'nice', 'pay', 'off']",The Unseeable

I think my problem with the movie was that it was meh... slow... but to be honest, I think it was a personal 'ick' on my part. The main character just can't seem to conquer more than one 'scared' face/position/emotion/anything until about ... eh... most of the film. Sadly, for me it was a deal-breaker. I've seen Thai horror and I own a couple that I love. This one was just... *sigh*... I'm the type that will hang in there the whole way. And I usually stick it out because I want to see the ending. However, I'm not so sure the interesting ending was worth the hour and something of watching. Now, had this been a short... could have been fantastic! Just cram all the important story lines and the ending, and we're good to go. Alas... a disappointment. I'm almost regretting giving this 3 stars... but hey... I'll grade on a curve with this movie.

1606166,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B00A704PG8,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[6, 7]","Nualjan, a young pregnant woman, has spent a year searching for her missing husband- without a single clue. Runjuan, a widow, eventually allows Nualjan to stay in her rural mansion. At this rural mansion, Nualjan begins to question Runjuan's motives, and begins to see ghostly figures. The Unseeable is an atmospheric, immensely creepy, and genuinely scary film.The story in this film is fantastic. It plays out like a classic ghost story- the ghost stories you're told as you grow up. In fact, Choy, a new friend of Nualjan, tells several spooky stories of the other residents and the terrifying figures she has seen on the mansion's grounds. It uses plenty of creepy imagery and spooky settings to create its horror atmosphere; it also uses amazing suspense to create some very effective jump scares to occasionally jolt the audience. The ending of the film is excellent, and wraps up perfectly - where many modern horror films fail, this film succeeds; it's similar to a certain film, but I won't mention it to avoid spoilers. It is very consistent, and the pacing is moderate. The music in this film is also amazing; some of this music gave off a ""Silent Hill"" (video game series) vibe. The acting was also great.Overall, The Unseeable is an exceptional horror film- it's consistently scary, very creepy, and dreadfully suspenseful leading up to its haunting ending.

Unfortunately, he disappears without a word and so Nualjan leaves home to try and find him. She arrives at an estate, needing rest, and is allowed to stay on by the caretaker, a stern older woman who runs things with an iron fist for her wealthy matron.

Losing faith in love altogether.&#8221;Wisit Sasanatieng, according to the Netflix description for Pen Choo Kab Pee, is one of Thailand's foremost directors. I was kind of skeptical when I dialed this one up (I didn't connect him with the lovely Tears of the Black Tiger until just now when I looked him up on IMDB in preparation for writing this review), and I knew very little about it; I came out of it somewhat stunned. You have seen this plot before, I can almost guarantee it, but Sasanatieng does it up so stylishly, and with such heart, that some very well-trod ground feels fresh, new, and above all exciting. This is what a love story should be.Plot: Nualjan (Where the Miracle Happens' Siraphan Wattanajinda) is pregnant and left in the lurch; her boyfriend Chob said he was off to Bangkok on business for a few days, but never returned. Nualjan leaves her small rural village in search of him. In her condition, however, she moves slowly and must stop to rest often. One of those stops is at a hostel in the middle of nowhere. The super, Ms. Somjit (The Coffin's Tassawan Seneewongse), is reluctant to let a soon-to-be unwed mother stay there, but she allows it on the condition that Nualjan stay away from the main house, the home of Madame Ranjuan (Suporntip Chuangrangsri in her only, to date, screen appearance), who has not been seen in public for some time now. Nualjan finds herself quickly bonding with another guest at the hostel, Choy (uncredited on IMDB, unfortunately, and the credits in the film are not subtitled). She soon starts wondering how it is that so many people at the inn know so much about her...Yeah, it's been done, and when you get to the Big Twist, you will probably have seen it coming for at least half the movie. That doesn't matter one little bit, because this one is all about the journey. Kongkiat Khomsiri's script is so well-paced and gorgeous that I find it hard to believe this is the same guy who wrote Art of the Devil II; my guess is that Sasanatieng, who got his start in the business as a screenwriter (working with his pal Nonzee Nimibutr, whose name you may know from Three...Extremes II), had, shall we say, a strong hand between the original draft and the finished product. I was thoroughly enchanted with this movie, and recommend it highly; check it out at your earliest opportunity. ****",4,"""What' worse than losing faith in the man you love?""

A young pregnant woman, Nual, takes a trishaw to an old mansion in a secluded place. Nual, who is looking for her missing husband, begs for shelter and with the help of the resident maid, Choy, is able to persuade the stern caretaker to allow her to stay at the house for a while. But Nual has to adhere to some strict conditions - not to snoop around the adjacent big house, not to go wandering about at night, and more.Before long, Nual makes some strange discoveries - there's a beautiful woman who lives in the big house but who shuns company, a strange little girl keeps asking her to play but then mysteriously disappears after leading Nual to an old antiques' room, and then there's the weird caretaker who always seems to pop-up out of nowhere only to scold Nual and warn her off.The pieces of the puzzle that is the story gradually fall into place, and it is only in the last half hour of the 1.5 hour film that viewers get the answers they seek. This reminds me of the more traditional-themed ghost stories commonly found in Southeast Asia revolving around restless spirits.
