1461146,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005HP2JHA,DVD Verdict,"[1, 2]","Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --Kidnapped is driven by its scenario, not its characters, which has its positives and its negatives. Writer/director Miguel &Aacute;ngel Vivas (Reflections) doesn't give the audience anything to go on and just drops them into the situation. The main characters are neither sympathetic nor hateable; there are no indications as to why these men have entered the home or, outside of money, what they hoped to achieve; there is basically no story to speak of at all. As much as those deficiencies might indicate failure, though, the film actually works rather well.Because it's a blank slate with very little story development, Kidnapped manages to steer clear of gimmicks. Sure, the family fights back, but nobody turns out to be massively strong, nobody jumps in to save them at the end, and nobody has some heretofore unknown skill that is perfect for just this situation. Horror has enough of all that, as it stands. Instead, the film goes into mostly realist territory, meaning that those with the best weapons and the most force are the ones who win, while those without are left to suffer punishment. That doesn't make for an especially heartwarming film, but I like the fact that it doesn't pretend that there's much hope for the victims.Of course, if there's no real story development and no redemption of the characters, it leads to the inevitable question of why somebody would want to watch in the first place. That's more difficult to answer, because there's a lingering feeling when watching any of the films in this realm that all I'm doing is watching wretched things happen to people. If they're token, though, discerning redeemable qualities in characters is utterly pointless and this isn't the kind of movie that abides much pointless activity. Outside of a very brief opening that brings up questions never to be answered, this is a no nonsense story. It gets in and gets out without explanation or excuse. If that means some unpleasant viewing or an irredeemable story, so be it, Kidnapped works. It's filmed without much style, but with a good look, and the performances are excellent across the board. It's mean, violent, and hard to watch; it doesn't set out to do a whole lot more than that, so how can I fault it for not giving me a completely satisfying, pretty picture of a resolution.From MPI and IFC Films, Kidnapped arrives in a decent package on DVD. The wide image is strong, with a strong, if not exceptional picture. Almost the entirety of the film takes place indoors, so its ability to shine is a little stunted, but it performs fairly well, with solid black levels and realistic flesh tones. The sound is similar, maybe a little better but, like the image transfer, there isn't a whole lot to tax the system. There is decent separation in the front and clear dialog, but very little comes through in the rear channels. That's fine, though, this isn't the kind of movie that needs a big, dynamic soundscape; it's full where it needs to be. Extras are left to a scant making-of piece and a couple of trailers, but technically, it's a fine disc.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Worth the time if you're willing to endure some mean-spirited violence,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,3135,"['Daryl', 'Loomis', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Kidnapped', 'driven', 'scenario', 'not', 'characters', 'positives', 'negatives', 'Writer/director', 'Miguel', 'Aacute', 'Vivas', 'Reflections', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'anything', 'go', 'just', 'drops', 'situation', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'hateable', 'are', 'indications', 'why', 'men', 'have', 'entered', 'home', 'money', 'what', 'hoped', 'achieve', 'basically', 'story', 'speak', 'As', 'much', 'deficiencies', 'might', 'indicate', 'failure', 'though', 'film', 'actually', 'rather', 'blank', 'slate', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'development', 'Kidnapped', 'steer', 'clear', 'gimmicks', 'Sure', 'family', 'fights', 'back', 'nobody', 'out', 'be', 'massively', 'strong', 'nobody', 'jumps', 'save', 'end', 'nobody', 'heretofore', 'unknown', 'skill', 'perfect', 'just', 'situation', 'Horror', 'enough', 'Instead', 'film', 'mostly', 'realist', 'territory', 'meaning', 'best', 'weapons', 'most', 'force', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'win', 'are', 'left', 'suffer', 'punishment', ""n't"", 'make', 'especially', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'like', 'fact', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'much', 'hope', 'victims.Of', 'course', 'real', 'story', 'development', 'redemption', 'characters', 'inevitable', 'question', 'why', 'somebody', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'place', 'more', 'difficult', 'answer', 'lingering', 'feeling', 'when', 'watching', 'films', 'realm', ""'m"", 'doing', 'watching', 'wretched', 'things', 'happen', 'people', ""'re"", 'token', 'though', 'discerning', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'characters', 'utterly', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'much', 'pointless', 'activity', 'very', 'brief', 'opening', 'up', 'questions', 'never', 'be', 'answered', 'nonsense', 'story', 'out', 'explanation', 'excuse', 'unpleasant', 'viewing', 'irredeemable', 'story', 'so', 'be', 'Kidnapped', 'filmed', 'much', 'style', 'good', 'look', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'board', 'mean', 'violent', 'hard', 'watch', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'how', 'can', 'fault', 'not', 'giving', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'pretty', 'picture', 'resolution.From', 'MPI', 'IFC', 'Films', 'Kidnapped', 'decent', 'package', 'DVD', 'wide', 'image', 'strong', 'strong', 'not', 'exceptional', 'picture', 'entirety', 'film', 'place', 'indoors', 'ability', 'shine', 'little', 'stunted', 'fairly', 'well', 'solid', 'black', 'levels', 'realistic', 'flesh', 'tones', 'sound', 'similar', 'maybe', 'little', 'better', 'image', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'tax', 'system', 'decent', 'separation', 'front', 'clear', 'dialog', 'very', 'little', 'rear', 'channels', 'fine', 'though', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'big', 'dynamic', 'soundscape', 'full', 'where', 'be', 'Extras', 'are', 'left', 'scant', 'making-of', 'piece', 'couple', 'trailers', 'technically', 'fine', 'disc.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Kidnapped
1461147,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B005HP2JHA,Eric Sanberg,"[4, 6]","There is a certain deftness in the handling of this violent thriller but, at the end of the day, the story is unremarkable.Here's the scoop. A husband, wife and teenaged daughter move into a a very upscale house in a Madrid suburb. Their first night three men break into the house and take them hostage. They're going to fleece the place and get dad to take as much money out of the ATM as possible and then the bank the following day. Things go wrong.This is directed well. I did feel as though I were witnessing something. There was a naturalness to the directing that made me feel as though I were there. Some commented on the extreme violence but to me, it wasn't until the last 90 seconds or so that I really felt uncomfortable. During much of it the violence was fairly run of the mill. The story itself was pedestrian. The bad guys come. They overact to make everyone frightened. But, of course, unexpected things happen and they need to adapt. Nothing really happens that you might not have already seen in other similar movies. The near escapes. The missteps by the hostages that , once failed, make the hostages plead for their lives. This isn't new. There is some hope and some good things happen for the hostages. But then the end comes and it really made me want to spit. This film doesn't end. It stops. And it stops in the ugliest way possible.This is a solid effort. It is handled well and it's worth the time to view it.

1461150,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B005HP2JHA,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[3, 4]","I found this movie to be quite well done. It's a very realistic and very sadistic film that has about the most unhappy ending I think I have ever seen. In fact the ending is about as depraved and despicable at you can imagine. A lot of people complained about the dubbing, which was actually done about as good as it can possibly get. Any time dubbing is involved it's incredibly difficult to make it match up without getting rather laughable results. But here though the dubbing seems sometimes pathetic, it's done about as respectfully as is humanly possible. As far as dubbing goes this was one of the better attempts at it. So I was able to accept it for what it was. That aside this film is fairly believable and very entertaining, even though the end result is very unforgiving and depraved. This film lies somewhere between 'Last House On The Left' and 'In Cold Blood'. The victims of a home invasion robbery in this film are treated sadistically and unflinchingly. The audience can hope all it wants, but the end result delivers some very heartbreaking and brutally honest reality. Things like this unfortunately happen in real life once in awhile. Life is sometimes all too hopeless in situations such as this. Sometimes hope and the will to live are not respected enough, and people suffer and die anyway. In the meantime, however sad and bleak this story might be, what lies in between is some of the most horrifying film making I have seen in a long time. I think this film. while brutally frank and despicable in it's subject matter, is superbly executed and powerfully presented.

1461152,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005HP2JHA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","In a Spanish thriller ""Kidnapped"" (original title ""Secuestrados""), an ordinary middle-to-upper class family - a married couple and their teenage daughter - is attacked and taken hostage by three masked burglars in their new home within a gated community. Unlike ""Funny Games"" (original or remake), in which one character breaks the conventions of the horror genre, ""Kidnapped"" aims for realism with a simpler approach to the material.That works to some extent. The home invasion movie is violent and relentless, with more graphic descriptions of violence than in Michael Haneke's films. However, while the moments of raw and brutal violence shot with a shaky hand-held camera is disturbing enough, the film's stock characters (criminals or victims), who keep doing things totally unnecessary do not convince, making the already thin story longer than necessary.This is a sophomore work from Miguel &Aacute;ngel Vivas. He directs the film with confidence and his visual skills (with one Brian De Palma-like split screen) are pretty impressive. His talent as a director is undeniable, but the 85 minute film, competently-shot and well-acted as it is, heavily suffers from countless clich&eacute;s that are barely tolerable.""Kidnapped"" shows you that something terrible can happen in the place that should be the safest in the world - something that most people interested in this kind of film know even before seeing it.",3,Crime and Realism: Solid but Breaks No Ground,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,1418,"['Spanish', 'thriller', 'Kidnapped', 'original', 'title', 'Secuestrados', 'ordinary', 'middle-to-upper', 'class', 'family', 'married', 'couple', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'attacked', 'taken', 'hostage', 'three', 'masked', 'burglars', 'new', 'home', 'gated', 'community', 'Funny', 'Games', 'original', 'remake', 'one', 'character', 'conventions', 'horror', 'genre', 'Kidnapped', 'realism', 'simpler', 'approach', 'material.That', 'extent', 'home', 'invasion', 'movie', 'violent', 'relentless', 'more', 'graphic', 'descriptions', 'violence', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'films', 'However', 'moments', 'raw', 'brutal', 'violence', 'shot', 'shaky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'film', 'stock', 'characters', 'criminals', 'victims', 'who', 'keep', 'doing', 'things', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'do', 'not', 'convince', 'making', 'already', 'thin', 'story', 'longer', 'necessary.This', 'sophomore', 'work', 'Miguel', 'Aacute', 'ngel', 'Vivas', 'film', 'confidence', 'visual', 'skills', 'one', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma-like', 'split', 'screen', 'are', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'talent', 'director', 'undeniable', '85', 'minute', 'film', 'competently-shot', 'well-acted', 'heavily', 'suffers', 'countless', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'Kidnapped', 'something', 'terrible', 'can', 'happen', 'place', 'should', 'be', 'safest', 'world', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'interested', 'kind', 'film', 'know', 'even', 'seeing']",Kidnapped
