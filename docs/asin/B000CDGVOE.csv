The U.S. dub is surprisingly well done. I would recommend watching this film at least twice before deciding how you feel about it. Myself and a couple of the people I've made watch it were not very impressed the first time we saw it, but we watched it again and picked up more of it, which completely changed our minds(so much so that I couldn't stand not having it as part of my movie collection)!",5,This is a movie you'll watch over and over again.,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,541,"['usual', 'Miyazaki', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Dianna', 'Wynn', 'Jones', 'story', 'tee', 'still', 'excellent', 'moving', 'film', 'U.S.', 'dub', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'least', 'twice', 'before', 'deciding', 'how', 'feel', 'couple', 'people', ""'ve"", 'made', 'watch', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'impressed', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'watched', 'again', 'picked', 'up', 'more', 'completely', 'changed', 'minds', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'not', 'having', 'part', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A

The animation alone is reason enough to love it, creating beautiful cinematography only Hayao Miyazaki really, is capable of.  I think that the actors they chose to voice the characters is excellent.  I love hearing Christian Bale's voice as my beloved Howl.But, on top of that, there was some disappointment that the film departed so much from the book.  The characters of Howl and Sophie are much more noble in the film than in the book.  They make the Witch of the Waste into a 'good guy' at the end, and Soloman is changed from a male to a female and kind of bad.  They leave out Sophie's sisters and the fact that Howl is really from England.  They change Michael from a teenage apprentice into a little boy named Markl and make Calcifer into a more goofy character (who's voice is miscast as Billy Crystal, the only real problem I had with the 'vocal talent').  In the end they actually destroy the castle after Calcifer is freed (and turned into the 'comedic relief') and close the tale with Sophie and Howl together (as in the book), but because of the changes in doesn't give much hope for the following 2 sequels that came after the first book (Castle in the Air and House of Many Ways).I liked this movie, but the book is better by far.",4,"A Longtime Favorite, but not at all like the book",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1266,"['love', 'film', 'animation', 'alone', 'reason', 'enough', 'love', 'creating', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'only', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'really', 'capable', 'think', 'actors', 'chose', 'voice', 'characters', 'excellent', 'love', 'hearing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'voice', 'beloved', 'Howl.But', 'top', 'was', 'disappointment', 'film', 'departed', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'characters', 'Howl', 'Sophie', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'noble', 'film', 'book', 'make', 'Witch', 'Waste', ""'good"", 'guy', 'end', 'Soloman', 'changed', 'male', 'female', 'kind', 'bad', 'leave', 'out', 'Sophie', 'sisters', 'fact', 'Howl', 'really', 'England', 'change', 'Michael', 'teenage', 'apprentice', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Markl', 'make', 'Calcifer', 'more', 'goofy', 'character', 'who', 'voice', 'miscast', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'had', ""'vocal"", 'talent', 'end', 'actually', 'destroy', 'castle', 'Calcifer', 'freed', 'turned', ""'comedic"", 'relief', 'close', 'tale', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'together', 'book', 'changes', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'hope', 'following', '2', 'sequels', 'came', 'first', 'book', 'Castle', 'Air', 'House', 'Many', 'Ways', '.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'book', 'better', 'far']",N/A

956962,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000CDGVOE,Alex Udvary,"[10, 11]","First let me explain something about myself. I have been an ardent critic of animation. For years I thought animation simply could not cross over to adults. The story-lines, the characters, they were far too simplistic. Then I started to watch the Pixar movies like ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and I enjoyed them to my amazement. Then one day I saw Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" after Roger Ebert placed it on his ""top ten"" list of 2002. I was blown away. For as much as I enjoyed the Disney pictures they were a little too cute. Sure we come to feel for the toys and fish involved in the stories but they always remain ""cartoon characters"" Miyazaki on the other hand creates ""characters"" they are people. We as an audience can relate to them. They are complex, compelling people. They are motive by the same emotions we are. I honestly feel, and I don't say this as idle praise, Miyazki creates films that are not intended for children. He creates animation that is really designed for adults. Only adults will be fully capable of understanding what his films are about. The stories are not silly children fables. Children in fact may have a hard time sitting through one of his films.Lets take for example Hayao Miyazki's lastest animation masterpiece ""Howl's Moving Castle"". It is the greatest animated film I have ever seen. It is better than any of the previous films I have seen by this master. And I have only seen a few. They include ""Spirired Away"", ""Porco Rosso"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"". But it is also better than anything Disney has ever made. Why? Here we have a movie that truly transports us to another world. As I sat and watched the town and the landscapes created for this film it took my breathe away. I know that my sound cliche, but read some of my other reviews, I've never said that about any other film. Here is a movie that I thought was more visually dazzling than all of the ""Star Wars"" movies, all the ""Lord of the Ring"" movies and the entire ""Harry Potter"" series combined.""Castle"" is about a teenage girl named Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer) who works in her late father's hat shop. One day a witch, the witch of waste (Lauren Bacall) puts a curse on Sophie turing her into a 90 year old woman (now she is voiced by Jean Simmons). This happens though before she unknowingly meets Howl (Christian Bale) a wizard who literally sweeps her off her feet. When turned into the old woman Sophie decides she can not work in the hat shop any longer and must move away from her family until the curse is taken off.Now meanwhile there is a war going on and here Miyazaki starts to make a social commentary on the meanlessness of war. But the story is also about the wisdom that comes with age. Now that Sophie is older, and no longer a figure of lust to men, she is now more assertive and men do not take advantage of her.Wait until you see the British town Miyazaki has created. I'm simply left speechless by it all. All I can say is it's magical. And I realize that doesn't help you much. But pay attention to the close details Miyazaki creates. There were moments when I could have sworn some of the objects in the film appeared real, things such as doors, hats, rails, and flowers.Supposedly the movie will be released in a subtitled version, I saw the English version, but I didn't mind. I think Disney has done a great job dubbing all of Miyazaki's films. In fact I prefer to watch them in English. I do not however feel the same way about live action films. There usually the dubbing is distracting.""Howl's Moving Castle"" is one of the best movies of 2005. A touching, intelligent masterpiece that adults should love. The characters seem real and we can understand who they are and why they do what they do. I should at this point however talk about some of the film's flaws. Why was the curse put on Sophie? What happens to her family by the end of the movie? And how exactly does the curse wear off? But besides all of this you should really see the movie for the wonderful visuals. Never again will I put aside animation as merely ""kid's stuff"" I now realize it is the stuff of dreams.Botton-line: The greatest animated movie I have ever seen.

956972,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000CDGVOE,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","The action of Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated effort takes place in an undetermined country and age, though it looks like the late 19th century (allowing for a number of anachronistic details) in a Central European kingdom (the Austro Hungarian empire of the time seems the country where the action takes place, and the book happens in a place called Ingary, though this empire has a large port by the sea, which the Austro Hungarian empire didn't). The storyline starts with a young woman called Sophie working in a hat factory turned into a 90 year woman through a curse by some witch. She then tries to meet the wizard Howl, to see if he can helped her. As it would be later clear in the movie, Howl faces some curses of its own. The story soon becomes very convoluted, almost impossible to follow it wholly in just one sighting. After a while, you give up on understanding everything that is going on, and concentrate on enjoying its vivid details (Howl's melting of sadness is probably my favorite scene). What I found most engaging about the movie, rather than certain aspects of the plot, is its background details, which betrays Miyazaki's love for victorian fantasy. I haven't read the original book, I know some people who had has taken issue with Miyazaki's liberties with the plot, but as it is, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even if the ending is a bit heavy handed in its endorsement of pacifism and environmentalism.",4,Miyazaki's convoluted tale is lovely in its details,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1443,"['action', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'latest', 'animated', 'effort', 'place', 'undetermined', 'country', 'age', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'allowing', 'number', 'anachronistic', 'details', 'Central', 'European', 'kingdom', 'Austro', 'Hungarian', 'empire', 'time', 'country', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'book', 'place', 'called', 'Ingary', 'empire', 'large', 'port', 'sea', 'Austro', 'Hungarian', 'empire', 'did', ""n't"", 'storyline', 'young', 'woman', 'called', 'Sophie', 'working', 'hat', 'factory', 'turned', '90', 'year', 'woman', 'curse', 'witch', 'then', 'meet', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'see', 'can', 'helped', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'clear', 'movie', 'Howl', 'curses', 'own', 'story', 'soon', 'very', 'convoluted', 'almost', 'impossible', 'follow', 'wholly', 'just', 'one', 'sighting', 'while', 'give', 'up', 'understanding', 'everything', 'going', 'concentrate', 'enjoying', 'vivid', 'details', 'Howl', 'melting', 'sadness', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'engaging', 'movie', 'rather', 'certain', 'aspects', 'plot', 'background', 'details', 'Miyazaki', 'love', 'victorian', 'fantasy', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'book', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'issue', 'Miyazaki', 'liberties', 'plot', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'even', 'ending', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'endorsement', 'pacifism', 'environmentalism']",N/A
956973,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000CDGVOE,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 3]","This film marks my first experience with true anime (what I mean by that is that the only other anime I've seen has been old Pokemon and Sailor Moon cartoons that my sister used to watch).  Until this, I had dismissed anime as stupid, cheap, and bizarre.  Well, it turns out that I was right about the bizarre part, but who says that bizarre is a bad thing.  And this was nowhere near cheap or stupid.The story centers around a young girl named Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Jean Simmons), a cute hatter who believes her life isn't going to be exciting and that she isn't worthy of any man.  Yet, one day, a handsome, mysterious man rescues her from some soldiers who try to rape her.  It turns out that the man is Howl (Christian Bale), a wizard who lives in a grand castle that is on legs, and can move.  Unfortunately, this attention causes the evil Witch of the Wastes (Lauren Bacall) to become jealous, and casts a spell on Sophie that puts her in the body of a 90-year-old woman.  In an effort to break the curse and avoid shame, she runs away to Howl's castle.  There she meets Howl's young apprentice Markyl (Josh Hutcherson), Calcifer the Fire Demon (Billy Crystal in all of his glory), who powers the castle, and a mysterious scarecrow whom Sophie dubs ""Turnip-Head"".  Together the group forms family bonds while trying to avoid a meaningless war with a neighboring nation.The story is fine, but there were a few times when I was just plain lost.  However, the animation is top-notch.  The style of the world that the characters live in is amazing too.  I really like the idea of futuristic machines (such as grand naval warships and flying gunships) that are steam-powered and set in a Victorian setting.All-in-all, I did enjoy this movie, but it isn't anything that I have to rush out and see again.

This one isn't an exception, it's a good anime film with wonderful art, animation and an imagination beyond limits. But although I love Miyazaki's work, this isn't one of his best works.For fleshing out his story he would need at least more half an hour of animation, there are too many loose ends or unexplained events in this film, and it deviates so much from the original novel that it's only very loosely based on it (and I sincerely think that it should be made that remark at the beginning or end of the movie).Compared with princess mononoke's characters, Sophie, Howl, Suliman or the Witch of the Waste are completely bi-dimensional! For example the Witch curses Sophie with a terribly monstrous curse with absolutely no reason (if she wanted a spy there would be millions of easier ways) and next time they meet they are almost friendly, Sophie asks her to remove the curse; the witch says she can't; then O.K. no big deal, let's help the poor overweight woman!!!! There is no consequence for the actions  formerly made. Also the Deux ex machina is quite abusive; especially the way Sophie finds Howls Castle.Many loose ends, if worked on, could had created a marvellous story. For example, Howl avoids at all costs being involved in the war, but for some unexplained reason he is always flying over the battlefields; this could lead to an excellent side plot but remains unexplored.It is a truly simple story, and very nice and uplifting tale; the image backgrounds are astonishing and the XIX century look mixed with magic and science is fantastic. But there is a lack of character motivations, too many coincidences, everybody is so simple, so good natured, everything can be worked out with a simple phrase ""lets be friends"" or a smile (from selling the soul, to loosing 60 years of life, almost being killed or ending a war!)...I believe you should watch this tale and be awed with the art, but not expecting a great story or unforgettable characters.",3,Simple but elegant tale with fantastic art,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2108,"['Miyazaki', 'probably', 'greatest', 'anime', 'director', 'ever', 'point', 'taken', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'always', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'works', 'one', ""n't"", 'exception', 'good', 'anime', 'film', 'wonderful', 'art', 'animation', 'imagination', 'limits', 'love', 'Miyazaki', 'work', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'works.For', 'fleshing', 'out', 'story', 'would', 'need', 'least', 'more', 'hour', 'animation', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'unexplained', 'events', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'novel', 'only', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'sincerely', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'remark', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', '.Compared', 'princess', 'mononoke', 'characters', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'Suliman', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'are', 'completely', 'bi-dimensional', 'example', 'Witch', 'Sophie', 'terribly', 'monstrous', 'curse', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'wanted', 'spy', 'would', 'be', 'millions', 'easier', 'ways', 'next', 'time', 'meet', 'are', 'almost', 'friendly', 'Sophie', 'remove', 'curse', 'witch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'then', 'O.K', 'big', 'deal', 'let', 'help', 'poor', 'overweight', 'woman', 'consequence', 'actions', 'formerly', 'made', 'Also', 'Deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'quite', 'abusive', 'especially', 'way', 'Sophie', 'Howls', 'Castle.Many', 'loose', 'ends', 'worked', 'could', 'had', 'created', 'marvellous', 'story', 'example', 'Howl', 'avoids', 'costs', 'being', 'involved', 'war', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'always', 'flying', 'battlefields', 'could', 'lead', 'excellent', 'side', 'plot', 'unexplored.It', 'truly', 'simple', 'story', 'very', 'nice', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'image', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'astonishing', 'XIX', 'century', 'look', 'mixed', 'magic', 'science', 'fantastic', 'lack', 'character', 'motivations', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'everybody', 'so', 'simple', 'so', 'good', 'natured', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'simple', 'phrase', 'be', 'friends', 'smile', 'selling', 'soul', 'loosing', '60', 'years', 'life', 'almost', 'being', 'killed', 'ending', 'war', 'believe', 'should', 'watch', 'tale', 'be', 'awed', 'art', 'not', 'expecting', 'great', 'story', 'unforgettable', 'characters']",N/A
956975,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000CDGVOE,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 1]","Now, to further explain my title, I will say that Howl's Moving Castle isn't Miyazaki's best. In fact, in many ways it's his most disappointing because he got his ideas from another person's work. But, as you watch, you can still feel all those spectacular Miyazaki touches that he puts into all of his movies, and those are the beauty of the art, the common themes and morals, and the strange style of story telling. It's that style of story-telling that I think makes Miyazaki so great. Just as in Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa, Howl's Moving Castle presents a conflict, but it's more of a world-wide kind of thing with no definable antagonist. It's an odd feeling, watching a movie where you know that you can and probably will cheer for each and every one of the characters while they attempt to solve their own personal problems as well as the external conflict. During all of this, the common themes of love, friendship, and loyalty spur the characters on.As for the story in Howl's Moving Castle, it follows a young girl named Sophie who's just used to accepting what life's given her. But when a witch comes to her small hat shop, Sophie is cursed and changes from a young, regular girl to an old, head-strong woman. She sets out to find a way to fix her curse. During her journey, Sophie encounters a strange scarecrow that eventually leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. It's here that Sophie finds a purpose, and journeys with Howl, his fire-demon Calcifer, and Howl's apprentice Markl, as they attempt to stop an ongoing war between two kingdoms as well finding solutions to there own problems and curses.Like all of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films, Howl's Moving Castle sports some of the best visuals off its time, and truly sets another industry standard both for storytelling and art. Too add, it has a great musical score to the carry the emotion of the scenes. Disney also did a wonderful job with the translation and provided a top notch cast of voice-actors, including Christian Bale (Batman Begins) and Billy Crystal. This is truly an anime stand-out. I'd recommend this to both anime films and film lovers of all kinds.

Since when has life been simple to just show us or lead us to believe that if you are in love nothing else goes on in the world?To those that are in love I'm sure nothing else would matter.  The war itself in this film is almost synonymous with Howl's irresponsibility.  The fact that they have chosen to fight without chance of talks and without regard of life from either side is highly irresponsible.In the end Howl learns to not run away and to stand forth.  Such is when he is vulnerable but willing to take a chance at giving his heart to someone else.  To Sophie.  And in the end give chance to make the rest of the world right.I can't think of any other films that really make me feel as much as I do when I watch Miyazaki's films.Howl is no exception.  The amazing visuals, the colours, the vibrance, the characters are always memorable, and you fall in love with them always even the bad ones.  And the music!  You feel as though you are indeed a part of this world and trying hard not to fall out of your seat.Though the english cast is all star, I myself prefer the Japanese voice actors as they're voices sound great, regardless if you can't understand them.  I do believe Billy Crystal was miscast as Calcifer.  Watch it with subs first then turn on the dubs.  You'll know what I mean.  But for the rest, Sophie has a soft, sweet, and beautiful voice, Lauren Bacall plays a wonderfully malicious Witch of the Waste, and Christian Bale plays a decent Howl, though for the mannerisms and dialogue I would expect someone younger to voice him.All in all, it's definitely one of his top films, and possibly my favourite.  I still love Chihiro just as much, same with Mononoke, but this will always be sitting right next them in terms of beauty, artistry, and story.

Where magic and a bombed-out war clash. That's the setting of Howl's Moving Castle in a nutshell; a town where a war is starting, with all the celebrations that are mistakenly attributed to such an event. In the midst of this is Sophie, an insecure girl who whiles away her days working in her father's hat shop. But life has no intention of letting her waste her life there. A quick visit from the Witch of the Waste leaves Sophie cursed in the form of an aged woman. She has no choice but to leave the town unseen and happens upon the moving, dangerously-unstably-constructed castle of the renowned but vain magician Howl. Adopting the role of his maid, Sophie becomes a permanent fixture in his household. With the help of her friends - including Howl's apprentice Markl and the silent but enthusiastic Scarecrow - Sophie sets out to find a way to break the curse on her. However, her quest takes a quite unexpected direction when she discovers more about Howl and just how he got the fire demon Calcifer to move the castle in the first place.This is Myazaki's first film based on another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service and he stays faithful to the setting, which has a local charm that takes you back to 1880s Europe. The CG castle in the title is such a random structure, it's a wonder it doesn't collapse. Beautiful vistas are everywhere and the use of colour is high as is the trademark of the Ghibli films. The characters are also very entertaining, especially the fire demon Calcifer, whom only Sophie seems to be able to manipulate apart from Howl.It may not be an original Myazaki concept, but in his hands the world of Howl and his moving castle is fascinating. Like Spirited Away, the story takes an unexpected but satisfactory turn for the audience and the resolve is never 'go from point A to point B'. It's deeper and more profound, and this difficult feat is well-presented to the audience.

I knew it was based off a book by Dianna Wynne Jones, and this was a book that I really wanted to read. I didn't think I would get to read anytime soon, though, so I settled for the movie.I LOVED it!

There's just so many details that I feel I've missed out on. And the ending....it is so incredibly rushed, I'm somewhat mad. So rushed, that it's almost corny! And yet, I still loved it!!

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[12, 30]","Having little experience in the Anime realm, I have to admit I'm probably not the most knowledgeable reviewer to examine a film such as this. But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of ""the heart"", a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story!There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie.

Her life in the hat shop is closed off, and restraining her potential, but she gets an opportunity to go out into the world after she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste. Her only hope to get rid of this curse is to get help from the frightening Wizard Howl who eats girl's hearts.As in all Studio Ghibli films, the scenery is magnificent and Miyazaki portrays many different types of places such as busy cities, lone country side, and the deserted Waste. What I most enjoyed from this film is the themes that it has. As the eldest child, Sophie thinks of others, and has low confidence in herself and her looks, but upon meeting Howl and becoming entangled in a magical battle, she gains courage and grows to love herself and Howl as well. Another theme portrayed is that of not running away from the past. In order for Howl to truly be free, he has to stop running away and face his curse. Howl and Sophie, both cursed must find a solution to be as they once were and in doing that, they become happier and even stronger than before. Both previously been lost and doubting themselves, they become whole and like two halves, they come together in one of the most heart-pounding Studio Ghibli romance stories ever!I love this film, that I cannot tell you how many times I have seen it.

956995,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000CDGVOE,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[8, 27]","In Hayao Miyazaki's newest disaster we follow a young girl named Sophie as she is turned into a 90 year old woman, falls in love with a prima donna named Howl, and travels the country side in a castle that has legs and walks like a spider. Now sure, this could be material for a great movie, but a great movie this ain't. Miyazaki seems to be exploring the journey that is growing old, and he seems to be having trouble with it. As the film opens Sophie is changed into a 90 year old witch. Considering Sophie's life plan was to work in her father's hat factory this seems to be some sort of shot at young people who don't live life to the fullest. But doesn't somebody have to make hats, just like somebody has to pick strawberries, and just like somebody has to scrub floors. We can't all be animators, and perhaps Sophie wasn't built for a life of adventure. In ""Spirited Away"" we saw gluttonous parents turned into pigs while overindulging in a meal, so apparently in Miyazaki's world you are whatever you act like. Sophie, understandably so, is terrified by this turn of events and kids everywhere learn that being old is a bad bad thing. Of course, as the movie progresses Sophie lists things that are good about being old. I took these musings as Miyazaki trying to convince himself that being old does have its advantages.Sophie soon joins up with Howl, his castle, and his band of misfits. I'm not sure why we needed a movie about a walking castle, but here it is. And speaking of that castle, it really is something only an illustrator would dream up. Think gigantic pile of trash, with legs, and really ""castle"" only in name. At this point in the film (30 minutes in or so) the wheels really come off this particular pile of trash. We have war and different dimensions and large mechanic birds who drop bombs and a talking flame. Sophie herself is unable to make a commitment to her age as sometimes she is ancient, other times just old, and still other times she looks 16 with grey hair. Worse yet her transformations seem willy nilly, sometimes happening in the middle of scenes. The highlight of this film is the animation, but unfortunately that is only one aspect of a film. Miyazaki forgot to include a comprehensible story (and if I had no chance what chance do the kids have?), and characters, and music. He would have been much better off placing these drawings in a gallery somewhere, there at least people would expect any context. The scene in which the city is fire bombed and completely overcome with flames was my personal favorite.More than anything I just felt that this film made a case against giving directors too much creative power (and this is the first movie that I would have ever said that about). What this film really needed was for some corporate hack to come in and smooth out the rough edges because for most of this film I was left wishing that my room could just sprout legs and move to a cheaper neighborhood.2 out of 5",2,Skip This Nonsense,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,2964,"['Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'newest', 'disaster', 'follow', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Sophie', 'turned', '90', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'love', 'prima', 'donna', 'named', 'Howl', 'country', 'side', 'castle', 'legs', 'walks', 'spider', 'Now', 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'material', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Miyazaki', 'be', 'exploring', 'journey', 'growing', 'old', 'be', 'having', 'trouble', 'film', 'Sophie', 'changed', '90', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'Considering', 'Sophie', 'life', 'plan', 'was', 'work', 'father', 'hat', 'factory', 'be', 'sort', 'shot', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'life', 'fullest', ""n't"", 'somebody', 'have', 'make', 'hats', 'just', 'somebody', 'pick', 'strawberries', 'just', 'somebody', 'scrub', 'floors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'animators', 'perhaps', 'Sophie', 'was', ""n't"", 'built', 'life', 'adventure', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'saw', 'gluttonous', 'parents', 'turned', 'pigs', 'overindulging', 'meal', 'so', 'apparently', 'Miyazaki', 'world', 'are', 'act', 'Sophie', 'understandably', 'so', 'terrified', 'turn', 'events', 'kids', 'everywhere', 'learn', 'being', 'old', 'bad', 'bad', 'thing', 'course', 'movie', 'Sophie', 'lists', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'being', 'old', 'took', 'musings', 'Miyazaki', 'trying', 'convince', 'being', 'old', 'have', 'advantages.Sophie', 'soon', 'up', 'Howl', 'castle', 'band', 'misfits', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'needed', 'movie', 'walking', 'castle', 'here', 'speaking', 'castle', 'really', 'something', 'only', 'illustrator', 'would', 'dream', 'up', 'Think', 'gigantic', 'pile', 'trash', 'legs', 'really', 'castle', 'only', 'name', 'point', 'film', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'wheels', 'really', 'come', 'off', 'particular', 'pile', 'trash', 'have', 'war', 'different', 'dimensions', 'large', 'mechanic', 'birds', 'who', 'drop', 'bombs', 'talking', 'flame', 'Sophie', 'unable', 'make', 'commitment', 'age', 'sometimes', 'ancient', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'old', 'still', 'other', 'times', '16', 'grey', 'hair', 'Worse', 'yet', 'transformations', 'seem', 'willy', 'nilly', 'sometimes', 'happening', 'middle', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'film', 'animation', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'Miyazaki', 'forgot', 'include', 'comprehensible', 'story', 'had', 'chance', 'what', 'chance', 'do', 'kids', 'have', 'characters', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'placing', 'drawings', 'gallery', 'somewhere', 'least', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'context', 'scene', 'city', 'fire', 'bombed', 'completely', 'overcome', 'flames', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite.More', 'anything', 'just', 'felt', 'film', 'made', 'case', 'giving', 'directors', 'too', 'much', 'creative', 'power', 'first', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'said', 'What', 'film', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'corporate', 'hack', 'come', 'smooth', 'out', 'rough', 'edges', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'wishing', 'room', 'could', 'just', 'sprout', 'legs', 'move', 'cheaper', 'neighborhood.2', '5']",N/A

Knowing what works and what doesn't, they eventually will start to settle into that comfort zone where the films are really great, although they may not be as innovative. With Miyazaki you'll always find great animation and a really imaginative world but certain flaws that existed before still exist now. While it probably won't beat Totoro or Spirited Away as the better film, it's certainly an enjoyable film to watch.Young Sophie works at a hat shop and feels like she isn't beautiful. She has a chance encounter with a likable man with some magical powers. Later on, she has an unfortunate meeting with the Witch of the Waste(wish I wasn't kidding about the name) which turns her into an old woman. Looking for a way to break the spell, she runs into a big castle with legs, run by a kid named Markl and a fire demon that runs the castle. The master of the place is the man she met earlier, a wizard named Howl. Will Sophie break the spell?Like I said about certain things getting perfected, this film is probably some of the best animation that Studio Ghibli has done. The colors are so vivid, sharp and colorful and one scene involving a flower garden late in the film was quite striking. And unlike other releases, the CG never becomes obvious where you can easily tell where it took over. It's of course got the weird characters and neat concepts and what more would you want?Well, maybe a better written plot? The premise is great, it's just the execution falls apart slightly. Certain elements are never explained and we seem to jump from one thing to the next. The other problem is what plagued other Miyazaki films: it's a bit too long. Now one of my favorite films is JFK, 3 hour 15 at least in the Director's Cut and I didn't even minded however Howl clocks in at a few minutes shy of 2 hours and it feels like certain things could've been chopped off(one weird subplot involving Howl's hair just seems completely out of place and unnecessary).If you've had Miyazaki films before, you know how skimpy they are on extras(then again, what anime film isn't?) It's disappointing but at the same time the film does speak for itself but considering the guys at Pixar are huge Miyazaki fans, you would maybe thought they'd record a commentary on his film, making comments about the story and animation etc.It's certainly a recommendable film but if this is your first, well go for Totoro or Spirited Away but if you're already a fan, must give this a go.",5,Enjoyable and imaginative but has its problems,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2544,"['studios', 'directors', 'sometimes', 'awhile', 'perfect', 'formula', 'Knowing', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'will', 'start', 'settle', 'comfort', 'zone', 'where', 'films', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'innovative', 'Miyazaki', ""'ll"", 'always', 'find', 'great', 'animation', 'really', 'imaginative', 'world', 'certain', 'flaws', 'existed', 'still', 'exist', 'now', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'better', 'film', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch.Young', 'Sophie', 'works', 'hat', 'shop', 'feels', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'chance', 'encounter', 'likable', 'man', 'magical', 'powers', 'Later', 'unfortunate', 'meeting', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'name', 'old', 'woman', 'Looking', 'way', 'break', 'spell', 'big', 'castle', 'legs', 'run', 'kid', 'named', 'Markl', 'fire', 'demon', 'castle', 'master', 'place', 'man', 'met', 'earlier', 'wizard', 'named', 'Howl', 'Will', 'Sophie', 'break', 'spell', 'said', 'about', 'certain', 'things', 'getting', 'perfected', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'animation', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'done', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'vivid', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'flower', 'garden', 'late', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'striking', 'other', 'releases', 'CG', 'never', 'obvious', 'where', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'where', 'took', 'over', 'course', 'got', 'weird', 'characters', 'neat', 'concepts', 'what', 'more', 'would', 'want', 'Well', 'maybe', 'better', 'written', 'plot', 'premise', 'great', 'just', 'execution', 'apart', 'slightly', 'Certain', 'elements', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'seem', 'jump', 'one', 'thing', 'next', 'other', 'problem', 'what', 'plagued', 'other', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Now', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'JFK', '3', 'hour', '15', 'least', 'Director', 'Cut', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'minded', 'however', 'Howl', 'clocks', 'few', 'minutes', 'shy', '2', 'hours', 'certain', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'chopped', 'off', 'one', 'weird', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Howl', 'hair', 'just', 'completely', 'place', 'unnecessary', '.If', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'know', 'how', 'skimpy', 'are', 'extras', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'anime', 'film', ""n't"", 'disappointing', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'speak', 'considering', 'guys', 'Pixar', 'are', 'huge', 'Miyazaki', 'fans', 'would', 'maybe', 'thought', ""'d"", 'record', 'commentary', 'film', 'making', 'comments', 'story', 'animation', 'etc.It', 'certainly', 'recommendable', 'film', 'first', 'well', 'go', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'Away', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'must', 'give', 'go']",N/A

956999,A3UR9M6DLAXTU7,B000CDGVOE,Colby,"[7, 7]","Howl's Moving Castle is Hayao Miyazaki's most elegant piece of work, both in texture and in scope. Yes, its my personal favorite film from Miyazaki (though many of his others have stolen my heart) but I will try to write an unbiased review as best I can.I put my blu-ray copy of Howl's Moving Castle in and settled down for 2 hours, ready to experience the film in 1080p HD and DTS HD 5.1 Master Audio.Yes, the film looks and sounds unbelievably good...but strangely, those aspects aren't what ultimately caught my eye.Instead, I noticed something I had never noticed before: the film itself.Viewing this film on blu-ray, I was suddenly aware of the elegance found in each frame. Each location, each set-piece, each house, each texture, its all been expertly crafted and drawn. The streets, the hills, the castle itself...they're all real places. They actually exist, somewhere far away. It literally took my breath away.The characters are drawn in typical Miyazaki fashion, but everything else has been painstakingly created and is MIND BLOWING in 1080p HD. I'm not exaggerating when I say Howl's Moving Castle is an entirely new film on the blu-ray format.Many times I simply paused the film and reveled in the beauty of each frozen frame. I would gladly hang some of these scenes on a wall.Miyazaki has crafted his finest film here, in terms of animation and the wonders found within that. Ponyo looks gorgeous, Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke are brilliantly animated too. In fact, most if not all the Ghibli films boast great animation. But nothing can beat Howl's Moving Castle. In EVERY frame you forget its animated and believe its real, but not live-action real, rather a fantasy realism that might exist far away if you only use your imagination.Howl's Moving Castle also contains Joe Hisaishi's finest musical score. The blu-ray lets the music burst to life in ways not capable on DVD. I'm a fan of Hisaishi's work, but his talent is put to full use here and it pays off.The story is my personal favorite of all the Ghibli films. It's themes of loving oneself and the importance of a pure heart strike the biggest to me. Sophie is a wonderfully created young lady, and Miyazaki animates her with great care. Her expression through face and body is tender, and the voice-work in the English dub fits her character perfectly. Ghibli films are often full of strong female characters, and Sophie is perhaps the most interesting of them all. Her personal journey is magical to behold, and by the end of the film she truly finds her place amongst a group of oddballs, proving everyone fits in somewhere.I cannot wait to watch this film again on blu-ray. If you own the DVD and are a fan of this film, you owe it to yourself to buy the blu-ray version. Movie: 5/5 stars.The blu-ray has perfect video and audio quality. This is one of the nicest-looking blu-ray releases of 2013. You will see details you never knew existed, and be swept away with a wonderful musical score. Video/Audio: 5/5 stars.Extras are the same as the DVD release. 3/5 stars.Overall: 5/5 stars. Though everyone may have a different personal favorite Ghibli film, there is no doubt that Howl's Moving Castle was made to be seen on blu-ray, and it is Miyazaki's most elegant masterpiece. Perfect video and audio with the usual extras makes this release a must-own for fans of cinema.Rating: PG. Some frightening material takes place, some of the characters might frighten young children. There is some brief animated blood, but not as much as there is in Spirited Away (also PG). Howl is nude for a brief moment but nothing is seen. In all honesty I think adults will appreciate this film more than young children, who might rather enjoy Ponyo or My Neighbor Totoro.

957001,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000CDGVOE,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[5, 9]","Having seen most of Miyazaki's magnificent films, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Judging by the trailers, this latest creation from the ingenious mind of one of Japan's most talented and legendary film makers of all time it looked to be another smashing success. Unfortunately, it was nowhere near as awe inspiring as any of his previous gems.The movie starts out very promising and continues in the traditional vein of Miyazaki taking his audience on a magical journey to an imaginary world where anything is possible. It almost goes without saying that the artwork is incredible, as always, and the level of detail and passion for the images displayed on screen goes unquestioned.However, the story falls almost completely apart with little to no continuity accompanied by giant, gaping plot holes that leave one wondering what in the wonderful world of Miyazaki is going on here? The story actually flows pretty smoothly with a few minor glitches up until the last half hour at which point it essentially falls apart. Apparently by reading the book the film is based on one would have a better idea of why things occur as they do and would shed some background on what exactly is going on with the two warring factions, Sophie, Howl and the Wicked Witch of the Waste's curses. Movie audiences should not be required to know the full background though in order to enjoy a film, so in that regard Miyazaki disappoints because he leaves WAY too much to the imagination, so much so that it is to the point where the audience would have to write a few chapters just to fill the story gaps. No amount of beautiful animation can compensate for shoddy story telling, not even Miyazaki.Quite frankly there is not enough exposition to provide an adequate framework for understanding what is going on with Sophie, and some major inconsistencies such as why her age seems to fluctuate between old and young over the latter half of the film, even though the curse is only supposed to make her old until the spell cast on her is broken. The audience is given a rather vague idea of what Howl's involvement with the two warring kingdoms is, what he does in his spare time and why the things that happen to him occur as they do.There is an intriguing part of the story involving Madam Suliman who is the royal arch sorceress and how she was the master of Howl at one point, but this story arch is highly underdeveloped and despite the high flying premise of the idea it never really takes off. She also has something to do with the Wicked Witch of the Waste, but that's never fleshed out either. Hence, the audience is left hanging and wondering how these thematic elements all tie together.I did notice one major problem with the film besides the aforementioned incongruities which is that many major concepts are copied directly from Miyazaki's previous films, including script and art elements. The giant black, slimy blobs from 'Spirited Away' play a fairly important part in 'Howl's Moving Castle', as does winged air ships and the smaller flying ships known from 'Laputa: Castle In the Sky', and perhaps the biggest concept that Miyazaki copied from his own previous work is the idea/depiction of Howl and his alter ego, which was highly reminiscent of one of the major character characters from 'Spirited Away', Haku. Coincidental I suppose since I haven't read the book but it just felt like the portrayal and concept was cut and pasted from 'Spirited Away'.Overall I enjoyed it purely on an artistic level, and while some of the magic is still evident from the brilliant mind of Miyazaki, the film seemed to be a smorgasbord of several of his films rolled into one, and not a very fluid, successful attempt at that.

957008,A1HFD1S7QM8RHN,B000CDGVOE,"Damon B. ""Teen Film Critic""","[5, 8]","Supreme Japanese animation lord Hayao Miyazaki's latest film release, Howl's Moving Castle, is both a solid success and a slight failure.  Based upon the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle lacks nothing in terms of imagination or strong characters.  Despite being adapted from the novel, the film still reeks of the delicious Miyazaki flavor, and fans of his previous work will be right at home.  In fact, Howl's Moving Castle has such a Miyazaki-esque plot that one would never infer that it's based upon a novel.One would think that being based off of a book would ensure a detailed and nearly perfect plot.  The plot, however, is the movie's greatest shortcoming.  While it starts off as intriguing, it eventually deteriorates into a somewhat sloppy, vague mess.  The film's most significant and apparent plot devices seem rushed and lack necessary background info, forcing the audience to fill in many dark areas based upon their own inferences.  This wouldn't be too much of an issue if the movie didn't have the habit of merely alluding to the slightest of implications.For instance, the entire cataclysm for Howl's plot is the Wicked Witch of the Waste putting a curse on main character Sophie which turns her into an old woman.  The witch walks into the girl's shop after hours for no apparent reason (though in the book it's made clear that the witch is in actuality dissatisfied with a purchased garment; this is never brought up in the movie), bullies poor, innocent Sophie, and then sets her curse without a second thought.  It isn't until much later in the movie that the audience can even begin to piece together a strong reason why the witch would do such a thing to Sophie (it seems to me that it has to do with a strong jealousy in regards to the character known as Howl), and even then the audience doesn't gain much evidence from the movie to support such interpretations.  In fact, the entire plotline suffers from similar faulty foundation: the entire war situation is barely developed, the declared love between the two main characters seems to come out of nowhere (sure, the film has its charming subtleties in this regard - don't think I missed them - but it seems a bit unrealistic that the two characters would be so settled on their feelings), and the main villain is utterly wasted.What the movie lacks in terms of plot is more than made up for in almost every other aspect.  The animation is perhaps the finest I have ever experienced: I was on the verge of goose bumps the first time I saw Howl's castle walk across the fog-shrouded landscape.  Just as impressive are the sprawling environments that the characters find themselves in.  The interior of Howl's castle is beautiful and unique, particularly Howl's bedroom.  Howl's ""secret garden"" is awe-inspiring, and all of the various towns have a very real look to them.  The numerous aircraft are also lovingly detailed and are certainly something that Hayao Miyazaki is to take pride in considering his love for planes and flight sequences.Howl's Moving Castle also has some of the most fantastic characters ever conceived in an animated movie.  Every single one of them, no matter how major or understated, is absolutely bursting with personality.  Much of this is attributable to Miyazaki's distinctive art style, but the writing and situations are perhaps most important in developing the characters.  Take special note when main characters interact with secondary ones: oftentimes, the underplayed characters are perhaps the most interesting, particularly Sophie's mother: she's even more detestable than the main villain, even despite her subtle deviance.Also worth noting are the movie's numerous and potent messages.  While Miyazaki's pro-nature messages are growing to be a bit pedestrian (and are a lot less pungent here than in Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds), his thoughts on greed and love are quite different than anything he's preached before.  Indeed, the sheer beauty of this movie's messages is that they're so effective because of the wonderful characterization and the glorious art.  At one pivotal point in the movie, the Wicked Witch of the Waste is transformed into a most miserable state, which is perhaps the most powerful tool in conveying the sorrowful yet human anti-greed message.All in all, despite a somewhat frail plot, Howl's Moving Castle is a resounding success.  It's not creative enough to top Miyazaki's Spirited Away, nor is it deep or serious enough to be considered on par with his masterpiece Princess Mononoke, but it is a worthy entry to his overall legacy.  Fans young and old alike should experience this film, and they should definitely bring a friend.

You might think this makes no difference, but Japanese films sometimes sound and scan better with the original dialog, and the English re-recorded dialog can be rewritten (sometimes egregiously) to match the lip movements. When you watch with the Japanese soundtrack enabled (which also includes Japanese language titles), the altered English dialog captions are irrelevant.I've confirmed by comparing the first conversation between Sophie and Calcifer, and Sophie and Markl, that this new release does feature the Japanese-to-English dialog in the ENG captioning from the DVD release. (You can determine which is which by simply playing the English soundtrack and trying both caption options.

957015,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000CDGVOE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","Hayao Miyazaki, the most prominent Japanese filmmaker who has created animated films that not only broke Japanese box office records but has created animated films that reflect upon nature, technology, family and more. Compared to the accomplishments of Walt Disney, Miyazaki is a filmmaker who has amassed a respect from his fans worldwide and his animations studio, Studio Ghibli, continues to be one of the most appreciated and respected animation and production studios in the world.In 2004, Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli released ""Howl's Moving Castle"" in Japan and released in America in 2005. An animated film adaptation that is loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' 1986 fantasy novel.  As Miyazaki is a pacifist, the major difference between the novel and the animated film is that the animated film is set during a time of war and Miyazaki was affected by America's war in Iraq which profoundly impacted the film.  There are also key differences of the main characters (ie. Sulliman in the novel is a man, in the animated film, Sulliman is a woman) and more characters in the novel that are not in the animated film version, but author Diana Wynne Jones gave her blessing for the film and that although she had no input on the film, she expected the film to be different from her novels.The English dub was directed by Pixar's Pete Docter (""Toy Story"" films and ""Monsters, Inc.""), a big Studio Ghibli fan and would feature an all-star cast which includes Christian Bale, Billy Crystal, Blythe Danner, Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Josh Hutcherson.With a budget of $24 million, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" was a box office success earning over $235 million in the box office and for many film critics, were included in their best 10 films of 2005.In May 2013, Disney will be releasing Howl's Moving Castle"" for the first time on Blu-ray along with another Studio Ghibli classic, ""My Neighbor Totoro"".VIDEO:""Howl's Moving Castle"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and what a gorgeous film that Studio Ghibli was able to create.  It's a staple of Miyazaki films, beautiful art backgrounds, wonderfully painted, lush green forests and sceneries and detailed buildings.  Colors are vibrant, characters are well-designed using the Studio Ghibli style.I saw no banding, compression or any negative issues during my viewing of ""Howl's Moving Castle"".  This film is colorful, gorgeous and magnificent in HD!AUDIO:As for the audio, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is presented in English and Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And immediately from the starting of the film, with the various aircraft and Howl's moving castle, you can hear with each foot movement, LFE reacting to the huge metal on ground and the sounds enveloping the soundscape with magnificent dynamic range and surround sound use.  An active soundtrack that sounds crystal clear, clean dialogue and an immersive soundscape during its more action-intensive scenes, fans should be happy with this lossless soundtrack!Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""My Neighbor Totoro"" comes with the following special features on a second DVD disc. Included are:Behind the Microphone - (9:02) - Co-Producers Rick Dempsey, Ned Lot, Director Pete Docter, English language adaptation crew - Cindy and Don Hewitt discuss the English language adaptation.  Featuring the all-star talent involved in the English dub process and more!Interview with Pete Docter - (7:23) A Japanese featurette with an interview with Pete Docter about working on ""Howl's Moving Castle"".  (English with Japanese with English subtitles).Hello Mr. Lasster: Hayao Miyazaki Visits Pixar - (16:29) A Japanese featurette featuring Hayao Miyazaki's surprise visit at Pixar animation studios.TV Spots and Trailers - (8:15) The television spots and trailers for ""Howl's Moving Castle"".Original Japanese Storyboards - (1:59:10) The entire film with Japanese dialogue (with English subtitles) featuring the original Japanese storyboards.EXTRAS:""Howl's Moving Castle"" comes with a slipcover.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki's work, one thing you can always expect is quality, a message delivered through the film from Miyazaki but also a feeling of fantasy, fun but most of all, an enjoyable cinematic experience.Because Studio Ghibli is responsible for so many hit films, majority of them have become box office hits not only in Japan but many other countries including here in the United States, it's not easy to compare each film on how it ranks in the typical ""Which Miyazaki film is best?"" poll.  Everyone has their own experience with each of his films and an opinion of which work is better or weaker.And to tell you the truth, I can't even call a Studio Ghibli film weak because each film I have watched, I thoroughly enjoyed and felt it was a cinematic experience.For ""Howl's Moving Castle"", I can say that I enjoyed other Studio Ghibli films much more, but I can also say that I enjoyed this film for its story and breathtaking visuals.  But first let me explain why.When it comes to Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli films, I have enjoyed the pacifist message that are seen in films such as ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Castle of the Wind"".  I loved the human emotion portrayed in ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Ponyo"" and ""Arrietty"".  So, I do enjoy the Studio Ghibli films that are melodramatic, full of human emotion or is smart, complex with a message from Miyazaki and also the films that mixes fantasy.With ""Howl's Moving Castle"", the film is another with a message from the pacifist, Hayao Miyazaki who was not too thrilled with America's war on Iraq.  The film unlike the novel is set during the time of war but the film mixes in fantasy but also an emotional element.Sophie is a young woman who never saw herself as beautiful or even needed, but now under the curse of a witch, she has been turned into an older woman and realizes that she has fallen for Howl, a man who risks his life trying to prevent war but yet countries wanting to use his power for war. The film introduces colorful characters such as the humorous flame demon Calcifer (who is unaware of his true inner strength), a young boy named Michael who is an apprentice of Howl but you wonder what has happened to this boy's family but how important Sophie has become in his life almost as a motherly figure.  And of course, we learn about Howl and even the Witch of the Waste and why she is so desperate of stealing Howl's heart.With a magical storyline, Studio Ghibli delivers with gorgeous visuals from well-detailed, painted buildings and scenery.  The mechanical design of Howl's moving castle is also a sight to behold.The voice acting is also wonderful!  The Japanese version utilizing popular actor (and SMAP music star) Takuya Kimura as Howl and longtime actress Chieko Baisho as Sophie.  While the English dub version utilizes an all-star cast with Christian Bale as Howl, Emily Mortimer as Sophie, Billy Crystal as Calcifer, Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman.  But knowing how Miyazaki loves the utilization of screen legends, Disney also features the voice acting of Jean Simmons as the older Sophie and Lauren Bacall as the voice of the Witch of the Waste.  Which is better, I feel it is very subjective to the viewer but I do enjoy the acting on both soundtracks.And while I enjoyed the storyline and the visuals, typically, you are used to watching the protagonist in a more demanding and active role.  For the role of Sophie, it's difficult when most of the storyline features her as an older woman, shown cooking, cleaning and taking care of the castle. For Howl, we understand that he is a free spirit, not wanting war to take place and sacrificing his life, but there are moments where you wonder more about his character that is not fully explained.  Not to say that it becomes too confusing but you just feel that you want a bit more explanation about Howl's motivations a bit more.With that being said, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is still an enjoyable and gorgeous film, even moreso now in HD on Blu-ray.But for a studio that has created many wonderful films, in terms of storyline, there are other Studio Ghibli films that I enjoyed much more.Overall, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is another enjoyable Studio Ghibli film.  Another box office hit in the oeuvre of Hayao Miyazaki. While, Studio Ghibli fans already know this is must-have film for their collection, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is worth the upgrade to Blu-ray due to its gorgeous picture quality and it's crystal clear lossless soundtrack.

Even the heroes have flaws, and the villians have redeeming features. Unlike so much other animation, which is hectic and noisy, his makes use of pauses and dreamlike silences.The English dubbing is excellent. At first, I was a bit put off by Billy Crystal as Calcifer, and found the casting a bit jarring. I got over it quickly, however. The dubbing avoids most of the over-hurried dialog of some of the other English versions of Miyazaki's films.The plot is fairly complex, and you never know quite what's going to happen next. I do wish a few of the details had been fleshed out a bit; I was somewhat confused about what, exactly, happened to Howl's heart and why.My daughters, ages 3 and 6, love this movie, and it's been standing up to repeated viewings for the family adults as well. I like that it's not too violent or scary for my 3-year-old, but not too tame for the rest of us.All in all, strongly recommended.

957021,AUTJJLEECEI2R,B000CDGVOE,Dorothea,"[8, 21]","This movie is very creative and to some extent entertaining, but Miyazaki can't seem to organize his ideas.  It starts out smoothly, but soon disintegrates into episodic scenes that are only loosely strung together.  It's the sort of movie where, even if you're enjoying it, you start wondering, ""When does this end?"" because you genuinely have no idea--the story isn't structured enough to give you a sense of beginning, middle, and finish.  Also, there's no sense of mystery to any of the events.  Even the magic is flashy and superficial.My biggest complaint, even more than the bad structure, is the heroine; she just isn't an interesting character.  I can't even call her a heroine.  She starts out sewing hats at her father's store and then moves on to cooking and cleaning in Howl's castle.  I've heard a lot of arguments for why she's a good character.  Some people say that she evolves and finds wisdom in the old age that is forced on her.  Clearly she becomes less repressed and more *youthful*.  The nature of the spell that has been cast on her (I'll avoid spoilers) is also pretty compelling.  However, she's still boring, mundane, and fundamentally powerless.  I like strong female leads like Nausicaa and I was a little offended that yet again, Miyazaki's heroine is left cooking and cleaning and depending on the hero for everything else.  Not only that, but the heroine is absurdly forgiving, to a point that I found insulting.  Miyazaki has given us an abuse-absorbing dishrag.On a side note, what does Miyazaki have against fat people?  There is a scene that is waaaaay too long showing the corpulescent Witch of the Waste climbing a tall flight of stairs; you're shown in incredible detail her many jiggling chins and the oily sweat pouring down her face.  For a scene that should have been cut, it drags on interminably and is quite frankly both disgusting and offensive.  In the meantime, the main character, from the top of the stairs, encourages her forward.  Why is she rooting for the witch who only recently turned her into a 90 year old?

957026,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000CDGVOE,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[200, 215]","Not a lot of directors would be brave enough to take on a love story between a girl-turned-old-lady and a wizard missing a vital organ. But Oscar-winning Hayao Miyazaki tackles a new fantasy realm in in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" -- namely, that of fantasy dowager Diana Wynne Jones.Sophie (Emily Mortimer) is a plain, unhappy young woman working in a milliner's shop -- lightened only slightly by a mysterious wizard who rescues her one day. But then the evil Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) comes into the shop, and casts a spell on her, turning her into an ancient old lady (Jean Simmons). Sophie ends up wandering into the Moving Castle, a chicken-legged chaos machine, and encountering the sexy if childish wizard Howl (Christian Bale), smart-aleck fire demon Calcifur (Billy Crystal), and preteen apprentice Markl (Josh Hutcherson).Sophie appoints herself the cleaning lady and starts whipping the castle into shape, trying to deal with Howl's temper tantrums and the war brewing all around them, and trying to cure her peculiar curse. But when she runs an errand to a castle in Howl's place, she finds that her new boss has some sinister problems of his own -- including his missing heart, and impending transformation into a monster.Don't expect much fidelity to the novel; Miyazaki takes plenty of liberties with the story. As a result, it feels more like his story than Jones', with all the earmarks he usually has -- blobby monsters, colorful rural settings, intense anti-war messages, strange machines, and a Jules-Verne atmosphere of Victorian technology. But ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is very different from the others Miyazaki has done, since he kept the British flavour of the original book.It's also different because it's a love story -- and a surprisingly un-cheesy one. In less skilled hands, having Howl say ""I finally found something worth protecting. It's you"" would seem inane, but Miyazaki keeps it brief and powerful. And even though Sophie looks elderly through most of the movie, Miyazaki never falls into trite observations about inner beauty. He just lets the story tell us that.The animation is virtually flawless, from the chaotic absurdity Moving Castle to the breathtaking aerial battles with the bird-man Howl. Tiny details are everywhere, from painted ceiling beams to elaborate doorknobs. But there are also quiet, entertaining moments, such as Sophie attempting to houseclean the entire Moving Castle. Calcifur is the one sore point -- he's not done badly, but he looks vaguely artificial. I suppose a fire demon is hard to animate.There are a few flaws, in that the story could have used a bit more fleshing out -- at times the relationships between the characters are sketchy. Not much detail, for example, is given about sorceress Suliman (Blythe Danner) and her relationship to Howl, or why she's so peeved at him. Or about the nature of Howl's increasingly dangerous magic and why he did what he did to lose his heart.While there are the usual ""howls"" that the English dubbing is inferior to the original Japanese, the assorted voice actors did exceptional work in the American version. Christian Bale and Billy Crystal are the major standouts -- Crystal is funny and dry as usual, while Bale is sultry, sexy, soft-spoken and deep. Except, of course, when Howl runs around the house shrieking that his hair is ruined.""Howl's Moving Castle"" moves on a little too fast in places, but it's still a breathtaking, romantic, colorful ride. A wonderful story, told by one of the few filmmakers who could do it justice.",5,"A real ""Howl""",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,3550,"['Not', 'lot', 'directors', 'would', 'be', 'brave', 'enough', 'take', 'love', 'story', 'girl-turned-old-lady', 'wizard', 'missing', 'vital', 'organ', 'Oscar-winning', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'new', 'fantasy', 'realm', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'namely', 'fantasy', 'dowager', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones.Sophie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'plain', 'unhappy', 'young', 'woman', 'working', 'milliner', 'shop', 'lightened', 'only', 'slightly', 'mysterious', 'wizard', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'then', 'evil', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'shop', 'spell', 'turning', 'ancient', 'old', 'lady', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Sophie', 'up', 'wandering', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'chicken-legged', 'chaos', 'machine', 'encountering', 'sexy', 'childish', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'smart-aleck', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifur', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'preteen', 'apprentice', 'Markl', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', '.Sophie', 'appoints', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'whipping', 'castle', 'shape', 'trying', 'deal', 'Howl', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'war', 'brewing', 'trying', 'cure', 'peculiar', 'curse', 'when', 'errand', 'castle', 'Howl', 'place', 'new', 'boss', 'sinister', 'problems', 'own', 'including', 'missing', 'heart', 'impending', 'transformation', 'monster.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'fidelity', 'novel', 'Miyazaki', 'plenty', 'liberties', 'story', 'result', 'more', 'story', 'Jones', 'earmarks', 'usually', 'blobby', 'monsters', 'colorful', 'rural', 'settings', 'intense', 'anti-war', 'messages', 'strange', 'machines', 'Jules-Verne', 'atmosphere', 'Victorian', 'technology', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'very', 'different', 'others', 'Miyazaki', 'done', 'kept', 'British', 'flavour', 'original', 'book.It', 'also', 'different', 'love', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'un-cheesy', 'one', 'less', 'skilled', 'hands', 'having', 'Howl', 'say', 'finally', 'found', 'something', 'worth', 'protecting', 'would', 'seem', 'inane', 'Miyazaki', 'brief', 'powerful', 'even', 'Sophie', 'elderly', 'most', 'movie', 'Miyazaki', 'never', 'trite', 'observations', 'inner', 'beauty', 'just', 'story', 'tell', 'that.The', 'animation', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'chaotic', 'absurdity', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'breathtaking', 'aerial', 'battles', 'bird-man', 'Howl', 'Tiny', 'details', 'are', 'everywhere', 'painted', 'ceiling', 'beams', 'elaborate', 'doorknobs', 'are', 'also', 'quiet', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'such', 'Sophie', 'attempting', 'houseclean', 'entire', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Calcifur', 'one', 'sore', 'point', 'not', 'done', 'badly', 'vaguely', 'artificial', 'suppose', 'fire', 'demon', 'hard', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out', 'times', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'sketchy', 'Not', 'much', 'detail', 'example', 'given', 'sorceress', 'Suliman', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'relationship', 'Howl', 'why', 'so', 'peeved', 'nature', 'Howl', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'magic', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'lose', 'heart.While', 'are', 'usual', 'howls', 'English', 'dubbing', 'inferior', 'original', 'Japanese', 'assorted', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'exceptional', 'work', 'American', 'version', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'are', 'major', 'standouts', 'Crystal', 'funny', 'dry', 'usual', 'Bale', 'sultry', 'sexy', 'soft-spoken', 'deep', 'course', 'when', 'Howl', 'house', 'shrieking', 'hair', 'ruined', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'places', 'still', 'breathtaking', 'romantic', 'colorful', 'ride', 'wonderful', 'story', 'told', 'one', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'justice']",N/A

Pixar might be another but while Pixar does it with brilliant scripting and amazing visuals Miyazaki's strength is in his creativity. His movies always have a wonderful dream like quality reminiscent of Peter Pan or Alice in Wonderland. Miyazaki's latest film is set in an industrial age fantasy world with wizards and flying war machines that rain fire on cities below. The lead character, Sofi, finds herself on a quest to remove a curse cast by the Witch of the Waste that has aged her from a young lady into a fat old woman. She ends up in the wizard Howl's magical moving castle (which more resembles a house) working as his cleaning lady. The other part of her curse is that she can't tell anyone about her curse.`Howl's Moving Castle' is a very well done movie but I have to put it below most of Miyazaki's other works particularly his pervious film, Spirited Away, which I consider his best film ever. The moving castle itself is absolutely stunning but Howl is surprisingly generic looking having the typical anime look for a heroic lead male in his early 20's. I also wasn't thrilled with Billy Crystal's voice as the fire demon Calcifer. My biggest problem with the movie was that it dragged in the center parts and the ending was surprisingly abrupt and overly neat. Mind you I'm rating this film on a Miyazaki scale which is far beyond ordinary mortal director scale. Miyazaki has an amazing ability to show viewers something new rather than rehash old ideas. He has a real artist's touch for design and an attention to detail that's second to none.I have never seen a mediocre Miyazaki film and I recommend them all including Castle in the Sky and Castle of Cagliostro (Miyazaki does seem to have an obsession with castles).

I much prefer the Japanese version.The story is a tad confusing, taking too much for granted.  There's a war with a neighboring country over the disappearance of the other country's crown prince.  Help is sought in the form of witches and wizards who are expected to assist in the battle.  Meanwhile, there's also another story in progress, involving the Witch of the Waste who has romantic intentions on a young wizard named Howl.  Poor Sophie the hatter gets in her way and is cursed, turning into a ninety-year old woman.  The story turns its attention onto her plight, how to break the curse.  Later, another witch, Suliman, takes it upon herself to relieve witches and wizards of their power if she deems them a threat.  Howl becomes her prime target.At the heart of all this is an incredible steampunk monstrosity that strolls through the countryside.  It's run on Calcifer power, a fire-demon who made a pact with Howl when he was a boy.This film is filled with fanciful elements and extraordinary characters.  The artwork is incredible.

Being a huge fan of Pokemon, I thought that their movies were the best Japanese animation you could get.Boy, was I wrong.This movie shines, from the beginning to the end. The animation has no flaws and fits perfectly with the story. The music is gorgeous, the central theme enchanting.The story itself starts out softly as Sophie, the most practical of her sisters, locks up her hatter's shop and goes out to visit her sister Lettie. En route, she gets ambushed by a pair of soldiers. Before they've stopped interrogating her, she is rescued by a strangely dressed, gorgeous young man who literally sweeps her off her feet and takes her on an amazing journey, fleeing from strange blobby monsters.After getting home, Sophie has an encounter with the generously proportioned Witch of the Waste. Angered by Sophie, the Witch turns her into a giant-nosed old woman. After slightly panicking, Sophie sets off on a journey into the Wastes, where she sets a creepy scarecrow upright and finds Howl's moving castle.Entering the creaking castle, Sophie finds a crabby fire demon called Calcifer, who immediately makes a deal with her; he will undo her curse if she undoes his. He is doomed to stay in the fireplace and work for Howl. The reason for that is that Howl caught Calcifer, then a shooting star, and made a deal with the star to keep it alive. Calcifer was then born and immediately entered into the curse.The next day, Sophie sees the power of the magical door, seeing it open into a small town called Porthaven and the royal city, Kingsbury. She also meets Howl's young apprentice, Markyl, who disguises himself as a bearded dwarf in order to interact with strangers.As Sophie makes breakfast (a surprising feat, making Calcifer bend over), she sees the gorgeous, low-voiced man that swept her away from her blobby attackers two days before. She then learns that he is Howl, the mysterious, supposedly heartless wizard.After those events, Howl and Sophie are dragged into a fast-paced adventure that involves a World War I-like war (over a MISSING PRINCE?!?), a tantrum over a hair-color change, a curse that will turn its recipient into a bird-monster, and a Royal Wizard who is determined to enlist every wizard for the king--or strip them of their powers.The movie enchants you from the beginning. I have read the book that the film is based on--if you want the story, get the movie, NOT THE BOOK!Three last-minute things--If you are a girl, go see this movie.

The story revolves around a young teenage girl named Sofie (Emily Mortimer) who suddenly is on the receiving end of a witch's curse (voiced by the wonderful Lauren Bacall) and is turned into a 90 year old woman (Jean Simmons is the voice for the old Sofie). Unable to live with what she has become and didn't want to embarass her family, Sofie runs away from home. She comes across a young wizard named Howl (Christian Bale) and becomes part of his household as his cleaning maid. There Sofie befriends Calcifer a fire demon. After much discussion, the two decided to help each other from each other's curse.The animation in the film was spectacular. The colors were so rich and vibrant. Good mix of computer and hand drawn animation. I have not read the original novel so I can't compare the film with the novel. From what I have read there have been some changes in the story. I am not really a Billy Crystal fan but he was actually funny as Calcifer. Christian Bale was an excellent choice for Howl. His soft spoken voice matched perfectly with the gentle and kind character.I had to give this film four stars because I would have liked to have seen the film in its original language (Japanese). I feel that when Hollywood takes a foreign animated film and gets rid of the orginal language it was shot in, it takes away some of the heart and soul of the film. I hope that when this film comes out on dvd, there will be an option on the dvd to hear it in its original language. The english kinda cheapened the whole film experience for me.

That being said I love the movie of Howl's Moving Castle. I just love the book more which is why the movie doesn't get five stars from me.This movie centers around Sophie, an 18 year old girl who is under a curse that makes her look about 90. Howl is a ""wimpy wizard"" (so says the included trailers) who creates a moving castle to hide from the Witch of the Waste (and the King, and anyone else that might want something from him). Calcifer is the fire demon who makes the castle work. There is also an assortment of amusingly unusual characters to choose from in this movie. Together they make a great movie but I did think that the anti-war theme was a little heavy handed. It ruined the flow of the story and actually took up time that should've been used for character development. That being said, I still love this movie I just don't care much for the last half hour or so. Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer have easily become my favorite characters in a long time. Sophie finally finds her backbone when she's turned into an old woman and makes for a really amusing character. Calcifer provides good comic relief. He's little and cute which doesn't hurt either (though he does turn into a big demonic flame twice in the movie). And Howl is, well, Howl. He's cowardly, vain, and prone to histrionics. What's not to love? Unfortunately with the badly explained war scenes Howl is the one who loses out the most in the book to movie translation. He had so many more tantrums to throw and there just wasn't enough time for it all. Despite that, the scene where his hair dying goes awry is memorable enough to make up for any plot problems. Though if you're sensitive to animated nudity there is a brief flash of Howl's butt in that scene. Just a warning.This movie has beautiful animation, fun characters, and is pretty satisfying overall. I was even able to watch most of it with my four year old and it's rare that we can both sit down and be equally entertained by a movie. The book by Diana Wynne Jones is understandably better but the movie is still good in a pinch. If you object to Christian Bale's voice as Howl (yes, it is a little deep for such an effeminate man) then try the Japanese audio instead.",4,Good movie.

I've heard the book's very different and I think it would ruin my enjoyment of this fantastic  film.Okay, I love this movie, it may be my favorite Miyazaki movie of all time (though The Cat Returns and My Neighbor Totoro come pretty close).  There's just something magical in this fantasy tale that really draws me in.  First off, some people complain that this movie made no sense, but I really enjoy Miyazaki's narrative style; he doesn't spell things out for you plot point by plot point (the story is not very hard to understand anyway, I don't understand people's confusion).  It really gives this movie good replay value; everytime I rewatch it, I learn/notice something new.Secondly, the animation is beautiful.  Just the sweeping scenes of the landscape was gorgeous and really helped you get a feel for the setting.Thirdly, I felt the characters were very endearing. Especially Calcifer.  I really loved his character (with Billy Crystal voicing), he is very humorous (""Sophie, it looks like it's gonna RAIN!""; this line just wouldn't be as funny if someone else voiced it).  The other characters were also very likeable, and showed excellent character depth and development.  Especially Sophie, who we see transform from a timid, mousy girl to a woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of fantasy films.P.S. The bonus features aren't too shabby; there's not an actual ""making-of"", but there is a very interesting interview with the English translator of the film, an interview with the English voice actors, and an amusing piece of footage following Mr. Miyazaki's visit to Pixar.

957041,A1X4P6CN08U57A,B000CDGVOE,FicktionPhotography,"[0, 1]","Howl's Moving Castle is one of Hayao Miyazaki's films that have struck it big here in America.  With his newest film, The Wind Rises, having made it to theaters, I decided to rewatch this film.Sophie, a young, quiet girl who dresses like an 82 year old meets Howl, a powerful sorceror of sorts, on a chance encounter when two thugs in an alley gang up on her with questionable intentions.  Very V For Vendetta.  Later that night, Sophie is cursed by a powerful sorceress.  She is turned into the woman she dresses like and she can't actually tell anyone about what happened so nobody can help her.  Disgraced, she leaves town for the countryside where, bravely, she knows the &#34;scary&#34; and &#34;dangerous&#34; magic-users dwell.By chance, or fate, she finds Howl's gigantic moving castle, enters it, and becomes a resident without Howl ever blinking an eye.  She becomes his cleaning lady, but also shows Howl that the life he is living isn't all it's cracked out to be.  Howl, vain and self-absorbed, is still a good guy beneath it all since he is offering up his life and his very being to save the world from war.  However, he tends to hark on his own beauty and his power to be &#34;above&#34; everyone else in ability, looks, and even his castle, of which he uses to hide behind several identities.  Sophie, now in his life, is doomed to look like an 80 year old woman with a vast amount of sense and unending bravery and tenacity.  Thus begins their obvious love interest and need to come together to overcome adversity.The problem is, and hence the star missing in this review, is that I cannot love Howl.  He has narcissism about him that I don't think ever fully depletes and I think Sophie is swallowed up by a powerful personality and not by the character himself.  The movie almost cheers on the fact of being self-absorbed and allowing another person to figure out your problems for you.  For that the message is slightly lost.However, the movie is still an artistic masterpiece and a well comprised story (if it is a little shaky around the morality points) and lets us feel good after the movie is over, unlike most anime style productions.

957043,A29QA79VLQGHY6,B000CDGVOE,Flipper Campbell,"[3, 3]","The DVD extras on ""Howl's Moving Castle"" pretty much repeat the format used for ""Spirited Away."" Rather than focus on Hayao Miyazaki and his typically fantastic film, the featurettes fuss over Pixar's stewardship of the movie.To be fair, let's note that Pixar and Disney have more than lived up to their vow to give the Japanese animator first-class treatment in the States. For example, they spent big on the dubbing talent for ""Howl,"" which includes Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Billy Crystal, Blythe Danner and Jean Simmons. Pixar's creative frontman John Lasseter declares this ""the best English-language dub of any picture I have seen."" Viewers who usually go straight for the subtitles may even agree, depending on their tolerance for Disney-style sidekicks. ""You never see a fire demon before?"" Crystal asks, as if he's serving up some Carnegie deli. (Remote, please.)An interview with the English dialogue director, Pete Docter, and a docu on Miyazaki's visit to Pixar both were shot for the use of Japanese broadcasters and repurposed on the DVD without explanation, making for odd cross-cultural viewing in spots. (Miyazaki enthusiasts thrive on this kind of disorientation, of course.) The Japanese director addressed the Pixar troops before a ""Howl"" screening. The film is ""true to my heart,"" he warns the audience of film pros. ""And that might confuse you."" Miyazaki has said this tale of a moody wizard and the teen who loves him -- even after she's turned into a 90-year-old crone -- could be his last project. Fans of the director know more or less what to expect except for the Victorian setting. Newcomers should start at the top, with ""Spirited Away,"" then circle back.The other major extra, which takes up disc 2, is a feature-length storyboard presentation. Few of the drawings have much visual impact and there's no option to view the finished scenes at the same time, as there was on Asian ""Howl"" DVDs.The widescreen images (1.85:1) look fine, perhaps a bit too artificially sharp. The 5.1 surround is strong and nicely detailed, with all speakers in play.

957046,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B000CDGVOE,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[4, 18]","This is unquestionably Hayao Miyazaki's worst film, but that still makes it better than most films ever made.  The problem isn't the animation, some of the most gorgeous in hand-drawn animation history; the problem is the WRITING.  Though it is often overshadowed by the incredible visuals, a key part of Miyazaki's past success has been brilliant writing; this film represents a real regression from his peak.So what went wrong?  To begin with Miyazaki has taken his ""strong female central character"" to its (il)logical extreme: Sophie may be his strongest female protagonist yet; Howl is unquestionably his weakest male protagonist to date.Sophie withstands a blow that would have crushed most people - unjustly and almost pointlessly cursed into being a 90-year-old lady, she responds with common sense, acceptance, and most incredibly of all, good spirits and good humor!  Howl by contrast is selfish, cowardly, immature, and totally irresponsible!  He is also prone to the most incredibly dimwitted judgments.  For example he condemns as foolish those magicians who have transformed themselves in order to serve their country in time of war, risking never being able to resume their human forms, while he is doing the EXACT SAME THING for some unknown but purely selfish reasons!  It would be one thing if Howl was avoiding the same folly, but to be taking the SAME risks for lesser reasons while sitting in judgment is sheer idiocy!  While disguised as his King, Howl condemns the use of magic to protect the palace because bombs are bouncing off the ""shield"" and killing civilians.  This is a valid criticism, but the solution is not to allow enemy bombs to destroy the palace as Howl suggests, but rather to evacuate the surrounding area!  Howl also questions whether there is any difference between ""our"" bombers and ""their"" bombers.  Well, yes, there is SOME difference because ""their"" bombers are somewhat more likely to BOMB YOU!  Howl has SOME excuse for thinking this way since his government is hunting him down as a ""draft dodger"", but in the context of his deciding to ""mess with"" what turns out to be a ""friendly"" bomber and thus exposing his ""secret garden"" to them as the ""portal"" it is, it is just further evidence of his staggering stupidity!  Later when the ""coward"" finally decides to fight (and kill) to protect ""his own"", he pretty much destroys any remaining ""moral high-ground"" he ever had as a ""conscientious objector"".  This is the time for the ""Sergeant York"" moment if there is ever going to be one; instead we get Sophie desperately wishing Howl had remained a coward!  By the time Howl's (inadequately explained) excuse is revealed at the end, it is far too late to redeem him.A second problem is the large number of plot points left unexplained.  Briefly Howl's and Calcifer's relationship and varying motivations for same, particularly at the beginning remains a mystery as is Howl's reason for ""battlefield tourism"".  So is the reason a determined ""draft dodger"" must ""answer"" a summons he has no intention of ""obeying"".  It is also suggested that the war was cooked up or at least manipulated by Madame Suliman in order to have an excuse to go after Howl and assorted other troublemakers.  It really MATTERS whether or not this is true.A third problem is the in-your-face antiwar viewpoint of this movie.  Now, for the most part I am willing to cut Japanese, particularly survivors of WWII like Miyazaki, a lot of slack in this area; few peoples have better excuses for having a warped view on the justification for military action than the Japanese.  However in previous movies:Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,Castle in the Sky,Porco Rosso, andPrincess Mononoke, Miyazaki has shown a much greater grasp of the ""grayness"" of the question.  InNausicaa of the Valley of the Windthe title character's and her people's willingness to use violence to defend their freedom and avenge their dead is not condemned except where it is demonstrably foolish.  InCastle in the Skythe children are absolutely praised for an act of total destruction.  InPorco Rossothe title character's shame at surviving his squadron mates is respected rather than ridiculed, and inPrincess Mononokethe Iron Workers are compared favorably with the soldiers sent to enslave them until Lady Eboshi makes a ""deal with the devil"" to kill the King of the Forest.In contrast in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" military personnel are invariably portrayed as fools or scum, and there is a deliberate attempt to pretend that there is no difference between the two sides.  This is made all the more remarkable by the (I have to assume accidental and not completely thought through) revelation at the end that PROVES that the ""enemy"" nation is fighting a ""just"" war!  I'm trying not to be a ""spoiler"" here so let's just say that it turns out that the very casually mentioned casus belli (you might have to watch it again with subtitles on in order to catch it) turns out to be TRUE!  It turns out that Sophie's and Howl's government HAS committed an act of war, either of commission or omission, totally justifying everything that was done to their country after all!  Amazing!One possible reason for Miyazaki's demonstrably less intelligent dealing with the question of war in this movie was revealed when he told a Newsweek reporter that he almost refused to go to Hollywood to pick up his Oscar forSpirited Awaybecause of his anger over the Iraq War.  Now the left-wing reporter who no doubt agreed with Miyazaki didn't bother to ask a follow-up, but two problems with Miyazaki's answer ought to be obvious.  First, why would anger over the Iraq War cause you to even consider foregoing the company of the most antiwar loons in the country?  Second, regardless what one thinks of the decision to go to war, the intelligence on which it was based, the conduct of the war, or the conduct of the occupation, what cannot be denied is that upwards of TWENTY-FIVE MILLION PEOPLE got their freedom as a result of it.  If you can manage to be ANGRY about THAT, there is something seriously wrong with you, particularly when you are a citizen of a nation that has been, shall we say, a little short of completely honest about its own conduct during WWII and even more particularly when you head an animation studio that has contributed to the problem with ""Grave of the Fireflies""!Note: Like all Disney DVD's since (and including) the reissuedToy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition), this will NOT play properly on some older model DVD players.  The symptoms are the same: the movie on Disc 1 can ONLY be played by going through Scene Selection, and Disc 2 won't play at all.",4,Miyazaki's Worst Film,1145836800,"04 24,

957047,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000CDGVOE,General Breadbasket,"[3, 3]","If I've said it once, I've said it a million times, I don't really know anime but I know what I like. It took a while to grow on me, but I really like Hayao Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle."" a curious colourful fantasy based on the book of the same name.Sophie is a girl who works in a hat shop, in a world filled with steam-based technology, witches and wizards, caught up in a WWII-esque battle in the skies. Near closing time, she refuses to let in a rather plump snobby woman, not realizing that it is the Witch of the Waste. The witch puts a curse on poor Sophie, turning her into an old woman. Though a little shocked, the change isn't that devastating for Sophie, but her friends and housemates might not take it so well, so she hobbles off to the wild wastes, where she discovers Turnip Head, a scarecrow who points poor Sophie to a giant, steam powered, travelling castle, owned by the enigmatic Howl.  He's a handsome, charismatic wizard, much talked about in the town, but he is a man full of secrets, a man embroiled in intrigue and conspiracy, a man who has a dark side of sorts, but whose heart truly is in the right place.Like I've mentioned, this film took a while to grow on me, but grow on me it did. It was probably all the elements that at first glance look like they totally wouldn't work together (the age of steam, wizards, war, cute scarecrows, etc).  Took a while for everything to click, I think that's the best way to describe it, it took a while to understand how everything works within this fictional world. It's one of those films that doesn't stop to explain what's what in great detail, and expects you to keep up. Once it clicks, though, it is a very fascinating place.Hayao Miyazaki does a few things in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" that I thought were rather unique, like making a rather dramatic scene out of the simple task of climbing a flight of stairs. I liked the look of the fire demon Calcifer, how he licks and snakes around the objects he's burning but still seems solid and ""there"". I also liked the way that Howl's messy bathroom managed to look really bright and colorful and yet gritty at the same time. There's a lot to see and enjoy, and lot of characters as colorful as the scenery to love. The music is worth a mention too.I haven't seen much of Hayao Miyazaki's work.

At almost two hours, it's a dazzling, spellbinding trip and a thoughtful flight of fancy.The backgrounds are lavish, beautiful paintings with the characters done in computerized cel-like animation. This makes the characters stand out and is a bit jarring until one falls under the picture's spell. But it is far preferable to the other CGI technique in wide use of shadowing and graying out characters to lend depth and dimension, but losing the bright, lively color and look of cel animation. This latter technique is often used in transitions of cartoons to movies such as Jetsons: The Movie, the Felix the Cat movie, the Rugrats movie and the film of Curious George.Another standout in this film is the English voice acting. Emily Mortimer plays the young Sophie to perfection. Christian Bale is calm and reassuring as the wizard Howl. Was he also Spike in Cowboy Bebop? Billy Crystal is comically understated as the Fire Demon, providing comedy relief as Eddie Murphy did (also well-played) as the dragon in Mulan.These two disc sets are undeniably pricey, but if ever a film deserved this treatment it's this one. The extras include an interview with Pixar about Studio Ghibli and Miyasaki, and animation buffs will find it interesting to hear one studio talk about another. One of the previews on my disc was for Pixar's upcoming Cars, the principals of which resemble the Chevron cars which, interestingly were designed from a partnership between AArdman Animation in Britain (Wallace and Gromit) and Will Vinton Studios in Portland, Oregon.Like Kiki's Delivery Service, which it somewhat resembles, this is an all-family anime that expands the boundaries of the art form without sacrificing traditional strengths of character and story. Some parts may be too intense for younger children, but that's a call parents will have to make. It's certainly a film to grow into, and an unforgettable experience that holds up to repeated viewings.",5,Animated Wonderland,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,2094,"['latest', 'offering', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Tortoro', 'lush', 'enchanting', 'animation', 'wonderland', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'dazzling', 'spellbinding', 'trip', 'thoughtful', 'flight', 'fancy.The', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'lavish', 'beautiful', 'paintings', 'characters', 'done', 'computerized', 'cel-like', 'animation', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'bit', 'jarring', 'one', 'picture', 'spell', 'far', 'preferable', 'other', 'CGI', 'technique', 'wide', 'use', 'shadowing', 'graying', 'out', 'characters', 'lend', 'depth', 'dimension', 'losing', 'bright', 'lively', 'color', 'look', 'cel', 'animation', 'latter', 'technique', 'often', 'used', 'transitions', 'cartoons', 'movies', 'such', 'Jetsons', 'Movie', 'Felix', 'Cat', 'movie', 'Rugrats', 'movie', 'film', 'Curious', 'George.Another', 'standout', 'film', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'young', 'Sophie', 'perfection', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'calm', 'reassuring', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'Was', 'also', 'Spike', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'comically', 'understated', 'Fire', 'Demon', 'providing', 'comedy', 'relief', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'did', 'also', 'well-played', 'dragon', 'Mulan.These', 'two', 'disc', 'sets', 'are', 'undeniably', 'pricey', 'ever', 'film', 'deserved', 'treatment', 'one', 'extras', 'include', 'interview', 'Pixar', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Miyasaki', 'animation', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'hear', 'one', 'studio', 'talk', 'One', 'previews', 'disc', 'was', 'Pixar', 'upcoming', 'Cars', 'principals', 'resemble', 'Chevron', 'cars', 'interestingly', 'were', 'designed', 'partnership', 'AArdman', 'Animation', 'Britain', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Will', 'Vinton', 'Studios', 'Portland', 'Oregon.Like', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'all-family', 'anime', 'boundaries', 'art', 'form', 'sacrificing', 'traditional', 'strengths', 'character', 'story', 'parts', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'younger', 'children', 'call', 'parents', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'certainly', 'film', 'grow', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

While it's true the animation is complex, colorful and original (as usual), the story itself is kind of lukewarm with all the depth of a teen romance novel - when you remove the fantasy elements.  Add the Disney voice-overs and it's even cheesier (Billy Crystal as Howl's 'soul'?).  The main problem is that it's hard to empathize much with Howl. Howl is a vain wizard who wears emerald earrings, cries when his hair comes out wrong, and occasionally turns into a bird and flies away.  Though I kind of liked it when he literally melted, he lacks any substantial personality or character. Goodlooking in a 'teen magazine' kind of way which could make it more interesting for teeny-bop girls in search of a heart-throb, I doubt it'll do much for the male side of the audience.  I just wasn't moved by this story.  Throw in a talking scarecrow to accompany a lost girl on her journey.. and gee, where have I seen that before?  There were occasional twists and turns and lots of unexplainable things going on, but  overall it didn't impress.

Second only to ""Spirited Away,"" this is a household staple standing out in a sea of viewing options.As adapted by Miyazaki from the book by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl (voice of Christian Bale) is a melancholy young wizard (considered a heartthrob by some of the book's fans) who lives in a castle with doors that open into completely different locales. A young boy and a fire spirit (Billy Crystal) are among his few companions.Into his life comes Sophie (Emily Mortimer), a young haberdasher transformed into an old woman (Jean Simmons) by the selfish, corpulent Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall, voicing her second animated role). These are characters that all follow their own arcs with twists and turns aplenty.""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a spectacular viewing experience, rich in sweeping panoramas and astonishing detail, even for a Miyazaki film. You just cannot see it all in one sitting.Pop in the Blu-ray and take a look at the scene in which Sophie enters Howl's chambers, infinitely adorned in glistening jewels, spinning objects and undulating formations. You can't even be sure how deep the space is -- seeing it in 3-D would only literalize it.

The dubs are all very professionally done which is excellent as well. The story as usual for a Ghibli film is magical, yet that is the norm for that society, not hidden like in the Harry Potterverse. The spell on the girl ages her like an old woman so that most others see her not for what she really is, but for how she looks. The saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" is apt here, but mostly in the fact that she is learning the path of wisdom with the mind of the child. The love story is included in her lesson that like most of us, overlaps everyone else's life lessons in self-awareness and choice of 'highroad vs low road' approach to life. To help or hurt others.The threat of the empire-builders is present again and the pressures of society that includes those with magic in their veins. The magic can work both ways as usual, for better or for worse.

Because somehow it manages to be the most magical story Studio Ghibli has ever produced. That is not to say that it is my favorite SG film - My Neighbor Totoro is my favorite. But Howl's Moving Castle is such a roller coaster ride of enchantment and magic that by the end you will feel breathless at just how good the movie is.Others will tell you that Spirited Away is the best Studio Ghibli film. That is their right to say so. Howl's Moving Castle is every bit as good. Howl's Moving Castle tells the story of 18 year old Sophie who by chance finds herself caught in the cross-hairs between the wizard Howl and The Witch of the Waste. Cursed by the Witch into a 90 year old woman, Sophie leaves all that she knew behind and embarks on a long journey. A journey where she encounters turnip-head scarecrows, moving castles, captured demons, enchanted doors that lead to different places, sorceresses of great power, boys who transform into old men, men who transform into birds, and even time travel.The animation is some of the best that Studio Ghibli has ever done. The pacifist ideas of Hayao Miyazaki color the entire film as the story of Howl's Moving Castle is set against the backdrop of a brutal war between two neighboring countries. And the love story between Howl and Sophie is among the more poignant of Studio Ghibli's fantastical films (there are better SG loves stories - Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart come immediately to mind).

One day, she is rescued from boorish soldiers by a magical, charismatic man, who we later discover is Howl, the rumoredly horrible sorcerer. Displeased with Howl's attention on Sophie, the jealous Witch of the Waste transforms our heroine into a feeble 90-year old crone and makes her unable to speak of her curse. Sophie makes her way to the wastelands and chances upon Howl's ensorcelled castle, which is only the beginning of her many magical adventures...The venerable Hayao Miyazaki, most recently of Spirited Away fame, has again outdone himself with the leisurely-paced Howl's Moving Castle, his film adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones's fantasy novel. This man is an exquisite artist, pure and plain. He once more combines stunning pastoral imagery with quirky yet opulent fantasy sequences. He seamlessly marries the mundaneness of his steam-powered world of science with the wild nature of inexplicable, powerful magic. Another cool thing about his films is that he takes full advantage of the cinematic scope, filling the screen's edges and corners with visual delights.Howl's Moving Castle is also a gentle love story between the shy Sophie and the brash but irresponsible Howl. And, like Spirited Away, this offering also focuses on the maturity and growing confidence of the female lead, on her bravery and loyalty to her friends. And speaking of friends, the ones she makes are peculiar and wondrous: Calcifer, the belligerent fire demon who is the engine of Howl's castle; Howl's young, eager  apprentice Markl; Hin, the court sorceress's asthmatic runaway dog; and my personal favorite, the very obliging, non-talking, animated scarecrow Turniphead.I pretty much rate the voice actors by how unintrusive they are in the animated film. If I don't notice them, then it means  I became so immersed in the picture's goings-on that I fully bought into the reality of the characters. In this film, the English voices are convincingly synchronized with the animation. It's nice to see Jean Simmons and Lauren Bacall back in the cinema, and they do a marvelous job respectively as the aged, fatigue-wracked Sophie and the selfish wicked Witch of the Waste. Emily Mortimer is equally proficient as young Sophie, who initially is lacking in confidence but over time, becomes more assertive and assured. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) correctly plays Howl as dashing, undoubting, reckless and yet, underneath the surface, filled with a certain uncertainty.

The music fits the cultural setting. The triple time waltz suits Howl's character and Sophie's youth. Like most Japanese animes, the art work is flawless. Being a 2 hour movie, the themes are not as deep as Japanese animes/mangas with hundreds of episodes. Given just 2 hours, the adaptation of the book could not be better.However, I feel that more focus should have been put on explaining complicated part of the story where Howl swallows a falling star (Calcifer, a fire demon) and gave Calcifer his heart to save Calcifer's life. Consequently, Calcifer is bound to Howl. I think many viewers won't understand this fully unless they watch it a second time.

957063,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000CDGVOE,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Hiyao Miyazaki came out of retirement for like the third time to do this adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' book. It was originally going to be directed by Mamoru Hosodu of Digimon(although he went on to do the awesome Summer Wars!), but bugged out early, so Miyazaki stepped in to fill in the part. Like Castle In The Sky, Miyazaki elegently fuses steampunk with magic in this romantic fantasy.Taking place in a European-like country, Sophie Hatter is a young hatmaker(convenient name!)that has a brief encounter with the bishonen sorcerer Howl. Sophie has a curse put on her by the spiteful Witch of the Waste who is jealous of Howl flirting with her. Sophie is now turned into an old version of herself, so she heads out into into the land known as the Wastes to find a way to break the curse. With the help of a living scarecrow(shades of Wizard Of Oz), Sophie makes her way to the mobile castle of Howl himself, which is powered by the fire demon Calcifur that is under Howl's service. Sophie takes on the role of Howl's housekeeper, although she can't tell him about the curse she's under. Howl on his own becomes aware of Sophie's enchantment, but also starts falling for her inner-self, just as Sophie is stricken with him. While all this is going on, a war has been escalating between Sophie's country and an opposing kingdom. Howl is called in to be of service to their king, but has set up multiple aliases to keep from being drafted. He sends Sophie to the castle to answer for him disguised as his mother, although its trap set by the royal sorceress Madame Suliman. The Witch of the Waste is caught in her trap first and has all her magic stolen from her, reducing her to an old woman. Howl rescues the both of them, and then tries to set up a new life for everyone away from the war. Suliman sends her goons out to hunt down Howl, which seems a bit wasteful of resources since she should be using them to help fight in the war going on. Howl ends up using too much of his magic though, and it causes the castle to fall apart. Sophie has to travel deep inside Howl's psyche in order to bring him back from turning into a monster from his overuse of magic. She manages to save him, and at the same time the curse on her is lifted(even though her hair is still grey). It's revealed that the scarecrow is the prince from the warring country, and returns to stop the conflict, while Sophie and Howl go to live happily ever after in their new ""castle in the sky"".The movie goes off in a different direction towards the third act than that of the original novel, plus a few things are altered like Howl being a skirtchaser, as well as less emphasis on the actual war going on around the characters. There is a real sense of romance in this movie as opposed to some of Miyazaki's others, at least in the sense of a more mature nature instead of between two children. Visually, its one of the best anime movies of the 2000s, and finely handles CGI with 2D animation. Its been met with mixed reviews, even though I believe it has a well-thought out storyline, especially for a Miyazaki film which sometimes tends to get a little muddled near the conclusion. The Disney dub is fair too, with Billy Crystal as Calcifur, even though Christain Bale is a little weak at time as Howl(especially when he uses the Batman voice).

Rivaling the early works of Disney, Miyasaki's words combine stunning imagery, rich characters and deep plots that can not only please children but impress adults with their complex deeper meanings.Howl's Moving Castle is no exception.Sofi is a young woman who seems to be living under the shadow of her more glamarous peers and family members in a region plagued by a foolish war. When she is transformed into the body of a feeble old woman by a spiteful witch, Sofi must travel to Howl's moving castle in order to seek his expertise in reversing the curse.What happens next is both unexpected and enlightening, for children's movies often feature the most mundane of plots. Not only is war presented as a terrible choice that yields no winners, but Sofi herself begins to have brief bouts of time in her former self--but only when standing up for what she believes in.Can she muster the courage to break the witch's curse on her own?Howl's Moving Castle remains one of the most underrated films that came to the US in recent years, with a disappointing box office domestically but an absolute smash over seas.

A jealous witch, one of Howl's former loves, decides to punish Sophie by turning her into an old woman. This is the starting point of my favorite Miyazaki film.  It is a love story for sure, but more than that, it is the story of how someone dealt a bad hand, handles her situation with equanimity, determination, and humor. Sophie says at one point ""the best in us blazes brightest when cirmcumstances are at their worst"". This film is an illustration of that maxim.  Jean Simmons is wonderful as the old Sophie.  Billy Crystal is equally good as Calcifer, the fire demon who is the lifeforce behind Howl's home, a castle which walks and can reside in several different cities or locales at the same time. The animation is beautiful, perhaps not on par with Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind, but lovely to look at all the same. As is usual for Miyazaki, in addition to the incredible scenery, the movie is replete with crazy contraptions and strange creatures.

957073,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B000CDGVOE,Jonathan Cohen,"[5, 6]","""Howl's Moving Castle"", the latest release from Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki, is a beguiling romantic fantasy, a foray into the wizards-and-sorcerers genre adapted from a novel by British fantasy doyenne Diana Wynne Jones. (She's as big as J.K. Rowling over there and has written over 50 books.)I'm not a fan of either style, but I was still impressed with this movie, a gigantic hit in Japan but only an art-house release over here. Unlike ""Spirited Away"" and most of Miyazaki's other work, this has a vaguely English (or maybe Swiss) setting, a world of Victorian shops and lush lakeside gardens. There are only a handful of central characters but they're distinctive and well-drawn. The heroine, Sophie, is introduced as a shy young hatmaker in her family shop, but encounters a mysterious flying castle and a hefty witch who not only draw her in but turn her into a 90-year-old lady. The movie centers on Sophie's journey between old and young, her involvement with the dashing wizard named Howl and his flying, Rube Goldberg-meets-Harry Potter castle, and Howl's assistants Markl (a little boy who dresses up like a mini-sorcerer) and Calcifer (a wisecracking talking fire).Together and on their own, they labor to break the spells upon them on the way to the promise of freedom.This sounds like a fantasy cliche, but as I've learned, Miyazaki does not do cliches. We marvel at how Sophie, one minute a wizened laundress, the next a slim young woman, can both charm and scare the pants off Howl, who can fly like the eagles one minute and cower in bed the next. Calcifer the fire is also the castle ""power plant"", while the Witch of the Waste- huge and voluptuous at first- turns on a dime into a wheezing, cigar-chomping crone. It may be a little confusing to some, but you won't find a more empathetic depiction of the very elderly in any animated- or most live-action- films than here.Disney/Pixar, which oversees all Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli films for Western audiences, has again taken great care to keep the film and images intact while making it look and sound like it was made, or at least recorded, in America. Two bona fide Hollywood doyennes, Jean Simmons (Grandma Sophie) and Lauren Bacall [!] (Witch of the Waste), join hot heartthrob Christian Bale (Howl) in the lead English voices. But who expected Billy Crystal in here? As the voice of Calcifer the Fire, that honking Long-Guy-Land accent threw me for a loop at first, yet he's a weird fit as comic balance inside the castle. Miyazaki's gifted composer/conductor Joe Hisaishi adds to the atmosphere with a simple but moody theme heard in countless ways- childlike piano at first, then vaguely-Continental and pastoral- to bring in a lovely musical background. As with ""Spirited Away"", the voices, music and images meld in a way that just grabs you even without slam-bang action or kicky slapstick. One sequence that floored me comes at the end, when the kingdom's at war and the royal capital gets strafed; it looked and felt like bombed-out London in the '40s- or maybe Hiroshima. To his credit, Miyazaki never stints on the horrors of war, and his pacifist philosophy, though naive by today's standards, is never preachy and true to the Japanese values he's so proud of.This DVD has a few extras, including a look at the American cast and their director, Pixar regular Pete Docter (Monsters Inc.). It's a real treat to see someone as legendary as Lauren Bacall lend her still-sultry voice to the weird and obese witch character. Miyazaki is also a surprise visitor to Pixar's Bay Area studio, where we learn he's an absolute deity to John Lasseter and his wonder boys. The second disc is for serious animation scholars only: the entire movie in storyboard form. If you're an anime purist, you can also watch the film in Japanese with (or without) subtitles; we learned that the Japanese version had the same actress doing Sophie in all her ages. In English, gifted young Brit Emily Mortimer (""Match Point"") played young Sophie with a prim upper-crust accent.While ""Howl's Moving Castle"" isn't quite as enchanting as ""Spirited Away"" or as playful as earlier fare like ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", and it may be a bit too Anglo-fantasy-ized for a lot of American kids (I recommend it to ""Harry Potter"" fans over 8), it's still a wonderful fantasy from one of the few-perhaps the only- people on earth who can draw romance, battles, flight, wizardry and so many other things from his own drawings into a beautiful movie. ""Howl"" deserved its Oscar nomination and, along with ""Spirited Away"", made me an instant Miyazaki follower.

957074,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000CDGVOE,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[1, 1]","With HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki takes a popular British children's book by Dianne Wyanna Jones and transforms it into yet another breathtakingly gorgeous and sumptuously animated work of art. Indeed, from the opening shot where we see the titular structure--a bizarre amalgam of iron, steam, and unexpected surprises--loom ominously out of the mist, audiences will find themselves on a roller coaster of visual delight and imagination.The story, set in a fantastical Welsh countryside, involves a young woman named Sophie who is literally swept off her feet by the handsome yet enigmatic wizard, Howl--despite warnings from her fellow friends that this ""lady-killer"" of a magician eats the hearts of young girls alike. Soon after, Sophie finds herself cursed by the jealous Witch of the Waste--where she is transformed into a ninety-year-old crone. Forced to flee from her hometown, ""Grandma"" Sophie (who occasionally reverts from old to young as the film progresses) takes refuge in Howl's fortress, where she makes a pact with a jabbering fireball known as Calcifer in order to break his own curse, and likewise, her own.The plot gets a little bit more complicated from here on out, with various side-stories that involve a war, a stern queen who wants Howl to serve in her name, and--wouldn't you know--Howl conquering his inner demons of despair and selfishness through true love. Yet this kind of complex-storytelling has been a well-known trait of Japanese animation, and should be no different here.Fans of the novel that this film is based on have argued that Miyazaki's movie is a poor interpretation of Jones' story (apparently he changed things from the original to suit his imagination). Not having read the book, I can't comment on what parts of the story have been altered or which remain faithful, but as a genuinely huge fan of Miyazaki's work, I have to say that his adaptation is a charming delight on its own ground. Probably the best way to appreciate this film is to approach it as an inspiration for a masterpiece of animation, and not as an undistorted incarnation of Jones' world.This is not to say, however, that Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is flawless--far from it. For fans spoiled by his more action-packed classics such as NAUSICAA and CASTLE IN THE SKY, this film offers little in the way of exciting set pieces. The overall story unfolds at a leisurely pace; this worked in favor of his more quieter, gentler children's tales such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, and of course the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY, but here it sometimes comes off as a bit of a detriment. Given the war subplot and a few occasional action-sequences, one would expect HOWL to at least have a grand climax. Regrettably, it concludes in a manner that is slower and more drawn-out than SPIRITED AWAY does, undermining its potential for an epic fantasy. I lay this blame, however, on myself; I had unrealistically high expectations for this film, and so I couldn't help but feel a little bit let down by the finale.Still, in spite of its pacing problems, HOWL has a lot to offer in the way of visual fiestas, characters that one can identify with, and of course, Joe Hisaishi's richly romantic underscore. It should also be noted that after viewing this movie a few more times, I have come to appreciate it for what it really is, not what I wanted it to be.  As such, I do not hesitate to recommend HOWL as yet another Miyazaki masterpiece.On another matter, I am reluctant to choose a favorite out of the Disney/Miramax/Pixar-produced English tracks for Miyazaki's movies because I've found every one of them to be of five-star quality and always a pleasure to listen to (even the ones that some folks are somewhat divided about, notably MONONOKE, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and KIKI). But for the record, Disney once again provides a very capable cast to lend their vocals to the characters and two skillful people to direct them (PIXAR's Pete Docter and Disney's own Rick Dempsey).As the enigmatic Howl, Christian Bale delivers his lines with a somewhat menacing yet strangely charming style.  Emily Mortimer is excellent as the sweet, sincere young Sophie, as is elderly Jean Simmons as her 90-year-old counterpart. This triumvirate is amply supported by Lauren Bacall, who is amazingly menacing--and later on grandmotherly--as the Witch of the Waste, Josh Hutcherson as the childlike sorcerer Markl (who can make himself look older than he really is), Blythe Danner as the icy Madam Suliman.  As a nice little treat, longtime Anime voiceover (and huge Miyazaki fan) Crispin Freeman has a brief cameo at the end. (You can also hear him play various roles in the English version of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.)Yet as with all the Disney/Miyazaki dubs, there is always one actor who will steal the spotlight from the others (not that this is a bad thing; I don't mind!), and this time it's the ever-amusing Billy Crystal. As the wily fire-demon Calcifer (who reminded me a lot of Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI in both sarcasm and tone), Crystal scorches up the scenery and provides all the best moments as well as laughs (hey, he's hot).And to give further credit where it's due, the Disney DVD release looks--and sounds--absolutely fantastic. Extras have never really been a strong selling point of Disney's Ghibli DVD releases, yet this one has some interesting tidbits:  in addition to the expected voice talent featurette, trailers, and storyboards, there is a lengthy interview from dub co-director Docter as well as a twenty-minute long featurette where we see Miyazaki attend PIXAR studios, presenting John Lasseter with a gigantic Cat Bus from TOTORO.All in all, this is yet another stellar treat from Hayao Miyazaki with an equally fantastic dub and a reasonably good DVD release provided by Disney.

She is the witch infamous for scarry, witch of the Waste.She turned to be aged like a granma by the witch's curse.She's got to be leaving her house as she turned grandma and couldn't tell anyone about it.At the same time, the prince of the neighboring county was missingIt caused that the current situation of the nation inevitable from a war against the neighboring kingdom.She left and didn't have anywhere else to go.She met a moving scare crow in the waste and he helped her find where to live.It was the moving castle. there seemed nobody inside when she's coming in.There's a fire and it made her cozy and Sophy had a nice rest sitting on a chair in front of the fire.Someone started talking to her while she's resting. It was the fire.The fire was a creature who is moving the castle.He talked to Sophy that he's been thinking that he would need some help to break up the spell.Because of the spell, he had to work for Howl.The fire told her that if Sophy could break up the spell on him, he will break up the spell on her.The fire had been looking for somebody to let him free, that's why he let her in even though he has magic power to lock the door to prevent her from coming in.In the next morning, someone knocked the door and a boy came down from the stair.Markel suspected if she was a witch.After a while, Howl came back home when Sophy are cocking breakfasts.And Sophy found out that a nice guy that she met on the way to her sister was Howl.Howl found that Sophy has something like note from the witch of the waste.The note brought a curse from her and it helps her find where Howl is.Howl's been always chased by the witch of the waste and fled from her. The fire has helped him flee with his magic.Sophy began to work as a jenniter at Howl's house.Around the time the leader of their country has required every witch and wizzard to report as the leader needed their help after the war began.The moving castle let Sophy feel pieceful by taking her somewhere which has a nice view.On the other hand, Howl got feeling sad by the terrible war.He's been interrupting the both of the attacks in the war.One day Howl asked Sophy to report to the King instead of him.And She left for the palace. While she's walking the witch of the waste passed by Sophy.Both of them eventually went to inside of the palace together.Sophy was guided the way to the leader by a boy and met the leader without the witch of the waste.After a while The witch of the waste was brought in by a boy.Soon Howl appeared to help Sophy escape from the leader.They escaped from the leader with the witch of the waste and the leader's errands dog.A part of the castle was corrupsed as the plane that Sophy operated landed inside.After Howl's back, it was fixed and he made inside bigger and nicer for Sophy, Markel and new comers.This time Howl was chased by the leader.Howl led Sophy to his hideway, Beautiful place.After a while, Sophy's mother suddenly visited and reported her that she got re-married and suggested that she lived in her mother's house.The war got worse and finally the planes began to drop the bomb in their town.Howl tried to stop the attack. While Sophy tried to stop him.Sophy broke the castle and gave something for the fire to go to Howl by the fire's power.The fire's power to take them to Howl was interrupted by the witch of the waste.Sophy has fallen into the past world with just the dog.After back from the world She found Howl who was waiting for her.They flew to place where the others were and Howl passed out just after they arrived.Sophy asked the witch of the waste to give up something to help Howl and the fire.The fire's spell was broken.THe moving scare crow turned out that he was princess of the neighboring contry.He promised to quit this war and left.The war was gone and they seems to be hahppy.The color of this animation is beautiful.The original voice actor of Howl is a celebrety, Takuya Kimura who has higher tone voice than the American'sHe is a childish wizzard, but if he had deep voice, you could feel he's more matture.The original voice actress of Sophy is an actress,mitsuko by-show known as Sakura who is an elder sister of Tora san in the films, Tora san. Sophy should have acted by two women like English version. Sophy's English voice actresses had much better performances.I like Markel. He's so cute. The voice actress, Ryunosuke Kamiki is now already aged about 20.The witch of the waste played by Akihiro Miwa (akihiro maruyama) who has lots of his admirers.He was really gourgeous guy when he was young, now he looks like a witch with yellow hair.He also played a wolf who raised San(princess) in an other film titled the princess mononoke.Howl's moving castle is my favorite of the Miyazaki's

957082,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B000CDGVOE,kaduzy,"[7, 8]","This is yet another beautifully rendered Miyazaki masterpiece about a wizard called Howl (and sometimes Jenkins . . . and sometimes Pendragon) who lives in a castle that moves across the moors (or the ""waste"" as it's called in this world).  It can also move between cities, all through a magically color-coded door.  A young girl named Sophie starts the tale.  She works in a hat shop and is very shy and rather drab and very afraid of adventure.  However, she winds up getting one whether she likes it or not when a witch puts a spell on her, turning her into an old woman.  She goes to Howl in an attempt to get the spell taken off, but since part of the spell's magic is that she can't say she's under one, she has no choice but to remain with him in the guise of a cleaning lady until she can figure out how to get rid of it.  However, she soon practically forgets all about her own spell when she realizes that Howl is trapped in a sinister spell of his own -- one that may kill him.  Sophie is the only one who can find a way to save him, and somewhere along the way, she learns how to save herself.Features the voices of Christian Bale as Howl (He even SOUNDS hot -- how does he manage that???), Blythe Danner, legendary actress Jean Simmons as Old Sophie, up and coming Emily Mortimer (Match Point) as Young Sophie, and Lauren Bacall as the witch.  It's based on a book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones.  Both are very good, but in different ways.  The book is more lighthearted and has far more subplots (and at times is frankly a bit confusing).  It's a bit hard to find -- I had to order it at Half.com myself to avoid paying through the nose for it, because most stores don't carry it, and neither did Amazon.com at the time.  It's worth checking out if you can manage to hunt a copy down.  And the movie is a DON'T MISS, for sure.  Miyazaki's subplot about the war is not in the book; he invented it to help make the story more poignant, and it works -- this is another film that can be described literally as magical.  You just have to see it to believe it, and believing is bliss.Check this one out, and see for yourself how it was robbed of the Best Animated Feature Oscar.

957083,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,B000CDGVOE,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[2, 7]","Before I start this review let me just state that I love Miyazaki films, and in this case I did what many people swear up and down you shouldn't do, namely I read the book before watching the movie so that I could compare and contrast... where to begin. I think at this point it would be faster to tell you which elements from the book have been kept vs. which elements from the story have been changed...but I'll do my best.First, the similarities...-There was a girl named Sophie who lived and worked in a hate shop who came under a curse from the Witch of the Waste. She did age to her later years and left home to travel, where she came across a scarecrow. After this she did find the castle lived in by Michael (whose name in the film is changed to Markl) and the Wizard, Howl, and the fire demon, Calcifer.-Howl does have a curse on him and Calcifer is intrical to the curse and also to Howl's survival.-The scene where Howl dyes his hair and throws the tantrum is spot on in comparison to the book.-They do move house at one point and Calcifer must be removed from his hearth.-The many portaled door does lead to various places... Porthaven, Kingsbury, the Waste outside Market chipping (Sophie's home town) and to Howl's home in Wales. In the film the latter one lead to the wreckage from the war.Ok that's about where the similarities stop...now the differences...-For one thing, Howl's curse does not affect him. It does not change his appearance to resemble that of a bird, and it never really is an issue that he is cursed until he starts fulfilling all of the necessary parts to enable the curse on his head. The curse was cast by the Witch of the Waste, but Howl did start it when he caught a star in his youth (Calcifer) and combined the star with his heart.. Something that Miyazaki went into greater detail then Jones.-The curse was not brought onto Howl's head by Sophie giving it to him from the Witch of the Waste. He actually attained it from his nephew Neil who got it from his teacher, Miss Angorian, as a class assignment, which of course was just her way of getting it to him at his weakest point. Now, Michael actually unearthed it, because at some point it got exchanged with the spell he was supposed to be studying and he and Sophie spend some time trying to collect the elements of the ""spell"" before Howl realizes what it is and that they are only quickening  his doom.-Sophie did stand the scarecrow up and breath life into him by talking to him, but after that she was scared of him. He ended up trying to get her attention because he was the Prince under an enchantment, but every time he tried to get close to her she (and the other people in the castle) did their best to keep him out and away, thinking he intended to harm them.-Sophie's appearance doesn't alter from youth to aging woman. This was confusing to me, as there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this in the film, no lynch pin as to why she suddenly looks younger, unless it ties into her feelings for Howl... that really seems to be the only connection...when she's in love she flashes younger... I don't even think she gained her youth back in the end of the book even though the contract with Calicifer was broken... at least there was no mention of Sophie being young suddenly.-Michael's name has been changed to Markl in the film, but that is not the only difference. Michael's age has also changed. He's a young man in the book, I believe 15, and he is in love with Sophie's sister Martha, who was disguised as her other sister Lettie.-In the same vain Howl is in love with Sophie's sister Lettie, who is disguised as Martha... but Howl knows that she is Lettie because he can see through the enchantment. He spends a good time pursuing her in his enchanted suits (meant to aid in his charming young ladies) and his guitar until his heart is stolen away from Miss Angorian.. Who doesn't even appear in the film.-Ok, the whole love sub plot at all... um, they didn't fall in love in the book... Howl was a lecher who was pursuing numerous women and in the book he first fell in love with Sophie's sister, Lettie, and then his nephew Neil's teacher, Miss Angorian. Sophie ends up living with him in the end and that's about it. There was no ""walking on air"" scene in the beginning as a prelude to the two falling into romantic love...there was no feelings at all beyond that of familial.-The sub plot of the war in exchange for Howl's amorous pursuits... Hmmm... This may have been done for two reasons. One was so that Howl can fly about, showing off his bird form, and make himself look more sympathetic all around because he gives a damn about something besides himself. Two, Miyazaki loves animating huge air ships and mechanical things, tanks and what not... what's a Miyazaki film without an air battle? Well, the war added this typical Miyazaki element... except that there was very little war sub plot in the book. It was mentioned in snatches but not made that much of beyond snippets of conversations about Porthaven and Kinsbury and the armies. It was so little hinted at that I actually did not pick up on it that much on my inital reading until I went back (after viewing the film) and rechecked some things. It seems like they exchanged the magnitude of the lecherous plot with the war plot to make it more dynamic and take time away from Howl`s obsessions about himself...but that was part of the beauty of the book was that they weren't that technologically advanced (seemingly), it was more about the magic than the might. And, I'm sorry, but Howl being a vain and selfish man was one of the reasons I loved him. His tantrums and drama had me giggling like crazy, and if he weren't such a drama queen he would have been uninteresting and...well.. Like Howl was in the movie, a touch flat.-Howl was not conscripted to aid the King's in the war... he had different duties from each one that never quite seemed explained until you knew that he had to find the Prince Justin who had gone missing.-Howl's teacher was named Mrs. Pentstemmon, and she and Howl loved each other like mother and son. In fact when she dies Howl attends the funeral in disguise true, but he mourns her for some time afterwards. In the movie her named was Mrs. Suliman (who was talked at much in the book but ended up being cursed in the end) and she took both the Witch of the Waste and Mrs. Angorian's places in the latter part of the film as the villain. In the book the witch did not come to live with them and, though she wasn't the ultimate bad guy in the end she did cause them all quite a bit of grief.Ok, I know there was more, but I will have to reread the book and see the film again in order to catalogue them all. The last 100 pages I read in one day and then I watched the film in the evening, so some of the details are fuzzy. I do plan on reading the book again soon. It was wonderful and I think it's going to become one of my ""comfort"" books, as my friend Amy likes to call them. That being said, I have very mixed feelings about this adaptation of such a wonderful book. Obviously, I adored the book, it was a tremendous treat... and even though there were all of these differences between the two I actually enjoyed the film as well. Perhaps I would have liked it more had it been a touch more faithful to the book, but this is always the issue with adaptations, you either get an exact duplicate or creative license. Well, Miyazaki is one of my favourite creative minds to date, so I always enjoy his work... and this did have all of the elements of a great Miyazaki film. The animation and the scenery is gorgeous, the relationships with the characters is wonderful... the storyline, even though it is severely altered from the book, is interesting, although a bit... off. The thing I wish he would have kept in was all of those little touches that made the book so wonderful and made me think it was a perfect thing for Miyazaki to adapt... there are little nuances peppered throughout the book that seem so indicative of him to begin with had I not known he was adapting it I would have thought he should have... however he left out a lot of the good stuff that made this book so wonderful. I'm torn, I really am.I find I will have to consider the film and the book as two completely separate entities in order to enjoy both of them. Fans of his work will love this movie, as it is visually stunning and one of the best works he has put out, but I cannot get over some of the alterations and for me this brings the movie from a perfect to less than perfect. 4 out of 5 stars... for now. I'm sure I'll learn to love the film in time, but now I am still too intimate with the book to love the film.",4,Just shy of perfect.,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,8720,"['start', 'review', 'let',

957088,A15DJESYCCHNT7,B000CDGVOE,Kelly C. Shaw,"[3, 3]","Howl's Moving Castle is Hayao Miyazaki's new film, based on the Diana Wynne Jones' 1986 novel. The Japanese Miyazaki is undisputedly the world's greatest living animator, but his popularity in America has hovered around ""cult"" since the release of 1999's Princess Mononoke and 2001's Spirited Away. He won the Oscar for the latter film, but greater recognition has eluded him in America, while he has continued to break box-office records in his home country (Spirited Away is the #1 grossing film in Japan, just ahead of Titanic). Miyazaki's lack of box-office success in America can be attributed to the idiosyncratic, non-Hollywood quality of his films; and his stories, because of their attention to detail, unravel slowly --at least for animated films -- and their flights of fancy -- sometimes surreal and frightening, always awe-inspiring -- are too unfamiliar for a multiplex audience to easily digest.Howl, at least visually, shares all of the wonderful characteristics of Miyazaki's prior films -- there are many images from Howl that I will not soon forget, particularly the piecemeal construction of the moving castle and the character Howl's bird-like transformation. But coming after the near-perfect Spirited Away, the story of Howl leaves a bit to be desired, especially in its cliche-ridden central character Sophie. At the film's onset, Sophie is a young girl lacking self-esteem. Her life is changed after a flirtatious encounter with Howl, which causes the jealous Witch of the Waste to transform her into an elderly woman. The elderly Sophie travels to Howl's moving castle, in hope of removing the Witch's curse, which is where the central action of the story ensues. Ultimately, the film ends abruptly with Sophie learning to love herself and the literally-heartless Howl, a too-familiar turn of plot that doesn't do the rest of the film justice.Howl's Moving Castle, while imperfect, contains many qualities that could only have come from the imagination of the cinema's greatest fantasist. The dreamy way the story unfolds, the warm camaraderie of the characters, and the mix of haunting and enchanting images -- Howl is clearly the work of Hayao Miyazaki. It's a movie best appreciated on a purely visual, sensual level, and even though there are character and plot shortcomings, it's a movie I will certainly return to over the years, as the lived-in feel of the moving castle is a place that will surely occupy my imagination for years to come.This is Miyazaki's most audience-friendly film since Kiki's Delivery Service (1988) and a good introduction to his unique brand of storytelling. Whether you're a diehard Miyazaki fan or a tyro, Howl's Moving Castle is a must-see movie.",4,Another gem from the master,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2707,"['Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'new', 'film', 'based', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', '1986', 'novel', 'Japanese', 'Miyazaki', 'undisputedly', 'world', 'greatest', 'living', 'animator', 'popularity', 'America', 'hovered', 'cult', 'release', '1999', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', '2001', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'won', 'Oscar', 'latter', 'film', 'greater', 'recognition', 'eluded', 'America', 'continued', 'break', 'box-office', 'records', 'home', 'country', 'Spirited', 'Away', '1', 'grossing', 'film', 'Japan', 'just', 'ahead', 'Titanic', 'Miyazaki', 'lack', 'box-office', 'success', 'America', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'idiosyncratic', 'non-Hollywood', 'quality', 'films', 'stories', 'attention', 'detail', 'unravel', 'slowly', 'least', 'animated', 'films', 'flights', 'fancy', 'sometimes', 'surreal', 'frightening', 'always', 'awe-inspiring', 'are', 'too', 'unfamiliar', 'multiplex', 'audience', 'easily', 'digest.Howl', 'least', 'visually', 'shares', 'wonderful', 'characteristics', 'Miyazaki', 'prior', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'images', 'Howl', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'particularly', 'piecemeal', 'construction', 'moving', 'castle', 'character', 'Howl', 'bird-like', 'transformation', 'coming', 'near-perfect', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'story', 'Howl', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', 'cliche-ridden', 'central', 'character', 'Sophie', 'film', 'onset', 'Sophie', 'young', 'girl', 'lacking', 'self-esteem', 'life', 'changed', 'flirtatious', 'encounter', 'Howl', 'jealous', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'transform', 'elderly', 'woman', 'elderly', 'Sophie', 'travels', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'hope', 'removing', 'Witch', 'curse', 'where', 'central', 'action', 'story', 'ensues', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'abruptly', 'Sophie', 'learning', 'love', 'literally-heartless', 'Howl', 'too-familiar', 'turn', 'plot', ""n't"", 'do', 'rest', 'film', 'justice.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'imperfect', 'many', 'qualities', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'imagination', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'fantasist', 'dreamy', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds', 'warm', 'camaraderie', 'characters', 'mix', 'haunting', 'enchanting', 'images', 'Howl', 'clearly', 'work', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'movie', 'best', 'appreciated', 'purely', 'visual', 'sensual', 'level', 'even', 'are', 'character', 'plot', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'return', 'years', 'lived-in', 'feel', 'moving', 'castle', 'place', 'will', 'surely', 'occupy', 'imagination', 'years', 'come.This', 'Miyazaki', 'most', 'audience-friendly', 'film', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', '1988', 'good', 'introduction', 'unique', 'brand', 'storytelling', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'tyro', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'must-see', 'movie']",N/A
957089,A1CYV655X6LBVK,B000CDGVOE,Kendrick,"[0, 0]","Howl's Moving Castle tells the story of a young woman named Sophie, who owns a hat store in a European-looking town. War is coming to the kingdom. It so happens that Sophie meets Howl, a wizard, and the Witch of the Waste is immediately jealous that Howl seems to have taken an interest in her. The witch is not only Howl's nemesis, but someone who tried to win his heart in her younger years. The witch casts a curse on Sophie, making her an old woman. Not knowing what else to do, though feeling more comfortable in her skin as an old woman than as a young one, Sophie ventures into the Waste to look for a way to remove the spell. It's in the Waste that she comes across Howls' moving castle, a pile of what looks like industrial scraps cobbled together on four mechanical legs, and smuggles her way in.We soon learn that the king has summoned all the sorcerers in the land to fight on behalf of the kingdom. Howl is a pacifist at heart and interferes in the war by transforming himself into a large bird of prey and fights off strange creatures (it's all quite confusing). Paralleling this war story is the budding relationship between Howl and Sophie while the storyline of the Witch of the Waste whimpers behind, especially after she loses her power. In what felt like a rushed ending, Sophie saves Howl in an unexpected way.After watching Howl's Moving Castle, I was tempted not to write a review because the film is hard to get your mind around and arguably lacks a central storyline. In the beginning, you think the tale will be a typical good versus evil, with Howl on the side of good and the Witch of the Waste his arch-nemesis. But if you know anything about Hayao Miyazaki, the director, you know that his characters are famous for their moral ambiguity, with so-called ""evil"" characters being either misunderstood or victims of certain vices. Howl's Moving Castle could be a love story, but that doesn't seem to be the backbone of the movie, though it does develop the characters. There's the issue of pacifism and the evils of war, but that acts as a backdrop.There is also a plethora of themes to consider, none of which take center stage. These include people not being what they seem, beauty being a matter of the heart (Sophie is a plain-looking girl), and the transformative nature of love.What I've concluded is that the story hinges on the fascinating juxtaposition of the mechanical and the magical. Howl's Moving Castle is set in an odd world where mechanized warfare is paired with sorcery and Merlin lives during the Industrial Revolution. Howl's castle is in itself an amalgam of these parts--part machine, part magical. The moving castle doesn't play a critical role in the storyline, but takes center stage merely because Miyazaki's creation is a wonder to behold, with his maniacal attention to detail. The narrative fails to meet the enrapturing quality of Spirited Away, but the artistry and intricacies of its magical world is up to par.[This review was published previously on Schaeffer's Ghost ([...]",4,Miyazaki continues to impress,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,3036,"['Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Sophie', 'who', 'hat', 'store', 'European-looking', 'town', 'War', 'coming', 'kingdom', 'so', 'Sophie', 'meets', 'Howl', 'wizard', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'immediately', 'jealous', 'Howl', 'have', 'taken', 'interest', 'witch', 'not', 'only', 'Howl', 'nemesis', 'someone', 'who', 'tried', 'win', 'heart', 'younger', 'years', 'witch', 'curse', 'Sophie', 'making', 'old', 'woman', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'feeling', 'more', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'old', 'woman', 'young', 'one', 'Sophie', 'ventures', 'Waste', 'look', 'way', 'remove', 'spell', 'Waste', 'Howls', 'moving', 'castle', 'pile', 'what', 'industrial', 'scraps', 'cobbled', 'together', 'four', 'mechanical', 'legs', 'way', 'in.We', 'soon', 'learn', 'king', 'summoned', 'sorcerers', 'land', 'fight', 'behalf', 'kingdom', 'Howl', 'pacifist', 'heart', 'interferes', 'war', 'transforming', 'large', 'bird', 'prey', 'fights', 'off', 'strange', 'creatures', 'quite', 'confusing', 'Paralleling', 'war', 'story', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Howl', 'Sophie', 'storyline', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'whimpers', 'especially', 'power', 'what', 'felt', 'rushed', 'ending', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'unexpected', 'way.After', 'watching', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'was', 'tempted', 'not', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'hard', 'get', 'mind', 'arguably', 'central', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'think', 'tale', 'will', 'be', 'typical', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'Howl', 'side', 'good', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'arch-nemesis', 'know', 'anything', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'director', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'famous', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'so-called', 'evil', 'characters', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'victims', 'certain', 'vices', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'could', 'be', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'backbone', 'movie', 'develop', 'characters', 'issue', 'pacifism', 'evils', 'war', 'backdrop.There', 'also', 'plethora', 'themes', 'consider', 'none', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'include', 'people', 'not', 'being', 'what', 'seem', 'beauty', 'being', 'matter', 'heart', 'Sophie', 'plain-looking', 'girl', 'transformative', 'nature', 'love.What', ""'ve"", 'concluded', 'story', 'hinges', 'fascinating', 'juxtaposition', 'mechanical', 'magical', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'set', 'odd', 'world', 'where', 'mechanized', 'warfare', 'paired', 'sorcery', 'Merlin', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'Howl', 'castle', 'amalgam', 'parts', 'part', 'machine', 'part', 'magical', 'moving', 'castle', ""n't"", 'play', 'critical', 'role', 'storyline', 'center', 'stage', 'merely', 'Miyazaki', 'creation', 'wonder', 'behold', 'maniacal', 'attention', 'detail', 'narrative', 'fails', 'meet', 'enrapturing', 'quality', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'artistry', 'intricacies', 'magical', 'world', 'up', 'par', '[', 'review', 'was', 'published', 'previously', 'Schaeffer', 'Ghost', '[', ']']",N/A

957092,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000CDGVOE,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 5]","In a time where computers are taking over the world of cinematic animation it is truly fantastic to be able to experience meticulous and the hard work of animators that still utilize old techniques.  These illustration techniques have been used by director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli for decades.  This time they come up with another extraordinary tale that follows the foot steps of Miyazaki's previous films such as Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds (1984), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Whisper of the Heart (1995), and Oscar winner Spirited Away (2001).  In these brilliant films the audience could be mesmerized by fantastic adventures with unusual flying machines, magic, and a heroic girl that overcomes the odds while teaching the audience a valuable lesson.  Despite following the foot steps of previous films Miyazaki continues to tell a captivating tale of vanity, pride, and selfishness in the magical Howl's Moving Castle.Sofi (Emily Mortimer's voice), a young diligent woman, sits patiently at the desk where she creates hats for customers while locomotives steams by her window.  Others seem to be preoccupied with their looks and trivial matters while she closes up the shop and leaves in solitude.  On her journey home she decides to visit a friend, as she walks through an ally due to a current festival that floods the streets with people.  Two soldiers stop her with penetrating questions, but she is saved by a mysterious man who uses magic to get the soldiers to move away.  The audience later learns that the man is Howl (Christian Bale's voice), or Hauru in the original Japanese version, who decides to escort her.  Suddenly, they find themselves being chased by threatening shapeless creatures that bring to mind some of Salvador Dali's bizarre and surreal artworks.  Nonetheless, Howl gets them out of trouble with the help of a little magic, as he lands her safely.The story takes the audience through an animated roller coaster journey that swiftly speeds up and does not slow down until the end.  Several surprising turns and drops are to be expected, as the magic and fantasy sets no boundaries of what can happen.  Later on the same evening, Sofi gets a rude visitor who is no other than the grossly obese Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall's voice) who throws a curse on her.  The curse turns her into a 90 year old woman voiced by Jean Simmons.  In misery Sofi seeks solitude and a way to reverse the curse in the mountains away form her village.  She discovers the difficulty of growing old and quickly acclimates herself in her new degenerative body. When stumbling on the rocks of the mountains she notices a stick, which actually is the end of a scarecrow.  However, it is a magical scarecrow who she names Turnip Head, as he has a turnip as a head.  Turnip Head helps her find shelter in Howl's Moving Castle where she meets the fire demon Calcifer (Billy Crystal's voice).The choice of seeking shelter in the moving castle leads her on a wondrous adventure, as she tries to find a way to cure her curse.  On this journey she discovers the vanity in which Howl lives along with and many of the other characters.  Unfortunately, according to some other websites that discuss the film, the dubbing of the voices from Japanese to English does not give the genuine feel that the characters should offer, which instead makes much of the story more amusing than enlightening.  There is also some similarity with the Wizard of Oz, as the film uses a scarecrow and the missing heart as a symbol for cowardice.  Nonetheless, the message of vanity, pride, and selfishness in regards to affection and love can still be easily extracted from Miyazaki's fantasy tale.Miyazaki uses animation in order to express his artistic side, and in Howl's Moving Castle the audience can truly experience the art of animation.  Several scenes have strong symbolism and visual analogies to what is desired in our contemporary society that on frequent occasions discriminates people due to their age, illness, and beauty.  Some examples of the symbols in this film are the asthmatic and overweight dog, the grossly obese Witch, and of course Sofi's aging.  In addition, Miyazaki illustrates the desirable and attractive, which might come across with awkwardness and humor.  Some of these are the riches that Howl has in his bedroom and the accessories that Sofi stitches onto the hats.  If one pays attention to some of the scenes, one can discover several eyes, which here function as a symbol for people's awareness of others people's visual judgment of self.  Thus, underneath the surface Howl's Moving Castle deals with a contemporary issue that is told in the light of a fairy tale, as people have an increasing need for cosmetic surgery, working out in the gyms, and to keep thin.  In the end, one cannot do more than be bewildered and amazed by Miyazaki's unique talent to freely express himself through magnificent animation, which will leave many thinking and others entertained.",5,Unique Fairy Tale in the True Spirit of Miyazaki...,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,5017,"['time', 'where', 'computers', 'are', 'taking', 'world', 'cinematic', 'animation', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'be', 'able', 'experience', 'meticulous', 'hard', 'work', 'animators', 'still', 'utilize', 'old', 'techniques', 'illustration', 'techniques', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'decades', 'time', 'come', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'tale', 'foot', 'steps', 'Miyazaki', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Nausica', 'auml', 'Valley', 'Winds', '1984', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', '1989', 'Whisper', 'Heart', '1995', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Spirited', 'Away', '2001', 'brilliant', 'films', 'audience', 'could', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'fantastic', 'adventures', 'unusual', 'flying', 'machines', 'magic', 'heroic', 'girl', 'odds', 'teaching', 'audience', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'following', 'foot', 'steps', 'previous', 'films', 'Miyazaki', 'tell', 'captivating', 'tale', 'vanity', 'pride', 'selfishness', 'magical', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle.Sofi', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'voice', 'young', 'diligent', 'woman', 'patiently', 'desk', 'where', 'hats', 'customers', 'locomotives', 'steams', 'window', 'Others', 'seem', 'be', 'preoccupied', 'looks', 'trivial', 'matters', 'shop', 'solitude', 'journey', 'home', 'visit', 'friend', 'ally', 'due', 'current', 'festival', 'streets', 'people', 'Two', 'soldiers', 'stop', 'penetrating', 'questions', 'saved', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'magic', 'get', 'soldiers', 'move', 'away', 'audience', 'later', 'man', 'Howl', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'voice', 'Hauru', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'who', 'escort', 'Suddenly', 'find', 'being', 'chased', 'threatening', 'shapeless', 'creatures', 'bring', 'mind', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'bizarre', 'surreal', 'artworks', 'Nonetheless', 'Howl', 'trouble', 'help', 'little', 'magic', 'safely.The', 'story', 'audience', 'animated', 'roller', 'coaster', 'journey', 'swiftly', 'up', 'not', 'slow', 'down', 'end', 'Several', 'surprising', 'turns', 'drops', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'sets', 'boundaries', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'Later', 'same', 'evening', 'Sofi', 'rude', 'visitor', 'who', 'other', 'grossly', 'obese', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'voice', 'who', 'curse', 'curse', '90', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'voiced', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'misery', 'Sofi', 'solitude', 'way', 'reverse', 'curse', 'mountains', 'away', 'form', 'village', 'difficulty', 'growing', 'old', 'quickly', 'new', 'degenerative', 'body', 'When', 'stumbling', 'rocks', 'mountains', 'stick', 'actually', 'end', 'scarecrow', 'However', 'magical', 'scarecrow', 'who', 'Turnip', 'Head', 'turnip', 'head', 'Turnip', 'Head', 'find', 'shelter', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'where', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'voice', '.The', 'choice', 'seeking', 'shelter', 'moving', 'castle', 'wondrous', 'adventure', 'find', 'way', 'cure', 'curse', 'journey', 'vanity', 'Howl', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'according', 'other', 'websites', 'discuss', 'film', 'dubbing', 'voices', 'Japanese', 'English', 'not', 'give', 'genuine', 'feel', 'characters', 'should', 'offer', 'instead', 'much', 'story', 'more', 'amusing', 'enlightening', 'also', 'similarity', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'film', 'scarecrow', 'missing', 'heart', 'symbol', 'cowardice', 'Nonetheless', 'message', 'vanity', 'pride', 'selfishness', 'regards', 'affection', 'love', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'easily', 'extracted', 'Miyazaki', 'fantasy', 'tale.Miyazaki', 'animation', 'order', 'express', 'artistic', 'side', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'audience', 'can', 'truly', 'experience', 'art', 'animation', 'Several', 'scenes', 'have', 'strong', 'symbolism', 'visual', 'analogies', 'what', 'desired', 'contemporary', 'society', 'frequent', 'occasions', 'people', 'due', 'age', 'illness', 'beauty', 'examples', 'symbols', 'film', 'are', 'asthmatic', 'overweight', 'dog', 'grossly', 'obese', 'Witch', 'course', 'Sofi', 'aging', 'addition', 'Miyazaki', 'desirable', 'attractive', 'might', 'come', 'awkwardness', 'humor', 'are', 'riches', 'Howl', 'bedroom', 'accessories', 'Sofi', 'hats', 'one', 'attention', 'scenes', 'one', 'can', 'discover', 'several', 'eyes', 'here', 'function', 'symbol', 'people', 'awareness', 'others', 'people', 'visual', 'judgment', 'self', 'Thus', 'surface', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'deals', 'contemporary', 'issue', 'told', 'light', 'fairy', 'tale', 'people', 'have', 'increasing', 'need', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'working', 'out', 'gyms', 'keep', 'thin', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'more', 'be', 'bewildered', 'amazed', 'Miyazaki', 'unique', 'talent', 'freely', 'express', 'magnificent', 'animation', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'thinking', 'others', 'entertained']",N/A

957094,A2W4BX2P3AKDIC,B000CDGVOE,K McK,"[7, 8]","First of all, I need to mention that the three-star rating has more to do with my frustration with the extra features and interviews on this disc, than with the movie itself.The movie itself is visually great, as are all of Miyazaki's movies. I was a bit taken aback since I'd read the book the movie was based on (more on this later) about 2 months before seeing the movie. It was as if Miyazaki just read the first third of the book, then put the book down and wrote his own story. The second two thirds of the movie bear no resemblance to the book whatsoever, either in plot or characterization. In some ways, I think this is a good thing - some aspects of the book's plot wouldn't translate too well to movie format. I did like the book's plot better, although it was enjoyable watching Howl the bird. :)Then I started watching the interviews, and sat through a half an hour of Miyazaki getting praised for coming up with such ORIGINAL ideas (like a girl who comes into her own after being cursed with age, or a moving castle, or a door which opens to different cities depending on the way the doorknob is turned). While Miyazaki did take a LOT of creative license, and the movie is definitely a Miyazaki work... all of the specific ideas that I just listed SHOULD have been credited to Diana Wynne Jones, who published the book in 1986. I sat through interview after interview, waiting for SOME mention of the fact that these creative ideas had come from a children's book by the same name, but it never happened. It's as if the movie makers are completely unaware that there had been a book before the movie. And I just don't like it when credit is not given where credit is due.If it weren't for my frustration with the interviews, I probably would be giving this DVD four stars instead of three... I did enjoy the movie, and once I accepted the fact that Miyazaki had taken the basic story elements from the book and then written his OWN plot, I thought that there were many good things about the movie.

957095,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B000CDGVOE,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 2]","As an honest movie-watcher, and an appreciator of a good story, I love the works of Studio Ghibli.  They always produce beautiful movies with lovable characters and interesting plots.However, I'm also a faithful Christian who notices when something seems likely to cause moral or religious confusion.  These two sides of myself have occasionally forced me to give Ghibli movies an imperfect grade, even when I really enjoyed them (and aside from one, which was too confusing, I've enjoyed all the ones I've seen.)However, I feel I would be doing this movie a disservice if I tried to look at it through both of those lenses at once, so instead, I'll give my movielover's thoughts, followed by my thoughts as a Christian.This movie is more than a little confusing at times, because like many Ghibli films, it often communicates nonverbally.  When large, black shapes start popping out of the walls, there's no explanation for it any deeper than ""magic bad guys,"" and even many of the main characters are a little hard to comprehend the real motives of, most notably Howl himself.On the whole, however, the movie comes off as a stunningly-beautiful fairy tale.  The side-characters are fun and likable, the main characters mysterious and interesting, and there's always the sense that there's a lot more to learn about them; right up to the moment the movie ends.  Magic is cast, spells are broken, there's a war to struggle through, a happy ending to reach, and the soul of an innocent boy to redeem.The main character; Sophie, is cursed very early on in the film, and it takes a while for her to understand what kind of curse it is, and what needs to be done to break it.  I'm sure everyone will have their own theories on that, since it's not stated outright.The relationship between Sophie and Howl comes off as a sort of odd retelling of Beauty and the Beast, except that beauty, in this case, is cursed to look like an old woman, and the beast is uncommonly pretty-looking most of the time.  Ultimately, both curses must be broken, and a happy ending attained, and as in most fairy tales, the characters labor through times of suffering and are ultimately rewarded with family and love; the perfect fairy tale formula.I think I should also say a word about the costuming, which may be an odd term to use when talking about an animated feature, but so be it.  I loved how the characters dressed; all the characters.  It's an alternate-world, sort-of-period-piece, and has its own style of dress, utterly different from the way we dress today, and that, in this case, is a very good thing.  By itself, the modesty and otherness of this one aspect of the film roped me in and kept me watching steadily until the very end.However, as a Christian, I think this movie is likely to confuse young children; not because of all the spells and magic; they're always depicted as causing problems, and never really solve them.  The real reason why I think this movie would religiously-confuse young children is because of one badly-used word; demon.I could talk for an hour about the various words in Japanese used to represent monsters of various types; oni, youkai, akki, etc...  However, the one used in this film is ""akuma"" which is correctly translated as ""demon.""However, the problem is that the ""demons"" in this film are not nearly as evil as the word ""akuma"" implies.  Calcifer, in particular, is one of the main characters, and is supposed to be a demon, but in practice, is mainly a cute lick of flame played quite nicely by Billy Crystal.  He's a bit of a pest, but acts more like a naughty child than a malicious evil spirit, and that might be confusing to young children, who are still learning the ins and outs of their real religion.Just to be clear, however, this is not the fault of any mistranslation.  ""Akuma"" implies something horribly evil in the same way ""demon"" does.  It's just that neither word seems to apply well to Calcifer.As a Christian, I believe firmly in the existence of demons, and that taking them lightly can be a dangerous thing to do.

Howl accepts her presence as a nuisance but too difficult to evict.As she becomes a more accepted part of the castle, Sophie begins to learn why Howl roams and puts out his own fiercesome rumors, and why the goons of the witch of the waste haunt them.In summary, watch the movie, but please!

957103,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CDGVOE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Hauru no ugoku shiro"" (""Howl's Moving Castle"") runs too long.  There is a point where I was feeling like things were wrapping up, but there proved to be another half-hour left to the Oscar nominated anime.  I think there is a problem when the young heroine, Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer), is turned into an older version (voiced by Jean Simmons), for most of the film's duration.  When we think of the young and engaging heroines of Miyazaki's earlier films, such as Kiki from ""Majo no takkybin"" and Chihiro in the Oscar winning ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,"" putting up with Old Sophie is quite an imposition.  Consequently, I found this to be the least captivating of Miyazaki's films that I have seen to date.But none of that really matters, because there is still so much to enjoy, and perhaps we can blame author Diana Wynne Jones for the incompatibility of her novel with our expectations for a Miyazaki movie.  When we meet Sophie she is a hat maker working in a shop, and while out for a walk she is bothered by some obnoxious soldiers only to be rescued by Howl (Christian Bale), a wizard who has pursuers of his own.  There is some sort of war going on, and the wizards are needed, but being saved by Howl brings Sophie to the attention of the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall).  As much out of jealousy as anything else, the Witch turns young Sophie into old Sophie.Looking for someone to reverse the spell, old Sophie leaves the town and on the road meets a scarecrow she names Turniphead, who bounces around on his wooden pole and takes her to the titular structure.  This is a marvelous place of shifting rooms and doors that become portals to other places.  Howl is a shape-shifter whose chief form is a giant bird, and his assistants are Calcifer (Billy Crystal), who is basically a talking flame who supplies the castle with its source of energy (and some interesting curses) and Markl (Josh Hutcherson), a young wizard in training.  Old Sophie makes herself the housekeeper for the castle and starts cleaning up the place.  Meanwhile, Howl is supposed to be helping both sides in the war, but would rather ensure there is peace.  The other key figure is Madame Suliman (Blythe Danner), a sorceress, who further compliments matters to the point that we would be worried that Sophie will never be young again, except for one magical moment when it becomes clear that she is closer to her dream than she thinks.Clearly you can be engaged without being captivated, and even if this is not a Miyazaki film that you want to watch again and again, there is no doubt it is worth watching once.  Besides, once you have been completely captivated by one of his anime you have to check out each one that is revoiced for American audiences in the hope that lightning will strike several more times.  Calcifer steals plenty of scenes, as much through Miyazaki's animation as Crystal's dialogue, and it is nice to have a supporting character who can be cute without becoming annoying, and hearing Simmons and Bacall again are both treats as well.  You never doubt that Miyazaki creates complete worlds and with his attention to detail there are always nice little moments of animation (the water coming to the shore caught my eye).

Christian Bale's Howl seemed to move the story along.  What I think I enjoyed most was the magic of the story, how his ragtag castle was able to have different portal doors that would open out on a different environment.  I think that'd be so cool to have a house that you can set to be in France or out in the mountains or in a beautiful countryside.  Of course, then we'd probably start hearing about house crashes as moving houses start colliding.  I enjoyed the European aristocracy with the quaint castles and kings.

Very similar to Spirited Away, adults as well as kids will eat this up.  It is probably a PG instead of G for the brief shots of the handsome Howl's bare butt.While Spirited Away is heavily Japanese in setting, characters, and culture, Howl's is set in a European-style kingdom.  The setting really screams ""Western instead of Eastern.""  The visuals are bright and cheerful, and of course the film includes a flying sequence that the viewer can go on and feel as though he is in the air.The story is about Sophie, a shy girl who works in her family's hattery.  On a walk, Sophie is rescued from some unwelcome advances by a handsome young stranger.  She falls in love with him instantly.  In doing so, she angers the Witch of the Waste, a bloated, jealous woman who turns Sophie into an elderly woman.  Unable to turn to her family, Sophie embarks to the Waste to look for a witch or wizard to break the spell.  She encounters the vast, walking junkpile called a 'castle' and inhabited by male slobs.

Finally, before Spring 2006 arrived, I could watch it in the comfort of my living room, and my anxiety was put to rest.""Howl's Moving Castle"" offers many of the elements that have become classic in Miyazaki movies so far:-The stylized characters and art direction is there, coupled with some breathtaking animated landscapes that are bound to make you go back in the movie several times to rejoice yourself in the beauty of his vision made reality.-The music, once more written by Joe Hisaishi, helps frame the story perfectly and continues to be a fun and solid score that can stand by itself outside the context of the movie.-The animation, with particular emphasis on the castle, is unbelievably detailed and fascinating. The character design is equally exciting as in his past projects.In terms of the storyline, the movie falls short at times:-Some things remain unclear once the movie is over. Some transitions are a bit odd at times, making you wonder whether the editing hand was a bit to tough on this one.-There are recurring themes on the movie which have previously been touched by Miyazaki: the lead character being a young female, the topic of war and elements of magic are again core to the screenplay. It's not that it's bad: it's just a bit too familiar.In the end, this is really a very good movie, though simply not his best. It just falls short when compared against his arsenal of great works that I've had the chance of seeing: ""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"".

Not using as strong a Shinto theme as in ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Spirited Away"", the story of ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is about a young woman named Sofie who works in a hat shop and is placed under a spell that makes her an old woman from the spiteful ""Witch of the Waste"".  With war looming between Sofie's kingdom and a neighboring kingdom, Sofie leaves the city and wanders into the neighboring hills, which isn't easy for an old woman; but she meets a scarecrow who helps her find shelter.  The shelter turns out to be a moving castle (a hovel) that is owned by the young wizard named Howl, whom Sofie had previously met.  Walking into the castle, Sofie settles down in front of the fireplace and the fire, named Calcipher, begins to speak with her; but the exhausted Sofie falls asleep.  The caslte's other resident, a boy named Markl, pretends to be an old man when around other people.  Howl's castle doesn't just move on its own on a set of long legs, it also has a magical door that is a portal to several different locations simultaneously depending upon the setting. Sofie settles into the castle as a cleaning lady.  Once war breaks out, the kingdom that Sofie & Howl live in attept to induct Howl into its army of other wizards to fight the neighboring kingdom in large, flying airships; but Howl wants no part of it and instead begins to fight the kingdom's forces to avoid being captured.  Sofie, in the meantime, is in love with Howl; but will the spell that the Witch of the Waste put on her ever be broken?  Will Sofie discover the connection between Calcifer and Howl?  Will Howl be captured?  Who is the scarecrow?  You'll just have to watch this wonderful animated film to find out.With brilliant animation, engaging characters and an amazing story, I rate Hayao Miyazaki's animated film ""Howl's Moving Castle"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Though some amazing actors (such as Billy Crystal, Lauren Bacall and Christian Bale) provided their voices to the English version of the film, I prefer to watch the Japanese version with subtitles.

I thought the title was ridiculous and what was a `moving castle'?  While channel surfing, I was immediately stunned by the imagery of this conventionally-animated film and I've bought the DVD.Sophie leads a quiet life in her family's hat shop.  This imaginary world is like early twentieth century western Europe with significant differences.  Magic exists along with technology.  One day while going to see her sister, she is aided by a handsome stranger.  This stranger (later reveled to be the wizard Howl) has problems of his own and they are chased by mysterious black rubbery creatures. These creatures are henchmen of the Witch of the Wastes.  Seemingly cornered, Howl literally sweeps Sophie off her feet to safety.When he sets her down again, we know she will love him forever.Later while alone in the shop, she is cursed by the Witch of the Wastes who believes Sophie is her romantic rival for Howl.  Instantly Sophie is aged from 19 to 90.  She leaves town and ventures out into the countryside.  In her journey, she is befriended by an enchanted scarecrow.  She helps him and he helps her.  She ultimately finds refuge in the moving castle of Howl.  She is allowed entry by the fire demon, Calcifer who powers the castle.  She later meets Markl, Howl's young apprentice.  Then the Wizard Howl returns home.  Sophie recognizes the man who rescued her.  What she does not realize, is Howl recognizes her despite the curse.In time, she becomes a member of the family.  Howl is also cursed along with other problems.  Events in the outside world intrude in their personal lives when their nation goes to war.  If you want to know what else, watch the movie...... :-)This film is nothing short of a masterpiece.  I never would have thought of Christian Bale as having a romantic voice.  His voice is the perfect compliment to the beautifully animated Howl.  The characters are vivid.  Howl can be dashing and the man certainly knows how to make an exit.  Sophie is insecure as a young woman but oddly comfortable as a old woman.  As her confidence and love for Howl comes through, her appearance returns to normal.  It as though the curse is a physical manifestation of her insecurities.  Young Markl is initially annoyed by this old lady but she soon fills a void in his life.The DVD extras were interesting.  Remember this is a foreign film.  Even though it is a cartoon, it is dubbed.  The animated characters lips were originally synced to a Japanese language script.  When American voices were used, the translated script had to take into account the lip movements of the animated characters.The movement is based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones.  Having read the novel, I think the movie is an improvement.  It seems Pixar Director Pete Doctor has not.  While pointing out the interesting plot elements made by Miyazaki, he names things created by Ms. Jones.  While this is a wonderful film, it is based on Ms. Jones work.  It would've been nice if she'd been given proper credit.Even though this is a cartoon, it isn't necessarily a children's film.  Adults will love this also.",5,A Joy to Behold,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,3215,"['Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'directed', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'first', 'came', 'attention', 'when', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'thought', 'title', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'was', 'moving', 'castle', 'channel', 'surfing', 'was', 'immediately', 'stunned', 'imagery', 'conventionally-animated', 'film', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'DVD.Sophie', 'quiet', 'life', 'family', 'hat', 'shop', 'imaginary', 'world', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'western', 'Europe', 'significant', 'differences', 'Magic', 'technology', 'One', 'day', 'going', 'see', 'sister', 'aided', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'later', 'reveled', 'be', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'problems', 'own', 'are', 'chased', 'mysterious', 'black', 'rubbery', 'creatures', 'creatures', 'are', 'henchmen', 'Witch', 'Wastes', 'Seemingly', 'cornered', 'Howl', 'literally', 'Sophie', 'feet', 'safety.When', 'down', 'again', 'know', 'will', 'love', 'forever.Later', 'alone', 'shop', 'cursed', 'Witch', 'Wastes', 'who', 'Sophie', 'romantic', 'rival', 'Howl', 'Instantly', 'Sophie', 'aged', '19', '90', 'town', 'ventures', 'out', 'countryside', 'journey', 'befriended', 'enchanted', 'scarecrow', 'ultimately', 'refuge', 'moving', 'castle', 'Howl', 'allowed', 'entry', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer', 'who', 'castle', 'later', 'Markl', 'Howl', 'young', 'apprentice', 'Then', 'Wizard', 'Howl', 'home', 'Sophie', 'man', 'who', 'rescued', 'What', 'not', 'realize', 'Howl', 'curse.In', 'time', 'member', 'family', 'Howl', 'also', 'cursed', 'other', 'problems', 'Events', 'outside', 'world', 'intrude', 'personal', 'lives', 'when', 'nation', 'war', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'watch', 'movie', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'having', 'romantic', 'voice', 'voice', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'Howl', 'characters', 'are', 'vivid', 'Howl', 'can', 'be', 'dashing', 'man', 'certainly', 'how', 'make', 'exit', 'Sophie', 'insecure', 'young', 'woman', 'oddly', 'comfortable', 'old', 'woman', 'confidence', 'love', 'Howl', 'appearance', 'returns', 'normal', 'curse', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'insecurities', 'Young', 'Markl', 'initially', 'annoyed', 'old', 'lady', 'soon', 'void', 'life.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'were', 'interesting', 'Remember', 'foreign', 'film', 'Even', 'cartoon', 'dubbed', 'animated', 'characters', 'lips', 'were', 'originally', 'synced', 'Japanese', 'language', 'script', 'When', 'American', 'voices', 'were', 'used', 'translated', 'script', 'had', 'take', 'account', 'lip', 'movements', 'animated', 'characters.The', 'movement', 'based', 'novel', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'Having', 'read', 'novel', 'think', 'movie', 'improvement', 'Pixar', 'Director', 'Pete', 'Doctor', 'not', 'pointing', 'out', 'interesting', 'plot', 'elements', 'made', 'Miyazaki', 'things', 'created', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'wonderful', 'film', 'based', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'work', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', ""'d"", 'been', 'given', 'proper', 'credit.Even', 'cartoon', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'children', 'film', 'Adults', 'will', 'love', 'also']",N/A

I've sat through so much crappy anime, that anything that smacks of ""Japanese"" and is ""animated"" makes me run out of the room.But, I got so many recommendations to see HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, that I caved. The film is based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones (familiar to fans of fantasy, most likely.)Glad I broke my ""no anime"" rule, too. Absolutely delightful film that I heartily recommend.In brief: Set in some Europeanish land that feels like the 19th century, where contraptions of odd sorts and magic coexist happily,  this is the story of Sophie, a plain young woman who works making hats, and who, after a brief rescue from sludgy thugs by a very attractive blond fella (the wizard Howl), finds herself cursed by the Witch of the Waste (who still resents not being able to capture Howl's heart). The curse turns her into a very old woman. So, off Sophie goes to the wizard in hope of breaking the curse. In typical fairy tale fashion, she has spunk and is quite industrious and noble of heart--helping a scarecrow stuck in a thicket (who then follows her slavishly, bounce-bounce-bouncing along), entering Howl's castle and bargaining with the fire demon, beginning to tidy up, taking charge of the place. Sophie and Howl and Markl (the boy who assists Howl) and Calcifer (the fire demon who is dependent on Howl, and Howl on he, in some symbiotic curse) end up getting along and working to end a war incited by the disappearance of a prince. (It won't take much guessing to figure out who's the prince). In the end, solutons are found and a new ""family"" is created from the cursed and lonely folks of the castle.A truly happy and romantic, even, ending.The castle itself if hilarious and whimsical and a joy to behold in action. The sort of thing I'd have given a few toes and fingers to ride in as a kid. The story has a generous and good heart, if you pardon the pun. (You'll get the pun if you see the film.) One young woman's selflessness and courage makes life better for a whole lot of people, breaking curses left and right. People don't always get what they deserve, interestingly. They do get compassion and grace and mercy. The idea of the longing for family is at play as well, and family may not be flesh-folk, but folk who band together and live together and make a life where they help and get help from one another, and where they put up with each other's moods, flaws, and eccentricities.Good theme, that.And if you like to laugh, Billy Crystal will make you...er...HOWL as Calcifer, the fire demon. I laughed my wee head askew.Christian Bale adds something extra to the character of Howl, the tormented wizard. A weariness, a masculinity, a strength, a bit of humor. I really like Bale (he was the best Batman on film!), and while I didn't recognize the voice during the flim and had to check the credits, I kept thinking, "" I know that voice. I know that voice!"" He was perfect for the part.For those who love a Beauty and the Beast type tale, this has that, too.And I recognized at once the voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer, but it took me a while to place Lauren Bacall, who does the Witch of the Waste perfectly, even after the character undergoes a rather startling transformation. (Oh, you're gonna love it.)From what I've read about Academy Award winning animator, Hiyao Mayazaki, he's a gifted man with the knack of adding a special magic to his creations. His work has brought him great honor and success in his homeland (and globally) for films such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, NAUSICAA: The Valley of the Wind, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY and others.Howl's Moving Castle is sprinkled with some of that magic.",5,A Magical Tale Of Curses and War and Courage and Love!,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3706,"['Yeah', 'yeah', ""'m"", 'late', 'party', 'not', 'fault', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'so', 'much', 'crappy', 'anime', 'anything', 'smacks', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'run', 'room.But', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'recommendations', 'see', 'HOWL', 'MOVING', 'CASTLE', 'caved', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'familiar', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'most', 'likely', 'Glad', 'broke', 'anime', 'rule', 'too', 'Absolutely', 'delightful', 'film', 'heartily', 'recommend.In', 'brief', 'Set', 'Europeanish', 'land', '19th', 'century', 'where', 'contraptions', 'odd', 'sorts', 'magic', 'coexist', 'happily', 'story', 'Sophie', 'plain', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'making', 'hats', 'who', 'brief', 'rescue', 'sludgy', 'thugs', 'very', 'attractive', 'blond', 'fella', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'cursed', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'who', 'still', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'capture', 'Howl', 'heart', 'curse', 'very', 'old', 'woman', 'So', 'off', 'Sophie', 'wizard', 'hope', 'breaking', 'curse', 'typical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fashion', 'spunk', 'quite', 'industrious', 'noble', 'heart', 'helping', 'scarecrow', 'stuck', 'thicket', 'who', 'then', 'slavishly', 'bounce-bounce-bouncing', 'entering', 'Howl', 'castle', 'bargaining', 'fire', 'demon', 'beginning', 'tidy', 'up', 'taking', 'charge', 'place', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'Markl', 'boy', 'who', 'Howl', 'Calcifer', 'fire', 'demon', 'who', 'dependent', 'Howl', 'Howl', 'symbiotic', 'curse', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'along', 'working', 'end', 'war', 'incited', 'disappearance', 'prince', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'guessing', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'prince', 'end', 'solutons', 'are', 'found', 'new', 'family', 'created', 'cursed', 'lonely', 'folks', 'castle.A', 'truly', 'happy', 'romantic', 'even', 'ending.The', 'castle', 'hilarious', 'whimsical', 'joy', 'behold', 'action', 'sort', 'thing', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'few', 'toes', 'fingers', 'ride', 'kid', 'story', 'generous', 'good', 'heart', 'pardon', 'pun', ""'ll"", 'get', 'pun', 'see', 'film', 'One', 'young', 'woman', 'selflessness', 'courage', 'life', 'better', 'whole', 'lot', 'people', 'breaking', 'curses', 'left', 'right', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'interestingly', 'do', 'get', 'compassion', 'grace', 'mercy', 'idea', 'longing', 'family', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'flesh-folk', 'folk', 'who', 'band', 'together', 'live', 'together', 'make', 'life', 'where', 'help', 'get', 'help', 'one', 'where', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'moods', 'flaws', 'eccentricities.Good', 'theme', 'that.And', 'like', 'laugh', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'will', 'make', 'er', 'HOWL', 'Calcifer', 'fire', 'demon', 'laughed', 'wee', 'head', 'askew.Christian', 'Bale', 'something', 'extra', 'character', 'Howl', 'tormented', 'wizard', 'weariness', 'masculinity', 'strength', 'bit', 'humor', 'really', 'Bale', 'was', 'best', 'Batman', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'voice', 'flim', 'had', 'check', 'credits', 'kept', 'thinking', 'know', 'voice', 'know', 'voice', 'was', 'perfect', 'part.For', 'who', 'love', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'type', 'tale', 'recognized', 'once', 'voices', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'took', 'while', 'place', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'who', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'perfectly', 'even', 'character', 'rather', 'startling', 'transformation', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'animator', 'Hiyao', 'Mayazaki', 'gifted', 'man', 'knack', 'adding', 'special', 'magic', 'creations', 'work', 'brought', 'great', 'honor', 'success', 'homeland', 'globally', 'films', 'such', 'MY', 'NEIGHBOR', 'TOTORO', 'NAUSICAA', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'PRINCESS', 'MONONOKE', 'SPIRITED', 'AWAY', 'others.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'sprinkled', 'magic']",N/A

It has all the Miyazaki brilliance and charm, it has amazing characters trapped in circumstances beyond one's imagination, it has breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and open spaces, it has its hearfelt uplifting moments, it has Joe hisaishi's heavenly score, capable enough of transporting the viewer into a magical, mystical world on its own, it has everything else one ever expects from a Miyazaki or a Studio Ghibli film....and above all it has a message! Howl's moving castle is Studio Ghibli's strongest anti-war statement after ""Grave of the fireflies"".The story of Howl's moving castle revolves around a young girl sophie who works in a hat shop. After she is saved by a wizard, Howl, from the dark forces, Sophie is turned into a 90 year old wrinkled old woman by the witch of the waste, out of jealousy. In the wilderness, Sophie comes across this strange moving castle wherein she takes refuge. Howl happens to be the master of the castle. While howl fights demons and dark forces in the war torn land, Sophie is left alone alongwith a fire demon Calcifer to take care of the magical moving castle which seems to posses supernatural powers in itself. Even its doors lead to different worlds! The plot gets deeper and complex as Sophie and Howl, alongwith few other amazing characters such as a scarecrow and a very strange dog, try finding resolutions to all the problems surrounding them. Due to its interwoven sub-plots and complexities, Howl's moving castle easily calls for multiple viewings.Only Miyazaki could have told a story as complex as this one with such a grace and charm! Even the most unbelievable and wierdest characters come alive amidst gorgeous settings in a Miyazaki film!! Howl is an unforgettable experience which certainly leaves the viewer spellbound, craving for more. Miyazaki's attention to details in the film is, as usual, stunning. Character animation looks absolutely flawless and is certainly more complex and richer than in any other ghibli film. Animation on the castle alone is jawdropping. Each and every frame of the film is lush, detailed, a true piece of art, putting to shame anyone who thinks traditional animation is a thing of the past. The hand drawn beauty and feel of the film Howl's moving castle easily surpasses any of the recent digitally animated films by leaps and bounds.With Howl's moving castle, Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have once again successfully proved that they work only for the projects they believe in. Without succumbing to the market needs or giving a damn to the ongoing trend or formulas in the industry, they rather follow their own hearts and minds, exploring new horizons in art and cinema with their unusual storylines and experimental subjects.Howl's moving castle is a grand film with a soul, a meaning and a purpose.",5,ANOTHER DAZZLING ACCOMPLISHMENT BY THE WORLD'S GREATEST STORYTELLER!!!,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2978,"['Based', 'loosely', 'book', 'british', 'author', 'diana', 'wynne', 'jones', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'dazzling', 'spectacular', 'make-believe', 'fantasy', 'directed', 'legend', 'Hayao', 'miyazaki', 'Miyazaki', 'brilliance', 'charm', 'amazing', 'characters', 'trapped', 'circumstances', 'one', 'imagination', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'open', 'spaces', 'hearfelt', 'uplifting', 'moments', 'Joe', 'hisaishi', 'heavenly', 'score', 'capable', 'enough', 'transporting', 'viewer', 'magical', 'mystical', 'world', 'own', 'everything', 'else', 'one', 'ever', 'Miyazaki', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', '.and', 'message', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'strongest', 'anti-war', 'statement', 'Grave', 'fireflies', '.The', 'story', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'revolves', 'young', 'girl', 'sophie', 'who', 'hat', 'shop', 'saved', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'dark', 'forces', 'Sophie', 'turned', '90', 'year', 'old', 'wrinkled', 'old', 'woman', 'witch', 'waste', 'jealousy', 'wilderness', 'Sophie', 'strange', 'moving', 'castle', 'wherein', 'refuge', 'Howl', 'be', 'master', 'castle', 'howl', 'fights', 'demons', 'dark', 'forces', 'war', 'torn', 'land', 'Sophie', 'left', 'alone', 'alongwith', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer', 'take', 'care', 'magical', 'moving', 'castle', 'posses', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'Even', 'doors', 'lead', 'different', 'worlds', 'plot', 'deeper', 'complex', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'alongwith', 'few', 'other', 'amazing', 'characters', 'such', 'scarecrow', 'very', 'strange', 'dog', 'try', 'finding', 'resolutions', 'problems', 'surrounding', 'Due', 'interwoven', 'sub-plots', 'complexities', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'easily', 'multiple', 'viewings.Only', 'Miyazaki', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'story', 'as', 'complex', 'one', 'grace', 'charm', 'Even', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'wierdest', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'amidst', 'gorgeous', 'settings', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'Howl', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'certainly', 'viewer', 'spellbound', 'craving', 'more', 'Miyazaki', 'attention', 'details', 'film', 'usual', 'stunning', 'Character', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'certainly', 'more', 'complex', 'richer', 'other', 'ghibli', 'film', 'Animation', 'castle', 'alone', 'jawdropping', 'frame', 'film', 'lush', 'detailed', 'true', 'piece', 'art', 'putting', 'shame', 'anyone', 'who', 'traditional', 'animation', 'thing', 'past', 'hand', 'drawn', 'beauty', 'feel', 'film', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'easily', 'recent', 'digitally', 'animated', 'films', 'leaps', 'bounds.With', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'Miyazaki', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'successfully', 'proved', 'work', 'only', 'projects', 'believe', 'succumbing', 'market', 'giving', 'damn', 'ongoing', 'trend', 'formulas', 'industry', 'rather', 'follow', 'own', 'hearts', 'minds', 'exploring', 'new', 'horizons', 'art', 'cinema', 'unusual', 'storylines', 'experimental', 'subjects.Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'grand', 'film', 'soul', 'meaning', 'purpose']",N/A

The movie is only loosely based on the book, and I didn't care much for it either.This movie is good, but it just kind of lost me somewhere along the way.  There's nothing terribly wrong with it, and I wouldn't call it bad.  There were many moments I found enjoyable.  But as it went along, it just seemed to drift.  I found myself not very interested.

There are few words to describe the epic frontiers envisioned, and somehow it still retains the intimacy of storytelling. The dynamics of characters still engaging. Anyone who is still suspicious of animation cinema should enter the world of Miyazaki.Having said that, my thoughts must stay specific to this animation alone. I have been blown away by Miyazaki's previous work, 'Spirited Away', 'Castle in the Sky', 'Nausica' and though ""Moving Castle"" is another great addition, it is becoming apparent a curse has been cast on our beloved man. It seems that the stories are fixed in one place, limited by Miyazaki's obsession to contrive a story based on the same world. The steam engines, the flying castles, the 19th century feel, the backdrop of war, a future stuck in the industrial age. The setting is very similar. And even the stories retain a similar progression in character transition. The journeys are very alike.Ultimately, I felt a little empty towards the end of 'Moving Castle'. The slow sequences began to disrupt my attention and it was quite clear where the story was going. The happy ending was overwhelmingly naive. Everything fell into place all of a sudden, the war ended and everyone lived happily ever after.I just wonder, what is next for Miyazaki. Is Miyazaki's imagination bound by this one world.

I'd heard rave reviews, which I still feel compelled to agree with, but it didn't quite reach the heights that ""Spirited Away"" did, I felt.Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful film; it's a unique story with likeable characters whose weaknesses are exposed intimately with the audience.My main gripe with this film was that so much was set up that it become obvious this film was either going nowhere or going to close up too fast; and it ended up doing both.Some characters, whose appearance could've added an interesting layering to the story, such as the lead character's mother, were used briefly and in a 1-dimensional way to set up Sofi's situation as a dowdy girl who has had to grow up too fast.These little nibbles at the edges of Sofi's life seemed to broaden our understanding of Sofi's character but only on a superficial level because by the end none of it really mattered.And this is really what ruined it for me; the end. I'd been enjoying it for almost the entire length of the film but I kept questioning how things were going to end and whether or not it could end with closure but with some sort of unique angle. We get closure; problem is it's too much and it's too obvious. Everything comes to an abrupt end and Sofi's journey to recover her youth is hampered by the typical ""love conqueres all"" scenario.Perhaps if this was the first Miyazaki film I'd seen I would've enjoyed it more but after the beautiful way in which ""Spirited Away"" was constructed I expected a little more.I give it 3 stars because it's a film I enjoyed, but it loses 2 stars because it drags the story into cliche by the end.",3,Storyline set up well but delivery a little shaky.,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1662,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', ""'d"", 'heard', 'rave', 'reviews', 'still', 'feel', 'compelled', 'agree', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'did', 'felt.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'beautiful', 'film', 'unique', 'story', 'likeable', 'characters', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'exposed', 'intimately', 'audience.My', 'main', 'gripe', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'become', 'obvious', 'film', 'was', 'either', 'going', 'nowhere', 'going', 'close', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'both.Some', 'characters', 'appearance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'added', 'interesting', 'layering', 'story', 'such', 'lead', 'character', 'mother', 'were', 'used', 'briefly', '1-dimensional', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'Sofi', 'situation', 'dowdy', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'fast.These', 'little', 'nibbles', 'edges', 'Sofi', 'life', 'seemed', 'broaden', 'understanding', 'Sofi', 'character', 'only', 'superficial', 'level', 'end', 'none', 'really', 'mattered.And', 'really', 'what', 'ruined', 'end', ""'d"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'almost', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'kept', 'questioning', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'end', 'not', 'could', 'end', 'closure', 'sort', 'unique', 'angle', 'get', 'closure', 'problem', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'obvious', 'Everything', 'abrupt', 'end', 'Sofi', 'journey', 'recover', 'youth', 'hampered', 'typical', 'love', 'conqueres', 'scenario.Perhaps', 'was', 'first', 'Miyazaki', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'more', 'beautiful', 'way', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'was', 'constructed', 'expected', 'little', 'more.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'enjoyed', '2', 'stars', 'story', 'cliche', 'end']",N/A

He has some qualities that Haku had (since Miyazaki always incorporates favorite characters of his and fun ideas that he has into all of his movies) there was just something about Howl that made him more likable.  Anyway, the movie left a lot of things unanswered and I was still a bit confused about some things at the end, but it was still really good.

Boys probably wouldn't care for it much because of the romance part, but I think most girls will like it.  For the most part it was also a clean movie; no swearing or profanity.

957146,A35SK8CQEKTT84,B000CDGVOE,"Ray Kay ""The Denominator""","[3, 8]","I have been a fan of Miyazaki's work since I was six years old, the first movie I saw happened to be My Neighbour Totoro, which still to this day, blows me away. Miyazaki followed suit for many years by astounding me with thought-provoking, epic, and masterfully beautiful movies. So I expected his latest work to leave me stunned and speechless for many days. However, Howl's Moving Castle strongly disappointed me. First off, this is unlike Miyazaki, who creates movies that delivers strong protagnists. The main character is a young woman named Sophie, who is insecure with her entirety and a young wizard named Howl. Usually, there is some sort of hurdle Miyazaki's characters leap, with them growing in the end or learning from the experience. Not here. I felt that the characters only learnt how to be less self-indulgent. Also, I did not get that high sensation I normally get in terms of the magic. That is, I do not find the magic to be very magical. It was not whimsical. Call me corny, but I like feeling whimsy when I watch movies like these. Spirited Away had me on edge for a very long time. So I thought: maybe I don't like this movie because it's not about youthful adventure, and Miyazaki is not used to tackling adult characters. Princess Mononoke was FANTASTIC, and there were no children in it. The plot of Howl's was weak, and the main characters were one-dimensional. Even Kiki's Delivery Service was more entertaining than this movie, and Kiki was not about anything, really. I think I am vexed because I felt that the movie was trying too hard to be epic. The romance was below sub par. I did not get the feeling that they truly loved each other at all, unlike in Princess Mononoke. The one thing that salvaged this film were the background characters. Calcifer, Turnip-head, Markl and the Witch of The Waste were all wonderful, and I don't now why the entire movie wasn't revolving around them. I think I am being too harsh in judging this movie because it is Miyazaki's absolute worst. I am very sad that he made this movie. But, in the movie's defense, though being the worst Miyazaki film, it is still better than half the anime flowing out of Japan these days. Plus, the book on which the anime was based was awful as well. The plot was almost completely different to the movie's. Do not rush to buy this movie, unless you've already seen it and liked it.

J MOSS,"[12, 12]","Should Miyazaki be pleased or despairing that his handcrafted animations have reached their zenith just as their computer generated cousins threaten them with redundance? At age 64, he's probably beyond worrying. This is a celebration of the human touch, in a similar vein to Nic Park's whacky, Grommit. The care lavished on the subtle tonalities of colour and texture is one of their shared domains. Another, at least with,'Howl' is a predelection for an earlier, and now only a dimly familiar, period of the early C20th, where freeways were lanes, and cobblestones and woodgrain were yet to be superceeded by synthetics. And, inventor's magic reigns supreme. The parable in 'Howl' is about the transforming power of love, a power of the most potent magic. Witches cast spells and wizards are sought for counsel by kings. Wars churn along with machine-like inevitability, the consequential milieu of a bewildered populace. The animated heart, aflutter with infatuation, burdened by outward appearance, stretched by loyalty to compassion, promotes the narrative. Howl's Castle, an unlikely chunk of Boschlike junk on four legs(flashes of Frank Zappa's, 'Billy The Mountain', for me) is the resevoir of recouperation and regeneration for the wounded hearts, kept alive by a spirited flame. The narrative asserts that appearances deceive and that youthful ones in particular, can be an encumbrance. There are no such encumbrances with the appearance of Miyazaki's films, which are a liberating, elevating joy. His reach is considerable: from the aforementioned details out to superb panoramas, be they the incendiary glimmer of a distant city under nocturnal aerial seige, or a pellucid valley lake enthroned by ice-capped peaks. For me, the animator's artistry with halated colour and whimsical line is the fiat to the elusive powers of his characters. What facility!

957149,AW3YNUYWVDBTD,B000CDGVOE,"R.J. Watts ""Canvas Spots""","[5, 15]","I am in doubt a fan of miyazaki's films and this one was definately my favorite! From start to finish I was hooked and at the edge of my seat as one thing happened after another that was just amazing. What made this movie the best was the ending, when everything you learn from beginning to end comes together in unimaginable ways. BTW, all the people who gave this movie less than 4 stars are just whining because they tried to follow the whole plot the entire way through. So my suggestion for this movie is to watch it through once trying to follow the sofia plot, then watch the movie again and learn the other plots, which should overall make the experience better than any of them will ever have because they didn't want to spend a bit more to see this FANTASTIC movie again! WATCH THIS FILM!Second, I would just like to say that everyone who has read the book and calls this movie a butcher to the plot is completely worthless. When Miyazaki made this movie, he used the book as a frame to extend the imaginative world Diana Wynne Jones created. In no way, shape, or form did he tear out large parts of the book. Instead, they call it butchering because he made the story more complexe so that the average adult (not the ones that let their brains boil away watching television, a sad irony) could be more interested. Down below, I explain everything and anything for those who need to know what was changed and what others found confusing and how is all makes sense.WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS:The war in the back story of the movie they will say is completely random and pointless. However, if they truely watched the movie, they would have picked up that the war was created by the mysterious disappearance of the prince. One kingdom thought the other had the prince and when no prince was handed over, the war started up. The war is fought between the kingdom sofia lives in and the kingdom the prince lives in, there is no need to go deeper than that. Sofia's appernace is a simple question. Her apperance changes back to the young version when she acts young and old when she acts old. So, when howl compliments her on how beautiful she is, she looks young, but then she comments that she could never look beautiful while she was old, and so she turns old. SIMPLE! She was cursed because the witch of the waste thought that Howl was falling in love with her and had hoped that by cursing her Howl would not adventure any close to her. (AGAIN, would have gotten this if you understood that the Witch of the Waste was in love with Howl and then re-saw the beginning). To answer him copying stuff from his own movies, he is one man who is already one of the greatest imaginers ever, but when does creativity run out? I'd like to see everyone who complains about that even think of some of the crap this guy can, most, if not all, of them can't. Next, all plots go to hell (a mess) and then regather, so don't put anything down on that. For instance, LotR went all to a mess and then regathered, and yet it's concidered one of the greatest stories/movies of all time. Another point to defende this movie is that when someone put down that who would want to see a hat shop girl turned into an old woman, well, who really wants to see a guy run around a building firing bullets or learning that he's in a fake world, who wants to see a movie about torture, who wants to see a movie about toys. ALL MOVIES CAN BE SAID LIKE THAT, making that arguement to be just an opinion lamely stated and that this person should have know from what they like and disliked that this was not the movie for them. On the arguement that the movie makes you use your imagination to fill in the gaps (gasp, you have to think!), don't you have to use your imagination in the book to imagine everything. And maybe you read something wrong so your imagination isn't just perfect with the movie. Jeez, this is one person's interpretation, not yours!If you see me ranting about your review in here, and completely disagree, I'd be happy to argue it with you. Just drop me an e-mail at nobod3@hotmail.com . Trust me, I can use more than one way to prove that your arguement is about as dumb as ever.

Sometimes it seems like everyone in the country has seen at least one Miyazaki film, even those whose entire animated movie experience has come courtesy Walt Disney, and most have seen enough to argue endlessly over whether Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away is the better film. (Me, I was always fonder of Kiki's Delivery Service.) Well, now there's a new entry in the canon for the fans to argue over-- Howl's Moving Castle.Howl's Moving Castle is based on the much-beloved Diana Wynne-Jones novel, and if the movie has a downfall, that's it. It often seems as if just as many people have read Diana Wynne-Jones books as have seen Miyazaki movies, even those who haven't read a young adult novel since, well, they were young adults. So unlike most movie adaptations, any attempt to bring Howl's Moving Castle to the screen was bound to have at least as many obsessive geeks picking over each piece of the novel that got slighted in the adaptation. I will endeavor not to be one of them in this review (though I must admit I was while watching the movie).For the two of you out there who've neither read the book nor seen the movie, the plot: Sophie, a young girl (Emily Mortimer, voiced as an old woman by Jean Simmons) who works in her mother's milliner's shop, is cursed during a brief encounter with the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) and turned into an old woman herself. Unable to face her own family in her new condition, she flees, finding her way into the titular edifice, presided over by the wizard Howl (Christian Bale) and his pet fire demon Calcifer (Billy Crystal). While plotting with Calcifer, who's guessed that she's under a curse, Sophie also makes a deal with him to release the bond that exists between he and Howl.Now, realistically, it's not possible to faithfully adapt a five-hundred-page novel into a film unless you make a film longer than The Longest Day. Something's gotta go if you're going to make a movie under two hours-- probably a lot of somethings. And yes, a lot of somethings do go. Part of critiquing an adaptation is how seamless what's left is-- how artfully the person writing the adaptation managed to put together half a novel, or less, and still make it a complete story. And Miyazaki, who also wrote the adaptation, does a more than competent job, though the fist fifteen minutes or so will probably be confusing if you haven't read the book and aren't paying almost superhuman amounts of attention. Once you get past that, however, the movie takes off, and you can sit back and enjoy the ride. It's not as good as Spirited Away, but then, few things are. *** ",4,"Not Miyazaki's strongest work, but good anyway.",1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2786,"['Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', '2005', 'are', 'few', 'names', 'world', 'anime', 'least', ""'re"", 'American', 'evoke', 'same', 'response', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'everyone', 'country', 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'even', 'entire', 'animated', 'movie', 'experience', 'come', 'courtesy', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'most', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'argue', 'endlessly', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'better', 'film', 'Me', 'was', 'always', 'fonder', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Well', 'now', 'new', 'entry', 'canon', 'fans', 'argue', 'over', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'based', 'much-beloved', 'Diana', 'Wynne-Jones', 'novel', 'movie', 'downfall', 'often', 'just', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'read', 'Diana', 'Wynne-Jones', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'Miyazaki', 'movies', 'even', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'well', 'were', 'young', 'adults', 'So', 'most', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'screen', 'was', 'bound', 'have', 'least', 'many', 'obsessive', 'geeks', 'picking', 'piece', 'novel', 'got', 'slighted', 'adaptation', 'will', 'endeavor', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'review', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'two', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'movie', 'plot', 'Sophie', 'young', 'girl', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'voiced', 'old', 'woman', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'who', 'mother', 'milliner', 'shop', 'cursed', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'turned', 'old', 'woman', 'Unable', 'face', 'own', 'family', 'new', 'condition', 'finding', 'way', 'titular', 'edifice', 'presided', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'pet', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'plotting', 'Calcifer', 'who', 'guessed', 'curse', 'Sophie', 'also', 'deal', 'release', 'bond', 'Howl.Now', 'realistically', 'not', 'possible', 'faithfully', 'adapt', 'five-hundred-page', 'novel', 'film', 'make', 'film', 'longer', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Something', 'got', 'ta', 'go', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'probably', 'lot', 'somethings', 'yes', 'lot', 'somethings', 'do', 'go', 'Part', 'critiquing', 'adaptation', 'how', 'seamless', 'what', 'left', 'how', 'artfully', 'person', 'writing', 'adaptation', 'managed', 'put', 'together', 'novel', 'less', 'still', 'make', 'complete', 'story', 'Miyazaki', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'adaptation', 'more', 'competent', 'job', 'fist', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'confusing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'amounts', 'attention', 'Once', 'get', 'past', 'however', 'movie', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'then', 'few', 'things', 'are', '***']",N/A
957152,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000CDGVOE,Robert Moore,"[20, 21]","Well before HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki had established himself as the finest creator of feature length animated films in the history of cinema.  So pointing out that this marvelous film isn't quite as good as his very best work really isn't very illuminative.  He has done at least three or four films that are better, but that cannot be said of any other animator.  This film suffers only by comparison with his own work, not with that of anyone else.A number of Miyazaki's films have been set in non-Japanese settings, so this one's being imagined in a vaguely European locale really isn't terribly unique.  In every other way, this is an exceedingly typical Miyazaki creation.  There is, for instance, the preoccupation with flying, fields of non-identical flowers that wave in the breeze (each drawn separately by hand and not computer), richly detailed landscapes, and eccentrically designed rooms.  There is hardly a moment in this film that isn't a delight to gaze upon.In two ways this film stands comparison with anything that Miyazaki has done.  First, he has created a host of astonishingly vivid and convincing characters.  What is marvelous about them is that none of them are simple, but are wonderfully complex and often deeply flawed.  Howl of the title is a powerful sorcerer, horrified by the absurd war being waged in the land, but in danger himself of turning into a giant bird of prey.  He is struggling with sanity, infected by the insanity that he sees throughout the world.  The central character, Sofia, begins the movie a young, simple girl who embroiders hats in a hat shop, but who is turned into an extremely old woman by a witch's spell.  Through the rest of the film the spell waxes and wanes, sometimes maintaining completely the illusion of her being ancient, but sometimes in sleep restoring her completely to her youth.  At times she appears a blend of old crone and young girl.  There is also a extraordinarily well-conceived scarecrow that lays claim to be the finest such creation since THE WIZARD OF OZ.  There is even an animal, a dog that is the utter antithesis of all the too cute, too loud sidekicks that populate the Disney films.  Almost immobile, unexpressive, he can't even quite bark, but can only manage a bit of a wheeze.The second way the film stands out is visually.  With one exception, every aspect of this film is magical and unique.  For instance, the scarecrow is fascinating to watch at every moment, despite the fact that except for being able to hop about on its post as if it were mounted on a pogo stick, it is incapable of facial expressions or moving either arms or hands or legs.  As usual in Miyazaki, every aspect of nature is vibrant and alive, but even more than in previous films his interiors are stunning.  Each room is filled with bric-a-brac and personal items that make them feel actual and lived-in unprecedented in animation.So why does HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE fall short of Miyazaki's very best work, even while it surpasses the work of most others?  There are two reasons.  First, Calcifer the Fire Demon, at least in the English version (I have not seen the Japanese original), is both uninventively drawn and poorly voiced by Billy Crystal.  The drawing I dislike because in contrast with everything else in the movie, Calcifer is drawn as an orange blob with eyes and mouth, a hunk of poorly differentiated color in contrast with everything else onscreen, which is carefully nuanced and hued.  It is one of the least imaginatively executed characters in all of Miyazaki.  I love Billy Crystal, and have thoroughly enjoyed his work way back in the days of SOAP to the present, but he just wasn't appropriate for this film.  His loud, somewhat brash New York accent simply didn't mesh with all of the others.  The second major problem I had the film was the last quarter of the story.  At a certain point the story lost both its coherence and its pacing, and failed to maintain pace with the earlier parts of the movie.  The movie did not fall apart, but neither did it remain equally marvelous throughout.One other element in the film was both a delight and a mild disappointment:  the Castle itself.  Visually, this is one of the most amazing things one will see in an animated film, and the magical door that allows one to exit in any of four places suited it perfect.  The only problem is that we don't get to see much of the interior.  Virtually the entire action is kept inside one room in which all seem to eat and sleep.  I wanted Sophie to explore!These minor points aside, I enjoyed this film very nearly as much as I have any of Miyazaki's other films.

957155,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000CDGVOE,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Spirited Away"") with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones?  The answer is ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family`s hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman.  At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city.  Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious ""moving castle,"" owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time.  It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it.  Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work.  The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us.  This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us.  Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago.  The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second.  Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood.  But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" provides just the right vehicle to take you there.",4,glorious visuals,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2805,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'combine', 'master', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'British', 'sci-fi', 'novelist', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'answer', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'enchanting', 'not', 'altogether', 'understandable', 'animated', 'feature', 'filled', 'beauty', 'imagination', 'magic.Sophie', 'shy', 'young', 'girl', 'working', 'family', 's', 'hat', 'shop', 'who', 'spell', 'witch', 'who', 'decrepit', 'old', 'woman', 'loss', 'what', 'do', 'Sophie', 'leave', 'home', 'try', 'find', 'cure', 'condition', 'mysterious', 'land', 'wizards', 'witches', 'just', 'city', 'Not', 'long', 'mysterious', 'moving', 'castle', 'owned', 'enigmatic', 'wizard', 'known', 'Howl', 'not', 'only', 'freely', 'countryside', 'exist', 'number', 'different', 'dimensions', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'castle', 'door', 'discovers', 'what', 'inside', 'really', 'surreal', 'adventure', 'little', 'point', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'fine', 'details', 'story', 'often', 'being', 'made', 'up', 'not', 'always', 'way', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'desperately', 'understand', 'certain', 'fascination', 'way', 'film', 'defy', 'rules', 'time', 'space', 'real', 'compunction', 'explain', 'how', 'supposed', 'work', 'movie', 'merely', 'accept', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'face', 'value', 'go', 'along', 'wherever', 'take', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'primarily', 'film', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'seduces', 'accepting', 'slightly', 'weird', 'alternate', 'reality', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'animators', 'are', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'Occidental', 'film', 'be', 'set', 'sometime', 'late', 'Victorian', 'early', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'century', 'ago', 'visuals', 'are', 'so', 'exquisite', 'detail', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'turn', 'eyes', 'screen', 'even', 'split', 'second', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'world', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'same', 'time.In', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'English-language', 'version', 'impressive', 'cast', 'voices', 'including', 'veterans', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Christian', 'Bale.With', 'occasionally', 'incoherent', 'storyline', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'may', 'disappoint', 'frustrate', 'accustomed', 'more', 'simple', 'hectic', 'frenetic', 'animated', 'films', 'churned', 'out', 'regularly', 'Hollywood', ""'re"", 'mood', 'calmer', 'more', 'relaxing', 'trip', 'world', 'not', 'own', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'just', 'right', 'vehicle', 'take', 'there']",N/A

957157,A2AXNXBHIGHCDL,B000CDGVOE,"Rowena Wendy Lim ""anime reviewer""","[2, 2]","One thing I never expected Howl's Moving Castle to be was a love story, and yet that is exactly what it turned out to be. The first time I saw the promotional images, I mistook the old lady for Spirited Away's Yubaba. I thought Howls' Moving Castle was some sort of sequel to Spirited Away but the two are totally unrelated.Based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle is mainly about a girl named Sophie. She's the usual Miyazaki heroine -- an average-looking girl with boundless inner strength and goodness to whom everything out-of-the-ordinary happens. Sophie meets a dashing young man at the start of the film, not knowing that it is actually the legendary wizard Howl who is rumored to devour the hearts of beautiful young women. She is smitten, and that same night the Witch of the Waste pays her a visit. Sophie is incredibly unperturbed even as she is turned into a homely 90-year old woman by the witch. Instead of wallowing in self-pity as most people probably would have done, Sophie packs her things and sets out to find a solution to her problem.Sophie eventually ends up at Howl's Moving Castle, the home of the attractive young man she met earlier on. She instantly becomes friends with Howl's companions: Calcifer, the fire demon who keeps the castle whole and mobile; and Markl, Howl's child-like assistant. Sophie volunteers to be the castle's cleaning lady, and little by little she becomes better acquainted with Howl and company.Howl's Moving Castle is not a straightforward quest to break the witch's spell. Shortly after Sophie moves in the castle, she discovers a multitude of other problems which need to be addressed -- Howl's impending recruitment to the various kingdoms' armies, the outbreak of war between the lands, and the fact that Howl sacrificed his heart to Calcifer in exchange for greater powers. Sophie's own plight takes a backseat as she, Howl, and the other characters find themselves in one delicate situation after the other. The film veers away from the traditional plot progression of having the protagonist advance towards her goal, instead many events conspire to indirectly contribute to the end result. It is never really explained how Sophie goes back to being her 19-year old self, the spell just seems to evaporate bit by bit as she goes about doing what needs to be done.The art and animation are comprised of an incredible mix of hand-drawn, hand-painted, and computer-generated artwork. The combination of vibrant colors and rich textures achieve a level of detail that is simply astounding. From the castle's constantly moving gears and mechanisms to the wooden finish of the tabletops, no expense was spared in animating Howl's Moving Castle. Character designs follow the usual Miyazaki formula of plain-looking people and strange-looking magical creatures, with one exception: Howl. Howl is Miyazaki's most handsome and attractive hero yet, and he is so smoothly animated that I just could not stop looking at him. The English dubbing is generally well-done, I just found the young Sophie and Howl's voices a tad too old-sounding for their characters.Magical, romantic, and exceptionally presented, Howl's Moving Castle is undeniably a superior piece of work. While there are some tiny little loops and holes in the plot, it was all too easy to just shove them aside and lose myself in the magic of it all.",4,Unexpectedly a love story...,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3383,"['One', 'thing', 'never', 'expected', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'be', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'yet', 'exactly', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'promotional', 'images', 'mistook', 'old', 'lady', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Yubaba', 'thought', 'Howls', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'was', 'sort', 'sequel', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'two', 'are', 'totally', 'unrelated.Based', 'novel', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'mainly', 'girl', 'named', 'Sophie', 'usual', 'Miyazaki', 'heroine', 'average-looking', 'girl', 'boundless', 'inner', 'strength', 'goodness', 'whom', 'everything', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'happens', 'Sophie', 'dashing', 'young', 'man', 'start', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'actually', 'legendary', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'who', 'rumored', 'devour', 'hearts', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'smitten', 'same', 'night', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'visit', 'Sophie', 'incredibly', 'unperturbed', 'even', 'turned', 'homely', '90-year', 'old', 'woman', 'witch', 'Instead', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Sophie', 'things', 'out', 'find', 'solution', 'problem.Sophie', 'eventually', 'up', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'home', 'attractive', 'young', 'man', 'met', 'earlier', 'instantly', 'friends', 'Howl', 'companions', 'Calcifer', 'fire', 'demon', 'who', 'castle', 'whole', 'mobile', 'Markl', 'Howl', 'child-like', 'assistant', 'Sophie', 'volunteers', 'be', 'castle', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'little', 'little', 'better', 'acquainted', 'Howl', 'company.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'not', 'straightforward', 'quest', 'break', 'witch', 'spell', 'Shortly', 'Sophie', 'castle', 'multitude', 'other', 'problems', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'Howl', 'impending', 'recruitment', 'various', 'kingdoms', 'armies', 'outbreak', 'war', 'lands', 'fact', 'Howl', 'sacrificed', 'heart', 'Calcifer', 'exchange', 'greater', 'powers', 'Sophie', 'own', 'plight', 'backseat', 'Howl', 'other', 'characters', 'find', 'one', 'delicate', 'situation', 'other', 'film', 'veers', 'away', 'traditional', 'plot', 'progression', 'having', 'protagonist', 'advance', 'goal', 'instead', 'many', 'events', 'conspire', 'indirectly', 'contribute', 'end', 'result', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'how', 'Sophie', 'back', 'being', '19-year', 'old', 'self', 'spell', 'just', 'evaporate', 'bit', 'bit', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done.The', 'art', 'animation', 'are', 'comprised', 'incredible', 'mix', 'hand-drawn', 'hand-painted', 'computer-generated', 'artwork', 'combination', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'rich', 'textures', 'achieve', 'level', 'detail', 'simply', 'astounding', 'castle', 'constantly', 'moving', 'gears', 'mechanisms', 'wooden', 'finish', 'tabletops', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'animating', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Character', 'follow', 'usual', 'Miyazaki', 'formula', 'plain-looking', 'people', 'strange-looking', 'magical', 'creatures', 'one', 'exception', 'Howl', 'Howl', 'Miyazaki', 'most', 'handsome', 'attractive', 'hero', 'yet', 'so', 'smoothly', 'animated', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'looking', 'English', 'dubbing', 'generally', 'well-done', 'just', 'found', 'young', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'voices', 'tad', 'too', 'old-sounding', 'characters.Magical', 'romantic', 'exceptionally', 'presented', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'undeniably', 'superior', 'piece', 'work', 'are', 'tiny', 'little', 'loops', 'holes', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'just', 'shove', 'aside', 'lose', 'magic']",N/A

957163,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000CDGVOE,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[3, 3]","Master filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki has long been famous for his beautiful animated films (including My Neighbour Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Spirited Away), and Howl's Moving Castle is no exception. Based on the book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving castle follows Sophie on a quest to break the curse that's turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Miyazaki's heroines are always brave, resourceful, and intelligent, and Sophie, a quiet hatmaker who lives a drab existence working in her late father's shop, is no exception. When Sophie is involved with the mysterious wizard Howl, her life as she knows it changes forever as she struggles to break the curse that binds her, Howl, and the fire demon Calcifer.Miyazaki once again paints an idealized Europe of grand castles, stirring military parades, and and elegant Victorian fashions, but unlike his earlier, peaceful European-influenced town of Koriko in Kiki's Delivery Service, war is an all-too-real reality in Howl.The story is slow to develop, but ultimately captivating, although there were a few subplots that left me confused. Beautiful visuals, a European-influenced soundtrack (which, sadly, will not be distributed in North America), and a masterful story by legendary author Diana Wynne Jones makes Howl a crowd-pleaser that anime fans will enjoy.",5,"Engaging fable about love, magic, and believing in yourself",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1335,"['Master', 'filmmaker', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'long', 'been', 'famous', 'beautiful', 'animated', 'films', 'including', 'My', 'Neighbour', 'Totoro', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'exception', 'Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'castle', 'Sophie', 'quest', 'break', 'curse', 'turned', '90-year-old', 'woman', 'Miyazaki', 'heroines', 'are', 'always', 'brave', 'resourceful', 'intelligent', 'Sophie', 'quiet', 'hatmaker', 'who', 'drab', 'existence', 'working', 'late', 'father', 'shop', 'exception', 'When', 'Sophie', 'involved', 'mysterious', 'wizard', 'Howl', 'life', 'forever', 'break', 'curse', 'Howl', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer.Miyazaki', 'once', 'again', 'paints', 'idealized', 'Europe', 'grand', 'castles', 'stirring', 'military', 'parades', 'elegant', 'Victorian', 'fashions', 'earlier', 'peaceful', 'European-influenced', 'town', 'Koriko', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'war', 'all-too-real', 'reality', 'Howl.The', 'story', 'slow', 'develop', 'ultimately', 'captivating', 'were', 'few', 'subplots', 'left', 'confused', 'Beautiful', 'visuals', 'European-influenced', 'soundtrack', 'sadly', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'distributed', 'North', 'America', 'masterful', 'story', 'legendary', 'author', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'Howl', 'crowd-pleaser', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

His worksPrincess MononokeandSpirited Awayare among my favorite movies. That is why for the life of me I can't figure out why I did not watch this masterpiece before now. Maybe I thought he could not improve or even duplicate the genius displayed in his other works, but the truth is he did.This is one moving work, with plenty symbolism and nuances. I am not even going to pretend that I identified most of them, or maybe even half. What I do know is that this is one movie you want to watch multiple times since there is a lot to discover in terms of the meaning of the events that transpire and the actions of the characters. I am not going to rehash the plot, at this point most people have a clear idea about it. There are certain elements though that are thought provoking and serve as small indications of Miyazaki's genius. For example, the changes observed in Sophie according to her emotions are truly thought provoking and keep the audience mesmerized trying to understand what is going through her mind and the minds of those around her.In my mind this is Miyazaki's anti-war message, and he has chosen a very different way to communicate it than others, such as Takahata withGrave of the Fireflies. While both works are masterpieces, Takahata uses a sadder approach, while Miyazaki focuses on a more hopeful one. The main character, Sophie, finds the good in everyone she interacts with, and has an approach to life that is uplifting.Finally, the graphics and animation are top notch as is characteristic of other movies by the director, and the score by Joe Hisaishi is nothing short of fabulous.

She is rather plain. She catches the eye of a Howl, the town's badboy wizard and earns the wrath of the Witch of the Waste, an obese woman who covets Howl and his heart.While the romance between Howl and Sophie seemed a little spontaneous and the message a little questionable.

This from someone who can change his shape at will), and Sophie obsesses non-stop about her appearance, (I'm too ugly to attract anyone!)

This is a treat of a movie; a sweet and humorous ride. Howl's Moving Castle has a perfect blend of action, humor, emotion, and sheer imagination to please most viewers.The story is about an eighteen year old girl, Sophie, the eldest of two sisters. She considers herself to be plain, and her life and attitude reflect it. She has no spark or interest in anything beyond doing her dull duty to her dead father's business. Her sister, on the other hand, has a sparkling, well-loved personality and beauty to go with it. Enter the mysterious young man, Howl, who rescues Sophie early in the film. This begins to awaken longings in Sophie, and angers a witch, voiced by Lauren Bacall, who desires Howl's heart. In retribution, the witch curses Sophie, making her into a 90 year old woman. The older Sophie is excellently voiced by Jean Simmons, who gives her character the perfect blend of strength and vulnerability.Ironically, after getting over the shock of what has happened to her, Sophie begins to really live, and starts to experience life. For the first time she sees the beauty around her. What a joy this film of hope and awakening love becomes! It is a story of an odd assortment of some lonely, isolated characters that are desperately searching for love and a place to belong.Calcifer is delightfully voiced by Billy Crystal--who is utterly perfect for the role--and is so cute, if he wasn't a glob of fire, I'd want to hug him. Christian Bale voices Howl in a masculine, powerful way.The movie needs more than one viewing to understand all the nuances of the story. It is deep on more than one level, and so much fun. The animation is first class; very beautiful and detailed. My goodness, the details!The violence of war is seen in repeated bombings of cities, but there is no gore. There is no nudity or offensive language, though there is magic, and a few images of peril or ""monsters"" that might frighten little ones.This is one of Miyazaki's finest works that I highly recommend.",5,Outstanding Miyazaki Film!,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,2129,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Film', 'Just', 'writing', 'blood', 'pumping', 'little', 'faster', 'excitement', 'treat', 'movie', 'sweet', 'humorous', 'ride', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'perfect', 'blend', 'action', 'humor', 'emotion', 'sheer', 'imagination', 'please', 'most', 'viewers.The', 'story', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Sophie', 'eldest', 'two', 'sisters', 'be', 'plain', 'life', 'attitude', 'reflect', 'spark', 'interest', 'anything', 'doing', 'dull', 'duty', 'dead', 'father', 'business', 'sister', 'other', 'hand', 'sparkling', 'well-loved', 'personality', 'beauty', 'go', 'Enter', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'Howl', 'who', 'Sophie', 'early', 'film', 'awaken', 'longings', 'Sophie', 'witch', 'voiced', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'who', 'Howl', 'heart', 'retribution', 'witch', 'Sophie', 'making', '90', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'older', 'Sophie', 'excellently', 'voiced', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'who', 'character', 'perfect', 'blend', 'strength', 'vulnerability.Ironically', 'getting', 'shock', 'what', 'happened', 'Sophie', 'really', 'live', 'experience', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'beauty', 'What', 'joy', 'film', 'hope', 'awakening', 'love', 'story', 'odd', 'assortment', 'lonely', 'isolated', 'characters', 'are', 'desperately', 'searching', 'love', 'place', 'belong.Calcifer', 'delightfully', 'voiced', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'who', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'role', 'so', 'cute', 'was', ""n't"", 'glob', 'fire', ""'d"", 'want', 'hug', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'voices', 'Howl', 'masculine', 'powerful', 'way.The', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'understand', 'nuances', 'story', 'deep', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'animation', 'first', 'class', 'very', 'beautiful', 'detailed', 'goodness', 'details', 'violence', 'war', 'seen', 'repeated', 'bombings', 'cities', 'gore', 'nudity', 'offensive', 'language', 'magic', 'few', 'images', 'peril', 'monsters', 'might', 'frighten', 'little', 'ones.This', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'finest', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

But such is the nature of voice-over, I suppose. Part of my disillusionment is that I really liked Howl's Moving Castle, and for that matter, the character Howl. Howl has the reputation of a playboy, stealing the hearts of women. It gets a little scary when we learn that the reputation also includes eating their hearts. So maybe Christian Bale knew what he was doing when he took on this role. Actually, he probably knew exactly what he was doing. One of the most engaging parts about Howl is that he fits the celebrity persona to a ""T"". I'm serious. He's flashy, cocky, self-absorbed and cowardly. And worse, he has the good looks to get away with all of it! However, like some celebrities, he actually turns out to be a likable narcissist.Howl meets Sophie, who is diametrically different than himself. She's plain in appearance and without an ounce of pretense; and somehow this garners a genuine interest from Howl. Sophie pays the price though when a jealous witch retaliates by turning her into an old woman. From here the story begins. And what a story it is. After all, it's not often that you get to see a child-friendly story about a loving attraction between a Magician Playboy and a 90 year old woman. Sure, underneath the elderly spell Sophie is really only 18 years old (qualifying her as the ideal celebrity obsessed groupie). But until she can break the witch's spell she'll have to wrestle with her achy breaky heart and her achy breaky bones. Howl may be a magician, but he has no magic to help her arthritis, and Celebrex hasn't yet hit the market.The magic of this magical tale comes part from the source book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones; but also because of the storytelling flair of director Hayao Miyazaki. Unlike Disney films that have a predictable story structure, Miyazaki's films usually indulge in a playful circuitous ""2nd act"" that gives no indication of when it will ever get back on track and head for the end of the story. In this case, the visuals are so lush that this is exactly what you want: to forget that you are watching a movie and get lost in Miyazaki's meandering imagination.The other thing about Miyazaki is that his characters walk right up to the line of clich&eacute; and then make a sharp detour. For instance, the witch that casts her spell on Sophie turns out to be, well, not quite a bad woman after all. In fact, she's an endearing old lady herself with a bit of sass. And as I pointed out before, Howl is not the perfectly mannered male that we're used to in most kid-cozy animations. He's a brat, but a very likable one. These character twists keep the story from being a typical tale of good and evil. Instead, everybody is delightfully idiosyncratic - especially the fire demon Calcifer, who is voiced by Billy Crystal.And then, of course, there's the castle itself, which I'd triple what I currently pay in rent to turn into my new abode. But until the castle comes a-walkin' in my 'hood, I'll settle for repeat viewings of this excellent DVD, which I've done more times than I'll ever admit.",5,Is That Really Christian Bale?,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3256,"['Still', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'who', 'set', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'dropped', 'enough', 'F-Bombs', 'defeat', 'Germans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'same', 'man', 'doing', 'voice', 'Howl', 'such', 'nature', 'voice-over', 'suppose', 'Part', 'disillusionment', 'really', 'liked', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'matter', 'character', 'Howl', 'Howl', 'reputation', 'playboy', 'stealing', 'hearts', 'women', 'little', 'scary', 'when', 'learn', 'reputation', 'also', 'eating', 'hearts', 'So', 'maybe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'took', 'role', 'Actually', 'probably', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'One', 'most', 'engaging', 'parts', 'Howl', 'celebrity', 'persona', 'T', ""'m"", 'serious', 'flashy', 'cocky', 'self-absorbed', 'cowardly', 'worse', 'good', 'looks', 'get', 'away', 'However', 'celebrities', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'likable', 'narcissist.Howl', 'meets', 'Sophie', 'who', 'diametrically', 'different', 'plain', 'appearance', 'ounce', 'pretense', 'somehow', 'garners', 'genuine', 'interest', 'Howl', 'Sophie', 'price', 'when', 'jealous', 'witch', 'retaliates', 'turning', 'old', 'woman', 'here', 'story', 'what', 'story', 'not', 'often', 'get', 'see', 'child-friendly', 'story', 'loving', 'attraction', 'Magician', 'Playboy', '90', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'Sure', 'elderly', 'spell', 'Sophie', 'really', 'only', '18', 'years', 'old', 'qualifying', 'ideal', 'celebrity', 'obsessed', 'groupie', 'can', 'break', 'witch', 'spell', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wrestle', 'achy', 'breaky', 'heart', 'achy', 'breaky', 'bones', 'Howl', 'may', 'be', 'magician', 'magic', 'help', 'arthritis', 'Celebrex', ""n't"", 'yet', 'hit', 'market.The', 'magic', 'magical', 'tale', 'part', 'source', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'also', 'storytelling', 'flair', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Unlike', 'Disney', 'films', 'have', 'predictable', 'story', 'structure', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'usually', 'indulge', 'playful', 'circuitous', '2nd', 'act', 'indication', 'when', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'head', 'end', 'story', 'case', 'visuals', 'are', 'so', 'lush', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'get', 'lost', 'Miyazaki', 'meandering', 'imagination.The', 'other', 'thing', 'Miyazaki', 'characters', 'walk', 'right', 'up', 'line', 'clich', 'eacute', 'then', 'make', 'sharp', 'detour', 'instance', 'witch', 'spell', 'Sophie', 'out', 'be', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'bad', 'woman', 'fact', 'endearing', 'old', 'lady', 'bit', 'sass', 'pointed', 'out', 'Howl', 'not', 'perfectly', 'mannered', 'male', ""'re"", 'used', 'most', 'kid-cozy', 'animations', 'brat', 'very', 'likable', 'one', 'character', 'twists', 'keep', 'story', 'being', 'typical', 'tale', 'good', 'evil', 'Instead', 'everybody', 'delightfully', 'idiosyncratic', 'especially', 'fire', 'demon', 'Calcifer', 'who', 'voiced', 'Billy', 'Crystal.And', 'then', 'course', 'castle', ""'d"", 'triple', 'what', 'currently', 'pay', 'rent', 'turn', 'new', 'abode', 'castle', 'a-walkin', ""'hood"", ""'ll"", 'settle', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'excellent', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'times', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'admit']",N/A
957178,A3VO445C7FUJ7I,B000CDGVOE,Sonomi,"[15, 15]","This movie is superb. Contrary to a few critics who babble out the line ""I don't get it"" and then proceed to rip on this movie, I think the fact that many parts of this movie are not dumbed down and explained to you word-for-word (one of Director Miyazaki's trademarks - letting you use your mind, letting you as the viewer, use your imagination) is what makes it one-of-a-kind. Unique.Howl's Moving Castle is not only a very entertaining movie, its artwork is pheonomenal. You can see Studio Ghibli's animators' talents in amazing detail - from the beautiful landscapes (the studio capitalized on their artists who were trained in impressionistic artwork), gorgeous scenery, and the beautiful color, character drawings that can display so much emotion without words, and creativity that unfortunately cannot be seen in much of mainstream animation today. And I have yet to mention the amazing score by Joe Hisaishi. Music so lovely it will sweep you off your feet.A warning to fans of Diana Wynne Jones's novel from which this movie is loosely based, and ""loosely"" is a good word. The story does deviate much from the book. But before those loyal to the novel start screaming in outrage, it is good to note that Miyazaki creates a beautiful story separate of Diana Jones, using her much loved characters, and in my opinion, enhances them, adds a bit of visual magic, and adds to their appeal. And a final note to hopefully mollify the novel-faithful, Diana Wynne Jones herself was very pleased with the outcome of the movie and Miyazaki's rendition of her works.Finally, the English dubbing. I was horrified with Disney's English dubbing of Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi), Miyazaki's predecessor to Howl. Not only did they add English dubbing that dumbed down the script, the main characters voices were incongruent with the ages of the characters. Disney added a horrific commercialized voice for one of the main characters as well. BUT! I must go against all of my previous beliefs for Howl's Moving Castle. I've seen both the English and Japanese versions, and for once.... I almost feel the English version is BETTER (yes.. never in my life). The voice actors do a great job conveying the emotions of the movie. There is no deviance in the storyline. And if anything does seems confusing, its not due to the script, its more due the fact that it is a busy movie with lots of subplots.The storyline briefly, is about a young girl, Sophie Hatter, who encounters a mysterious young wizard named Howl. (Chance encounter, or fate?) The jealous Witch of the Waste transforms Sophie into an aged woman. This takes Sophie on a journey where she discovers Howl's Moving Castle, a host of other interesting characters, and Howl himself, the enigmatic wizard to which her fate is entwined....Watch, enjoy, and use your mind and imagination to figure out the parts you may not understand at first glance, and you may find this movie to be truly delightful.

It follows a young girl called Sophie who has a spell cast upon her and her relationship with a wizard named Howl. It has the usual high class animation and a slightly off kilter, fantasy feel. It isn't as warm as 'Kiki's delivery service' or 'My Neighbour Totoro', but is more like 'Spirited Away', here you have blob henchmen and strange crow wizard hybrids. It is much more surreal overall. Even scenes without any major benefit to the story are rendered so beautifully that every second of the film is a delight to watch. This film would probably be enjoyed more by adults due to it's protracted storyline and darker feel, yet it has more than enough to delight a younger audience as well, I'm thinking especially of the talking fire demon.

I was really looking forward to watching this film but was left a bit disappointed.  Howl's moving castle is a great movie, but it's not his best. Overall, compared to most movies out there it's still a good movie.Unlike most of Miyazaki's work, this movie was based on source material written by someone else other than Miyazaki himself. The film still shares much of Miyazaki's strengths such as his astonishing attention to detail and unparalleled artistic ability. The castle itself threatens to upstage the whole movie. So the art is not the flaw in this movie, it's the plot.The movie centralizes around a simple young woman named Sophie who works in a hat shop. Sophie isn't an extraordinarily beautiful woman and is portrayed by most as simple and plain. One day while walking home from work in her small, European country town she's harassed by obnoxious solders when Howl comes to her aid. Unfortunately, at this same time Howl is being chased by these black globby things from another world. This spirals Sophie into Howls troubles between the Witch of the Waste whom puts a spell onto Sophie turning her into an old crone. Sophie then goes in search of Howls castle since she's too ashamed to stay in her town. After finding the moving castle she becomes Howls housekeeper and assistant. She brings life and warmth back into the castle.Meanwhile, Howl has periods of absence while he fights for two kings who have gone to war with eachother over a missing prince. As he fights in these battles he transforms himself into this winged creature. Every transformation leaves Howl weaker and weaker leading it to be more difficult to revert to his human form. Eventually, Sophie figures out the secret to her and Howls curse and saves the day. There is a strong anti-war and anti-violence message at the end of the film. Though the plot had potential and was very creative, it grew murky and confusing in several parts.Overall, the movie was very visually stimulating, but the plot was extremely hard to follow, especially for younger audiences. As a person who has seen every movie produced by Miyazaki I had to add this to the list, but if this had been my first introduction to his films I probably would be very skeptical to see another. Do not see this if this is your first film by him; see Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, or Princess Mononoke. Don't let this be your first impression of Miyazaki's work. However, if you are already a fan of his work, see it but don't expect it to be as good as his previous work.  It is a bit unfair, I admit, to criticize this film too much though. It's just I think Miyazaki set the bar so high for himself this movie just seems kind of mediocre compared to the rest of his work.",3,"Not Miyazaki's best, but still a good movie",1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,2810,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Miyazaki', 'movies', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'favorites', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'best', 'Overall', 'compared', 'most', 'movies', 'still', 'good', 'movie.Unlike', 'most', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'source', 'material', 'written', 'someone', 'else', 'other', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'still', 'shares', 'much', 'Miyazaki', 'strengths', 'such', 'astonishing', 'attention', 'detail', 'unparalleled', 'artistic', 'ability', 'castle', 'upstage', 'whole', 'movie', 'art', 'not', 'flaw', 'movie', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'simple', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Sophie', 'who', 'hat', 'shop', 'Sophie', ""n't"", 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'portrayed', 'most', 'as', 'simple', 'plain', 'One', 'day', 'walking', 'home', 'work', 'small', 'European', 'country', 'town', 'harassed', 'obnoxious', 'solders', 'when', 'Howl', 'aid', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'time', 'Howl', 'being', 'chased', 'black', 'globby', 'things', 'world', 'Sophie', 'Howls', 'troubles', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'whom', 'spell', 'Sophie', 'turning', 'old', 'crone', 'Sophie', 'then', 'search', 'Howls', 'castle', 'too', 'ashamed', 'stay', 'town', 'finding', 'moving', 'castle', 'Howls', 'housekeeper', 'assistant', 'life', 'warmth', 'back', 'castle.Meanwhile', 'Howl', 'periods', 'absence', 'two', 'kings', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'war', 'eachother', 'missing', 'prince', 'battles', 'winged', 'creature', 'transformation', 'Howl', 'weaker', 'weaker', 'leading', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'revert', 'human', 'form', 'Eventually', 'Sophie', 'out', 'secret', 'Howls', 'curse', 'day', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'anti-violence', 'message', 'end', 'film', 'plot', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'very', 'creative', 'grew', 'murky', 'confusing', 'several', 'parts.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'plot', 'was', 'extremely', 'hard', 'follow', 'especially', 'younger', 'audiences', 'person', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'produced', 'Miyazaki', 'had', 'add', 'list', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'introduction', 'films', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'skeptical', 'see', 'Do', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'film', 'see', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'first', 'impression', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'However', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'work', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'work', 'bit', 'unfair', 'admit', 'criticize', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'think', 'Miyazaki', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'mediocre', 'compared', 'rest', 'work']",N/A

Howl met her when she was accosted by a couple of men.  From their first meeting clues are given to how the movie is going to unfold.  This is because Howl commands Sophie to act natural within moments of their initial meeting.  Howl feels at ease with her, and even engages in some magic within minutes of meeting her.  Another female is interested in him, and is a character foil to Sophia.

Gibbs,"[4, 5]","Howl's Moving Castle seemed so much in keeping with Miyazaki's previous work that I was surprised to discover at the end that it is an adaptation of a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, a prolific British author of young adult fantasies. So many of the classic Miyazaki themes are present: transformation, whimsy, villains who turn out to be not so bad once you understand them, and of course a plucky young woman. Except that she isn't young through most of the film, and I applaud Miyazaki for having an elderly woman as a protagonist (even if she is really a young woman under a curse).I haven't read the novel, but I suspect that it develops more fully some of the plot threads given short shrift in the movie. I imagine that Japanese audiences are more comfortable with this than many Western viewers. We are left to speculate about the motivations of the King's wizard, Sulliman. Was Sulliman responsible for turnip-head's curse? Did Sulliman foment the war to consolidate her power and enslave the other wizards? None of these questions are answered, and Miyazaki is clearly not very interested in answering them--indeed, I believe that he intends for the war to seem arbitrary and obscure.As has been the case for Disney versions of other Miyazaki films, the English voice talent is very fine. Still, I look forward to hearing the Japanese version. In particular, I can't help wondering if Calcifer the fire demon Calcifer is played quite so broadly in the Japanese version as it is by Billy Crystal in the dub. Authenticity aside, Crystal's version works.Of course, being a Miyazaki film, the animation is just beautiful, putting to sham all but the best classic Disney. In the past, Disney has supported Miyazaki's films with good voice talent, but given them little promotion.  At least Howl is actually showing up in theaters.

957194,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B000CDGVOE,Theo,"[1, 1]","Howl's Moving Castle works beautifully as a pure flight of fantasy, and one that even fairly young children ought to be able to enjoy on that level. At the same time, it also works as a more introspective tale; one that dwells at some length on the underlying ""logic of magic""; which is to say on the logic of our own psyches. In the world of Howl's Moving Castle, wizards can ultimately pay a terrible price for unleashing the more destructive applications of their art.Or, as St. Paul might have said, the wages of sin is death.Of course, one could also adopt a more literal and overtly political take on this movie. Warfare, both magical and mundane, is at the root of all the really serious carnage in the world of Howl's Moving Castle. One can't help but remember that this is, after all, a film that comes out of a nation completely devastated by its own last foray into military adventurism. But whatever way you want to look at it, this is a film with something to say for itself. A film with sufficient depth that it is worth taking the time to consider alternative interpretations.Like much of Miyazaki's work, Howl's Moving Castle includes a certain level of sentimentalism. However, judged by western standards it is actually kind of sneaky, even deceptive in this. For just when you think you're in a sweet little kid's movie, without any warning you can suddenly find that you're really in a very adult place indeed. The contrasts here are not quite so sharp as inPorco Rosso, but they are sharp enough nonetheless. Incidentally, one of the things that I personally love most about exploring the media of other cultures is just how viscerally it can make one realize the arbitrariness of the conventions of genre to be found in one's own home culture; conventions that are otherwise all too easy to simply take for granted, as if they were somehow hard-wired into the nature of story itself.Howl's Moving Castle is also rather interesting in the world it envisions. This is neither our own reality nor the standard swords and sorcery milieu, but a kind of 19th century fantasia almost steampunk in trope. On the down side though, one thing I didn't like about this movie was that the war that forms the backdrop to so much of the action is never really explained in any intelligent way - especially in the ending.Overall though, I would definitely say that provided you can deal with a certain level of sentimentality, this is a movie worth seeing. And if you do happen to be an adult looking for something you can watch with the kids without being bored to tears, this may just fit the bill.Theo.",4,Whimsy With Depth,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,2611,"['Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'beautifully', 'pure', 'flight', 'fantasy', 'one', 'even', 'fairly', 'young', 'children', 'ought', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'level', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'more', 'introspective', 'tale', 'one', 'length', 'underlying', 'logic', 'magic', 'say', 'logic', 'own', 'psyches', 'world', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'wizards', 'can', 'ultimately', 'pay', 'terrible', 'price', 'unleashing', 'more', 'destructive', 'applications', 'art.Or', 'St.', 'Paul', 'might', 'have', 'said', 'wages', 'sin', 'death.Of', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'adopt', 'more', 'literal', 'overtly', 'political', 'take', 'movie', 'Warfare', 'magical', 'mundane', 'root', 'really', 'serious', 'carnage', 'world', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'film', 'nation', 'completely', 'devastated', 'own', 'last', 'foray', 'military', 'adventurism', 'way', 'want', 'look', 'film', 'something', 'say', 'film', 'sufficient', 'depth', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'consider', 'alternative', 'interpretations.Like', 'much', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'certain', 'level', 'sentimentalism', 'However', 'judged', 'western', 'standards', 'actually', 'kind', 'sneaky', 'even', 'deceptive', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'sweet', 'little', 'kid', 'movie', 'warning', 'can', 'suddenly', 'find', ""'re"", 'really', 'very', 'adult', 'place', 'indeed', 'contrasts', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'sharp', 'inPorco', 'Rosso', 'are', 'sharp', 'enough', 'nonetheless', 'Incidentally', 'one', 'things', 'personally', 'love', 'most', 'exploring', 'media', 'other', 'cultures', 'just', 'how', 'viscerally', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'realize', 'arbitrariness', 'conventions', 'genre', 'be', 'found', 'one', 'own', 'home', 'culture', 'conventions', 'are', 'otherwise', 'all', 'too', 'easy', 'simply', 'take', 'granted', 'were', 'somehow', 'hard-wired', 'nature', 'story', 'itself.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'also', 'rather', 'interesting', 'world', 'own', 'reality', 'standard', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'milieu', 'kind', '19th', 'century', 'fantasia', 'almost', 'steampunk', 'trope', 'down', 'side', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'war', 'backdrop', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'intelligent', 'way', 'especially', 'ending.Overall', 'would', 'definitely', 'say', 'provided', 'can', 'deal', 'certain', 'level', 'sentimentality', 'movie', 'seeing', 'do', 'happen', 'be', 'adult', 'looking', 'something', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'being', 'bored', 'tears', 'may', 'just', 'fit', 'bill.Theo']",N/A

957198,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CDGVOE,Tsuyoshi,"[292, 309]","(In fact 4.5 Stars)  Though 'Howl's Moving Castle' ('Hauru-no Ugoku Shiro') may not be Miyazaki's best film, it is still far more enjoyable than many other films, Japanese or American, animated or not.  I for one very much enjoyed watching it, and I love the film for its interesting characters and the rich textures of the designs, especially the fantasy world itself where witchcraft and humans' mundane works can be seen side by side.  And the titular six-legged castle that really walks among the wilderness is something you never see except in his films.Miyazaki's new film is based on a book of the same title written by Diana Wynne Jones.  The film's story is told from the viewpoint of a 18-year-old girl Sophie, who is working at a milliner's shop every day.  But she can hear the sound of bloody battles from the distance, and it is clear that this beautiful country, where witches and wizards live among humans, is going to see another war sooner or later.But apparently Sophie is still leading an ordianary life until her uneventful routine days are suddenly broken by one accidental meeting with wicked 'Witch of the Waste,' who turns her into an old woman with a curse.  Seeking for her place to live, Sophie goes to the wilderness where, the townspeople say, a young wizard named Howl wanders.  In fact, Sophie encounters Howl's Moving Castle in the foggy moutainside, and she decides to hop in.  There, forbidden to talk about her curse, she starts a new life with young and handsome Howl, who speaks to her kindly like a prince, but at times acts like a spoiled child.[MIYAZAKI'S LOVE STORY] You will be impressed with many fantastic and colorful images created by Miyazaki.  You might find an anti-war message deep in the film's story, but will find the romantic relations between Sophie and Howl is the most touching and impressive part of the film.  Sophie's romantic feeling towards Howl is expressed in a unique way (which I don't disclose here), and Miyazaki, as usual, is very good at drawing the character of this independent heroine.  One interesting thing is, probably this is the first case in which Miyazaki attempted to show a love story in his films.  And a kiss too.I must say that not everything works in 'Howl's Moving Castle.'  I haven't read the original book, but it is obvious that Miyazaki made changes.  Not that I'm blaming them.  But the story is sometimes told too hurriedly, and when you think something (actions or whatever) will start, it ends abruptly.  Howl's character is full of contradictory traits, that's good, but his complicated personality could have been more effective and convincing with more detailed episodes about, say, his mentor magician (and politician) Madam Suliman or Witch of the Waste.(If I am not mistaken, 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a rare case for Miyazaki who prefers to use his own stories, and this is the first time he adapts someone else's story in 15 years, last time being 'Kiki's Delivery Service.  But 'Kiki's' story written by Eiko Kadono is not long -- I know, I read -- while 'Howl's' story is, I think, much longer.  Maybe these facts have soemthing to do with my complaint.)Greatly helped by Jo Hisaishi's beautiful score, 'Howl's Moving Castle' is full of imaginative power, with one strong heroine you can relate to (though she is 90-years-old), plus memorable supports including fire damon Calcifer, (not a bad guy at all), and ubiquitous Prince Turnip who always appears at the right moment.  Flawed, to be sure, but enjoyable fantasy tale with a healthy amount of humor and lots of imagination.The review above refers to the original Japanese version.  I know the English version includes the voices of Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Billy Crystal, but as I have never seen the version, I did not talk about them.  Still, as Mr. Miyazaki is not likely to approve any changes done to his films, I hope what I saw in Japan, you will see in your country.",5,A Wizard Boy Meets a Girl: Poetic Fantasy in Magical World,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,3945,"['fact', '4.5', 'Stars', 'Though', ""'Howl"", 'Moving', 'Castle', ""'Hauru-no"", 'Ugoku', 'Shiro', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Miyazaki', 'best', 'film', 'still', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Japanese', 'American', 'animated', 'not', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'watching', 'love', 'film', 'interesting', 'characters', 'rich', 'textures', 'designs', 'especially', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'witchcraft', 'humans', 'mundane', 'works', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'side', 'side', 'titular', 'six-legged', 'castle', 'really', 'wilderness', 'something', 'never', 'see', 'films.Miyazaki', 'new', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'Diana', 'Wynne', 'Jones', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'viewpoint', '18-year-old', 'girl', 'Sophie', 'who', 'working', 'milliner', 'shop', 'day', 'can', 'hear', 'sound', 'bloody', 'battles', 'distance', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'country', 'where', 'witches', 'wizards', 'live', 'humans', 'going', 'see', 'war', 'sooner', 'later.But', 'apparently', 'Sophie', 'still', 'leading', 'ordianary', 'life', 'uneventful', 'routine', 'days', 'are', 'suddenly', 'broken', 'one', 'accidental', 'meeting', 'wicked', ""'Witch"", 'Waste', 'who', 'old', 'woman', 'curse', 'Seeking', 'place', 'live', 'Sophie', 'wilderness', 'where', 'townspeople', 'say', 'young', 'wizard', 'named', 'Howl', 'wanders', 'fact', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'foggy', 'moutainside', 'hop', 'forbidden', 'talk', 'curse', 'new', 'life', 'young', 'handsome', 'Howl', 'who', 'kindly', 'prince', 'times', 'acts', 'spoiled', 'child', '[', 'MIYAZAKI', 'LOVE', 'STORY', ']', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'many', 'fantastic', 'colorful', 'images', 'created', 'Miyazaki', 'might', 'find', 'anti-war', 'message', 'deep', 'film', 'story', 'will', 'find', 'romantic', 'relations', 'Sophie', 'Howl', 'most', 'touching', 'impressive', 'part', 'film', 'Sophie', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'towards', 'Howl', 'expressed', 'unique', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'here', 'Miyazaki', 'usual', 'very', 'good', 'drawing', 'character', 'independent', 'heroine', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'probably', 'first', 'case', 'Miyazaki', 'attempted', 'show', 'love', 'story', 'films', 'kiss', 'too.I', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'everything', 'works', ""'Howl"", 'Moving', 'Castle', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'book', 'obvious', 'Miyazaki', 'made', 'changes', 'Not', ""'m"", 'blaming', 'story', 'sometimes', 'told', 'too', 'hurriedly', 'when', 'think', 'something', 'actions', 'whatever', 'will', 'start', 'abruptly', 'Howl', 'character', 'full', 'contradictory', 'traits', 'good', 'complicated', 'personality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'convincing', 'more', 'detailed', 'episodes', 'say', 'mentor', 'magician', 'politician', 'Madam', 'Suliman', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'rare', 'case', 'Miyazaki', 'who', 'use', 'own', 'stories', 'first', 'time', 'someone', 'else', 'story', '15', 'years', 'last', 'time', 'being', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'story', 'written', 'Eiko', 'Kadono', 'not', 'long', 'know', 'read', 'story', 'think', 'much', 'longer', 'Maybe', 'facts', 'have', 'soemthing', 'do', 'complaint', 'Greatly', 'helped', 'Jo', 'Hisaishi', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'full', 'imaginative', 'power', 'one', 'strong', 'heroine', 'can', 'relate', '90-years-old', 'memorable', 'supports', 'including', 'fire', 'damon', 'Calcifer', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'ubiquitous', 'Prince', 'Turnip', 'who', 'always', 'right', 'moment', 'Flawed', 'be', 'sure', 'enjoyable', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'healthy', 'amount', 'humor', 'lots', 'imagination.The', 'review', 'refers', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'know', 'English', 'version', 'voices', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'Still', 'Mr.', 'Miyazaki', 'not', 'likely', 'approve', 'changes', 'done', 'films', 'hope', 'what', 'saw', 'Japan', 'will', 'see', 'country']",N/A

957200,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B000CDGVOE,V.C.,"[7, 18]","There is a certain quirk to this movie: it gives you what is expected, but yet it falls short in giving everything that should have been expected, if that makes sense. As usual, the animation is incredible, everything that you'd expect from a Miyazaki film. Now I know it's a bit silly to compare this movie to the likes of Spirited Away, which was truly his BEST work. Just like all of his movies, there's a certain charm, character, and theme, each one so magical and unique that it's hard to really compare one from the rest. But something was missing in Howl's Moving Castle...the magic is still there, but what was lacking the most was character development, and the development of a plot in general. We barely get to know the main character before her whole world changes. These changes happen so quickly, making it ambiguous to follow. With nothing that interesting about the main character to begin with, before she turned into an old lady, which didn't really make it any more or less interesting, it's hard to really care or sympathize with her. Why should we care? We never get to know her. As for the other characters, there seems to be so much depth, but it's never shown or revealed. We don't know anything about their past, at least not enough that would give us a clear picture of who they are and where they've come from. As for Howl...I just didn't get him. Charming and gorgeous looking character, but his strangness comes off as being a bit too one-dimensional. We never get to know more about his past, except a bit of his childhood, which didn't make much sense. What made his past so unique? Why does Sophie all of a sudden fall in love with him? For what reason? I can tell love is the main theme here, and so was Spirited Away, but at least in that movie there was more of a reason and link behind the two characters. Here, it's just fluff. No depth, and just not believable. But overall, this movie is visually stunning, but unfortunately it's not Miyazaki's best film.

She's young, but that trait becomes very amiguous. Keep watching, it matters. Second, there's his passion for flight. This time, he takes it personally in the person of Howl, but fantastic flying machines abound. And somehow, no one ever seems to think twice about a thousand meters of air between them and the ground. It's just another comfortable, happy place for a person to be. Third, there is mythology. Miyazaki always taps into something ancient and familiar, and makes it into something brand new and familiar. Black smokestacks and white steam clouds fill his cities, but gently. They make a play of light and dark while serving the people - they're not Dickens' choking smogs.Best, he lets some of his myths be modern. I'm sure everyone has seen the nature shows where microscopic beasties swim, lit up, against a dark field. Remember how their little tendrils beat against the water, in some delicate rythm? Miyazaki invoked that modern archetype of biological function for some of his fliers. Even in his war machines, he draws man as just one of nature's citizens.I won't spoil the movie for you, but there are trials of many kinds and all the right people end up victorious.

The best aspects of Miyazaki's stories are all here: no villains other than human stupidity and ego, no idiotic indulgence in revenge, no mindless gratuitous conflict between characters; instead there's introspection, mystery, aspiration, the beauty of the world, determination, unflinching honesty, and above all, kindness and true love.

957210,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000CDGVOE,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","My daughter and I are ardent fans of Hayao Miyazaki's animated features.My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition)is one of our favorites for its sweet story and adorable characters, not to mention the subtle message of conservation.Kiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVDis another favorite for its inspiring story of a young witch in training who fulfills her dreams.Howl's Moving Castle takes viewers into a fantastical world of magic and fairy tale-like settings. A young girl, Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer) works in her mother's hat shop, leading a rather humdrum existence until one fateful evening when she is visited by the Witch of the Waste (voiced by Lauren Bacall). Sophie inadvertently offends the witch who transforms her into a very old woman (voiced by Jean Simmons). Horrified by her appearance, Sophie embarks on a quest to undo the spell and begins an amazing adventure. She meets many interesting characters - there's a strange scarecrow with human-like instincts; markl, Howl's young apprentice; Heen, a cute wheezing dog; Calcifer, a sort of fire demon; and of course, Howl, a young and reckless wizard (voiced by Christian Bale).Through her adventures, Sophie learns that she has much untapped potential, and gradually sheds her insecurities and low self-esteem. There's plenty in this enchanting story to captivate audiences young and old - romance, magic, and lots of adventure!",5,Let your imagination take flight with Howl's Moving Castle!,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,1424,"['daughter', 'are', 'ardent', 'fans', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'animated', 'features.My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'one', 'favorites', 'sweet', 'story', 'adorable', 'characters', 'not', 'mention', 'subtle', 'message', 'conservation.Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Special', 'Edition', '2-Disc', 'DVDis', 'favorite', 'inspiring', 'story', 'young', 'witch', 'training', 'who', 'dreams.Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'viewers', 'fantastical', 'world', 'magic', 'fairy', 'tale-like', 'settings', 'young', 'girl', 'Sophie', 'voiced', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'mother', 'hat', 'shop', 'leading', 'rather', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'one', 'fateful', 'evening', 'when', 'visited', 'Witch', 'Waste', 'voiced', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Sophie', 'inadvertently', 'witch', 'who', 'very', 'old', 'woman', 'voiced', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Horrified', 'appearance', 'Sophie', 'quest', 'undo', 'spell', 'amazing', 'adventure', 'many', 'interesting', 'characters', 'strange', 'scarecrow', 'human-like', 'instincts', 'markl', 'Howl', 'young', 'apprentice', 'Heen', 'cute', 'wheezing', 'dog', 'Calcifer', 'sort', 'fire', 'demon', 'course', 'Howl', 'young', 'reckless', 'wizard', 'voiced', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'adventures', 'Sophie', 'much', 'untapped', 'potential', 'gradually', 'insecurities', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'plenty', 'enchanting', 'story', 'captivate', 'audiences', 'young', 'old', 'romance', 'magic', 'lots', 'adventure']",N/A
