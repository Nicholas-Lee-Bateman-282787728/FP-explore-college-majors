Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 10]","What happened in this movie to turn it from art house special to probably never making it to the television circuit?  Let's begin with the title.  It was never explained why it was called The Crossing Guard. Normally the title is used in films or it will express the overall emotion or theme of the film. In Penn's ditty, it did neither. There was even an embarrassing scene when Nicholson is driving by a crossing guard giving him a look going very slowly (in slo-motion) trying to build an emotional scene.  The scene made no sense.This will lead me to the next complaint. There was no consistency with this film. The characters were so underdeveloped that you really never had an idea what they wanted from this film or why they wanted to do this film. It felt like Nicholson was just repaying a favor for Penn. This was Nicholson's token must cry movie. I still have no clue why Anjelica Houston's character was so frigid. I did not understand any of these characters in this film. It was as if I never got to know them, yet somehow had to watch their life. Speaking of consistency, it would have been great to have some back-story in this film.I thought that it started decently, but I would have liked to see what this family was like prior to the accident. I could have used a strong point-counterpoint. If the family were happy, going to the beach, in constant sunlight prior to the accident, then it would have provided a great start to the downfall after the accident. I would have also liked to see the relationship between Freddy and his daughter prior to the accident; it would have shed some better light as to why he was so avid on revenge and why Mary was easily able to put it behind her. Again, more consistency would have helped hold this film together easier.Also, there really wasn't a story either.  Using the rule of following a plot from point A to B to C, this film created the sense that I had jumped exactly at the B part.  There was no A, half of the B was missing, and we were headed straight towards the C.  That confused me greatly.I have read some reviews for this film that have praised what Penn has done to this film and story. I have no clue if these critics have seen the same film or not.Overall, this film was a jumbled mess of horror. It reminded me of walking into a child's room looking on the floor and seeing all sorts of toys, games, clothes, and stuffed animals just lying on the floor.  I said this at the beginning of this review, and I will say it again, this film was a ""mess"".Grade:  * out of *****",1,Freedom is overrated.,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2549,"['What', 'happened', 'movie', 'turn', 'art', 'house', 'special', 'probably', 'never', 'making', 'television', 'circuit', 'Let', 'begin', 'title', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'was', 'called', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'Normally', 'title', 'used', 'films', 'will', 'express', 'overall', 'emotion', 'theme', 'film', 'Penn', 'ditty', 'did', 'neither', 'was', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'scene', 'when', 'Nicholson', 'driving', 'crossing', 'guard', 'giving', 'look', 'going', 'very', 'slowly', 'slo-motion', 'trying', 'build', 'emotional', 'scene', 'scene', 'made', 'sense.This', 'will', 'lead', 'next', 'complaint', 'was', 'consistency', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'really', 'never', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'wanted', 'film', 'why', 'wanted', 'do', 'film', 'felt', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'just', 'repaying', 'favor', 'Penn', 'was', 'Nicholson', 'token', 'must', 'cry', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'frigid', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'yet', 'somehow', 'had', 'watch', 'life', 'Speaking', 'consistency', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'back-story', 'film.I', 'thought', 'started', 'decently', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'what', 'family', 'was', 'prior', 'accident', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'strong', 'point-counterpoint', 'family', 'were', 'happy', 'going', 'beach', 'constant', 'sunlight', 'prior', 'accident', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'great', 'start', 'downfall', 'accident', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'liked', 'see', 'relationship', 'Freddy', 'daughter', 'prior', 'accident', 'would', 'have', 'shed', 'better', 'light', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'avid', 'revenge', 'why', 'Mary', 'was', 'easily', 'able', 'put', 'Again', 'more', 'consistency', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'easier.Also', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'either', 'Using', 'rule', 'following', 'plot', 'point', 'B', 'C', 'film', 'created', 'sense', 'had', 'jumped', 'exactly', 'B', 'part', 'was', 'A', 'half', 'B', 'was', 'missing', 'were', 'headed', 'straight', 'towards', 'C.', 'That', 'confused', 'greatly.I', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'praised', 'what', 'Penn', 'done', 'film', 'story', 'have', 'clue', 'critics', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'film', 'not.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'horror', 'reminded', 'walking', 'child', 'room', 'looking', 'floor', 'seeing', 'sorts', 'toys', 'games', 'clothes', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'just', 'lying', 'floor', 'said', 'beginning', 'review', 'will', 'say', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'mess', '.Grade', '*', '*****']",Crossing Guard VHS

However this one turns out to be a movie of 2 guys who have to deal with their tribulations. Jack Nicholeson who looses his 7 yr old daughter and obsessed in killing the guy (David morse). David kills his daughter in an dunken driving accident and comes of prison but still plagued by Guilt. The plot turns out with an ending where two people give up their irrationality and accept themselves.This movie potrays deep emotions traumatized souls (as all sean movies) in a symbolic way but however suffers with poor script. David is not suited for this role and doesn't play the emotions of guilt.The way he acts shows as if his personality doesn't have emotions at all. Forget guilt. The romance between David and Robert Penn is not developed properly. Surprising that the romance is not focussed in the movie when movie revolves around Jack who spends time with young girls without any drama involved.Inspite of poor script, Jack gives great performance..as good as it gets on would think. Jack's ex-wife plays her role with ease. The audience can get the taste of melodrama of troubled souls finding peace at the end. All in all, it is average movie with simple plot.This movie is no match for 'The pledge' which is chilling and brilliant thriller although theree are some similarities.",3,About Redemption,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1397,"['saw', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'Penn', 'pledge', 'similiarities', 'man', 'obsessed', 'goal', 'However', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'movie', '2', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'tribulations', 'Jack', 'Nicholeson', 'who', '7', 'yr', 'old', 'daughter', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'guy', 'David', 'morse', 'David', 'daughter', 'dunken', 'driving', 'accident', 'prison', 'still', 'plagued', 'Guilt', 'plot', 'out', 'ending', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'give', 'up', 'irrationality', 'accept', 'themselves.This', 'movie', 'potrays', 'deep', 'emotions', 'traumatized', 'souls', 'sean', 'movies', 'symbolic', 'way', 'however', 'suffers', 'poor', 'script', 'David', 'not', 'suited', 'role', ""n't"", 'play', 'emotions', 'guilt.The', 'way', 'personality', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotions', 'Forget', 'guilt', 'romance', 'David', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'not', 'developed', 'properly', 'Surprising', 'romance', 'not', 'focussed', 'movie', 'when', 'movie', 'Jack', 'who', 'time', 'young', 'girls', 'drama', 'involved.Inspite', 'poor', 'script', 'Jack', 'great', 'performance..as', 'good', 'would', 'think', 'Jack', 'ex-wife', 'role', 'ease', 'audience', 'can', 'get', 'taste', 'melodrama', 'troubled', 'souls', 'finding', 'peace', 'end', 'average', 'movie', 'simple', 'plot.This', 'movie', 'match', ""'The"", 'pledge', 'chilling', 'brilliant', 'thriller', 'theree', 'are', 'similarities']",Crossing Guard VHS
397250,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304039190,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Sean Penn.  He's highly regarded as one of his generations finest; some even say he IS the finest of his generation.  I don't agree (I haven't been truly moved by anything he's done outside of `Dead Man Walking') but I see why people love him.  Back in the 90's he tried his hand at directing and in 1995 he got his hands on a group of VERY talented actors and made a moderately crafted character piece called `The Crossing Guard'.  The film tells the story of a man racked with animosity and pain over the death of his daughter.  A drunk driver ran her down and is now about to be released from prison.  The father of the slain is determined to kill him.  On the flipside, the drunk driver, now reformed, is racked with so much guilt he almost welcomes death as a release from the knowing of his past actions.As some have already noted, Penn succeeds in directing great performances (most notably from the supporting actors) but he stumbles in actually building the film itself.  The brooding atmosphere feels pale as opposed to vibrant and rich; the pacing is a drag in moments and the elongated chase sequence is a complete misfire.  That said, Angelica Huston nails her diner scene, one of the biggest emotional punches of the film, both Robin Wright and Kari Wuhrer work wonders with limited means and David Morse should have been up for an Oscar.  Jack Nicholson struggles with the more earthy elements of his character's emotional state, but he sells the anger and grief rather well.  Still, as far as the construction is concerned, this film is stale.  It meanders and winds up losing steam by the film's end.  These performances deserved a better vehicle.",3,Half and half...,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1664,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'highly', 'regarded', 'one', 'generations', 'finest', 'even', 'say', 'finest', 'generation', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'truly', 'moved', 'anything', 'done', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'love', 'Back', '90', 'tried', 'hand', 'directing', '1995', 'got', 'hands', 'group', 'VERY', 'talented', 'actors', 'made', 'moderately', 'crafted', 'character', 'piece', 'called', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'film', 'story', 'man', 'racked', 'animosity', 'pain', 'death', 'daughter', 'drunk', 'driver', 'ran', 'down', 'now', 'be', 'released', 'prison', 'father', 'slain', 'determined', 'kill', 'flipside', 'drunk', 'driver', 'now', 'reformed', 'racked', 'so', 'much', 'guilt', 'almost', 'death', 'release', 'knowing', 'past', 'actions.As', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'Penn', 'directing', 'great', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'supporting', 'actors', 'actually', 'building', 'film', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'pale', 'opposed', 'vibrant', 'rich', 'pacing', 'drag', 'moments', 'elongated', 'chase', 'sequence', 'complete', 'misfire', 'said', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'diner', 'scene', 'one', 'biggest', 'emotional', 'punches', 'film', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'work', 'wonders', 'limited', 'means', 'David', 'Morse', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'earthy', 'elements', 'character', 'emotional', 'state', 'anger', 'grief', 'rather', 'well', 'Still', 'as', 'far', 'construction', 'concerned', 'film', 'stale', 'up', 'losing', 'steam', 'film', 'end', 'performances', 'deserved', 'better', 'vehicle']",Crossing Guard VHS

David Morse, as John Booth, has been serving time in jail for that very mistake and is also very remorseful about what he had done. Jack has been keeping tabs on when Booth is to be released and intends to kill him as soon as he can. At the Booth family home, Jack makes his move, only to discover he has forgotten to load his gun and decides to give John 3 days grace before he returns to finish the job. As for Booth, the man is torn between wanting to live and allowing the execution to take place, as it would certainly end his pain. In the three days he is given, he seeks to pick up his life to move on, and at one point almost forgets that he is slated to meet with Jack at some point. Jack in the meantime, is having his own troubles with his ex-wife and family because of his obsession with murdering Booth and spends his time with an endless parade of strippers and boozy drinkers as he tries to drown a sorrow that simply won't go away.It is on the third day that Booth realizes what is to happen, and spends his time bidding a silent goodbye to the world, as he prepares to meet with Jack and decides he really wants to live and the chase and clash ultimately ends at the little girl's grave site.

A good film brings us into the story emotioanlly, and leaves us to ponder the inponderables long after the final credits have scrolled by.  If the film-maker insists on dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's on a thinking, intelletucal level, we wind up never being able to suspend our disbelief and much of the power of the medium is lost.Sean Penn is a great actor.  But as a writer/director, he does not know how to extract his own personality from his work.  The description of a previous reviwer - &quot;self-indulgent&quot; is quite apt in this case.  The entire film, from the aviator glasses, the close-ups of the twirling cigarettes, the inexplicable bar-room brawls, to the wordy and wildly implausible dialogue, is smothered with Penn's heavy-handed imprints.It's a story of redemption through forgiveness - one man must learn to forgive himself while another must learn to forgive others - and it's a worthy morality tale.  But the emphasis is definitely on the morality at the expense of the tale, and as a result our main characters, all supposedly working class stiffs, are saddled with ponderous lines that constantly threaten to collapse under their own weight.  (A typical excerpt - Woman:  All this guilt of yours is too much competition for me.  Let me know when you want life.  A few scenes later the man staggers into the woman's house, collapses on the floor, and asks:  &quot;What is guilt?  Define guilt.&quot;  It has to be seen to be believed.)  And if that's not enough, the director made sure voice-over commentaries are ever available in the form of song lyrics (sometimes actually sung by characters in the film), even to the point of having a couple of random passengers on a bus, completely unrelated to the story line, carry on a conversation about contentment with material standards of life in the movie's climatic chase scene.Note to Sean:  You still have a long career ahead of you.

He really makes you feel a piece of the powerful grief he lives with, and somehow makes you laugh.Angelica Houston is just about the only actress I have seen steal a scene from someone like Nicholson with such subtlety.  One of my favorite scenes is Nicholson and Houston in the dinner.  At the conclusion, you can almost feel the door slam on their relationship.And Robin Wright Penn gives the best performance of her career.  Obviously the man and wife relationship helped Penn know how to best play her strengths.  The scene when Morse confesses his worst secrets to Wright is amazing.  She has few lines, but really shows volumes in her reaction.I recently watched The Woodsman and felt that Sedgwick also did an amazing job in the same type of scene, but yet went in a completely different direction.This film is often compared to The Pledge, and rightfully so.  In my opinion though, The Crossing Guard is by far a better film.  The fact that Penn had to wait until Mystic River to get his Oscar credit is a shame.

What happens when you have killed a child in a car accident when you were driving under the influence ? For one, the drunken driver goes to prison for a while which always seems to be too short for the victim's father. For two, the drunken driver develops a sense of guilt that makes him desire to die, to be killed, to disappear. For three, the drunken driver cannot develop a normal life because of this guilt that keeps him away from his forgiving parents, that prevents him from building a normal relation with anyone, particularly a love relation. For four, the father of the victim develops a desire to really take justice in his own hands, unable that he is to forgive, to accept the death of his child as an event that cannot be repaired by any action on his part. Gone is gone and bygones must be accepted as such. But even if you let the sleeping dog sleep, there is a this dog gnawing at your innards and your soul, perverting it, rotting it, destroying it, and all reason along with it. Then you embark into a chase after the killer and try to destroy him in his turn. You become kind of schizophrenic and real life disappears for this virtual mission that you think, feel and know you have been entrusted with by fate and suffering, some even say God. Vengeance is the word for it : an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. And there is a perfect meeting of the sense of guilt in the killer and the desire to kill in the father. And yet, the film comes to a positive end, comes to forgiveness and repentance. This ending is very unrealistic. Vengeance does not know any stop, any limit, any mastering force because it comes from the deepest layers of one's instincts, impulses and drives, totally unconscious in its real motivations. Guilt cannot alleviate the suffering of the other nor the suffering of the drunken driver because it comes from the deepest ethical layers of the unconscious. On one side the desire to kill because the other has killed : a false balancing justice that is fundamentally barbaric. On the other side the desire to die because he has killed and cannot accept the fact and change his neurotic if not psychotic vision of the world and himself. Sean Penn just dreams of a way out that does exist in society, among men, for most of them, but is unrealistic when the two protagonists have reached their levels of derangement, because vengeance and unabating guilt are derangements of reason and the mind. Make it a mass reaction and you have a simple cause for war. The stronger will go at war against the weaker but the weaker will become the stronger because of his massive nature and of his sense of being invaded by some undeserved injustice. Never play with vengeance : it is no toy, it brings no joy, it only brings unwarranted death and unrighteous action that prompts the desire and the will to resist, to righteously defend oneself.

Since then, the devastated Freddy has remained alive only by nursing the hope that he will be able to kill John Booth (David Morse), the man who accidentally killed his daughter.

397267,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6304039190,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","The Crossing Guard marked Sean Penn's second outing as a writer and director. Even today, The Crossing Guard receives a cool reception from those who stumble upon it. While almost all agree that the film is not a masterpiece, some go so far as to say it's not even a good film. It's not perfect, it's not a masterpiece, but I can't tell you that The Crossing Guard is not a good film that proves Sean Penn is a true film director.Jack Nicholson plays Freddy, an alcoholic jeweler whose daughter was killed some years ago by a drunk driver named John Booth (David Morse). Booth has recently been released from prison, moving into a trailer in his parent's driveway and Freddy plans to kill him. Since the death of his daughter, Freddy has nothing. His ex-wife Mary (Anjelica Huston) has re-married and his two sons call him by his first name; his nights are spent drinking and socializing in a strip club. He's hit rock bottom and has nothing worth holding on to. When Freddy finally attempts to kill Booth, he has gun troubles and tells Booth he has 3 days. Booth is still suffering from the guilt that he no longer fears his own mortality.This synopsis makes the film sound like a cheap, conventional, and contrived thriller. There are parts of Penn's story that are contrived, without a doubt...But this a strong, character-driven piece that allowed me to slightly overlook blemishes in the story.The film is driven by Nicholson and Morse, two vastly contrasted performances, with Morse giving a subdued performance as Nicholson immerses himself into the character, once again crating a memorable character while essentially playing a variation on himself. The fact that Sean Penn is an actor greatly helps him get great performances out of his actors. 20 minutes in there is a scene between Nicholson and Huston (who had gone through a tumultuous breakup only a few years earlier) which seethes intensity. Quite late into the movie, they have yet another scene together and it's easy to see both of them drawing from their personal history to get through the scenes correctly. While both Freddy and Booth are appropriately fleshed out, I felt that Penn didn't fully flesh out Huston's character and Jojo (Robin Wright), Booth's love interest. They felt more like devices of the plot rather than actual characters.I do find it funny to note (due to Penn's famously hot temper) that, despite playing Booth's love interest, there is not a single scene of Wright and Morse kissing.Penn proves himself with this film that he's a strong director and a strong writer, but he still hadn't fully matured as one. His script is ""good,"" but would not have worked as a film without the cast he chose to populate the movie. The saddest thing about The Crossing Guard is that it's not a great film, although it certainly had the potential to be just that. The contrived story, specifically the happy ending, is what killed it for me. In the end, I felt the film would've worked better as a grim story about revenge than a dark tale about redemption. There are great scenes in the film, but others that are just too forced and predictable to ignore...The paradox of Freddy in particular. I saw that coming from the very beginning of the film. The Crossing Guard has great performances, great direction, and is entertaining enough but it could've been so much more.GRADE: B",4,Powerful Performances,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,3359,"['Crossing', 'Guard', 'marked', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'second', 'outing', 'writer', 'director', 'Even', 'today', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'cool', 'reception', 'who', 'stumble', 'almost', 'agree', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'true', 'film', 'director.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Freddy', 'alcoholic', 'jeweler', 'daughter', 'was', 'killed', 'years', 'ago', 'drunk', 'driver', 'named', 'John', 'Booth', 'David', 'Morse', 'Booth', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'moving', 'trailer', 'parent', 'driveway', 'Freddy', 'kill', 'death', 'daughter', 'Freddy', 'nothing', 'ex-wife', 'Mary', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 're-married', 'two', 'sons', 'call', 'first', 'name', 'nights', 'are', 'spent', 'drinking', 'socializing', 'strip', 'club', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'nothing', 'worth', 'holding', 'When', 'Freddy', 'finally', 'kill', 'Booth', 'gun', 'troubles', 'tells', 'Booth', '3', 'days', 'Booth', 'still', 'suffering', 'guilt', 'no', 'longer', 'own', 'mortality.This', 'synopsis', 'film', 'sound', 'cheap', 'conventional', 'contrived', 'thriller', 'are', 'parts', 'Penn', 'story', 'are', 'contrived', 'doubt', 'strong', 'character-driven', 'piece', 'allowed', 'slightly', 'overlook', 'blemishes', 'story.The', 'film', 'driven', 'Nicholson', 'Morse', 'two', 'vastly', 'contrasted', 'performances', 'Morse', 'giving', 'subdued', 'performance', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'crating', 'memorable', 'character', 'essentially', 'playing', 'variation', 'fact', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'actor', 'greatly', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', '20', 'minutes', 'scene', 'Nicholson', 'Huston', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'tumultuous', 'breakup', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'intensity', 'Quite', 'late', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'scene', 'together', 'easy', 'see', 'drawing', 'personal', 'history', 'get', 'scenes', 'correctly', 'Freddy', 'Booth', 'are', 'appropriately', 'fleshed', 'out', 'felt', 'Penn', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'Huston', 'character', 'Jojo', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Booth', 'love', 'interest', 'felt', 'more', 'devices', 'plot', 'rather', 'actual', 'characters.I', 'do', 'find', 'funny', 'note', 'due', 'Penn', 'famously', 'hot', 'temper', 'playing', 'Booth', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'Wright', 'Morse', 'kissing.Penn', 'film', 'strong', 'director', 'strong', 'writer', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'fully', 'matured', 'one', 'script', 'good', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'film', 'cast', 'chose', 'populate', 'movie', 'saddest', 'thing', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'just', 'contrived', 'story', 'specifically', 'happy', 'ending', 'what', 'killed', 'end', 'felt', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'better', 'grim', 'story', 'revenge', 'dark', 'tale', 'redemption', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'forced', 'predictable', 'ignore', 'paradox', 'Freddy', 'particular', 'saw', 'coming', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'great', 'performances', 'great', 'direction', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.GRADE', 'B']",Crossing Guard VHS
397268,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6304039190,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","Sean Penn, recently winning his first Oscar for MYSTIC RIVER, directed this film, and as an actor he is vastly aware of the importance of good performances.  While the movie itself is a flawed film, one can hardly fault the performances.  The movie is about going on with one's life, even when that seems the furthest thing in mind.  Jack Nicholson in a very strong performance plays Freddy, a man who lost his seven year old daughter to a drunk driver.  After this loss, his marriage to Mary (Anjelica Huston) has fallen apart, and she has remarried a stable and nice enough man (played with restraint by Robbie Robertson).  Freddy has been living for one thing:  revenge.  Now that the driver, John Booth (David Morse) has been released from prison, Freddy wants to kill him.  Booth, however, is a changed, desolate man as well, bearing the guilt of ruining not only Nicholson's life, but hurting his loving parents (Piper Laurie and Richard Bradford) as well.  How these two face their demons is the crux of the plot.  What makes it so good are the performances.  Huston is magnificent; a scene between her and Nicholson in a restaurant late at night is devastating in how it switches from what starts out as sentimental and caring, but then turns despicably ugly.  Although not on screen much, Ms. Huston asserts her power as an actress.  Robin Wright Penn as the girlfriend of Booth has some powerful moments, although her ""dancing"" sequence is both absurd and unmeaningful.  David Morse is brilliant as John Booth, an obviously gentle man who made that horrible mistake of drinking too much and driving.  His guilt weighs heavy on his shoulders, and in the convoluted ending, he and Nicholson still make it potent.Not a happy film by any means, but a good exercise in cinematic performance.",4,ACTOR'S MOVIE,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,1796,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'recently', 'winning', 'first', 'Oscar', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'directed', 'film', 'actor', 'vastly', 'aware', 'importance', 'good', 'performances', 'movie', 'flawed', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'fault', 'performances', 'movie', 'going', 'one', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'furthest', 'thing', 'mind', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'plays', 'Freddy', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'drunk', 'driver', 'loss', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'fallen', 'apart', 'remarried', 'stable', 'nice', 'enough', 'man', 'played', 'restraint', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'Freddy', 'been', 'living', 'one', 'thing', 'revenge', 'Now', 'driver', 'John', 'Booth', 'David', 'Morse', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'Freddy', 'kill', 'Booth', 'however', 'changed', 'desolate', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'bearing', 'guilt', 'ruining', 'not', 'only', 'Nicholson', 'life', 'hurting', 'loving', 'parents', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Richard', 'Bradford', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'two', 'face', 'demons', 'crux', 'plot', 'What', 'so', 'good', 'are', 'performances', 'Huston', 'magnificent', 'scene', 'Nicholson', 'restaurant', 'late', 'night', 'devastating', 'how', 'what', 'out', 'sentimental', 'caring', 'then', 'despicably', 'ugly', 'not', 'screen', 'much', 'Ms.', 'Huston', 'power', 'actress', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'girlfriend', 'Booth', 'powerful', 'moments', 'dancing', 'sequence', 'absurd', 'unmeaningful', 'David', 'Morse', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Booth', 'obviously', 'gentle', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'driving', 'guilt', 'heavy', 'shoulders', 'convoluted', 'ending', 'Nicholson', 'still', 'make', 'potent.Not', 'happy', 'film', 'means', 'good', 'exercise', 'cinematic', 'performance']",Crossing Guard VHS

397270,A157XTSMJH9XA4,6304039190,One of many,"[2, 3]","Sean Penn (writing/directing duties and a bit more, but not acting) and Jack Nicholson team up for ""The Crossing Guard"" -- a surprisingly touching film that will stick with any viewer for quite some time. Here's the plot:(The following contains some spoilers to the storyline, as it is a summarization of most of the film)The Crossing Guard persists in it's somber mood almost entirely throughout. The story is a seemingly hopeless one. Freddy (Nicholson) plays a father who lost his daughter several years back, and as a result also lost his marriage. He's never even visited his daughter's grave. In short, his life is a wreck. Regardless, he refuses to let the past get a hold of him. He continues the lies and bitterness through the years, trying to push away the pain and live a normal life. Yet when he gets news of an inmate being released, things only get worse. You see, the inmate is John Booth -- the man who accidently killed Freddy's little girl by means of drunk driving. Freddy decides with practically no debate (hell, he's had years of anger to support the decision) that he is going to kill Booth. He tracks down the man (who isn't too far anyway) and after an awkward misfortune (I'll leave that near-humorous surprise for your own discovery) that prevents him from murdering Booth right away, he gives Booth three days to live. Then, after the three days are up, he's coming for him. John Booth is a bit confusing because he insists he won't call the police, and doesn't seem a bit shaken by the idea of this man killing him. He seems more sad and empty than anything. He, too, has lived a life of inner torment as a result of the accident -- although Freddy refuses to have any consideration to such things, only focusing on his blind anger. Now begins the majority of the movie: the three days in which one man awaits his death and another awaits a cold taste of revenge. This is what is so interesting about the film. We get to see the view from both ends. We follow both charaters in their mixed up and broken lives through what must be their last days. The viewer becomes almost as sad and confused as the characters. John Booth has always been (and still remains) torn apart by the accident with the little girl. He feels almost like he deserves it. He constantly struggles to find way to not only cope, but understand it all. Freddy remains ruthless and bitter about everything, only looking forward to what he feels he must do. Both men are faced with the assumptions of everyone else in their life that all is well. They know their upcoming destiny, but no one else does. These people oblivious to the madness unfolding right before them certainly seem small an unappreciative compared to the situation Freddy and John are faced with. Here, I feel Penn tried to stress how some of the ""important"" things in life are really quite insignificant. The world for both men is falling apart. As the day comes to do the deed, Freddy finds himself as an emotional wreck. He reunites with his ex-wife in a restaurant in need of a discusion after his conscience gets to him. She begins to see how the man who she thought had disapeared after the death of their daughter is still deep inside Freddy somewhere. But as fragile as the situation is, he snaps and storms out. Tonight is the night he must kill John Booth. But, on the way over, he is stopped for drunk driving. The officers want to take him in. Of course, this would be major damage to his plan, so he grabs his pistol and runs. After shaking the cops off his tail, he finally arrives at his destination: Booth's home. He is prepared to kill. But through yet another string of peculiar events, he -- with the assistance of the man he vowed to hate forever -- finds the higher reason for it all behind the tragedy. I'm not going to give this ending away, but I can assure you it is quite heart-warming and worth the wait.The Crossing Guard is a web of pain and nihilism that life can sometimes pin on someone. And by the end, it all makes sense. Anger, apathy, love, hurt, recovery, heart-break and doing what is right are just a few examples of what this film has managed to squeeze into two hours. A truly remarkable piece. A must see for any fan of drama movies.",5,"Wow!

He isn't dealing, he is drinking and planning revenge for when the man, played by David Morse, gets out of prison.  Freddy's ex-wife, played by Anjelica Houston, has remarried and is focused on her two sons. They are Freddy's sons but he has not seen them since the divorce. This is a film built on revenge, but it us really about hidden feelings  and jowl you cope or not with traumas in your life. Freddy's ex-wife has carried on, Freddy has not, cannot as long as the devil alcohol in his system.

397274,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6304039190,Richard Ross,"[0, 2]","Nicholson and Huston were a big Hollywood couple for well over a decade in the late seventies/ early eighties into the nineties. The relationship ended when Jack fathered a child with someone else. This knowledge enhances their performances in an otherwise average film. When these two confront each other it feels raw. It feels more like they are frustrated with each other as people rather than as actors playing a part. I didn't think anything in this film, directed by Sean Penn, was as impressive as their  brilliant performances. Freddy Gale (Nicholson) is a bitter drunk who never recovered from the death of his daughter at the hands of a drunk driver named Booth (a buff David Morse). Freddy's emotional spiral proved too much for his wife (Huston) who divorced him and moved on with her life. Freddy practically lives in a run down strip club where he spends his nights and dates the dancers. The only pleasure he gets out of  life is torturing his ex wife by bringing up their dead daughter. When he learns of Booth's release from prison, Freddy plots the murder of the man who ruined his life. Freddy lets everyone know of his intentions, including Booth. He pays him a drunken visit and gives him three nights to set things right before he comes back to murder him. The remarkable thing is that Booth is accepting of this. His life was forever ruined by this tragedy too.  In his last days Booth romances an artist named JoJo (Robin Wright Penn) and tries to tell her and his parents about the daily guilt he has been living with. Wright Penn is beautiful but after watching her embarrass herself by dancing to Salt N' Pepa you question if she was only cast because her husband wanted her in his movie. My biggest problem with this film  is Freddy's hypocrisy. His daughter was killed by a drunk driver yet he is constantly driving home drunk from the strip club. In the film's last act, when he tries to execute his revenge, he is drunk driving and endangers the life of a small child his daughter's age. It's a decent, heavy film that deals with sensitive issues and has brilliant acting from a good cast.

And when I heard about their earlier effort &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot;. I got really excited and wanted to see it. But after a couple of views of this film I was terribly disappointed. &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; is basically a revenge movie. Nicholson plays a jeweler obsessed with the death of his daughter 6 years ago and intent on gaining revenge on the drunk driver who killed her. However, the first scene between them is ridiculous! Nicholson comes into the drunk's trailer and the guy doesn't even act scared! He acts like he knows he's coming and he's not even surprised! Another part of the movie that just doesn't make sense is that if Jack's character is so obsessed with his daugther's death why does he spend all his time in strip clubs and making love to beautiful young girls? Penn never makes us care about any of his characters. Jack's character comes off as a selfish drunk playboy who just wants to get revenge for the hell of it. As the viewer I never felt compassion or understanding for his plight. He just seems like a guy who's out to get revenge to satisfy his own ego and not for his daughter.
