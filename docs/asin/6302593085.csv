The plot is predictable but a young Thora Birch is an excellent asset. The comedy is fresh and the belly laughs are numerous. Lauren Bacall gives an excellent performance as Grandma.

321621,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,6302593085,Brett Johnson,"[7, 25]","&quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot; was uniformly trashed by critics when it came out. It was easily one of the worst reviewed films of 1991. Why oh why didn't I listen to them?The plot is so generic that you know how it's going to end within the first ten minutes. Two parents are no longer together. The mother has found a new boyfriend. The kids do what they can to ditch the new boyfriend and get the parents back together. With that stale of a plot, the only way it could've worked out would have been if the acting was filled with passion and the direction evoked as much Christmas magic as possible. That didn't happen.There is not a single heartfelt moment to be found in this film. Not one. I don't even know where to begin. Thora Birch has turned out to be an impressive actress. However, she is only grating and precocious to the extreme in &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot;. Her brother, played by Ethan Embry, had no character definition whatsoever. His substory involving a teenage romance was underdeveloped and seemed better suited for another film.The adult characters are just as bad. The filmmakers could've saved money by utilizing cardboard cutouts instead of actual actors. The Mom, Dad, and Mom's new &quot;jerk&quot; boyfriend are shallower than a kiddie pool.I was even put off by the shameless plugging of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. It's a sad fact that product placement has been commonplace for a long time now but...come on! Don't they understand that if the product is shoved in your face that it only serves as an unpleasant distraction? At least their Coca-Cola placement was slightly less obvious.Even Santa would only give this movie to the naughty kids.",1,As fun as being trampled by Santa's reindeer.,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,1694,"['quot', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'was', 'uniformly', 'trashed', 'critics', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'reviewed', 'films', '1991', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'plot', 'so', 'generic', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Two', 'parents', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'together', 'mother', 'found', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'kids', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'ditch', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'parents', 'back', 'together', 'stale', 'plot', 'only', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'acting', 'was', 'filled', 'passion', 'direction', 'evoked', 'much', 'Christmas', 'magic', 'possible', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.There', 'not', 'single', 'heartfelt', 'moment', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'Not', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'impressive', 'actress', 'However', 'only', 'grating', 'precocious', 'extreme', 'quot', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'brother', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'had', 'character', 'definition', 'whatsoever', 'substory', 'involving', 'teenage', 'romance', 'was', 'underdeveloped', 'seemed', 'better', 'suited', 'film.The', 'adult', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'money', 'utilizing', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'instead', 'actual', 'actors', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'Mom', 'new', 'quot', 'jerk', 'quot', 'are', 'shallower', 'kiddie', 'pool.I', 'was', 'even', 'put', 'off', 'shameless', 'plugging', 'Ben', 'amp', 'Jerry', 'ice', 'cream', 'sad', 'fact', 'product', 'placement', 'been', 'commonplace', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'come', 'Do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'product', 'shoved', 'face', 'only', 'unpleasant', 'distraction', 'least', 'Coca-Cola', 'placement', 'was', 'slightly', 'less', 'obvious.Even', 'Santa', 'would', 'only', 'give', 'movie', 'naughty', 'kids']",N/A

First of all, it's set in New York City at Christmastime, so how can it go wrong? Then it's about a family with problems...and yields a happy ending. The characters are great. The story is a good one. And at the very core, it may even make a few parents think twice about what they are about to do. This is a definite must see for everyone - and, for us, it has become part of our family Christmas traditions.",5,Excellent Christmas Movie!!,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,473,"['ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'saying', 'movie', 'anything', 'great', 'First', 'all', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Christmastime', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Then', 'family', 'problems', 'yields', 'happy', 'ending', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'very', 'core', 'may', 'even', 'make', 'few', 'parents', 'think', 'twice', 'what', 'are', 'do', 'definite', 'must', 'see', 'everyone', 'become', 'part', 'family', 'Christmas', 'traditions']",N/A

But neither is it the worst Christmas movie ever made as some have proclaimed.  Anyone who thinks so obviously has never seen ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""The basic plot is about two kids, Ethan & Hallie played by Ethan Embry (Dutch) and Thora Birch respectively.  All they want for Christmas is to spend the holiday with their divorced parents (Harley Jane Kozak & Jamey Sheridan) and hopefully get them back together.  But their mom is all set to marry snotty yuppie Tony played by SNL alum Kevin Nealon.So they not only have to find a way to break up the new relationship, but also find a way to get their parents to rekindle their old flame.  Along the way they enlist the aid of Santa claus played by Leslie Nielsen.  The movie also features Lauren Bacall as the kid's grandmother.It's pretty standard formula stuff. but the kids are cute and mean well and there's some genuine sincerity in the movie, if not a bit of holiday magic.  You could do much worse than this if you're looking for a holiday film to watch with the kids.",3,NOT GREAT BUT BETTER THAN SOME THINK,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,1146,"['classic', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'worst', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'Anyone', 'who', 'so', 'obviously', 'never', 'seen', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Conquers', 'Martians', 'basic', 'plot', 'two', 'kids', 'Ethan', 'Hallie', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Dutch', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'respectively', 'want', 'Christmas', 'spend', 'holiday', 'divorced', 'parents', 'Harley', 'Jane', 'Kozak', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'hopefully', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'mom', 'set', 'marry', 'snotty', 'yuppie', 'Tony', 'played', 'SNL', 'alum', 'Kevin', 'Nealon.So', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'break', 'up', 'new', 'relationship', 'also', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'parents', 'rekindle', 'old', 'flame', 'way', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Santa', 'claus', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'movie', 'also', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'kid', 'grandmother.It', 'pretty', 'standard', 'formula', 'stuff', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'mean', 'well', 'genuine', 'sincerity', 'movie', 'not', 'bit', 'holiday', 'magic', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', ""'re"", 'looking', 'holiday', 'film', 'watch', 'kids']",N/A
