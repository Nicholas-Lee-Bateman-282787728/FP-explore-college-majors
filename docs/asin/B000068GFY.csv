Don't hesitate on this one - the ""Snakes, you'd better not touch"" song is worth the price of the DVD by itself.  Golly, is that funny!  Greg even gives us a couple of Elvis moves!  Pretty good and very entertaining to toddlers.

It really has a winning combination of great songs, close up shots of animals, and, of course, Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter!This is also the one Wiggles DVD that I will choose if my son is hankering for a Wiggles fix.  It's the only one that doesn't drive me crazy when we watch it over and over and over.Aside from entertaining songs, the video has an educational aspect as well, since the expertise of Steve and Terri Irwin is at hand to show us different animals and tell us what they're like.  Although I know my son doesn't understand that part right now, he has learned the names of some animals which appear in the video.This video also contains some nice extras: an interview with Steve, and some good outtakes at the end.Warning, though:  the songs will get lodged in your brain!",5,A captivating video!,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,884,"['five', 'Wiggles', 'videos', 'have', 'far', '2-year', 'old', 'son', 'favorite', 'really', 'winning', 'combination', 'great', 'songs', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'animals', 'course', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'also', 'one', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'will', 'choose', 'son', 'hankering', 'Wiggles', 'fix', 'only', 'one', ""n't"", 'drive', 'crazy', 'when', 'watch', 'over.Aside', 'entertaining', 'songs', 'video', 'educational', 'aspect', 'well', 'expertise', 'Steve', 'Terri', 'Irwin', 'hand', 'show', 'different', 'animals', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'know', 'son', ""n't"", 'understand', 'part', 'right', 'now', 'learned', 'names', 'animals', 'appear', 'video.This', 'video', 'also', 'nice', 'extras', 'interview', 'Steve', 'good', 'outtakes', 'end.Warning', 'songs', 'will', 'get', 'lodged', 'brain']",N/A

However, she loves it!  It holds her attention even better than the TV show, and she sits as if in a trance when it's on.  This DVD is set outdoors, at the Australian Zoo, and features the Wiggles and the Steve Irwin family interacting with various animals.  The songs are probably the best of any of their videos-I find myself humming them alot!  Also featured are the four dancers (two men and two women) that appear in most of the Wiggles Dvds-they're such a pleasure to watch, and genuinely seem to be having fun.Overall, I highly recommend this DVD!

They are a perfect distraction for my daughter when I have work that has to be done.  What makes this video so good is that it introduces American children to some of Australia's unique wildlife.  The Wiggles sing simple songs about koalas, dophins, cuckaburros(forgive the spelling), and even a song about snakes that warns ""look, but you better not touch.""  (Crocodile Hunter)Steve Irwin's energy is a perfect addition to the fray.  He explains simple things about the animals without going into too much detail for young minds.  Of course, it's the songs that really hold my daughter's attention.  Although she can't speak very well right now, she does manage to get a lot of the words to the songs right.  Most of the songs are very good, although a couple of them seem to drag a little bit compared to others.
