632481,A73C1BKSAZPA,B00005JNNT,Adam Richter,"[3, 3]","Imagine, if you will, that you are the head honcho at a major Hollywood movie studio and you're presented with two pitches for potential films. Pitch #1: ""Michael Keaton plays a guy whose wife dies unexpectedly, and he realizes that he can receive messages from her from the 'Other Side' via EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena... specifically, voices and images of the dead recorded from static, AKA white noise). However, this attracts other, dangerous spirits who'd like to cross over into our world.""Sounds kind of cool and scary, right? Then you hear Pitch #2: ""Michael Keaton plays a guy who realizes that he's receiving messages in white noise from people who live in his area who are about to die in some awful way. However, these messages are somehow coming to him from the near future, and he has the power to rush out and try to prevent tragedies... if he can decipher the clues in time."" Wow, that sounds exciting too!Yup, both of these concepts could have potentially become awesome thrillers. The problem is, the actual Michael Keaton movie ""White Noise"" is an ill-advised mashup of these two different plots, and the result, as you might expect, is mostly confusion.This is a shame, because much of ""White Noise"" is suspenseful and rather creepy. Although things get off to a slow start, Keaton does a nice job playing a sympathetic character, and the film manages to draw the viewer's interest, up to a point. However, once the two concepts collide, bewilderment reigns supreme. The movie's internal logic starts changing often and unexpectedly, and the (SPOILER ALERT!) late introduction of a character who seemingly wandered into the movie off the set of a ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"" flick filming on a nearby soundstage only makes things worse. Keaton gamely tries to act like he's taking things seriously, but the movie increasingly goes off in so many different directions at once, it just becomes absurd.As it stands, however, ""White Noise"" is still watchable for Keaton's performance, for the creepy stretches and scary moments, and for the intriguing possibilities of EVP in general. And the disc's extras are worth watching too... you get deleted scenes (including alternate versions with more graphic images), commentary, and some short documentaries featuring real-life EVP experts (they play several of the ghostly voices that they've allegedly recorded and demonstrate the basics of recording them). It's just too bad that the movie, ultimately, didn't realize that sometimes ""less is more."" If ""White Noise"" had narrowed its focus, it probably would have been a far more satisfying film.",3,When Films Collide...,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2604,"['Imagine', 'will', 'are', 'head', 'honcho', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'studio', ""'re"", 'presented', 'two', 'pitches', 'potential', 'films', 'Pitch', '1', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'guy', 'wife', 'unexpectedly', 'can', 'receive', 'messages', ""'Other"", 'Side', 'EVP', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomena', 'specifically', 'voices', 'images', 'dead', 'recorded', 'static', 'AKA', 'white', 'noise', 'However', 'other', 'dangerous', 'spirits', 'who', ""'d"", 'cross', 'over', 'world', 'Sounds', 'kind', 'cool', 'scary', 'right', 'Then', 'hear', 'Pitch', '2', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'guy', 'who', 'receiving', 'messages', 'white', 'noise', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'area', 'who', 'are', 'die', 'awful', 'way', 'However', 'messages', 'are', 'somehow', 'coming', 'near', 'future', 'power', 'rush', 'out', 'try', 'prevent', 'tragedies', 'can', 'decipher', 'clues', 'time', 'Wow', 'exciting', 'too', 'Yup', 'concepts', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'become', 'awesome', 'thrillers', 'problem', 'actual', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'movie', 'White', 'Noise', 'ill-advised', 'mashup', 'two', 'different', 'plots', 'result', 'might', 'expect', 'mostly', 'confusion.This', 'shame', 'much', 'White', 'Noise', 'suspenseful', 'rather', 'creepy', 'things', 'get', 'slow', 'start', 'Keaton', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'draw', 'viewer', 'interest', 'up', 'point', 'However', 'once', 'two', 'concepts', 'collide', 'bewilderment', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'movie', 'internal', 'logic', 'changing', 'often', 'unexpectedly', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'late', 'introduction', 'character', 'who', 'seemingly', 'wandered', 'movie', 'set', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'flick', 'filming', 'nearby', 'soundstage', 'only', 'things', 'worse', 'Keaton', 'gamely', 'act', 'taking', 'things', 'seriously', 'movie', 'increasingly', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'once', 'just', 'absurd.As', 'however', 'White', 'Noise', 'still', 'watchable', 'Keaton', 'performance', 'creepy', 'stretches', 'scary', 'moments', 'intriguing', 'possibilities', 'EVP', 'general', 'disc', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'too', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'versions', 'more', 'graphic', 'images', 'commentary', 'short', 'documentaries', 'featuring', 'real-life', 'EVP', 'experts', 'play', 'several', 'ghostly', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'allegedly', 'recorded', 'demonstrate', 'basics', 'recording', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'sometimes', 'less', 'more', 'White', 'Noise', 'had', 'narrowed', 'focus', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film']",White Noise
632482,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JNNT,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","This film was a massive disappointment.  From both an entertaining aspect and the storytelling aspect, it just never really got off the ground.  There were too many elements that went untouched that should have either been explained or explored.  Instead, we are forced through a film without any directions and a horrible guide.  I personally got lost twice trying to find my way out of there.  There was some potential in White Noise, but sadly it never was shown the light of day.  The concept behind the film is absurd.  The ability to hear the dead through your computer or VCR seemed a bit archaic to me.  This was a very modern film, yet we are forced to possibly see the spirits through BETA ... I kept waiting for that important scene to switch this entire film around.  Alas, it never evolved.  So, instead, I am forced to watch Michael Keaton fumble his way through an already pathetic film and experience some of the least frightening (mostly due to do underdevelopment) ghosts that the horror genre had to offer.  I would rank these below Casper ... and he was a friendly ghost.The issue arrives very early into the film.  We are shown brief images of these three shadows that constantly had me thinking of the ""Smoking Man"" in X-Files.  Who were these spirits?  Why were they just watching?  What were they doing on television?  Simple questions that you would think would be answered immediately throughout the film (because they are a big element to the ending), but no, nothing is explained.  These three shadows are used as a technique early in the film to make audiences jump in their seats while never quite explaining who or what they are.  Then, as if we are to already know what they are, they are used near the end for a very important scene.  This left me boggled.  In fact, the entire ending left me boggled.  I am not going into detail here because others would be upset, but the entire ending seemed that director Geoffrey Sax wanted to incorporate several different techniques from several different styles of film into one unclimactic ending.  It was poorly executed and very badly conceived.  It will not end with a great taste in your mouth.So, with the choppy spiritual aspect and the abruptly bad ending, I bet you are thinking that at least Keaton could carry this film.  Wrong.  This seemed like it was the most difficult film for Keaton to handle.  I am not sure if it was the emotional moments that didn't settle well with him or if it was the fact that he had to use expression on his face instead of reading his lines that ruined his performance here, but either way he was disastrous.  From the opening scene of this film, you never really saw Keaton as anyone other than Michael Keaton.  The moments between he and his wife seemed forced and rather Hollywood created, which overall impacted the rest of the film for me.  Why would this man want to hear his wife if he wasn't really in love with her?  Bring that element into the picture and I think Sax would have had a stronger picture.  Secondly, does anyone else get tired of witnessing grown men never go to work yet have the most lavish lifestyle?  As a retail working man, I thought this completely ruined any reality that this film was trying to build.  A man who wishes to live a trendy lifestyle needs to work, and Keaton (after about the first ten minutes of this film) never went back to work.  To me, that was depressing and unbelievable.Keaton did not cut it at all in this film, but then again, neither did his co-stars.  The choice to use Deborah Kara Unger was smart, but we needed to give more to her.  She is a spooky woman that almost carried The Game away from Michael Douglas, but somehow was completely forgotten about throughout this film.  I understand that Keaton was supposed to be the central focus, but she was a huge element in helping him understand EVP, so why not give her more screen time.  Then there was Ian McNeice, who quite possibly wasted his talent on this film.  He is a decent actor that showed us that bad screenwriting can still sound bad from the mouth of even decent actors.  Nobody in this film seemed to have the energy or excitement that was needed to make this film worth watching again, and again, and again.Finally, the story was as shallow as the local kiddy pool.  Director Sax had us jumping from one moment to the next, confusing even the most novice of film watchers and horror enthusiasts.  You could tell that he had so much information, so many ideas, that he wanted to get out on the screen that he dropped some crucial elements and completely forgot about some other ones.  Finally, when we do get to the ending, we are so turned around and unexcited that laughter seems the only response one could give.  For this story to work stronger there was a need for better actors, a tighter script, and more development of those three shadows that still have me scratching my head.  Just like in the X-Files none of my questions were answered.Grade: * out of *****",1,The spirits don't want you here...,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,5011,"['film', 'was', 'massive', 'disappointment',

632485,A3LUUF8CAWLPHX,B00005JNNT,"Amazon Customer ""bluejaye""","[7, 7]","White Noise tells the story of widower Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) who is contacted by his late wife using EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). The opening scene is a by the book `meet the happy family' moment that turns sour when Jonathan's wife goes missing. Barring one rather confusing and unexplained plot twist, this formula thriller is as predictable as they come. Like in other slow ghostly suspense films, most recently The Others, Sax tries to characterize his settings as co-conspirators. What he ends up with is about forty minutes of location footage that should have stayed in the scouting binder. Interestingly, Jonathan Rivers is an architect, and there are numerous aerial establishing shots that mirror those small cardboard plans that architects hover over, and the attention Sax lavishes onto Rivers' waterfront home and apartment home borders on the obsessive. Clearly, there was some intent in all this, perhaps to establish `everything' as haunted and ominous, but it fails. Michael Keaton stumbles through the film like a zombie, hitting his lines near the mark if not directly on. His performance is only dull because the character is dull. He falls into the same horror movie traps as they all do, backing into rooms for no reason, persisting ahead despite strange noises and terrible tidings. As a result, White Noise does offer up a few scares. I'll leave the details of the one plot twist out so as not to spoil it for anyone dead set on seeing this film, but like I mentioned before, it doesn't make sense once you think it out. If checking your brain at the door and slow paced suspense films are your cup of tea, then there are worse ways to spend two hours than White Noise, but not many. Sadly, on DVD all the fun cheap scares will be subdued, so if you must see this, try to see it on the big screen.",2,"More noise, less cliche",1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,1838,"['White', 'Noise', 'story', 'widower', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'who', 'contacted', 'late', 'wife', 'using', 'EVP', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'opening', 'scene', 'book', 'meet', 'happy', 'family', 'moment', 'sour', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'wife', 'missing', 'Barring', 'one', 'rather', 'confusing', 'unexplained', 'plot', 'twist', 'formula', 'thriller', 'as', 'predictable', 'come', 'other', 'slow', 'ghostly', 'suspense', 'films', 'most', 'recently', 'Others', 'Sax', 'characterize', 'settings', 'co-conspirators', 'What', 'up', 'forty', 'minutes', 'location', 'footage', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'scouting', 'binder', 'Interestingly', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'architect', 'are', 'numerous', 'aerial', 'establishing', 'shots', 'mirror', 'small', 'cardboard', 'plans', 'hover', 'attention', 'Sax', 'Rivers', 'waterfront', 'home', 'apartment', 'home', 'borders', 'obsessive', 'Clearly', 'was', 'intent', 'perhaps', 'establish', 'everything', 'haunted', 'ominous', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'film', 'zombie', 'hitting', 'lines', 'mark', 'not', 'directly', 'performance', 'only', 'dull', 'character', 'dull', 'same', 'horror', 'movie', 'traps', 'do', 'backing', 'rooms', 'reason', 'persisting', 'ahead', 'strange', 'noises', 'terrible', 'tidings', 'result', 'White', 'Noise', 'offer', 'up', 'few', 'scares', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'details', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'out', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'dead', 'set', 'seeing', 'film', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'think', 'out', 'checking', 'brain', 'door', 'slow', 'paced', 'suspense', 'films', 'are', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'are', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'White', 'Noise', 'not', 'many', 'Sadly', 'DVD', 'fun', 'cheap', 'scares', 'will', 'be', 'subdued', 'so', 'must', 'see', 'try', 'see', 'big', 'screen']",White Noise
632486,AE8LL9S715YTE,B00005JNNT,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[2, 7]","I won't bother with writing a large essay as to what the movie is about, I am sure that by now you've either seen it or talked about it to others so I dont have to go into saying why the characters do what they do.  If you haven't watched the movie, the main character Rivers uses EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) to speak and interact with his late wife.  Fancy name to necromancy, speaking to the dead, but now is ""hiphop"" in flavor to such an extent that I have coworkers in my job who now (after watching the movie) go out to old grave yards and old houses to speak to the dead using recording devices.  And they too have had their show of scares, not surprisingly.This is an important movie and it is important but not for the reasons why the writers and directors thought it would be.  First and foremost it shows just how dangerous it is to involve oneself in the occult, going to mediums going to seances studying tarot practicing witchcraft.  As with the main character, Jonathan Rivers, the occult sucks you into its labyrinth, ghosts or ""loved ones"" from the other side are truly demons that seek to hurt, seek to undermine, seek to warp one's point of view.  The main character, as he tries to practice a 21st century form of necromancy, finds himself losing grounds with reality, with his son, with those around him.  The more he wants to explore and see his late wife through electrical devices, and the more he seems to be sent out to find those who need help (guided by the white noise of EVP), the more he finds hell in the shadows of reality.  Occult desire to speak to his wife turns into an obvious addiction to using computers and wires and electricity to speak to the dead, all the while the demonic shadows grow closer and closer to the obvious ending.I know from my own experiences in the occult, practicing witchcraft until being saved to Christ, one is easily duped into a dangerous world of spirits of the like that Jonathan Rivers meets...only in real life, they really are demons not goddesses or loved ones or spirit guides.  Demons like exactly both sides of the coin, both with what Jonathan Rivers was doing and what the killer was doing--more involved in the darkness, the more the darkness swallows you up until the end.

I thought as I walked out this movie.Completely disregarding the fact that it is a January movie, I had high hopes for ""White Noise"". There are some creepy situations one can explore when speaking of EVP. This film fails to find even one thing creepy.The Opening:It began VERY, VERY slowly-- It took quite a while for Michael Keaton's wife to die. Everyone who saw the trailer new she was going to die, so why not get that part over with? Anyway, even after enduring the snail-like beginning, I still was quite intrigued.The Body:Not too bad, actually, to a point. The plot was alright, until the fortune-telling part.It wasn't the greatest setup, but the situations had some potential to hit the audience with an ending so large and spectacular, it would render them catatonic. Who were the three shadowy figures? Were they some sort of angels, demons, robots? What was their motive? Did they need human flesh to survive in the upper world, so that they could assimilate into the body of the president and take over, uh, Morocco? Why did the woman, who had no suicidal tendencies jump off a balcony? Was she possessed? Did she see an Oreo on the sidewalk? Who knows! 'Cause they don't tell you a single thing! You know, I like movies that leave a few unanswered questions to get the audience thinking, but DUDE! Tie up a few of those loose knots, will ya?

Some hit the bullseye, and some miss the mark entirely. This one falls somewhere in between. Before I go on any further, let me just say that I have always been a big fan of Michael Keaton and I enjoyed this flick for the fact that he was in a a pretty big and popular film. He seems to disappear for a while and he isn't used as much as he sould be. With that being said, Keaton's return is justified by his humble performance of Jonathan Rivers. Rivers is an architect with a beautiful home on the water, a young son, and a beautiful wife named Anna(who just revealed a happy surprise to Jonathan). But his dream life is taken away from him in an instant when his wife goes missing and is later announced dead. Things in his life change even further when he is visited by a man named Raymond Price, who tells Rivers that he has come into contact with Anna from the ""other side' thru EVP. Known as Electric Voice Phenomena, EVP is a device that many paranormal experts use to communicate with the dead. Voices of the deceased come thru in the snow on your TV or phone, or radio. EVP swallows up Jonathan's existence and he is soon on a neverending quest to hear something from Anna. His new home quickly turning into an audio/video equipment showplace. But as in most thrillers of this nature, not everything is hunky dory. You meddle in death, and you stir up some bad mojo. Messing with the forces of nature. Soon, Jonathan is involved with eerie messages from the beyond on how to find and hopefully save people before they actually die. Plot secrets abound in the form of Anna's true demise, and who are these three strange shadows that appear whenever something bad is going to happen?. All is revealed in an ending that is just as confusing as it is predictable. Jonathan is helped along the way by Sarah(Deborah Kara Unger), a woman who just recently lost her fiancee, and who meets Jonathan while having her own EVP sessions with Price. The movie scores with the fact that it plays on fears, chills, and thrills, while downplaying the usual horror-ish movie standards. While a number of the scares, or ""Jumps"", will chill and even spook some, they still seem to be almost expected. Still, the mood is undeniably creepy and eerie in many places, and director Geoffrey Sax films many of the more chilling and tense moments with the right amount of restraint and straight forwardness that the type of scares it has. The movie's plot and own twists and turns seem to cave in on another as the film goes on, making the film seem to lose it's way before it gets to the big finish, but it delivers for what it is. It's not strikingly new or original, but it holds your interest for the most part and does have some good ""goosebump"" moments. Keaton is always nice to see, and he plays Jonathan as well as he could with the somewhat overwrought material. You pretty much watch every moment he's on screen, and since the cast is very limited, he's on screen pretty much every second. Unger really has nothing to do except to be the friend to lean on and to be there when something happens. Anyone could of done that role in their sleep. With it's flaws, sometimes confusing logic, and plot holes, White Noise can still entertain and deliver some real chills, but it won't stand a ghost of a chance to be included on any good 'ghost movie' list. And even tho Michael Keaton was in ""First Daughter"" with Katie Holmes, this one, and the upcoming ""Herbie"" movie, let's give him more meaty roles that he deserves.

632494,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JNNT,B. E Jackson,"[3, 3]","Normally I get angry when I feel people unfairly bash a horror movie, because the horror style is without a doubt my cup of tea. However, with White Noise, the lack of a scary atmosphere kind of hurt the plot and lowers the rating.I agree with the people who say that, as the movie went along, it began to lose much of its scariness and became more of a regular mystery suspense.  The word ""suspense"" is sort of exaggerated, because I wasn't afraid of anything happening on screen, and I wasn't particularly interested in what was happening either.  Okay, the scenes that had to do with the people who have ""crossed over"" shown on the television sets was interesting, because thinking about the afterlife is a mystery for everyone and worth finding out what other peoples opinions and interpretations of death are about (in this case, wondering about the opinion of the movie writers).  In that respect, White Noise works.The scenes showing Michael Keaton's dead wife on the TV screen were exciting and certainly the highlights of the film because these scenes allowed you to think to yourself ""how much will she reveal about herself to help Michael understand she has crossed over and is trying to communicate with her alive husband"".  Disagree you might, but I bet as you were watching the movie you wanted her to eventually be able to communicate with Michael Keaton clearly and perfectly because death is a mystery for all of us.  There was always something in the way making it difficult for Michael to see her, and communicate with her.  This is good writing.Besides that, some of the scary scenes that caught my attention were at the very beginning when Michael Keaton was staying up late and waiting for his wife to return home, and, it was real late at night, and as he was watching the clock at a specific time he leaves the room for a few seconds to return and realize that the ticking sounds of the clock just STOPPED.  This was a good moment.Later on Michael Keaton began to see strange things, and this brought a sense of excitement and a question of ""what's happening"" from the viewer.  It led me to believe that more unexpected scary moments like this were on the way, with Michael continuing to see strange things at unexpected moments, but unfortunately the plot turned more into a normal mystery after that, and I lost interest.  Don't get me wrong, the eerie spirits of (a few) of the dead people continued to come back, but nothing too interesting took place.  Then again, this may have been a good thing.  Revealing too much about the afterlife to Michael Keaton would have made the plot seem either tacky or fake.The ending is still a bit strange to me.  Strange in that, it makes sense, but I have mixed feelings about it.  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, so let's just say something happens at the very end that's supposed to only happen at night.  At least, the rest of the movie led us to believe it only happened at night.  And then the movie ends.  Having this thing happen in the afternoon for the very first time at the end of the movie didn't make sense to me.Still, it had enough good moments to watch once or twice.  But I thought the movie overall got kind of slow during certain parts and that drops the rating a bit, along with the lack of scary moments.

I bought it at a bookstore for a buck. I am a fan of Michael Keaton and figured if he was involved it couldn't be that bad of a movie. I was severely wrong as the movie was terrible. What killed it for me is how slow it is. It takes nearly have the movie before anything happens. The film is extremely boring.  The idea felt stale and recycled. I have seen the whole concept of husband communicated with dead wife before but those movies didn't suck this bad and were interesting. The film wasn't scary at all. I thought it should be based on the idea of communicating with the dead. A scary movie needs to be scary. The actors were terrible aside from Keaton. I think their parts were likely written poorly. The story came off bland and poorly written and there was little excitement as the movie moved at a snail's pace.I feel bad for Keaton as instead of reviving his career this was another coffin nail to his career. I was very disappointed in the movie.

The trailer that I saw at the movie theater had the explanation of EVP, Electric Voice Phenomena, when the dead communicate to the living through electrical devices like radios, Televisions, Cell phones (I guess they have unlimited nights and weekends on the other side `can you hear me now?'), they played real life EVP, the woman saying ""get out of my house"" and ""I love you"", it was really creepy. SO naturally I thought the movie based on these phenomena would also be just as creepy, but I was so wrong. The entire first 10-15 minutes was excruciatingly slow, we have the husband John, and the wife Anna, and there is this kid, who I didn't catch his name because he is freakishly quiet and really just background the whole time, I was confused on who the kid belonged to. The pregnant wife goes missing, and then dead, and thus begins the EVP, through a boom box, cell phone and other things, We get to see an EVP specialist who spends to much time indoors, and a grieving woman who needs some makeup badly (you would think her dead fianc&eacute;e would tell her through EVP to invest in some lipstick at least) We get some baddies that are represented through three shadows and a lot of cussing. John is supposed to be our hero, and I feel nothing at all for him! Who cares about his dead wife and kid when he doesn't even pay attention to the kid he has now? People die, babies are saved, and the three phantom cursers are holding some chick hostage (who I care nothing for, hello? Character development much?) In this entire confusing boring plot there are lots of TVs and computers with static and morphed faces and voices, but it's not scary at all! They should have made him hit the TV and Bam! A re-run of Method and Red pops up, now that is frightening! Michael Keaton is not an actor with a lot of range, his reactions and expressions are deadpan, and there were no other semi-big names in the movie to help him carry the load. In the end, he follows the clues his dead wife leads him to ""go now my love"" (yawn), and he finds the woman held captive by......a freaking construction worker? What? Who is being controlled by the three mahatma ghandi apparitions? They surround our hero and I guess tickle him to death, and breath stank rotten electrified breath and he topples over the edge, I wasted an hour and a half of my life to have nothing explained to me! Who were the spooks? Why was the construction dude murdering women?  Did they control him? How? Why did they trash his place? And the most important question of all WHO green lighted this Poo-fest?

Rich, wonderful guy and his rich, wonderful wife and their rich, not-so-wonderful tragedy, yadda, yadda- we've seen it all before. The cinematography is a bit flat and overlit. However, after the slowish start this movie puts the pedal to the metal. Michael Keaton does obsession well, and his descent into madness as he scans the airwaves for messages from his dead wife is well rendered. The conceit of the story lends itself very well to some truly disturbing imagery, and as befits a story of this type the malevolent force he encounters is never truly explained. There are some real scares in this film, as well as some seriously disturbing imagery (and sounds). Some have said this was merely an American ripoff of Japanese Horror, but while it obviously takes inspiration from the new wave of Asian horror cinema, it packs an emotional punch those movies can't muster. The fact that the film follows a more American approach of narrative logic gives it a leg up on some of those over-rated films. The way the film progresses from New Agey sentimentalism to nihilistic terror is startling to behold. Just when you think this film will be another Sixth Sense weepfest, it kicks you in the groin. Repeatedly. If you liked the American version of the Ring (which I loved), you'll find this makes a wonderful companion to your psychic horror collection.Don't believe the criticism of this movie- this is a very powerful and satisfying psychological horror film.

They are rarely seen, except in a few pretty cool looking scenes on a snowy TV screen, the writer or director really should of developed those characters better. ""What where they?"" For one thing. Ok, so the killer at the end kidnaps women and tortures them for the delight of the three ghosts? Yet, they personally do bodily harm to the main character at the end of the film? So, if they have the capability of doing bodily harm on their own, what was the point of the killer who does the kidnapping for them. It just did not tie together well at all, having this crazed killer going around kidnapping and killing people (because the three ghosts need him to?), and also the three ghosts going around messing up peoples rooms and also killing people. Then we have the main character who finds a way to save people from being almost killed, which he sort of does on two or three occasions. The funny thing is the police never suspect him of being the killer. His wife is killed, lady in a car dies, but he does save her baby and then a lady, he just met, jumps off a balcony. I think their would be a tad bit of suspicion on the guy. Also, the detective character goes nowhere. This movie had potential, but totally blew it.

One such area has been steadily increasing in interest is EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon. In this, images or sounds from the afterlife appear or are heard on a detuned radio or on your tv static. So the film, unlike the Forgotten, gets you into a topic you wouldn't otherwise know of, but they just can't make a good film out of it in the end.Jonathan Rivers is a re-married man whose living his wife Anna, who's a successful writer, who's also pregnant. One night she doesn't come home until he realizes she's missing. Sure enough, her car is found abandoned by the docks. She's found dead couple weeks later. A man approaches him and says that Anna's been communicating with him through EVP. Jonathan dismisses it until he starts to realize there might be something.This draws him further and further into EVP until it literally consumes his life and becomes an obsession. The voices tell him to save people before they die, but there's 3 shadowed men that don't want anyone interfering. Helping him is Sarah, who lost her fiance.The film is similar to any other recent horror movie which scares you by that silence then wham, big boom in the score. One example is when he is watching a normal TV static until a woman suddenly screams and appears on tv. Some of the scares seem a little obvious like when 3 apparitions appear in a room. The scene looks just completely green sceen looking.The film has quite a lot of plot points and script problems that'll scratch your head. Like they say it takes quite awhile before you have your first EVP since it helps if you're in an area with history, yet he receives them like wildfire. In one sequence, the obligatory ""montage"" scene he gets nothing for a long time then he attracts them like Winnie the Pooh to honey.The film is interesting on a topical level and it might make you jump several times but on an actual film basis, it's rather lacking.Side note: I don't know if it was just my disc but I couldn't really rewind the film and it actually just fast forwarded and I couldn't stop it and had to turn it off(the disc or something else?

Well...somewhere between there and the screen this thing got lost.

EVP goes back many years, with researchers like George Meek and his 'Spiricom' project supposedly having proved the existence of mysterious electronic voices 'from beyond' (do an online search with the words 'George Meek' and 'Spiricom').  Meek was a Pennsylvania engineer and Ham Radio operator, well respected in his field, who has documented these EVP voices before the current EVP craze hit.  His 'Spiricom' project consisted of obtaining EVP voices with all kinds of tape and radio equipment including experimenting with oscillators and beat frequencies.  There was an excellent non-fiction book on the subject titled 'The Ghost of 28 Megacycles' that described Meek and his experiments.  If you can find a copy, it is HIGHLY recommended reading.  You won't be able to put the book down!  In any case, 'White Noise' is well acted, has a good plot, and a healthy mix of very tense and/or scary moments, all made ever the more scarier if you believe in EVP.  Of course Hollywood embellishes some of the EVP scenes a bit, but this only adds to the wow factor of what EVP could actually be like.  This well made film asks the viewer to suspend any disbelief, and it works.  You will be drawn into the plot, and the ending is very good.

632514,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JNNT,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","I know some people think this film is seven kinds of awful, but I was not disappointed in the slightest by it.  Maybe it's the fact that I was already familiar with the subject of EVP.  If you're introduced to this sort of phenomenon in a vacuum, it does sound incredibly hokey.  I'm not saying it's real, but I've heard some pretty spooky stuff on some professional recordings.  If you can't suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to imagine that the events taking place in this movie are possible, I daresay it's impossible to enjoy the film.  Of course, White Noise goes far beyond EVP as we know it.  The main character not only hears voices from those who have passed on, he starts seeing and hearing things that have yet to take place.  But I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself here.Michael Keaton plays architect Jonathan Rivers, whose very happy life is torn asunder when his wife goes missing and is later found dead.  Before the body is found, he's visited by a doughy stranger who tells him that his wife is dead and that she has been trying to communicate with him.  He leaves the disbelieving Jonathan his card, but eventually Jonathan goes to see him.  This fellow Raymond (Ian McNeice) is basically obsessed with EVT, and he has used all sorts of high-dollar recording equipment to record white noise TV signals; the tapes, when played later, often contain sounds and images of the dead, and he has helped communicate messages from the beyond to those left behind.  He also picks up a good bit of hostile language and images of rather disquieting manifestations, but that just goes with the territory (dying doesn't make a mean person any nicer).  Jonathan changes his tune (albeit a little too quickly and easily) when he hears his wife's voice on one of Raymond's tapes, and he immediately becomes obsessed with EVT himself, setting up all sorts of recording equipment of his own.  He is perplexed when he learns that he has been receiving some signals from folks before their imminent deaths, and he interprets all of this as a charge from his dead wife to try and help these people.  I myself would interpret his wife's injunctions as a warning against the dangerous manifestations increasingly making their presence felt in the recordings, but I'm not the heroic sort of fellow that Jonathan seems to be.  Everything leads up to a perfectly satisfying conclusion; it would have been easy to blow the whole movie at the end, but that didn't happen.White Noise features a number of jump-worthy moments, and certain scenes are eerie enough to make you feel unsettled.  I also happen to think the plot holds together quite well, although it's definitely out there.  I have sort of an indifferent attitude toward Michael Keaton, but I thought he played his part very effectively in this movie.  I can't see how some lose sympathy with his character, a man obsessed with contacting his recently deceased and greatly loved wife.  This film does not deliver an accurate accounting of EVP, but it's a movie, not a documentary.

632515,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00005JNNT,Danno,"[2, 4]","This is a non-spoiler review of ""White Noise"" even though most readers probably know all the plot twists by now.""White Noise"" is a fairly suspenseful, largely nongraphic suspense/horror film that does a good job of conjuring up a perpetually creepy mood. True, part of the credit goes to the drizzly Vancouver locations, but it's nice to see nevertheless. At heart, this is a B-movie, full of large lapses in logic and several plot twists that came out of nowhere. I'm willing to forgive the film these flaws because it's quite honest about its Saturday Afternoon Double Feature pedigree.Michael Keaton's performance is the greatest strength of the movie. He starts off as a married man who is perhaps a little too contented. (I suspect that his buddy-buddy relationship with his ex-wife in scattered scenes suggest his character has lots of repression issues.) Following his second wife's death, Keaton's character becomes more and more obsessed with the possibility of communicating with the dead via the static in videotapes, radio, and the like. Even if such communication were true, his constant obsession is definitely an unhealthy one.I admired his performance in this film. Naysayers may tell you that he's over-the-top but that's exactly what this film needs to jerk itself out of its Made-for-TV mode. In fact, I'd compare what he does in this film to what Vincent Price did for similar B-movies in the 1950s and 60s. He takes what could be a throwaway film and turns it into something to viewer can take seriously for 90 minutes. I came to this film expecting to hate it and yet I enjoyed it almost entirely because of Keaton's talents.Other reviewers have highlighted this movie's flaws.

632517,A23WIR1UONF5BI,B00005JNNT,David Labelle,"[3, 9]","I went to see this movie because I have been into the whole ghost hunting and paranormal bit for a long time now.  When I saw a couple of the T.V. spots, I was absolutely ecstatic that I could see what sort of take Hollywood could conjure up regarding the idea of communicating with the dead.  It all seemed ""true to life"" so to speak, until the scene with the psychic-lunatic-fringe girl that started going on about how EVP was bad and it wasn't a good thing. This started to make me see what the movie is really about, and what message they were really trying to beam into the heads of the audience (especially ghost hunters like myself who may have been attracted to the theater).  For anyone who considers themselves active in the paranormal field, it is widely known that the christians consider communication with those in the afterlife as a ticket to instant damnation.  They are very frightened by EVP as it completely shakes their beleif structure to its core.  Now here is where my opinion could make you think I am paranoid and on the lunatic fringe myself.  The movie's official website tries to cover up the fact the movie is a tool invented by some christians by inserting a link to the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomenon.  But, the message of the movie is still unchanged: Don't attempt communiaction with the world beyond, because the results could be disastrous.  I heartily encourage other ghost hunters like myself to go see this movie and make their own judgments.  As for me, my opinion is formed and I believe that this movie is a tool made by some christians designed to frightenthose who are curious about such matters.  The movie ends with the screen reading: ""1 out of every 10 Recorded EVPs is threatening"".  Nice try, but I am not scared. Call me crazy, but that's just what I think.UPDATE:  Okay, after doing my research, I discovered I was wrong.  The Amercian Association of Electronic Voice Phenomenon actually provided a lot of input for the creators of the movie.  Boy, I feel like an ass.  Overall, this movie is pretty decent aside from a few holes in the plot.  Once again, I encourage anyone who entertains the notion that contact with the other side is possible to go see this movie.",4,"It was good, but it was obviously a tool",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2239,"['went', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'paranormal', 'bit', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'When', 'saw', 'couple', 'T.V', 'spots', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ecstatic', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'sort', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'conjure', 'up', 'regarding', 'idea', 'communicating', 'dead', 'seemed', 'true', 'life', 'so', 'speak', 'scene', 'psychic-lunatic-fringe', 'girl', 'started', 'going', 'how', 'EVP', 'was', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'started', 'make', 'see', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'what', 'message', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'beam', 'heads', 'audience', 'especially', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'attracted', 'theater', 'anyone', 'who', 'active', 'paranormal', 'field', 'widely', 'known', 'christians', 'consider', 'communication', 'afterlife', 'ticket', 'instant', 'damnation', 'are', 'very', 'frightened', 'EVP', 'completely', 'beleif', 'structure', 'core', 'Now', 'here', 'where', 'opinion', 'could', 'make', 'think', 'am', 'paranoid', 'lunatic', 'fringe', 'movie', 'official', 'website', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'movie', 'tool', 'invented', 'christians', 'inserting', 'link', 'American', 'Association', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'message', 'movie', 'still', 'unchanged', 'Do', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'communiaction', 'world', 'results', 'could', 'be', 'disastrous', 'heartily', 'encourage', 'other', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'make', 'own', 'judgments', 'opinion', 'formed', 'believe', 'movie', 'tool', 'made', 'christians', 'designed', 'frightenthose', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'such', 'matters', 'movie', 'screen', 'reading', '1', '10', 'Recorded', 'EVPs', 'threatening', 'Nice', 'try', 'am', 'not', 'scared', 'Call', 'crazy', 'just', 'what', 'think.UPDATE', 'Okay', 'doing', 'research', 'discovered', 'was', 'wrong', 'Amercian', 'Association', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'actually', 'provided', 'lot', 'input', 'creators', 'movie', 'Boy', 'feel', 'ass', 'Overall', 'movie', 'pretty', 'decent', 'aside', 'few', 'holes', 'plot', 'Once', 'again', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'notion', 'contact', 'other', 'side', 'possible', 'go', 'see', 'movie']",White Noise

This movie can be a tearjerker (as can be the extras.) Jonathon isn't ready to let go of his wife so he turns to Electronic Voice Phenomenon in order to communicate with her. What is Electronic Voice Phenomenon you might ask? Well this is actually a real thing, it wasn't just made up for the movie. People actually believe that you can communicate with people who have passed away by listening to the white noise. The white noise most often used is the scratchy sound that the television makes when it is not tuned to the correct channel. Now the movie White Noise is a roller coaster thrill a minute supernatural, this one definitely falls into the scary movie category.The DVD has some really neat extras. The extra that I found most interesting was the eight minute featurette titled ""Making Contact: EVP Experts."" This featurette is about real life people who believe in and practice EVP. It is a heart breaking feature because all three of the people who practice EVP in the feature are parents who have lost children. This short documentary will make you want to believe in EVP if you don't already believe in it. They believe they here there children in the white noise. One woman believes she heard her son say, ""This is Rob."" Another woman claims her deceased daughter said, ""Where's Mom?"" She believes her daughter made contact via another relative's computer.Another interesting feature is ""Recording The After Life At Home."" I really could not believe that this was exactly what is claimed. It is a step by step guide of how to get started with EVP in your home. The hosts tell you that you need a microphone and a tape recording device. They also suggest that you turn on a fan or have water running in the background. To simplify the step by step instructions, actual words appear on the screen to help you out with the process.The next featurette is titled ""Hearing is believing.""

The only interest was the dilemma of a child whose mother has died and who then has to confront an obsessive delusional father.

The creepy voices of loved ones being heard over the speakers, seeing them on snowy screens ala Poltergeist style.  However, I was greatly disappointed when leaving the theater.  The ghosts weren't very scary, the story became more of a murder-mystery, and it lacked... horror!Initially, the film seemed promising about a guy trying to contact his dead wife from the beyond using electronic devices, and by doing so opening the door for 'other', darker spirits to enter our realm. Then the plot changes to a mystery, where the movie goes downhill...They had the actors, they had an ideal concept for a good ghost film but they fell short with the plot...The PG-13 rating had to hurt also. Now having the DVD i saw the deleted scenes which would've helped the film, but changed it to an R rating.  Oh well...I also saw the movie ""PULSE"" where the storyline was better, the ghosts were scary, yet the actors and acting fell short.

632528,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00005JNNT,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[1, 1]","Look, want a full review of this flick, look at the Spotlight Reviews earlier here, but I'm not going to talk about that. But what I am going to talk about is what the whole movie was based upon, and how Hollywood got it wrong....so very wrong.EVP, electronic voice phenomenon, is a techinque used to record voices that's origin truly cannot be explained other than from another realm (that's a safe way of explaining it). However, this ACTUALLY DOES EXIST & IS REAL! But not like how the movie shows it.First off, when they show the audio recordings happening, that's pretty accurate, that's how they're done and pretty much sound (be it not so long and not that clear). But the stuff with the TV or electronic objects just turning on by themselves or clocks stopping or cell phones just ringing with a phone call from the dead, no that just doesn't happen, they added that for the movie (Ugh!). And what's up with the ""ghosts"" appearing, killing anyone that gets into their path? That's not what EVP's are all about (or even capable of), why turn this into another ""Poltergeist"", when this actually occurs and is real with proof to boot?!!? Why make a movie, the FIRST movie EVER to even mention the case of EVP's like this, so audience members can think it doesn't actually happen & it's just another movie story. As a believer, and someone who actually has expierenced EVP's first hand, I was insulted by how the story was beefed up with so much Hollywood fiction just to sell a few more tickets (which it didn't), instead of making a movie that could present this phenomena in a true, more realistic & believable light.Don't believe me? Put it in Google, listen to the THOUSANDS of recorded sound bites of EVP's presented on-line, and judge for yourself. Trust me, they all can't be fake, and there's just too much proof for it all to be a hoax (I mean hey, they did make a whole movie about it, right? Just the wrong movie.).But the DVD does have some merit though. Included are three extras with real life EVP experts that show you the true study of this, with actual recorded EVP's and techniques on how to do so. Then you TRULY can see the difference between writing stuff about a true phenomena & creating a movie version of it. I mean, at the end of the movie it says most EVP's are aggresive in nature, then in the extras the experts claims most are not. Why didn't the movie's writers catch that one, huh? Did the experts ever mention that EVP's also contain ""visions"" or ""ghosts"" accompaning them? No, they didn't, but the movie writers appearently know more than they do (sure...). I'd say most believers, like myself, were truly insulted when they finally saw this film. And if you ever expierenced this, you'd feel the same way.Okay, okay. You want to see a real life ghost related to EVP's appear on your TV? Okay, explain this one then: Go to the Special Features section, chose the third choice ""Hearing Is Believing"", go exactly 9 minutes & 5 seconds into it, and look in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. What in the world is that circular object floating by the expert's head?!!? Could that be a ""ghost"" captured on screen at a time when it might have also been recorded as an audio EVP? Who knows, judge that bit for yourself I guess.To sum up, this one's a definite rental, and mostly for the three extra documentaries alone, not for the joke of a movie that got them a DVD to begin with. Electronic Voice Phenomenon is a proven fact, and for the first movie ever to bring it so much in the public's view, to be treated like a horror movie version of Demi Moore's ""Ghost"" was just insulting.So let me leave you with some humor: Throughout watching this movie, rolling my eyes at how far removed the facts were from the fiction, seeing the typical British buddy buying it by the second act, the famous wife buying it in the first, and Michael Keaton trying to hold it all together, I kept saying the same thing to myself: ""I can't believe this guy used to be Batman"".",2,EVP's Set Back To Being A Joke Again......,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,4001,"['Look', 'want', 'full', 'review', 'flick', 'look', 'Spotlight', 'Reviews', 'earlier', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'talk', 'what', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'wrong', '.so', 'very', 'wrong.EVP', 'electronic', 'voice', 'phenomenon', 'techinque', 'used', 'record', 'voices', 'origin', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'other', 'realm', 'safe', 'way', 'explaining', 'However', 'ACTUALLY', 'DOES', 'EXIST', 'IS', 'REAL', 'not', 'how', 'movie', 'it.First', 'off', 'when', 'show', 'audio', 'recordings', 'happening', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'how', ""'re"", 'done', 'pretty', 'much', 'sound', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'clear', 'stuff', 'TV', 'electronic', 'objects', 'just', 'turning', 'clocks', 'stopping', 'cell', 'phones', 'just', 'ringing', 'phone', 'call', 'dead', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'added', 'movie', 'Ugh', 'what', 'up', 'ghosts', 'appearing', 'killing', 'anyone', 'path', 'not', 'what', 'EVP', 'are', 'even', 'capable', 'why', 'turn', 'Poltergeist', 'when', 'actually', 'real', 'proof', 'boot', 'Why', 'make', 'movie', 'FIRST', 'movie', 'EVER', 'even', 'mention', 'case', 'EVP', 'so', 'audience', 'members', 'can', 'think', ""n't"", 'actually', 'happen', 'just', 'movie', 'story', 'believer', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'expierenced', 'EVP', 'first', 'hand', 'was', 'insulted', 'how', 'story', 'was', 'beefed', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'just', 'sell', 'few', 'more', 'tickets', 'did', ""n't"", 'instead', 'making', 'movie', 'could', 'present', 'phenomena', 'true', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable', 'light.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Put', 'Google', 'THOUSANDS', 'recorded', 'sound', 'bites', 'EVP', 'presented', 'on-line', 'judge', 'yourself', 'Trust', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fake', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'proof', 'be', 'hoax', 'mean', 'hey', 'did', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'right', 'Just', 'wrong', 'movie', '.But', 'DVD', 'have', 'merit', 'Included', 'are', 'three', 'extras', 'real', 'life', 'EVP', 'experts', 'show', 'true', 'study', 'actual', 'recorded', 'EVP', 'techniques', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'Then', 'TRULY', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'writing', 'stuff', 'true', 'phenomena', 'creating', 'movie', 'version', 'mean', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'EVP', 'are', 'aggresive', 'nature', 'then', 'extras', 'experts', 'claims', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'writers', 'catch', 'one', 'huh', 'Did', 'experts', 'ever', 'mention', 'EVP', 'also', 'contain', 'visions', 'ghosts', 'accompaning', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'appearently', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'sure', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'believers', 'were', 'truly', 'insulted', 'when', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'ever', 'expierenced', ""'d"", 'feel', 'same', 'way.Okay', 'okay', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'ghost', 'related', 'EVP', 'appear', 'TV', 'Okay', 'explain', 'one', 'then', 'Go', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'chose', 'third', 'choice', 'Hearing', 'Believing', 'go', 'exactly', '9', 'minutes', '5', 'seconds', 'look', 'upper', 'right-hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'What', 'world', 'circular', 'object', 'floating', 'expert', 'head', 'Could', 'be', 'ghost', 'captured', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'recorded', 'audio', 'EVP', 'Who', 'judge', 'bit', 'guess.To', 'sum', 'up', 'one', 'definite', 'rental', 'mostly', 'three', 'extra', 'documentaries', 'alone', 'not', 'joke', 'movie', 'got', 'DVD', 'begin', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'proven', 'fact', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'public', 'view', 'be', 'treated', 'horror', 'movie', 'version', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Ghost', 'was', 'just', 'insulting.So', 'let', 'leave', 'humor', 'Throughout', 'watching', 'movie', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'how', 'far', 'removed', 'facts', 'were', 'fiction', 'seeing', 'typical', 'British', 'buddy', 'buying', 'second', 'act', 'famous', 'wife', 'buying', 'first', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'trying', 'hold', 'together', 'kept', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'myself', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'guy', 'used', 'be', 'Batman']",White Noise

Michael Keaton stars in this less than stellar performance of a not so original story.In the film Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, a highly successful architect, married to Anna Rivers, a highly successful writer.  Jonathon plans to put his job on hiatus and join his wife on her new book tour for her soon-to-be release book.  However, upon the notice that his wife might be expecting, Anna fails returns home. After the abduction of his wife and her subsequent death, Jonathan becomes sullen and uncaring, distant and unaware of his surroundings until he becomes acquainted with Raymond Price (played by Ian McNeice).  Price has also lost someone very close to him, his son, almost 12 years prior.  However, Price receives messages, transmissions, and images from entities from the ""other"" side in the form of E.V.P.s (Electronic Voice Phenomena) or White Noise.  The problem is that not all the transmissions are from ""good"" spirits.Jonathan gets totally absorbed into this medium, and starts receiving regular messages from his wife.  He quickly figures out that the transmissions that he's receiving are actually hints/clues to help him prevent impending death and disaster.  The problem is that the ""bad"" entities are using the same technique to produce death and disaster.In film has a great premise, and a good beginning; however, it quickly spirals into the absurd, with a trio of evil spirits out to kill mankind.  I really believe the film could have been much better with a whole lots less going on.  The writers could not decide what story they wanted to tell, and therefore was unable to tell any story effectively.  The pinnacle of absurdity begins with Jonathan's wife making visual contact with him in a deserted warehouse, and culminates into what I can only describe as the hell demon sequence in Ghost.  I could not figure out what message the film was trying to get across to the audience.  What started out as a film about ""righting the wrong"" or telling love ones that you were okay, and start living your life again; turn into a film of ""talk to the dead, and die"" with both human and spiritual henchmen.My advice would be to try another selection; there are much better films out there that are more scary or physiologically thrilling.

""Walls"" like that are usually the first response to encountering new ideas and if viewers can simply watch this well made film without prejudices, then perhaps the study of after death experiences will gain attention that in turn will encourage further investigation.WHITE NOISE as written by Niall Johnson and directed by Geoffrey Sax explores the concept of EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, a 'science' of recognizable words that are picked up by various electronic machines (telephones, televisions, radios, etc), words that are names of the deceased, phrases that send messages to the living (according to the scientists that work with this field the majority of the phrases are warnings of malevolent occurrences), sounds that are reproducible and are even accompanied by visual images of the departed. The DVD of this movie contains reports from those exploring this field and examples of EVP from resources outside the production of this film, providing some backup that should you watch them are informative.John Rivers (Michael Keaton) is a successful architect happily married to successful novelist Anna (Chandra West) living in the elegant suburbs of Vancouver with his young son from a previous marriage.  Anna has just discovered that she is pregnant and the couple is ecstatic.  Anna drives off to an event concerning her latest novel but never returns.  Her car is found by the water but she is not in the car.  John wants to believe she is still alive until the police inform him the body has been found,  Devastated, John begins to hear strange sounds, discovers he is being 'stalked', but when he confronts the 'stalker' he finds a kind Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) who tells John about EVP and that he has been receiving messages from Anna.  John scoffs and yet as his anguish over Anna's death threatens to paralyze him he eventually contacts Price.  In Price's 'home lab' he meets Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) who has just successfully spoken with and seen her departed husband.  Slowly John becomes convinced that EVP is viable and begins receiving information from Anna about events in and around Vancouver that predict malevolence.  John engages the police and pursues the messages he hears from Anna, finding predictions from beyond to be true.  Price admonishes John that while some of the voices from the other side are loving, others are evil and can destroy. And after the  bizarre death of Price, John and Sarah join in pursuing clues that eventually lead to the surprising conclusion of the story.Yes, there are gapping holes in the script, there are character motivations left unexplained, and there is the unfortunate introduction of animation 'ghosts' toward the finale that cheapen the impact.  But the mood is terrifying and jolting and keeps you on the edge of your seat - if you just give in to the idea that EVP is a possibility.  Michael Keaton gives a superb performance in this practically one-man show and his portrayal of John gives the tone of authenticity much needed in stories such as this.If you are a skeptic and not one who gives credence to concepts of afterlife or communication with the deceased or in general anything that can't be covered by a media group from CNN, then this film will probably not register.  But for those with open minds this is a fine suspense story and serves to open windows into thought experiences others are exploring.

The trailers looked awesome, but the trailers for Darkness were also good trailers.  And anyone who's seen Darkness knows how bad it is.  Ok, on with the review.  Michael Keaton's character has lost his wife, who is an author.  He soon meets a man on the street who says he can help him contact her again.  Naturally, Michael Keaton's character doesn't believe this for a couple of months.  It's something called 'white noise'.  The spirits can be detected through recorded video tapes, and also audio tapes.  He does manage to contact her, and becomes obsessive...until he releases something evil that is seeking him.I enjoyed this movie THOROUGHLY.  I can tell you that much.  It's very underrated, and I wish that all these people would stop bashing it.  The slow pace helps build up for the great little ending, which I personally enjoyed.  The storyline was pretty good and had a mixture of many different supernatural flicks in it.  Like, Poltergeist and Ghost for example.

Thus, we get the movie ""White Noise"" starring the formidable Michael Keaton.  The plot of ""White Noise"" involves an architect whose wife goes mysteriously missing one night.  As hours turn into days and days turn into weeks, the police and our protagonist, Michael Keaton's character, begin to suspect the worst.  Then, one day a mysterious man begins to follow Keaton, and when Keaton confronts him, the mysterious man has some incredible news for him.  To say much more would be to give the entire movie away for those of you who are interested in watching this movie, but suffice it to say that the plot, notwithstanding some odd twists and turns, is a lot better than the movie itself.""White Noise"" has credibility with some decent acting with Keaton and others, but the real loser here is the script itself. I simply did not like the direction that this movie took as it seemed to focus more on being able to prevent future occurrences rather than the horror associated with the unknown malevolent entities that could be manifested through the white noise phenomenon. Other than a few jump out at you scares, this movie fails to produce the eerie atmosphere and suspense that is necessary for a good horror movie.  ""White Noise"" starts out with some atmosphere early as Keaton learns of the white noise phenomenon, but the movie ultimately fails to deliver.  I would also argue that ""White Noise"" ultimately wasn't sure what it wanted to be in the end whether it be a scary movie or a movie like ""The Dead Zone"" or ""Mothman Prophecies"".  Ultimately, I found ""White Noise"" to be largely dull, unimaginative, boring and anti-climactic producing very little horror and very little suspense.""White Noise"" probably could have been a decent horror movie had they decided to go in a different direction, but the way that the movie transpired left me not only wanting more out of it, but just wanting to be able to stay awake.

Seeking some way to communicate with his deceased wife, he struggles to understand and accept the premises that the living can indeed communicate with the dead.

632551,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JNNT,J from NY,"[2, 2]","Geoffrey Sax's ""White Noise"" is one of the most overlooked, underrated films I have yet to encounter.  While I can't claim to have understood everything that takes place in the film, Michael Keaton (what happened to him) does a great job playing Jonathan Winters, a solid sort of everyman with a successful career in architecture and a lovely pregnant wife Anna (Chandra West) who disappears and is eventually found dead.This is where we are introduced to ""EVP"" or ""Electronic Voice Phenomenon"".  EVP is a ""phenomenon"" in which a person ""hears the voices of the dead"" with the aide of sophisticated audio equipment (or just a tape recorder).In despair over his wife's disappearance and demise, he makes the acquaintance of an odd man, Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) who insists that his wife has tried to make contact with him through ""recordings"" he has heard.  This man is clearly incautious and is either unaware or indifferent to the dangers this kind of experimentation can produce in a more orthodox spiritual sense.  And pretty soon not only is Jonathan a true believer, he is feeding into every ""message"" he receives from the other side, believing wholeheartedly that Anna is dictating warnings, omens, prophecies to him that he must act on.And some of them turn out to be accurate.  He rescues a man dying in a car, nearly frozen to death, and finds the body of a man's wife.  The man wisely enough thanks him and then violently rebukes him at the offer of ""joining his sick f**king cult"".An entity begins to hunt Michael, and just about everything he does is cursed in one way or another. He does not heed anything, and this is a chief flaw in the movie: when his best friend, Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) is levitating on the ledge of a balcony as a result of Michael's continued delving into this dangerous process, he still does not take it as a sign that maybe he should at least slow down. The drive of his character is understandable as a result of losing his wife, but his complete lack of caution is not.Believe whatever you want about EVP, this is one scary movie that should have gotten more attention. There are extras on the disc about EVP which feature ""experts"" in the field sharing their ""recordings"".  They are so cocksure that they are tapping into the spirit world that I found it a bit over the top, but people interested might enjoy it.

Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[1, 1]","The premise for this movie is intriguing and has tons of potential: that the dead attempt to contact the living through air and sound waves. Given the interest in quantum physics generated by films like What the Bleep, that suggest that our seemingly physical universe is a really composed of energy waves, White Noise is seems like an interesting ""what if"" of this theory.I genuinely enjoyed watching this film for several reasons: first, as mentioned in other reviews, Geoffrey Sax directs the film with enough restraint to maintain a level of edge of chair suspense (there are several gotcha moments in the film and I jumped at most of them) but still keeps the movie on pace. Michael Keaton was terrific and entirely believable as the lead character walking the line between shock, grief, and later, an obsession with communicating with his wife in an effort to find meaning in her death. The supporting characters, many of whom are local to the Vancouver area, contributed solid performances that added to the movie as a whole.The sets and production as a whole were perfect. At the beginning of the film the lighting is bright and sunny underscoring the lead character's ""perfect"" life. Following the wife's death, the lighting and mood gradually darken as more scenes occur at night and during thunder storms.The reason I only gave White Noise three stars was because of the questions it raised without providing satisfying answers. Alhough I'm skeptical of the basic premise of the dead haunting our airwaves, I was was game enough to suspend my disbelief in order to enjoy the film. The problem lies more in the number of loose ends that don't really come together and probably could have without too many changes.The story suggests that along with benevolent spirits who want to reassure the living, there are malicious spirits that want to manipulate the living into acts of violence from which they derive some sort of vicarious pleasure. But I wanted to understand who these malevolent spirits were. Where did they come from? At the end did any of the characters learn something?Spoilers here:Some loose ends that bug me were1. It isn't entirely clear how Anna Rivers died: at the end it's suggested that she was a victim of the evil spirit directed serial killer but that remains ambigous.2. Why does Sarah attempt suicide? Again, it's suggested that it was the evil spirits but that's not really explained3. When John is fighting the evil spirits, Sarah goes into convulsions at the hospital. Again, it's not clear why.4. Who or what killed Raymond?5. How does the situation when John saves the infant figure into the plot other than as a device to a. provide a red herring that his wife wants him to intervene (instead of warning him) b. to provide a way to connect the seemingly random charactersBottom line: the strength of direction, acting, and the stylish production is enough to make this this a very enjoyable and spooky film.

I guess they were hoping that a bigger set-up would provide for a bigger emotional payoff, but anyone with a ticket tucked in their pocket knows better. Unless the family is real and engaging, like the para-normally challenged Freeling's from Poltergeist, all that set-up is a waste of time.After offering us an extended portrait of the Rivers family, we are then treated to a rude awakening. Wife Anna (Chandra West) is missing. Time passes, days, and then weeks. Then more bad news. Her body is found. That leaves Jonathan and his son alone to put back the pieces of their shattered lives. They move away hoping to find some peace and serenity, but all Jonathan gets is static. Literally.He thinks it's interference or power lines, but a stranger knows better. He tells Jonathan that the static, also known as White Noise, can be used by the dead to communicate with the living. Skeptical, Jonathan dismisses the stranger, until a series of events lead him to believe that his wife is trying to make a connection. Hope they have roaming charges, because my calling plan doesn't have a touch out and reach someone from beyond the dead option.Pretty soon Jonathan is a believer in Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and obsessively invests in trying to contact his wife. That means reaching out to others who have experienced the same phenomenon, including bookstore owner Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger), who is in contact with her dead fianc&eacute;. You can't blame her. It's the only time he's been stiff without Viagra.Bad joke, bad movie, one that takes almost every cue from Poltergeist. Spirits communicating through the static on electronic appliances? Poltergeist. The protagonist ultimately realizing that the static also contains the presence of evil spirits? Poltergeist. When the filmmakers are done scrap mining Poltergeist, they turn White Noise into a paranormal detective story that feels like a different movie.Keaton looks weary to the point of boredom, the rest of the cast react rather than act, while the filmmakers just keep shoving them back into the middle of a no-win boxing match.",3,CROSSED SIGNALS,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2664,"['Talk', 'getting', 'signals', 'crossed.In', 'White', 'Noise', 'latest', 'Hollywood', 'dead', 'wife', 'reclamation', 'project', 'Dragonfly', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'architect', 'angelic', 'internationally', 'renowned', 'author', 'wife', 'cute', 'pre-precocious', 'five-year-old', 'son', 'seemingly', 'plastic', 'picture-perfect', 'life.Since', 'White', 'Noise', 'horror-thriller', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Rivers', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'not', 'writer', 'Niall', 'Johnson', 'director', 'Geoffrey', 'Sax', 'hammer', 'home', 'how', 'much', 'man', 'plan', 'lose', 'guess', 'were', 'hoping', 'bigger', 'set-up', 'would', 'provide', 'bigger', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'anyone', 'ticket', 'tucked', 'pocket', 'better', 'family', 'real', 'engaging', 'para-normally', 'challenged', 'Freeling', 'Poltergeist', 'set-up', 'waste', 'time.After', 'offering', 'extended', 'portrait', 'Rivers', 'family', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'rude', 'awakening', 'Wife', 'Anna', 'Chandra', 'West', 'missing', 'Time', 'days', 'then', 'weeks', 'Then', 'more', 'bad', 'news', 'body', 'found', 'Jonathan', 'son', 'alone', 'put', 'back', 'pieces', 'shattered', 'lives', 'move', 'away', 'hoping', 'find', 'peace', 'serenity', 'Jonathan', 'static', 'Literally.He', 'interference', 'power', 'lines', 'stranger', 'better', 'Jonathan', 'static', 'also', 'known', 'White', 'Noise', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'dead', 'communicate', 'living', 'Skeptical', 'Jonathan', 'stranger', 'series', 'events', 'lead', 'believe', 'wife', 'trying', 'make', 'connection', 'Hope', 'have', 'roaming', 'charges', 'calling', 'plan', ""n't"", 'have', 'touch', 'reach', 'someone', 'dead', 'option.Pretty', 'soon', 'Jonathan', 'believer', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'obsessively', 'invests', 'trying', 'contact', 'wife', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'phenomenon', 'including', 'bookstore', 'owner', 'Sarah', 'Tate', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'who', 'contact', 'dead', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'only', 'time', 'been', 'stiff', 'Viagra.Bad', 'joke', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'almost', 'cue', 'Poltergeist', 'Spirits', 'communicating', 'static', 'electronic', 'appliances', 'Poltergeist', 'protagonist', 'ultimately', 'realizing', 'static', 'also', 'presence', 'evil', 'spirits', 'Poltergeist', 'When', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'done', 'scrap', 'mining', 'Poltergeist', 'turn', 'White', 'Noise', 'paranormal', 'detective', 'story', 'different', 'movie.Keaton', 'weary', 'point', 'boredom', 'rest', 'cast', 'react', 'rather', 'act', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'keep', 'shoving', 'back', 'middle', 'no-win', 'boxing', 'match']",White Noise

It never actually seemed like a true horror but more like a supernatural thriller, which came to mind that this could be more promising than those worthless horrors.Based on a man named Jonathan Rivers(Michael Keaton) whos wife dies in a  car accident. Upon this tragic event, Jonathan grieves for his wife and sooner hears of a man who claims that his wife has made contact with him from the after-life through EVP(Electronic Voice Phenomenon). Eventually after Keatons communications with his dead wife he begins to believe that these communications are some sort of warnings from his wife, which brings this EVP more of an obsession to him.The first thing that really caught my attention is when Keaton receives a phone call realising that it is coming from the phone of his dead wife. There wasnt anything actually scary about it but in terms of something chilling or spooky, it wasnt a bad attempt. The most interesting thing from the film was the events of EVP. It has a good deal of a chilling atmosphere within the unclear sounds and video recordings. Although this was only a success through the first half of the film.  When it comes to horrors, its what we do not see that scares us. Less is more is the phrase. This is where White Noise started to go a little down hill. The EVP sounds and video recordings began to reveal themselves to clearly letting the viewers know exactly what is being said or shown on screen. Although, some of the instant jump frights worked well in this movie. But the ending is a bit of a let-down, adding more with CGI, making even ghost images more solid. Sure it has its surprises, but it wasn't enough to make the ending feel more intense.Above all this, Keaton does give us a great performance throughout the film that kind of makes up for some of its flaws. Overall, it starts off decently but eventually goes a little downhill.

632563,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JNNT,Kevin Killian,"[0, 2]","I take it as an article of faith that WHITE NOISE the movie is in no way based on WHITE NOISE, the classic novel by Don De Lillo so many postmoderns adore, but Deborah Kara Unger is certainly acting as though she had never heard the news and is trying the best she can to give a reasonable screen interpretation of De Lillo's trademark disconnects and fleecy philosophy.  As she did in Cronenberg's CRASH, Unger steals the movie out from under her more expressive co-stars.  She's not ""sleepwalking"" as many critics affirm, indeed what she's doing is really the opposite of sleepwalking, whatever that might be.  She enters a scene all bristly like a beautiful, statuesque hedgehog, with every one of her sensory cells on high alert.  As she plays Sara, the bookstore owner whose fiance died eight months before, you wonder why the screenwriters didn't make the dead man her husband.  Why hold the line at ""fiance""?  Is it to encourage viewers into thinking that hey, maybe she didn't really love him, maybe she's ready to move on to assuage Michael Keaton's grief at losing his wife (played briefly by Chandra West).  She's become addicted to fat Raymond's EVP sessions in which she finally makes a breakthrough, realizing that the mumbled words her dead fiance was saying were ""Sara, yes.""Later Michael Keaton realizes that everyone who appears on the white noise broadcasts and podcasts was actually alive at the time their signals were being transmitted around the world, visible only to trained, or untrained, EVP readers.  That makes sense to me.  Does that mean that Sara's fiance had been filmed saying ""Sara, yes,"" while still alive?  And does that mean that the three tall shadowy figures had him murdered from beyond the grave?  With her tall, gaunt, utterly vulnerable and broad face, Unger manages to suggest all these plot points with but a single sideways look.  She's totally involved in her acting, and at the same time that pathetic glance seems to be pleading and remonstating with her agents, ""Let me out of here!""  You get the same doubleness of affect watching the later films of Marilyn Monroe, in which she always seems to be waiting for approval from someone to the side of the camera, Lee or Paula Strasberg perhaps, Svengalis to her poor Trilby.I've read dozens of comments from my other Amazon compatriots about this movie and no one has been able to decipher why Deborah Kara Unger a) takes that mysterious sleeping pill or b) changes her mind as soon as Michael Keaton leaves her bedroom to take a few aspirin.  She winds up on the railing of her balcony; narratologically speaking it's no surprise, but her doing so has no real motive in the plot unless you figure she's actually in cahoots with the real conspirators.  With a lesser actress, someone like, oh, say, Gwyneth Paltrow or Reese Witherspoon, she wouldn't have gone off the balcony at all.  She or her agents would have put their foot down right off and said, ""Michael Keaton hasn't made a movie in years, let him take the fall.""  But Unger gives everything to her art and for that reason alone she (and to a lesser degree the incomparable Chandra West) makes seeing WHITE NOISE a supreme lesson in the power of Thespis over the humdrum nothingness of Hollywood-funded Vancouver-based filmmaking.",4,Unger All The Way,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3288,"['take', 'article', 'faith', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', 'movie', 'way', 'based', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', 'classic', 'novel', 'Don', 'De', 'Lillo', 'so', 'many', 'postmoderns', 'adore', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'certainly', 'acting', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'news', 'trying', 'best', 'can', 'give', 'reasonable', 'screen', 'interpretation', 'De', 'Lillo', 'trademark', 'disconnects', 'fleecy', 'philosophy', 'did', 'Cronenberg', 'CRASH', 'Unger', 'movie', 'more', 'expressive', 'co-stars', 'not', 'sleepwalking', 'many', 'critics', 'affirm', 'indeed', 'what', 'doing', 'really', 'opposite', 'sleepwalking', 'might', 'be', 'scene', 'bristly', 'beautiful', 'statuesque', 'hedgehog', 'one', 'sensory', 'cells', 'high', 'alert', 'Sara', 'bookstore', 'owner', 'fiance', 'died', 'eight', 'months', 'wonder', 'why', 'screenwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'dead', 'man', 'husband', 'Why', 'hold', 'line', 'fiance', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'hey', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'maybe', 'ready', 'move', 'assuage', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'grief', 'losing', 'wife', 'played', 'briefly', 'Chandra', 'West', 'become', 'addicted', 'fat', 'Raymond', 'EVP', 'sessions', 'finally', 'breakthrough', 'realizing', 'mumbled', 'words', 'dead', 'fiance', 'was', 'saying', 'were', 'Sara', 'yes', 'Later', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'everyone', 'who', 'white', 'noise', 'broadcasts', 'podcasts', 'was', 'actually', 'alive', 'time', 'signals', 'were', 'being', 'transmitted', 'world', 'visible', 'only', 'trained', 'untrained', 'EVP', 'readers', 'sense', 'mean', 'Sara', 'fiance', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'saying', 'Sara', 'yes', 'still', 'alive', 'mean', 'three', 'tall', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'had', 'murdered', 'grave', 'tall', 'gaunt', 'utterly', 'vulnerable', 'broad', 'face', 'Unger', 'suggest', 'plot', 'points', 'single', 'sideways', 'look', 'totally', 'involved', 'acting', 'same', 'time', 'pathetic', 'glance', 'be', 'pleading', 'remonstating', 'agents', 'Let', 'here', 'get', 'same', 'doubleness', 'affect', 'watching', 'later', 'films', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'always', 'be', 'waiting', 'approval', 'someone', 'side', 'camera', 'Lee', 'Paula', 'Strasberg', 'perhaps', 'Svengalis', 'poor', 'Trilby.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'dozens', 'comments', 'other', 'Amazon', 'compatriots', 'movie', 'one', 'been', 'able', 'decipher', 'why', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'mysterious', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'b', 'mind', 'as', 'soon', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'bedroom', 'take', 'few', 'aspirin', 'up', 'railing', 'balcony', 'narratologically', 'speaking', 'surprise', 'doing', 'so', 'real', 'motive', 'plot', 'figure', 'actually', 'cahoots', 'real', 'conspirators', 'lesser', 'actress', 'someone', 'oh', 'say', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'off', 'balcony', 'agents', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'foot', 'down', 'right', 'said', 'Michael', 'Keaton', ""n't"", 'made', 'movie', 'years', 'let', 'take', 'fall', 'Unger', 'everything', 'art', 'reason', 'alone', 'lesser', 'degree', 'incomparable', 'Chandra', 'West', 'seeing', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', 'supreme', 'lesson', 'power', 'Thespis', 'humdrum', 'nothingness', 'Hollywood-funded', 'Vancouver-based', 'filmmaking']",White Noise

Actual EVP occurs when someone records voices of supposed dead people who are speaking from beyond.  This film tries to bank on that by combining the recordings with a murderous group of nasty spirits who use TVs, video, tapedecks, etc. to crossover and do some evil deeds.In the beginning of the film, Michael Keaton loses a loved one in an accident.  She in turn calls him the next night and leaves a message on his answering machine.  Then she does it again on the next night.  Soon, Keaton meets a gentleman who actually studies and logs numerous EVP recordings in an attempt to help those who've lost people.  Here's where my first question is.  How is listening or watching tapes of dead people help those who are grieving?  Keaton soon becomes engulfed in a sea of high-tech recording equipment and blows off his own son in an attempt to hear more recordings from the grave.Eventually, people begin to die off and Keaton becomes a suspect.  Once he figures out what is going on, he tries to become a sort of supernatural detective.  Instead of helping the grieving, he attempts to save those who are about to die.In the end,  things get a little murky and we never really learn who or what the killer or killers really are and why they are killing people.  The actual study of EVP is very interesting, but unfortunately Hollywood took a cool concept and threw it into a sloppily directed flick.In short, I'd keep this one as a rental or pay-per-view.

Trailers that were aired on TV before the release focused on the thrilling and frightful elements that generated an anticipation for horror, but in this regard the film truly disappoints.  This misleading anticipation for suspense affects the film's potential, as the viewers will receive drama-like venture of loss and connection with the other side.  Even if the audience is capable of adjusting to this curveball the film still suffers from awkwardness and cerebral congestion.The successful architect, Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton), seems to have it all, as he also finds out that he is about to get another addition to his family.  His stunning second wife Anna (Chandra West) is a prominent author with several best sellers and has just discovered that she is pregnant.  In joy Jonathan returns from work with flowers and chocolate, but Anna never returns home.  He waits for hours, until he eventually finds out that she is missing, which becomes headlines in the news.Out of the blue, a man, Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), in a Land Rover, follows Jonathan from his home to his job where he finds out that the man supposedly has had contact with his missing wife.  Raymond discloses that she is dead, and through Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP), he can hear and maybe see the dead.  However, like most sane men, Jonathan  disregards the man's plea to listen to him and turns him away.  After some strange occurrences, one of these scenes feels familiar from Takeshi Miike's One Missed Call (2003), Jonathan decides to contact Raymond.When Jonathan meets with Raymond at his cluttered home he also run into Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) who is trying to overcome the loss of her fianc&eacute;.  Through this introduction the film begins its journey into EVP, as Jonathan begins to find a way to contact his late wife through recordings on tapes and hard drives.  Through one of these attempts Jonathan encounters an angry and intimidating voice to which Raymond simply comments with some difficulty that some are bad people while erasing the voice from the hard drive.  It is evident that this is a crucial part of the film, but instead of enlightening the audience it keeps this darkness veiled to another moment.Throughout the film there are several moments where the audience will make loops with their eyes, as White Noise almost suggests that the audience is too dense to understand the series of occurrences.  Also, the borrowed quote by Thomas Edison in the beginning of the film suggests that the filmmakers try to use external sources to induce some form of authenticity to the story.  This, too, fails miserably and instead induces further awkwardness.  Lastly, Michael Keaton's character appears almost blinded to the point of stupidity, as he continues on his journey to find the truth and maybe more.  Well, let's put it this way, Jonathan will find more than he anticipated, but at the expense of making the film painful to watch.",2,Melodramatic Horror and What It Entails...,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,3040,"['White', 'Noise', 'possibility', 'create', 'horror', 'experience', 'never', 'Trailers', 'were', 'aired', 'TV', 'release', 'focused', 'thrilling', 'frightful', 'elements', 'generated', 'anticipation', 'horror', 'regard', 'film', 'truly', 'disappoints', 'misleading', 'anticipation', 'suspense', 'film', 'potential', 'viewers', 'will', 'receive', 'drama-like', 'venture', 'loss', 'connection', 'other', 'side', 'Even', 'audience', 'capable', 'adjusting', 'curveball', 'film', 'still', 'awkwardness', 'cerebral', 'congestion.The', 'successful', 'architect', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'have', 'also', 'out', 'get', 'addition', 'family', 'stunning', 'second', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Chandra', 'West', 'prominent', 'author', 'several', 'best', 'sellers', 'just', 'discovered', 'pregnant', 'joy', 'Jonathan', 'work', 'flowers', 'chocolate', 'Anna', 'never', 'home', 'hours', 'eventually', 'out', 'missing', 'headlines', 'news.Out', 'blue', 'man', 'Raymond', 'Price', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'Land', 'Rover', 'Jonathan', 'home', 'job', 'where', 'out', 'man', 'supposedly', 'had', 'contact', 'missing', 'wife', 'Raymond', 'dead', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'EVP', 'can', 'hear', 'maybe', 'see', 'dead', 'However', 'most', 'sane', 'men', 'Jonathan', 'man', 'plea', 'listen', 'away', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'one', 'scenes', 'feels', 'familiar', 'Takeshi', 'Miike', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', '2003', 'Jonathan', 'contact', 'Raymond.When', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'cluttered', 'home', 'also', 'run', 'Sarah', 'Tate', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'who', 'trying', 'overcome', 'loss', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'introduction', 'film', 'journey', 'EVP', 'Jonathan', 'find', 'way', 'contact', 'late', 'wife', 'recordings', 'tapes', 'hard', 'drives', 'one', 'attempts', 'Jonathan', 'angry', 'intimidating', 'voice', 'Raymond', 'simply', 'comments', 'difficulty', 'are', 'bad', 'people', 'erasing', 'voice', 'hard', 'drive', 'evident', 'crucial', 'part', 'film', 'instead', 'enlightening', 'audience', 'darkness', 'veiled', 'moment.Throughout', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'make', 'loops', 'eyes', 'White', 'Noise', 'almost', 'audience', 'too', 'dense', 'understand', 'series', 'occurrences', 'Also', 'borrowed', 'quote', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'beginning', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'use', 'external', 'sources', 'induce', 'form', 'authenticity', 'story', 'too', 'miserably', 'instead', 'induces', 'further', 'awkwardness', 'Lastly', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'character', 'almost', 'blinded', 'point', 'stupidity', 'journey', 'find', 'truth', 'maybe', 'more', 'Well', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'Jonathan', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'anticipated', 'expense', 'making', 'film', 'painful', 'watch']",White Noise
632566,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B00005JNNT,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[2, 3]","~ENDING SPOILER~White Noise is another one of many ""scary"" PG-13 movies to come out recently (i.e The Grudge, Darkness, The Forgotton,) most of which I haven't cared for. But I saw an interesting trailer for White Noise some months ago and decided this one might be worth checking out. As a kid, I remember being frightened by stories of EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon,) on shows like Sightings and the thought of it still freaks me out today. So I was instantly drawn to this idea of a scary movie.For the most part, White Noise was moderately scary and that's a lot more than I can say for movies like The Ring or The Grudge, which I didn't find scary at all. The movie has a slow start, but the scary scenes it does have come unexpectedly. This is probably the first scary PG-13 that has actually made me jump at a few parts. With movies like the The Grudge, I completely anticipated the next scene where the ghost would pop and scare everyone in the audience except me. White Noise actually caught me off guard a couple of times. Plus, the general idea behind the movie itself was creepy, because there are plenty of real life EVP happenings on record and if you have ever heard an actual sound wave of one, you know that it makes the hair on your neck stand up on end.Some things I didn't like about the movie. It did have a slow start. It almost got boring right before the first really scary part. I also found the climax to the movie a little confusing as far as storyline goes. I'm also kind of sick of seeing an ending where a CGI ghost that looks like black smoke attacks for the climax. It was almost a let down in the movie having a suspenseful buildup to the climax and end it with three computer generated ghosts freaking out indistinctly. Not a very scary ending.

632569,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNNT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","The point at which &quot;White Noise&quot; goes off track for me is when Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has bought into the whole idea of Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) and bought a whole lot of electronic equipment in an attempt to contact his dead wife, Anna (Chandra West).  He has been hearing brief phrases that he is convinced are coming from Anna.  Then, for the first time, Anna's image appears on his monitor in the white noise he has recorded.  Remember, this is the dead wife he has been so desperate to contact that he has been neglecting if not frightening their son, Mike (Nicholas Elia), with his obsessive behavior.  So what does Jonathan when he finally sees Anna's face?  He closes his eyes.Now, I would be afraid to blink because the woman I loved might disappear.  Closing my eyes would not be something that came to mind.  Of course, Jonathan does it because director Geoffrey Sax (&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;) needs to set up a &quot;BOO!&quot; moment.  If that requires the character to do something that does not make sense that is the least of his worries because the script by Niall Johnson has worst things in store.  Sax's direction makes the most out of what he has to work with to provide a general sense of creepiness, but it is the story rather than the directing or the acting that derails this one.The basic idea of trying to communicate with a loved one after they have passed on is a compelling one and has been for centuries.  The wrinkle is that the medium of communication is through the white noise provided by electronic devices.  The legitimacy for this approach is provided at the start of the film by no less an authority figure than Thomas Alva Edison, but horror fans are simply going to be thinking &quot;Poltergeist.&quot;  Of course more contemporary horror fans will be comparing &quot;White Noise&quot; to &quot;The Ring&quot; with its killer videotape and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in terms of seeing dead people.  However, when you get to the end of this 2005 film you will actually be thinking of films from a different genre, which is the final fatal mistake.From where &quot;White Noise&quot; starts where it ends up is about as far off course as I have seen a movie get in some time.  The final image of the film was adding insult to injury, although obviously that was not the intent.  The idea of grieving people grasping at the straw of EVP is a decent enough one for a film, and Jonathan in introduced to the phenomenon by Raymond Price (Ian NcNeice) and Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger), who are in similar situations. Then things start to go wrong.  A psychic screams a warning at Jonathan that he fails to heed, there are figures appearing on his monitor when he is not looking, and then people start getting hurt.  But in the end, the payoff is just wrong on so many levels that you have no choice but to be disappointed.",3,Interesting premise with a very disappointing payoff,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,2895,"['point', 'quot', 'White', 'Noise', 'quot', 'track', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'bought', 'whole', 'idea', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'EVP', 'bought', 'whole', 'lot', 'electronic', 'equipment', 'attempt', 'contact', 'dead', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Chandra', 'West', 'been', 'hearing', 'brief', 'phrases', 'convinced', 'are', 'coming', 'Anna', 'Then', 'first', 'time', 'Anna', 'image', 'monitor', 'white', 'noise', 'recorded', 'Remember', 'dead', 'wife', 'been', 'so', 'desperate', 'contact', 'been', 'neglecting', 'not', 'frightening', 'son', 'Mike', 'Nicholas', 'Elia', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'So', 'what', 'Jonathan', 'when', 'finally', 'Anna', 'face', 'eyes.Now', 'would', 'be', 'afraid', 'blink', 'woman', 'loved', 'might', 'disappear', 'Closing', 'eyes', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'came', 'mind', 'course', 'Jonathan', 'director', 'Geoffrey', 'Sax', 'quot', 'Tipping', 'Velvet', 'quot', 'set', 'up', 'quot', 'BOO', 'quot', 'moment', 'character', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'worries', 'script', 'Niall', 'Johnson', 'worst', 'things', 'store', 'Sax', 'direction', 'most', 'what', 'work', 'provide', 'general', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'story', 'rather', 'directing', 'acting', 'one.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'trying', 'communicate', 'loved', 'one', 'have', 'passed', 'compelling', 'one', 'been', 'centuries', 'wrinkle', 'medium', 'communication', 'white', 'noise', 'provided', 'electronic', 'devices', 'legitimacy', 'approach', 'provided', 'start', 'film', 'less', 'authority', 'figure', 'Thomas', 'Alva', 'Edison', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'simply', 'going', 'be', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Poltergeist.', 'quot', 'course', 'more', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'comparing', 'quot', 'White', 'Noise', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'killer', 'videotape', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'terms', 'seeing', 'dead', 'people', 'However', 'when', 'get', 'end', '2005', 'film', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'thinking', 'films', 'different', 'genre', 'final', 'fatal', 'mistake.From', 'where', 'quot', 'White', 'Noise', 'quot', 'where', 'up', 'far', 'off', 'course', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'get', 'time', 'final', 'image', 'film', 'was', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'obviously', 'was', 'not', 'intent', 'idea', 'grieving', 'people', 'grasping', 'straw', 'EVP', 'decent', 'enough', 'one', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'introduced', 'phenomenon', 'Raymond', 'Price', 'Ian', 'NcNeice', 'Sarah', 'Tate', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'who', 'are', 'similar', 'situations', 'Then', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'psychic', 'screams', 'warning', 'Jonathan', 'heed', 'are', 'figures', 'appearing', 'monitor', 'when', 'not', 'looking', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'getting', 'hurt', 'end', 'payoff', 'just', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'have', 'choice', 'be', 'disappointed']",White Noise

632573,A2SDNZ3QRXW9B5,B00005JNNT,Lost Soul Critic,"[1, 1]","'White Noise' is one of the more enjoyable movies about the preposterous notion of communicating with the dead that I've ever seen. I'm not a Michael Keaton fan (I don't dislike him either), so I almost passed this movie over. Wow! Am I glad I didn't. This film is gripping from the start. Keaton's performance is beyond what I knew he was capable of. Setting aside the eeriness of the movie, one is intrigued by the interaction of the characters. There's a lesson to be learned here too. Don't let the life you have pass you by while trying to hold on to what is no longer there. Keaton's character becomes so engrossed with attempting to communicate with a dead loved one, that he neglects the living people that are still there in his life. And who still need him to be there for them. As for the HD version of this film, it's stunning. The standard was very well done and I didn't expect to see much difference in picture quality. Although some people smirk at the demise of HD DVD, they need to understand something important. If it weren't for HD DVD, Blue-Ray would have not been invented. Don't believe me? Read the history of the formats. But it's all good I have a Blue-Ray player too. For instance HD DVD has always used VC-1 as it's encoding. Blue-Ray started out still using versions of MPEG. Most Blue-Ray movies now use VC-1 or equivalent, but; would they have had it not been the standard set first by their competitor? I feel that any movie which uses special effects benefits greatly from any type of Higher Definition discs. And 'White Noise' definitely does. If it is a movie you'll be watching repeatedly, and showing to others.

Yet, this film did initially grab my attention and for a while even gave me a real sense of creepy suspense. I found the spare, often high tech settings an original touch. Also, the slow tempo of the beginning works quite well; small but strange events are cleverly timed to highten suspense, without going all out on cheap scares. But eventually things get really going, and the promising start turns out to be a prelude to a banal and unconvincing plot. Even then, there are some very stylish and eerie touches - e.g. the subtle, almost imperceptible rush of three shadows away from the car crash site where Rivers is sent by his wife's ghost to do some rescue work. But then again, the whole idea of ghosts operating like some supernatural 911-slash-mafia strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The eventual disappointment of supernatural movies (as well as the antics of ""real"" spiritists, for that matter) is that the dead always seem so inexplicably concerned with the daily hassles of mortals. The final unraveling is far-fetched, unsatisfying, and leaves us with a plot-line full of holes. Furthermore, characters are undeveloped and unconvincing as people. They seem to exist merely as a function of the storyline. How exactly Rivers can afford to sit in front of his TV's for days on end without getting into trouble with his business partner, is beyond me. And while the whole idea of ghosts manifesting themselves through TV static noise may succeed in steering clear of the obvious ""Poltergeist"" associations, I do wonder why the dead would want to use this cumbersome medium when, as it turns out, they are quite capable of manifesting themselves physically. They can even turn on your stereo for you, and wrestle you to the floor! Well, there I go nitpicking... The skeptic mind however is stimulated by the fact that the DVD extra's try to sell off EVP (""Electronic Voice Phenomena"") and ghosts as scientific facts, and even entice you to try capturing your own ghosts at home. Well, in the end that may be a less disappointing endeavour than watching this movie. But seriously, in a world so full of empirically uninformed superstition and gullible people, I find such additions truly objectionable.All in all this is hardly worth your time.

This actually became a little irritating - there were so many scenes of him wallowing in sorrow, holding his head, sitting in the dark - it went on just a little too long, dulling the plot instead of enhancing it. Just when you think he might be getting beyond his tragic loss, he is approached by a paranormal researcher who is convinced that he heard his dead son's voice in the white noise of his TV. At first the lead character shrugs him off as a quack, but then things start to happen that can't be explained ... phone calls from his dead wife's cell phone, which is hidden in a drawer, things moving around without obvious cause ... finally he calls the paranormal researcher. With his new friend, through EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), he believes he can see and hear his wife speaking to him. EVP becomes an obsession to him. I won't say more lest I ruin the plot.You need to completely suspend belief for this movie.

Of course Jon is a little unnerved by this but the man insists he take his business card for when he's ready to listen to what he has to say.One night Jon gets a phone call from his wife's cell phone which happens to be sitting at home in a zip loc bag in a drawer at home. He rushes home and sure enough the phone is there. He gets another call while both phones are in his hands. ""Jonathon,"" he hears and it sounds just like Anna. Other weird things happen to him too. Usually around 2:30 a.m., the time when his wife died. Lights and TV's flicker, the radio gets interference.Jon finally decides he needs to meet with Ray who introduces him to the concept of white noise. Ray lost his son ten years earlier and he's been helping people listen to their loved ones through televisions ever since. Ray begins to teach Jon the gifts the white noise brings until something weird happens to him. Jon then takes up the obsession, buying numerous TVs and computer equipment looking for messages from Anna. Anna seems to be showing him others who need his help but there is always a darker voice crowding hers as well as darker images. Wherever she is, she isn't alone.The movie is dark and cryptic with a few scary make you jump scenes.

I did not know what I was letting myself in for, but I came away rather pleased with the experience and having enjoyed what I thought was a pretty good movie.I won't go over the plot yet again, as you can read that in other reviews and probably have already done so before now. I will just say that it was very creative using EVP as a premise for the movie, and the idea that dead people are like just like living people: not all of them are nice. It is a good question for those interested in contacting the dead: why should they all be nice, when some may have been complete you-know-whats in this life.Through movie, there is enough to make you jump, and despite my best efforts at not making a fool of myself, I jumped a lot. It is a hard movie to maintain a detached distance to. The pain that the main character goes through is gutsy and in-your-face with Keaton's style of intensity.

EVP's is not something made up, not a myth or scam, scientists, paranormal investigators have put recorders into empty deserted ""haunted locations"" where people have died, and then listened to it later to discover faint voices and words, not talking like we know it but sound waves, and energy, in which the dead, can contact through. I know there are many believers and non believers but i've seen the show GHOST-HUNTERS, and these guys are sorta like the real ghost busters but they are very skeptical and look for hard evidence, they basically go to disprove, not to jump to any conclusions of a haunting. Butt i've seen things on that show that gave me the creeps including strange evps of children, and a man's voice saying WE'RE NOT DEAD. Ths skeptics would say it's all fake but it's not. They get calls from people who experience phenominon and they go to investigate and the scariest episode was when they went to an old 18th century prison, where on the screen up in block 12, a grim reaper looking phantom appeared floating and then disappeared. It had a black cape, and a stick and it was only appeared for 3 seconds but it was the scariest thing i'd ever seen, and they said that was the only thing they ever captured on camera that would be actual evidence. I'm even a person that doesnt believe alot of things that people make up just for attention, but this was real. So back to the movie, this movie is not what evp's do, it waas obviously sensationalized and fictional, and it wasn't that good because it turned out to be something completely different. This movie is a joke when it comes to evp's. I use to be in a ghost hunting group and i am really into this stuff because it's fun and at like 3 in the morning we'd visit haunted locations and we were extremely lucky to be some of the very few to experience real phenonminon. We were relaxed, and open to the energy and we werent trippin out, and we have pictures of a phantom and it has a face and the body is wavy and all glowing, and a second one in the background. We sent it to a famous paranormal investigator, and we never heard from him maybe he stole it and made money off it, but his books have real aparition photos, and stories of hauntings. But it's not like the movies where you see ghosts as people floating in allyways and sh*t. Any murder or suicide that occurs the place will have that bad energy, and even lost souls can still linger if they believe they still have unfinished business, and suicdes dont mean a happy afterlife either. But dont pay any attention to this movie. The ending was weird and confusing, but i knew from the very beginning that his wife was murdered, and thats why her soul was lost and she felt there was something for her to do.",3,Not anything like I thought it would be...,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2782,"['am', 'stuff', 'real', 'EVP', 'not', 'something', 'made', 'up', 'not', 'myth', 'scam', 'scientists', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'have', 'put', 'recorders', 'empty', 'deserted', 'haunted', 'locations', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'then', 'listened', 'later', 'discover', 'faint', 'voices', 'words', 'not', 'talking', 'know', 'sound', 'waves', 'energy', 'dead', 'can', 'contact', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'believers', 'non', 'believers', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'GHOST-HUNTERS', 'guys', 'are', 'sorta', 'real', 'ghost', 'busters', 'are', 'very', 'skeptical', 'look', 'hard', 'evidence', 'basically', 'go', 'disprove', 'not', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'haunting', 'Butt', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'things', 'show', 'gave', 'creeps', 'including', 'strange', 'evps', 'children', 'man', 'voice', 'saying', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'DEAD', 'Ths', 'skeptics', 'would', 'say', 'fake', 'not', 'get', 'calls', 'people', 'who', 'experience', 'phenominon', 'go', 'investigate', 'scariest', 'episode', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'old', '18th', 'century', 'prison', 'where', 'screen', 'up', 'block', '12', 'grim', 'reaper', 'looking', 'phantom', 'appeared', 'floating', 'then', 'disappeared', 'had', 'black', 'cape', 'stick', 'was', 'only', 'appeared', '3', 'seconds', 'was', 'scariest', 'thing', 'i', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'captured', 'camera', 'would', 'be', 'actual', 'evidence', ""'m"", 'even', 'person', 'believe', 'alot', 'things', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'just', 'attention', 'was', 'real', 'So', 'back', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'evp', 'do', 'waas', 'obviously', 'sensationalized', 'fictional', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'joke', 'when', 'evp', 'use', 'be', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'group', 'i', 'am', 'really', 'stuff', 'fun', '3', 'morning', ""'d"", 'visit', 'haunted', 'locations', 'were', 'extremely', 'lucky', 'be', 'very', 'few', 'experience', 'real', 'phenonminon', 'were', 'relaxed', 'open', 'energy', 'werent', 'out', 'have', 'pictures', 'phantom', 'face', 'body', 'wavy', 'glowing', 'second', 'one', 'background', 'sent', 'famous', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'never', 'heard', 'maybe', 'stole', 'made', 'money', 'books', 'have', 'real', 'aparition', 'photos', 'stories', 'hauntings', 'not', 'movies', 'where', 'see', 'ghosts', 'people', 'floating', 'allyways', 'sh*t.', 'Any', 'murder', 'suicide', 'place', 'will', 'have', 'bad', 'energy', 'even', 'lost', 'souls', 'can', 'still', 'linger', 'believe', 'still', 'have', 'unfinished', 'business', 'suicdes', 'dont', 'mean', 'happy', 'afterlife', 'either', 'dont', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'weird', 'confusing', 'i', 'knew', 'very', 'beginning', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'thats', 'why', 'soul', 'was', 'lost', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'do']",White Noise

With 2005's ""White Noise"" the concept finally comes to the screen.Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has an ideal, stable life.  He's an architect and has just discovered that his wife, Anna (Chandra West), a popular author with a book about to be released, is pregnant.  Things take a drastic turn when Anna's abandoned vehicle is discovered but she has disappeared.Weeks pass without a clue to Anna's whereabouts.  Then one day, Jonathan is approached by Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), an expert on EVP who has been receiving messages from Anna.  Unconvinced at first, Jonathan then contacts Raymond when strange events begin to happen.Becoming more obsessed with what he's hearing, Jonathan begins to hear from a number of people from the other side including Anna who seems to give him messages regarding living people in life threatening situations.  But not everything Jonathan hears is good.  Will he learn about the more sinister messages before it's too late?There are a number of things I liked about ""White Noise"".  A story about Electronic Voice Phenomenon was interesting and original.  It seemed to explain EVP in a way that even if you were unfamiliar with it, you weren't completely lost to what was happening in the movie.The movie also had some excellent spooky moments.  One in particular is Jonathan receiving a call on his cell phone.  After realizing the call is from Anna's phone, he rushes home, opens a bag with her cell phone in it.  While he's holding her phone, his cell phone rings and guess which number pops up!""White Noise"" had a decent story and good pacing right until the last twenty or so minutes of the film.

To me, there is an even more fundamental issue, and that's tedium.  While White Noise is not all that brightly written or overly creepy, the biggest problem with the movie is it's generally boring.The story deals with a concept called EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena.  EVP occurs through the static of the radio or TV, where apparently the dead can send messages if you listen hard enough.  Michael Keaton plays a recent widower who starts listening after his wife dies.  It soon becomes an obsession and he neglects his son and his work as he tries to get a message from his dead wife.  Even when he starts running into sinister otherwordly forces, he is not deterred, especially as he realizes that the messages actually predict future events.This movie is an obvious cross between The Sixth Sense and The Ring, but it seems that the crossbreeding of these two films produced something that is basically lifeless.  The fault seems to lie with the direction, which paces the story rather slowly.  Michael Keaton is competent but bland, and in fact, there are few very interesting characters or situations.

I thought this movie was better than The Grudge and the suspense kept me interested in the movie almost the entire time. What really caught my attention about this movie was when I saw the commercial mentioning Ruth Baxter and how the dead can communicate with us through EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon). Sadly to say the commercial was misleading since this movie did not go very far in to the EVP pheomomenon. White Noise got bad reviews from many critics but despite the negativity it did a great job the first weekend of its release opening in a very immpresive #2 with 24 Million dollars.

Not everything is going to be massivly deep and arty and unpredictable. Not to say that White Noise is a shallow film, cuz it definatly isnt shallow. This movie's strength lyes in its mood and emotion and its topic alone is very deep witnin itself for sure.In short, its about a man who loses a loved one, and is introduced to communication with the dead, and many things accure the more he delves into this phenomona.Anyways, i skiped this movie in the theaters becouse i didnt think it recieved a lot of good reviews by critics, but i saw it on dvd a while ago and i ended up really interested in the EVP idea in the film (Thats an actual phenomona that people research regarding communication with deceased people or spirts.This might of not got any accolades, but ya know a movie did its job when it has you researching its topic afterwards, not too mention the fact that, to me, it was genuinly scary, and it didnt need any gore or extreme violance to do so, which is commendable.I was impressed and even moved by all of what the dvd of this movie offered. Its special features are some of the best special features i ever seen on a dvd. I actually feel the special features are just as essential to watch as the film itself, it goes hand in hand.So, i finally got to buy this movie at the store, and im glad i did, becouse the film is thought provoking and very creepy; along with special features that are real fascinating and interesting, very informative and  even usefull, if you can believe that. The dvd has a lot of value i think, becouse those special features really make the movie worth buying.You get actual featurettes on the whole EVP thing, which actual EVP specialists and organization. And one that takes you on an investigation of 3 or so locations to communicate. They show you the process of recording and play back the actually stuff they picked up, its very interesting and makes you think and wonder.  Lastly , they have a how to  feature that shows you basicly all you need to start recording EVP yourself, which you might find surprisingly affordable and user friendly and practical.Not to mention theres a commentary with Michael Keaton and someone else, which is cool.If youre at all interested in the super natural, this film can be found on Amazon for such a bargon price, its definatly worth buying i think. The special features little bonus that i actually liked and dont over look.The acting and storyline/screen play get the job done, pretty average; though the idea behind the film is strong. Its a creepy movie that makes me a little freaked out to walk around my house in the dark, and ive watched Silence Of The Lambs, and that didnt bug me afterwards, as far as its effect it had. Though im not comparing the two films in any way shape or form.Get a very good deal on this movie and buy it and remember the special features, defiantly worth watching too.",3,Award winning thriller??

However, I decided not to watch this movie in the theatres because of the bad reviews I was hearing on it. So now that the DVD is out, I finally saw it and was glad that I didn't spend my money at the cinemas for watching it.Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has the perfect life. He has a good job and a wonderful family, with his wife Anna (Chandra West) and son Mike (Nicholas Elia). But things take a drastic turn when Anna is reported dead in a car accident. Six months later, Joanthan is still mourning over her. One day, he notices a man stalking him outside his home and work and confronts him. The man introduces himself as Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) and tells Jonathan that Anna contacted him from the other side. Jonathan gets irritated and ignores him, thinking the man is crazy. However, he receives a call from Anna's cell phone, and hears her voice on his machine, even though her cell phone is with him. Having changed his mind and now a believer, Jonathan goes back to Raymond, who introduces him to Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger), another person trying to contact the dead. Raymond tells Jonathan about E.V.P, Electronic Voice Phenomenon: a process by which the dead contact him through the static in television. He records them so that he can understand their messages more accurately. He puts a taping of Anna and Jonathan but Jonathan is unable to decipher the message. After a few days, Raymond is suddenly killed, the reason unknown. So now Jonathan buys a lot of equipment and is determined to find out what his wife was trying to convey him. But will he be able to stop the 3 strange figures that are watching his every move?This movie tries to be a suspenseful thriller, and somewhat succeeds to a certain point. However, there are far too many things left unexplained after watching the movie, which makes you feel like you have just wasted your time. For example:-> Who are these creatures? Till the end scene, we do not find out who these three mysterious figures are or what their purpose is. Come on, being the integral components of the movie, don't you think we should at least know what they are called?-> Why were they after Anna? Towards the end (possible spoiler here), the guy says that they told him to get Anna. What did Anna do anyway? I mean, aren't those creatures supposed to come after those who meddle with contacting the dead? Anna was not doing any such thing, and even if she was, they should have mentioned it in the movie somewhere.-> And finally, WHO was that guy in the first place and why did the creatures ask him to do their dirty work?This movie could have been much better, had they just made it a better ending. Its one thing for a movie to leave the audience in suspense at the end (like `The Blair Witch Project'), but it's another thing not to give the audience any clue whatsoever as to what is going on!Anyway, coming to the cast and crew, director Geoffrey Sax did a good job in directing this movie. I mean, considering the writers for this movie went haywire towards the end, Sax maintained the suspense of the movie. The cast including Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger did adequately for their roles. This DVD has the usual special features such as documentaries, deleted scenes etc. to keep you entertained in the study of E.V.P.In conclusion, from some of the reviews that I have read here, people who are into E.V.P do not appreciate this movie because of some faults, and general horror/thriller fans like me will find this movie disappointing because of its weak ending. So, if you are really keen on watching this movie because you are a Keaton fan or something, I would suggest renting it before actually buying it.",3,A good start leading to a bad ending,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3781,"['was', 'intrigued', 'watch', 'White', 'Noise', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'However', 'decided', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'theatres', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', 'hearing', 'So', 'now', 'DVD', 'out', 'finally', 'saw', 'was', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'cinemas', 'watching', 'it.Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'perfect', 'life', 'good', 'job', 'wonderful', 'family', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Chandra', 'West', 'son', 'Mike', 'Nicholas', 'Elia', 'things', 'take', 'drastic', 'turn', 'when', 'Anna', 'reported', 'dead', 'car', 'accident', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'Joanthan', 'still', 'mourning', 'One', 'day', 'man', 'stalking', 'home', 'work', 'confronts', 'man', 'Raymond', 'Price', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'Jonathan', 'Anna', 'contacted', 'other', 'side', 'Jonathan', 'irritated', 'thinking', 'man', 'crazy', 'However', 'call', 'Anna', 'cell', 'phone', 'voice', 'machine', 'even', 'cell', 'phone', 'Having', 'changed', 'mind', 'now', 'believer', 'Jonathan', 'back', 'Raymond', 'who', 'Sarah', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'person', 'trying', 'contact', 'dead', 'Raymond', 'Jonathan', 'E.V.P', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'process', 'dead', 'contact', 'static', 'television', 'so', 'can', 'understand', 'messages', 'more', 'accurately', 'taping', 'Anna', 'Jonathan', 'Jonathan', 'unable', 'decipher', 'message', 'few', 'days', 'Raymond', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'reason', 'unknown', 'So', 'now', 'Jonathan', 'lot', 'equipment', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wife', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stop', '3', 'strange', 'figures', 'are', 'watching', 'move', 'movie', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'somewhat', 'certain', 'point', 'However', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'left', 'unexplained', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'wasted', 'time', 'example', '>', 'Who', 'are', 'creatures', 'Till', 'end', 'scene', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'three', 'mysterious', 'figures', 'are', 'what', 'purpose', 'Come', 'being', 'integral', 'components', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'least', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'called', '>', 'Why', 'were', 'Anna', 'end', 'possible', 'spoiler', 'here', 'guy', 'told', 'get', 'Anna', 'What', 'did', 'Anna', 'do', 'anyway', 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'creatures', 'supposed', 'come', 'who', 'meddle', 'contacting', 'dead', 'Anna', 'was', 'not', 'doing', 'such', 'thing', 'even', 'was', 'should', 'have', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'somewhere.-', '>', 'finally', 'WHO', 'was', 'guy', 'first', 'place', 'why', 'did', 'creatures', 'ask', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'made', 'better', 'ending', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'leave', 'audience', 'suspense', 'end', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'thing', 'not', 'give', 'audience', 'clue', 'whatsoever', 'what', 'going', 'Anyway', 'coming', 'cast', 'crew', 'director', 'Geoffrey', 'Sax', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'mean', 'considering', 'writers', 'movie', 'went', 'haywire', 'end', 'Sax', 'maintained', 'suspense', 'movie', 'cast', 'including', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Chandra', 'West', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'did', 'adequately', 'roles', 'DVD', 'usual', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'documentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'keep', 'entertained', 'study', 'E.V.P.In', 'conclusion', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'E.V.P', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'faults', 'general', 'horror/thriller', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'weak', 'ending', 'So', 'are', 'really', 'keen', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'Keaton', 'fan', 'something', 'would', 'suggest', 'renting', 'actually', 'buying']",White Noise

Lastly there was that psychic.As Keaton sat there at the start of the reading,she was giving out generalities anyone could have regurgitated.Keatons wife's disappearance was front page news and on TV,so chances are this psychic would also have known him.I thought she did.But the plot line says we have to believe she knew nothing of his wife.That's not easily swallowed.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp,for those with analog TVS like me.Extras include commentary,and three featurettes on real life EVP experiences and making your own.All in all not a bad film,nor a great one.Just an average to above average scary movie about the EV phenomenon.There are scary moments and the film tries to build up some intensity but it never amounts to too much.Recommended.",3,"3 -3 1/2 stars.Interesting with some scary parts,but overall,pedestrian.",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,5129,"['White', 'Noise', 'released', 'Jan/05', 'was', 'first', 'film',

632609,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JNNT,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","White Noise (Geoffrey Sax, 2005)Michael Keaton took some time off from the movie world, having appeared in only four films since the career disaster that was Jack Frost. White Noise marks his return to full-time cinema, and to be honest, we should probably have known what to expect, given that he's coming out with a Herbie: The Love Bug movie later this year.Geoffrey Sax (Tipping the Velvet) makes the leap from small screen to big screen here. Some people understand what it taken to move from TV directing to movie directing. Sax does not, which does have the benefit of ensuring that White Noise will make for a good DVD rental. Save your money where theatres are concerned, though, as thirty-six-foot-wide screens do nothing to enhance what charms this movie has.The film, which plays out in the trailers as an edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller, is actually about Jonathan Rivers (Keaton), an architect whose wife disappears one night and is presumed dead. Keaton has to adjust to life without her, and in the process of doing so, becomes obsessed with trying to contact her spirit. Which, when it comes right down to it, is your basic Lifetime Original Movie, except that the star is male and it has a supernatural element to it. The first hour contains very little in the way of actual suspense, though there's a baldly manufactured subplot meant, I assume, to inspire some.The suspense shows up in the last half-hour, and to be fair, the movie does contain a few moments of genuine creepiness. Sax, however, is incapable of sustaining it for longer than a moment at any one time, leaving the viewer with an odd, slow-motion version of the feeling one gets when watching a generic slasher flick. You jump, kind of, for thirty seconds instead of an instant.It's a watchable movie, but not much more than that. The trailers and TV ads call it ""the most disturbing movie in years."" Sorry, guys, it's not even the most disturbing American movie in years. Overseas, there have been comedies more disturbing than this.

632610,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B00005JNNT,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[2, 4]","I viewed ""White Noise"" on DVD, which was probably a mistake because the disc's ""Bonus Features"" completely destroyed whatever shred of believability the movie had created...but more about that in a moment.The essential plot, the notion that the dead can and do communicate through electronic media, is catchy.  The problem is that the screenwriters never settle on precisely what they want to do with the idea.  In the opening message, Thomas Edison is quoted on the notion of electronically recording communications from the dead.  So we go in with at least the idea that all this might be within the realm of the possible.  Thus, when Michael Keaton's character hears the first contact from his dead wife, amid all the static the viewer's reaction is, ""OK...I'll buy that.""But then ""other"" spirits begin to appear and they're apparently not so nice.  ""OK,"" you say, ""I'll but into that too.""  Keaton is even warned by a spiritualist (who claims YEARS of ""training"" as the authority she has to muck with the dead.  Exactly where DOES one ""train"" for this sort of thing?  Is there a diploma involved?)that he is messing with forces he does not understand.  We even get to see these spirits...sort of an Unholy Trinity.  The first time we see them, they're creepy.  By the fifth time you see them, they evoke the Ghostly Trio who used to co-star in Casper comic books.  By the end, I took to calling them Moe, Larry and Curly.  Completely overdone, they completely lose their effect.Meanwhile, thing really go off track when these nasty spirits ""apparently"" kill one of Keaton's friends, somehow ""apparently"" cause another to jump off a balcony, and then ""apparently"" trash Keaton's home.  Who are these spooks? Why do they do these things?  HOW do they do these things? We're never told.Worse yet, Keaton now seems to be getting messages NOT from the dead, but from the about-to-be-dead.  Whoa!  This is a different movie entirely.  Now it is about Keaton saving people from certain doom.  Normal people might run in the opposite direction, but Keaton has been Batman, so he boldly goes where the rest of us wouldn't.Coming about 2/3 into the movie, an abduction sets up the ending and Keaton's last mission to save a victim.  Sadly, the wrap-up of the film is an absolute mess, with several different plot threads and notions all tossed together in a completely incoherent mish-mash. While the viewer is busy screaming ""Wait a minute,"", the film ends with the information that thousands of people record these messages, but that 1 in 12 of the messages is of a threatening nature.  ""OK,"" you think.  ""NOT a well done movie, but something creepy to think about. (Keaton is excellent, by the way, even if the material is weak)It was at this point that the DVD's bonus features ruined everything.  The DVD contains three small features...a ""documentary"" about Electronic Voice Phenomenon, or EVP, (recording the dead), a set of interviews with people who actually spend their time (and money) doing this, AND a nifty little bit on recording the dead in your hown home!  Hey, how about that for a great idea?  The problem is that these people are pathetic and laughable.  They are EXACTLY the sort of day-time TV addict, Wal-Mart refugees you'd EXPECT to be into this sort of stuff....ESPECIALLY when you learn that they all seem to have lost a child.  Hello?  Can anyone here spell I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N  R-U-N  W-I-L-D??In the end, the movie tries hard to get us to believe in an essentially unbelievable concept...and then the bonus features tell us to forget the whole thing because it is all nonsense and its adherents are all nuts who really need to get a life.",1,In need of serious fine tuning,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,3664,"['viewed', 'White', 'Noise', 'DVD', 'was', 'probably', 'mistake', 'disc', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'shred', 'believability', 'movie', 'had', 'created', 'more', 'moment.The', 'essential', 'plot', 'notion', 'dead', 'can', 'do', 'communicate', 'electronic', 'media', 'catchy', 'problem', 'screenwriters', 'never', 'settle', 'precisely', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'idea', 'opening', 'message', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'quoted', 'notion', 'electronically', 'recording', 'communications', 'dead', 'go', 'least', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'realm', 'possible', 'Thus', 'when', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'character', 'first', 'contact', 'dead', 'wife', 'static', 'viewer', 'reaction', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'then', 'other', 'spirits', 'begin', 'appear', ""'re"", 'apparently', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'OK', 'say', ""'ll"", 'too', 'Keaton', 'even', 'warned', 'spiritualist', 'who', 'YEARS', 'training', 'authority', 'muck', 'dead', 'Exactly', 'where', 'DOES', 'one', 'train', 'sort', 'thing', 'there', 'diploma', 'involved', 'messing', 'forces', 'not', 'understand', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'spirits', 'sort', 'Unholy', 'Trinity', 'first', 'time', 'see', ""'re"", 'creepy', 'fifth', 'time', 'see', 'evoke', 'Ghostly', 'Trio', 'who', 'used', 'co-star', 'Casper', 'comic', 'books', 'end', 'took', 'calling', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'Completely', 'overdone', 'completely', 'lose', 'effect.Meanwhile', 'thing', 'really', 'go', 'off', 'track', 'when', 'nasty', 'spirits', 'apparently', 'kill', 'one', 'Keaton', 'friends', 'somehow', 'apparently', 'cause', 'jump', 'off', 'balcony', 'then', 'apparently', 'trash', 'Keaton', 'home', 'Who', 'are', 'spooks', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'things', 'HOW', 'do', 'do', 'things', ""'re"", 'never', 'told.Worse', 'yet', 'Keaton', 'now', 'be', 'getting', 'messages', 'NOT', 'dead', 'about-to-be-dead', 'Whoa', 'different', 'movie', 'entirely', 'Now', 'Keaton', 'saving', 'people', 'certain', 'doom', 'Normal', 'people', 'might', 'run', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Keaton', 'been', 'Batman', 'boldly', 'where', 'rest', ""wouldn't.Coming"", '2/3', 'movie', 'abduction', 'up', 'ending', 'Keaton', 'last', 'mission', 'save', 'victim', 'Sadly', 'wrap-up', 'film', 'absolute', 'mess', 'several', 'different', 'plot', 'threads', 'notions', 'tossed', 'together', 'completely', 'incoherent', 'mish-mash', 'viewer', 'busy', 'screaming', 'Wait', 'minute', 'film', 'information', 'thousands', 'people', 'record', 'messages', '1', '12', 'messages', 'threatening', 'nature', 'OK', 'think', 'NOT', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'something', 'creepy', 'think', 'Keaton', 'excellent', 'way', 'even', 'material', 'weak', 'was', 'point', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'ruined', 'everything', 'DVD', 'contains', 'three', 'small', 'features', 'documentary', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'EVP', 'recording', 'dead', 'set', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'spend', 'time', 'money', 'doing', 'nifty', 'little', 'bit', 'recording', 'dead', 'hown', 'home', 'Hey', 'how', 'great', 'idea', 'problem', 'people', 'are', 'pathetic', 'laughable', 'are', 'EXACTLY', 'sort', 'day-time', 'TV', 'addict', 'Wal-Mart', 'refugees', ""'d"", 'EXPECT', 'be', 'sort', 'stuff', '.ESPECIALLY', 'when', 'learn', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'child', 'Hello', 'Can', 'anyone', 'here', 'spell', 'I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N', 'R-U-N', 'W-I-L-D', 'end', 'movie', 'hard', 'get', 'believe', 'essentially', 'unbelievable', 'concept', 'then', 'bonus', 'tell', 'forget', 'whole', 'thing', 'nonsense', 'adherents', 'are', 'nuts', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'life']",White Noise

632615,A3TPJOEN2CVO36,B00005JNNT,S. A. Felton,"[3, 3]","I had really wanted to see this movie in the theater when it came out because I am fascinated by how humans react to and cope with death, though I am not really into EVP. I didn't see ""White Noise"" because it was so soundly trashed by the critics. Fortunately there was a ""recommended"" sign at the rental store, and I trust the people there, so I rented the DVD.I liked the movie so much I am on my second viewing, this time with the commentary, which I *never* do. Of the ""mainstream"" reviews (newspapers, magazines) I read before and after seeing the movie, as well as ""user"" comments, I definitely get the impression that the writers want nothing to do with the subject of death, and thus they probably didn't watch the movie with an open mind, assuming they even bothered to watch it carefully. That's tragic - they can rant and rave over Keaton in ""Batman,"" but when he's in a movie with a far more meaningful and sensitive topic (in my opinion), it's no good, and I am convinced it's because of the movie's subject. Yes, it's really a shame that a movie which covers a complex issue like death and trying to communicate with the other side through mechanical means is dismissed so unfairly. And to make comparisons between this book and the best-selling novel ""White Noise,"" as was done by the NYTimes reviewer, is simply beyond belief and shows a staggering amount of ignorance.""White Noise"" is a ""horror"" movie. People die in tragic, unfair circumstances (let's not get into ""karma"" here, and the movie doesn't get into karma either). Lives are ruined, and yet there is some salvation in attempting to communicate with the deceased, even through EVP machines and techniques. In ""White Noise"" there are great though obviously eerie successes using EVP, and I found the elaborate and complex arrays of machines depicted to be quite believable and realistic, and for those who are interested in trying EVP the DVD has extras which provide very basic and simple techniques for doing EVP.Without giving the plot away, the reader of this review probably knows at least that someone close to Keaton's character (his wife) dies. After some time and through some believable and well-done scenes, he becomes very (obsessively) interested in communicating with his wife using EVP. To show another aspect of the subject, the movie has a scene where he goes to a (blind) psychic who demonstrates ""non-mechanical"" communication with the other side and is strongly opposed to EVP, but Keaton's character persists.Further to the movie-makers credit, ""White Noise"" goes far beyond its basic theme of communicating with the dead through EVP. After Keaton begins communicating with his wife, she unexpectedly provides him with information that helps him aid people in this world. And yet this ""positive"" side of the movie is again done with subtlety and complexity, showing that even a beneficent twist to the horror has a down side precisely because of the overall macabre death theme.I find these plot complexities quite pleasing, and I disagree with those who want to know exactly what the movie is trying to present, exactly what the plot is in every scene. I like movies that make us think, ponder, and consider different possibilities, and for that reason I would give the script writer an A, easily. Add to that mostly excellent, realistic performances, on great Vancouver sets, and you have a fine movie, with the caveat that you have to have some interest in (and not be too fearful of) the topic of death and after-life communication.",4,Tragically underrated movie,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,3533,"['had', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'am', 'fascinated', 'how', 'humans', 'react', 'cope', 'death', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'EVP', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'White', 'Noise', 'was', 'so', 'soundly', 'trashed', 'critics', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'recommended', 'sign', 'rental', 'store', 'trust', 'people', 'there', 'rented', 'DVD.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'second', 'viewing', 'time', 'commentary', '*never*', 'do', 'mainstream', 'reviews', 'newspapers', 'magazines', 'read', 'seeing', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'user', 'comments', 'definitely', 'get', 'impression', 'writers', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'subject', 'death', 'thus', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'assuming', 'even', 'bothered', 'watch', 'carefully', 'tragic', 'can', 'rant', 'rave', 'over', 'Keaton', 'Batman', 'when', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'meaningful', 'sensitive', 'topic', 'opinion', 'good', 'am', 'convinced', 'movie', 'subject', 'Yes', 'really', 'shame', 'movie', 'complex', 'issue', 'death', 'trying', 'communicate', 'other', 'side', 'mechanical', 'means', 'dismissed', 'so', 'unfairly', 'make', 'comparisons', 'book', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'White', 'Noise', 'was', 'done', 'NYTimes', 'reviewer', 'simply', 'belief', 'staggering', 'amount', 'ignorance', 'White', 'Noise', 'horror', 'movie', 'People', 'die', 'tragic', 'unfair', 'circumstances', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'karma', 'here', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'karma', 'Lives', 'are', 'ruined', 'yet', 'salvation', 'attempting', 'communicate', 'deceased', 'even', 'EVP', 'machines', 'techniques', 'White', 'Noise', 'are', 'great', 'obviously', 'eerie', 'successes', 'using', 'EVP', 'found', 'elaborate', 'complex', 'arrays', 'machines', 'depicted', 'be', 'quite', 'believable', 'realistic', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'trying', 'EVP', 'DVD', 'extras', 'provide', 'very', 'basic', 'simple', 'techniques', 'doing', 'EVP.Without', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'reader', 'review', 'probably', 'least', 'someone', 'close', 'Keaton', 'character', 'wife', 'time', 'believable', 'well-done', 'scenes', 'very', 'obsessively', 'interested', 'communicating', 'wife', 'using', 'EVP', 'show', 'aspect', 'subject', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'blind', 'psychic', 'who', 'non-mechanical', 'communication', 'other', 'side', 'strongly', 'opposed', 'EVP', 'Keaton', 'character', 'persists.Further', 'movie-makers', 'credit', 'White', 'Noise', 'far', 'basic', 'theme', 'communicating', 'dead', 'EVP', 'Keaton', 'communicating', 'wife', 'unexpectedly', 'information', 'aid', 'people', 'world', 'yet', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'again', 'done', 'subtlety', 'complexity', 'showing', 'even', 'beneficent', 'twist', 'horror', 'down', 'side', 'precisely', 'overall', 'macabre', 'death', 'theme.I', 'find', 'plot', 'complexities', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'disagree', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'present', 'exactly', 'what', 'plot', 'scene', 'like', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'ponder', 'consider', 'different', 'possibilities', 'reason', 'would', 'give', 'script', 'writer', 'A', 'easily', 'Add', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'realistic', 'performances', 'great', 'Vancouver', 'sets', 'have', 'fine', 'movie', 'caveat', 'have', 'have', 'interest', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'fearful', 'topic', 'death', 'after-life', 'communication']",White Noise

I saw comments that noted so-called plot holes before seeing the movie, and I still do not see any of the so called plot holes mentioned in the editorial.This film is well constructed, and done with an exactness and economy that is impressive.After listening to the commentary, its because the director is a BBC  alumni. The commentary is not advertised on the box at all, nor on any extras details that I am aware of. I would have given the film 5 stars if it were not for the fact that because of a DVD  production mess up, Keaton had to leave 15 minutes before the film's end for him to go on a holiday. Whilst the commentary is not the greatest, it does make the key point that this film was forced into a PG-13 rating by the makers of the film cutting some of the key scenes. The studios are getting way too much influence from the right wing Neo-Cons.Anyways, the extras are great.

With freshly-pregnant wife and son (by another woman) leading The Perfect Life{ ...beep .... beep ....beep. it's a telegraph, sir, things are about to go downhill }UNTILhis wife dies and her body washes up days later by an old pier on the water.We are sad. John is sad.John is soon contacted by an aficionado of ""EVP"" - within the narrative world of White Noise, a world that is like our aniseptic, scientific world, we learn that the dead can leave traces of their voices and likeness on the electromagnetically sensitive recording media of our modern times. This phenomenon, EVP (electronic voice phenomenon), allows a living person to commune with the dead.Now this is an interesting setup, it's a re-hash of the Faustianbargain: man, ever hungry for forbidden power and knowledge makes the deal with the man at the crossroads who casts no shadow (Robert Johnson mythos, Faust, many-a Lovecraft protagonist) and begins toexperience the exultation of this power / knowledge.In White Noise, Johnathan is able to communicate with hisdeceased wife via EVP and thus the Faustian bargain takes itsinevitable turn into the ""unintended consequences"" (see ""The Monkey's Paw"") realm. It's not long before his monkey's paw, er,  hobby starts doing its corrupting work - compelling Johnathan to choose between living in an artificial world (communing with the dead with this high-tech Ouija board) or doing the hard work of ""getting over it"" and living in our world.Now, this could have been a very interesting bit of drama - you mustovercome loss by moving beyond, by growing, by challenging - not byseeking a spiritual salve in the disembodied voices from the beyond. Everyone who endures the death of a loved one (""To love is to bury"" sayeth the Cowboy Junkies) faces flights of fancy into the supernatural and then faces the intractable truth of mortality. The movie works in this general direction but then...then....then....it completely blows it{...spoilers below, you may want to cut out if you plan on seeingthis...}The story blows it because all of a sudden the menacing spirits mixedin on the tapes solidify and attack John.Now wait, we were in a scientific world, not the horror-worlds ofNightmare on Elm Street or Poltergeist where weaccept that supernatural menace can physically hurt us -- no, EVP wasa phenomenon of our ""modern"" world - an unintended and menacing sideeffect from the beyond. They don't physically hurt us, they conquer us from our psyche out (much scarier!) - what the hell is this curve ball!?The screetwriters totally messed this up!

Instead of John's unrelling into madness courtesy of hisobsession with EVP or his personal triumph over this crutch -but instead the screenwriters get lazy and basically give up.This is my principal reason for why White Noise was a badmovie.

I don't know if other reviewers jaded me or whether I thought this might be a cheap horror flick or maybe both, but I didn't think this film would be very good, so I waited for it to come out on video and rented it.  At a mild PG-13 rating my whole family could watch this little chiller that was creatively directed, convincingly acted by Keaton, who was long overdue for some serious recognition as a dramatic actor (check him out in the outstandingClean and Sober), and the script, while faulty at times, goes down rather easily.  There are some genuinely scary moments in ""White Noise"", but much focus is on the eerie atmoshere and unfolding mystery of the story.  I liked this film very much for the same reasons why I likedThe Ring (Widescreen Edition)andThe Grudge.I have always enjoyed horror flicks that rely more on atmosphere, story, and acting, than actual on screen violence and gore even though I have gotten a kick out of a few of those (Night of the Living Dead,Suspiria).

This one looked good and it is good.The story is very intriguing as Michael Keaton's character, Jonathan Rivers, tries to make contact with his recently deceased wife. Along the way, she finally makes contact with him; but she is giving him flashes into the future about people who may die unless he can save them before hand. But it is not without consequence. Three demons are out to get anyone who uses EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) equipment to try and make contact to the other side. The ending was the biggest and most surprising part about the film. I never expected it to end the way it did. I will say no more than that for I don't want to spoil it for those who have yet to see it.Many people say there are plot holes in the film. Personally, I didn't find any so I don't know if those people just didn't seem to pay close attention or what.Now the biggest question many of you may be asking is whether or not the film is scary. Well, it gives you several jumpy moments, but the film is more creepy than scary considering the fact that there are people out there who make contact with the dead and, as the film states, 1 our of every 12 are physically threatened. So it's something to chew on. Not to mention that such events can very well take place. So, while there were a couple of jump scenes, it was just more creepy.The acting and special effects are very well done and it saddens me that Keaton is not in anymore respectable roles considering he is a talented actor. Of course that depends on your own assumption of his acting skills but I find him to be talented.In conclusion, White Noise is a film that is very interesting to say the least and one that is more creepy than scary. The story unfolds at a nice pace and there is hardly a dull moment. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a creepy flick or who is into suspense films in general.",4,A Better Film Than You May Realize,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2036,"['When', 'saw', 'previews', 'theaters', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'cheap', 'suspense', 'films', 'always', 'seem', 'pop-up', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'one', 'looked', 'good', 'good.The', 'story', 'very', 'intriguing', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'character', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'make', 'contact', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'way', 'finally', 'contact', 'giving', 'flashes', 'future', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'die', 'can', 'save', 'hand', 'not', 'consequence', 'Three', 'demons', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'anyone', 'who', 'EVP', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'equipment', 'try', 'make', 'contact', 'other', 'side', 'ending', 'was', 'biggest', 'most', 'surprising', 'part', 'film', 'never', 'expected', 'end', 'way', 'did', 'will', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'it.Many', 'people', 'say', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'what.Now', 'biggest', 'question', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'not', 'film', 'scary', 'Well', 'several', 'jumpy', 'moments', 'film', 'more', 'creepy', 'scary', 'considering', 'fact', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'contact', 'dead', 'film', 'states', '1', '12', 'are', 'physically', 'threatened', 'something', 'chew', 'Not', 'mention', 'such', 'events', 'can', 'very', 'well', 'take', 'place', 'So', 'were', 'couple', 'jump', 'scenes', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'creepy.The', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Keaton', 'not', 'anymore', 'respectable', 'roles', 'considering', 'talented', 'actor', 'course', 'own', 'assumption', 'acting', 'skills', 'find', 'be', 'talented.In', 'conclusion', 'White', 'Noise', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'creepy', 'scary', 'story', 'unfolds', 'nice', 'pace', 'hardly', 'dull', 'moment', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'creepy', 'flick', 'who', 'suspense', 'films', 'general']",White Noise

I was intrigued by the fat man's claim of being in contact with the dead wife. It felt a little rushed and unfinished even at that point because the wife's death sounded suspicious at first and then later cut and dried. Somehow she fell, hurt her head and broke her arm and was unable to escape a rising tide? Maybe I missed something. What was she doing there? Why didn't the husband try to rescue her sooner?Keaton has some scary moments when he's being contacted through the phone and various electronic devices. I was feeling chills and then it started to feel too much like they were trying to give me chills.Keaton becomes a big believer which seemed odd since he was a professional in the movie. More skepticism would have seemed likely. At this point in the movie I thought maybe Keaton was being taken advantage of. I even thought the lady who also claimed to have a break through was one of the fat man's confederates. Some sort of confidence scheme, but as it turned out everyone was sincere.Keaton is in love and yet he seems to be going through a series of other women in no time at all. I thought he was still grieving for his wife. Then someone ends up standing on railing several floors up while asleep. It just didn't make any sense at all except to impress us with the power of these shadowy things from the other side of the grave and then finally there's the ending which didn't make any sense at all to me even though I recognized the workman.I watched the ending again with commentary on to see if I could get some insight as to what they were going for. The first thing I noticed was how flat the director was. He talked about technical things, but he just didn't have the enthusiasm in explaining things that people who love their movies do. All I got out of him was that he was lucky to get a big abandoned department store for his ending when he originally wanted a house because Keaton was supposed to be an architect. The director was happy with the big setting because it allowed him more options in setting up cameras. The thing is it didn't help with the story at all. What was that? Having no info from the movie I decided the site was computer connection to hell, lol. I wondered if it was a cable hookup or just dialup. The workman who was supposed to be an unspeakably evil minion ended up being of such little importance that the cops dropped him after only five seconds on screen.The concept seemed promising enough, but the movie just didn't deliver.

The entire premise is absurd and unconvincing, and the ending is so amateurish that you are left shaking your head in disbelief. You are occasionally startled by a loud noise, but not once will you be truly frightened or convinced that any of this nonsense is even remotely real or possible.I generally love Michael Keaton and am a great fan of supernatural thrillers, but I was totally let down on both fronts. M.K. exudes not a single trace of the edgy charisma, humor, and intellect that usually distinguishes his performances. He (and we) spend what seems like hours and days looking at snowy screens and listening to indistinct static, with an occasional groan or whimper. Just to be sure, however, that we ignoramuses in the audience fully comprehend the grand significance of what is transpiring, occasionally the fuzzy images become completely distinct, the voices become very clear, all spooky subtlety is lost and we are essentially told what to think. There is no respect for the audience...but then again, if there were any, this movie would never have been released.The childish manipulation is obvious and very tiresome, but the worst insult is reserved for the truly lousy ending....lots of swirly, silly ghosts and loud noises that grate on our nerves rather than fears. I swear that I have seen Halloween plays at my daughter's grade school that were more suspenseful and displayed better plot and direction. This is an absolute bomb, and I don't mean that in a good way.The Special Features on the DVD consist mainly of a sweet little old couple running around deserted buildings with a $5 Radio Shack tape recorder saying things like ""Speak to us""....and of course, after they are allowed to ""privately process"" their recordings there are a few unusual beeps and squawks that are interpreted as long-dead souls attempting to communicate. Why these voices are audible only to the sweet little old couple's tape recorder and not our ears is never explained, nor why any ""processing"" is necessary....although I think we all know why it is.Please heed my warnings and avoid this turkey at all costs. It truly is just as bad as the critics said it was.....maybe even worse.

The film begins with an overview of the loving marriage between architect Jonathan (played by a bland Michael Keaton) and best-selling author Anna Rivers (Chandra West).  On one unfortunate night, Anna's vehicle is found empty on the side of a ridge and she is pronounced missing.  Not wanting to give up hope for his wife's survival, Jonathan insists that she is still alive until an odd stranger (Ian McNeice) informs him that his wife is dead-and he's been speaking to her.Jonathan learns about Electric Voice Phenomenon (EVP), which allows the dead to communicate with those who are still alive via the static of television, radio, and other electronic devices.  As Jonathan becomes more obsessed with the eccentric episodes within the next beyond, he realizes that his deceased wife is not only talking to him, but that she is directing him in ways that may save others.  With the help from fellow EVP enthusiast (Deborah Kara Unger), Jonathan makes it his personal endeavor to save the life of a missing woman who may or may not be dead.  As ""White Noise"" unfolds, director Geoffrey Sax and screenwriter Niall Johnson seem more content on providing atmospheric situations that make the audience jump instead of completing a cohesive thriller that actually makes sense.  There are many baffling questions that are not answered (why Jonathan receives these specific messages from the dead right at 2:30 a.m.; who are the three mysterious figures that continuously pop up on video surveillance, for example) and the creation of a sincere conflict between character and the ""other world"" is not tangible.

It's a subtle horror film.  A far cry from the more in your face shock value of many which may be one reason critics didn't like it.  Micheal Keaton plays a subdued Johnathan Rivers whose wife Anna, a famous author, disappears one day.  After several weeks, her body turns up in a river, where she apparently fell in an accident.Soon Jonathan finds himself by Raymond Price who claims to have received messages from Anna.  Jonathan thinks he's a crackpot until he starts receiving calls from Anna's cell phone which has been turned off and messages in her voice on his answering machine.  He visits price and learns he's an expert in EVP, electronic voice phenomena, and is able to record the sounds and sights of the dead.  Price has catalogued literally hundreds of tapes for different people, essentially using his skills as therapy for the loved ones of the deceased.  Jonathan becomes a believer after hearing his voice himself.  Price warns however that not all spirits are good and we see quick flashes of three shadowy figures on the TV screen and hear some threatening messages.  Price is soon found dead under mysterious circumstances and his equipment destroyed.Jonathan sets up his own monitors, recorders, and computer to begin trying to record the messages himself and soon is getting messages from his wife and from other people.  But in a twist, he is receiving messages from people before they are dead and is able to use that knowledge to help save people.  At this point I found it to be an exceptional film.  Suspenseful atmosphere that really piqued my interest.  Just who were those three shadowy figures and why is Jonathan able to get clairvoyant messages?The last quarter of the movie just unfolds a bit too fast and a lot of the questions are left unanswered such as those evil, shadowy ghosts.  I won't spoil the final little plot twist but that was all a bit too trite for me an took a bit of the luster off an otherwise very fine film.  I enjoyed Keaton in a more sedate performance.  As he is in nearly every seen he really had to give a strong performance and I think he did.The DVD includes a few short featurettes on real EVP experts as well as some deleted scenes and commentary.

It is about EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, strange sound that is recorded on tape with  other mysterious noise, supposedly coming from the world of the dead.Michael Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, a bereaved husband who thinks he received a message from his dead wife. With a help from an EVP expert (Ian McNeice), he tries to make contact with Anna (Chandra West), but as it turns out, he receives more messages than he had bargained for.The first half of the film gives successfully spooky atmosphere, but it starts to look incredible even by the standard of supernatural thriller, and it also gets silly as it goes on due to the weak and confusing script. The messages contain some part that suggest some dead people know almost everything (only in your neighborhood, though). In the contrived second half the mysterious messages, which were originally said to have come from `the other side,' turn out something different and even the existence of evil is implied, which can ignore and violate the law of physics. The film changes its rules constantly, making everything hopelessly messy.In spite of intense acting from Michael Keaton, and good support from Deborah Kara Unger, none of them can save the film from the mess because the characters they play are absolutely unreasonable. `White Noise' begins as `The Sixth Sense,' and ends as `The Ring,' but it becomes neither of them with the muddled conclusion that is more head-scratching than the fate of Samara the video girl.",2,"I Hear Dead People: Good Opening, Muddled Ending",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,1613,"['White', 'Noise', 'one', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Ring', 'make', 'effective', 'use', 'EVP', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'strange', 'sound', 'recorded', 'tape', 'other', 'mysterious', 'noise', 'supposedly', 'coming', 'world', 'dead.Michael', 'Keaton', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'bereaved', 'husband', 'who', 'received', 'message', 'dead', 'wife', 'help', 'EVP', 'expert', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'make', 'contact', 'Anna', 'Chandra', 'West', 'out', 'more', 'messages', 'had', 'bargained', 'for.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'successfully', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'look', 'incredible', 'even', 'standard', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'also', 'silly', 'due', 'weak', 'confusing', 'script', 'messages', 'contain', 'part', 'suggest', 'dead', 'people', 'know', 'almost', 'everything', 'only', 'neighborhood', 'though', 'contrived', 'second', 'mysterious', 'messages', 'were', 'originally', 'said', 'have', 'come', 'other', 'side', 'turn', 'out', 'something', 'different', 'even', 'existence', 'evil', 'implied', 'can', 'ignore', 'violate', 'law', 'physics', 'film', 'rules', 'constantly', 'making', 'everything', 'hopelessly', 'messy.In', 'spite', 'intense', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'good', 'support', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'none', 'can', 'save', 'film', 'mess', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'absolutely', 'unreasonable', 'White', 'Noise', 'begins', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Ring', 'muddled', 'conclusion', 'more', 'head-scratching', 'fate', 'Samara', 'video', 'girl']",White Noise

One night Jon receives a phone call from Raymond to come over immediately and when he arrives he finds Raymond dead on the floor.After mysterious Raymond's death, Jon goes to another means of contacting the spirit world where he is warned about the dangers of using EVP, but still wanting to hear from his wife, Jon makes his own studio in his house to search on his own. He does finally see his wife who keeps giving him messages which lead Jon to finding others in trouble and helping them.I will stop there so I don't give the whole movie away, but if this sounds intriguing to you, go out and rent the movie. Enjoy!On a personal note, you won't catch me using EVP! ;)",3,A supernatural thrill ride,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,1925,"['good', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'looking', 'realm', 'contacting', 'speaking', 'dead', 'like', 'suspense', 'movies', 'gore', 'rent', 'movie.The', 'quick', 'version', 'wife', 'mother', 'be', 'tragic', 'fate', 'husband', 'involved', 'questionable', 'method', 'talking', 'dead', 'hear', 'wife', 'again.The', 'longer', 'version', 'successful', 'architect', 'Jonathan', 'Rivers', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Rivers', 'Chandra', 'West', 'writer', 'have', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'pregnant', 'Unfortunately', 'evening', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'back', 'home', 'errands', 'car', 'discovered', 'flat', 'water', 'front', 'assumed', 'fell', 'water', 'drowned', 'Several', 'weeks', 'later', 'body', 'found.Six', 'months', 'pass', 'Jonathan', 'man', 'Raymond', 'Price', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'been', 'following', 'who', 'been', 'contact', 'wife', 'other', 'side', 'Jon', 'man', 'business', 'card', 'further', 'reference', 'needed', 'strange', 'events', 'receiving', 'phone', 'calls', 'wifes', 'cell', 'phone', 'chance', 'visit', 'Raymond', 'Raymond', 'technique', 'EVP', 'Electronic', 'Voice', 'Phenomenon', 'communicate', 'dead', 'start', 'sessions', 'One', 'night', 'Jon', 'phone', 'call', 'Raymond', 'come', 'immediately', 'when', 'Raymond', 'dead', 'floor.After', 'mysterious', 'Raymond', 'death', 'Jon', 'means', 'contacting', 'spirit', 'world', 'where', 'warned', 'dangers', 'using', 'EVP', 'still', 'wanting', 'hear', 'wife', 'Jon', 'own', 'studio', 'house', 'search', 'own', 'finally', 'see', 'wife', 'who', 'giving', 'messages', 'lead', 'Jon', 'finding', 'others', 'trouble', 'helping', 'them.I', 'will', 'stop', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'whole', 'movie', 'away', 'intriguing', 'go', 'out', 'rent', 'movie', 'Enjoy', 'personal', 'note', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'using', 'EVP']",White Noise
632644,A12LKEM543ILBK,B00005JNNT,zombie phreak,"[2, 3]","This movie was a disappointment.For the first 20 minutes we just have some emo guy moping around his house about his dead wife, and frankly I've seen that hundreds of times in the movies I've seen over the years.Then we get an actual interesting character in the fat guy who sees and talks to dead people via his videos, TV and computer.  However he's quickly killed.  Later our main character in the form of Michael Keaton becomes obsessed with talking to the dead through the same means as his predecessor, so much in fact he doesn't pay attention to his kid and pawns him off on his friend/relative, (We're never really told who this woman is).Turns out that he can now prevent people from being killed because the dead are showing him people who are going to die and where they are going to die in the near future, so he runs around like the guy from the show ""Early Edition"" from the 90's on CBS saving the day a few times.  In the end he himself is killed but he saves one last woman from being killed.Never once is this movie ever scary.  In fact the only attempts at horror that this movie makes is a few jump scares from ghosts on TV screens and three vague humanoid figures who are always in the shadows or out of focus.  Not once did I find myself concerned for the main character's safety or well being.  I wasn't really scared at all because I could tell when a jump scare was coming, the music would get really quiet, the characters would slow way down or stop moving completely, and then bingo!  Jump scare.  That's not scary to me.  Any idiot can jump out of a closet in the middle of the night and yell ""BOO"" and scare you, once or twice in a movie is fine.  But if that's your primary means of scaring your audience, then you've failed as a film-maker to create fear.Bottom line, this wasn't horrible, but it could have been a lot better.
