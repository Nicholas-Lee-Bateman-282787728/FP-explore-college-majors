Prins-Stairs ""Spaction3""","[48, 50]","I love Mission Hill, however this DVD set is not as great as the version you see on Adult Swim, a lot of the music is edited out and replaced and a scene is cut out on one of the episodes ""Kevin Finds Love (or Hot for Weirdie)"" and even worse, the voice audio on one of the episodes ""Andy and Kevin Make a Friend (or One Bang for Two Brothers)"" is so quiet that you have to turn the TV up all the way to hear it and it makes all the other sounds so loud that it hurts your ears.  If you really love Mission Hill, try recording the series onto DVD for yourself when it airs on Adult Swim, at least the episodes there are not edited and the episode with the bad voice track audio on the DVD set is not messed up on the original airing.  If you don't have a DVD recorder then for the sake of the episode ""Andy and Kevin Make a Friend (or One Bang for Two Brothers)"" I would at least record it onto VHS so you can hear it perfectly without having to turn the volume up all the way.  The bonus features are pretty cool though but for me that the only good thing.  While the episodes are still good on this, if you don't mind changes to music then go for this set, however as I said for one of the episode, damaged voice audio so be careful.",3,A really great show released in a not so great way,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,1235,"['love', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'however', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'version', 'see', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'lot', 'music', 'edited', 'out', 'replaced', 'scene', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'episodes', 'Kevin', 'Finds', 'Love', 'Hot', 'Weirdie', 'even', 'worse', 'voice', 'audio', 'one', 'episodes', 'Andy', 'Kevin', 'Make', 'Friend', 'One', 'Bang', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'so', 'quiet', 'have', 'turn', 'TV', 'way', 'hear', 'other', 'sounds', 'so', 'loud', 'ears', 'really', 'love', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'try', 'recording', 'series', 'DVD', 'when', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'least', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'edited', 'episode', 'bad', 'voice', 'track', 'audio', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'messed', 'up', 'original', 'airing', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'then', 'sake', 'episode', 'Andy', 'Kevin', 'Make', 'Friend', 'One', 'Bang', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'would', 'least', 'record', 'VHS', 'can', 'hear', 'perfectly', 'having', 'turn', 'volume', 'way', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'changes', 'music', 'then', 'go', 'set', 'however', 'said', 'one', 'episode', 'damaged', 'voice', 'audio', 'so', 'be', 'careful']",Mission Hill - The Complete Series

I can relate to several of the adventures in this show. Bought the DVD and absolutely loved it. It's sad how they only made 13 episodes. A show like this could have had many successful seasons. The shows that get 6+ seasons are over rated shows like family Guy and The Simpsons. And nether of those shows are funny any more. But anyways, all of the characters in this cartoon are interesting and have their own essence about themselves. Andy: Slacker, cool hipster, enjoy parties and liquor. Kevin: Nerdy, Intelligent, Drives Andy crazy. Jim: Laid-back, slow talking, always eating. Posey: Hippie-type, plant loving, sort of a space cadet. Stoogie: Andy's dog, eats constantly, drinks discarded liquor, dumb.Wally: Gus's lover. Gus: Wally's lover. There are many more but these are the most prominent in the show. I can't believe how accurately this show captured the city living enviroment. This is one of those shows you kick back and enjoy.

932343,A2TD13LRUGU46X,B000ARXF7I,Grant McKee,"[27, 29]","Mission Hill is probably my favorite animated series of all time.  It succeeds in taking everyday situations and blending in things that couldn't be accomplished with live people and real-world backgrounds.  Set against the colorful backdrop of Mission Hill (based largely on Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood), this series follows the life of Andy French, a 24-year-old hipster and aspiring cartoonist recently saddled with the family dog (who he's happy to share his home with) and his little brother Kevin (who he's not so happy to share his home with).  Andy's roommates Jim and Posey are there for the hilarity along with his neighbors, co-workers and Kevin's friends from high school whenever the show needs to ""nerd it up.""This show was a great voice for Generation X.  In the best episode of the short-lived series (""Unemployment, Part II""), Andy's without a job, and perfectly set to laze about at home, cashing his unemployment checks to fuel his malt liquor needs.  In his mind, he's living the lifestyle people of his generation were encouraged to live.  Andy gets kicked in the keister, though, when he finds out that his roommate Jim is leading the complete opposite life, without Andy having any clue.  This kind of real-life insight set the show apart from more slapstick-inspired series like The Simpsons (where Homer seems to lose his job in every episode, which doesn't disrupt the family's life) or Family Guy (where everything seems to work out in the end, no matter what Peter ends up doing).  That isn't to say Mission Hill is melodramatic.  Far from it - this show is one of the funniest I've seen in years.  But it's funny because the viewer is invited to share themselves with the characters.This is the perfect DVD for fans of the show, and I think each fan should find some friends that didn't get to enjoy Mission Hill during its brief time on the air, and share this show with them.",5,Brilliant,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1913,"['Mission', 'Hill', 'probably', 'favorite', 'animated', 'series', 'time', 'taking', 'everyday', 'situations', 'blending', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'accomplished', 'live', 'people', 'real-world', 'backgrounds', 'Set', 'colorful', 'backdrop', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'based', 'largely', 'Chicago', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'neighborhood', 'series', 'life', 'Andy', 'French', '24-year-old', 'hipster', 'aspiring', 'cartoonist', 'recently', 'saddled', 'family', 'dog', 'who', 'happy', 'share', 'home', 'little', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'share', 'home', 'Andy', 'roommates', 'Jim', 'Posey', 'are', 'there', 'hilarity', 'neighbors', 'co-workers', 'Kevin', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'nerd', 'up', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'voice', 'Generation', 'X', 'best', 'episode', 'short-lived', 'series', 'Unemployment', 'Part', 'II', 'Andy', 'job', 'perfectly', 'set', 'laze', 'home', 'cashing', 'unemployment', 'checks', 'fuel', 'malt', 'liquor', 'needs', 'mind', 'living', 'lifestyle', 'people', 'generation', 'were', 'encouraged', 'live', 'Andy', 'kicked', 'keister', 'though', 'when', 'out', 'roommate', 'Jim', 'leading', 'complete', 'opposite', 'life', 'Andy', 'having', 'clue', 'kind', 'real-life', 'insight', 'set', 'show', 'apart', 'more', 'slapstick-inspired', 'series', 'Simpsons', 'where', 'Homer', 'lose', 'job', 'episode', ""n't"", 'disrupt', 'family', 'life', 'Family', 'Guy', 'where', 'everything', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'matter', 'what', 'Peter', 'up', 'doing', ""n't"", 'say', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'melodramatic', 'Far', 'show', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'funny', 'viewer', 'invited', 'share', 'characters.This', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'fans', 'show', 'think', 'fan', 'should', 'find', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enjoy', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'brief', 'time', 'air', 'share', 'show']",Mission Hill - The Complete Series

932346,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000ARXF7I,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[3, 3]","When it comes to the short-lived cartoon series, ""Mission Hill"", I have to admit I'm a bit of a novice. I never caught it in its original WB network run and I only saw it once (the ""Unemployment Part 2"" episode) on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"". But that one episode grabbed my imagination and tickled my funny bone enough for me to invest some hard earned sheckles into buying this two CD set, ""Mission Hill~The Complete Series"".Now, here is the capper. Not knowing much about the series, I started watching the show with my six year old son. Yes, I can just imagine your shaking your head right now and the sound effect of ""Tut-tut"" is leaving your lips. I realize that there is some graphic ""pushing the envelope"" material shown and implied in the series and it isn't exactly something you would find on ""SpongeBob Square Pants"". I had some cringe induced reservations while watching the ""Pilot"" episode with him. But you know what? That stuff sort of just passed over my son's head. What really got his attention was the same stuff I liked. This included the show's bold (and colorful) graphic style, witty, satiric humor (which made fun of everything and anything) and the catchy, indie-style theme music.For those of you who don't know, the animated series looks at urban life in the somewhat pre-gentrified, city neighborhood of ""Mission Hill"". It features a close group of 'Gen-X' roommates and centers on two brothers. This includes 'slacker', Andy French (Voice of Wally Langham) and his younger, super-geeky brother from the suburbs, Kevin French (voice of Scott Mellville). To say these two are polar opposites is an understatement. Like most real-life brothers, they both seem to take perverse pleasure in criticizing and torturing each other. Sometimes this leads to comically rolling around on the floor attempting to kill each other. But don't worry, at the end of the day, these two look out for each other.The other roommates include the Buddah-like, bohemian wise-guy, Jim Kuback (Brian Poshn) and the spacey, holistic masseuse, Posey Tyler (Vicki Lewis). The show also features the kind of interesting characters you find in many urban neighborhoods including a multi-cultural activist/artist family and a hilarious, older gay couple (a mix of David Niven & Broderick Crawford) who run the local diner.These and other characters support the brothers in their various animated adventures and situations. Like the 'Simpsons' (which this show's creators wrote for), 'Mission Hill' seems to have the ability to make fun of everything with both wit, intelligence and most of all heart. This is a great show with well rounded characters and hilarious plotlines that takes chances. Its a shame that the series was so short-lived. It would have been interesting to see the further adventures of Andy, Kevin and the rest of the gang. Highly recommended!",5,Bling-Blong!

Even though it only lasted for a season, this is one of the best animated shows I've ever seen! It a mix of King of the Hill and Friends with nice animation, but the humor is down to earth and never gets too zany or over-the-top. The characters are wonderfully written and there is someone that almost anyone can relate to. While the show is hilarious, it manages to also blend in a small amount of drama as well without it feeling forced or uneven. It really is a treat of a show and if you haven't seen it, go ahead and purchase this set because it is worth it! Maybe if we are lucky, Mission Hill will one day be revived.
