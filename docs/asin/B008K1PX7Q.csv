1568898,A42GFMF12V7XR,B008K1PX7Q,Paul J. Mular,"[13, 13]","Fortunately in 1990 when this 25th Anniversary special was produced, most of the original cast was alive and well.  Some cast members look as if only a few years had passed, all have jumped back into their original characters with perfection.  What is amazing is that Frank Cady (Sam Drucker) is not only still around, but has aged well, he doesn't look 25 years older!There are only three things missing from this special.1) The Ziffels have passed away, but Arnold the Pig still lives on. Their passing is briefly explained by driving by their graves at the beginning. Their farm is now operated by their niece.2) The Cannonball Train is gone, along with the train tracks next to Sam Drucker's store.  No explanation is made of this, we just assume that in 25 years the train (like most) has been shut down.3) The catchy Vic Mizzy music, which was a trademark of Green Acres, is sourly missing.  This is one omission that could have been included.  Even with Mizzy gone, his music riffs could have been included.The story is one of the more solid re-union show stories, but it does go on about 30 minutes too long.  The slow down is 30 minutes into the movie when the Douglas's return to New York, this portion of the story should have only lasted 15 minutes but it is padded out.  (SPOILER ALERT HERE:  When Arnold gets lost in New Your you can just fast-forward to when he is re-united with everyone, that part is just boring padding.)There is fun humor to be had here, but it is just not the zany humor of the original TV series.  The big fun of these re-union shows was to see your favorite characters & stars as they are 'today'.  And we were pleased and happy to see how well everyone looked.  Unlike most other re-union shows that have horrendous story lines (The Beverly Hillbillies & Addams Family re-unions), this one has a plausible and over-all enjoyable story.But, didn't we all think that the Douglas's packed it in when the series was cancelled in 1970 and moved back to New York then?",3,"Fun reunion, but not as zany as the classic series.",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2002,"['Fortunately', '1990', 'when', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'was', 'produced', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'alive', 'well', 'cast', 'members', 'look', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'have', 'jumped', 'back', 'original', 'characters', 'perfection', 'What', 'amazing', 'Frank', 'Cady', 'Sam', 'Drucker', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'aged', 'well', ""n't"", 'look', '25', 'years', 'older', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'things', 'missing', 'special.1', 'Ziffels', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'Arnold', 'Pig', 'still', 'passing', 'briefly', 'explained', 'driving', 'graves', 'beginning', 'farm', 'now', 'operated', 'niece.2', 'Cannonball', 'Train', 'gone', 'train', 'tracks', 'Sam', 'Drucker', 'store', 'explanation', 'made', 'just', 'assume', '25', 'years', 'train', 'most', 'been', 'shut', 'down.3', 'catchy', 'Vic', 'Mizzy', 'music', 'was', 'trademark', 'Green', 'Acres', 'sourly', 'missing', 'one', 'omission', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Even', 'Mizzy', 'gone', 'music', 'riffs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included.The', 'story', 'one', 'more', 'solid', 're-union', 'show', 'stories', 'go', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'slow', 'down', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'Douglas', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'portion', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'only', 'lasted', '15', 'minutes', 'padded', 'out', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'HERE', 'When', 'Arnold', 'lost', 'New', 'Your', 'can', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'when', 're-united', 'everyone', 'part', 'just', 'boring', 'padding', 'fun', 'humor', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'just', 'not', 'zany', 'humor', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'big', 'fun', 're-union', 'shows', 'was', 'see', 'favorite', 'characters', 'stars', 'are', ""'today"", 'were', 'pleased', 'happy', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'everyone', 'looked', 'most', 'other', 're-union', 'shows', 'have', 'horrendous', 'story', 'lines', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Addams', 'Family', 're-unions', 'one', 'plausible', 'over-all', 'enjoyable', 'story.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Douglas', 'packed', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', '1970', 'moved', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'then']",N/A

The magic was still there and to see so many of the original cast, just a little bit older, but still as funny to watch. I noticed that Eva didn't get too many kisses on the show, maybe it was because of all that heavy make-up to hide her wrinkles and was that a wig that she had on, just didn't look right? The story line was pretty good, even though, not very original, but it made for good watching and wonderful family fare that is so missing on T.V. except on re-runs. I don't know why I missed this show when it first came out back in 1990 AD, but I am happy that I now have it. Have your children and grand-children over, make some pop-corn and have a great night watching this movie and of course, if you have some of the original Green Acres shows, play them for everyone once again.
