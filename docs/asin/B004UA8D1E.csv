1428026,A1Z63FBHYURF19,B004UA8D1E,A. Garvin,"[27, 30]","I am a Bradley Cooper fan and independent film buff and overlook a lot of issues in the way of production quality in order to pay attention to the heart of a story.  However, it is not possible to either appreciate Bradley Cooper or the plot of this particular movie that is disjointed, not logical, nonsensical, and worst of all, lacking in any decent verbage.  The sound quality is absolutely horrendous.  Forget the lack of plot and terrible sex scenes (in one scene Bradley Cooper's foot is firmly planted on a woman's ear), the worst thing is the straining to hear the actor's voices. The one good thing it does do is make you appreciate most other films you might happen to watch.  The price I paid for this supposed movie is regrettable because it means I paid for a mistake. Bradley Cooper should use his clout and connections and get someone with money to burn to bury this particular film of his and likeise, Amazon should not offend their customers with charging for the viewing of this film.

1428028,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004UA8D1E,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","This viewer falls into the category of most of those who have written a response to this film - it is just simply feeble. Clue: the film was written and directed by two people Peter Knight and Morgan Klein and the hodgepodge of collaboration shows. Couple the bad script with a cast of amateurs (Note: this was WAY before Bradley Cooper had been transformed into a box office sensation - both acting wise and physique-wise) and the result is a film that should have been left in the can.Nerdy Kenna (Colleen Porch) is simultaneously dating two guys - DJ Jeff (Bradley Cooper) and Businessman Martin (David Gail). It is an open relationship in that both men know Kenna's proclivities, that she has no intention of settling down, being a hedonist - apparently related to her Carnival background: her father Mortie (Kurt McKinney) is a carny man whose preoccupied with bad mouthing Kenna's mother. None of that information really fits into the story despite the fact that a lot of screen time is devoted to the carny aspect.  Needless to say the three way relationship can't last and how it resolves is the remainder of the story - if you can make it through this mess long enough to see the fuzzy ending.The sad aspect of seeing this film is the reminder of the many, many really fine Indie films of quality that never make it to the public.  Money backing must be the only answer, though it would seem that finding backers for this cheesy film would have been a supreme challenge.

This is NOT a Bradley Cooper gets the girl movie!!! He is one of the two guys going after the main chic in this flick. I'm a big movie goer/watcher yet I know that I don't know all that goes into a movie. But I do know this... this was a cheap movie. The acting is bad. The music, horrible! And the only thing that would make the plot tolerable is if one of the men actually got the girl in the end. Sorry!!! I was excited when I saw a Bradley Cooper movie listed on my Amazon Video on Demand. I hadn't heard of it??? I looked it up on the best website out there, IMDb. Not a whole lot there. In fact at the time, there wasn't even one rating. But the trailer was there. So, I watched it. Hmmm, I thought? Looks pretty good. Looks funny. Well of course, the only good parts are shown in the trailer. I know I sound harsh. I'm sorry. Believe it or not, I give most movies a pretty good rating. Really! And no offense to Bradley Cooper, because, yes, I do love you!!! But I believe this movie was only released on DVD because he's a star now. If you haven't seen LIMITLESS, you must. It's amazing!!! So, just to sum this up, please don't waste your time and money watching this movie... you don't even get to see a bare butt :)",1,Bending all the rules,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1351,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Okay', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'awhile', 'back', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'was', 'current', 'hot', 'shot', 'today', 'love', 'NOT', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'girl', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'guys', 'going', 'main', 'chic', 'flick', ""'m"", 'big', 'movie', 'goer/watcher', 'yet', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'cheap', 'movie', 'acting', 'bad', 'music', 'horrible', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'plot', 'tolerable', 'one', 'men', 'actually', 'got', 'girl', 'end', 'Sorry', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'movie', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'looked', 'up', 'best', 'website', 'there', 'IMDb', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'there', 'fact', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'one', 'rating', 'trailer', 'was', 'there', 'So', 'watched', 'Hmmm', 'thought', 'Looks', 'pretty', 'good', 'funny', 'Well', 'course', 'only', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'shown', 'trailer', 'know', 'sound', 'harsh', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Believe', 'not', 'give', 'most', 'movies', 'pretty', 'good', 'rating', 'Really', 'offense', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'yes', 'do', 'love', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'DVD', 'star', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'LIMITLESS', 'must', 'amazing', 'So', 'just', 'sum', 'up', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'see', 'bare', 'butt']",Bending All The Rules
