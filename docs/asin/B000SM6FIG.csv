It must be a redhead thing.  I couldn't recommend them enough.I would definitely say you should get both of these tapes to mix it up a bit, but for anyone just deciding between the two, here's a word of advice based on my initial testing...  The Ten Minute one is definitely for everyone.  It's amazing because who can't workout for ten minutes?  And there's four different ones.  But the Ultimate Fat Burn, while personally is my favorite, is definitely a little harder of a workout.  If you're just a beginner, it may be a little difficult for you.  But like I said before, I'd get them both.  Slow days?  Ten Minute Workout.  Harder Days?  Ultimate Fat Burn.I hope this helps.  They really are amazing tapes.  I hope they make more.

Amy Dixon does intervals in this workout, which breaks it up nicely so there is a lot of variety (I didn't get bored during this workout!) She starts with a nice brisk warm-up, and then does alternating strength and cardio intervals.  The cardio intervals really got my heart rate up and moving without having me totally gasping.  I loved all the varied moves and jumps she added--it really made the workout fun, and it was over before I knew it!  The strength intervals had a lot of varied moves as well, although for my fitness level I could have used 5-pound weights rather than the 3-pound recommended weights.  She does move a bit fast, and the first time you do this I would recommend that you watch her do a move one time before attempting it.  However, like others have said, she is good at cueing and lets you know precisely when something different is coming up.Overall, I would definitely recommend this workout to anyone.  It is tough, but Amy Dixon is very motivating (and NOT annoying). While I don't know if it will burn 500 calories, I definitely felt like I WORKED OUT and had fun doing it.  I was absolutely drenched in sweat and had an endorphin high when it was over.I have tried one other Women's Health workout (Perfect Body Workout), and while I did like it, I wasn't entirely sold on these workouts.

I have never been big into weights, always focusing on the cardio instead. I like how you alternate between weights and cardio during the 1/2 hour. I also like how easy the moves were and how well Amy Dixon explains them. I hate it when I buy a cardio DVD to try and the moves are too complicated and by the time you realize you aren't sweating because you can't keep up, you have wasted your time and then don't get in a good calorie burn for the day. Nothing is more frustrating to a morning exerciser than that! Getting up early for no sweat! I also like how the woman doing the DVD are all different shapes and sizes. No one is perfect and it's really encouraging to see that in a fitness DVD. Worth the money!! I use this over and over!",5,Great Workout!!,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,833,"['love', 'workout', '1st', 'Women', 'Health', 'DVD', 'bought', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'weights', 'always', 'focusing', 'cardio', 'instead', 'how', 'alternate', 'weights', 'cardio', '1/2', 'hour', 'also', 'how', 'easy', 'moves', 'were', 'how', 'well', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'hate', 'when', 'buy', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'try', 'moves', 'are', 'too', 'complicated', 'time', 'realize', 'are', ""n't"", 'sweating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'have', 'wasted', 'time', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'calorie', 'burn', 'day', 'Nothing', 'more', 'frustrating', 'morning', 'exerciser', 'Getting', 'up', 'early', 'sweat', 'also', 'how', 'woman', 'doing', 'DVD', 'are', 'different', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'one', 'perfect', 'really', 'encouraging', 'see', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'money', 'use', 'over']",N/A

I like this better than Amy Dixon's Women's Health Perfect Body DVD because it's set up with intervals, instead of separate cardio and strength. Since it keeps changing, your heartrate stays up and it stays interesting. My heartrate is usually around 50-60% of maximum. I like Amy's cheerful style that doesn't seem to fake.",4,"Great instructor, short video",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,372,"['really', 'short', 'video', 'too', 'bad', 'like', 'better', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Women', 'Health', 'Perfect', 'Body', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'intervals', 'instead', 'separate', 'cardio', 'strength', 'changing', 'heartrate', 'up', 'interesting', 'heartrate', 'usually', '50-60', '%', 'maximum', 'like', 'Amy', 'cheerful', 'style', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fake']",N/A
1086701,A3DKB9QZUJYBE3,B000SM6FIG,"Trixie ""cupcakejones""","[2, 2]","There are many reasons to recommend this video: the production values are excellent, Amy Dixon is a great cuer and the cues are mirrored (every workout video should do this-period) and there are many intelligent touches that other videos would do well to follow (for example, when Amy says to follow one exerciser for modifications, the camera cuts to that person who is in the front row, unobscured by other exercisers.) There is a good combination of compound weight moves and somewhat basic cardio, including kickboxing--although I wish the ratio were a little more balanced. There is more cardio than weight work here. I really liked this video the first time I did it.Cut to a few weeks later. The background exercisers are having a good time. TOO good of a time. I am not normally bothered by background exercisers hooting and hollering but there is a lot of it. And everything Amy says that is even mildly amusing is met by screams of laughter. This happens repeatedly. Over time, the dread factor started creeping in. I start cringing whenever I know a ""punchline"" is coming.It's ridiculous, right? And yet, I may in the end not be able to get past it. A remark like, ""I'm a little afraid of the sun"" is just not worthy of a round of gut-busting laughter the first time you hear it. A workout I enjoyed on the first go around is approaching onerous on the 5th or 6th go-round. I'm going to take this DVD out of rotation for a while.I don't know about her other Women's Health DVD's (this is the only one I have) but I do love Amy Dixon as an instructor-she enunciates clearly, she gives great form tips, she is motivating but low key-and am a big fan of her Kicking Strength workout which is also cardio/toning mix.
