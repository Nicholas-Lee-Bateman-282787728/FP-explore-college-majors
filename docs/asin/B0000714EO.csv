724245,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,B0000714EO,Christopher Hivner,"[0, 0]","Denis Leary plays Ray Pluto, a city detective whose life is in a downward spiral. He is still mourning the death of his wife and child from a car accident and his career is at a standstill. One day he and his partner, an odd sad-sack played by Steve Buscemi, pull into a fast food place for lunch. Despite complaining of a bad back Pluto goes in to get the food. While he's there a truck crashes through the window and a gunman jumps out and begins shooting. When Pluto goes to shoot him, his back goes out, he falls knocking himself unconscious and a ten year old boy picks up his gun and kills the shooter.Dubbed a ""loser cop"" by the newspapers, Pluto's life goes further in the toilet. He begins a romance with a chiropractor played by Liz Hurley, and becomes embroiled in solving the attempted murder of the super of his building who is a friend. The plot also mixes in the two idiot would-be killers and two other building tenants who are writing a screenplay and try to use Ray's police knowledge to make it more realistic.Double Whammy tries to be an action/thriller/comedy hybrid but never really achieves the right mix and ultimately fails at all three. The characters are too tepid to be really interesting and the comedy farce never materializes. There are conversations in the movie that just sit there and go nowhere, while in the hands of a skilled writer would have been laugh-out loud funny. Christopher Noth and Steve Buscemi are wasted in roles that barely have any screen time and end up meaningless to the plot. Double Whammy isn't a bad movie but it could have been much more.",3,Mostly Whammyless,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1597,"['Denis', 'Leary', 'Ray', 'Pluto', 'city', 'detective', 'life', 'downward', 'spiral', 'still', 'mourning', 'death', 'wife', 'child', 'car', 'accident', 'career', 'standstill', 'One', 'day', 'partner', 'odd', 'sad-sack', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'pull', 'fast', 'food', 'place', 'lunch', 'complaining', 'bad', 'back', 'Pluto', 'get', 'food', 'truck', 'crashes', 'window', 'gunman', 'out', 'shooting', 'When', 'Pluto', 'shoot', 'back', 'out', 'knocking', 'unconscious', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'up', 'gun', 'shooter.Dubbed', 'loser', 'cop', 'newspapers', 'Pluto', 'life', 'further', 'toilet', 'romance', 'chiropractor', 'played', 'Liz', 'Hurley', 'embroiled', 'solving', 'attempted', 'murder', 'super', 'building', 'who', 'friend', 'plot', 'also', 'two', 'idiot', 'would-be', 'killers', 'two', 'other', 'building', 'tenants', 'who', 'are', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'try', 'use', 'Ray', 'police', 'knowledge', 'make', 'more', 'realistic.Double', 'Whammy', 'tries', 'be', 'action/thriller/comedy', 'hybrid', 'never', 'really', 'right', 'mix', 'ultimately', 'fails', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'tepid', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'comedy', 'farce', 'never', 'are', 'conversations', 'movie', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'go', 'nowhere', 'hands', 'skilled', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'funny', 'Christopher', 'Noth', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'are', 'wasted', 'roles', 'barely', 'have', 'screen', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'Double', 'Whammy', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more']",Double Whammy

Even during some so called serious scenes i couldnt help but laugh.. i enjoyed this movie and would reccomend it to anybody, DIcallo is so original with this film it doesnt come close to feeling like any film i saw before, he truly added his own flair to it, definately up there as one of my favorite comedies",4,Funny and pleasing in every way,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,641,"['talk', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'i', 'picked', 'up', 'used', 'copy', 'price', 'was', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'Not', 'even', 'hearing', 'movie', 'beforehand', 'took', 'dvd', 'home', 'watched', 'lem', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'hilarious', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'goin', 'once', 'go', 'well', 'together', 'build', 'up', 'funny', 'parts', 'Even', 'so', 'called', 'serious', 'scenes', 'i', 'couldnt', 'help', 'laugh..', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'reccomend', 'anybody', 'DIcallo', 'so', 'original', 'film', 'come', 'close', 'feeling', 'film', 'i', 'saw', 'before', 'truly', 'added', 'own', 'flair', 'definately', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies']",Double Whammy
724247,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B0000714EO,drkhimxz,"[0, 1]","Well, this is the kind of film which many of us picked up out of the bargain bin not knowing anything but what appears in the blurb. No doubt some will find it funny, others will not. I did not, so I cannot point out just what it is the other group who like it w liked.  The lead actress is attractive, though her role mostly involves jumping the bones of the lead actor. She plays the role of a chiropractor, he is a detective with back problems. Of course, in this sort of film, no question of the fact that she is violating a basic premise of her profession, for which she could lose her license, never enters the discussion.  It is, she says, just that she is impulsive. Naturally, following what one is to believe is a highly satisfactory session of sex between them, he calls to tell her he doesn't want to see her anymore.  You get the idea.I did notice this was supposedly based on a book by Hiassen;  no doubt he enjoyed the check he received. Without having read the book, I feel certain that the film bears little resemblance to it.Glancing at some of the other reviews, I see that I have failed to give notice of the girl who plays the teenage daughter of the detectives landlord and friend. That was because I really did not notice her in the film (of course, I saw her,  but did not note her). Perhaps,  if one is of the age where she shines, one is of the age for which this film was made, and, therefore, one who will get much pleasure from it.",2,No Doubt There is an Audience for this Kind of Film,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1460,"['Well', 'kind', 'film', 'many', 'picked', 'up', 'bargain', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'what', 'blurb', 'doubt', 'will', 'find', 'funny', 'others', 'will', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'point', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'other', 'group', 'who', 'liked', 'lead', 'actress', 'attractive', 'role', 'mostly', 'jumping', 'bones', 'lead', 'actor', 'role', 'chiropractor', 'detective', 'back', 'problems', 'course', 'sort', 'film', 'question', 'fact', 'violating', 'basic', 'premise', 'profession', 'could', 'lose', 'license', 'never', 'discussion', 'just', 'impulsive', 'Naturally', 'following', 'what', 'one', 'believe', 'highly', 'satisfactory', 'session', 'sex', 'tell', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'anymore', 'get', 'idea.I', 'did', 'notice', 'was', 'supposedly', 'based', 'book', 'Hiassen', 'doubt', 'enjoyed', 'check', 'received', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'feel', 'certain', 'film', 'little', 'resemblance', 'it.Glancing', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'have', 'failed', 'give', 'notice', 'girl', 'who', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'detectives', 'landlord', 'friend', 'was', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'film', 'course', 'saw', 'did', 'not', 'note', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'age', 'where', 'one', 'age', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'therefore', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'pleasure']",Double Whammy
