1259319,A1137EVEDGO1KH,B002AT4PA0,Edward J. Erler Jr.,"[4, 4]","I caught this film on the Movie Channel a few nights ago.  This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen.  And you would be hard pressed to find very many that I have missed. I rate it 5 stars and maybe a box of kleenex.  I see where some of the reviewers didn't like it because it was low budget. Some of the biggest flops at the box-office in the last 10 years have been ""big budget"" films. True it didn't have massive battle scenes where Nicholas Cage takes out a zillion of the enemy (Wind Talkers), non-stop heroic action (Private Ryan), CGI special effects, etc... but what it did have was the intense, emotional depiction of real combat as seen through the eyes of the Japanese-Americans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (Google it) that fought in Africa, Italy and France during WW2. A good story and convincing actors are what really makes a movie. The movie went back and forth between combat situations, where you almost never saw the enemy up close, and flashbacks as the men thought of their loved ones back home, that many of them would never see again. At first I thought that so many flashbacks would break the continuity of the film but it only intensified it. The true story of men who volunteered to serve their country, even after many of them and their families had been placed in internment camps and lost all they owned simply because they were of Japanese descent. Their unit went on to become the most decorated unit in the history of the U.S. Army.  It is a shame that this film didn't make it in the theaters. I would hope to see this film available on blue-ray in the future.",5,Great Movie,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1612,"['caught', 'film', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'very', 'many', 'have', 'missed', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'maybe', 'box', 'kleenex', 'see', 'where', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'biggest', 'flops', 'box-office', 'last', '10', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'True', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'massive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'where', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'out', 'zillion', 'enemy', 'Wind', 'Talkers', 'non-stop', 'heroic', 'action', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'was', 'intense', 'emotional', 'depiction', 'real', 'combat', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Japanese-Americans', '442nd', 'Regimental', 'Combat', 'Team', 'Google', 'fought', 'Africa', 'Italy', 'France', 'WW2', 'good', 'story', 'convincing', 'actors', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'combat', 'situations', 'where', 'almost', 'never', 'saw', 'enemy', 'up', 'close', 'flashbacks', 'men', 'thought', 'loved', 'ones', 'back', 'home', 'many', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'first', 'thought', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'break', 'continuity', 'film', 'only', 'intensified', 'true', 'story', 'men', 'who', 'volunteered', 'serve', 'country', 'even', 'many', 'families', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'internment', 'camps', 'lost', 'owned', 'simply', 'were', 'Japanese', 'descent', 'unit', 'went', 'become', 'most', 'decorated', 'unit', 'history', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'shame', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'theaters', 'would', 'hope', 'see', 'film', 'available', 'blue-ray', 'future']",Only the Brave

1259322,AT393OR1JTYNR,B002AT4PA0,Miami Nights,"[30, 30]","""Only the Brave"" isn't the best war movie around, nor does it have the shine or polish seen in big-budget, Hollywood movies, but it's very moving, knowing that what happened to the soldiers in the movie is based on historical fact.""Only the Brave"" is about the efforts of the 442/100 military regiment to rescue a Texas battalion that got stuck behind enemy lines during WWII. In doing so, they lost more soldiers than they ended up rescuing.What makes this movie quite the rarity in American entertainment is that the soldiers at the center of the movie are Japanese-American. Perhaps with a bigger budget, it could have had more screen time to fully flesh out the main characters (played by Lane Nishikawa, Jason Scott Lee, Tamlyn Tomita, Mark Dacascos, Yuji Okumoto and Greg Watanabe), but it does well enough to pass on this rather underreported part of American/WWII history. While they and their families were in American internment camps, they volunteered to join the American military, to prove that they were just as American as anyone else living in the country.Some critics have given negative reviews of this movie, but I tend to be more lenient with low-budget films. But this movie does overcome its budget restraints and delivers emotionally powerful scenes, and the film is also interesting and educational. It might be of more immediate interest to Japanese-Americans, but it deserves to be seen by those who don't know the history of Japanese-American soldiers.",4,"Low budget, yes, but still powerful, moving, historical",1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,1479,"['Only', 'Brave', ""n't"", 'best', 'war', 'movie', 'have', 'shine', 'polish', 'seen', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'very', 'moving', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'soldiers', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'Only', 'Brave', 'efforts', '442/100', 'military', 'regiment', 'rescue', 'Texas', 'battalion', 'got', 'stuck', 'enemy', 'lines', 'WWII', 'doing', 'so', 'lost', 'more', 'soldiers', 'ended', 'up', 'rescuing.What', 'movie', 'quite', 'rarity', 'American', 'entertainment', 'soldiers', 'center', 'movie', 'are', 'Japanese-American', 'Perhaps', 'bigger', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Lane', 'Nishikawa', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'Yuji', 'Okumoto', 'Greg', 'Watanabe', 'well', 'enough', 'pass', 'rather', 'underreported', 'part', 'American/WWII', 'history', 'families', 'were', 'American', 'internment', 'camps', 'volunteered', 'join', 'American', 'military', 'prove', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'American', 'anyone', 'else', 'living', 'country.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'given', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'lenient', 'low-budget', 'films', 'movie', 'overcome', 'budget', 'restraints', 'delivers', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'educational', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'immediate', 'interest', 'Japanese-Americans', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'Japanese-American', 'soldiers']",Only the Brave

1259326,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B002AT4PA0,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 4]","I wish I had read all the harsh criticism of this before getting it (luckily rented). This is supposed to be the true story of the Japanese Americans, who after being interred at the beginning of WW II (after Pearl Harbor) all volunteered to fight for their adopted country. It is a little known part of the story of that war - a bit like all the Germans we interred too.This then is the story of the 100th/442 Regimental Combat Team, who after fighting through Italy, end up in the French campaign. They are ordered to relieve a surrounded unit of fellow American soldiers against an enemy that out number them 2 to 1. This then should be an action film. Well it is not, it tries to be a couple of times, but fails, there is so much flash back in a futile attempt to engender empathy, that it becomes confusing and has the opposite effect. During the `action' scenes the camera goes all shaky in a, well futile attempt to engender heightened tension.It is shot in a way to make it look monochrome a bit like the excellent `Band of Brothers', this is suppose to highlight the blood and `gore' when it happens, and yeah it sort of does but it is always so dragged out that any shock is soon replaced by creeping boredom. The acting in places and dialogue was both stilted and lacking in conviction; to call it over sentimental would be a conservative under statement. There are also these ghost sequences that sit awkwardly with the `plot' and do nothing to take the film forward.They attempt to deal with the racism that these very brave men had to face and it is attempting to be an homage to what became one of the highest decorated battalions of the war. Director Lane Nishikatawa has really not done himself or the memory of these men any favours and it is a shame as it is a real missed opportunity. Like many commentators I feel there is much more here that could have been explored and it may be that too much has been attempted and that is where it falls down. That said it is still an important film for the story it tells and the memory of these very brave men.",3,Essential story that could have been told so much better,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,2071,"['wish', 'had', 'read', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'getting', 'luckily', 'rented', 'supposed', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'who', 'being', 'interred', 'beginning', 'WW', 'II', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'volunteered', 'fight', 'adopted', 'country', 'little', 'known', 'part', 'story', 'war', 'bit', 'Germans', 'interred', 'too.This', 'then', 'story', '100th/442', 'Regimental', 'Combat', 'Team', 'who', 'fighting', 'Italy', 'end', 'up', 'French', 'campaign', 'are', 'ordered', 'relieve', 'surrounded', 'unit', 'fellow', 'American', 'soldiers', 'enemy', 'out', 'number', '2', '1', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'action', 'film', 'Well', 'not', 'be', 'couple', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'flash', 'back', 'futile', 'attempt', 'engender', 'empathy', 'confusing', 'opposite', 'effect', 'action', 'scenes', 'camera', 'shaky', 'well', 'futile', 'attempt', 'engender', 'heightened', 'tension.It', 'shot', 'way', 'make', 'look', 'bit', 'excellent', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'suppose', 'highlight', 'blood', 'gore', 'when', 'yeah', 'sort', 'always', 'so', 'dragged', 'out', 'shock', 'soon', 'replaced', 'creeping', 'boredom', 'acting', 'places', 'dialogue', 'was', 'stilted', 'lacking', 'conviction', 'call', 'sentimental', 'would', 'be', 'conservative', 'statement', 'are', 'also', 'ghost', 'sequences', 'sit', 'awkwardly', 'plot', 'do', 'nothing', 'take', 'film', 'forward.They', 'attempt', 'deal', 'racism', 'very', 'brave', 'men', 'had', 'face', 'attempting', 'be', 'homage', 'what', 'became', 'one', 'highest', 'decorated', 'battalions', 'war', 'Director', 'Lane', 'Nishikatawa', 'really', 'not', 'done', 'memory', 'men', 'favours', 'shame', 'real', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'many', 'commentators', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'attempted', 'where', 'down', 'said', 'still', 'important', 'film', 'story', 'memory', 'very', 'brave', 'men']",Only the Brave
