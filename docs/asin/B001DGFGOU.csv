But, as you find out more about their past, the characters' actions are understandable. We really enjoyed it, and my daughter, who plays piano, was truly inspired by the piano in the movie.  I'm not the first to write this, but the piano playing is incredible four-minute contest piece at the end is unforgettable.  The acting is great. I'm more of a happy-ending type person, and even I have to admit this was a very good movie./////////////////////////I'm adding something to my initial review. After I reviewed this film, I noticed that my amazon.com recommendations were full of movies with a lesbian theme.  This surprised me, because though one character in ""Four Minutes"" is lesbian, it's not a theme of the movie as we saw it.  It would be too bad if you didn't watch this movie because of pigeonholing by amazon or anyone else. It's a well acted movie with two female leads, one who supresses her pain and rage, the other who lets the rage take over, and the music that brings them together. I very much recommend this movie for the raw emotion and exceptionally well-drawn characters.",5,Splendid movie,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1175,"['Not', 'cheerful', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'past', 'characters', 'actions', 'are', 'understandable', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'daughter', 'who', 'piano', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'piano', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'write', 'piano', 'playing', 'incredible', 'four-minute', 'contest', 'piece', 'end', 'unforgettable', 'acting', 'great', ""'m"", 'more', 'happy-ending', 'type', 'person', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie./////////////////////////I', ""'m"", 'adding', 'something', 'initial', 'review', 'reviewed', 'film', 'noticed', 'amazon.com', 'recommendations', 'were', 'full', 'movies', 'lesbian', 'theme', 'surprised', 'one', 'character', 'Four', 'Minutes', 'lesbian', 'not', 'theme', 'movie', 'saw', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'pigeonholing', 'amazon', 'anyone', 'else', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'one', 'who', 'pain', 'rage', 'other', 'who', 'rage', 'take', 'music', 'together', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'movie', 'raw', 'emotion', 'exceptionally', 'well-drawn', 'characters']",Four Minutes
1180303,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B001DGFGOU,KinoChelovek,"[3, 3]","I can't even stress how great this movie is.  Someone sat down and really wrote a magnificent movie.  Yes, it is about lesbianism, but only as a ""love lost"" theme.  It is so much more.  It plays like a female version of another great movie, ""Finding Forester"".I was impressed with the several sub-narratives that are intertwined around one main story: An aged piano teacher, who has worked at a women's detention center teaching piano and looking for the perfect student, is brought a young prisoner piano prodigy with a horrible past.  The two women attempt to break down their social and prejudicial barriers, find empathy with one another, and find some sense of closure in their lives.  Releasing deep, personal pains through the art of music and unleashing anger physically is what repressed memories bring as the story unfolds.  There is the story of a self-absorbed warden who wants to be noticed, a prison guard who, after being both humiliated by having his rear kicked by the prodigy and losing the teacher's sole attention, attempts to get even with both, and a step-father/daughter relationship whose dark past is faced.Even more important to me (and is the main, parallel narrative) is the story that flashes back to the Nazi era, telling the story of the piano teacher (then, a nurse for the war effort) and how her forbidden relationship killed her love as well a part of her soul.  She attempts to rectify and analyze this past through the prodigy, but still keeps those memories repressed, causing the prodigy to question the teacher's motives.Yes, the entire movie is multi-layered and multi-dimensional, touching on themes of guilt, sorrow, and closure.  The conclusions to each of the narratives is haunting, deeply personal, and, in two cases, (semi-) non-predictable.I don't want to give away the entire complex, but overall satisfying, story.  It is well-rounded, with a wonderful ending.  Bittersweet and moving, with some humor in between.  Movies like this do not come around often enough.Excellent acting all-around, with great direction, cinematography, and music.  Highly recommended!5 of 5.

1180305,A1S3BJZKDAEUBV,B001DGFGOU,Malcolm Kantzler,"[1, 2]","""Four Minutes"" may have been based, in part, upon the real person to whom the film is dedicated, one Gertrud Kr&uuml;ger, who passed away in 2004, at 87, and who would have been about the same age as the principal character, the music teacher, ""Traude Kr&uuml;ger,"" at the time her female lover in the story was set to be executed in a Nazi prison near the end of WWII.The cover picture on the DVD is a misleading, sex-sells, studio redressing, an exaggeration of the story setting and characters.  The film, winner of many international awards, is set in contemporary Germany (English subtitles), with flashbacks to the war, and the emphasis is certainly not on sex or the war-time, lesbian love affair of the piano teacher's youth, but rather, how that love and the loss of it shaped her purpose through the rest of her life, and how she saw, in her piano student, Jenny, a unique opportunity to fulfill that purpose:  the celebration and cultivation of beauty, proclaimed as she scolded Jenny at a turning point in their relationship, late in the story, rhetorically asking her, ""What else are we here for?""The story centers on the relationship of the spinster piano teacher (Monica Bleibtreu) with her troubled student, Jenny (Hannah Herzsprung), a prison inmate who would be a poster girl for Gothic if she could choose her wardrobe, a victim of child abuse, convicted of a brutal murder, but who, throughout most of her childhood, cultivated her natural gift for music, specifically, playing piano.  The two come together as flame to the fuse when the teacher takes her on as one of only four students in the prison's ""piano program.""There are few light moments, but they are all-the-more striking for their sparseness.  And the story poses questions, unfolds the answers, and invests the viewer in the characters sufficiently to hold interest into the climax, where statements, subtle and bold, of both lead characters are gestured and acted-out with consummate skill, Jenny's musical piece at the final competition, played before a packed concert hall, intended to be ""Schumann's Concert in A Minor,"" turning into a classic-rock mix that is as remarkable for its style as the way it speaks for Jenny, her final bow to her teacher in the audience wrapping up the concert and their relationship, conveying an understanding that is reached between the two with an expression on Jenny's face that lingers in the mind along with the story as the credits roll.",4,An ebony film with ivory soul.,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,2462,"['Four', 'Minutes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'part', 'real', 'person', 'whom', 'film', 'dedicated', 'one', 'Gertrud', 'Kr', 'uuml', 'ger', 'who', 'passed', 'away', '2004', '87', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'age', 'principal', 'character', 'music', 'teacher', 'Traude', 'Kr', 'uuml', 'ger', 'time', 'female', 'lover', 'story', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'executed', 'Nazi', 'prison', 'end', 'WWII.The', 'cover', 'picture', 'DVD', 'misleading', 'sex-sells', 'studio', 'redressing', 'exaggeration', 'story', 'setting', 'characters', 'film', 'winner', 'many', 'international', 'awards', 'set', 'contemporary', 'Germany', 'English', 'subtitles', 'flashbacks', 'war', 'emphasis', 'certainly', 'not', 'sex', 'war-time', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'piano', 'teacher', 'youth', 'rather', 'how', 'love', 'loss', 'shaped', 'purpose', 'rest', 'life', 'how', 'saw', 'piano', 'student', 'Jenny', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'fulfill', 'purpose', 'celebration', 'cultivation', 'beauty', 'proclaimed', 'scolded', 'Jenny', 'turning', 'point', 'relationship', 'late', 'story', 'rhetorically', 'asking', 'What', 'else', 'are', 'here', 'story', 'centers', 'relationship', 'spinster', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Monica', 'Bleibtreu', 'troubled', 'student', 'Jenny', 'Hannah', 'Herzsprung', 'prison', 'inmate', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'poster', 'girl', 'Gothic', 'could', 'choose', 'wardrobe', 'victim', 'child', 'abuse', 'convicted', 'brutal', 'murder', 'who', 'most', 'childhood', 'cultivated', 'natural', 'gift', 'music', 'specifically', 'playing', 'piano', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'flame', 'fuse', 'when', 'teacher', 'one', 'only', 'four', 'students', 'prison', 'piano', 'program', 'are', 'few', 'light', 'moments', 'are', 'all-the-more', 'striking', 'sparseness', 'story', 'questions', 'answers', 'viewer', 'characters', 'sufficiently', 'hold', 'interest', 'climax', 'where', 'statements', 'subtle', 'bold', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'gestured', 'acted-out', 'consummate', 'skill', 'Jenny', 'musical', 'piece', 'final', 'competition', 'played', 'packed', 'concert', 'hall', 'intended', 'be', 'Schumann', 'Concert', 'A', 'Minor', 'turning', 'classic-rock', 'mix', 'remarkable', 'style', 'way', 'Jenny', 'final', 'bow', 'teacher', 'audience', 'wrapping', 'up', 'concert', 'relationship', 'conveying', 'understanding', 'reached', 'two', 'expression', 'Jenny', 'face', 'lingers', 'mind', 'story', 'credits', 'roll']",Four Minutes

It seems all the characters in the movie are obsessed with Jenny for one reason or anothert, but Jenny manifests extreme violence towards others and is always very angry(those who are obsessed include the piano teacher, the jailers, psychiatrist, the journalist from der spiegel no less, the father, the fellow inmates, etc.). At no time in the movie one feels sympathetic to Jenny, and one would care less about her piano talent when she beats up her way including almost killing a very nice prison guard who was pleading with the teacher to accept her as a pupil. And then when the teacher does take jenny and devotes herself to helping her, the teacher only gets snarls and animosity from jenny, and at one point Jenny violently assaults the teacher and hits her on the forehead head.. Oh this murderous Jenny who has a talent for music!! There is something missing in this movie that the teacher's focus was only on the music talent of Jenny and she would never engage Jenny beyond that point. Towards the end of the movie, the teacher speaks to jenny with authority to get her to participate in the competition. But we are not convinced why such a stubborn, hard-headed, very angry, violent girl suddenly changes her mind and agrees to participate. Why waste 120 minutes just to get to the point where jenny accepts and changes in a jiffy?

Then one day, Jenny (Hannah Herzsprung)--who is as violent as she is talented--signs up for lessons.What follows is a fresh approach to the mentor-mentee story. Yes, the two main characters have to work out their differences and end up becoming close. And yes, there is the inevitable be-all, end-all competition at the end.  But what makes ""Four Minutes"" stand out is how destructive Jenny is.Viewers are never sure if or when she will snap. You get the feeling that Jenny could kill frail Gertrud anytime she wanted.  And that's what makes it so much more exciting than other films with a similar central relationship. This movie is fierce, not cloying.""Four Minutes"" serves up plenty of tension. Director Chris Kraus has created a seamless film. There are no wasted scenes, and sometimes the camera rapidly turns corners to draws the audience closer to the screen.Herzsprung is mesmerizing as the troubled former prodigy, while Bleibtreu's stiff upper lip and owlish expression invite both discomfort and pity. The film has heartbreak, as well as vibrant bursts of comedy.Skip syrupyVitusand morbidThe Piano Teacher (Unrated Edition).
