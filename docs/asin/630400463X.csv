394945,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630400463X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Clever and witty, `Crimes of the Heart' is a film you just have fun watching; thanks in large part to the splendid performances by Jessica Lange and especially Sissy Spacek (who walked away with an Oscar nomination).The film revolves around three sisters; Lenny, Meg and Babe.  Babe, the youngest, just shot her husband and so this tragic event brings Lenny and Meg together to support her.  Their local community is less accepting of Babe's actions, and even the sisters themselves.  They have constant fights with their own family members, especially the sharp tongued Chick Boyle (played by Tess Harper, who also walked away with a nomination).  As Babe's case gets examined deeper secrets are revealed that shake the sisters to their core, but all the while the experience brings them closer than they've ever been.The film is elevated by the superb performances by most of the cast.  Oscar nominees Specek and Harper are sublime, each wrapping their steal claws around the biting screenplay and injecting their talent into every word.  Harper is quick witted and harsh with her delivery, while Specek is much more playful with her delivery.  Personally I feel that Spacek should have walked away with another Oscar, for her performance is beyond brilliant.  She manages to capture her characters naivety without ever making her weak or `dumb'.  I also truly enjoyed Jessica Lange who balanced out Spacek wonderfully, complimenting her co-star every step of the way.  She delved deep into Meg's own personal issues without ever overshadowing Babe's storyline.Diane Keaton is talented, no doubt, but she is very hit-or-miss with me, and this was a miss.  She play's Lenny as if she were slightly mentally handicapped which takes away from the authenticity.  Yes, she is the sheltered and guarded, inexperienced sister but she plays Lenny almost too reserved for her own good.  Her later scenes are refreshing, but getting there was difficult for her.  She is the films one sour note for me, and the reason I give this a B+ and not an A.  It was very hard to watch her for a lot of her scenes; she made me uncomfortable in her awkwardness.  Thankfully Spacek and Lange work very hard to make up for her, but overall Keaton is an unforgivable mistake.The film is nicely scripted (adapted from the stage play of the same name) and it feels fresh.  It is highly entertaining and engaging from start to finish, with clever dialog and plenty of funny moments.  It is also a very sweet and endearing film, but it is never once syrupy or saccharine.  The film is very light, which works in its favor, for it never bogs us down with too much emotional manipulation.I highly recommend this film for it is truly entertaining from start to finish (in spite of Keaton).  I love Spacek; she is a wonderful actress who just knows how to hit her mark every time.  Throw in the luminous Lange and the biting Harper and you have a slew of noteworthy performances to elevate this highly satisfying film.",4,You can't go wrong when you give Sissy Spacek a script like this...,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2987,"['Clever', 'witty', 'Crimes', 'Heart', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'especially', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'walked', 'away', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'three', 'sisters', 'Lenny', 'Meg', 'Babe', 'Babe', 'youngest', 'just', 'shot', 'husband', 'so', 'tragic', 'event', 'Lenny', 'Meg', 'together', 'support', 'local', 'community', 'less', 'accepting', 'Babe', 'actions', 'even', 'sisters', 'have', 'constant', 'fights', 'own', 'family', 'members', 'especially', 'sharp', 'tongued', 'Chick', 'Boyle', 'played', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'who', 'also', 'walked', 'away', 'nomination', 'Babe', 'case', 'examined', 'deeper', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'shake', 'sisters', 'core', 'experience', 'closer', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been.The', 'film', 'elevated', 'superb', 'performances', 'most', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Specek', 'Harper', 'are', 'sublime', 'wrapping', 'steal', 'claws', 'biting', 'screenplay', 'injecting', 'talent', 'word', 'Harper', 'quick', 'witted', 'harsh', 'delivery', 'Specek', 'much', 'more', 'playful', 'delivery', 'Personally', 'feel', 'Spacek', 'should', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'capture', 'characters', 'naivety', 'ever', 'making', 'weak', 'dumb', 'also', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'who', 'balanced', 'out', 'Spacek', 'wonderfully', 'complimenting', 'co-star', 'step', 'way', 'delved', 'deep', 'Meg', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'ever', 'overshadowing', 'Babe', 'storyline.Diane', 'Keaton', 'talented', 'doubt', 'very', 'hit-or-miss', 'was', 'miss', 'play', 'Lenny', 'were', 'slightly', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'away', 'authenticity', 'Yes', 'sheltered', 'guarded', 'inexperienced', 'sister', 'Lenny', 'almost', 'too', 'reserved', 'own', 'good', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'refreshing', 'getting', 'there', 'was', 'difficult', 'films', 'one', 'sour', 'note', 'reason', 'give', 'B+', 'not', 'A', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'lot', 'scenes', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'awkwardness', 'Thankfully', 'Spacek', 'Lange', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'up', 'overall', 'Keaton', 'unforgivable', 'mistake.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'scripted', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'fresh', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish', 'clever', 'dialog', 'plenty', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'very', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'syrupy', 'saccharine', 'film', 'very', 'light', 'favor', 'never', 'bogs', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'manipulation.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'spite', 'Keaton', 'love', 'Spacek', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'who', 'just', 'how', 'hit', 'mark', 'time', 'Throw', 'luminous', 'Lange', 'biting', 'Harper', 'have', 'slew', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'elevate', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'film']",Crimes of the Heart VHS

The McGrath sisters are an unlikely a set of sister.  Their family was once the pillar of society but now they have fallen from grace.Lenny (Diane Keaton) is the oldest sister, Meg (Jessica Lange) is the middle sister and Babe (Sissy Spacek) is the baby sister.  Each is very different.  Lenny has become a spinster (well she was a spinster even before she was old.)  Meg has always been a free spirit and has fled the small southern town (well, she left a under a cloud.)  Babe had everything come easy to her and married a successful lawyer.  Also, there is cousin Chick (Tess Harper) who married above her station and is quick to point out the sisters faults.As the film starts Lenny is celebrating her birthday, alone.  Babe returns to the family home after shooting, but not killing, her husband.  Meg also returns for a reunion under these unpleasant circumstances.  Of course, what follows is the sisters reopening old wounds.  Meg also opens up one of her own old wounds by reuniting with her high school sweetheart, Doc (Sam Sheppard or Mr. Jessica Lange).  But the big question is why did Babe shoot her husband (Beeson Carroll)?  She won't even tell her own lawyer (David Carpenter).This is a brilliant comedy with great performance by all.  Sissy got the Oscar nomination but all three sisters were great.

Due to the fact that their mother committed suicide when they were young, the three girls have completely different personalities from each other. Lenny, the oldest, is a reticent woman having problems with relationships because she thinks low of herself due of her medical problems. Meg, the middle sister, leaves the family at a young age to pursue a career in Hollywood, only to end up in failure. Babe, the youngest sister, shoots her husband because of the abuse and loneliness through the years. As the days pass, the three sisters come closer again and face each other's difficulties.This was a delightful movie to watch, due to many reasons. Firstly, the entire cast acted wonderfully. When you see names like Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange, you know you are going to see powerful performances of the characters in the movie. They all acted faultlessly in their own way according to their roles. Secondly, Bruce Beresford did a great job in brining Beth Henley's award-winning play to the screen. Furthermore, the background music also added well to the movie.I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you enjoy watching dark-comedy movies, then you will like this one.",5,Crimes of the Heart,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1480,"['Crimes', 'heart', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'play', 'Beth', 'Henley.The', 'story', 'three', 'sisters', 'Lenny', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Meg', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Becky', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'reunite', 'together', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'Babe', 'Becky', 'shoots', 'husband', 'Due', 'fact', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'three', 'girls', 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'personalities', 'other', 'Lenny', 'oldest', 'reticent', 'woman', 'having', 'problems', 'relationships', 'low', 'due', 'medical', 'problems', 'Meg', 'middle', 'sister', 'family', 'young', 'age', 'pursue', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'failure', 'Babe', 'youngest', 'sister', 'husband', 'abuse', 'loneliness', 'years', 'days', 'pass', 'three', 'sisters', 'come', 'closer', 'again', 'face', 'other', 'difficulties.This', 'was', 'delightful', 'movie', 'watch', 'due', 'many', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'entire', 'cast', 'acted', 'wonderfully', 'When', 'see', 'names', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'powerful', 'performances', 'characters', 'movie', 'acted', 'faultlessly', 'own', 'way', 'according', 'roles', 'Secondly', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'brining', 'Beth', 'Henley', 'award-winning', 'play', 'screen', 'Furthermore', 'background', 'music', 'also', 'added', 'well', 'movie.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'dark-comedy', 'movies', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'one']",Crimes of the Heart VHS

(&quot;Cannonball Run&quot; comes to mind.) But &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; is an exception. If Jessica Lange, Diane Keaton and Sissy Spacek weren't absolutely delighted to tackle the lead roles in this film, they are much better actors than I thought.The material is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor, who wrote some of the most humorous, offbeat Southern fiction extant.The three sisters are so controlled by their visceral reactions that one wonders if any of them have ever had an intellectual moment. Although it would be maddening to have such people for friends, they're great instruments for movie comedy.One final note: If anyone thinks Sissy Spacek is goofy-looking (as I used to), they will change their mind when they see her in this.
