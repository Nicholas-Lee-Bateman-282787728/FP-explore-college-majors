334251,A2TDI3MD6FMISO,6302787262,chris,"[0, 0]","Probably the best of the Sarah series.  The best scene is where it rains as Sarah and the children go to Maine and they go outside into the rain and let it pour on them.  They do this because they had been in such drought in Kansas, where Jacob (Christopher Walken) stayed until it rains.  It, like the rest of the series of three, has good morals, going to church, and good for the whole family, of pulling together when times get rough.",5,great,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,438,"['Probably', 'best', 'Sarah', 'series', 'best', 'scene', 'where', 'Sarah', 'children', 'go', 'Maine', 'go', 'outside', 'rain', 'let', 'pour', 'do', 'had', 'been', 'such', 'drought', 'Kansas', 'where', 'Jacob', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'stayed', 'rest', 'series', 'three', 'good', 'morals', 'going', 'church', 'good', 'whole', 'family', 'pulling', 'together', 'when', 'times', 'get', 'rough']",Skylark VHS

334255,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6302787262,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[14, 14]","Skylark makes a promise to the viewer and then fulfills it. Sarah is a mail-order bride from Maine and this is the sequel to ""Sarah, Plain and Tall."" In the first movie, Sarah and Jacob write letters, fall in love and then marry. They are now even more in love and are committed to making their way on the dusty Kansas prairie.Water is so essential to life and the scenes of the Maine coastline contrast with the dusty land in Kansas. Both the land and the sea can call your heart, but only one owns Jacob's soul. The land. It is where he lives and breathes free. His stubbornness is very apparent, yet it is only that he hopes for rain and believes his commitment to the land will be rewarded.As the drought hits, their friends and neighbors start to abandon their farms. Sarah keeps saying she won't leave, yet her heart is not with the land. Together they battle fires with wet ""feed"" sacks. I could smell the fire and feel the coarse sacks because we had to put out a fire once when I lived on a farm in Africa. It is fighting with nature and when you win there is nothing like it.This movie did remind me a bit of the movie: Out of Africa. It had the same quiet stillness and deep thoughtfulness. Glenn Close and Christopher Walken just have to look at one another for sparks to fly onscreen, yet the characters share a smoldering fire.The love between Jacob and Sarah smolders throughout the entire movie and is a tribute to marriage. Even though Sarah says: ""Sometimes what people choose to write down on paper is more important than what they say,"" there are some things that must be shared in person. Sarah leaves the best secret for last.If you have ever felt a love for the earth or inhaled the scent of a newly soaked field....or if you have ever stood in the rain... this is your movie! If you have never lived the country life, indulge your vision and poetic nature. Perhaps soon you will want to travel more or even move away from the city life.A completely enchanting, yet slow paced story focusing more on emotions and family ties. A story about love of family, love of the land and the chance people take when they marry for better or worse. The theme of families being able to stick together in life, is magical and very refreshing. There is something to be said for true love when it comes from a decision to love.The last scene is so poignant, I won't spoil it for you even thought I would love to tell you what Sarah does to solidify her commitment to her man and her country. This is a romantic movie, but is well suited for family viewing. Skylark is as refreshing to the soul as rain is to the parched earth.~The Rebecca Review",5,I dream about rain....,986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,2652,"['Skylark', 'promise', 'viewer', 'then', 'Sarah', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'Maine', 'sequel', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'first', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'write', 'letters', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'marry', 'are', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'love', 'are', 'committed', 'making', 'way', 'dusty', 'Kansas', 'prairie.Water', 'so', 'essential', 'life', 'scenes', 'Maine', 'coastline', 'contrast', 'dusty', 'land', 'Kansas', 'land', 'sea', 'can', 'call', 'heart', 'only', 'one', 'Jacob', 'soul', 'land', 'where', 'breathes', 'free', 'stubbornness', 'very', 'apparent', 'only', 'rain', 'commitment', 'land', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded.As', 'drought', 'hits', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'start', 'abandon', 'farms', 'Sarah', 'saying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'yet', 'heart', 'not', 'land', 'Together', 'battle', 'fires', 'wet', 'feed', 'sacks', 'could', 'smell', 'fire', 'feel', 'coarse', 'sacks', 'had', 'put', 'out', 'fire', 'when', 'lived', 'farm', 'Africa', 'fighting', 'nature', 'when', 'win', 'nothing', 'it.This', 'movie', 'did', 'remind', 'bit', 'movie', 'Africa', 'had', 'same', 'quiet', 'stillness', 'deep', 'thoughtfulness', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'one', 'sparks', 'fly', 'onscreen', 'yet', 'characters', 'share', 'smoldering', 'fire.The', 'love', 'Jacob', 'Sarah', 'smolders', 'entire', 'movie', 'tribute', 'marriage', 'Even', 'Sarah', 'Sometimes', 'what', 'people', 'choose', 'write', 'down', 'paper', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'say', 'are', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'shared', 'person', 'Sarah', 'best', 'secret', 'last.If', 'have', 'ever', 'felt', 'love', 'earth', 'inhaled', 'scent', 'newly', 'soaked', 'field', '.or', 'have', 'ever', 'stood', 'rain', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'lived', 'country', 'life', 'indulge', 'vision', 'poetic', 'nature', 'Perhaps', 'soon', 'will', 'want', 'travel', 'more', 'even', 'move', 'away', 'city', 'life.A', 'completely', 'enchanting', 'yet', 'slow', 'paced', 'story', 'focusing', 'more', 'emotions', 'family', 'ties', 'story', 'love', 'family', 'love', 'land', 'chance', 'people', 'take', 'when', 'marry', 'better', 'worse', 'theme', 'families', 'being', 'able', 'stick', 'together', 'life', 'magical', 'very', 'refreshing', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'true', 'love', 'when', 'decision', 'love.The', 'last', 'scene', 'so', 'poignant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'even', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'tell', 'what', 'Sarah', 'solidify', 'commitment', 'man', 'country', 'romantic', 'movie', 'well', 'suited', 'family', 'viewing', 'Skylark', 'refreshing', 'soul', 'rain', 'parched', 'earth.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Skylark VHS
