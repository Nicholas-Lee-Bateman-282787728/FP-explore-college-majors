Most of the remaining episodes are also excellent-a couple of weaker ones but absolutely no dogs this season. The brothers' fates in Banzai Pipeline is shocking and moving; great Danny episode in Draw Me a Killer; fantastic smart villain in Murder is a Taxing Affair; tragedy and horror in Secret Witness. Many of the episodes feature more team work and interaction among the Five-0 men, which is great to see. There is a lot of fresh original music this season, wonderful scores that really stand out. This is the best season yet for writing, music and acting, even more than season 5.One disappointment is that the remastering of the Wave, which leads into commercial breaks, is really poor. It's very dark and muddy, a real surprise given how clean and bright the earlier seasons have been.  But I'm in it for the stories, the music and Danny's dazzling blue eyes, so I can live with a murky Wave.

The producers decided to film it at what was considered a much faster pace than the other shows of the time.  As a result, we can watch it without losing interest.  The writing and acting were always good, if not great.As to police reality, no show reflects that work because (don't tell anyone) it's mostly legwork and boring research.  Very few gunfights and car chases result from investigations, Hollywood and CSI notwithstanding.So, forgive McGarrett(Jack Lord) for wearing immaculate Brooks Brothers' suits in 90F weather and at a policeman's salary.  It's television.This, the 6th season, was arguably the best one and my recommendation for your 1st experience of the show if you never watched.  The variety and quality of this season (see another reviewer for a show-by-show description)was the zenith of the series.

In the original, the bad guy was an actual amputee; in the new one, it's Peter Weller. The old, hook style, prosthetic arms made the efforts of the villain seem almost heroic.

We have been to Hawaii 4 times in the last 9 years. We love it and can't get enough of it. Last Christmas my sister-in-law gave me a gift card. I had purchased all the Magnum PI seasons that I could so I decided to give H50 a try as my late mother was a faithful 50 fan. I was pleasantly surprised by H50 Season 1.  Now besides Magnum PI and could get my Hawaiian fix between trips with H50. Well we developed a craving for H50 so that I have purchased and viewed all 7 seasons and 3/4 the way through season 8.I have found that all the H50 seasons are great 1 through 8. They seem to get better and better with scripts and settings. The only thing that could have been better is if they had more local actors to mix the blend of them from episode to episode. What I mean by that is in this week's episode you will have one actor playing a really bad guy and next week he or she is back as a good guy. This is a similar pattern that started with The 60's in ""Wild Wild West"" where that used the same group of bit actors over and over again.  Robert Conrad commented that this made them a winning team because of the relationships formed. However this process in any series can be a little monotonous as in ""West"" or in Hawaii 50.The other question came to me: Why wasn't a movie made of H50? If it was good enough for older TV series like the Lone Ranger why not a movie of Hawaii 50?Finally, since I am running out of H50 episodes, I hope that fellow fans like all of you will look at a predecessor of H50 namely ""Hawaiian Eye"" DVDs which are currently Out of Stock by Amazon. If enough of you put yourselves on the ""Wait List"" it would make it available with large requests. In conclusion I recommend all Hawaii 50 seasons 1-8.

The sixth season, which ran from 1973-74 was no different, featuring some of the best stories in the show's twelve-year run.The best and their merits are:""Hookman"" - the season premier with an engaging story about an assassin with hooks for hands.  Jay J. Armes, an actual ""handicapped"" actor is fine in the part with no dialogue, ""speaking"" by his actions.

He eliminates those who he feels is a threat to her.  The installment features another fine score from Stevens.""One Big Happy Family"" - Slim Pickens heads a murderous quintet who when down on funds resorts to deceit and murder.  Stevens scores again, in more ways than one.""Murder is a Taxing Affair"" - Don Porter is a tax man who resorts to murder to get his ""return.""""The Finishing Touch"" - George Voskovec as police ally who hides the fact the he is behind the forging of some bank certificates.  The episode has a great score from Bruce Broughton.""Bonzai Pipeline"" - A tale of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and the ensuing tragedy that befalls the innocent, the episode stars future ""Riptide"" star Perry King and future TV Spiderman Nicholas Hammond as brothers.""Secret Witness"" - Similar in theme as ""Bonzai,"" Mark Jenkins witnesses a mob hit, placing him and his family in jeopardy with the criminals.

Ward ""stephengward""","[8, 10]","Another fine season - perhaps slightly inferior to season 5, but that was a tough act to follow - For me, this is the last of the outstanding Five-0 seasons and yet we're only half way through the twelve year run!Crime dramas today may be more realistic and better acted, but none are anywhere near as entertaining as this show when it was at its peak.So, we've a good selection of engaging episodes with notable mentions for `Hookman'; `Draw Me A Killer'; `One Big Happy Family' and `The Sunday Torch'.Now, I've seen only a handful of episodes on this set thus far and therefore, with regards to the re-mastering, all I can say is that the majority of viewers are unlikely to find fault with it. However, it isn't up to the standard of the re-mastering on, for example, the 1st 3 James Bond movies on ultimate edition dvds or Blu-Ray or other major projects afforded a make-over. However, it is, in comparison to episodes I've watched recorded from live broadcasts on tv, significantly better. That said, `Try to Die On Time' contains a scene where, for a brief few seconds, vertical lines appear over Jack Lord's face - granted, the image is nice and clear with vibrant colours, but the fact the lines haven't been cleaned up is testament to the lack of the highest quality re-mastering.  Audio wise, again, for the episodes I've seen, there seems to be much more bass than in previous season - Hookman almost vibrated the ornaments of the mantel piece!Have the shows been edited - yes - will this bother most people, frankly no - testament to this is the continuing high sales of these DVDs despite the disclaimer on the outside of the box. The edits are, in the main, innocuous - in fact nobody can provide a definitive list of what has or hasn't been included. That said, we know that any edits which may have occurred to be minor, the run time of 50 to 51 minutes demonstrates this. When all said and done, these are good value for money considering what you get. If you want totally unabridged episodes with the highest standard of re-mastering and maybe the option of a 5.1 soundtrack, I suggest you wait or lobby Paramount for a definitive collection that will please the purest of perfectionists. In the meantime, enjoy one of the greatest and entertaining police dramas from stateside.",5,Aloha!,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,2296,"['fine', 'season', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'inferior', 'season', '5', 'was', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'last', 'outstanding', 'Five-0', 'seasons', 'yet', ""'re"", 'only', 'half', 'way', 'twelve', 'year', 'run', 'Crime', 'dramas', 'today', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'better', 'acted', 'none', 'are', 'anywhere', 'as', 'entertaining', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'peak.So', ""'ve"", 'good', 'selection', 'engaging', 'episodes', 'notable', 'mentions', 'Hookman', 'Draw', 'Me', 'A', 'Killer', 'One', 'Big', 'Happy', 'Family', 'Sunday', ""Torch'.Now"", ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'set', 'thus', 'far', 'therefore', 'regards', 're-mastering', 'can', 'say', 'majority', 'viewers', 'are', 'unlikely', 'find', 'fault', 'However', ""n't"", 'up', 'standard', 're-mastering', 'example', '1st', '3', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'dvds', 'Blu-Ray', 'other', 'major', 'projects', 'afforded', 'make-over', 'However', 'comparison', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'recorded', 'live', 'broadcasts', 'tv', 'significantly', 'better', 'said', 'Try', 'Die', 'Time', 'contains', 'scene', 'where', 'brief', 'few', 'seconds', 'vertical', 'lines', 'appear', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'face', 'granted', 'image', 'nice', 'clear', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'fact', 'lines', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'testament', 'lack', 'highest', 'quality', 're-mastering', 'Audio', 'wise', 'again', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'bass', 'previous', 'season', 'Hookman', 'almost', 'vibrated', 'ornaments', 'mantel', 'piece', 'Have', 'shows', 'been', 'edited', 'yes', 'will', 'most', 'people', 'frankly', 'testament', 'continuing', 'high', 'sales', 'DVDs', 'disclaimer', 'outside', 'box', 'edits', 'are', 'main', 'innocuous', 'fact', 'nobody', 'can', 'provide', 'definitive', 'list', 'what', ""n't"", 'been', 'included', 'said', 'know', 'edits', 'may', 'have', 'occurred', 'be', 'minor', 'run', 'time', '50', '51', 'minutes', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'are', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'considering', 'what', 'get', 'want', 'totally', 'unabridged', 'episodes', 'highest', 'standard', 're-mastering', 'maybe', 'option', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'suggest', 'wait', 'lobby', 'Paramount', 'definitive', 'collection', 'will', 'please', 'purest', 'perfectionists', 'meantime', 'enjoy', 'one', 'greatest', 'entertaining', 'police', 'dramas', 'stateside']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 6
