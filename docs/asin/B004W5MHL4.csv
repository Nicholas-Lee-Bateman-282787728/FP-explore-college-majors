These characters were bits and pieces of so many families (including my own) I knew growing up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.  There were so many little details (props, furniture, scenery, etc.) in the background that seemed so exact.  I felt like I was watching 8mm home movies.  The actors really picked up the accent and attitude.  It's as if I knew them. It seems as though everytime they make a movie about Brooklyn, something horrible happens at the end.  The conflict and climax are considered critical to good storytelling (here it was predictable), but character development with good acting and strong dialogue can (in my opinion) compensate for a predicable and week plot.  If anyone wants to experience Bay Ridge, Brooklyn before Disco and John Travolta made it cliche, watch this incredible film.  I had many Brooklynites I know on Facebook check it out and they ALL agree.  It is the working class Brooklyn of 1975 were alcoholism and brutishness was so common it seemed normal.

1430380,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004W5MHL4,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","So is the chant of these Brooklyn buddies circa 1975. They're Irish blue collar and proud of it.Here's the scoop. Brian and Danny Leary are brothers. Brian is a budding artist but keeps his works under wraps. Danny is a tough and will probably end up in the joint. Their dad (the now ubiquitous Stephen Lang) is a tough, drunk, brute of a man. Mom (Karen Allen) is trying to hold things together but it's a losing battle. The problem is, the neighborhood is what it is and few have any aspirations of doing better for themselves. Danny hatches a scheme to rip off the local theatre owner (Peter Riegert) during a one night only Rolling Stones concert. Things don't go well.This is mostly a slice of lifer kind of flick. You meet the family and the friends of Brian and Danny. They figure low-level public service (garbage man or train operator) is the way to go. No disco. No drugs. Just hang at the bar and drink away their paychecks. Brian might find a way out through his art and entertains the thought even more so when a local girl with whom he flirts gets an opportunity to move to L.A. working for a travel agency. The writing and performances are good which is what helps make this film work. It was fun seeing Karen Allen. She's now too old to be cute so she gets to settle in and play her character which she does well. Stephen Lang has a long career, but I first remember seeing him in ""Avatar,"" and now he's getting some higher profile roles. He plays the drunk, Irish brute quite well and does a nice turn near the end. The boys are both good. Brian particularly has great camera face and he handles his role well. There are a few clunky scenes as the climax approaches, but that turned out to be a surprise so I'll give those a pass. About the only thing I didn't like was the music. It was mostly blues based rock but it was generic. Not one tune stood out with any authority.The four stars I gave it might be a bit generous but only a bit. This is a heck of a watch for anyone into this sort of thing.",4,No Weed. No Pills.

From an under-privileged neighborhood, Brian's social group fails to understand that college could be anything but an excuse not to get a job.  Brian is torn between art and the criminal proclivities of his manipulative and abused older brother, Danny.  He may be from a rough neighborhood, but he's a sweet, boyish twenty-or-so with an aw-shucks smile and Elijah Wood's innocence.  Hearing the newfound insights of a friend, Brian begins to dream that college could be his way out of this world which he undeniably uses to temper his self-worth.Stephen Lang (Avatar, TV's Terra Nova) performs excellently as the callous, abusive father.  Karen Allen brilliantly plays his overworked wife whose Herculean efforts fail to hold the family together as she casts a blind eye to her husband's actions.  Most interactions with the parents are difficult, but there are some soothingly endearing moments like recurring teasing about mom's cooking and nearly forgotten memories of how dad was before he got like this.Drawing our attention is Brian's artwork.  The director carefully utilized this pathway to steer the plot, educe mood and engage undertones about Brian's fragile relationships with the small world he knew, his crumbling family, and his own self doubt.",5,"A sincere, cathartic, jagged little pill that offers a certain something",1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,1501,"['sincere', 'cathartic', 'jagged', 'little', 'pill', 'certain', 'something', 'form', 'closure', 'akin', 'Boy', 'Life', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting.Our', 'witty', 'quippy', 'sharp-tongued', 'yet', 'plausibly', 'average', 'star', 'palpable', 'mid-70', 'Brooklyn', 'under-privileged', 'neighborhood', 'Brian', 'social', 'group', 'understand', 'college', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'excuse', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'Brian', 'torn', 'art', 'criminal', 'proclivities', 'manipulative', 'abused', 'older', 'brother', 'Danny', 'may', 'be', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'sweet', 'boyish', 'twenty-or-so', 'aw-shucks', 'smile', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'innocence', 'Hearing', 'newfound', 'insights', 'friend', 'Brian', 'dream', 'college', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'world', 'undeniably', 'temper', 'self-worth.Stephen', 'Lang', 'Avatar', 'TV', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'excellently', 'callous', 'abusive', 'father', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'brilliantly', 'overworked', 'wife', 'Herculean', 'efforts', 'fail', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'blind', 'eye', 'husband', 'actions', 'Most', 'interactions', 'parents', 'are', 'difficult', 'are', 'soothingly', 'endearing', 'moments', 'recurring', 'teasing', 'mom', 'cooking', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'how', 'dad', 'was', 'got', 'this.Drawing', 'attention', 'Brian', 'artwork', 'director', 'carefully', 'utilized', 'pathway', 'steer', 'plot', 'educe', 'mood', 'engage', 'undertones', 'Brian', 'fragile', 'relationships', 'small', 'world', 'knew', 'crumbling', 'family', 'own', 'self', 'doubt']",N/A

However it is actually a really well observed film and had me gripped through out. Like the main character here Brian (Nick Thurston) I am a first generation Irish man and so much of the back plot rang true for me. Brian is the younger of two brothers, the elder brother Danny played by Geoffrey Wigdor (`Sleepers') is the Black Sheep and has just come out of prison, he is a cheap street hustler and would be thief. Brian is the thoughtful one who wants to work at the local cinema/rock venue and paint his pictures of urban street life in the shared basement.Brian has a circle of friends who range from being a proud garbage collector, to a computer pioneer, the only thing they still have in common is their heritage, hatred of disco, love of alcohol and the fact they are white Irish drinkers and they bring some welcome humour to the proceedings.They have a loving, hard working mother and a hard working, violent, drunken and abusive father. Violence is never far away from the surface when he is around and especially so when he has a skin full, which is pretty much most of the time - a situation I can empathise with. While Brian tries to find love and meaning in his life, Danny seeks only to steal and get away from Brooklyn and a life of being a punch bag, forever. The thing is he loves his brother despite their differences and wants/needs him to get what he wants. Things can only go wrong, but the thing is for who and how ruddy bad?I really loved this film, it was gritty and dirty and had lots of unnecessary violence, but it struck a nerve with me that meant I could associate with Brian and his hopes and losses. The music is very good too and was done by Mark Snow. It is set in 1975 and the period detail looks quite authentic, they could have made more of the hair do's though and flares but not to worry. A film full of stereotypes that manages to present them in a real and human way and does not pull its punches.",5,"Brooklyn, 1975, Booze, Irishmen and The Rolling Stones!",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,2076,"['thought', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'whole', 'basis', 'movie', 'extent', 'was', 'right', 'However', 'actually', 'really', 'well', 'observed', 'film', 'had', 'gripped', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'Brian', 'Nick', 'Thurston', 'am', 'first', 'generation', 'Irish', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'plot', 'rang', 'true', 'Brian', 'younger', 'two', 'brothers', 'elder', 'brother', 'Danny', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Wigdor', 'Sleepers', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'just', 'come', 'prison', 'cheap', 'street', 'hustler', 'would', 'be', 'thief', 'Brian', 'thoughtful', 'one', 'who', 'work', 'local', 'cinema/rock', 'venue', 'paint', 'pictures', 'urban', 'street', 'life', 'shared', 'basement.Brian', 'circle', 'friends', 'who', 'range', 'being', 'proud', 'garbage', 'collector', 'computer', 'pioneer', 'only', 'thing', 'still', 'have', 'common', 'heritage', 'hatred', 'disco', 'love', 'alcohol', 'fact', 'are', 'white', 'Irish', 'drinkers', 'bring', 'welcome', 'humour', 'proceedings.They', 'have', 'loving', 'hard', 'working', 'mother', 'hard', 'working', 'violent', 'drunken', 'abusive', 'father', 'Violence', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'surface', 'when', 'around', 'especially', 'so', 'when', 'skin', 'full', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'time', 'situation', 'can', 'empathise', 'Brian', 'tries', 'find', 'love', 'meaning', 'life', 'Danny', 'only', 'steal', 'get', 'away', 'Brooklyn', 'life', 'being', 'punch', 'bag', 'forever', 'thing', 'brother', 'differences', 'get', 'what', 'Things', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'wrong', 'thing', 'who', 'how', 'ruddy', 'bad', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'had', 'lots', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'struck', 'nerve', 'meant', 'could', 'associate', 'Brian', 'hopes', 'losses', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'was', 'done', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'set', '1975', 'period', 'detail', 'quite', 'authentic', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'hair', 'do', 'though', 'flares', 'not', 'worry', 'film', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'present', 'real', 'human', 'way', 'not', 'pull', 'punches']",N/A
