792372,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00013RC2K,A Customer,"[3, 7]","Summary:Tracy Freeland (Evan Rachel Wood) seems to have a good life, but apparently she has a secret desire to experience the, how shall we say this, 'hot' life.  During her first day of the 7th grade, Tracy sees Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed), the 'hottest' girl in school, and watches as all of the guys drool over her, including her own brother, Mason (Brady Corbet).  Even though Tracy has a number of supportive and intelligent friends, her hidden desire to be popular and have guys objectify her wins in the end.So, the next day, she does her best to put together an outfit she thinks will impress Evie and, to Tracy's surprise, it does, resulting in Evie giving Tracy her cell phone number (at least, so Tracy thinks) and inviting her to go shopping with her on Melrose Street.  Tracy proceeds to call it after school, but realizes it isn't the right number. Undaunted, she heads down to Melrose Street anyway and happens upon Evie.  She doesn't have much money, but neither does Evie, who doesn't let her lack of funds prevent her from taking whatever she wants.  Not knowing what to do, Tracy leaves the store only to happen upon a businesswoman who turns her back on her purse while sitting next to Tracy on a bench.  Tracy, stepping over the line between good girl and bad girl, takes the woman's wallet and with her newly found cash, proceeds to become Evie's best friend.Thus ensues a disastrous four months during which Evie introduces Tracy to her world of drugs, sex, and lies.  Surprisingly, Tracy takes to it like an old pro.  But there is a hitch... Tracy's mother, Melanie 'Mel' Freeland (Holly Hunter), isn't willing to watch her daughter turn into a drug-using slut.  Despite Mel's best efforts, which are hampered by a blemished past of her own and an on again/off again relationship with a reformed dopehead named Brady (Jeremy Sisto), Tracy descends into chaos, only to catch a glimpse of the error of her ways when she realizes she is failing every single class in school and is going to be held back a year.Trying to put some distance between herself and Evie to pull herself out of the mess she is in only makes things worse as Evie's drug-dealing is finally discovered by her cousin, Brooke (Deborah Unger).  But Evie is quick enough to blame Tracy and plant enough evidence in Evie's room to make it seem convincing.  The result is a final showdown in which Mel confronts Tracy and they both breakdown, realizing it's time to take care of the problem.My Comments:I wasn't particularly excited to watch this movie as I'm a 27 year-old, non-drinking, non drug-using, monogamous male; I really didn't think I would be able to relate at all.  And, frankly, I couldn't.  But I did at least appreciate what the movie was trying to say.As far as the story goes, if you allow for the initial suspension of belief required for Tracy to throw away a happy life to become one of the 'hotties', the story works quite well.  Some may not think this decision warrants a suspension of belief, but as I never found the 'hot' crowd alluring, I have to consign this decision to the 'suspension of belief' category.  Also, what proceeds after this decision (the drugs, sex, etc.) is really like talking the worst of the worst stories from a number of people and putting it all together into one story.  At least, that's my take on it.  I'm sure some people have experienced something like this, but Tracy had so many things fall apart so fast that it really seemed to be the exaggerated version of what could happen.  (I'm sure someone will read this review and say that it wasn't an exaggeration; and to that person I say, ""Sorry, but I'm glad I'm not you."")Additionally, there are a couple of problems with the story, primarily in plot lines and characters that are introduced but never satisfactorily concluded.  One particularly memorable one is a scene in which Tracy is accosted by two girls who seem to think she has fronted them in some way.  But somebody happens to show up (who that somebody was isn't very clear) and they disappear, never to return again.  There are a number of sequences like this when characters are introduced but then never reappear, include a very brief scene with Tracy's father.But undoubtedly the biggest problem with the story was the pacing.  This movie seemed like it lasted three hours.  It went on and on and on and in all the places where it desperately needed some music to speed things up, there was absolute silence.  Even though the movie was only 99 minutes long, it could easily have been cut 20 minutes and have told the same story.Where this movie redeems itself is in the acting.  I have to admit I was very impressed.  The entire cast (with the exception of a couple of the very, very peripheral characters) was very good.  Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, especially, were incredible.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Evan Rachel Wood, but she delivered a powerful, convincing, and even disturbing performance.  And though Holly Hunter had her awkward moments when I thought her interpretation of the role was a bizarre (e.g., rubbing Tracy's head and body and kissing all the way up Tracy's arm at the end), I have to admit she was very good.Overall, I'm not sure whether I should recommend this movie.  It's tricky because liking it will likely depends your approach to child-rearing.  Let me explain.  The movie shows people what can (and does) happen.  Some people prefer to inform their children and then let them make the decision.  Others prefer to keep them ignorant with the hope of keeping them safe.  I'm inclined toward the initial approach, believing at heart that rational people will tend toward rational decisions given adequate information, so I guess I would recommend it (though be prepared for a long and drawn out film).  But if your considering showing this movie to your teenager and your parenting approach is to keep children naive in the vain hope that they will never discover these things, I'm guessing you'll want to skip this one.",3,Great acting but slow,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,6027,"['Summary', 'Tracy', 'Freeland', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'have', 'good', 'life', 'apparently', 'secret', 'desire',

Tracy is played by the gifted Evan Rachel Wood (Once and Again). Wood is so good in this film that you will forget that she is not of legal age. Holly Hunter plays her mom Mel, sometimes I felt like throwing her character against a wall, you just want to wake her mother up and tell her what's wrong with this situation. I really enjoyed the audio commentary by the director and co-writer Nikki Reed, also features Wood. This film was shot in less than a month and had a very small budget. But this film is haunting and i love how the director changes the color to absolute drainage towards the end of the film. You will be astonished by Wood, she will proabably revceive an oscar in the next 10 years. This is a film you have to watch, especially if you are a parent of a teen.The scenes where Tracy is cutting herself are a little graphic and intense but this problem is really happening to young girls in America.

Because, quite simply, this is perhaps the single most accurate portrait of contemporary adolescence I've ever seen. Director Catherine Hardwicke tells her story of a 13-year-old girl, Tracy, and her descent into drug abuse, self-mutilation, theft and promiscuity, with a clear-eyed intimacy that neither glamorizes nor preaches.This is an important movie that kids and parents can watch and discuss together. Unlike the &quot;just say no&quot; propaganda of government fiction, Thirteen doesn't lie. Instead, it tells difficults truths -- that adults can be flawed, imperfect, and sometimes just plain wrong, that it's natural to wish to alter our bodies and minds when we cannot change what's outside, and that love, courage and faith can still survive in the midst of this, our very human predicament. The acting is first-rate:  Holly Hunter does a stunning job as Tracy's mom, a recovering alcoholic prone to some bad choices herself; cowriter Nicki Reed is disturbingly convincing as Tracy's best galpal and bad influence, and Evan Rachel Wood turns in an unforgettable Tracy.

Of course, not all the kids are going to fall on those addictions, but there are a lot of teenagers that do fall. &quot;Thirteen&quot; is a movie that tells the story of Tracy, a young girl that takes the easy way.Tracy is played by the young actress Evan Rachel Wood, and Evan does an excellent job, she makes her character believable at all time, she has a lot of screen presence and she could be one of the best actresses of her generation, she is pretty and talented. Another young actress, Nikki Reed plays the role of Evie Zamora, the popular girl that drags Tracy to the addictions. Nikki also co-wrote the screenplay of &quot;Thirteen&quot;, the other writer is Catherine Hardwicke, she also directs the movie.There are a couple of things that I love about &quot;Thirteen&quot;. Number one, this is a movie that showcases female talent (to the previous names, add the name of another actress, Holly Hunter), &quot;Thirteen&quot; shows that an all-girl team can make a very good movie. So if you don't want to see this film because you think it's a girly movie, get rid of that idea, &quot;Thirteen&quot; is a powerful movie. The other thing that I love about &quot;Thirteen&quot; is the fact that the movie doesn't try to preach, the typical message of &quot;don't do this, is bad&quot; doesn't exist in &quot;Thirteen&quot;. The film looks so real that one might think that this a documentary.

792382,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00013RC2K,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The first time I watched `thirteen' I was stunned at how brutally honest a film it was.  It's so easy for Hollywood to sugar-coat reality to make it accessible but here that is far from the case.  In it's honesty though it never crosses the line in becoming so overtly dramatic and edgy that it comes across forced and in other words Hollywoodized.  `thirteen' stays true and relatable and effortlessly absorbing.  While watching the film I found my heart invested in the story, in the characters and in their eventuality.  I really cared for everyone involved in different ways and for different reasons.  The cast, I should immediately point out, is so brilliant here that they really help keep this film true to form and each actress adds layers of honesty to her performance.Evan Rachel Wood blew me away with her performance as Tracy Freeman.  Tracy is your average thirteen year old girl.  She's awkward around boys, teased at school, distant from the popular girls, estranged from her parents, longing to be accepted by her peers as well as her father.  Her whole life seems a waste.  Her mother Melanie is a recovering alcoholic who damages her family with her choice of male companions but who is genuinely trying to make things good again for her children.  Tracy's father is never around to lend a hand in the matter and can't seem to find the time in his schedule to give his daughter the attention she needs.  In order to vent her frustration and find some control Tracy resorts to smoking and cutting.Tracy them meets Evie Zamora, the popular girl in school.  She's overly sexual, malicious and dangerous and these qualities immediately draw Tracy in.  She begins to conform to Evie's standards and a shift begins to take place in Tracy's attitude and her actions.  Melanie, the maternal instinct kicking in, spots this change early on but is unable to take evasive action.  Evie's family life is tragic as well.  Her parents are no where to be seen and her cousin who acts as her guardian is so uninvolved and lenient with Evie that her behavior, as drastic and outlandish as it is, is welcomed, even encouraged.  Melanie sees this and feels almost guilted into accepting this girl, a girl who gets no real love and attention elsewhere.  While Tracy distances herself further from her mother, Evie uses this opportunity to attach herself, reaching out to that motherly concern, love and guidance she's lacked all her life.The film spirals down to a breathtaking ending that resolves much and brings to the fore true intentions.  It's beautifully scripted by director Catherine Hardwicke and co-star Nikki Reed, who plays Evie.  Reed is tragic as Evie, really captures the essence of this girl lost in the shuffle and her breakdown in the end of this film is beautifully captured in all its raw reality.  Her character finally emerges in truth and honesty before everyone's eyes and as her exposure is made clear the sheer brilliance of her performance is made manifest as well.  Holly Hunter well deserved her Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Melanie is sincere and heartbreaking.  But no one here deserves more praise than Evan Rachel Wood who devours her role and delivers such tempered and controlled emotions, delivering believability and honesty in each brilliantly calculated move.  Watching her character transform in each scene is effortless and captivating.`thirteen' may be hard to stomach sometimes, especially if you're a parent, and even more so if you are a parent of a young daughter.  As much as it may remain difficult I feel it's also very important that you force yourself through it.  It exposes quite well the dangers surrounding young girls today, from the desires and pressures to conform to your peers and the enticing effects of drugs, alcohol and sex, vices that are becoming more and more accessible to kids of younger and younger ages.  Directed with equal measures grit and concern, `thirteen' is a landmark film that sheds a much needed light on the dangers of adolescence and is one of the more moving and socially important films of the past decade.

It may be because they are so ignorant as to believe that this stuff ""doesn't happen in real life"" or that this is way ""overacted."" I'm not pin-pointing anybody - I've been reading those very statements over and over again.Where this movie excels in must is definetly in the actual acting. I was totally apalled (in a good way) with Reed's and Wood's amazing performences as two troubled teenage girls. I can see why many people would get upset over the mother's reaction to her daughter's sudden transformation but believe it or not, *that's what really happens.* How do I know? Well, I've been through this very experiance (not necessarily through the parent's stand point, mind you). How else is a parent supposed to act when one minute, she's her daughter's best friend and then all off a sudden, her daughter is mimicking styles only street walkers would be caught wearing (or just really rebellious girls). It's this kind of shocking behavior that can really catch a mother off guard.Now my favorite part of the movie. The actual real-ness of it all, that place where people are totally in denial over. I can't tell you how many people I've talked to who just can't believe the behavior of these two young girls. Well, get over it. Because what you see in this movie (and, oh my god, believe it or not) IS TOTALLY REAL. I really can't see why people are so shocked by it all. What you see is real -  girls sneaking out of movie theaters, have threesomes with boys and snorting up coke. It's this kind of behavior that people see all the time in high school. Shocking? I don't think so.I really do have to give it to Nikki Reed for her coureagous act to actually write this script.

I only hope parents are watching this film, though as is typical, movies like this preach to the choir, and those who should be seeing them aren't.This film is visceral in the same way &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is, though Catherine Hardwicke keeps a tighter rein on her project than Darren Aronofsky did his.  She indulges in some of the same stylistic excesses--the frenzied camera work, the digitized color, the pounding soundtrack--but they don't overwhelm her actors.  And indeed, it's the actors who deserve the lion's share of praise for this film.  Evan Rachel Wood absolutely astounds as Tracy.  I know vaguely of the T.V. show she starred in, but I wouldn't have been able to pick her out of a crowd before seeing her here.  Her performance is raw and scary--I don't know what real-life resources this young actress is drawing from, but she convinced me that she was a teenager teetering on the brink of disaster.  Nikki Reed, who co-wrote the screenplay, is very good as well, but has a decidedly more supporting, less involved role.  And Holly Hunter, a reliable veteran, delivers the goods as well as Tracy's mom.  Her final emotional show-down with Tracy is one of the most affecting coups de theatre I saw this year.Hardwicke's use of enhanced color is unnecessary and distracting---it's too obvious and stylized and blunts the effects of the film's realistic approach. Ditto the MTV editing style---at times this movie looks like a Noxzeema commercial from Hell.  This is obviously intentional---we are meant to understand that these girls are only trying to live up to expectations places upon them by an all-pervading consumer culture that demands perfection.  But I wouldn't have minded a more subtle approach to those conclusions--I don't need them crammed down my throat.  However, as I said, this quality might ruin a lesser film, but doesn't this one because of its phenomenal performances and genuine commitment to the tragic story it wants to tell.Grade: A",4,Packs a Punch,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2506,"['quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'literal', 'punches', 'being', 'thrown', 'best', 'friends', 'Tracy', 'Evie', 'are', 'slugging', 'other', 'prove', 'how', 'numb', 'are', 'huffing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Tracy', 'bedroom', 'unrelenting', 'aggressiveness', 'penultimate', 'quiet', 'moment.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'teenage', 'years', 'were', 'nothing', 'what', 'depicted', 'screen', 'here', 'have', 'cold', 'feeling', 'pit', 'stomach', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'not', 'top', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'only', 'hope', 'parents', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'as', 'typical', 'movies', 'preach', 'choir', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'seeing', ""aren't.This"", 'film', 'visceral', 'same', 'way', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'though', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'tighter', 'rein', 'project', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'did', 'same', 'stylistic', 'excesses', 'frenzied', 'camera', 'work', 'digitized', 'color', 'pounding', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'actors', 'indeed', 'actors', 'who', 'deserve', 'lion', 'share', 'praise', 'film', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'absolutely', 'Tracy', 'know', 'vaguely', 'T.V', 'show', 'starred', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pick', 'crowd', 'seeing', 'here', 'performance', 'raw', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'real-life', 'resources', 'young', 'actress', 'drawing', 'convinced', 'was', 'teenager', 'teetering', 'brink', 'disaster', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'decidedly', 'more', 'supporting', 'less', 'involved', 'role', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'reliable', 'veteran', 'goods', 'as', 'well', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'final', 'emotional', 'show-down', 'Tracy', 'one', 'most', 'affecting', 'coups', 'theatre', 'saw', 'year.Hardwicke', 'use', 'enhanced', 'color', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', '-it', 'too', 'obvious', 'stylized', 'effects', 'film', 'realistic', 'approach', 'Ditto', 'MTV', 'editing', 'style', '-at', 'times', 'movie', 'Noxzeema', 'commercial', 'Hell', 'obviously', 'intentional', '-we', 'are', 'meant', 'understand', 'girls', 'are', 'only', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'places', 'all-pervading', 'consumer', 'culture', 'perfection', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'conclusions', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'crammed', 'down', 'throat', 'However', 'said', 'quality', 'might', 'ruin', 'lesser', 'film', ""n't"", 'one', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'genuine', 'commitment', 'tragic', 'story', 'tell.Grade']",Thirteen
792390,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B00013RC2K,Brian Markowski,"[3, 8]","First the good, ""Thirteen"" is a well acted horror of a story. Newbi teenager Tracy, the product of what appears to be a dysfunctional low-income household, seeks attention from Evie, the popular girl at school. Evie (played by Nikki Reed) is a selfish, shallow, vain, overly developed, mess of a young girl. To get ""in"" with Evie, Tracy steals a stranger's wallet to fund an impromptu shopping spree. A friendship is made and over the course of the next four months and the girls end up using each other to their own self-destruction. It's an interesting spiral to watch, the characters are well written and the situations do feel real (this in part to Nikki Reed's own experience as a teenager which she interjected into the script as co-author). I have seen few films that capture, so well, the utter pain, confusion, and need for attention that some teenagers go through.Now the bad, to make this movie work however, things are exaggerated and accelerated. Tracy goes from a pig tailed sweetheart to a teenage tramp, engaging in threesomes, piercing, drug use, and theft in the matter of four short months. The film has been promoted as a ""wake up call"" to parents, and though the scenarios feel real, the overall situation seems forced. Most parents will not have to face these problems and for those that do, there seems to be few answers. In the film, Tracy's mom (Holly Hunter) has a hard time finding a line to draw for her daughter, which is heartbreakingly accurate, but the movie never provides us with a solution. Tracy's mom never really draws that line and Tracy is only saved by luck.The director Catherine Hardwicke tells a good story but gets a little too clever with some of her shots. Her creativity is put to good use in the beginning of the film when Tracy and Nikki size each other up by what they are both wearing, but that creativity is lacking near the end of the movie when Tracy and her mom fight. To show the turmoil, Hardwick rocks the camera, it's a amateurish move that makes their fight look like something out of the old Batman TV show.""Thirteen"" is a good movie; it's just not a great movie.",3,A Strong Message to Wack You Over the Head With... 3 1/2 Stars,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2125,"['First', 'good', 'Thirteen', 'well', 'acted', 'horror', 'story', 'Newbi', 'teenager', 'Tracy', 'product', 'what', 'be', 'dysfunctional', 'low-income', 'household', 'attention', 'Evie', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Evie', 'played', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'selfish', 'shallow', 'vain', 'overly', 'developed', 'mess', 'young', 'girl', 'get', 'Evie', 'Tracy', 'stranger', 'wallet', 'fund', 'impromptu', 'shopping', 'spree', 'friendship', 'made', 'course', 'next', 'four', 'months', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'using', 'other', 'own', 'self-destruction', 'interesting', 'spiral', 'watch', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'situations', 'do', 'feel', 'real', 'part', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'own', 'experience', 'teenager', 'interjected', 'script', 'co-author', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'capture', 'so', 'well', 'utter', 'pain', 'confusion', 'need', 'attention', 'teenagers', 'go', 'bad', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'however', 'things', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'accelerated', 'Tracy', 'pig', 'tailed', 'sweetheart', 'teenage', 'tramp', 'engaging', 'threesomes', 'piercing', 'drug', 'use', 'theft', 'matter', 'four', 'short', 'months', 'film', 'been', 'promoted', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'parents', 'scenarios', 'feel', 'real', 'overall', 'situation', 'forced', 'Most', 'parents', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'face', 'problems', 'do', 'be', 'few', 'answers', 'film', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'line', 'draw', 'daughter', 'heartbreakingly', 'accurate', 'movie', 'never', 'solution', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'never', 'really', 'line', 'Tracy', 'only', 'saved', 'luck.The', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'good', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'shots', 'creativity', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'Tracy', 'Nikki', 'size', 'other', 'up', 'what', 'are', 'wearing', 'creativity', 'lacking', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'fight', 'show', 'turmoil', 'Hardwick', 'camera', 'amateurish', 'move', 'fight', 'look', 'something', 'old', 'Batman', 'TV', 'show', 'Thirteen', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'movie']",Thirteen

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 5]","Catherine Hardwicke is red hot right now due to her direction of Twilight, which is a huge block buster with box office receipts that guarantee a sequel--but guess who won't be directing said sequel? It doesn't seem fair that she won't get to milk the cash cow she spawned, but perhaps it is best, as she would no doubt chaff under the restrictions imposed upon her. She is an indie director through and through, though with her uncanny knack for feeling the pulse of the youth market she will no doubt strike gold again. She discovered the vampire novels of Stephenie Meyers through her younger pals, and at a book signing she saw immediately the strong reaction and fan loyalty the books engendered. Indeed, author Stephenie Meyers had laid the groundwork herself by social networking, blogging and emailing her fans, even reviewing fan fiction based on her characters.Two of Catherine's other films also benefited from her ability to see the world from the younger point-of-view: The Lords of Dogtown; and the film I will review here, thirteen. Dogtown was a great film about the skate scene. My favorite Hardwicke story from that is when she got so carried away directing a skateboard scene in a drained swimming pool that she fell in and had to be rushed to the hospital. When she woke up, she had a flashback, because the doctor was speaking the exact same lines of dialogue from her script, from when one of the skaters had an accident. It is that kind of reckless passion that she brings to her films.--------------------[first lines]Tracy: Hit me. I'm serious; I can't feel anything, hit me! Again, do it harder! I can't feel anything, this is awesome!===================================thirteen tells the story of a strained relationship between a mother (Holly Hunter) and daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) as the daughter goes through a rebellious adolescent phase of shoplifting, drugs, and cutting herself with a razor blade, spurred on by her friend Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed), a popular but troubled teen who envies the relatively stable home she has.------------[as underage Evie tries to seduce him]Luke: No. Bad. Danger, Will Robinson, danger.=============================The script was written by Nikki Reed in only six days, based on her own experience, which was closer to the daughter character than the part she played. Director Hardwicke collaborated on the script, shaping the raw material and probably projecting herself into the mother role, if you will forgive me a little amateur psychoanalysis.---------------------[Tracy is on the phone in a tattoo shop]Tracy: Hey Mom, do you know what point-slope form is? No, me neither. See? That's why I need to be here... at the library.==================================Holly Hunter is great as the mom, trying to be her daughter's best friend, but with her own issues, and a boyfriend (Jeremy Sisto) just out of rehab it's a difficult task. Sisto was familiar from his role on the popular TV show, ""Law & Order"" where he plays Detective Cyrus Lupo. Here he seems like he is trying to be a father figure, but as an ex-addict, he has neither her respect nor the patience to deal with her trauma drama.----------------Tracy: So, Brady, how was the halfway house?Brady: Same as the last one, Tracy.==============================Though her mom wants to be her best friend, what she really needs is a mom, and a dad would be nice, too. Unfortunately, her dad (D.W. Moffett) sees her so rarely that he really can't comprehend what her problem is and what she needs. Her brother, Mason (Brady Corbett) doesn't get along with her so great, either. Sometimes he is annoyed, sometimes he is horrified, and sometimes he is in awe of the fast track she is on:--------------------Tracy: Hey Mason, who would you say is the hottest girl in school?Mason: Evie Zamora.Tracy: Guess who I hung out with today.Mason: Bull.Tracy: Melrose Avenue. (Mason looks at her in awe) What? Like that's so hard to believe...==================================thirteen is a shocking and heavy movie, all the more shocking to think that lots of teens are going through this. For instance, cutting your arm with a razor blade seems to be so irrational yet it is all too common. It seems that these problems are even worse in Hollywood/Los Angeles with so many of the parents not really grown up themselves--going through the same issues themselves. Though the reality it depicts is shocking, the script, direction, and acting don't flinch. Also, though put to the test, the mother's love doesn't falter, and the film ends on a muted note of optimism.-------------[last lines]Tracy: Stop. Stop. Stop.

792392,ABN9MWPSML86,B00013RC2K,Charles John Gervasi,"[1, 1]","I found this movie to be a realistic portrayal of two girls with a lot of problems.  The movie is content to show us the pain of their problems without offering commentary or insight into them.  A movie about pain with nothing deeper makes for an unpleasant movie.The movie could have done a better job of showing just how Tracy went from a young woman with problems to a petty criminal.  I get the impression the movie blames her friendship with Evie, but that is simplistic.  Tracy seeks out Evie and lionizes her.  Evie doesn't have to twist Tracy's arm to make her commit crimes.That is the what really makes the movie unpleasant-- Tracy, the main character, does not come off favorably.  She is sympathetic because she has mental problems, family problems, and bad friends.  This does not excuse her stealing and being mean to her family.  In contrast, her mother, mother's boyfriend, and her mother's ex-husband come off as somewhat flawed but basically good people.The movie would have been better if Tracy's troubled and youthful perspective provided some insight into the culture she is growing up in.  Tracy could have channeled her frustration into righting some of the flaws in the adults around her.  But then again, that would be a different movie altogether.I have to disagree with reviewers who thought the movie was about drugs and sex.  From my standpoint, experimenting with drugs and sex is normal at that age.  The movie is about personal problems causing someone to lose control of her life.  Reckless sex and drug abuse are a tiny part of the larger picture.",3,Thirteen does not offer enough commentary/prespective.,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,1581,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'two', 'girls', 'lot', 'problems', 'movie', 'content', 'show', 'pain', 'problems', 'offering', 'commentary', 'insight', 'movie', 'pain', 'nothing', 'deeper', 'unpleasant', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'Tracy', 'went', 'young', 'woman', 'problems', 'petty', 'criminal', 'get', 'impression', 'movie', 'friendship', 'Evie', 'simplistic', 'Tracy', 'out', 'Evie', 'Evie', ""n't"", 'have', 'twist', 'Tracy', 'arm', 'make', 'commit', 'crimes.That', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'unpleasant', 'Tracy', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'favorably', 'sympathetic', 'mental', 'problems', 'family', 'problems', 'bad', 'friends', 'not', 'excuse', 'stealing', 'being', 'mean', 'family', 'contrast', 'mother', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'mother', 'ex-husband', 'come', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'basically', 'good', 'people.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Tracy', 'troubled', 'youthful', 'perspective', 'provided', 'insight', 'culture', 'growing', 'up', 'Tracy', 'could', 'have', 'channeled', 'frustration', 'righting', 'flaws', 'adults', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'movie', 'altogether.I', 'have', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'drugs', 'sex', 'standpoint', 'experimenting', 'drugs', 'sex', 'normal', 'age', 'movie', 'personal', 'problems', 'causing', 'someone', 'lose', 'control', 'life', 'Reckless', 'sex', 'drug', 'abuse', 'are', 'tiny', 'part', 'larger', 'picture']",Thirteen

My problem is that I don't get shocked by movies anymore.  Doesn't mean I can't be moved or even repelled.  It just means that a movie doesn't make me say &quot;whoa!&quot; just because someone is doing something that I myself wouldn't do.  But aside from that, I wasn't moved at all by this.  Even the &quot;happy&quot; ending seemed to make it worse.  The movie drags you through the gutter (well, a glittery Hollywood gutter, since these girls are conventionally beautiful), then slaps on an ending that is supposed to make you misty.  I just didn't fall for it.  I don't know why, but I didn't.  It felt too forced.  It felt like it was made for teenagers, which I am not (and I don't think like one).  It honestly feels like it's supposed to make teenagers feel kind of cool about being a teenager today (like a movie like &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; made me feel nearly 20 years ago).  How could an adult director not realize that most grownups today don't think teenagers are very cool?  (Or does she identify herself with teenagers--I mean what was up with that hair/wig in the bonus featurette??)Anyway, if I had passed on this movie then I wouldn't have missed a thing.  Holly Hunter is good, as always, but her character seemed too fake and was not well drawn.Pass on this one if something else catches your eye.  I actually watched the 1979 movie &quot;Foxes&quot; right after this.  I hadn't planned on it, but after watching this I needed an antidote to it and I thought &quot;Foxes&quot; would be perfect for that.  And it was!P.S.  When I was thirteen, I was still watching Saturday morning cartoons, and the only drug that I had even heard of was marijuana.  That was 22 years ago, but have we really sunk this low in America?  I'd like to think not, and that this movie just used that age to add to the sensationalism.  I have personally had it with the media's obsession with drug culture (same with gangster culture).

Her mother (Holly Hunter) is loving. However she's a recovering alcoholic with a former coke-addict boyfriend and a very noisy hairdressing practice that she runs from her home. Tracy returns from school every day to total chaos. Tracy's father seems stable on the surface but he is struggling to stay employed and is often absent from her life.At some point, Tracy snaps. She courts Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular (i.e., sluttiest, fastest) girl in school by changing her clothing style and pickpotting money for an afternoon of shopping. From that moment on, the movie is a series of vignettes of Tracy's slide into sex, drugs, alcohol, and petty crime. ""Thirteen"" does not have a traditional plot: instead it takes you from point a to point b in Tracy's life with no neat resolution.The three lead actors are outstanding. Evan Rachel Wood captures the heartbreak and the brutality of being thirteen: one minute you're a little girl, the next Lolita. Nikki Reed is a dangerous femme fatale in the style of Barbara Stanwyck. Holly Hunter captures a mother in denial beautifully. She knows but she doesn't know. And she really doesn't want to know.I would recommend this movie to individuals who gravitate towards serious, art films. You don't need to be thirteen or have a thirteen-year old to appreciate it.

There wasn't a plot to be found, there was a catalog of teenaged ills woven loosely into a series of disjointed scenes that tell a predictably melodramatic screech of a story of a single mother's experiences with her one-dimensional ""good daughter gone bad."" It was as if the filmmakers proceeded with a checklist of adolescent issues, and ticked them off one by one. ""Okay, now let's progress from shoplifting to smoking to drinking to slutty wardrobe changes to soft drugs to hard drugs to huffing to self-mutilation, and then we'll get into the repercussions of all that and call it a message film."" It was really that transparent, and really that silly. Thirteen had no style. It was disturbing but unlike another infinitely superior and far more disturbing ""troubled teens"" movie, Larry Clark's  1995 shocker, Kids, this was more of an alienating, grossed-out, slovenly sort of disturbing. To be candid, Thirteen reminded me of those artless ""this could happen to you"" scare tactic films that get shown in health class and church camps in an attempt to frighten impressionable youths away from the rebellious life. Heck, it even wrecked a good song in that I can no longer hear Liz Phair's ""Explain It To Me"" without associating it with the merry-go-round shot in the closing moment of this gosh-awful movie.

792398,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00013RC2K,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 4]","When you think of the worst parts of your adolescence, the point in time when everything fell apart...you think of `thirteen'...one of the most disturbingly real films I've ever seen.  Written by Nikki Reed, who co-stars in the film, this film covers so well the transition of troubled youth.  The film is about Tracy Freeman (Evan Rachel Wood), a thirteen year old girl who isn't living in the best of circumstances.  Her father is never around, her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is a recovering alcoholic who just asked her ex-junkie boyfriend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) to move back in.  Tracy finds her means of escape by smoking and cutting, but it isn't until she meets the rebellious Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed) that she finds plenty of other means to release her inner frustration.Upon returning to school Tracy is thrust into a life she didn't expect.  She realizes that she doesn't fit in and wants to, especially when she sees that the boys pay her no attention, but instead are gawking at the `prettiest girl in school' Evie.  She befriends Evie, who quickly engulfs Tracy in her world of drinking, drugs and sex.  As her attitude and rebellious habits rage havoc on her home life her mother starts to take maters into her own hands with less than positive results.  Her efforts continue to create more problems as Tracy bucks her authority, at times even using Evie against her mother.This film isn't shy about exposing the secret lives of teenagers.  In all it's brutality it shows how fast and how deep these girls fall into a world they can't handle.  There are plenty of times you can read all over Tracy's face the fact that she's scared, nervous that she's going too far.  But when she's scared she just looks at Evie, and follows suit.  You can see the power of peer pressure, the power that self image and the constant criticism of your friends and even those who are just observers can have on you.  Tracy makes changes to finally fit in, to finally feel accepted.  She doesn't feel that acceptance anywhere else.  She has a father who doesn't love her enough to keep his dates to see her, a mother who cares so much but is unable to show it the ways Tracy would like.Evie is another story altogether.  She has a mother who isn't around and a father who isn't around and a guardian, her cousin Brooke (Deborah Kara Unger), who doesn't care enough to enforce any rules or guidelines and just lets Evie roam as she wants.  Evie is reaching for love from anyone, so much so that she reaches to the wrong people.  When she enters Tracy's life she is immediately drawn to Melanie, the loving mother she never had.  You can see the difference in the two girls, Tracy being the girl who takes for granted the love she has and Evie being the girl that longs to have that kind of love.Melanie to me is the most interesting character, for she's not the perfect mother but she tries, she struggles to make the right decisions and she beats herself up for the wrong ones she makes.  She's selfless and devoted yet she always seems to come up short in the eyes of her daughter.  Holly Hunter does and extraordinary job of playing the tortured mother, battling with her demons both self inflicted and those brought on by the ones around her.`thirteen' is a brilliant film, brutal in it's deliverance which adds to the authenticity and believability, never sugar coating the truth but exposing everything leaving nothing to the imagination.  The performances by the entire cast are amazing, Wood, Hunter and Reed bringing grit and truism to this modern day masterpiece.  Woods performance in particular is pure brilliance, transitioning from a sweet and innocent girl suffering from naivety to a cruel and heartless girl suffering from naivety almost effortlessly.  This film will startle you but hopefully it will open your eyes to the problems and issues that really do exist and help us take notice of the dangers facing our youths.  Disheartening and beautifully done, Reed has proven to be a convincing writer and actress, and Catherine Hardwicke handles this film with the proper balance of care and caution delivering one of the most powerfully moving movie experiences to come along in recent years.",5,Real life painted dirty and black...,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4205,"['When', 'think', 'worst', 'parts', 'adolescence', 'point', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'fell', 'apart', 'think', 'thirteen', 'one', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'real', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Written', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'film', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'transition', 'troubled', 'youth', 'film', 'Tracy', 'Freeman', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'living', 'best', 'circumstances', 'father', 'never', 'around', 'mother', 'Melanie', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'just', 'asked', 'ex-junkie', 'boyfriend', 'Brady', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'move', 'back', 'Tracy', 'means', 'escape', 'smoking', 'cutting', ""n't"", 'rebellious', 'Evie', 'Zamora', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'plenty', 'other', 'means', 'release', 'inner', 'frustration.Upon', 'returning', 'school', 'Tracy', 'thrust', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', ""n't"", 'fit', 'especially', 'when', 'boys', 'pay', 'attention', 'instead', 'are', 'gawking', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'school', 'Evie', 'Evie', 'who', 'quickly', 'engulfs', 'Tracy', 'world', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'sex', 'attitude', 'rebellious', 'habits', 'rage', 'havoc', 'home', 'life', 'mother', 'take', 'maters', 'own', 'hands', 'less', 'positive', 'results', 'efforts', 'continue', 'create', 'more', 'problems', 'Tracy', 'authority', 'times', 'even', 'using', 'Evie', 'mother.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'exposing', 'secret', 'lives', 'teenagers', 'brutality', 'how', 'fast', 'how', 'deep', 'girls', 'fall', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'are', 'plenty', 'times', 'can', 'read', 'Tracy', 'face', 'fact', 'scared', 'nervous', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'scared', 'just', 'Evie', 'suit', 'can', 'see', 'power', 'peer', 'pressure', 'power', 'self', 'image', 'constant', 'criticism', 'friends', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'observers', 'can', 'have', 'Tracy', 'changes', 'finally', 'fit', 'finally', 'feel', 'accepted', ""n't"", 'feel', 'acceptance', 'anywhere', 'else', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'enough', 'keep', 'dates', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'unable', 'show', 'ways', 'Tracy', 'would', 'like.Evie', 'story', 'altogether', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'around', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'around', 'guardian', 'cousin', 'Brooke', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'enforce', 'rules', 'guidelines', 'just', 'lets', 'Evie', 'roam', 'Evie', 'reaching', 'love', 'anyone', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'people', 'When', 'Tracy', 'life', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'Melanie', 'loving', 'mother', 'never', 'had', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'two', 'girls', 'Tracy', 'being', 'girl', 'who', 'granted', 'love', 'Evie', 'being', 'girl', 'have', 'kind', 'love.Melanie', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'not', 'perfect', 'mother', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'up', 'wrong', 'ones', 'selfless', 'devoted', 'yet', 'always', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'playing', 'tortured', 'mother', 'battling', 'demons', 'self', 'inflicted', 'brought', 'ones', 'her.', 'thirteen', 'brilliant', 'film', 'brutal', 'deliverance', 'authenticity', 'believability', 'never', 'sugar', 'coating', 'truth', 'exposing', 'everything', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'amazing', 'Wood', 'Hunter', 'Reed', 'bringing', 'grit', 'truism', 'modern', 'day', 'masterpiece', 'Woods', 'performance', 'particular', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'transitioning', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'suffering', 'naivety', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'girl', 'suffering', 'naivety', 'almost', 'effortlessly', 'film', 'will', 'startle', 'hopefully', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'problems', 'issues', 'really', 'do', 'exist', 'help', 'take', 'notice', 'dangers', 'facing', 'youths', 'Disheartening', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Reed', 'proven', 'be', 'convincing', 'writer', 'actress', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'film', 'proper', 'balance', 'care', 'caution', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'movie', 'experiences', 'come', 'along', 'recent', 'years']",Thirteen
792399,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B00013RC2K,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[1, 2]","I'll grant the good reviewers that their are some amazing actors and actresses in this movie.  It is the screenplay itself I found a little, well, ummm...sick.  While I'm sure the director was sincere in her effort to make an realistic movie about today's teenagers - specifically thirteen-year-old girls, I feel that she missed the mark on a few things:#1. We never see Tracy's friends (the good girls) going about life without resorting to the extremely disastrous decisions Tracy embraces.  This would have been a good way to show the results of good decisions, contrasting the negative decisions made by Tracy#2. In reality, Tracy would see her downfall more clearly than the screenplay suggests.  I made a LOT of bad decisions during my teen years; I and all of my friends discussed our stupid decisions amongst each other - consulting each other for advice.  Tracy doesn't approach anyone about her bad decisions.  This just doesn't hold up with a screenplay chasing after reality.#3. Most kids today have enough brains to realize peer pressure can drag you down, yet Tracy's character allows peer pressure to drowned her constantly.Now, the good things.  Holly Hunter is such a great actress, that I love everything she does. Evan Rachel Wood complimented Holly Hunter well; the scene when Holly's character (Tracy's Mom) continues to hug her daughter after finding out how far her daughter has fallen may just be one of the most moving scenes filmed in the past few years.As a screenplay writer and author, I found this movie to be a sincere effort at making a film about today's teenager; a movie that is brilliant in parts and very shallow in other parts.  I hope people who loved this movie are not too mad at me for any criticism I have for this movie; I have to say how I truly feel - the same way the director has to make the film she wants.I am very interested in looking up other movies directed by Catherine Hardwicke to see more of her work.See ya next review.[...]",3,"Disturbing, but some parts were moving",1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,1983,"[""'ll"", 'grant', 'good', 'reviewers', 'are', 'amazing', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'found', 'little', 'well', 'ummm', 'sick', ""'m"", 'sure', 'director', 'was', 'sincere', 'effort', 'make', 'realistic', 'movie', 'today', 'teenagers', 'specifically', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girls', 'feel', 'missed', 'mark', 'few', 'things', '1', 'never', 'see', 'Tracy', 'friends', 'good', 'girls', 'going', 'life', 'resorting', 'extremely', 'disastrous', 'decisions', 'Tracy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'way', 'show', 'results', 'good', 'decisions', 'contrasting', 'negative', 'decisions', 'made', 'Tracy', '2', 'reality', 'Tracy', 'would', 'see', 'downfall', 'more', 'clearly', 'screenplay', 'made', 'LOT', 'bad', 'decisions', 'teen', 'years', 'friends', 'discussed', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'amongst', 'other', 'consulting', 'other', 'advice', 'Tracy', ""n't"", 'approach', 'anyone', 'bad', 'decisions', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'screenplay', 'chasing', 'reality.', '3', 'Most', 'kids', 'today', 'have', 'enough', 'brains', 'realize', 'peer', 'pressure', 'can', 'drag', 'down', 'yet', 'Tracy', 'character', 'peer', 'pressure', 'drowned', 'constantly.Now', 'good', 'things', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'love', 'everything', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'complimented', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'well', 'scene', 'when', 'Holly', 'character', 'Tracy', 'Mom', 'hug', 'daughter', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'far', 'daughter', 'fallen', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'past', 'few', 'years.As', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'author', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'sincere', 'effort', 'making', 'film', 'today', 'teenager', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'parts', 'very', 'shallow', 'other', 'parts', 'hope', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'mad', 'criticism', 'have', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'how', 'truly', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'director', 'make', 'film', 'wants.I', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'looking', 'up', 'other', 'movies', 'directed', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'see', 'more', 'work.See', 'ya', 'next', 'review.', '[', ']']",Thirteen

That is just the start of things, as Tracy's life develops into a downard spiral of drugs, sex, and crime...all to gain popularity (which, of course, in the end eludes her).Holly Hunter, as Tracy's mother, is outstanding.  Everybody is perfectly cast; at times, it's hard to tell that this is a movie.  Which, in a way, is disturbing.  This is not a film for the squeamish; it's realistic, and it's brutally honest.

What is so gripping is the causal realities of expressed in this film: damaged people who inflict their wounds on their youngsters through apathy, divorce, and drug and alcohol addiction.  We witness the effects on their families as both Tracy (Rachel Wood) and Evie (Nikki Reed) find themselves in a self-destructive relationship each exploring the world of drugs and sex and peer pressure.  You can see why each of them are drawn both to each other and to the world they inhabit and it feels more like a documentary than a film.As the film draws to a close the relationship comes apart and Tracy is given a second chance to turn things around while Evie will continue the slow destructive path to who-knows-where.  Holly Hunter is brilliant as Tracy's Mom having to capture the character of a recovering alcoholic who's life is in turmoil without ever going for the TV movie of the week tear jerker.The ending is a painful reminder of how hard it's going to be for both of them.  What terrifies me most is how it is obvious that this trend will continue and how families today are little different than families of any generation except the accessibilities of drugs and sex makes for a terrifying reality that I doubt will change.

The hardhitting scenes in this wrongfully underrated movie keep everything realistic looking and keep audiences eyes wide open.  Its daring theme earns the cast and crew trememdous respect for graphically exploring what few other moviemakers have.  The research of such issues are present: drug use, theft, out-of-control behavior, and many more all from teenagers.  The emotional aspect never fades for a second, keeping audiences interested the whole time.  This brilliant plot is loosely based on actress Nikki Reed's, who plays Evie, life.  Knowing this, the graphic nature becomes more necessary to inform audiences of teenage realities.  The actors offer their own emotional standing to the movie.  Evan Rachel Wood's Golden Globe nominated (Best Actress) performance proves that she's one of the few child actors with talent.  Her despliction of an out-of-control thirteen-year-old, Tracy, places her in higher territory as an actress.  Her intensity shines in every scene.  Holly Hunter's Oscar nominated performance (Best Supporting Acress) is one of her best roles in years.  She beautifully desplicts the stresses and turbulances as Tracy's mother struggling to keep her family together.

792407,AYOPN5ABOAUER,B00013RC2K,DavidRoss,"[6, 7]","The toughest and truest coming of age movie in years, THIRTEEN is not for the faint of heart--and not for children without a healthy dose of parental accompaniment.  It's about what happens when the normal post-pubescent urge to individuate from family and find peer-group acceptance conspires with a severely decadent society to make adolescence a nightmare.  Watching the downward spiral of the desperate-to-be-""all that"" 13-year-old Tracy is as gut-wrenching as watching a car spin out in traffic yet being powerless to prevent the accident, partly because we've all known a ""Tracy"" or two, but mostly because of the passionate intensity that everyone involved has brought to this film.  There's no sugar-coating to this story, no Disneyfication, no crippling compromise for the sake of broad box-office appeal, just utterly committed storytelling as authentic and chilling as BOYZ N THE HOOD and MI VIDA LOCA.Writer-director Catherine Hardwicke, co-writer Nikki Reed, cinematographer Elliot Davis, and the entire cast have crafted a movie that adroitly navigates a minefield of clich&eacute;s by focusing on telling details, thus particularizing Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), her girlfriend Evie (played by co-writer Reed), her mother (Holly Hunter), and their interlocking relationships as well.  Hunter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her searingly authentic performance as Tracy's recovering alcoholic single mom, Mel, who enables Tracy's self-destructive slide by ignoring the warning signs that something is dreadfully wrong and neglecting the active parental intervention that the situation demands.  Co-author Reed is utterly convincing as the slyly manipulative Evie, who preys on Tracy's need to be regarded as cool, and on Mel's need to see herself as helpful and understanding.  Yet as good as Hunter and Reed are, this is Wood's movie, and she all but steals the show with the gutsiest, most accomplished performance by a young teen actress that I can recall.  (I suspect that only the MPAA's squeamishness about the subject matter kept Wood from an Oscar nomination of her own.)  All the supporting actors give remarkably fine performances, too, especially Brady Corbett as Tracy's older brother, Mason, and Deborah Kara Unger as Evie's out-of-it guardian, Brooke.I admired this movie far more than expected.  It's not easy to watch, but that has nothing to do with D.P. Davis's judiciously artful use of the hand-held camera.  Rather it's because the story rings so painfully true, and because--like Tracy's mom--our society often neglects what's best for our kids for fear of offending them or those who prey upon them.  How many Evies and Tracys must suffer before we come to our senses and stop encouraging the conditions that enable such sorrows to flourish?  In short, THIRTEEN is a gutsy and very accomplished film about something that really matters--our kids, and the need not to shirk our responsibility for their welfare, especially in the treacherously amoral world we are bequeathing them.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if permitted, but given the choice Amazon allows, let's make it an even 5.",5,"Passionate, Committed Film about What Matters Most: Our Kids",1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,3129,"['toughest', 'truest', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'years', 'THIRTEEN', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'not', 'children', 'healthy', 'dose', 'parental', 'accompaniment', 'what', 'when', 'normal', 'post-pubescent', 'urge', 'individuate', 'family', 'find', 'peer-group', 'acceptance', 'conspires', 'severely', 'decadent', 'society', 'make', 'adolescence', 'nightmare', 'Watching', 'downward', 'spiral', 'desperate-to-be-', '13-year-old', 'Tracy', 'as', 'gut-wrenching', 'watching', 'car', 'spin', 'out', 'traffic', 'yet', 'being', 'powerless', 'prevent', 'accident', 'partly', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Tracy', 'two', 'mostly', 'passionate', 'intensity', 'everyone', 'involved', 'brought', 'film', 'sugar-coating', 'story', 'Disneyfication', 'crippling', 'compromise', 'sake', 'broad', 'box-office', 'appeal', 'just', 'utterly', 'committed', 'storytelling', 'authentic', 'chilling', 'BOYZ', 'N', 'THE', 'HOOD', 'MI', 'VIDA', 'LOCA.Writer-director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'co-writer', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'cinematographer', 'Elliot', 'Davis', 'entire', 'cast', 'have', 'crafted', 'movie', 'adroitly', 'minefield', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'focusing', 'telling', 'details', 'thus', 'particularizing', 'Tracy', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'girlfriend', 'Evie', 'played', 'co-writer', 'Reed', 'mother', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'interlocking', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'Hunter', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'searingly', 'authentic', 'performance', 'Tracy', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'single', 'mom', 'Mel', 'who', 'Tracy', 'self-destructive', 'slide', 'ignoring', 'warning', 'signs', 'something', 'dreadfully', 'wrong', 'neglecting', 'active', 'parental', 'intervention', 'situation', 'Co-author', 'Reed', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'slyly', 'manipulative', 'Evie', 'who', 'preys', 'Tracy', 'need', 'be', 'regarded', 'cool', 'Mel', 'need', 'see', 'helpful', 'understanding', 'as', 'good', 'Hunter', 'Reed', 'are', 'Wood', 'movie', 'show', 'gutsiest', 'most', 'accomplished', 'performance', 'young', 'teen', 'actress', 'can', 'recall', 'suspect', 'only', 'MPAA', 'squeamishness', 'subject', 'matter', 'kept', 'Wood', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'own', 'supporting', 'actors', 'give', 'remarkably', 'fine', 'performances', 'too', 'especially', 'Brady', 'Corbett', 'Tracy', 'older', 'brother', 'Mason', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'Evie', 'out-of-it', 'guardian', 'Brooke.I', 'admired', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'expected', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'nothing', 'do', 'D.P', 'Davis', 'judiciously', 'artful', 'use', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'story', 'rings', 'so', 'painfully', 'true', 'because', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'society', 'often', 'what', 'best', 'kids', 'fear', 'offending', 'who', 'prey', 'How', 'many', 'Evies', 'Tracys', 'must', 'suffer', 'come', 'senses', 'stop', 'encouraging', 'conditions', 'enable', 'such', 'sorrows', 'flourish', 'short', 'THIRTEEN', 'gutsy', 'very', 'accomplished', 'film', 'something', 'really', 'matters', 'kids', 'need', 'not', 'shirk', 'responsibility', 'welfare', 'especially', 'treacherously', 'amoral', 'world', 'are', 'bequeathing', ""'d"", 'give', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'permitted', 'given', 'choice', 'Amazon', 'let', 'make', 'even', '5']",Thirteen
792408,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00013RC2K,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[5, 6]","This film deals with adolescent girls living in a lower middle class milieu where the fathers are absent.  Are we talking about dysfunctional families?  Indeed, we most certainly are.  Evie (Nikki Reed) is a hardened manipulator who may even be a remorseless sociopath.  She is already more than a bit slutty and a loser going nowhere fast.  The very concept of delayed gratification is utterly alien to her.  Getting high and shop lifting are preferable to acquiring an education.  The opposite is true for Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a shy girl who earns good grades.  Her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is divorced from a man who has opted for a solidly middle class life.  He has little time for either Tracy or her brother, Brady.  Evie is considered to be the most popular girl at school, and Tracy wants to join her inner circle.  Sadly, this goal is achieved and Tracy's life begins to rapidly fall apart.  The audience is in for a rough ride. Many of the scenes in Thirteen are not for the squeamish.  Watching a young girl cut into her arm with various sharp objects almost made me turn my head away from the screen.  Thirteen is highly recommended for all parents, teenagers, and anyone involved in helping teenagers grow into mature adults.Why did it get an R rating?  This may be due to Holly Hunter's totally unnecessary and gratuitous nude scene.  What was director Catherine Hardwicke thinking?

This is an excellent independent film with glowing performances from the entire cast.  But there are two, in particular, that drive this unnerving film home.  Evan Rachel Wood, in an auspicious performance, gives a powerful turn as a 13-year-old suddenly overwhelmed with puberty and peer pressure.  Her acting alone is reason enough to see this, but then Holly Hunter matches her scene for scene with a subtle, extraordinary performance.  On a personal note, this film provoked memories of alcohol abuse in my own family, making it all the more striking.  I can't say that I would recommend buying this.  I couldn't imagine anyone wanting to watch this disheartening tale of disintegrating youth more than once.  However, the acting is really good and the documentary style in which this film was shot made me feel more like a voyeur than an audience member, leaving me drained with the experience.  The final scene in which Ms. Wood is holding onto the outside of a playground merry-go-round and then suddenly screams is a perfect metaphor for the beginning of adolesence: confusing and frightening, exhilerating and dizzying.

The ultimate responsibility for doing that is a parent. Here we have Holly Hunter as a single mother trying to raise her children in low-income enviroment as a hair stylist. Her teenage daughter feels violated, alienated, and pushed aside because of all that. The father is wrapped up in his own life, and can't get past to help his daughter. The teenage girl Tracy is trying to fit in in junior high school, and is desparate to please a girl named Evie, so what would start out as a transformation of clothing wardrobe Tracy has Evie's attention, or is it the other way around? The story of these 2 girls is so intertwinded for the most part that it's hard to figure out whose trying to please who? There are things about Tracy that Evie wants to have like a mother as Evie wants to be adopted by Tracy's mom, and Tracy because Evie's the most popular girl in school. Back in the days when I was in junior high it was just starting to get worse; There were knives, and marijuana, and cigarettes in my junior high, whereas now it's cellular phones, cigarettes, guns, knives, all kinds of drugs in junior high. Anyway Evie exposes Tracy to the so-called glamourous side of junior high as Tracy sells out her values and friends for this girl, and in turn Evie is selling herself onto Tracy to be like not only a soul sister to Tracy, but maybe a soul-mate as Evie and Tracy share just about everything with each other. However, it's not meant to be as it's brought out that Evie already has a mother who's one of Tracy's mom's clients, and Tracy's mom refuses to adopt Evie, and so Evie makes it hard for Tracy even to the point of making it seem like it was Tracy who exposed Evie to the world of drugs, sex, and self-multilation. It made my heart break to see girls doing stuff like that because of the stresses, the heartbreaks, and crap that life dishes out alot of the time. I found this to be too stark and realistic of a movie. Evie and Tracy were beautiful girls who just had circumstances where they felt love wasn't enough. In the end it was Tracy who was shown how much she was loved as her mom saw the multilations that Tracy made on her arms, and her mom kissed them all while Tracy was crying because of Evie's betrayal. This movie represented life at it's ultimate worst. Divorce, drugs, helplessness, inability to try and better yourself in education, self-infliction of pain, sex, and anything under the sun to make the pain go away. Pain doesn't necessarily go away, but if you have the love and support of both parents even if they aren't married anymore a child won't have to look for the community to give to him/her to get need and want.

Sorel ""book lovah""","[1, 1]","The movie is based on Nikki Reed's tumultuous life during her adolescence.The plot follows Wood's character named Tracy as she enters the 7th grade and becomes entranced with her wild classmate Evie (played by Reed). Evie proves to be a terribly influence on Tracy who goes from being an excellent student, blossoming poet, and sheltered young lady to a 13 year old drug abuser who loses her virginity and verbally assaults her family members on a daily basis. Tracy's mother (Mel), played expertly by Holly Hunter, is a recovered drug addict/alcoholic who is trying to save her daughter without getting sucked into back into the drug and alcohol scene herself. As Tracy and Evie become closer friends, Evie makes up lies about her past in order to stay at Tracy's house and win over her family. In addition, Tracy is trying to deal with the fact that her father has a new family and does not have time for her. Just when the tension seems to be at its boiling point, Mel's boyfriend (who is an ex-cocaine addict) moves back in after his stay in the halfway house.With such a heavy plot, I was skeptical that the young actresses wouldn't be able to pull it all off. I was completely wrong! Wood plays her part so well that I wondered if she had experiences similar to those in the film. Holly Hunter was equally exceptional as was Nikki Reed did not in fact play herself in the film but instead played the antagonist. Once I did some background reading on this movie, I found that it had been written by Nikki Reed and director Catherine Hardwicke in six days and was originally going to be a comedy. This shocked me because the material is so tragic and raw that there isn't even enough humor for a dark comedy. It was equally impressive to read that it was written in such a short time period because the characters are very well developed. Of course it has its pitfalls, but the majority of them hit in the first half an hour of the film. At times the script feels clunky, but it never interferes with the action or emotion of the movie.

There is a scene where these two girls are both making out with one of the girl's next door neighbors, who's character in the movie is supposed to be at least 7 or 8 years older.  I checked imdb.com, and the actor who portrayed the neighbor is Kip Pardue, born in 1976.  Evan Rachel was born in '87, Reed in '88.  Both of these girls were 15 when this movie was shot and he was 25-26.  SHOCK AND AWE!  How the hell did Catherine Hardwicke (director) pull this little stunt off.  Very powerful scene, but will leave you in absolute wonder days after you see the movie.Other shocking scenes are of self-mutilation.  Evan Rachel's character taking razor blades to her forearm.  One can only turn away, and just accept what is happening.  I know there are other movies out there that are way more gruesome, such as Irreversible, but this was like a ""Kids"" sequel, except way more dramatic.  A very touching deleted scene is on the DVD where Evan Rachel's character (Tracy) comes home to find Reed's character (Evie) and her guardian sitting in the living room with her mother.  She leaves to ""use the restroom"" but the cut part of the scene is when her brother (played by Brady Corbet) catches her in the hallway, and wraps his arms around his sister; letting her know that he loves her very much, and that he knows the fall she set her self up for.  Heartwrenching, because I have given the same hug to my sister when she was a VERY rebellious teenager.I must give credit for the way this movie was shot.  It was filmed on a shaky dv cam, with low lighting to give the movie a more dark feel.  Which is exactly what is accomplished here, giving the audience a dark feel, and have their emotions run with each scene.  I would give this little gem five stars, but it lost one for a bit of quickness to the movie.  I felt that they could have spent a little more time in the beginning of the movie with a little more distance between Evie and Tracy, before they started hanging out.  It's almost like Tracy was suddenly accepted into a group that wouldn't be caught dead with her.  So, it would feel more real, if some more real scenes were going on; and that would make the climax even more emotional.Over all, wonderful, and touching film.",4,Real life on screen.,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,2929,"['Let', 'take', 'minute', 'sigh', 'few', 'times', 'do', 'little', 'coping', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'TAD', 'more', 'real', 'possibly', 'adding', 'more', 'tears', 'other', 'two', 'thirteen', 'year', 'olds', 'rebelling', 'nearly', 'everything', 'sounds', 'looked', 'FELT', 'very', 'real', 'have', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'went', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'two', 'girls', 'experienced', 'drugs', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'name', 'were', 'doing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'almost', 'felt', 'voyeuristic', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'wondering', 'was', 'legal', 'girls', 'do', 'two', 'young', 'ladies', 'playing', 'roles', 'are', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Nicki', 'Reed', 'who', 'also', 'co-writer', 'BEWARE', 'SPOILER', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'making', 'out', 'one', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'who', 'character', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'least', '7', '8', 'years', 'older', 'checked', 'imdb.com', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'neighbor', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'born', '1976', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'was', 'born', ""'87"", 'Reed', ""'88"", 'girls', 'were', '15', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'was', '25-26', 'SHOCK', 'AWE', 'How', 'hell', 'did', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'director', 'pull', 'little', 'stunt', 'off', 'Very', 'powerful', 'scene', 'will', 'leave', 'absolute', 'wonder', 'days', 'see', 'movie.Other', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'are', 'self-mutilation', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'character', 'taking', 'razor', 'blades', 'forearm', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'turn', 'away', 'just', 'accept', 'what', 'happening', 'know', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'there', 'are', 'way', 'more', 'gruesome', 'such', 'Irreversible', 'was', 'Kids', 'sequel', 'way', 'more', 'dramatic', 'very', 'touching', 'deleted', 'scene', 'DVD', 'where', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'character', 'Tracy', 'home', 'find', 'Reed', 'character', 'Evie', 'guardian', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'mother', 'use', 'restroom', 'cut', 'part', 'scene', 'when', 'brother', 'played', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'hallway', 'arms', 'sister', 'letting', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'fall', 'set', 'self', 'up', 'Heartwrenching', 'have', 'given', 'same', 'hug', 'sister', 'when', 'was', 'VERY', 'rebellious', 'teenager.I', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'filmed', 'shaky', 'dv', 'cam', 'low', 'lighting', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'dark', 'feel', 'Which', 'exactly', 'what', 'accomplished', 'here', 'giving', 'audience', 'dark', 'feel', 'have', 'emotions', 'run', 'scene', 'would', 'give', 'little', 'gem', 'five', 'stars', 'lost', 'one', 'bit', 'quickness', 'movie', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'beginning', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'distance', 'Evie', 'Tracy', 'started', 'hanging', 'out', 'almost', 'like', 'Tracy', 'was', 'suddenly', 'accepted', 'group', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'So', 'would', 'feel', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'real', 'scenes', 'were', 'going', 'would', 'make', 'climax', 'even', 'more', 'emotional.Over', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'film']",Thirteen

The underlying emotion and attitude was so strong that I could tell right away that it was going to have a profound message.  I was compelled to watch it.It was astonishing in its honesty.  So many things about both of the girls struck a chord with me.  I felt like I could relate completely in my own teenage experiences.After a while I stopped relating and was suddenly terrified.  I'm not a teenager anymore.  These things are not ok.  They're dangerous and it scares the heck out of me that not only did I do some of these things, but as a parent, my own children could be doing these things... and they might not be as lucky or as smart as I was to get away from them.What scares me even more about this film is that if I had seen it as a teenager I would have thought it was cool.  I might even have tried some of the things I hadn't already or been encouraged to do more of what I had.  I would not have the experience I have now to realize the severe emotional and physical reprecussions that engaging in these types of activity can cause.All in all I strongly recommend you see it, espeically if you are a parent.

Both girls and guys alike struggle through adolesence, especially when their parents give them little or no direction. With that being said the movie itself was pretty powerful and I thought well acted Evan Rachel Wood (Tracy) and Nikki Reed did a remarkable job of portraying dirty, trashy and down right slutty teenagers, and Holly Hunter did a great job of playing a confused mother who refused to take charge of her daughter's behavior.I, myself am a 21 year old guy that is not a parent but see this behavior quite often from teenagers that just want to belong to something and crave attention. I'm guessing the moral of this story is for parents to give their children the attention they desire and crave so they don't go looking for it in other ways that could damage their life.For those who refuse to believe this is realistic need to open your eyes because it could be your son or daughter acting this way without you realizing it.

This coming-of-age tale about a 13-old girl (the impressive Evan Rachel Wood, from the TV-Show ""Once and Again"") who suddently begins exploring her darker side isn`t grounbreaking material, yet suceeds as a compelling effort nonetheless.Director Chaterine Hardwicke offers an intriguing debut oeuvre, one that dares to take a deep and risky look at today`s teenagers. ""Thirteen"" presents a strong and vivid visual style, full of energy and dynamism and somewhat reminiscent of MTV. The direction also offers a documentary-like quality, being quite realistic and credible on its approach. Hardwicke manages to develop key subjects such as family connections, sexual initiation, drug and alcohol abuse, school relationships and hierarquies, the access to popularity and many other key issues of urban societies.Although this movie could have been an average and moralistic afterschool special, it wisely avoids easy melodrama and stereotyped situations, presenting a wide-eyed perspective with enough ambiguity and depth. The lead character Tracy changes quite fast (perhaps way too fast), and her search for a different and stronger personality is well showcased here, evolving from a cute, smart and innocent girl to an experienced, trendy and hip ""lolita"" that enters a downward spiral. The movie`s pacing is well-balanced and the powerful soundtrack adds a vital sense of rythm and confusion.

This is a pungently real, throbbing two hours of the descent of a 'normal' but vulnerable thirteen year old 7th grader (Evan Rachel Wood as Tracy), the daughter of a divorced, recovering alcoholic mother (Holly Hunter) who loves her children and supports them by working as a hairdresser in their home, who succumbs to the need of peer acceptance by aligning with the most 'with it' girl in her class (Nikki Reed's Evie), and moves from normalcy into drugs, crime, self abuse, and rage against the adult world. There is no comic relief or any relief at all in this ring of Dante's Inferno and that is as it should be, Co-writers Nikki Reed (yes, the beautiful young accomplice in the film) and Catherine Hardwicke have written a script that makes us feel we are neighbors unwillingly privy to the madness of folks next door. The language is raw, the drug scenes are realistic, and the sex scenes are gratefully fogged over by the fine cinematographer using the blur effect to tell much more than playing actual witness could show. This is a very fine, though very tough to watch, film about a real problem that surrounds us. There is no pat ending, only a hint that something positive has resulted from this assault on our senses. Much of this is due to the fine direction by Catherine Hardwicke, but the power comes from extraordinary performances Evan Rachel Wood (why did the Academy single out Keisha Castle-Hughes and ignore Wood if they were looking for a young actress' performance?), Holly Hunter, Nikki Reed, Jeremy Sisto, Deborah Unger (becoming one of the finer character actors around), and all the cast.

I still remember how unprepared I was to find myself in a world that only cared about boys and wild fun, and I was even less prepared to discover that I was pretty interested in these things myself.There seems to be some debate as to whether Tracy's descent into teenage hell is realistic in terms of its severity and speed. As for myself, I never snuck lines of coke in my bedroom, but plenty of my classmates did.What struck me most about this movie was not the drugs or the sex, though both are certainly disturbing. What this movie really captures is how difficult it is for both parents and children to renegotiate their relationship when the kids become teenagers. One day Tracy tells her mother that she can never stay mad when her mom strokes her hair, and the next, she's screaming that no one can enter her bedroom unannounced. Tracy doesn't just make foolhardy decisions. She also makes necessary ones albeit with an adolescent lack of tact. The movie does not tell us if Tracy manages to grow up unscathed, but there's no doubt that she is gowing up. No matter what else happens, she'll still be a sexual being who is no longer comfortable being naked in front of her mother. She'll probably still want to keep her bedroom door closed. She'll want to shop on Melrose Place without an accompanying adult.""Thirteen"" is unsparing in this regard. We see Tracy's need to separate, and her mother's sorrow at this loss. Holly Hunter does a magnificent job as a mother who suddenly finds herself without any connection to or authority over her child.

Evan Rachel Wood does a fantastic job of portraying Tracy, and deserved her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.  Holly Hunter does an amazing job of showing what parents of teenagers go through, and how tough it truly is.  She also deserved her Golden Globe AND Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Rounding out the cast of main characters is Nikki Reed as Evie, who also wrote the film.  Her script is sheer brilliance and is ultimately an eye-opener for all.  And last but not least, Catherine Hardwicke does a great job of directing, and the use of only a digital camera makes the film seem so much more real.Tracy as entered the seventh grade and quickly feels that she does not have the right friends.  This movie shows how the desire to be accepted is so sick.  Why do teens have to feel accepted by the popular kids to live and feel happy.  The film also portrays teenage rebellion to the max and shows perfectly how badly it affects our caring parents.  This film is riveting, and very very effective in all ways.

True, the movie is not the most believable overall, yet it shows the struggle of a mother trying to hang on to a rebellious child. This is based on a lot of factual issues kids deal with everyday in this area of New York. Its certainly not uncommon to see a child this out of control. The spiraling of a child who starts stealing to be cool and fit in, to self mutilation and using drugs to oppositional defiance. Not uncommon that the family is equally dysfunctional. No real father figure and a mother who lost contact with her kid and has nothing but love to offer the child. The child is looking for more than love and easily falls prey to becoming a hopelessly labeled child. The ending was somewhat anti-climatic however, and really detracted to the height of the movie.

792434,A2U2YBI0FXSDH7,B00013RC2K,Jazzy Jade,"[0, 1]","I watched and bought this movie in my younger days, and just recently watched it again at 30, and I was quite surprised that I even bought this movie. In some respects, it does portray a realistic sense of what it feels like to be 13 - pressure to do drugs, be accepted by the cooler kids, sexual experimentation, and a constant struggle with parents who don't understand you, that much is true. However, my conflicting opinion with this movie is that, this scenario is that of extreme cases of troubled youth, not your average teenager. A good majority of our youth feels these pressures, but they don't react in this extreme sense. Believe it or not, some actually handle different scenarios fairly well, and we actually don't give them enough credit for that.Holly Hunter plays an outstanding single mother in this movie. She cares deeply about her kids, and lets them know how much she cares about them, but at the same time, she never really has the time to connect with them. For me the more important message in this movie, and from my personal experience, is not that kids fall prey to all the sexual and drug pressures, but that parents who don't spend enough time with their kids lose sight of the fact that they strayed, because of their lack of connection, and interest in what their kids do, or how they feel. Kids may act like they don't care, but they know everything thats going on, even if you don't want them to know. And because adults act as if they aren't wise enough to understand, that frustrates them even more, and makes them feel like they have no say. The outcome is an emotionally neglected teenager, who can't turn to their parents, so they look for other outlets to ease their emotional pain.A worthwhile movie for parents to watch, but know that it doesn't always become this extreme. I believe Nikki Reed just wrote it this way to make it clear to parents that this can happen if you don't pay attention to your kids, but it's preventable from escalating this far, if caught early.",3,Realistic on the verge of over dramatize,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2013,"['watched', 'bought', 'movie', 'younger', 'days', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'again', '30', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'even', 'bought', 'movie', 'respects', 'portray', 'realistic', 'sense', 'what', 'be', '13', 'pressure', 'do', 'drugs', 'be', 'accepted', 'cooler', 'kids', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'constant', 'struggle', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'true', 'However', 'conflicting', 'opinion', 'movie', 'scenario', 'extreme', 'cases', 'troubled', 'youth', 'not', 'average', 'teenager', 'good', 'majority', 'youth', 'pressures', 'do', ""n't"", 'react', 'extreme', 'sense', 'Believe', 'not', 'actually', 'handle', 'different', 'scenarios', 'fairly', 'well', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'credit', 'that.Holly', 'Hunter', 'outstanding', 'single', 'mother', 'movie', 'deeply', 'kids', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'time', 'connect', 'more', 'important', 'message', 'movie', 'personal', 'experience', 'not', 'kids', 'fall', 'prey', 'sexual', 'drug', 'pressures', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'kids', 'lose', 'sight', 'fact', 'strayed', 'lack', 'connection', 'interest', 'what', 'kids', 'do', 'how', 'feel', 'Kids', 'may', 'act', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'know', 'everything', 'thats', 'going', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'adults', 'act', 'are', ""n't"", 'wise', 'enough', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'feel', 'have', 'say', 'outcome', 'emotionally', 'neglected', 'teenager', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'parents', 'look', 'other', 'outlets', 'ease', 'emotional', 'pain.A', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'parents', 'watch', 'know', ""n't"", 'always', 'become', 'extreme', 'believe', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'just', 'wrote', 'way', 'make', 'clear', 'parents', 'can', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'kids', 'preventable', 'escalating', 'far', 'caught', 'early']",Thirteen
792435,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00013RC2K,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 3]","""Thirteen"" falls in a category I like to call ""Teens gone wild."" Why not create such a rubric? We've got videos showing animals on rampages, college girls on rampages, and shows with adults behaving badly. I even saw part of a program recently that deals with troubled toddlers. I have yet to see, however, any shows dealing with snarky senior citizens. Anyway, ""Teens gone wild"" has seen a surge of movies, documentaries, and assorted television programs in recent years. Larry Clark's ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" helped kick off the craze. ""Fun"" is another movie to rent if you want to see adolescents committing crimes and generally acting like psychopaths. Nearly any program on the Lifetime network dealing with kids falls into this category, and occasionally you'll see a documentary on public television dealing with the shoddy moral standards of America's youth. Come to think of it, we really don't need to watch media programs about bad kids when merely opening your daily newspaper will reveal story after story involving crime, drugs, and teenagers. It's sad, really, but just another symptom of a society slipping rapidly into the dark pit of anarchy. Even sadder are the people, including parents, who wring their hands over the latest atrocities yet do nothing to stop it from happening again.Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a beautiful young girl who lives in a rather chaotic environment. Her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is a recovering alcoholic raising Tracy and her brother Mason (Brady Corbet) with little assistance from their father. In the beginning of the film we get a few glimpses of Tracy's character and learn that she has a dark side. A poem she writes and reads for her mother is filled with doom and gloom. Too, this young girl cuts herself with a razorblade whenever stress overwhelms her. Most of this stress seems to arise from school, where Tracy's intelligence and work ethic translates into geek status. She longs to hang out with the popular crowd, which in this case means the clique headed up by the vivacious Evie (Nikki Reed). Actually, ""vivacious"" probably isn't the correct term to apply to Evie--she's certainly an attractive young lady with an outgoing personality, but her attire and her manner reek of decadence. An opportunity for Tracy to transcend her social status arrives on the heels of a snub. Evie and a friend spurn Tracy's attempts to form a relationship at a local department store, so our girl promptly steals a lady's wallet outside and returns flush with cash. The girls go on a spending spree, and from this point on Tracy and Evie are inseparable.In no time at all Evie practically moves in with her new friend and begins running the show. Both girls start using all sorts of drugs, drink heavily, sneak out at night, hang out with older guys for bouts of you know what, cut class, steal, and engage in other delinquent behaviors. Melanie at first accepts Evie into her household mainly because she has little reason for apprehension and partly because she wants her daughter to be happy. Besides, Melanie has her own problems to contend with, including struggling with her own sobriety even as she takes into her arms a man named Brady (Jeremy Sisto) whose substance abuse problems occasionally surface from time to time. Any concerns Melanie has about Evie fall by the wayside when the girl tells her that she's a victim of child abuse. Evie is a real schemer, and her influence over Tracy and everyone else around her is so total that it's not long before Melanie and her daughter engage in extended screaming matches over a variety of issues. No kid can indulge in these sorts of behaviors while living at home and expect to keep everything under wraps forever, and such is the case with Tracy. Will Tracy survive? Will she ever return to something resembling normalcy? The conclusion to ""Thirteen"" is slightly enigmatic and offers few concrete answers to these questions.""Thirteen"" is often a traumatic movie to watch. Seeing kids of such tender years take part in sordid activities isn't the sort of thing most people like to witness, and the film pulls few punches in its portrayal of such activities. It's sufficient to say that the sorts of things kids deal with today are quite different from the things kids dealt with even ten to fifteen years ago. The movie doesn't spend much time trying to place blame or offer solutions, unfortunately, but instead goes for a value neutral character study. I can't say I agree with this approach, but I do find much to like about the actors playing these individuals. Holly Hunter, a woman who simply looks better and better the older she gets, does a great job playing the put upon Melanie. She goes through stages of depression, despair, anger, and denial while trying to deal with her wayward daughter, and does so convincingly. Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed bring a lot to their respective parts, both tearing up the screen as teens wildly and shockingly out of control. Jeremy Sisto is a promising actor currently building up his filmography, but he doesn't get much to do here.Extras on the ""Thirteen"" disc include a behind the scenes look at the film, a trailer, deleted scenes, and a commentary track. Realistic, raw, unnerving, and likely destined to become some sort of cult classic, ""Thirteen"" is a worthy addition to the ""Teens gone wild"" canon I spoke of earlier. I liked this movie because it dealt with a side of adolescence I knew little to nothing about when I was a similar age, namely what it's like to be a teenage girl. After watching this film, though, I can safely say I'm happy I don't have kids.",4,Grinding look at adolescence,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,5625,"['Thirteen', 'category', 'like', 'call', 'Teens',

792436,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00013RC2K,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","I'm a parent of a young daughter and this has hit me pretty hard because it is associated in today's world. I understand this isn't exactly a true story but I do think that is could easily be based on a true story because I'm almost sure that something very close to this has happened at one point or another. The acting in this movie was some of the best I've seen from this cast. Although it isn't what happens to everyone it is what happens to an unfortunate fraction.There were a few points that just absolutely blew me away with the way they symbolized so much in one shot. I'm not taking any chances but I feel as though I need to place this anyway:***************************Minor Spoiler Alert****************************First: The shot where Evie and Tracy are in the park, Tracy gets high for the first time and they're all laying on the ground. The camera relentlessly spins in circles, is this not symbolic to her life just beginning to spin out of control. Second: During her ""No Bra, No Panties..."" attack Tracy steps into the shadows. When she stops her advance on her mother there is only a small patch of light on her face, the rest shrouded in shadows. There's still a small bit of light fighting against the darkness in her head, in her mind.Finally: When Tracy rambles into the bathroom after her teacher sends her to the counselor she meets one of her friends. I don't know if her name was ever mentioned. That's beside the point: Tracy then applies a ridiculous amount of make-up to cover up her scars and her cuts. By this time she has begun to look as pale as the background of the page I'm typing this on. By this time the real Tracy is starting to break-through, screaming to be let out again. The make-up is just more layers for the real Tracy to fight through to get out. And the new Tracy is doing all she can to keep it down, but she can't. Director Catherine Hardwick made this movie work.**************************************************************************Anyways, after watching this there are some of the best performances, scenes and shots I've seen. I'm not a professional movie writer, I don't get invited to movie festivals in Montreal or New York and I don't get invited to mid-night showings with the actors present; but I do know what it was like to be a teenager and having seen stuff similar to this with my own 2 eyes. It's hard to believe that Nikki Reed had no experience before this film. She absolutely nailed the manipulative attitude of Evie, while also making the viewer like her. Holly Hunter's absolutely blew me away and I can't think of a better performance than Hunter's. You could actually see the terror and panic in her face as she watched her daughter slowly slip deeper and deeper into trouble. ""Thirteen"" packs a whole lot into an hour and a half, and, for that matter, into one girl. It's a movie, after all, but like I said it's very accurate and seems to stretch the fact that it's only a movie. Highly recommended.",5,"""Hit me. I'm serious; I can't feel anything, hit me!

792437,A3QAATYM09AJMU,B00013RC2K,"Jeremy Blake ""*Blake*""","[3, 4]","I don't care what anybody says especially about this movie being unrealistic. Well I can tell you from personal experience, it's VERY realistic. From the sex to the drugs, it's all out there. I am a gay teen & even though I can't relate to these girls' story, I can tell you that my best friend in the entire world has gone through much of what these girls do in this film...from pot to cocaine to sex with boys AND men. It happens more today than anybody is willing to recognize. Speaking from MY personal experiences, I know that every teen at one point or another feels like losing control & just letting go. I know alot of people at my high school that have slit their wrists and overdosed on alchohol. As far as no teen going through ALL of what the characters in Thirteen do, if you believe that, you are blind and in serious denial. Some teens may really have a pretty healthy family life & might be comfortable with who they are, but most of them don't. Because adolescense is when you find yourself and instead of finding themselves, alot of teens lose themselves first.As far as the performances, I was amazed. Evan Rachel Wood is just BRILLIANT as Tracy, especially in one of the ending scenes when things have just gone so far & her mom has come to realise what's going on. Her mom is played by Academy Award Winning Actress Holly Hunter who is superb in her part. Nikki Reed stars as Evie (and also co-wrote the film), a young girl with a harder life than it would seem to be. I loved how Evie so desperately wanted Tracy's mom to adopt her. Evie had told Tracy's mother that her mom had died and that her caretaker was her aunt. But really, her aunt WAS her mom...she just didn't want to live with her, because of all the abuse she was being put through. In the end when Evie is sent back to her mother, she turns on Tracy & exposes what they have been doing, blaming it all on Tracy.The story is just so moving & really gives the viewer a look into what really goes on with teens today. All the time, it just seems to start at a younger and younger age. I know that this really happens, because it has happened to me and people all around me. This shouldn't be that surprising to people or parents and should really open their eyes and give them a look into the world that alot of troubled teens are diving into. I also loved how the media presence could be felt and seen throughout the entire film, especially those glamourized eyes. If you look closely, the picture that we see on the sign throughout the movie gets dirtier and more vandilized as Tracy loses herself more and more.With that said, I think this movie is THE most realistic portrayal of teen life that I've ever seen. The DVD is brilliant also. The menu is set up beautifully & the special features are great also. There's audio commentary featuring the cast and the director/co-writer, the theatrical trailer, and the featurette ""The Making Of Thirteen"" which has great interviews with the cast of the film. This is a must see for everyone. Rent it at least, it's a treasure not to be missed. And there's no happy ending, giving everyone an easy solution. Just a simple scream, because as much as Tracy and every other teen in the world would appreciate a happy ending, there's still many years ahead & alot of obstacles to overcome.",5,Realistic Look On Today's Youth,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,3315,"['do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anybody', 'especially', 'movie', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'Well', 'can', 'tell', 'personal', 'experience', 'VERY', 'realistic', 'sex', 'drugs', 'there', 'am', 'gay', 'teen', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'girls', 'story', 'can', 'tell', 'best', 'friend', 'entire', 'world', 'gone', 'much', 'what', 'girls', 'do', 'film', 'pot', 'cocaine', 'sex', 'boys', 'men', 'more', 'today', 'anybody', 'willing', 'recognize', 'Speaking', 'MY', 'personal', 'experiences', 'know', 'teen', 'one', 'point', 'feels', 'losing', 'control', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'know', 'alot', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'slit', 'wrists', 'overdosed', 'alchohol', 'As', 'far', 'teen', 'going', 'ALL', 'what', 'characters', 'Thirteen', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'blind', 'serious', 'denial', 'teens', 'may', 'really', 'have', 'pretty', 'healthy', 'family', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'comfortable', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'adolescense', 'when', 'find', 'instead', 'finding', 'alot', 'teens', 'lose', 'first.As', 'far', 'performances', 'was', 'amazed', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'just', 'BRILLIANT', 'Tracy', 'especially', 'one', 'ending', 'scenes', 'when', 'things', 'have', 'just', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'mom', 'come', 'realise', 'what', 'going', 'mom', 'played', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'Actress', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'who', 'superb', 'part', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Evie', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'harder', 'life', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'loved', 'how', 'Evie', 'so', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'Tracy', 'mom', 'adopt', 'Evie', 'had', 'told', 'Tracy', 'mother', 'mom', 'had', 'died', 'caretaker', 'was', 'aunt', 'really', 'aunt', 'WAS', 'mom', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'abuse', 'was', 'being', 'put', 'end', 'when', 'Evie', 'sent', 'back', 'mother', 'Tracy', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'blaming', 'Tracy.The', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'moving', 'really', 'viewer', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'teens', 'today', 'time', 'just', 'start', 'younger', 'younger', 'age', 'know', 'really', 'happened', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'people', 'parents', 'should', 'really', 'open', 'eyes', 'give', 'look', 'world', 'alot', 'troubled', 'teens', 'are', 'diving', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'media', 'presence', 'could', 'be', 'felt', 'seen', 'entire', 'film', 'especially', 'glamourized', 'eyes', 'look', 'closely', 'picture', 'see', 'sign', 'movie', 'dirtier', 'more', 'vandilized', 'Tracy', 'more', 'more.With', 'said', 'think', 'movie', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'teen', 'life', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'brilliant', 'also', 'menu', 'set', 'up', 'beautifully', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'cast', 'director/co-writer', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'featurette', 'Making', 'Thirteen', 'great', 'interviews', 'cast', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'everyone', 'Rent', 'least', 'treasure', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'happy', 'ending', 'giving', 'everyone', 'easy', 'solution', 'Just', 'simple', 'scream', 'as', 'much', 'Tracy', 'other', 'teen', 'world', 'would', 'appreciate', 'happy', 'ending', 'still', 'many', 'years', 'ahead', 'alot', 'obstacles', 'overcome']",Thirteen

Hunter's mother character is world-weary, trying to keep her head above water while staying sober, making ends meet, and trying her damndest to reach out to her 13-year-old daughter.  Wood's character is rebelling in the worst way, throwing every one of her mother's actions back in her face, exploding at the drop of a hat, and trying to form her own identity (albeit not a very positive one).  Any mother-daughter pair will recognize themselves in the elements of the movie, as the mom tries to please her daughter and the daughter gets irritated with every maneuver.The Evie character (Nikki Reed, co-writer of the story) was a master manipulator, wise beyond her years.  She managed to win over the mom, to play herself off as a victim of abuse, while she was actually the driving force ruining the daughter's life.This isn't just a movie about a 13-year-old, although her antics makes for some of the best screentime.

792443,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00013RC2K,Joe Sherry,"[0, 1]","A film by Catherine Hardwicke""Thirteen"" tells the story of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a thirteen year old girl who, up until this point, has been a good girl.  She loves her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter), and listens to her.  She is not a very popular girl in school, though she does have her own friends.  We see her longing for a great social acceptance than what she has.  When Melanie's former addict ex-boyfriend comes back into the picture despite Melanie's previous promise that he will never be back, Tracy is hurt, upset, and angry.  From this she begins to take her first steps of rebellion.  Evie (Nikki Reed) is one of the most popular girls in school, as well as the hottest (as described by Tracy's brother).  It is obvious from the start that Tracy would like to be friends with Evie and perhaps have Evie's life.The movie doesn't actually start here.  The movie starts with Tracy and Evie (both of them then unnamed) sitting on a bed, huffing from an aerosol can, and hitting each other in the face and laughing because they can't feel their faces.  The movie then moves to four months earlier when we see the more innocent Tracy, the pre-Evie Tracy.  Tracy tries to get the chance to hang out with Evie, but gets brushed to the side with every opportunity.  When she sees Evie shoplifting Tracy is first shocked but then very quickly sees an opportunity.  Tracy steals an older woman's wallet without getting caught and runs up to Evie, tells her what she did, and shares the money.  Evie and Tracy go on a little shopping spree and just like that they are inseparable.Tracy is still fairly innocent, but the more time she spends with Evie the more she experiences: drugs, sex, alcohol, stealing, skipping classes, disobeying her mother, cursing at her mother.  We watch as Tracy's life begins to spiral out of control and Melanie sees what is happening, though she does not really understand why, and she is powerless to stop it.  Melanie is a recovering alcoholic herself, but she is doing the best she can as a single mother.  She is all heart, and other than her relationship with the ex-boyfriend I'm not sure she really does anything wrong to drive Tracy away.That is perhaps the one flaw in this movie.  I had a difficult time figuring out Tracy's motivation for rebelling.  I understood the desire for social acceptance, but not the driving need for it, and the film never explained that.  Despite that lack of explanation on Tracy's motivation, this movie is filled with realistic, powerful performances.  I believed the characters were who they were supposed to be rather than just actors playing a role.  Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed had absolutely standout roles and they both did a fine job.  Younger actors always seem to be the most difficult to cast because they often sound wooden when speaking their lines, but not Evan or Nikki, they were spot on.  Nikki Reed should be highlighted as well because at age 13 she co-wrote this movie with the director and is now only 16 years old.  What a debut (both in acting as well as screenwriting)!""Thirteen"" is a movie that, if I was a parent, would scare me.  It tells me that even if I don't do anything really wrong or bad, if I'm not careful my daughter can still fall into the wrong crowd and go down a very harmful path.  What is perhaps most frightening is that it is obvious from the movie that even before Tracy met Evie and started drinking and doing drugs that Tracy already had problems.  Tracy is a cutter.

Evan-Rachel-Wood@yahoogroups.com, which I first joined when I heard she was part of 'The Missing' cast. I first thought 'Thirteen' was a movie already out on DVD. Then I found it hadn't been released in Australia at the cinemas.When it was released at the cinemas in Australia it was only atselected cinemas. One that wasn't exactly five minutes away but acinema I always tried to get to each week. Finally I got to one of the cinemas it was playing at, and found it had just finished beingshown at that cinema. Instead my twin brother Stephen and I went and saw 'Monster'. That was an excellent movie. I'm glad I saw it. So I waited for 'Thirteen' on DVD.This movie was shot in twenty seven days, and on a cheap budget. All but two of the shots are hand held. Steven Spielberg's film 'Catch Me If You Can', was also shot in twenty seven days.One of the images I thought was so effective is of Evan and NikkiReed sticking their tongues out showing off their tongue rings. Ireally like it to try and sell this movie.The music is also great. Some tracks I enjoy on the CD and in thefilm, in no special order are Katy Rose - 'Lemon', Clinic - 'TheEqualiser', Liz Phair 'Head Underwater'. Mark Mothersbaugh - Score -'The Shoot Out', Mark Mothersbaugh ''Hit Me' and Folk Implosion - 'Make It With The Best'.I also love the dull colour pallet in some of the scenes. It isreally appropriate. Another film I really love with a slightly blue tinge colour to it is 'Crazy/Beautiful' with Kirsten Dunst. Another with a blue colour change is 'Underworld'. I think colour changes infilm will continue to make films that little bit different then therest and more interesting. 'Man On Fire' is another with film colour issues. Although I didn't like that film so much.'Thirteen's tagline 'They're not little girls anymore' is great. I also think 'Filmink's comment ""...an emotional firebomb..."" Totally compelling"" is exactly right.'Thirteen' is rated MA 15+ for adult themes, drug use.This is not always an easy movie to watch. When Evan's characterTracy cuts her wrists on several occasions during the film I think Evan was just so brave to do this movie. Evan is a great girl I imagine, and it is hard to watch someone inflict what would be excruciating pain on themselves. I'm glad the tongue rings and bellybutton rings were not real. More painful procedures I'm sure. I'd never want a tongue ring or want to slit my wrists. I don't know how Evan did those scenes.I like how it ends because her troubles are only just starting. She has a long way to go yet. It's a little sad at the same time.Spoiling one's body, and having to deal with major issues so young. I wouldn't want a sequel to this movie but if there was one maybe it could be 'Fourteen'.I wouldn't want to be Thirteen again. That's for sure, even though my year was quite good it's still hard for anyone.I am really glad I own this film. It seems very real to me. In astrange way it is now one of my favorite movies. I like to watchteenage related films, and new up-and-comers. I never really used to.It has just evolved. I think teenage films would make for an interesting article one day. 'Mean Girls' is another favorite movie of mine recently. But when it comes to Evan 'Thirteen' will remain a favorite along with 'The Missing'.",5,They're not little girls anymore,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,3647,"[""'re"", 'little', 'saw', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', ""'Simone"", 'maybe', 'two', ""'Once"", 'Again', 'episodes', 'then', 'later', 'Ron', 'Howard', ""'The"", 'Missing', 'wonder', 'where', 'got', 'so', 'grown', 'up', 'will', 'find', 'answers', ""'Thirteen"", 'movie', 'have', 'wanting', 'see', 'ever', 'first', 'heard', 'group', 'dedicated', 'Evan', 'films', 'Yahoo', 'Evan-Rachel-Wood', '@', 'yahoogroups.com', 'first', 'joined', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'part', ""'The"", 'Missing', 'cast', 'first', 'thought', ""'Thirteen"", 'was', 'movie', 'already', 'out', 'DVD', 'Then', 'found', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'Australia', 'cinemas.When', 'was', 'released', 'cinemas', 'Australia', 'was', 'only', 'atselected', 'cinemas', 'One', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'five', 'minutes', 'away', 'acinema', 'always', 'tried', 'get', 'week', 'Finally', 'got', 'one', 'cinemas', 'was', 'playing', 'found', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'beingshown', 'cinema', 'Instead', 'twin', 'brother', 'Stephen', 'went', 'saw', ""'Monster"", 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'So', 'waited', ""'Thirteen"", 'DVD.This', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'twenty', 'seven', 'days', 'cheap', 'budget', 'two', 'shots', 'are', 'hand', 'held', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', ""'Catch"", 'Me', 'Can', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'twenty', 'seven', 'days.One', 'images', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'Evan', 'NikkiReed', 'sticking', 'tongues', 'out', 'showing', 'off', 'tongue', 'rings', 'Ireally', 'try', 'sell', 'movie.The', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'tracks', 'enjoy', 'CD', 'thefilm', 'special', 'order', 'are', 'Katy', 'Rose', ""'Lemon"", 'Clinic', ""'TheEqualiser"", 'Liz', 'Phair', 'Underwater', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'Score', ""-'The"", 'Shoot', 'Out', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'Hit', 'Me', 'Folk', 'Implosion', ""'Make"", ""Best'.I"", 'also', 'love', 'dull', 'colour', 'pallet', 'scenes', 'isreally', 'appropriate', 'film', 'really', 'love', 'slightly', 'blue', 'tinge', 'colour', ""'Crazy/Beautiful"", 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'blue', 'colour', 'change', ""'Underworld"", 'think', 'colour', 'changes', 'infilm', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'films', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'then', 'therest', 'more', 'interesting', ""'Man"", 'Fire', 'film', 'colour', 'issues', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'tagline', ""'re"", 'not', 'little', 'girls', 'anymore', 'great', 'also', 'think', 'comment', 'emotional', 'firebomb', 'Totally', 'compelling', 'exactly', 'right', ""'Thirteen"", 'rated', 'MA', '15+', 'adult', 'themes', 'drug', 'use.This', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'When', 'Evan', 'characterTracy', 'wrists', 'several', 'occasions', 'film', 'think', 'Evan', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'brave', 'do', 'movie', 'Evan', 'great', 'girl', 'imagine', 'hard', 'watch', 'someone', 'inflict', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'excruciating', 'pain', ""'m"", 'glad', 'tongue', 'rings', 'bellybutton', 'rings', 'were', 'not', 'real', 'More', 'painful', 'procedures', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'tongue', 'ring', 'want', 'slit', 'wrists', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Evan', 'did', 'scenes.I', 'how', 'troubles', 'are', 'only', 'just', 'starting', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'yet', 'little', 'sad', 'same', 'time.Spoiling', 'one', 'body', 'having', 'deal', 'major', 'issues', 'so', 'young', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'sequel', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Thirteen', 'again', 'sure', 'even', 'year', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'still', 'hard', 'anyone.I', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'own', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'astrange', 'way', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'like', 'watchteenage', 'related', 'films', 'new', 'up-and-comers', 'never', 'really', 'used', 'to.It', 'just', 'evolved', 'think', 'teenage', 'films', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'article', 'one', 'day', ""'Mean"", 'Girls', 'favorite', 'movie', 'mine', 'recently', 'when', 'Evan', ""'Thirteen"", 'will', 'remain', 'favorite', ""'The"", 'Missing']",Thirteen

While I will give it this, it does try to be different. It falls short into trying to "" shock"" an audience. The movie centers around a thirteen (hence the title) year old girl, who in the beggining is the cliche good girl but by the end, is the cliche bad girl. Who somehow, within 48 hours goes from being a kind sweet innocent girl, to stealing money from others. Which is a little unrealistic. Being 16 myself and knowing the negative effects of peer pressure (or atleast from a male point of view) I know it is though but to totally throw any morals you have so quickly seems ""odd"" to say the least. Being that her mom seems to have a drinking problem ( not to mention an attraction to younger white trash guys) doesn't help the problem. In fact, every adult in this movie seems to be oblivious to what their kids are doing. So, as the movie goes on, the girl's go on a downward spiral involving drugs, sex,  self mutilation alcohal and so on and so forth. Another thing I found hard to believe was, these girl's seem to act as today's 15, 16 and 17 year old girl's do. Not 13. However, the one scary realistic part of this movie is that, this could be how girl's that age in 5 or 10 years act if people don't start giving a s*it.P.S. the soundtrack is also poor, I would recommend something along the lines of black metal, death metal, hardcore, metalcore, speed/thrash metal and so on.

792447,A1CSVCTXQV2YO1,B00013RC2K,John Wao,"[0, 1]","I liked this movie mainly because of the acting performances. Holly Hunter is great as the mom who watches her daughter transform into a minion of hell. Wood (Tracie) is great as the goody two shoes who turns to the dark side, and Reed (Evie) is great as the conniving, evil girl who seduces Wood. All three performance deserve recognintion. The problem I had with this movie is, if this movie were intended to scare kids away from this type of behaviour it certainly doesn't do a good job. Here are some problems I have 1. why does a goody two shoes all of a sudden decide she needs to walk on the wild side with a girl she doesn't know? 2. The two girls are constantly stealing from eveyone but they never caught. 3. Here are two girls who can't weigh more than 80 lbs. apiece and yet they consume all the alcohol and drugs they want without throwing up, without passing out, or without overdosing. 4. They have all the sex they want (at least in Evie's case) without getting pregnant or getting a STD. 5. Finally here are two beautiful scantilly-dressed girls who spend all hours of the night high on drugs, hanging out with boys way older than them, in the seamier parts of town, and they never once get raped, molested, or kidnapped. The only real problem Tracy seems to have is her parents divorce and her mother's new boyfriend. The only person who really suffers in this movie is the mother (at least that part is real).

I don't really think this film is a shock for parents but more of a wake up call to let them know what they think they know they really don't know. Thirteen also presents the problem of the single mother that gives her child space and whatever else she can but her daughter is still going in the wrong direction. She was an A student and the perfect happy daughter but peer pressure is all it takes to change someone.The amount of bad language is right on target and some may say it's not but I know tons of kids that learn bad words before and while their in elementary school. Thirteen is a tender age and how can you say this is an unrealistic movie when you see kids this age on TV all the time and they go from perfect kids to disrespecting their parents, getting terrible grades, doing drugs, and anything else that is a parent's nightmare. Not every child is the same nor is the community that surrounds them but even with good support this happens and it happens more than people think. Thirteen shows the truth and no not all teens do this but a good percentage of them do.It shows the teen life in a way that all teens know but adults do not and if thirteen is this bad wait till people see how hard it is being sixteen and seventeen these days. The acting is sharp and the kids do look like they're thirteen. It's a good film for a teen to watch with their mom and dad and every once in a while during the movie parents ask your kid if they are having these types of problems.",5,I Didn't Find It Hard To Believe,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1639,"['have', 'seen', 'tons', 'reviews', 'film', 'say', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'lot', 'say', ""n't"", 'one', 'say', 'movie', 'very', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'film', 'shock', 'parents', 'more', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Thirteen', 'also', 'problem', 'single', 'mother', 'child', 'space', 'else', 'can', 'daughter', 'still', 'going', 'wrong', 'direction', 'was', 'A', 'student', 'perfect', 'happy', 'daughter', 'peer', 'pressure', 'change', 'someone.The', 'amount', 'bad', 'language', 'right', 'target', 'may', 'say', 'not', 'know', 'tons', 'kids', 'learn', 'bad', 'words', 'elementary', 'school', 'Thirteen', 'tender', 'age', 'how', 'can', 'say', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'kids', 'age', 'TV', 'time', 'go', 'perfect', 'kids', 'disrespecting', 'parents', 'getting', 'terrible', 'grades', 'doing', 'drugs', 'anything', 'else', 'parent', 'nightmare', 'Not', 'child', 'same', 'community', 'even', 'good', 'support', 'more', 'people', 'think', 'Thirteen', 'truth', 'not', 'teens', 'do', 'good', 'percentage', 'do.It', 'teen', 'life', 'way', 'teens', 'know', 'adults', 'do', 'not', 'thirteen', 'bad', 'wait', 'till', 'people', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'being', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'days', 'acting', 'sharp', 'kids', 'do', 'look', ""'re"", 'thirteen', 'good', 'film', 'teen', 'watch', 'mom', 'dad', 'once', 'while', 'movie', 'parents', 'ask', 'kid', 'are', 'having', 'types', 'problems']",Thirteen

Nothing in this movie is original and at times it does seem preposterous and farfetched.Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is one of those girls who dresses in clothes that are not in style and does well in her class works. She gets ridiculed because of her socks, which is quite childish even it is simply a teenager making those comments. She is not popular and hangs out with those that are like her, and of course, she is envious of those girls who are popular with the boys. I don&#65533;t need to continue for you to know how this will play out.Evie (Nikke Reed) on the contrary, is the most popular girl and &#65533;hottest looking&#65533; girl in school. She is conniving for she at first gives Tracy a false number and then shoplifts at a store. Trying to gain their friendship, Tracy steals a ladies wallet and goes on a shopping spree with her new gal pals. Tracy gets a whole new make out with provocative clothes and makeup and her life has completely turned upside down. This is one of the problems with &#65533;Thirteen.&#65533; The film is trying to convince us of Tracy&#65533;s sins with piercing and revealing clothes. It makes stereotypes to those who have piercing or wear sexy clothes as sinful.Holly Hunter plays Tracy&#65533;s mom Melanie. She has a salon in her house and earns her living through it. She is apparently divorced and has a few problems within her little world also. She can barely contain her changed daughter and has a boyfriend named Brady (Jeremy Sisto) who has taken advantage of Melanie before. This is a typical setting for a movie involving the breakdown of a young teenage girl succumbing to peer pressure.It would not be a movie about teenagers if it did not have sex and drugs. Tracy and Evie inhale, drink, sniffs, and smokes. Every scene in this movie dealing with drugs is fabricated. The movie opens with Tracy and Evie inhaling and punching and slapping each other with humor. It&#65533;s more comical than it is disturbing. They make their money by also selling drugs but where did they get it in the first place? I just didn&#65533;t buy the fact that as they were using these drugs that they did not have a bit of conscience and hesitation.

Great - except she says she had little to do with the subsequent rewrites. The movie was produced as an ""independent"" by a first-time director, so not much money was available, and it was hurriedly shot in less than 30 days. This means that there were seldom more than one or two takes per scene, tending not to produce the best result.I found both lead girls fairly convincing as 15-year olds, but much less so as the 13-year olds they portray. They and their friends just seemed too old.As someone else astutely posted, the movie ""Christiane F."" is a much better look at problems of underaged girls. However, it is in German with English subtitles, or in poorly dubbed English.

It all begins when Tracy returns to school in seventh grade with her friends where they notice the attention that one of the ""cool"" girl's receives from the boys.  This attention is something that Tracy perceives as positive, and something she would like to receive as well.  She is also ridiculed for the clothes she is wearing, which is hurting her self-esteem.  At home Tracy's mother (Holly Hunter) is more of a friend than a mother.  Therefore, Tracy seeks out the ""cool"" girl, Evie, who offers Tracy the affection and care that she wants.  However, Evie's coolness brings Tracy down on a dangerous path where she seeks out self-reassurance through drugs, petty-crime, eating disorders, and other delinquent behaviors.  Thirteen is a strong film that can be compared to similar films such as Pixote (1981), Kids (1995), L.I.E. (2001), and City of God (2001), which all deal with children and teenagers that have been mislead onto a harmful path in the beginning of their lives.  In Thirteen, the cast brings out solid performances to the screen which colors the characters and enhances the realistic environment in which Tracy is growing up.

It's a well scripted, well woven drama that tugs at the heart and the mind. Sometimes, difficult to watch, but rewarding as well.The thing to remember about this film is the acting and the script. Very well done on both accounts. I escpecially like the performance by Holly Hunter, who I felt, was very properly cast as the young girl's single mother. And brought quite a bit of realism to the whole thing. The acting on all the other fronts are quite good with the character of Tracy leading the pack.The directing here has a very arthouse feel to it, which suits this movie just fine, I thought. Overall, a very realistic and entertaining film about a chunk of these people's lives. The only thing I thought would have been better is if the director took the experiences that Tracy had a little deeper and explained her state of mind and emotions more at the time of the incident, but again, I'm nit picking here.If you're into real life dramas with a volume of risque material, then you have found a winner.

792459,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00013RC2K,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","Evan Rachel Wood continues to make her bid to be the Jodie Foster of her generation in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; a harrowing film about a good little girl gone horribly bad.  Wood is Tracy, a seventh grader who lives with her single mom (Holly Hunter), a hairdresser who works out of the home.  Tracy dreams of being cool, just like Evie (Nikki Reed), and when the opportunity comes to ingratiate herself with the cool girls, Tracy takes it and quickly moves from shoplifting, low-rise jeans and hoochie tops to drugs, body piercings, bad boys, oral sex, and worse.  Evie even moves into Tracy's home, and it becomes clear that this is a troubled girl who has made shoplifting, drugs, and sex part of her daily routine.The script for &quot;Thirteen&quot; was written in six days by director Catherine Hardwicke and Nikki Reed.  Hardwicke had dated Reed's divorced dad and having known Nikki since she was a little girl was distressed when the kid turned 13 and starting having problems (problems like what happens to Tracy in this film).  Hardwicke suggested Nikki keep a journal and intervened in the young girl's life, taking her to museums and exposing her to the larger world.  However, it was Nikki's journey through the dark side that serves as the basis for this film.The result is a story that retains its rawness even as we are mesmerized by the performances of the three female leads.  For every &quot;cool&quot; scene, such as when Evie dressed for a date by taking off her skirt, moving her tank top down as a skirt and adding a new blouse, there are scenes that no kid is going to want to emulate, as when Tracy starts cutting herself.  Meanwhile, her mother, a recovering alcoholic, finds herself helpless to do anything about her daughter's death spiral once she finally notices the radical changes that Tracy has undergone.  It is not that Melanie does not care, but that she is powerless.  Having been abandoned by her husband, Melanie finds her daughter has no use for her either.The big question with &quot;Thirteen&quot; is whether young teenage girls who get to watch this deservedly R-rated film would understand that it was a warning or whether they would just filter the horror story through the prism of their adolescent notions of coolness.  Hardwicke follows Tracy's descent but never buys into the idea it is a good thing.  This is made clear by the opening scene where the two girls, while doing drugs, have made their faces numb so that they do not feel anything and starting hitting each other in the face, laughing hysterically all the time.  The point of the opening scene is clear: Tracy does not know what she is doing to herself.Hardwicke won the Director's Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Hunter is up for an Oscar, and Wood was nominated for a Golden Globe.  &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; argued that Wood should receive serious consideration to become the youngest nominee the Best Actress Oscar in history and surprisingly that indeed happen this year, except that the nomination went to Keisha Castle-Hughes for &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;  Special mention should be made of Jeremy Sisto's performance as Brady, Melanie's boyfriend and another recovering alcoholic, who manages to play a pivotal role in the climax by providing the push Melanie needs to finally deal with Tracy.  The &quot;bad boyfriend&quot; is a stereotypical role in so many films, that it is a shock to see one be different in such a subtle way.&quot;Thirteen&quot; is a brutally honest film, the sort that you might never see again because once was enough, thank you very much.  The emotional conclusion is powerful, but I would not say it qualifies as being truly cathartic.  If there is a lesson here for parents it would simply be that when your children undergo radical transformations, of any type and in any direction, pay attention, because it could be too late sooner than you think.",5,Every parent's nightmare about how good girls go bad,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,3905,"['Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'make', 'bid', 'be', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'generation', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'harrowing', 'film', 'good', 'little', 'girl', 'gone', 'horribly', 'bad', 'Wood', 'Tracy', 'seventh', 'grader', 'who', 'single', 'mom', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'hairdresser', 'who', 'home', 'Tracy', 'dreams', 'being', 'cool', 'just', 'Evie', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'when', 'opportunity', 'ingratiate', 'cool', 'girls', 'Tracy', 'quickly', 'moves', 'shoplifting', 'low-rise', 'jeans', 'hoochie', 'tops', 'drugs', 'body', 'piercings', 'bad', 'boys', 'oral', 'sex', 'worse', 'Evie', 'even', 'Tracy', 'home', 'clear', 'troubled', 'girl', 'who', 'made', 'shoplifting', 'drugs', 'sex', 'part', 'daily', 'routine.The', 'script', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'was', 'written', 'six', 'days', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Hardwicke', 'had', 'dated', 'Reed', 'divorced', 'dad', 'having', 'known', 'Nikki', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'distressed', 'when', 'kid', 'turned', '13', 'starting', 'having', 'problems', 'problems', 'what', 'Tracy', 'film', 'Hardwicke', 'suggested', 'Nikki', 'keep', 'journal', 'intervened', 'young', 'girl', 'life', 'taking', 'museums', 'exposing', 'larger', 'world', 'However', 'was', 'Nikki', 'journey', 'dark', 'side', 'basis', 'film.The', 'result', 'story', 'rawness', 'even', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'performances', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'quot', 'cool', 'quot', 'scene', 'such', 'when', 'Evie', 'dressed', 'date', 'taking', 'off', 'skirt', 'moving', 'tank', 'top', 'down', 'skirt', 'adding', 'new', 'blouse', 'are', 'scenes', 'kid', 'going', 'want', 'emulate', 'when', 'Tracy', 'cutting', 'Meanwhile', 'mother', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'helpless', 'do', 'anything', 'daughter', 'death', 'spiral', 'once', 'finally', 'radical', 'changes', 'Tracy', 'undergone', 'not', 'Melanie', 'not', 'care', 'powerless', 'Having', 'been', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'Melanie', 'daughter', 'use', 'either.The', 'big', 'question', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'young', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'get', 'watch', 'deservedly', 'R-rated', 'film', 'would', 'understand', 'was', 'warning', 'would', 'just', 'filter', 'horror', 'story', 'prism', 'adolescent', 'notions', 'coolness', 'Hardwicke', 'Tracy', 'descent', 'never', 'idea', 'good', 'thing', 'made', 'clear', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'doing', 'drugs', 'have', 'made', 'numb', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'starting', 'hitting', 'other', 'face', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'time', 'point', 'opening', 'scene', 'clear', 'Tracy', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'herself.Hardwicke', 'Director', 'Award', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Hunter', 'up', 'Oscar', 'Wood', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'quot', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'quot', 'argued', 'Wood', 'should', 'receive', 'serious', 'consideration', 'become', 'youngest', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'history', 'surprisingly', 'indeed', 'happen', 'year', 'nomination', 'went', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider.', 'quot', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'performance', 'Brady', 'Melanie', 'boyfriend', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'climax', 'providing', 'push', 'Melanie', 'finally', 'deal', 'Tracy', 'quot', 'bad', 'boyfriend', 'quot', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'shock', 'see', 'one', 'be', 'different', 'such', 'subtle', 'way.', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'quot', 'brutally', 'honest', 'film', 'sort', 'might', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'once', 'was', 'enough', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'emotional', 'conclusion', 'powerful', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'being', 'truly', 'cathartic', 'lesson', 'here', 'parents', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'when', 'children', 'undergo', 'radical', 'transformations', 'type', 'direction', 'pay', 'attention', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'sooner', 'think']",Thirteen

I felt I had just been on a wild roller coaster ride into the lives of a couple of 13-year old girls who are out of control and going too far in their experiments with life.  The film is written directed by Catherine Hardwick who I understand met Nicki Reed, a troubled 13 year old and suggested that she keep a diary. This film is a direct result of that diary with Nicki Reed, who is listed as a co-writer, cast in the role of the bad girl.  The other young star is Evan Rachel Wood, who starts out as a well-behaved seventh grader, but who, under the influence of her friend, starts to run wild too.  Their performances are so real that I cringed constantly, remembering my own early youth.  And then there is Holly Hunter, cast as Evan Rachel Wood's mother who loves her daughter but is overwhelmed with her own life and clueless about how to help.  Some of these scenes between mother and daughter are heart wrenching and tributes to love. This film packs a big punch.Along the way we get a glimpse of the lifestyle of some California teenagers.  O.K.  Maybe they aren't typical.  But they do exist and we pass them on the street every day.  They have pierced tongues and navels.  They wear provocative clothes.  They hang out at the Mall and shoplift like crazy.  Of course there are boys in their lives.  And steamy romances.  And easy access to every kind of drug imaginable.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[3, 4]","From buzz I picked up about Thirteen, and the smutty poster featuring two 'tweens flagrantly showing their tounge piercings,  I believed it to be a documentary of the lives of two thirteen-year old girls.  It wasn't, but what is scary is that it could have been.Thirteen will scare all prospective parents into sterility.  How any parent would deal with a situation like this is not explained in the movie.  Good girl Tracey is influenced by bad girl Evie, and dives headfirst into sex, alcohol, drugs, truancy, and ""cutting"" - but, she was self-injuring before she met Evie.  Tracey's mother, Melanie, is a ""cool"" mom with hippie tendencies.  Holly Hunter is very powerful as Melanie, a recovering alcoholic with a recovering drug addict boyfriend.  Mel is incapable of laying down the law, and gives into Tracey for fear of not being liked.  As Tracey slides deeper into the abyss, with Evie practically living in their house, Mel does not know what to do.  At so many moments in the movie, when her scary, demon child daughter is screaming abuse into her face, you think, ""she's finally going to slap the [...] out of her"" - but she never does.Yet, just because the subject matter is so disturbing and in-your-face doesn't mean you should reject it.  Teens today suffer from a myriad of problems and temptations. Even those who grow up in a stable, two-parent household  succumb to the same self-destructive activities.  Catherine Hardwicke did a fabulous job directing, and it is unusual that Nikki Reed (the 13 yr.-old who plays Evie) co-wrote the screen play with the director.  All the actors and actresses in Thirteen poured their hearts into the film, which was shot 90% on handheld cameras, lending to that documentary feel.  Also interesting is that neither Hardwicke nor Hunter have children.  Hardwicke strongly felt this story needed to be told - and they are right.

The camera shot choices give it a documentary feel and the plot certainly comes across true enough.  It could have very easily fallen into one of those gratuitous teen sex flicks given it's subject matter.  But it never wandered from it's harsh and very real portrayal of a family's struggle by catering to purile interests and believe me, there were plenty of scenes that were of that nature.  Kudos to the director for keeping this movie focused.  In fact, the only scene of nudity involved an adult, the mother, in a totally appropriate scene (coming from the shower).  A very honest movie that touched on what faces the teenagers of today and don't kid yourself that it's only those kids in CA or NY.  Flashes of advertisements showing distorted images of sexuality and beauty were effective and the scenes of socialization could be updated ""Lord of the Flies"".  There were so many social issues that were touched upon that I give it good marks for effort.  I also liked the whole way it dealt with these issues.  However, I couldn't stand the ending and it ruined the overall movie experience for me.  I hate it when movies leave the ending open to interpretation just as a method of ending.  This technique can be used effectively when part of the plot itself (Swimming Pool for instance), but it doesn't work here at all.  Leaving it at the mother and daughter scene before that silly playground one would have made it a better film and left this viewer not feeling so let down.

For them the transition period from child to young woman is an interesting, informative journey. Other girls, like Tracy [Evan Rachel Wood] in this movie, find the experience so traumatizing that they crash and burn. A form of madness sets in that affects not only themselves but their families and friends as well.Tracy lives in a lower middle-class suburban home with her mom, Melanie [Holly Hunter], and her slightly older brother, Mason [Brady Corbet]. Her real father could care less about what happens with the family. At her middle school, she attempts to make friends with the beautiful Evie [Nikki Redd], but is rejected as being too childish. Tracy quickly remakes herself by trashing her wardrobe and shoplifting things for Evie. Soon Tracy and Evie are best friends and Melanie, a recovering drug addict, is slow to see the changes in Tracy. When Melanie lets her drug addicted boyfriend move back in, Tracy's rebellion only increases. We also see that Evie is from a dysfunctional family.

792470,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00013RC2K,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 4]","`Thirteen' is scarily graphic, and scarily realistic. This is one of the rare films that can really draw you into the movie, and make you feel like you're involved in the film, instead of just watching from the comfort of your own home. It's easy to guess from the title, that it's a story about a thirteen-year-old, who consequently goes off the rails. Personally, I don't think I ever went through the whole teenage rebellion, going off the rails. I think the worst I've ever done, is get a tattoo, and even then I was the legal age limit, plus, since I couldn't get anyone to accompany me, I had to confess all to my mum, and she accompanied me!My mum and me actually sat and watched this together - she didn't need much persuasion, and she really enjoyed it. If you're a teenage girl, watching this with your mum, then it's a real eye-opener. When you're thirteen, you think you can do anything and be anybody. When you're watching this, you'll find yourself identifying with the characters, thinking ""what if . . ."" Thinking if you'd found different friends in high school, it might have changed the person you are now. Or if you'd changed your friends in high school, or all that kind of thing. It makes you think a lot, especially when you're a person who has been nearly four years out of high school.Of course, this is based in a US high school, around a US lifestyle, but the characters are no different than the characters you'd find in any school, anywhere in the world. There's a few American-isms in this, which changes things, but then you'd find Trace (Evan Rachel Wood) or Evie (Nikki Reed) in any high school.It's hard to believe when you look at Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed (who superbly co-wrote the story) that they're supposed to be playing thirteen-year-olds. They look lots older, and as Nikki says in the `making of' feature, there are lots of thirteen-year-olds, that look like they're eighteen, so they can do more things, that they're not legally supposed to be doing. I know many girls from high school, that are now going about pushing prams, which is a scary thought. But to watch this film, and see drugs, drinking, having underage sex, girls teaching each other to kiss, shoplifting, self-harming . . . the list goes on. And all in the short space of four months. The self-harming is definitely not for the faint-hearted. It's not too bad to start with, when Trace just uses the point of scissors. But when she can't find them, she uses a razor blade, and I could not watch that scene.Holly Hunter is fantastic as Trace's mum, who can't stop her daughter going off the rails. She's 46, and it must have taken a lot of guts to go almost full frontal in this film for her. She's managed to keep herself in great shape for a 46-year-old, but I couldn't do that!Some of the camera work is absolutely amazing, and some of the scenes are very well lit, especially when it's a very poignant or shocking scene, and sometimes they appear to be almost black and white.When children go off the rails, the press and anyone around them will instantly blame the parents. Oh, they came from a bad background, all that kind of thing. What people don't understand is that people can come from a good background, and still go off the rails. But in this movie, Holly Hunter's character of Melanie is portrayed as the bad one, and the one that has made Trace rebel. Trace's dad isn't really on the scene (he appears once during the film, and doesn't really give a damn about his daughter, or his ex-wife is gradually getting to the end of her tether), and her mum is constantly seen smoking, or in bed with a younger man. And Evie eventually ends up staying over so much, that she practically becomes part of the family. It did get a bit confusing, cos Evie could have been calling Mel by her name or ""Mum"" - both words sound too similar, and Evie could have been calling Mel ""Mum"".What I was expecting to see and didn't, was one of the characters getting pregnant. This would have topped this film off, although it probably would have ended differently, if that had happened. This could have easily happened; judging by the fact the amount of young mums going around with babies is getting scarily high. The amount of teenage pregnancies in the UK is higher than anywhere else in the world, although I can't really apply that to this movie, as it's American!This film is like a whirlwind, and will leave you breathless at the end. It's definitely re-watchable, despite being too realistic. Every teenager should see this film, with their mums or alone.

I thought it sounded stupid and melodramatic, so I avoided it. 'Sex, drugs, and catfights!' the headline had read. So a couple years later I decided what the heck, I'll rent it away. I knew it was going to be depressing and dramatic and I was right. It was. It was pretty realistic, yes this stuff does happen to *gasp* even thirteen year-olds, I've seen it with my own two eyes. But the thing is, the thirteen year-olds who are doing this don't even represent half the population of young teens. Most young teens don't act like this, it's only a few groups. So I just wanted to point that out to some people, and settle a compromise between the people who say 'it never happens' and the people who say 'this is completely normal for any young teen'. Anyway on to the movie. The shooting is pretty much low-budget, but that's what you'd expect from an indie film. Not a problem, if you're a fan of indie movies you should be used to this. My only problem with the story was in the beginning, where she becomes friends with Evie. One day Evie and her friend insult her, and the next day all Tracy has to do is wear cool clothes and suddenly Evie lets her hang out with her? It didn't seem very realistic, like the beginning of Evie and Tracy's relationship didn't seem developed enough in the beginning. And another thing I thought was weird with the movie: the two girls were always hanging out with 'bad' guys and all these 'bad' guys just happened to be black. A little weird, isn't that kind of a negative sterotype? It was like they were at a 'ghetto' school yet there wasn't even any black females or white guys, it was all just black guys and white girls. I don't know that part didn't seem realistic, like the director wanted some ethnic diversity but she didn't show it in a very realistic manner. Other than that, the movie wasn't too bad.

Feeling left out and too childish for junior high school, she aspired to be part of the school's hip, worldly crowd, whose center is a girl named Evie (Nikki Reed). Evie takes Tracy under her wing, and soon her world includes sex, drugs, violence and body piercing. Under stress from her new social life and  problems at home, Tracy allows her wild lifestyle to turn into one long self-destructive binge.""Thirteen "" was co-written by director Catherine Hardwicke and Nikki Reed. When Nikki Reed was thirteen years old, she and her friends were involved in the types of behavior depicted in the movie. Catherine Hardwicke was a family friend who encouraged Reed to find creative, as opposed to destructive, outlets for her energy. And one of those outlets was the screenplay for this film. Reed and Hardwicke based ""Thirteen"" on the experiences that Nikki and her friends had at that age. Nikki stars in the movie as well, very convincingly playing the slightly older, manipulative Evie. Evan Rachel Wood is fantastic in the lead role. Her performance as Tracy is one of the best of the 2003. Holly Hunter also strikes a perfect note as Tracy's mother Melanie who sensibly doesn't overreact to the discovery that her daughter is nearly grown and is going through an experimental phase, but becomes concerned when she senses Tracy's life is spinning out of control. The film looks remarkably good for something that was shot in 24 days on a small budget, which is a credit to Catherine Hardwicke and the cast. The performances are impressive. The story is interesting. But I have one apprehension about ""Thirteen"": Audiences tend to take negative or threatening depictions of teenagers in films as an indictment of young people and youth culture in general. I would hate for people to react this way to ""Thirteen"". It certainly isn't the filmmakers' intention. ""Thirteen"" treats young people and counterculture with a matter-of-fact respect that I find refreshing. The film depicts what can happen when people make bad decisions for the wrong reasons without demonizing sex, drugs, or belly rings and without  claiming that young people should act like middle-aged people. It's just about coming of age by extremes.The DVD: Both widescreen and full screen versions are on the same disc! Bonus features include a ""making of"" featurette, an audio commentary by the director and her teenaged cast, deleted scenes, and a theatrical trailer. The ""making of"" documentary is short and includes interviews with the actors. The audio commentary features the comments of director Catherine Hardwicke, Evan Rachel Wood, Nikki Reed, and Brady Corbet, who plays Tracy's brother. The commentary is fun, spontaneous and informative, although I found it difficult to distinguish Nikki Reed's and Evan Rachel Wood's voices. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.

792481,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,B00013RC2K,Movie Fan,"[3, 6]","Dang. What a movie. Despite the great acting, Not very pleasant to watch especially if you have kids this age, and these days are tough to grow up in at this age. Back in the day yes it was common for parents to worry about peer pressure, teen pregnancy, drugs, and the ""wrong"" crowd, and those worries will always be a reality, and the wrong men flock to teenage girls. I remember being 14 and perverted 23 year olds up to 28 year olds tried to ""get"" with me. And now more worries include body peircings, tattoo's, and it's very easy to get without parents knowing, as in this movie all the girl had to do was seduce the tatoo guy, and it's sick but also very true. You'd be surprised how many guys are attracted to very very young girls, and sometimes teens appear to look older, like in this movie, the brunette did not look 14. That is why my mom never let me wear makeup at that age. I can understand why. But the blonde girl looks SO SO young, any guy who'd wanna hook up with someone that young needs to be in jail. This movie may be a little bit of an exageration, but i'm not sure if you've ever seen actual ""out of control"" teens, watch the maury show and see what i mean. It's sad, and the mothers give up on discipline, like the mother in this movie holly hunter i believe she was too passive, and wasnt paying enough attention to her daughter's life and friends. There is no such thing as discipline not working. You can always find a way to get your kid's life straightened out. I think too many parents give up easily, and they tell themselves, i can't stop her. YOU CAN! one thing worked for me, was taking my phone away. That means no communication. Sneaking out, have the cops pick her up believe me one night in juvee will make her cry back into your arms. It's very sad that kids end up dead or pregnant or with std's, but those things can be prevented, if you're committed to your child, and you have the right techinques, and you actually love your kid.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 5]","Drawing more than a few comparisons with Larry Clarke's Kids, Thirteen is actually a great deal more restrained and deals with the subject of burgeoning sexuality among thirteen year-old girls in an extremely tasteful way.  It's safe to say that the movie doesn't for one minute exploit the young girls whose story it's trying to tell.  The basic set-up has Evan Rachel Wood becoming best buds with pretty popular Nikki Reed and before you know it she's dabbling in body piercing, boys and drugs.Thirteen is a difficult movie to review.  Though it has some fantastic performances - not only are the two lead girls impressive, but Holly Hunter is stunning in her role as Wood's confused, terrified hip young mom - it tends to feel a bit overly like a cautionary tale and little else.  The two girls' motives for what they do aren't really explained as anything other than trying to 'fit in', and the breakdown at the end isn't very fulfilling (though in fairness maybe this is the point).  However, it's reasonably hard-hitting, particularly in the scenes where the girls hit each other after drug use because they can't feel anything.  In addition, you can clearly tell Nikki Reed's hand in the scriptwriting process as the movie has a clear 'insider's perspective' feel to it.  In short, though there are many impressive elements to Thirteen, it ignores a lot of the issues surrounding the issues of self-harm and why the transformation in Wood's character is so quick.  Though it's certainly something you'll remember, it's no masterpiece, though this is something in itself compared to the unintelligent and unambitious films on offer most of the year round.",4,Can't tear your eyes away,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1661,"['Drawing', 'more', 'few', 'comparisons', 'Larry', 'Clarke', 'Kids', 'Thirteen', 'actually', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'restrained', 'deals', 'subject', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'thirteen', 'year-old', 'girls', 'extremely', 'tasteful', 'way', 'safe', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one', 'minute', 'young', 'girls', 'story', 'trying', 'tell', 'basic', 'set-up', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'becoming', 'best', 'buds', 'pretty', 'popular', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'know', 'dabbling', 'body', 'piercing', 'boys', 'drugs.Thirteen', 'difficult', 'movie', 'review', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'two', 'lead', 'girls', 'impressive', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'stunning', 'role', 'Wood', 'confused', 'terrified', 'hip', 'young', 'mom', 'feel', 'bit', 'overly', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'little', 'else', 'two', 'girls', 'motives', 'what', 'do', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'explained', 'anything', 'other', 'trying', ""'fit"", 'breakdown', 'end', ""n't"", 'very', 'fulfilling', 'fairness', 'maybe', 'point', 'However', 'reasonably', 'hard-hitting', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'where', 'girls', 'hit', 'other', 'drug', 'use', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'addition', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'hand', 'scriptwriting', 'process', 'movie', 'clear', ""'insider"", 'perspective', 'feel', 'short', 'are', 'many', 'impressive', 'elements', 'Thirteen', 'lot', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'issues', 'self-harm', 'why', 'transformation', 'Wood', 'character', 'so', 'quick', 'certainly', 'something', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'masterpiece', 'something', 'compared', 'unintelligent', 'unambitious', 'films', 'offer', 'most', 'year', 'round']",Thirteen
792483,A38QX8P4F7MKJ0,B00013RC2K,Mr. Dude Man,"[2, 2]","I love movies like this, movies that seem to have been created to spite the box office revenues on which the film industry depends for survival.  It isn't fun, doesn't beg for a sequel, isn't appropriate for children, isn't based on a book or TV show, doesn't have any big-name stars (unless Holly Hunter counts), has no explosions or car chases.  This is film for the sake of things other than box office, a brilliant exercise in scriptwriting and dramatic acting, a warm welcome to the talended Nikki Reed, and a great resum' builder for rising force Evan Rachel Wood, who has previously appeared in a fair number of Hollywood films but this time gets the key to the city in return for her efforts.'Thirteen' plays like a cautionary tale for parents who feel it's too early to worry about what their teens and ""tweens"" are getting into, and for young people who think their extracurricular activities are unendingly harmless and endearing.  It is about how the very act of caring about a child makes a parent un-cool in that child's eyes, how slippery is the slope from getting your first thong to being called a four-letter name by an older woman who's seen your type before and wasn't impressed, and how you can lie down and sleep next to someone who loves you but, eventually, you must wake up and deal with who you are and what you've made of your life.There's another movie here, too, one that takes shape within camera angles and set pieces.  My favorite comes when Tracy and Evie hang out with some young gentlemen who work on a road crew. The play among lawn sprinklers at night, and the camera shows them backlit, almost in silhouette.  The differences among the actors' bodies come across so clearly that I was reminded of the filmstrips on puberty that I saw in grade school. (""Johnny grew four inches over the summer, and his voice is starting to deepen."")  Many of the indoor scenes have an almost documentary feel, as if a camera team were haphazardly filming a real family during a particularly nasty patch.  It is a credit to the actors that watching them in some scenes is like seeing an ugly incident unfold among strangers, where you wish the entire time that you were someplace else but can't stop watching.Something must be said about Evan Rachel Wood.  I think she's the best actor I've ever seen in TV or movies.  Think about how bold that statement is.  I'm not comparing her to Hilary Duff, Kirsten Dunst, Jena Malone, and Mischa Barton.  I'm comparing her with Marlon Brando, Kevin Spacey, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Katherine Hepburn, Jodie Foster and on and on and on, and I'm saying that Evan does things that I've never seen any other actor do.  There is a timeless virtuosity to her best work, something that seems effortless yet conveys the ""fully-baked"" version of her characters' emotions -- not as we've seen them acted on the screen by others, but as we've felt them ourselves.  It seems ridiculous to say that the eighteen-year-old American girl who starred in 'Down Will Come Baby' is the greatest film and television actor of all time, and I'm trying really hard to think of one actor who is legitimately better, but I can't come up with anyone.  I treasure each powerful performance I've seen in the movies -- Sean Penn in 'Mystic River,' Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue in 'Leaving Las Vegas,' Marlon Brando in 'Last Tango in Paris' -- but to be so good over and over again is truly remarkable.  Wood brought me to tears in 'Thirteen,' and she did it at least four times in 'Once and Again.'  She almost had me crying in that stupid Green Day video.  I can't say enough about how awesome she is.  For those who don't know of her, this film is a great introduction; her performance here is emotionally devastating and as powerful as anything I have ever seen.For those who don't care who Evan Rachel Wood is, 'Thirteen' is a great film on its own merits.",5,A masterpiece -- 'Raging Bull' for teenage girls,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,3891,"['love', 'movies', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'spite', 'box', 'office', 'revenues', 'film', 'industry', 'survival', ""n't"", 'fun', ""n't"", 'beg', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'children', ""n't"", 'based', 'book', 'TV', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'big-name', 'stars', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'film', 'sake', 'things', 'other', 'box', 'office', 'brilliant', 'exercise', 'scriptwriting', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'warm', 'welcome', 'talended', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'great', 'resum', 'builder', 'rising', 'force', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'who', 'previously', 'appeared', 'fair', 'number', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'time', 'key', 'city', 'return', 'efforts', 'plays', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'parents', 'who', 'feel', 'too', 'early', 'worry', 'what', 'teens', 'tweens', 'are', 'getting', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'are', 'unendingly', 'harmless', 'endearing', 'how', 'very', 'act', 'caring', 'child', 'parent', 'un-cool', 'child', 'eyes', 'how', 'slippery', 'slope', 'getting', 'first', 'thong', 'being', 'called', 'four-letter', 'name', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'seen', 'type', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'how', 'can', 'lie', 'down', 'sleep', 'next', 'someone', 'who', 'eventually', 'must', 'wake', 'up', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'what', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movie', 'here', 'too', 'one', 'shape', 'camera', 'angles', 'set', 'pieces', 'favorite', 'when', 'Tracy', 'Evie', 'hang', 'out', 'young', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'work', 'road', 'crew', 'play', 'lawn', 'sprinklers', 'night', 'camera', 'backlit', 'almost', 'silhouette', 'differences', 'actors', 'bodies', 'come', 'so', 'clearly', 'was', 'reminded', 'filmstrips', 'puberty', 'saw', 'grade', 'school', 'Johnny', 'grew', 'four', 'inches', 'summer', 'voice', 'starting', 'deepen', 'Many', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'have', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'camera', 'team', 'were', 'haphazardly', 'filming', 'real', 'family', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'patch', 'credit', 'actors', 'watching', 'scenes', 'seeing', 'ugly', 'incident', 'unfold', 'strangers', 'where', 'wish', 'entire', 'time', 'were', 'someplace', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching.Something', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'think', 'best', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'movies', 'Think', 'how', 'bold', 'statement', ""'m"", 'not', 'comparing', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Mischa', 'Barton', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Jodie', 'Foster', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Evan', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'actor', 'do', 'timeless', 'virtuosity', 'best', 'work', 'something', 'effortless', 'yet', 'conveys', 'fully-baked', 'version', 'characters', 'emotions', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'acted', 'screen', 'others', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'eighteen-year-old', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'starred', ""'Down"", 'Will', 'Come', 'Baby', 'greatest', 'film', 'television', 'actor', 'time', ""'m"", 'trying', 'really', 'hard', 'think', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'legitimately', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anyone', 'treasure', 'powerful', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'Sean', 'Penn', ""'Mystic"", 'River', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', ""'Leaving"", 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Marlon', 'Brando', ""'Last"", 'Tango', 'Paris', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'over', 'again', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Wood', 'brought', 'tears', ""'Thirteen"", 'did', 'least', 'four', 'times', ""'Once"", 'Again', 'almost', 'had', 'crying', 'stupid', 'Green', 'Day', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'awesome', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'great', 'introduction', 'performance', 'here', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'as', 'powerful', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'merits']",Thirteen

No, &quot;Thirteen&quot; most definitely isn't in the horror flick genre, but it's ability to frighten speaks to the film's unflinching portrait of the pressures of adolescence for young girls becoming women.

Her performance is honest, true, and entirely believable.

792487,ADYNO5CD0GVFE,B00013RC2K,"Mud Pyramid ""rilaly""","[2, 2]","You will not be able to leave this movie unaffected.  Do not ask me what prompted me to view this movie.  I do not have children, and I have not watched a teeny bopper movie in about 20 years.  I'm so glad I watched it though.  The message to this movie is the unspoken message.  First, let's get one fact out of the way: All parents love their children.  Also, all parents want to achieve the love of their children.  Holly Hunter displays an all too real 21st century parent who does what she can to achieve her child's love to her own fault.  In essence, this desire to have her child love her makes her weak.  She turns her head when her child comes home with lavish purchases.  She ignores the child's abberant behavior with the idea that the girl is a teen, and she fights with the child as one would a sibling. Hunter's character is weakened by a divorce and a past substance abuse problem, so she has given the child ammunition. The child, of course, attacks her mother's weaknesses, and the mother is wounded by these assaults.  This societal malady is portrayed with cringing credibility by Hunter.  Again, I understand that a parent wants their child to love them, and I can understand that the teen years can overwhelm a parent when faced with the shock and awe attack a teen will use on a parent to assert control.  I'm left with the thought, however, that a parent must endure these attacks with strength.  Allow the child to call you a hypocrite for your activities versus your teachings, allow them to swarm you with attacks on the weaknesses you display, then remain strong for them.  Many parents strive to be buddies with their kids, and they strive to avoid the mistakes that their parents made, but en route to these goals they forget the awesome responsibility of parenthood: to raise a moral and decent adult.  Anyone who is a parent of a teen should watch this movie as a harrowing example of what not to do.  I am awed by the fact that this movie was written by such a young person, because it is so comprehensive in its detail.

This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self-mutilation and all the other methods of traditional teenage rebellion. Tracy comes from a broken home, although her mother, Mel, played by Holly Hunter, seems like a reasonably caring and open-minded individual, even though, in the way she acts and dresses, she seems like little more than a teenager herself. It is this lack of a adult figure in her life that makes Tracy turn to other vices and influences around her.Hardwicke has provided a raw, up front straight forward picture of teenage values in our modern culture. The film doesn't speak for all teenagers, of course, but it does speak for alot of them, narrowing in on the kinds of dysfunctional lives so many of them are forced to live through on their path to adulthood. first time director hardwicke never plays down the graphic detail the realities of Tracy's life, making us see how the need for peer acceptance, an unstable family life and a permissive, valueless society all contribute to the problems children like Tracy face in coming to terms with who they really are.Wood provides stunning believable portrait of a young girl in search of her sense of self and her own unique identity unfortunately she tries to find herself through destructive behavior..Nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self-destruction. Her performance is gripping ,Atonshing is that reed also co wrote the script for Thirteen.Mel won't be winning any Mother of the Year contests any time soon, but she is a caring person who can't understand what is happening to the daughter she loves. Holly Hunter gives the performance of her career, making the mother neither a hero nor a villain, just a recognizable human being.Hardwicke has chosen to employ a shakey, handheld camera technique which helps make this film seem like a piece of reality.""Thirteen"" is a gritty and some times distrubing film on an important topic, a topic that alot of teens are screaming to let the world know.

Her new friendship with the popular and alluring Evie (Nikki Reed who also co-wrote the film) begins Tracy's downward spiral, while her recovering alcoholic mother (Holly Hunter in an Oscar nominated role) struggles to maintain her fractured family life.

The story by Nikki Reed is amazing, considering that she was a teenager when she wrote this.  And, she is an outstanding actress as well, playing the dark, conniving, manipulative friend of Evan Rachel Wood.  Having only seen Evan in a sweet children's movie, her performance is a revelation.  She was able to express the full range of emotions of a young teenage girl with total believability.  I do not know if this movie is a must-see for all parents of teenage girls, as well as the girls themselves or whether it just too painful for parents to see.  It shows just how difficult it is to raise a child in a single parent home.  And, Holly Hunter's mother is another in a long line of great performances by the actress.  Her intensity, pathos, empathy and pain are all readily experienced by the viewer.  The difficulties which she must take on as a parent seem overwhelming, and in some ways insurmountable.

792494,A1HVJELFV84ISH,B00013RC2K,QUEEN_OF_EVERYTHING,"[9, 15]","An independent film co-written by an actual teenage girl named Nikki Reed, THIRTEEN takes you on a harrowing, horrifying adventure into the lives of real 13 year olds who are in the 7th grade.  This is their world, filled with the dangers of drugs, sex, and other risky activities.Yeah, right.The leads include the talented Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter.  And then there is the case of a not-so-talented lead, Nikki Reed.  More on her later.Catherine Hardwicke is the director of this indie flick - she is also a friend to Reed.  The result of their pooled efforts is a film that looks like a documentary, giving you a YOU ARE HERE sort of vibe.  The downside?  The girls look older than 13 year-old 7th graders.  They are, in fact.  Wood and Reed were both fifteen during the time the film was shot.  Had the film been called FIFTEEN, I may have liked it that much better.Yes, 13 year olds have sex - they have been for some time. I know that.  Other aspects seemed to be placed in the film just to shock.  The girls get stoned and punch each other multiple times, until one of them goes careening off the bed and hits the floor.""Hit me.  Harder!  I can't feel anything!""I guess that scene was put in to shock.  All it made me do was laugh.  Yes, I know, I know.  I shouldn't find humor in such frighteningly ""real"" situations, should I?If Hardwicke had used actual 13 year old girls, the story may have been a tad more believable.  But quite frankly, I kept forgetting the movie was all about 13 year olds!  Whenever the girls partake in illicit activities, my reaction was, ""Here we go again."" ::eyeroll::Holly Hunter is very good as Traci's (Wood) mother, who's got issues of her own.  Perhaps this is why her little girl ends up on the wrong path, being that troubled children ALWAYS come from broken homes (can ya recognize sarcasm when you hear it?).  Wood is good as Traci - her middle name is Lords.  Prior to letting Evie (Reed) corrupt her, she's a sweet little angel, writer of bad poetry with a few good friends.  We never find out why Traci wants to be popular, simply that she just wants to be.  Guess her loyal and normal friends aren't good enough.  We never find out why that is...A friendship develops between Traci and Evie in a matter of 5 minutes.  These girls work fast.  Ha.  And in more ways than one.Traci was a wonderful student in school, very bright, very smart.  Yet for some reason, she isn't bright enough to stay away from a girl like Evie.  Go figure.Soon, the girls are up to all sorts of illicit activities.  It got excruciatingly tedious and boring very quickly.  As I mentioned prior, my reaction wasn't, ""Oh my goodness gracious!""  Nope.  It was, ""Here we go again.""  :-PTHIRTEEN tries to be a wakeup call to America, saying, ""Open your eyes!  This is all real!""  and it aims to shock every chance it gets.  In fact, this movie is strikingly similar to Larry Clark's KIDS (1995).  They both aim to shock incessantly.  They both try to be painstaking wakeup calls to America.  The only difference is that Hardwicke is not a pedophilic pervert like Larry Clark.Oh, and did I mention that both films left me totally, completely unmoved?  I felt nothing.  I laughed once or twice.  That's about it.I'd recommend THIRTEEN to a Holly Hunter or Evan Rachel Wood fan.  Both leads showed true skill in the acting department.  Reed, on the other hand, was bland.  No wonder they refused to let her play Wood's role when she auditioned.  She can't act, simple as that.

792499,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00013RC2K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Thirteen (Catherine Hardwicke, 2003)So much hype around this movie, and how quickly we forget (or never knew in the first place. When star Evan Rachel Wood says in the DVD extras that no film has ever treated this subject quite like this before, I wondered how the director (the screenwriter, being only thirteen years of age, has an obvious excuse) can have managed to miss Harmony Korine's brilliant, devastating 1995 film Kids. And that certainly wasn't the only time I saw the specter of Kids hanging over this production.Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood, from Profiler) is starting her first day of seventh grade. She's your typical geek girl, maybe a little prettier than most. Upon reaching school, she finds herself overcome with jealousy when all the males notice a small group of girls dressed all in black and looking bad. She endeavors to get herself in by befriending one of them, Evie (scriptwriter Nikki Reed). Evie and the crowd introduce her to various bad behaviors, and Tracy goes from being a model student to rock bottom practically overnight.Despite Evan Rachel Wood's Best Actress-worthy performance, the movie is simply too easy. It falls into too many of the urban legend traps that one expects from a movie like this, but hopes won't show up. (That the screenwriter was herself thirteen both makes us want to cut her some slack and, if this is truly autobiographical, smack her upside the head for exaggerating in the most predictable ways possible.) The characters find themselves in utterly predictable situations and react in utterly predictable ways. This leads to such scenic contradictions as Holly Hunter and Deborah Unger's climactic confrontation over the behavior of their respective children, where Hunter can't seem to tell which way to turn to slap someone. Unger, it should be noted, is not nearly as much fun onscreen as she usually is; if you want to see this lady act, rent Crash. Here, she's nothing more than scenery. And Hunter? Well, she's never been the world's greatest actress. She's survived since The Firm playing herself over and over again (with the exception of her woefully-out-of-place casting in The Piano); here, she does exactly that once again. Nothing you haven't seen before, folks. On the good side are Wood and Jeremy Sisto (Caesar, May) as Hunter's on-again off-again boyfriend.The odd pairing of Hunter (born in 1958) and Sisto (born in 1974) serves to reinforce one of the movie's finest (and, perhaps, most ironic) moments: the attempted seduction of the next door neighbor by the two teens. Odd age disparities bounce around this movie like pinballs just after you've hit the multi-ball bonus. And they all seem okay except this one. Perhaps they're trying to send a message about the idiocy of the magic age law, especially as it concerns young female instigators?Not a bad little movie, but really not as good as all the hype made it out to be.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2 Catherine Hardwicke's harrowingly realistic film ""Thirteen"" paints an unflinching, unsparing and uncompromising portrait of an American teenager circa 2003.Evan Rachel Ward, who is 15 in real life, plays Tracy, a fairly ordinary thirteen-year-old girl whose life falls to pieces when she decides she wants to fit in with the ""cool"" kids at her middle school.  This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self-mutilation and all the other accoutrements associated with traditional teenage rebellion.  Tracy predictably comes from a broken home, although her mother, Mel, played by Holly Hunter, seems like a reasonably caring and open-minded individual, even though, in dress and demeanor, she seems like little more than a teenager herself.  It is this lack of a truly adult figure in her life that makes Tracy a perfect candidate for what happens to her.Hardwicke has provided a raw, close-to-the-bone assessment of teenage values in our modern culture.  The film doesn't pretend to speak for all teenagers, of course, but it does speak for a goodly number of them, zeroing in on the kinds of dysfunctional lives so many of them are forced to live through on their path to adulthood.  The director never shies away from showing us in graphic detail the realities of Tracy's life, making us see how the need for peer acceptance, an unstable family life and a permissive, valueless society all contribute to the problems children like Tracy face in coming to terms with who they really are.Wood provides a fully rounded, believable portrait of a young girl in search of her identity and Nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self-destruction.  Mel won't be winning any Mother of the Year contests any time soon, but she is a caring person who can't understand what is happening to the daughter she loves.  Holly Hunter hits all the right notes in the role, making the mother neither a hero nor a villain, just a recognizable human being.Hardwicke has chosen to employ a jittery, handheld camera technique which helps to underline the unfiltered reality of the piece.  In this, her first film as a director (she has previously been an art director and a production designer), Hardwicke proves herself a talent well worth watching.""Thirteen"" is a grim film on an important topic, one that cries out to be seen - though you may need to watch ""Spellbound"" as a much needed restorative and antidote immediately afterwards.",3,impressive slice-of-life realism,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,2520,"['***1/2', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'harrowingly', 'realistic', 'film', 'Thirteen', 'unflinching', 'unsparing', 'uncompromising', 'portrait', 'American', 'teenager', 'circa', '2003.Evan', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'who', '15', 'real', 'life', 'Tracy', 'fairly', 'ordinary', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'life', 'pieces', 'when', 'fit', 'cool', 'kids', 'middle', 'school', 'course', 'sex', 'drugs', 'body', 'piercing', 'shoplifting', 'self-mutilation', 'other', 'accoutrements', 'associated', 'traditional', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'Tracy', 'predictably', 'broken', 'home', 'mother', 'Mel', 'played', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'reasonably', 'caring', 'open-minded', 'individual', 'even', 'dress', 'demeanor', 'like', 'little', 'more', 'teenager', 'lack', 'truly', 'adult', 'figure', 'life', 'Tracy', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'what', 'her.Hardwicke', 'provided', 'raw', 'close-to-the-bone', 'assessment', 'teenage', 'values', 'modern', 'culture', 'film', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'speak', 'teenagers', 'course', 'speak', 'goodly', 'number', 'zeroing', 'kinds', 'dysfunctional', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'path', 'adulthood', 'director', 'never', 'away', 'showing', 'graphic', 'detail', 'realities', 'Tracy', 'life', 'making', 'see', 'how', 'need', 'peer', 'acceptance', 'unstable', 'family', 'life', 'permissive', 'valueless', 'society', 'contribute', 'problems', 'children', 'Tracy', 'face', 'coming', 'terms', 'who', 'really', 'are.Wood', 'fully', 'rounded', 'believable', 'portrait', 'young', 'girl', 'search', 'identity', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'superb', 'support', 'Evie', 'wild', 'wildly', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'Tracy', 'path', 'gradual', 'self-destruction', 'Mel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'winning', 'Mother', 'Year', 'time', 'soon', 'caring', 'person', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'right', 'notes', 'role', 'making', 'mother', 'hero', 'villain', 'just', 'recognizable', 'human', 'being.Hardwicke', 'chosen', 'employ', 'jittery', 'handheld', 'camera', 'technique', 'underline', 'unfiltered', 'reality', 'piece', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'previously', 'been', 'art', 'director', 'production', 'designer', 'Hardwicke', 'talent', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Thirteen', 'grim', 'film', 'important', 'topic', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'seen', 'may', 'need', 'watch', 'Spellbound', 'much', 'needed', 'restorative', 'antidote', 'immediately', 'afterwards']",Thirteen

This is one of the aspects that makes the story so difficult to endure. The situation is presented in a way that shocks the viewers and leaves one in fear of having to deal with a similar problem.The movie starts out showing Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Evie (Nikki Reed) getting high in the house of the former. The action immediately goes back to the time in which Tracy was starting out in high school as a completely normal kid. We see how peer pressure affects the way adolescents act and how detrimental it is for their development. Tracy, in her desire to become popular and hang out with the ""queen"" of the place, Evie, pressures her mother into spending money on clothes, moves to stealing and cannot stop the slippery slope from then on. She deserts her previous friends and gets involved in drugs and consequently sex.In the meantime, the movie presents a great depiction of how these facts affect the parents, and in this case specifically, the mother (Holly Hunter). Tracy's mom is a former drug addict, fighting to stay clean while trying to rebuild her relationship with her former boyfriend, Mason. The performances of the whole cast is superb, and this is one of the reasons why the movie is so disturbing.

Thirteen is a bold, gut-wrenching film about the crumbling American family and the current generation of overexposure, MTV, reality shows, and disillusionment. Tracy is astonishingly portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood who gives such an amazing performance it should take child-acting to new heights. Evie is portrayed by Nikki Reed (who also co-penned the script) is a vibrant screen newcomer. The Oscar nominated Holly Hunter ,as Mel, is brilliant as a bohemian, alcoholic single mom who watches her daughter Tracy descend into self-destruction right before her eyes. The director Catherine Hardwicke directs the film with relentless, edgy appeal giving the film it's power and drive.Although most critics give the film massive acclaim, some have shuddered at the shocking horror of the explicit nature of the teen lifestyles of Thirteen and many perhaps deny the possible accuracy of the film. ""Are kids really that bad?"" No, not all kids are drug-users dealers hypersexed or criminals but one must admit with a generation raised on MTV and Hollywood scandal , where many kids have to go to school in fear if their classmates may kill them, a generation where many believe oral sex isn't as intimate as kissing, or being a ""pimp"" or a ""thug"" is the true aspiration of life...the mood of the film is an unflinching cinematic opus to a generation sadly spiralling out of control.",5,SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT...SORT OF,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,1597,"['Tracy', 'sweet', 'yet', 'troubled', 'teen', 'who', 'alluring', 'bad', 'girl', 'Evie', 'life', 'drugs', 'sex', 'crime', 'not', 'dreadful', 'school', 'special', 'version', 'teen', 'issues', 'cute', 'tidy', 'resolutions', 'Thirteen', 'bold', 'gut-wrenching', 'film', 'crumbling', 'American', 'family', 'current', 'generation', 'overexposure', 'MTV', 'reality', 'shows', 'disillusionment', 'Tracy', 'astonishingly', 'portrayed', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'who', 'amazing', 'performance', 'should', 'take', 'child-acting', 'new', 'heights', 'Evie', 'portrayed', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'also', 'co-penned', 'script', 'vibrant', 'screen', 'newcomer', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Mel', 'brilliant', 'bohemian', 'alcoholic', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'daughter', 'Tracy', 'descend', 'self-destruction', 'right', 'eyes', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'film', 'relentless', 'edgy', 'appeal', 'giving', 'film', 'power', 'drive.Although', 'most', 'critics', 'give', 'film', 'massive', 'acclaim', 'have', 'shuddered', 'shocking', 'horror', 'explicit', 'nature', 'teen', 'lifestyles', 'Thirteen', 'many', 'perhaps', 'deny', 'possible', 'accuracy', 'film', 'Are', 'kids', 'really', 'bad', 'No', 'not', 'kids', 'are', 'drug-users', 'dealers', 'hypersexed', 'criminals', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'generation', 'raised', 'MTV', 'Hollywood', 'scandal', 'where', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'go', 'school', 'fear', 'classmates', 'may', 'kill', 'generation', 'where', 'many', 'believe', 'oral', 'sex', ""n't"", 'as', 'intimate', 'kissing', 'being', 'pimp', 'thug', 'true', 'aspiration', 'life', 'mood', 'film', 'unflinching', 'cinematic', 'opus', 'generation', 'sadly', 'spiralling', 'control']",Thirteen

Evie accepts Tracy and the two become friends, but Evie introduces Tracy to sex, drugs, and self-destructive behavior.

This is not to criticize the actor (who also co-wrote the flick with the director; never more has my parents dictim, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW BUT WHO YOU KNOW been proven more true than Ms. Nikki's odyssey) who shows chops many our so-called ""thespians"" haven't learned in decades working at their craft than this young ""natural"" brings to the screen.In Evie we are given little motivation, other than an airhead caretaker cousin, for her evil behavior.  And evil she is.  Cruel as well.  I'm sure for most of us junior high was a cruel experience.  The taunts, name calling, labelling and tremendous pressure to homogenize all brought me chills of memory.The one odd thing was the kids in the movie didn't seem to know how to walk down crowded hallways; it was the only useful skill I acquired in 13 years of public schools.  If they can't even convey that school, the education industry really has hit nadir.Back to Evie.  The ""reasons"" she gives are, in fact, lies or exaggerations.  But we aren't given any real reason that this young girl would suddenly begin dealing drugs, having sex, stealing and the other attendant ""risky behavior"" she seduces the all too willing Tracey.Evan Rachel Wood's character, on the other hand, is a fully fleshed out person.  We get to know and understand the alienation, rage and loneliness that tears this girl apart.In the end, the director and writers leave us as they left Tracey and Mel: shattered.No happy/Hollywood/Danielle Steel/Lifetime ending is tacked on.  As a great writer once wrote: books either tie up the loose ends or else they just stop.  This movie does the latter.  It just stops, leaving us almost as wrecked as Tracey and her Mom and wondering, just as they must have been, how the hell a society gets to the point where drug dealing and oral sex are ""normal"" behavior for 13 year old girls?As will all great works of art, the questions ""thirteen"" asks are far more important than any answers--inevitably pablum--that could have been presented.  Like life, this movie leaves us with the messy, squalid consequences of our actions.But I do not think this is, ultimately, a pessimistic movie.  Where there is love, there is hope.  It can't solve our problems, but without we have only the empty despair of Tracey's ultimate breakdown. And that may be all the answer we need.PS********************************There is one scene that I should mention that is totally inappropriate for children.  It concerns a wholly unecessary joke about oral sex.  It was in context, but still, in my opinion needless.  And, it's not even a good joke.  Still, how the writers could have ever imagined having a 13 year old character utter it is beyond me.I'm not a prude or a fan of censorship, but I would not let a child under sixteen or seventeen see this movie.  In sticking to the truth so rigorously, this movie good provide a sheen of glamor to some extremely stupid behavior.

This is the type of movie that parents would do well to screen with their preteen kids, daughters in particular.  It would go a long ways towards pre-empting some of the inevitable ""rebellious phase"".  Take it from me, I used to babysit my friend's teenage daughters.  We were very close, and I considered myself a second mother to them (even better, albeit only slightly, than their frequently absent biological mother - though I can't blame her entirely, what with the pressures of her day job).  It wasn't too far into their teen years, and ""high school careers,"" that I ended up not being ""cool"" or ""hip"" enough to be seen in public with them.  Plus they got old enough that their real mother didn't need to continue paying me a rather fair salary for sitting services (though in retrospect, she was a bit stingy with raises, a point of contention that has led to a degree of mutual bitterness between her and I).What I appreciated about ""Thirteen"" was how the 'good-girl' was gradually drawn in by her wilder friend - it happens very typically, and some of you who consider yourself ""good parents"" probably aren't even aware of it.  Look at Holly Hunter in this movie, who's own pride and joy slowly slips away from her without her even realizing.  Ms. Hunter must have some personal experience with questionable parenting becaus she uncannily nails her character with a performance that suggests an emotional wreck.

This film scared me, because stuff like this has happened in my family before, and trust me - this film presents everything in a very factual way. This is not teen exploitation. This is not some Larry Clark film. This is how it REALLY happens. All of what I have just stated comes from personal experience, so I should know. I didn't expect this film to really come close to what teen rebellion is really like. It can get bad...REALLY bad.Alot of the time, parents can be the ones responsible. Like the teens in this film, all they really want is help. Whenever they act the way they do, it is a cry for help and nothing more. All of that aside, the performances are excellent all around, especially Evan Rachel Woods and Holly Hunter. You forget that they are simply actresses playing their parts. THIS is acting. When you can BECOME the character and get everyone to forget that it is a performance, that's when you realize that you've got true acting ability, and these women do have it. Nikki Reed is very good, too. She plays her part very well, also. You become very tense while watching this film. You not only feel it for Rachel's character, but for Nikki's as well. You don't want to see these girls dig themselves deeper into the pit.Catherine Hardwicke is a great director, and this film proves it.

First off, I DO realize that this does occur, okay? I wasn't trying to say that it was wrong and this doesn't happen, I just meant to say that it's not as glamorous as it seems in this movie. If a thirteen year watches this without parental supervision, most likely, they will want to become this. And as I remember correctly, me and my friends never thought these girls were so popular and had lives to be envied....we thought they were sluts. And sluts they were. I mean, trying to seduce and sleep with the ugly neighbor guy? Oh PUH-LEASE. As said many times before, it's very hard to feel sympathy for Tracy because in the end she should have known that Evie was going to set her up, that all the signs were there. The thing that makes me hate...no despise this movie is the fact that the mother did NOTHING. If that were my daughter I would have knocked the living snot right out of her. So, my serious opinion?

But the fact that this film was co-written by a thirteen year old (the actress who plays Evie) gives &quot;Thirteen&quot; instant credibility.This is the story of a normal girl, Tracy (played magnificently by Evan Rachel Wood) who befriends the most popular girl in school, Evie. Instantly, Evie is a terrible influence, and the girls start going on shopping sprees funded by stolen money, get high on whatever they can find, drink often, and begin doing things with boys that thirteen year olds should not be doing. Tracy is a tortured soul, angry because her father does not care, because her mother cares too much and because her mom's boyfriend is bad news, according to Tracy. Holly Hunter is awesome as Mel, the mother, playing the character with a naivete thatcomes with a parent hoping their kid is alright. Another pivotal performance is by Tracy's brother, although I can't remember his name right now. His role is much smaller than the other three, but he combines a lack of caring with a big brother instinct that is very real.This movie could be considered an eye-opener for parents. It seems insane that thirteen year olds would be up to these kinds of things, but we now live in a world where people grow up entirely too quickly, and this movie shows us that in gritty detail. I enjoyed the direction of this film, and it is shaky and grainy in some parts, adding to the realism of the situation.Maybe we don't know the real reasons why Tracy is so upset with life, and why she choses to do what she does without remorse or any thought of the future, but the fact of the matter is that we don't always know these things, and often there is not even a reason. Simply put, she does do these things to herself, and it matters not what the reasoning is, just that they are done is enough.

That's the best way you can describe the way this movie was filmed.  Quick, jerky camera movements, the use of black and white, all help give the viewer this sense of confusion which really helps set the viewer to experience the chaotic life that the main character is going through.Some say this movie is unrealistic, personally living through that crap hole known as highschool, I can safely say that this movie is spot on when it comes to describing certain kids.  The movie is about fitting in, and the lengths some insecure individuals will go through to achieve this level of acceptance.  This film really relates to me, because I have a lot of female friends that went through, or are still going through similar experiences, in particular the self mutilation, and the need for acceptance.Yes, this movie is one hell of a rollercoaster of a ride, but don't expect it to let up so you can catch your breath.

792521,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B00013RC2K,Timothy Michael Resh,"[4, 7]","A gut-wrenching look at the pressures and temptations that face teenagers in the new millenium.  In a family fractured by divorce and drug use, Evan Rachel Woods' character is seduced by the oppressive power of peer pressure and need for acceptance.  In the space of 100 minutes, her character arc goes from sweet, needy pre-teen to promiscuous, pierced, drug abusing pal to Evie (Nikki Wood, who apparently co-wrote the drama based on her own experiences) to damaged, jaded teen.As the parent of a young daughter, it was a good cautionary tale to remind me how careful I will need to be when my daughter reaches that age.  I encourage other parents of pre-teens to also view this film and stay involved in the lives of your children.  It also reminds us that too much freedom is not always a good thing for pre-teens to have.  Rules are important, and parents should not be afraid to say &quot;no&quot; to their children when the children are engaged in the kinds of self-destructive behavior this film portrays.Powerfully, although somewhat unevenly acted at times, this film is definitely not a feel-good film.  The tragedy of the film is increased by its realistic depiction of dysfunctional relationships, and although the film is more of a character study than a story, it is definitely worth watching, especially for parents with pre-teens and teenagers.

792522,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00013RC2K,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","It is amazing.  I'm not talking about the film; I'm talking about the reaction to it.  Though 'Thirteen' collected only $4,600,000 on the US boxoffice chart, it got one Oscar nomination (for Holly Hunter) and two Golden Globe nominations (for Hunter and Wood) not to mention the more than 300 reviews sent here by visitors to amazon.  What does that mean?Whatever it is, one thing is clear -- many people related to the central character, Tracy, played by Evan Rachel Wood.  And this is exactly the point, for while some claim that the film  is so real, others find it otherwise.  In other words, if you don't like the film's subject matter and the heroine, or just refuse to believe in the story, you might find the film self-indulgent and even empty.Let's not talk about reality for now.  The film can be seen in two ways.  Part of it describes the two young girls Tracy and Evan (Nikki Reed, who contributed to the script), and how the friendship between Tracy and Evan ('The hottest girl in the school') developes to the shattering results.  Tracy wanted to be like gorgeous (so she thinks) Evan, but by so doing she experiences petty crimes, drugs, wrist cutting, and so on.  Interestingly, you would see no police or authority, which suggest the nature of the film -- it is not about the 'bad' behaviors of them; it's about the relations between the characters.Another principal character is involved, and that is Tracy's mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter).  It is suggested that she experienced divorce and booze in the past, and her new friend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) is coming out of some insitute, to live with Melanie and her children.  As Evan also moves in her house, the relations between the daughter and mother gets more turbulant.  And Melanie's ex-husband is away from them, unreliable when they need help.OK, good thing about the film is the acting, which is probably better than the underwritten script itself.  Though Holly Hunter is top-credited, Evan Rachel Wood is the real protagonist, and she almost single-handedly carries the whole film till the end.  Equally good is Nikki Reed and Jeremy Sisto, and you get supports from Kipp Pardue and Deborah Kara Unger.  Well, however, though I readily admit the good quality of the acting, including that of Hunter (who is very painful to watch), I was not impressed with the film itself, and the here is the reason.DIRECTOR CATHERINE HARDWICKE is formerly known as production designer (see her excellent works in 'Anti-Trust'), this is her first works as director.  She is also the co-writer of the script, which I find very unsatisfactory.  Many things are left unexplained, some of which are integral to the film -- but I can ignore them.  Still, I really hate it when the estranged father appears before his daughter, and when he tries to talk to her, his cellphone starts to ring, a call from his business partner or something, implying he is too busy to be with her.  I also really hate it when a divorced mother, while inviting her boyfriend to her house, is too self-occupied to notice the obvious changes in her daughter.  I'm not saying this is not real.  This is typical cliched moments found in many Hollywood movies, which have been repeated again and again.Then we come back to the point where we started -- Is this real?

The opening scene is a little strange - it's Tracey and her friend Evie sitting on Tracey's bed and they're repeadetly hitting/punching each other, because they're high and they can't feel anything. After that it goes back four months prior to the event, and Tracey's story starts to unfold.Tracey lives in a very unstable house: her mom's in AA, her dad's never there, and her brother smokes pot. She's intelligent, but she wants to fit in with a different group of friends. She wants to be friends with Evie, the it girl that everyone loves. Eventually she does get to hang out with her, and she starts falling into a downward spiral of drugs, sex, stealing, drinking, etc.The way this movie is filmed is brilliant - sometimes the movie is in full color, while other times it looks black and white, and sometimes there's color but its faded. It's filmed at a fast, camera-spinning pace, and it adds more reality to the film. There's a lot of swearing (many ""effs"" thrown around), there's also drug use, sexuality, and nudity. Needless to say, THIRTEEN isn't a kids movie.

Wilkinson,"[2, 3]","I entered junior high school, graduated from high school, began college and ""came of age"" in the 1990s, and the reason this movie struck so close to home for my sister and I is because we knew people in real life that mirrored the characters in the movie.  The bitchy sluts, the boys overdosed on testosterone, the slit-my-wrists-and-rub-the-blood-on-the-wall kids (boys and girls alike) and, most of all, the Parents That Didn't Give a Damn.The performances in this movie are first-rate and sometimes you might think you're watching a documentary.  But ... the problem is the characters in the movie don't seem to be ""characters"" as much as they seem to be points-of-view.  On the surface everything is golden, but there's not much below and no emotional center.  Just events occurring and people reacting.For example, Evan Rachel Wood likes to slit her wrists for whatever reason, but we never REALLY find out why.  We just ASSUME it's because her world is ""spinning out of control.""The ""spinning out of control"" part brings me to my next point.  I, like other reviewers, had trouble sympathizing with ANYONE in the movie.  Some view this movie as a lesson on how tough it is to be a teenager, and/or how tough it is to be a parent.  But after seeing it myself and looking back on my time in school in the 90s ... it's a lesson on how people are afraid of--and shy away from--life's responsibilities, adults and their children alike.Evan Rachel Wood's character had everything a spoiled thirteen-year-old could want, save that fancy pair of jeans, and Holly Hunter's character didn't wanna find a real job.
