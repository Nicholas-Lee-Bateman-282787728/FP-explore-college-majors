1348767,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B003L20IEC,A Customer,"[1, 1]","This film has a wonderful central evil and crazy scientist character called Dr. Heiter played by Dieter Laser. He has such a great face and voice. He is definitely the best thing in this film by Tom Six. Dr Heiter lost three dogs in an experimental operation...I think the correct discription would be 'mental' operation. An operation where all dogs were stitched together, mouth to anus. Dr Heiter believes he can carry out the same technique to humans.....  the phrase `All stations to Barking' come to mind.The filming, set design and feeling of isolation and helplessness is very powerful in this story. Where Tom Six has missed a trick is that he should have spent more time on individual character building at the beginning of the film, so you care or are able to have some empathy when the victims begin their journey to absolute hell.You may have seen the stunning 'Wolf Creek' which did an awesome job developing characters and their relationships and feelings for each other, all this took place during the first 45 minutes. 'Wolf Creek' achieved a master stroke in getting the audience involved with the three main players. I wish Tom Six did the same with this film. I can only guess with 'The Human Centipede' there were production time constraints or lack of funding, who knows. Watching this film felt a bit like when your late to get to the cinema, you've missed the first half hour,and you sit in your seat just when the nasty madness kicks in.Apparently the idea for this surgical venture stemmed from a conversation about what punishment would be suitable for all convicted paedophiles. The other great bit of PR they pushed is that the actual operation connecting human beings, mouth to anus, is 100% medically accurate. Most sensible people would laugh at this, but after seeing this film I was totally convinced... Does that mean I'm a little naive?I guess this film is a love it or hate it experience. I totally get what Tom Six was aiming for with this film, it's brave and original. To be honest it was not as naff or as graphic as I expected, or may be it was and because I see so much of this horror stuff I've become immune...I dunno. Coincidentally, I have contacted Tom Six because I want to work with him, but I aint gonna spend weeks on all fours as a victim in 'The Human Centipede 3'.

1348772,A4KNOE8YJJUMR,B003L20IEC,Alec McMullen,"[1, 4]","With the creation of a ""new animal"" using three humans unwillingly attached together, complete with sickening blood and gore shown in close-up images, horrifying screams of terror, and a maniacal scientist who will stop at nothing to make his experiment successful, the Human Centipede is truly a modern day B-movie. It resembles the cheap, campy monster flicks of the fifties; the ones that usually featured awful acting and effects and low budgets. But these films were still were enjoyable for what they were. After all, it's hard to hate a movie about a giant blob ready to swallow an entire town, or giant mutated insects arriving on earth to cause chaos. The same goes for the Human Centipede.I originally thought I was going to despise this film before viewing it, considering the terrible track record horror films have had of late. When horror is in this bad of a state, what chance does a movie about a mad scientist making three humans into a giant centipede have? On the contrary, the movie is fairly well made and features more surprises and scares than you would expect. It also features characters that are 100% racially/sexually stereotyped and repulsion to the extreme (Given, the target audience won't mind either).It starts with the mad doctor, played by Dieter Laser (who attempts a modern day Nazi-like menace with all his will), taking out his first victim for the experiment with a tranquilizer. Then we meet the two teenage girls in the film, Ashley and Lindsey, at a hotel about to visit a friend. They get in their car and set off to their destination. On the way their car breaks down on a road next to the woods and they spend a while searching for a ride until they decide to look for a house to get help at in the woods. Big mistake.The plot of the film, a mad doctor making a new ""animal"" out of three people, has a scientific background to it. By cutting off the three victims kneecaps and making them stick at a 90 degree angle, and then cutting their anuses and attaching the other victims' mouths to an anus so waste can come out of the anuses and into the mouths until it leaves the third human, the three are joined together as a centipede. For some the thought that someone had to think of this is bad enough. And for all means and purposes, the Human Centipede may very well be the sickest movie ever made.But here it's not the amount of pain and torture in question here, it's the imagination that went into it. Director Tom Six has put a horrible but unique concept into a Hollywood film, much more interesting than just seeing razors or knives going into someone's skin.

Film and lighting techniques are professional looking, there are no jump cuts, the special effects look realistic (including hair and makeup) and the the actors are really top notch (especially Dieter Laser who plays the mad German doctor). This film could have easily become really campy but it never tips into that area and stays in the realm of the macabre.For those that don't know about this movie it's about a German doctor who was a well known in his field for successfully separating Siamese (conjoined) twins, but somewhere along the lines Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) goes insane and wants to create a conjoined human aka the ""human centipede."" He does so successfully with dogs, but then turns his crazed obsession to finding the right human guinea pigs and he does so with three victims (Ashley C. Williams, Ashlyn Yennie, Akihiro Kitamura) who turn out to be the perfect biological match.Anyway, the film is pretty perverse and kind of gruesome, but you don't really see explicit stuff (i.e. when the three people are attached you'll see the scar and stitches but everything else is obscured by bandages) so it's more psychological because your mind is filling in the blanks.I did find some points in the movie that stretched the suspension of disbelief, not so much with the actual human centipede, but why a character would do this or that. Otherwise the film is pretty good. The BLU-RAY picture quality is sharp and vivid with bright colors and black, blacks.THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE isn't for everyone. But for an indie movie that cost 1,500,000-Euros (according to IMDb) to make and a somewhat gross thriller that has introduced something unique to the horror genre it isn't so bad.

Well, I think that surgeon was just messing with people, because I have no idea how this movie could be medically accurate. Maybe the surgeon was thinking of short-term feasibility. Like, if you attached three people thusly they could survive for a couple days sort of realism, because I'm not sure how the back two people wouldn't die from eating only feces. It's not like their digestive systems had been changed completely to somehow optimize them for the digestion of feces only.Even taking into account the inefficiency of the human digestive system and the fact that human feces probably does have some nutrients in it that the body wasn't able to absorb, I doubt there would be enough left over nutrients to sustain another human being. Much less two other human beings! The person in position C is not only eating a diet comprised exclusively of feces, but one comprised exclusively of feces of feces!Bottom line, if B and C didn't die of feces-borne infection and disease, they would starve, especially considering that their mouths are giant open wounds. Giant open wounds that are being filled with human excrement. Clean!Speaking of clean! Who would even want a human centipede as a pet? The movie doesn't explain exactly what the centipede does with its urine, but he never said anything about it being pumped into the next person in line, so I guess anytime one of them has to pee they just urinate all over their legs and floor. These people would stink! And they would totally trash the house urinating everywhere.The movie is actually not as graphic as you would think. I thought this was going to be the sickest movie possible, but as far as gore goes it's actually less traumatic than Saw or Hostel or even Seven from years ago.

Two vacationers in Europe are looking for a night club and they get lost. They stop for help at a surgeons house. This surgeon has gained eminence for separating Siamese twins but now wishes to create a Siamese sequence by joining human beings together. He had tried this in the past with his Rottweiler's successfully and now wants to experiment with humans. This human centipede would have a shared gastrointestinal system. The surgery that takes place is not gory but the presentation put together by the Doctor for his unwilling victims was creepy and stomach churning for me. There is not a lot of blood as compared to other horror movies but there are some very sick and disgusting moments. The director was also trying to make a political statement by portraying the doctor as German in reference to the Nazi invasion of Netherlands and the bizarre experiments that they conducted on human beings. On the whole, this was a novel but disgusting idea in horror filmmaking but while the first half was great the second half was just so-so. The actors had little to do except crawl around and scream. However they must be brave to attempt such an experiment. The doctor Heiter (Dieter Laser ) was hideous and evil and could have a shot at cult like status. Three stars. 11/29/10P.S.

1348782,A29W1GTUQ6LOI3,B003L20IEC,A. Nonnymaus,"[2, 2]","It would be easy to dismiss The Human Centipede as unworthy of much note.  But it's too well done on some levels.  The cinematography, sound, overall production values and acting by Dieter Laser as the mad doctor are quite good.  If Tom Six and team intended to pursue the familiar route toward mainstream movies by proving their value through a low budget horror flick, they've succeeded.But beneath that slick veneer is a dry husk of a turd.  Unless you're particularly sensitive, new to gore flicks or just not a fan of the genre, sure, you might find this movie disturbing.  But for fans of the genre it's not particularly impressive.  The gore is minimal, mostly suggested through the obviously grotesque notion of making conjoined triplets through the worst imaginable connection of orifices.  There's lots of moaning and crying.  But you never actually see what is suggested by the premise.  That would have required a special effects budget, which this movie clearly didn't have.  Instead, you get diaper service.It's not gory enough to secure a niche in that disreputable genre.  It lacks notable special effects.  It lacks the knowing sense of dark humor that made movies like ""Re-Animator"" and ""Saw"" classics.  And it lacks the out of control sense of insanity that made the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" so disturbing even after several viewings.Oddly enough, there are tiny gems inside that turd.  The head of the human centipede - apparently suddenly possessed by the spirit of Dae-su Oh from ""Oldboy"" - experiences an eloquent moment of existential crisis, albeit in Japanese which none of the other characters can understand.  This brief moment of nihilistic irony is almost enough to redeem the rest of the movie.  And the two female segments of the centipede mime a persuasive sense of emotional bonding, beyond the physical, although the director neglects to develop it, or perhaps chooses to minimize it, so that the viewer never quite feels much more than a bit of detached pity.But it's still only a couple of tiny gems wrapped in a giant turd covered in glittery wrapping.

1348787,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B003L20IEC,Ben Rowland,"[0, 4]","There are two kinds of horror movies nowadays; gorefest flicks that go right for the throat and give you a healthy dose of blood and guts, and more psychological horror films that leave a lasting impression and prove that what is implied is sometimes more shocking than what is shown. ""The Human Centipede"" falls somewhere in the middle, delivering some enough viscera to appease the splatter fans while providing a truly horrifying premise to really make you squirm in your seat. It's not a great film by any stretch, but it offers a level of originality that is not often seen in horror films today. Part horror, part twisted fetish movie, this is unlikely to be a movie you'll forget anytime soon.The center of the movie is Dr. Heiter,a reclusive former doctor who was once a respected surgeon who specialized in the separation of Siamese twins but now devotes his time to his obsession - combining animal to make one cohesive body. As luck would have it, two American tourists happen upon his house one rainy night and he decides to keep them for his experiment. Add in a Japanese tourist he kidnaps and he's ready to unveil his masterplan: to create a human centipede. How he achieves this is really the most horrifying aspect of the movie; he plans for them to all share one digestive tract, with the person in the front eating, passing waste through the middle person and finally out the end of the back person. This requires two of the people to be surgically grafted, rectum to mouth, and their knee ligaments are severed so that the cannot stand up. The bulk of the movie is the surgical procedure, with the rest being devoted to the mad doctor ""training"" his human centipede and their hopes to escape.As horror movies go, this is one of the more interesting ones that works on some levels and doesn't on others. The production is above average for it's type, especially considering that oddities like this are typically low-budget European or Asian exploitation or Arthouse films, so it obviously has a bigger budget than most. The acting by the three ""pieces"" of the centipede is patchy at best, especially the Japanese male who has been given some incredibly bad dialogue and who spends the bulk of the movie screaming and shouting nonsensical banter. The best performance of the movie comes from German stage actor Dieter Laser, who plays an effectively creepy villain akin to a more unhinged Hannibal Lecter. He is an imposing presence and his facial expressions and manner of speaking really add to the level of discomfort the movie gives off. While the graphic violence is enough to make you cringe at times, the real horror comes from the scenario that the three victims find themselves in. The mad doctor explains to them, in detail, what he is going to do, and then he does it. Trying to imagine yourself in such an ordeal is really where this film hits the mark, and it will definitely leave an impression on you long after you've seen the film.For all it's strengths and faults, I enjoyed ""The Human Centipede"" and I can see it becoming a cult classic 10 years from now.

Director Tom Six came up with the concept of this sick story from a joke made with friends.  This joke was aimed at child molesters, suggesting as punishment they should have their mouths surgically sewn ""to the (rear end) of fat truck drivers"".  When Mr. Six pitched this idea to potential investors, he omitted this central aspect of the plot.  The rest is underground horror history.The Human Centipede starts off irritatingly derivative.  A couple of beautiful ladies from New York are touring through Europe.  Sheesh, didn't you two gals watch HOSTEL or TAKEN?  This is obviously a bad idea.  They get invited to a party, have a tire blowout in the middle of bfe, and of course have no cell phone reception.  I know, that setup has been beaten to death.  But new levels of inconceivable evil are about to be woven in.For me, the most unnerving part of this film was the main scoundrel himself, the wicked Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser).  He just looks superbly creepy as all hell.  Plus his detatched, cold persona will send shivers down your spine.This acclaimed doctor had received recognition from his brilliant skill in seperating conjoined twins.  Now his next effed up surgical plan is quite the opposite.  He dreams of making new creatures that share a single digestive system.  Sick!  The portions of one meal go through three different people.  I can't think of a more humiliating, degrading, just flat out awful predicament.This film does surprisingly show some restraint in unleashing this atrocity upon the viewer.  It contains relatively little blood or nudity.  We're left to witness the extreme awkwardness of the victims as they cope with the hopelessness of their situation.  Plus we are subjected to the whims of a deranged madman, as he does the unthinkable.Overall, this is a film I would mildly recommend to fans of hardcore horror only.  It is well made and acted for the most part.  It's definitely not something you see everyday, thank goodness.

Dr. Heiter, a renown surgeon, known for his ability to separate conjoined twins, has no true understanding of humanity and the bonds that bring us together. He dreams of having such knowledge, but in his twisted mind, such bonds come from forced interaction, a forced need to cooperate. Thus, he creates the human centipede, attaching three young victims, head to tail, so that they crawl about on their knees, unable to do anything without cooperating.And they do, but not in the way Dr. Heiter expected. They learn to fight back, to escape, like Frankenstein's monster taking revenge on the real monster, the one who created him. But they do this because they are human, not because they are learning to be human. They feel each other's fear and pain, they hold one another up, they forgive one another what they cannot control.Yet, did Six have to make his points (and there are many in this deeply layered film) in such a degrading way, making us feel like depraved voyeurs to want to see these three people survive and wreak havoc? There are times when he seems to be indicting the audience as much as Dr. Heiter. I'm still not sure if this film is gratuitous, or highly effective or both.

Some movies are made with the intention of sending a message, while others are made purely for entertainment; the more I try to figure out which category this movie falls into, the more confused I get, for it doesn't seem to belong to either one. What message could it possibly be sending? That suffering is even more unpleasant than death? Thanks, but I already got that from ""Downloading Nancy."" In what way is it entertaining? Because the filmmakers have found an entirely new way to shock and disgust the audience? Just because I've never seen anything like it before doesn't mean I'm going to enjoy looking at it. It also doesn't mean that it should ever have been shown in the first place.This movie fails on a level even more basic than those of setting, character, pacing, and visual appeal - that of the underlying concept, which is so spectacularly bad that nothing the actors did or said could have saved it. It's not something I wish to describe. I will say that the director consulted a surgeon to ensure that the concept was ""100% medically accurate,"" a measure that proves just how out of touch he is with today's horror community. Absolutely no one will care how medically accurate it is. All that matters is, is it scary? Yes, but not in the way you're thinking; it scared me to think that this could be the next frontier in horror filmmaking, that audiences may someday only delight in content so sickening that it transcends campy fun and becomes an endurance test.It opens with two characters who are not characters at all, but merely expendable female victims with no discernable personalities and no sense of depth. Their names are Lindsay and Jenny (Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie), American tourists vacationing in Germany. In a cinematic twist of fate that even thirty years ago wasn't original, they get lost in the woods on the way to a nightclub and subsequently get a flat tire. Naturally, there's no cell phone service in the middle of nowhere, so they're forced to wander through the woods until they find someone who can help. Lo and behold, there's a house off in the distance. They knock on the door just as it starts to pour rain. The door opens, revealing the wizened Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser), whose creepy, piercing stare and low, harsh voice should have been enough of an indication for the girls run away.Lindsay and Jenny are invited in. Heiter, who just happens to speak fluent English, offers them each a glass of water, which they accept. They drink up, unaware of the fact that their waters have been spiked with the date rape drug. Are they really so clueless that they forgot the cardinal rule of not accepting a drink from a stranger? Of course they are - they're bound by an unfortunate convention of horror movies, namely that female characters automatically must be nave and helpless. When they awaken, they find themselves strapped to stretchers in Heiter's basement/laboratory/operating room. In due time, they're joined by a kidnapped Japanese tourist (Akihiro Kitamura), who throughout the film does little more than scream obscenities in his native language.What does Heiter want these three for? Does the film's title not tell you everything you need to know? The surgical procedure required to make this possible is described in excruciating detail, although I'm not sure why since I don't think anyone would be interested in the process so much as the results. And what of the results? Let's just say they give a new meaning to the word ""excessive,"" not only in terms of physical appearance, but also in terms of how Heiter forces them to behave once the procedure is done. This isn't horror so much as an exercise in depravity. By the time it was all over, I felt empty inside, not only because of an ending in which absolutely no one wins, but also because I had been denied of anything that could be considered entertaining.This movie has to be seen to be believed, which is not something I recommend you try. The more I think about ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence),"" the more amazing it seems that it was made, and before that written, and before that conceived of. It's not bad in any usual way; it achieves an entirely new level of badness, one so unpleasant and extreme that it might actually be worth seeing, not because it's any good, but simply because you may never see anything like it again. I take that back - writer/director Tom Six is already at work on ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),"" which he promises will ""go full force in graphic details, making part I look like my little pony.""

Two teenage girls staying in a nice Hotel in a nice area of Germany decide to spend an evening out at the Bunker nightclub. On the way they get lost and break down and are accosted by a throwout from the local bier keller who pulls up in his Beetle. The girls would rather stick pins through their eyes or wear flat shoes than let Herr Lowenbrau change one of their hire car tyres, so he gets the message quite quickly and drives off. The girls try to phone the hire company but can't get a service, so they decide to walk across woodland to where they think there might be houses. However the terrain is far too rough for their high heels and, as they don't fancy doing a Camille Keaton at this stage, they whinge back towards the highway where Herr Lowenbrau's pram lights can clearly be seen. Herr Doktor proceeds to point out that he doesn't really like humans but that he is very partial to centipedes. He addresses one as 'my sweet centipede' and also trains a centipede to fetch things. A very clever Medic indeed, and one with an increasingly high opinion of himself,as can be gleaned by his state of the art indoor swimming pool. The girls have tremendous bodies and acting talent but, because of what happens in the storytelling of this film, it can never have the exotic/erotic impact of a really good Giallo. Human Centipede will appeal to anyone who likes good horror, and also probably to those who haven't really tried horror before, since it would be an excellent starting point. It is certainly not ugly nor dirty, and the violence is just what you would expect from a rippingly good horror film. As a guide I would say that the violence is less extreme than the 4 French-directed films Hills Have Eyes, Martyrs, Inside and High Tension. IFC have made a superb unrated Director's cut Bluray print. 16/9.

So they get nocked out cold.They wake up and realize this weirdo has held them hostage.He explains later on in this film how he wants too make a human centipede  freeky right.What I thought this  movie would be is some human centipede creature terrorizing people in like caves and such. Boy was I wrong this movie is just dumb. The blood and guts was the only good thing this film had to it The sets looked like utter trash.This movie looked like it was made on a $50'000.00 budget not good im all for low budget films if you can make it look good like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre did but this movie is no Filet Mignon on the movie scale its more like a $1.00 Cheesburger from Mcdonalds not good after I saw this film im like I am never going too watch this stupid movie again  I recommend this movie too people who dont care about plot or the acting just want too be freaked out that and see some gore this movie is without a doubt worth only 1 star too me. If I was able too give this movie half a star I would trust me its that bad. Only watch this movie if you want too make fun of it. I really miss the days when horror movies were mostly well put together films these days you have too sort through so many movies too get too the good ones. Well thats it for this review of this trashy film. I did have a few laughs with my buddies after seeing it though so thats priceless but I will never get back the time I spent watching it unfortunately.,1,This Movie belongs in the Trash awful awful awful,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2217,"['first', 'thought', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'Target', 'what', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Then', 'looked', 'back', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Stated', 'most', 'sick', 'twisted', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'instead', 'would', 'be', 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'utter', 'Garbage', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'help', 'sell', 'many', 'copies', 'now', 'plot', 'gos', 'down', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'back', 'woods', 'way', 'who', 'where', 'havent', 'seen', 'while', 'so', 'dont', 'remember', 'details', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'film', 'bad', 'bad', 'funny', 'was', 'directer', 'thinking', 'way.So', 'yes', 'human', 'Centipede', 'sick', 'guy', 'lores', 'thse', 'two', 'woman', 'dude', 'too', 'house', 'stumble', 'there', 'put', 'nock', 'out', 'drink', 'girls', 'water', 'get', 'nocked', 'out', 'cold.They', 'wake', 'up', 'realize', 'weirdo', 'held', 'hostage.He', 'explains', 'later', 'film', 'how', 'too', 'make', 'human', 'centipede', 'freeky', 'right.What', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'human', 'centipede', 'creature', 'terrorizing', 'people', 'like', 'caves', 'such', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'just', 'dumb', 'blood', 'guts', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'had', 'sets', 'looked', 'utter', 'trash.This', 'movie', 'looked', 'was', 'made', ""50'000.00"", 'budget', 'not', 'good', 'im', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'did', 'movie', 'Filet', 'Mignon', 'movie', 'scale', 'more', '1.00', 'Cheesburger', 'Mcdonalds', 'not', 'good', 'saw', 'film', 'im', 'am', 'never', 'going', 'too', 'watch', 'stupid', 'movie', 'again', 'recommend', 'movie', 'too', 'people', 'who', 'dont', 'care', 'plot', 'acting', 'just', 'want', 'too', 'be', 'freaked', 'out', 'see', 'gore', 'movie', 'doubt', 'only', '1', 'star', 'too', 'was', 'able', 'too', 'give', 'movie', 'star', 'would', 'trust', 'bad', 'Only', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'too', 'make', 'fun', 'really', 'miss', 'days', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'mostly', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'films', 'days', 'have', 'too', 'sort', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'too', 'get', 'too', 'good', 'ones', 'Well', 'review', 'trashy', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'laughs', 'buddies', 'seeing', 'so', 'thats', 'priceless', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'unfortunately']",N/A

Part of the credit for the film's success goes to Dieter Laser, for playing his sadistic surgeon character as understatedly deranged, which makes him much scarier than if the actor had gone for scenary-chewing histrionics. His character is less motivated by delusions of grandeur than he is just a sadistic overgrown child acting out a bizarre experiment: turning our two heroines, along with another kidnapped Asian tourist, into the titular human centipede.Is the film critiquing modern society's obsession with body modification? Or the scientific community's morals in regards to experimentation? Or recent horror cinema's ""torture porn"" trend? Possibly.

Its not my typical Horror/fantasy movie and i already said before that those type of movies were not the ""bests  in horror"" as they were lacking too much elements..we are very far from the quality and standards of Italian horror and i still stand by this comment......But, people will have to start realising that this is a very unique concept even though i agree is kinda disgusting but it took lots of courage for director Tom Six to come up with this...Now, if we put the noise and the whole concept aside, i'll have to say that mr Tom Six did a good job, the acting is good....very good...i mean im sure it wasn't easy to play those characters but i think they did a good job, especially Dieter laser ( that crazy doctor...).. he played the role very well!!.. i don't see myself going out for a coffee or a beer with him...that would probably freak me out completely! The cinematography is just perfect ..especially the dark scenes like at the beginning when they are lost in the woods....nice and effective use of colors and light....If we go back in 1973, when ""The Exorcist"" came out in theatres, there was a similar reaction to it, just like the human centipede the movie was immediately banned in several countries and lots of people were pissed and lots of people got traumatised by it but look what it became today....a real  horror classic!!! its actually funny to read some of the reviews here by angry and disgusted people who says this is the worst movie ever and bla bla bla..... if you notice they've all watched the whole thing when they could've just stop the movie when they realise it wasnt for them...but no...they watched it all...the whole thing...they probably had to as they were fascinated as well as disgusted...thats the truth.....Horror should be meant to shock, disturb and disgust people, just like the exorcist did.

It is not only due to the fact that 80% of the population would scratch their head and ask ""what?"" or ""who?"" I get that alot with most of the things I do.It has more to do with the fear that these people may actually know these movies and directors, and find them to be, for lack of a better word, ""gross"" rather than the adjectives I use, such as ""raw"", ""inspiring"", ""provocative"", ""so disturbing that you can't look away"". Usually, at least two of those adjectives have to be used by me to describe a movie that I like.Some of these movies and directors that have found their way into my heart, or at least, psyche:Meet the FeeblesLeaving Las VegasIrreversibleTakashi MiikeLloyd KaufmanJohn WatersWhen I heard the bar-top reviews of The Human Centipede, the words ""gross"", ""disgusting"", ""wow, was that vile"" came into the explanation time and again, so it seemed that the movie may find itself into the list above. Unfortunately, it fell short.Written and directed by flying Dutchman Tom Six, the plot revolves around a German doctor that had once specialized in separating conjoined twins. After possibly injesting too much acid, the doctor decided to start conjoining people anus-to-mouth to create a human centipede. Two female American tourists and one Japanese guy become the candidates for his experiment. A few people die. And the human centipede? It becomes reality.The acting is fairly well done after the women stop getting lost in the woods. The japanese guy seems to have been taken straight out of a Takashi Miike movie himself. The mad Dr. Heiter probably suffers from OCD and portrays a medical fiend that hates people, as he stated, quite well. There isn't a whole lot of action: one normal chase scene through the house, one gimpy chase scene in the house, a little gunfire, death by injection, death by self-inflicted throat slashing, and a little blood poisoning. Be warned: when people call this movie gross, it is not because it is a gore-soaked horror movie. No, the gross-out has to do with the construction of the human centipede: ass-to-mouth. What do you think will happen when someone on the front end has to do #2?Exactly.However, this is not what makes the movie a little unwatchable until the final 10 minutes. Like so many good directors listed at the beginning of this review, the substance of a movie is both visual and symbolic. The Human Centipede does have its moments of realization for the characters. The Japanese guy has an amazingly subtitled monologue on humanity. When police officers find the human centipede, their disgust shows just how much the 3 characters lost their identity, and humanity, by being merged together. You can only imagine what they would try to charge Dr. Heiter with.The problem is, these deep theme devices don't evolve until the last 10 minutes. Locking the human centipede in a cage, teaching it to play fetch, these were failed attempts because they just seemed comical, because it was obvious what the director was trying to do. The detective's reaction to seeing the human centipede, however, was amazing. The best 10 seconds of the movie. Unfortunately, that's way to short to give this movie a pass in the grading department.Apparently, Tom Six is working on a sequel, The Human Centipede(Final Sequence). Should be interesting to see if he goes high-brow, or even more vulgar.I give this movie 2.5 out of 5 pieces of the human centipede.",2,"Tongue in Cheek, or as the Characters Learn...",1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,3505,"['are', 'few', 'movies', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'lay', 'fandom', 'everyday', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'due', 'fact', '80', '%', 'population', 'would', 'scratch', 'head', 'ask', 'what', 'who', 'get', 'alot', 'most', 'things', 'do.It', 'more', 'do', 'fear', 'people', 'may', 'actually', 'know', 'movies', 'directors', 'find', 'be', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'gross', 'rather', 'adjectives', 'use', 'such', 'raw', 'inspiring', 'provocative', 'so', 'disturbing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'Usually', 'least', 'two', 'adjectives', 'have', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'movie', 'like.Some', 'movies', 'directors', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'heart', 'least', 'psyche', 'Meet', 'FeeblesLeaving', 'Las', 'VegasIrreversibleTakashi', 'MiikeLloyd', 'KaufmanJohn', 'WatersWhen', 'heard', 'bar-top', 'reviews', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'words', 'gross', 'disgusting', 'wow', 'was', 'vile', 'came', 'explanation', 'time', 'again', 'seemed', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'list', 'Unfortunately', 'fell', 'short.Written', 'directed', 'flying', 'Dutchman', 'Tom', 'Six', 'plot', 'around', 'German', 'doctor', 'had', 'once', 'specialized', 'separating', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'possibly', 'injesting', 'too', 'much', 'acid', 'doctor', 'decided', 'start', 'conjoining', 'people', 'anus-to-mouth', 'create', 'human', 'centipede', 'Two', 'female', 'American', 'tourists', 'one', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'become', 'candidates', 'experiment', 'few', 'people', 'die', 'human', 'centipede', 'reality.The', 'acting', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'women', 'stop', 'getting', 'lost', 'woods', 'japanese', 'guy', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'straight', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'movie', 'mad', 'Dr.', 'Heiter', 'probably', 'suffers', 'OCD', 'medical', 'fiend', 'people', 'stated', 'quite', 'well', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'action', 'one', 'normal', 'chase', 'scene', 'house', 'one', 'gimpy', 'chase', 'scene', 'house', 'little', 'gunfire', 'death', 'injection', 'death', 'self-inflicted', 'throat', 'slashing', 'little', 'blood', 'poisoning', 'warned', 'when', 'people', 'call', 'movie', 'gross', 'not', 'gore-soaked', 'horror', 'movie', 'No', 'gross-out', 'do', 'construction', 'human', 'centipede', 'ass-to-mouth', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'someone', 'front', 'end', 'do', '2', 'Exactly.However', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'little', 'unwatchable', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'directors', 'listed', 'beginning', 'review', 'substance', 'movie', 'visual', 'symbolic', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'have', 'moments', 'realization', 'characters', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'amazingly', 'subtitled', 'monologue', 'humanity', 'When', 'police', 'officers', 'find', 'human', 'centipede', 'disgust', 'shows', 'just', 'how', 'much', '3', 'characters', 'lost', 'identity', 'humanity', 'being', 'merged', 'together', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'try', 'charge', 'Dr.', 'Heiter', 'with.The', 'problem', 'deep', 'theme', 'devices', 'do', ""n't"", 'evolve', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'Locking', 'human', 'centipede', 'cage', 'teaching', 'play', 'fetch', 'were', 'failed', 'attempts', 'just', 'seemed', 'comical', 'was', 'obvious', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'detective', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'human', 'centipede', 'however', 'was', 'amazing', 'best', '10', 'seconds', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'short', 'give', 'movie', 'pass', 'grading', 'department.Apparently', 'Tom', 'Six', 'working', 'sequel', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'Final', 'Sequence', 'Should', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'high-brow', 'even', 'more', 'vulgar.I', 'give', 'movie', '2.5', '5', 'pieces', 'human', 'centipede']",N/A

Ball ""JBALL""","[13, 20]","Director Tom Six claims that he wants to push the limits and make films which are new and different, but what has he really accomplished with HUMAN CENTIPEDE?  Forget the nasty title monstrosity, and what do you have?  Just one more trite, not-very-varied variation of the mad scientist theme which was already overworked by the 1940s.  His film differs from those only in the lack of a happy ending - and even that difference is a predictable cliche of modern film-making.  I suspect that Six fancies himself an artist, but where is the artistry here?  Where are the plot twists? the innovative camera work? the pointed message?  Even the title creature is not very original.  Pulp magazines of the 30s and 40s are full of mad-scientist creations dimly described as unspeakable, disgusting, and obscene: those adjectives allow for such creatures as the human centipede.  Six is merely explicit and nasty.  HUMAN CENTIPEDE is a cruel, apparently woman-and-Oriental-hating piece of sensational garbage aimed at a stupidly sadistic, unimaginative, and  depraved audience - the modern version of the spectators at the Roman gladitorial games. 100% medically accurate?  Of course - but only if one allows that such a creation would die in a very few days of bacterial infection and/or starvation for numbers two and three. Nevertheless, the film bristles with inaccuracies, such as serious wounds that don't bleed much and loud screams from people who should be able to produce only muffled, choking noises. And the announced sequel?  The same thing, only bigger and nastier.  So what is Six's contribution to the genre.  Just this - ""mouth-to-anus.""  Six depicts numbers two and three swallowing crap - and he expects his audience to do the same.  Shocking?  Not really - just ugly.  And not even original since Six claims SALO as one of his favorite movies. (That is almost all one needs to know about Six.) In fact, to our desensitized audience, the most shocking scene is that one early in the film where the girls' cellphone fails in time of need- OMG! OMG!

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","For those who know me I seen my share of films and I have seen a lot them, but never before have I seen a film completely missing a script. Even though I've seen this film over a year ago, this film wasn't so bad if you know what kind of film it is. I don't know to me it seems like director Tom Six came up with the idea and then told the actors to make it up as they went for the most part. The reason why I say this is because most of the dialog is made up by ""stop"" and ""please - first in English, then in Japanese - and I'm not sure switching languages is enough of a variation to qualify for a script. The Human Centipede has less of a plot than a music video.&#8232;&#8232;The acting is a mixed bowl of good, decent and bad, but as this is a horror flick, great acting is not something you'd expect anyway. To be honest, I wasn't caught up in the whole gore/sickness of the subject matter but by Dieter's conviction in his role. It's the spookiest thing about this film. The man went for it and he did it well. Andreus Leopuld and Peter Blankenstein both perform their parts well as the 'on the case' detectives. Now as for Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie they were both given totally unrealistic lines, but no one watches these movies to see great acting. The pet was just that. I became less concerned about the creation and more about the Doctor's safety and whether he'd get away with it.The locations are actually pretty great and the special effects are pretty good. Lots of well thought out camera angles and lighting; careful use of prosthetics.

Without going into an in depth interpretation of this movie, I found it to be Black Comedy and totally ""Over the Top"". Dieter Laser as Dr. Heidel is perfect for the role.  C'mon, you cannot take this movie seriously.  When Dr. Heidel introduces himself to his subjects, he states ""I am Dr. Joseph (winks at the girls) Heidel"" which is obviously dark humor and then he goes on to explain how he will join individuals A, B, & C together to form his 2nd creation--his 1st being 3 Rottweiler pets of his which didn't make it as a doggy centipede.  His seriousness is truly farcical as the Director meant it to be.  Nobody can truly take this in earnest.I have been watching Horror Movies all of my life and believe ""Human Centipede"" will become a cult classic.  You have to view this movie as comedy (granted some parts are gross) or what did you expect in the first place considering the Title?  My good friend and I get a kick out of Dr. Heidel's insanity and consider this film having ""break through"" written all over it.  When I first saw Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", I was totally disgusted at what the movie showed in graphic detail--this is now a big time cult classic as is ""The Evil Dead"" which was also ""way out there"" at the time of its release.When the good Dr. Heidel is trying to get his ""creation"", led by the Japanese dude, to fetch him the paper, it is meant as dark humor. Dr. Heidel is totally insane (""I hate human beings"") and should be viewed as an exercise in total madness. Please watch this movie as it was intended: total dark comedy with a human cenepede that only speaks Japanese thrown in for good measure. Even the Trailer/Advertisement & DVD for this flick state: ""100% Medically Accurate"" and people can actually take this statement seriously? C'mon, this is great stuff!

He has already tried his experiment with three dogs (they died). If you have no idea what this movie is about basically he plans to sow three people, rectum to mouth, together so their digestive tracts line up so to speak. So the movie is entertaining (and gross) enough to watch until the end. I think we all were anticipating the first meal...The guy (who is the lead) eats and digests the food and it has no where to go but to the middle girl. Its an awful scene to say the least. If you can't appreciate sick and disgusting movies then don't even bother watching this movie. It's not bloody but seeing them sown together is pretty disturbing.So there was a poignant moment for me and it shocked me. I was just looking for the gross-out scenes and getting ready to give this a one star rating and terrible review. I guess the decent acting created somewhat likable characters. The ""middle"" girl broke down crying and I actually felt bad for her. Her sobbing made her human again and not just some freak in the middle.

1348875,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003L20IEC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Love it or hate it--one thing for sure--you'll definitely have a strong opinion about one of the more original entries into the realm of horror we've seen in some time. ""The Human Centipede"" is an undeniably bent piece of filmmaking! If the very idea of what happens in ""The Human Centipede"" does not peak your interest, then this is absolutely not the film for you. The long and short of the film's plot involves a mad scientist's experiments to join various creatures into a sequence connected by one long shared digestive system. There's a cruder way of saying that--but we all know what's going on here, so I'll maintain some decorum. After having worked with dogs, he's now ready for a human trial. I just want to say that I was so into the premise of this film. I do not shy away from depravity, and I was one of those sick souls who was rooting for ""The Human Centipede"" to be the next great thing in avant garde horror.But delightfully mad premise aside, I must ask myself an important question. Was the film ""good"" and/or was the film ""entertaining."" Now, I know that ""good"" is rather subjective. I did like the awkward presence of Dieter Laser as the mad genius. I know some who will proclaim this a brilliant performance, but I'll just say that I found his creepiness unsettling and his moments of overacting lively. The other cast member performances, however, were decidedly uninspired. Two American girls and a Japanese guy form the links of the Centipede--and in an amusing choice, the annoying Americans are placed in positions two and three so we don't have to listen to them speak for the second half of the picture. The Japanese man, now communicating to no one but the audience via subtitles, is so patently absurd--the dialogue isn't remotely believable, it's painfully clunky. When the cops start investigating, the screenplay doesn't improve in quality.""The Human Centipede"" is so empty headed about police procedure and has no believable protagonists--so when the curiosity wears off, what are we left with? Is the film ""entertaining?"" The film starts out with promise (despite the performances and dialogue) and the set-up is efficient. Once, however, the centipede is created--the film loses some momentum. I will say that the effects are genuinely good and the film doesn't shy away from what it promises. There is just little to do once the action has taken place. Things become surprisingly one-note and the vision of the centerpiece centipede can't sustain interest for the remainder of the picture. I suppose, in a better film, this might have been a riveting psychological sequence as the victims succumb to their new indignities. But ""The Human Centipede"" lets things take a more expected course with the police investigation.Great idea! Great visual execution! Clunky Filmmaking! Awful dialogue and performances (although Laser's mania is, at least, interesting)! ""The Human Centipede"" is a divisive film that some will love and most will hate. Speaking as someone who wanted to love it--I, ultimately, just didn't feel entertained by it.

The poster for this movie would lead you to believe that it is a person with extra arms sewn on, but the reality of the movie is much more disturbing. The fact that Mr. Six was not forthcoming with his investors should tell you something.At the beginning, you have plenty of cliches - car breaks down in the middle of the night, stupid tourists go wandering in the woods alone instead of staying on the road and calling for help, etc etc. Even when the host of the house, the doctor, asks them if they are alone, the girls do not realize something is amiss.Is this movie gross or bloody? No. There's little blood/gore, a lot less than what you would expect, in this aspect this film is cleaner than 'Hostel' and 'Martyr' and the like. The scariest part is when the doctor is explaining to his three bed-bound patients what is going to happen to them with 'helpful' drawings on an overhead display. The fear, revulsion, and terror is clear on the patients' faces, especially when one of the girls cries out for her mommy. One girl manages to break free from her bed, but acts stupidly and is re-captured soon enough.So the two girls and some Japanese dude are sewn together. The Doctor says he wants to make a creature with a continuous digestive system - but despite him being a doctor, he apparently doesn't realize that it's just three digestive systems sewn together, as the middle- and back-pede are now no longer able to use their mouths, they cannot even breathe through it or take in water, so they are doomed and S.O.L. (and 's*** out of luck' is sickeningly literal in this case) This is reflected accurately because the back-pede gets sick from blood poisoning and etc, but then what do you expect when your mouth has been cut and is now a gaping wound sewn to someone else's back-end? He gets mad as he realizes the back-pede is sick, and this guy is supposed to be an acclaimed doctor! Yet it seems as if he has not even a basic understanding of the human anatomy, how it works, and why his centipede 'experiment' is not working. (he tried this before on 3 dogs, which is referenced to in a photo we see at the beginning of the film which shows a centi-dog. Pause the film and look closely, you'll see that the dogs are the same and are clearly a result of Photoshop, lol)Detectives show up to investigate, but like the girls, they made really stupid mistakes that result in their deaths. Oh boy. The Japanese dude that makes up the 'head' of the 'pede goes into harakiri mode, thus trapping the middle-pede while the back-pede is on the verge of death, he is such an idiot because he was the 'head' and thus able to life the upper half of his body, he could have used his advantage to get help, but NO. :(This movie establishes the fact that being a human 'pede would totally suck. However, this movie was not enough for Mr. Six, who now just made a movie where twelve people are sewn together and contains the gore we didn't see in the original and graphic scenes of rape. Are you kidding me? Is such a movie/sequel even necessary after this one?

That way you know it's an honest review from someone who actually saw the film. You will notice that the average star rating is 4-5 stars from actual buyers.)You really have to think for a long time trying to collect names of films that had an original storyline and pushed the boundaries.  With that said, you must applaud this film for giving us something we would have never thought of, and even if thought of, never in a million years would you imagine ever seeing it come to be.Yes, it's a disgusting concept, but this is not gore, nor horror.  It's psychological drama.  As soon as the adult film star tourists get a flat tire in a dark wooded area, you start to think ""not again"". Looking back at the beginning, it was a fantastic setup acting like it's going to be just another predictable horror flick with no plot.  And then you do a 360, and cannot grasp what is happening.  I also did not expect actual acting.  The girls had very strong memorable scenes, and the horrific imagery that stays with you is not what you are seeing, but what they are seeing.  I have never felt the pain of something in the horror genre, but I did here.  The hopelessness, the courage, the faith, the dignity, and the strength. All points that you would normally not care about otherwise.  This is not like ""Saw"", with no point, and you just wait for a new trap.  The entire movie is one trap.  The sickness in some watching is knowing that there is no possible way out of this situation. I won't say what happens to who, but even if everyone lives, all victims died inside mentally. The problem with this film is that it could happen. That is the horror.I truly understand the vast range of ratings and reviews here, but I don't think it's fair. This was not a Hollywood budget film. Therefore, it succeeded on so many levels with very little.  The Director, Tom Six, was interviewed and asked who would he cast if the budget was in place .. he said ""Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lopez and Paris Hilton"" (in that sequence).  To me, that then turns it into comedy.  Can you even imagine?  I like the fact that the cast was unknown as it brought a realism to it.  And the villain has earned himself a spot on the shelf along with Freddy and Jason, but more with Frankenstein than anything.  Note that this is called ""first sequence"" and the Director said that there would be a part two.  The idea he mentioned would include 12 people in a situation.  I have to say, I am intrigued, and will see it.",4,"You are here because you know what it's about.  Therefore, it succeeds.

The diseased mind that came up with the script for this movie needs some serious couch time with a good psychiatrist, but.., it is a refreshingly different low budget horror film. Seriously, this is a cut above the rest, no pun intended.  The reason this film works is because the actors perform well above average.  What separates any bad film from a ""good"" one, and makes it really memorable is the acting.  This could have been another schlocky campy piece of crap rip-off of any other mad-doctor horror flick, but it's not.  I have to give some serious congratulations to the actors in this movie, they had some very difficult scenes to get through, and what stands out is the way they make you feel for the victims.  The film draws you in to the genune suffering of these unfortunate three kidnap victims as they are subjected to the whims of a totally insane surgeon. At some point in this movie you forget you are watching a low budget film, and are focused on the nightmare of the victims as they go through unbearable humiliation and torment.

It says 100% medically accurate as a tag line but ummmmm - thats easy to say when they don't show any medical procedures.  The blood and guts level is no more than an episode of CSI and to an extent even less so.The movie itself is decent.  For those that like Jeffrey Coombs in Reanimator you can expect that type of acting from Dieter Laser. Creepy, over the top, and perfectly suited for the role.  The girls are stereo typical horror chicks no more no less.  But overall the cast works well and are believable enough.  The film has it moments of tension flow decently enough to keep watching from beginngin to end.The Blu-Ray version looks incredible.  Crisp and clear and the audio was well balanced through 5.1. Visually and aurally the movie is well done.  Stuff that together with the decent cast and decent direction the movie works.As a jaded horror fan I did not find this in the least shocking.  For all you hardcore horror fans you will simply think that Tom Six finally put to film a decent version of what we all are thinking as a premise for a movie.  The the casual viewer will find this controversial due to the ick factor but if you have seen TCM, Inside, Martyrs etc...... you have seen much worse (ie Better).Perhaps there is some social commentary in here.

All I have to say is that this is the type of movie you will either LOVE or HATE.My favorite GENRE of HORROR MOVIES is ZOMBIES but I do stray from time to time. NOW - The Human Centipede is not your typical horror movie with gore, blood and suspense. And, NO, it is not pornography on any means (like other viewers had reviewed).It's about a retired doctor, (who after spending years separating conjoined twins, birth anomalies,  etc.), now is trying to do the exact opposite. Attach people together. In order to enjoy this movie, you have to look at it from the doctor's aspect. He has a god complex and wants to create something new to mankind. Almost like a twisted Frankenstein.The movie is in English, German and I'm not sure, might be Chinese. But there is subtitles and in this movie, it really does work!I gave this movie 4-5 stars because it took the story to the next level. It wasn't like other movies where they put together some ridiculous concoction and show just pieces before the story ends. I was pleasantly surprised to see the aftermath of the surgery and how the actors were able to really draw you into believing this had just happened to them. I would have done 5 stars if they would have the doctor explaining the surgery in more medical terms instead of dumbing it down for the viewers. Also, if it didn't have some duh moments, like, why wouldn't you keep stabbing someone to get away?I highly recommend this movie because of the creativity and the storyline it follows.

Yeah, I guess so, but for a movie to have any REAL impact the story and characters itself must draw you in, there must be a bit of identification that carries you through like a well-made ""normal"" film, but then it takes a dark, hopefully horrifying turn. This film qualifies as a gross-out joke ONLY. That's it. The victims - starting off with two attractive tourists - are just cardboard cutout standard slasher film victims. You don't - you NEVER - care about these kinds of characters. It's all just clearly actors hamming it up and how the hell do you get drawn into that? It's nothing but spectacle, the kind typically dreamed up by foreign types. I'm surprised the Japanese didn't dream this one up first. Sure, there's entertainment ""value"" to be had in it, but this thing is way, way below something like Eraserhead, which was actually something of a deadpan comedy, as well as being a work of art (yep, I said so and that makes it true for I am the supreme judge of all things and the rest of you can only follow me). This is... not art... but for certain people it can be watchable, even ""enjoyable"". Here we have filmmaking as nothing but pure one-upsmanship and nothing else. If that's how you wanna play the game, then dreaming up story idea becomes a piece of cake. There's no effort here (technical effort, yes, but creative effort? NO!). How about this one Mr. Six - next time have this guy do his experiment to retarded people... retarded CHILDREN! Poor defenseless retarded children! And then have him rape his creation! Or he can make TWO of these human centipedes and make them have sex - GRAPHIC sex! Two human centipedes made from poor defenseless retarded children raped and then forced to have graphic sex...while their caged mothers are forced to watch, after which they are all cannibalized, raped again (necro style!) and then... oh, I dunno... eaten by the doctor?

Anyway, this thing is just FICTION, you can log onto tons of free porn video sites and see actual people really truly eat one another's feces and vomit and wash it down with urine... FOR REAL!

1348912,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003L20IEC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[11, 16]","The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (Tom Six, 2010)Every once in a while someone attempts to make the grossest movie ever. And oddly, some of these find their way to a major-label release and actually get shown in a theater or two. (Or two thousand, if you're Eli Roth.) Invariably, these ""grossest movies ever"" pale in comparison to the reigning kings of disgust, T. F. Mous' Men Behind the Sun (the original; you can safely ignore the idiotic sequels) and Hideshi Hino's Flower of Flesh and Blood. (The only movie that's come close in the interim, for me, has been Hisayasu Sato's 1995 flick Naked Blood, but I'm the first to admit the gross-out there is more targeted, and I seem to be among those who find the acts it depicts far more unsettling than most.) But it's always amusing to watch the attempt, no matter how far short it falls on that particular scale. Tom Six, whose Gay in Amsterdam made a few waves back in the middle of the last decade, has thrown his hat in the grossest-movie-ever ring with The Human Centipede (First Sequence), which I was ""lucky"" enough to catch on the big screen last weekend. For once, Cleveland was a selected city. I got to feel like a big cosmopolitan critic for an hour and a half. (I hope I'm more Ben Mankiewicz than A. O. Scott.) Roger Ebert has lent some cache to the grossest-movie-ever idea in his review (""No horror film I've seen inflicts more terrible things on its victims..."", he writes). Far be it from me to second-guess Roger Ebert, but I would postulate that this, like Naked Blood, is another of those vertical-market gross-out pictures where how you feel about the disgust factor will be directly influenced by how you feel about Six's particular gross-out.The film kicks off with Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams in her first screen role since Willow, filmed when she was three years old) and Jenny (Fetch's Ashlynn Yennie) in a hotel room in Germany getting ready for a night of clubbing. Following this scene (and including it, depending on how strict you're willing to be with convention) comes a painful, and yet very funny, string of horror film cliches. I read a recent review of Ax 'em (considered by many to be the worst horror movie ever made) which described it as an endless series of bad horror movie cliches strung together; I thought of that again and again while watching the first half-hour of this movie, but Six does lighten the load with humorous punches. Eventually, the two girls end up at the house of Dr. Heiter (Fuhrer Ex's Dieter Laser, looking very Christopher Walken-ish), a retired surgeon who specialized in the separation of conjoined twins. Of course, the doctor is crazy as a brickhouse rat, and has recently turned his attention to the opposite, conjoining previously separate animals (in an opening-scene prologue, we see Heiter sitting in a car staring at pictures of his first experiment before going off to abduct a trucker). He's decided it's time to try some experiments on humans, and these two lovely, though exceptionally annoying, women come stumbling into his house. Providence! Now all he needs is a third...Okay, about the gross-out factor. It's a one-trick pony, and while I'm sure if you're even mildly interested in the film you already know what it is, I'm not going to spoil it for you. But aside from a few surprisingly sterile scenes of surgery and a bit of blood here and there, the gross-out is all in your head. (At one point I actually found myself looking at it from an academic standpoint, thanks no doubt to the movie's ""100% medically accurate!"" tagline, and thinking that the doctor could have... no, that would be cheating.)Given that, if the gross-out factor doesn't work for you, the movie falls flat. There were a number of things Six could have done to change that, most notably keeping the humor level as high throughout as it was in the opening scenes. There are a few attempts at humor as time goes on (Heiter teaching the centipede to walk, a couple of run-ins with an overzealous pair of local cops), but Six doesn't seem as if he was going for horror-comedy along the lines of, say, Cabin Fever here, and that turns out to have not been a good idea. Also, Laser is the only real actor in this cast, and while he's good enough to instinctively grasp that he needs to camp it up in order to play with the amateurs, he's not good enough to carry the entire film on his own.All of these problems I could have overlooked had the movie had a strong enough script. And there's the skeleton of a good, maybe even great, script somewhere in this movie. Six's hook is undeniably compelling, whether you end up liking it or not, but once he actually gets where he's going with the creation of the centipede, his idea fountain seems to have petered out. That's when the necessity of the gross-out takes over. Solid gross-out, with nothing else to back it up, can work on occasion, but it has to really be the grossest movie ever (I keep coming back to Flower of Flesh and Blood, which is entirely plotless, but still compelling, in a way that makes you feel like the sickest sonofabitch who ever walked the planet for not being able to tear your eyes away). Otherwise, you really do need a plot. And that road's been travelled, as well (and we're back to Men Behind the Sun). The gold standards, once again, remain the gold standards.Ebert, who gave the film no stars (something he very, very rarely does), did say in the film's defense that Six has ""the soul of a dark artist."" I'm more inclined to award that accolade to cinematographer Goof de Koning, Six's longtime associate, who knows how to pretty things up in just the right way, and is equally at home in almost-blinding sunlight and the cold operating room, but I do have to admit the silly thing looks good, even if it is mostly style with little substance.

Indeed, aside from some old-fashioned gun shooting sequences, a couple of throat-slitting incidents, and a stabbing through the foot, this is actually one of those films that of which the audience, most likely, is thankful for its relatively minimalistic approach to its subject matter, the title of which already implies that it could be up there alongside some of the grossest and violent films of all time. Ironically, the film is deliberately restraint, and one could even say slow-moving, from those who are merely seeing it from a point of view of a gorehound. But like the aforementioned rash or sore that won't seem to go away, and actually seems to progressively get bigger, ""The Human Centipede"" still retains that excruciatingly foul and disgusting lingering byproduct from dealing with its premise, regardless of Six's deliberately subtle treatment of it. The idea just oozes with sick abomination and depravity, and no matter how restraint and subtle the director is in approaching it, the foundational base of the idea is just perpetually fraught with vileness a well-meaning, well-intended discourse that will come out of this is still hard to swallow, no pun intended; a self-perpetuating destruction of its credibility if you will, since the idea is pretty sick and nasty to begin with. Still, Six's emphasizing on the three very unlucky victims should be rightly commended: though they start off as typically obnoxious, they are the brunt of some of the most heinous and terrifying treatment in the hands of the evil doctor, played with much gusto by the German actor, Dieter Laser. The ending is brutal, and uncompromising, and the poetry that comes out of the Japanese guy, who finally decides to make a turnaround in response to the situation that he is in is genuinely moving and powerful.Six's ""The Human Centipede"" is the stuff of really off-putting and foul material, but as his lenses focus on the humiliation, suffering and subjugation of the three victims, as opposed to the doctor's autopsy, or even a prolonged feeding scene of the three characters as the centipede, what could be juvenile, unjustifiable trash is really a work of a director with an unflinching, if not unique, vision.

But what luck at finding a house.  Too bad it's a mad doctor's house who used to separate Siamese twins but who now seems to have developed a taste for putting things together.  Had it been me going to the door of that house, one look at the doctor and I'd have said ""sorry to bother you, back into the rain and cold I go"".  The first subject that the good doctor kidnapped doesn't fit the bill though so off he goes and an unfortunate Japanese tourist takes his place.  The doc IS kind enough to explain what he's about to do to his patients though, which of course horrifies them, and the one that tries to escape, well, SHE gets to be in the middle.  Of course the good doctor is just so busy he doesn't bother to think of the implications of the cars belonging to missing people in the general area of his house, and the cops come to visit, but hey...do not expect any happy endings here.How anyone came up with THIS idea for a horror film is beyond me, but it certainly is a disgusting premise.

Man's profound need of art lies in the fact that his cognitive faculty is conceptual, i.e., that he acquires knowledge by means of abstractions, and needs the power to bring his widest metaphysical abstractions into his immediate, perceptual awareness. Art fulfills this need: by means of a selective re-creation, it concretizes man's fundamental view of himself and of existence. It tells man, in effect, which aspects of his experience are to be regarded as essential, significant, important. In this sense, art teaches man how to use his consciousness. It conditions or stylizes man's consciousness by conveying to him a certain way of looking at existence.""The emotion involved in art is not an emotion in the ordinary meaning of the term. It is experienced more as a ""sense"" or a ""feel,"" but it has two characteristics pertaining to emotions: it is automatically immediate and it has an intense, profoundly personal (yet undefined) value-meaning to the individual experiencing it. The value involved is life, and the words naming the emotion are: ""This is what life means to me.""- Ayn RandThe above quotes compose a quite brilliant definition of art. And when I first read them at 17, they stayed with me. Essentially, the art you make...the art you love...is the art you are. That is, any representation of your vision of life that you have concretized in some tangible form is ART. This film is ART. But what makes good art? That which shows why life is worth living. Bad art...horrific art...is that which shows why life is not worth living.There have been many horror films made over the years. Films like The Wicker Man were effective because they showed two sides of evil, and stay with you as a warning. Some are fun, some are ridiculous, some are frightening (The Shining) and others are kind of brilliant (The Stand). Part of the allure of horror is that you can enter the chamber where your fear exists, battle it out, experiencing all those emotions...and WIN. You can beat the fear, destroy and vanquish that evil whether they be Daleks or zombies.But lately, entertainment from Oprah to Jersey Shore...has been about exposing people, humiliating them and watching them destroyed in front of you...emotionally...spiritually...physically...sexually. I mention Oprah and her associates (Sally, Dr. Phil, Jerry Springer, etc.) because they opened the doors making it acceptable to laugh, snicker and sneer at the most horrendous failing of human beings way back in the 80's...at all levels. Then their child was born...Reality TV and it's conjoined twin of ""mind-porn""...videogames where the goal is to murder and rob people...this is the new culture that SOME of us live in. Too many in fact.This film...is the culmination. From Aristotle to Erasmus...to John Locke...to Jefferson...to the end of our civilization and the beginning of something...new...and quite horrible.You think I'm being melodramatic right? Not really I'm afraid. The first thing that occurred to me when I heard about this film...was that someone would go and try this after seeing it. I don't believe in censorship so that's not the issue. But what sort of depraved, disgusting human being would want to see this made real as ART? Even as a punishment for a child molester? Shall we destroy evil by adopting and practicing it? And in this film, these are not child molesters, are they? They are victims. So it was quite interesting to see that the Director is now making a sequel that will beat the actual psychopath to the punch, and showcase a ""fan-boy"" copying the actions of this lovely doctor.Really...saying this film and the director is ""sick"" is simply underwhelming. He is in fact what we have been waiting for...begging for...he is a mark on our culture of how far we have fallen and proof positive that this civilization...western civilization no longer has confidence in its ideas...its convictions. It no longer loves the beautiful and hates evil. It stands for next to nothing except for hedonistic enjoyment of destruction...or mindless authoritarianism...Lighten up right? No. Not this time.Amazon should be condemned for selling this atrocity. Censorship is only possible with the Government. But any private company can make a choice on what they sell and stand by it. As to the Director, he is what he made here. This is his artistic vision. I hope that he stands for it, and by it, as I believe he does. Or perhaps, we should say, it's what's inside that counts (pun intended)...and this lovely Director is the only thing actually connected to this film ...that is literally full of it...",1,From Dawn to Decadence,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,4713,"['Art', 'selective', 're-creation', 'reality', 'according', 'artist', 'metaphysical', 'view', 'existence', 'value-judgments', 'Man', 'profound', 'need', 'art', 'fact', 'cognitive', 'faculty', 'conceptual', 'i.e.', 'knowledge', 'means', 'abstractions', 'power', 'bring', 'widest', 'metaphysical', 'abstractions', 'immediate', 'perceptual', 'awareness', 'Art', 'need', 'means', 'selective', 're-creation', 'man', 'fundamental', 'view', 'existence', 'man', 'effect', 'experience', 'are', 'be', 'regarded', 'essential', 'significant', 'important', 'sense', 'art', 'teaches', 'man', 'how', 'use', 'consciousness', 'conditions', 'man', 'consciousness', 'conveying', 'certain', 'way', 'looking', 'existence', 'emotion', 'involved', 'art', 'not', 'emotion', 'ordinary', 'meaning', 'term', 'experienced', 'more', 'sense', 'feel', 'two', 'characteristics', 'pertaining', 'emotions', 'automatically', 'immediate', 'intense', 'profoundly', 'personal', 'yet', 'undefined', 'value-meaning', 'individual', 'experiencing', 'value', 'involved', 'life', 'words', 'naming', 'emotion', 'are', 'what', 'life', 'Ayn', 'RandThe', 'quotes', 'compose', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'definition', 'art', 'when', 'first', 'read', '17', 'stayed', 'Essentially', 'art', 'make', 'art', 'love', 'art', 'are', 'representation', 'vision', 'life', 'have', 'concretized', 'tangible', 'form', 'ART', 'film', 'ART', 'what', 'good', 'art', 'why', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'Bad', 'art', 'horrific', 'art', 'why', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living.There', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'years', 'Films', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'were', 'effective', 'showed', 'two', 'sides', 'evil', 'stay', 'warning', 'are', 'fun', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'frightening', 'Shining', 'others', 'are', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'Stand', 'Part', 'allure', 'horror', 'can', 'enter', 'chamber', 'where', 'fear', 'exists', 'battle', 'out', 'experiencing', 'emotions', 'WIN', 'can', 'beat', 'fear', 'destroy', 'vanquish', 'be', 'Daleks', 'zombies.But', 'lately', 'entertainment', 'Oprah', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'been', 'exposing', 'people', 'humiliating', 'watching', 'destroyed', 'front', 'emotionally', 'spiritually', 'physically', 'sexually', 'mention', 'Oprah', 'associates', 'Sally', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'etc', 'opened', 'doors', 'making', 'acceptable', 'laugh', 'snicker', 'sneer', 'most', 'horrendous', 'failing', 'human', 'beings', 'way', 'back', '80', 'levels', 'Then', 'child', 'was', 'born', 'Reality', 'TV', 'conjoined', 'twin', 'mind-porn', 'where', 'goal', 'murder', 'rob', 'people', 'new', 'culture', 'SOME', 'live', 'Too', 'many', 'fact.This', 'film', 'culmination', 'Aristotle', 'Erasmus', 'John', 'Locke', 'Jefferson', 'end', 'civilization', 'beginning', 'something', 'new', 'quite', 'horrible.You', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'melodramatic', 'right', 'Not', 'really', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'first', 'thing', 'occurred', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'someone', 'would', 'go', 'try', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'censorship', 'not', 'issue', 'what', 'sort', 'depraved', 'disgusting', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'made', 'real', 'ART', 'Even', 'punishment', 'child', 'molester', 'Shall', 'destroy', 'evil', 'adopting', 'practicing', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'child', 'molesters', 'are', 'are', 'victims', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'Director', 'now', 'making', 'sequel', 'will', 'beat', 'actual', 'psychopath', 'punch', 'showcase', 'fan-boy', 'copying', 'actions', 'lovely', 'doctor.Really', 'saying', 'film', 'director', 'sick', 'simply', 'underwhelming', 'fact', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'begging', 'mark', 'culture', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'fallen', 'proof', 'positive', 'civilization', 'western', 'civilization', 'no', 'longer', 'confidence', 'ideas', 'convictions', 'no', 'longer', 'beautiful', 'evil', 'next', 'nothing', 'hedonistic', 'enjoyment', 'destruction', 'mindless', 'authoritarianism', 'Lighten', 'up', 'right', 'No', 'Not', 'time.Amazon', 'should', 'be', 'condemned', 'selling', 'atrocity', 'Censorship', 'only', 'possible', 'Government', 'private', 'company', 'can', 'make', 'choice', 'what', 'sell', 'stand', 'Director', 'what', 'made', 'here', 'artistic', 'vision', 'hope', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'what', 'inside', 'pun', 'intended', 'lovely', 'Director', 'only', 'thing', 'actually', 'connected', 'film', 'literally', 'full']",N/A

Low bucks, not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, yet somehow quite entertaining.Stock plot, crazy scientist performing gruesome animal experiments that would make Dr. Mengele cringe. Next logical step, do the same thing with people.So now we need to procure some ""subjects"" (aka ""victims"") for his experiments, conveniently provided in the form of a couple of vacuous American bimbos on a road trip across Europe. Our ""subjects"" to be decide to go out on the town clubbing, which in Germany apparantely involves driving down a goat path through what appears to be rural Appalachia until their car becomes disabled. A flat tire is slightly less clich&eacute; than running out of gas I suppose. Unwilling to lower themselves to such a mundane task as changing a flat (or perhaps simply not intelligent enough to read the instructions on how to do so) our scantily clad ladies set off on foot through the woods at night in a cold rain without knowing where they are or where they are going, or which way is up for that matter. And through a series of twists and turns that involve Rohypnol, tranquilizer darts and various forms of torture end up as 2/3 of our deranged doctor's entry in the Third Reich Science Fair, the eponymous Human Centipede.No real drama or suspense involved, you could pretty much predict what was going to happen next throughout the whole movie. But you will stick with it to the end and be left with the desire to watch the sequel.

Well, Todd Six has had this conversation, and then he went ahead and made a movie out of it.So, here we have Human Centipede, a movie generating a cult film buzz based solely on it's gimmicky and oddball premise.......and what a premise it is!  I do have to give it full points for originality.  However, the gimmick is where all originality ceases.  The gimmick is really all it has going for it.  Otherwise this movie plays out pretty much like any other recent torture porn flick.  Remove the Cronenbergism from the film and you could easily have this wacko doctor running a basement torture chamber where he hacks off victims' limbs to create artwork or forces people to listen to Nickelback, or whatever the hell they like to do in torture porn films anymore.  Basically it's on par with the standard straight-to-video type horror, but with a bit of an edge.  That's really all I can say about it.I really do have to give kudos to the three principal actors who make up the ""centipede"".  They're really not required to do much heavy acting per se, but they have to spend the bulk of the film dirt smeared,(mostly)naked, crying, and in an all around degrading position.  They're definitely troopers.All in all, I wouldn't let the hype get your hopes up.  It's got a bit of entertainment value, but it's not nearly as disturbing, frightening , violent or gory as you're lead to believe.  To the average Iron Man 2 goer, maybe.

1348935,A9HB18W9DAC1V,B003L20IEC,Toby J Martin,"[4, 7]","Human Centipede. It's been all the rage all over the internet, and for some reason unbeknown to me, even people who don't follow horror movies know about it. For a film that only has a small release that's pretty impressive, so that should already tell you there's something special about it.If you don't know what Human Centipede is all about though, then let me give you a quick one line synopsis...It's a movie about a INSANE doctor who wants to make a ""centipede"" by sewing people together into a human conga-line of sorts. How is this possible you ask? Lets find out.Lindsay (Ashley C Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) are two attractive girls visiting Germany from New York who decide to have a nice fun-filled night out on the town. While on the road, their car gets a flat tire out in the woods (doesn't that just ALWAYS seem to happen), and after an older gentleman pulls up to help them and hit on them, they decide that maybe walking through the woods to find help is a better plan. Eventually they reach the house of Doctor Heiter (Dieter Laser), a man who from the moment you see him, you know he's insane. Of course the girls ask him for help, and after making sure they're alone, he drugs them so that he can keep them for his experiment.As the two girls awaken tied to their hospital beds, they're treated to one of the funniest overhead projector presentations ever: Doctor Heiter talks to his audience (the two girls, and prisoner #3 Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura)) about how he's known as the top surgeon in regards to removing Siamese twins, and how he just wants more in life. He tells us about how he once created the legendary ""3-dog"" made from Rottweilers, and the process behind it, and then the slideshow begins. The entire surgical process (which apparently is ""100% accurate"") is discussed with hilarious drawings of how he's going to basically cut out everyone's knee caps so they can't stand, and how he's going to sew every one together from rear to mouth, to make a human centipede.Once the centipede is created, and all the awkwardness from having to watch one of the weirdest and most disturbing things you'll ever see is gone, the movie is actually pretty funny. Yes, that's right, this movie is entertaining, mostly in the fact that everything that happens after the centipede is created is completely ridiculous and nonsensical.Want to see the guy at the head of the centipede eat out of dog bowl while the Doctor eats breakfast? Check.Want to hear the Doctor scream at one of the girls in the rear segment to swallow poop? Check.It's extremely exploitative, but it's so over the top that it actually tones down the disgusting aspects of it.The main flaw and complaint I have about this movie isn't necessarily the story itself, but the flow of the story. The movie is basically three acts: The first fifteen minutes which are amazing and nerve wracking (because you're waiting to see the centipede), the middle forty five minutes which is the creation and ""use"" of the human centipede, and the last twenty to thirty minutes which could be thrown away. While the first two parts are at least entertaining and flow into each other, it all comes crashing to a halt in act three. It's actually really disappointing in regards to the whole film, because it really kills the mood that was building up until that point.The other flaw in the film that gets a little aggravating after a while is that it pretty much uses EVERY horror cliche that's out there. I realize we're in 2010 and a lot of things have already been done, but when most of the script seems like fill in the blanks for a horror movie, it's a little disappointing. The concept of the film is obviously completely out there and brand spanking new, but to have it presented in such a boring package is disheartening.While I do have such a huge complaint about the story (and progression), I don't want you to think this is a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining for a film who's selling point is getting to see butts sewn to mouths. I give a lot of props to Dieter Laser because he actually seems legitimately crazy at some points, and he does an amazing job of portraying someone who's both emotionally void and out of his mind at the same time.One last interesting factoid is that the subtitle of this movie is (First Sequence), and after looking on IMDB, apparently there's a sequel coming out in 2011 with the subtitle of (Full Sequence). This both intrigues and scares me, only for the thought that maybe they'll attach more people next time. I mean, come on now, centipedes have ""100 legs"", and CGI nowadays is pretty realistic.And besides, when else are you going to see a non-adult film that completely revolves around going butt to mouth?",4,Science = fun,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,4749,"['Human', 'Centipede', 'been', 'rage', 'internet', 'reason', 'unbeknown', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'horror', 'movies', 'know', 'film', 'only', 'small', 'release', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'should', 'already', 'tell', 'something', 'special', 'it.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'then', 'let', 'give', 'quick', 'one', 'line', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'INSANE', 'doctor', 'who', 'make', 'centipede', 'sewing', 'people', 'together', 'human', 'conga-line', 'sorts', 'How', 'possible', 'ask', 'Lets', 'find', 'out.Lindsay', 'Ashley', 'C', 'Williams', 'Jenny', 'Ashlynn', 'Yennie', 'are', 'two', 'attractive', 'girls', 'visiting', 'Germany', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'decide', 'have', 'nice', 'fun-filled', 'night', 'out', 'town', 'road', 'car', 'flat', 'tire', 'woods', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'ALWAYS', 'seem', 'happen', 'older', 'gentleman', 'up', 'help', 'hit', 'decide', 'maybe', 'walking', 'woods', 'find', 'help', 'better', 'plan', 'Eventually', 'reach', 'house', 'Doctor', 'Heiter', 'Dieter', 'Laser', 'man', 'who', 'moment', 'see', 'know', 'insane', 'course', 'girls', 'ask', 'help', 'making', 'sure', ""'re"", 'alone', 'drugs', 'so', 'can', 'keep', 'experiment.As', 'two', 'girls', 'awaken', 'tied', 'hospital', 'beds', ""'re"", 'treated', 'one', 'funniest', 'overhead', 'projector', 'presentations', 'ever', 'Doctor', 'Heiter', 'talks', 'audience', 'two', 'girls', 'prisoner', '3', 'Katsuro', 'Akihiro', 'Kitamura', 'how', 'known', 'top', 'surgeon', 'regards', 'removing', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'how', 'just', 'more', 'life', 'how', 'once', 'created', 'legendary', '3-dog', 'made', 'Rottweilers', 'process', 'then', 'slideshow', 'entire', 'surgical', 'process', 'apparently', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'discussed', 'hilarious', 'drawings', 'how', 'going', 'basically', 'cut', 'out', 'everyone', 'knee', 'caps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'how', 'going', 'sew', 'one', 'together', 'rear', 'mouth', 'make', 'human', 'centipede.Once', 'centipede', 'created', 'awkwardness', 'having', 'watch', 'one', 'weirdest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'things', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'gone', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Yes', 'right', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'fact', 'everything', 'centipede', 'created', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'nonsensical.Want', 'see', 'guy', 'head', 'centipede', 'eat', 'dog', 'bowl', 'Doctor', 'eats', 'breakfast', 'Check.Want', 'hear', 'Doctor', 'scream', 'one', 'girls', 'rear', 'segment', 'swallow', 'poop', 'Check.It', 'extremely', 'exploitative', 'so', 'top', 'actually', 'down', 'disgusting', 'aspects', 'it.The', 'main', 'flaw', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'story', 'flow', 'story', 'movie', 'basically', 'three', 'acts', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'are', 'amazing', 'nerve', 'wracking', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'see', 'centipede', 'middle', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'creation', 'use', 'human', 'centipede', 'last', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'could', 'be', 'thrown', 'away', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'least', 'entertaining', 'flow', 'other', 'crashing', 'halt', 'act', 'three', 'actually', 'really', 'disappointing', 'regards', 'whole', 'film', 'really', 'mood', 'was', 'building', 'up', 'other', 'flaw', 'film', 'little', 'aggravating', 'while', 'pretty', 'much', 'uses', 'EVERY', 'horror', 'cliche', 'out', 'there', 'realize', ""'re"", '2010', 'lot', 'things', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'when', 'most', 'script', 'fill', 'blanks', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'disappointing', 'concept', 'film', 'obviously', 'completely', 'there', 'brand', 'spanking', 'new', 'have', 'presented', 'such', 'boring', 'package', 'disheartening.While', 'do', 'have', 'huge', 'complaint', 'story', 'progression', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'bad', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'film', 'who', 'selling', 'point', 'getting', 'see', 'butts', 'sewn', 'mouths', 'give', 'lot', 'props', 'Dieter', 'Laser', 'actually', 'legitimately', 'crazy', 'points', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'someone', 'who', 'emotionally', 'void', 'mind', 'same', 'time.One', 'last', 'interesting', 'factoid', 'subtitle', 'movie', 'First', 'Sequence', 'looking', 'IMDB', 'apparently', 'sequel', 'coming', 'out', '2011', 'subtitle', 'Full', 'Sequence', 'intrigues', 'scares', 'only', 'thought', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'attach', 'more', 'people', 'time', 'mean', 'come', 'now', 'centipedes', 'have', '100', 'legs', 'CGI', 'nowadays', 'pretty', 'realistic.And', 'besides', 'when', 'else', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'non-adult', 'film', 'completely', 'around', 'going', 'butt', 'mouth']",N/A

1348938,A2M9H45CBS0UH0,B003L20IEC,Tommy Jeffers,"[8, 21]","I have two main points about THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE.One:If the director/writer (Tom Six) or should it be (Tom Sick) intended to create one of the most uncomfortable and disgust driven pieces of cinema in the history of mankind, he did it to the hilt.  This is one of the most horrific situations a person could find themselves in.  Death would be preferable.  The horror comes from the situation presented on screen.  The viewer is forced to experience the awful predicament of the victims as a demented madman gets his jollies from them.  The entire ""first sequence"" is torture porn, body mutilation, and of course has direct references to Coprophilia.  In short, had I known what the entire movie had involved I would not have seen it.  (This is just not my cup of tea.)  I admit that you can't get it out of your head for quite a while.  Some things you just can't ""unsee.""Two:The acting is mediocre until the horror starts.  Then the victims cry and plead in a believable fashion.  Before this, the two young ladies have a flat tire and no cell phone service in the middle of nowhere.  (How typical.)  Their acting is fairly terrible until they are captured.  A series of bad decisions and one failed opportunity doom them to their fate.  Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) is appropriately creepy and his acting is so over the top, I wonder why anyone would go in to his house let alone accept a glass of water from him.  He is depicted in a very ""Nazi-like"" manner.  The scenes had to be uncomfortable to film; I'll give the actors their due.  I think a gag (no pun intended) reel of bloopers would likely be hilarious.  The strongest actor in the film is the Japanese Businessman.  His rants and yells show some serious guts in his portrayal.  This movie is largely a waste of time full of disgusting and disturbing images.NOT FOR KIDS!

1348940,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003L20IEC,trebe,"[4, 5]","While story development may not be very extensive, Tom Six's The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (2010) does have an outlandish and original concept, that for better or worse, probably breaks some new ground in the horror genre, as a demented doctor performs some truly gruesome surgical procedures.  Be advised that some spoilers follow.American tourists Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie), have car trouble while travelling in Germany.  Looking for help, they happen across the home of Dr. Heiter (Deiter Laser), a deranged physician who unfortunately has some rather sinister plans for them.  The girls are drugged, and are then tied down to hospital beds, located in a room in the basement.  A man is similarly bound to a third bed, but because he is ""incompatible"", Heiter euthanizes him.  The empty bed is soon filled by Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura), an angry Japanese man, who expends his energy raving and cursing, as the doctor clinically describes the shocking procedure has planned for them, the formation of a three person ""human centipede"".While the actors credit for enduring what must have been a lot of discomfort, after such a dramatic build up, although quite grotesque, the human centipede is still something of a disappointment, as the construct is nearly helpless.  On their knees, joined together butt to mouth, the ""first sequence"" finds Katsuro in the lead position, with Lindsay in the middle, and Jenny at the rear.  As you imagine what they may be experiencing, you may have some empathy for their situation.  Having lost the use of their lower legs, even working together, this group can barely move.  There are several scenes of the ""centipede"" upstairs in the house, and even outside in the yard, although how the construct managed to get there from the basement is not shown.After the horrific transformation, not much that follows is really scary.  The ""centipede"" is more of a curiosity, where the gross out element is the passing of waste from one person to another.  Thankfully the matter of taking a pee never arises.  The women are topless, but down on all fours, you don't see very much.  Unable to speak, the women are usually moaning and crying.  Being at the front, Katsuro becomes the de facto leader, but since he speaks only Japanese, his ability to communicate is limited, as he continues to vent his anger and frustration.The sudden appearance of some police detectives investigating the disappearance of Heiter's victims, takes the film to a violent, though not very credible conclusion, as the centipede makes a rather laborious journey upstairs from the basement.  After a few impactful action sequences, this macabre experiment closes on a tragic note.Writer/director Tom Six's dark vision definitely scores some points for originality.  The film quickly establishes a creepy atmosphere, and raises expectations for something quite intense.

Something happens and they find themselves looking for survival in the very place they thought would shelter them, in their mad-scientist savior's home.In my view, this movie belongs to a strain of punchy European horror movies around the likes of Inside, Martyrs, Haute Tension: intelligent yet disturbing horror films that make US or Asian productions pale in comparison. Now, avid gore, SFX-seekers, hardcore horror fans looking for first-degree, violence-for-free stuff like Saw or Hostel might be disappointed as horror is more subtle here. Rather, the depicted horror leaves a lingering feeling of weirdness LONG after having watched the movie. It is neither the scenario (basic), nor the use of SFX (few and low-key), the theme (Frankenstein myth) or gore `n blood (virtually non-existent, as most of the violence is suggested). Horror comes from this illustration of Rabelais' centuries-old ""science without conscience is the ruin of the soul"".There's this brilliant, clinically precise scientist who's no longer capable of caring for human individuals... who quickly becomes the embodiment of the ultimate nightmare... the human monster with brains and no empathy whose mantra could be: ""I-want-your-body-because-you-are-material-for-creation-now-try-to-understand-if-you-can"". This monster prays on innocent people (foreigners who have nothing to be criticized for) for only one reason: they crossed his path to Creation and God... It's about surgery seen as arts, no matter the victims'suffering and humiliation. There is a subliminal reminiscence of past illustrations of this very type of horror : human experiments in WW2's Nazi and China-based Japanese prisoner camps... Plus, the main character is German, the action takes place in Germany and supporting characters are Japanese and Americans... Now, do you recall??The clinical edge of the movie is achieved mainly through cold lighting, settings and shooting as well as the deliberate disregard for any primary color. Materials and colors are dull, soul-less. The six main actors/actresses add credibility to the whole narrative. Dieter Laser, the German actor, is top notch in his portraying of a cold, unpredictable, unreachable, worldwide renown yet morally-dead scientist celebrity who admits ""hating humans"".This movie's worth watching but be warned, it requires tolerance towards moral horror.
