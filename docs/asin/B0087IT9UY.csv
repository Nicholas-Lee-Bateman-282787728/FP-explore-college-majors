The story of Mexico's several Masonic, and brutal and pathologically anti-Catholic and Christophobic governments, and the resultant emergence of the noble Cristeros, is one well worth telling.""For Greater Glory"" makes the effort, to be sure, but the result is marred.  In addition to being too long, and with an uneven storyline, there's an egregious blunder -- the multiple references to the Cristeros' supposed struggle for democracy and religious liberty.  What rubbish, and reminiscent of Pope Benedict XVI's ridiculous contention that the early Christian martyrs died for religious freedom, when they in fact died for the Faith alone.  The Cristeros, and quite rightly too, didn't give a damn about democracy's largely illusory attributes or about people's supposed right to religious indifferentism and syncretism; they fought -- and died -- for Catholicism.  And how close they came to success!  Pius XI -- a very good pontiff in most respects -- blundered badly in not giving Mexico's Catholic heroes the support they so desperately needed and so richly deserved.  How different history might have been if he had.

The movie is about this seminal civil war in Mexico's history. It's well told and has some terrific acting (and not just from the big names of Andy Garcia and Peter O'Toole). Ruben Blades is especially outstanding as Mexican President Plutarco Elias Calles giving him just the right balance between practical politico and arrogant evil. Evan Longoria is sadly wasted with hardly any screentime as the general of the rebel force Enrique Gorostieta Velarde (Andy Garcia's character). Yet despite all these ""names"" it is the Adrian Alonso who plays the young kid Lalo who steals the movie.The extra on the DVD of the actual war has lots of great background and insight as well as some amazing footage and old black-and-white stills from the era.  It may be worth watching first to get an idea of the story. It really won't ruin the movie for you.Sadly, my main complaint is the way this movie looks. It looks like a made-for-TV movie because the cinematography lets the whole thing down.

It's most unfortunate that American Catholics--and American Christians more generally--didn't give this film the support it deserved.The film is not a documentary about the Cristiada, so of course it has historical inaccuracies. Father Reyes Vega is whitewashed; in fact, he was apparently an intemperate and violent man who had no priestly vocation and became a priest only because he was pressured.  (As I recall, there's nothing in the film recognizing that a priest who takes up arms is barred by canon law from the exercise of priestly functions, such as celebrating mass.)Reviewers have complained that the narrative is confusing. I don't entirely disagree; the problem comes mostly, however, from the parts dealing with the nonviolent opposition to the Calles law. The war isn't unduly difficult to follow. The battle scenes are exciting; the characters are vivid; the performances are good or better.The smarmy reviews of this film drip with the odium fidei of our ruling culture. One especially nasty review described the film as ""arch"" and referred to Genl. Gorostieta as ""General Velarde."" My dictionary defines ""arch"" as ""gaily mischievous; pert.""

1547652,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B0087IT9UY,Christopher Schwinger,"[14, 14]","This is a very satisfying film.  Based on the real Cristero War in Mexico, in which Catholics fought against the president's anti-clerical laws in the 1920s, this movie is a strong exhortation to take a stand for what you believe.  I can see no better way than this movie for people to understand the importance of religious freedom if they've started to take it for granted.  It's essentially a mix of the war movie genre and epic ""El Cid""-type genre.  Unlike almost every other period movie made in recent years, this movie didn't feel fake to me.  The young actor who plays Jose, one of the main characters, is excellent, and the actor playing the general leading the Catholic ""Cristeros"", Andy Garcia, makes his character believable even though the script doesn't allow him an extensive character transformation from skeptic to die-hard Christian.  The Mexican president, Calles, was also very convincing, having developed a rationale to convince himself violence against Catholics was necessary.  People don't order atrocities without beliefs motivating them, including Calles, who was convinced Catholicism was a barrier to progress because it created divided loyalties between the pontificate and the president.  The R rating is on account of the extent of the violence (many soldiers get shot down), but it is not graphic.  There are 3 criteria I have for good war movies, ALL of which this satisfies:1.  Not overly dramatized2.  Not gratuitous (that is, not graphic without cause)3.  Not overly glamorous/glorifiedThe cinematography was well-done in its location shooting and violent sequences.  The power of the violent sequences comes from the gun noises and the fast whirls of the camera, but I never got confused about who was where in the battle scenes, to the filmmakers' credit--I know that's hard to perform.

1547654,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B0087IT9UY,Dean A. Anderson,"[43, 47]","I didn't get to see this in the theater. I can understand why the film had a short run at the theater. It is the directorial debut of Dean Wright (who did 2nd unit work on the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Narnia"" films.) At nearly 2  hours, the historical epic loses its narrative way on occasion and drags at times. Some of the performances are pretty good (by Andy Garcia and Eva Longoria), and some (particularly by children and an ancient looking Peter O'Toole) not so much. It is at turns maudlin and at others brutally violent.But I was still glad to see it because it tells a fascinating historical story that I was unaware of before the film's meager promotional campaign began. In 1926, the Marxist President of Mexico Plutarco El&iacute;as Calles decided to enforce the anti-clerical ordinances in Mexico's new constitution (such as prohibiting priests wearing clerical garb in public and prohibiting  preaching negatively about the government.) When the Catholic Church disobeyed these restrictions, the government reacted by banning Mass and arresting and killing priests.This brought about a guerrilla war against the government that lasted for three years. Eventually, the Church in Rome and the United States government intervened, and a truce was reached. But though rights were returned to the church, most of the leaders of the Cristiada movement were arrested and executed.One of the reasons I think this film, in spite of its weaknesses, is still worth seeking out is because the issue of religious liberty is still a pressing concern. In many nations, particularly Muslim and Communist regimes, Christians are being arrested and killed for their beliefs and practices. In the film, the United States government finally intervenes on behalf of the Catholic Church in Mexico because of pressure from Catholics in the United States. (The most outspoken group for the issue was the Knights of Columbus. The KKK, on the other hand, supported the persecution by Mexico's socialist government.)Even in the United States, Evangelical and Catholic Churches are fighting for their rights as the current administration is imposing abortion and birth control mandates.

This movie can only be compared to such cinematic masterpieces as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" The story of Mexico's Cristero Rebellion - long buried and seemingly forgotten - deserved to be told, and beautifully told it is, thanks to Andy Garcia. The message of the movie also needed retelling: that freedom is fragile and easily crushed by an all powerful State in the hands of it's enemies, unless ordinary people stand up and say ""Enough!"" ""No More"" - often at great cost to those individuals who do so.Given the ""Kulturkampf"" being carried out against Christianity and the Catholic Church in the U.S. today, this is an extremely timely story. The enemies of religious freedom in the Marxist Mexico of the 1920's were the same as they are in contemporary America - militant atheists with the power of the State and its instruments of coercion in their hands. (I write these words as a life-long agnostic, who has always cherished the religious liberty and freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment - both of which are under assault today by the so-called ""liberal"" establishment.)As a movie, ""For Greater Glory"" is virtually flawless: a first rate script that delivers pitch perfect dialogue, with an outstanding performances by an excellent cast, including Andy Garcia (as General Enrique Velarde, leader of the Cristeros), Peter O'Toole (as Father Christopher), Oscar Isaac, Santiago Cabrera, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Eva Longoria, Eduardo Verastegui, and Rubin Blades (as the fanatic atheist, President Calles); but especially Mauricio Kuri (who plays the young martyr Jose Luis). There is not a false note or an unconvincing scene anywhere in the film. This is a long movie - almost three hours - but it never lags or fails to hold the viewer's attention. Every scene contributes to the story and its impact on the audience. Not a single scene is irrelevant or insignificant. From the opening episode between Jose Luis and Father Christopher the viewer is gripped by the story and riveted to the action on the screen. He becomes personally involved in what is happening before his eyes - no longer merely a viewer, but an emotional participant in the unfolding story.Like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" this is a powerful movie, with a powerful message about man's capacity for evil and cruelty, and the murderous consequences of a State driven by ideology and fanaticism; but also about man's capacity for resistance to tyranny and for self-sacrifice, his willingness to defend his faith and to fight for liberty and justice, and to come to the aid of the weak and helpless caught in the hands of a powerful and ruthless enemy.As the Catholic Church has belatedly come to recognize, the too long forgotten heroes of the Cristiada were martyrs in the cause of religious liberty. At any other time in America (i.e. the 1940s or the 1950s, for example) ""For Greater Glory"" would have been instantly recognized as a classic masterpiece in the same category as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Casablanca."" Instead, when it first hit the movie theaters there was a concerted effort by Hollywood's leftist establishment to denigrate the movie in an obvious effort to discourage people from seeing it. It is heartening to see all the positive reviews on Amazon.com, and also on IMDB, now that the movie is available on DVD.",5,Viva Cristo Rey!,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3402,"['great', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'story', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'compared', 'such', 'cinematic', 'masterpieces', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'story', 'Mexico', 'Cristero', 'Rebellion', 'long', 'buried', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'deserved', 'be', 'told', 'beautifully', 'told', 'thanks', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'message', 'movie', 'also', 'needed', 'retelling', 'freedom', 'fragile', 'easily', 'crushed', 'powerful', 'State', 'hands', 'enemies', 'ordinary', 'people', 'stand', 'up', 'say', 'Enough', 'More', 'often', 'great', 'cost', 'individuals', 'who', 'do', 'so.Given', 'Kulturkampf', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'Christianity', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'U.S.', 'today', 'extremely', 'timely', 'story', 'enemies', 'religious', 'freedom', 'Marxist', 'Mexico', '1920', 'were', 'same', 'are', 'contemporary', 'America', 'militant', 'atheists', 'power', 'State', 'instruments', 'coercion', 'hands', 'write', 'words', 'life-long', 'agnostic', 'who', 'always', 'cherished', 'religious', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'speech', 'guaranteed', 'First', 'Amendment', 'are', 'assault', 'today', 'so-called', 'liberal', 'establishment', 'movie', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'first', 'rate', 'script', 'delivers', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'dialogue', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'excellent', 'cast', 'including', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'General', 'Enrique', 'Velarde', 'leader', 'Cristeros', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Father', 'Christopher', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Santiago', 'Cabrera', 'Catalina', 'Sandino', 'Moreno', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'Eduardo', 'Verastegui', 'Rubin', 'Blades', 'fanatic', 'atheist', 'President', 'Calles', 'especially', 'Mauricio', 'Kuri', 'who', 'young', 'martyr', 'Jose', 'Luis', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'unconvincing', 'scene', 'anywhere', 'film', 'long', 'movie', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'never', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'scene', 'story', 'impact', 'audience', 'Not', 'single', 'scene', 'irrelevant', 'insignificant', 'opening', 'episode', 'Jose', 'Luis', 'Father', 'Christopher', 'viewer', 'gripped', 'story', 'riveted', 'action', 'screen', 'personally', 'involved', 'what', 'happening', 'eyes', 'no', 'longer', 'merely', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'participant', 'unfolding', 'story.Like', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'powerful', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'man', 'capacity', 'evil', 'cruelty', 'murderous', 'consequences', 'State', 'driven', 'ideology', 'fanaticism', 'also', 'man', 'capacity', 'resistance', 'tyranny', 'self-sacrifice', 'willingness', 'defend', 'faith', 'fight', 'liberty', 'justice', 'come', 'aid', 'weak', 'helpless', 'caught', 'hands', 'powerful', 'ruthless', 'enemy.As', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'belatedly', 'come', 'recognize', 'too', 'long', 'forgotten', 'heroes', 'Cristiada', 'were', 'martyrs', 'cause', 'religious', 'liberty', 'other', 'time', 'America', 'i.e', '1940s', '1950s', 'example', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'same', 'category', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', 'Instead', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'movie', 'theaters', 'there', 'was', 'concerted', 'effort', 'Hollywood', 'leftist', 'establishment', 'denigrate', 'movie', 'obvious', 'effort', 'discourage', 'people', 'seeing', 'heartening', 'see', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'also', 'IMDB', 'now', 'movie', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A

1547664,A1MI0U8ZMG6WD0,B0087IT9UY,family-style,"[15, 15]","I just came back from watching For Greater Glory. I feel a special connection with the movie because I am a nun and my own Sisters were part of the persecution of the Church that was the Mexican Revolution. They were thrown out of their monastery, watched the federales desecrate the church... two of them were shot by a firing squad because they would not take off their Habits. They were left to die in the streets as an example of how ""religious fanatics"" should be treated. Miraculously, they survived, and my vocation is a part of their legacy.So, it was with special empathy that I watched this film. And as I came home, I wondered what I would say about it... what sort of recommendation could I make? Certainly, it was well acted and the production and direction were excellent. I found myself going through deep emotions and many tears as I watched. For any adult Catholic, I think this movie is an absolute necessity. We need to remember what the martyrs before us have suffered that we might live our faith in peace. But, I believe the relevance of this film goes far beyond the limits of the Catholic Church.  All Americans should value their freedoms and the FIRST freedom our founding fathers made efforts to insure was the freedom to worship as one chooses and to live freely in accord with one's faith.  We, who have everything come so easy to us, take too much for granted. We think nothing of gov'ts encroachment into those freedoms, either because we do not value them enough - having never lived without them - or because we think no one in our times or in our country would ever go so far as to truly threaten those freedoms.  We would rather capitulate than have people consider us ""unreasonable"". The Cristiada LOVED THEIR FAITH AND THEIR CHURCH... AND THEY CHERISHED THE FREEDOM TO LIVE THEIR FAITH! We need to re-ignite that same passion in our own lives and this film certainly inspires to that end.Yet, I must also acknowledge that this film has a great deal of violence in it. You will watch a priest executed. You will see children die. You will see battles and you will see slaughter.  The film does not dwell on gore but neither does it hide the violence. So, as I drove home, I wondered whether I should insert a caution to parents not to bring their children. Of course, you will know your own kids and can best make that decision but, I did want to make this observation. This film is about REALITY. THESE THINGS HAPPENED. I don't like violence in a movie for ""entertainment's sake"" but this film is very different. This film is not about ""entertainment"". It is an inspirational film about those who were willing to die because of their love of Christ and his Church.As I mentioned previously, we live in times where all is pretty much handed to us. Everything comes to us with relative ease. So, we barely know what it means to be willing to die for one's beliefs. It's just an abstract concept. Maybe it would be helpful for our youth to watch this film... to see what love and faith really mean and see it from the perspective of a 14-year-old boy who lived it... and died it... and who has since been canonized for it (in 2005). Maybe watching this will help us all better appreciate what we have... what the martyrs have sacrificed in order that we might have it. Maybe, hard as it is to look at reality, we need to face it and ask ourselves if our faith means enough to us. Viva Cristo Rey! May the spirit of these martyrs - and those who died in the previous persecutions in Mexico, Spain, Cuba, Russia, and now in China, and in other places around the world - may that same spirit of love breath palpably in each of us.

He decided to use a catch-22 which protected religious freedom... so long as the practitioners were not subject to other laws. He expelled ""foreign"" priests and public vestments.Mexico, being a traditional Catholic country, saw protests and demonstrations by Catholic organizations. Calles responded by force, employing Federal troops to commit extrajudicial killings. He saw the Cristeros as a threat to his statist regime and wanted it eliminated. This triggered the Cristeros War of the 1920s.The movie skillfully the individual Cristeros... by and large ordinary people who simply wanted to practice their faith. Women were an important part of the movement, smuggling weapons and ammunition and providing food.This film is excellent. I would give it six stars if I could. The acting is wonderful, especially that of Andy Garcia, who plays the role of the Cristero general Gorostieta. It has everything: political intrigue, adventure, moral underpinnings... truly a new classic. The portayal of Mexico's central government, out of control and committing atrocities in order to make the people bow to its will, is particularly disturbing.If you get this video be sure to watch the history piece ""extra feature.""

Tevington,"[154, 158]","This is an excellent film, but read no further if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....As explained by Steven Greydanus,""The 1917 Mexican Constitution included harsh anticlerical provisions that went unenforced until the regime of Plutarco El&iacute;as Calles....In 1926, Calles introduced legislation -- the 'Calles Law' -- specifying penalties for violating the constitutional prohibitions: Clergy could be imprisoned for criticizing the government, fined for wearing clerical garb in public, and so forth. Calles also moved to seize Church property, close Catholic schools, seminaries and monasteries, and deport foreign priests"" (National Catholic Register, 5/29/2012).I particularly enjoy historical films and have grown accustomed to learning that certain characters in these films can be composites or created for dramatic impact.  I guessed incorrectly with this film: ""At the center of director Dean Wright's sprawling epic stand two remarkable figures: retired but restless military hero Gen. Enrique Gorostieta (Andy Garcia), a religious skeptic who becomes the unlikely commander of those taking up arms in the name of faith, and Jose Luis Sanchez (impressive newcomer Mauricio Kuri), a saintly adolescent volunteer in Gorostieta's forces who, decades later, was beatified for his role in the struggle....Out to defy the government by peaceful means is another real-life character, also since beatified, Anacleto Gonzalez Flores (Eduardo Verastegui). A pacifist lawyer, Gonzalez is sometimes referred to as `the Mexican Gandhi'"" (John Muldering, Catholic News Service)Greydanus speaks to what will be this film's enduring relevance: ""Visiting Mexico earlier this year, Pope Benedict XVI highlighted ongoing restrictions on religious freedom in Mexico's Constitution. In the United States, the U.S. bishops have made a top priority the defense of religious freedom against encroaching federal tyranny....The magnitude of the conflict around religious freedom today is something no one could have predicted when production began on For Greater Glory. Some might call the film's timing providential"" (National Catholic Register, 5/29/2012).It was largely because of that ""providential"" connection that my wife, myself, and two friends chose to respond to a call to see ""For Greater Glory"" on its opening night. Including ourselves, it was disappointing that there could not have been more than 20 people in the theater of our suburban multiplex (Interestingly, the six middle aged men sitting behind us later confirmed that they themselves were priests.).

1547678,A329ALHKYK62O7,B0087IT9UY,Ky. Col.,"[3, 3]","""For Greater Glory"" brings to life a little known (in the United States) but inspiring if tragic story of Mexican history known as the Cristero War.  Soon after the Mexican Revolution, a repressive atheist government began to oppress the Catholic Church.  This eventually led to both peaceful protest and ultimately armed rebellion (not to mention some shadowy politics between the U.S. government and Mexico).The story itself is told through two main characters.  One is a retired Mexican general played by Andy Garcia.  Despite being an atheist most of the film, the general decides for personal reasons to take command of the Christian rebels in their fight for religious freedom.  The other primary character is a young boy named Jose (powerfully portrayed by the young Mexican actor Maruicio Kuri [Kuri has given a number of very interesting interviews telling how playing the character deepened his own faith]) who joins the rebels after his priest (played by Peter O'Toole) is executed by the federal military.  Despite their vastly different backgrounds their stories ultimately intersect towards a shared destiny illustrating the price of faith and freedom.""For Greater Glory"" was very well filmed considering its modest budget.  Its director was a leading special effects supervisor on ""The Lord of the Rings"" series.  The acting is top notch by nearly everyone involved, the cinematography is excellent (some of the best I've ever seen of the Mexican countryside), costume design is good, and the battle scenes are pretty well filmed.  The film's muscial score is excellent but that would be expected from James Horner (The Land Before Time, Glory, Braveheart, Titanic, Avatar).Note: A film spoiler is revealed below concerning a historical character.Despite all this thought, the film really struck me because of its intensity.  The film is rated R for a reason.  There are some powerful and disturbing scenes including one of the most gripping depictions of martyrdom I have seen on film when Jose is executed.  The film is inspiring but hard to watch in a few places.  This is paricularly true regarding the brief but disturbing scenes in which Jose is tortured by a police officer trying to force him to renounce Christ (the actual circumstanes of both Jose Luis Sanchez del Rio and Anacleto Flores's martyrdoms though were even more brutal than the film depicts).  Like the World War II film ""To End all Wars"" this is a film with a strongly pro-Christian message but one that graphically depicts its story.  There is no nudity and very little cursing.  Due to the intense violence I would not recommend it for children.  For mature audiences though ""For Greater Glory"" is a superb western, war film, drama, and story of religious persecution all rolled into one.  I highly recommend it.",5,"Gripping, Intense, Inspiring",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,2802,"['Greater', 'Glory', 'life', 'little', 'known', 'United', 'States', 'inspiring', 'tragic', 'story', 'Mexican', 'history', 'known', 'Cristero', 'War', 'Soon', 'Mexican', 'Revolution', 'repressive', 'atheist', 'government', 'began', 'oppress', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'eventually', 'led', 'peaceful', 'protest', 'ultimately', 'armed', 'rebellion', 'not', 'mention', 'shadowy', 'politics', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Mexico', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'One', 'retired', 'Mexican', 'general', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'being', 'atheist', 'most', 'film', 'general', 'decides', 'personal', 'reasons', 'take', 'command', 'Christian', 'rebels', 'fight', 'religious', 'freedom', 'other', 'primary', 'character', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Jose', 'powerfully', 'portrayed', 'young', 'Mexican', 'actor', 'Maruicio', 'Kuri', '[', 'Kuri', 'given', 'number', 'very', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'telling', 'how', 'playing', 'character', 'deepened', 'own', 'faith', ']', 'who', 'rebels', 'priest', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'executed', 'federal', 'military', 'vastly', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'stories', 'ultimately', 'intersect', 'towards', 'shared', 'destiny', 'illustrating', 'price', 'faith', 'freedom', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'considering', 'modest', 'budget', 'director', 'was', 'leading', 'special', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'series', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'involved', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mexican', 'countryside', 'costume', 'design', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'filmed', 'film', 'muscial', 'score', 'excellent', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'James', 'Horner', 'Land', 'Before', 'Time', 'Glory', 'Braveheart', 'Titanic', 'Avatar', '.Note', 'film', 'spoiler', 'revealed', 'concerning', 'historical', 'character.Despite', 'thought', 'film', 'really', 'struck', 'intensity', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'reason', 'are', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'depictions', 'martyrdom', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'Jose', 'executed', 'film', 'inspiring', 'hard', 'watch', 'few', 'places', 'paricularly', 'true', 'regarding', 'brief', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'Jose', 'tortured', 'police', 'officer', 'trying', 'force', 'renounce', 'Christ', 'actual', 'circumstanes', 'Jose', 'Luis', 'Sanchez', 'del', 'Rio', 'Anacleto', 'Flores', 'martyrdoms', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'brutal', 'film', 'depicts', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'End', 'Wars', 'film', 'strongly', 'pro-Christian', 'message', 'one', 'graphically', 'story', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'cursing', 'Due', 'intense', 'violence', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'children', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'superb', 'western', 'war', 'film', 'drama', 'story', 'religious', 'persecution', 'rolled', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1547685,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,B0087IT9UY,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[30, 31]","This movie succeeds in pulling off what few epic films do: it tells a compelling story, filled with multi-dimensional characters, and it addresses questions about the human condition that go far beyond the actual events in the film.The Cristeros movement is little-known outside of Mexico, unless you count the Knights of Columbus and the Vatican, both of which advocated for the Mexican people. Actually, it's an unfamiliar story to many Mexicans, too, who were never exposed to this chapter of history in school. Laws limiting religious freedom have only recently been officially repealed, and acknowledging the Cristeros' campaign to preserve the right to worship was embarrassing for the Mexican governments.Mexican culture has always been deeply Roman Catholic, and when the government decided to enact laws in the 1920's to wipe out the Church, the population resisted: passively at first, but later with an armed rebellion. The Cristeros attracted a huge following from every walk of life: men, women and children; millionaires, professionals, priests, peasants, ranch hands, former bandits, and at least one military genius (General Gorostieta, played by Andy Garcia). The Mexican government, and its army and secret police, used every means at its disposal to intimidate the faithful into giving up their religion, and when intimidation didn't work, they moved on to arrests, tortures and executions. Thousands of corpses swung from telegraph poles as a message to the Cristeros to stand down. These efforts only gave the Cristeros more grassroots support. (A number of the Cristeros have since been beatified, the last step before their offical canonization as saints.)Gorostieta is famous not only for his leadership, but for his willingness to work for religious freedom even though he was a self-professed atheist, although he died a Catholic. The movie is as much about his personal faith journey as it is about the Cristeros as a brotherhood.My parents (in their 80's) and I went to see this movie yesterday, and we had very high expectations for the film. The producers did not fail us. My parents remarked about how little they knew of the Cristeros, although Mexico is right next door to the U.S. and my parents were children at the time the events took place.The script stays true to actual events, except for details here and there which, if they'd been included, would have added several hours to the movie (as it is, it clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours). I can't cite any examples without involving plot spoilers, so I can only recommend reading more about the Cristeros after you've seen the film. (The movie should whet your appetite for learning more about them.) The producers did include, helpfully, scrolled copy that put the events in context, and there's also some follow-up information about the characers in the closing credits.There are atrocities committed on both sides--some of the Cristeros, though devoted to the Virgin of Guadalupe, are violent indivduals-- and the Cristeros themselves struggle with whether physical force should ever be used against force, and whether the ends justify the means.The movie is, as everyone says, ""epic,"" and if you like John Ford (I do) that's great. When you do see this( and if you're lucky it will be while it's still in theaters), try to see it on a large-screen TV.The issue of religious freedom is as timely today as it was in the 1920's. Currently, organized religion is repressed, even outlawed, in several countries. Religious expression is forbidden in states that call themselves atheist, and in some countries only the ""official"" religion is tolerated: what's left of Christian and Jewish communities are under extreme duress in many parts of the Muslim world, such as Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, Saudi, Yemen...well, the list goes on.The recent HHS mandate, and then ""compromise"", by the current administration to pressure Catholic institutions into violating moral law is also a case in point....except instead of murdering priests and bishops, there's a campaign to discredit everything they have to say.""For Greater Glory"" reminds us that these pressures to forfeit the Faith have always existed, but there have always been people courageous enough to resist, and in the end, they've always prevailed. (You can ask Emperor Nero about that.)A few viewers, including critic Roger Ebert, have mentioned that martyrdom seems a primitive and simplistic expression of faith, but martyrdom has always been a component of Catholicism. Sometimes you have to stand up for what's right, even under the threat of death. That may seem foreign to a person who was raised in the era of compromise and relativism, but that doesn't make it less true. I think we will see far more martyrs in the coming century.[Ebert also called this movie ""Too Catholic,"" which I guess would make ""Schindler's List"" too Jewish and ""Witness"" too Amish. Or saying that ""Titanic"" was good, but why did all of it have to take place on the water? Sheesh, Roger. Is this a movie about the Catholic Church? Undoubtedly, but it is also about so much more. Anyone interested in the role of government in controlling religion, or the right of people to practice whatever faith they embrace, can relate to this film. And it's not a bad thing to learn more about Mexican history; we in the U.S. know more about Nazi Germany than we do about our neighbors south of the border.}As other reviewers have noted, the theater was practically empty. True, it was an early-afternoon weekday showing, but we also live in an area that has a large Catholic demographic. The poor attendance, plus the virtual media silence about this movie, would seem to suggest that it's not worth seeing. Some reviewers have panned this movie, and although it may not appeal to everyone, some of the attacks are gratuitous and make me wonder about the motivations of the writers. But in Mexico, at least during opening week, ""For Greater Glory"" has already found a huge audience.See this movie, tell your friends, and take its message to heart.(I do have a question for anyone out there who knows a little more about this movie than I do: Was the footage during the closing credits actually of Father Pro? If you know, please post a response.)",5,Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.....,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,6279,"['movie', 'pulling', 'off', 'what', 'few', 'epic', 'films', 'do', 'compelling',

1547686,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B0087IT9UY,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[3, 3]","Thinking about all the movies I saw in 2012 - one or two per week - For Greater Glory is my absolute favorite.The movie is bases on actual event that took place during the Mexico's Cristero War (1926-1929) when the Mexican government began persecuting the Catholic Church, its clergy and its followers. The government of Plutarco Calles created a system where large numbers of Catholic priests were deported. Those that remained were subject to penalties for wearing clerical garb outiside the church and other limitations. A priest found guilty of criticizing the government faced 5 years in prison. In response to this, the Catholic faithfull - mostly peasents and cowboys -rebelled. More than 100,000 joined the peseant army, making it 6 to 10 times larger than the forces under Zapata or Pancho Villa.For Greater Glory condenses years of Mexican history into about 148 minutes of screentime. It mixes real life events of real life people with dramatic structure to do so. So some characters represent actual people, while others represent an amalgamation of multiple revolutionaries. So you can't say that For Greater Glory is a perfect history of the Christero War, but it is far closer to actual events than most movies that claim to be ""based on actual events."" Some of the people depicted in the movie were made saints by the Catholic Church for their willingness to accept death and torture rather than denounce their church.This movie is truly a big screen masterpiece. If you ever get the chance, see it in a theater. If not, see it on the biggest TV screen you can find. The cinematography is simply to grand, to beautiful, to awe inspiring to be seen on a computer screen or i-Pod. Andy Garcia gives his usual masterful performance as Enrique Gorostieta Revolutionary War general turned businessman who takes up the Cristero cause - first for pay - later as a true believer in simple human rights. Peter O'Toole, Eva Longoria and many of (I am told) Mexico's biggest stars round out the cast of this movie. The acting is amazing.A brief warning though, the style of this movie will be unfamiliar to those who've never turned on Turner Classic Movies, but quite accessible to anyone who's watched Ben Hur, The Robe, The Ten Commandments or The Greatest Story Ever Told. This is a movie about real people who went to war to protect their religious liberty, and they don't talk about those liberties in vague new-age sounding generalities. The characters in the movie talk about God and talk about Jesus as tangible parts of their life. The way characters in movies from the 40s or 50s might have, but unlike anything that's been on screen in the last 30 years. That's one of the things that actually make this movie far more realistic than most ""based on actual events"" movies.I'm lucky enough to have seen this movie on the big screen, but I will be giving copies to others as gifts.",5,A Truly Grand Movie,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2895,"['Thinking', 'movies', 'saw', '2012', 'one', 'two', 'week', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'absolute', 'favorite.The', 'movie', 'bases', 'actual', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'Mexico', 'Cristero', 'War', '1926-1929', 'when', 'Mexican', 'government', 'began', 'persecuting', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'clergy', 'followers', 'government', 'Plutarco', 'Calles', 'created', 'system', 'where', 'large', 'numbers', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'were', 'deported', 'remained', 'were', 'subject', 'penalties', 'wearing', 'clerical', 'garb', 'church', 'other', 'limitations', 'priest', 'found', 'guilty', 'criticizing', 'government', 'faced', '5', 'years', 'prison', 'response', 'Catholic', 'faithfull', 'mostly', 'peasents', 'cowboys', '-rebelled', 'More', '100,000', 'joined', 'peseant', 'army', 'making', '6', '10', 'times', 'larger', 'forces', 'Zapata', 'Pancho', 'Villa.For', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'years', 'Mexican', 'history', '148', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'mixes', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'do', 'so', 'characters', 'represent', 'actual', 'people', 'others', 'represent', 'amalgamation', 'multiple', 'revolutionaries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'perfect', 'history', 'Christero', 'War', 'far', 'closer', 'actual', 'events', 'most', 'movies', 'claim', 'be', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'people', 'depicted', 'movie', 'were', 'made', 'saints', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'willingness', 'accept', 'death', 'torture', 'rather', 'denounce', 'church.This', 'movie', 'truly', 'big', 'screen', 'masterpiece', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'theater', 'not', 'see', 'biggest', 'TV', 'screen', 'can', 'find', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'grand', 'beautiful', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'be', 'seen', 'computer', 'screen', 'i-Pod', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'usual', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Enrique', 'Gorostieta', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'general', 'turned', 'businessman', 'who', 'up', 'Cristero', 'cause', 'first', 'pay', 'later', 'true', 'believer', 'simple', 'human', 'rights', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'many', 'am', 'told', 'Mexico', 'biggest', 'stars', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'movie', 'acting', 'amazing.A', 'brief', 'warning', 'style', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'turned', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'quite', 'accessible', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Robe', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'war', 'protect', 'religious', 'liberty', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'liberties', 'vague', 'new-age', 'sounding', 'generalities', 'characters', 'movie', 'talk', 'God', 'talk', 'about', 'Jesus', 'tangible', 'parts', 'life', 'way', 'characters', 'movies', '40s', '50s', 'might', 'have', 'anything', 'been', 'screen', 'last', '30', 'years', 'one', 'things', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'most', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'movies.I', ""'m"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'will', 'be', 'giving', 'copies', 'others', 'gifts']",N/A

1547692,A3DU4UO1O84LW8,B0087IT9UY,Ricardo,"[2, 2]","The Bible teaches us that we must be willing to sacrifice all we have for the greater glory of God.  Jesus taught this meant that we should be willing to give up all our worldly possessions and if someone should strike you, it is better to turn the other cheek, but the Catholic Church has taught us that armed struggle is allowable as a last resort in the case of prolonged tyranny.  At the end of the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the Mexican Government attempted to silence the opposition of the Catholic Church by confiscating their property and exiling all priests from Mexico.  The people and the Catholic Church answered with the Cristero Rebellion, For Greater Glory is a very well made movie that explores the Cristero Rebellion in Mexico between 1926 and 1929. The Rebellion is a little known chapter in Mexican history and is even lesser known in the United States.  A growing Latino and Catholic population makes Greater Glory a timely and important movie.  The photography and the story line of For Greater Glory are excellent. The movie concentrates on the causes and history of the rebellion and the actions of General Gorostieta who was hired by the Catholic Church to lead the rebellion.  The question of weather a true Christian should fight the government with non-violence or with an armed rebellion is brought up throughout the movie.  This theme is also explored in two other well made movies, Padre Pro and There Be Dragons (both excellent movies worth comparing to Greater Glory).In the movie the principal cause of the Rebellion is a socialist Mexican government that wants to end the dominance of the Catholic Church in Mexican culture and customs.  The socialist government, in the form of President Calles (brilliantly played by Rubin Blades), sees the Church as reactionary and holding back the growth and modernization of Mexico.  He wants to destroy the Mexican Church by force; the physical destruction of Churches, the expulsion of foreign priests, and the torture and execution of anyone who refuses to stop their religious practices (public or private).  Greater Glory mostly follows the General of the armed rebellion (played by Andy Garcia).  The movie ends with the Mexican government and the Roman Catholic bishops reaching an agreement to stop funding the rebellion in exchange for a non enforcement of the Calles laws forbidding the public practice of religion.The Cristero Rebellion is a complex subject, in order to understand the Rebellion and the movie For Greater Glory one needs to understand the history of the Catholic Church in Mexico.  Most of us know that the church worked hand in hand with the conquistadors who vanquished the native Mexican population in the 16th and 17th centuries and replaced their culture and religion with their own European culture and religion.  In exchange for their support and legitimacy the Church was given large tracts of land and the local control of civic affairs in villages and small towns.  The Church in Mexico realized that to win over the Native population they had to encompass many of the Mexican customs into the Catholic Church.  This included the Church acting as a protector of the Natives and their property rights.  A few clerical leaders interpreted this to mean that they had a duty to put the welfare of the Native Americans over that of the European Church leaders, a form of Liberation Theology.  The first revolution against Spanish Rule in 1810 was led by local Mexican priests (Father Hidalgo and others) and liberals but condemned by the Roman Catholic Bishops; their opposition was due to the fact that the revolution's goals included the redistribution of foreign owned lands to include Church property, and removing the Church from education and other civil functions.  This explains why the Church opposed the Revolution of 1910 and supported the Cristero Rebellion in 1926.  The Cristeros were successful at first due to the support of the Catholic Church with arms, ammunition, and money.  Once the government saw that they could not defeat the Church and the Cristeros, they then began to negotiate a peace with the Bishops allowing the Catholic Church to continue their spiritual work by not enforcing the laws against religion; in exchange Bishops withdrew their support of the Cristeros.

It is interesting to note that all the major networks, NBC, ABC, and CBS, were silent in reviewing this film from the films coming out on June 1st.  Perhaps they felt it would be wrong to show the people of Mexico in a good light.  Perhaps the attack on the Catholic religion is, at this time, too close to home.  The story of the fight to stop people of faith, by a government without faith, not only restores one's beliefs but shows to what extent people will go to to defend their beliefs.  Several of my Mexican relatives had no idea of what had happened under the evil rule of Calles.  They have been in United States too long and forgotten their Mexican roots.

As the otherwise irreligious general [played by Andy Garcia] in this film recognized, a loss of religious freedom equates with a loss of all freedom.  Compromise with evil is not an option.This is a film about courageous people standing up against leftist ideologues who, of course, are standing up for their 'freedom' to dictate to others.

As the Catholic Church is pushed out of power, the people take actions against the government. Things escalate to the point there is an all out rebellion.The film focuses on the somewhat secular general (Andy Garcia) who is recruited to lead a rebellion against his government. His religious wife (Eva Longoria) is at first, less enthusiastic. The film adds a young martyr to the mix to bring out emotion. The movie also looks at the US involvement in brokering a peace for the sake of US oil companies who fear nationalization of the oil fields as they feel Mexico is trying to ""steal THEIR oil.""It is nice to see a faith based film draw some decent names. The acting was better than the script which made the characters stiff. We have seen these same people do better in different roles. The director, Dean Wright used the technique of moving the camera to create a sense of urgency and excitement. The problem was he overused the technique and incorporated it into simple scenes of conversation. The unnecessary rocking motion of the camera truly became annoying as motion sickness set in.The Mexicans in this film all speak English with a Mexican accent and carry signs in Spanish. Not being a religious person, I found the film interesting from an historical sense and also in a modern political context as the Catholic Church feels it is once again under attack.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1547700,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0087IT9UY,zeus,"[4, 4]","Peter O'Toole's greatest line in this magnificent movie represents humanity and the reason that many wars were fought. Not the revisionist history that our kids are taught in today's classes in high schools and Universities (public and private unfortunately). For example, a French historian (Jean Meyer) describes the Cristero revolution as peasants who tried to resist the heavy pressures of the rich. Typical, they (the liberals pseudo intellectuals) want to rewrite history and transform a real revolt against tyranny and oppression of religious freedom into some kind of communist revolution nonsense.This is a great movie that keeps very close to the real events that happened just next door in Mexico between 1926 and 1929. This Mexican Revolution was the largest rebellion in Mexican history. I will not describe in detail the plot here since many people have already done it and everybody who is going to see this movie knows the story. Briefly, between 1922-1924 the Mexican government effectively applied the secularist laws coming from the constitution put in place in 1919 by Alvaro Obregon. The people didn't like the religious restrictions and started disobeying the rules. The rebels called themselves Cristeros, according to the name of Jesus Christ, ""Cristo Rey"" or Christ the King. This is very well depicted in the film by Andy Garcia who starts the revolution not because he is religious but to help the peasants gain the freedom of religion, and ends up confessing by the end of the movie. The rebellion is also known for the women who assisted the rebels in smuggling ammunition in their clothing. The Catholic Church has recognized several priests who were tortured and murdered in public in the Cristero rebellion as martyrs.The acting is fabulous and unlike the classic war movies, here, the cavalry, the good guys, always arrives late, too late to save the innocent. Jose steals most of the movie as the little kid who is transformed within few months into an adult and great defender of Christianity. Andy Garcia's performance is quite remarkable.This is a historic film that must be seen by all Christians in order to realize how lucky we are to live in this great country were freedom of religion is taken for granted. Everybody needs to be vigilant. It is important to know that even today there are restrictions for Catholics in Mexico. Those restrictions of religion are in the constitution.Five stars all around.",5,Who are you if you don't stand up for what you believe?,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,2446,"['Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'greatest', 'line', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'humanity', 'reason', 'many', 'wars', 'were', 'fought', 'Not', 'revisionist', 'history', 'kids', 'are', 'taught', 'today', 'classes', 'high', 'schools', 'Universities', 'public', 'private', 'unfortunately', 'example', 'French', 'historian', 'Jean', 'Meyer', 'Cristero', 'revolution', 'peasants', 'who', 'tried', 'resist', 'heavy', 'pressures', 'rich', 'Typical', 'liberals', 'pseudo', 'intellectuals', 'want', 'rewrite', 'history', 'transform', 'real', 'revolt', 'tyranny', 'oppression', 'religious', 'freedom', 'kind', 'communist', 'revolution', 'nonsense.This', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'close', 'real', 'events', 'happened', 'just', 'next', 'door', 'Mexico', '1926', '1929', 'Mexican', 'Revolution', 'was', 'largest', 'rebellion', 'Mexican', 'history', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'detail', 'plot', 'here', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'everybody', 'who', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'story', 'Briefly', '1922-1924', 'Mexican', 'government', 'effectively', 'applied', 'secularist', 'laws', 'coming', 'constitution', 'put', 'place', '1919', 'Alvaro', 'Obregon', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'religious', 'restrictions', 'started', 'disobeying', 'rules', 'rebels', 'called', 'Cristeros', 'according', 'name', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Cristo', 'Rey', 'Christ', 'King', 'very', 'well', 'depicted', 'film', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'revolution', 'not', 'religious', 'help', 'peasants', 'gain', 'freedom', 'religion', 'up', 'confessing', 'end', 'movie', 'rebellion', 'also', 'known', 'women', 'who', 'assisted', 'rebels', 'smuggling', 'ammunition', 'clothing', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'recognized', 'several', 'priests', 'who', 'were', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'public', 'Cristero', 'rebellion', 'martyrs.The', 'acting', 'fabulous', 'classic', 'war', 'movies', 'here', 'cavalry', 'good', 'guys', 'always', 'late', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'innocent', 'Jose', 'most', 'movie', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'transformed', 'few', 'months', 'adult', 'great', 'defender', 'Christianity', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'performance', 'quite', 'remarkable.This', 'historic', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'Christians', 'order', 'realize', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'live', 'great', 'country', 'were', 'freedom', 'religion', 'taken', 'granted', 'Everybody', 'be', 'vigilant', 'important', 'know', 'even', 'today', 'are', 'restrictions', 'Catholics', 'Mexico', 'restrictions', 'religion', 'are', 'constitution.Five', 'stars', 'around']",N/A
