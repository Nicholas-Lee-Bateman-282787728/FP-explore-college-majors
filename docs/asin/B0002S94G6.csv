I see all new film when they come out on DVD (and dhown on a big screen TV)..I have no memory of the theatrical release of this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I DID expect a good performance from William H. Macy.  I don't know why this incredible actor isn't a major star, but always shines in supporting roles, like this one, playing the Chief of the Boat who has to fill in for his wounded captain.  The problem here is a weak script and lackluster direction.  No true sence of tension was ever developed.  This is just a standard, WWII sub movie.  In fact, they did them better DURING WWII.  Footage was also purchased from the movie U-571, which is a dead giveaway that this movie was done on the cheap.The DVD transfer is very good; good picture and excellent sound.  Both help a little in keeping your attention.  It's a good rental, but I wouldn't want to own a copy.

844605,A1D9QPL9VZUG2Q,B0002S94G6,Chris Davis,"[2, 2]","Synopsis: Starring William H. Macy, Til Schweiger, Scott Caan and Lauren Holly, among other notable actors, this movie is set during World War II when Hitler's Germany was turning out U-boats by the tens of thousands. The Americans and the British had one goal: to put the innumerable U-boats out of commission. Aboard an American submarine, disease breaks out and then the boat is destroyed by a German sub. Going against protocol, the German captain takes the surviving Americans on board. Disease and sub damage force the Americans and the Germans into an unlikely alliance, and no one knows whether they'll make it out alive - or whose side will kill them all first.This was a very different role than I'd seen Scott Caan in to date. For one, this wasn't an indie film, and after watching so many of those (mostly his) as well as a lifetime of watching studio pictures, I've gotten so I can tell the difference now just by sitting through a minute or two.This was a kick-ass movie.Mr. Caan plays a Naval officer commanding a U.S. sub during World War II. It turns out one of his men has meningitis, and he contracts it. Then his sub, the Swordfish, comes under enemy attack and is destroyed. Only a handful of his men survive, but the captain's fading fast, dying from the disease.I have to admit, I had a tough time believing someone so young would be in command of a sub during wartime with the first scene where Mr. C.'s wearing the dress whites. However, once we were on-board the sub with him, it really worked. It was like he came alive on that set, and between his and William H. Macy's performance as the Chief of Boat...along with the rest of the cast...I was hooked.Full of action, full of the critical human elements that make you care about both sides no matter which side you might have supported had you been alive back then, the movie delivers in a serious way.**SPOILER ALERT**I have to admit that I heaved a long-suffering sigh when I realized Mr. Caan's character was going to die. I thought, Does he die in, like, every movie he's in? Well, no, he doesn't. But someone significant always seems to in the ones I've seen! However, I was pleasantly surprised by the manner in which he did eventually go, because at least it was a heroic death!There was a great line delivered by the captain of the German U429: ""To save a life instead of taking it away, that's power."" I liked that.Because my focus is to talk about how the movies made me feel...what my gut-reaction to them is rather than sounding like a professional movie critic (which I will never be), I have to say the movie at times made me teary, at times got my adrenaline going and at times left me breathless.It was quite refreshing to see Mr. Caan in a role like this, and amused me a little to think that here, years later (this movie came out in '04), he's now on a show where it's the other guy who dons the dress whites and is in the Navy.Some other points of interest for me were other members of the cast whom I recognized from other TV shows such as Lauren Holly from NCIS, A.J. Buckley and Carmine Giovinazzo from ""CSI: NY"" and Jeremy Sisto from ""Law & Order."" This film was filled with a who's who of television actors.I highly recommend this if you like action, war movies, subs or just the actors involved. It is a damn fine movie.Oh, and guess what? An actor by the name of Ian Somerhalder is in this movie, too, for you fans of ""The Vampire Diaries.""",5,A Different Role for Scott Caan,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,3445,"['Synopsis', 'Starring', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'other', 'notable', 'actors', 'movie', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'was', 'turning', 'out', 'U-boats', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Americans', 'British', 'had', 'one', 'goal', 'put', 'innumerable', 'U-boats', 'commission', 'American', 'submarine', 'disease', 'breaks', 'out', 'then', 'boat', 'destroyed', 'German', 'sub', 'Going', 'protocol', 'German', 'captain', 'surviving', 'Americans', 'board', 'Disease', 'sub', 'damage', 'force', 'Americans', 'Germans', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'one', ""'ll"", 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'side', 'will', 'kill', 'first.This', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'role', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'date', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'indie', 'film', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'mostly', 'as', 'well', 'lifetime', 'watching', 'studio', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'now', 'just', 'sitting', 'minute', 'two.This', 'was', 'kick-ass', 'movie.Mr', 'Caan', 'Naval', 'officer', 'commanding', 'U.S.', 'sub', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'out', 'one', 'men', 'meningitis', 'contracts', 'Then', 'sub', 'Swordfish', 'enemy', 'attack', 'destroyed', 'Only', 'handful', 'men', 'survive', 'captain', 'fading', 'fast', 'dying', 'disease.I', 'have', 'admit', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'believing', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'would', 'be', 'command', 'sub', 'wartime', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'Mr.', 'C.', 'wearing', 'dress', 'whites', 'However', 'once', 'were', 'on-board', 'sub', 'really', 'worked', 'was', 'came', 'alive', 'set', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'performance', 'Chief', 'Boat', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'hooked.Full', 'action', 'full', 'critical', 'human', 'elements', 'make', 'care', 'sides', 'matter', 'side', 'might', 'have', 'supported', 'had', 'been', 'alive', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'delivers', 'serious', 'way', 'ALERT**I', 'have', 'admit', 'heaved', 'long-suffering', 'sigh', 'when', 'realized', 'Mr.', 'Caan', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'thought', 'Does', 'die', 'movie', 'Well', ""n't"", 'someone', 'significant', 'always', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'manner', 'did', 'eventually', 'go', 'because', 'least', 'was', 'heroic', 'death', 'was', 'great', 'line', 'delivered', 'captain', 'German', 'U429', 'save', 'life', 'instead', 'taking', 'away', 'power', 'liked', 'focus', 'talk', 'how', 'movies', 'made', 'feel', 'what', 'gut-reaction', 'rather', 'sounding', 'professional', 'movie', 'critic', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'times', 'made', 'teary', 'times', 'got', 'adrenaline', 'going', 'times', 'left', 'breathless.It', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Caan', 'role', 'amused', 'little', 'think', 'here', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'came', 'out', ""'04"", 'now', 'show', 'where', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'dress', 'whites', 'Navy.Some', 'other', 'points', 'interest', 'were', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'whom', 'recognized', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'NCIS', 'A.J', 'Buckley', 'Carmine', 'Giovinazzo', 'CSI', 'NY', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Law', 'Order', 'film', 'was', 'filled', 'who', 'who', 'television', 'actors.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'like', 'action', 'war', 'movies', 'subs', 'just', 'actors', 'involved', 'damn', 'fine', 'movie.Oh', 'guess', 'what', 'actor', 'name', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'movie', 'too', 'fans', 'Vampire', 'Diaries']",In Enemy Hands

844609,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0002S94G6,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 3]","In Enemy Hands is a strange movie. It's a film about an outbreak of Meningitis on an American sub in WW2, followed by a battle with a German sub in which infected US survivors are taken on board as prisoners, and the infection spreads to the German crew members. As more and more people drop, the remaining Germans and Americans must try to work together as they find themselves caught between a U.S. destroyer and another German sub.The film stars William Macy and Scott Caan with Til Schweiger, Clark Gregg, Jeremy Sisto, Lauren Holly, Xander Berkeley, and Carmine Giovinazzo.William Macy made a career out of small character roles from 1978 to 1996 when his appearance in ""Fargo"" earned him nominations for virtually every award out there. Subsequently he earned a fist full of Emmy and Screen Actor Guild nominations and wins. Personally I liked him best in ""The Cooler"" (2003).Scott Caan (1976) is best known for his recurring roles as Dano in ""Hawaii Five-O"" (2010) and Scott Lavin in ""Entourage"" (2009-10). He's the son of James CaanTil Schweiger (1963) has been in more than 50 films, mostly foreign language. He played Sgt. Stiglitz in ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009) and Cynric in ""King Arthur"" (2004).Clark Gregg (1962) is best known for his recurring roles as the ex-husband in ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" (2006-10) and Agent Michael Casper in ""The West Wing"" (2001-4). He's married to Jennifer Grey.Jeremy Sisto (1974) is best known for his recurring roles as Detective Lupo in ""Law and Order"" (2007-10) and Billy Chenowith in ""Six Feet Under"" (2001-5).Xander Berkeley (1955) has been in nearly 200 films and TV programs. He's best known for his continuing roles as the evil Percy in ""Nikita"" (2010), Sheriff Atwater in ""CSI"" (2003-4), and George Mason in ""24"" (2001-3).Carmine Giovinazzo (1973) is best known for his continuing role as Danny Messer on ""CSI:NY"" (2004-10) and is the only actor to have been in all three CSI series.Lauren Holly (1963) is best known for her recurring roles as NCIS Director Jenny Shepherd from ""NCIS"" (2005-8) and as Maxine Stewart in ""Picket Fences"" (1992-6). She appeared in ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994) with Jim Carrey and they were married from 1996-7.Writer-Director Tony Giglio has made 5 films, none of them particularly memorable.As far as submarine movies go, nothing can beat Robert Mitchum and Curt Jergens in ""The Enemy Below"" (1957). Other notable contributions to this genre include ""U-571"" (2000), ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), ""Crimson Tide"" (1995) and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958).

I have seen half of it in English (in which Germans are speaking excellent English), and all of it dubbed in German (released in Germany, with no subtitles).  There, of course, the Americans are speaking German all too well.This film must be taken for what it is, I think.  A showcase for W.H. Macy (his acting is not superficial, nor are his interactions with his wife, whom he had to leave as Chief on the U.S.S. Swordfish).  Sure, the numbers and names of ships are all wrong. Did NO Kapit&auml;n-Leutnant serve underwater with his blue tunic on, as suggested by one reviewer?  This is a good introduction to Til Schweiger, who really is of matinee-idol stature and appearance, as Captain of one U-Boat, and the first watch officer (Thomas Kretschmann) really shows his acting talents....compeletely different in Stalingrad, The Pianist, U-571.  Perhaps Mr. Macy was not challenged by the role, and the meningitis outbreak is unbelieveable....but aren't movies unbelieveable.  Do they not require suspension of disbelief, even the best?I did not expect the Barry Lyndon of U-Boat movies.  The sets are too wide, the U.S. sub is too brightly lit...but the ""best set"" film has been done (Das Boot) and took a year to film (see the Director's Cut DVD).  Other criticisms are hollow...the flag, the seaman appearing to wear a modern German Navy tunic (I have seen them, I do not think so, but it is a brief shot.  At least no one is wearing Chuck Taylor sneakers!

Yep, just like a submarine gliding beneath the surface into your worldview, the mission of this propaganda film is to promote a ""let's just be nice"" attitude toward our ""enemies.""What ""Hunt For Red October"" tried to do with the minds of Americans toward the kind-hearted, well-meaning Russians, ""In Enemy Hands"" tries to do with our minds toward those regular-guy, would-be brothers who happened to be born in Germany in the Hitler era.  I should have seen it coming, from the early scenes of the (albeit subtitled) German dialogue.  The producers of this subversive film make every effort possible to show us that the Nazis didn't really want to be mean to us, and that they really only torpedoed a U.S. ship if it was mean to them first.  Come on guys!  Can't we just get along?  Let's all realize that if it wasn't for those nasty war-minded few, we would all be great brothers!Even the cowardly American sub-crew who were taken captive (by the kind-hearted Nazi submarine captain) had to be shown (by the makers of the film) that their fears of being mistreated by Germans were entirely misguided.Shoot, can't you see the love in the teary eyes of the Nazi captain when he chokes up over the news that his daughter's school was bombed (""with no survivors"")?  And if you get really on board with this movie, you'll realize that it was us mean Americans who did all of the bad things in the WW2!Oh, and by the way, no, WW2 was not ""over"" in 1943 as the actors claimed throughout.  Lemme see, I seem to remember a couple of bombs going off in August of 1945 on Japan.As for the casting, I guess that for the ""hero"" in this anti-military media effort, they had to find an actor who is best at being a wimpy bit-player.  William C. Macy sticks out in my mind as the dorky principal in Mr. Holland's Opus, the annoying bean-counter in A Civil Action, the insecure worry-wart dad-of-a-loser in Searching For Bobby Fischer, and the only forgetable character in John Grisham's The Client.Why did the writers choose the disease of meningitis?  Along with the not-so-subtle title message of being in the loving hands of the Nazis, I think they chose this disease because it sounds like ""men in crisis.""  And of course, the crisis is having to admit that we have thought of Nazis in such undeservedly ugly ways.And if I may ask one more question; why make this film in 2004?  My guess is that ""In Enemy Hands"" is really aimed at our present-day mean view of those kind-hearted, well-meaning Muslims around the world who only blow themselves up around dissenting men, women and children because Americans have been so mean and unkind to them first.This film deserves a full depth charge.",1,"4-star for quality production, but . . .",1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,2750,"['blame', 'not', 'taking', 'clue', 'title', 'Enemy', 'Hands', 'Yep', 'just', 'submarine', 'gliding', 'surface', 'worldview', 'mission', 'propaganda', 'film', 'promote', 'let', 'just', 'be', 'nice', 'attitude', 'enemies', 'What', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'tried', 'do', 'minds', 'Americans', 'kind-hearted', 'well-meaning', 'Russians', 'Enemy', 'Hands', 'tries', 'do', 'minds', 'regular-guy', 'would-be', 'brothers', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'born', 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'era', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'early', 'scenes', 'subtitled', 'German', 'dialogue', 'producers', 'subversive', 'film', 'make', 'effort', 'possible', 'show', 'Nazis', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'mean', 'really', 'only', 'torpedoed', 'U.S.', 'ship', 'was', 'mean', 'first', 'Come', 'guys', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'along', 'Let', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'nasty', 'war-minded', 'few', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'great', 'brothers', 'Even', 'cowardly', 'American', 'sub-crew', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'captive', 'kind-hearted', 'Nazi', 'submarine', 'captain', 'had', 'be', 'shown', 'makers', 'film', 'fears', 'being', 'mistreated', 'Germans', 'were', 'entirely', 'misguided.Shoot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'love', 'teary', 'eyes', 'Nazi', 'captain', 'when', 'up', 'news', 'daughter', 'school', 'was', 'bombed', 'survivors', 'get', 'really', 'board', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'was', 'mean', 'Americans', 'who', 'did', 'bad', 'things', 'WW2', 'Oh', 'way', 'WW2', 'was', 'not', '1943', 'actors', 'claimed', 'Lem', 'see', 'seem', 'remember', 'couple', 'bombs', 'going', 'off', 'August', '1945', 'Japan.As', 'casting', 'guess', 'hero', 'anti-military', 'media', 'effort', 'had', 'find', 'actor', 'who', 'best', 'being', 'wimpy', 'bit-player', 'William', 'C.', 'Macy', 'out', 'mind', 'dorky', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'annoying', 'bean-counter', 'A', 'Civil', 'Action', 'insecure', 'worry-wart', 'dad-of-a-loser', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'only', 'forgetable', 'character', 'John', 'Grisham', 'Client.Why', 'did', 'writers', 'choose', 'disease', 'meningitis', 'not-so-subtle', 'title', 'message', 'being', 'loving', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'think', 'chose', 'disease', 'men', 'crisis', 'course', 'crisis', 'having', 'admit', 'have', 'thought', 'Nazis', 'such', 'undeservedly', 'ugly', 'ways.And', 'may', 'ask', 'one', 'more', 'question', 'why', 'make', 'film', '2004', 'guess', 'Enemy', 'Hands', 'really', 'aimed', 'present-day', 'mean', 'view', 'kind-hearted', 'well-meaning', 'Muslims', 'world', 'who', 'only', 'blow', 'up', 'dissenting', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'mean', 'unkind', 'first.This', 'film', 'full', 'depth', 'charge']",In Enemy Hands

William Macy gives us a credible role as the COB (Chief of the Boat) on an American submarine during WWII. The COB is the highest ranking enlisted man and is typically the voice of reason, controlling young brash officers, such as the captain of this boat. We contrast his ""driver: style to that of the likable easy going U-Boat captain. The action takes place off the coast of the US in 1943 as U-Boats are sinking US ships. In this case, the American and German sub meet, and exchange torpedoes. The German sub is destroyed and American is damaged and sinking. During the attack the XO dies from meningitis, which he was nice enough to have shared with the captain. As fate would have it, there was a second U-boat in the area and the remaining American crew are picked up and held prisoner. The meningitis spreads and 2/3's of the German crew die. The German supply boat never shows up.The captain of the U-Boat decides he needs to use the Americans to survive. His plan is to work together and head for the US shore and surrender as their only hope to survive. Macy, who by now is the American leader, and really wants to see his wife again, agrees to the Germans and Americans working together. The crew develops respect for each other, except for a hand full of Tea Party followers, filled with hate from listening to Hitler and Glenn Beck decide otherwise. (Okay, I am just kidding about Hitler.)Predictable-yes. What I liked about the movie is that in spite of the cheap scenes, they stayed fairly accurate to sub life in general.

In 1943, USS Swordfish Lt. led by Cmdr Randall Sullivan (Caan) encounters its enemy ship, German U-Boat U-429 led by Kaptain Jonas Herdt (Schweiger).The film then shows one intriguing premise -- What if the crew of the boats share the same submarine; what if they must join force to survive the situations that get more and more deadly to them?Sadly writer/director Tony Giglio fails to find the best method to develop this idea.  You know, in this case, you need lively, interesting characters to engage our attention.  Instead, Giglio assembled the used materials from other submarine films, and patched them up to cover the whole 98 minutes.  You can hear the echoes of other better films -- I don't name names -- when you see the mutiny/hostage situation, and occasional torpedo attacks.  And you also get one epidemic, too, which is too conviniently introduced.William H Macy and Thomas Kretschmann, both playing the officers under command of Caan and Schweiger respectively, are doing their best, but it is obvious that the acting is nowhere near their best.  And as to ill-used Lauren Holly (who was also ill-used in 'Down Periscope'), and Jeremy Sisto whose character is reduced to a pixel, I have nothing to say except that they deserve much better roles than these.I don't say 'In Enemy Hands' is badly done.  It just lacks originality.  The CGIs are decent, and the submarine designs are reasonable, but still it needs momentum 'Das Boot' and 'U-571' are endowed with.Though it seems that 'In Enemy Hands' went straght to video in USA, it showed up in theaters in Japan, and the Japanese version I saw was doing an admirable thing, letting Germans speak German through the film.  I like it, but that does not bring the cardboard characters to life.",2,This Is Not 'U-571': One Good Idea Ruined by Flat Direction,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2117,"['Enemy', 'Hands', 'solid', 'cast', 'including', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', ""'Fargo"", 'Scott', 'Caan', '11', 'Lauren', 'Holly', ""'Turbulance"", 'Till', 'Schweiger', ""'Driven"", 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'Pianist', '.This', 'low-budget', 'film', 'Artisan', 'others', 'two', 'WW2', 'submalines', 'crew', 'one', 'interesting', 'idea', 'core', 'make', 'good', 'use', '1943', 'USS', 'Swordfish', 'Lt.', 'led', 'Cmdr', 'Randall', 'Sullivan', 'Caan', 'enemy', 'ship', 'German', 'U-Boat', 'U-429', 'led', 'Kaptain', 'Jonas', 'Herdt', 'Schweiger', '.The', 'film', 'then', 'one', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'What', 'crew', 'boats', 'share', 'same', 'submarine', 'what', 'must', 'join', 'force', 'survive', 'situations', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'deadly', 'Sadly', 'writer/director', 'Tony', 'Giglio', 'find', 'best', 'method', 'develop', 'idea', 'know', 'case', 'need', 'lively', 'interesting', 'characters', 'engage', 'attention', 'Instead', 'Giglio', 'assembled', 'used', 'materials', 'other', 'submarine', 'films', 'patched', 'up', 'cover', 'whole', '98', 'minutes', 'can', 'hear', 'echoes', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'name', 'names', 'when', 'see', 'mutiny/hostage', 'situation', 'occasional', 'torpedo', 'attacks', 'also', 'get', 'one', 'epidemic', 'too', 'too', 'conviniently', 'introduced.William', 'H', 'Macy', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'playing', 'officers', 'command', 'Caan', 'Schweiger', 'respectively', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'obvious', 'acting', 'nowhere', 'best', 'ill-used', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'ill-used', ""'Down"", 'Periscope', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'character', 'reduced', 'pixel', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'roles', 'these.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', ""'In"", 'Enemy', 'Hands', 'badly', 'done', 'just', 'originality', 'CGIs', 'are', 'decent', 'submarine', 'designs', 'are', 'reasonable', 'still', 'momentum', 'Boot', 'U-571', 'are', 'endowed', 'Enemy', 'Hands', 'went', 'straght', 'video', 'USA', 'showed', 'up', 'theaters', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'doing', 'admirable', 'thing', 'letting', 'Germans', 'speak', 'German', 'film', 'not', 'bring', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'life']",In Enemy Hands
