692172,A3B9QH2N3S4GM3,B000062XFK,M. Cooper,"[2, 4]","The movie was basically about an old Doo Wop group's reflections of what might have been.  A couple of other themes that were integrated into the movie were the romance between a nurse and ""Vinnie"", the aging leader of the  Doo Wop group called Vinnie and the Dreamers. A second sub theme was that of a father's pain of a his daughter in the hospital in undiagnosed critical condition.  The two themes work together because one of the daughter's nurses is the gal ""Vinnie"" is interested in.  There are family squabbles throughtout, but in the end everything seems to work out.  If you like a little nostalgic Doo Woppy type songs (mostly in the background of scenes) you may like this film.  The biggest drawback for me was the  excessive use of the ""F"" word.  This could have been a good family oriented picture had it not been for that, and the over-board reactions of ""Vinnie"" at times.  For me the last scene of the picture was worth waiting for.

Bauer,"[14, 14]","...a wistful story about a middle aged man who's been burned and now it's time to get on with his life.Thirty years ago Vinnie was a teen idol and the front man for Vinnie and the Dreamers, a doo-wop group from Brooklyn.  Now, Vinnie is in his late forties and works as a bartender in Brooklyn.  His wife died years ago of cancer.  He has two sons at home, just starting to make their way in the world, but his teenage daughter is in the hospital with serious cancer.Vinnie hadn't dated a woman since his wife died.  He's very bitter over the Dreamers because he never benefited financially.  He gets together socially a few times with old group.  A reunion is planned, but  it seems they all have resentments and grudges that need to be resolved.It's a very nice portrayal of an Italian-American family in Brooklyn.  The close relationship between Vinnie, his two sons and daughter gave me a warm feeling, especially between the father and sons.One of Vinnie's sons is just breaking in as a pop musician and song writer.  His musical presence gives a nice, contemporary balance to the doo-wop.  As a musician, he is able to connect with his father, and he gently prompts him to get on with his life.  As a film about a retired doo-wop singer, I felt the vocal performances of the doo-wop could have been better.  But who knows, maybe they didn't want this to be labeled simply a , ""Doo-Wop,"" movie.  All elements in the movie were extremely well balanced.I enjoyed the Bay Ridge setting, since we used to live on the edge of Bay Ridge.  The accents, the buildings, restaurants, and the clothes were all the real Bay Ridge.  The Italian-American thing is not overdone.Some might say the movie is slow or dull, but it take a while for the story to build.  The spirit of the music keeps it from getting too heavy.  I doubt others will enjoy it as much as I did...",3,Nice family-ish movie set in Italian-American Brooklyn,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1861,"['wistful', 'story', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'burned', 'now', 'time', 'get', 'life.Thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Vinnie', 'was', 'teen', 'idol', 'front', 'man', 'Vinnie', 'Dreamers', 'doo-wop', 'group', 'Brooklyn', 'Now', 'Vinnie', 'late', 'forties', 'bartender', 'Brooklyn', 'wife', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'cancer', 'two', 'sons', 'home', 'just', 'starting', 'make', 'way', 'world', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'hospital', 'serious', 'cancer.Vinnie', 'had', ""n't"", 'dated', 'woman', 'wife', 'died', 'very', 'bitter', 'Dreamers', 'never', 'benefited', 'financially', 'together', 'socially', 'few', 'times', 'old', 'group', 'reunion', 'planned', 'have', 'resentments', 'grudges', 'need', 'be', 'resolved.It', 'very', 'nice', 'portrayal', 'Italian-American', 'family', 'Brooklyn', 'close', 'relationship', 'Vinnie', 'two', 'sons', 'daughter', 'gave', 'warm', 'feeling', 'especially', 'father', 'sons.One', 'Vinnie', 'sons', 'just', 'breaking', 'pop', 'musician', 'song', 'writer', 'musical', 'presence', 'nice', 'contemporary', 'balance', 'doo-wop', 'musician', 'able', 'connect', 'father', 'gently', 'get', 'life', 'film', 'retired', 'doo-wop', 'singer', 'felt', 'vocal', 'performances', 'doo-wop', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'who', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'labeled', 'simply', 'Doo-Wop', 'movie', 'elements', 'movie', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'balanced.I', 'enjoyed', 'Bay', 'Ridge', 'setting', 'used', 'live', 'edge', 'Bay', 'Ridge', 'accents', 'buildings', 'restaurants', 'clothes', 'were', 'real', 'Bay', 'Ridge', 'Italian-American', 'thing', 'not', 'overdone.Some', 'might', 'say', 'movie', 'slow', 'dull', 'take', 'while', 'story', 'build', 'spirit', 'music', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy', 'doubt', 'others', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Looking for an Echo

Lonely as his wife died of cancer ten years earlier he has a life that is predictable until his daughter Tina is stricken with cancer.Her role is terrific and she delivers the goods many times over.One son is an aspiring musician, the other a public servant cop. Ballerini as the musical prodigy is also splendid in his role showcasing not only music chops but is wise in the ways of being in an Italian family.Another well played scene is the budding relationship between Vinnie and his new love, the nurse Jo Anne. It shows a wonderful glimpse of what it is like to be in an older romanticsituation. Truly believable.The music however is the real star of this little gem of a movie.

692179,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000062XFK,Tsuyoshi,"[33, 34]","It is a good thing to watch a lesser known works that turn out actually better than you expected.  Now you got another one here, with Armand Assante and Daine Venora (Mrs. Michael Mann), who had been long ill-used in Hollywood blockbusters like &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and Bruno's &quot;The Jackal&quot; respectively.  But you should know that they deserve much, much better things than those, and you will understand what I mean after watching this little-seen film.&quot;Looking for an Echo&quot; (the title comes from Kenny Vance's 1996  album) is about an Itarian middle-aged man Vince (Assante) whose wife had passed away, and lives now with his son, an aspiring musician.  And Vince himself, back in the 1960s, was the leader of the hit chorus group &quot;Vinnie and the Dreamers,&quot; but is now totally retired from spotlight.  But when he meets and falls in love with a nurse Joanne (Venora), who happens to have been a huge fan of his group, he gradually feels the impulse he had long lost.  As Vince reunites with his old buddies, he knows, and we know, that his love for good-old songs are never dead.Though my summery may lead you to think that the film goes on with a big showdown in sight, the fact is different.  The story gives more stress to the budding relations between Vince and Joanne (and his son), showing how they come to love (or understand) each other.  Songs are playing a major part, but their roles are aptly subdued, with a script that cleverly avoids clithed moments.  The film unfolds very quietly, letting us into the close picture of family and friends that every viewer can relate to.  In this sense, &quot;Looking for an Echo&quot; resembles Tom Hanks film &quot;That Thing You Do&quot; with a difference that the former gives us a credible picture of former stars living the present while the latter directly leads us into the world of relations surrounding a pop-song group.The film refers to many chorus groups like &quot;The Dells&quot; and &quot;The Harptones,&quot; so if you can sing a song or two of them, you will like the sound you can hear in the film, which is vividly realized by Kenny Vance, who was the leader of &quot;Jay and The Americans.&quot;  Many say rightly that this is a homage to doo-wap songs even though, as I said, the relations between characters come to the forefront in the story.  But it is also true that its moody soundtrack does justice to the film's title and your expectation based on that.Finally, though the film looks as a whole slightly light-weight, it gives a rare occasion for American film to introduce the love between man and woman aged more than 40.  This is a bit surprise because the film succeeds in that place too, especially when you see Diane Venora clad in fancy dress.  And I wonder why she has to be wasted in a pointless Hollywood remake, doing a very thankless role while she can enliven the screen single-handedly as is shown here.",4,This Magic Moment for Assante and Venora; Oldies But Goodies,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,2930,"['good', 'thing', 'watch', 'lesser', 'known', 'works', 'turn', 'out', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'Now', 'got', 'one', 'here', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Daine', 'Venora', 'Mrs.', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'ill-used', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'quot', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'quot', 'Bruno', 'quot', 'Jackal', 'quot', 'respectively', 'should', 'know', 'deserve', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'things', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'watching', 'little-seen', 'film.', 'quot', 'Looking', 'Echo', 'quot', 'title', 'Kenny', 'Vance', '1996', 'album', 'Itarian', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'Vince', 'Assante', 'wife', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'lives', 'now', 'son', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'Vince', 'back', '1960s', 'was', 'leader', 'hit', 'chorus', 'group', 'quot', 'Vinnie', 'Dreamers', 'quot', 'now', 'totally', 'retired', 'spotlight', 'when', 'love', 'nurse', 'Joanne', 'Venora', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'group', 'gradually', 'impulse', 'had', 'long', 'lost', 'Vince', 'old', 'buddies', 'know', 'love', 'good-old', 'songs', 'are', 'never', 'summery', 'may', 'lead', 'think', 'film', 'big', 'showdown', 'sight', 'fact', 'different', 'story', 'more', 'stress', 'budding', 'relations', 'Vince', 'Joanne', 'son', 'showing', 'how', 'come', 'love', 'understand', 'other', 'Songs', 'are', 'playing', 'major', 'part', 'roles', 'are', 'aptly', 'subdued', 'script', 'cleverly', 'avoids', 'clithed', 'moments', 'film', 'unfolds', 'very', 'quietly', 'letting', 'close', 'picture', 'family', 'friends', 'viewer', 'can', 'relate', 'sense', 'quot', 'Looking', 'Echo', 'quot', 'resembles', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'quot', 'Thing', 'Do', 'quot', 'difference', 'former', 'credible', 'picture', 'former', 'stars', 'living', 'present', 'latter', 'directly', 'world', 'relations', 'surrounding', 'pop-song', 'group.The', 'film', 'refers', 'many', 'chorus', 'groups', 'quot', 'Dells', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harptones', 'quot', 'so', 'can', 'sing', 'song', 'two', 'will', 'like', 'sound', 'can', 'hear', 'film', 'vividly', 'realized', 'Kenny', 'Vance', 'who', 'was', 'leader', 'quot', 'Jay', 'Americans.', 'quot', 'Many', 'say', 'rightly', 'homage', 'doo-wap', 'songs', 'even', 'though', 'said', 'relations', 'characters', 'come', 'forefront', 'story', 'also', 'true', 'moody', 'soundtrack', 'justice', 'film', 'title', 'expectation', 'based', 'that.Finally', 'film', 'whole', 'slightly', 'light-weight', 'rare', 'occasion', 'American', 'film', 'introduce', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'aged', 'more', '40', 'bit', 'surprise', 'film', 'place', 'too', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'clad', 'fancy', 'dress', 'wonder', 'why', 'be', 'wasted', 'pointless', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'doing', 'very', 'thankless', 'role', 'can', 'enliven', 'screen', 'single-handedly', 'shown', 'here']",Looking for an Echo
