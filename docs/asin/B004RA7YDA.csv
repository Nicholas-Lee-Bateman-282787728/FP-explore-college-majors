Some films also deal with Gold and Sword beaches depicting the British landings.  This is the first film in my experience that deals with the Canadians landing on Juno.  The intense fighting on Omaha and Utah generally garner the most attention in any film about D-Day.Juno was just as strongly defended as the beaches on which the Americans landed and presented the Canadians with as diverse a set of challenges as those experienced by the Americans.  The Canadians pressed the attack and broke through the stubborn German defense.Storming Juno is intense, realistic and as accurate a depiction of the landing as those seen in the Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan.

Would they know it if they did?Be warned!  This is clearly a *made for television* program - one third of which is interviews with Canadian veterans of the D-Day invasions.  Amazon doesn't disclose this and charges the same for it that they do for feature films.  That is a questionable practice.  If you are in Canada, you will probably have another chance to see this on television too, the next time there is a reason to commemorate D-Day.It is not... unwatchable.  In fact, the interviews at the end are probably the best part.  But from the point of view of narrative, story-telling, acting, rounded characters, cinematography, special effects, and editing... This is very much lacking!!Look, guys, it is great that the story of the Canadian landing at Juno gets this air-time, but I would think those of you who want Canada to get its own time in the commemorative sun (if you will), would have some standards and not be so easily satisfied.

You don't hear much about the Canadian participation in WW2, especially modern telling of the account. Outside of 49th Parallel  and Darby's Rangers, you just don't. But I knew of the Canadian involvement during D-Day and wanted to see just how accurate it would be.Told by the narration of a single person, you are told the stories from a Paratrooper, a tank soldier and infantryman during that infamous day. The action is good, uniforms and weapons mostly correct (the German Pak-75s weren't proper at the muzzle brake) and the Sherman a later mark than the early M-4s the Canadians used, unless they wanted to represent a Firefly Sherman. At least it was a Sherman, not a M-48 or M-24 so commonly featured.You still can't help but wonder what happened that day. Intermixed with actual footage shot at Normandy and recreation, its a well seamed mix. But the acting seemed a tad labored and off with some of the actors. The effects are rather well done, CGI is your friend!!After the film is over, there is interviews with actual Canadian veterans , telling their experiences of the war. This to me was the better part of the DVD.  It reminds me of watching Band of Brothers, showing the real men featured in the series with interviews.If I could, I would more rate this 3.5 stars.

We have the perspective from a paratrooper, a tank officer and a foot soldier.  After seeing the intense battle on the beach in Saving Private Ryan some years ago, the scene on the beach in this movie wasn't as 'polished' but found that my emotions were in tatters as it became all the more personal.  I never forget our young soldiers sacrifices, and to see the same effect on these soldiers trying to land on the beach, and being cut down is heartbreaking.  There are the few that manage to make it through, and the beach gets secured. If I remember correctly, out of one group of 110 men, 17 survived, and out of many tanks that were made to float from two miles away at sea, one managed to make it to the beach.  The paratrooper manages to find his squad after a delay, and they must find a way to take the big gun out before more troops land.  The story is true, and their mission is accomplished.

'Storming Juno' is a great small budget movie about the Canadian forces on D-Day attacking Juno Beach which was there assignment. The first 3/4 of this film follows the exploits of 3 soldiers on D-Day; a paratrooper, an infantry Officer, and a Sherman Tank crew. The battle scenes for all 3 characters and their units are very well done. The scenes are not 'graphic' like Saving Private Ryan but they are sharp, authentic and believable. This is not a film where a Canadian soldier fires 3 rounds--and 9 German soldiers fall down--its done much better than that as I said. It does come as a bit of a surprise when the 3 segments of the men in battle end rather abruptly at around 45 minutes and the current day veterans (including some Germans) are interviewed. The vets from D-Day are very moving in their description of what happened on D-Day--just like the vets in Band of Brothers were. Hearing how they are all still effected emotionally by events occurring more than 60 yrs ago, will leave you proud an grateful for what all the soldiers on June 6th accomplished.

Rather, this is a made-for-TV docudrama with the ads cut out.  Made for Canadian TV, actually.  The movie was essentially financed by Canadian government entities and Canadian non-profit organizations.  Put another way, it is a public-private financed movie and was probably shown free on Canadian TV.Amazon should not be charging its customers to view this movie.As for the story itself, it is the same old WWII D-day story but told from a strictly Canadian perspective, i.e., with a singular focus on the Canadian troops assigned to the beachhead called &#8220;Juno.&#8221;  For viewers familiar with the June 1944 landing, the story really contains nothing new.  That would also include the interviews with broken-down, weepy veterans that is attached to the last ten minutes of the film.________________________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.  For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.  A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.",2,Same Old Stuff,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1254,"['Sick', 'Stupid', 'Score', '0/5*This', 'film', 'not', 'first-run', 'feature', 'movie', 'synopsis', 'imply', 'Rather', 'made-for-TV', 'docudrama', 'ads', 'cut', 'out', 'Made', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'actually', 'movie', 'was', 'essentially', 'financed', 'Canadian', 'government', 'entities', 'Canadian', 'non-profit', 'organizations', 'Put', 'way', 'public-private', 'financed', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'shown', 'free', 'Canadian', 'TV.Amazon', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'charging', 'customers', 'view', 'movie.As', 'story', 'same', 'old', 'WWII', 'D-day', 'story', 'told', 'strictly', 'Canadian', 'perspective', 'i.e.', 'singular', 'focus', 'Canadian', 'troops', 'assigned', 'beachhead', 'called', '8220', 'Juno.', '8221', 'viewers', 'familiar', 'June', '1944', 'landing', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'would', 'also', 'include', 'interviews', 'broken-down', 'weepy', 'veterans', 'attached', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film.________________________________________________*', 'Sick', 'Stupid', 'Score', 'movies', 'zero', 'ten', 'category', 'example', 'Sick', 'Stupid', 'Score', '5/5', 'movie', 'average', 'Sick', 'average', 'Stupid', 'Score', '10/10', 'movie', 'so', 'gross', 'idiotic', 'one', 'should', 'watch', 'Score', '0/0', 'perfect', 'movie']",N/A

However, whenever I purchase films on the topic of war, especially those written by Canadian or European film makers, I tread very cautiously, being aware of the rampant anti-military sentiment among the film communities in those countries. However, my misgivings were not warranted. The film is a just celebration of the courage of, not only Canadians who served, but of all allied soldiers who joined to fight the fascism of the 20th century. Canada's veterans, those few WW2 vets remaining (I lost my father last year at 92), deserve to be revered and respected as ""heroes"". The story follows three soldiers, a member of Canada's Airborne regiment, a commander of a Sherman tank and an infantryman. The action is taught, the dialogue (though stiff at times) is acceptable and the equipment/technology accurate for the period. Stens, Lee Enfields and Tommy guns for the Canadians and accurate portrayals of German weaponry and uniforms. I was pleased to see that they got the Canadian helmets right (Canadians wore distinctive helmets, slightly different from the British, at Normandy for the first time). They also got the airborne equipment right. My only quibble in this respect was the aircraft which delivered the troops (some modified version of a B25 bomber). They should have got it correct (either a Dakota or Halifax - since it was all CGI anyway, they could have gotten that right). The film is a fitting tribute to those who fought in the Normandy campaign - Canada having not been given nearly as much credit as it deserved. God bless the veterans for saving the world and congratulations to the film makers for making such a moving tribute. This film should be seen by anyone interested in history, western heritage and those interested particularly in the war against fascism, either during World War 2 or the current struggle where Canadians, Americans and Brits serve side by side.",5,Canada's Private Ryan - they got it right this time!!,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,1984,"['was', 'anxious', 'see', 'film', 'late', 'father', 'having', 'served', '420', 'squadron', 'RCAF', 'However', 'whenever', 'purchase', 'films', 'topic', 'war', 'especially', 'written', 'Canadian', 'European', 'film', 'makers', 'tread', 'very', 'cautiously', 'being', 'aware', 'rampant', 'anti-military', 'sentiment', 'film', 'communities', 'countries', 'However', 'misgivings', 'were', 'not', 'warranted', 'film', 'just', 'celebration', 'courage', 'not', 'only', 'Canadians', 'who', 'served', 'allied', 'soldiers', 'who', 'joined', 'fight', 'fascism', '20th', 'century', 'Canada', 'veterans', 'few', 'WW2', 'vets', 'remaining', 'lost', 'father', 'last', 'year', '92', 'deserve', 'be', 'revered', 'respected', 'heroes', 'story', 'three', 'soldiers', 'member', 'Canada', 'Airborne', 'regiment', 'commander', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'infantryman', 'action', 'taught', 'dialogue', 'stiff', 'times', 'acceptable', 'equipment/technology', 'accurate', 'period', 'Stens', 'Lee', 'Enfields', 'Tommy', 'guns', 'Canadians', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'German', 'weaponry', 'uniforms', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'got', 'Canadian', 'helmets', 'right', 'Canadians', 'wore', 'distinctive', 'helmets', 'slightly', 'different', 'British', 'Normandy', 'first', 'time', 'also', 'got', 'airborne', 'equipment', 'right', 'only', 'quibble', 'respect', 'was', 'aircraft', 'delivered', 'troops', 'modified', 'version', 'B25', 'bomber', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'correct', 'Dakota', 'Halifax', 'was', 'CGI', 'anyway', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'right', 'film', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'who', 'fought', 'Normandy', 'campaign', 'Canada', 'having', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'deserved', 'God', 'veterans', 'saving', 'world', 'congratulations', 'film', 'makers', 'making', 'such', 'moving', 'tribute', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'western', 'heritage', 'interested', 'particularly', 'war', 'fascism', 'either', 'World', 'War', '2', 'current', 'struggle', 'where', 'Canadians', 'Americans', 'Brits', 'serve', 'side', 'side']",N/A
