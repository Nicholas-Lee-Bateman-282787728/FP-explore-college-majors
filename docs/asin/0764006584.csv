2831,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,0764006584,Andres C. Salama,"[5, 5]","Now that Libya is in the news, it might be good to look at this film, made 30 years ago. It deals with the two decades long rebellion by one Omar Mukhtar against the Italian colonial authorities in Libya, and how it was finally suppressed, through ruthless means, by the army of Mussolini in 1931. This movie was famously financed by Gaddhafi, whose funds allowed this relatively unknown war to be brought to the screen with a decent budget. The director was Syria's Mustapha Akkad, who would die two decades and a half later in a terrorist bombing. With its fine battle scenes, showing a diversity of military tactics, I think that military buffs will especially appreciate this film. The movie naturally has an anticolonialist point of view, but it's not unfair to the Italians, who are the center of much of the movie (despite this, this movie was banned in Italy for decades). As a movie dealing with the anticolonial struggle in the Arab world it can be favorably compared to the Battle of Algiers (Lawrence of Arabia is another movie that comes to mind). Anthony Quinn is impressive as the old, noble Omar, but the best performance of the movie to me is by Oliver Reed, as the brilliant but ruthless Italian general Graziani. Unfortunately, Rod Steiger, in his brief role as the Duce, just doesn't cut it, it looks like a poor parody and he even looks embarrassed to be there. And while not as bad a performance, John Gielgud is just not believable in his supporting role as an Arab sheikh allied with the Italians. The movie could have been a bit tighter as well (it's almost three hours long) but despite these minor flaws, I recommended strongly.",5,Impressive movie about little known anticolonial war,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,1655,"['Now', 'Libya', 'news', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'look', 'film', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'decades', 'long', 'rebellion', 'one', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'Italian', 'colonial', 'authorities', 'Libya', 'how', 'was', 'finally', 'suppressed', 'ruthless', 'means', 'army', 'Mussolini', '1931', 'movie', 'was', 'famously', 'financed', 'Gaddhafi', 'funds', 'allowed', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'war', 'be', 'brought', 'screen', 'decent', 'budget', 'director', 'was', 'Syria', 'Mustapha', 'Akkad', 'who', 'would', 'die', 'two', 'decades', 'half', 'later', 'terrorist', 'bombing', 'fine', 'battle', 'scenes', 'showing', 'diversity', 'military', 'tactics', 'think', 'military', 'buffs', 'will', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'film', 'movie', 'naturally', 'anticolonialist', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'unfair', 'Italians', 'who', 'are', 'center', 'much', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'banned', 'Italy', 'decades', 'movie', 'dealing', 'anticolonial', 'struggle', 'Arab', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'favorably', 'compared', 'Battle', 'Algiers', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'movie', 'mind', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'impressive', 'old', 'noble', 'Omar', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'brilliant', 'ruthless', 'Italian', 'general', 'Graziani', 'Unfortunately', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'brief', 'role', 'Duce', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'poor', 'parody', 'even', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'there', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'supporting', 'role', 'Arab', 'sheikh', 'allied', 'Italians', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'tighter', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'minor', 'flaws', 'recommended', 'strongly']",N/A

2837,A2SXGU7L6VLJ5P,0764006584,Gogol,"[10, 13]","First I must comment on the shamless racist bigot Jeff Shannon and his so called 'review' of this film which seems to be more concerned with who financed the film rather than it's contents.The film 'Muhammad'he claims was 'critically roasted' strange that in that I have lived in the Middle East for several years and can recall that film being shown every Ramadan in countries from Qatar to Turkey, strange in that it is distributed by newspapers for free during Ramadan in Turkey and is one of the most highly respected films in the country, strange in that it is approved by al-Azhar University the most respected University in Sunni Islam and by the Shia body of Lebanon strange in that Jeff Shannon obviously has no idea what he is talking about. But what is particually discusting is his language:""Under a shaggy Muslim beard""Congratulations Amazon on one of the worst examples of racist stereotyping I have read since Enid Blyton's 'gollywog' character. There was I thinking that this kind of racism had died out over 30 years ago only to find it prominently displayed at amazon (I should point out here I made the same complaint to amazon.co.uk and had no response. Seems Muslims and ethnic minorities are fair game again these days)The film itself does suffer from some poor displays especially from seasoned actors such as Oliver Reed while Anthony Quinn (under his 'shaggy Muslim beard' (sorry but that phrase is just so openly racist it frankly discusts and enrages me)) is exellent in the role of Umar al-Mukhtar. It is facinating to see the tactics that his men used against the militarily far superior Italian forces and also the barbaric response that the Italians made against them.It should be pointed out that Amazons synopsis is also wrong. Umar al-Mukhtar was the leader of resistance for the Sanusi Sufi order which was led by the grand Sanusi who was in exile in Egypt (Umar al-Mukhtar was orded to take up arms by his Sheikh and not simply the leader of a band of men who take up arms as amazon's synopsis would have you believe). The Sanusi order which originally was a peacefull order speading Islam in the Sub Sahara through education and the opening of schools next to their 'Zawiyas' was forced into military action by the agressive policies of first the French and then the Italians. It should also be pointed out that they also fought along side the Ottomans in the first world war and their Sheikh was a significant leader in the Turkish war of independence. This should give the veiwer an idea that this film is of far more importance than just a ""curiosity for those wanting to learn more about Lybian history""This film deplicts one of the darkest periods of Italian history and regardless of who financed the film it is an important document of a period of history Italy has tried to hide. I would equally like to see a film documenting the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.I would also recomend the books desert encouter by K Holmboe and Omar al-Mukhtar by Enzo Santarelli for further reading both published by Darf publications. The book 'Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad also has some mention of the Sanusi order, Umar al-Mukhtar and the role that the Sanusis played in the Turkish war of independence.This film deserves 5 stars as it stands as one of the only cinematic documents of this period of history.",5,Shame on you amazon,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,3341,"['First', 'must', 'comment', 'shamless', 'racist', 'bigot', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'so', 'called', ""'review"", 'film', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'who', 'financed', 'film', 'rather', 'contents.The', 'film', 'claims', 'was', ""'critically"", 'roasted', 'strange', 'have', 'lived', 'Middle', 'East', 'several', 'years', 'can', 'recall', 'film', 'being', 'shown', 'Ramadan', 'countries', 'Qatar', 'Turkey', 'strange', 'distributed', 'newspapers', 'free', 'Ramadan', 'Turkey', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'respected', 'films', 'country', 'strange', 'approved', 'al-Azhar', 'University', 'most', 'respected', 'University', 'Sunni', 'Islam', 'Shia', 'body', 'Lebanon', 'strange', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'obviously', 'idea', 'what', 'talking', 'what', 'particually', 'discusting', 'language', 'shaggy', 'Muslim', 'beard', 'Congratulations', 'Amazon', 'one', 'worst', 'examples', 'racist', 'stereotyping', 'have', 'read', 'Enid', 'Blyton', ""'gollywog"", 'character', 'was', 'thinking', 'kind', 'racism', 'had', 'died', 'out', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'find', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'amazon', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'here', 'made', 'same', 'complaint', 'amazon.co.uk', 'had', 'response', 'Muslims', 'ethnic', 'minorities', 'are', 'fair', 'game', 'again', 'days', 'film', 'suffer', 'poor', 'displays', 'especially', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'such', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', ""'shaggy"", 'Muslim', 'beard', 'sorry', 'phrase', 'just', 'so', 'openly', 'racist', 'frankly', 'discusts', 'enrages', 'exellent', 'role', 'Umar', 'al-Mukhtar', 'facinating', 'see', 'tactics', 'men', 'used', 'militarily', 'far', 'superior', 'Italian', 'forces', 'also', 'barbaric', 'response', 'Italians', 'made', 'them.It', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Amazons', 'synopsis', 'also', 'wrong', 'al-Mukhtar', 'was', 'leader', 'resistance', 'Sanusi', 'Sufi', 'order', 'was', 'led', 'grand', 'Sanusi', 'who', 'was', 'exile', 'Egypt', 'Umar', 'al-Mukhtar', 'was', 'orded', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'Sheikh', 'not', 'simply', 'leader', 'band', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'amazon', 'synopsis', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Sanusi', 'order', 'originally', 'was', 'peacefull', 'order', 'speading', 'Islam', 'Sub', 'Sahara', 'education', 'opening', 'schools', ""'Zawiyas"", 'was', 'forced', 'military', 'action', 'agressive', 'policies', 'first', 'French', 'then', 'Italians', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'also', 'fought', 'along', 'side', 'Ottomans', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'Sheikh', 'was', 'significant', 'leader', 'Turkish', 'war', 'independence', 'should', 'give', 'veiwer', 'idea', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'just', 'curiosity', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'Lybian', 'history', 'film', 'one', 'darkest', 'periods', 'Italian', 'history', 'regardless', 'who', 'financed', 'film', 'important', 'document', 'period', 'history', 'Italy', 'tried', 'hide', 'would', 'equally', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'documenting', 'Italian', 'occupation', 'Ethiopia.I', 'would', 'also', 'recomend', 'books', 'desert', 'encouter', 'K', 'Holmboe', 'Omar', 'al-Mukhtar', 'Enzo', 'Santarelli', 'further', 'reading', 'published', 'Darf', 'publications', 'book', ""'Road"", 'Mecca', 'Muhammad', 'Asad', 'also', 'mention', 'Sanusi', 'order', 'Umar', 'al-Mukhtar', 'role', 'Sanusis', 'played', 'Turkish', 'war', 'independence.This', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'only', 'cinematic', 'documents', 'period', 'history']",N/A

Why do I have to pour troops into a victory I have already won?""  So the movie begins as the Italian leader questions events, questions which sound eerily familiar as the guerrilla war now escalates in Iraq today.This movie is valuable on two fronts.  It is one of those rare movies giving a positive view of Arabs, one of maybe 50 movies in cinematic history (out of 900 presenting Arabs).  It is indeed strange, to see Arabs as the good guys, and Europeans as the bad ones- but a very positive strange.  And they are not just the good guys, but the very heroic, deep, philosophical, and loving good guys.  Produced by Lybia's Qaddafi, there certainly is a bias in this film; but it's pleasant to see a bias on the other side for once.  There are many very Arab nuances- how they naturally show honor and hospitality to their neighbors, things the Italians lack.  Children learning the Qur'an by rote, as well as the wisdom of the Qur'an.  Women coming together around the well.  Men and women working in the fields of Lybia.  These are not just the blind enemy followers of America, but a real people, in all their wondrous uniqueness.  One can learn more about this movie, and the other 850 anti-Semitic portrayals of Arabs, in Shaheen'sReel Bad Arabs.The other extremely valuable aspect of this movie is the ammunition it provides against the myth of redemptive violence.  The movie itself is too violent and has too much gore at times- though it is history, it is not necessary to portray it so realistically.  But it also argues persuasively against imperialism, and violence itself.  ""The Lion"" tells his people to not shoot prisoners, for ""We will not let our enemy be our teachers."" Omar here is certainly a heroic figure.  And it is truly so hard to do this, to not be taught by our enemies, for we so naturally become that which we hate.Lion has moving portrayals by Quinn, and the cinematographic ploy of interspersing real black-and-white footage from the Italian ethnic cleansing is very effective, for feeling the pain of what the Lybians went through under Italian oppression.  But it is also helpful for showing us a generally unknown freedom fighter, and that when we forget history, we repeat it.  The Italians become bogged down in guerrilla warfare in the mountains, as the Arabs hide in caves.  A great and powerful nation tried to control a Middle Eastern people, and stayed too long.  And so Omar tells a French soldier to return to his headquarters, with the remains of his flag, saying ""It does not belong here.""  It's not that it's a bad flag.  It's just that it's in the wrong place.",4,Reel Good Arabs,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2672,"['defeated', 'Bedouin', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'hanging', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'pour', 'troops', 'victory', 'have', 'already', 'won', 'movie', 'Italian', 'leader', 'questions', 'events', 'questions', 'sound', 'eerily', 'familiar', 'guerrilla', 'war', 'now', 'Iraq', 'today.This', 'movie', 'valuable', 'two', 'fronts', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'giving', 'positive', 'view', 'Arabs', 'one', 'maybe', '50', 'movies', 'cinematic', 'history', '900', 'presenting', 'Arabs', 'indeed', 'strange', 'see', 'Arabs', 'good', 'guys', 'Europeans', 'bad', 'ones-', 'very', 'positive', 'strange', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'guys', 'very', 'heroic', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'loving', 'good', 'guys', 'Produced', 'Lybia', 'Qaddafi', 'certainly', 'bias', 'film', 'pleasant', 'see', 'bias', 'other', 'side', 'once', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'Arab', 'nuances-', 'how', 'naturally', 'show', 'honor', 'hospitality', 'neighbors', 'things', 'Italians', 'lack', 'Children', 'learning', ""Qur'an"", 'rote', 'as', 'well', 'wisdom', ""Qur'an"", 'Women', 'coming', 'together', 'well', 'Men', 'women', 'working', 'fields', 'Lybia', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'blind', 'enemy', 'followers', 'America', 'real', 'people', 'wondrous', 'uniqueness', 'One', 'can', 'learn', 'more', 'movie', 'other', '850', 'anti-Semitic', 'portrayals', 'Arabs', ""Shaheen'sReel"", 'Bad', 'Arabs.The', 'other', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'ammunition', 'myth', 'redemptive', 'violence', 'movie', 'too', 'violent', 'too', 'much', 'gore', 'times-', 'history', 'not', 'necessary', 'portray', 'so', 'realistically', 'also', 'persuasively', 'imperialism', 'violence', 'Lion', 'people', 'not', 'shoot', 'prisoners', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'enemy', 'be', 'teachers', 'Omar', 'here', 'certainly', 'heroic', 'figure', 'truly', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'taught', 'enemies', 'so', 'naturally', 'become', 'hate.Lion', 'moving', 'portrayals', 'Quinn', 'cinematographic', 'ploy', 'interspersing', 'real', 'black-and-white', 'footage', 'Italian', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'very', 'effective', 'feeling', 'pain', 'what', 'Lybians', 'went', 'Italian', 'oppression', 'also', 'helpful', 'showing', 'generally', 'unknown', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'when', 'forget', 'history', 'repeat', 'Italians', 'become', 'bogged', 'down', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'mountains', 'Arabs', 'hide', 'caves', 'great', 'powerful', 'nation', 'tried', 'control', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'people', 'stayed', 'too', 'long', 'so', 'Omar', 'French', 'soldier', 'return', 'headquarters', 'remains', 'flag', 'saying', 'not', 'belong', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'flag', 'just', 'wrong', 'place']",N/A
2842,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0764006584,Jeffrey Leach,"[104, 106]","When one thinks of the name Moustapha Akkad, if one thinks of it at all, the thought most likely concerns the ""Halloween"" franchise. After all, Akkad financed the first film and eventually took over the rest of the series. Every time you witness a new entry in the ""Halloween"" canon, Akkad is probably the one to blame. But few people know that Moustapha Akkad also directed epic films about Arab history in the late 1970s and early 1980s, or that these films are extraordinarily laudable cinematic pieces well worth watching today. Arab history certainly wouldn't rank high on anyone's list nowadays with the explosion in Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorist attacks of September 2001 still in the forefront of our minds. That's too bad because this picture starring Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger, and Oliver Reed is not only immensely watchable, it also presents a different viewpoint on the relationship between the West and the Arabic world. Most importantly, this movie shows that Moustapha Akkad hasn't always sat around collecting checks from his ""Halloween"" projects.""Lion of the Desert"" opens in the year 1922 right after Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian government. As many historians know, Il Duce quickly decided one way to bolster his fascist dictatorship was to present it as a renewed Roman Empire. One of his first priorities as a conquering Augustus was to renew efforts to pacify the Bedouin tribes in the Italian colony of Libya. After ascertaining that the leader of the Bedouin resistance is a man named Omar Mukhtar, Mussolini handpicks one of his most ruthless and capable generals, Rodolfo Graziani, as the new governor of the colony. Graziani's mission is to go to Libya and smash these pesky desert nomads in any way he sees fit. The Italian presence in Libya dates back some twenty years, and Il Duce isn't about to lose the territory on his watch. His general soon sails to Libya with a few novel ideas on how to defeat the Arab resistance, and he won't let anyone stand in his way. Graziani is such a ruthless tyrant that even Omar Mukhtar recognizes his name when told the general is now the new governor. Mukhtar isn't about to just let Graziani roll over his people, while the general intends to teach Mukhtar a lesson he and his people will never forget.This movie overflows with magnificently choreographed battle sequences involving thousands of extras. Moreover, Akkad and his crew took great pains to reproduce the Italian military equipment down to the smallest details. It must have killed some of the craftsmen on the movie to watch months of painstaking labor go up in a two second explosion, something that happens on a frequent basis during the film as the Bedouins routinely destroy endless numbers of armored cars and tanks. According to the makers of ""Lion of the Desert,"" Graziani was the first military commander to use tanks in the desert, and the movie portrays this historic battle in expansive detail. It is difficult to say which battle sequence is the best, although I would definitely lean towards the artillery barrage in the valley when Italian field cannons open up on entrenched Bedouins in the caves on the side of a mountain. The sound and fury of this encounter looks great on DVD, with the explosions of the shells literally booming out of my sound system.The performances really make this film a winner. Rod Steiger plays Benito Mussolini with all of the swagger you would expect from an actor portraying the pompous fascist dictator. Oliver Reed works wonders as the cold-hearted Graziani. The best performance in the film is definitely Anthony Quinn's turn as Omar Mukhtar. Not only does he look like the actual historical figure, as seen by photographic comparisons made in one of the extras on the DVD, he strikes just the right balance of compassion and controlled ferocity. The meeting between Mukhtar and Graziani towards the end of the film fills the screen with drama, along with several statements made by Mukhtar that would apply to any conquered peoples on the face of the earth. The 162 minute runtime insures that most of the characters receive appropriate development.Arguably, the most emotional and tense scenes in ""Lion of the Desert"" occur when Graziani institutes his plan to put the Bedouin population in concentration camps in order to force Mukhtar and his freedom fighters to surrender. The film ingeniously stages scenes of the concentration camps and then, without missing a beat, tacks on real film footage from the Italian occupation showing an aerial view of the prisons. Unlike Hitler with the Jews, the Italians did not gas Bedouins in these camps, but thousands of Bedouins did die from poor conditions. Moreover, Graziani ordered the fields burned and the execution by both bullet and noose of innocent civilians to avenge Italian battle casualties. For a PG rated movie, the atrocities and battle deaths are extremely bloody.The DVD looks great, with a widescreen picture transfer and a slew of extras. The making of documentary outlines a score of interesting facts about the production of the film, such as the need to build an entire city in the desert to house and feed the thousands of people used during the production. According to the trailer and a few references in the making of documentary, the film originally bore the title ""Omar Mukhtar."" I think the title they went with was a smart choice, however, because it makes you think about who qualifies as the real lion of the desert. Is it Graziani or is it Mukhtar? Well, it is both men as they test each other's mettle through years of combat.

Aside from picture and sound quality that is rather good for such an old film, the story, the characters and the battle scenes exceed one's expectations.  Anthony Quinn plays a wise teacher who moonlights as a rebellion leader in Italian-occupied Libya.  Oliver Reed plays an Italian general who was sent to Libya by ""Il Duce"" Mussolini, played with humourous gusto by Rod Steiger, in 1929 to crush the rebellion.  This film emphasizes that it was this general, named Rodolfo Graziani, who was the first to employ tanks in the desert, and one sees alot of light tanks being used against Bedouin horsemen.  Aside from regular Italian army officers, there are fascist Black Shirt officers who, like Hitler's S.S. officers, just love being cruel and sadastic.

Sure, they look antiquated now, but back then, you'd be crapping in your pants if you saw those things rolling towards you.The best part about this movie is that it defines the two main characters really well.  First you have Graziani who is seen as LOOKING civilized with his well-pressed uniform and splendid looking army.  Then you see Anthony Quinn's character who is dressed like a shephard (and rides on horseback).  But as we learn throughout the film, it's Anthony Quinn who is the more civilized combatant - Graziani, on the other hand, is quite ruthless.It's a great contrast of character and national backgrounds that shape the battles between these two commanders.

2850,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,0764006584,Medusa,"[3, 3]","If you want to know what Jihad meant in the Arabic world, when the world still had values, this movie, by the brilliant filmmaker Akkad paints a spectacular mural of that world; approach it with an open mind.Omar Mukhtar's story, one of several masterpieces Akkad created during his life, was a great choice by him.  Mukhtar the old man, who led the resistance against the Italian occupation for 22 years, is a living legend in the Arabic world. Thanks to Gratiziani's obsession with media, all confrontations with the small number of Libyan fighters, as well as the concentration camps that Gratisiani established in Libya, were thoroughly documented.When Akkad produced and directed this movie in 1981, there was no misunderstanding about what Jihad was, and the association of terrorism with Islam did not exist. Jihad in every nation, not necessarily Arabic nations, is about struggle in life. The movie simply portrayed documented traits of Mukhtar.  Mukhtar demonstrates the true meaning of Jihad by showing wisdom, patience and honor. Mukhtar's fight was a self defense act directed against an invading army not civilians.Mukhtar's fighters struggled against the Italian Army, just like Native Americans struggled against invaders. Any nation's right of independence is a right that doesn't need justification.The Libyans tying their legs when fighting until death instead of running away, is a heroic act not a suicidal one. Like Mukhtar said: ""to choose death when defending your land, your freedom, is to choose life for ever"".It's about time we separate religion from people, political games from faith; pedophiliac priests are not an indictment against all of Catholicism, fascist governments are not always a true representation of a nation's people, Fanatical religious Israeli settlers do not define Judaism, radical zealots beheading unarmed civilians does not pertain to Islam. We need to understand the good vs. the bad, terrorism vs. Jihad, life vs. death, Moustapha Akkad vs. Osama bin Laden.Moustapha Akkad, an educated, open minded Syrian man, who chose to live his life using his wealth to educate people, and enrich the entertainment industry by making movies such as Lion of the Desert. Bin Laden chose to live his life fighting civilians and teaching how to defeat armies by killing civilians (in the name of religion), which brought widespread opprobrium to Islam. Was it a coincidence, that Akkad was killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan in 2005? Akkad, the man of peace and love went there to meet his daughter for a family wedding, but they both died when the wedding hall was bombed.What can I say about Anthony Quinn? Does a man who portrayed Zorba in ""Zorba the Greek""need any praise from Medusa? Lion of the Dessert, which Quinn blessed with his acting genius helped make the movie a complete masterpiece.

But to Akkad's credit, he has never denied taking funds from Gaddafi, and said that he never allowed the dictator to influence the film in any way.Shooting on locations in Italy and Libya, Akkad traces the confrontation between Omar Mukhtar and Graziani, juxtaposing the quieter moments with massive, well-mounted battle scenes featuring hundreds of extras and big explosions. The action might not be up to the standards of CGI-created extravaganzas like ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is impressive nonetheless.The supporting cast, largely featuring actors from Europe like Takis Emmanuel and Irene Papas, is uniformly good, bringing a much needed human touch to their characters which are not very well fleshed out.The film uses loads of historical background and some old black and white footage of actual events like Bedouin tribespeople beingh herded into concentration camps set up by Graziani, but never handles its subject matter in an overtly sentimental way.Director Akkad takes a few liberties with history - Omar Mukhtar and Graziani probably never had the conversation depicted in the film but it is to the credit of Anthony Quinn and Oliver Reed that they manage to pull off this sequence brilliantly - and the end result is entirely satisfying.Anchor Bay improves on its previous release of this movie for its 25th anniversary edition by making the panoramic widescreen vistas available in anamorphic video and including a commentary from Akkad.There is also a wonderful documentary this is definitely not a fluffy making-of piece with everyone saying nice things about each other. The documentary captures the lengths that Akkad and his crew went to shoot on the desert locations, enduring high temperatures and ardous conditions. It also details the problems the filmmakers faced in obtaining authentic 1930s era Italian military equipment, including tanks.A snippet in this documentary shows how closely Quinn resembled the real Omar Mukhtar, and has the actor talking about the reasons which drew him to the role.If you like historical epics, this one is definitely for you.",4,They don't make them like this anymore,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,3560,"['Disregard', 'controversy', 'associated', 'film', 'funding', 'came', 'Libyan', 'director', 'Muammar', 'Gaddafi', 'oblique', 'criticism', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'yarn', 'heroic', 'leader', 'heading', 'desperate', 'struggle', 'foreign', 'invaders', 'motherland.This', 'film', 'fact', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'age', 'US-led', 'intervention', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'giving', 'nice', 'unbiased', 'view', 'Arab', 'politics', 'history.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'magnificent', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'Libyan', 'teacher-turned-guerrilla', 'leader', 'who', 'lead', '20-year', 'struggle', 'military', 'might', 'Italian', 'dictator', 'Mussolini', 'forces', 'had', 'invaded', 'country.Rod', 'Steiger', 'up', 'Mussolini', 'prevented', 'director', 'Moustapha', 'Akkad', 'going', 'top', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'quite', 'good', 'General', 'Rodolfo', 'Graziani', 'man', 'sent', 'Mussolini', 'put', 'down', 'rebellion', 'Libya.Thanks', 'Syrian-born', 'Akkad', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'producer', 'Helloween', 'series', 'movie', 'different', 'insight', 'troubled', 'relations', 'Arab', 'world', 'West', 'Antony', 'Quinn', 'Mukhtar', 'probably', 'first', 'Arab', 'hero', 'who', 'been', 'sympathetically', 'portrayed', 'big', 'budget', 'film.By', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1985', 'such', 'big', 'budget', 'epics', 'had', 'gone', 'favour', 'Hollywood', 'bad', 'publicity', 'funding', 'Gaddafi', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'help', 'box', 'office', 'prospects', 'Akkad', 'credit', 'never', 'denied', 'taking', 'funds', 'Gaddafi', 'said', 'never', 'allowed', 'dictator', 'influence', 'film', 'way.Shooting', 'locations', 'Italy', 'Libya', 'Akkad', 'confrontation', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'Graziani', 'juxtaposing', 'quieter', 'moments', 'massive', 'well-mounted', 'battle', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'big', 'explosions', 'action', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'standards', 'CGI-created', 'extravaganzas', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'impressive', 'nonetheless.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'largely', 'featuring', 'actors', 'Europe', 'Takis', 'Emmanuel', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'uniformly', 'good', 'bringing', 'much', 'needed', 'human', 'touch', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out.The', 'film', 'loads', 'historical', 'background', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'actual', 'events', 'Bedouin', 'tribespeople', 'beingh', 'herded', 'concentration', 'camps', 'set', 'up', 'Graziani', 'never', 'subject', 'matter', 'overtly', 'sentimental', 'way.Director', 'Akkad', 'few', 'liberties', 'history', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'Graziani', 'probably', 'never', 'had', 'conversation', 'depicted', 'film', 'credit', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'sequence', 'brilliantly', 'end', 'result', 'entirely', 'satisfying.Anchor', 'Bay', 'previous', 'release', 'movie', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'making', 'panoramic', 'widescreen', 'vistas', 'available', 'anamorphic', 'video', 'including', 'commentary', 'Akkad.There', 'also', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'definitely', 'not', 'fluffy', 'making-of', 'piece', 'everyone', 'saying', 'nice', 'things', 'other', 'documentary', 'lengths', 'Akkad', 'crew', 'went', 'shoot', 'desert', 'locations', 'enduring', 'high', 'temperatures', 'ardous', 'conditions', 'also', 'details', 'problems', 'filmmakers', 'faced', 'obtaining', 'authentic', '1930s', 'era', 'Italian', 'military', 'equipment', 'including', 'tanks.A', 'snippet', 'documentary', 'how', 'closely', 'Quinn', 'resembled', 'real', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'actor', 'talking', 'reasons', 'drew', 'role.If', 'historical', 'epics', 'one', 'definitely']",N/A

Quinn and Reed were persuasive -- I think they relished their roles -- and some of the underlings good, as well. There was enough complexity to avoid utter stereotyping. Who cares who paid for it. Sit back and enjoy some good scenery and lively battle scenes,then head for the history books to sort things out. And, it looked great on my dvd player.

2863,A1UQSWIX25P59F,0764006584,RRskaReb,"[10, 11]","As far as war movies go, this is one of the best.  The action shots and battle scenes were for the most part excellent and not short on theatrical blood and gore...but there again, many of these scenes seem silly and exploitive somehow with the realization that the truth is infinitely more horrible.  In the long run, this what I think the director was trying to convey to the viewer.I read a review of this film shortly after it came out twenty five or so years ago.  The reviewer said he saw this film with his son and he said that his son asked him towards the beginning during one of the battle scenes if the whole movie was like this?  The reviewer agreed that it was...WRONG.  The story was so much more than what on the surface appears to be a gratuitous shoot 'em up.  There was a great amount of dialog that presented the background of the Italian-Libyan situation of the 1920s without ever becoming boring, and in fact left myself wanting to know even more about this corner of history.The acting by one and all was excellent...really top notch.  I never tire of Oliver Reed and wish he had made many, many more films.  His portrayal of General Graziani was crisp.  Reed's character had a commanding presence of that of a professional soldier that had served Italy from the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, to World War I and then as supreme Italian commander in North Africa during World War II.  His character was certainly one of ambition and military professionalism.  Without getting into the actual historical/political aspects, I will point out that Graziani was responsible for many military innovations in not only desert but also guerrilla warfare.  Graziani, did, after get his Ho Chi Minh or Osama Bin Laden, and this has been largely ignored by history because of the Italian affiliation with Fascism, Hitler, and becoming in time an enemy commander to the United States, Britain and the other allies.Anthony Quinn's portrayal of Omar Mukhtar was astounding.  He even looked like him and kudos to the director for including actual photographs of the major personages in this sad true life play.  Gentle, intelligent, devoted to his God, merciful as his God claims to be...Quinn brought all of that out in his character and one can only hope that Mukhtar was exactly such a man.Rod Steiger-another actor, who like Oliver Reed, is unfortunately not well known by the general public.  His portrayal of Mussolini was excellent in spite of the ever pervasive myopia film makers have concerning Hitler and Mussolini-cardboard men painted with theirs and our propaganda.  Still, the film injected some humanity in the portrayal of 'Il Duce' by having Steiger point out that he, like Mukhtar, was a teacher.  Other than that, you could imagine Mussolini's character stiffly posturing on a balcony and spouting off about the glories of a New Roman Empire.  But, that wasn't Steiger's fault and he just naturally acted in a manner of supreme authority while at the same time coming across as being pragmatic, thoughtful, and having a connection to Roman history while at the same time making history.The Italians in general were rather plastic and stiffly portrayed, but acting as professional military officers and representatives of the Fascist state, these portrayals were probably not too far off the mark.  The film was careful to not show the Italians as mechanistic monsters and through at least four supporting actors showed that they were human beings capable of compassion.  The portrayal of the Bedouin fighters and people was much more human and realistic, and the sympathy of the film definitely tilted in their favor.  All in all, the film did try to show both sides of the story.Perhaps the most heart wrenching parts dealt with the sacrifices of men's lives in trying to defend their families and the hardships and deaths brought upon the civilian populace.  Particularly sad was the plight of the Bedouin in the concentration camps, and especially the sexual exploitation of women prisoners at the hands of the Italian soldiers.I found one of the most stirring parts of the film to be the trial of Omar Mukhtar.  The Italian defense lawyer (an Italian Army officer) did his best to point out that an acquittal was the most just thing to do as Mukhtar should have been considered to be a POW since he was taken under arms.  This portion was strangely reminiscent of the Breaker Morant trial.What I found particularly interesting was the array of authentic uniforms of the Italian Army and even the inclusion of Black Italian Colonial soldiers (probably Ethiopians?).  Even better was the fact that the film makers recreated armored vehicles of the time rather than merely using surplus military hardware and trying to pass them off as the real deal as they disappointingly did in otherwise great war films such as Patton and The Battle of the Bulge.The battle scenes were indeed good 'shootemups', though dummies dressed as Italian soldiers were painfully obvious in some shots.  Also, I think one armored vehicle taking to the air and crashing in a heap during a battle scene was more than enough.All in all a great film that at least informs us of something of history that most of us in the West would not otherwise be aware of.  It is refreshing to see a film maker doing his very best to show the human aspects of an enemy that he certainly is not sympathetic to on cultural and religious grounds and is a testament to his own sense of humanity.",5,Wow!

2867,A2ONX15N6TWDR,0764006584,Vincenzo L.,"[6, 6]","Moustapha Akkad, who produced the ""Halloween"" series is a Syrian-born filmmaker who has two ambitious epic films as a director. His first, the relatively forgotten film The ""Message"", about Mohammed and the Koran - a huge success worldwide, which also deserves a stellar review. Then, Akkad persuaded then Libyan dictator Molomar Qaddafi to invest thirty-five million dollars in the war epic ""Lion of the Desert"".... One of the largest financial disasters in film history, despite being one of the greatest films on the topic ever made.Anthony Quinn portrays the Libyan Guerrilla fighter ""Omar Mukhtar"" who pledged his (as well as his countrymen) life to drive the invading Italian forces out.The story depicts post World War 1, pre WW2 era where Benito Mussolini (played by Rod Steiger) tries carving up the globe with empires for Italy. He uses Libya as an ""easy"" stepping stone to the the Middle East (Libya's occupation was not started by him.. funny and demagogically enough the young Mussolini demonstrated against the occupation of Libya in 1911).Mukhtar, the village teacher, on the other hand made this difficult and was so successful waging his campaign against the Italians, that Mussolini sends in his top general ""The Butcher"" Graziani, played deliciously by the late Sir Oliver Reed (the Trap 1966, The Four Musketeers 1974, Gladiator 2000 and many more) to straighten things out.First, the Italians just ""tour"" Libya, raiding, burning, killing and raping... but when an entire attack convoy is completely wiped out by rebels, Graziani decides to wage an all-out war against Libyans. Graziani pretends to come to terms with Mukhtar, but, at the same time, brings thousands of fresh Italian troops to Tripoli and marches them inland. He is the first general to use planes and tanks in the desert, destroying town after town. This way he successfully corners Mukhtar and his rebels in the mountains.Historically accurate, in its portrayal of the Italian army and of the campaign itself, Lion of the Desert is an action packed, nearly (I say nearly..) flawless epic war film.Rod Steiger starts with some over-acting marching around his offices barking at people. But the film quickly shifts towards the vastness and splendor of the Sahara desert. It has excellent action sequences, that employ splendid special effects and lots of stunt work.On top of this, it's one of the bloodiest war films of its time, with bullet wounds spraying blood across the camera lens and people smashed to pulp by Italian tanks as they ride over them in the sand. God knows how this film faded away with a mediocre rating, but then again no one really saw the film in theaters right?  In Italy this film was banned by the government.The film is also a fascinating portrayal of the Arabs way of life and how it conflicts with European ideals.The musical score of this film, by Maurice Jarre (Lawrence of Arabia), is only great at times, but often seems uninspired and lame compared to his previous works on David Lean's great films.The cinematography and editing are classy, (one con though.. the cameras seemed a little shy of hanging around close to the big gasoline truck explosion. The best scenes in the film are battle scenes, one involving a vast army of extras destroying a nearly helpless Arab village, another with Graziani's army battling the Libyans for control of a mountain bridge. Other than those two, I can't say great about the 3 or so other battle scenes (compared to these two). The overall effect of battle scenes is quite satisfying.The cast of this film, doesn't lack for big-names either: Irene Papas and Sir John Gielgud in the roles of  Mukhtar's friends - though they truly deserved more screen time. Then, there's a fantastic lot of the old Italian B-movie stars in small roles as Italian soldiers and aides... Raf Vallone, Gaston Moschin, Stefano Patrizi and Sky du Mont to name a few.Akkad's strong point seems to be showing Italian artillery blowing the bewildered Bedouin warriors while his weak point seems to be spending the money on a film that people were just unable or unwilling to see. With a government ban, and insufficient theater releases, it is no surprise this movie lost money.Lion of the Desert despite its weak box office sales is a truly fantastic film; well thought out, brilliantly acted, authentic and historically accurate, and breath taking in its scale.  This film really does shine as brilliantly now as it could have when it was originally released - perhaps more so today.",5,As Brilliant Today as it was when it was released,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,4520,"['Moustapha', 'Akkad', 'who', 'produced', 'Halloween', 'series', 'Syrian-born', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'two', 'ambitious', 'epic', 'films', 'director', 'first', 'relatively', 'forgotten', 'film', 'Message', 'Mohammed', 'Koran', 'huge', 'success', 'worldwide', 'also', 'stellar', 'review', 'Then', 'Akkad', 'persuaded', 'then', 'Libyan', 'dictator', 'Molomar', 'Qaddafi', 'invest', 'thirty-five', 'million', 'dollars', 'war', 'epic', 'Lion', 'Desert', 'One', 'largest', 'financial', 'disasters', 'film', 'history', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'topic', 'ever', 'made.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Libyan', 'Guerrilla', 'fighter', 'Omar', 'Mukhtar', 'who', 'pledged', 'as', 'well', 'countrymen', 'life', 'drive', 'invading', 'Italian', 'forces', 'out.The', 'story', 'depicts', 'post', 'World', 'War', '1', 'pre', 'WW2', 'era', 'where', 'Benito', 'Mussolini', 'played', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'carving', 'up', 'globe', 'empires', 'Italy', 'Libya', 'easy', 'stepping', 'stone', 'Middle', 'East', 'Libya', 'occupation', 'was', 'not', 'started', 'him..', 'funny', 'demagogically', 'enough', 'young', 'Mussolini', 'demonstrated', 'occupation', 'Libya', '1911', '.Mukhtar', 'village', 'teacher', 'other', 'hand', 'made', 'difficult', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'waging', 'campaign', 'Italians', 'Mussolini', 'top', 'general', 'Butcher', 'Graziani', 'played', 'deliciously', 'late', 'Sir', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Trap', '1966', 'Four', 'Musketeers', '1974', 'Gladiator', '2000', 'many', 'more', 'straighten', 'things', 'out.First', 'Italians', 'just', 'tour', 'Libya', 'raiding', 'burning', 'killing', 'raping', 'when', 'entire', 'attack', 'convoy', 'completely', 'wiped', 'out', 'rebels', 'Graziani', 'wage', 'all-out', 'war', 'Libyans', 'Graziani', 'come', 'terms', 'Mukhtar', 'same', 'time', 'thousands', 'fresh', 'Italian', 'troops', 'Tripoli', 'inland', 'first', 'general', 'use', 'planes', 'tanks', 'desert', 'destroying', 'town', 'town', 'way', 'successfully', 'Mukhtar', 'rebels', 'mountains.Historically', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Italian', 'army', 'campaign', 'Lion', 'Desert', 'action', 'packed', 'nearly', 'say', 'nearly..', 'flawless', 'epic', 'war', 'film.Rod', 'Steiger', 'over-acting', 'marching', 'offices', 'barking', 'people', 'film', 'quickly', 'shifts', 'vastness', 'splendor', 'Sahara', 'desert', 'excellent', 'action', 'sequences', 'employ', 'splendid', 'special', 'effects', 'lots', 'stunt', 'work.On', 'top', 'one', 'bloodiest', 'war', 'films', 'time', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'spraying', 'blood', 'camera', 'people', 'smashed', 'pulp', 'Italian', 'tanks', 'ride', 'sand', 'God', 'how', 'film', 'faded', 'away', 'mediocre', 'rating', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'really', 'saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'right', 'Italy', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'government.The', 'film', 'also', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'Arabs', 'way', 'life', 'how', 'European', 'ideals.The', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'only', 'great', 'times', 'often', 'uninspired', 'lame', 'compared', 'previous', 'works', 'David', 'Lean', 'great', 'films.The', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'classy', 'one', 'con', 'cameras', 'seemed', 'little', 'shy', 'hanging', 'around', 'close', 'big', 'gasoline', 'truck', 'explosion', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'battle', 'scenes', 'one', 'involving', 'vast', 'army', 'extras', 'destroying', 'nearly', 'helpless', 'Arab', 'village', 'Graziani', 'army', 'battling', 'Libyans', 'control', 'mountain', 'bridge', 'Other', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', '3', 'so', 'other', 'battle', 'scenes', 'compared', 'two', 'overall', 'effect', 'battle', 'scenes', 'quite', 'satisfying.The', 'cast', 'film', ""n't"", 'lack', 'big-names', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'roles', 'Mukhtar', 'friends', 'truly', 'deserved', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Then', 'fantastic', 'lot', 'old', 'Italian', 'B-movie', 'stars', 'small', 'roles', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'aides', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'Gaston', 'Moschin', 'Stefano', 'Patrizi', 'Sky', 'du', 'Mont', 'name', 'few.Akkad', 'strong', 'point', 'be', 'showing', 'Italian', 'artillery', 'blowing', 'bewildered', 'Bedouin', 'warriors', 'weak', 'point', 'be', 'spending', 'money', 'film', 'people', 'were', 'just', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'see', 'government', 'ban', 'insufficient', 'theater', 'releases', 'surprise', 'movie', 'lost', 'money.Lion', 'Desert', 'weak', 'box', 'office', 'sales', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'film', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'authentic', 'historically', 'accurate', 'breath', 'taking', 'scale', 'film', 'really', 'shine', 'brilliantly', 'now', 'could', 'have', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'today']",N/A
