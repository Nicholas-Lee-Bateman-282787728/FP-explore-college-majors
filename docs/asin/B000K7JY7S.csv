1030982,A1AJBAYZGV2EJW,B000K7JY7S,a believer,"[7, 7]","My friends and I have gotten a lot of use out of the ""You"" books and materials, and this DVD is no exception.  I really admire the two physicians who have pulled together this comprehensive program in order to help Americans get back in shape at an affordable price.  They really want to help people and they make that obvious by encouraging you to ""burn"" copies of this DVD for your friends.  There are, of course, LOTS of exercise DVD's out there, but this is a good place to start, particularly, if you haven't done much exercising lately.  The trainer gives good instructions and though, he is in good shape, he really works up a sweat in the advanced portion of the DVD.  I found the quality, color, and sound of the DVD to be excellent, also, and it's really great to be able to make so much progress WITHOUT the use and expense of exercise equipment.  Once you have mastered this DVD (and it may take awhile), you can always find something more challenging later, if you find it necessary. For the price, I think it's a good investment and a good deal.",5,Very Pleased,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1059,"['friends', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'use', 'books', 'materials', 'DVD', 'exception', 'really', 'admire', 'two', 'physicians', 'who', 'have', 'pulled', 'together', 'comprehensive', 'program', 'order', 'help', 'Americans', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'affordable', 'price', 'really', 'want', 'help', 'people', 'make', 'obvious', 'encouraging', 'burn', 'copies', 'DVD', 'friends', 'are', 'course', 'LOTS', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'there', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'particularly', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'exercising', 'lately', 'trainer', 'good', 'instructions', 'though', 'good', 'shape', 'really', 'up', 'sweat', 'advanced', 'portion', 'DVD', 'found', 'quality', 'color', 'sound', 'DVD', 'be', 'excellent', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'progress', 'use', 'expense', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'Once', 'have', 'mastered', 'DVD', 'may', 'take', 'awhile', 'can', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'challenging', 'later', 'find', 'necessary', 'price', 'think', 'good', 'investment', 'good', 'deal']",YOU: ON A DIET WORKOUT

However, I found the instructor to be incredibly annoying, enough so that I only did the workout twice.  He's condescending and smug.  He was patronizing to the woman who was doing most of the actual exercises while he stood there and lectured.  His counting method is stupid--he'll be counting down, then he'll repeat a number over and over (12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8).  I find that incredibly insulting and demotivating.
