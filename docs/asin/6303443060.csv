If only Laurence Olivier had his stage presence! If only Richard Burton had his voice! If only Clifton Webb had his acerbic wit! Yes, Elvis Presley was a thespian for the ages. The greatest actor who ever lived! Oh, how he filled the screen---especially in his latter years. In particular, his performance in the deeply touching, highly philosophical film &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; is one to be cherished by film and theatre aficionados of all ages, creeds, and cultures. What style! What grace! What announciation and articulation! Indeed, Elvis is every bit the equal of John Barrymore, Richard Mansfield, and John Gielgud in their prime. The only one of Elvis's sophisticated, allegorical performances that might possibly equal this remarkable spewing of dialogue is his masterful characterization in &quot;Tickle Me!&quot; Was the stage play for this literary masterpiece ever performed at the Old Vic? Of course, truth be told, Elvis was a phenomenal actor in every one of his matchless films---and to think that a guitar popped up in each one no matter what the setting or plot! Truly a miraculous performer. The man should have won at least a dozen Academy Awards as Best Actor. Who could ever forget the King uttering such romantic, poetic, tender phrases like &quot;Uh, huh.&quot; No wonder all the women here at the Skunk Creek Geriatric Center find him so irresistable! I bow to his genius. A greater singer than Caruso! A greater actor than Olivier! A greater dancer than Astaire!

GIRLS! isn't one of Elvis Presley's most distinguished screen outings; but it provides a pleasant diversion nevertheless.Set amongst the islands of Hawaii, Presley plays tuna-fisherman/tour-guide Ross Carpenter, trying to make ends meet so he can buy his dream boat and go into business for himself.  Adding complications is Carpenter's love triangle with two very different dames: jaded nightclub singer Robin (Stella Stevens), and young heiress Laurel (Laurel Goodwin), who's looking to experience life on the other side of the social divide.Presley gets to sing no less than fourteen(!) musical numbers.  Laurel Goodwin (a snub-nosed Debbie Reynolds clone) is quite pretty but fails to make any lasting impression.  Producers really dropped a clanger in letting vivacious Stella Stevens go to waste in a thankless supporting role; she deserved better material here.  Stevens' singing was dubbed by Gilda Maiken.With it's exotic location filming and the charm of Presley, GIRLS! GIRLS!

The first trip was the result of disappointing box office returns for two consecutive *serious* (and impressive) films, yielding ""Blue Hawaii"" which made a fortune. The two consecutive follow-up films again showed a dramatic Presley and...""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" And more girls. And more and more songs. About four are pretty good. In fact, the late add-in ""Return To Sender"" was an instant Classic and the title tune was a groovy uptempo reading of a ""lost"" Coasters song. A slight, but smooth beat ballad, ""Because Of Love"", is delivered in a beautifully photographed sequence at a club. Director Norman Taurog should be commended for providing Elvis with professional lighting and staging. In short, ol' El looks like a million! There a many, many examples of Presley movie songs where he is forced to work in too much or too little light and with goofy characters mugging in his spotlight.Apparently based on a teen novel ""Mister Will You Marry Me?"" this movie has much of the color and feeling of its' predecessor. Like BH the soundtrack contains too many ballads but unlike BH here they are poorly recorded. (Though the ""flat"" mix does lend to the seafaring atmosphere.).Despite the obvious artistic dilemma this effort, like many in Elvis' movie catalogue, deserves a second chance. His acting his excellent throughout; by '62 he has become a relaxed actor, handling the light assignment with enthusiasm and intensity and as usual he elevates the proceedings. Unfortunately there are about four production numbers which should have been placed on the shelf - especially ""The Walls Have Ears"" entry. Though spirited, the Elvis' and Laurel Goodwins' dancing comes off a bit amateurish. It's just one of many spots which could have been deleted so as to reduce the 106 minute playing time.Yes, it's for deep fans only. But that's not a negative comment![By the way, historians, check out the GoodTimes video ""Elvis - King Of Entertainment"" for a rare short interview with Elvis as he arrives at the airport in Hawaii, just prior to filming. Another GoodTimes video ""Elvis In The Movies"" contains the ""Girls! Girls!.."" trailor which includes a deleted scene with a nice moody ballad called ""I Don't Want To"" - one which *should* have been included!].",3,The formula goes full speed ahead,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,2282,"['was', 'back', 'Hawaii', ""'62"", 'first', 'trip', 'was', 'result', 'disappointing', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'two', 'consecutive', '*serious*', 'impressive', 'films', 'yielding', 'Blue', 'Hawaii', 'made', 'fortune', 'two', 'consecutive', 'follow-up', 'films', 'again', 'showed', 'dramatic', 'Presley', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'more', 'girls', 'more', 'more', 'songs', 'four', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'fact', 'late', 'add-in', 'Return', 'Sender', 'was', 'instant', 'Classic', 'title', 'tune', 'was', 'groovy', 'uptempo', 'reading', 'lost', 'Coasters', 'song', 'slight', 'smooth', 'beat', 'ballad', 'Love', 'delivered', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'sequence', 'club', 'Director', 'Norman', 'Taurog', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'providing', 'Elvis', 'professional', 'lighting', 'staging', 'short', 'ol', 'El', 'million', 'many', 'many', 'examples', 'Presley', 'movie', 'songs', 'where', 'forced', 'work', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'light', 'goofy', 'characters', 'mugging', 'spotlight.Apparently', 'based', 'teen', 'novel', 'Mister', 'Will', 'Marry', 'movie', 'much', 'color', 'feeling', 'predecessor', 'BH', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'many', 'ballads', 'BH', 'here', 'are', 'poorly', 'recorded', 'flat', 'mix', 'lend', 'seafaring', 'atmosphere', '.Despite', 'obvious', 'artistic', 'dilemma', 'effort', 'many', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'catalogue', 'second', 'chance', 'acting', 'excellent', ""'62"", 'become', 'relaxed', 'actor', 'handling', 'light', 'assignment', 'enthusiasm', 'intensity', 'as', 'usual', 'proceedings', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'four', 'production', 'numbers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'shelf', 'especially', 'Walls', 'Have', 'Ears', 'entry', 'spirited', 'Elvis', 'Laurel', 'Goodwins', 'dancing', 'off', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'spots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'so', 'reduce', '106', 'minute', 'playing', 'time.Yes', 'deep', 'fans', 'only', 'not', 'negative', 'comment', '[', 'way', 'historians', 'check', 'out', 'GoodTimes', 'video', 'Elvis', 'King', 'Entertainment', 'rare', 'short', 'interview', 'Elvis', 'airport', 'Hawaii', 'just', 'prior', 'filming', 'GoodTimes', 'video', 'Elvis', 'Movies', 'Girls', 'Girls', '..', 'trailor', 'deleted', 'scene', 'nice', 'moody', 'ballad', 'called', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'included', ']']",Girls!

Elvis sings the song, ""Goodbye Momma Shrimp"" in falsetto and plays a ukelele. He gets into the song joyfully and with the spirit he has it makes the men sing with him. This is one of the highlights of the movie. Many times girls swarm around the sea captain because of his charm. One day a woman comes onto the pier wanting to take a boat out but the captain refuses to do this at first. A little later he gives in and they board the boat and the captain drives the boat. They have an affair which makes the girls angry with him, but at the end everything turns out alright. Elvis singing is rich and appealing in this movie.

(1962), a film that despite its title, actually features just two women in major roles.  Laurel Goodwin makes her big screen debut as a woman from a wealthy family having trouble with finding a man she can trust, while sexy Stella Stevens stars as a lounge singer who has her own issues with men.Presley play Ross Carpenter, a fisherman and tour boat operator, who suddenly finds himself in a bind, when his employer has to sell his fleet of four boats and move to Arizona for health reasons.  The ambitious and smooth talking Carpenter, makes a deal with Wesley Johnson (Jeremy Slate) the new owner of the fleet, to captain the Westwind, a boat that Carpenter built together with his father.  As captain of the Westwind, Ross gets a share of the profits made from fishing.  With the money, he hopes to eventually buy the Westwind.Ross is in a club run by his pal Sam Anderson (Robert Strauss,Stalag 17), visiting with Robin Gauntner (Stevens), an old flame who is a lounge singer there, when Laurel Dodge (Goodwin) takes a fancy to him.  She follows him out onto the street, and eventually they begin a relationship.When Ross' first fishing run proves not to be successful, he turns to singing in Anderson's club to supplement his income, which causes problems with both Laurel and Robin.  It turns that Laurel comes from a wealthy family, and with some help from her father, she buys the Westwind intending to give it to Ross, but his pride is won't allow him to accept.A Chinese family headed by Benson Fong (Flower Drum Song) are Ross's closest friends.  UnlikeBlue Hawaii(1961) and Paradise Hawaiian Style (1966), besides the scenes featuring the harbor and ocean, local Hawaiian locations and the island lifestyle isn't really spotlighted to the same extent.  Musically, the big hit Return To Sender is well done, although the performances of some of the other songs is not that great.For whatever reasons, the producers of the Presley films occasionally chose to feature an unknown actress as Elvis' leading lady.  Laurel Goodwin does a decent job here.  She's young, innocent looking, and sugary sweet, sometimes almost annoying so, but she would never again have a lead role in a major film.  Stella Stevens has the looks, talent, and fiery personality to make a good match with Elvis, but she's really underused, and not that convincing when pretending to sing.  Jeremy Slate's character turns out to be a bit of a wolf, although he does give Ross a chance, and takes rejection and defeat in stride.It's slightly more serious than his other films set in Hawaii, and the story could probably have used some additional work, but Girls! Girls! Girls! is mostly the light kind of fluff that would soon become typical for Elvis Presley.",3,the high point of Laurel Goodwin's acting career...,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,2855,"['Elvis', 'Presley', 'back', 'Aloha', 'State', 'fisherman', 'big', 'financial', 'worries', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'Girls', '1962', 'film', 'title', 'actually', 'just', 'two', 'women', 'major', 'roles', 'Laurel', 'Goodwin', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'woman', 'wealthy', 'family', 'having', 'trouble', 'finding', 'man', 'can', 'trust', 'sexy', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'lounge', 'singer', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'men.Presley', 'play', 'Ross', 'Carpenter', 'fisherman', 'tour', 'boat', 'operator', 'who', 'suddenly', 'bind', 'when', 'employer', 'sell', 'fleet', 'four', 'boats', 'move', 'Arizona', 'health', 'reasons', 'ambitious', 'smooth', 'talking', 'Carpenter', 'deal', 'Wesley', 'Johnson', 'Jeremy', 'Slate', 'new', 'owner', 'fleet', 'captain', 'Westwind', 'boat', 'Carpenter', 'built', 'together', 'father', 'captain', 'Westwind', 'Ross', 'share', 'profits', 'made', 'fishing', 'money', 'eventually', 'buy', 'Westwind.Ross', 'club', 'run', 'pal', 'Sam', 'Anderson', 'Robert', 'Strauss', 'Stalag', '17', 'visiting', 'Robin', 'Gauntner', 'Stevens', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'lounge', 'singer', 'there', 'when', 'Laurel', 'Dodge', 'Goodwin', 'fancy', 'out', 'street', 'eventually', 'begin', 'relationship.When', 'Ross', 'first', 'fishing', 'run', 'not', 'be', 'successful', 'singing', 'Anderson', 'club', 'supplement', 'income', 'problems', 'Laurel', 'Robin', 'Laurel', 'wealthy', 'family', 'help', 'father', 'Westwind', 'intending', 'give', 'Ross', 'pride', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'accept.A', 'Chinese', 'family', 'headed', 'Benson', 'Fong', 'Flower', 'Drum', 'Song', 'are', 'Ross', 'closest', 'friends', 'UnlikeBlue', 'Hawaii', '1961', 'Paradise', 'Hawaiian', 'Style', '1966', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'harbor', 'ocean', 'local', 'Hawaiian', 'locations', 'island', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'really', 'spotlighted', 'same', 'extent', 'Musically', 'big', 'hit', 'Return', 'Sender', 'well', 'done', 'performances', 'other', 'songs', 'not', 'great.For', 'reasons', 'producers', 'Presley', 'films', 'occasionally', 'chose', 'feature', 'unknown', 'actress', 'Elvis', 'leading', 'lady', 'Laurel', 'Goodwin', 'decent', 'job', 'here', 'young', 'innocent', 'looking', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'annoying', 'so', 'would', 'never', 'again', 'have', 'lead', 'role', 'major', 'film', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'looks', 'talent', 'fiery', 'personality', 'make', 'good', 'match', 'Elvis', 'really', 'underused', 'not', 'convincing', 'when', 'pretending', 'sing', 'Jeremy', 'Slate', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'wolf', 'give', 'Ross', 'chance', 'rejection', 'defeat', 'stride.It', 'slightly', 'more', 'serious', 'other', 'films', 'set', 'Hawaii', 'story', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'used', 'additional', 'work', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'mostly', 'light', 'kind', 'fluff', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'typical', 'Elvis', 'Presley']",Girls!
