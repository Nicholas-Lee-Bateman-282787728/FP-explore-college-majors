They began interviewing ministers and just when they were about to give up hope in walks this young minister packing a powerful punch.  The play toggles back and forth between good and evil.

893207,A21XVS00AIENLX,B0007X9UGA,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[3, 4]","Unlike any of Tyler Perry's features, this play has themes that are much darker and edgier.  I don't recommend showing this to young children.  There are a couple scenes in which church members are either shot or threatened with weapons by gangsters.  No blood, of course, but the actions are very apparent.The script has a bit of a haphazard to slow start before getting to the crux of the story, and the rag tag members of the True Vine church are not characters one would seem to sympathize with except for the new pastor who seems to have the only real zeal of faith to make things happen.Perhaps it was as director/writer David Talbert had envisioned.  He is able to depict the very raw and seedy side of the Detroit Streets.  The actor who plays Demetrius plays his gangster role so well and so powerfully, you cannot help but hating his antagonizing character.  He is a thug, and he is mean.But the play does have a redemptive quality.  Crime boss Satin Jones, played by Clifton Powell, is able to repent of his ways.  His monologue at the end of the play is done with the right pace, intensity and interpretation.  At one point he breaks character as chokes tearfully in emotion and has a hard time delivering his next line, but it just made the scene that much better.Not the uplifting in rejoice ending you would be expecting, but there is a silver lining to this cloud.

Recommended viewing. One more thing, I started watching David Talbert before getting in on Tyler; I won't compare but I will say that I thank God for the both of them and that there is room for them both;",5,Awesome,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,1151,"['just', 'bought', 'play', 'today', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'tonight', 'liked', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'end', 'have', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Satin', 'Jones', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'bar', 'sits', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'church', 'underling', 'becomes', 'too', 'ambitious', 'take', 'over', 'church', 'pastor', 'already', 'gunned', 'down', 'confrontation', 'Satin', 'ready', 'close', 'property', 'church', 'next', 'door', 'expand', 'territory', 'when', 'people', 'wait', 'associate', 'direct', 'opposition', 'what', 'Satin', 'said', 'church', 'members', 'up', 'new', 'preacher', 'church', 'even', 'love', 'thing', 'preacher', 'one', 'members', 'ending', 'play', 'absolute', 'best', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'What', 'learned', 'most', 'play', 'matter', 'how', 'things', 'may', 'look', 'seem', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'up', 'being', 'down', 'Recommended', 'viewing', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'started', 'watching', 'David', 'Talbert', 'getting', 'Tyler', 'wo', ""n't"", 'compare', 'will', 'say', 'thank', 'God', 'room']",N/A
