971732,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EDWKX8,A Customer,"[9, 10]","Shop Girl is such an ""LA"" film. Not only is it set in Los Angeles, but the film also evokes the city's very unique sensibility. Based on Steve Martin's best-selling novella, Shop Girl is all about big city isolation and loneliness and looking for love in all the wrong places. Working from a script by Martin, director Anand Tucker has made a quiet, delicate and nuanced film, featuring some fine performances from its three very appealing leads.Claire Danes plays Mirabelle, a beautiful, dreamy and messed-up artistic young woman who sells gloves for evening wear at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills and lives in a quaint apartment in the suburb of Silver Lake (just down the street from where we live!).Lately, Mirabelle has been having a hard time of it - her student loans have been piling up, and she's been suffering from bouts of depression; it's as though she's been spending all her time in Los Angeles just waiting for something to happen, her situation endemic of the routine isolation experienced by women who drive to and from their solitary apartments, perhaps hoping someone eventually will offer them love.One night at the local launderette she meets the emotionally immature and unkempt Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman). Jeremy is your typical Silver Lake urban grunge, who earns his living decorating amplifiers for rock bands and lives like a pig. He's far too unsophisticated for the lovely Mirabelle, yet they are both artists and the same age so a connection gradually develops.However, it is the older and far wealthier Ray Porter (Steve Martin) that really beguiles Mirabelle. Ray takes an instant liking to her when he purchases a pair of gloves. Ray is so much more appealing. A dot-com millionaire with mansions in L.A. and Seattle, a private jet and enough money to make a girl feel like Cinderella every night, he's made Mirabelle the envy of all the other girls at Saks Fifth Avenue, especially vamp Lisa (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). Ray steadily showers Mirabelle with gifts whilst, making it perfectly clear that this is a casual relationship.The stage is set for a love triangle, with the sensitive and easily hurt Mirabelle, facing some harsh decisions about who to love. Obviously, Jeremy is not right for Mirabelle the way he is; he's ambitionless and cheap, and a bit of a dummy. Only through reinventing himself will Jeremy ever have any hope of obtaining Mirabelle's love. Ray may be rich, but he's also rather cold, and insensitive to Mirabelle's feelings - most importantly he remains non-committal.But are Jeremy and Ray really that different? Mirabelle must learn to make love the basis, and assess how well each man gives it as well as receive it. She's an intelligent, perceptive and intuitive girl, who knows what she's getting into, but she finds herself getting caught up in a situation that she's just not able to emotionally handle.Whilst the plot is a bit lightweight and feathery, the movie is mostly buoyed by the performances of Danes, Schwartzman and Martin - who is very good at playing against his comedic type. Danes beautifully captures the affecting, fragile inner quality of Mirabelle's life. It's a brilliantly understated performance that never resorts to histrionics or mawkishness. She gives her heart even when it is broken but never pleads for our sympathy.Martin plays Ray Porter with a calm coldness and he's obviously a successful businessman who seems to have sufficient funds to do whatever he wants. But he's also lonely and bored and somewhat shut down emotionally; Ray knows Mirabelle's isolated. He's able to spend money on her, but never in ways that feel tawdry and you never get the feeling that he's just being a ""sugar daddy"" - there's real love and affection there.And then there's the marvelous Jason Schwartzman as Jeremy. He's a sweet and kind young man, but he has no idea how to seduce a woman and it is only by going on a kind of spiritual road trip that he can learn how to elevate himself to Mirabelle's stature. The film does have it's faults - the soundtrack is a little heavy-handed, and Tucker lays the sentiment and pathos on when he doesn't really need to, but the movie is always compelling and we get to the see the lovely Claire Danes shimmer vintage dresses and high heel shoes, she also drives a pick-up truck and puts on glasses.For local viewers, Shop Girl provides some great scenes set in and around the funky Silver Lake and there are also the dreamy and poetic views of the City of Angels to admire. Cinematographer Peter Suschitzky infuses his camera work with a deep sense of longing, as though Mirabelle's tale is just one of the many stories beneath the swaying palms and roaring expressways of people who just want to be loved.

Frankly, that 'wild and crazy' Steve Martin has been making increasingly dreadful movie decisions over the past decade, resulting in dreck like his recent attempt at a 'Pink Panther' re-make.I think the serious Steve Martin - the one that pens fiction like 'Shopgirl', writes the screenplay, subsumes his ego to director Anand Tucker, plays his part in the subdued fashion the role calls for, openly speaks about being 'too old' for the part and contemplates Tom Hanks as a better choice - well, I suspect he secretly hates the other Steve Martin.  And, as a result, the fans (like me) of his *other* work are the beneficiaries.  With 'Shopgirl', he's concocted the third chapter of what is now an LA Trilogy of sorts - 'LA Story', 'Bowfinger' and this latest work.For those of you wanting goofy comedy from Martin, you'll get it here from Jason Schwartzman, who steals the movie (and Martin no doubt welcomes him to it).  Director Tucker says he had a vision of Schwartzman from 'Rushmore' and immediately recognized that he had found his 'Jeremy Kraft.'  He was dead right.  Schwartzman's transformation in the film is convincing and it's easy to see why he's an attractive suitor for Danes' Mirabelle.",4,A fan of Steve Martin's LA Trilogy,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1433,"['Reviewers', 'here', 'save', 'grateful', 'fans', '1991', 'masterpiece', 'Story', 'seem', 'like', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'better', 'goofy', 'persona', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'etc', 'reject', 'attempt', 'be', 'serious', 'Frankly', ""'wild"", 'crazy', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'been', 'making', 'increasingly', 'dreadful', 'movie', 'decisions', 'past', 'decade', 'resulting', 'dreck', 'recent', 'attempt', ""'Pink"", 'Panther', 're-make.I', 'think', 'serious', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'one', 'fiction', ""'Shopgirl"", 'screenplay', 'ego', 'director', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'part', 'subdued', 'fashion', 'role', 'openly', 'being', ""'too"", 'old', 'part', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'better', 'choice', 'well', 'suspect', 'secretly', 'other', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'result', 'fans', '*other*', 'work', 'are', 'beneficiaries', ""'Shopgirl"", 'concocted', 'third', 'chapter', 'what', 'now', 'LA', 'Trilogy', 'sorts', ""'LA"", 'Story', ""'Bowfinger"", 'latest', 'work.For', 'wanting', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'Martin', ""'ll"", 'get', 'here', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'movie', 'Martin', 'doubt', 'Director', 'Tucker', 'had', 'vision', 'Schwartzman', ""'Rushmore"", 'immediately', 'recognized', 'had', 'found', ""'Jeremy"", 'Kraft', 'was', 'dead', 'right', 'Schwartzman', 'transformation', 'film', 'convincing', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'attractive', 'suitor', 'Danes', 'Mirabelle']",N/A

For me,it's one of those lovely flawed little movies you catch at 3 a.m., thinking, ""hmm, not bad... could've been even more...""It's a good movie, overall. A solid ""worth seeing.""  Claire Danes is lovely and luminous and just wonderful.  Martin is OK as the suitor.  Schwartzman is pretty much terrible despite almost saving things in the last 10 minutes. I did actually like the irony of Martin as narrator -- hey, the guy is detached, it's his defining quality, so I loved his ""narrating"" events as we saw them with an ironic sensitivity the character himself was lacking.On the negative side, I have to say that I felt that Steve Martin (while his book was a slight, lovely treasure) may have not been exactly the right choice for the film's Ray.  He is so aloof it's hard to gauge his feelings from afar, much less for poor clueless Mirabelle. He's like an icecube. Yet I still bought the relationship and liked his character (he's very interesting and bizarrely realistic).But speaking of realism (or not)... My main problem with the film is with Schwartzman's character, who is not just ""clueless,"" he is basically autistic or was raised by wolves or monkeys or something. The guy is gross, unkempt, cannot even go on a decent date with Mirabelle without embarrassing or mooching off her. He's a skit unto himself. He's embarrassingly crass and seems to have no idea of the beauty or coolness of Mirabelle in any way. A few rock self-help tapes later are supposed to transform him into a prince, but I don't buy it for a second. Even in the best of times with Mirabelle, I simply hoped that this guy had learned enough to shower.I liked Martin's novella, and love his other work (and adored ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile"" and ""The Pleasure of my Company"").  But my problem wasn't with Ray... we see his hollowness, his loneliness (affecting because he has no idea it exists), etc., throughout. I loved the scenes where he cared for Mirabelle beyond sex, the ways we saw he loved her without being able to articulate it.But for Schwartzman's gross stupid comedy relief guy to have any chance at being the prince, the movie needed a major rewrite.Worth seeing but prepare for an overly-intrusive score, and for a somewhat detached and slow (if often lovely) movie experience.",3,"Flawed, but worth a watch...",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2395,"[""'m"", 'such', 'fan', 'people', 'associated', 'even', 'disappointed', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'lovely', 'flawed', 'little', 'movies', 'catch', '3', 'a.m.', 'thinking', 'hmm', 'not', 'bad', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'more', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'solid', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'lovely', 'luminous', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Martin', 'OK', 'suitor', 'Schwartzman', 'pretty', 'much', 'terrible', 'almost', 'saving', 'things', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'did', 'actually', 'irony', 'Martin', 'narrator', 'hey', 'guy', 'detached', 'defining', 'quality', 'loved', 'narrating', 'events', 'saw', 'ironic', 'sensitivity', 'character', 'was', 'lacking.On', 'negative', 'side', 'have', 'say', 'felt', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'book', 'was', 'slight', 'lovely', 'treasure', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'exactly', 'right', 'choice', 'film', 'Ray', 'so', 'aloof', 'hard', 'gauge', 'feelings', 'afar', 'much', 'less', 'poor', 'clueless', 'Mirabelle', 'icecube', 'still', 'bought', 'relationship', 'liked', 'character', 'very', 'interesting', 'bizarrely', 'realistic', '.But', 'speaking', 'realism', 'not', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'Schwartzman', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'clueless', 'basically', 'autistic', 'was', 'raised', 'wolves', 'monkeys', 'something', 'guy', 'gross', 'unkempt', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'go', 'decent', 'date', 'Mirabelle', 'embarrassing', 'mooching', 'off', 'skit', 'unto', 'embarrassingly', 'crass', 'have', 'idea', 'beauty', 'coolness', 'Mirabelle', 'way', 'few', 'rock', 'self-help', 'tapes', 'later', 'are', 'supposed', 'transform', 'prince', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'second', 'Even', 'best', 'times', 'Mirabelle', 'simply', 'hoped', 'guy', 'had', 'learned', 'enough', 'shower.I', 'liked', 'Martin', 'novella', 'love', 'other', 'work', 'adored', 'Picasso', 'Lapin', 'Agile', 'Pleasure', 'Company', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'Ray', 'see', 'hollowness', 'loneliness', 'affecting', 'idea', 'etc.', 'loved', 'scenes', 'where', 'cared', 'Mirabelle', 'sex', 'ways', 'saw', 'loved', 'being', 'able', 'articulate', 'it.But', 'Schwartzman', 'gross', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'relief', 'guy', 'have', 'chance', 'being', 'prince', 'movie', 'needed', 'major', 'rewrite.Worth', 'seeing', 'prepare', 'overly-intrusive', 'score', 'somewhat', 'detached', 'slow', 'often', 'lovely', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A
971737,A1JLIG5EIQZMD0,B000EDWKX8,aquestari,"[3, 3]","Shopgirl. Romance, comedy, drama. Starring: Claire Danes, Steve Martin, Jason Schwartzman. Directed by: Anand Tucker. 104 minutes. English subtitles. M.It's not often you get a realistic, yet heartfelt and philosophical look at modern day romance, in the cinematic world. In amongst the tacky and the predictable films available in the romance and comedy genre, Shopgirl is a refreshing breath of fresh air mixing together a fun and amusing storyline whilst also pointing out some of life's realities and truths about love, dating, emotions and how two people can interpret a conversation and situation they are both in, entirely opposite to one another.Director Anand Tucker who is also known for participating in the creation of such movies as `Bridget Jone's Diary' and `Beyond The Sea' as well as writing and directing many of his own films has done a beautiful job of bringing Steve Martin's 2001 novel of the same title, to the big screen.Away from the busy, bustling excitement of the crowds downstairs in the department store Sacks where she works, Mirabelle Buttersfield is introduced to us as a lonely and bored glove sales girl, who while waiting patiently day after day for customers who barely make it to her counter because her area is not a popular choice for sales, yearns for something or someone special and promising to fill her life and longs for a magical romance like the ones she sees around her.Enter Jeremy, an awkward, sloppy yet well-meaning artist and `amp stamp' designer, who Mirabelle meets at a laundromat quite unexpectedly. The two embark on an uncomfortable, clumsy, yet semi-satisfying journey of dates and passion. Finally feeling wanted and needed, Mirabelle keeps coming back to him and cannot forget him even though she feels that he is not the right man for her.All of Mirabelle's dreams finally come true when she is propositioned by a suave and charming businessman, Ray Porter, who is the complete opposite of Jeremy. He showers her with extravagant gifts and gives her the tender and seemingly uncomplicated love that Jeremy failed to provide her, and in return she gives him her most treasured possession; her heart. But looks and charms can be deceiving. Mirabelle must come to terms with the realization that those in her life may not have her best interests at heart and figure out who her loyalties really belong to.The movie gives a deep and meaningful look at human growth and becoming a better person through the inspiration of others, and moments in life not being what they seem, but is also quite superficial in parts in regards to each character's worth as a person based on looks, status and wealth, which of course is only a truthful reflection of society's expectations and prejudices. However, there is the feeling throughout the film of the idea of the `perfect man' and changing who you are to fit this mould both physically and emotionally, being very important in order to gain the affections of someone you love in order not to be sidelined, rather than you and the ones around learning to love you for who you are.The settings of the film are laidback and moody with soft lighting and gentle darkness falling around places like Mirabelle's apartment and the outside areas to give a presence of mystery, sensuality and romance. Every piece of scenery has its' own unique specialty to make it fit with the scene and mostly gives a feeling of tranquility and peace, with the mixture of both the layout and lulling instrumental music. Objects are used in creative ways for symbolism like windscreen wipers hitting the sides of the window loudly when Mirabelle herself is very angry and disappointed, perhaps both to show her emotions and to give the impression that even her windscreen wipers are not perfect just like her life isn't, and seem to be against her, trying to drive her crazy.City lights are shown lit up all around from high above, every now and then to blend with the view that we are all connected with one another.Slow motion is used to dramatize scenes of happiness, sadness and even to symbolize thought, such as when Mirabelle is driving in her car and listening to a radio show which is discussing the type of hormones brought out when a person is embraced by their lover, the cars and street lights ahead of her move slowly as if she is deep in thought and coming to a life-changing realization.The music ranges from pretty, gentle taps of the xylophone and moody, melancholy strings from instruments such as the violin and piano, especially when Mirabelle and Ray are together, to give the sense of an uncertain but special new beginning, the music is upbeat and funky when both Jeremy and Ray ask Mirabelle out to give a feeling of excitement, breaking away from the mundane and getting what she's always wanted; some form of love.Claire, Jason and Steve's acting abilities really shine in this film. Each actor really becomes their character, whether it's with the scared, tortured looks of sorrow and uncertainty from Mirabelle's eyes, the intense, charismatic gazes from Ray or the awkward, embarrassing body language and actions from Jeremy, each actor is convincing and make for an entertaining watch.Shopgirl is a highly recommended film. Ranging from both dark and light, deep to humorous, it is a film that will strike and capture just about anyone's sensibilities.",4,"Life, Love and Loss: A Modern-Day Romantic

He is a wealthy, distinguished older gentleman, who is captivated by her youth and beauty.Taken by him also, she focuses all her romantic attentions on him.Here's the catch: He only wants a sexual relationship, so going against her morals, she SETTLES.They want different things out of the relationship, yet it continues, and we witness all the ups and downs of  the relationship and also a very candid look at the depression lonliness can cause. In short; We FEEL for Claires character and only want the very best for her because she is so very naive...and vulnerable.we witness changes in the other man (Jeremy), also.He matures (somewhat) and we get to witness a very bittersweet conclusion.Not quite the ending I wanted,but a realistic one anyway.

I loved it for its acting, the wonderful portrayal of interesting characters by three wonderful actors.  I loved it for its unassuming telling of a what I like to coin a ""coming of love"" story.  I loved it for its character development and for the way humor is interweaved.This is the story of Mirabelle, portrayed by Claire Daines, a twenty-something girl from Vermont that is living in L.A. and works as a shop girl in a famous department store.  Each night, Mirabelle comes home to her plain second story apartment, calling for her cat Sylvia that continously hides from her.  Mirabelle's life is as simple as her wishes.  She is not out for fame or fortune, but rather is looking to be recognized as a person who is valuable, has something to offer and should be loved for all the right reasons.  When Mirabelle meets Jeremy, a scruffy artist that is awkward and socially inept, she gets involved with him because ""sometimes women just want to be held"", as she hears on a radio talk show.  But there is no romance with Jeremy and when Ray Porter, an older rich man offers her roses, dinners and polite conversations, Mirabelle is soon swept up by his gentlemanly behavior.  While Ray can offer her all the things that young girls dream off - beautiful dresses, quiet dinners by candle lights, weekend trips to NYC - he also remains emotionally distant.  The viewer watches Mirabelle get involved with both men, learning not only about herself and what is important to her, but also about life's and love's complications.While the story centers around Mirabelle, both Ray and Jeremy are also very well developed as characters.  Ray, portrayed by Steve Martin, is a man who does not allow himself to open up emotionally and eventually recognizes that he may have missed out on love all together.  Jeremy, portrayed by Jason Schwartzman, comes to recognize that there is much more to be found in a partner than just a body for sexual adventures.  The one criticism I have is around Martin's secondary role as the omnipresent narrator of the story.  His background narration seems out of place and is often not needed, as the story is so well portrayed by the characters themselves.In the end, this is a story with characters that the viewer can relate to in one way or another.  It is not a story of finding the ideal partner in life, but rather about recognizing that life, love and relationships are complicated.  This is not your typical Hollywood love story and don't expect a fabulously idealized romantic ending.  What this movie does very well, though, is to portray a very realistic portrayal of what actually happens in relationships and how people cope with breakups, dates and life itself.",5,Coming of love,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2818,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'loved', 'movie', 'loved', 'simpleness', 'story', 'presented', 'loved', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'interesting', 'characters', 'three', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'loved', 'unassuming', 'telling', 'what', 'like', 'coin', 'coming', 'love', 'story', 'loved', 'character', 'development', 'way', 'humor', 'interweaved.This', 'story', 'Mirabelle', 'portrayed', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'twenty-something', 'girl', 'Vermont', 'living', 'L.A.', 'shop', 'girl', 'famous', 'department', 'store', 'night', 'Mirabelle', 'home', 'plain', 'second', 'story', 'apartment', 'calling', 'cat', 'Sylvia', 'continously', 'Mirabelle', 'life', 'as', 'simple', 'wishes', 'not', 'out', 'fame', 'fortune', 'rather', 'looking', 'be', 'recognized', 'person', 'who', 'valuable', 'something', 'offer', 'should', 'be', 'loved', 'right', 'reasons', 'When', 'Mirabelle', 'Jeremy', 'scruffy', 'artist', 'awkward', 'socially', 'inept', 'involved', 'sometimes', 'women', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'held', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'romance', 'Jeremy', 'when', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'older', 'rich', 'man', 'roses', 'dinners', 'polite', 'conversations', 'Mirabelle', 'soon', 'swept', 'up', 'gentlemanly', 'behavior', 'Ray', 'can', 'offer', 'things', 'young', 'girls', 'dream', 'beautiful', 'dresses', 'quiet', 'dinners', 'candle', 'lights', 'weekend', 'trips', 'NYC', 'also', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'viewer', 'watches', 'Mirabelle', 'get', 'involved', 'men', 'learning', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'important', 'also', 'life', 'love', 'complications.While', 'story', 'centers', 'Mirabelle', 'Ray', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'Ray', 'portrayed', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'allow', 'open', 'up', 'emotionally', 'eventually', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'love', 'together', 'Jeremy', 'portrayed', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'recognize', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'found', 'partner', 'just', 'body', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'one', 'criticism', 'have', 'Martin', 'secondary', 'role', 'omnipresent', 'narrator', 'story', 'background', 'narration', 'place', 'often', 'not', 'needed', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'themselves.In', 'end', 'story', 'characters', 'viewer', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'not', 'story', 'finding', 'ideal', 'partner', 'life', 'rather', 'recognizing', 'life', 'love', 'relationships', 'are', 'complicated', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fabulously', 'idealized', 'romantic', 'ending', 'What', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'portray', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'actually', 'relationships', 'how', 'people', 'cope', 'breakups', 'dates', 'life']",N/A

My perspective is colored by the fact that I read the book some months before viewing the film, and the book set up some expectations.  For those unfamiliar with either film or book, the story is about characters hooking up and unhooking LA style.  At the center is Mirabelle Buttersfield, a twenty-something with a degree in studio art, who pays for her talent by working the lonely glove counter in a high-end department store.  She lives on a shoestring, hiding clinical depression and a large balance on her student loans, dwelling alone in a tiny apartment.  She is first involved with Jeremy, a sloppy adolescent who is her chronological age, and then with Ray Porter who is the anti-Jeremy: mature, wealthy and sophisticated.The praise goes out to the cast, the writer and cinematographer.  Steve Martin says in an interview on the DVD that he had originally thought of Tom Hanks for the role he ultimately took, but the character of Ray Porter requires a detached urbanity that few others than Martin can impart.  Claire Danes is incredibly authentic and sympathetic as a twenty-something who has left adolescence behind but is still grappling with ""becoming.""  All the performances are pitch perfect. Martin wrote the screenplay which employs nicely rounded dialogue. The cinematographer does neat things with colors and lighting, communicating characters and contemporary LA through sets and exteriors.  Well done.The obstacles:  ""Shopgirl"" began as Martin's proficient novel, and its character-driven story and themes are most easily played out in the print medium.  The 3rd person omniscient narrator of the book is able to explain a lot, propel the plot and make for some very funny passages that are either reduced or not present at all in the movie.  Especially, there is a crucial chapter in the book, ""The Conversation,"" that delineates the conflict between Ray and Mirabelle who do not realize that they have a conflict.  The character of Lisa, Mirabelle's body-perfection-obsessed, ambitious would-be nemesis was writ a little larger in the book, making her intention to raid Ray all the more comprehensible and funny.  Mostly what I missed from the book was the narrator's voice, which could have been achieved with more voiceover in the film.",4,LA Story,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2368,"['are', 'praiseworthy', 'aspects', 'Shopgirl', 'are', 'obstacles', 'loving', 'unconditionally', 'perspective', 'colored', 'fact', 'read', 'book', 'months', 'viewing', 'film', 'book', 'set', 'up', 'expectations', 'unfamiliar', 'film', 'book', 'story', 'characters', 'hooking', 'up', 'unhooking', 'LA', 'style', 'center', 'Mirabelle', 'Buttersfield', 'twenty-something', 'degree', 'studio', 'art', 'who', 'talent', 'working', 'lonely', 'glove', 'counter', 'high-end', 'department', 'store', 'shoestring', 'hiding', 'clinical', 'depression', 'large', 'balance', 'student', 'loans', 'dwelling', 'alone', 'tiny', 'apartment', 'first', 'involved', 'Jeremy', 'sloppy', 'adolescent', 'who', 'chronological', 'age', 'then', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'who', 'anti-Jeremy', 'mature', 'wealthy', 'sophisticated.The', 'praise', 'out', 'cast', 'writer', 'cinematographer', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'interview', 'DVD', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'role', 'ultimately', 'took', 'character', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'detached', 'urbanity', 'few', 'others', 'Martin', 'can', 'impart', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'sympathetic', 'twenty-something', 'who', 'left', 'adolescence', 'still', 'grappling', 'becoming', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Martin', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'nicely', 'rounded', 'dialogue', 'cinematographer', 'neat', 'things', 'colors', 'lighting', 'communicating', 'characters', 'contemporary', 'LA', 'sets', 'exteriors', 'Well', 'done.The', 'obstacles', 'Shopgirl', 'began', 'Martin', 'proficient', 'novel', 'character-driven', 'story', 'themes', 'are', 'most', 'easily', 'played', 'out', 'print', 'medium', '3rd', 'person', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'book', 'able', 'explain', 'lot', 'propel', 'plot', 'make', 'very', 'funny', 'passages', 'are', 'reduced', 'not', 'present', 'movie', 'Especially', 'crucial', 'chapter', 'book', 'Conversation', 'conflict', 'Ray', 'Mirabelle', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'have', 'conflict', 'character', 'Lisa', 'Mirabelle', 'body-perfection-obsessed', 'ambitious', 'would-be', 'nemesis', 'was', 'writ', 'little', 'larger', 'book', 'making', 'intention', 'raid', 'Ray', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'funny', 'Mostly', 'what', 'missed', 'book', 'was', 'narrator', 'voice', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'more', 'voiceover', 'film']",N/A

971749,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000EDWKX8,Clare Quilty,"[4, 11]","In order to go along with ""Shopgirl,"" viewers have to accept a highly unlikely plot point right off the bat.They have to believe that Mirabelle (Claire Danes), the intelligent and attractive Los Angeles salesclerk of the title, is a woman with absolutely no social life.She seems to have no friends, no lovers, no exes, no favorite coworkers, no old gang from college, no myspace pals, no regular contact with her family and even her cat doesn't greet her when she comes home from work and puts food in its bowl.In other words, Mirabelle is basically a movie character standing around waiting for her ""meet cute,"" and before we're 20 minutes into the film, she gets two of them.First she meets Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a disheveled, amusingly clueless young dude who seriously needs work, and that doesn't just mean employment.Then she meets Ray (Steve Martin), an older, aloof millionaire who's really not quite as nice a guy as he seems to think.For a while, Mirabelle tries to date both of them. Neither seems a perfect match for her, but she puts on her best ""I guess it's OK"" face and goes with the flow.With its May/December romance between Martin and Danes, the movie sometimes seems to be copping a sleek, jaded ""Lost in Translation""-vibe, and director Anand Tucker's camera looks at L.A. in much the way that Sophia Coppola's regarded the Tokyo skyline. But ""Translation"" was about characters resisting an attraction and ""Shopgirl"" is about characters completely giving in to relational messiness.The script, by Martin and based on his novel, is a mixed bag. When it's good, it's extremely moving - particularly the ending -but the film has a condescending attitude toward Mirabelle, who's seemingly as malleable as warm Playdough. Danes often sits in heavenly lights and twice walks through falling pink blossoms, but the narrator has a tendency to talk about her like a Discovery Channel commentator discussing the behavior of quaint panda bears, and the wait for her to show some spine requires patience.Onscreen, however, Martin plays nicely against type here -- he's pretty cold and self-absorbed -- and it's just nice to see him in a role that doesn't require him to be dragged behind a ski boat or trying to raise 20 wacky children. Schwartzman is solid, too, even though at one point his character seems to secede into another movie and return with a maturity that doesn't quite make sense; still, he manages to make the leap seem kind of charming.In the end, it's hard to know what to make of a movie that's completely smitten with its heroine but doesn't really seem to like her very much.

It indeed had a chance to be a truly great film, save for a few glitches, most of them having to do with the screenplay, but opted for the true Lowest Common Denominator Hollywood flaw of `playing it safe'.Where the film succeeds is that it is blatantly a middle-aged male fantasy film, with an average looking fiftysomething wealthy computer executive named Ray Porter's attempts to make a mistress out of a twentysomething `shopgirl' he meets and woos at her L.A. Saks Fifth Avenue department store counter. She sells high fashion formal gloves and the double-divorced Ray (Steve Martin) buys them and mails them to her apartment. The shopgirl, a wannabe artist from Vermont named Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), is sort of involved with an awkward loser, amplifier salesman, and font designer named Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman, of Rushmore fame). From the first scene Danes and Schwartzman have together, at a laundromat, it's obvious they have real onscreen chemistry and are destined to be together. This is not a flaw, for most romances have this. The crux of the film is not will they end up together, but how will they end up together?Danes shows that she is the best twentysomething actress around, and has the most potential since Gwyneth Paltrow became a star in the late 1990s. The film could get her an Oscar, but, even though the Academy looks down on comedies and comic actors, it is Schwartzman who deserves at least a nomination. If Danes is a younger Paltrow, then he is a younger John Cusack. As it is, though, Shopgirl is still one of the better films and romantic comedies you'll see.

971754,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000EDWKX8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I'm at something of a loss as to how to go about reviewing this particular movie.  There's really no pigeon-holing Shopgirl, as it's just an odd mixture of drama and romance.  It's definitely not heavy on comedy, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you want Steve Martin to make you laugh.  Somehow managing to be both superficial and introspective, this film easily drew me in, but I never really felt comfortable in this world of lovers and choices.  For me, there's just something unsettling about the whole thing; it plays like a special romantic episode of The Twilight Zone.You've got to hand it to Steve Martin, though; besides writing the novella upon which the film is based (as well as the actual screenplay) and starring in the film, he gets to spend some quality romantic time with the always-enchanting Claire Danes.  Good work, my friend.  I think it is this May-November (I don't think Steve Martin quite deserves the December label just yet) relationship that bothers me a little bit, though - not that there's anything wrong with it.  It's the nature of this specific relationship that I find troubling, for plot-related reasons it would be uncouth of me to reveal in a review.This whole story really revolves around Claire Danes' character, Mirabelle Buttersfield.  She's a young woman whose dreams of a fresh new start in L.A. have settled down into a life of boredom and disappointment.  Selling gloves at Saks isn't exactly fulfilling, nor does it pay enough to start making a dent on all if Mirabelle's student loans.  Not only is she lonely enough to go out with a really weird, grungy, hairy ""artist,"" she's lonely enough to actually call him up after their first undeniably boring date.  The young man, Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), is smitten with her, of course, but he is soon replaced by a new man in Mirabelle's life - a man more than old enough to be her father.  Ray Porter (Steve Martin) is charming and safe, which allows him to win our young salesgirl's affection rather easily.  Unfortunately, the nature of that relationship comes to differ in the minds of Ray and Mirabelle, and that is the emotional lever upon which this distinctive story hinges.  Ultimately, Mirabelle faces a bona fide life-changing decision. It's much more than a simple romantic choice between two very different men, as it leads to a whole new direction in Mirabelle's life.I liked this movie, but I'm still not sure just how much I liked it.  The superficiality of the characters creates several plot points that took place too quickly and with no contextual support, and the whole thing invoked a number of private Why? questions in my mind.  That makes this film less emotionally compelling than it could have been, yet I still found Shopgirl captivating in a way I can't completely understand.",4,"Definitely different, somewhat unsettling, yet fascinating",1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,2807,"[""'m"", 'something', 'loss', 'how', 'go', 'about', 'reviewing', 'particular', 'movie', 'really', 'pigeon-holing', 'Shopgirl', 'just', 'odd', 'mixture', 'drama', 'romance', 'definitely', 'not', 'heavy', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'make', 'laugh', 'Somehow', 'managing', 'be', 'superficial', 'introspective', 'film', 'easily', 'drew', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'world', 'lovers', 'choices', 'just', 'something', 'unsettling', 'whole', 'thing', 'special', 'romantic', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hand', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'though', 'writing', 'novella', 'film', 'based', 'as', 'well', 'actual', 'screenplay', 'starring', 'film', 'spend', 'quality', 'romantic', 'time', 'always-enchanting', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Good', 'work', 'friend', 'think', 'May-November', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'quite', 'December', 'label', 'just', 'yet', 'relationship', 'bothers', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'nature', 'specific', 'relationship', 'find', 'troubling', 'plot-related', 'reasons', 'would', 'be', 'uncouth', 'reveal', 'review.This', 'whole', 'story', 'really', 'around', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'character', 'Mirabelle', 'Buttersfield', 'young', 'woman', 'dreams', 'fresh', 'new', 'start', 'L.A.', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'life', 'boredom', 'disappointment', 'Selling', 'gloves', 'Saks', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fulfilling', 'pay', 'enough', 'start', 'making', 'dent', 'Mirabelle', 'student', 'loans', 'Not', 'only', 'lonely', 'enough', 'go', 'out', 'really', 'weird', 'grungy', 'hairy', 'artist', 'lonely', 'enough', 'actually', 'call', 'up', 'first', 'undeniably', 'boring', 'date', 'young', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'smitten', 'course', 'soon', 'replaced', 'new', 'man', 'Mirabelle', 'life', 'man', 'more', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'father', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'charming', 'safe', 'win', 'young', 'salesgirl', 'affection', 'rather', 'easily', 'Unfortunately', 'nature', 'relationship', 'differ', 'minds', 'Ray', 'Mirabelle', 'emotional', 'lever', 'distinctive', 'story', 'hinges', 'Ultimately', 'Mirabelle', 'bona', 'fide', 'life-changing', 'decision', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'romantic', 'choice', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'whole', 'new', 'direction', 'Mirabelle', 'life.I', 'liked', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'superficiality', 'characters', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'took', 'place', 'too', 'quickly', 'contextual', 'support', 'whole', 'thing', 'invoked', 'number', 'private', 'Why', 'questions', 'mind', 'film', 'less', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'yet', 'still', 'found', 'Shopgirl', 'captivating', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'understand']",N/A

When our feet hit the ground running after four years of college, didn't we all sit there and wonder ""What Now?""  How many of us got power jobs and unlimited incomes?  Very few.  After college life sets in.  Many of us don't even move. SHOPGIRL is a small look into a young woman's life and shows us how happiness may be right under our noses it just wasn't the right time.Mirabelle Buttersfield (Clare Danes) leads a simple life.  She's living in LA,  recently off the bus from Vermont, and she has aspirations of being an artist.  But alas she finds herself working behind the glove counter at Saks.  Living in a cozy little apartment, and leading an incredibly dull life.  Things change only slightly when Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman) asks her out on a date. He's a bit of a slob, and has the social graces of a mutant toad.  But somewhere between his awkward comments and her gentile nature they strike up a relationship with very little steam but genuine care.But one day Ray Porter (Steve Martin) shows up.  He's Jeremy except, 30 years older, highly successful, and able to hide his social ticks behind of years of experience.  Ray sweeps Mirabelle off her feet and into a relationship that is full of passion, but very little else.Director Anand Tucker (Hillary and Jackie) and screenwriter Steve Martin have crafted a nice film.  A film that begs to be looked at.  On the surface it's a sweet romantic comedy.  It has many of the same devices you'd see in any Julia Roberts/Richard Gere fantasy.  But Martin's script fills the story with so much more.  Like 2003's LOST IN TRANSLATION, SHOP GIRL tells the story if Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson had continued their affair at home.  The cinematography is sweeping and Tucker frames shots of absolute beauty you wonder why the TV ads for this film make it seem so conventional.Martin and Danes also have an interesting chemistry.  Danes especially carries the film which is difficult because the script treats Mirabelle with such kid gloves.  She brings light to a role that could easily have been window dressing.  The film is really about the two men being changed by a beautiful women, and you can see the inner conflict raging in Ray Porters head.  He wants to love this women, but the years have dulled his drive that all he can muster is fathering this women.SHOPGIRL  main problem is that sometimes Tucker's camera lingers on things for no apparent reason.  The film skirts the line of pretentious art film at times.  While the actors strike the right cord you can't help but see Tucker's eye for pictures is too caught up with making things look nice, and making Danes look like a goddess.  This at times slows the flow of the film down.  SHOP GIRL like LOST IN TRANSLATION will lose some of its natural charm because it will be too easy to distracted at home and look away in your living room.I also could have done without the needless subplot involving Bridgette Wilson-Sampras.  Her character wasn't realized enough to allow me to care and the humor seemed a bit out of place.  I have a feeling there is probably more of her left on the cutting room floor.  I would have left it all out.  I also thought there was a nice logical ending to the film that would have left it a little more ambiguous.

971757,A23HNJR2KLL26O,B000EDWKX8,Deanna Breglia,"[4, 5]","In his screenplay that he adapted from his own story, Steve Martin captured the weight of loneliness and the desire to feel desired. This is what he does best.""Shopgirl"" is a subtly gorgeous little film with an indie feel. I've watched it a few times now and I always leave the film longing for something. A stronger female lead? No Steve Martin narration? More beauty shots of L.A.? I've realized though that my overall problem with the film was in its characters, not in the filmmaking.Mirabelle (Claire Danes), the Shopgirl, is weak. She gravitates toward any man that showed her attention in this modern, adult love story. She begged Ray Porter (Steve Martin) to love her: an emotionally unavailable man paired with a girl who is nothing but raw emotion.""Why don't you love me?"" she asked, crying in his foyer, clutching her shoes and her tiny suitcase, and wearing the dress he bought her. Still, Claire Danes is the finest I've seen her since Angela Chase (""My So-Called Life""). Her timid smile, the way she doesn't know how pretty she is, and even her clothes and her hair, were all perfect.To make Mirabelle's attraction to Ray, over 30 years older than her, believable, Martin went out of his way to make the other leg of the love triangle, Jeremy, as short, nerdy, ugly, dirty, and undesirable as possible. I like that Jeremy (the hysterically funny Jason Schwartzman) took her to City Walk, because it's City WALK and not City Sit-and-Watch-a-Movie and thought it perfectly fine to use a ""jiffy bag"" as a condom. The compulsive zipping and unzipping of his hoodie while standing in her bedroom was annoyingly charming, something he pulls off well.Mirabelle's second date with Ray Porter was at Cha Cha Cha in Silverlake (she lived right near Sunset Junction), which is actually a very common second-date type restaurant for singles in L.A.. They redid the restaurant so that the tables were covered in blue and there were more than usual and the lighting was different, but still, there it was.I know I wouldn't have liked this film half as much if I didn't live right in the center of the action. It opens with a helicopter shot of downtown at night - I can even see the building that houses my old YMCA and the street my house is on a few blocks away. The beauty shots are some of the best I've seen of Los Angeles, but the movie can't decide whether it loves LA or despises it. In the end, I think the film decided it loves the town but takes pity on its residents. Los Angeles itself was the fourth character, personifying loneliness and perhaps trying to explain why the characters were as desperate as they were.The vapid, trashy Lisa (Bridgette Wilson Sampras), Mirabelle's co-worker, was supposed to represent the typical L.A. girl: a gold-digging bimbo. I'm realizing that the real 'typical' L.A. girl is a girl like Mirabelle from Vermont who goes home to an empty apartment and draws pictures of herself and takes baths and talks to her cat and just needs love and companionship and someone who isn't afraid to call her his girlfriend.One of my favorite lines happened in the last five minutes of the movie: Jeremy pointed to Mirabelle's artwork and proudly told a stranger, ""My girlfriend drew that.""I think THAT summed up the relationship that Mirabelle had been looking for all along--sure, she had security and understanding with Jeremy, but more importantly she finally had someone who was thrilled to tell the world that she was his girlfriend and he was unapologetically proud of her.",4,Trying to make connections,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,3513,"['screenplay', 'adapted', 'own', 'story', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'captured', 'weight', 'loneliness', 'desire', 'feel', 'desired', 'what', 'best', 'Shopgirl', 'subtly', 'gorgeous', 'little', 'film', 'indie', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'always', 'leave', 'film', 'longing', 'something', 'A', 'stronger', 'female', 'lead', 'No', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'narration', 'More', 'beauty', 'shots', 'L.A.', ""'ve"", 'realized', 'overall', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'characters', 'not', 'filmmaking.Mirabelle', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Shopgirl', 'weak', 'man', 'showed', 'attention', 'modern', 'adult', 'love', 'story', 'begged', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'love', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'man', 'paired', 'girl', 'who', 'nothing', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'asked', 'crying', 'foyer', 'clutching', 'shoes', 'tiny', 'suitcase', 'wearing', 'dress', 'bought', 'Still', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'finest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'timid', 'smile', 'way', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'pretty', 'even', 'clothes', 'hair', 'were', 'perfect.To', 'make', 'Mirabelle', 'attraction', 'Ray', '30', 'years', 'older', 'believable', 'Martin', 'went', 'way', 'make', 'other', 'leg', 'love', 'triangle', 'Jeremy', 'short', 'nerdy', 'ugly', 'dirty', 'undesirable', 'possible', 'like', 'Jeremy', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'took', 'City', 'Walk', 'City', 'WALK', 'not', 'City', 'Sit-and-Watch-a-Movie', 'thought', 'perfectly', 'use', 'jiffy', 'bag', 'condom', 'compulsive', 'zipping', 'unzipping', 'hoodie', 'standing', 'bedroom', 'was', 'annoyingly', 'charming', 'something', 'well.Mirabelle', 'second', 'date', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'was', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'Silverlake', 'lived', 'right', 'Sunset', 'Junction', 'actually', 'very', 'common', 'second-date', 'type', 'restaurant', 'singles', 'L.A..', 'redid', 'restaurant', 'tables', 'were', 'covered', 'blue', 'were', 'more', 'usual', 'lighting', 'was', 'different', 'still', 'was.I', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'half', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'right', 'center', 'action', 'helicopter', 'shot', 'downtown', 'night', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'building', 'houses', 'old', 'YMCA', 'street', 'house', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'beauty', 'shots', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'LA', 'end', 'think', 'film', 'decided', 'town', 'pity', 'residents', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'fourth', 'character', 'personifying', 'loneliness', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'explain', 'why', 'characters', 'were', 'as', 'desperate', 'were.The', 'vapid', 'trashy', 'Lisa', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'Sampras', 'Mirabelle', 'co-worker', 'was', 'supposed', 'represent', 'typical', 'L.A.', 'girl', 'gold-digging', 'bimbo', ""'m"", 'realizing', 'real', ""'typical"", 'L.A.', 'girl', 'girl', 'Mirabelle', 'Vermont', 'who', 'home', 'empty', 'apartment', 'draws', 'pictures', 'herself', 'baths', 'talks', 'cat', 'just', 'needs', 'love', 'companionship', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'call', 'girlfriend.One', 'favorite', 'lines', 'happened', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'pointed', 'Mirabelle', 'artwork', 'proudly', 'told', 'stranger', 'girlfriend', 'drew', 'think', 'summed', 'up', 'relationship', 'Mirabelle', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'sure', 'had', 'security', 'understanding', 'Jeremy', 'more', 'importantly', 'finally', 'had', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'thrilled', 'tell', 'world', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'unapologetically', 'proud']",N/A

But I had no idea he was/could be a ""serious"" actor, let alone a gifted novelist and screenwriter.  He tells a touching, straightforward, realistic story about a young woman named Maribelle living alone in a strange city [L.A.] who is struggling to do more than simply exist.  She wants to be an artist, but makes a living working in high-end retail.  After one bad date with an awkard and decidedly weird young man [Jason Schwartzman] she meets at the laundrymat, she is then swept off her feet by well-to-do older gentleman named Ray [Martin].  Ray never makes Maribelle any promises, but nonetheless, Mirabelle dives headfirst into the relationship, blinding herself to the fact that she has been invited to partake in nothing more than a typical sugar daddy-type situation.Claire Danes shines in this film, and Steve Martin's careful performance lets her do just that.  Jason Schwartzman adds comic relief, and (ultimately) some sweetly romantic moments.  A lot of young women will relate to this movie - not in the 'fling with an older man sense' (though I'm sure some have had that experience) - but in respect to being a woman at that awkward mid-20's age where you're struggling to get your life/career/solid relationships off the ground, and in the meantime, can find yourself having some very lonely moments.  Loneliness is the catylst for the events in the movie, and shows how being lonely can lead people to make less than wise choices.  Great movie, but not for everyone.

I've long been a huge fan of Steve Martin's writing, and I strongly doubted any director, regardless of talent or intent, could adequately convey the hypnotic and transcendent mood Martin creates in the original novella. The prose was just too good, and the effect just too perfect. I didn't want to ruin the pretty little picture of the book that was in my head. Visions of a choppy screenplay caused me to shudder and pass.Well, I was wrong to be such a nudge. This is an exquisite film. Director Anand Tucker magnificently brings story to screen, and does not miss one nuance.As department store clerk Mirabelle embarks on a relationship with the much older, much wealthier Ray Porter, we see them struggle within their own emotional prisons to reach out to try and grab the gold ring that is, in each of their eyes, the perfect romance.  Of course it doesn't work out, at least not the way each of them envisioned that it might. Yet they are individually enriched in ways they never imagined.The casting is perfect. The screenplay preserves the original phrasing.  Martin's voiceovers really work in re-creating the mood of the original work.  Every detail of character, scenery, and costume is strategic, yet appears effortless in the execution.  Watch the changes of color in staging and in costume as the story progresses - it's marvelous.The supporting actors provide wonderful parodies of stereotypical Southern California characters. As with all of Martin's vehicles it seems, the City of Los Angeles is a character in itself and the cinematography of the metropolis is reminiscent of LA Story. Could this tale have happened anywhere? Of course. But in LA it is perfect.Get the DVD, curl up, have a box of hankies handy for the angsty bits, and a glass of wine to raise to the silly and joyous bits.

For myself, I would tend to disagree with this assessment.  There are a few tiny slivers of Romantic Comedy motifs in the film, but overall I would say it is much more of a drama than anything else.  This is a bit surprising, given that it was in fact written by Steve Martin.The film details a naive, shy, sensitive young woman (played by Claire Danes) who finds herself with 2 suitors.  One of them (portrayed by Steve Martin) is a mega-wealthy man from the top of the socio-economic ladder.  The other one (portrayed by Jason Schwartzman) is a young man who is struggling to get by.  He lacks social skills (to the extreme!) and some of his antics get downright annoying.  He is, to be sure, from the opposite end of the socio-economic ladder as Steve Martin's character.The typical formula for movies like these is for the woman to choose between the rich guy who is a jerk and the poor guy who has a good heart.  This film throws a curve ball into this equation.  Both men are basically decent human beings, albeit with some faults.The biggest reason to watch this film is Claire Danes.  She has a natural elegance about her that infatuates guys like me.  She seems to effortlessly float through all the movies she's in, kind of like a leaf in a gentle breeze.I think this is a very good movie, but it's not going to be for everyone.  The pace of the film is very slow and deliberate.  Stylistically it reminds me of LOST IN TRANSLATION.  If you didn't like LIT, you probably won't like this film.

Set in an immaculate LA that looks slightly surreal thanks to Peter Suschitzky's luxuriant cinematography and William Arnold's color-coordinated production design, the threadbare story centers on the preciously-named Mirabelle Buttersfield, a Saks sales clerk leading a mundane existence as she leisurely pursues her art on the side. At the laundromat, she meets a socially inept hyper-geek of an amplifier salesman named Jeremy Kraft. They date, but unluckily for him, he suddenly becomes a roadie for a rock band and leaves LA for several weeks. Enter Ray Porter, an erudite dot-com millionaire who is looking for a no-strings-attached relationship with Mirabelle and plies her with fancy dinners and expensive gifts. Despite the obvious age difference - which the movie thankfully does not belabor - she is swept away. All three characters experience some amount of heartache and gain some wisdom along the way toward the inevitable resolution.Martin is an obviously sharp and observant writer, but his dialogue, while clever at times, can also get a little too glib. Interestingly, the non-verbal moments work the best in the film, especially the ones that reflect the inner turmoil of the characters. As Ray, Martin provides himself with a character that suits his non-manic off-screen persona well, and it is his most subtle work since David Mamet's 1997 ""The Spanish Prisoner"". The problem is that he is probably a decade too old for the role, exacerbated by his romantic scenes with Claire Danes. As Mirabelle, she lends her unique combination of gawky intelligence and offbeat beauty to strong effect, even though the emotional naivete of her character is a bit much at times. Jason Schwartzman gives the film's best performance in the challenging role of Jeremy, managing the balance between repellant and empathetic and fueling the film with much of its energy.There are a few missteps, none fatal - the contrived scene alternating between Ray and Mirabelle speaking to others about their relationship (a rip-off of the ""Annie Hall"" split screen psychiatrist scene); Mirabelle's Bergmanesque visit with her stoic parents; and the low comedy provided by Saks perfume salesgirl Lisa, a blonde vixen (played with appropriate cynicism by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) out to snare Jeremy, whom she thinks is Ray. The DVD is light on extras, though Tucker provides ebullient commentary on an audio track. I only wish Martin participated since he wrote, produced and starred in the movie. There is a standard, twenty-minute making-of featurette with the cast and crew commenting on the production. Two deleted scenes are also included, but neither is critical and most certainly would have provided further drag to a film that already moves a bit too slowly.",4,Slow Moving But Often Poignant Brightened Particularly by Danes and Schwartzman,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,3007,"['2005', 'movie', 'suffers', 'deliberately', 'glacial', 'pacing', 'like', 'many', 'quirky', 'touches', 'much', 'genuine', 'poignancy', 'director', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'bring', 'adaptation', 'Martin', '2000', 'novella', 'Set', 'immaculate', 'LA', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'thanks', 'Peter', 'Suschitzky', 'luxuriant', 'cinematography', 'William', 'Arnold', 'color-coordinated', 'production', 'design', 'threadbare', 'story', 'centers', 'preciously-named', 'Mirabelle', 'Buttersfield', 'Saks', 'sales', 'clerk', 'leading', 'mundane', 'existence', 'leisurely', 'art', 'side', 'laundromat', 'socially', 'inept', 'hyper-geek', 'amplifier', 'salesman', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'Kraft', 'date', 'unluckily', 'suddenly', 'roadie', 'rock', 'band', 'LA', 'several', 'weeks', 'Enter', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'erudite', 'dot-com', 'millionaire', 'who', 'looking', 'no-strings-attached', 'relationship', 'Mirabelle', 'fancy', 'dinners', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'obvious', 'age', 'difference', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'not', 'belabor', 'swept', 'away', 'three', 'characters', 'experience', 'amount', 'heartache', 'gain', 'wisdom', 'way', 'inevitable', 'resolution.Martin', 'obviously', 'sharp', 'observant', 'writer', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'glib', 'Interestingly', 'non-verbal', 'moments', 'work', 'best', 'film', 'especially', 'ones', 'reflect', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'characters', 'Ray', 'Martin', 'character', 'suits', 'non-manic', 'off-screen', 'persona', 'well', 'most', 'subtle', 'work', 'David', 'Mamet', '1997', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'problem', 'probably', 'decade', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'exacerbated', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Mirabelle', 'unique', 'combination', 'gawky', 'intelligence', 'offbeat', 'beauty', 'strong', 'effect', 'even', 'emotional', 'naivete', 'character', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'challenging', 'role', 'Jeremy', 'managing', 'balance', 'repellant', 'empathetic', 'fueling', 'film', 'much', 'are', 'few', 'missteps', 'none', 'fatal', 'contrived', 'scene', 'alternating', 'Ray', 'Mirabelle', 'speaking', 'others', 'relationship', 'rip-off', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'split', 'screen', 'psychiatrist', 'scene', 'Mirabelle', 'Bergmanesque', 'visit', 'stoic', 'parents', 'low', 'comedy', 'provided', 'Saks', 'perfume', 'salesgirl', 'Lisa', 'blonde', 'vixen', 'played', 'appropriate', 'cynicism', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson-Sampras', 'snare', 'Jeremy', 'whom', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'light', 'extras', 'Tucker', 'ebullient', 'commentary', 'audio', 'track', 'only', 'wish', 'Martin', 'participated', 'wrote', 'produced', 'starred', 'movie', 'standard', 'twenty-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'cast', 'crew', 'commenting', 'production', 'Two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'critical', 'most', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'further', 'drag', 'film', 'already', 'bit', 'too', 'slowly']",N/A

The film has such an incredible depth, and shows the LA life through the eyes of four characters.Mirabelle, played by Claire Daines, is such an interesting character that I think everyone can identify with ESPECIALLY if you have dated in LA! She aspires to have a relationship and attracts Jeremy ( who is perfectly played by Jason Schwartzman) but soon finds out that he is in no way prince charming.Ray Porter ( Martin) is an older man that Mirabella meets at Saks, where she works; soon, Ray asks her out and the rest of the film is about these three characters and what they want from a relationship.The music is absolutely touching, and the colors used are so vivid and moving. All of these touches really enhance the great script and acting.The one point in the film ( if any) I have a slight issue with is when Mirabelle stops taking her antidepressant medication and then becomes ill from it, both psychologically and physicaly. Instead of the film addressing that when people go 'cold turkey' off these serious ( and deadly) meds, people can become ill but it can be prevented by doctor supervision and lowering the dosage slowly, the movie just sort of puts Mirabelle on them and doesn't explain anything. I would have liked the script to have had a little more to it with this subject, and would have shown that one can get off these drugs safely and in fact go on living a better life without them, IF an understanding doctor helps the process.All in all, I reccommend this film because it is one of the best films that I have seen in years, and I think you'll be thanking the director with me after you watch it!!",5,"An amazing, beautiful film with great cinematography, acting, and score",1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1712,"['husband', 'fell', 'love', 'Shopgirl', 'were', 'amazed', 'how', 'well-done', 'was', 'film', 'incredible', 'depth', 'LA', 'life', 'eyes', 'four', 'characters.Mirabelle', 'played', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'identify', 'ESPECIALLY', 'have', 'dated', 'LA', 'have', 'relationship', 'Jeremy', 'who', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'soon', 'out', 'way', 'prince', 'charming.Ray', 'Porter', 'Martin', 'older', 'man', 'Mirabella', 'meets', 'Saks', 'where', 'soon', 'Ray', 'out', 'rest', 'film', 'three', 'characters', 'what', 'want', 'relationship.The', 'music', 'absolutely', 'touching', 'colors', 'used', 'are', 'so', 'vivid', 'moving', 'touches', 'really', 'enhance', 'great', 'script', 'acting.The', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'have', 'slight', 'issue', 'when', 'Mirabelle', 'taking', 'antidepressant', 'medication', 'then', 'becomes', 'ill', 'psychologically', 'physicaly', 'Instead', 'film', 'addressing', 'when', 'people', 'go', ""'cold"", 'turkey', 'serious', 'deadly', 'meds', 'people', 'can', 'become', 'ill', 'can', 'be', 'prevented', 'doctor', 'supervision', 'lowering', 'dosage', 'slowly', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'puts', 'Mirabelle', ""n't"", 'explain', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'script', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'subject', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'off', 'drugs', 'safely', 'fact', 'go', 'living', 'better', 'life', 'IF', 'understanding', 'doctor', 'process.All', 'reccommend', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thanking', 'director', 'watch']",N/A
971765,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B000EDWKX8,Eric J. Anderson,"[8, 11]","I enjoyed Steve Martin's L.A. Story because he combined fantasy with comedy -- he did not deny his wacky screwball side. He used that as an asset in a romantic comedy.This film sinks under the weight of its own intention to be somewhat realistic and serious. Oh yes, a few funny things happen, and it may elicit a giggle or a snort here and there. But Martin's character is simply wooden, subdued, uncharismatic, not very charming... maybe the best description of him is simply ""burned out."" The worst thing is that we don't learn enough about this man to know why he is that way, or why he makes a play for the young girl Mirabelle. All we know is that he's apparently in ""software"" and has oodles of money.Claire Danes' Mirabelle is clearly more winning in her quiet shyness, politeness, and sympathetic in her mild depression and her longing for emotional intimacy and love reciprocated. But we also get little sense of a back story as to where this passive girl comes from and who she really is. She creates art through drawing and photographs, but there is no sense of what motivates that, either.I have left the worst for last -- the Jeremy character is certainly the most colorful. Perhaps he is the only real color in this film. But compared to the book, I think his transformation from ignorant shlub to respectable man is so glossed over that the filmgoer is mostly at a loss as to how this happens. He goes away for a year, reads a few self-help books, and buys a suit -- this is going to change him into someone who can truly love  Mirabelle?Who are these people? Why do they do behave as they do? Shopgirl makes you feel the things happening in the movie, but this emotional content is without intellectual context to understand. I don't think I was bored while I was watching Shopgirl. Claire Danes is enough of an actress that we feel her depression, her joy in a sense of love and belonging with the older man (however false the foundation of that might be), and her distress as the reality of her situation begins to creep over her. The film engages the heart. But the next morning, you are going to realise that this film lacks supporting characters that are anything more than cardboard cutouts or cartoons.Steve Martin is an enormously talented writer and performer. He really dropped the ball here. Shopgirl the novella was good, but not great. You sort of grade the book on a curve because Martin is branching out into new territory, and you don't expect mastery of the genre. Shopgirl the movie is, at best, something to use to pass the time. The characters in the book are thin, but their movie counterparts are thinner than thin. They go here, and they do that, and they feel this, but we never really know why. ""It's just life,"" Martin says in one of the final voiceovers. Yeah, but I require life to involve a little more analysis than this movie ever attempts.",2,"Martin's worst attempt at ""serious"" film",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2888,"['enjoyed', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'L.A.', 'Story', 'combined', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'deny', 'wacky', 'screwball', 'side', 'used', 'asset', 'romantic', 'comedy.This', 'film', 'sinks', 'weight', 'own', 'intention', 'be', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'serious', 'Oh', 'yes', 'few', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'may', 'elicit', 'giggle', 'snort', 'here', 'there', 'Martin', 'character', 'simply', 'wooden', 'subdued', 'uncharismatic', 'not', 'very', 'charming', 'maybe', 'best', 'description', 'simply', 'burned', 'out', 'worst', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'enough', 'man', 'know', 'why', 'way', 'why', 'play', 'young', 'girl', 'Mirabelle', 'know', 'apparently', 'software', 'oodles', 'money.Claire', 'Danes', 'Mirabelle', 'clearly', 'more', 'winning', 'quiet', 'shyness', 'politeness', 'sympathetic', 'mild', 'depression', 'longing', 'emotional', 'intimacy', 'love', 'reciprocated', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'sense', 'back', 'story', 'where', 'passive', 'girl', 'who', 'really', 'art', 'drawing', 'photographs', 'sense', 'what', 'either.I', 'have', 'left', 'worst', 'last', 'Jeremy', 'character', 'certainly', 'most', 'colorful', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'real', 'color', 'film', 'compared', 'book', 'think', 'transformation', 'ignorant', 'shlub', 'respectable', 'man', 'so', 'glossed', 'filmgoer', 'mostly', 'loss', 'how', 'away', 'year', 'few', 'self-help', 'books', 'suit', 'going', 'change', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'love', 'Mirabelle', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'behave', 'do', 'Shopgirl', 'feel', 'things', 'happening', 'movie', 'emotional', 'content', 'intellectual', 'context', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bored', 'was', 'watching', 'Shopgirl', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'enough', 'actress', 'feel', 'depression', 'joy', 'sense', 'love', 'belonging', 'older', 'man', 'however', 'false', 'foundation', 'might', 'be', 'distress', 'reality', 'situation', 'creep', 'film', 'heart', 'next', 'morning', 'are', 'going', 'realise', 'film', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'anything', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'cartoons.Steve', 'Martin', 'enormously', 'talented', 'writer', 'performer', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'here', 'Shopgirl', 'novella', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'sort', 'grade', 'book', 'curve', 'Martin', 'branching', 'out', 'new', 'territory', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'mastery', 'genre', 'Shopgirl', 'movie', 'best', 'something', 'use', 'pass', 'time', 'characters', 'book', 'are', 'thin', 'movie', 'counterparts', 'are', 'thinner', 'thin', 'go', 'here', 'do', 'feel', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'just', 'life', 'Martin', 'one', 'final', 'voiceovers', 'Yeah', 'require', 'life', 'involve', 'little', 'more', 'analysis', 'movie', 'ever', 'attempts']",N/A

971768,AO5F3MTTFCQR8,B000EDWKX8,"girldiver ""Enjoy!""","[6, 7]","This movie was billed as a comedy in the video store but it wasn't your usually comedy. Actually, I would never have billed it as a comedy. Yes, Steve Martin wrote the novella and screenplay while also acting opposite Claire Danes but this is not a comedy, as you'd normally define it. It did have some funny events in it like most life events some things have got to be funny or laughter would be an anomaly and not the norm.I've always been a huge fan of Claire Danes (My So Called Life, Romeo and Juliet); she's unique, elegant beyond her young years, and always enchanting on the screen. The casting of the film was very good from Claire Danes to Bridgett Wilson-Sampras. I even liked Steve Martin as the love interest. The whole film had a very put together look that effortlessly guided you through our Shopgirls' romantic endeavors.I suppose I should tell you some of the movie before I ramble on and on: it's about a young woman from Vermont living in LA who works at Saks Fifth Avenue and her relationship with a young man of her age and an older man. I suppose that description isn't so enticing but the film really is a bright shining hope diamond in my book filled with beautifully articulated emotion on love, loss, and rebirth.Claire Danes plays Mirabelle Buttersfield a young woman alone in LA. She's a woman of solitude, creative, full of quiet ambition working hard to pay her school loans and pursuing her artful endeavors after working at Saks. She is also lonely when she becomes involved with a young man named Jeramy played by Jason Swartsman. Of course, Meribelle then gets asked out by a mysterious business man, named Ray Porter (Steve Martin), while at the glove counter at Saks but you soon discover that both Mirabelle and Ray have different ideas on the relationship.This is a movie of quiet expression. Unlike some movies in which every emotion is discussed and verbalized much of this film conveys its meaning through mood and expression which is beautifully exercised in the enchanted acting of Claire Danes, Steve Martin, and Jason Swartzman. So much of this movie is subtle that it literally surprises you at the end of the movie when you feel both happiness and loss at the same time. Another element to the film was the sensuality of Mirabelle and Ray together. It was both extravagant in the depth of emotion during the intimacy and yet it also was at a distance when the two of them were in a social environment.The film itself would not have been a success with me with out the fabulous music score by Barrington Pheloung, cinematography by Peter Suschitkzy, and editing by David Gamble. All the elements of acting, writing, and film production gave this film its feel and depth.

While its focus is an examination between types of romance, it also manages to address many issues of the isolation of living alone in Los Angeles - or any big city for that matter.  But Los Angeles, with its sprawl of ill-defined suburbs and neighborhoods searching for a city's identity, a city where a lot of lonely people mount the freeways daily to drive to unfulfilling jobs that merely keep their lives together, snuffing out many possibilities of  life enhancing experiences, is the perfect fit for Steve Martin's screenplay adaptation of his very Los Angeles novella by the same name.Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), an immigrant wannabe artist from Vermont lives alone with her distant cat Sylvia in Silver Lake, one of the borderlands of LA, and drives her pickup to Saks Fifth Avenue daily to work the glove counter. Most of her day is spent daydreaming while watching fellow sexy worker Lisa (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) charm the customers with fragrances.  She meets another loner Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), an unkempt, broke, but good-spirited youth her age in a Laundromat and the mutual needs of both characters opens a strange but sweet romance overture.  But simultaneously Mirabelle meets the wealthy 50-something divorced Ray Porter (Steve Martin in a subdued, no pratfalls role) and Ray immediately but subtlely  begins sending gifts and dates and surprises Mirabelle's way, resulting in a 'perfect courtship' in her eyes but intended as a no strings sexual outlet in Ray's view.  The story is one that compares the May/December high-class romance with the more sensitive and realistic wobbly romance between two young needy people and the manner in which it resolves feels right.Danes is superb in this delicate role as are Schwartzman, Martin, and Wilson-Sampras. Director Anand Tucker keeps the story flowing naturally, as 'natural' as he can with the writer and actor being the one with the clout.  Each of the sections of this monopoly game of courtship is well played until the lugubrious musical score by Barrington Pheloung  pushes toward the maudlin.

Claire Danes, always excellent, never steps out of character in her role, and their relationship is one that exists - whether we like it or not.

She lives in Silver Lake, works at SAKS in Beverly Hills, and draws at night. That's all what demure Mirabelle did until two very different men arrived at the doorstep of her life and knocked.One of the guys is Jeremy Craft (Jason Schwartzman of Rushmore), a sloppy, dopy struggling artist that does stencil artwork for an amplifier company. They meet at a Laundromat and Jeremy does very little to impress Mirabelle, but the Vermont transplant is lonely and depressed (she's on anti-depressants) that she finds this goofball somewhat appealing.Shortly after Mirabelle reluctantly opens the door and lets Jeremy in, Ray Porter (Steve Martin) comes knockin'. He's a wealthy, refined computer mogul with homes in Los Angeles and Seattle and a keen desire for Mirabelle. He seduces the impressionable girl with fancy dinners, expensive gowns, and a slew of other things that lots of money can buy. Mirabelle is entranced by Porter's pouring affection she opens the door wide open for him to walk right into her heart. She tells Jeremy she's seeing someone else when he calls to tell her he'll be on the road with some band.Craft and Porter are both appealing and repulsing in their own very different yet very parallel ways and Mirabelle has feelings for both of them. The time will come when she is faced with a single decision: I can either hurt now or hurt later. What will it be? Whom will she choose? Who's going to remain in her life? her heart? Who will walk out of the door?I really enjoyed this film. I was especially moved by how real it was in terms of emotions, reactions and performances. I also loved how the character grow and change and how their experiences and interactions make each one of them a better person in the end.The direction/editing is also very clever and engaging. The soundtrack is great, but alas it's not available in stores (I still don't understand how that works!) It's definitely one of the better produced romantic films I've seen in a while.All in all, Shopgirl is a great adult, contemporary love story.

I won't say exactly what that twist is.The story begins with Mirabelle, the beautiful and talented Claire Danes, moving from Vermont to L.A., ostensibly to pursue her art. She secured a job working at Saks selling elegant, long women's gloves. I remember thinking to myself, God I would kill myself if I had to stand on my feet all day smiling or looking pleasant when I really don't like what I'm doing.Immediately upon her arrival, she meets Jeremy, a loveable disaster played to distinction by Jason Schwartzman. They have an awkward date, and Mirabelle discards his number. Then she listens to a tape (apparently) that says any affection, being held, even if it is by someone you're not particularly fond of, is uplifting to the spirit (or some such thing). She searches for his phone number, finds it in the garbage can OUTSIDE of her building, and calls him. A rather funny scene occurs. She calls him, but at the very moment that she calls him, he knocks the phone off his hook. His apartment is a dump; things are strewn all over with no apparent reason behind it, so the slightest disturbance could cause an avalanche. Mirabelle is screaming his name into the phone, but he can't hear her. At that moment, he decides - arbitrarily and apparently without much forethought - to call her. He picks up the phone, not realizing that it's off the hook (I did say that he was a disaster) and dials her number. He comes over, they have VERY awkward sex, yada yada.Then Ray Porter (Steve Martin) enters her life. He purchases a pair of gloves from Mirabelle and a day or so later Mirabelle finds a package on her doorstep. It is the gloves - and Ray invites her to dinner.This begins an unattached romance, as Ray makes it clear that he's not looking for anything long term. It is fairly obvious, fairly quickly, that his feelings for her, and her feelings for him are anything but unattached.During their romance, Jeremy travels with a rock band, and listens to yoga tapes, self-help tapes, reads books about how to treat women, and when he returns he is a different person. Somehow he has become successful, although neither my friend nor I could figure out how he has made a success out of himself, though we were able to toss out a few possibilities that were still full of holes.Overall, the movie is an intriguing exploration into love, where to find it, how to hold it, and what happens when you deny it.",4,What you lose...,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2495,"['Shopgirl', 'quaint', 'charming', 'touching', 'story', 'unrequited', 'love', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'twist', 'is.The', 'story', 'Mirabelle', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'moving', 'Vermont', 'L.A.', 'ostensibly', 'pursue', 'art', 'secured', 'job', 'working', 'Saks', 'selling', 'elegant', 'long', 'women', 'gloves', 'remember', 'thinking', 'myself', 'God', 'would', 'kill', 'had', 'stand', 'feet', 'day', 'smiling', 'looking', 'pleasant', 'when', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing.Immediately', 'arrival', 'Jeremy', 'loveable', 'disaster', 'played', 'distinction', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'have', 'awkward', 'date', 'Mirabelle', 'discards', 'number', 'Then', 'tape', 'apparently', 'affection', 'being', 'held', 'even', 'someone', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'uplifting', 'spirit', 'such', 'thing', 'phone', 'number', 'garbage', 'can', 'OUTSIDE', 'building', 'rather', 'funny', 'scene', 'occurs', 'very', 'moment', 'phone', 'hook', 'apartment', 'dump', 'things', 'are', 'strewn', 'apparent', 'reason', 'slightest', 'disturbance', 'could', 'cause', 'avalanche', 'Mirabelle', 'screaming', 'name', 'phone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'moment', 'arbitrarily', 'apparently', 'much', 'forethought', 'call', 'up', 'phone', 'not', 'realizing', 'hook', 'did', 'say', 'was', 'disaster', 'number', 'over', 'have', 'VERY', 'awkward', 'sex', 'yada', 'yada.Then', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'life', 'purchases', 'pair', 'gloves', 'Mirabelle', 'day', 'so', 'later', 'Mirabelle', 'package', 'doorstep', 'gloves', 'Ray', 'dinner.This', 'unattached', 'romance', 'Ray', 'clear', 'not', 'looking', 'anything', 'long', 'term', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'feelings', 'feelings', 'are', 'anything', 'unattached.During', 'romance', 'Jeremy', 'rock', 'band', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'self-help', 'tapes', 'reads', 'books', 'how', 'treat', 'women', 'when', 'different', 'person', 'Somehow', 'become', 'successful', 'friend', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'made', 'success', 'were', 'able', 'toss', 'out', 'few', 'possibilities', 'were', 'still', 'full', 'holes.Overall', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'exploration', 'love', 'where', 'find', 'how', 'hold', 'what', 'when', 'deny']",N/A
971783,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000EDWKX8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 7]","This low-key comedy/drama was written by Steve Martin, based on his novella of the same name and it's truly a great movie. I can't recall when Steve Martin has done better work, it's been a few years. This is a completely different Steve Martin than the one we've seen inhabiting family comedies lately. The movie stars Claire Danes as Mirabelle, a girl who works behind the glove counter at Saks Fifth Avenue in Los Angeles. While at a laundromat, Mirabelle meets Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a young uninspired man who has a knack for saying the wrong thing. For some odd reason, Mirabelle is attracted to Jeremy...Until one day at Saks she meets Ray Porter (Martin), a rich older man who has a lot more to offer than Jeremy. This is one of those movies that can really be explained in like 20 words or less, but that doesn't begin to really unearth the plot of this movie.It's a pretty simple plot, but it's deeper than that at the same time. Martin's script captures the awkwardness, sadness, and happiness of relationships perfectly. I've always known Steve Martin was a good writer, I mean he co-wrote ""The Jerk"". But this shows a completely different side to Martin, the slightly off-beat romantic side of him...But don't get me wrong, the script still has plenty of Martin's wittiness. His characters are very well written and detailed, but this is only fueled by how good the actors are. Claire Danes is a pretty obscure actress for the most part. The last movie I saw her in was ""Terminator 3"". But hopefully she's using this movie to revamp her career, because she proves her that she's a great actress. Mirabelle is a kind of mysterious, yet layered character that Danes breathes life into and does it so well. Martin's character Ray is a character we've seen Martin play before, the hopeless romantic older guy and this is truly THE Steve Martin role. His performance is extremely toned down, but worthy of an Oscar nomination.But despite these two great performances, the best performance goes to Jason Schwartzman who I've never even viewed as a particularly good actor.Schwartzman plays the socially inept Jeremy to a T. Everytime Jeremy appears in the movie, I was laughing. He says the wrong thing so perfectly, all the time. But, anyway, that brings me to my next argument. What the hell happened at Oscar time? Yes, this movie was low-key but that is what's so good about it. I think it could've gotten at least 4 nominations; Best Actress (Danes), Best Actor (Martin), Best Supporting Actor (Schwartzman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Martin). The low-key aspect is pretty much what got it robbed. Oscar doesn't like low-key...Oscar likes big explosive acting,think Sean Penn ""Mystic River"", Hilary Swank ""Million Dollar Baby"", andGeorge Clooney ""Syriana"".

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","It's easy for me to see why ""Shopgirl"" has been greeted with a mixed reception, especially as it expanded to DVD and cable. Being aware of what was said about it during its theatrical run, as well as of Steve Martin's novella on which its based, I knew this film would thwart some people's expectations. Despite the presence of Martin, this is not a ribald laugh riot. Nor is it really a romantic comedy. It's a slight tale, really a character study, of a young woman trying to incorporate intimacy and love into her life. There are genuine moments of humor from Martin, but they are interwoven into a realistic tapestry of an arranged relationship.Claire Danes, in a remarkably detailed performance, is the Shopgirl in question. She is romanced by a very rich, much older man played by Martin. Even though it starts as a relationship of convenience, she soon becomes enamored of him and the lifestyle he can share with her. Countering Martin on the romantic spectrum is Jason Schwartzman. His character provides much of the comedic backdrop of the film and I was genuinely amused by Dane's reactions to him.Again, this is a very small picture and one that is deliberately paced. It is easy to dismiss as if nothing is going on, but most of the ""action"" is internalized in Dane's character as we proceed. I did enjoy the movie, and it does succeed as a performance piece. Danes is great, in one of her most natural screen performances. Never a huge Schwartzman fan, I think he plays well as a challenge to Danes. And Steve Martin is smart and subdued. Some who claim the film is misogynistic or unrealistic because of the age difference between Danes and Martin are objecting on principle only. The relationship is actually very credible and well established.I think the biggest challenge most viewers face is the pacing, but I think the film is worthy. Just understand what type of film you're about to see and I don't think you'll be disappointed. One misfire, however, was a sporadic narration from Martin which is unnecessary and occasionally jarring, but it's a minor flaw.

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I know that Steve Martin wrote both the novella and the screenplay for ""Shopgirl,"" and obviously he is playing the role of Ray Porter, but I think that having him doing the voiceover for the omnisicent narrator was a bit much.  That is because we are inclined to think he is talking as Ray rather than as the author, and whiile I can make it work either way, it is something of a distraction to try and figure out which one is the right interepretation.  Besides, this is a charming little of story and we should just be concentrating on the matter at hand.I was going to say that ""Shopgirl"" was about a love triangle that not is not strictly true.  Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), is the title figure, working behind the glove counter at Saks Fifth Avenue and trying not to be bored out of her mind.  One night at the laundromat she meets up with Jeremy Kraft (Jason Schwartzman), who is clearly a loser.  But apparently he is better than nothing because she not only goes out with him but also sleeps with him, despite his revolting idea of birth control.Then one day at the store she talks has a customer that she convinces to buy the black gloves and not the gray.  She is then surprised to find the gloves and some flowers, along with an invitation to dinner, signed Ray Porter (Martin).  Ray is old enough to be Mirabelle's father, but he has charm and money, not to mention restraint, and Mirabelle decides to see him instead of Jeremy, who goes out of town with a rock band to be a roadie and to spend time on the bus listening to self-help tapes.There is really no surprise here, because you get a sense for the dynamic of these relationships and the fact that the characters are going to change for better or worse over the course of the film.

971794,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000EDWKX8,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 6]","Director Anand Tucker who helmed ""Hillary & Jackie"" and tackles ""The Golden Compass: His Dark Materials"" next year directed this pet project for Steve Martin.  Claire Danes who first came to prominence in the TV series ""My So Called Life"" and then starred in ""The Mod Squad"" as well as having a small part in ""The Hours"" has had a varied career.  As Mirabelle Buttersfield she shines as a vulnerable young woman looking for Mr. Right while she pays bills as a clerk at Saks 5th Avenue.  Jason Schwartzman is the son of Talia Shire who played Mrs. Rocky in the Sylvester Stallone series and is the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola.  He's previously been seen in ""Bewitched"" & ""I Heart Huckabees."" As Jeremy, a young guy who also takes a shine to Mirabelle, he seems to be going nowhere with few social skills.  He does get the funniest bit in the film when the cat bats at part of his private anatomy while he's making love to Mirabelle.  Steve Martin charmed me just as he did the New York Film Critics Circle in 1984 for the hysterical comedy ""All of Me"" with Lily Tomlin.  As Ray Porter he plays it straight, wanting a relationship that satisfies physical needs without having to be emotionally taxed.  He does a good job, but is not entrancing.  Bridgette Wilson-Sampras puts in a brief appearance as the hustling make-up counter saleswoman who has a routine of how to tease and get the most out of her male customers.  Francis Conroy from ""Six Feet Under"" puts in a very brief appearance as Mirabelle's mom.  All in all, the film doesn't work very well.  My wife slept through it.  Given that Steve Martin is not going to be funny, he's also not deep enough to keep us glued to the screen.  Mirabelle's depression seems layered into the story without great effect, other than to demonize Ray Porter who seems worse for taking advantage of a vulnerable young girl.  ""Shopgirl"" is an interesting portrait of modern relationships, but would work better as an assignment for a sociology class than as entertainment.

Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your point of view, I have outgrown that particular Steve Martin. So I guess it's good for me that Steve Martin appears to have outgrown that stage in his life too. I find the adult Steve Martin much more refreshing and find that he makes a good, harried, quirky everyman. I particularly enjoyed his L.A. Story which balanced a lot of truth with some fantasy and some comedy. Claire Danes has also intrigued me. I can't say that I've seen her in a lot and I could never get into the critical darling My So Called Life. Yet, I still find her very interesting, not the least because of her looks. She's very pretty, but seems like someone who mostly chooses very down-to-earth roles.

Claire Danes plays the title role with Steve as Ray and Jason Schwartzman as Jeremy, two guys she meets and becomes involved with in L.A.Besides excellent and convincing performances on the part of Danes and Martin, Shopgirl is a cinematic wonder.  I especially appreciated the shot of Seattle at night. And the sunsets were, in a popular word,--awesome!This movie is about relationships and how hard it is to commit.  Just about anyone can identify with some part of it.  A young woman taking anti-depressants and trying to follow her artistic bliss nights works days behind a gloves counter in Saks Department Store.  She gets involved with two extremely different men who play a significant role in her maturation process for both better and worse.  But it is more than a romantic story and shows the audience about more than just Maribelle (Claire) or Jeremy (Jason) or Ray (Steve)...it is a paradoy on life. And it teaches us something about what love really is and how fragile people's feelings can be.I laughed  when Maribelle and Jeremy are trying to make love and the cat jumps up on the bed to interrupt.  This is the grand entrance of the feline in the movie heretofore unseen but referred to and called.  That was funny. Cats get good parts these days and we never tire of it.  Besides most people living alone have either a cat or a dog...so this was just another realistic touch.The movie has moments of tenderness which really spoke out to me: like when Ray finally realizes that he does love Maribelle;  and I enjoyed watching Jeremy's transition from loser to budding success along with his efforts at self improvement by watching DVD's and reading ""how to"" books. Pretty dumb...really...but also pretty nice.As the movie concludes and Steve Martin says as narrator and writer...it is life!Both of my thumbs are up...and I am expecting at least an Oscar nomination for Claire Danes.

971803,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000EDWKX8,Mark,"[3, 4]","Shopgirl succeeds so well as a romantic comedy because it's modest, witty in all the right places, quiet and subtle, and superbly written and acted.  Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) is stuck in a dead end job working at Saks, and slowly paying off her student loans ($45 at a time) while struggling as an artist.  The main story takes place between her and Ray Porter's (Steve Martin) relationship, but in the beginning, we are introduced to Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman doing what he does best), a socially incapable person; by incapable, I mean he's not very good at it (socializing).  Jeremy is very awkward, embarrasing to himself, and sometimes we just feel downright bad for him, but he adds a witty humor to the mix, making it more of a romantic comedy than just your average date movie (although I would seriously reccomend this as a date movie).  She goes on a date with him in which he has to borrow money from her to pay for the date, and it eventually leads to one of the funniest, and most awkward sex scenes in recent cinema.  Mirabelle then meets Ray at Saks, while he is trying to decide what color of gloves (for a woman) that he should buy.  We then get a little snippet of men's taste versus women's taste.  Ray suggests that he buy the grey pair of gloves.  Mirabelle responds by saying ""Play it safe"" (meaning that grey is the safe color).  He gets the black gloves after her suggestion.  This is one of the techniques that Steve Martin, who wrote the screenplay based on his best-selling novella of the same name, uses; these very subtle differences between men and women that draw us in.  Mirabelle goes home one night to find a package at her doorstep, and, upon opening it, finds the pair of black gloves that Ray had purchased with a note asking her to dinner.  Upon their first date, we get a sharp contrast to Jeremy.  Ray is at least 25 years her senior, and he is very wealthy, but he does not seem to desire her company as much as Jeremy, who, at this time, has left the picture for most of the middle, having gone on tour with a local band.  Ray seems to lead her on for most of their relationship, careful not to get too close, but also careful to not let her get too far away.  He discusses this matter with his therapist, but not with Mirabelle, and he says that the relationship can't go very far, and basically he keeps her around so that he can sleep with her when he is home from business.  He lavishes her with gift upon gift, and almost seems to be a father figure to her rather than a love interest.  This is also important, because Mirabelle's father, not that it's his fault, doesn't speak very much because of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from Vietnam.  Mirabelle has not really had a huge father figure in her life until Ray comes around.  But, as their relationship develops, she starts developing more of a romantic relationship with him which seems more on her part than his.  Ray is clearly not looking for a long-term relationship, and she, in his point of view, is basically someone to keep around for sex.  Although we want to like Ray, we can't help but notice the way he treats her.  While the film gives extensive commentary on life and relationships (some of which can be quite depressing), the film adds in humor at different parts.  There is a scene towards the end involving mistaken identity, where one of Mirabelle's co-workers (Bridgette Wilson; you may remember her from Billy Madison) mistakes Jeremy for Ray in an attempt to make Ray cheat on Mirabelle.  The bedroom scene and the following day are both hysterical and they lighten the mood of the film.  All of the performances are fantastic.  Claire Danes really fits as the girl torn between feelings, who is just trying to make the right decisions.  Steve Martin subtly plays Ray, a role that he probably wrote having himself in mind for the film.  He plays Ray so well that even when he treats Mirabelle terribly, we still kind of admire him in his own way; maybe it's the age and experience thing.

971804,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000EDWKX8,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[4, 7]","Everyone knows Steve Martin the actor. But they probably don't know that Steve Martin the writer is equally talented, if not more so. He proved that by writing the screenplays for such films as ""The Jerk,"" ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,"" and ""L.A. Story,"" among others, all films which he also starred in. ""Shopgirl,"" based on his own novella, is perhaps the richest, most beautiful screenplay he has written yet and easily his most dramatic film role to date.On the top floor of Sacks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills, Mirabelle, a meek, quiet salesgirl, stands behind the glove counter to help pay off her student loans and support herself while pursuing a career as an artist. Her life takes a drastic turn when she's simultaneously pursued by Ray (Martin) a rich, cultured fifty-something businessman, and Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a less-refined, less-rich, and disturbingly sloppy bachelor.Mirabelle finds herself falling for Ray, but he's definitely wrong for her. She starts snubbing Jeremy, and he could be the Mr. Right she didn't even realize she needed.""Shopgirl"" takes all the typical ingredients of a cliched romantic comedy and turns them into a beautiful work of art. The film sparkles with hilariously authentic dialogue and situations so real, they're almost painful to watch.Steve Martin and Claire Danes have surprisingly great chemistry and Jason Scwartzman is delightfully hilarious as Jeremy. Their performances help flesh out some of the richest, most intriguing characters on film in a long time.They don't seem like characters at all, because they're not perfect and they each have flaws that keep them from being happy. They're people we know or have come across at some point in our lives, and these characters are what makes the film so special.""Shopgirl"" feels like ""Lost In Translation"" meets ""Annie Hall"" mixed with a conventional Hollywood romance. It's a touching and poignant film that explores the idea of falling in love without idealizing it and making it seem like a perfect paradise, which most of the time, it isn't.Some avid readers may complain that Martin has upset the balance of his original novella by drastically expanding the role of Jeremy. Although this creates a more conventional love triangle, it also adds some welcome comic relief to the film in way of Scwartzman's fantastic turn as Jeremy. He is especially funny during a mistaken-identity encounter with Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, who plays Mirabelle's wicked, gold-digging co-worker Lisa.Most of the time, romance is a convenient Hollywood convention that always rakes in the cash. Rarely do we see a film that treats the subject so seriously and with so much heart. ""Shopgirl"" does just that by exploring the highs and lows of love, the disappointments, the desperate second chances, the awkward moments, and the passion that quickly turns to heartache.""Shopgirl"" is not a film for everyone. It's a bittersweet tale that plays with Hollywood conventions, but doesn't follow them. Hearts are broken, trust is betrayed, and no one really learns their lesson. That's life and ""Shopgirl"" portrays it well. The film does overstay it's welcome just a bit toward the end, but overall, it is a well-thought out and extremely entertaining adaptation of a cute novella.In a time when Hollywood is at its worst creative and financial slump ever, it's refreshing to see a film like ""Shopgirl."" The characters are rich and the dialogue is well-written and funny while the situations ring surprisingly true. The performances are top-notch and the film is engrossing, if just a tad too long.All in all, ""Shopgirl"" is a boisterously entertaining, invigorating, and endearing film.

It seemed like an entertaining romance, and I thought that the plot was promising albeit not overly original. What could go wrong? Unfortunately, a lot.Yes, the story is interesting at first sight. Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a young woman that works at Saks but wants to be an artist, has to choose between two very different men that vie for her attention. One is Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a struggling musician that doesn't value her as much as he should. The other man is Ray Porter (Steve Martin), someone who is attentive but much older than Mirabelle, and that on top of that doesn't want a long term relationship.What can Mirabelle do? And will we have a happy ending? Those two questions were uppermost in my mind during the first hour of this film. I ended up with answers to both questions, but I can't say I liked them. The ending was bittersweet at best, and I kept waiting for something else to happen. Needless is to say, it didn't.On the whole, ""Shopgirl"" is a film based on a good idea, and has a cast of fine actors that give real life to their characters. That is specially true if we take into account Claire Danes' nuanced performance, as a shy and vulnerable woman who isn't comfortable with the choices life (and men) offer her. Despite all that, and strangely enough, this movie just doesn't work...

It just sounded interesting.It's a funny, quirky little movie, which might have otherwise sank without trace, had it not been based on Steve Martin's novella. He also stars in it, as the much older man, who tries to use Claire Danes' character as an LA plaything, for when he's in town.Claire Danes plays Mirabelle, a bored shop assistant, who sells gloves in Saks. She appears to have no life outside of the shop, going home to her cat, and likes to take naked photos of herself, and then incorporate them into her artwork. She meets Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman) in a laundrette of all places, and they get talking. She's originally interested, until discovering that he's boring, and expects a good night kiss, dismissing the idea that the date hasn't gone well. He gives her his phone number. It seems like that relationship died a death.Then Mirabelle meets Steve Martin's character, Ray, who couldn't be more different from Jeremy. He has money, he buys some gloves from Mirabelle, and then has them delivered to her, with a dinner invitation. Who says romance is dead? Then there's a funny little sequence where Mirabelle admits to her friends he's the dreaded ""one"", and he admits to an unseen person (therapist?) that he's just using her for when he's in town. It progresses simply from there.Shopgirl is a simplistic little movie, pretty basic. There's no special effects. It's just a story about a relationship, showing all the pain and hurt, and sometimes the love that is in a relationship. The only problem I had was with the character of Mirabelle. The wardrobe assistant decided Claire had to play 'frumpy', with dowdy, horrible clothes, and an awful pair of glasses. But there is a subtle subplot of the ugly duckling into the swan story, and watch for the transformation in Mirabelle by the last scene. What a difference.Shopgirl probably will not give anyone faith in men out there, as it shows Steve Martin in a very bad light. Flash your flesh and keep your guy girls! Or find a guy who can keep it in his pants at least.

971809,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,B000EDWKX8,Michael K. Smith,"[1, 2]","I've known for years that Steve Martin is considerably more than a wild and crazy guy. His more serious films, especially those he wrote himself (PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, ROXANNE, BOWFINGER) sometimes show a darker side of his inventiveness. This one, though, is a sweet three-sided love story about a bored glove counter clerk at Saks in Los Angeles who is also a part-time artist (played by Claire Danes, with the classic Martinian character name of Mirabelle Buttersfield), and a rather clueless young guy her own age who is also an artist of sorts (if you count designing fonts), and a wealthy businessman more than twice her age (played by Martin). The younger guy hits on her, she responds, but he pretty much screws it all up. Then the older guy hits on her, but he knows what he's doing and quickly sweeps her off her feet. He thinks he's made it clear he doesn't want a deep relationship but the message isn't at all clear to Mirabelle, who falls heavily in love with him despite the distance he maintains from her. Meanwhile, the other guy, Jeremy, has gone off on a band bus for a few months, where he's exposed to incessant self-help and ""relationship"" tapes as they drive through the night. This, naturally, allows him to remake himself so he's ready for Mirabelle when he returns to L.A. Basically, this is a quiet, somewhat sad movie about love and life. The humor is low-key and also perfectly human, not at all Martin's old stage persona. There are minor various plot holes and unanswered questions, but hey -- life is often like that, too. The sad part is that Claire Danes, a consumate actress in MY SO-CALLED LIFE, and who should have been the next Jodie Foster, has had her talent wasted in such crap as THE MOD SQUAD and TERMINATOR 3.",4,He's an okay guy by the way . . .,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1752,"[""'ve"", 'known', 'years', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'considerably', 'more', 'wild', 'crazy', 'guy', 'more', 'serious', 'films', 'especially', 'wrote', 'PENNIES', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'ROXANNE', 'BOWFINGER', 'sometimes', 'show', 'darker', 'side', 'inventiveness', 'one', 'sweet', 'three-sided', 'love', 'story', 'bored', 'glove', 'counter', 'clerk', 'Saks', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'also', 'part-time', 'artist', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'classic', 'Martinian', 'character', 'name', 'Mirabelle', 'Buttersfield', 'rather', 'clueless', 'young', 'guy', 'own', 'age', 'who', 'also', 'artist', 'sorts', 'count', 'designing', 'fonts', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'more', 'twice', 'age', 'played', 'Martin', 'younger', 'guy', 'hits', 'pretty', 'much', 'screws', 'up', 'Then', 'older', 'guy', 'hits', 'what', 'doing', 'quickly', 'sweeps', 'off', 'feet', 'made', 'clear', ""n't"", 'want', 'deep', 'relationship', 'message', ""n't"", 'clear', 'Mirabelle', 'who', 'heavily', 'love', 'distance', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'guy', 'Jeremy', 'gone', 'off', 'band', 'bus', 'few', 'months', 'where', 'exposed', 'incessant', 'self-help', 'relationship', 'tapes', 'drive', 'night', 'naturally', 'remake', 'ready', 'Mirabelle', 'when', 'L.A.', 'Basically', 'quiet', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'movie', 'love', 'life', 'humor', 'low-key', 'also', 'perfectly', 'human', 'not', 'Martin', 'old', 'stage', 'persona', 'are', 'minor', 'various', 'plot', 'holes', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'hey', 'life', 'often', 'too', 'sad', 'part', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'consumate', 'actress', 'MY', 'SO-CALLED', 'LIFE', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'had', 'talent', 'wasted', 'such', 'crap', 'THE', 'MOD', 'SQUAD', 'TERMINATOR', '3']",N/A

Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[3, 4]","SHOPGIRL is a painful movie to watch because you don't really like either of the two male leads and you hate seeing Mirabelle, the shopgirl of the title played by Claire Danes, get emotionally hurt. And Mirabelle herself has no life so you are not much rooting for her either. As a result, the viewer is left emotionally flat, wincing at Mirabelle's misfortune. Steve Martin wrote the screenplay as well as the 2000 novel on which the movie is based. He also plays Ray Porter, a mysteriously rich businessman with no apparent family or friends other than one ex-girlfriend. Ray quietly seduces Mirabelle and showers her with gifts but not love. Meanwhile, Jeremy, an immature clown played by Jason Schwartzman, is also competing for her affections. Both Ray and Jeremy are emotionally stunted men incapable of love who only hurt Mirabelle or leave her empty. But then you have to wonder what such a gorgeous young woman is doing with these two losers. It doesn't make sense. Mirabelle could have any number of attractive, successful men who would be more than willing to love her. Instead, she is alone, without even a cat. The script implies that there is nothing wrong with Mirabelle, only with the her two suitors, Ray and Jeremy. One is tempted to read into this another Hollywood indictment of men. When are men going to get tired of going on movie dates only to find their gender being libeled again and again on the screen? Makes for wonderful after-date conversation how big of jerks the men were in the film, doesn't it? I would pass this film. SHOPGIRL, like Mirabelle, is rather boring.

She is a young 24 year old trying to find her place in the world after college and seperating herself from her parents. She meets slacker Jeremy (Jeremy Schwartzman) while doing some laundry and they start dating. While Jeremy is sweet he is typical of boys his age. He stinks and leaves food on the floor and his idea of safe sex is using a plastic bag.Enter Ray Porter (Steve Martin) the older divorced wealthy prince charming. He courts Mirrabelle and she ultimately falls in love. While he is older he is genuine and she sees something special in him. What follows is not a love story but a story that we are all familiar with in our own lives. The conversation in the kitchen after they sleep together for the first time was all too real for many. He lets her know that while this is fun, this will never be long term. As she explains to her friends her new love it is fascinating to watch her go over the events in HER words. She tells them that he is taken with her and that he wants to stop working so much to spend more time with her. He goes to his shrink and says that while they will continue to have sex there is no future.This is what we do in real life,bending the words to sound the way we want, while forgeting the meaning behind them. This movie forces you to take notice of Mirabelle's journey through this relationship and how her life almost hangs in the balance as she does so. Claire is perfect in this role, as well as Steve Martin. Good special features. Martin plays it just right. He reminds me of any man in his position in life, and while he may seem stiff, he is playing an emotionally unavailable man.

I was living in Germany when it was released so...What's surprising is how beautiful this film is. It seems to start out droll and somewhat morose. That was the trap. Even as it was seemingly touching but depressing it unfolded from that  less than impressive bud into a flower of haunting beauty- with its fair share of thorns.The seems simple enough: a bored, attractively handsome young women is looking for her place in life, in Los Angeles as she sells gloves in a SAKS 5th Ave. store, a garment no one wears anymore (is this a metaphor for our notions of old fashioned romance?).Her life is not empty, but it is not exciting or even very interesting. She's acutely aware of this fact.On the chance that letting her guard down might yield something happening, anything happening in her life she goes on a date with a shy, quirky, socially awkward artist. He's poor as dirt. She wants something more in her life. It's a weird but not useless coupling. It's also not what she'd hoped for. Still, he's better than nothing, right?Along comes a man who is both interested in her, but also has wealth, taste and maturity going for him. Too bad he's not willing to open up. He clearly has feelings for her even as he denies them to himself and her. Oddly enough he goes to great lengths to make her a part of his life, enough so that she lets her artist go believing the new man in her life might be the ""one"".The artist takes the time to do some growing as part of the road crew for a traveling rock band.Hopefully that's enough to get you interested or warn you off depending on the type of films you like.This is clearly a more artful film and I find the romantic comedy label to be misleading. In this case artful is not odd. It's also not riddled with the standards. The motives of the players are discovered through their actions, sometimes small gestures and just plain old atmosphere. I love films that don't beat me over the head with a ""message"". I likewise don't like films that talk down to me (unless it's obvious, like a joke).As the story unfolds I'm left with the idea that it's fine to like these characters as much for their all too human flaws as well as for their hopes and small triumphs.The score, sound editing and cinematography, as well as art direction are beautiful supporting players for the story.Also worth mentioning is Steve Martin's brief but beautiful narrative used to frame some of  the essence of these people's lives.I'm also surprised at some of the negative remarks concerning this film and the viewers expectations.That's too bad but also expected. After all this is a film that seems quite unlikely from the guy who started his cinematic career as ""The Jerk"" (still a fun film).He's come a long way and he wears very well with age.",5,"Quirky, beautiful, sincere... not for everyone",1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2830,"['took', 'long', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'living', 'Germany', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'so', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'beautiful', 'film', 'start', 'out', 'droll', 'somewhat', 'morose', 'was', 'trap', 'Even', 'was', 'seemingly', 'touching', 'depressing', 'unfolded', 'less', 'impressive', 'bud', 'flower', 'haunting', 'beauty-', 'fair', 'share', 'thorns.The', 'simple', 'enough', 'bored', 'attractively', 'handsome', 'young', 'women', 'looking', 'place', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'gloves', 'SAKS', '5th', 'Ave.', 'store', 'garment', 'one', 'wears', 'anymore', 'metaphor', 'notions', 'old', 'fashioned', 'romance', '.Her', 'life', 'not', 'empty', 'not', 'exciting', 'even', 'very', 'interesting', 'acutely', 'aware', 'chance', 'letting', 'guard', 'down', 'might', 'yield', 'something', 'happening', 'anything', 'happening', 'life', 'date', 'shy', 'quirky', 'socially', 'awkward', 'artist', 'poor', 'dirt', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'weird', 'not', 'useless', 'coupling', 'also', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Still', 'better', 'nothing', 'right', 'Along', 'man', 'who', 'interested', 'also', 'wealth', 'taste', 'maturity', 'going', 'Too', 'bad', 'not', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'clearly', 'feelings', 'even', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'part', 'life', 'enough', 'artist', 'go', 'believing', 'new', 'man', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'artist', 'time', 'do', 'growing', 'part', 'road', 'crew', 'traveling', 'rock', 'band.Hopefully', 'enough', 'get', 'interested', 'warn', 'off', 'depending', 'type', 'films', 'like.This', 'clearly', 'more', 'artful', 'film', 'find', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'label', 'be', 'misleading', 'case', 'artful', 'not', 'odd', 'also', 'not', 'riddled', 'standards', 'motives', 'players', 'are', 'discovered', 'actions', 'sometimes', 'small', 'gestures', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'atmosphere', 'love', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'message', 'likewise', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'talk', 'obvious', 'joke', 'story', ""'m"", 'left', 'idea', 'fine', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'too', 'human', 'flaws', 'as', 'well', 'hopes', 'small', 'triumphs.The', 'score', 'sound', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'beautiful', 'supporting', 'players', 'story.Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'brief', 'beautiful', 'narrative', 'used', 'frame', 'essence', 'people', 'lives.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'surprised', 'negative', 'remarks', 'concerning', 'film', 'viewers', 'expectations.That', 'too', 'bad', 'also', 'expected', 'film', 'quite', 'unlikely', 'guy', 'who', 'started', 'cinematic', 'career', 'Jerk', 'still', 'fun', 'film', '.He', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'very', 'well', 'age']",N/A
971819,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000EDWKX8,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","SHOPGIRL was a delightful little book (novella, really) that revealed Steve Martin to be an author who could neatly blend sharp cynicism, wry wit and old-fashioned sentimentality into a concoction all his own.  It combined asute observations about LA's cultural ""scene"" (as he also did in the film LA STORY), with a romance and lead character that were almost of another time.  The result, to me, was sweet and satisfying...and made me appreciate the unique comic genius that Martin is.  I know many people objected to the book, as being too trite, too satisfied with itself, to overwrought in its romance.  I liked it, and so I looked forward to the movie very much.  As did my wife.First, let me say that if you didn't like the book, there's no reason to hope the movie will change your mind.  It's a fairly fastidious recreation not only of the events of the book, but the tone as well.As a book to screen translation, SHOPGIRL is better than most.  There are certainly events that are missing from the film, particularly as the book was filled with internal dialogue or at least, it had an ""all knowing"" narrator who showed us directly to the heart of the characters.  The film does have some narration, but it is blessedly minimal.  We are left to discern this inner life from the acting, and from some carefully chosen camera work and editing.The main character, lonely, lovely Mirabelle, is played by Clare Danes.  She's one of America's best young actresses.  She's great in IGBY GOES DOWN, and she's actually quite believable and grounded in reality in TERMINATOR 3.  SHOPGIRL gives her a chance to shine...much like the character of her older lover Ray Porter... Steve Martin has pulled Clare Danes from relative obscurity and turned her into something special.  (Yeah, that's an exaggeration, but it sounds good.)  If the role of Mirabelle isn't played well, the movie has no chance of succeeding.  Fortunately, Danes is MORE than up to the challenge.  She has a wonderfully expressive face, whether feeling joyful or sad.  There's no chance in ""real life"" that she would ever have been lonely and ignored by most men.  The book goes to great lengths to show us what a wallflower she is.  In the movie, Danes is too noticeable to be believed as a poor loser waiting to be discovered.  So, she's portrayed as a bit shy perhaps, and she also works the glove counter at a department store where the glove counter is by far the LEAST visited store counter in history.  She's so immobile and useless behind her counter that we can imagine she's somewhat disappeared from herself.Steve Martin plays Ray Porter, the older, rich man who takes a liking to her and makes her feel special.  He tells her that he isn't looking for a long-term relationship...but he is so romantic with her, so courtly, and lavishes on her so well that poor Mirabelle can't help but believe that he feels differently about her.  Martin is very good, although his age is showing, and I hope he doesn't pull the Woody Allen thing of pairing himself with women far too young.  Some have criticized him for casting himself in such a light...I think he probably sees a bit of himself in this character (which he created, of course).  Perhaps it's a bit brave of him to take it on.Jason Schwartzman as the clueless young man who yearns for Mirabelle (and whom we all know is right for her) is a bundle of nervous energy and inappropriate remarks.  Schwartzman is a fun performer to watch...an amusing mixture of his own native intelligence, usually put to the service of playing a character who is a bit of a social loser.SHOPGIRL, to me, was a very satisfying adaptation.

I guess it just goes to show you that you can be as lonely and miserable in a buzzing metropolis as you can living out in the middle of nowhere.  Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) also has a relationship with a quirky misfit (Jason Schwartzman) who may or may not be playing with a full deck mentally.  ""Shopgirl"" deviates from the ""Good Girl"" path, however, when an older man (Steve Martin) with serious commitment issues begins to get romantically involved with Mirabelle.  Thus is set up an unlikely love triangle that will test Mirabelle's resolve and maturity as a woman.Adapted by Martin from his own best-selling novela and directed by Anand Tucker, ""Shopgirl"" is so low-keyed in atmosphere and tone that it almost threatens to negate itself out of existence even while you`re watching it.  Yet, the movie has enough of a laid back quality and enough expertise in the performances to make it a passable, if not exactly memorable, experience.  Commendably, the movie makes it a point to be fair to all its characters, as it acknowledges the messiness that lies at the heart of human relationships.

971823,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000EDWKX8,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 6]","Mirabelle is a ""shopgirl"" at an LAS Sachs where she sells gloves that are too expensive for anybody to want to buy.  A transplant from the north east, she's awash in debt and stranded in ""the vast openness"" of LA when she becomes the object of desire to two worthless men.  Jeremy is a talent less slacker with an infant's attention span, and few other signs of means.  Ray is in varying degrees his polar opposite and his identical twin - possessing the means that outstrip Jeremy, but a similar emotional disconnect.  ""Shopgirl"" tells the thin story of how Mirabelle will live with Ray for much of the story yet end up with the feckless slob of Jeremy.Nothing much happens in ""Shopgirl"".  At one point, Mirabelle (Danes) confronts Ray (Steve Martin) about the sad pointlessness of their relationship.  ""Why don't you love me?"" she asks, and it's a question that pretty much undercuts this entire flick.  Ray's got the money to demand pretty much any woman he wants, but he wants Mirabelle.  Why doesn't Ray love her - as Mirabelle, Danes is plainly luminescent, almost angelic.  Ray is supposed to want her for sex, but ends up pursuing her across the country, fixing her student debt and taking care of her antidepressants.  Before ""Shopgirl"" ends, Ray will have cheated on Mirabelle and then apologized for it.  It's clear that Ray does love Mirabelle, but not enough to let her love him back, and the plot never explains why that is other than dismissing Ray as an emotionally remote guy.  Most of the characters here are remote - emotionally, intellectually, romantically - so that it's their world that makes no sense rather than themselves.

971824,A387BD735MI50R,B000EDWKX8,R. Schultz,"[9, 12]","The best thing about this book-become-movie is the title. The word ""shopgirl"" has such layers of connotation. It has the lavender scent of the Victorian class structure. It conjures pictures of a randy Lord compromising a working class girl, then abandoning her to her disgrace. Or the reverse, it carries the romantic hopefulness of a Cinderella story. When we hear it, we half expect a tale about a poor girl finding her true knight-in-shining-armor. The word conjures all these images, and a thousand more.With this wonderfully evocative title and with so many good critical reviews, I expected a lot from the movie. I was disappointed. It does play off that one facet of ""shopgirl"" connotation in that the movie is about a department store clerk who is wooed by a wealthy older man. But there is no complexity, no layering here that I could find. The movie is more of a flatland, oddly featureless and unlikely.Some of the unlikeliness lies in minor details. For example shopgirl Mirabelle is shown languishing, waiting for the rare customer at the Saks' glove counter all day. I don't think any department store in the current economy could afford to devote a clerk full-time to such a low-demand item.Then there is the sort of jolting unlikelihood of Mirabelle's co-worker as she proceeds to seduce the man she assumes to be Mirabelle's boyfriend. Of course such gratuitous cruelty happens. But this action comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere in the film. It just falls flat. It melts into the generally featureless emotional landscape of Shopgirl.Most of the strange flatness here though lies not in details, but at the heart of this movie's motivations. Or, more accurately, the strangeness lies in the fact that the movie has no heart. I don't mind that it has no discernable plot. I'm old enough not to require any easy beginning, middle, and end to my stories. But when this lack is compounded by a lack of any character development, the flaw becomes serious.No one seems to change much here. Contrary to the Director's Commentary assertions that Mirabelle breaks free and learns to stretch her wings over the course of this film - I thought Mirabelle, like everyone else here, remained dismally static. She exchanges one counter for another, but that's about the only movement she effects. Her one boyfriend spruces up a little, but remains essentially as spacey as ever. And Steve Martin stays true to his original intention.Neither people nor relationships develop here. The characters seem to be just as tentative and awkward with each other at the end of their acquaintanceship as at the beginning. It's as if they are perennially on a first date. They don't seem to build any repertoire of private jokes between them. They don't seem to build a library of mutual reference or common interest. They have nothing to exuberantly reminisce about. It's still and always each person sending out feelers toward another, then retracting those feelers at the first hint of real approach. Everyone acts as molded as mannequins being glided through the oddly art deco of some 1950's-style department store aisles.Claire Danes as Mirabelle does seem to have something stirring behind her eyes. Her face can wax from plain to beautiful, drawing you in to search for underlying currents of emotion.

One is an unreliable, self-centered struggling artist (Jason Schwartzman) and one is a wealthy, dependable older man (Steve Martin). She falls in love with the older man, but he wants her only for physical comfort. The artist can't stop thinking about her, but his tactics at impressing her fail miserably. Despite the simplicity of the story, this film is highly entertaining and intelligent.It is surprising that a film like this could come from The Jerk's Steve Martin, but his comic mind proves to be adept at romantic movies too. He proves that his own life experiences have opened his eyes to the female heart as well as to the conflict between men and women. The transition from novel to film is excellent too, boasting Martin's further talents. The characters are just as entertaining, if not more so, when brought to life.Credit should be given to Danes and Schwartzman as well. Danes is appropriately beautiful and subtle in her performance. She is likable but not saccharine, elegant but not trendy, innocent but intelligent. Schwartzman makes Jeremy quite a character. He is hilarious because he never breaks.

971827,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000EDWKX8,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 5]","""Why don't you love me?"" Mirabelle asks Ray. Mirabelle is in her twenties, Ray in his fifties, and although they seem to have a good time together, Ray keeps her at a slight distance, cheats on her once, wants to keep his ""options open."" Just before Mirabelle asks him, he's cracked a joke about finding a wife, having kids. It's cold, he knows it, he apologizes, and then she asks him.What Mirabelle wants to know is why Ray has no feeling for her. What's clever about ""Shopgirl"" is that we know Ray definitely feels love for Mirabelle, but the question is still valid, and Ray answers by suggesting he doesn't feel anything. Why? Because love as an action is a little more commitment than Ray wants to give.The novella by Steve Martin, who also plays Ray, explains pretty clearly why that is. The movie doesn't, which makes it both mysterious and unfulfilling. Directed by Anand Tucker and adapted by Martin for the screen, ""Shopgirl"" has a ""and so it goes"" attitude about it. Why are these two dating? Yes, there are several scenes of the two rolling about, but that's not intimacy. Like a short story, we're given one-fifth of the iceberg, the rest left for us to imagine what it is these two talk about when we're not watching them. In ""Lost In Translation"" we watched kindred souls. Here, we watch kindred bodies. Which of those is more romantic?It's also a movie where Mirabelle (Claire Danes), despite her questionable choices, comes up smelling roses at the end. Would a depressive walk away so unscathed from this relationship to immediately turn around to have her own art show? It's the typical Sunday night CBS deal of the woman rising, triumphant, as a reward for being the woman in the movie.Danes resurrects her career, to some extent, as Mirabelle, a geek at heart working as a glove saleswoman in a Los Angeles Saks department store. She's aimless and friendless, with student loan bills far too big for her paycheck. She meets a bum around her age named Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), goes out with him, finds him a schlub. Jeremy conveniently embarks on a six-month tour with a band (all through the same desert, apparently), which opens the door for Ray, a computer mogul with money to burn on a girl who suits his tastes.Martin's performance is classy and reserved, with not an ounce of the extrovert he usually plays. Yep, he's a bore. Though Martin presumably based part of Ray on himself, the role plays against what our expectations, and doesn't suit him. There are other men around Martin's age more charming and, frankly, handsome - Pierce Brosnan is one.  While Martin has a reputation among peers and critics as a serious intellectual, his fans know him from ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" and ""Bringing Down the House."" You see the dilemma.Though in real life pretty young women date rich bores just to escape some perceived lifestyle trap - there is a moment where Mirabelle looks at her worn, frail mom and decides to take Ray back one last time -  seeing a movie about such a choice is like eating sushi for the sake of admiring it when you wanted a grilled tuna steak.",3,A cold fish wrapped in a role ill-suited for Steve Martin,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,3092,"['Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Mirabelle', 'Ray', 'Mirabelle', 'twenties', 'Ray', 'fifties', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'Ray', 'slight', 'distance', 'cheats', 'once', 'keep', 'options', 'open', 'Just', 'Mirabelle', 'cracked', 'joke', 'finding', 'wife', 'having', 'kids', 'cold', 'then', 'him.What', 'Mirabelle', 'know', 'why', 'Ray', 'feeling', 'What', 'clever', 'Shopgirl', 'know', 'Ray', 'definitely', 'love', 'Mirabelle', 'question', 'still', 'valid', 'Ray', 'answers', 'suggesting', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'Why', 'love', 'action', 'little', 'more', 'commitment', 'Ray', 'give.The', 'novella', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'who', 'also', 'Ray', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mysterious', 'unfulfilling', 'Directed', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'adapted', 'Martin', 'screen', 'Shopgirl', 'so', 'attitude', 'Why', 'are', 'two', 'dating', 'Yes', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'two', 'rolling', 'not', 'intimacy', 'short', 'story', ""'re"", 'given', 'one-fifth', 'iceberg', 'rest', 'left', 'imagine', 'what', 'two', 'talk', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'watched', 'kindred', 'souls', 'Here', 'watch', 'kindred', 'bodies', 'Which', 'more', 'romantic', 'also', 'movie', 'where', 'Mirabelle', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'questionable', 'choices', 'up', 'smelling', 'roses', 'end', 'Would', 'depressive', 'walk', 'away', 'so', 'unscathed', 'relationship', 'immediately', 'turn', 'around', 'have', 'own', 'art', 'show', 'typical', 'Sunday', 'night', 'CBS', 'deal', 'woman', 'rising', 'triumphant', 'reward', 'being', 'woman', 'movie.Danes', 'career', 'extent', 'Mirabelle', 'geek', 'heart', 'working', 'glove', 'saleswoman', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Saks', 'department', 'store', 'aimless', 'friendless', 'student', 'loan', 'bills', 'far', 'too', 'big', 'paycheck', 'bum', 'age', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'out', 'schlub', 'Jeremy', 'conveniently', 'six-month', 'tour', 'band', 'same', 'desert', 'apparently', 'door', 'Ray', 'computer', 'mogul', 'money', 'burn', 'girl', 'who', 'suits', 'tastes.Martin', 'performance', 'classy', 'reserved', 'not', 'ounce', 'extrovert', 'usually', 'Yep', 'bore', 'Martin', 'presumably', 'based', 'part', 'Ray', 'role', 'what', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'suit', 'are', 'other', 'men', 'Martin', 'age', 'more', 'charming', 'frankly', 'handsome', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'one', 'Martin', 'reputation', 'peers', 'critics', 'serious', 'intellectual', 'fans', 'know', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'see', 'dilemma.Though', 'real', 'life', 'pretty', 'young', 'women', 'date', 'rich', 'just', 'escape', 'perceived', 'lifestyle', 'trap', 'moment', 'where', 'Mirabelle', 'worn', 'frail', 'mom', 'take', 'Ray', 'back', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'seeing', 'movie', 'choice', 'eating', 'sushi', 'sake', 'admiring', 'when', 'wanted', 'grilled', 'tuna', 'steak']",N/A
971828,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000EDWKX8,Scott Schiefelbein,"[7, 8]","Steve Martin's career arc continues its undeniable path toward dignity with the ""Shopgirl,"" the film adaptation of Martin's own novella.  Having left the early manic days of arrows-through-the-head, King Tut, and ""The Jerk,"" long behind him, Martin has moved into that rare air occupied by only himself, Bill Murray, and (occasionally) Robin Williams - great comedians who are also fine ""serious"" actors and storytellers.I have been a fan of much of Martin's later work, including his one-act play, ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile,"" excluding of course his major-studio dreck such as ""The Pink Panther.""  What separates ""Shopgirl"" from his other works is that Martin has finally invented characters who do not talk just like Steve Martin.  These two characters are the young lovers, Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) and Jeremy Kraft (Jason Schwartzman).  There is one character who sounds exactly like Steve Martin, but that is Ray Porter, who is played by Martin, so perhaps that can be forgiven.""Shopgirl"" is ostensibly the story of Mirabelle, a starving artist crippled by student loans and working a dull retail job selling gloves at Saks.  It's no surprise that she's on medication for depression.  So lonely is Mirabelle that she takes an interest in Jeremy, a hugely self-centered ""artist"" (his medium is stenciling, his passion is fonts).  Jeremy is so pathetic that he offers to go Dutch on a movie, and then asks if he can borrow some money.  I won't mention here Jeremy's other creative cost-cutting measures!  The fact that the gorgeous Mirabelle is willing to go on a second date with Jeremy is a testament to how empty her life is.And then Ray Porter walks into her life.  Porter is one of those guys who occasionally pop up in coming-of-age stories for women.  He is rich, intelligent, handsome, and values the intoxicating joy of courtship before taking a woman to bed.  Ultimately, he's just as focused as Jeremy in getting Mirabelle in the sack, but he wants her to really want it first.Mirabelle quickly sheds Jeremy for Ray, and Ray sets about seducing Mirabelle.  For Ray, seducing women is pretty easy, given his vast wealth from software and his considerable charm.  But Mirabelle never asks herself why this charming, rich man is still single.  Could he have commitment issues?  Never mind - at first, Mirabelle is sufficiently happy with the attention Ray is paying her to let this sleeping dog lie.While the Ray-Mirabelle romance progresses, Jeremy begins his voyage of discovery on the road with a rock band promoting his ""designer amplifiers.""  In a typical Martin-esque twist, the rock band teaches the cad Jeremy about the importance of inner peace, yoga, and treatin' a woman right.  Jeremy returns from the road to win back Mirabelle, and now he is armed with his own brand of charm and an awareness that other people have feelings.Everything in ""Shopgirl"" proceeds at a stylish, methodical pace.  Martin knows better than to rush anything, and you find yourself really caring about these three people.Indeed, there is only one jarring problem with the movie, and that is Martin's choice to serve as the movie's omniscient narrator as well as Porter.  This is never explained, and it makes one question who Ray Porter is - is he the actual, flawed human being in the movie, or is he some kind of divine construct used for the Education of Mirabelle?  For such a witty, charming movie, it is a jarring note that is deeply unsatisfying.But fans of Steve Martin have probably already seen ""Shopgirl.""  And it is worth mentioning that Danes gives an excellent performance in ""Shopgirl"" that almost wipes out the stench of ""The Mod Squad.""  Schwartzman lives up to the promise of ""Rushmore,"" and perhaps there can be no higher praise than that.Check it out.",4,"Witty Steve Martin novella takes flight in subtle, somber comedy",1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3785,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'career', 'arc', 'undeniable', 'path', 'dignity', 'Shopgirl', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Martin', 'own', 'novella', 'Having', 'left', 'early', 'manic', 'days', 'arrows-through-the-head', 'King', 'Tut', 'Jerk', 'long', 'Martin', 'moved', 'rare', 'air', 'occupied', 'only', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'occasionally', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'great', 'comedians', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'serious', 'actors', 'storytellers.I', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'much', 'Martin', 'later', 'work', 'including', 'one-act', 'play', 'Picasso', 'Lapin', 'Agile', 'excluding', 'course', 'major-studio', 'dreck', 'such', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'What', 'Shopgirl', 'other', 'works', 'Martin', 'finally', 'invented', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'just', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'young', 'lovers', 'Mirabelle', 'Buttersfield', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Jeremy', 'Kraft', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'exactly', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'who', 'played', 'Martin', 'so', 'perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Shopgirl', 'ostensibly', 'story', 'Mirabelle', 'starving', 'artist', 'crippled', 'student', 'loans', 'working', 'dull', 'retail', 'job', 'selling', 'gloves', 'Saks', 'surprise', 'medication', 'depression', 'So', 'lonely', 'Mirabelle', 'interest', 'Jeremy', 'hugely', 'self-centered', 'artist', 'medium', 'stenciling', 'passion', 'fonts', 'Jeremy', 'so', 'pathetic', 'go', 'Dutch', 'movie', 'then', 'can', 'borrow', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'here', 'Jeremy', 'other', 'creative', 'cost-cutting', 'measures', 'fact', 'gorgeous', 'Mirabelle', 'willing', 'go', 'second', 'date', 'Jeremy', 'testament', 'how', 'empty', 'life', 'is.And', 'then', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'life', 'Porter', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'occasionally', 'pop', 'up', 'coming-of-age', 'stories', 'women', 'rich', 'intelligent', 'handsome', 'intoxicating', 'joy', 'courtship', 'taking', 'woman', 'bed', 'Ultimately', 'just', 'as', 'focused', 'Jeremy', 'getting', 'Mirabelle', 'sack', 'really', 'want', 'first.Mirabelle', 'quickly', 'sheds', 'Jeremy', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'sets', 'seducing', 'Mirabelle', 'Ray', 'seducing', 'women', 'pretty', 'easy', 'given', 'vast', 'wealth', 'software', 'considerable', 'charm', 'Mirabelle', 'never', 'why', 'charming', 'rich', 'man', 'still', 'single', 'Could', 'have', 'commitment', 'issues', 'Never', 'mind', 'first', 'Mirabelle', 'sufficiently', 'happy', 'attention', 'Ray', 'paying', 'let', 'sleeping', 'dog', 'Ray-Mirabelle', 'romance', 'progresses', 'Jeremy', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'road', 'rock', 'band', 'promoting', 'designer', 'amplifiers', 'typical', 'Martin-esque', 'twist', 'rock', 'band', 'cad', 'Jeremy', 'importance', 'inner', 'peace', 'yoga', 'treatin', 'woman', 'right', 'Jeremy', 'road', 'win', 'back', 'Mirabelle', 'now', 'armed', 'own', 'brand', 'charm', 'awareness', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'feelings.Everything', 'Shopgirl', 'proceeds', 'stylish', 'methodical', 'pace', 'Martin', 'better', 'rush', 'anything', 'find', 'really', 'caring', 'three', 'people.Indeed', 'only', 'one', 'jarring', 'problem', 'movie', 'Martin', 'choice', 'serve', 'movie', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'as', 'well', 'Porter', 'never', 'explained', 'one', 'question', 'who', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'actual', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'movie', 'kind', 'divine', 'construct', 'used', 'Education', 'Mirabelle', 'witty', 'charming', 'movie', 'jarring', 'note', 'deeply', 'unsatisfying.But', 'fans', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'have', 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'Shopgirl', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Danes', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Shopgirl', 'almost', 'out', 'stench', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'Schwartzman', 'up', 'promise', 'Rushmore', 'perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'higher', 'praise', 'that.Check', 'out']",N/A

Anyway, I made the mistake of judging a film by it's poster. It looks inviting and somewhat entertaining. Clare Danes is a wonderful talent, Jason Schwartzman is oddly watchable, and Steve Martin is a comic vetran. So what's wrong with it? 1. It's ice cold and distant. 2. I could care less for this group of characters. 3. It's not entertaining!To the actor's defense, it's not thier fault. Well, it is Steve Martin's fault. He wrote it and adapted it for the screen. I mean it has a pretty good premise although nothing new but still promising yet in the end you don't care who she ends up with. To me, this film wanted to be this years 'Lost in Translation' but ended up just lost. And for some strange reason it kind of reminded me on P.T. Anderson's 'Punch-Drunk Love' especially the musical score.  It's no Jon Brion and it just doens't work for 'Shopgirl'. It worked for 'Punch-Drunk Love' because the movie was supposed to be strange. Another tiff I had was with Steve Martin alone. I'm sorry, he's a great comic actor but he's trying to pull a Bill Murray over people's heads. It's not working. He's type-cast to me. The role just doesn't suit him at all. To the director's defense, it is gorgeously shot from start to finish.

971831,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000EDWKX8,Shashank Tripathi,"[11, 15]","Steve Martin's eponymous book was a breeze of a read, a punchy little novella as it billed itself. The movie, I'm afraid, is consummately devoid of that edge. Similar themes have been explored in effortless narratives such asLost in Translation,As Good As It Gets,Ghost World, orWonder Boys, which encapsulate their worlds in such exquisite cadence that the viewer feels immersed in the dynamics of their romances. Shopgirl the movie only scrambles to achieve that depth.The first thirty minutes are painful if not ignorable, as the loneliness of our lead girl from the glove department--so beautifully evoked in the novel's text--gets a short shrift in favor of some irritating antics of a loser badly in need of a haircut and some pocket change. Jason Schwartzman is one annoying weirdo. Was that comedy? Perhaps. For adolescent viewers with pierced tongues.When Steve Martin enters to save the film, he succeeds in making it halfway endurable. But this quickly falls by the wayside as the film careens into syrupy older-man-meets-younger-woman scenes of self-absorption, very few of which ever really resonate with sensibility. He's a successful businessman with commitment issues. Yawn. Tears and other waterworks follow.As though the padding of voice-overs that hit the most obvious points on our heads lest we should miss the film's, um, subtleties, were not enough, the soundtrack is oppressively redundant, straddling between synthesizer slash piano when least necessary, and 70s soft rock when something calmer would have sufficed.Claire Dane's is probably the only real salvo in the film, hence the 3 stars. Her world-weary depiction of anomie and low expectations is one of most pensive, open performances I have seen from her (not that she has an exceptional repertoire against which to compare). Sadly, she cannot alone redeem a film that lacks the impressive gravity of the book upon which it is based. Screenplays matter more than we give them credit for.

Harrell,"[2, 2]","Amid the hubbub of high end department store culture and contrasting bare LA laundromat acquaintance , Mirabelle meets would-be lovers Ray and Jeremy.  Ray is an older jet setting a millionaire limitless in love and Jeremy is a young starving graphic artist clueless about love.  The equation adds up to hard times on both counts for Mirabelle, a lonely artist who enjoys her solitude but clearly craves intimacy.  If you can regard this film as the artfully drawn character sketch that it is, it's fantastic.  Subtle movement and understatement of the inner workings of its characters results in a fairly slowed pace that will end up leaving most movie goers needy.  The one device that should serve to elaborate on the internal transitions and move the plot a mite more quickly is a disjunct narrative lacking finesse, in that it clashes with the otherwise demure presentation.Based on the book written by Steve Martin, this film is a study in emotional reservation, keenly observing how each character deals with similarly troublesome pitfalls differently.  The results are some intensely awkward moments, perhaps even comical situations, and some terribly sad truths.  That grey area between comedy and drama seemed to hinder plot development, as well.  While Danes' skill as a very talented actress with a wide range in expression shone, Schwartzman ruled this film.  As the nervous and quirky Jeremy, Schwartzman pulled out an impressive performance showing vast transition in his character as he grew, yet retaining the odd eccentricities about him that made him endearing.  Martin went a little overboard playing the detached Ray Porter, which I felt made it difficult to have the necessary empathy to accept his tardy realizations about love.  Visually this film is lovely.  The placement of bold color throughout keeps it alive in otherwise drab moments.Ultimately Shopgirl is a bittersweet sweet depiction of how men treat women (or perhaps how lovers treat lovers), and certainly of how women look within themselves to find their worth. Carefully this film underscores how regardless of age or background we all have a lot to learn about love.",3,I can hurt now or I can hurt later,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2155,"['hubbub', 'high', 'end', 'department', 'store', 'culture', 'contrasting', 'bare', 'LA', 'acquaintance', 'Mirabelle', 'would-be', 'lovers', 'Ray', 'Jeremy', 'Ray', 'older', 'jet', 'setting', 'millionaire', 'limitless', 'love', 'Jeremy', 'young', 'starving', 'graphic', 'artist', 'clueless', 'love', 'equation', 'up', 'hard', 'times', 'counts', 'Mirabelle', 'lonely', 'artist', 'who', 'solitude', 'clearly', 'craves', 'intimacy', 'can', 'regard', 'film', 'artfully', 'drawn', 'character', 'sketch', 'fantastic', 'Subtle', 'movement', 'understatement', 'inner', 'workings', 'characters', 'results', 'fairly', 'slowed', 'pace', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'leaving', 'most', 'movie', 'goers', 'needy', 'one', 'device', 'should', 'serve', 'elaborate', 'internal', 'transitions', 'move', 'plot', 'mite', 'more', 'quickly', 'disjunct', 'narrative', 'lacking', 'finesse', 'otherwise', 'demure', 'presentation.Based', 'book', 'written', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'film', 'study', 'emotional', 'reservation', 'keenly', 'observing', 'how', 'character', 'deals', 'similarly', 'troublesome', 'pitfalls', 'differently', 'results', 'are', 'intensely', 'awkward', 'moments', 'perhaps', 'even', 'comical', 'situations', 'terribly', 'sad', 'truths', 'grey', 'area', 'comedy', 'drama', 'seemed', 'hinder', 'plot', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'Danes', 'skill', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'wide', 'range', 'expression', 'shone', 'Schwartzman', 'ruled', 'film', 'nervous', 'quirky', 'Jeremy', 'Schwartzman', 'pulled', 'out', 'impressive', 'performance', 'showing', 'vast', 'transition', 'character', 'grew', 'yet', 'retaining', 'odd', 'eccentricities', 'made', 'endearing', 'Martin', 'went', 'little', 'overboard', 'playing', 'detached', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'felt', 'made', 'difficult', 'have', 'necessary', 'empathy', 'accept', 'tardy', 'realizations', 'love', 'Visually', 'film', 'lovely', 'placement', 'bold', 'color', 'keeps', 'alive', 'otherwise', 'drab', 'moments.Ultimately', 'Shopgirl', 'bittersweet', 'sweet', 'depiction', 'how', 'men', 'treat', 'women', 'perhaps', 'how', 'lovers', 'treat', 'lovers', 'certainly', 'how', 'women', 'look', 'find', 'worth', 'Carefully', 'film', 'how', 'regardless', 'age', 'background', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'love']",N/A

The rare exception is this movie, where Mr. Martin's flaunts an egotistical sense of aloof superiority.  Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms about Martin stepping outside the comedy genre... ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" ""A Simple Twist of Fate,"" ""Grand Canyon,"" ""Pennies From Heaven,"" - all worthy non-comedies.  But he goes off the rails in a big way with this stinkeroo.I don't want to spoil the ""plot"" but let me say there is hardly one to spoil in the first place.  The set-up couldn't be simpler: Claire Daines works in a high class clothing store, she is approached by a total scrounge (Jason Schwartzman) in a laundry mat who wants a date.  They get together a couple times.  Then one of the customers she helps at the store (Steve Martin) asks her out and she begins dating him and stops seeing Schwartzman.  Not much else happens as she has to figure out what she is looking for in a boyfriend.  It's not funny (intentionally or otherwise), and it's certainly not thought-provoking.  It wasn't so much that I disliked any of the characters - I simply didn't give a rat's patootie about any of them (least of all Claire Daines' clueless lead character).Oh, Steve Martin, wherefore art thou?

For a story about connections, and even with a ""happy"" ending, this movie sure felt depressing and alienating. Mirabelle is a young girl from Vermont fresh out of college who goes to Los Angeles to ""begin her life."" She begins her life as a sales clerk at the glove counter in Saks. She then proceeds to sleep with any man who shows any interest in her. She is attractive and intelligent, but we never find out why she seems so desperate and lonely. Nor do we ever find out what she studied in college, or why she settles for such a menial job. The first guy she meets and sleeps with is Jeremy, a weird, poor, stupid slob who acts like he's high on drugs, but that's just how he is. The next guy she meets and sleeps with is Ray, a rich and educated, but detached and insensitive man. Mirabelle completely overlooks the faults and red flags in both men. She loves them both, but she stays with the one who loves her sincerely if not perfectly. This movie is based on a book by Steve Martin, and yet I've never seen Martin act so woodenly, as if he is bored with his own script.

This movie is a cramped, airless nonstory about three people who cannot even say they aspire to a love triangle, because the plot is as thin as Martin's receding hairline.

I didn't understand Ray Porter then and I don't understand him now.Steve Martin plays Ray Porter, a wealthy fifty-something businessman with two homes.  He happens on Mirabelle (Claire Danes), supposedly in her late twenties, working at Saks selling gloves, and decides to ask her out. Danes, with her wide prominent nose, sturdy arms and legs, and dyed auburn always slightly messy hair is wrong for the dark haired and delicately beautiful Mirabelle. But she does a good job of acting depressed, always accepting, and never standing up for herself. And for the film, someone chose for her always to wear rather homely dresses. Mirabelle somehow owes a balance on her student loan of almost $40,000.  With this fantastic education, she works as a salesclerk.  Later she gets a job as a receptionist. And while the men in her life are shown chowing down in their respective homes, Mirabelle takes baths and shaves her legs.  She does this a lot. Mirabelle never gets angry, which is why she's so depressed (but the film doesn't tell you that).She meets Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman)and almost immediately goes to bed with him, although without even consulting my Magic 8 Ball, I could have told her ""all signs point to NO"". But she's lonely and doesn't care. In the novella Mirabelle had two cats which have been trimmed to one for the film. Jeremy is a clueless loser who looks so filthy I expected to see bugs dropping off of him.  This tells you how desperate she is. However, Jeremy soon goes on the road with a band who likes his boss's speakers, and is taken under the wing of one of the group, who insists that he watch DVDs and read books about how to treat women.Meanwhile, Mirabelle goes to bed with Ray, who buys her lots more homely outfits and takes her out to dinner. He tells her they should both keep their options open, but basically leads her on into thinking that they have a committed relationship by all he does for her. He never changes his mind though. When she gets hurt, he's sorry, but not too terribly.  When she asks him why he doesn't love her, he doesn't answer her. In the novella, after they drift apart, he meets another women who he could have fallen in love with, but she won't have him.  But in the movie, the audience is supposed to think that it's impossible for Ray to love. The truth is he's just using her. BUT WHY? It's never explained.A few concessions to Ray's personality are made for the movie-going crowd - he signs a note to Mirabelle ""Love, Ray"" and in the end tells Mirabelle he really did love her. Well, obviously he didn't love her or he wouldn't have treated her the way he did.I found this film to be sad, depressing and the ending totally unrealistic.

That's the rather large question facing Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) in Shopgirl, a film that misses the mark in many ways but is still worth a viewing, particularly if you're a Danes fan.And I've always liked her. Claire Danes strikes me as a very ""honest,"" unpretentious actress. So I was chomping at the bit when I heard about this film. She did not disappoint. But Steve Martin and director Anand Tucker did, somewhat.The script is based on Martin's 2001 novella. Martin also stars, which is fine. But it couldn't stop there. He is not only a character in the movie, he is the film's omniscient narrator. Not only does this confuse things somewhat, it is totally unnecessary. The narrator just telegraphs what we should be figuring out ourselves, adding nothing new, and the last bit of narration robs the ending of much of its impact. You feel like saying ""Shaddup and let the movie play."" Added to that is the fact that Martin reads in a stiff manner, as though his audience were a room of fourth-graders. Add to that the fact that Martin, apparently conscious of his advanced age, wears more face makeup than Claire Danes. Some critics have said he looks like a wax mannequin of himself, and he does.Martin should have spent less time with his narration and eye-liner and more time fleshing out his own character. Because he is a cipher. Early in the film Martin the narrator asks us to ponder why Martin the character chose Mirabelle as the object for his affections. We expect an answer, but it never comes.And the direction: it can be a bit heavy at times. There are a few too many shots where we pan slowly, oh so slowly, to the stars. As many others have observed, the music lays it on a bit thick, but rather than the score being wrong or intrusive, I think it was just overused. (When it works, it works very well, but the director seems to have relied on it as a crutch.) Also, the director makes too many obvious visual parallels between Mirabelle's situation with Ray Porter (Steve Martin) and Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman). The middle is not the clearest in structure or mood; reportedly Shopgirl was held from release for heavy reediting; some of the original cutting is present in the outtakes section. One segment was so condensed that a scene shows Danes in one nightshirt drawing when the phone rings and she rushes to it--in a different nightshirt! Clearly this ""scene"" was assembled from two other, unrelated scenes. It's done so deftly I had to watch several times before I noticed.Okay, now for what works: Claire Danes. She gives a very layered, carefully-considered performance--she is a very perceptive actress, far better than she is often given credit for being. (Meryl Streep says she's her favorite--high praise in my book.) Somewhere in her gut I think Danes realized that Mirabelle can never be Ray's equal, so she creates a persona that Mirabelle puts on around him (perky, doting, not too intimate, always afraid of overstepping her ""place"" in his life while clearly wanting to go farther), and another for how she acts around Jeremy (more casual and more herself), another for how she is at work (bored and disengaged) and one at the end, where she has found some measure of self-confidence (this one is, well, self-confident, and clearly able to absorb and diffuse more hurt). It's a very well-thought out performance that the Oscar folks ignored. I feel bad for Danes...I don't know what else she could have done except bled on the set for this film.Martin is Martin...not the ""wild and crazy guy"" (thank heavens, or I would have ejected this film after five minutes) but a very reserved, slightly charming but distant older gentleman. Jason Schwartzman is good as date-from-hell Jeremy, though he's so over-the-top that he's drawn maybe too broadly. But I guess the director had to set things up so we'd really empathize with *why* Mirabelle chooses an older gentleman who tells her early on he's not in this for the long haul, and not judge her harshly for what could seem like a cold, calculating, materialistic move. It's a fine line to walk.And that brings me to what strangely affected me about this story. We've all seen movies before about pretty women and rich men who take care of them--Disney's Pretty Woman itself is a great example. Most of the time they have fairy tale endings and don't really deal with the relationship issues in any real way.Shopgirl digs deeper. Neither Ray nor Mirabelle is sainted--each does things that made me wince. With him it was the fact that he picked a naive, wide-eyed girl to lavish his attention on, rather than, say, Mirabelle's catty coworker Lisa (played to perfection by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). Lisa's the type who can take on any man, part him from his money, and then spit him out the other side without a second thought. Ray clearly isn't interested in her. Later in the film Ray reminds a heart-broken Mirabelle that ""we had an agreement."" But how could Ray possibly think that he could lavish attention and gifts on impressionable Mirabelle and not have her fall head-over-heels? At times Ray displays a coldness and a callousness that's repulsive, and it's to Martin's credit that he plays the character that way, without explanation or apology.With her, I winced the first time she is in Ray's well-appointed house. He gives her a tour of the place that ends--naturally--in the bedroom. He goes to answer a phone call and when he returns she has completely stripped and is lying on the bed, ready for him, even though they barely know each other. And although she has her falling-outs with him, she continues to take his money and his gifts. It's a very complicated situtaion, and no one is blame-free.But it's about so much more than ""she's sleeping with him for presents/he's giving her presents for sex,"" as some critics have pegged it. There are less complicated ways for Porter to get a playmate, if that's what he really wants. And a scene where he rushes her to her doctor after she unwisely stops taking her anti-depressant medication and almost has a breakdown belies a depth to their relationship that goes beyond the mere sugar-daddy.This is rare in an American comedy. I'd expect this sort of complexity, this grayness, in a French film say, but U.S. movies are usually more of the Pretty Woman sort--she's a whore who's really an angel, he's just a guy who needs someone sweet to get him back in touch with himself. But as Steve Martin correctly observes in the featurette that accompanies this DVD, people change, but not completely. They're still basically the same. There is a moment, after Ray has offhandedly hurt Mirabelle for the umpteenth time, where she drops her chirpy persona, looks into his eyes and speaks to him in a manner we haven't heard her use before: ""Ray, why don't you love me?"" It's a heart-breaking scene. Indeed, we want to know the same thing, even as we understand, and have understood throughout the movie, the simple thing she will not admit to herself--that he never will love her, not fully, not the way she wants, even though it's obvious he needs her for more than just sex.And that's one reason this film worked so well. It treats its subject realistically. Jeremy changes by the end, but not completely. He's still Jeremy, just a more refined version. Mirabelle too changes, and again it's very believable. Does Ray Porter change? That's something I'm not sure about. Martin seems to want us to think he does, at least to a degree. But when he finally confesses his feelings, I'm not sure if we should believe him. Once before he hurt her, she took him back, and he went about his callousness again. He didn't seem to learn from the first experience. Why should we believe he learned anything this time?And that brings us to that last scene, which I shant reveal (and Amazon doesn't permit spoilers anyhow). I will say, however, it's that rare thing in movies, a perfect ending, with every line having wonderful subtext. Without revealing anything, just notice how she expertly puts him in his place when he asks her if she received his birthday gift. It's a great moment. Kudos to producer Ashok Amritraj for getting the film made without a tacked-on hollow happy ending.Ultimately Shopgirl left me with quite an ache even as I was frustrated by a certain emotional vacuum at the same time. I expected a smart, breezy comedy, in maybe the Mike Nichols/Elaine May vein. I got a film with characters I sometimes loved, sometimes hated, sometimes identified with, sometimes didn't. It left me feeling a bit empty, as I saw Ray Porter pass on what might have been a genuine shot at happiness for empty, passionless sex (by his own reckoning) with an old fling, played soullessly by Rebecca Pidgeon. Happiness is so elusive that it really hurts to see it thrown away, especially if you're not sure the character who threw it away has actually learned anything. But that's what the ending had to be.Shopgirl is not a great film. You could even argue it's not a very good film. Yet it stays with you* because there aren't many mainstream movies like this--relentlessly honest, and about the little things in life that, in the end, matter so much. Although it could have been better, it would have been hard for it to be more unique, and I'm willing to overlook a lot because of that.The DVD looks great, with a crisp image, bold brights and dark darks, and the 25-minute making-of supplement is very enjoyable. There's no trailer, and Tucker's self-congratulatory commentary (""This is a really great scene coming up!"" ""I love this part!"") grates. He also talks a better film than he directs, seeing all sorts of relationships that aren't obvious from a cold viewing. Mostly, Shopgirl is worthwhile for Claire Danes. I hope this is the beginning of a career that kicks into high gear.*Read Roger Ebert's review to see just how much the movie affected him!",3,"Murky direction, slight screenplay, but a pitch-perfect

971841,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B000EDWKX8,Thomas Glebe,"[9, 12]","Ray Porter (Steve Martin), Mirabelle (Claire Danes), and Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), are three Los Angeles folks who form an unlikely and uncomfortable romantic triangle, each a true Angeleno ""character"" in their own special ways.  Having lived and worked amongst such people myself in L.A. for nearly 14 years, the movie's greatest strength is its straight-on depiction of just a small sampling of the wide variety of ""lost souls"" in the city of angels.  It's greatest weakness however is a rather pretentious at times portrayal of such characters, and the uneven and confusing manner in which Ray, Mirabelle, and Jeremy initially and eventually behave and interact.Based on a short novel by Steve Martin, ""Shopgirl"" tells the story of three people of extremely different types in the crazy-world of Los Angeles, whose lives meet up once upon a time, with good and bad consequences for all.  In the deepest sense, the eventual shallowness of the film suffers because, having been based on a short novel, each scene and character trait should've been elaborated upon to make it more clear to the viewer just who these people really are, and what they are looking for in life.  Unfortunately, the screenplay thus feels more like a vehicle more suited to something less than a full length movie.  In other words, this would've been five stars had it been half its length, without the (IMHO) unecessary padding and filler.While the characters are all rather believable to a point, at many times throughout the film, the three main ones do not behave consistently.  Therefore, at the beginning, we just begin to believe Mirabelle is just another struggling LA artist (been there, done that), a nice girl from Vermont struggling to make something of herself in the Big Orange, when she easily allows herself to be picked up one night while doing laundry, by a shaggy, truly weird guy named Jeremy.  In a much too quick time, the two strangers basically are hopping in the sack, or trying to.While Jeremy seems like a decent enough chap, though rather alien and quirky, Mirabelle's jumping into bed with him on the second date, when they didn't even kiss on the first, makes Mirabelle almost immediately unbelievable as a good girl from back east.  While we later learn of her psychological problems and while they are evident in her emotionally deadening job, artistic frustrations, and drab home life, it seems unlikely that she would hook up with the likes of Jeremy.In the beginning, Mirabelle seems to realize this herself, and lacking any real sense of self-worth and self-esteem, one day, a handsome, wealthy stranger enters her world in the form of Steve Martin.  Soon, the two begin a love affair as Jeremy hits the road with a bunch of rockers.  For awhile, Mirabelle finds everything in Ray Porter that she ever wanted, including material gains and a feeling of being special she's never really experienced.  There's only one problem however.  Steve Martin's character, for all his basic decency, cannot and refuses in the end to offer Mirabelle's most deep desire.  Just to be truly loved.Throughout the movie, which drags annoyingly in many sections, the main character's motivations and desires are really not too well defined.  We find ourselves guessing at what each's next move or behavior will be, and while this may serve to make a good film better, here, it all seems just too confusing and forced, just to keep the movie stretched to full length.The film aims for more than a few ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and other quasi-cosmic attempts to place this love triangle in context, but Steve Martin's own voice narrating from beginning to end was a big mistake.  Because at the end of the day (and film), it seems as if the whole thing has been told from his perspective. A perspective which is never fully or even partially revealed during the film in his own character's true desires.This is the movie's final undoing, because with a better screenplay and better character behavior believability, this could've been something great.  Why Mirabelle ever sees anything in Jeremy (until the end) in the first place, is never explained.  Why he sees anything in her is likewise, just not there in the script.  Worst however, is why such a worldy and aging, handsome and wealthy man, suddenly chooses a lowly, but pretty Macy's ""shopgirl"" to somehow sexually and materially ""conquest"" without the slightest clue of the possible ramifications, remains unexplained and incomprehensible, till the very end.This is overall a good film and fans of the romantic comedy genre will generally find value here, but it seems as wacky and undeveloped as its characters, and tends more towards rather depressing, uneven drama than comedy.  And the ""romantic"" observations here of three very different types of people, are all over the map, and if nothing, consistently inconsistent.Rent by all means, before buying.  And if you're like me, try to keep that finger away from the fast forward button, which I found hard to do as the film concluded to its again forced and just too convenient and ultimately unsatisfying ending.",3,"Nice ideas, not fully realized or executed...",1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,5117,"['Ray', 'Porter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Mirabelle', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Jeremy', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman',

971842,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000EDWKX8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[13, 17]","Mirabelle (Claire Danes), an artist who has moved to Los Angeles from Vermont, works at the glove counter at Saks Fifth Avenue. She stands at her station, day in and day out, watching the beautiful people spend a lot of money on the expensive dresses displayed around her. After work, she makes the trek back to her small apartment in Silver Lake, maybe works a little on her art, has some dinner, and goes to bed, rested for the next day. Oh, yes. She's lonely as hell and bored out of her mind. One evening, at the Laundromat, she meets Jeremy (Jason Schwartzmann), a struggling logo designer, who asks her out. A couple of days later, Ray Porter (Steve Martin), a wealthy, older businessman stops at her counter and buys some black gloves. That evening, the gloves have been delivered to her door step along with an invitation for dinner.""Shopgirl"", based on the bestselling novella by Steve Martin, who also wrote the screenplay, is remarkably true to the spirit and tone of the book. If you loved the book, you will most likely love the film. If you hated the book, the movie will probably leave you with the same feelings.Steve Martin is developing into one of those personalities who juggles projects that are close to his heart with the more commercially viable projects that he realizes he has to make, so he can continue to make the other projects. So for every ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", we get a ""Shopgirl"". If you are able to successfully vet the `commercial' projects from the more artistic projects, you will be able to enjoy many hours in your local multiplex or in front of your DVD player. Martin has never been a great actor, but he is certainly funny and willing to take chances leading to his participation in films like David Mamet's ""The Spanish Prisoner"" and ""Shopgirl"". He wants to strengthen his abilities and show that he isn't simply a `wild and crazy' guy anymore. He is an actor who can do drama, romance, mystery and comedy. If he occasionally has to make films like ""Cheaper By The Dozen 2"" (yes, the first was so successful, he has made the sequel with Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, Hillary Duff and everyone else in tow), it is a small price to pay to allow him to make the better, more artistic projects he clearly loves to make. My suggestion: avoid any sequels, whether Steve Martin is in them or not, unless you hear a lot of great word of mouth or critical praise. This includes the inevitable sequels ""Wedding Crashers 2"" and ""The 39 Year Old Virgin: Before the Big Bang"".""Shopgirl"" isn't a simple story, despite what you may believe from the trailer. It paints a complex portrait of life and romance in modern day Los Angeles. This and the fable-like quality pervading the entire film help to make it more memorable.What the film does really well is accurately portray life in modern day Los Angeles. Mirabelle had dreams, at one point, and seems stuck in the reality of having to work for a living. She devotes what little time she can to her art, but the effort is minimal, hindered by the fact that she has no inspiration in her life. I know that this happens to many people who come out here to ""make it big"". It is a reality. And the film conveys this well. Because she is so desperate for something, anything to happen in her life, she agrees to go out with the strange Jeremy.Claire Danes does a great job as Mirabelle. Everything she experiences is real and believable and her character's journey is interesting. We understand why she would jump into the arms of the strange Jeremy; she is extremely lonely and needs physical contact. We understand why she would fall for Ray, a man at least thirty years her senior; he is a knight in tarnished armor who takes her on actual dates. He wines and dines her and buys her clothes and expects little from her. As the relationships get mildly more complicated, she reacts in believable ways. At times, she seems like your younger sister. When she is hurt, you want to put your arm around her shoulder and give her a hug.Steve Martin is also very good as Ray Porter. One of his more sedate performances, it works well throughout. As the wealthy businessman who spends a lot of time in meetings, traveling from his house in Seattle to his house in Los Angeles, he has little time to connect with anyone on a meaningful level. When he meets Mirabelle, the connection is there, he just doesn't know what to do about it. His old habits occasionally resurface, providing some tension to the relationship.Jason Schwartzmann is, for me, the weak point in the film. During his first few dates with Mirabelle, he is so over the top it stretches credibility that she would ever consent to go out with this weird guy. He is slightly manic, very nervous and not the most presentable person in the world. Yet, she does give Jeremy her number, they go on a date, which consists of sitting at City Walk (a Southern California monstrosity attached to Universal Studios) and looking at the theater marquee. Miraculously, she lets her loneliness take over and agrees to a second date, of sorts, with him. The performance is so at odds with the rest of the film is seems out of place. The character is necessary to the rest of the story, but he seems pulled straight out of a television sitcom. Strangely, as in the book, this character all but disappears for a long period during the middle of the film. We check in with him occasionally, but it almost seems like Martin had the good sense to get him out of the way so we could concentrate on the two more interesting characters in the film, Ray and Mirabelle.The film opens and ends with similar shots, sweeping views across the Los Angeles freeway-scape. The millions of car lights bleed together to form a sort of abstract painting. Slowly, the camera pans to the stars in the sky (clearly the work of special effects because it is all but impossible to see that many stars in Los Angeles) and slowly moves in on a window in the middle of a sky. Looking through the window, we look down on Mirabelle in her bed. Later, as Ray makes one business trip after another, we follow him into his private plane, as he sits thinking about his life. The camera pans to the window and looks out on a field of clouds. These sequences set the tone for the film, making the story seem like a fable. I would almost call it a fairy tale, but the characters make some decisions along the way which seem hard and remove the overall rosy glow of a ""fairy tale"", so fable seems to fit. These people are in the real world, but the story is slightly romanticized.At times, ""Shopgirl"" almost resembles a play adapted to film. Many scenes involve just Mirabelle and either Ray or Jeremy. In this case, this isn't a bad thing, because it helps to show how insular each of the character's lives are. They don't have a lot of interaction with others, which is why they are so intent on trying to create a relationship with each other.""Shopgirl"" is a good, faithful adaptation of the book and presents an interesting story about three people who form a relationship and bond.",4,Martin's Novella Transferred to the Big Screen,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,7066,"['Mirabelle', 'Claire',

It's a gentle loving film that cares about its characters even while it concentrates on their flaws, and is graced by three strong performances: a very appealing Clare Danes, a wonderful slacker turn from Jason Schwartzman who finds great touches that aren't in the script (thank the lord that Jimmy Fallon dropped out!) and a very generous one from Steve Martin, who never hogs the limelight but keeps his distance while quietly drawing out his character's emotional limitations. Aside from its surprisingly strong visual sense and impressive use of the Scope frame, it's also great on the little throwaway details that cause the deepest pain in relationships - the key breakup is caused by a unthinking joke that is only insensitive in view of the characters' past history. There's also a fine use of third person narration by author Martin, used only at four points in the movie to illuminate desires and concepts that can't be comfortably fitted in as dialog or scenes that adds to the sad awareness of the piece.

She doesn't seem smitten with him and they seem like a unlikely couple.At work, Ray Porter (Steve Martin, 60) ends up buying a pair of long black gloves from her. In a move that would signal a potential stalker, she finds a neatly wrapped package at her apartment with her name and address. It ends up being from the gentleman who bought the gloves.Jeremy ends up going on the road with a rock band for a couple of months, while Ray and Mirabelle pursue a relationship. At the outset, he mentioned that he wasn't looking for anything long term and thought she understood that he just wanted someone to be with and sleep with when he wasn't out of town. She didn't quite take away the same message...Steve Martin doesn't goof it up and his character, the wealthy software magnate, is charming and generous with his money. His understated performance recalls Bill Murray in Lost In Translation. Schwartzmann plays his character as being loopy and awkward. You've got to wonder how many elegant women like Mirabelle would be interested in someone like him, even if they are both artists. There's really no chemistry between them. Claire Danes is very good as the small town girl in the big city. She's not the most attractive woman in the film, with some of the lesser-actresses being truly stunning, like Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Pete Sampras' wife, who portarys the perfume-selling, scheming Lisa. But Danes is very watchable with her big brown eyes, quiet demure, solemn vulnerability and classic beauty.There's some narration in the film by Martin and some good words of redemption that philosophies Ray's mistakes with Mirabelle.

She lives alone in a modest apartment working and biding her time at Saks Fifth Ave as a counter salesperson in the women's glove department. Clair's isolation (she does have some female friends, co-workers at Saks), becomes apparant when she gives her phone number to an off-beat stencil artist (Jason Schwartzman) she meets in a laundry mat.  After a first date that can only be described as wierd, Clair accepts an invitation to dinner from an older man played by Steve Martin whom she meets while working at Saks.  The first exchange between the 2 characters is extremely well written and plausible. Martin's clever move of sending Marabelle the gloves that she thought she sold him shows that male romantic ingenuity is alive and well. As Marabelle's and Martin's relationship becomes more involved the outer shell of each character becomes unraveled.  The subtle use of voice-overs fills in the emotions that torment Martin's character.  The scenes of Marabelle burning the dinner invitation card, returning to her teen room in Vermont, and photgraphing herself are especially moving.  The one scene that is very powerful, yet a bit confusing to me was when Martin calls Clair at her parent's Vermont home.  On a rotary wall phone (brilliant)Clair ponders whether to join Martin in New York for a reconciliation.  The camera cuts to Clair's mom, then back to Clair. Is it that Clair so desperately wants to avoid the simple Vermont marriage that has defined her mother ? The dialogue in the script is wonderfully paced and written.  The Jeremy character would probably have made Johnny Depp jump through hoops to get the part.  Schwartzman almost steals the picture.

971848,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000EDWKX8,Wanda B. Red,"[2, 3]","A sweet morality tale of a film. Claire Danes is wonderfully expressive in the role of Mirabelle Buttersfied, the shy and winsome clerk in the glove department at Saks and aspiring artist from Vermont, and Steve Martin, her 50-something sugar-daddy Ray Porter, shows that he can be courtly and sentimental as well as funny. Jason Schwatzman, as Mirabelle's other suitor -- a raw and unsuave rockster and logo-designer -- plays the role of comic relief, but he is still believable as a lover by the film's end, though I could have done without the bed-trick by-play with the vampy Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. This subplot does verge on upsetting the movie's delicate balance between comedy and pathos.In one of her NY TImes columns, Maureen Dowd offered ""Shopgirl"" as evidence for the way men in our society prefer insubstantial sweet young things to career women. I don't take that to be the message of this film at all. Mirabelle is tempted to life by the older man, who is kidding himself that she attracts him only for sex (the movie is quite clear on this point). But what she really needs, and finally finds, is someone her own age. Love across generations here seems doomed here, I think finally because love is too complicated to sustain the pressure of the age difference. Ray Porter's desire for Mirabelle is a weird mixture of avuncular and exploitative. We are meant, I think, to feel relieved that the two of them do not end up together.

971849,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000EDWKX8,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 0]","Shopgirl is probably Claire Danes' most tailor-made role since My So Called Life. This film is being called by some critics as a combination of Lost In Translation and Breakfast At Tiffany's. To me, this film is a good romantic love-triangle comedy. It's a joy to see Steve Martin abandon those goofy comedies and turn his novella into a heartfelt and realistic portrait of finding love in a hectic city like Los Angeles. Martin had declared that Claire Danes was the only young actress suitable to play the lead in this film, and I think he's right. Claire Danes' Mirabelle character is naive, sweet, and vulnerable, and it's the very reason she attracts her two love interest in the story.Mirabelle is a good girl from Vermont, and she struggles to pursue her dream as an artist while working at the glove counter at SAKS Fifth Avenue in Los Angeles. She lives with her cat in a small low-rent apartment in Silver Lake, and she spend some of her spare time drawing black and white obstract self-portraits. She has an outstanding student loan in the five digits and she can only afford to pay less than $50 a month. Aside from her mundane job and her poor living condition, she's on anti-depression.On a fatefully day, she meets Jeremy(Jason Schwartzman) at the neighborhood laundromat, and they start to go on dates afterwards. Jeremy is logo design artist, and he's even more broke than her, but his bizzare sense of humour instantly charms her. He's really not her ideal boyfriend material, but he knows how to make her laugh. Just when she thought she was going to become more involved with him, along came her second suitor.Ray Porter(Steve Martin) is wealthy businessman, and he has a fancy house in L.A. and Seattle. He bought a pair of gloves from Mirabelle at her counter, and sent it to her apartment with an card enclosed to invite her to a date. She was very flattered and delighted by him. He is completely opposite of Jeremy. He can provide her everything money can buy, and he eventually spent a great deal of money on her, such as fancy dresses, fine dinning, high society events, and he even paid off her overdued loan. She's so taken by him, and thought he loves her, since he treats her like a queen. She decides to drop Jeremy in hoping to become the future Mrs. Porter. Jeremy goes away with a rock band on the road, and he still continues to think of Mirabelle. Just when Mirabelle thought her relationship with Ray was heading towards the next stage, he tells her that he just wanted to keep it a non-committed relationship. This of course upsets her and she steps back from him, because she wanted him to change his mind. When things start to look bleak for her, Jeremy comes back to her life and wanted to start over. Will the rich heartbreaker come back to make things right for her or will she walk away in the arms of Jeremy?This film provides a beautiful original score and the editing and cinematography also deliver the mood and pace well. There is few characters in this film, which allows the three leads to explore their characters in depth. Bridgette Wilson plays Mirabelle's golddigger co-worker. Her ditzy blonde role was very funny, especially the two scenes opposite Jeremy. I was surprised that Frances Conroy(Broken Flowers) who played Mirabelle's mother had just one brief dialogue-free scene. Most of the funny moments is provided by Schwartzman's scenes opposite Danes, but it made it looked like a really funny rom-com for the first half an hour. The often funny Steve Martin is not funny this time. He's actually trying to be charming and sophisticated like Gary Grant or Richard Gere kind of personas. I know a lot of the audiences probably didn't find the love scenes very ""watchable"", considered that Danes is at least 30 years younger than Martin, also Schwartzman is not quite your typical sexy hearthrob, because he doesn't have the kind of body to serve as the eye-candy. Claire Danes was willing to do full rear nudity for art's sake. She managed to delivered the most multilayered performance of her career. I think she might get a Golden Globe nomination if not the Oscar. The bottom line: this film is good date movie, and it's more appealing to the female audiences for sure.",4,All Or Nothing At All.,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,4234,"['Shopgirl', 'probably', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'most', 'tailor-made', 'role', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'film', 'being', 'called', 'critics', 'combination', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'film', 'good', 'romantic', 'love-triangle', 'comedy', 'joy', 'see', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'abandon', 'goofy', 'comedies', 'turn', 'novella', 'heartfelt', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'finding', 'love', 'hectic', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Martin', 'had', 'declared', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'only', 'young', 'actress', 'suitable', 'play', 'lead', 'film', 'think', 'right', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Mirabelle', 'character', 'naive', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'very', 'reason', 'two', 'love', 'interest', 'story.Mirabelle', 'good', 'girl', 'Vermont', 'pursue', 'dream', 'artist', 'working', 'glove', 'counter', 'SAKS', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'cat', 'small', 'low-rent', 'apartment', 'Silver', 'Lake', 'spend', 'spare', 'time', 'drawing', 'black', 'white', 'obstract', 'self-portraits', 'outstanding', 'student', 'loan', 'five', 'digits', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'pay', 'less', '50', 'month', 'Aside', 'mundane', 'job', 'poor', 'living', 'condition', 'anti-depression.On', 'fatefully', 'day', 'Jeremy', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'neighborhood', 'laundromat', 'start', 'go', 'dates', 'afterwards', 'Jeremy', 'logo', 'design', 'artist', 'even', 'more', 'broke', 'bizzare', 'sense', 'humour', 'instantly', 'really', 'not', 'ideal', 'boyfriend', 'material', 'how', 'make', 'laugh', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'more', 'involved', 'came', 'second', 'suitor.Ray', 'Porter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'fancy', 'house', 'L.A.', 'Seattle', 'bought', 'pair', 'gloves', 'Mirabelle', 'counter', 'sent', 'apartment', 'card', 'enclosed', 'invite', 'date', 'was', 'very', 'flattered', 'delighted', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Jeremy', 'can', 'provide', 'everything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'eventually', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'such', 'fancy', 'dresses', 'fine', 'dinning', 'high', 'society', 'events', 'even', 'paid', 'off', 'overdued', 'loan', 'so', 'taken', 'thought', 'queen', 'drop', 'Jeremy', 'hoping', 'become', 'future', 'Mrs.', 'Porter', 'Jeremy', 'away', 'rock', 'band', 'road', 'still', 'think', 'Mirabelle', 'Just', 'when', 'Mirabelle', 'thought', 'relationship', 'Ray', 'was', 'heading', 'next', 'stage', 'just', 'wanted', 'keep', 'non-committed', 'relationship', 'course', 'upsets', 'back', 'wanted', 'change', 'mind', 'When', 'things', 'start', 'look', 'bleak', 'Jeremy', 'back', 'life', 'wanted', 'start', 'Will', 'rich', 'heartbreaker', 'come', 'back', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'arms', 'Jeremy', 'film', 'beautiful', 'original', 'score', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'also', 'mood', 'pace', 'well', 'few', 'characters', 'film', 'three', 'leads', 'explore', 'characters', 'depth', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'Mirabelle', 'golddigger', 'co-worker', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'especially', 'two', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'surprised', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'who', 'played', 'Mirabelle', 'mother', 'had', 'just', 'one', 'brief', 'dialogue-free', 'scene', 'Most', 'funny', 'moments', 'provided', 'Schwartzman', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Danes', 'made', 'looked', 'really', 'funny', 'rom-com', 'first', 'hour', 'often', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'not', 'funny', 'time', 'actually', 'trying', 'be', 'charming', 'sophisticated', 'Gary', 'Grant', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'kind', 'personas', 'know', 'lot', 'audiences', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'love', 'very', 'watchable', 'considered', 'Danes', 'least', '30', 'years', 'younger', 'Martin', 'also', 'Schwartzman', 'not', 'quite', 'typical', 'sexy', 'hearthrob', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'body', 'serve', 'eye-candy', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'full', 'rear', 'nudity', 'art', 'sake', 'managed', 'delivered', 'most', 'multilayered', 'performance', 'career', 'think', 'might', 'get', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'not', 'Oscar', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'more', 'appealing', 'female', 'audiences', 'sure']",N/A
971850,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000EDWKX8,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[10, 11]","Based on the novella of the same name by Steve Martin, this deeply moving, sometimes funny film feels like a glimpse into reality for movie watchers. Here we have characters that are truly affected by what takes place around them. That have real emotions and react to real situations. What results is a slowly-unfolding story of love, lust, and how humans deal with it all.Claire Daines plays a 20-something who moved from Vermont to LA to make a name for herself as an artist. She starts dating a young slacker (Jascon Schwartzman) and soon after also starts dating an older entrepreneur (Steve Martin). Each time she goes on a date with Martin we see the awkwardness that results in an older man pursuing a (much) younger woman. But it's never played off for simple laughs. It is shown to us in a very realistic honest way.Although the film could be classified as a romantic comedy, or a dark comedy, or a light drama... or something along those lines, I don't think it really falls into any of those categories. It's more the story of a young woman finding her way in life. Claire Danes is remarkable, and so are Martin and Schwartzman. The acting in this film really help set the mood, as does the lighting, and cinematography. It really feels like this film was put together very carefully for our viewing pleasure.",5,Surprisingly moving and funny,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1320,"['Based', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'deeply', 'moving', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'film', 'feels', 'glimpse', 'reality', 'movie', 'watchers', 'Here', 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'truly', 'affected', 'what', 'place', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'react', 'real', 'situations', 'What', 'results', 'slowly-unfolding', 'story', 'love', 'lust', 'how', 'humans', 'deal', 'Daines', '20-something', 'who', 'moved', 'Vermont', 'LA', 'make', 'name', 'artist', 'dating', 'young', 'slacker', 'Jascon', 'Schwartzman', 'soon', 'also', 'dating', 'older', 'entrepreneur', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'time', 'date', 'Martin', 'see', 'awkwardness', 'results', 'older', 'man', 'pursuing', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'never', 'played', 'off', 'simple', 'laughs', 'shown', 'very', 'realistic', 'honest', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'classified', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dark', 'comedy', 'light', 'drama', 'something', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'categories', 'more', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'finding', 'way', 'life', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'remarkable', 'so', 'are', 'Martin', 'Schwartzman', 'acting', 'film', 'really', 'help', 'set', 'mood', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'really', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'carefully', 'viewing', 'pleasure']",N/A
