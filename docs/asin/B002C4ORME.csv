It shows what the average people were thinking when we got into the war. It's scenes of combat wererealistic and beleivable. Most important was the manner in which the director andactors addressed the coming home with so many types of wounds. Much research withmedical staff and actual injuries was seen to insure the message was sent on whatis done to help those who gave so much to re adjust to civilian life with their injuries both physcial and mental. Not all our prople came back whole then as nowand it is important to show what was done to help them...I waited a long time for this movie to finally come out in DVD and have watched it several times since itarrived.

1261998,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B002C4ORME,David Baldwin,"[17, 17]","The opening narration by Al Schmid(John Garfield) would elicit a chuckle from anyone from Philadelphia.  He talks about how he used to visit the historic monuments afterschool as a child.  Anybody knowing the geography of the city and where Schmid resided knows that required him to take the 56 trolley car and transfer to the elevated train to get to these landmarks.  Schmid resided in my neighborhood in the Tacony section of the city.  The movie was filmed partially on location there and from the distance I could see the parochial school that I attended as a child.  Hometown pride would allow for a certain degree of bias in reviewing this film.  That's why I'm grateful that ""Pride of the Marines"" is such a resounding success.  The film begins with Schmid living comfortably as a regular Joe carrying his lunchpail to the steel mill and looking forward to seeing his girl, Ruth(Eleanor Parker), and his occasional hunting jaunts.  Duty calls as he's reading the Sunday funnies on December 7,1941 and he joins the Marines.  At Guadalcanal Al distinguishes himself in battle with the cost of his eyesight.  Recuperating at the V.A. hospital in San Diego, the transition is rough on Al with his feelings alternating between anger and self-pity.  With the help of friends and sympathetic hospital staffers Al is able to make the slow transition back to normalcy before returning to Philadelphia and Ruth and an uncertain future.  What cannot be diminished is Al's heroism and his service to his country.  In every aspect this film excels.  Director Delmer Daves uses authentic location shooting to give the film's opening scenes a homey feel.  The battle sequences have an intensity that I found comparable to Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"".  In the film's second half the focus is on the returning wounded and the questions of why we fight are compellingly bandied about.  Garfield probably has the role of his career effectively conveying the transitions his character goes through.  Parker, who I feel is one of the great unsung actresses in American cinema(see ""Detective Story"" and ""Interrupted Melody""), projects warmth and compassion as Schmid's supportive fiancee.  ""Pride of the Marines"" may be one of those films that has fallen through the cracks.  It's not a blatant flag-waver and it's obscurity may be the result of it's understatement.  It's a landmark film that definitely should be sought out.",5,Local Hero,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2409,"['opening', 'narration', 'Al', 'Schmid', 'John', 'Garfield', 'would', 'elicit', 'chuckle', 'anyone', 'Philadelphia', 'how', 'used', 'visit', 'historic', 'monuments', 'afterschool', 'child', 'Anybody', 'knowing', 'geography', 'city', 'where', 'Schmid', 'resided', 'knows', 'required', 'take', '56', 'trolley', 'car', 'transfer', 'elevated', 'train', 'get', 'landmarks', 'Schmid', 'resided', 'neighborhood', 'Tacony', 'section', 'city', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'partially', 'location', 'distance', 'could', 'see', 'parochial', 'school', 'attended', 'child', 'Hometown', 'pride', 'would', 'allow', 'certain', 'degree', 'bias', 'reviewing', 'film', 'why', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'Pride', 'Marines', 'resounding', 'success', 'film', 'Schmid', 'living', 'comfortably', 'regular', 'Joe', 'carrying', 'lunchpail', 'steel', 'mill', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'girl', 'Ruth', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'occasional', 'hunting', 'jaunts', 'Duty', 'reading', 'Sunday', 'funnies', 'December', '7,1941', 'Marines', 'Guadalcanal', 'Al', 'battle', 'cost', 'eyesight', 'Recuperating', 'V.A', 'hospital', 'San', 'Diego', 'transition', 'rough', 'Al', 'feelings', 'alternating', 'anger', 'self-pity', 'help', 'friends', 'sympathetic', 'hospital', 'staffers', 'Al', 'able', 'make', 'slow', 'transition', 'back', 'normalcy', 'returning', 'Philadelphia', 'Ruth', 'uncertain', 'future', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'diminished', 'Al', 'heroism', 'service', 'country', 'aspect', 'film', 'excels', 'Director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'authentic', 'location', 'shooting', 'give', 'film', 'opening', 'homey', 'feel', 'battle', 'sequences', 'have', 'intensity', 'found', 'comparable', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'film', 'second', 'focus', 'returning', 'wounded', 'questions', 'why', 'fight', 'are', 'compellingly', 'bandied', 'Garfield', 'probably', 'role', 'career', 'effectively', 'conveying', 'transitions', 'character', 'Parker', 'who', 'feel', 'one', 'great', 'unsung', 'actresses', 'American', 'cinema', 'see', 'Detective', 'Story', 'Interrupted', 'Melody', 'projects', 'warmth', 'compassion', 'Schmid', 'supportive', 'fiancee', 'Pride', 'Marines', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'fallen', 'cracks', 'not', 'blatant', 'flag-waver', 'obscurity', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'understatement', 'landmark', 'film', 'definitely', 'should', 'be', 'sought', 'out']",Pride of the Marines

Should he dump her rather than be a burden? Lots of self pity.
