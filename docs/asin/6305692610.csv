We see the action of the movie through the eyes of the 10 year-old Fraser and via someone who is observing what is occurring.  The household consists of the family, including Fraser's grandmother who owns the estate, many servants, and frequent visitors.The movie is more a series of vignettes/memories of the Pettigrew family and its more pronounced quirks. Fraser's father Edward, played brilliantly by Colin Firth, is an oddball inventor who runs the Pettigrew Sphagnum Moss Factory - the only one in the world. His two loves are the Bible and Beethoven. His brother, Uncle Morris, visits infrequently but when he does, it can be disruptive, especially when he appears with his very young fiancee, Heloise, with whom all the males become enamoured.This was based on a true story - taken from the memoirs of the former director of the Royal Opera House. I wish I had known this in advance.I cannot finish without commenting on the gorgeous scenery, on the ground and from the air, conveniently shown when one of the many visitors is a colorful and legendary pilot.The final scene of Fraser, sitting in his father's office, listening to jazz, smoking a cigar and drinking milk from a wine glass while looking at forbidden photos was such a hoot!

The father, played by Colin Firth, does mature in the last few minutes of the film, without uttering a word, and it is one of the most powerful sequences I've ever seen on film.  The film alternates between showing Firth as an utterly delightful father figure, because he is a complete eccentric, and as someone who needs to grow up and accept his responsibilities. At the start of the film, he is almost more his children's boon companion than their father whereas, by the end, he is most definitely a father.  The film is told from the point-of-view of his young son and we meet quite a cast of characters, all living on an estate that is owned by the matriarch of the family.  Who will be able to remain at this estate depends upon whom she leaves it to in her will.  Malcolm McDowell, her grasping other son, wants it for himself and to throw the others out.  This is a film the whole family can enjoy.  If you are expecting to see Mr. Darcy though in this film, from Firth's portrayal of him in &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; you will be disappointed.

And if scenery and a top-notch cast could make a good movie, ""My Life So Far"" would be astounding. Unfortunately, the end result is rambling, poorly-edited, with subplots that do nothing and a dull lead.Fraser Pettigrew (Robert Norman) lives in a rambling Scottish estate with his enormous family, headed by his brilliant, eccentric father Edward (Colin Firth) and a strong-willed matriarch (Rosemary Harris). Like most kids, Fraser decides that he wants to know what adults know, and takes steps to find out: He studies his grandfather's collection of classy porn, watches his sister flirt with a plane pilot, and investigates the inheritance rumors flitting aroundBut his studies of adulthood takes an unexpected twist. His elderly Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell) arrives with the beautiful young Heloise (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) from France. As Fraser befriends (and becomes slightly enamored of) Heloise, he doesn't realize that Edward has become infatuated with her (midlife crisis, where is thy sting?). The increasing tension in this family threatens to explode, unless both Fraser and Edward grow up.The settings for ""My Life So Far"" cannot be faulted. The vision of rural Scotland in the 1920s is genuinely lovely. There are plenty of lakes, mist, slightly crumbly castles and beautiful aerial shots of the woods and fields. And when the film focuses on Fraser's determination to come of age, there's a gentle, syrup-less humor to the writing.Part of the problem is sloppy editing. Most of the subplots go nowhere and offer nothing. For example, Fraser sees a strange, ragged old man wandering around, who then dies mysteriously. Nothing comes of this, and no one cares. Similarly, his sister's flirtation with the plane pilot comes to nothing. The script meanders all over the map in a seemingly random fashion and peters out from lack of interesting material, rather than actually ending.Most films hinge on the lead actor's performance, but unfortunately Norman is a very unengaging actor. He doesn't have the sparkle to charm us. Firth and Jacob's considerable talents are wasted; Firth's character flipflops randomly between being pitiful and being a genius; while this is how the character is supposed to be, we don't get to know him very well. And poor Jacob is basically reduced to a walking pretty face with a French accent.When you hear that ""My Life So Far"" is based on the early life of a BBC pioneer and Chairman of The Royal Opera House, you would assume that it's much more interesting than it is. Only a few spurts of humor and the underused talents of Firth and Jacob redeem this at all.",2,My life so far... is a bit dull,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2671,"['Coming-of-age', 'stories', 'appear', 'shapes', 'forms', 'sizes', 'scenery', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'could', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Life', 'So', 'Far', 'would', 'be', 'astounding', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'result', 'rambling', 'poorly-edited', 'subplots', 'do', 'nothing', 'dull', 'lead.Fraser', 'Pettigrew', 'Robert', 'Norman', 'rambling', 'Scottish', 'estate', 'enormous', 'family', 'headed', 'brilliant', 'eccentric', 'father', 'Edward', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'strong-willed', 'matriarch', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'most', 'kids', 'Fraser', 'know', 'what', 'adults', 'know', 'steps', 'find', 'out', 'studies', 'grandfather', 'collection', 'classy', 'porn', 'sister', 'flirt', 'plane', 'pilot', 'inheritance', 'rumors', 'flitting', 'studies', 'adulthood', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'elderly', 'Uncle', 'Morris', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Heloise', 'Ir', 'egrave', 'Jacob', 'France', 'Fraser', 'slightly', 'enamored', 'Heloise', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Edward', 'become', 'infatuated', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'where', 'thy', 'sting', 'increasing', 'tension', 'family', 'explode', 'Fraser', 'Edward', 'grow', 'up.The', 'settings', 'My', 'Life', 'So', 'Far', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'vision', 'rural', 'Scotland', '1920s', 'genuinely', 'lovely', 'are', 'plenty', 'lakes', 'mist', 'slightly', 'crumbly', 'castles', 'beautiful', 'aerial', 'shots', 'woods', 'fields', 'when', 'film', 'Fraser', 'determination', 'come', 'age', 'gentle', 'syrup-less', 'humor', 'writing.Part', 'problem', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'Most', 'subplots', 'go', 'nowhere', 'offer', 'nothing', 'example', 'Fraser', 'strange', 'ragged', 'old', 'man', 'wandering', 'around', 'who', 'then', 'mysteriously', 'Nothing', 'one', 'Similarly', 'sister', 'flirtation', 'plane', 'pilot', 'nothing', 'script', 'meanders', 'map', 'seemingly', 'random', 'fashion', 'peters', 'out', 'lack', 'interesting', 'material', 'rather', 'actually', 'ending.Most', 'films', 'hinge', 'lead', 'actor', 'performance', 'unfortunately', 'Norman', 'very', 'unengaging', 'actor', ""n't"", 'have', 'sparkle', 'charm', 'Firth', 'Jacob', 'considerable', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'Firth', 'character', 'randomly', 'being', 'pitiful', 'being', 'genius', 'how', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'poor', 'Jacob', 'basically', 'reduced', 'walking', 'pretty', 'face', 'French', 'accent.When', 'hear', 'Life', 'So', 'Far', 'based', 'early', 'life', 'BBC', 'pioneer', 'Chairman', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'House', 'would', 'assume', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Only', 'few', 'spurts', 'humor', 'underused', 'talents', 'Firth', 'Jacob', 'redeem']",N/A

When Fraser is ten, his uncle brings his young fianc&eacute; to the meet the family; Fraser loses some of his innocence and the family dynamics begin to change.Based on the childhood of a British media mogul and seen through his young eyes, ""My Life"" is a very gentle, very real slice-of-life story.  Though nothing terribly unusual or exciting happens, we see a real family interacting in a genteel time and place that makes for a very sweet story.  Fraser (Robert Norman) is a genuine kid; he wants to know everything at once, often says the wrong thing, and keeps secrets (or so he thinks).  Gorgeous Colin Firth gives a winning performance as Fraser's absent-minded but loving father who succumbs to temptation.  He's truly a remarkable actor and can convey wonderful emotions with just his eyes.  Rosemary Harris (""Aunt May"" inSpider-Man) is the wise old matriarch who rules the family and is the perfect grandma.I liked the way the characters' dialogue often overlapped each other and at other times seemed mumbled - just like real people speak.

His traditional Scottish family, portrayed just after The Great War, lives the cultured life of the British upper class, but times are changing. Fraser and his eccentric inventor father (Colin Firth) both fall for the lovely French fiance of an older, wealthier family scion, and the competition begins. Feeling belittled by his dad, Fraser vows to exact revenge by educating himself in the ways of the world by reading forbidden books. His strategy works, but there are several comical moments that develop because he does not quite understand what he is reading. The movie reaches a crisis when the family matriarch dies, and the denouement brings major changes. The actors are all well suited to their roles, the scenery is idyllic, and My Life is a charming, gentle story of times gone by.",4,Times gone by,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,886,"['Life', 'So', 'Far', 'memoir', 'engaging', '10', 'year', 'old', 'charmingly', 'acted', 'Robert', 'Norman', 'traditional', 'Scottish', 'family', 'portrayed', 'just', 'Great', 'War', 'cultured', 'life', 'British', 'upper', 'class', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'Fraser', 'eccentric', 'inventor', 'father', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fall', 'lovely', 'French', 'fiance', 'older', 'wealthier', 'family', 'scion', 'competition', 'Feeling', 'belittled', 'dad', 'Fraser', 'exact', 'revenge', 'educating', 'ways', 'world', 'reading', 'forbidden', 'books', 'strategy', 'are', 'several', 'comical', 'moments', 'develop', 'not', 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'reading', 'movie', 'crisis', 'when', 'family', 'matriarch', 'dies', 'denouement', 'major', 'changes', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'scenery', 'idyllic', 'My', 'Life', 'charming', 'gentle', 'story', 'times', 'gone']",N/A

Set in pastoral Scotland in 1920, the film focuses on a 10 year old boy named Fraser (Robbie Norman) whose sexual awakening brings trauma and humor to his family and their staff.Fraser is the son of Edward (Colin Firth), an eccentric inventor and sphagnum moss farmer and his wife Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Moira is an heir to a wealthy family now headed by her widowed mother, known as Gamma (wonderful Rosemary Harris). The family resides in Kiloran, a large estate of beautiful hills, bogs and lochs.When Moira's older brother Morris (Malcolm McDowell) arrives to introduce the family to his much younger 24 year old French fianc&eacute;e (Irene Jacob) both Edward and young Fraser are taken with her.  When Frasier questions his dad about ""feelings"" he's having along with ""wet sheets"" after dreaming, Edward stumbles with an explanation.  Frasier then seeks his own information by researching his grandfather's healthy book collection...complete with photos.Simon Donald's script does a nice job by portraying each character as not perfect or perfectly evil as we might surmise.  The film is ploddingly slow some of the time and requires some patience even with a brief 93 minute running time.  And the ending seemed a bit too tidy for my liking.

It's the 1920s and Fraser Pettigrew is 10 years old.  He lives with a swarm of siblings, a devoted mother, a kindly grandmother, and an eccentric father who invents odd gadgets and invests in strange things (such as sphagnum moss).  Things get even more mixed-up when Fraser's uncle arrives.  Not only does the uncle treat Fraser's father with a kind of affectionate contempt, he has brought along a much younger fiancee - a sweet and musical Frenchwoman.  Fraser, who is becoming curious about sex, and is only just seeing that his father is not infallible, is shocked when he notices that his father pays a great deal of attention to his uncle's fiancee.  A rift in the family looks imminent, particularly when Fraser's mother discovers that her husband desires another woman.In all, My Life So Far is a sweet coming of age story with some troubling episodes, as when Fraser's father childishly competes with him for attention from the Frenchwoman (who, unlike in other movies, is not a home-wrecking siren, but is actually a good woman who is faithful to her fiance).  The movie treats the complexities of family life and childhood with humor and care.  The visuals are also beautiful - the Scottish countryside does not disappoint - and there are other scenes that linger in the mind (a tender dance in the rain, for example).

Rosemary Harris plays matriarch of the McIntosh clan, living with her daughter Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), her eccentric inventor husband Edward (Colin Firth), and their brood of children. Most notable among these children is precocious ten-year-old Fraser (Robert Norman) whose natural sense of curiosity and keen adventurous spirit get him into the most hilarious situations.The family's idyllic existence is threatened with the arrival of Moira's brother, Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell), a millionaire who looks down upon Edward's efforts to keep the estate going (cultivating spaghnum moss, of all things). Morris tries to get Edward to buy into his ideas to revitalize the estate, to no avail. In the meantime, Morris' beautiful young fiance, the cello-playing Eloise (Irene Jacob) beguiles everyone, including Fraser. Unfortunately, Edward too is smitten and a bitter rivalry develops between Morris and Edward. How everything plays out makes up the rest of the story.The casting in this movie is excellent and together with beautiful cinematography, the film makes for a fun and engaging viewing experience. The one flaw here is the the inclusion of side plots that seem to go nowhere - the large, disheveled man Fraser keeps bumping into on the large estate who is eventually found drowned (this just seemed a waste of time), the French pilot who seems to be interested in one of Fraser's sisters (once again, heads nowhere), etc.The actor who portrays Fraser is excellent, for truly he is the star of the show. Fraser epitomizes the sexually-curious young boy keen to learn about sex and other forbidden topics. Some of the most hilarious scenes are when Fraser blurts out silly nonsense, including the scene at dinner; when the guests discuss fundraising activities, Fraser helpfully chimes in that his mom and Aunt Eloise can be prostitutes and service his father and Uncle Morris!
