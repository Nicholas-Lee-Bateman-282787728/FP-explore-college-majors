1137062,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B0012GVMFS,Phillip Kay,"[5, 5]","Mysteriously labelled a romantic comedy, this disappointed the critics who tried to see it as one. It's a fiendishly accurate depiction of the extreme positions we take over love-and-sex. Because it explodes stereotypical attitudes the film takes the form of conversation, the director/writer/actor adroitly blending the Woody Allen subject matter with His Girl Friday pacing. Each actor gets a manic stand up comic turn, each one does a good job with what they've got to deliver. It's smart, wise and funny. Best enjoyed by those who've made a relationship mistake or two and can afford to laugh at themselves. Not recommended for those looking for romantic comedies (which are often just a sentimental look at stereotypes).

The dialogue and delivery is Red Bull fed intellect!  It views like a stage play, and in no way is it a romantic comedy: it is a relationship reality show with a script.My wife HATES the movie!  The dialogue lays completely bare exactly what we all know about relationships but are afraid to admit.  It strikes so close to the pain and uncertainty of many relationships, the shredding of one's heart, because it absolutely exposes the motivations and responses we've all experienced, but does so with humor, a cheeked tongue, and intellectual passion.  Inspite of all the laughs you might feel the pins pricking your heart strings.If you crave understanding relationships in general, especially new relationships, watch this uninhibited movie and absorb the raw truth and wisdom, complete with the F-bombs and sexual descriptions.  But, if relationships live in your scary or insecurity closet, avoid ""What Love Is"" like an STD because it will infect you with the pain of truth.",5,One of my Island Ten movies - Wittiest dialogue seen in years,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1124,"['had', 'live', 'deserted', 'island', 'only', 'ten', 'movies', 'watch', 'rest', 'life', 'What', 'Love', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'Red', 'Bull', 'fed', 'intellect', 'stage', 'play', 'way', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'relationship', 'reality', 'show', 'script.My', 'wife', 'HATES', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'completely', 'bare', 'exactly', 'what', 'know', 'relationships', 'are', 'afraid', 'admit', 'so', 'close', 'pain', 'uncertainty', 'many', 'relationships', 'shredding', 'one', 'heart', 'absolutely', 'motivations', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'so', 'humor', 'cheeked', 'tongue', 'intellectual', 'passion', 'Inspite', 'laughs', 'might', 'feel', 'pins', 'pricking', 'heart', 'strings.If', 'crave', 'understanding', 'relationships', 'general', 'especially', 'new', 'relationships', 'watch', 'uninhibited', 'movie', 'absorb', 'raw', 'truth', 'wisdom', 'complete', 'F-bombs', 'sexual', 'descriptions', 'relationships', 'live', 'scary', 'insecurity', 'closet', 'avoid', 'What', 'Love', 'STD', 'will', 'infect', 'pain', 'truth']",What Love Is
1137064,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0012GVMFS,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Tom (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) arrives home all eager to celebrate Valentine's Day with his girlfriend Sara.  He even plans on asking Sara to marry him and has gathered four of his closest buddies to witness the occasion.  Much to his dismay, however, he discovers upon entering the house that Sara has packed her bags and left him a Dear John letter, effectively putting an end to Tom's vision of eternal marital bliss.  Further complicating the issue is the fact that one of Tom's friends, mistakenly believing he's going to a party, has invited a bunch of hot young ladies from his bar to join in the festivities.You could be forgiven for assuming that ""What Love Is"" began life as a theatrical work, since writer/director Mars Callahan has filmed it in the form usually reserved for stage-to-screen adaptations.  It all takes place on a single set, with the characters declaiming at one another in that histrionic way that stage actors alone are wont to do.  The result is an inert, talky, claustrophobic work riddled with heightened dialogue, pseudo-profundities, long-winded speechifying and manic performances.  Each character is given his moment in the spotlight - whereupon he proceeds to air his grievances concerning women, gays, straights and each other - then hands the microphone off to the next person, who pretty much does the same.Then we get the distaff view of things, as the ladies who arrive for the party barricade themselves in the restroom to discuss at exhausting length the outrageousness and inadequacies of men.Finally, it all comes down to the mixing of the sexes as the party moves into high gear and the characters engage in verbal jousting about the problems and pitfalls of romantic relationships.The movie indulges in any number of requisite stereotypes, ranging from the loudmouthed, homophobic misogynist to the lisping, swishing homosexual (played by Callahan himself) and just about everything in between.In the final analysis, a game cast - which includes Matthew Lillard, Sean Astin and Anne Heche, among others - is let down by inferior filmmaking and material.",2,Exhausting gab-fest,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,2095,"['Tom', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'home', 'all', 'eager', 'celebrate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'girlfriend', 'Sara', 'even', 'asking', 'Sara', 'marry', 'gathered', 'four', 'closest', 'buddies', 'witness', 'occasion', 'Much', 'dismay', 'however', 'entering', 'house', 'Sara', 'packed', 'bags', 'left', 'Dear', 'John', 'letter', 'effectively', 'putting', 'end', 'Tom', 'vision', 'eternal', 'marital', 'bliss', 'Further', 'complicating', 'issue', 'fact', 'one', 'Tom', 'friends', 'mistakenly', 'believing', 'going', 'party', 'invited', 'bunch', 'hot', 'young', 'ladies', 'bar', 'join', 'festivities.You', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'assuming', 'What', 'Love', 'began', 'life', 'theatrical', 'work', 'writer/director', 'Mars', 'Callahan', 'filmed', 'form', 'usually', 'reserved', 'stage-to-screen', 'adaptations', 'place', 'single', 'set', 'characters', 'declaiming', 'one', 'histrionic', 'way', 'stage', 'actors', 'alone', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'result', 'inert', 'talky', 'claustrophobic', 'work', 'riddled', 'heightened', 'dialogue', 'pseudo-profundities', 'long-winded', 'speechifying', 'manic', 'performances', 'character', 'given', 'moment', 'spotlight', 'whereupon', 'air', 'grievances', 'concerning', 'women', 'gays', 'straights', 'other', 'then', 'microphone', 'next', 'person', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'same.Then', 'get', 'distaff', 'view', 'things', 'ladies', 'who', 'arrive', 'party', 'barricade', 'restroom', 'discuss', 'exhausting', 'outrageousness', 'inadequacies', 'men.Finally', 'down', 'mixing', 'sexes', 'party', 'high', 'gear', 'characters', 'engage', 'verbal', 'jousting', 'problems', 'pitfalls', 'romantic', 'relationships.The', 'movie', 'indulges', 'number', 'requisite', 'stereotypes', 'ranging', 'loudmouthed', 'homophobic', 'misogynist', 'lisping', 'swishing', 'homosexual', 'played', 'Callahan', 'just', 'everything', 'between.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'game', 'cast', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'others', 'let', 'down', 'inferior', 'filmmaking', 'material']",What Love Is
