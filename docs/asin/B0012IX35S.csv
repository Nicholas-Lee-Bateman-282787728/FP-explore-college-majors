Unfortunately the stories miss the point.  There is an ongoing plot line that had my interest through ought but some episodes were too pointless for the plot line.One of the reasons I was excited about this show was because it had the lovely Kristanna Loken as Jane, maybe it was the character she was playing but it looked like she plumped up before this series and was in need of some Jenny Craig.The acting was OK but you could tell by the third episode why this show only lasted one season.

Based on the comic books by the same name this series had some outstanding comic book influences and ranks up there with the best comic book adaptions to date. The first 2/3 of this show were some of the best television I've ever enjoyed. The episodes were exciting... original... sexy... action packed... HOT! Then things changed, unfortunately not for the better. Although the show continued to be very entertaining the last 1/3 of the series appears as if the writers tried to make the show more mysterious, more sci-fi. It didn't work. Kristanna Loken is absolutely smoking in this series as Jane.

The stories are interesting, but a bit barren. Within the first three episodes you get the idea of what's going on, but realize that it's more lingo than explanation. And worst is lead actress Kristanna Loken - who got her fame being a naked Terminator - seems to be lacking. I thought she would improve as an actress over time, but it seems to have reversed. Maybe she was affected by her time working with industry hack, Uwe Bolle. In any case, not to just appear like I'm bashing, Kristanna is effectively pedestrian in her performance.

Don't want to give the plot away because with good sci fi watching what happen next is part of the fun.First of all each show is pretty much self contained.  What I mean is it has a begining and a end.  It is not like some series that if you miss one you are lost.  However as you watch you will see the relationship of the main characters grow and there is an ending to the series.One thing I liked a lot about the show was it did not play like a soap opera that had all this stuff about the main characters personal life.  Instead each espisode is more like a mission were the team of main characters must stop a sci fi threat and the personal issues are not brought up instead you just get to witness this very human team in action.Also I really like the team.  Each person seemed real and was able to act and emote very well.  This is a show were the actors were picked for their acting ability first and they also looked the part, but the acting was priority.Also each episode was done very well.  Out of all 22 I didn't think any were filler.Also I liked the fact that the violence was there but not sick, also their was not cussing or God's name in vain.I originally wanted to watch it because the hot Kristina Loken from Terminator 3 was in it, but it turned out to be so much more.Highly recommeded,Kevin",5,great sci fi,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,1388,"['Hi', 'Just', 'finished', 'watching', '22', 'episodes', 'netflix.This', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'good', 'sci', 'fi', 'watching', 'what', 'happen', 'next', 'part', 'fun.First', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'self', 'contained', 'What', 'mean', 'begining', 'end', 'not', 'series', 'miss', 'one', 'are', 'lost', 'However', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'relationship', 'main', 'characters', 'grow', 'ending', 'series.One', 'thing', 'liked', 'lot', 'show', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'soap', 'opera', 'had', 'stuff', 'main', 'characters', 'personal', 'life', 'Instead', 'espisode', 'more', 'mission', 'were', 'team', 'main', 'characters', 'must', 'stop', 'sci', 'fi', 'threat', 'personal', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'brought', 'up', 'instead', 'just', 'get', 'witness', 'very', 'human', 'team', 'action.Also', 'really', 'team', 'person', 'seemed', 'real', 'was', 'able', 'act', 'emote', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'were', 'actors', 'were', 'picked', 'acting', 'ability', 'first', 'also', 'looked', 'part', 'acting', 'was', 'priority.Also', 'episode', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', '22', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'filler.Also', 'liked', 'fact', 'violence', 'was', 'there', 'not', 'sick', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'cussing', 'God', 'name', 'vain.I', 'originally', 'wanted', 'watch', 'hot', 'Kristina', 'Loken', 'Terminator', '3', 'was', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more.Highly', 'recommeded', 'Kevin']",Painkiller Jane

Durham ""Big Evil""","[30, 34]","Freely adapted from its Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada-penned comic book origins and stylings, Painkiller Jane is definitely not the worst original series to hit the Sci-Fi Channel, and is good mindless fun for what it's worth.  Terminator 3 and Bloodrayne hottie Kristanna Loken is Jane Vasco; a DEA agent that is recruited by a government agency.  She now finds herself hunting genetically altered and enhanced criminals, or ""Neuros"", and soon discovers that she too has some strange abilities of her own, including the ability to heal from any injury.  Throughout this first (and only) season of Painkiller Jane, Jane and her crew hunt these superpowered individuals, which leads to plenty of banter, fighting, and explosions.  There really isn't much else to the show other than that, as things pretty much get wrapped up as the series comes to a close with Jane's allegiance coming into question.  Loken, who was basically eye candy in Terminator 3 and had the thankless lead role in Bloodrayne, is pretty wooden throughout the series.  She looks quite good though, and the supporting cast, namely Noah Danby as Connor and Sean Owen Roberts as Riley, are pretty good.  That being said, you pretty much know what you're getting with Painkiller Jane.  It doesn't strike the gold that other Sci-Fi shows like Farscape, The Invisible Man, or The Dresdin Files did and does, but it is mindless, entertaining fun that sadly never got the chance to really grow on what it set up before getting the axe.  All in all, if you're a fan of the comic and missed out on the show when it aired on Sci-Fi, Painkiller Jane is worth a look, but don't expect much out of it.",3,"Mindless, entertaining fun that never got the chance to grow",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1661,"['Freely', 'adapted', 'Jimmy', 'Palmiotti', 'Joe', 'Quesada-penned', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'stylings', 'Painkiller', 'Jane', 'definitely', 'not', 'worst', 'original', 'series', 'hit', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'good', 'mindless', 'fun', 'what', 'worth', 'Terminator', '3', 'Bloodrayne', 'hottie', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'Jane', 'Vasco', 'DEA', 'agent', 'recruited', 'government', 'agency', 'now', 'hunting', 'genetically', 'altered', 'enhanced', 'criminals', 'Neuros', 'soon', 'discovers', 'too', 'strange', 'abilities', 'own', 'including', 'ability', 'heal', 'injury', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'Painkiller', 'Jane', 'Jane', 'crew', 'hunt', 'superpowered', 'individuals', 'plenty', 'banter', 'fighting', 'explosions', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'show', 'other', 'things', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'series', 'close', 'Jane', 'allegiance', 'coming', 'question', 'Loken', 'who', 'was', 'basically', 'eye', 'candy', 'Terminator', '3', 'had', 'thankless', 'lead', 'role', 'Bloodrayne', 'pretty', 'wooden', 'series', 'quite', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'namely', 'Noah', 'Danby', 'Connor', 'Sean', 'Owen', 'Roberts', 'Riley', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'being', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Painkiller', 'Jane', ""n't"", 'strike', 'gold', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'shows', 'Farscape', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Dresdin', 'Files', 'did', 'mindless', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'sadly', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'really', 'grow', 'what', 'set', 'up', 'getting', 'axe', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', 'missed', 'out', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'Sci-Fi', 'Painkiller', 'Jane', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much']",Painkiller Jane

1137510,AFV2584U13XP3,B0012IX35S,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 8]","Like a few other box sets I got this during the X-mas month sale and now sadly regret that choice.  The series seems to try and be a mix of the series Alias and X-files but falls flatly on its face,  the series shows a shadow government agency in charge of capturing people who have unusual abilities and powers called Neuros and while not all these Neuros are evil the agency feels it's their right to take them into custody by choice or force.  With the series intro we see the story of Jane Vasco who was once a D.E.A agent but because of certain situations and her own unique ability of regenerating from near death injuries becomes part of this shadow agencies group.  The episodes have the standard fights and explosions but the story arcs per episodes and through out the series is ultimately so bland and boring you can't seem to make yourself watch a whole episode through to the end.  The supporting cast while not the worst actors and actresses are far from being great either except for maybe one or two, and of course you'll get your standard inner agency romantic story-plot as well but again it does nothing to help this sad show.  I think the reason I ultimately got this was because of Kristanna Loken from the Terminator 3 movie as well as another show which I somewhat liked as well, and again sadly her character's story background and probably the director made her character seem so two-dimensional and stiff it was hard to watch her go through this every episode until it was thankfully canceled.  I can't say this is the worst series I've ever watched but it comes a close second so if you like seeing actions shows with hard-core fighting women I say a good choice is the Alias series which was both very entertaining and fun to watch unlike this poor series...",2,Painkliier May Be Part Of The Series Name But It Should Be More Of PainMaker For Having To Watch This Series Instead,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,1786,"['few', 'other', 'box', 'sets', 'got', 'X-mas', 'month', 'sale', 'now', 'sadly', 'regret', 'choice', 'series', 'try', 'be', 'mix', 'series', 'Alias', 'X-files', 'flatly', 'face', 'series', 'shadow', 'government', 'agency', 'charge', 'capturing', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'unusual', 'abilities', 'powers', 'called', 'Neuros', 'not', 'Neuros', 'are', 'evil', 'agency', 'right', 'take', 'custody', 'choice', 'force', 'series', 'intro', 'see', 'story', 'Jane', 'Vasco', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'D.E.A', 'agent', 'certain', 'situations', 'own', 'unique', 'ability', 'regenerating', 'death', 'injuries', 'part', 'shadow', 'agencies', 'group', 'episodes', 'have', 'standard', 'fights', 'explosions', 'story', 'arcs', 'episodes', 'series', 'ultimately', 'so', 'bland', 'boring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'watch', 'whole', 'episode', 'end', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'worst', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'far', 'being', 'great', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'course', ""'ll"", 'get', 'standard', 'inner', 'agency', 'romantic', 'story-plot', 'well', 'again', 'nothing', 'help', 'sad', 'show', 'think', 'reason', 'ultimately', 'got', 'was', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'Terminator', '3', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'somewhat', 'liked', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'sadly', 'character', 'story', 'background', 'probably', 'director', 'made', 'character', 'seem', 'so', 'two-dimensional', 'stiff', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'go', 'episode', 'was', 'thankfully', 'canceled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'worst', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'close', 'second', 'so', 'like', 'seeing', 'actions', 'hard-core', 'fighting', 'women', 'say', 'good', 'choice', 'Alias', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'poor', 'series']",Painkiller Jane
