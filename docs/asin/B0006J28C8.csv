870359,A1MMO3T0I18PFW,B0006J28C8,Chris Roberts,"[2, 2]","Blue Citrus Hearts was one of those films you buy out of curiosity because Amazon associates it with a lot of the films that you like and enjoy.  I'm a huge indie fan and this sounded sweet and had some positive critical review behind it, so I took the chance.  I can't say that I'm upset that I saw it, but honestly it hasn't really changed me in any way as good cinema ought to.First, the good: Paul Foster as Julien is wonderful.  He's charming, interesting, beautiful, and lights up every scene that he's in.  I would be very excited to see him in something that displayed his talents better.  Lee Ann Roberts as Sam's mother and Helen Bowman as Sam's grandmother were both very good and made the most of their few moments on the screen.  I have nothing against the ""two boys fall in love and it's tough"" script; it's pretty much what one expects from a low-budget indie.  It's a very rough effort that tries hard but the writer clearly needs more life and experience to really grab hold of an issue and do something revelatory with it.And then, the bad: The camera-work is pretty much unforgivable.  I completely understand that it's a budgetless indie, but the cinematography in BCH is a step below what you see people doing with their cell phones and posting on YouTube these days.  The shaking, the awkward angles, and the crappy lighting all made the film very difficult to watch.  If there's something worse than what they did with the camera, then it's the audio mix.  The ambient sound made parts of the film un-hearable and some elements were so loud that you just wanted to press 'stop.'  I have probably never encountered a movie ever that I so wanted to stop watching on account of the audio.  The soundtrack was horrific; it sounded like they went down skid row and had all the drugged-out buskers sing into a microphone whatever they could make up at that moment and decided to call that the movie's musical score.  Alex Booth as Arielle and Suzie Cyanide as the local tranny were grating and terrible.  Cyanide in particular spent chunks of his time staring right at the camera as if reading his few lines off a cue card - it was very uncomfortable to watch.But the real problem here is a complete lack of direction.  Several times through the film, the actors are just kind of sitting there looking at people behind the 4th wall spitting out dialogue that they seem to be improvising as they go.  They don't understand what's supposed to be happening at that moment in time, they're not telling us any part of a story, and that is entirely the fault of the Director.  If someone had effectively been able to get the actors to understand what they were supposed to be doing and feeling throughout the script, this movie would have been much improved.I don't know what to say about the star, Joshua Peter Laurenzi.  He's not a good actor, but he's not unwatchable.  Again, it seems the Director just told him, ""hey, you're full of angst and unhappy"" and then started filming him as he did whatever he wanted to do.All the badness aside though, there's something endearing about watching such rawness.  We were all teenagers and a lot of the issues are familiar.  The film just tries way to hard to be the most indie indie-film ever when it would have done much better to actually create something less painful to look at with some sense that the characters themselves believed that they were not just actors.  If this were made by junior high school students (and make no mistake, it looks as though it was), then I'd say ""good job, kids.""  As an effort by adults; however, it just didn't win me over despite the charming Paul Foster and some not-terrible motivating ideas.  If it's showing on cable some time, see it.  I can't recommend it as a purchase though.",2,Tries so hard at all the wrong things.,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,3780,"['Blue', 'Citrus', 'Hearts', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'buy', 'curiosity', 'Amazon', 'lot', 'films', 'like', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'huge', 'indie', 'fan', 'sounded', 'sweet', 'had', 'positive', 'critical', 'review', 'took', 'chance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'upset', 'saw', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'really', 'changed', 'way', 'good', 'cinema', 'ought', 'to.First', 'good', 'Paul', 'Foster', 'Julien', 'wonderful', 'charming', 'interesting', 'beautiful', 'lights', 'up', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'something', 'displayed', 'talents', 'better', 'Lee', 'Ann', 'Roberts', 'Sam', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Bowman', 'Sam', 'grandmother', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'made', 'most', 'few', 'moments', 'screen', 'have', 'nothing', 'two', 'boys', 'fall', 'love', 'tough', 'script', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'one', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'very', 'rough', 'effort', 'hard', 'writer', 'clearly', 'more', 'life', 'experience', 'really', 'grab', 'hold', 'issue', 'do', 'something', 'revelatory', 'it.And', 'then', 'bad', 'camera-work', 'pretty', 'much', 'unforgivable', 'completely', 'understand', 'budgetless', 'indie', 'cinematography', 'BCH', 'step', 'what', 'see', 'people', 'doing', 'cell', 'phones', 'posting', 'YouTube', 'days', 'shaking', 'awkward', 'angles', 'crappy', 'lighting', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'something', 'worse', 'what', 'did', 'camera', 'then', 'audio', 'mix', 'ambient', 'sound', 'made', 'parts', 'film', 'un-hearable', 'elements', 'were', 'so', 'loud', 'just', 'wanted', 'press', ""'stop"", 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'encountered', 'movie', 'ever', 'so', 'wanted', 'stop', 'watching', 'account', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'horrific', 'sounded', 'went', 'down', 'skid', 'row', 'had', 'drugged-out', 'buskers', 'sing', 'microphone', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'moment', 'decided', 'call', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'Alex', 'Booth', 'Arielle', 'Suzie', 'Cyanide', 'local', 'tranny', 'were', 'grating', 'terrible', 'Cyanide', 'particular', 'spent', 'chunks', 'time', 'staring', 'right', 'camera', 'reading', 'few', 'lines', 'cue', 'card', 'was', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'watch.But', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'complete', 'lack', 'direction', 'Several', 'times', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'kind', 'sitting', 'looking', 'people', '4th', 'wall', 'spitting', 'out', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'be', 'improvising', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'happening', 'moment', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'telling', 'part', 'story', 'entirely', 'fault', 'Director', 'someone', 'had', 'effectively', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'actors', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'feeling', 'script', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'improved.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'star', 'Joshua', 'Peter', 'Laurenzi', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'Again', 'Director', 'just', 'told', 'hey', ""'re"", 'full', 'angst', 'unhappy', 'then', 'started', 'filming', 'did', 'whatever', 'wanted', 'do.All', 'badness', 'aside', 'something', 'endearing', 'watching', 'such', 'rawness', 'were', 'teenagers', 'lot', 'issues', 'are', 'familiar', 'film', 'just', 'way', 'hard', 'be', 'most', 'indie', 'indie-film', 'ever', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'actually', 'create', 'something', 'less', 'painful', 'look', 'sense', 'characters', 'believed', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'actors', 'were', 'made', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'make', 'mistake', 'was', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'job', 'kids', 'effort', 'adults', 'however', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'charming', 'Paul', 'Foster', 'not-terrible', 'motivating', 'ideas', 'showing', 'cable', 'time', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'purchase', 'though']",Blue Citrus Hearts

However, as the film progressed, the film maker's style became clearer, the characters became ""more real"" and more importantly more interesting. By the end of the film I could truly empathize with the lead character - he really did a great job of convey his emotional pain as did the director in moving this story forward and painting a picture of ""realism"". I felt the film could have used a bit tighter editing (some of the classroom scenes seemed a bit disconnected), there was an apparent lacking in skill with some of the actors and the ending was a bit unbelievable for me (I really did not feel these characters shared a ""physical"" attraction and the ""jump"" seemed a bit unbelievable).

What this is a slowly paced, heartfelt, honest little movie that has, if one allows it to, the power to move you profoundly.  There is a sometimes arthouse pretentiousness that is not inappropriate here, which in fact reveals the deceptively simple story as the myriad of complex emotional issues that as the film's base.The story of two teenage boys in Memphis - from extraordinarily opposite homes, finding their way through friendship and sexuality while dealing with the complexities of highschool, teenage romance, angst, fitting in, the desire for popularity and the odd desire of wanting to be misunderstood and alone.Joshua Peter Laurenzi (Sam) and Paul Foster (Julian) are outstanding as the ""heros"" of the story; unremarkable, ordinary boys learning to cope with emotions they fear and possibly can't understand.Director Jon Fox strikes the right balance, lights the film beautifully, at times allowing primary colors to wash over the entire screen.  Another nice touch is having the poetry to flow across the screen (I'm assuming Sam's) adding a rich layer of emotion to an already overwhelming experience.I've read many negative criticisms here (and elsewhere) so I suppose this is one of those no-budget indies that speaks strongly to some while others can't seem to find its remarkable heart.

870364,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006J28C8,Grady Harp,"[13, 15]","BLUE CITRUS HEARTS as conceived, written, produced, directed, etc by Morgan Jon Fox is one of those films that has a core of honesty and passion for the message that makes you want to love it.  Apparently filmed on a digital camera with no accoutrements available to the other Indie film makers, Fox makes the most of a no-budget situation and perseveres in making a statement about gay crises in high school kids who must fight for their identity in an inhospitable world - this time Memphis, TN serving as the Anyplace, USA.Sam (Joshua Peter Laurenzi) is a quiet teenager who lives with grotesquely ignorant parents (Lee Ann Roberts and Mark Pergolizzi - both pushing the borders of credibility) who wants to take guitar lessons and have a car but is refused both by grounded parents who feel he is a loser.  Julien (Paul Foster) is a quiet guy who daydreams,  and spends his idle hours in coffee shops, but differs from Sam in that his single mother (Emily Fry) is a loving, caring, present person.  They both attend a high school that  seems in the rank and file of most, both have girlfriends (I think the better of the two may be Alex Booth, but the credits are minimal), and both feel something is missing in their lives.  Sam and Julien struggle through this film, trying to communicate with themselves, with friends and finally with each other - discovering what they fear most, that they are gay.Yes, this is a tale universal and yes, Fox manages some good effects superimposing his poetry over the picture screen, poetry that is better than the script thoughts.  The problem here is not the story telling, fragmented as that is, but in the actual product of the film. The soundtrack is so loud that it drowns the dialogue.  And that is not only the very raw 'music track': the ambient sound of trains and cars and just plain noise is enough to make many folks just stop watching out of frustration at not hearing the storyline.Fox has gathered some credible non-professional folks to enact this journey - some even with evident talent that may take them beyond this particular project.  For a first film by a wannabe filmmaker this is a brave and in some ways successful attempt.  Hopefully next time around Fox can  clean up the distractions and focus more on production techniques that would move his talent into the public arena.
