1318940,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0032KC36Y,Jeffery Mingo,"[13, 13]","Years ago, I saw a doc on Machu Picchu (hereinafter ""MP"") and it was dull.  It only spoke of the stone structure and not the people and culture who made it.  Stonehenge is impressive as it shows human ingenuity and how it spans the millennia.  However, it's also just some rocks.  Some docs on MP discuss it in that same dull matter.  This work breaks that unfortunate pattern.This work spoke about skeletons found, how Incan descendants have blended pre-Colombian and Christian practices, irrigation, etc.  MP is not just some stones; this work shows that it has an elaborate system to deal with all the rain in that high region.  It speaks of how a culture without the wheel, iron, or writing could make such a fantastic site.  It discusses why the conquistadores never found MP.This work has a blend of experts interviewed: Latino and Anglo; male and female.  There are reenactments here, but they are well-done, rather than cheesy.  I think parents who have children that love ""The Emperoro's New Groove"" may want to show this to their young ones for educational purposes.  Some anthropologists have lamented that their field is dismissed as ""just stones and bones.""

1318941,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B0032KC36Y,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[1, 1]","I visited Machu Picchu earlier this year for the first time ever, and prepared myself by reading the recently published ""Turn Right at Machu Picchu"" as well as Hiram Bingham's book, ""Lost City of the Incas"". I also watched a couple of other documentaries.The ""Ghosts of Machu Picchu"" brings it all together in a useful and succinct manner. Local historians and archaeologists as well as academics from the U.S. who were interviewed for the documentary continue to study the site and surrounding area to determine why the city was built on the top of the mountain and why it survived the Spanish conquest virtually intact. Advancements in the tools of bone analysis have allowed the scientists to debunk some of Bingham's original theories and to conclude that the site was a retreat for the Inca Ruler, Pachacutec, and that most of the inhabitants were there to serve the ruler. They believe that the site was abandoned some time after Pachacutec was defeated by the Spaniards, and that the conquerors never knew of its existence; thus it was left to grow over with vegetation and fade from memory without being destroyed.The photography of the site is spectacular, and the documentary includes information on the Incan stonework and architecture, as well as the intricate system of terraces and fountains that survive to this day on the mountain top.

What particularly impressed me was how the structure of the documentary was set up in such a way that it modeled the process of scientific inquiry: hypothesis, information gathering, and proposed results.  It didn't just tell the viewer the ""facts"" of the site but positioned him or her as a scholar testing the the ways that the site been interpreted over the years.  I think this would be a good documentary to show a class, as they would get both the information and experience the process of creating and testing information.  The music is somewhat History Channel, but I suspect PBS has to do things like that or people won't watch.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[20, 21]","I had the wonderful experience of visiting Machu Picchu - the lost city of the Incas - in 1980 and it was - along with seeing the Great Wall of China - one of the most breathtaking sights I've ever seen. Since then, I've been fascinated by this ""hidden city"" from the 16th Century discovered by explorer Hiram Bingham in 1912. There have been a few documentaries made but they tend to be more of a travelogue. This show is different.Produced by PBS as part of its NOVA science series - it is really a co-production of National Geographic magazine (which first published Bingham's own story in 1915). This not only gives it creditability but some entertainment value too. (National Geographic's own specials are always well done.). There are a few interviews with scientists and researchers as well as some ""recreations"" (which, personally I found distracting and the reason for four stars, rather than five.) but mostly it is beautiful camera work showing, not only Machu Picchu from every angle, but the neighboring cities.There is also NEWS here. The researcher who analyses bones has been able to determine the sex of the bodies found at the site as well as the level in society. These were ""middle class people.. They don't have all the answers yet but there are new discoveries revealed here. The film runs about 54 minutes and so it doesn't go in to the depth it could but it will hold your attention.If you already know about Machu Picchu, you will learn more.
