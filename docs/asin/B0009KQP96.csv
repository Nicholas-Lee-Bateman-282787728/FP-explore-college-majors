TBS has aired this show at 7 am for years now. I admit watching Dustin Diamond probably made me not want to watch the show with his recent behavior. The shows are jumbled with the introduction of the new girl and the subtraction of Kelly and Jesse and then epsiodes of Kelly and Jesse minus Terry. Usually the introduction of a new character in a tv series means the death of the show but this is an expection.

Why they released (generally inferior) The College Years ahead of this, out of order, is a mystery.  This last season presented an unusual scenario: NBC wanted more episodes after they finished taping, and when Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani Amber Thiessen weren't available, NBC subsituted biker chick Tori to replace them.

907887,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0009KQP96,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[1, 1]","Yes, I was one of those kids that would run home everyday after school so I could watch the reruns of Saved By The Bell. One channel aired back-to-back episodes and at the same time another channel would air one episode. All my classmates watched the series and even my parents would watch on Saturday mornings.After the series had filmed its last episode in which the characters had their high school graduation, NBC ordered more episodes. Actresses Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) had already moved on to film projects are were not available to participate in new episodes. Therefore a new character was created - Tori Scott (played by Leanna Creel).Just like the two previous DVD sets, the episodes are out of order, going more by the syndication order. That's why the characters look older in one episode and a lot younger in the next. A few episodes have Jesse and Slater as a couple, but they broke up during season four!The new student Tori becomes Zack's girlfriend and befriends Screech, Slater, and Lisa, but for some reason she never meets Kelly or Jesse. As I stated above the actresses who played the parts didn't return, but there names could have been mentioned more often. Continuity errors? Or were the characters Jesse and Kelly doing something else when Tori was around? After almost twenty years it is still a mystery to me.The episodes on Season Five are:Disc 1:The FightStudent Teacher WeekScreech's Spaghetti SauceThe New GirlThe Bayside TriangleTeen LineMasquerade BallDay of DetentionDisc 2:Wrestling with the FutureDrinking and DrivingClass RingsLove MachineIsn't It RomanticThe WillThe Teacher's StrikeSlater's SisterDisc 3:The Senior PromThe Video YearbookSnow White and the Seven DorksEarthquakesThe Best Summer of My LifeSchool SongGraduationTime CapsuleThe previous sets had cheap cases with horrible menus, but for some reason Lionsgate decided to change everything for the season five set. This set has a wonderful slipcover with the episode guide written on the inner pullout case. The menu on each disc has a neat little red bell ringing when you go to each episode. This is the only season set to include an actually bonus which is a documentary about the series.I bought the DVD off of Amazon.com for fewer than eleven dollars and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.

My favorite characters are Zack Morris and Lisa Turtle. But the show would also be missing a lot if the other characters weren't present. I love Jessie's independent, feminist personality though sometimes it was exaggerated a bit. Kelly character was great, she was so sweet and kind. Then there was Lisa whom was the assertive one, loved her style. Zack Morris was Just so darn handsome. Then Slater the sexy jock. I think screeh's character was the least liked, though his humor does get you laughing and in a good mood. I have all season of Saved by the bell on DVD,seasons 1,2,3,4, and 5. Though the quality of seasons 1,2,3,&4 weren't great, it wasn't bad either. The best seasons to me are 3 and 4. But with season 5 it was a different story for me, the DVDs showed a little too bright which is why I give it 4 stars but overall the show to me would be 5 stars.

907893,A2Y1SCM930PZI7,B0009KQP96,Jabberwocky,"[6, 6]","Ahhh. The infamous Season 5 of Saved by the Bell. This season really shouldn't exist considering normal people are only in high school 4 years. If the seasons had neatly been broken up based on years in high school, nobody would have been confused.The Season 5 episodes contain the ""Tory episodes"" and all of their senior year. The Tory episodes were done after the show had ended and the women who play Jessie and Kelly had already left the show to do other things. NBC wanted more episodes, so they had to find someone new to fill in for the 2 missing actresses. I think that it would have been more logical to continue it with just the remaining cast while finding an appropriate way to explain the absences of Jessie and Kelly rather than just pretending they no longer existed.But, as far as plot is concerned, the episodes with Tory are more interesting. I like Leanna Creel as Tory a lot more than I did when I was younger. It's probably because she reminds me of someone I know in real life. However, you can't fool with the classic lineup of the gang even as you see that Elizabeth Berkley's heart was no longer in it. You can tell because her acting is so much different than in previous seasons. She seems almost airheadish despite always being the studious and serious one.There isn't much continuity in the episodes. Of course, there was never much in the past either.One special treat is an episode on the Season 5 collection that was shot in the third season but not shown until the fifth season: the Snow White and the Seven Dorks episode where they do a rap version of the classic fairytale.

Like the episode right after ""the new girl"" featured Kelly. O_o. Or like one episode is the one where Zack and Lisa kiss and the next episode Zack has a crush on Tori and doesn't know how to tell her....I'm finally on episode 21 and it's ""The best summer ever"" where Zack is off the first day of school and they reminince about the Summer vacation (season 4 I think).

Unfortunately halfway through the episodes Kelly and Jessie disappear without explanation and are 'replaced' by the rather lame character of Tori Scott. The episodes then alternate in their original airing order between 'Tori' episodes and 'Kelly and Jessie' episodes so it doesn't always make a lot of sense to watch them in this order. However, all's well that ends well with Kelly and Jessie miraculously reappearing for graduation. This is the worst DVD in the Saved by the Bell series, largely because of the arrival of Tori and the subsequently poor plotlines that seem to follow her wherevr she goes.
