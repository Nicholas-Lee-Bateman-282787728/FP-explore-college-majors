699951,A58E8BPCCP4NO,B000065U1L,"Nikol Le Vine ""poet17""","[43, 45]","This DVD is set up under the premise that Bert & Ernie, under the direction of Prarie Dawn, put on a play about words. You see both on-stage antics, and the chaos that's backstage. The backstage stuff is reminiscent of the Muppet Show: Grover delivering a singing telegram, people rushing around to get props ready, slipping on banana peels. It's really cute, and my son thinks it's hilarious. During the on-stage scenes, Ernie and Bert introduce different words (cookie, sticky, go, fun, etc.), and then show how new words can be created by switching the letters around. And there's a cool machine that throws pies whenever anyone says the word ""Go"" (of course, Bert gets hit with more than his share of pies). There are some great old-school clips, but mostly new stuff. Lots of songs, and not too much Elmo. I really liked that the focus is on words, not just the letters used. It's a fun, educational video.",5,"Great intro to words, not just letters",1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,911,"['DVD', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'Bert', 'Ernie', 'direction', 'Prarie', 'Dawn', 'put', 'play', 'words', 'see', 'on-stage', 'antics', 'chaos', 'backstage', 'backstage', 'stuff', 'reminiscent', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Grover', 'delivering', 'singing', 'telegram', 'people', 'rushing', 'around', 'get', 'props', 'ready', 'slipping', 'banana', 'peels', 'really', 'cute', 'son', 'hilarious', 'on-stage', 'scenes', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'introduce', 'different', 'words', 'cookie', 'sticky', 'go', 'fun', 'etc', 'then', 'show', 'how', 'new', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'created', 'switching', 'letters', 'cool', 'machine', 'pies', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'word', 'Go', 'course', 'Bert', 'hit', 'more', 'share', 'pies', 'are', 'great', 'old-school', 'clips', 'mostly', 'new', 'stuff', 'Lots', 'songs', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Elmo', 'really', 'liked', 'focus', 'words', 'not', 'just', 'letters', 'used', 'fun', 'educational', 'video']",N/A

There are some good clips - even some with Jim Henson's Kermit and Ernie. But as an educational video, the choice of words they characters played with was pretty random and not at all systematic. (One muppet held a sign ""Coo"" and Elmo had ""kie"" to spell ""cookie,"" but the first muppet kept saying ""Cah,"" not ""Coo."") Don't think your child's reading skills will improve much by watching this video.
