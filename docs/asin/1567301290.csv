184541,A3T69POTR8R107,1567301290,"Arch Llewellyn ""arch-l""","[2, 3]","""Pickpocket"" is considered one of Bresson's best films and it's certainly a concise pr&eacute;cis of his vision. The story concerns the inner transformation of a young, clever man of the poorer classes who decides to prove his superiority by flouting law and convention through a life of petty crime. The deliberately flat, monotone acting shifts the narrative burden almost entirely to the character's face--the shots of his impassive expression as he lifts wallets in a crowd are some of the film's most memorable. The 'dance of hands' as Michel and his accomplices practice their trade is also a visual stand-out.Bresson seems obsessed with filming the unseen & inexplicable aspects of human character; pickpocketing--the tricky attempt to bring something hidden into visibility without disturbing the victim--is a kind of metaphor for his entire approach to film. Although many scenes take place outdoors, much of the action unfolds in the dark, confining, geometric interiors that mirror Michel's inner state. It makes perfect sense that the climax (and only love scene) in the movie takes place with metal bars between the actors.Bresson shows rather than explains: just WHY Michel finally turns around remains as much of a mystery as why he rejected his mother or turned to crime. This makes for a frustrating narrative style that almost perversely defies your effort to figure out exactly what's going on and why. The contrast with Godard's ""Breathless,"" which came out a year later and also concerns a young rebel/criminal, shows the openness that the 60s would bring to the existential gloom of postwar Europe, which Bresson captures here in all its moody glory.",4,Chilly Brilliance,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,1672,"['Pickpocket', 'considered', 'one', 'Bresson', 'best', 'films', 'certainly', 'concise', 'pr', 'eacute', 'cis', 'vision', 'story', 'inner', 'transformation', 'young', 'clever', 'man', 'poorer', 'classes', 'who', 'prove', 'superiority', 'flouting', 'law', 'convention', 'life', 'petty', 'crime', 'deliberately', 'flat', 'monotone', 'acting', 'narrative', 'burden', 'almost', 'entirely', 'character', 'face', 'shots', 'impassive', 'expression', 'wallets', 'crowd', 'are', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', ""'dance"", 'hands', 'Michel', 'accomplices', 'practice', 'trade', 'also', 'visual', 'stand-out.Bresson', 'obsessed', 'filming', 'unseen', 'inexplicable', 'aspects', 'human', 'character', 'pickpocketing', 'tricky', 'attempt', 'bring', 'something', 'hidden', 'visibility', 'disturbing', 'victim', 'kind', 'metaphor', 'entire', 'approach', 'film', 'many', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'outdoors', 'much', 'action', 'dark', 'confining', 'geometric', 'interiors', 'mirror', 'Michel', 'inner', 'state', 'perfect', 'sense', 'climax', 'only', 'love', 'scene', 'movie', 'place', 'metal', 'bars', 'actors.Bresson', 'rather', 'explains', 'just', 'WHY', 'Michel', 'finally', 'around', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'why', 'rejected', 'mother', 'turned', 'crime', 'frustrating', 'narrative', 'style', 'almost', 'perversely', 'defies', 'effort', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'contrast', 'Godard', 'Breathless', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'later', 'also', 'young', 'rebel/criminal', 'openness', '60s', 'would', 'bring', 'existential', 'gloom', 'postwar', 'Europe', 'Bresson', 'here', 'moody', 'glory']",N/A
184542,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,1567301290,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[28, 33]","""Pickpocket"" never grabs us the way a standard movie does. The plot is difficult to extract, and the storyline is never as easy to understand as we might like. Minimalism is at play, although it never overtakes this complex film about a man's search for meaning in the bowels of his own soul.Just as with movies like ""Passion of the Christ,"" or ""Clockwork Orange,"" my appreciation of the movie is not because I felt good throughout, but because throughout the movie, I was able to think about what makes humankind and the shape of redemption.""Pickpocket"" is an art house film, with its long vignette style, with Hitchcock-like shots and film noir-like shadowing.Michel, the main character, develops a desperate fetish for pickpocketing. He learns to be good at the techniques of pickpocketing. He practices wrist watch stealing with the leg of a table as the arm.No one is lonelier than Michel in his fetish. He knows it is wrong and is unable to face his own mother. His eyes are almost always downturned. They are partly looking for the next steal, and partly unable to face the real world.All of Michel's relationships are void of passion and intimacy. The closest relationship is that with a police inspector who knows Michel is a thief but chooses not to prove it. He sees good in Michel and tries to steer him out of the lifestyle.Throughout, Michel is selfish, even when he gives his mother money. That is to appease his guilt, not to lift his mother's finances or encourage her spirits.Michel, unable to escape his fetish, justifies criminals at large by suggesting some, as artisans of their craft, should retain a kind of freedom to steal. However, he never describes the noble benefit, like James Bond's license to kill provides, which in Bond's case is to save the Queen, and, ostensibly, the world. Rather, it is by the merit of being good at his craft that he would thinks should be enough, but the inspector, nor Michel himself, are ever truly convinced.Jeanne, the plainly attractive neighbor who often cares for his mom, is strangely interested in him. They have only a matter-of-fact connection, not sensual or romantic in any way. She represents a meaningful existentiality, living as the lover to Michel's friend Jacques (who she does not really love), and helping her elderly neighbor. Michel's as existential as Jeanne, but without the redeeming selflessness that makes Jeanne more human.Michel dearly wants redemption, and knows his futile lifestyle can only end in despair. He wants more, and when confronted with the likelihood of being arrested, he leaves Paris for several years. When he returns, he learns Jeanne has a child of a long-gone lover.The opportunity for redemption is clear to audience, but is it to Michel? And what would it look like for a man as obsessed with his own desires as he is, since redemption requires us to look outside of ourselves to live a better life?I fully recommend ""Pickpocket.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,Complex Film About A Man's Search For  Significance,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,2984,"['Pickpocket', 'never', 'grabs', 'way', 'standard', 'movie', 'plot', 'difficult', 'extract', 'storyline', 'never', 'easy', 'understand', 'might', 'like', 'Minimalism', 'play', 'never', 'complex', 'film', 'man', 'search', 'meaning', 'bowels', 'own', 'soul.Just', 'movies', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'not', 'felt', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'think', 'what', 'humankind', 'shape', 'redemption', 'Pickpocket', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'long', 'vignette', 'style', 'Hitchcock-like', 'shots', 'film', 'noir-like', 'shadowing.Michel', 'main', 'character', 'desperate', 'fetish', 'pickpocketing', 'be', 'good', 'techniques', 'pickpocketing', 'practices', 'wrist', 'watch', 'stealing', 'leg', 'table', 'arm.No', 'one', 'lonelier', 'Michel', 'fetish', 'wrong', 'unable', 'face', 'own', 'mother', 'eyes', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'downturned', 'are', 'partly', 'looking', 'next', 'steal', 'partly', 'unable', 'face', 'real', 'world.All', 'Michel', 'relationships', 'are', 'void', 'passion', 'intimacy', 'closest', 'relationship', 'police', 'inspector', 'who', 'Michel', 'thief', 'not', 'prove', 'good', 'Michel', 'tries', 'steer', 'lifestyle.Throughout', 'Michel', 'selfish', 'even', 'when', 'mother', 'money', 'appease', 'guilt', 'not', 'lift', 'mother', 'finances', 'encourage', 'spirits.Michel', 'unable', 'escape', 'fetish', 'justifies', 'criminals', 'large', 'suggesting', 'artisans', 'craft', 'should', 'retain', 'kind', 'freedom', 'steal', 'However', 'never', 'noble', 'benefit', 'James', 'Bond', 'license', 'kill', 'Bond', 'case', 'save', 'Queen', 'ostensibly', 'world', 'merit', 'being', 'good', 'craft', 'would', 'thinks', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'inspector', 'Michel', 'are', 'ever', 'truly', 'convinced.Jeanne', 'plainly', 'attractive', 'neighbor', 'who', 'often', 'mom', 'strangely', 'interested', 'have', 'only', 'matter-of-fact', 'connection', 'not', 'sensual', 'romantic', 'way', 'meaningful', 'existentiality', 'living', 'lover', 'Michel', 'friend', 'Jacques', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'love', 'helping', 'elderly', 'neighbor', 'Michel', 'as', 'existential', 'Jeanne', 'redeeming', 'selflessness', 'Jeanne', 'more', 'human.Michel', 'dearly', 'redemption', 'futile', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'despair', 'more', 'when', 'confronted', 'likelihood', 'being', 'arrested', 'Paris', 'several', 'years', 'When', 'Jeanne', 'child', 'long-gone', 'lover.The', 'opportunity', 'redemption', 'clear', 'audience', 'Michel', 'what', 'would', 'look', 'man', 'obsessed', 'own', 'desires', 'redemption', 'look', 'ourselves', 'live', 'better', 'life', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Pickpocket', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

Slipman,"[1, 2]","""Pickpocket"" is director Robert Bresson's simple tale of the unfolding of the emotionally withdrawn existence of a young man, Michel, who has adopted the art of pickpocketing as his bailiwick.  Michel, played by Martin LaSalle, unable to find work resorts to stealing.  While his clumsy initial efforts result in success, he is apprehended and brought in for interrogation.  The paternal police inspector chooses not to detain him but puts him under surveillance.Michel is then recruited by a team of professional pickpockets and is taught the finer details of his trade.  He is so absorbed and obsessed with his illegal craft that he eschews relationships, including any contact with his ailing mother.  A neighbor of his mother, Jeanne, an attractive young girl played by Marika Green has been attending to her.  She is inexplicably attracted to Michel but he fails to recipricate, pushing her off onto his best friend Jacques played by Pierre Leymarie.  Together Jeanne and Jacques are unable to dissuade Michel from pursuing his risky pursuit.Ultimately the fear of apprehension forces Michel to flee Paris.  He returns two years later to find Jeanne the single mother to a young daughter.  Michel wants to offer his support but cannot avoid falling back into pickpocketing.  He gets set up by the police and is eventually nabbed and incarcerated.  While in jail, he finally is able to express his feelings of love that he has for Jeanne and with this, ultimately a chance for redemption.",4,The evolution of a thief,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1492,"['Pickpocket', 'director', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'simple', 'tale', 'unfolding', 'emotionally', 'withdrawn', 'existence', 'young', 'man', 'Michel', 'who', 'adopted', 'art', 'pickpocketing', 'bailiwick', 'Michel', 'played', 'Martin', 'LaSalle', 'unable', 'find', 'work', 'resorts', 'stealing', 'clumsy', 'initial', 'efforts', 'result', 'success', 'apprehended', 'brought', 'interrogation', 'paternal', 'police', 'inspector', 'not', 'detain', 'surveillance.Michel', 'then', 'recruited', 'team', 'professional', 'pickpockets', 'taught', 'finer', 'details', 'trade', 'so', 'absorbed', 'obsessed', 'illegal', 'craft', 'relationships', 'including', 'contact', 'ailing', 'mother', 'neighbor', 'mother', 'Jeanne', 'attractive', 'young', 'girl', 'played', 'Marika', 'Green', 'been', 'attending', 'inexplicably', 'attracted', 'Michel', 'recipricate', 'pushing', 'off', 'best', 'friend', 'Jacques', 'played', 'Pierre', 'Leymarie', 'Together', 'Jeanne', 'Jacques', 'are', 'unable', 'dissuade', 'Michel', 'pursuing', 'risky', 'pursuit.Ultimately', 'fear', 'apprehension', 'forces', 'Michel', 'flee', 'Paris', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'Jeanne', 'single', 'mother', 'young', 'daughter', 'Michel', 'offer', 'support', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'falling', 'back', 'pickpocketing', 'set', 'up', 'police', 'eventually', 'nabbed', 'incarcerated', 'jail', 'finally', 'able', 'express', 'feelings', 'love', 'Jeanne', 'ultimately', 'chance', 'redemption']",N/A
184544,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,1567301290,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","All in all, while the film is good- mainly on the strength of several bravura isolated scenes, it often comes off as something akin to Neo-Realism Lite. There is nothing of the real pathos nor insight that invests some of the classics from Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica, and the Italian classics that were made a decade before this film. Consequently, the film comes off as all head with little heart or soul, and, despite its occasional bravura moments, the film is not particularly deep, and especially so considering it against the titanic achievements of Mouchette and Au Hasard Balthazar. Also, there are numerous little moments that just clunk, starting with the film's titled opening, wherein words scrawl across the screen and tell us of what we are about to witness, that this film is not a thriller but a work of art about the communion of two souls. This overt invocation of Romantic bidungsromans just tanks, in and of itself, and because it utterly destroys the film's end. We know that Michel and Jeanne will end up together, and, worse, the film does not mitigate this solecism by providing a meaningful how the end is reach, even if we know what the end will be.So, Pickpocket is not a great film, much less a masterpiece, in any sense of the term that has relevance, but it is a film that shows potential for plumbing things at a level deeper than even films that are better realized. Unfortunately for it, and its viewers, that potential would only be realized in later Bresson offerings. Of course, there are certainly worse things in life, though.

The outsider who wanders through the busy city and is compelled to commit criminal acts all the while recording these accounts and his thoughts in a diary is reminiscent of his protagonists in Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Light Sleeper.Pickpocket explores the psychology of Michel. Why does he steal? What motivates him to do what he does? Bresson's movie shows the process by which Michel steals from somebody on a busy subway. Part of it is dexterity but it also involves patience, picking the right moment, and, of course, luck plays a role. Initially, Michel's technique is quite rough, almost non-existent. We see it develop over time, tracing the development of an inexperienced thief into a skilled pickpocket who can select his victim and then take their money without them realizing it.Watching Michel and his fellow pickpockets work in tandem on a busy train is a marvel of dexterity and timing as they fleece a mark, pass off their wallet to another accomplice and then move on to another victim in a series of fluid motions. Michel's only chance at any kind of redemption lies with Jeanne who is his only friend, his only tenuous connection with normal society.""Paul Schrader Introduction"" has the veteran screenwriter and filmmaker talking about Pickpocket's influence on his work.

184547,A315K47GRB024C,1567301290,Daniel C. Markel,"[7, 11]","This review is for the 2005 Criterion DVD.The story revolves around a young Frenchman named Michel (Martin LaSalle) who internally battles the moral conflict of becoming a professional pickpocket.  His first attempt is at a racetrack and he successfully takes money from a woman's purse, but minutes later is apprehended by plainclothes policemen.  Since the evidence is only circumstantial, the local police inspector releases him.  While visiting his only friend Jacques in a restaurant, Michel runs into the inspector and the three sit down and discuss their philosophical views on crime.  Michel espouses a very liberal and more likely, an existential view by telling the others that highly skilled criminals should not be arrested and argues that they actually offer something good for society.  Soon afterward, he goes to visit his sick mother but is greeted at the door by a neighbor, a young and attractive woman named Jeanne.  Instead of going inside and seeing his mother, he gives Jeanne some money to give to his mother and leaves.  Michel continues working as a pickpocket and later teams up with a partner.  This sets up the rest of the film for a fascinating display of pickpocketing coupled with conflicted relationships with his mother, Jeanne, Jacques and other significant characters in the film.There are several things that will jump out at you watching this film.  First is the simplicity of it.  None of it was shot in a studio and the clothes of the characters are the same through the film even though it covers weeks of events.  It's clear that the simplicity goes beyond the financial limitations, but rather more as a philosophical statement of minimalism or an indictment against materialism since Michel chooses not to work a normal job for an employer, but rather wishes to live meagerly and independently so that he is free to read inspiring books in a rundown, tiny single room apartment.  It's also intriguing to note that his apartment doesn't have an external lock - only a latch that can locked from the inside.  Also, the dialogue is very sparse. Another thing that becomes strikingly obvious about this movie is the dark, almost miserable demeanor of the characters.  The second time I watched this film, I carefully studied the facial expression of all of the characters including the bystanders and during that entire 75 minutes, I could only see one man smile and this was at the racetrack near the end of the movie!Of course the highlight of this film is the insightful examination of the art of pickpocketing.  Overall the movie does a terrific job showing a whole array of techniques including taking watches off of people's wrists.  The dexterity and precision of these artists is fascinating along with the synergy of these thieves working together.  The cinematography in this film is also outstanding.  Unfortunately, there are two key scenes that are overtly contrived.  One flawed scene is a discussion with the inspector regarding the ""superman"" criminal.  It made no sense for Michel to flaunt the justification of criminal behavior with a policeman.  The other bothersome scene is where Michel goes face-to-face with one of his victims in a near empty train.  The fact that he overtly invades this other man's space for no other reason than to pick his pocket and give the victim such a memorable impression of the perpetrator made no sense at all.The movie is provocative in the sense that it presents hopelessness and despair as the norm and not the exception.  This is one of the early examples, with multitudes to follow, of French films consisting of conflicted characters doomed to misery and suffering.

184548,A280GY5UVUS2QH,1567301290,Doug Anderson,"[9, 11]",All of Bressons films deal with some character who does not fit into society for some reason. His heros are all rebels like Dostoyevsky's hero's(Pickpocket is based on a Dostoyevsky story) and Camus'. They are stories about people who do not fit in and while studying just how and why they don't fit in Bresson also studies society itself.  Some of his movies are just plain bleak but this one has an ending that makes this film unique among this directors work. I think it is rightly singled out as the best though that doesn't mean it's the only one worth seeing. His films are complex and the more of them you see the more his films makes sense. Bresson is a director who does demand his viewers think and he frames his scenes in a way that rebels against cinematic norms in the same way his characters rebel against societal norms but in that style is much substance. If you are only going to see one Bresson film this is the one to see but if you want to see more I would suggest L'Argent after this one. Diary of a Country Priest is excellent but I think best appreciated by those who have already grown familiar with Bresson's style. Each of his films are quite unique and one of my favorites is Lancelot of the Lake which is a most interesting re-telling of that famous legend.,5,The Outsider,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,1285,"['Bressons', 'films', 'deal', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'fit', 'society', 'reason', 'heros', 'are', 'rebels', 'Dostoyevsky', 'hero', 'Pickpocket', 'based', 'Dostoyevsky', 'story', 'Camus', 'are', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'studying', 'just', 'how', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Bresson', 'also', 'studies', 'society', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'bleak', 'one', 'ending', 'film', 'unique', 'directors', 'work', 'think', 'rightly', 'singled', 'out', 'best', ""n't"", 'mean', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'films', 'are', 'complex', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'sense', 'Bresson', 'director', 'who', 'demand', 'viewers', 'think', 'scenes', 'way', 'rebels', 'cinematic', 'norms', 'same', 'way', 'characters', 'rebel', 'societal', 'norms', 'style', 'much', 'substance', 'are', 'only', 'going', 'see', 'one', 'Bresson', 'film', 'one', 'see', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'suggest', ""L'Argent"", 'one', 'Diary', 'Country', 'Priest', 'excellent', 'think', 'best', 'appreciated', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'grown', 'familiar', 'Bresson', 'style', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'unique', 'one', 'favorites', 'Lancelot', 'Lake', 'most', 'interesting', 're-telling', 'famous', 'legend']",N/A

What makes &quot;Pickpocket&quot; such  a rewarding experience is not only the rigour with which the actual  pickpocketing scenes are directed (and, these scenes are gems and belong in  any film studies syllabus as sequences to study academically), but also the  acting.  Martin LaSalle has the cool walk of a Henry Fonda, but he has the  eyes of Alain Delon, and the look of Robert Mitchum, and all wrapped up in  a nice Raskolnikovian package.

No wonder he only produced a handful of films in a lifetime that spans almost an entire century.  He's a meticulous master who carefully and unhurriedly plans each of his movies down to his actor's smallest gesture.""Pickpocket,"" like so many of Bresson's films, is a combination of visual story-telling and narrative overlay.  One hears the story and sees the story in that duplication that is Bresson's signature.  (Sometimes, in fact, there's a tripling effect.)  A young intellectual convinces himself that he wants neither human attachments nor conventional lifestyle.  He is an ubermensch, above the norms of morality and society.  Like Raskolnikov, although without the Russian character's horrible transgression, he begins to live outside the law.  He becomes a pickpocket, eventually throws his hand in with a gang, and is finally caught and thrown into jail where, with the help of a young woman's love, he realizes that he neither has nor wants the stuff to be an ubermensch.  To put it in a biblical phrase that Bresson would probably like, his heart of stone gets replaced with one of flesh.""Pickpocket"" propels the viewer into a kind of denuded landscape in which frills are totally absent.  Bresson always used nonactors--he called them ""models""--to avoid theatrical falsehoods.  He avoided conventional cinematic techniques such as follow-through between scenes.  He coached his models in avoiding facial expressions, voice tones, or mannerisms that would manipulate the emotions or empathy of the audience.  The flatness of ""Pickpocket"" is so effective that the final scene, in which the protagonist's cold aloofness melts, at first seems too abrupt, too artificial.  Whether it works or not is up to the viewer to decide.  But clearly what Bresson is striving for is a sudden whammy effect--a breaking-of-the-ice response on the part of the audience that mirrors the conversion experienced by the protagonist.The Criterion edition of this film is wonderfully remastered, and its supplemental materials are fascinating.  They include interviews with the principle actors 40 years later, a marvelous clip of a pickpocket artist who influenced Bresson's decision to make the film, and most significantly a stunningly brilliant analysis of the film by screenwriter Paul Schrader.  Schrader describes Bresson's film as ""perverse""--but for Schrader, this is a high compliment, because Bresson's cinematic perversion consists in violating the conventionalities of film making.At least 6 stars.",5,Gallic Raskolnikov,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2724,"['taken', 'learn', 'how', 'appreciate', 'Bresson', 'films', 'fault', 'entirely', 'not', 'now', ""'ve"", 'cottoned', 'cinematic', 'way', 'speaking', ""'m"", 'progressively', 'overwhelmed', 'admiration', 'what', 'No', 'wonder', 'only', 'produced', 'handful', 'films', 'lifetime', 'almost', 'entire', 'century', 'meticulous', 'master', 'who', 'carefully', 'unhurriedly', 'movies', 'down', 'actor', 'smallest', 'gesture', 'Pickpocket', 'so', 'many', 'Bresson', 'films', 'combination', 'visual', 'story-telling', 'narrative', 'overlay', 'One', 'story', 'story', 'duplication', 'Bresson', 'signature', 'Sometimes', 'fact', 'tripling', 'effect', 'young', 'intellectual', 'convinces', 'human', 'attachments', 'conventional', 'lifestyle', 'ubermensch', 'norms', 'morality', 'society', 'Raskolnikov', 'Russian', 'character', 'horrible', 'transgression', 'live', 'law', 'pickpocket', 'eventually', 'hand', 'gang', 'finally', 'caught', 'thrown', 'jail', 'where', 'help', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'stuff', 'be', 'ubermensch', 'put', 'biblical', 'phrase', 'Bresson', 'would', 'probably', 'like', 'heart', 'stone', 'replaced', 'one', 'flesh', 'Pickpocket', 'viewer', 'kind', 'denuded', 'landscape', 'frills', 'are', 'totally', 'absent', 'Bresson', 'always', 'used', 'nonactors', 'called', 'models', 'avoid', 'theatrical', 'falsehoods', 'avoided', 'conventional', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'such', 'follow-through', 'scenes', 'coached', 'models', 'avoiding', 'facial', 'expressions', 'voice', 'tones', 'mannerisms', 'would', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'empathy', 'audience', 'flatness', 'Pickpocket', 'so', 'effective', 'final', 'scene', 'protagonist', 'cold', 'aloofness', 'melts', 'first', 'too', 'abrupt', 'too', 'artificial', 'not', 'viewer', 'decide', 'clearly', 'what', 'Bresson', 'striving', 'sudden', 'whammy', 'effect', 'breaking-of-the-ice', 'response', 'part', 'audience', 'conversion', 'experienced', 'protagonist.The', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'remastered', 'supplemental', 'materials', 'are', 'fascinating', 'include', 'interviews', 'principle', 'actors', '40', 'years', 'later', 'marvelous', 'clip', 'pickpocket', 'artist', 'who', 'influenced', 'Bresson', 'decision', 'make', 'film', 'most', 'significantly', 'stunningly', 'brilliant', 'analysis', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'Schrader', 'Bresson', 'film', 'perverse', 'Schrader', 'high', 'compliment', 'Bresson', 'cinematic', 'perversion', 'violating', 'conventionalities', 'film', 'making.At', 'least', '6', 'stars']",N/A
184556,A6ADO7B6FUVN,1567301290,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 5]","Robert Bresson's genius rests in his awareness that actions often reflect on reality, as the action is something that physically affects its surroundings.  By stripping the scenes from emotions and only displaying the actions with complete strangers, the audience gets a sense of genuine presence through the character's actions.  To further the meaning of the action, Bresson displays a minimal amount of reactions to the acts taken by the characters such as facial expression or body language.  It leaves the viewer with the cold atmosphere where the interactions bring out a true sense of what is taking place on the screen with a clear impression without misunderstandings.  Thus, the deeds committed within the film tell the truth without the combination of acting and pointless gibberish of words that often blurs the situation through truths, half-truths, and lies.Interestingly, Bresson opens the film with a shot of a hand writing down the beginning of self-confessional statement, which belongs to the main character.  The initial statement remains enigmatic, as the film lyrically transitions the film into progression where the audience will learn what the main character has to confess.  Through superimposing, the first scene with a pair of gloved rich female hands and a wad of money it allows the viewer to learn the truth of the confession.  The gloved hands transfer the money to suited man who enters a line for on-site racetrack betting.  Throughout the sequence, the hands are fiddling with the cash between the fingers, as the protagonist and antihero Michel's (Martin LaSalle) ogles the wealth switching hands while being within his reach.  Bresson triggers a similar reaction that Pavol's dogs experienced when they salivated to the stimuli of the bell, as the fingers are fondling the money.  It helps the audience to identify with Michel on various levels such as thinking about what the money could help provide.  In this opening the audience learns the hands significance, as hands are what nurtures the protagonist's actions, which will inevitably lead to trouble.At first, it seems that the internal desire is driven by greed, but shortly after Michel's first pick pocketing the emotional high of the possibility of apprehension due to the illegal act seems to be one of the motivating factors.  Michel's voice-over statement strengthens this notion when he states, ""I was walking on air, with the world at my feet.""  Clearly, he senses an emotional high, which also displays emotional arrogance nourished by his recent success.  However, to Michel's dismay, he goes down in flames, as the police arrest him fleeing the scene, but they are forced to release him due to lack of evidence.  In addition, his home seems to support the idea that wealth does not have a significant meaning to him, as he leaves all his doors unlocked for anyone to enter at any time.Some of the motivating forces within Michel appear to be shame, guilt, and paranoia.  These emotions seem to emerge through the Oedipus complex that he possesses in relation to his internal desire to pick pockets.  He knows it is wrong, yet the desire overcomes his awareness of its immorality, which feeds his feelings of guilt, shame, and paranoia.  At the same time, the exhilarating stimuli of succeeding, as he puts it ""I was walking on air, with the world at my feet"" is worth the risk of shame.  These feelings remain throughout the film, but as Michel becomes a student of a master pickpocket he also begins to defeat his feelings with confidence.  Nonetheless, the police remain in a not too far distance to remind him of his illegal activities, which allows for shame, guilt, and paranoia to linger throughout the film.Pickpocket provides a fascinating tale of a man and his vocation, as it allows for the audience to drift into a deeply personal perspective on the motivations that drive a man to do what he does.  With the help of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment Bresson brings out the psychological and moral aspects of the story.

Together with the music and the scene framing the acts of the characters deliver several absorbing ideas in regards to how and why Michel acts in the way he does.

And perhaps, that is reason that he does it. Robert Bresson's Pickpocket is a well crafted, austere, and taut film of a man driven by his self-destructive compulsion. We first encounter Michel (Martin LaSalle) at a Paris racetrack, stealthily fingering through the clasp of a woman's handbag, reaching in, pocketing her money. A wild, almost euphoric gaze comes over his impassive face, heightened by the cheering crowd as the horses approach the finish line. Soon, his compulsion consumes him. His friend, Jacques (Pierre Leymarie) furnishes him with contacts for employment opportunities, but he does not follow through. He abandons his studies, preferring to devote his time perfecting sleight of hand techniques: using a newspaper to disguise his actions, grabbing a victim's wrist, bumping into taxi riders. But he is not as invisible as he thinks, catching the attention, not only of the police inspector (Jean Pelegri), but also a professional thief (Kassagi), who recruits him into his crime syndicate. In a mesmerizing, precisely choreographed train station scene, the band of thieves weave though the ticket counter line and a boarding train: distracting passengers, stealing, passing between accomplices, returning empty wallets to their owners. When his mother's neighbor, Jeanne (Marika Green), is brought into the police station for questioning, Michel, warned by an already suspicious Jacques, flees to London to avoid arrest. Two years later, Michel returns to Paris, to an abandoned Jeanne, and inevitably, to his life of crime.Similar to A Man Escaped, Bresson uses the recurring imagery of hands in Pickpocket: exercising his fingers for dexterity, practicing scenarios for deception, executing the theft. However, in contrast to Fontaine's hands which serve as an instrument of his intellect, Michel's hands represent a moral fracture within his soul. In essence, his compulsion is a subconscious disconnection of his mind from his body, a separation between his ambitious, theoretical ideas, and his common, unremarkable existence. His attraction to a life of crime is a reflection of his psychological fear of failure - his inability to achieve his perceived potential - a suppressed realization that he is not the ""extraordinary man"" that he believes himself to be. In the end, we see a humbled Michel, enheartened by a long-awaited visit from Jeanne. As Jeanne kisses his hands, Michel is redeemed from his past transgressions, with a renewed faith and the love of a devoted woman.",5,Crime & Punishment (& Some Sort of Redemption),1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2646,"['Michel', 'inscrutable', 'young', 'man', 'neatly', 'dressed', 'mild', 'mannered', 'intelligent', 'hardly', 'type', 'whom', 'one', 'would', 'suspect', 'be', 'pickpocket', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'Pickpocket', 'well', 'crafted', 'austere', 'taut', 'film', 'man', 'driven', 'self-destructive', 'compulsion', 'first', 'encounter', 'Michel', 'Martin', 'LaSalle', 'Paris', 'racetrack', 'stealthily', 'fingering', 'clasp', 'woman', 'handbag', 'reaching', 'pocketing', 'money', 'wild', 'almost', 'euphoric', 'gaze', 'impassive', 'face', 'heightened', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'horses', 'approach', 'finish', 'line', 'Soon', 'compulsion', 'friend', 'Jacques', 'Pierre', 'Leymarie', 'contacts', 'employment', 'opportunities', 'not', 'follow', 'studies', 'preferring', 'devote', 'time', 'perfecting', 'sleight', 'hand', 'techniques', 'using', 'newspaper', 'disguise', 'actions', 'grabbing', 'victim', 'wrist', 'bumping', 'taxi', 'riders', 'not', 'as', 'invisible', 'catching', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'police', 'inspector', 'Jean', 'Pelegri', 'also', 'professional', 'thief', 'Kassagi', 'who', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'mesmerizing', 'precisely', 'choreographed', 'train', 'station', 'scene', 'band', 'thieves', 'weave', 'ticket', 'counter', 'line', 'boarding', 'train', 'distracting', 'passengers', 'stealing', 'passing', 'accomplices', 'returning', 'empty', 'wallets', 'owners', 'When', 'mother', 'neighbor', 'Jeanne', 'Marika', 'Green', 'brought', 'police', 'station', 'questioning', 'Michel', 'warned', 'already', 'suspicious', 'Jacques', 'flees', 'London', 'avoid', 'arrest', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Michel', 'Paris', 'abandoned', 'Jeanne', 'inevitably', 'life', 'crime.Similar', 'Man', 'Escaped', 'Bresson', 'recurring', 'imagery', 'hands', 'Pickpocket', 'exercising', 'fingers', 'dexterity', 'practicing', 'scenarios', 'deception', 'executing', 'theft', 'However', 'contrast', 'Fontaine', 'hands', 'serve', 'instrument', 'intellect', 'Michel', 'hands', 'represent', 'moral', 'fracture', 'soul', 'essence', 'compulsion', 'subconscious', 'disconnection', 'mind', 'body', 'separation', 'ambitious', 'theoretical', 'ideas', 'common', 'unremarkable', 'existence', 'attraction', 'life', 'crime', 'reflection', 'psychological', 'fear', 'failure', 'inability', 'achieve', 'perceived', 'potential', 'suppressed', 'realization', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'be', 'end', 'see', 'humbled', 'Michel', 'enheartened', 'long-awaited', 'visit', 'Jeanne', 'Jeanne', 'hands', 'Michel', 'redeemed', 'past', 'transgressions', 'renewed', 'faith', 'love', 'devoted', 'woman']",N/A

[I would argue that Paul Schrader's TAXI-DRIVER is infinitely better that the film he says inspired it.] Bresson's use of non-actors as &#34;mannequins&#34; (or &#34;models&#34;) is certainly unsettling, but it is never really satisfying or successful. [Brecht gave us the Alienation Effect. Bresson just gives us Amateur Acting.]  Watching the leading actor (time after time) walk to his spot, deliberately lower his eyes to the floor, then (after a couple of clearly timed beats) lift his eyes and then (predictably) say his line in an earnest monotone is not only unconvincing, it eventually becomes almost comically distracting. I thought Godard was a self-indulgent film-maker, but Bresson carries self-indulgent monomania to another level.

184562,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1567301290,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 16]","Pickpocket (Robert Bresson, 1959)Robert Bresson's Pickpocket is one of those movies that's always held up as a paragon of filmmaking, one of the greatest explorations of character ever filmed. While I have to say I greatly enjoyed it, I didn't necessarily think it was all that and a bag of chips.Much of this has to do with Martin LaSalle's acting. Let's face it-- LaSalle's not all that great an actor. After making his debut in Pickpocket, he didn't see a silver screen again for eight years, and from then on, spent his time playing supporting roles and walk-ons in B movies (aside from Pickpocket, depending on where in the world you live, LaSalle's best-known film is likely either The Mansion of Madness or Alucarda). He delivers his lines in a sort of high-pitched nervous monotone; normally, this works for the character he's playing, but as he increases in proficiency, one would expect him to get more self-confident. It comes out worst in the movie's final scene, however, where the delivery and the lines are so totally different that it's hard to reconcile the two in my head.Other than LaSalle, however, Pickpocket is the excellent film I keep hearing about. The movie delves into Michel's loneliness in a way that's both existential and voyeuristic, following him from his first hesitant experiments with crime to the point where he's become a master thief, or as close to it as anyone can get in Bresson's bleak world. All the while, Jeanne (Emmannuelle's Marika Green), Michel's mother's nurse, is expressing hesitant interest in pursuing a romantic relationship, while Michel's friend Jacques (Pierre Leymarie, who never appeared in another film) is in turn interested in Jeanne. And while this triangle is unfolding and Michel is learning to be a thief, all the while in the background is the shadow of the Chief Inspector (Jean Pelegri, probably best-known on this side of the pond for Arcady's The Grand Carnival), with whom Michel has an odd relationship that borders on mutual respect combined with loathing. It's this relationship that really made the movie work for me; while Michel laying out his character was fascinating (if delivered in mediocre fashion by LaSalle), the interaction between Michel and the Chief Inspector was something else entirely, and it carries the film more than any other facet.Decent stuff, well worth seeing for film snobs. *** ",3,Good film marred by amateur acting,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2383,"['Pickpocket', 'Robert', 'Bresson', '1959', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'Pickpocket', 'one', 'movies', 'always', 'held', 'up', 'paragon', 'filmmaking', 'one', 'greatest', 'explorations', 'character', 'ever', 'filmed', 'have', 'say', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'was', 'bag', 'chips.Much', 'do', 'Martin', 'LaSalle', 'acting', 'Let', 'face', 'LaSalle', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'making', 'debut', 'Pickpocket', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'silver', 'screen', 'again', 'eight', 'years', 'then', 'spent', 'time', 'playing', 'supporting', 'roles', 'walk-ons', 'B', 'movies', 'aside', 'Pickpocket', 'depending', 'where', 'world', 'live', 'LaSalle', 'best-known', 'film', 'likely', 'Mansion', 'Madness', 'Alucarda', 'lines', 'sort', 'high-pitched', 'nervous', 'monotone', 'normally', 'character', 'playing', 'proficiency', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'get', 'more', 'self-confident', 'out', 'worst', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'however', 'where', 'delivery', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'totally', 'different', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'two', 'head.Other', 'LaSalle', 'however', 'Pickpocket', 'excellent', 'film', 'keep', 'hearing', 'movie', 'Michel', 'loneliness', 'way', 'existential', 'voyeuristic', 'following', 'first', 'hesitant', 'experiments', 'crime', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'master', 'thief', 'as', 'close', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'Bresson', 'bleak', 'world', 'while', 'Jeanne', 'Emmannuelle', 'Marika', 'Green', 'Michel', 'mother', 'nurse', 'expressing', 'hesitant', 'interest', 'pursuing', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Michel', 'friend', 'Jacques', 'Pierre', 'Leymarie', 'who', 'never', 'appeared', 'film', 'turn', 'interested', 'Jeanne', 'triangle', 'unfolding', 'Michel', 'learning', 'be', 'thief', 'while', 'background', 'shadow', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Jean', 'Pelegri', 'probably', 'best-known', 'side', 'pond', 'Arcady', 'Grand', 'Carnival', 'whom', 'Michel', 'odd', 'relationship', 'borders', 'mutual', 'respect', 'combined', 'loathing', 'relationship', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'Michel', 'laying', 'out', 'character', 'was', 'fascinating', 'delivered', 'mediocre', 'fashion', 'LaSalle', 'interaction', 'Michel', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'film', 'more', 'other', 'facet.Decent', 'stuff', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'snobs', '***']",N/A

This is a deceptively simple film but one that tugs on your reasoning's sleeve, it questions and makes statements about law and punishment, love, self interest and individualism, conformity, intimacy, the inner turmoil that exists in all of us. Interesting enough, the ending leaves me wondering does love really conquer all? But that's all always the question left at the end of the day and we hope it does, in fact we need it to, which is why we plunge into it despite our reservation and warnings. The movie doesn't suggest a ""happily ever after"" rather, love is a pause from our selfishness, self destruction isolation and loneness. There is at least hope in love, I cant say that for work, or any other social institution.I wont make remarks about the filmmaker Bresson, even though I have seen several of his films, its just that I don't feel as if I understand his ""methods and mentality"" enough to criticism him.

This stylized film, a 75 minute black and white  crime drama, follows  a Parisian pickpocket named Michel, who develops a compulsion to steal, at which is he largely successful.  It was written and directed by the greatly admired French painter turned film director Robert Bresson, ( A MAN ESCAPED, LS DAMES DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE), and is considered a classic of French cinema.Michel, played by Martin LaSalle,  largely ignores his aging mother, played by Dolly Scal, except to steal from her.  His mother is looked after by a caring neighbor, Jeanne,  played by Marika Green.  The wilful thief ignores the well-meant advice of his friend Jacques, played by Pierre Leymarie.  But Michel enjoys fencing with, and quoting the brilliant Russian novel CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, with L'Inspecteur principal, a chief inspector of Paris police, played by Jean Pelegri, who is on his case.  Michel studies the book PRINCE OF PICKPOCKETS (1930), a biography of the Irish pickpocket George Barrington written by Richard S. Lambert.  Michel  is eventually caught and jailed for his thievery; upon his release, he finds that his mother has died, but Jacques and Jeanne are still where he left them, Jeanne with a toddler.  Critics interpret this to mean he is being offered a chance at a better life.Bresson is considered a leader of the French avant garde school of minimalism, and this film is admired to this day.  It has recently been shown at New York's prestigious temple of modernism, the Museum of Modern Art.  I find its minimalism a bit puzzling.  On the one hand, Bresson's actors here seem to be largely wooden, hardly acting, and Michel  wears the exact same, badly fitting black suit, white shirt, black tie in every scene, even after we have seen him knocked down in a scuffle, with his trousers torn at the knee.  Even after his release from prison, six years after the main action of the movie.  On the other hand, the streets of Paris are always lively, filled with extras accurately dressed in the current styles.  The movie, seems to me, presents a very accurate picture of Parisian street life and social life at the time, particularly the way the young of the great and beautiful city live.I have seen and reviewed, in these pages, the filmmaker's A MAN ESCAPED, and LES DAMES, which I liked, and AU HASARD BALTHAZAR, which I did not.  Your response to PICKPOCKET, I expect, will depend upon your tolerance.

184567,A220FJEQNGMSRN,1567301290,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Looking like a French movie but sounding like Russian literature with all the furniture cataloguing removed, Pickpocket is from the days when Bresson still drew more naturalistic performances from his non-professional casts rather than turning them into stilted and self-conscious mannequins (although Marika Green falls into the latter category, always looking at her feet as if her lines were written on her shoes in classic Bresson automaton mode), and combines the sleek look of a studio policier with a pared down moral debate from Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, with theft replacing murder.Unlike Bresson's more obviously spiritual films (A Man Escaped, Au Hasard Balthazar, Diary of a Country Priest), there's no religious quest here: instead, there's a determinedly atheistic one, with Martin LaSalle's would-be Prince of Pickpockets pursuing an ideal of intellectual elitism as justification for crime against society's morality, failing to realise that he's just another of the thousands of petty egotist in the criminal little leagues. He simply has the ability to articulate his own notions of superiority, completely unaware that he probably works harder at his criminal skills than he would ever do at a proper job.It's also possibly Bresson's most overtly cinematic work despite the underplaying of the dialog scenes. The fluidity of the railway station sequence, with its extraordinary display of tricks of the trade that seem more magic act than crime (the DVD also includes an extract from sleight-of-hand advisor and supporting player Kassogi's cabaret act) and the stylised nature of the sound that always keeps LaSalle at a slight remove from the world around him are much more exhilarating displays of technique than you usually associate with Bresson's more controlled and understated approach in his other films, as even he gets caught up in the LaSalle's addiction to the perfect high that only crime can give him. In that respect, it's the Bresson film you can safely recommend to people who hate Bresson fans without losing points with the faithful.Criterion's DVD is a good one, boasting an excellent transfer of the film on disc one with several interviews - including a virtual interrogation of a faltering Bresson on French TV and a trio of interviews with LaSalle, Green and the articulate and intelligent Pierre Leymarie that are all to often broken up by the interviewer's self-indulgent naval-gazing - as well as TV footage of Kassogi's cabararet act.",5,"Crime and Punishment, Bresson style",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,2490,"['Looking', 'French', 'movie', 'sounding', 'Russian', 'literature', 'furniture', 'cataloguing', 'removed', 'Pickpocket', 'days', 'when', 'Bresson', 'still', 'drew', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'performances', 'non-professional', 'casts', 'rather', 'turning', 'stilted', 'self-conscious', 'mannequins', 'Marika', 'Green', 'latter', 'category', 'always', 'looking', 'feet', 'lines', 'were', 'written', 'shoes', 'classic', 'Bresson', 'automaton', 'mode', 'sleek', 'look', 'studio', 'policier', 'pared', 'down', 'moral', 'debate', 'Dostoevsky', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'theft', 'replacing', 'Bresson', 'more', 'obviously', 'spiritual', 'films', 'Man', 'Escaped', 'Au', 'Hasard', 'Balthazar', 'Diary', 'Country', 'Priest', 'religious', 'quest', 'here', 'instead', 'determinedly', 'atheistic', 'one', 'Martin', 'LaSalle', 'would-be', 'Prince', 'Pickpockets', 'pursuing', 'ideal', 'intellectual', 'elitism', 'justification', 'crime', 'society', 'morality', 'failing', 'realise', 'just', 'thousands', 'petty', 'egotist', 'criminal', 'little', 'leagues', 'simply', 'ability', 'articulate', 'own', 'notions', 'superiority', 'completely', 'unaware', 'probably', 'harder', 'criminal', 'skills', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'proper', 'job.It', 'also', 'possibly', 'Bresson', 'most', 'overtly', 'cinematic', 'work', 'underplaying', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'fluidity', 'railway', 'station', 'sequence', 'extraordinary', 'display', 'tricks', 'trade', 'seem', 'more', 'magic', 'act', 'crime', 'DVD', 'also', 'extract', 'sleight-of-hand', 'advisor', 'supporting', 'player', 'Kassogi', 'cabaret', 'act', 'stylised', 'nature', 'sound', 'always', 'LaSalle', 'slight', 'remove', 'world', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'exhilarating', 'displays', 'technique', 'usually', 'associate', 'Bresson', 'more', 'controlled', 'understated', 'approach', 'other', 'films', 'even', 'caught', 'up', 'LaSalle', 'addiction', 'perfect', 'high', 'only', 'crime', 'can', 'give', 'respect', 'Bresson', 'film', 'can', 'safely', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'Bresson', 'fans', 'losing', 'points', 'faithful.Criterion', 'DVD', 'good', 'one', 'boasting', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'film', 'disc', 'one', 'several', 'interviews', 'including', 'virtual', 'interrogation', 'faltering', 'Bresson', 'French', 'TV', 'trio', 'interviews', 'LaSalle', 'Green', 'articulate', 'intelligent', 'Pierre', 'Leymarie', 'are', 'often', 'broken', 'up', 'interviewer', 'self-indulgent', 'naval-gazing', 'as', 'well', 'TV', 'footage', 'Kassogi', 'cabararet', 'act']",N/A
