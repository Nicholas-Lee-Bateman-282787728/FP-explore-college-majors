It's bitter-sweet to witness a moment of brilliance but never be able to describe it or ever see it duplicated. Actors are on an endless pursuit to understand the meaning of what they speak and to find the right actions for the words. Especially with Shakespeare's works, an actor may spend months with one monologue but after all his effort, still not understand how to speak the words. Even great actors like Ian McKellen have had to disect Shakespeare's text in order to understand what is going on in the scene. He was part of John Barton's ""Playing Shakespeare"" workshop that shows the actor at a very basic level, how to technically approach Shakespeare just by analysing the text. I'm of the opinion Sir McKellen was born great, but his understanding of Shakespeare took time and fortunately for us, the culmination of his years dedicated to mastering the words have been preserved. McKellen embarks on his one-man Shakespeare show by performing several monologues on a bare stage, weaving them together expertly, and peppered with anecdotes about Shakespeare's life. I'm rather fond of Richard III and his performance of the disfigured tyrant was an absolute gift. It's not necessary to have read any of the plays to fully appreciate this performance. McKellen has done the work; all we need to do is listen.",5,"Kings, Villians and Lovers: A Masterful One-Man Show",1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,1483,"['many', 'theater', 'class', ""'ve"", 'often', 'felt', 'saddened', 'when', 'would', 'watch', 'well-delivered', 'monologue', 'scene', 'fellow', 'actors', 'knowing', 'would', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'again', 'bitter-sweet', 'witness', 'moment', 'brilliance', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'describe', 'ever', 'see', 'duplicated', 'Actors', 'are', 'endless', 'pursuit', 'understand', 'meaning', 'what', 'speak', 'find', 'right', 'actions', 'words', 'Especially', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'actor', 'may', 'spend', 'months', 'one', 'monologue', 'effort', 'still', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'speak', 'words', 'Even', 'great', 'actors', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'have', 'had', 'disect', 'Shakespeare', 'text', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'scene', 'was', 'part', 'John', 'Barton', 'Playing', 'Shakespeare', 'workshop', 'actor', 'very', 'basic', 'level', 'how', 'technically', 'approach', 'Shakespeare', 'just', 'analysing', 'text', ""'m"", 'opinion', 'Sir', 'McKellen', 'was', 'born', 'great', 'understanding', 'Shakespeare', 'took', 'time', 'fortunately', 'culmination', 'years', 'dedicated', 'mastering', 'words', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'McKellen', 'one-man', 'Shakespeare', 'show', 'performing', 'several', 'monologues', 'bare', 'stage', 'weaving', 'together', 'expertly', 'peppered', 'anecdotes', 'Shakespeare', 'life', ""'m"", 'rather', 'fond', 'Richard', 'III', 'performance', 'disfigured', 'tyrant', 'was', 'absolute', 'gift', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'read', 'plays', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'McKellen', 'done', 'work', 'need', 'do', 'listen']",N/A

Inevitably, McKellen's ""Acting Shakespeare"" invites comparisons with John Gielgud's ""Ages of Man""; though both are live performances with minimalist staging, they are quite different in approach, each with its distinctive merits. Where Gielgud exudes gravitas, McKellan is more sprightly, taking the audience into his confidence. Not only in length but in depth, Gielgud presents much more verse, much less commentary; McKellen selects fewer readings, adding more personal narrative as connective tissue for the declamatory gems. As the Brits like to say, what you gain on the swings you lose on the roundabouts. If you love the Bard, both are well worth purchasing and enjoying frequently. For younger audiences McKellan's is probably the better bet: he himself was younger when this was produced, and kids will likely get a kick from watching Old Gandalf at his first love. In the process he may woo some of them into loving Shakespeare, too.",5,Jeux d'Esprit,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,1027,"['delightful', 'recital', 'one', 'generation', 'finest', 'Shakespearean', 'interpreters', 'Inevitably', 'McKellen', 'Acting', 'Shakespeare', 'comparisons', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Ages', 'Man', 'are', 'live', 'performances', 'minimalist', 'staging', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'approach', 'distinctive', 'merits', 'Where', 'Gielgud', 'gravitas', 'McKellan', 'more', 'sprightly', 'taking', 'audience', 'confidence', 'Not', 'only', 'length', 'depth', 'Gielgud', 'much', 'more', 'verse', 'much', 'less', 'commentary', 'McKellen', 'fewer', 'readings', 'adding', 'more', 'personal', 'narrative', 'connective', 'tissue', 'declamatory', 'gems', 'Brits', 'say', 'what', 'gain', 'swings', 'lose', 'roundabouts', 'love', 'Bard', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'enjoying', 'frequently', 'younger', 'audiences', 'McKellan', 'probably', 'better', 'bet', 'was', 'younger', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'kids', 'will', 'likely', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'Old', 'Gandalf', 'first', 'love', 'process', 'may', 'woo', 'loving', 'Shakespeare', 'too']",N/A

Ian McKellen begins his excursion into the ""meaning"" of Shakespare by discussing his important interview for entry into Cambridge. How did he do it?  By mouthing a monologue of King Henry V. Clearly, Shakespeare is very ""personal"" for him.  As a Cambridge student, Ian McKellen acted in school plays with some other outstanding classmates devoted to theater -  Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacoby, for example.  Geniuses all.But it is the intimate way in which McKellen presents Shakespeare that makes this one-person-play so memorable. In one moment, Ian McKellen talks seriously about the meaning of a sonnet, then he jokes about overacting a part, then he presents a biographical fact of the Bard, then he recites both the female and the male interchange of lines, then he collapses in a death scene, and so on. It's all so enthralling.So...if all the world's a stage...this is theater personified.",5,"If you ever want to experience a ""One Man Play"" - this is the ""one"" to see",1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,977,"['will', 'change', 'way', 'think', 'Shakespeare', 'Just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'enough', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'excursion', 'meaning', 'Shakespare', 'discussing', 'important', 'interview', 'entry', 'Cambridge', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'mouthing', 'monologue', 'King', 'Henry', 'V.', 'Clearly', 'Shakespeare', 'very', 'personal', 'Cambridge', 'student', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'acted', 'school', 'plays', 'other', 'outstanding', 'classmates', 'devoted', 'theater', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', 'Derek', 'Jacoby', 'example', 'intimate', 'way', 'McKellen', 'presents', 'Shakespeare', 'one-person-play', 'so', 'memorable', 'one', 'moment', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'talks', 'seriously', 'meaning', 'sonnet', 'then', 'overacting', 'part', 'then', 'biographical', 'fact', 'Bard', 'then', 'female', 'male', 'interchange', 'lines', 'then', 'death', 'scene', 'so', 'so', 'enthralling.So', 'world', 'stage', 'theater', 'personified']",N/A

It's as close as I've ever seen anyone come to a definitive production of the play. And, needless to say, I can't recommend it highly enough to any admirer of Shakespeare or Mr. McKellen (or Ms. Dench).As an interesting side-note, Laurence Olivier did a legendary stage 'Macbeth' as well, but his by-all-accounts magnificent performance (listed by countless critics, theatre historians, and fellow actors as one of his very finest) is sadly lost to the ages because Olivier was unable raise the requisite funding to make a once-planned film version of it.
