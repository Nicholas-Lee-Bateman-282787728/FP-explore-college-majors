This is not for those days when I'm ready for extreme sports or competitive exercise. It is an excellent choice when I just want to put in the exercise time and enjoy a little bit of introspection or maybe I'm feeling sorry for myself because I haven't had a chance to spend anytime outside recently. It even works when I have things to think about and don't want to go walking outside deep in thought and run into something.If you want more action, just add your own music and power through it. It works. It helps to get me past the 'blah' mood where I really just don't want to push myself very hard today. I usually end up being motivated to do much more than I had planned. If I'm already motivated and ready for a all-out workout, I'll choose another DVD that kicks it up a notch and pushes me further than this one. It's all about the day, and the mood, and my goal for that day. The scenery is beautiful, worth the time spent enjoying it. I like to just drink it in, letting my exercise time fly by.",5,Pleasant Way To Enjoy Nature And Get Fit Without Leaving Home!,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,1304,"['great', 'choice', 'nature', 'lovers', 'lower-key', 'option', 'great', 'days', 'when', 'wish', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'out', 'somewhere', 'get', 'close', 'nature', 'walk', 'around', 'get', 'exercise', 'weather', ""n't"", 'right', ""n't"", 'anyplace', 'safe', 'handy', 'nearby', 'maybe', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'not', 'days', 'when', ""'m"", 'ready', 'extreme', 'sports', 'competitive', 'exercise', 'excellent', 'choice', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'put', 'exercise', 'time', 'enjoy', 'little', 'bit', 'introspection', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'sorry', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'spend', 'anytime', 'outside', 'recently', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'things', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'walking', 'outside', 'deep', 'thought', 'run', 'something.If', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'just', 'add', 'own', 'music', 'power', 'get', ""'blah"", 'mood', 'where', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'very', 'hard', 'today', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'motivated', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'planned', ""'m"", 'already', 'motivated', 'ready', 'all-out', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'choose', 'DVD', 'up', 'notch', 'pushes', 'further', 'one', 'day', 'mood', 'goal', 'day', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'time', 'spent', 'enjoying', 'like', 'just', 'drink', 'letting', 'exercise', 'time', 'fly']","Scenic Trex Rainforest DVD - Virtual Walking, Cycling, Treadmill Workout"
1198220,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B001GMX9Q8,Calamity Jane,"[1, 2]","CONS...The forest blurs and clears constantly as you ""hike"". It had a dizzying effect on me as I walked my treadmill. Either I got used to it as I walked or the problem cleared up. I didn't notice it after the first few minutes.Too many times the path abruptly stopped and started up somewhere else. It brought me back to reality every time, something I didn't want or need on my fantasy walk.There are odd sound effects not prevalent in nature. Maybe it's the camera equipment. Whatever it is, it's annoying and distracting. Like me, you'll probably miss the satisfying crunch of leaves beneath a hiker's feet.PROS... The pace was perfect for a slow walk on the treadmill. On occasion, when I wanted to walk faster, I hit the forward button on my remote. The scene sped up nicely to accommodate my faster trot, but I lost the nature sounds as a trade off.The camera constantly takes you in an out of the deep jungle, from shade into sunlight and then back into shade. It's a nice variety.This DVD has no musical background. That's certainly a plus for me.On my very first hike, I easily quadrupled my walk without even realizing I had done it. This DVD definitely takes your mind off of exercising.The morning warm up and the waterfall cool down are a waste of space. Both a merely nothing more than a stand-still view of the mountains and a waterfall.",4,Both Good and Bad,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1353,"['CONS', 'forest', 'blurs', 'constantly', 'hike', 'had', 'dizzying', 'effect', 'walked', 'treadmill', 'got', 'used', 'walked', 'problem', 'cleared', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.Too', 'many', 'times', 'path', 'abruptly', 'stopped', 'started', 'up', 'somewhere', 'else', 'brought', 'back', 'reality', 'time', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'need', 'fantasy', 'are', 'odd', 'sound', 'effects', 'not', 'prevalent', 'nature', 'camera', 'equipment', 'annoying', 'distracting', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'miss', 'satisfying', 'crunch', 'leaves', 'hiker', 'feet.PROS', 'pace', 'was', 'perfect', 'slow', 'walk', 'treadmill', 'occasion', 'when', 'wanted', 'walk', 'faster', 'hit', 'forward', 'button', 'remote', 'scene', 'sped', 'up', 'nicely', 'accommodate', 'faster', 'trot', 'lost', 'nature', 'trade', 'off.The', 'camera', 'constantly', 'out', 'deep', 'jungle', 'shade', 'sunlight', 'then', 'back', 'shade', 'nice', 'variety.This', 'DVD', 'musical', 'background', 'certainly', 'plus', 'me.On', 'very', 'first', 'hike', 'easily', 'quadrupled', 'walk', 'even', 'realizing', 'had', 'done', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'mind', 'exercising.The', 'morning', 'warm', 'up', 'waterfall', 'cool', 'down', 'are', 'waste', 'space', 'merely', 'nothing', 'more', 'stand-still', 'view', 'mountains', 'waterfall']","Scenic Trex Rainforest DVD - Virtual Walking, Cycling, Treadmill Workout"

Filmed in the WEST INDIES im somewhere high in the hills there. And finding myself treking along a very rough, rugged, and narrow track. Surrounded by the most Dense Foliage that i have ever seen. Im all alone here, its just ME and NATURE. Way in the wildness. I have certainly been spirted away to a compleatly different kind of world. There are some sounds, i hear the birds, and the branches of the trees make a sound of their own, i can hear the wind too. Im REALLY walking along this track. IM THERE, and its thrilling. When it rains it does get rather wet and muddy,, BUT I CAN JUMP PUDDLES. Sometimes i run out of track, suddenly there is no path there anymore. I wonder how i can get through all this Dense Bush that is dead ahead of me. BUT I DO, and i come out the otherside too. And then im back on track again, continueing on with my amazeing journey. Knowing i am somewhere, where very few other people have ever ventured. An Isolated and Peaceful WALK.

1198223,AUN6OJ31CQ0JV,B001GMX9Q8,M. Meissner,"[1, 3]","Not bad. I purchased this to use while walking on a treadmill. It isn't too bad, but there are others out there that I would recommend more. This video meanders along a lush jungle trail. The audio soundtrack is a little distracting. A musical score might have been nicer, so my solution is to turn down the audio and crank up some Jimi Hendrix on a CD player. Much better. Recommended for people trying to put some time on a treadmill and are just bored silly looking at a wall. We put a 32"" LCD TV on a shelf in front of the treadmill, with an inexpensive DVD player. Also on the shelf is a CD player and a selection of classic rock. It's a nice setup and is much nicer than watching the clock or staring at the wall. I'd like to see similar DVDs of travel destinations perhaps; walking around a small Italian village, countryside hikes in Scotland..... running a New York marathon..... something creative. I have found other DVDs of hikes in National Parks. These are all worthwhile diversions to keep you engaged and moving.",3,Exercise DVD,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,1028,"['Not', 'bad', 'purchased', 'use', 'walking', 'treadmill', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'are', 'others', 'there', 'would', 'recommend', 'more', 'video', 'meanders', 'lush', 'jungle', 'trail', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'little', 'distracting', 'musical', 'score', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', 'solution', 'turn', 'down', 'audio', 'crank', 'up', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'CD', 'player', 'Much', 'better', 'Recommended', 'people', 'trying', 'put', 'time', 'treadmill', 'are', 'just', 'bored', 'silly', 'looking', 'wall', 'put', '32', 'LCD', 'TV', 'shelf', 'front', 'treadmill', 'inexpensive', 'DVD', 'player', 'Also', 'shelf', 'CD', 'player', 'selection', 'classic', 'rock', 'nice', 'setup', 'much', 'nicer', 'watching', 'clock', 'staring', 'wall', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'similar', 'DVDs', 'travel', 'destinations', 'perhaps', 'walking', 'small', 'Italian', 'village', 'countryside', 'hikes', 'Scotland', 'running', 'New', 'York', 'marathon', '..', 'something', 'creative', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'DVDs', 'hikes', 'National', 'Parks', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'diversions', 'keep', 'engaged', 'moving']","Scenic Trex Rainforest DVD - Virtual Walking, Cycling, Treadmill Workout"
