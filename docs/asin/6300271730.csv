But something is missing and there seems to be a false and sappy ending with Carolyn and Neal looking happy and entwined as they say farewell to Jack.  When the film was shown on a movie cable channel years ago (20?), I recall additional later segments with scenes of Neal and the Merry Pranksters and one scene in particular where Carolyn arrives home from work as a costume designer and finds Neal and his ""hippie"" friends partying and wrecking her house.  I can still see her (Sissy Spacek) sitting on a stool alone in her kitchen angry and thinking, trying to compose herself. She finally self-actualizes, gets up, and  firmly tells them all to leave. She separates from Neal for good.",3,Has Film Been Shortened For This DVD?,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,745,"['bought', 'DVD', 'remembered', 'movie', 'fondly', 'something', 'missing', 'there', 'be', 'false', 'sappy', 'ending', 'Carolyn', 'Neal', 'looking', 'happy', 'entwined', 'say', 'farewell', 'Jack', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'movie', 'cable', 'channel', 'years', 'ago', '20', 'recall', 'additional', 'later', 'segments', 'scenes', 'Neal', 'Merry', 'Pranksters', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Carolyn', 'home', 'work', 'costume', 'designer', 'Neal', 'hippie', 'friends', 'partying', 'wrecking', 'house', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'sitting', 'stool', 'alone', 'kitchen', 'angry', 'thinking', 'trying', 'compose', 'finally', 'self-actualizes', 'up', 'firmly', 'tells', 'leave', 'Neal', 'good']",N/A

I read ""On the Road"" in college but it didn't leave a lasting imprataur on me.  Ditto for Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" which I couldn't get through.  I did read Tom Wolfe's account of the Merry Pranksters, ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" as well as Lenny Bruce's bio and enjoyed them thoroughly.  I didn't approach ""Heart Beat"" with high expectations and they were more than transcended.  Director John Byrum's film has it's own jazzy rhythms that make it unique and unto itself.  We see Jack Kerouac(John Heard) and the Cassadys (Nick Nolte and Sissy Spacek) not as leaders of a movement but rugged individualists who defy the norm and go to the beat of their own muses.  The film is immeasurably helped by a powerhouse performance by Nolte as Neal Cassady, a real charmer who may be a ne'er-do-well or a rebel.  Heard and Spacek are good in more subdued turns as the friend and spouse who at times are repelled then embrace Neal's antics.  The late Ray Sharkey gives a great turn as an Allen Ginsburg type as does John Larroquette as a conservative TV host.  Terrific period detail from art designer Jack Fisk, Spacek's real-life husband, and gorgeous score from Jack Nietzche.  I remember this film received lukewarm critical and commercial success at the time of it's release but it is definitely a film ahead of it's time.",5,Nolte Shines In Beat Drama,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1385,"['wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'be', 'expert', 'Beat', 'movement', 'read', 'Road', 'college', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'imprataur', 'Ditto', 'Burroughs', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'did', 'read', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'account', 'Merry', 'Pranksters', 'Electric', 'Kool-Aid', 'Acid', 'Test', 'as', 'well', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'bio', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'did', ""n't"", 'approach', 'Heart', 'Beat', 'high', 'expectations', 'were', 'more', 'transcended', 'Director', 'John', 'Byrum', 'film', 'own', 'jazzy', 'rhythms', 'make', 'unique', 'unto', 'see', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'John', 'Heard', 'Cassadys', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'not', 'leaders', 'movement', 'rugged', 'individualists', 'who', 'defy', 'norm', 'go', 'beat', 'own', 'muses', 'film', 'immeasurably', 'helped', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Nolte', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'real', 'charmer', 'who', 'may', 'be', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'rebel', 'Heard', 'Spacek', 'are', 'good', 'more', 'subdued', 'friend', 'spouse', 'who', 'times', 'are', 'repelled', 'then', 'embrace', 'Neal', 'antics', 'late', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'great', 'turn', 'Allen', 'Ginsburg', 'type', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'conservative', 'TV', 'host', 'Terrific', 'period', 'detail', 'art', 'designer', 'Jack', 'Fisk', 'Spacek', 'real-life', 'husband', 'gorgeous', 'score', 'Jack', 'Nietzche', 'remember', 'film', 'received', 'lukewarm', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'time', 'release', 'definitely', 'film', 'ahead', 'time']",N/A

The quality of all five classic movies has been terrible. DVD's skip, soundtrack volumes yoyo and all the scenes, even those which were originally brightly lit are so dark that viewers can't distinguish which actors are on camera, what the locations are, or whether shots were taken in bright sunlight or dimly-lit rooms. As other reviewers have commented, ""Heart Beat"" isn't the most factual account of the beat generation's driving forces but it's an enjoyable movie nonetheless and it deserves better presentation than this.

238435,A2X25C107CSLOR,6300271730,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[31, 42]","If there is a great movie to be made about Jack Kerouac, and Neal and Carolyn Cassidy, this aint it. &quot;Suggested&quot; by Carolyn's memoirs,  writer/director John Byrum's film degenerates into yet another adulterous  husband saga. The idea that Carolyn has is that Neal is the muse for  Kerouac's writing but since Jack knew Neal and had written On The Road  before they met her, Carolyn's insight appears to be limited to the time  Neal married her and they lived miserably in suburbia until Jack joined  them for a menage a trois. Byrum's stabs at the stifling conservatism of  America in the 50's is represented by neighbours of the Cassidy's who come  for dinners. Their embarassment over Neal's deliberate rudeness is funnier  than their apparent shock at the later threesome. The film proposes that it  was Allen Ginsberg's notoriety which propelled publishers who had  previously rejected his novel, to suddenly change their mind. The fact that  Ginsberg is named Ira here (played by Ray Sharkey, giving the best  performance of the cast) and that none of On The Road is heard seems to  suggest that Byrum seems to be avoiding copyright problems. The film begins  well and Laszlo Kovacs' yellow tint lighting gives it a dated look which is  very appealing. An image of Neal sitting in a cafe recalls Edward Hopper.  As Carolyn, Sissy Spacek is given a romantic entrance supported by a lovely  Jack Nitzsche theme, and it's great to see her with a Veronica Lake hairdo  and glamourised. But as soon as Jack and the Cassidy's separate, the energy  drops and we get stuck in suburbia, while Jack toils the soil in Mexico,  waiting. The notion that Neal has stolen Carolyn away from Jack seems  unmotivated since we've hardly seen them together, but clearly this is  needed to explain Jack's re-appearance. And the later scenes of Jack handly  his fame badly seem surprising considering what a best seller the book is  said to be. The interviews we see show hostile hosts. Where was Steve  Allen, who was a mad On the Road fan? It is interesting to see how Carolyn  believes that the Beat generation, with the berets and beards, is thought  of as a bastardisation of Kerouac's ideology based on Neal's freedom, since  Neal never presented such artifice. As Neal, Nick Nolte suggests a restless  spirit though hardly a bisexual one, as is implied. We don't believe him  when he keeps telling us how much he loves Spacek. She narrates and spars  well though ultimately she remains an enigma. Perhaps the reason Byrum has  used the word &quot;suggested&quot; and not adapted from the memoirs means  that information which may have made her more interesting has been lost.  John Heard makes Jack dull and ineffectual, and when he does show some  life, Heard uses the yelling he would continue with in Cutter's Way before  experience provided him with more subtlety. Carolyn tells us that Neal's  weakness was his lack of committment and Jack's was his longing for it. At  one point Neal tells Jack to get his own life to write about, and one  questions whether a writer could complete a book as long as On the Road  appears to be if there is nothing of himself in it. Since I haven't read  the work, I cannot comment, but the Jack this film portrays sure doesn't  make me want to.",2,angina,967507200,"08 29, 2000",2000,3283,"['great', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Neal', 'Carolyn', 'Cassidy', 'aint', 'quot', 'Suggested', 'quot', 'Carolyn', 'memoirs', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Byrum', 'film', 'yet', 'adulterous', 'husband', 'saga', 'idea', 'Carolyn', 'Neal', 'muse', 'Kerouac', 'writing', 'Jack', 'knew', 'Neal', 'had', 'written', 'Road', 'met', 'Carolyn', 'insight', 'be', 'limited', 'time', 'Neal', 'married', 'lived', 'miserably', 'suburbia', 'Jack', 'joined', 'menage', 'trois', 'Byrum', 'stabs', 'stifling', 'conservatism', 'America', '50', 'represented', 'neighbours', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'come', 'dinners', 'embarassment', 'Neal', 'deliberate', 'rudeness', 'funnier', 'apparent', 'shock', 'later', 'threesome', 'film', 'was', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'notoriety', 'propelled', 'publishers', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'rejected', 'novel', 'suddenly', 'change', 'mind', 'fact', 'Ginsberg', 'named', 'Ira', 'here', 'played', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'giving', 'best', 'performance', 'cast', 'none', 'Road', 'heard', 'suggest', 'Byrum', 'be', 'avoiding', 'copyright', 'problems', 'film', 'well', 'Laszlo', 'Kovacs', 'yellow', 'tint', 'lighting', 'dated', 'look', 'very', 'appealing', 'image', 'Neal', 'sitting', 'cafe', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'Carolyn', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'given', 'romantic', 'entrance', 'supported', 'lovely', 'Jack', 'Nitzsche', 'theme', 'great', 'see', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'hairdo', 'glamourised', 'as', 'soon', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'separate', 'energy', 'drops', 'get', 'stuck', 'suburbia', 'Jack', 'soil', 'Mexico', 'waiting', 'notion', 'Neal', 'stolen', 'Carolyn', 'away', 'Jack', 'unmotivated', ""'ve"", 'hardly', 'seen', 'together', 'clearly', 'needed', 'explain', 'Jack', 're-appearance', 'later', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'handly', 'fame', 'badly', 'seem', 'surprising', 'considering', 'what', 'best', 'seller', 'book', 'said', 'be', 'interviews', 'see', 'show', 'hostile', 'hosts', 'Where', 'was', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'who', 'was', 'mad', 'Road', 'fan', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Carolyn', 'Beat', 'generation', 'berets', 'beards', 'thought', 'bastardisation', 'Kerouac', 'ideology', 'based', 'Neal', 'freedom', 'Neal', 'never', 'presented', 'such', 'artifice', 'Neal', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'restless', 'spirit', 'hardly', 'bisexual', 'one', 'implied', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'Spacek', 'well', 'ultimately', 'enigma', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'Byrum', 'used', 'word', 'quot', 'suggested', 'quot', 'not', 'adapted', 'memoirs', 'information', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'been', 'lost', 'John', 'Heard', 'Jack', 'dull', 'ineffectual', 'when', 'show', 'life', 'Heard', 'yelling', 'would', 'continue', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'experience', 'provided', 'more', 'subtlety', 'Carolyn', 'Neal', 'weakness', 'was', 'lack', 'committment', 'Jack', 'was', 'longing', 'one', 'point', 'Neal', 'Jack', 'get', 'own', 'life', 'write', 'one', 'questions', 'writer', 'could', 'complete', 'book', 'as', 'long', 'Road', 'be', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Jack', 'film', 'sure', ""n't"", 'make', 'want']",N/A
