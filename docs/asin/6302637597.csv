323896,A82LIVYSX6WZ9,6302637597,Michael Bolts,"[5, 9]","James Spader (Tv's Boston Legal and The Practice, Stargate) stars as a lawyer running for congress. His father just died, he's divorced and he's being beat by his opponent in the campaign race. Spader has a steamy fling with Vietnamese chick Charlotte Lewis and he doesnt know that her blackmailing father videotaped them doing the deed but she comes to his house and so Spader with the girl go try to get the tapes back but Spader ends up getting knocked out and when he wakes up the girl is gone and the only thing is the dead father with a knife by his side. So, he scrams it fleeing the scene of the crime and the next thing you know the girl is put on trial and he takes the case. Spader keeps this to a 2 star rating with his performance. The supporting cast dont add up to their potential. The result is a mystery drama with little life and breath. You can see the end coming a mile away...well I did anyway. Also starring Jason Robards (Enemy Of The State, Magnolia), Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Jeff Perry (Tv's Nash Bridges), Piper Laurie and Michael Parks (From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill 1 and 2).",2,Spader keeps this at bay....a mystery with little life....,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,1103,"['James', 'Spader', 'Tv', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Practice', 'Stargate', 'lawyer', 'running', 'congress', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'divorced', 'being', 'beat', 'opponent', 'campaign', 'race', 'Spader', 'steamy', 'fling', 'Vietnamese', 'chick', 'Charlotte', 'Lewis', 'know', 'blackmailing', 'father', 'videotaped', 'doing', 'deed', 'house', 'so', 'Spader', 'girl', 'go', 'try', 'get', 'tapes', 'back', 'Spader', 'up', 'getting', 'knocked', 'out', 'when', 'up', 'girl', 'gone', 'only', 'thing', 'dead', 'father', 'knife', 'side', 'So', 'fleeing', 'scene', 'crime', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'girl', 'put', 'trial', 'case', 'Spader', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'dont', 'add', 'potential', 'result', 'mystery', 'drama', 'little', 'life', 'breath', 'can', 'see', 'end', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'well', 'did', 'anyway', 'Also', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Enemy', 'State', 'Magnolia', 'Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'Jeff', 'Perry', 'Tv', 'Nash', 'Bridges', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'Kill', 'Bill', '1', '2']",Storyville VHS

His opponent, far ahead in the polls, nonetheless arranges an erotic encounter (in an abandoned aikido studio!) to get our hero's adulterous moves on video. Yawn. Everything--lines, camera angles, plot points--proceeds in the most predictable and utterly uninteresting fashion. Who gives a damn about this dissipated and rather fatuous pretty boy? Frost and Spader fail to bring any life to this yarn. Even Robards, a real pro, is off his game.

While at the same time looks into the suicide of his father years earlier. Has a dalliance with a vietnamese prostitute which is taped by her father, The prostitute ( Charlette Lewis ) arrives apparently beaten by her father tells Spader ( Cray Fowler ) that her father has secretly taped them. Spader seeks confrontation with father,they fight and father is killed. this is when discrepancies seem to mount up,first of all the father dies seemingly by a slit throat by a knife that Spader never brandishes during the fight. murder weapon left at scene of crime,which Spader takes possession of which is rather stupid considering he's a former lawyer. Trial follows with daughter as main suspect even through theirs no forensic evidence to link her to the crime just her running from the building.Implausible courtroom shootout as well as reactions by everyone involved. Your left with not knowing who actually killed the father.Why Spader is so stupid,and why is their no relationship building with any of the female cast.The movie is portrayed in the deep south Louisiana where you would think intamacy would be no problem.And the movie doesn't even get interesting until 40 minutes into the film. In short the movie tries to make up for its lack of substance with style,which it fails to do, you""ll barely entertained, Spaders done better this is just an average film.",3,"storyville , just average",1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,1452,"['James', 'spader', 'former', 'lawyer', 'running', 'political', 'office', 'same', 'time', 'suicide', 'father', 'years', 'earlier', 'dalliance', 'vietnamese', 'prostitute', 'taped', 'father', 'prostitute', 'Charlette', 'Lewis', 'apparently', 'beaten', 'father', 'tells', 'Spader', 'Cray', 'Fowler', 'father', 'secretly', 'taped', 'Spader', 'confrontation', 'father', 'fight', 'father', 'killed', 'when', 'discrepancies', 'seem', 'mount', 'up', 'first', 'father', 'seemingly', 'slit', 'throat', 'knife', 'Spader', 'never', 'fight', 'murder', 'weapon', 'left', 'scene', 'crime', 'Spader', 'possession', 'rather', 'stupid', 'considering', 'former', 'lawyer', 'Trial', 'daughter', 'main', 'suspect', 'even', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'link', 'crime', 'just', 'running', 'building.Implausible', 'courtroom', 'shootout', 'as', 'well', 'reactions', 'everyone', 'involved', 'left', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'actually', 'killed', 'father.Why', 'Spader', 'so', 'stupid', 'why', 'relationship', 'building', 'female', 'cast.The', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'deep', 'south', 'Louisiana', 'where', 'would', 'think', 'intamacy', 'would', 'be', 'problem.And', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'interesting', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'short', 'movie', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'substance', 'style', 'do', 'barely', 'entertained', 'Spaders', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'average', 'film']",Storyville VHS
