Momentairly, I believe he is one of the most promising new writers/directors of the last decade.  I hate how his movies are underrated.  May was a good 5 stars and I'm rating The Woods the same.  Not only the plot line was inticing to the end but the filming itself was chilling and dark.  This is a very peculiar movie, something simular to the craft but deeper.  It's something fresh to watch considering Halloween is coming up, and the mainstream can't think of anything original.

The trouble begins almost as soon as Heather's parents have driven away. This is no ordinary girl's academy. The instructors, led by Ms. Traverse (Patricia Clarkson), are all solemn, stiff types, w/ no ability to smile. The students are captives in this cold, regimented prison. Heather is lost in this place, seeing the whole ordeal as cruel and unusual punishment. Weird things start happening, like students disappearing, dying, etc. Heather slowly finds out that evil is in complete control here.

We have a girl, who sets fires, and her parents dropping her off, where they don't even notice that all along the hallways and rooms there are vines growing out of control. I understand being one with nature, but it was a little too Grimm fairytale for my liking. There are of course, mean girls there, and timid shy girls, there is a mystery surrounding how the school was founded and what happens to girls that go there. Witches, Woods and aptitude tests don't make a good plotline. Especially when none of it is fleshed out enough in the back story, or in the present characters and situation. I didn't really get how it was supposed to be creepy, or cutting edge, or even an old fashioned girl's school ghost story. Curses and leaves was basically all I got.

It is not that Bruckner is bad so much as flat. Placed in a ""Mona Lisa Smile"" get up and under some bad lighting she is asked is skulk around the set and act detached. And she does, but with a script that is devoid of life, emotion, and credibility her performance doesn't have a prayer. Here she plays Heather, a girl with lame parental figures whose idea of a good idea is dropping her off in the middle of the woods to go to school. It gets her out of the house so her parents have no interest in doing any research into the hellhole they are leaving her in. From there the film takes off down a path of self-seriousness and well worn tricks straight towards their straight to video destiny.Since most people think isolation, abandonment, and uniformity are all kind of scary McKee throws them all in and hopes that they strike a chord. They don't. Heather, being the protagonist, is treated as an outsider and subjected to the torture of the bully Samantha, here played by Rachel Nichols. In a subplot that reeks of repressed lesbianism, Samantha spends her time obsessing over Heather's hair, and I don't mean the kind found on her head. The entire atmosphere is ripe with repression so I hardly blame these kids. I do feel bad, however, that the only form of release they get is when they are rolling around on table tops in a fit of fury beating the snot out of each other. Soon the horror aspect arrives in the shape of fog that comes from the woods and turns the students into leaves. It also turns out that the evil headmaster (Patricia Clarkson) is in cahoots with the fog and is working to cover up these. . .uh. . .murders? Yes, it all comes off as stupid as it sounds. The fog, like all great movie villains is omnipresent, which means that talking about the fog leads to a lynching.The climax, which arrives pretty much unannounced, splatters itself all over the screen. It's gruesome and gross, but the special effects are cheap and laughable, so unless you plan on viewing this as a B movie I suggest you pass. The film is watchable, it's just not good, and most of the appeal is lost under a sea of faux style. Bruckner should be staying away from these horror movies as she has no more luck, quality wise, in the woods of the Midwest (or Montreal if we want to go off of where it was filmed) than she did in the voodoo swamps of New Orleans. This is a setback for McKee who looked so promising after ""May."" That film at least had one character that he was interested in developing, and May herself made for a much better monster than this bland fog. All monsters have a taste for young female blood, just while they are chasing it I would hope that they would provide more entertainment value than the sight of a low riding cloud entering school grounds.  **1/4",2,May-be We Should Pretend This Never Existed,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,3017,"['Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'doubt', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'Woods', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'follow', 'up', 'May', 'nasty', 'little', 'creature', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'not', 'Bruckner', 'bad', 'so', 'much', 'flat', 'Placed', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'get', 'bad', 'lighting', 'asked', 'skulk', 'set', 'act', 'detached', 'script', 'devoid', 'life', 'emotion', 'credibility', 'performance', ""n't"", 'have', 'prayer', 'Here', 'Heather', 'girl', 'lame', 'parental', 'figures', 'idea', 'good', 'idea', 'dropping', 'off', 'middle', 'woods', 'go', 'school', 'house', 'parents', 'have', 'interest', 'doing', 'research', 'hellhole', 'are', 'leaving', 'film', 'off', 'down', 'path', 'self-seriousness', 'well', 'worn', 'tricks', 'straight', 'towards', 'straight', 'video', 'destiny.Since', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'isolation', 'abandonment', 'uniformity', 'are', 'kind', 'scary', 'McKee', 'hopes', 'strike', 'chord', 'do', ""n't"", 'Heather', 'being', 'protagonist', 'treated', 'outsider', 'subjected', 'torture', 'bully', 'Samantha', 'here', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'subplot', 'reeks', 'repressed', 'lesbianism', 'Samantha', 'time', 'obsessing', 'Heather', 'hair', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'kind', 'found', 'head', 'entire', 'atmosphere', 'ripe', 'repression', 'so', 'hardly', 'blame', 'kids', 'do', 'feel', 'bad', 'however', 'only', 'form', 'release', 'get', 'when', 'are', 'rolling', 'around', 'table', 'tops', 'fit', 'fury', 'beating', 'snot', 'other', 'Soon', 'horror', 'aspect', 'shape', 'fog', 'woods', 'students', 'leaves', 'also', 'out', 'evil', 'headmaster', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'cahoots', 'fog', 'working', 'cover', 'up', '.uh', '.murders', 'Yes', 'off', 'as', 'stupid', 'fog', 'great', 'movie', 'villains', 'omnipresent', 'talking', 'fog', 'lynching.The', 'climax', 'pretty', 'much', 'unannounced', 'splatters', 'screen', 'gruesome', 'gross', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'cheap', 'laughable', 'so', 'plan', 'viewing', 'B', 'movie', 'suggest', 'pass', 'film', 'watchable', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'most', 'appeal', 'lost', 'sea', 'faux', 'style', 'Bruckner', 'should', 'be', 'staying', 'away', 'horror', 'movies', 'more', 'luck', 'quality', 'wise', 'woods', 'Midwest', 'Montreal', 'want', 'go', 'off', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'did', 'voodoo', 'swamps', 'New', 'Orleans', 'setback', 'McKee', 'who', 'looked', 'so', 'promising', 'May', 'film', 'least', 'had', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'interested', 'developing', 'May', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'monster', 'bland', 'fog', 'monsters', 'have', 'taste', 'young', 'female', 'blood', 'just', 'are', 'chasing', 'would', 'hope', 'would', 'provide', 'more', 'entertainment', 'value', 'sight', 'low', 'riding', 'cloud', 'entering', 'school', 'grounds', '**1/4']",N/A
1009237,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000H5TH0W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","There's just something about horror and boarding schools for girls.  With the exception of Eastland (that's a Facts of Life reference), I can't think of any school for girls that isn't terrorized by a murderer or haunted by ghosts or witches.  This boarding school is no exception, as there are all kinds of weird things going on behind its doors - not to mention out in the surrounding woods.  Set in 1965, The Woods has a nice, distinctive feel to it, and the creepy potential the film shows early on lasts all the way to the somewhat ridiculous climactic scenes near the end.  The only real weakness here is the story, as the atmosphere remains dark and creepy throughout, and an excellent cast rises to every occasion, no matter how many horror movie clich&eacute;s dot the landscape.Heather Fasulo (Agnes Bruckner) finds herself at this secluded school largely because she is an embarrassment to her uncaring mother.  Yes, there was the small matter of a little arson, but it doesn't take a Freud to figure out that Heather was acting out for the kind of attention her mother refused to give her.  Heather isn't exactly happy in her new situation.  She befriends a demure girl by the name of Marcy (Lauren Birkell), but she is immediately targeted for abuse by Samantha (Rachel Nichols), the leader of the cool girl school clique, who gives her the much-used moniker of Fire-Crotch.  Heather also has a bad habit of getting into trouble, which does not endear her to her teachers.  Still, Miss Traverse (Patricia Clarkson), the headmistress, shows a special interest in her, even giving her a scholarship based on Heather's performance on a strange, IQ-like test.  Being special isn't necessarily a good thing at this school, though; special girls have an odd habit of disappearing.With the sinisterly sweet Ms. Traverse hovering over the school, stony-faced teachers ready to unload on you in a heartbeat, and one teacher with a completely unexplained facial tic wandering around, it's not hard to tell that this is a weird place.  The fact that everyone on the staff is an alumnus of the school is also a telling fact.  Everything starts falling into place once we hear the sinister legend of the school.  Supposedly, three witches came out of the woods one day long ago and eventually took over the school (going Lizzie Borden all over the headmistress - nice); now, there's supposedly all these girls out in the woods who will do really nasty things to you if you wander into their territory.  Heather, for her part, begins having all of these nightmarish visions that seem to confirm much of the story - as does her first attempt to run away through the dark and isolated woods.  It looks like she might actually survive the whole the whole ordeal when her father (Bruce Campbell) comes to get her - but just when it looks like she is out, The Woods pull her back in!I realize that all of this sounds pretty good, and it is.  You've got your hot, red headed school girl, a bevy of creepy teachers, one bona fide catfight, the tangy smell of witchcraft in the air, a dark and mysterious forest, and Bruce frickin' Campbell all in the mix.  Unfortunately, the big payoff is a disappointment.  There's some nice axe-tion in there but the climax comes off as more than a little bit silly.  I don't like to drive in the fog, but the spectre of a creeping fog really doesn't scare me, and that's only part of the problem.Still, May director Lucky McKee merits a lot of praise where The Woods is concerned.  The film certainly didn't deserve to sit on the shelf for month after month following its completion in 2003.  McKee put everything in place for something special, but the story just comes up a little short in the end.  I thought Patricia Clarkson was absolutely mesmerizing as Ms. Traverse, and Agnes Bruckner is a rising star of not-to-be-missed quality.

""Daniel""","[1, 2]","I liked a lotMay, the former movie written and directed by Lucky McKee in 2002 so I waited with much expectation for THE WOODS based on an original screenplay by David Ross. And I feel a little disappointed now after having seen it last night.I don't particularly like horror movies about witches, I think that everything has already been said and shown about them and, furthermore, directors are more interested in showing the effects of their spells than trying to understand why these creatures have been invented by our collective unconscious. The best and definitive movie about witches is without any doubt Roman Polanski'sRosemary's Babybecause the Polish born director described them as ordinary human beings and, by doing so, managed to create in our hearts a feeling of uneasiness and anxiety much more effective than all what could imagine a special effects specialist.Well, back to THE WOODS and its school for girls directed by a trio of witches.

But to my surprise this film had another good thing going for it, director Lucky McKee. For those who do not know who he is, he is the writer/director of another wonderful film ""MAY"". So I knew before even viewing this film that it would be a great film, little did I know that it would turn out to be a classic.The story follows Heather Fasulo [Agnes Bruckner] has she is dropped off at an all girl's boarding school by her parents [Bruce & Emma Campbell]. It seems Heather is a problem child and is in need of some good education. Upon arriving at the school she takes a test that determines how gifted she is., it turns out that she is one of the brightest at the school and requires special classes. But after arriving she befriends one girl and is constantly fighting with another, but it doesn't take long for her to notice something is wrong. Not only is head mistress Ms. Traverse [Patricia Clarkson] and her staff out of this world creepy, but Heather's class mates keep disappearing into the woods. And only after a trip in the woods herself does she hear the story of what happened long ago at the school. Apparently it seems long ago three girls came from out of the woods looking for a place to stay. The school let them stay and put the girls in classes, but after some of the students found the girls practicing witchcraft the girls were tormented. Unable to take it any more the girls called to the woods for help, and offered the woods all of the student's souls for revenge. After all was said and done the students were under the witches control and they murdered the head mistress. Heather has learned of a horrible secret and wants to find out what is happening to the students before the woods take her as well.Director Lucky McKee did an excellent job with this film; he definitely is a filmmaker to look out for in the future. Also writer David Ross has created an excellent story for all to enjoy, which apparently based on the ending is based on true events [the ending at least]. DP John R. Leonetti did an amazing job as well on this film; the cinematography in this film was great. As far as on screen talent went star Agnes Brucker was outstanding as Heater, plus it doesn't hurt that the girl is beautiful. She portrayed her character with an eloquent grace that is sorely missed in Hollywood these days; this girl should become a huge star soon. And on the opposite end we have the creepy head mistress played excellently by Patricia Clarkson. Bruce Campbell is great as always, as is Emma Campbell, in fact the entire cast did an excellent job.I recommend this film highly to any & everybody out there, I also recommend that you buy this film and skip renting it, yea it is that good.",5,GREAT MOVIE,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2837,"['WOODSI', 'have', 'admit', 'only', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'was', 'film', 'surprise', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'writer/director', 'wonderful', 'film', 'MAY', 'knew', 'even', 'viewing', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'classic.The', 'story', 'Heather', 'Fasulo', '[', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', ']', 'dropped', 'off', 'girl', 'boarding', 'school', 'parents', '[', 'Bruce', 'Emma', 'Campbell', ']', 'Heather', 'problem', 'child', 'need', 'good', 'education', 'arriving', 'school', 'test', 'how', 'gifted', 'out', 'one', 'brightest', 'school', 'special', 'classes', 'arriving', 'one', 'girl', 'constantly', 'fighting', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'notice', 'something', 'wrong', 'Not', 'only', 'head', 'mistress', 'Ms.', 'Traverse', '[', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', ']', 'staff', 'world', 'creepy', 'Heather', 'class', 'keep', 'disappearing', 'woods', 'only', 'trip', 'woods', 'herself', 'hear', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'school', 'Apparently', 'long', 'ago', 'three', 'girls', 'came', 'woods', 'looking', 'place', 'stay', 'school', 'let', 'stay', 'put', 'girls', 'classes', 'students', 'found', 'girls', 'practicing', 'witchcraft', 'girls', 'were', 'tormented', 'Unable', 'take', 'more', 'girls', 'called', 'woods', 'help', 'offered', 'woods', 'student', 'souls', 'revenge', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'students', 'were', 'witches', 'control', 'murdered', 'head', 'mistress', 'Heather', 'learned', 'horrible', 'secret', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'students', 'woods', 'take', 'well.Director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'definitely', 'filmmaker', 'look', 'out', 'future', 'Also', 'writer', 'David', 'Ross', 'created', 'excellent', 'story', 'enjoy', 'apparently', 'based', 'ending', 'based', 'true', 'events', '[', 'ending', 'least', ']', 'DP', 'John', 'R.', 'Leonetti', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'cinematography', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'As', 'far', 'screen', 'talent', 'went', 'star', 'Agnes', 'Brucker', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Heater', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'portrayed', 'character', 'eloquent', 'grace', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'girl', 'should', 'become', 'huge', 'star', 'soon', 'opposite', 'end', 'have', 'creepy', 'head', 'mistress', 'played', 'excellently', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'great', 'always', 'Emma', 'Campbell', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'excellent', 'job.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'everybody', 'there', 'also', 'recommend', 'buy', 'film', 'skip', 'renting', 'yea', 'good']",N/A

Crap like the endless sequels of Friday the 13th, Final Destination, etc., may make a quick buck but they do nothing to enhance the genre.The producers of this film took a different direction than those who churn out such blood and guts schlock.  They built a suspenseful atmosphere with shadows and unusual camera angles, bizarre characters and modest special effects.Within this framework they placed a troubled girl who finds herself trapped in a girl's school with a dark past and deadly secrets.  At stake is not so much her life as her soul.The main problem with the film is that they apparently forgot that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  The subtly menacing feel they create stays unbroken through the story, to the point where it becomes monotonous.The movie would have been much better if the sense of menace had been broken up with a few happy, perhaps even humorous, scenes.  Not only would this have given it some interesting variety, it would have made the inevitable return to the creepy moments much more chilling.Nevertheless, it is a good effort overall, and fans of better horror and suspense films like Session 9 and 1963's The Haunting should find it worth their time.

Usually, a film like this would bore me. In theis case, the solid acting is what captivated my interest in the film, as almost everyone was dead on with their delivery. Agnes Bruckner carried the weight of this thriller with hardly an effort and she was developed to be likeable enough. She didn't seem dumb when it came to dealing with the horrors around her and she also proved particularly thick skinned, especially during a conflict with the resident bully. Lauren Birkell also offered a similarly likeable performance, although she was not such a strong willed character. Her purpose in the film seemed a tad bit sinister. Bruce Campbell was just a regular schmo at first until the movie approached the climax and then pieces of the cult favorite Campbell became evident. The scene steeler of course came in the form of Patricia Clarkson as she simply chewed the role up and spit it out. I was a little bummed that she was not in the movie more and her characters final moment in the movie seemed to happen too fast. The rest of the acting was decent... although the girl who played the bully was not very convincing when in bad girl mode but came through when she became freakishly concerned for Heather (Bruckner).The story was good. Heather gets dropped off at a private school after setting a tree to flame in her yard. Her mother seems overtly eager to get rid of her while her father is completely reluctant but obviously whipped into agreement by his demanding wife. Heather senses a little oddness at first but manages to settle in after befriending an odd girl named Marci. Of course, the good doesn't stay good and her time spent at the school starts to get a little eerie. There are the woods bordering the champus... and the entire faculty seems to be a little off in the way they mingle with each other and domineer over the students. When a girl who failed an attempt at suicide disappears, that is when the terror starts to reveal itself. Of course, it isn't as scary as the hype built it up to be, but there is still plenty of creepy goodness to be had.My only real complaint about this movie is its completly abrupt ending. The build up to a bitter violent show down is imminent but in the end it ends way to fast and before you know it, the credits are rolling.

In scenes that lift heavily from other, better films, she finds herself an outcast from the other students.  However, she keeps having disturbing dreams and can't shake the feeling that something sinister is at work in this quiet school, especially after one of her classmates disappears.The premise of The Woods, while not inspired or original, could easily have been worked into a credible horror film.  There are any number of things that could have been done with the set-up and made for at least a competent movie-going experience.  Instead the filmmakers trot out...evil trees. Between The Happening, The Ruins, and The Woods the last 5 years have given us three movies that all fail due to a central flaw: trees are fundamentally not scary.  The best horror films are the ones which tap into a primal fear: Halloween taps into the ubiquitous cultural concept of the boogeyman, The Descent plays off claustrophobia, etc.  But trees?  They're really, really not scary.  Now, ""the woods"" is a scary concept, especially at night.  Every crack of a twig could be a monster, a murderer, a creature out for blood.  Being alone in the woods is scary because behind every tree something might be lurking.  The Blair Witch Project, for all its faults, tapped into this fear well.  But the woods are not scary because of trees, and that's something this movie just absolutely fails to understand.All things considered, there's really no reason to see this movie.  Bruce Campbell is in it, seemingly in a nod to his Evil Dead role (a film that had the good sense to see the humor in things like malevolent flora) but even ardent fans of the cult hero will be disappointed by his minuscule role.  Despite being set at a girl's school, the exploitative elements are non-existent so the raincoat crowd will have nothing to look for.  The acting is weak (including a decidedly bored Patricia Clarkson) and there are no standout sequences.

1009250,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000H5TH0W,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 6]","Lucky McKee made his film debut with a movie he wrote and directed called ""May."" The movie, in my opinion, showed some interesting new talent in the horror genre. When he followed up ""May"" with ""The Woods"" (a film he didn't write), the movie was kept from beging released for some time. Now that it's finally on DVD, I was curious to check it out and I'm surprised to find that it's not that bad. It's not better than ""May"" but it has it's good moments. Agnes Bruckner plays Heather Fasulo, a troubled girl who's parents (Emma Campbell & Bruce Campbell) have had enough of her. So they send her to the prestigious Falburn Academy, a school that is secluded deep within the woods. Once there, Heather realizes that there's something wrong with the school and the forest that borders it. Children go up missing, she's hearing voices coming from the woods (the voice is voiced by Angela Bettis, who played the title character in ""May"")...She also gets taunted by her fellow students (I was getting annoyed when they called her ""fire-crotch"" for about the 100th time). Oscar Nominee Patricia Clarkson (Best Supporting Actress, 'Pieces of April') stars as Ms. Traverse, the headmistress, who knows a lot more about the strange events circling the school than she pretends too. The movie isn't a blood and gore fest (although, it has its share of blood and gore) and it's not really scary. But it's a lot better than crap like""Beyond the Wall of Sleep"" and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" and ""Alien Vs. Predator"" and ""Resident Evil."" The special effects in the movie are decent, the acting is good, there's no pathetic attempts at comic relief. Not everyone will like this movie, and it's not perfect, but it's a movie that continues to show a lot of promise for director McKee.GRADE: B",4,Above Average Horror Film,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1768,"['Lucky', 'McKee', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'movie', 'wrote', 'directed', 'called', 'May', 'movie', 'opinion', 'showed', 'interesting', 'new', 'talent', 'horror', 'genre', 'When', 'followed', 'up', 'May', 'Woods', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'movie', 'was', 'kept', 'beging', 'released', 'time', 'Now', 'finally', 'DVD', 'was', 'curious', 'check', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'find', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'better', 'May', 'good', 'moments', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'Heather', 'Fasulo', 'troubled', 'girl', 'who', 'parents', 'Emma', 'Campbell', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'send', 'prestigious', 'Falburn', 'Academy', 'school', 'secluded', 'deep', 'woods', 'Once', 'there', 'Heather', 'something', 'wrong', 'school', 'forest', 'Children', 'go', 'up', 'missing', 'hearing', 'voices', 'coming', 'woods', 'voice', 'voiced', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'character', 'May', 'also', 'taunted', 'fellow', 'students', 'was', 'getting', 'annoyed', 'when', 'called', 'fire-crotch', '100th', 'time', 'Oscar', 'Nominee', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', ""'Pieces"", 'April', 'stars', 'Ms.', 'Traverse', 'headmistress', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'strange', 'events', 'circling', 'school', 'too', 'movie', ""n't"", 'blood', 'gore', 'fest', 'share', 'blood', 'gore', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'lot', 'better', 'crap', 'Wall', 'Sleep', 'Freddy', 'Vs.', 'Jason', 'Alien', 'Vs', 'Predator', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'decent', 'acting', 'good', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'comic', 'relief', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'show', 'lot', 'promise', 'director', 'McKee.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

Combining these two elements, this movie should have been a no-brainer. Most modern horror movies lack the sense of tension of the movies of the 80's and before. For example, ""Halloween"" is pretty tame in the gore department but the atmosphere, camera work and music combine to give the viewer the feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" throughout. I can't think of one modern horror movie; aside from ""High Tension"", that creates that same sense of dread.Well, you can toss ""The Woods"" into the ""Nice Try"" pile with the likes of other modern pseudo-horror like ""Hostel"". The premise is moderately similar to ""Suspiria"" in that both movies include witches and a school surrounded by woods but there is where the similarities end abruptly. The set pieces themselves are moderately good to a point but the way this film is lit, it is hardly intimidating at all. It reminds me of Hogwarts. Sadly, the girls in this school are able to scare the viewer in the same way Harry Potter might, which is to say that if you are 6 years old and Harry Potter movies cause you to leap from your seat, ""The Woods"" might be up your alley if you are seeking a good scare.With that said, the plot or story really unimportant. Basically, the school is run by witches and the woods surrounding the school are haunted by three witches from the 1800's. This might be somewhat effective if the witches in the school were a little creepier than the ones we are given but again, the intimidation factor is on par here with that of some cheesy Halloween made-for-TV movie on ABC Family Channel. The death knell for me (aside from the snail's pace  at which this movie plods along) was the main antagonist -- the woods themselves. The trees come to life and claim victims inside the school, specifically the one that sleeps in the bed at the end near the window. Game over.Nope, not even Bruce Campbell could save this movie from being an overhyped letdown. In addition, Lucky McKee's entry in the Masters Of Horror series ""Sick Girl"" was also only moderately interesting in premise only. The actual episode was hampered by poor acting by the lead actress and a complete lack of horror sensibility. So, if you truly must see ""The Woods"", give it a rental first and then decide if a purchase is absolutely necessary.

1009260,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000H5TH0W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","The Woods (Lucky McKee, 2006)Lucky McKee's long-awaited second feature, The Woods, basically opened nowhere and faded into obscurity in about three hours on its initial release. Most of us had to wait for the DVD. And while The Woods isn't as outright fantastic is May, McKee's wonderful first movie, it's certainly got enough chops to be watchable; for the vast stable of underrated and talented directors in Hollywood, this would be good enough to rank with the director's best work.McKee keeps the comedy-horror mix from May here, though the comedy is not nearly as pervasive as it was there. Heather Fasulo (Blood and Chocolate beauty Agnes Bruckner) is dropped off at a secluded and exclusive girls' school by her parents (Bruce and Emma Campbell, who despite the last names are seemingly no relation to one another). The school is presided over by the imperious, and somewhat ominous, Ms. Traverse (The Station Agent's Patricia Clarkson) and a stable of teachers, all of whom are scary, scary individuals, and all of whom graduated from that very school. The students aren't all that much more promising, ranging from shy outcast Marcy (Paparazzi's Lauren Birkell), who quickly becomes Heather's first friend, to haughty, imperious Samantha (Rachel Nichols, of the wonderful, but short-lived, TV series The Inside), the most popular girl in the school, and the one who, of course, quickly becomes Heather's arch-nemesis.Stereotypical, you say, but McKee has some tricks up his sleeve. The secluded girls' school has been a B-list horror novel mainstay for decades, and McKee's going to play all the stereotypes for you. Admittedly, this is a tricky move, because it assumes an audience well-read enough in crappy eighties horror novels that never sold anywhere but drugstore bookshelf racks to recognize that he's playing this for subtle jabs instead of seriousness, but it does work; even those who find one character's sudden change of heart halfway through the movie to ring false, with some reflection, will see how subtly McKee set everything up.Like May, this is a fun little movie, a great way to kill ninety minutes. It's not deathless cinema, but it does sport some of Hollywood's more unconventionally beautiful actresses, a witty, understated script, and of course McKee's knack for directing a meaty thriller. About the only thing missing is the gratuitous nude scene I was starting to think was written into lovely, lovely Patricia Clarkson's contract. And I do have to admit, the movie is the worse for not including it. But you have to give the woman points for taking chances now and again. *** ",4,FINALLY!

But I still found this movie absorbing and worthwhile. All the good is in the acting and in the atmospherics.Agnes Bruckner is daunting as the rebellious teen. She projects the kind of sullen resentment that you feel could tip over at any moment into vengeful hatred. She has an equally well-cast nemesis playing the smug blonde bully at the school. Among the cold, stern teachers and administrators employed there, the teacher with the neck tic leaves the most indelible impression. That tic is a malicious hangman's twist that seems to be delivered by some invisible haunting hand that reaches down to her at unpredictable moments.But the ultimately ominous performance is turned in by Patricia Clarkson as headmistress. She shows how frightening a persistently quiet monotone can be. It's proof of how a human's intense calm control can be so much scarier than any rampaging monster.This isn't a slasher movie where girls at a boarding school get whacked one-by-one.

1009263,AU9ND05L99YSG,B000H5TH0W,TheHorrorMovieCritic,"[3, 3]","There are two types of people who will be drawn to this movie...fans of Bruce Campbell and fans of ""up and coming"" horror director, Lucky McKee. Let me be frank, do not purchase this just to see B-movie legend Bruce Campbell. He has a minor role and to focus on him would take away from the other merits of the film. Lucky McKee has crafted a chilling horror movie and it's certainly worth tracking down.Agnes Bruckner plays the role of fiery red head Heather Fasulo, a troubled youth sent away to an all girl school. Falburn  Academy is a place where young girls blossom into fine ladies. Of course there is some sinister stuff going on, and making heads or tails of it all is part of the fun. Soon after our girl Heather gets settled in she starts having some f'ed up nightmares and girls begin to go missing. The all female teaching staff is delightfully creepy, but the poignantly calm headmistress, Miss Traverse (Patricia Clarkson), steals the show. Everybody in this movie is carrying some sort of secret and McKee lets his yarn unravel at a snail's pace.There are some genuinely frightening moments but the brooding atmosphere McKee creates is top notch. His relentless use of ethereal and demonic whispering really makes your skin crawl. Needless to say I was effectively creeped out once some of the madness starts. After the mystery has been revealed in full, the movie really picks up steam. Bruce Campbell's role expands towards the final act and fans of his certainly won't be disappointed with his performance. The ending leaves no stone unearthed and the plot is wrapped up nicely, which is always nice. Heather's tale is an interesting one and being patient to witness the conclusion is rather rewarding.In the end, The Woods is an effective and certainly overlooked horror movie. To be honest, it's pretty rare to see such great acting in the genre and I was impressed with what the cast did here. My only real complaint is that the plot could have moved along quicker. Lucky McKee is a more than capable director and his knack for disconcerting imagery is impressive. If you're in the mood for a scary movie that is intelligent and doesn't rely on cheap scare tactics, then check out The Woods.Final Grade: B-",3,A Creepy Horror Film Mixed with a Dash of Red Head,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2228,"['are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'movie', 'fans', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fans', 'coming', 'horror', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'Let', 'be', 'frank', 'do', 'not', 'purchase', 'just', 'see', 'B-movie', 'legend', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'minor', 'role', 'focus', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'other', 'merits', 'film', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'crafted', 'chilling', 'horror', 'movie', 'certainly', 'worth', 'tracking', 'down.Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'role', 'fiery', 'red', 'head', 'Heather', 'Fasulo', 'troubled', 'youth', 'sent', 'away', 'girl', 'school', 'Falburn', 'Academy', 'place', 'where', 'young', 'girls', 'blossom', 'fine', 'ladies', 'course', 'sinister', 'stuff', 'going', 'making', 'heads', 'tails', 'part', 'fun', 'Soon', 'girl', 'Heather', 'settled', 'having', ""f'ed"", 'up', 'nightmares', 'girls', 'begin', 'go', 'missing', 'female', 'teaching', 'staff', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'poignantly', 'calm', 'headmistress', 'Miss', 'Traverse', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'show', 'Everybody', 'movie', 'carrying', 'sort', 'secret', 'McKee', 'yarn', 'unravel', 'snail', 'pace.There', 'are', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'moments', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'McKee', 'top', 'notch', 'relentless', 'use', 'ethereal', 'demonic', 'whispering', 'really', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'effectively', 'creeped', 'out', 'once', 'madness', 'mystery', 'been', 'revealed', 'full', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'steam', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'role', 'final', 'act', 'fans', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'ending', 'stone', 'unearthed', 'plot', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'always', 'nice', 'Heather', 'tale', 'interesting', 'one', 'being', 'patient', 'witness', 'conclusion', 'rather', 'rewarding.In', 'end', 'Woods', 'effective', 'certainly', 'overlooked', 'horror', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'pretty', 'rare', 'see', 'such', 'great', 'acting', 'genre', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'cast', 'did', 'here', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'moved', 'along', 'quicker', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'more', 'capable', 'director', 'knack', 'disconcerting', 'imagery', 'impressive', ""'re"", 'mood', 'scary', 'movie', 'intelligent', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cheap', 'scare', 'tactics', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Woods.Final', 'Grade', 'B-']",N/A

1009266,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000H5TH0W,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Lucky McKee's ""The Woods"" starts with a young, troubled girl Heather (recently setting a fire on forest) sent to an isolated all-girl boarding school run by mysterious Ms. Traverse. While Heather befriends a shy girl Marcy, she remains aloof to the girls and the teachers of the school. Heather's lonely life does not get more comfortable when she starts to see things and listen to the voices in the woods. Moreover, she hears of old legends a bout the place (the film is set in New England, 1965). And one of the girls goes suddenly missing, and another....If you're looking for chills and scares in ""The Woods,"" you will be disappointed. The film can be hardly called scary, but the stylish images of the school and its surrounding woods contribute to setting up the spooky atmosphere, which is the greatest merit of the film. The film's Dario Argento-like premise of is nothing new, but effective acting (from Agnes Bruckner as Heather and Patricia Clarkson as Ms. Traverse, in particular) is certainly another merit. Bruce Campbell, cast against type, is also very good as Heather's neglected father. And Lesley Gore songs have never sounded creepier before.Still ""The Woods"" is, I am afraid, one of the examples of ""Could have been better"" with different approach. The quiet, slow-moving film suddenly changes the pace in the last 15 minutes, which goes too fast with incredible incidents and coincidences even by the standard of any genre films. Actually the atmospheric first part is not total success as so many things are thrown in and we are not sometimes sure which thread of the story to follow in the repetitious storytelling. Some intriguing factors are not fully explored - for example, true intentions of the bullying girl Samantha (Rachel Nichols), which is the most intriguing character in the film or the background history of the school's principal.I had been long looking forward to seeing Lucky McKee's second feature film as I was impressed with his debut ""May"" with its strong acting and convincing character. Creepy ""The Woods"" still proves Lucky McKee's talent as director, but a bit steadier pace of storytelling would have made the film better.",3,"Lucky McKee's Much-Anticipated Film Is Very Atmospheric, Maybe Too Atmospheric ...",1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,2173,"['Lucky', 'McKee', 'Woods', 'young', 'troubled', 'girl', 'Heather', 'recently', 'setting', 'fire', 'forest', 'sent', 'isolated', 'all-girl', 'boarding', 'school', 'run', 'mysterious', 'Ms.', 'Traverse', 'Heather', 'shy', 'girl', 'Marcy', 'aloof', 'girls', 'teachers', 'school', 'Heather', 'lonely', 'life', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'comfortable', 'when', 'see', 'things', 'listen', 'voices', 'woods', 'Moreover', 'old', 'place', 'film', 'set', 'New', 'England', '1965', 'one', 'girls', 'suddenly', 'missing', '.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'chills', 'scares', 'Woods', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'hardly', 'called', 'scary', 'stylish', 'images', 'school', 'surrounding', 'woods', 'contribute', 'setting', 'up', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'greatest', 'merit', 'film', 'film', 'Dario', 'Argento-like', 'premise', 'nothing', 'new', 'effective', 'acting', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'Heather', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Ms.', 'Traverse', 'particular', 'certainly', 'merit', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'cast', 'type', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Heather', 'neglected', 'father', 'Lesley', 'Gore', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'sounded', 'creepier', 'before.Still', 'Woods', 'am', 'afraid', 'one', 'examples', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'different', 'approach', 'quiet', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'suddenly', 'pace', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'fast', 'incredible', 'incidents', 'coincidences', 'even', 'standard', 'genre', 'films', 'Actually', 'atmospheric', 'first', 'part', 'not', 'total', 'success', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'are', 'not', 'sometimes', 'sure', 'thread', 'story', 'follow', 'repetitious', 'storytelling', 'intriguing', 'factors', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'example', 'true', 'intentions', 'bullying', 'girl', 'Samantha', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'most', 'intriguing', 'character', 'film', 'background', 'history', 'school', 'principal.I', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'debut', 'May', 'strong', 'acting', 'convincing', 'character', 'Creepy', 'Woods', 'still', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'talent', 'director', 'bit', 'steadier', 'pace', 'storytelling', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'better']",N/A
1009267,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000H5TH0W,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I'm a great fan of atmospheric horror movies, especially supernatural thrillers and was quite excited when I came across this movie. Well, after watching it, my verdict is that it's certainly atmospheric, and has credible actors in the cast, especially Emma Campbell and Patricia Clarkson, but the script is underwhelming, and the plot pacing is a bit too slow.The story is set in the 1960s in New England. Alice Fasulo [Emma Campbell] is a teenage girl who is also prone to starting fires, and is thus banished by her irate mother and a reluctant father [Bruce Campbell] to a boarding school in a remote part of New England, surrounded by woods, and run by a sinister headmistress, Ms Traverse [Patricia Clarkson]. Alice is given a placement test and is deemed special and worthy of a scholarship. The feisty teen rebels at being abandoned by her parents, and chafes at boarding school life, having to deal with a peer who calls her 'firecrotch' [Kathleen Mackey], but does make a good friend, Marcy Turner [Lauren Birkell]. Alice senses that all is not well at the school though, especially when she experiences strange and vivid dreams and hears strange voices, and eventually comes to believe that Ms Traverse and her female faculty may be up to no good. When girls start disappearing at night with only a pile of leaves in their beds the next morning, Alice begins to fear that she may be the next chosen victim.As I said, both Emma Campbell and Patricia Clarkson portray their roles credibly. It is easy to empathize with Emma despite her rebellious manner, and Clarkson plays her role to sinister perfection. There is a palpable sense of menace surrounding the school and the nearby woods, not to mention the female teachers. Unfortunately, the script is underwhelming, and not very well-written. The dialogue almost comes across as trite, and uninspired, and the pacing is quite plodding for the first half, with the action only picking up in the latter part of the film.
