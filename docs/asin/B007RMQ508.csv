The last few zombie movies that I've seen have left a bad taste in my mouth, lol...so to speak.. and haven't been very well for movies. Another thing it had going against it was the fact it's a movie from the Chiller Channel. I figured it was going to be like those hokey Sy-Fy movies. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that not only did it not suck but it wasn't at all like those hokey Sy-Fy movies.Steve Niles' Remains is about a group of survivors that takes refuge in a vacant casino and fights a losing battle against zombies who are growing steadily stronger, smarter and more aggressive by the minute. The movie stars such genre actors such as Lance Reddick(of Fringe), Tawny Cypress(of Heroes), Grant Bowler(of True Blood) and Miko Hughes(of Pet Semetary, Spawn & Wes Craven's New Nightmare).Steve Niles, as most of you know, wrote 30 Days of Night(which spawned two movies). I'll have to give credit. He came up with some fresh approaches for his zombies(like having them sleep, for one thing).I really enjoyed Remains. Alot more than I figured I would, truthfully.

So, kudos for the orignality, but pppfffft on practicality.Another difference, was the way the zombies acted and their shared traits, which actually made me wonder if they could even be considered zombies at all. Certain traits such as gaurding their food like an animal, barking and growling. Sleeping at night time in the standing position, eating each other as time went on, and a few other traits that i will leave to your discovery.Although the movie had a few original points, the characters and the way they were portrayed was pretty lame. very stereotypical and extremely aggravating. i literally looked at my buddy and told him that if he ever acted like any of those clowns, i'm knocking him out and using him as a distraction.Overall rating is a 3 star. it had me interested with the different zombielike theme and approach, but the acting and characters kept telling me to watch something else.",3,Original,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1609,"['original', 'take', 'Zombie', 'genre', 'certain', 'topics', 'questions', 'may', 'hear', 'someone', 'ask', 'when', 'try', 'understand/evaluate', 'zombie', 'genre', 'Such', '34', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'zombies', 'attack', 'other', '34', '34', 'virus', 'how', 'would', 'evolve', '34', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'original', 'feels', 'first', 'being', 'original', 'yet', 'typical', 'disaster', 'theme', 'caused', 'creation', 'zombie', 'creatures', 'new', 'power', 'source', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'tree', 'huggers', 'hippies', 'bad', 'boom', 'typical', 'disaster', 'movie', 'apocalypse', 'movie', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'see', 'particular', 'disaster', 'somehow', 'creating', 'zombie', 'menace', 'movie', 'So', 'kudos', 'orignality', 'pppfffft', 'practicality.Another', 'difference', 'was', 'way', 'zombies', 'acted', 'shared', 'traits', 'actually', 'made', 'wonder', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'considered', 'zombies', 'Certain', 'traits', 'such', 'gaurding', 'food', 'animal', 'barking', 'growling', 'Sleeping', 'night', 'time', 'standing', 'position', 'eating', 'other', 'time', 'went', 'few', 'other', 'traits', 'i', 'will', 'leave', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'original', 'points', 'characters', 'way', 'were', 'portrayed', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'extremely', 'aggravating', 'i', 'literally', 'looked', 'buddy', 'told', 'ever', 'acted', 'clowns', 'i', ""'m"", 'knocking', 'using', 'distraction.Overall', 'rating', '3', 'star', 'had', 'interested', 'different', 'zombielike', 'theme', 'approach', 'acting', 'characters', 'kept', 'telling', 'watch', 'something', 'else']",Steve Niles' Remains

1537295,AVR1TVB3NKTFO,B007RMQ508,Johnny Goodwin,"[8, 9]","After seeing the ""made for television"" 2012 Zombie Apocalypse, I had little hope for Remains, thinking it was going to have a lot of the same production value; mainly over used and cheesy C.G.I. affects and a thrown together story line with a poorly written script, which would all lead to annoying, clich&eacute;d characters that were under developed. Well, zombie movie lovers rejoice! The Chiller Channel has got their stuff together and made a durn fine, rooting, tooting zombie movie! Yes, it does have a slight ""made for television"" feel to it, in that there is no gratuitous loads of gore and blood and the intelligent actors don't have ""f-bomb"" diarrhea of the mouth! Some folks like that in their zombie movies, I however prefer a though out and well written story and script! And I got just that with Remains!Now in other zombie movie reviews I have read where folks are disappointed that the movie didn't add ""something new"" to the zombie genre... sorry, but Remains is not a movie where the zombies ""sparkle"" in the sunlight while line dancing the Macarena ... maybe next time!!! Steve Nile has added a few ""fresh"" twists and turns to the zombie mythology which I liked a lot. In fact, I like Nile's infected cannibals a lot more that some of the ""traditional"" dead undead zombies. Yes, they are fast, but they are not the undead! This movie is not a bunch of ""read between the lines social commentary"" either... it's all about a group of survivors fighting zombies ... some live, some die, some make dumb mistakes and well, no one's character is an over inflated, typical Hollywood wanna-be action hero... the characters were all your average everyday person who was believable and did believable things that were in character. The added prequel bonus material was great too, I just wish it had played as one long segment instead of 3. And with that, here is some negative about the movie... there were a few places where the show stopped,  an ""insert commercial here"" pause which took me out of the film for a brief moment. It would have been nice if the production company had done a tad of editing for the dvd edition! There were also some pacing / story line / plot hole problems that I felt could have been resolved had this been a mini series, or at least been a 2 part movie. We just don't get to see how the characters interact and bond with each other that much... we get little snips but nothing very deep.  And then there is the C.G.I. affects ... they were minimal which was a good thing, but there were 1 or 2 that just screamed C.G.I.!But all in all, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie! I really, really liked it a lot! The story was great and believable! The actors were wonderful and believable!!! The make-up was top notch and believable! The movie was totally worth my time and money!",4,a nice surprise,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,2823,"['seeing', 'made', 'television', '2012', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'had', 'little', 'hope', 'Remains', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'lot', 'same', 'production', 'value', 'mainly', 'used', 'cheesy', 'C.G.I', 'affects', 'thrown', 'together', 'story', 'line', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'would', 'lead', 'annoying', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'Well', 'zombie', 'movie', 'lovers', 'rejoice', 'Chiller', 'Channel', 'got', 'stuff', 'together', 'made', 'durn', 'fine', 'rooting', 'tooting', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Yes', 'have', 'slight', 'made', 'television', 'feel', 'gratuitous', 'loads', 'gore', 'blood', 'intelligent', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'f-bomb', 'diarrhea', 'mouth', 'folks', 'zombie', 'movies', 'however', 'prefer', 'though', 'out', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'script', 'got', 'just', 'Remains', 'Now', 'other', 'zombie', 'movie', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'where', 'folks', 'are', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'something', 'new', 'zombie', 'genre', 'sorry', 'Remains', 'not', 'movie', 'where', 'zombies', 'sparkle', 'sunlight', 'line', 'dancing', 'Macarena', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'Steve', 'Nile', 'added', 'few', 'fresh', 'twists', 'zombie', 'mythology', 'liked', 'lot', 'fact', 'like', 'Nile', 'infected', 'cannibals', 'lot', 'more', 'traditional', 'dead', 'undead', 'zombies', 'Yes', 'are', 'fast', 'are', 'not', 'undead', 'movie', 'not', 'bunch', 'read', 'lines', 'social', 'commentary', 'group', 'survivors', 'fighting', 'zombies', 'live', 'die', 'make', 'dumb', 'mistakes', 'well', 'one', 'character', 'inflated', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'wanna-be', 'action', 'hero', 'characters', 'were', 'average', 'everyday', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'believable', 'did', 'believable', 'things', 'were', 'character', 'added', 'prequel', 'material', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'played', 'one', 'long', 'segment', 'instead', '3', 'here', 'negative', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'show', 'stopped', 'insert', 'commercial', 'here', 'pause', 'took', 'film', 'brief', 'moment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'production', 'company', 'had', 'done', 'tad', 'editing', 'dvd', 'edition', 'were', 'also', 'pacing', '/', 'story', 'line', '/', 'plot', 'hole', 'problems', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'had', 'been', 'mini', 'series', 'least', 'been', '2', 'part', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'interact', 'bond', 'other', 'much', 'get', 'little', 'snips', 'nothing', 'very', 'deep', 'then', 'C.G.I', 'affects', 'were', 'minimal', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'were', '1', '2', 'just', 'screamed', 'C.G.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'believable', 'actors', 'were', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'make-up', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'believable', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'worth', 'time', 'money']",Steve Niles' Remains

It has a few great moments, like the scenes where they are clearing out the casino. (for those that have seen it, the scenes in the hotel rooms and parking lot were specifically intense since everything goes wrong.) So, it has its moments. I also felt like the music matched the atmosphere, although it was a bit repetitive. One of the major flaws was the acting; Evalena Marie as Tori was particularly bad at times, the rest of the cast had bad moments as well but had some decent screen time. I also felt the story was too similar to every other zombie that has ever released; they have the perfect setting to innovate, but they barely use it to their advantage. (I was expecting  something closer to Dead Rising 2.) The effects were great, except for the green screen environments and explosions. Also, some transitions were off; it had some lengthy and random fade out transitions like you'd see on a TV Show going to commercial break. (was this a web series or miniseries pieced together to be a movie?)Overall, it has a few great moments, but not enough to justify a full length movie; add on bad acting and a generic plot and you have Remains.

They awaken to find that most everyone is dead.... well dead as in the walking dead, there's only a couple of more people alive among them are Jensen (Miko Hughes, ""Mercury Rising"") who bands together with Tori and Tom to try and fend off the hoards of flesh eaters that want to break in and feast.Sometime later a band of military people come to town to seemingly rescue them, with their leader Ramsey (Lance Reddick, TV's Fringe) and his daughter Tawny Cypress (TV's Heroes) are in charge and well things don't turn out too well once their real motives get revealed. The rest of the movie involves the survivors trying to elude the zombies and escape the town before they get eaten, though it seems like Tori may just be looking out for herself more than anything else.Director Steve Niles does try for some different take on the zombie franchise, such as zombies actually sleeping (weird and kinda goofy to me) and them getting smarter as time goes on.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt.In the zombie genre, it's a pretty well know fact that 90 out of every 100 movies made suck, but this one...didn't completely suck. With the exception or 2 or maybe 3 characters, you got the impression that they were at least trying. Yes, the acting wasn't that great, and seemed a little wooden at times, but the production staff did a pretty decent job with the makeup and locations. Also, there was a couple of interesting twists on the theme, twists that I've never seen. Zombies eating each OTHER, for one, and two, zombies needing to sleep.The story, though, left you scratching your head in confusion. Little, if anything, was ever explained.How did the zombie apocolypse even start? Was it a solar flare? A nuclear echange between the U.S. and some other country? A virus? A military experiment gone awry? What makes it even more frustrating was that at least one character HINTED that she knew what went wrong. But the audience is never given an explantion. Not one. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Sorry, but that's just lazy, cop-out writing.Other things that weren't explained/didn't make sense: Exactly why the blonde chick was so angry/angsty. How could a guy fall several stories down, and catch himself, by his fingertips, no less, on a window ledge? Seriously, even Superman couldn't do that. There are a couple of other things, but it's 2AM, and I'm getting kind of sleepy, so I'll wrap this up.Is it worth watching? Yes...I guess so, at least once. If you're bored. If you're really in the Halloween spirit. If you don't mind plot-holes/lack of explanations that aren't TOO bad.

While these sketchy details are televised in the background, Tom (Grant Bowler) and Tori (Evalena ""cleavage"" Marie) go to a bomb shelter to get it on at a Reno hotel casino. When they emerge I expected to see Burgess Meredith looking for his glasses, but instead there is a full blown zombie food riot going on outside. Like ""Dawn of the Dead"" the first rule is to secure the perimeter and eliminate zombie hazards within the safe zone...which isn't that easy as this appears to be the only hotel casino that doesn't have a gun stashed anywhere.Our non-zombie people group narrows down to four, with one openly gay character. (Guess who dies first because killing off the brother first has become too cliche?) The radioactive zombies require head shots and are a combination of fast moving and foot dragging zombies, whichever suits the mood of the director. They have the unusual characteristic of sleeping while standing up and unlike the standard zombie fare, they do feed off each other. Bites appear to cause infection. At one point they talk about going to Catalina, which made me think of this being a ""Zombie Apocalypse"" prequel...which it isn't...I think.Tom and Tori are the main characters who have a rocky relationship. There are some CG fire effects that are rather poor, i.e. holding a match in front of a picture, but they don't last long. Good acting performances for a low budget zombie film.
