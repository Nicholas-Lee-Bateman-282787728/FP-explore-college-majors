My mom rented this movie for me one night several years ago when I was a teenager living in NY.  After viewing the movie I quickly ordered it from Blockbuster on VHS.  I cried several times while watching this movie not because it's sad but because it touched me.  It had everything a good movie should have laughter, sadness, excitement, happiness and most importantly LOVE!  I give this movie 10 stars!!! :)  I can't wait to buy this movie on DVD!  It is a very inspiring story and there is never a dull moment.  It is a very well done independent film that speaks to anyone who has gone through any kind of struggles in life.  This movie is about achieving your dreams and reaching your goals despite hurdles and mountains that come in your way.  It also shows growth and maturity in the life of a young woman.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone especially youth and teens.",5,TOUCHING AND INSPIRING MOVIE!!!!!!!!,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,959,"['Do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'are', 'ready', 'deep', 'moving', 'documentary', 'mom', 'rented', 'movie', 'one', 'night', 'several', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'living', 'NY', 'viewing', 'movie', 'quickly', 'ordered', 'Blockbuster', 'VHS', 'cried', 'several', 'times', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'sad', 'touched', 'had', 'everything', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'laughter', 'sadness', 'excitement', 'happiness', 'most', 'importantly', 'LOVE', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'buy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'very', 'inspiring', 'story', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'independent', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'kind', 'struggles', 'life', 'movie', 'achieving', 'dreams', 'reaching', 'goals', 'hurdles', 'mountains', 'come', 'way', 'also', 'growth', 'maturity', 'life', 'young', 'woman', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'especially', 'youth', 'teens']",Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.

It is Straight Out of Brooklyn meets Poetic Justice. In the end, the director Leslie Harris makes a statement, ""A Film Hollywood Dared Not Do."" How true. And that becomes the only film she ever did. The reason why critics have been harsh on the film is because of Ariyan Johnson's performance as Chantel. To me, what she did is Oscar worthy and is exactly dead-on correct portrayal of many female teenagers (the race doesn't matter although I've seen it quite often in Blacks and Latinos) who reside in the projects and the surrounding areas and attend these Title I schools. She keeps saying that she is smart, gets all A's, and takes calculus to justify her intelligence. Well, let me tell you the real story. I used to be a math teacher at a high school serving inner city students from Camden (as matter of fact, you could change the setting of NYC boroughs to Camden, Trenton, Newark, etc, and it's still the same difference). I taught all classes from Algebra to AP Calculus to all grade levels. My experiences with the precalculus and calculus students were very interesting. Not a single student knew anything beyond 2nd grade math, and none of them could recall a simple algebra technique. So, it was a very tough for me to get through the year, trying to teach something and not getting a lot of hassle from the students, their parents, and the administrators all alike. The hassle was always in the form of ""this can't be real,"" ""none of it is necessary,"" etc. Then, I've had a lot of students who were barely failing telling me that ""I always get all A's. This isn't right."" Well, there were a lot of times that I wished I could say that they knew nothing about anything. So, truth be told, every student was allowed to pass and could move up in upper levels. That's how some of them got into AP classes for English, history, calculus, biology, etc., and they always scored `1' on the national exam. Why? Because they knew nothing. There were no real academics standard in the school I taught at, and they had zero academic discipline. In the end of the four years, at least one or two students got a full scholarship to a major 4 year university simply because s/he was very outgoing, sociably adept, and mature regardless of the academics. One of them was exactly like Chantel who ended up taking AP calculus under me and eventually getting a '1' on the exam. That's the reality of these Title I schools. It's virtually impossible to teach academics to these students who act like they know it all, do not adhere to academics standards, and pretend to be succeeding (well, being deceived by the school that they are succeeding) in life. So, yeah..I've had many students like Chantel, and oh, yeah...the attitude is forever alive. So, I knew what the history teacher and the principal (I would gladly pay money to see Chantel to be talked down by Morgan Freeman's Joe Clark...oh boyyy) were going through. It's no fun to work with these kids. Watching the film forced me to relive the memories of handling these kids with horrible attitudes. Until Chantel loses her attitude, she will never amount anything more than a minimum wage job. Why I think the film is a masterpiece is because it is as true and realistic as it gets, and I don't see any other film trying to do that. All in all, Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. is a wonderful and realistic portrayal of what life is like for the inner city population. On a side note, there was an interesting moment where Chantel's baby was being dumped out in a trash bag; this actually foretold an incident of a high school girl named Melissa Drexler from Lacey, NJ in 1997 who gave birth to a baby during her prom in a bathroom and dumped it in the trash container before getting back to the dance floor.",5,Awfully Realistic.,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3897,"['Viewed', '11/12Rate', '1011/12', 'Just', 'Girl', 'I.R.T', 'awfully', 'realistic', 'picture', 'too', 'true', 'aspect', 'life', 'Straight', 'Brooklyn', 'meets', 'Poetic', 'Justice', 'end', 'director', 'Leslie', 'Harris', 'statement', 'Film', 'Hollywood', 'Dared', 'Not', 'Do', 'How', 'true', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'did', 'reason', 'why', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'harsh', 'film', 'Ariyan', 'Johnson', 'performance', 'Chantel', 'what', 'did', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'exactly', 'dead-on', 'correct', 'portrayal', 'many', 'female', 'teenagers', 'race', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'often', 'Blacks', 'Latinos', 'who', 'reside', 'projects', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'attend', 'Title', 'schools', 'saying', 'smart', 'calculus', 'justify', 'intelligence', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'used', 'be', 'math', 'teacher', 'high', 'school', 'serving', 'inner', 'city', 'students', 'Camden', 'matter', 'fact', 'could', 'change', 'setting', 'NYC', 'boroughs', 'Camden', 'Trenton', 'Newark', 'etc', 'still', 'same', 'difference', 'taught', 'classes', 'Algebra', 'AP', 'Calculus', 'grade', 'levels', 'experiences', 'precalculus', 'calculus', 'students', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'Not', 'single', 'student', 'knew', 'anything', '2nd', 'grade', 'math', 'none', 'could', 'recall', 'simple', 'algebra', 'technique', 'So', 'was', 'very', 'tough', 'get', 'year', 'trying', 'teach', 'something', 'not', 'getting', 'lot', 'hassle', 'students', 'parents', 'administrators', 'alike', 'hassle', 'was', 'always', 'form', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'real', 'none', 'necessary', 'etc', 'Then', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lot', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'barely', 'failing', 'telling', 'always', 'get', ""n't"", 'right', 'Well', 'were', 'lot', 'times', 'wished', 'could', 'say', 'knew', 'nothing', 'anything', 'So', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'student', 'was', 'allowed', 'pass', 'could', 'move', 'up', 'upper', 'levels', 'how', 'got', 'AP', 'classes', 'English', 'history', 'calculus', 'biology', 'etc.', 'always', 'scored', '1', 'national', 'exam', 'Why', 'knew', 'nothing', 'were', 'real', 'academics', 'standard', 'school', 'taught', 'had', 'zero', 'academic', 'discipline', 'end', 'four', 'years', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'students', 'got', 'full', 'scholarship', 'major', '4', 'year', 'university', 'simply', 's/he', 'was', 'very', 'outgoing', 'sociably', 'mature', 'regardless', 'academics', 'One', 'was', 'exactly', 'like', 'Chantel', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'AP', 'calculus', 'eventually', 'getting', '1', 'exam', 'reality', 'Title', 'schools', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'teach', 'academics', 'students', 'who', 'act', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'adhere', 'academics', 'standards', 'pretend', 'be', 'succeeding', 'well', 'being', 'deceived', 'school', 'are', 'succeeding', 'life', 'So', ""'ve"", 'had', 'many', 'students', 'Chantel', 'oh', 'yeah', 'attitude', 'forever', 'alive', 'So', 'knew', 'what', 'history', 'teacher', 'principal', 'would', 'gladly', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'Chantel', 'be', 'talked', 'down', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'oh', 'boyyy', 'were', 'going', 'fun', 'work', 'kids', 'Watching', 'film', 'forced', 'relive', 'memories', 'handling', 'kids', 'horrible', 'attitudes', 'Chantel', 'attitude', 'will', 'never', 'amount', 'anything', 'more', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'Why', 'think', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'true', 'realistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'film', 'trying', 'do', 'Just', 'Girl', 'I.R.T', 'wonderful', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'life', 'inner', 'city', 'population', 'side', 'note', 'was', 'interesting', 'moment', 'where', 'Chantel', 'baby', 'was', 'being', 'dumped', 'out', 'trash', 'bag', 'actually', 'incident', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Melissa', 'Drexler', 'Lacey', 'NJ', '1997', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', 'baby', 'prom', 'bathroom', 'dumped', 'trash', 'container', 'getting', 'back', 'dance', 'floor']",Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.

697138,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0000640RZ,Dorrie Wheeler,"[17, 17]","Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. is one of those early 90's movies that was easy to miss if you weren't looking for it.  This movie really is a gem and director Leslie Harris worked really hard to bring her movie to the public.  The film is a fictional account of a young woman named Chantal who lives in the projects who strives to graduate from high school early to become a doctor--and most of all to escape the projects.  Chantal is street smart and sweet, but she gets sidetracked when she gets pregnant.  This is a good movie to show in an educational setting but the language is a bit much at times.  My biggest complaints are with the Artesian DVD release.  It would have been nice to get some kind of commentary from the director. On top of that the chapter breaks are huge, meaning one chapter to the next includes several scenes.  Another complaint is that the original film was small budget so the lightning is poor in some scenes, for instance in the scene where Chantal is in the park with Nattette and Lavonica you can barely see Natette's face.  It's obvious there was no restoration to the film, it's just kind of there. I am glad this film made it to DVD.  It is one of the films we show the girls in my junior sorority during our teen pregnancy prevention program.",4,"Great Movie, DVD quality so-so",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1282,"['Just', 'Girl', 'I.R.T', 'one', 'early', '90', 'movies', 'was', 'easy', 'miss', 'were', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'really', 'gem', 'director', 'Leslie', 'Harris', 'worked', 'really', 'hard', 'bring', 'movie', 'public', 'film', 'fictional', 'account', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Chantal', 'who', 'projects', 'who', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'early', 'become', 'doctor', 'most', 'escape', 'projects', 'Chantal', 'street', 'smart', 'sweet', 'sidetracked', 'when', 'pregnant', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'educational', 'setting', 'language', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'are', 'Artesian', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'kind', 'commentary', 'director', 'top', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'are', 'huge', 'meaning', 'one', 'chapter', 'next', 'several', 'scenes', 'complaint', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'small', 'budget', 'lightning', 'poor', 'scenes', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Chantal', 'park', 'Nattette', 'Lavonica', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'Natette', 'face', 'obvious', 'was', 'restoration', 'film', 'just', 'kind', 'there', 'am', 'glad', 'film', 'made', 'DVD', 'one', 'films', 'show', 'girls', 'junior', 'sorority', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'prevention', 'program']",Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.
