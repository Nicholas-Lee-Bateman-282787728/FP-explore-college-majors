Sweet and moving film on the African-American school children life in a small community around the 1940-1950's. I recommend this movie highly, I was glad to have this DVD in my library collection.AAC",5,"""The Bright Road""",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,274,"['Wonderful', 'movie', 'think', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'Sweet', 'moving', 'film', 'African-American', 'school', 'children', 'life', 'small', 'community', '1940-1950', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'was', 'glad', 'have', 'DVD', 'library', 'collection.AAC']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie on DVD the last time I checked.I first saw this movie in 1953 when I was nine or ten years old depending on the month I saw it.  At that time I felt it was the best movie I had ever seen.  This movie is tame by today's standards, but I still find it to be worth five stars.  I remembered parts of this movie from sixty years ago and was reminded of other parts when I viewed it again today.The story takes place in a school setting.  Dorothy Dandridge plays the role on a new teacher and facing the frustration of dealing with an indifferent student while Harry Belafonte plays the role of the principal.  It is also the story of the troubled student, C.T. Young having to deal with the death of his new-found friend, Tanya.Who knows.  Perhaps this movie played a part in my choosing to become an elementary teacher for 32 years.  After all these years I still find this movie to be an unsung nugget that is sure to be an uplifting experience for the entire family to enjoy.",5,This Movie Is A Gem and I'm Glad to See It Finally Released on DVD.,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1148,"['have', 'periodically', 'checked', 'Amazon', 'see', 'movie', 'Bright', 'Road', 'was', 'available', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'disappointed', 'time', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'movie', 'DVD', 'last', 'time', 'checked.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', '1953', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'depending', 'month', 'saw', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'still', 'find', 'be', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'remembered', 'parts', 'movie', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'reminded', 'other', 'parts', 'when', 'viewed', 'again', 'today.The', 'story', 'place', 'school', 'setting', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'role', 'new', 'teacher', 'facing', 'frustration', 'dealing', 'indifferent', 'student', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'role', 'principal', 'also', 'story', 'troubled', 'student', 'C.T', 'Young', 'having', 'deal', 'death', 'new-found', 'friend', 'Tanya.Who', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'played', 'part', 'choosing', 'become', 'elementary', 'teacher', '32', 'years', 'years', 'still', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'unsung', 'nugget', 'sure', 'be', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoy']",N/A

This also marked the first time I saw myself in a movie because I was 9 years old at the time and looked like the students in this Hollywood version of an all black school elementary school. We all hoped that other un-stereotyped pictures would follow but that did not happen until years later when blacks produced black films.This classic film was also my introduction to Dorothy Dandridge and I have been in love with the beautiful screen goddess ever since.,5,Bright Hope,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,564,"['BRIGHT', 'ROAD', 'first', 'movie', 'presented', 'colored', 'people', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'role', 'models', 'also', 'marked', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'looked', 'students', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'black', 'school', 'elementary', 'school', 'hoped', 'other', 'un-stereotyped', 'pictures', 'would', 'follow', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'blacks', 'produced', 'black', 'films.This', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'introduction', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'beautiful', 'screen', 'goddess', 'ever']",N/A
