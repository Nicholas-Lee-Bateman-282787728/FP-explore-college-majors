The attractiveness of the actresses and the shooting style still hold up after all these years.  They should show the entire series syndicated in foreign countries especially developing ones.  The stories are nice, the actresses are so likable and the clothes are not too terrible at all.

I cannot argue with the choice of episodes, but why only five?

Men still love this show because of the MUCHO sex-appeal(especially Fawcett and Smith;Jackson is not bad either!). Not as racy as the new version with Lucy Lui and Cameron Diaz(others too!) but Fawcett in one episode might change your mind in that category(she plays a prostitute;the v-neck outfit from Heaven;WOW!!).

I really didn't get a chance to see much of this first season when it ran in 1976, but I knew all about the three women who were the Angels thanks to tons of magazine coverage.  The show was a phenomenom.  Everybody had the Farrah poster!Jump to today.  This set is a very nice, complete view of season 1 (the only season Farrah was on the show).  It includes the pilot and 22 episodes.  Some are good and hold up with time.  A couple are clinkers.  But, the sound and video reproduction are good and it is easy to see why everyone was so spellbound by the show - Kate, Farrah and Jackelyn were stunning.",4,A Fun Blast From The Past,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,662,"['When', 'shows', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'ran', '1976', 'knew', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'Angels', 'thanks', 'tons', 'magazine', 'coverage', 'show', 'was', 'phenomenom', 'Everybody', 'had', 'Farrah', 'poster', 'Jump', 'today', 'set', 'very', 'nice', 'complete', 'view', 'season', '1', 'only', 'season', 'Farrah', 'was', 'show', 'pilot', '22', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'couple', 'are', 'clinkers', 'sound', 'video', 'reproduction', 'are', 'good', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'everyone', 'was', 'so', 'spellbound', 'show', 'Kate', 'Farrah', 'Jackelyn', 'were', 'stunning']","The Best of Charlie's Angels, Season 1"

However, I enjoyed the Best of Season 1 most of all! There is a feeling of comraderie and a better flow to the episodes than in the later seasons. Perhaps the acting isn't as good, I don't know if I'm a goo judge of that, but I don't mind as long as it's enjoyable and relaxing. Perhaps in the later seasons they tried to make the social issues more prominent or realistic. In any case, this DVD is just good, clean fun!",5,I Enjoyed Season 1!,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,513,"['reason', 'had', 'impression', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'inferior', 'so', 'began', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'Best', 'Season', '1', 'most', 'feeling', 'comraderie', 'better', 'flow', 'episodes', 'later', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'acting', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'goo', 'judge', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'as', 'long', 'enjoyable', 'relaxing', 'Perhaps', 'later', 'seasons', 'tried', 'make', 'social', 'issues', 'more', 'prominent', 'realistic', 'case', 'DVD', 'just', 'good', 'clean', 'fun']","The Best of Charlie's Angels, Season 1"
