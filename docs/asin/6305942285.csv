""toonstuff""","[19, 25]","Though not as great as the original &quot;Pooh&quot; cartoons, The Tigger Movie is a magical, gentle addition to the Winnie the Pooh franchise.  The story centers around comic relief character Tigger, and his search to find others of his kind.  It turns out that being the only one is not all it's cracked up to be.  When the other residents of the Hundred Acre Wood, lead by a well-meaning Roo, write a letter to Tigger from a fictional &quot;family&quot; of Tiggers, Tigger thinks it's all working out perfectly.  Unfortunately, the charade can't go on forever... and it all leads to a thrilling snowy climax at the edge of the Hundred Acre Woods.Tigger Movie is a story about belonging... about being part of a family.  The message of this heartwarming film is that your family consists of those who love you as well as those who look like you.  Everyone can belong, and the bonds of friendship are stronger than steel.Kids will relate to the wonderfully acted Roo, and parents and adults will appreciate and be touched by this tale of courage, loyalty, and love.The animation is much like that of the original cartoons, and the backgrounds are beautiful.  The film's songs were written by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the original Pooh tunes.

483410,AMGZGF7MYDMZP,6305942285,"Addison Cooper ""Adoption Social Worker""","[3, 3]","Tigger has often sung that ""the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one."" In this movie, he starts to question that. Why is he the only Tigger? Where are all the other Tiggers? Roo asks a pretty powerful question: ""I've got a momma. Don't you have a family somewhere, too?"" Tigger seems inspired by the question, and starts trying to connect with his family. Tigger experiences doubts, questions, fantasies, anger, rejection, and questions. Why has no one told him about other Tiggers? Why have his friends lied to him?Tigger leaves the neighborhood in search of the Tiggers he imagines to be his real family. He doesn't find the other Tiggers, but does realize that his friends love him, and that because of that love, his friends are his family. Tigger declares Roo to be his brother by the end of the movie.This is a good movie for adoptive families. This song-filled, animated movie features familiar Disney characters: Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Christopher Robin. It will most likely appeal to younger children, perhaps up to age ten. However, the theme of longing for a relationship with birth family members is relevant to older children as well. Older children might be convinced to watch The Tigger Movie as part of a family night, and would likely benefit from it.Parents and friends of adoptees watching the movie can consider how Tigger is feeling, and can place themselves in the roles of the other characters in the film: can they see themselves being loving like Kanga, supportive like Roo, well-meaning but misguided like Owl and Pooh, or cranky about the search, like Rabbit?",5,Is Tigger Adopted?,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1651,"['Tigger', 'often', 'sung', 'most', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'Tiggers', ""'m"", 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'question', 'Why', 'only', 'Tigger', 'Where', 'are', 'other', 'Tiggers', 'Roo', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'question', ""'ve"", 'got', 'momma', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'somewhere', 'too', 'Tigger', 'inspired', 'question', 'trying', 'connect', 'family', 'Tigger', 'doubts', 'questions', 'fantasies', 'anger', 'rejection', 'questions', 'Why', 'one', 'told', 'other', 'Tiggers', 'Why', 'have', 'friends', 'lied', 'Tigger', 'neighborhood', 'search', 'Tiggers', 'be', 'real', 'family', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'Tiggers', 'realize', 'friends', 'love', 'love', 'friends', 'are', 'family', 'Tigger', 'Roo', 'be', 'brother', 'end', 'movie.This', 'good', 'movie', 'adoptive', 'families', 'song-filled', 'animated', 'movie', 'features', 'familiar', 'Disney', 'characters', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Piglet', 'Kanga', 'Roo', 'Owl', 'Eeyore', 'Rabbit', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'appeal', 'younger', 'children', 'perhaps', 'age', 'ten', 'However', 'theme', 'longing', 'relationship', 'birth', 'family', 'members', 'relevant', 'older', 'children', 'well', 'Older', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'convinced', 'watch', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'part', 'family', 'night', 'would', 'likely', 'benefit', 'it.Parents', 'friends', 'adoptees', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'consider', 'how', 'Tigger', 'feeling', 'can', 'place', 'roles', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'being', 'loving', 'Kanga', 'supportive', 'Roo', 'well-meaning', 'misguided', 'Owl', 'Pooh', 'cranky', 'search', 'Rabbit']",N/A

Nyhuis,"[2, 4]","Okay, here's a rundown of what The Tigger Movie has to offer for teens who are trying to look cool so their friends won't totally hate them:1. There's one interesting song number where Tigger talks about his family.  You see all kinds of Tiggers, from a Jerry Springer Tigger to a Marilyn Monroe Tigger.  It's pretty interesting.2. The movie can be campy sometimes if you're in the mood.3. If you play the guitar, try playing that simple guitar picking that's found in the movie and impress your little sister.4. It'll make you appreciate good, family films like Fargo and Bringing Out the Dead.  Go buy them so Amazon can make some money.Well, that's it.

483413,A1FJOQ3T4G7HVB,6305942285,Angel C. Little,"[0, 0]","Every review so far has noted the plot to this movie so I'll skip that and move onto my thoughts of the movie which is an excellent movie for kids and Tiggers of all ages. Simply put, Disney once again has given the world a movie that is clean and fun for everyone and is very well done. Sure the animation is a few notches down from their typical theater run movie but its still effective enough and is a bit above the typical Pooh fare. I was very stunned to see how well Jim Cummings did replacing Paul Winchel as the voice of Tigger - while still doing Pooh on top of it. The movie itself is wonderful and once again I stress that its perfect!On DVD itself however, its a tad far from perfect. The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is mostly front and center based with very very little activity on the rear channels at all - very disappointing considering the amount of things that could of been placed there. Another thing is Disney lied about the aspect ratio of the movie itself - on the box it states 1.66:1 (as that's the ratio its supposed to be) but anyone with enough knowledge of ratios can easily tell its 1.83:1. While I can understand Disney reframing the matting for viewing on HDTV, at least be honest to the public about what ratio it runs at.Beyond those two complaints which is the main reason why I gave the movie only 4 out of 5 stars, the DVD is excellent. Picture is very clean as it should be for a very recent Disney film with no compression artifacts, dust, or edge enhancement noticed. The audio, despite not being a great surround mix, is very clear - sound effects are bright, dialog is very understandable, and the movie's music score and songs sound sweet on the DVD. Plus the extras on the disc are also nice - the Kenny Loggins video is very well done and is worth at least one viewing as the song fits wonderfully in with the films themes of family, not to mention a nice song all around.Overall, The Tigger Movie is a wonderful movie and is great for Kids and T-I-DoubleGER-ERs of all ages!",4,Great movie for Kids and T-I-DoubleGER-ERs of all ages,970963200,"10 8, 2000",2000,2016,"['review', 'so', 'far', 'noted', 'plot', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'move', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'excellent', 'movie', 'kids', 'Tiggers', 'ages', 'Simply', 'put', 'Disney', 'once', 'again', 'given', 'world', 'movie', 'clean', 'fun', 'everyone', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Sure', 'animation', 'few', 'notches', 'down', 'typical', 'theater', 'run', 'movie', 'still', 'effective', 'enough', 'bit', 'typical', 'Pooh', 'fare', 'was', 'very', 'stunned', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'did', 'replacing', 'Paul', 'Winchel', 'voice', 'Tigger', 'while', 'still', 'doing', 'Pooh', 'top', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'once', 'again', 'stress', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'however', 'tad', 'far', 'perfect', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'mix', 'mostly', 'front', 'center', 'based', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'activity', 'rear', 'channels', 'very', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'amount', 'things', 'could', 'been', 'placed', 'there', 'thing', 'Disney', 'lied', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'movie', 'box', '1.66:1', 'ratio', 'supposed', 'be', 'anyone', 'enough', 'knowledge', 'ratios', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', '1.83:1', 'can', 'understand', 'Disney', 'reframing', 'matting', 'viewing', 'HDTV', 'least', 'be', 'honest', 'public', 'what', 'ratio', 'at.Beyond', 'two', 'complaints', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', 'only', '4', '5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'Picture', 'very', 'clean', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'recent', 'Disney', 'film', 'compression', 'dust', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'noticed', 'audio', 'not', 'being', 'great', 'surround', 'mix', 'very', 'clear', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'bright', 'dialog', 'very', 'understandable', 'movie', 'music', 'score', 'songs', 'sound', 'sweet', 'DVD', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'song', 'wonderfully', 'films', 'themes', 'family', 'not', 'mention', 'nice', 'song', 'around.Overall', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'great', 'Kids', 'T-I-DoubleGER-ERs', 'ages']",N/A

483430,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305942285,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Be prepared to do some bouncing as ""The Tigger Movie"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD!Since 1926, ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" has been a staple in American pop culture as a family friendly character and stories that many children for generations have grown up with.  And adults who have continued to share that with their own children.In 2000, ""The Tigger movie"" became the first animated feature film to not feature Winnie-the-Pooh but focus on Pooh's friend Tigger.  Written and directed by Jun Falkenstein (who worked on ""9&#8243;, ""The Smurfs"", ""Despicable Me"" and directed ""Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving"" and ""A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving"") and would feature songs written by Robert and Richard Sherman  (""Mary Poppins"", ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", ""The Jungle Book"", ""Charlotte's Web"" and ""The Aristocats"") creating the music for the film.  Their first feature film score since 1971 for ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  The film would also feature a collaboration between the Sherman Brothers and singer Kenny Loggins.The film was originally planned to be a direct-to-video release but when Disney CEO Michael Eisner heard the Sherman Brothers score, Eisner wanted to release the film in theaters.And it was a great choice for Disney as the film would earn over $96 million in the box office and also win ""Annie Awards"" for ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production"" and ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Music in an Animated Feature Production"" and ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production"".VIDEO:""The Tigger Movie"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The film is vibrant, colorful and the art backgrounds are nicely painted.  We get to see the various seasons of Hundred Acre Wood and was glad to see the emphasis on detail for objects, trees, landscape in the art design.  And as for the character design, the animators kept close to the original style of the characters that many people have grown up with.If anything, ""The Tigger Movie"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray and I saw no artifacts, banding or any negative issues with this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Tigger Movie"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and 5.1 Dolby Digital French and Spanish Language Tracks.  The film is primarily dialogue and music-driven and thus more center/front channel.  Dialogue and lossless audio is crystal clear with a little use of the surround channels towards the end (during the more action-based sequences).  But overall, the lossless soundtrack is good.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Tigger Movie"" comes with the following special features:A Tigger Tale- (6:22) The crew reunite to discuss their experience of making ""The Tigger Movie"".Mini-Adventures of Winnie The Pooh - (24:21) A total of ten (three-minute) mini-adventures featuring Winnie the Pooh and friends.  Included are ""Pooh and Tigger"", ""The Most Wonderful Thing about Tiggers"", ""Eeyore's House"", ""Someone Like Tigger"", ""What Tiggers Do Best"", ""Lullabee"", ""The Super Bounce"", ""Tigger Goes Ice Skating"", ""The Jagular"", ""Unbouncing Tiger"".Round My Family Tree Sing-Along - (2:45) Featuring a sing-along for Tigger's ""Round My Family Tree"".Kenny Loggins Music Video - (4:49) Featuring Kenny Loggins music video for ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home"".EXTRAS:""The Tigger Movie"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of the film presented in 1:78:1 widescreen, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Also, included is a family tree activity poster with stickers.JUDGMENT CALL:I know that I'm not the only one who grew up with ""Winnie the Pooh"".  It's been in my family and even my son today was raised enjoying stuffed animals and the animated films (and series).Having reviewed several of the animated films, ""The Tigger Movie"" having been released in 2001 and also now being released on Blu-ray is the best looking ""Winnie the Pooh"" related animated film on video.  And what makes this film so entertaining and different from other Pooh films is that it focuses on Tigger.Tigger is one of the most jovial characters ever created but also a character that gets into a bit of trouble because he is always wanting to have fun.  But it's that style that tends to attract the young viewers as the other characters are typically shy or reserved, Tigger is all over the place.But this time around, you get a fun, energetic film but you also get pulled in by its story because it is quite sad that Tigger has all this energy and wants to have fun, but since the others are not Tiggers, they don't have the same type of drive and thus it leads to Tigger being sadden that there is no family or anyone like him around.  Or is there?As ""The Tigger Movie"" is a film that does focus on Tigger, we also see another character grabbing the spotlight and that is little Roo, Kanga's son.  Roo is usually featured a few times in a film but this time around, we get to see Roo hanging out with Tigger but also learning from him and trying to be a good ""little brother"".So, this film definitely gives us a new perspective of characters other than Winnie the Pooh, Piglet or Rabbit.For the most part, I found ""The Tigger Movie"" to be a wonderful family film.  I watched it with my nine-year-old, at first I was wondering if he would feel that he was too old for this animated film but he was captivated by it and enjoyed it.There is a lot to learn, may it be one's private space to also the importance of friendship, children can surely learn from ""The Tigger Movie"".  And as for the Blu-ray release, children will also enjoy it for the inclusion of the mini-adventures of Winnie the Pooh plus the included family tree activity posters and stickers.  And also another positive for parents is that the Blu-ray does come with a DVD, so definitely handy for those going on long commutes or a film for children to watch during vacation time.  And as mentioned, seeing this animated film in HD on Blu-ray, it looks and sounds great!Overall, if you are a parent looking for a safe, fun and touching family film, you can't go wrong with ""The Tigger Movie"".  Recommended!",4,"If you are a parent looking for a safe, fun and touching family film, you can't go wrong with ""The Tigger Movie"".

483431,ADWQPR0LJD4J,6305942285,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","I've never been a big Winnie the Pooh fan. As a child who grew up in a household full of sic-fi nerds, the 1,000 Acre Woods really didn't hold any fascination for me. I was more interested in a future world where fully dressed apes spoke to each other and tortured humans the same way they had been.Who wants to hang out with a bunch of bears, kangaroos, and rabbits in the woods when you could fly around space with Luke Skywalker battling stormtroopers and Darth Vader in a galaxy far, far away? I may not feel an emotional tie to Winnie the way many children and their parents do, but I can enjoy one of their adventures every once in a while.Somebody loves the cuddly little yellow fella and his cute cast of merry friends. The critical and audience reception to last year's big-screen film ""Winnie the Pooh"" proved there is still interest in the honey-loving animal. That was obviously one of the motivations for Walt Disney Home Entertainment's release of ""The Tigger Movie"" on Blu-ray for the first time.Tigger longs for a family of his own kind. He searches high and low for any members of his orange and black striped breed but can't seem to locate any. Can his friends help him find his direct relatives while teaching him the real definition of friends and family?This movie has a message just like all Disney movies do. It concentrates on the importance of friends and shows viewers that your family isn't necessarily made up of people you're immediately connected to by blood. Families are made up of individuals who care for each other but don't share the same lineage.The world of Winnie the Pooh is timeless. Obviously, that's part of the attraction to the stories and movies. Everyone wants to escape to a fantasy world like Christopher Robin. They want to hang out with their childhood toys and forget about all the cares of the world for a while.The high-definition transfer of the movie serves the hand-drawn animation well. It brings out all the vibrant colors in the film. All the songs, dialogue, and background effects mix well together in an expansive 5.1 surround mix.Bonus material for this will please consumers and their children. They include 10 ""Mini-Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" shorts, ""Round My Family Tree"" Sing-Along Song, and Kenny Loggins' music video for ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home."" It also contains the interactive Disney Intermission and the featurette ""A Tigger Tale.""The Blu-ray ""Bounce - A - RRRific"" Special Edition of ""The Tigger Movie"" is a great addition to the Disney library for fans of Winnie the Pooh. Even though it concentrates on the bouncy tiger, there's still plenty of the lovable bear in the movie to please enthusiasts. It's a wholesome movie that families can enjoy together over and over.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Tigger Movie""",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2757,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'fan', 'child', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'household', 'full', 'sic-fi', 'nerds', '1,000', 'Acre', 'Woods', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'fascination', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'future', 'world', 'where', 'fully', 'dressed', 'apes', 'spoke', 'other', 'tortured', 'humans', 'same', 'way', 'had', 'been.Who', 'hang', 'out', 'bunch', 'bears', 'kangaroos', 'rabbits', 'woods', 'when', 'could', 'fly', 'space', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'battling', 'stormtroopers', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'galaxy', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'emotional', 'tie', 'Winnie', 'way', 'many', 'children', 'parents', 'do', 'can', 'enjoy', 'one', 'adventures', 'once', 'while.Somebody', 'cuddly', 'little', 'yellow', 'fella', 'cute', 'cast', 'merry', 'friends', 'critical', 'audience', 'reception', 'last', 'year', 'big-screen', 'film', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'proved', 'still', 'interest', 'honey-loving', 'animal', 'was', 'obviously', 'one', 'motivations', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'release', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'Blu-ray', 'first', 'time.Tigger', 'longs', 'family', 'own', 'kind', 'high', 'low', 'members', 'orange', 'black', 'striped', 'breed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'locate', 'Can', 'friends', 'help', 'find', 'direct', 'relatives', 'teaching', 'real', 'definition', 'friends', 'family', 'movie', 'message', 'just', 'Disney', 'movies', 'do', 'importance', 'friends', 'viewers', 'family', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'made', 'people', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'connected', 'blood', 'Families', 'are', 'made', 'individuals', 'who', 'care', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'lineage.The', 'world', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'timeless', 'Obviously', 'part', 'attraction', 'stories', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'escape', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'want', 'hang', 'out', 'childhood', 'toys', 'forget', 'cares', 'world', 'while.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'movie', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'well', 'out', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'film', 'songs', 'dialogue', 'background', 'effects', 'mix', 'well', 'together', 'expansive', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix.Bonus', 'material', 'will', 'please', 'consumers', 'children', 'include', '10', 'Mini-Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'shorts', 'Round', 'My', 'Family', 'Tree', 'Sing-Along', 'Song', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'music', 'video', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Lead', 'Home', 'also', 'interactive', 'Disney', 'Intermission', 'featurette', 'A', 'Tigger', 'Tale', 'Blu-ray', 'Bounce', 'RRRific', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'great', 'addition', 'Disney', 'library', 'fans', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Even', 'bouncy', 'tiger', 'still', 'plenty', 'lovable', 'bear', 'movie', 'please', 'enthusiasts', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together']",N/A

483433,A3IXOTBQ767WJ7,6305942285,Glen Eric Reed,"[21, 25]","When I first heard this movie was coming out, my main question was why a theatrical release instead of direct-to-video? Many Disney sequels have  gone that route, including the last feature-length Winnie the Pooh film,  The Search for Christopher Robin.The simple fact of the matter is  probably that Disney figured they could make more money with a theatrical  release (it came out with absolutely no competition for its intended  audience). Happily, it's also true that this movie was a step above the  usual direct-to-video fare. Most of the animation was uninspired (it's easy  to tell there are fewer frames per second than in major Disney theatrical  releases), but the scripts and voice acting were actually quite  good.I've been a fan of the Winnie the Pooh stuff for what seems like  forever, so it's hard for me NOT to enjoy any of it. But the simple,  hearwarming story of Tigger's discovery of himself and how much his friends  really care about him just works. Sure, it's a childlike tale, but isn't  that the target audience? We're not looking for Citizen Kane when we turn  to Winnie the Pooh. We're looking for comfort and support to be who we are.  It's a great message for kids, and this movie does a great job of  presenting it.I was a bit trepidatious when I saw that Jim Cummings (the  voice of Pooh in all but the original shorts) was taking over for Paul  Winchell as the voice of Tigger. Turns out that he does an unbelievable  Paul Winchell impression!

It's also the last feature film with original songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.And find songs they are. My favorite is ""Round My Family Tree,"" which is chock full of clever lines (and visual in-jokes, including a reference to the Rankin/Bass Saturday morning cartoon, Jackson 5ive). The end credits introduced ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home,"" which has now become an easy listening standard, co-written and sung by Kenny Loggins.It's also the first time the Sherman song, ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers,"" is sung to completion onscreen. In the earlier films and TV shows, Paul Winchell (Disney's original Tigger voice) sang four lines of the song, but in The Tigger Movie Jim Cummings (the current Tigger) sings the entire song. Historically, actor Sam Edwards sang the whole song first, but on Disneyland records instead of films.The Tigger Movie makes a nice companion to all the original Walt Disney featurettes, or the compilation film, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, as well as the recent theatrical Winnie the Pooh. The storyline is simple in the Milne style and meanders on purpose -- the world of Pooh and friends is simple, direct and free of extraneous spectacle.My only issue with The Tigger Movie is that its success, arguably thanks to the Shermans, did not result in their being involved with the follow-up, Piglet's Big Movie. Instead, Carly Simon handled the music without the brothers, which is fine, but somehow not the same.The new ""Bounce-a rrriffic"" special edition is most notable for how great it looks in Blu-ray. It contains the same features as the 10th anniversary DVD (though some features are now exclusive to the Blu-Ray). For collectors, please note that the new edition does not include two episodes from The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series.Among the new bonus features is a collection of very short vignettes called ""The Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,"" basically edited scenes from the ""Pooh"" shorts and The Tigger Movie.What's interesting is that these mini segments are narrated by John Cleese, who also added his unique narration to the recent Winnie the Pooh feature. The voices of Sterling Holloway and Paul Winchell are replaced here by Jim Cummings, so it's interesting to consider the similarities and occasional differences between the performances.",4,"""The Tigger Movie's"" a wonderful thing",1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2529,"['Even', 'was', 'produced', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Television', 'Animation', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'one', 'handful', 'direct-to-home-video', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'had', 'respectable', 'run', 'theaters', 'also', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'original', 'songs', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Sherman', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Sherman.And', 'find', 'songs', 'are', 'favorite', 'Round', 'My', 'Family', 'Tree', 'chock', 'full', 'clever', 'lines', 'visual', 'in-jokes', 'including', 'reference', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Jackson', '5ive', 'end', 'introduced', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Lead', 'Home', 'now', 'become', 'easy', 'listening', 'standard', 'co-written', 'sung', 'Kenny', 'Loggins.It', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'Sherman', 'song', 'Wonderful', 'Thing', 'Tiggers', 'sung', 'completion', 'onscreen', 'earlier', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'Disney', 'original', 'Tigger', 'voice', 'sang', 'four', 'lines', 'song', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'current', 'Tigger', 'entire', 'song', 'Historically', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Edwards', 'sang', 'whole', 'song', 'first', 'Disneyland', 'records', 'instead', 'films.The', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'nice', 'companion', 'original', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'compilation', 'film', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'as', 'well', 'recent', 'theatrical', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'storyline', 'simple', 'Milne', 'style', 'meanders', 'purpose', 'world', 'Pooh', 'friends', 'simple', 'direct', 'free', 'extraneous', 'spectacle.My', 'only', 'issue', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'success', 'arguably', 'thanks', 'Shermans', 'did', 'not', 'result', 'being', 'involved', 'follow-up', 'Piglet', 'Big', 'Movie', 'Instead', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'handled', 'music', 'brothers', 'fine', 'somehow', 'not', 'same.The', 'new', 'Bounce-a', 'rrriffic', 'special', 'edition', 'most', 'notable', 'how', 'great', 'Blu-ray', 'same', 'features', '10th', 'anniversary', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'now', 'exclusive', 'Blu-Ray', 'collectors', 'please', 'note', 'new', 'edition', 'not', 'include', 'two', 'episodes', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'TV', 'series.Among', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'collection', 'very', 'short', 'vignettes', 'called', 'Mini', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'basically', 'edited', 'scenes', 'Pooh', 'shorts', 'Tigger', 'Movie.What', 'interesting', 'mini', 'segments', 'are', 'narrated', 'John', 'Cleese', 'who', 'also', 'added', 'unique', 'narration', 'recent', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'feature', 'voices', 'Sterling', 'Holloway', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'are', 'replaced', 'here', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'interesting', 'consider', 'similarities', 'occasional', 'differences', 'performances']",N/A

In both of those, the characters are just being yanked and shoved through the motions by a giant, souless marketing machine that is determined to squeeze yet more cash out of them, even if it has to kill them in the process.This ""Tigger Movie"" is different though.  Again and again I found that it moved me to tears, and the story, animation and writing all hit home, almost like they were created by people who actually cared deeply about what they were doing.

Determined to track down ""someone like me,"" the irrepressible stuffed tiger has several adventures. He eventually learns that family members come in all shapes and sizes, and not necessarily from the same family tree.Compared to most Disney sequels ""The Tigger Movie"" has a lot to offer. It's sweet, with absolutely no hostility, and no more violence than a few bee stings. The animation is surprisingly good -- a hallucinatory revue of history's greatest Tiggers in references toThe Brady Bunch, the ""Jackson 5ive"" Saturday morning cartoon series, Jerry Springer,The Seven Year Itch,even 1930sGold Diggersfilms -- while backgrounds often retain the soft watercolor look of the classicMany Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.For the most part Tigger's sunny enthusiasm is on full display, as are his absoposilutely twisted takes on the English language. All the other classic Pooh characters appear too, including Winnie the Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga, Roo, even Christopher Robin.The voice talent is good, though the only voice from the original film is John Fiedler as Piglet. Both Tigger (originally Paul Winchell) and Pooh (originally Sterling Holloway) are voiced by Jim Cummings, recognizable to Playhouse Disney fans as the voice of Pete on the series ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse."" The narrator (originally Sebastian Cabot) is voiced here by John Hurt, who portrays Mr. Ollivander in the Harry Potter films as well as Professor Oxley in 2008'sIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.In short, ""The Tigger Movie"" is the best of Disney's Pooh sequels. Preschoolers will especially love it, and though the oddball story line has some obvious plot holes (stuffed animals have birth parents?), parents can sit through at least one viewing with relative ease.P.S. Want another good Pooh sequel? Check outPooh's Heffalump Movie.P.P.S. Fans of Walt Disney World will want to watch that Tigger revue closely.

It makes me feel nostalgic and closer to them at the same time because it bridges the gap in our generations when we share something in our childhoods. It makes me feel like a kid again in a way that today's new cartoons don't.Winnie the Pooh is a long loved classic and his popularity has not faded throughout the years.  Even in stores that don't typically sell character clothing you can usually find an exception with Pooh!  He is an American staple and since he's already stood the test of time, will probably be around for future generations.  That is why the much anticipated Tigger movie was bound to be a hit in my home and across the country!I love that the format for Pooh movies has not changed. It's narrated like a storybook and you get to dive into the story.  The graphics have also remained the same.  It looks just as I remember it.  I love that even with all they can do in movies today technologically; Pooh hasn't been altered as a true classic shouldn't!While Pooh has always been the main star, Tigger gets his shot in the spotlight and as he states at the beginning, it's about time!! Tigger is a happy go lucky Tiger who loves nothing more than to bounce on his tail all day in the hundred acre woods with his friends.  He tries to get his them to bounce with him one day but they are all too busy.  While feeling slighted by his friends, a visit with Owl makes him realize that he doesn't have a family.  He goes in search of them, leaving his friends behind.When Tigger's friends grow worried, they go to look for him.  Just like a family, when one of their own is missing they all come together!  Tigger's search is fruitless and just when he sinks into the depths of despair, his friends arrive!  Herealizes that THEY are his family and have been all along.  He has been looking for something that was right in front of him.As usual, a great story with a beautiful moral for kids to learn.

The movie starts off with Tigger bouncing around the Hundred-Acre-Woods and in doing so bothers some of his friends with his bouncing. When Tigger bounces off a rock, the rock lands on Eeyore's home and smashes it. Rabbit has come up with a plan to fix Eeyore's home. Tigger show up and does his Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce. Tigger had good intentions, but his Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce send everybody into a mud pit and they wind up getting covered in mud. This gets everyone upset saying the reason they don't with Tigger is because they are not tiggers. Tigger leaves his friends felling a little down on himself and Roo find Tigger and tries to cheer him up. Roo asks Tigger does he has any family Tigger is awestruck that there might be other Tiggers out there and Tigger and Roo head over to Owl's home for help to find his family. Owl talks about his family tree and Tigger start immediately looking for a tree with Tiggers to it. When Roo and Tigger do not find the tree the two of them head back to Tigger's home and Roo suggest that Tigger write a letter to his family. After waiting for a long period of time, Tigger gives up that there are other tiggers out there.Roo, feeling sorry for Tigger, gets Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Eeyore, and Winnie-the-Pooh together to write a letter to Tigger to cheer him up. Tigger finds the letter the next day in his mailbox and is excited about the letter and wakes everybody up about his letter. Tiggers tells everyone that his family is coming to visit him. The gang is shocked because no one put that in the letter. Owl asks Tigger about the letter and Tigger tells him you have to read between the lines. Tigger sets off to his house to get ready for a family reunion. One by one the gang tries to tell Tigger that there is no family reunion, but just don't have the heart to do it. Roo comes up with an idea to disguise themselves as others tiggers. The plan starts off perfectly, but when Roo decides to do the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce his mask comes off and Tigger believes that the gang thinks that Kanga, Roo, Owl, Piglet, Eeyore, and Winnie-the-Pooh are all trying to make him look like a fool. Tigger leaves his him vowing not to return and goes out looking for his family in the middle of a snow storm. Roo is upset and goes over to Pooh's house and Winnie-the-Pooh suggests that an expedition and goes to Rabbit's house to lead the expedition. Rabbit leads the expedition with Roo, Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore to assist in finding Tigger. The group finds Tigger and during the middle of the conversation Tigger causes an avalanche with his shouting. Tigger is able to get all his friends in a tall tree, but is unable to save himself. Roo uses the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce to go after Tigger and the two uses the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce to rescue them from the fall. In the end Tigger realizes that the residents of the Hundred-Acre-Woods are his family. Overall I did enjoy the with the exception of the rescue part. I just thought the movie could had have a better ending to it. The Tigger Movie gets a B+.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionsSet UpBonus Material1. Tigger Movie Trivia Game2.

The rabbit suggests finding other tigers to share his childish pleasures. And that's how Tigger begins the search of his family.Even without being fans of the tales of A.A. Milne, creator of Winnie the Pooh, children and adults will enjoy this lovely movie. The story is simple and easy to follow, the visual content is attractive and even it didn't use the flashy animation of movies like Finding Nemo or The Incredibles, it stays true to the original drawings, forming at atmosphere of childhood nostalgia rather uncommon in the present animated featuresIn its own terms, this adventures mixes humor, emotion and honest feeling to teach us that, in Tigger's case, family are Piglet, Pooh, Eyeore, Christopher Robin, Roo and Owl.

483456,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6305942285,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 4]","A new opening takes us into the storybook where Pooh and his friends live, deep within the Hundred Acre Wood. Here, we find the usual gang, with the exception of Gopher (Why is it that in every Pooh movie after The Many Adventures, someone always has to be left out? Oh well, he's not in the book...), all voiced exceptionally well and mostly drawn with the original charm. Tigger is bouncing around, as usual, singing a longer version of his wonderful theme song, and the story begins.To sum it up, Tigger, who has always found pride in being ""the only one,"" is starting to feel some of the effects of being an endangered species. As far as he can see, there's no one in the 100 Acre Woods who shares his interests, which are mainly bouncing. All the while, Roo is constantly trying to show Tigger that HE is every bit as bouncy, but Tigger is soon obsessed with the idea of finding his tigger family. He searches through his treehouse, but finds nothing more than an empty locket. Roo suggests Tigger write a letter to his family, and when he does, Roo, Owl, Pooh, Eeyore, and Kanga write him a reply, signing it, ""Your Family."" Rabbit is too busy preparing for winter to get involved. But the plan to cheer Tigger up backfires immediately. When Tigger recieves his reply, he is suddenly convinced that his family is coming for a visit!Well, any more info would spoil the movie for you. Let's just say that it is a wonderful film in the spirit of the original Pooh movie. The only part that might not fit is a decidedly flashy and modern sequence where Tigger describes how his family might be. We see Tiggers in the roles of people such as Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Springer. True, that one scene is a bit odd to see in a Pooh movie, but this is in fact ""The TIGGER Movie,"" and Tigger himself IS a bit odd. Anyway, this sequence is soooo entertaining that I wouldn't think of suggesting that it be left out of the film! The music in ""The Tigger Movie"" was written by the legendary Sherman Brothers, so, of course, it is perfect. When I first saw this film, I was a bit uncomfortable with the modern sound of one of the songs as it played in the credits, but it is a beautiful song nonetheless, even if it was sort of reminiscent of some ""Savannah Smiles"" seventies type music. It really grows on you. By the way, for anyone who has said otherwise, this animation did NOT look like television quality! It was much better than that! Sure, it was less high tech than the usual stuff we see nowadays, but thank goodness in a Pooh movie! The story was handled very well, and the classic characters were honored far better than in ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: the Search for Christopher Robin."" That one wasn't horrible, but it shows how much better and more worthy of the big screen ""The Tigger Movie"" is. This film definitely belongs in everyone's DVD collection, and there are some nice extras on the DVD too. There are two games, the Kenny Loggins music video for the movie, and some other nice items. Nothing as overwhelming as the extras on the ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" DVD, but still nice. If you are a fan of Tigger or Pooh, pick up this movie! One of my favorite parts is when Pooh lulls the bees to sleep! Ha ha! Any Pooh movie is a great hot cocoa on a cold evening experience, especially if you have someone to cuddle with, and ""The Tigger Movie"" is no exception!",5,Tiggerific!,968803200,"09 13, 2000",2000,3383,"['new', 'opening', 'storybook', 'where', 'Pooh', 'friends', 'live', 'deep', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'Here', 'find', 'usual', 'gang', 'exception', 'Gopher', 'Why', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'someone', 'always', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'Oh', 'well', 'not', 'book', 'voiced', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'mostly', 'drawn', 'original', 'charm', 'Tigger', 'bouncing', 'around', 'usual', 'singing', 'longer', 'version', 'wonderful', 'theme', 'song', 'story', 'begins.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Tigger', 'who', 'always', 'found', 'pride', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'starting', 'feel', 'effects', 'being', 'endangered', 'species', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'one', '100', 'Acre', 'Woods', 'who', 'shares', 'interests', 'are', 'mainly', 'bouncing', 'while', 'Roo', 'constantly', 'trying', 'show', 'Tigger', 'HE', 'bit', 'bouncy', 'Tigger', 'soon', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'finding', 'tigger', 'family', 'treehouse', 'nothing', 'more', 'empty', 'locket', 'Roo', 'Tigger', 'write', 'letter', 'family', 'when', 'Roo', 'Owl', 'Pooh', 'Eeyore', 'Kanga', 'write', 'reply', 'signing', 'Family', 'Rabbit', 'too', 'busy', 'preparing', 'winter', 'get', 'involved', 'plan', 'cheer', 'Tigger', 'up', 'backfires', 'immediately', 'When', 'Tigger', 'reply', 'suddenly', 'convinced', 'family', 'coming', 'visit', 'Well', 'more', 'info', 'would', 'spoil', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'wonderful', 'film', 'spirit', 'original', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'only', 'part', 'might', 'not', 'fit', 'decidedly', 'flashy', 'modern', 'sequence', 'where', 'Tigger', 'how', 'family', 'might', 'be', 'see', 'Tiggers', 'roles', 'people', 'such', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'True', 'one', 'scene', 'bit', 'odd', 'see', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'fact', 'TIGGER', 'Movie', 'Tigger', 'bit', 'odd', 'Anyway', 'sequence', 'soooo', 'entertaining', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'suggesting', 'be', 'left', 'film', 'music', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'was', 'written', 'legendary', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'so', 'course', 'perfect', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'modern', 'sound', 'one', 'songs', 'played', 'credits', 'beautiful', 'song', 'nonetheless', 'even', 'was', 'sort', 'reminiscent', 'Savannah', 'Smiles', 'seventies', 'type', 'music', 'really', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'said', 'otherwise', 'animation', 'did', 'NOT', 'look', 'television', 'quality', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Sure', 'was', 'less', 'high', 'tech', 'usual', 'stuff', 'see', 'nowadays', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'classic', 'characters', 'were', 'honored', 'far', 'better', 'Pooh', 'Grand', 'Adventure', 'Search', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'worthy', 'big', 'screen', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'film', 'definitely', 'everyone', 'DVD', 'collection', 'are', 'nice', 'extras', 'DVD', 'too', 'are', 'two', 'games', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'other', 'nice', 'items', 'Nothing', 'as', 'overwhelming', 'extras', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'DVD', 'still', 'nice', 'are', 'fan', 'Tigger', 'Pooh', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'when', 'Pooh', 'bees', 'sleep', 'Ha', 'ha', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'great', 'hot', 'cocoa', 'cold', 'evening', 'experience', 'especially', 'have', 'someone', 'cuddle', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'exception']",N/A

The 12-minute ""King of the Beasties"" and 11-minute ""Tigger's Houseguest"" lacked the show's most memorable aspect (the theme tune and title sequence montage), but were still charming inclusions whose absence is felt.

483464,A1BRXLFWILNICE,6305942285,Robin McDonald,"[2, 5]","The Tigger movie is good harmless family fun. Something felt a little out of place in this little story though. I think my feelings can best be expressed by these two verses from Kenny Loggins song House on Pooh Corner.christopher robin and i walked along as the branches lit up by the moonposing our questions to owl and eyore as our days disappeared all too soonbut i wandered much farther today than i should and i can't seem to find my way back to the woodsso help me if you can i've got to get back to the house at pooh corner by oneyou'd be surprised there's so much to be donecount all the bees in the hivechase all the clouds from the skyback to the days of christopher robin and poohThis is a tough review for me to write as I don't want to offend the people who liked this film. While I think it was a good story, I think it forgot its place. I would love to say The Tigger Movie is full of rouncy trouncy pouncy fun fun fun fun fun. But in spite of all the smiles on the cover. I was a little surprised to see Tigger spending most of the film in a blue funk and wrestling with some heavy duty family issues.Tigger being a little too much fun for the others is advised to go find someone who likes to bounce.  Tigger goes out looking for someone like himself.  Gone for days, Tigger returns disappointed. Hearing about how everyone has a ""family tree"" Tigger takes it literally and writes a letter addressed to his tree. Noticing how profoundly disturbed Tigger was getting waiting for a response, Roo gets everyone in on writing Tigger a phony letter from his family.  The letter snaps Tigger out of  his anxious state and begins planning a huge party.  Tigger is totally invested in his excitement of having his bouncy family there. Uh oh, bigger trouble. The only way to maintain the illusion is for his friends to dress in Tigger outfits. The outfits are cute but one falls off and Tigger freaks out. He becomes very upset at having been betrayed and having his illusions dashed. Tigger now refuses to accept that he doesn't have a family goes of on a quixotic quest to find his family tree. Eventually he is overwhelmed by a terrible blizzard, but spots a barren tree he thinks must be his. Of course it is not really a tigger tree but Tigger convinces himself they must be on vacation and sits alone in the cold, warming himself with his delusion. Meanwhile everyone in the 100 acre woods are concerned about Tigger being out in the storm. Bravely they hunt him down and plead for him to come down from the tree. Clinging to the false hope of a returning tigger family and still angry and embittered he shouts &quot;NOOOOOO!&quot; with such force that he creates a snow avalanche. This disaster snaps him out of his delusion and eventually Tigger realizes that its really his friends who are his family and having a real family is not so important.  Tigger fortunately becomes his old self again.  But while watching  the film I was saying to myself...""Wow, Tigger is having some real heavy duty psychological issues.""  Tigger is struggling with the idea of not being accepted for who he is, family abandonment, and has became obsessively delusional because he is unable to cope."" For me it was a strange choice to have a character in a Pooh story to be spend 90 minutes trying to fill a psychological void in his personality. What a departure from the simple Tigger who only loved to bounce and tell the world how unique he was.  I was not sure I wanted to see a Tigger who can become brooding and enraged and I would rather remember him as the simple joyful expression he was.  Everything about the world of Pooh is uncomplicated. And in the world of cartoons, Poohs gentle emotional simplicity made it unique. I think children will (and do) find the movie entertaining. Yet I wonder if we ever will be able to find our way back to the 100 acre woods where the biggest problems were helping Eeyore find his tail, or watching Pooh struggling to remove his nose from a Hunny jar.",3,A good story....but is it Pooh?,996192000,"07 27, 2001",2001,3995,"['Tigger', 'movie', 'good', 'harmless', 'family', 'fun', 'Something', 'felt', 'little', 'place', 'little', 'story', 'think', 'feelings', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'expressed', 'two', 'verses', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'song', 'House', 'Pooh', 'Corner.christopher', 'robin', 'i', 'walked', 'along', 'branches', 'lit', 'up', 'moonposing', 'questions', 'owl', 'eyore', 'days', 'disappeared', 'too', 'soonbut', 'i', 'wandered', 'much', 'farther', 'today', 'i', 'should', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'woodsso', 'help', 'can', 'i', ""'ve"", 'got', 'get', 'back', 'house', 'pooh', 'corner', 'oneyou', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'donecount', 'bees', 'hivechase', 'clouds', 'skyback', 'days', 'christopher', 'robin', 'poohThis', 'tough', 'review', 'write', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'think', 'forgot', 'place', 'would', 'love', 'say', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'full', 'rouncy', 'trouncy', 'pouncy', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'spite', 'smiles', 'cover', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'see', 'Tigger', 'spending', 'most', 'film', 'blue', 'funk', 'wrestling', 'heavy', 'duty', 'family', 'issues.Tigger', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'others', 'advised', 'go', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'bounce', 'Tigger', 'out', 'looking', 'someone', 'Gone', 'days', 'Tigger', 'disappointed', 'Hearing', 'how', 'everyone', 'family', 'tree', 'Tigger', 'literally', 'letter', 'addressed', 'tree', 'Noticing', 'how', 'profoundly', 'disturbed', 'Tigger', 'was', 'getting', 'waiting', 'response', 'Roo', 'everyone', 'writing', 'Tigger', 'phony', 'letter', 'family', 'letter', 'Tigger', 'anxious', 'state', 'planning', 'huge', 'party', 'Tigger', 'totally', 'invested', 'excitement', 'having', 'bouncy', 'family', 'there', 'Uh', 'oh', 'bigger', 'trouble', 'only', 'way', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'friends', 'dress', 'Tigger', 'outfits', 'outfits', 'are', 'cute', 'one', 'Tigger', 'out', 'very', 'upset', 'having', 'been', 'betrayed', 'having', 'illusions', 'dashed', 'Tigger', 'now', 'accept', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'quixotic', 'quest', 'find', 'family', 'tree', 'Eventually', 'overwhelmed', 'terrible', 'blizzard', 'barren', 'tree', 'must', 'be', 'course', 'not', 'really', 'tigger', 'tree', 'Tigger', 'must', 'be', 'vacation', 'alone', 'cold', 'warming', 'delusion', 'Meanwhile', 'everyone', '100', 'acre', 'woods', 'are', 'concerned', 'Tigger', 'being', 'out', 'storm', 'Bravely', 'hunt', 'down', 'plead', 'come', 'down', 'tree', 'Clinging', 'false', 'hope', 'returning', 'tigger', 'family', 'still', 'angry', 'embittered', 'quot', 'NOOOOOO', 'quot', 'such', 'force', 'snow', 'avalanche', 'disaster', 'delusion', 'eventually', 'Tigger', 'really', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'family', 'having', 'real', 'family', 'not', 'so', 'important', 'Tigger', 'fortunately', 'old', 'self', 'again', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'saying', 'Wow', 'Tigger', 'having', 'real', 'heavy', 'duty', 'psychological', 'issues', 'Tigger', 'struggling', 'idea', 'not', 'being', 'accepted', 'who', 'family', 'abandonment', 'became', 'obsessively', 'delusional', 'unable', 'cope', 'was', 'strange', 'choice', 'have', 'character', 'Pooh', 'story', 'be', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'trying', 'fill', 'psychological', 'void', 'personality', 'What', 'departure', 'simple', 'Tigger', 'who', 'only', 'loved', 'bounce', 'tell', 'world', 'how', 'unique', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'Tigger', 'who', 'can', 'become', 'brooding', 'enraged', 'would', 'rather', 'remember', 'simple', 'joyful', 'expression', 'was', 'Everything', 'world', 'Pooh', 'uncomplicated', 'world', 'cartoons', 'Poohs', 'gentle', 'emotional', 'simplicity', 'made', 'unique', 'think', 'children', 'will', 'do', 'find', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'wonder', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'back', '100', 'acre', 'woods', 'where', 'biggest', 'problems', 'were', 'helping', 'Eeyore', 'find', 'tail', 'watching', 'Pooh', 'struggling', 'remove', 'nose', 'Hunny', 'jar']",N/A
