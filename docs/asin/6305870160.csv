481465,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,6305870160,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[6, 8]","Our whole family enjoyed this light film that deals with the real pain of loss in a family, while simultaneously raising - possibly for the first time for children - the question of: what does it mean to be human?The first thing I had to tell my children when we were watching this together is ""this is just silly....this isn't real, it is just a story, but let's try to find out what the story is trying to say..."" The plot follows the adventures of sad and self-isolating Casey (Lindsay Lohan) a few years after her mother's death (never explained, only a ""check up"" and then a swift decline is alluded to)who attempts to resurrect her mother, but instead brings an unwanted doll named Eve (Tyra Banks) to life. Eve is delighted to encounter use of her skin and senses but eventually realizes through a series of painfully obvious failures that she is not the perfect role model her manufacturers have created a fantasy of. Casey despises Eve and has eliminated any chance of bringing her mother back to life. But as Eve grows from her failures, she and Casey develop a dialogue about the human condition that paradoxically helps them both to ""let go and grow."" Casey's father (Jere Burns) has buried his grief in ambition at his workplace, where he hopes to be made partner, neglecting Casey. But again, Eve's presence forces him to make emotional choices and he begins to reconnect with his daughter.The most mature theme - correctly in context for children - is the paradox of the pain, stress and disappointments of  life, that simultaneously helps us to grow.Jere Burns is correctly cast as a modern, hip, ambitious Dad, and successfully carries off the mixture of trying to encourage his daughter to accept her loss of her Mother, hile also obviously suppressing his own unresolved feelings on the episode as well.Tyra Banks gives a stunning performance as a doll come to life (and life size) who exhibits the false confidence of the Dunning-Kruger Effect while meanwhile stumbling through real human tasks like a ditzy ""blonde"" cubed. I was very impressed by Ms. Banks performance, for she several times executes very well, and believably, what a doll might think of an ordinary human activity with a vague sense of comprehension, and fear of the unknown.In her pre-wild child days Lindsey Lohan's appeal was obviously limited to the freckled red head tom boy stereotype so familiar in so many Disney films. Here she does a credible job.Let me close with a full-disclosure and a discussion about one of the more troubling aspects of the film: Casey's use of witchcraft to resurrect her mother (instead bringing Eve to life). Disney films have ""magic"" in them frequently, scaling from cartoonish (Fantasia) to diabolical (Snow White). On that scale of order of one to ten to me this scores a six, but it is a bit difficult to see in a live action film.We are a pious traditionalist Catholic family, and recognize that such a plot device could cause rejection of the film by fellow Catholics and observant pious Protestants alike. Based on my limited knowledge of ""occult"" practices Casey's ""altar"" and symbols and collection of significant objects, and spell casting book are all at a level of believability higher than the obvious cartoonishness of Disneyland's ""Haunted Mansion."" For me, for a light comedy, this was unnecessary. Yet, my children took little interest in this dimension of the plot, and in our discussion of the film afterwards both said it was ""silly"" and knew that it was just a made-up device to get the doll to ""real life"" so the story could be told.My conclusion: it is all-in-all harmless, it was unnecessarily ""real,"" but parents who actively discuss with their children about what it is they see should have no problem guiding them past this plot point. For those parents who just plop their kids in front of the tube and absorb whatever...well...there has probably already been too much damage already done for this to even register.",4,"enjoyable, but Catholics and christians should be a bit cautious",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,3968,"['whole', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'light', 'film', 'deals', 'real', 'pain', 'loss', 'family', 'simultaneously', 'raising', 'possibly', 'first', 'time', 'children', 'question', 'what', 'mean', 'be', 'human', 'first', 'thing', 'had', 'tell', 'children', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'together', 'just', 'silly', '.this', ""n't"", 'real', 'just', 'story', 'let', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'trying', 'say', 'plot', 'adventures', 'sad', 'self-isolating', 'Casey', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'few', 'years', 'mother', 'death', 'never', 'explained', 'only', 'check', 'up', 'then', 'swift', 'decline', 'alluded', 'who', 'attempts', 'resurrect', 'mother', 'instead', 'unwanted', 'doll', 'named', 'Eve', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'life', 'Eve', 'delighted', 'encounter', 'use', 'skin', 'senses', 'eventually', 'series', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'failures', 'not', 'perfect', 'role', 'model', 'manufacturers', 'have', 'created', 'fantasy', 'Casey', 'Eve', 'eliminated', 'chance', 'bringing', 'mother', 'back', 'life', 'Eve', 'failures', 'Casey', 'develop', 'dialogue', 'human', 'condition', 'paradoxically', 'let', 'go', 'grow', 'Casey', 'father', 'Jere', 'Burns', 'buried', 'grief', 'ambition', 'workplace', 'where', 'be', 'made', 'partner', 'neglecting', 'Casey', 'again', 'Eve', 'presence', 'make', 'emotional', 'choices', 'reconnect', 'daughter.The', 'most', 'mature', 'theme', 'correctly', 'context', 'children', 'paradox', 'pain', 'stress', 'disappointments', 'life', 'simultaneously', 'grow.Jere', 'Burns', 'correctly', 'cast', 'modern', 'hip', 'ambitious', 'Dad', 'successfully', 'mixture', 'trying', 'encourage', 'daughter', 'accept', 'loss', 'Mother', 'hile', 'also', 'obviously', 'suppressing', 'own', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'episode', 'well.Tyra', 'Banks', 'stunning', 'performance', 'doll', 'come', 'life', 'life', 'size', 'who', 'false', 'confidence', 'Dunning-Kruger', 'Effect', 'meanwhile', 'stumbling', 'real', 'human', 'tasks', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'cubed', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Ms.', 'Banks', 'performance', 'several', 'times', 'very', 'well', 'believably', 'what', 'doll', 'might', 'think', 'ordinary', 'human', 'activity', 'vague', 'sense', 'comprehension', 'fear', 'unknown.In', 'pre-wild', 'child', 'days', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'appeal', 'was', 'obviously', 'limited', 'freckled', 'red', 'head', 'tom', 'boy', 'stereotype', 'so', 'familiar', 'so', 'many', 'Disney', 'films', 'Here', 'credible', 'job.Let', 'close', 'full-disclosure', 'discussion', 'one', 'more', 'troubling', 'aspects', 'film', 'Casey', 'use', 'witchcraft', 'resurrect', 'mother', 'instead', 'bringing', 'Eve', 'life', 'Disney', 'films', 'have', 'magic', 'frequently', 'scaling', 'cartoonish', 'Fantasia', 'diabolical', 'Snow', 'White', 'scale', 'order', 'one', 'ten', 'six', 'bit', 'difficult', 'see', 'live', 'action', 'film.We', 'are', 'pious', 'traditionalist', 'Catholic', 'family', 'recognize', 'plot', 'device', 'could', 'cause', 'rejection', 'film', 'fellow', 'Catholics', 'observant', 'pious', 'Protestants', 'alike', 'Based', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'occult', 'practices', 'Casey', 'altar', 'symbols', 'collection', 'significant', 'objects', 'spell', 'casting', 'book', 'are', 'level', 'believability', 'higher', 'obvious', 'cartoonishness', 'Disneyland', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'light', 'comedy', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'children', 'took', 'little', 'interest', 'dimension', 'plot', 'discussion', 'film', 'afterwards', 'said', 'was', 'silly', 'knew', 'was', 'just', 'made-up', 'device', 'get', 'doll', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'told.My', 'conclusion', 'all-in-all', 'harmless', 'was', 'unnecessarily', 'real', 'parents', 'who', 'actively', 'discuss', 'children', 'what', 'see', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'guiding', 'plot', 'point', 'parents', 'who', 'just', 'plop', 'kids', 'front', 'tube', 'absorb', 'well', 'there', 'probably', 'already', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'damage', 'already', 'done', 'even', 'register']",Life-Size VHS

481468,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,6305870160,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[3, 5]","seriouslyplease take a look at this movie, from a deeper critical analysispleasego with me on this one.sure, there are all sorts of holes in it (does she like, use the bathroom?), but so is there in any fable, mythology, fairy tale, all of which from proper analysis teach us much about life. Yeah, so, for instance, little red riding hood might not help but notice this wolf in granny's bed is REALLY NOT her grandmother, but read Bettleheim on the deeper meaning of the account. In this living doll type of myth, take a look at Pygmalion, the original and the Shavian rewrite. See Prometheus, and the Mary Shelley rewrite. Look at Golem. See Pinocchio. This movie stands very powerfully within the geneology of our myth.This unfathomably ""deep"" movie blows our superficial consumerist life style out of the water.And Tyra Banks, amazingly unmentioned on this product page, grabs and keeps the entire movie. There is nothing until she shows up, and she FILLS the screen the entire time. She IS Barbie . . .AND she is Black.listen, ok, she's like planted to do secretarial clerking in an office, and of course, being a doll who never actually learned to read and stuff, but only some platitudes like beauty contestants tell in pageants, well, in the copy room, she splits a nail, and begs, ""I broke a nail. Please don't throw me in the trash!""I am going to admit it. I was already absolutely wiped out by how deeply revelatory this movie had already become of our whole insane and superficial disposable consumerist driven society. There is not a line in all of our literature which continues to drive me bewildered to tears like this one. This says it all.I hate to admit it. This truly great movie rips the lid off our lives, and who we really are, which is the purpose of myth. Please, take a good look, really this time.See the whole office thing. Phoneys focussed on swindling, while Tyra Banks brings life and peace and understanding, while clueless.THat first shopping trip (do NOT ask who is paying) she finds all these outlandish Barbie type clothes (BELL BOTTOMS??), and admits to the Lohan character that she does not know how to dress herself.Is there a man in the house who would not help?Only cross dressers care this much about their looks, anyway.Or girls from Texas . . .But I am getting off track. I really hope you can see this movie, and think about how we live as a nation, with everybody absolutely maxed out on their credit cards with no hope of paying, but staying superficial.This movie could not have happened without Tyra Banks, the rest are disposable. This is her movie and she is a mighty force of nature, bringing her bizarre Barbie happiness and absolutely impeccable BEAUTY to our miserable world. When she sings that Eve theme song?How often since Walt Whitman have we seen anyone sing such an uplifting song of themself, one which spreads joy and hope to all listeners?Of course, I did see it in Spanish, but Tyra sold me on it, all the way.""I split a nail.

First, they gave it a poignant, very human story-line: the difficulties a man and his daughter  have in coping with the traumatic death of his wife and her mother. Second,  they cast Lindsay Lohan as the thirteen year old daughter. The ability to  bring depth to a character in a lighthearted comedy is perhaps as much or  greater a challenge than in a serious drama (check out Roddy McDowell's  performance as the butler in &quot;Overboard&quot;). Miss Lohan has  accomplished this twice in as many movie roles - or should I say three  times, considering the two subtly different personalities she carved out of  the twins in &quot;Parent Trap&quot;. In &quot;Life-size&quot; she brought  life to a doll, but more important she brought life to what could easily  have been an adolescent stereotype. The control she has over her facial  expressions is fantastic. A light roll of the eyes, a krinkle at the corner  of her mouth, a guilty grin open up little windows that bring reality to  the heart of her character. It's worth the price of the video to experience  the sparkle of Tyra Banks, the sensitivity of Jere Burns, but most of all  to witness another example of Lindsay Lohan's masterful acting talent.
