It's great.  Now, a website called ""Dress Circle"" (out of the UK) plans to release this on DVD (all regions) on 02/21/2011.  I do not know if it's the hour version that was once released on VHS or if the entire concert has been restored to the DVD.  Unfortunately, they don't give a track listing.Here are the tracks from the album released at the time:How Long Has This Been Going On / It's a MiracleMy Ship / The Man I LoveSome PeopleCome In From the RainLondon TownNew York MedleySomeone to Watch Over Me / 12 FellasYou and I / The Honeymoon is Over / Happy AnniversaryCity LightsCabaretShine On Harvest MoonBut the World Goes Round / Bows",5,Coming soon to DVD,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,773,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'tape', 'have', 'Liza', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'was', 'recorded', '1979', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'tour', 'great', 'Now', 'website', 'called', 'Dress', 'Circle', 'UK', 'release', 'DVD', 'regions', '02/21/2011', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'hour', 'version', 'was', 'once', 'released', 'VHS', 'entire', 'concert', 'been', 'restored', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'track', 'are', 'tracks', 'album', 'released', 'time', 'How', 'Long', 'Been', 'Going', 'MiracleMy', 'Ship', '/', 'Man', 'LoveSome', 'PeopleCome', 'From', 'RainLondon', 'TownNew', 'York', 'MedleySomeone', 'Watch', 'Me', '/', '12', 'FellasYou', '/', 'Honeymoon', 'Over', '/', 'Happy', 'AnniversaryCity', 'LightsCabaretShine', 'Harvest', 'MoonBut', 'World', 'Goes', 'Round', '/', 'Bows']",An Evening with Liza Minnelli
797477,AP8O5BQ0ATW0I,B0001ACUP2,D. Lucas,"[1, 1]","this was an outstanding concert caught on film and I agree with the previous post, one of the best liza ever did. If you had the great thrill of seeing her in concert back in the 70's or 80's this is definitive. I also agree that the vhs out there now is incomplete and missing a number of great moments including shine on harvest moon (which brought the house down in boston) and a few others. There really should be a restored, full-length dvd for this show. it was spectacular!!",5,classic concert,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,481,"['was', 'outstanding', 'concert', 'caught', 'film', 'agree', 'previous', 'post', 'one', 'best', 'liza', 'ever', 'did', 'had', 'great', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'concert', 'back', '70', '80', 'definitive', 'also', 'agree', 'vhs', 'there', 'now', 'incomplete', 'missing', 'number', 'great', 'moments', 'including', 'shine', 'harvest', 'moon', 'brought', 'house', 'down', 'boston', 'few', 'others', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'restored', 'full-length', 'dvd', 'show', 'was', 'spectacular']",An Evening with Liza Minnelli
797478,A1O1P7EE4RKUJ1,B0001ACUP2,"Old Legend Lover ""meskb""","[5, 5]","It was wonderful when the 1972 TV special ""Liza With a Z"" was so beautifully restored and converted to DVD ... yes, Liza was at her prime then, having just won the Oscar for ""Cabaret"" ... but in all honesty, THIS is the video taped concert that is the best of the best.  Hopefully it will also be updated and appear on DVD...and HOPEFULLY with those missing numbers, which were so tremendous, retrieved and included.Liza Minnelli was truly at the Top of the Heap these nine years after ""Z"" had been televised.  Those years had brought her just enough more vocal power, more confidence, more ""learning experiences"" to add a luster to both her acting and singing abilities that has never been matched by any other entertainer to this day.Her ""Come in from the Rain"" will break your heart and bring tears to your eyes just as it did her own on that New Orleans stage.  This video contains the best version of ""But the World Goes 'Round"" ever recorded, just shaking the rafters...and you will have to start laughing watching what the Legend does with ""Arthur in the Afternoon.""  ""An Evening With Liza Minnelli"" also contains her definitive versions of ""City Lights"" and ""Cabaret,"" not to mention the concert opener ""Blue Skies.""If you know Someone who knows Someone who knows Someone, please urge them to convey the message that this masterpiece deserves to be, should be, must be restored and converted to DVD...ASAP!  But in the meantime, I notice there are only 3 or 4 used copies of this VHS tape left here on Amazon as I write...and they are extremely expensive...but if you can possibly afford one, don't let a classic like this slip away from you.",5,The Best of The Best,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,1650,"['was', 'wonderful', 'when', '1972', 'TV', 'special', 'Liza', 'Z', 'was', 'so', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'converted', 'DVD', 'yes', 'Liza', 'was', 'prime', 'then', 'having', 'just', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Cabaret', 'honesty', 'THIS', 'video', 'taped', 'concert', 'best', 'best', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'updated', 'appear', 'DVD', 'HOPEFULLY', 'missing', 'numbers', 'were', 'so', 'tremendous', 'retrieved', 'included.Liza', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'truly', 'Top', 'Heap', 'nine', 'years', 'Z', 'had', 'been', 'televised', 'years', 'had', 'brought', 'just', 'enough', 'more', 'vocal', 'power', 'more', 'confidence', 'more', 'learning', 'experiences', 'add', 'luster', 'acting', 'singing', 'abilities', 'never', 'been', 'matched', 'other', 'entertainer', 'day.Her', 'Come', 'Rain', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'just', 'did', 'own', 'New', 'Orleans', 'stage', 'video', 'best', 'version', 'World', 'Goes', 'ever', 'recorded', 'just', 'shaking', 'rafters', 'will', 'have', 'start', 'laughing', 'watching', 'what', 'Legend', 'Arthur', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'also', 'definitive', 'versions', 'City', 'Lights', 'Cabaret', 'not', 'mention', 'concert', 'opener', 'Blue', 'Skies', 'know', 'Someone', 'who', 'Someone', 'who', 'Someone', 'please', 'urge', 'convey', 'message', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'be', 'restored', 'converted', 'DVD', 'ASAP', 'meantime', 'notice', 'are', 'only', '3', '4', 'used', 'copies', 'VHS', 'tape', 'left', 'here', 'Amazon', 'write', 'are', 'extremely', 'expensive', 'can', 'possibly', 'afford', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'classic', 'slip', 'away']",An Evening with Liza Minnelli
797479,A2HAS67S45GXDN,B0001ACUP2,Shellie,"[2, 2]","This show was done in 1981 on HBO I believe, and I think it was one of her best.  I don't think VCRs even existed back then and if they did they were just coming out.  I was so blown away by the show though that I taped the music on a cassette and played it until it was worn out.  I've been looking for this for quite awhile and finally found one I could afford.  It's just as good as I recall, but be warned that part of the original show has been edited out making this video just under one hour long.  I love the song ""City Lights"", but the lead-in to it which is what makes it as entertaining as it is has been cut out as has the song ""Mr. Cellophane"" which was done by one of the young men who shared the stage with her for this show.  I would love to see this released on DVD in its complete and uncut version.",5,Please release an uncut version on DVD,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,817,"['show', 'was', 'done', '1981', 'HBO', 'believe', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'VCRs', 'even', 'existed', 'back', 'then', 'did', 'were', 'just', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'show', 'taped', 'music', 'cassette', 'played', 'was', 'worn', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'quite', 'awhile', 'finally', 'found', 'one', 'could', 'afford', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'recall', 'be', 'warned', 'part', 'original', 'show', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'making', 'video', 'just', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'love', 'song', 'City', 'Lights', 'lead-in', 'what', 'as', 'entertaining', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'song', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'was', 'done', 'one', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'shared', 'stage', 'show', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'complete', 'uncut', 'version']",An Evening with Liza Minnelli

So, I had someone transfer the VHS to DVD and it worked. A clear copy of her earlier performances. I hope she will have someone redo it, as she is shown as the owner of the program. Fred Ebb wrote her songs and Halston did her wardrobe. The sparkly dress was also worn in the Detroit Concert with Sammy Davis, Jr., and Frank Sinatra. All her concerts are collectibles, but not always put on DVD by the best persons to do the work. They should be on Blu Ray.
