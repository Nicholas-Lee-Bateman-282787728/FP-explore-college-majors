574830,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000059TGG,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[7, 10]","This is a decent movie about athletes whom you normally don't hear too much about:  minor league hockey players.  It centers around a young player (played by Rob Lowe) who is a wonderfully skilled finesse player, but he's also physically weak & unable to fight.  In short, he is a Wayne Gretzky type of player.  He just started in the minors & wants to go pro.  Question:  how will he deal with the goon side of hockey?The movie is nostalgic as both Lowe and Patrick Swayze are so very young.  Lowe is not much more than a teenager and this is one of Swayze's earliest films too.  A young Keannu Reeves has a bit part as the goalie.  Of course, with him nothing is really nostalgic:  he couldn't act then & he can't act now.The single biggest reason to give this DVD a viewing is Cynthia Gibb.  She is absolutely gorgeous and really gives a fairly bland plot a sexy edge.  This is also the only movie I know of where Cynthia takes her shirt off.  That by itself was worth the price of the DVD!If you like hockey movies, you may or may not like this one.  Some of the chronology seemed to be pretty screwed up.  For example:  the coach is supposed to be giving his team a pep-talk in between periods, yet most of the players have their uniforms off.  I've never played hockey myself, but am fairly certain that hockey players don't remove their uniforms in between periods.  Also, the timeline between Lowe's character leaving the team & then coming back for the last game is not believable.That said, this is a pretty good flick.  It doesn't have the ""tacked on"" ending that  I was fully expecting it to have.  It also does showcase some of the less desirable features of the life of a minor league hockey player.",4,Cynthia Gibb and hockey sticks,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,1713,"['decent', 'movie', 'athletes', 'whom', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'too', 'much', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'players', 'young', 'player', 'played', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'skilled', 'finesse', 'player', 'also', 'physically', 'weak', 'unable', 'fight', 'short', 'Wayne', 'Gretzky', 'type', 'player', 'just', 'started', 'minors', 'go', 'pro', 'Question', 'how', 'will', 'deal', 'goon', 'side', 'hockey', 'movie', 'nostalgic', 'Lowe', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'young', 'Lowe', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'teenager', 'one', 'Swayze', 'earliest', 'films', 'too', 'young', 'Keannu', 'Reeves', 'bit', 'part', 'goalie', 'course', 'nothing', 'really', 'nostalgic', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'now.The', 'single', 'biggest', 'reason', 'give', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'really', 'fairly', 'bland', 'plot', 'sexy', 'edge', 'also', 'only', 'movie', 'know', 'where', 'Cynthia', 'shirt', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'like', 'hockey', 'movies', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'chronology', 'seemed', 'be', 'pretty', 'screwed', 'up', 'example', 'coach', 'supposed', 'be', 'giving', 'team', 'pep-talk', 'periods', 'yet', 'most', 'players', 'have', 'uniforms', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'hockey', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'hockey', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'remove', 'uniforms', 'periods', 'Also', 'timeline', 'Lowe', 'character', 'leaving', 'team', 'then', 'coming', 'back', 'last', 'game', 'not', 'believable.That', 'said', 'pretty', 'good', 'flick', ""n't"", 'have', 'tacked', 'ending', 'was', 'fully', 'expecting', 'have', 'also', 'showcase', 'less', 'desirable', 'features', 'life', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'player']",N/A

However, ""Youngblood"" is one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of Rob Lowe and I surprised myself by actually enjoying it. I'm not sure if this film is meant to be a comedy or not, but I found this film to be absolutely hilarious in a so-bad-it's-funny kind of way, in particular all the scenes on the ice. This is not so much a film about people playing hockey, but a film about grown men beating each other up.

574838,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000059TGG,Sid the Elf,"[1, 3]","The title of this review should bring a smile to any B fan's face because it means that Sid the Elf is delving into the world of Youngblood. Not only is this flick top-shelf 80's B, but it also marks the first sports B for your pal, Sid the Elf. We picked this one mainly due to its On Demand availability and because it was a weekend afternoon staple on TV throughout Sid's childhood.Rob Lowe plays the lead as Dean Youngblood, an upstate New York kid who has aspirations to play pro hockey but currently works on his family's farm with his older brother(a former hockey player who was forced to quit due to a creepy and stare-inducing eye injury)and father. Youngblood gets a tryout for the Hamilton Mustangs, a junior hockey team in Canada. During the tryout, Youngblood impresses coach andDeath Huntalum, Murray Chadwick with his finesse game. But, he gets the hair mousse pounded out of him by the film's villian, Karl Racki, played by Dom Cruise. The Mustangs select Youngblood over Racki, so Lowe joins star Center Patrick Swayze and French-Canadian golie Keeanu Reeves. So, Youngblood can score goals and the coach's daughter, but he can't fight(perfect role for Rob Lowe). So, after Racki(now on another team) banks Youngblood a little and Swayze a lot, Youngblood goes back to the farm for the 80's training montage with his dad and brother teaching him how to fight in 2 days. Obviously, Youngblood returns to the team just in time for the championship game and wins it for the injured Swayze. He also fights Racki again, and of course a 150 pound Rob Lowe takes out a 210 pound Dom Cruise.This movie delivers in a big way. It is pure 80's B(right down to the disturbing gratuitous Lowe butt shot) set against a sports background, so it was right up Sid's alley. The laughs pile up high watching Rob Lowe trying to be athletic and Keeanu attempt a French Canadian accent.
