As far as LDS films go, this one is the funniest of the bunch, better than Singles Ward or RM, both of which I enjoyed. Michael B does a great job of capturing every sport-enthusiast-Mormon stereotype and pokes fun at all of the nightmare aspects of home teaching, from the last minute scheduling to the un-prepared-and-desperate spiritual thoughts. Although I've not tried entertaining my families with clogging demonstrations. Yes, the whole movie is over the top. But its hilarious because you'll see yourself or your home teacher is many of the situations. Its just good fun, folks. And I love the soundtrack, too. Can't get enough of those jazzed up and hip-ified primary tunes.",4,a fun family flick,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,734,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'other', 'guy', 'talking', 'about', 'As', 'far', 'LDS', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'funniest', 'bunch', 'better', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'RM', 'enjoyed', 'Michael', 'B', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'sport-enthusiast-Mormon', 'stereotype', 'pokes', 'fun', 'nightmare', 'aspects', 'home', 'teaching', 'last', 'minute', 'scheduling', 'un-prepared-and-desperate', 'spiritual', 'thoughts', ""'ve"", 'not', 'tried', 'entertaining', 'families', 'clogging', 'demonstrations', 'Yes', 'whole', 'movie', 'top', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'see', 'home', 'teacher', 'many', 'situations', 'just', 'good', 'fun', 'folks', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'jazzed', 'up', 'hip-ified', 'primary', 'tunes']",N/A

I normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good. This one was just overkill that was not even funny. I initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like ""nursury"" comedy if you know what I mean.

The message of the film is to find the realistic happy medium in life and Church service.

843682,A3373I4II32NA1,B0002QN0MW,Tyler,"[3, 5]","Keep in mind that this movie is a COMEDY, which is supposed to make people laugh! And I laughed my butt off from almost the point when the very first scene started and right up to the end. You got the hilarious ""big"" guy, who is just itching with anticipation for church to end so he can get to the football game on TV which is waiting for him, and trust me, who hasn't thought about hitting the couch after a boring service to watch some good sports? You have the new guy who says the closing prayer in hilariously-slow dialogue, and then the rush to get home from church, even having the teenage daughter grabbing the car out of the parking lot, even though she's too young.He's all settled to enjoy the game before hearing the announcement about having to complete his home teaching by the end of the day, which just so happens to be the end of the month. He moans and groans to try and get out of it, but then even his wife gets him out of the house to do so. You have the long drive all the way out to Vernal, then the mishaps at the funeral, the car running out of gas because his companion is too proud to ""buy gas on the Sabbath"", and that boring church tape that drones on and on for hours(just like in the Bible)about who begat who and so forth. Not quite the pick of the week to listen to on a long drive like that!!! LOL.I thought the mishap at the house with the flooding toilet and the wedding dress was hilarious. The Amazon critics on here are full of CRAP, whining about it's ""distaste"" and ""unfunny humor."" I've watched this movie 27 times, and it's humor is the reason why I wanted to watch it 27 times, then want to spend over $4 on it plus shipping so I can enjoy watching the movie a lot more times in the future. My brother, who never saw it before, watched it with me and thought it was very cool. DON'T LISTEN TO THE STUPID CRITICS! There will be critics for even the best movie ever made on Earth. This movie might not be the best ever made, but it rates among my top 10 comedy movies without a second thought. Sad how such a movie so funny could be given 3 out of 5 stars as an average, but I guess SOME people were just having a bad day, and their type shouldn't be watching comedies in the first place, but rather watching Church movies with people droning on about the same topic in that Bible tape in the movie--""begat this and that, blah, blah, etc."" Maybe a movie like that should better suit their taste, and leave the comedies to those who appreciate humor.As a professional movie reviewer, I would give this 9 OUT OF 10 STARS!
