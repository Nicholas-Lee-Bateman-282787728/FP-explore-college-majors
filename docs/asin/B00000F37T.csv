One was for theatres (the long version, with the sex scenes and some other scenes not in the short version) and one was for television (with totally different scenes involving Tina's psychatrist who is photographed from Tina's view on his couch). Both versions should be on a deluxe edition DVD. This is truly a vastly underrated film, with outstanding performances including the Oscar-nominated Carrie Snodgress (now sadly deceased) with Frank Langella, Richard Benjamin, and the rest.

497277,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00000F37T,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 3]","There aren't all that many false notes in the film DIARY OF A MAD HOUSE WIFE, but the ones that do occur are telling. When an egocentric, extemely misogynistic young writer insults a woman at a party (not the main character, although he insults HER plenty too), she responds, ""I'm going to report you to Women's Lib.""  Now, I won't say that nobody EVER used such an insipid line back then.  In fact, if it were intended as a mildly sassy bit of teasing repartee (i.e. had it been laced with a trace of irony), it might have passed as a kinda-sorta witty comeback (at least in some circles).  But the actress whose line it is gives it a whiny, petulant reading that makes it just plain silly.  It comes off as a particularly dumb and desperate attempt at social relevance.  The screenwriting and directing duo of Eleanor and Frank Perry were not always known for their subtlety, but in this case, the heavyhanded nod to an emerging social movment seems particularly unnecessary.  This movie embodied feminist concerns more successfully than any other film of its immediate era and would have even if the ""feminism"" or ""women's lib"" were never mentioned.In fact, there will be those who will find the film's unforgiving portrayals of its male characters to be similarly over-the-top, but as a previous reviewer perceptively noted, the film is one Mad Housewife's ""Diary"" and it therefore, by definition, subjective.  The fact that Richard Benjamin and Frank Langella are able to give some human dimension to their otherwise monstrous characters is a saving grace.  Had they been played strictly as written, the film (and its audience) would have suffered for it.Viewed more than 35 years after its breakthrough release, the film seems particularly prescient.  It addressed Yuppie materialism and shallowness before the term even existed.  There may have been college-aged viewers at the time of the film's 1970 release who might have thought the film was beating a dead horse, that the acquisative and careerist Jonathan Balsers of the world were a dying breed anyway and that ""come the revolution"" their ilk would be long gone.  Little did they realize that by the 1980s they themselves would be outdoing their older brothers and sisters in terms of blind ambition and downright greed.At the film's close, Jonathan and Tina Balser reflect on their early Kennedy era idealism and wonder just what went wrong.  Their more radically inclined Viet Nam era siblings were likely wondering the same thing by the mid-80s.  In fact, a double bill consisting of HOUSEWIFE and, say, WALL STREET might make for an interesting evening's entertainment.There was certainly some irony in the fact that the film's much lauded star, Carrie Snodgress, was never able to successfully follow up on this her breaktrhough role.  What happened is subject to some dispute, but by her own admission, she pretty much opted out of a bigtime Hollywood career of her own accord, took up with Neil Young (willingly becoming the ""maid"" that man needed--at least for a time), and pretty much dropped out.  She came back as a character actress in films and on TV, but once commented that the studios weren't willing to bank on her in a lead role after her return from voluntary exile, since by then she was considered too much of a flake.  Hmmm, that would seem to be exactly the same kind of condescension the men in Tina Balser's life showed toward her.If the fictional Tina Balser was punished for not being a good little wife, it seems the real-life Carrie Snodgress had to pay a price for not being a good little Hollywood actress.Plus ca change.",4,"A Man Needs A Maid--A Cook, Nanny and Trophy Wife",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,3616,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'false', 'notes', 'film', 'DIARY', 'A', 'MAD', 'HOUSE', 'WIFE', 'ones', 'do', 'occur', 'are', 'telling', 'When', 'egocentric', 'extemely', 'misogynistic', 'young', 'writer', 'insults', 'woman', 'party', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'plenty', 'too', ""'m"", 'going', 'report', 'Women', 'Lib', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'nobody', 'EVER', 'used', 'insipid', 'line', 'back', 'then', 'fact', 'were', 'intended', 'mildly', 'sassy', 'bit', 'teasing', 'repartee', 'i.e', 'had', 'been', 'laced', 'trace', 'irony', 'might', 'have', 'passed', 'kinda-sorta', 'witty', 'comeback', 'least', 'circles', 'actress', 'line', 'whiny', 'petulant', 'reading', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'off', 'particularly', 'dumb', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'social', 'relevance', 'screenwriting', 'directing', 'duo', 'Eleanor', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'known', 'subtlety', 'case', 'heavyhanded', 'nod', 'emerging', 'social', 'movment', 'particularly', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'embodied', 'feminist', 'concerns', 'more', 'successfully', 'other', 'film', 'immediate', 'era', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'feminism', 'women', 'lib', 'were', 'never', 'mentioned.In', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'unforgiving', 'portrayals', 'male', 'characters', 'be', 'similarly', 'over-the-top', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'perceptively', 'noted', 'film', 'one', 'Mad', 'Housewife', 'Diary', 'therefore', 'definition', 'subjective', 'fact', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'are', 'able', 'give', 'human', 'dimension', 'otherwise', 'monstrous', 'characters', 'saving', 'grace', 'Had', 'been', 'played', 'strictly', 'written', 'film', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'it.Viewed', 'more', '35', 'years', 'breakthrough', 'release', 'film', 'particularly', 'prescient', 'addressed', 'Yuppie', 'materialism', 'shallowness', 'term', 'even', 'existed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'college-aged', 'viewers', 'time', 'film', '1970', 'release', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'acquisative', 'careerist', 'Jonathan', 'Balsers', 'world', 'were', 'dying', 'breed', 'anyway', 'come', 'revolution', 'ilk', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'gone', 'Little', 'did', 'realize', '1980s', 'would', 'be', 'outdoing', 'older', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'terms', 'blind', 'ambition', 'downright', 'greed.At', 'film', 'close', 'Jonathan', 'Tina', 'Balser', 'reflect', 'early', 'Kennedy', 'era', 'idealism', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'more', 'radically', 'inclined', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'era', 'siblings', 'were', 'likely', 'wondering', 'same', 'thing', 'mid-80s', 'fact', 'double', 'bill', 'consisting', 'HOUSEWIFE', 'say', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'might', 'make', 'interesting', 'evening', 'entertainment.There', 'was', 'certainly', 'irony', 'fact', 'film', 'much', 'lauded', 'star', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'successfully', 'follow', 'up', 'breaktrhough', 'role', 'What', 'happened', 'subject', 'dispute', 'own', 'admission', 'pretty', 'much', 'opted', 'bigtime', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'own', 'accord', 'took', 'up', 'Neil', 'Young', 'willingly', 'becoming', 'maid', 'man', 'needed', 'least', 'time', 'pretty', 'much', 'dropped', 'out', 'came', 'back', 'character', 'actress', 'films', 'TV', 'once', 'commented', 'studios', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'bank', 'lead', 'role', 'return', 'voluntary', 'exile', 'then', 'was', 'considered', 'too', 'much', 'flake', 'Hmmm', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'exactly', 'same', 'kind', 'condescension', 'men', 'Tina', 'Balser', 'life', 'showed', 'fictional', 'Tina', 'Balser', 'was', 'punished', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'little', 'wife', 'real-life', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'had', 'pay', 'price', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'actress.Plus', 'ca', 'change']",Diary of a Mad Housewife VHS
497278,A2U4KVPAK32T96,B00000F37T,James K. Stewart,"[6, 7]","""A lay is a lay is a lay."" - George Prager to Tina Balser from ""Diary of a Mad Housewife""In the late 1960's, MCA studio chief Lew Wasserman could not understand why such movies as ""The Graduate"" and""Easy Rider"" were such big box-office hits. He was an aging man who didn't have a clue where HIS movie audiencehad gone. His production executive, Ned Tanen, on Wasserman's orders, was assigned to find out. They discoverednot surprisingly, there was a whole new generation of young movie-goers who wanted films about real people & realsituations and really didn't care, as well, who was in them. In 1969, Wasserman started a youth division at his studiowith Tanen as its head with the goal to produce films under $1 million, preferably $750,000, with the talent paid scale.The studios left them alone, production costs were low, and talent was abundant - this is why it became a director'smedium in the late 60's and early 70's. The first two films from Tanen's division were ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" and""Taking Off"" (from Milos Forman). Carrie Snodgress started her movie career (uncredited) with 1969's ""Easy Rider"". Ihave read that the film, ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"", should be MANDATORY viewing for every young engaged couple(especially the females) before they take that big step into the dark unknown with love-fogged dreams that it will be""happily ever after"". ""Diary"" is an examination into the cosmopolitan land of the brutally cold, cruel, and phony. ""Howbout a liddle roll in da hay??""  Inexplicably, ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" has never been officially released on DVD. Thisclassic 1970 Frank Perry film delivers a scathing view into a loveless, rut-filled, emotionally abusive marriage that TinaBalser (Carrie Snodgress) endures as a wife & mother with two little girls. Her husband, Jonathan (Richard Benjamin),is not exactly a role model for a wife's dream of ""Prince Charming"". He's a pompous, hyper-critical, belittling, status-seeking, phony Harvard-educated New York City lawyer who treats Tina like a slave. In desperation, she strays to anequally abusive, cruel man (fabulous Frank Langella as bi-sexual, narcissistic writer George Prager) for sexual motivesonly. The film is absolutely DEAD ON in focusing on the limits (and beyond) of what can happen to a person and whatthey must endure when they become trapped in bad relationships. I've always viewed ""Diary"" as a brilliant satire of amarriage, as this one goes bad, and VERY bad. You really feel Tina's frustration and pain with the manner these twomales in her life treat her, and she just takes their crap to the BREAKING point. With no musical soundtrack in the film(except for the Alice Cooper band at a party & some brief Christmas shopping carols), there is an almost documentaryeffect. There are so many scenes in ""Diary"" (most sad, some with very dark humor) that demonstrate the extent of hertolerance and reactions. Set during the Christmas season in NYC, even this normally joyful time is portrayed as a grim,sullen, and cynical experience (Jonathan throwing away the holiday card from his garbage men (they're ""nobodys""), thebickering, shoving Christmas shoppers downtown, Prager basically THROWING his Christmas gift for Tina AT her, and thequick, blink-and-you'll miss it shot of old Santa, himself, in a pretty disgusting act.) ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" is amongthree classic movies (that examine marriage) that, for me, brilliantly portray the darker and disturbing side of this greatinstitution (the other two being 1970's, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" & 1999's ""American Beauty"", both Oscar winningmasterpieces). ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" was adapted by Frank Perry's then-wife Eleanor from the 1967 Sue Kaufmannovel of the same name. It was released on VHS/BETA in 1982 & the short-lived MCA DISCOVISION format in 1978, butnever on DVD.  I was able to get a decent quality VHS-ripped DVD online years ago that will have to suffice. Frank andEleanor Perry worked together on six films, including his directorial debut, 1962's ""David and Lisa"", a dramatic and poig-nant box office hit about two institutionalized, emotionally disturbed teenagers which earned Perry an Academy Awardnomination for ""Best Director"".  Perry (1930 - 1995) was known for doing films with subjects involving troubled, disturbingpsychological character studies, including ""The Swimmer"", ""Last Summer"", and the controversial 1981 ""Mommie Dearest"".Carrie Snodgress (1945 - 2004) received a ""Best Actress"" Academy Award nomination for ""Diary"", along with two GoldenGlobe wins: ""Best Actress"" and ""New Star of the Year - Female"". Newcomer Langella was nominated for the Golden Globe""New Star of the Year - Male"" & won the 1970 National Board of Review ""Best Supporting Actor"" for ""Diary"". Richard Ben-jamin was nominated for the 1970 Golden Globe ""Best Actor"". ""Housewife"", itself, was nominated for ""Best Picture"" by theNational Board of Review and the Golden Globe. Rocker Neil Young (who was romantically involved with Snodgress afterthe film was released) wrote a song called, ""A Man Needs A Maid"" (on his 1972 ""Harvest"" album), after he saw the filmand was deeply affected by Carrie's performance as the withered Tina. His song, ""Motion Pictures"", from his 1974 album""On The Beach"", was inspired by his relationship with her. In 1990, she revealed, ""I wasn't a rock 'n' roll girl. I said, 'NeilYoung, Neil Young, where do I know that name from?'"" Their relationship ended in 1977, and she returned to the actingprofession, partly for financial reasons (she sued Young for child support). Sadly, Carrie died at the age of 58 from heartand liver failure while waiting on a liver transplant. ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" received RAVE reviews upon its release:The Los Angeles Times wrote of Snodgress, ""There is no pleasure for the dedicated moviegoer quite like watching a vividnew personality light up the screen."" The N.Y. Times said, ""Great movie making!  Superbly theatrical performances!  CarrieSnodgress will surely receive the critical praise she deeply deserves!"" & foreign critics from abroad called her, ""America'snewest star!"" Roger Ebert said of her, ""What makes the movie work is that it's played entirely from the housewife's pointof view, and that the housewife is played brilliantly by Carrie Snodgress."" Carrie once said, ""I was never really a careerwoman, you see. My dream had always just been to do my work well, fall in love and build a life for myself."" She did herwork well, indeed, with the 1970 masterpiece ""Diary of a Mad Housewife""! R.I.P., Carrie.

Thanks to a fab Amazon dealer, I now have a copy, and it certainly was worth the wait.I don't know either why Carrie Snodgress never became as widely seen as an actress as she deserved.  (She's battling a deadly liver condition right now, poor gal!)  Frank Langella is her hypnotically awful lover, the kind of self-absorbed writer who chews women up and spits them out.  Richard Benjamin who plays her husband, Jonathan Balser, as a humorless prat who spends a fortune trying unsuccessfully to social-climb in Manhattan.  Langella and Benjamin have had long careers--this film was a magnificent showcase for their talent, even as they abused poor Tina Balser.  &quot;Did you know that, girls?&quot; says Mr. Balser to his daughters.  &quot;Your mother was Phi Beta Kappa at Smith, but she can't make a decent four-minute egg.&quot;Snodgress' green-eyed silences, her little half-smiles, say more than any jabbery actress possibly could.

Gotta tell you though, this movie scared me away from marriage for years! I was very young when it came out and didn't quite understand all of it but I KNEW I didn't want to marry a Richard Benjamin. I've seen too many women trapped in marriages they thought would ""rescue"" them from the ills of the world I guess, only to find an inescapable, miserable trap.Scenes I remember best were Richard Benjamin sick in bed, yelling ""Tee-nnnaHHHHH"" louder and louder, escalating into a trantrum,  for Tina to drop everything and run to the bedside. His put-downs of her to the bratty daughters, her repellent lover who,after a shower together, finds a pimple on her butt and indignantly suggests she grew the thing on purpose, the shallow, weird NY party goers who steal valuable household knick-knacks from their hosts.I'd been asked by a number of men to marry them, but whenever I found anything even close to Benjamin's character, I ran. Got married late, but to a good guy.Educational watching for young women. Benjamin's character never hit Tina, but he was a psychological abuser and there the bruises don't show.",5,"""Tee-naaaaahhHHHHHH......!!!""",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1194,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'decades', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'up', 'TCM', 'Got', 'ta', 'tell', 'movie', 'scared', 'away', 'marriage', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'KNEW', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'women', 'trapped', 'marriages', 'thought', 'would', 'rescue', 'ills', 'world', 'guess', 'only', 'find', 'inescapable', 'miserable', 'trap.Scenes', 'remember', 'best', 'were', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'sick', 'bed', 'yelling', 'Tee-nnnaHHHHH', 'louder', 'louder', 'escalating', 'trantrum', 'Tina', 'drop', 'everything', 'run', 'bedside', 'put-downs', 'bratty', 'daughters', 'repellent', 'lover', 'who', 'shower', 'together', 'pimple', 'butt', 'indignantly', 'grew', 'thing', 'purpose', 'shallow', 'weird', 'NY', 'party', 'goers', 'who', 'steal', 'valuable', 'household', 'knick-knacks', 'hosts.I', ""'d"", 'been', 'asked', 'number', 'men', 'marry', 'whenever', 'found', 'anything', 'even', 'close', 'Benjamin', 'character', 'ran', 'Got', 'married', 'late', 'good', 'guy.Educational', 'watching', 'young', 'women', 'Benjamin', 'character', 'never', 'hit', 'Tina', 'was', 'psychological', 'abuser', 'bruises', 'do', ""n't"", 'show']",Diary of a Mad Housewife VHS
