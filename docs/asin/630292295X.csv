346234,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,630292295X,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[15, 16]","""The Magnificent Yankee"" is an acting tour-de-force by Louis Calhern, whose long, distinguished career began in 1921 as a matinee idol and culminated in his masterful character roles in the years before his untimely death in 1956. A Shakespearean actor whose work on the legitimate stage was lauded by fans and critics alike, Calhern portrays the estimable Holmes with a measured balance of wit, sensitivity, and intellectuality. Calhern's silky voice, debonair demeanor, and commanding presence are legendary, and were used to particlularly grand effect in this great film. Highly recommended---I hope it will be transferred to DVD. It's a shame so many young people nowadays have no clue about such master thespians as Louis Calhern. Since his films were devoid of blatant sex and vulgarity, and their plots required actual thought, I fear ""The Magnificent Yankee"" may never be transferred to DVD. There is probably not enough interest among the ""deep"" and ""sophisticated"" movie fans of contemporary popular ""culture."" However, for those of you who still appreciate great films and truly talented actors, purchase this classic film.

As biography it's paper thin and the film gives little indication of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes'(Louis Calhern) judicial philosophy or temperment.  The film seems more concerned with the relationship between Holmes and his wife, Fanny (Ann Harding), which is admirable in a way but even that is treated perfunctorily.  At an 89 minute running time the film seems long.  The film can only be recommended by the delightful performance of Calhern who does his darndest to breathe life in this semi-inert material.  Noteworthy are appearances by Herbert Anderson best known from TV's ""Dennis the Menace"" and Richard Anderson from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman"".",3,Calhern is Film's Lone Saving Grace,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,844,"['Considering', 'Magnificent', 'Yankee', 'one', 'American', 'history', 'giants', 'turn', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'major', 'disappointment', 'biography', 'paper', 'thin', 'film', 'little', 'indication', 'Justice', 'Oliver', 'Wendell', 'Holmes', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'judicial', 'philosophy', 'temperment', 'film', 'more', 'concerned', 'relationship', 'Holmes', 'wife', 'Fanny', 'Ann', 'Harding', 'admirable', 'way', 'even', 'treated', 'perfunctorily', '89', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'long', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'recommended', 'delightful', 'performance', 'Calhern', 'who', 'darndest', 'breathe', 'life', 'semi-inert', 'material', 'are', 'appearances', 'Herbert', 'Anderson', 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bionic', 'Woman']",N/A

I find it difficult to believe he lived to the age he did without making a mistake.  Having said that, I think movie is a SUPERB example of what a Supreme Court Justice should be.  He was unbiased in that his political leanings never influenced his decisions.  He worked with the other justices to get things done.  He was very aware that his position affected every facet of his life,  and that is beautifully brought out in this movie.  This movie should be required viewing by the members of the Supreme Courts, not only SCOTUS but the Supreme Courts in all 50 states.
