It has all the typical faults that old movies have.That being said, it is a very plain and moving story. I sobbed at the end, as did my mother and sisters (and brother....I think. But he won't admit it...). Maybe it is only moving to large families who do bicker... But basically, it is a tale about a family. And the oldest kid has issues with his dad and mom. And then family members begin to die. And....I cried. Alot. BTW the picture on the jacket--of all the kids running joyfully across the field, is an imaginary dream sequence that the boy has when wishing for a reunion of his now-divided-by-death family. But it is really more than a tearjerker. It is, however unartfully, a tale, simply told, that resonates deeply because it is touches a chord that is within all of us. Archetypes. The longing for ""home"" and the hardness---and bitter&sweetness---of; life.Go watch it. At the least, you will not understand. At the most, it will resonate in you themes that have lain dormant and should be awoken (Love Home Longing etc.).And besides, its an antidote to all the shallow artsy garbage streaming out of hollywood that is all about NUMBING your consciousness rather than STIRRING it, as this movie does.",4,Sappy but moving--like a child's tale,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1314,"['story', 'line', 'far-fetched', 'acting', 'means', 'great', 'cinematography', 'typical', 'faults', 'old', 'movies', 'have.That', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'plain', 'moving', 'story', 'sobbed', 'end', 'did', 'mother', 'sisters', 'brother', '.I', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'Maybe', 'only', 'moving', 'large', 'families', 'who', 'do', 'bicker', 'basically', 'tale', 'family', 'oldest', 'kid', 'issues', 'dad', 'mom', 'then', 'family', 'members', 'begin', 'die', '.I', 'cried', 'Alot', 'BTW', 'picture', 'jacket', 'kids', 'running', 'joyfully', 'field', 'imaginary', 'dream', 'sequence', 'boy', 'when', 'wishing', 'reunion', 'now-divided-by-death', 'family', 'really', 'more', 'tearjerker', 'however', 'unartfully', 'tale', 'simply', 'told', 'deeply', 'chord', 'Archetypes', 'longing', 'home', 'hardness', '-and', 'bitter', 'sweetness', '-of', 'watch', 'least', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'most', 'will', 'resonate', 'themes', 'have', 'lain', 'dormant', 'should', 'be', 'awoken', 'Love', 'Home', 'Longing', 'etc', '.And', 'besides', 'antidote', 'shallow', 'artsy', 'garbage', 'streaming', 'hollywood', 'NUMBING', 'consciousness', 'rather', 'STIRRING', 'movie']",N/A
