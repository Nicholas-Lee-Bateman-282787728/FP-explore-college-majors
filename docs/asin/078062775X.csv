35723,A3N94LNED0IF0R,078062775X,Charles S. Tashiro,"[3, 5]","Based on a short story with a simple, low-key situation, BESIEGED is Bernardo Bertolucci's best film in years, which admittedly doesn't say much. Although one of the most important filmmakers of his generation, Bertolucci hasn't had a fully realized success since THE LAST EMPEROR, and even that was a trifle over-weight. Here, shorn of the laborious effort to amaze, focused on filming effectively, rather than spectacularly, he re-discovers the playfulness and technical exuberance of his best work.The film is full of inventive, virtuoso flourishes. Few directors can equal Bertolucci's ability to match camerawork with music, for example, whether it is Thewlis practicing the piano or Newton dancing to the radio, or syncopated shots of Roman street life. The editing is clipped, elliptical, shorn of the self-indulgent longeurs of his recent films, showing just enough for us to get the point and feel of a scene, then moving on. The performances are touching, the situation intriguing enough to hold our attention, the ending neatly understated.It's all very deft, even witty. It just doesn't add up to much. Bertolucci at his best measures his characters against their political contexts. Sympathy is balanced against awareness of their social limits. Here, there's nothing much but a love story, and a deliberately muted one at that. It's probably no coincedence that the only deeply involving parts of BESIEGED are the sequences in Africa. The richly textured images of deep brown earth and skin against lush green forests and uniforms make Rome seem more than a little pallid. These scenes are felt and seen in a way that the main story can't approach, because they are the only parts that engage the director's critical intelligence.Bertolucci's early work blotted out conventional notions of quality to establish its own standards. (The ending of THE CONFORMIST, for example, is a shambles, but it doesn't matter given the heights achieved by the rest of the film.) The problem is that he suffers from the prodigy's curse. Having stunned us in his twenties, what can he do in his fifties that will equal, much less surpass his early achievements? He hasn't found the answer in BESIEGED, but at least he has returned to form.",3,A Return to Form,970272000,"09 30, 2000",2000,2236,"['Based', 'short', 'story', 'simple', 'low-key', 'situation', 'BESIEGED', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'best', 'film', 'years', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'filmmakers', 'generation', 'Bertolucci', ""n't"", 'had', 'fully', 'realized', 'success', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'even', 'was', 'trifle', 'over-weight', 'Here', 'shorn', 'laborious', 'effort', 'amaze', 'focused', 'filming', 'effectively', 'rather', 'spectacularly', 'playfulness', 'technical', 'exuberance', 'best', 'work.The', 'film', 'full', 'inventive', 'virtuoso', 'flourishes', 'Few', 'directors', 'can', 'equal', 'Bertolucci', 'ability', 'match', 'camerawork', 'music', 'example', 'Thewlis', 'practicing', 'piano', 'Newton', 'dancing', 'radio', 'syncopated', 'shots', 'Roman', 'street', 'life', 'editing', 'clipped', 'elliptical', 'shorn', 'self-indulgent', 'longeurs', 'recent', 'films', 'showing', 'just', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'feel', 'scene', 'then', 'moving', 'performances', 'are', 'touching', 'situation', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'ending', 'neatly', 'understated.It', 'very', 'deft', 'even', 'witty', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'Bertolucci', 'best', 'characters', 'political', 'contexts', 'Sympathy', 'balanced', 'awareness', 'social', 'limits', 'Here', 'nothing', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'deliberately', 'muted', 'one', 'probably', 'coincedence', 'only', 'deeply', 'involving', 'parts', 'BESIEGED', 'are', 'sequences', 'Africa', 'richly', 'textured', 'images', 'deep', 'brown', 'earth', 'skin', 'lush', 'green', 'forests', 'uniforms', 'make', 'Rome', 'seem', 'more', 'little', 'pallid', 'scenes', 'are', 'felt', 'seen', 'way', 'main', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'approach', 'are', 'only', 'parts', 'engage', 'director', 'critical', 'intelligence.Bertolucci', 'early', 'work', 'blotted', 'out', 'conventional', 'notions', 'quality', 'establish', 'own', 'standards', 'ending', 'THE', 'CONFORMIST', 'example', 'shambles', ""n't"", 'matter', 'given', 'heights', 'achieved', 'rest', 'film', 'problem', 'prodigy', 'curse', 'Having', 'stunned', 'twenties', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'fifties', 'will', 'equal', 'much', 'less', 'surpass', 'early', 'achievements', ""n't"", 'found', 'answer', 'BESIEGED', 'least', 'returned', 'form']",N/A

35725,ACBFF25XJC2T7,078062775X,Choice Critic,"[6, 6]","This Bernardo Bertolucci film, almost by definition, was bound to have beautiful cinematography and an interesting story.  Why the distributor felt the need to use an endorsement of the movie as ""Erotic"" by a USA Today film critic is mystifying.  You will wonder if you watched the same movie.  You may even wonder if he watched the movie at all or just assumed it would be erotic because Bertolucci's name is on the film.Regardless, this is a very good movie about two people from two very different cultures with very different personalities and views of life who find common ground in very compelling circumstances.  Thandie Newton, as Shandurai, shows quite a nice range as an African political exile in a role radically different from her role in ""Crash.""  Her accent is impeccable and her carriage and manner are earthy and lush.As a native of an unnamed African country she is in the main town while the country's new dictator's picture poster, dark glasses and military uniform, is being plastered on all of the local town's walls. She arrives at the school on the outskirts of town and must watch helplessly as her husband is arbitrarily arrested while teaching a class of children.  The movie falters in its tempo after Newton's husband is arrested.When we next see her after her husband's arrest she has made her way to Italy and it seems forever before there is a flashback explaining why she needed to flee the country. And what we see is still very little.  She has made it into an medical school in Rome and subsists by being a live-in maid for an introverted English piano teacher.  Her husband is confined in a military jail in Africa.The introverted piano teacher is Jason Kinsky, brilliantly played by David Thewlis.  In scene after scene Shandurai cleans and Kinsky plays classical music on his Steinway. He barely seems to take notice of her, except through clumsy attempts to show affection which Shandurai finds intrusive and unwelcome. Then one day Kinsky, from out of the blue, declares a mad, passionate, and irrational love for her. It is a wonderful scene since it is obvious that he has been so sheltered in the ""palazzo"" that he inherited from his aunt that he has no idea what love, or life for that matter, is.When Shandurai screams at him that she is married and that if he wants love from her he should obtain her husband's freedom we are at the crux of the plot and the rest of the movie moves along smoothly and touchingly. Little by little each time she cleans the house it begins to dawn on Shandurai that there are fewer and fewer items in the once beautifully furnished house. Little by little we begin to understand what is happening.Shandurai has no idea why beautiful carpets and statuettes are disappearing but she notices one day that Kinsky is receiving mail from the African country in which her husband is imprisoned; and that Kinsky is meeting with the local African minister at the African Catholic Church in Rome.  The African music of the church choir is matchless and the music throughout, both African and classical, is one of the strongest and most enjoyable elements of the movie.Having attended the church for reasons related to Shandurai's husband, Kinsky picks up on the difference in African music and his blend of it with the classical produces a wonderful moment.  Music that Shandurai has declared as boring to Kinsky, when melded with an African rhythm, makes her involuntarily move to the music in a gorgeous scene.Throughout the film Thewlis maintains his introverted, even embarrassed, and quirky nerdiness.  All the while unknown to Shandurai he is meeting the challenge of love that she gave him in ways that Shandurai only discovers by seeing correspondence to him from Africa. Kinsky himself finds his pathway to true love through the sacrifices he makes to help Shandurai's husband.David Thewlis's performance is an unrecognized award-winning performance if I have ever seen one. One goes from contempt for an utter out-of-touch clod at the beginning of the movie to a genuine admiration and affection for him by the end. It is a terrific performance by an actor whom I have never seen on screen before this picture.This movie does not need USA Today's ""eroticism"" to be one fine viewing experience.  But for the inadequate explanation of Shandurai's reason for emigrating to Rome (left on the cutting room floor?), this is a five-star movie.",4,Thandie Newton is Very Good but David Thewlis is Great,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,4414,"['Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'film', 'almost', 'definition', 'was', 'bound', 'have', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'interesting', 'story', 'Why', 'distributor', 'felt', 'need', 'use', 'endorsement', 'movie', 'Erotic', 'USA', 'Today', 'film', 'critic', 'mystifying', 'will', 'wonder', 'watched', 'same', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'wonder', 'watched', 'movie', 'just', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'erotic', 'Bertolucci', 'name', 'film.Regardless', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'cultures', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'views', 'life', 'who', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'very', 'compelling', 'circumstances', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Shandurai', 'quite', 'nice', 'range', 'African', 'political', 'exile', 'role', 'radically', 'different', 'role', 'Crash', 'accent', 'impeccable', 'carriage', 'manner', 'are', 'earthy', 'native', 'unnamed', 'African', 'country', 'main', 'town', 'country', 'new', 'dictator', 'picture', 'poster', 'dark', 'glasses', 'military', 'uniform', 'being', 'plastered', 'local', 'town', 'walls', 'school', 'outskirts', 'town', 'must', 'watch', 'helplessly', 'husband', 'arbitrarily', 'arrested', 'teaching', 'class', 'children', 'movie', 'tempo', 'Newton', 'husband', 'next', 'see', 'husband', 'arrest', 'made', 'way', 'Italy', 'forever', 'flashback', 'explaining', 'why', 'needed', 'flee', 'country', 'what', 'see', 'still', 'very', 'little', 'made', 'medical', 'school', 'Rome', 'subsists', 'being', 'live-in', 'maid', 'introverted', 'English', 'piano', 'teacher', 'husband', 'confined', 'military', 'jail', 'Africa.The', 'introverted', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Jason', 'Kinsky', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'scene', 'scene', 'Shandurai', 'cleans', 'Kinsky', 'classical', 'music', 'Steinway', 'barely', 'take', 'notice', 'clumsy', 'attempts', 'show', 'affection', 'Shandurai', 'intrusive', 'unwelcome', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Kinsky', 'blue', 'mad', 'passionate', 'irrational', 'love', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'obvious', 'been', 'so', 'sheltered', 'palazzo', 'inherited', 'aunt', 'idea', 'what', 'love', 'life', 'matter', 'is.When', 'Shandurai', 'screams', 'married', 'love', 'should', 'obtain', 'husband', 'freedom', 'are', 'crux', 'plot', 'rest', 'movie', 'along', 'smoothly', 'touchingly', 'Little', 'little', 'time', 'house', 'dawn', 'Shandurai', 'are', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'items', 'once', 'beautifully', 'furnished', 'house', 'Little', 'little', 'begin', 'understand', 'what', 'happening.Shandurai', 'idea', 'why', 'beautiful', 'carpets', 'statuettes', 'are', 'disappearing', 'one', 'day', 'Kinsky', 'receiving', 'mail', 'African', 'country', 'husband', 'imprisoned', 'Kinsky', 'meeting', 'local', 'African', 'minister', 'African', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Rome', 'African', 'music', 'church', 'choir', 'matchless', 'music', 'African', 'classical', 'one', 'strongest', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'elements', 'movie.Having', 'attended', 'church', 'reasons', 'related', 'Shandurai', 'husband', 'Kinsky', 'up', 'difference', 'African', 'music', 'blend', 'classical', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'Shandurai', 'declared', 'boring', 'Kinsky', 'when', 'melded', 'African', 'rhythm', 'involuntarily', 'move', 'music', 'gorgeous', 'scene.Throughout', 'film', 'Thewlis', 'introverted', 'even', 'embarrassed', 'quirky', 'nerdiness', 'while', 'unknown', 'Shandurai', 'meeting', 'challenge', 'love', 'gave', 'ways', 'Shandurai', 'only', 'seeing', 'correspondence', 'Africa', 'Kinsky', 'pathway', 'true', 'love', 'sacrifices', 'help', 'Shandurai', 'husband.David', 'Thewlis', 'performance', 'unrecognized', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'One', 'contempt', 'utter', 'out-of-touch', 'clod', 'beginning', 'movie', 'genuine', 'admiration', 'affection', 'end', 'terrific', 'performance', 'actor', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'screen', 'picture.This', 'movie', 'not', 'need', 'USA', 'Today', 'eroticism', 'be', 'one', 'fine', 'viewing', 'experience', 'inadequate', 'explanation', 'Shandurai', 'reason', 'emigrating', 'Rome', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'five-star', 'movie']",N/A

Nor a more beautiful example of physical and spiritual attraction transcending racial and cultural barriers. It is shameful that some bigoted racists among the current reviewers castigate it as the ""customary"" sexual exploitation of black women by white males. When Kinsky made his first passionate declaration of love to his ""black slave"", he had no idea that she was already married. Indeed he did not ask her to jump into bed. He asked her to MARRY him. As soon as he learned the truth, that her husband was a political prisoner in a black African country facing possible execution (its mostly blacks who kill blacks, isn't it? But that does not stop them blaming whites anyway), he backed off immediately. Without any pressure upon her, without even her acquiescence or knowledge, he sets about raising the ransom to free him and beggars himself in the process without any thought of reward. She becomes aware of this quite accidentally when she sees some of his precious sculptures on sale in a nearby shop, and catches sight of him conversing with an African priest in whom she has confided her husband's plight. The penny finally drops when she sees his beloved Steinway descending several stories to be crated and removed in exchange for the balance of the ransom. The story is told by Bertolucci with exemplary subtlety and understatement. The dialogue between the two is minimilistic, but their looks and expressions speak volumes. It is the greatest example of Bertolucci's art, knocking spots off such gaudy enterprises as The Last Emperor, or his gratuitous erotica ----- Last Tango in Paris and The Dreamers. Apart from his mastery in revealing the human relationship with beautiful economy, his camera fills our eyes with exciting shots of the apartment and its surroundings, especially the dramatic spiral staircase that becoms a paradigm for the web in which the characters find themselves entrapped. As he showed in The Sheltering Sky, he understands the culture of Africa and can authentically reproduce its flavour. The cutting back and forth between the two continents is one of the special joys he provides the viewer. Indeed his cutting throughout is exemplary, building up the pace and excitement of what otherwise may have been a relatively uneventful 90 minutes.

Thewlis(you might remember from Naked)plays the decadent westerner(all Bertolucci lead roles are that)we are asked to pay attention to. Thewlis does not demand you pay attention like Brando does rather he is so quiet and mysterious you can't help but pay attention. Only when he plays piano do you find out how much is going on within him. And what music(the piano is the third major presence in this movie). Thewliss and Newton come from different sides of the world and neither is perhaps very satisfied with the place from whence they come, both exiles, and each is very curious about the other. Many times the camera is on one at a time while each wonders about the other in the next room. It doesn't sound like much but it is drama of a very peculiar sort. Two humans,two cultures perhaps, slowly coming into contact. Very strange and very powerful movie.

35734,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,078062775X,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[21, 24]","The title of Bertolucci's Besieged is a subtle reference to both main characters--Thandie Newton's Shandurai and David Thewlis' Mr. Kinsky.  The former, an African emigre now living in Rome, is both a medical student and Mr. Kinsky's housekeeper.  Her state of &quot;besiegement&quot; is the situation of living in Kinsky's confining environment--confining principally because of the owner's emotional isolation, and simultaneously of her husband having been arrested in her native country; she is besieged by exposure to a foreign culture, by forces previously unknown to her.Kinsky's besiegement is, as mentioned above, his emotional isolation.  He keeps himself inside his house and is rarely seen venturing outside. Only after he professes his passion for his housekeeper and realizes that he must do more than verbalize his feelings does he break the confines of his physical surroundings and leave the barriers he has besieged himself with.Kinsky, a composer and pianist, is initially seen playing standard Western classical music, but as he becomes more enamored with Shandurai, the rhythms of her African music begin to influence his own compositions.  In a beautiful scene, a session at his piano begins with a simple two-note structure and ultimately results in a piece that fervently echoes the hypnotic, percussive feel of the songs she listens to on her cassette player in her downstairs apartment.Kinsky's intensity throughout, paralleled with Shandurai's combined intelligence and semi-bewilderment are what gives this work its resonance.

35740,A1J2931UBBJPXM,078062775X,Reviewer,"[65, 70]","During the first twenty minutes or so of ""Besieged,"" directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, there is virtually no dialogue, at least nothing even remotely conversational; and yet the first half hour of the film is almost hypnotically riveting, and by that point you already know more about the two main characters than if they'd had pages worth of words to say.  And it's all done with the subtle, controlled emoting of the actors, guided by a director with a keen eye for detail, who knows exactly what he wants, how to get it and how to present it.This emotionally involving film stars Thandie Newton as Shandurai, a young woman forced to leave South Africa for Rome after her husband, a school teacher, is arrested by the Military Police, then summarily held in prison-- and without a trial-- indefinitely (His crime is never precisely indicated, though it is implied during a classroom scene at the very beginning of the film).  In Rome, Shandurai attends medical school, while supporting herself by working as a housekeeper for a man named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), a reclusive pianist, apparently fairly well-to-do, who gives piano lessons to children in his home.Early on in the film it is evident that Mr. Kinsky looks upon Shandurai as something more than merely a housekeeper; he is obviously quite taken with her.  The moral implications of the situation are readily apparent, of course, as is the position in which it will predictably place Shandurai at some point in the near future.  There is little doubt as to the direction the story is taking; the question that remains, however, is how Shandurai will deal with her impending dilemma.The story becomes even more engaging as matters are pressed and circumstances develop which make Shandurai's conundrum even more of a moral miasma.  Bertolucci draws his audience in by creating a situation so emotionally complex that at times it fairly resonates on the screen.  And rather than allowing it to become simply a test of love and loyalty, he takes it much deeper-- so that the real impact of the film stems from the respective stances taken by Shandurai and Mr. Kinsky, as they strive to resolve their personal feelings while attempting to satisfactorily breach this seemingly insurmountable situation.  Bertolucci draws a delicate line on which he balances the emotions, actions and reactions of his characters, which pays off handsomely in the end.The overall success of the film, however, is predicated upon on thing-- that being the performances of Newton and Thewlis; and both deliver, unequivocally.  Newton's role is especially challenging, as she has to convey so much through her emotions alone.  Her gestures, expressions and mannerisms are her words; and the slightest alteration of any of these-- the slightest arch of an eyebrow, a shifting of the eyes at a particular moment or a barely discernible movement of her lips-- speaks volumes. And for this to be effective, it had to come from a place deep within; mere surface theatrics or any hint of pretentiousness at any time would have dispelled the believability of the character at once-- and Newton not only prevails, but does so overwhelmingly.  It's an extremely well realized portrayal of a woman in conflict, facing one of the greatest trials of her life.Thewlis, as well, gives a resoundingly sympathetic performance as Mr. Kinsky, that would have to be ranked among the best work he's ever done.  As with Newton's role, he must convey so much physically, and he does-- turning in a very sensitive, well defined performance through which he employs just the right amount of reserve and restraint as befits the character he is creating.  It's an affecting, honest portrayal that makes Mr. Kinsky very real and believable.The supporting cast includes Claudio Santamaria, John C. Ojwang, Massimo De Rossi, Cyril Nri, Paul Osul and Veronica Lazar.  Artistically rendered and subtle in nuance, ""Besieged"" explores the parameters of love and measures the limits of the boundaries expressed by the heart.  An insightful treatise on human nature, it removes one emotional layer after another, right up to the very end-- which is a moment of truth nothing less than sublime.  And one that will keep this film in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.",4,Engaging Performances by Newton and Thewlis,990403200,"05 21, 2001",2001,4283,"['first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Besieged', 'directed', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'virtually', 'dialogue', 'least', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'conversational', 'yet', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'almost', 'hypnotically', 'riveting', 'point', 'already', 'know', 'more', 'two', 'main', 'characters', ""'d"", 'had', 'pages', 'words', 'say', 'done', 'subtle', 'controlled', 'emoting', 'actors', 'guided', 'director', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'how', 'get', 'how', 'present', 'it.This', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'film', 'stars', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Shandurai', 'young', 'woman', 'forced', 'leave', 'South', 'Africa', 'Rome', 'husband', 'school', 'teacher', 'arrested', 'Military', 'Police', 'then', 'summarily', 'held', 'prison', 'trial', 'indefinitely', 'crime', 'never', 'precisely', 'indicated', 'implied', 'classroom', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'Rome', 'Shandurai', 'medical', 'school', 'supporting', 'working', 'housekeeper', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Kinsky', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'reclusive', 'pianist', 'apparently', 'fairly', 'well-to-do', 'who', 'piano', 'lessons', 'children', 'home.Early', 'film', 'evident', 'Mr.', 'Kinsky', 'upon', 'Shandurai', 'something', 'more', 'merely', 'housekeeper', 'obviously', 'quite', 'taken', 'moral', 'implications', 'situation', 'are', 'readily', 'apparent', 'course', 'position', 'will', 'predictably', 'place', 'Shandurai', 'point', 'near', 'future', 'little', 'doubt', 'direction', 'story', 'taking', 'question', 'however', 'how', 'Shandurai', 'will', 'deal', 'impending', 'dilemma.The', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'engaging', 'matters', 'are', 'pressed', 'circumstances', 'develop', 'make', 'Shandurai', 'conundrum', 'even', 'more', 'moral', 'miasma', 'Bertolucci', 'audience', 'creating', 'situation', 'so', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'times', 'fairly', 'screen', 'rather', 'allowing', 'become', 'simply', 'test', 'love', 'loyalty', 'much', 'deeper', 'real', 'impact', 'film', 'respective', 'stances', 'taken', 'Shandurai', 'Mr.', 'Kinsky', 'strive', 'resolve', 'personal', 'feelings', 'attempting', 'satisfactorily', 'breach', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'situation', 'Bertolucci', 'delicate', 'line', 'emotions', 'actions', 'reactions', 'characters', 'off', 'handsomely', 'end.The', 'overall', 'success', 'film', 'however', 'predicated', 'thing', 'being', 'performances', 'Newton', 'Thewlis', 'deliver', 'unequivocally', 'Newton', 'role', 'especially', 'challenging', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'emotions', 'alone', 'gestures', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'words', 'slightest', 'alteration', 'slightest', 'arch', 'eyebrow', 'shifting', 'eyes', 'particular', 'moment', 'barely', 'discernible', 'movement', 'lips', 'volumes', 'be', 'effective', 'had', 'come', 'place', 'deep', 'mere', 'surface', 'theatrics', 'hint', 'pretentiousness', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'dispelled', 'believability', 'character', 'once', 'Newton', 'not', 'only', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'extremely', 'well', 'realized', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'conflict', 'facing', 'one', 'greatest', 'trials', 'life.Thewlis', 'as', 'well', 'resoundingly', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Kinsky', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'ranked', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'done', 'Newton', 'role', 'must', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'physically', 'turning', 'very', 'sensitive', 'well', 'defined', 'performance', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'reserve', 'restraint', 'befits', 'character', 'creating', 'affecting', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Kinsky', 'very', 'real', 'believable.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Claudio', 'Santamaria', 'John', 'C.', 'Ojwang', 'Massimo', 'De', 'Rossi', 'Cyril', 'Nri', 'Paul', 'Osul', 'Veronica', 'Lazar', 'Artistically', 'rendered', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'Besieged', 'parameters', 'love', 'limits', 'boundaries', 'expressed', 'heart', 'insightful', 'treatise', 'human', 'nature', 'one', 'emotional', 'layer', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'moment', 'truth', 'nothing', 'less', 'sublime', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'film', 'memory', 'long', 'screen', 'gone', 'dark']",N/A

She rebuffs him when he makes overtures to her, only to discover that he selflessly devoted himself to bribing his way by pawning his possessions (including his treasured piano) so as to guarantee the freedom of her husband, imprisoned by her country's repressive regime. The serene tale unfolds with a quiet sensitivity to its conclusion. The understatement of the treatment, as opposed to the melodrama of mainstream films dealing with such issues, is nothing short of masterful. The uses of silence, visual metaphor and piano solos, besides hinting at the psychological inner worlds of the characters, set the pace of the film: there is no preaching, but only suggestion. This is not a film for a mass audience, who may regard it as heavygoing, but a literary work of the Henry James stamp seamlessly transposed into film.
