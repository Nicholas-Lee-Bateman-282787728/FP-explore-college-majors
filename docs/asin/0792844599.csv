150817,A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,0792844599,A*,"[2, 4]",Dodsworth plays so honest and self assured its no surprise that it still resonates today with such a powerful impact! A married couple of wealth decide to embark on a honeymoon but soon their lust for others consume their small-town facades! Don't underestimate this flicks truth because after its over is where the true meaning of it holds up. For all of Sam Dodsworth open ended good nature his wife was not the evil one in this flick for having the affair it was Dodsworth Wyler paints him in such a warm often nerve popping good guy glow that when a little temptation enters the screen played to perfection by a cool Mary Astor he not only acts human but finally shows some depth.  Thats what the films core is the elegance of the dinning scene and the warm glow that each sets of lovers past over one another turns the viewer into a sort of emotional referee! Teh dialogue gives the film its emotional anchor.  Dodsworth is a classic for anytime due to the fact that the film not only captured emtions of love and even hate it put it into the open with such raw emotion and drama and even rewards the viewer for not only realizing love doesn't end with middle age it can even begin!

150819,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0792844599,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[9, 11]","I hesitated before viewing DODSWORTH; the title can throw you off, the reprts that it is neither a tragedy nor a comedy; and even, from those who have seen it, the European settings are not interesting (you mainly see the  interior of hotel rooms).  But wait!  It turns out to be a superbly crafted  film, well-edited, beautifully paced, well acted (Ruth Chatterton on the  weak side, perhaps, but Walter Huston and Mary Astor, especially, as good  as they ever get!)  The most important thing I can say about DODSWORTH is  that it is one of those rare movies that you experience rather than see,  that you feel you're growing older and wiser even as the characters on the  screen grow older and wiser.  The ending is an absolutely perfect  realization of the story line; indeed it resolves issues that were there  all along, just like a brilliant Agatha Christie ending.  This movie is no  detective story, of course, but it is plotted and realized with the same  impeccable logic.  I'm very stingy with Amazon's allotment of stars, and  while I would give DODSWORTH four and a half stars if half-stars were  available, it doesn't have quite the impact of AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, a  movie which DODSWORTH calls to mind for many structural reasons (but not  directly plot-wise).  What a joy it would have been to see Walter Huston on  the Broadway stage!  But since few people alive today can have seen him  there, he is preserved for us in DODSWORTH in a role so well acted that you  never for a second think he's acting.",4,A Movie that Becomes Part of your Own Experience,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,1521,"['hesitated', 'viewing', 'DODSWORTH', 'title', 'can', 'throw', 'off', 'reprts', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'European', 'settings', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'mainly', 'see', 'interior', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'wait', 'out', 'be', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'film', 'well-edited', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'well', 'acted', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'weak', 'side', 'perhaps', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'especially', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'get', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'DODSWORTH', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'experience', 'rather', 'see', 'feel', ""'re"", 'growing', 'older', 'wiser', 'even', 'characters', 'screen', 'grow', 'older', 'wiser', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'realization', 'story', 'line', 'indeed', 'issues', 'were', 'all', 'along', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'ending', 'movie', 'detective', 'story', 'course', 'plotted', 'realized', 'same', 'impeccable', 'logic', ""'m"", 'very', 'stingy', 'Amazon', 'allotment', 'stars', 'would', 'give', 'DODSWORTH', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'half-stars', 'were', 'available', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'impact', 'AN', 'AFFAIR', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'movie', 'DODSWORTH', 'mind', 'many', 'structural', 'reasons', 'not', 'directly', 'plot-wise', 'What', 'joy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'few', 'people', 'alive', 'today', 'can', 'have', 'seen', 'there', 'preserved', 'DODSWORTH', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'never', 'second', 'think', 'acting']",N/A

The main character Sam Dodsworth so magnificently portrayed by Walter Huston flings that line in angry exasperation at his shallow, selfish, self-absorbed wife Fran played by Ruth Chatterton near the end of this film.  I wanted to stand up and cheer when he did!""Dodsworth"" was adapted for the screen by Sidney Howard from his Broadway play of the same name, which in turn was based on the Sinclair Lewis novel.  As the film begins Sam Dodsworth (Huston) has just sold his automobile manufacturing plant in Zenith, a city in the Midwestern United States for a very handsome profit.  He is only just fifty years old and is looking for new business challenges possibly in the fledgling airline industry, (the time frame is the early to mid 1930's), but first he will take his forty year old wife Fran (Chatterton) on an extended grand tour of Europe.  Sam is excited and exhilarated at the prospect of his first trip to the Old World, he is the quintessential American tourist, realizes it and is unashamed at being so.  However Fran is an inherent snob, she fancies herself a sophisticated, worldly socialite and tends for the most part to look down on most of her fellow Americans abroad as provincial including her husband.  They have very different aims in this trip, Sam wants to have a second honeymoon, see all the sights he's read about, and perhaps put some feelers out in the European business community.  Fran on the other hand, wants a social network among the European caf&eacute; society and aristocracy, a new wardrobe and basically a fling, nightclubbing and partying with a variety of escorts some younger than Sam.  Inevitably they drift apart, tensions build between them and burst when Fran callously informs Sam she wants to divorce him to marry an impoverished young Austrian baron, Kurt von Obersdorf (Gregory Gaye).  Devastated, Sam travels listlessly across Europe until in Naples he has a chance meeting with an attractive, kindly American divorcee Edith Cortwright (Mary Astor), whom he had met on the initial voyage over on the Queen Mary.  Seeing how unhappy he is, she invites him to stay at her villa, where he is mentally and physically restored, and Edith and he fall in love.  However, the very day he proposes marriage to her, once his divorce is final, he receives an upsetting long distance telephone call from Vienna.As Sam Dodsworth, Walter Huston gives one of the cinema's most outstanding performances, he is incomparable, and any other actor in the part is inconceivable.  He's a true star, larger than life, magnetic, but superbly subtle and accomplished in his craft to boot.  This is a complex, multi faceted performance.  At the film's beginning Huston is a very masculine, virile force, full of self-confidence, rough edged at times yet comfortable in his own skin, with an enthusiasm and zest for his highly anticipated new life.  When the European reality turns out quite differently from what he imagined, Huston ably shows how Sam's character is steadily diminished, except in one instance where he exhibits a tough ruthlessness that works temporarily.  With the collapse of his marriage he is a shell of his former self, he actually seems to have shrunk into himself, wandering aimlessly through Europe until the divorce comes through.  Huston brings out Sam's rebirth at his stay in Edith's, his vigor, drive and self-assurance resurfaces, once again he's a young man in his joy of life.  Walter Huston does it all and much more, this performance was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, and should have by all rights won, but he did make the winner's circle with the NY Film Critics who named him the Best Actor for 1936.Ruth Chatterton nails the character of Fran, beginning with the affectedly genteel finishing school vocal tones.  To Ms. Chatterton's credit Fran does not emerge as a one-dimensional clich&eacute; of the unfaithful wife.  She brings out the pathetic side of Fran fancying herself a chic, cosmopolitan woman ready to take her place with the continental haute monde when in reality she is out of her depth, at heart just as small town as the stereotypical American tourists she scorns.  This is a woman who deludes herself about her age, dying her hair a gleaming blonde, wearing the clothes of a femme fatale, refusing to return to America for the birth of her first grandchild.  Yet, she is destructive in her fantasies, she wants a man she can dominate who will dance attendance to her, she has affairs with two pallid, cardboard Europeans with disastrous results, does her best to emasculate Sam, and comes close to succeeding.  Her final comeuppance is deservedly earned, but even though she is so exasperating and to be blunt a bitch, you can't help feeling a twinge of pity for someone so vain and clueless.  Her probable fate in a couple of years will be paying gigolos to tell her the lies she so desperately needs to hear.The rest of the supporting cast, sterling one and all, beginning with Mary Astor who gives a lovely, compassionate, intelligent performance as Edith Cortwright, the total antithesis of Fran.  Although it's brief, Maria Ouspenskaya makes a memorable impression as an imposing, glacial grand dame, the mother of the hapless Kurt that scored her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.  There is an ersatz sophistication in Paul Lukas' anemic Arnold Iselin.  Two future movies stars have brief roles but register favorably nonetheless; David Niven as the randy Captain Lockert who delivers to Fran a few home truths about her character, and John Howard Payne who would shortly drop the Howard as Harry McKee, the Dodsworths' young son in law has a very nice moment as a brand new father.  Nods of approval as well to Kathryn Marlowe as the understanding, loving daughter Emily Dodsworth McKee, Gregory Gaye as Kurt, Spring Byington and Harlan Briggs, as the Pearsons, the Dodsworths' best friends.William Wyler earned the first of his record twelve Oscar nominations for Best Director for ""Dodsworth"", and this film plus ""These Three"" also released in 1936 really put him on the map.  The screenplay by Sidney Howard is excellent, literate sprinkled with occasional moments of wit and humor, again tapped with an Oscar nomination.  Truly this is an adult, realistic portrayal of a marriage gone sour played against the clash of American and European sensibilities and morals.  Infidelity and sexuality are dealt with honestly and directly without sensationalism, both in Fran's case and also when Sam stays with Edith at her villa.  At first their relationship is platonic but swiftly becomes love and almost certainly they are sharing the same bed.  Amazingly it passed through the Production Code.All in all, ""Dodsworth"" picked up seven Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, only winning in the Best Art Direction Category for Richard Day.  What an injustice that it should be surpassed by the Academy for Best Picture in favor of the over the top ""biography"" extravaganza ""The Great Ziegfeld.""  Unlike that film though, ""Dodsworth"" remains a timeless classic whose luster continues to shine, even seventy-five years after its' release!",5,"""...Love has got to stop some place short of

DeRiemer,"[6, 6]","For all that Sinclair Lewis' reputation rests on the satires of Babbitt, Main Street and Elmer Gantry, Dodsworth is something different, much more mellow and much more sympathetic.The movie, written by Sidney Howard and directed by William Wyler, does a fine job of telling the story of Sam Dodsworth (Walter Huston), a recently retired automobile manufacturer, and his younger wife, Fran (Ruth Chatterton). Sam Dodsworth is smart and decent, very much the idea of an American. He's no one's fool, and his values of fairness and faithfulness guide his decisions. He loves his wife, but understands her, too. Fran longs to escape the constraints of the stifling, mid-west town of Zenith where Sam had built his company. When he sells the company, they decide to go to Europe on the grand tour, something Fran has longed for. ""Sam, I want a new life all over,"" she says, ""from the very beginning...a perfectly free, adventurous, glorious life...why, if we weren't tied to this half-baked middle-western town...oh, Sam, darling, I want all the lovely things I have a right to.""They go to Europe, and on the liner meet Edith Cortwright (Mary Astor), a sympathetic divorcee, and Clyde Lockert (David Niven), the first of several men Fran becomes attracted to. Fran is swept up in the clever, cultured ways of the European men she meets. Increasingly, we see how spoiled, superficial and petulant she is becoming. ""You've got to let me have my fling now,"" she cries to Sam, ""because you're simply rushing at old age, and I'm not ready for that."" Eventually she maneuvers things so that Sam returns home while she stays in Vienna. What's wrong with her, a friend asks Sam. ""She's scared of growing old.""By the end of the movie Sam Dodsworth has learned a good deal about himself and the limits a person can reach. We expect him and Edith Cortwright to achieve a happiness that neither probably thought to have. And for Fran, she will most likely remain a deeply unhappy woman.This is an excellent, mature drama that contrasts, within the unravelling of a marriage, the Thirties' view of the cultural, controlling sophistication of Europe with the direct vigor of America. Walter Huston does a magnificent job as Sam Dodsworth...strong, decent and, at first, out of his depth.

150824,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0792844599,David Baldwin,"[5, 5]","William Wyler's adaptation of Sinclair Lewis' ""Dodworth"" illustrates themes in 1936 that are as universal today as they were back in the day this film was produced.  The film concerns a retired industrialist(Walter Huston) who takes an extended holiday to Europe with his vain wife(Ruth Chatterton) to reinvigorate their marriage.  As their trip progresses, the fissures in their marriage expand.  The wife's infidelities are more blatant and Dodsworth finds himself attracted to a down-to-earth expatriate divorcee(Mary Astor).  This is a compelling film that is at times painful to watch.  This is made so by the towering performance of Walter Huston who portrays his pain with quiet dignity and little histrionics.  As a counterpoint, I found the behavior of Chatterton's character as the film progressed to be more over-the-top and insufferable.  You begin to wonder why Huston would want to rekindle this marriage to this woman or how they even hooked up to begin with.  Lastly, a young David Niven should be cited for a memorable turn as a naval captain who dresses down Chatterton's character for her transparently flirtatious ways.",5,Timeless Tale of a Marriage on the Rocks,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,1139,"['William', 'Wyler', 'adaptation', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'Dodworth', 'themes', '1936', 'are', 'universal', 'today', 'were', 'back', 'day', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'film', 'retired', 'industrialist', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'who', 'extended', 'holiday', 'Europe', 'vain', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'reinvigorate', 'marriage', 'trip', 'fissures', 'marriage', 'expand', 'wife', 'infidelities', 'are', 'more', 'blatant', 'Dodsworth', 'attracted', 'down-to-earth', 'expatriate', 'divorcee', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'compelling', 'film', 'times', 'painful', 'watch', 'made', 'so', 'towering', 'performance', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'who', 'pain', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'little', 'histrionics', 'counterpoint', 'found', 'behavior', 'Chatterton', 'character', 'film', 'progressed', 'be', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'insufferable', 'begin', 'wonder', 'why', 'Huston', 'would', 'want', 'rekindle', 'marriage', 'woman', 'how', 'even', 'hooked', 'up', 'begin', 'Lastly', 'young', 'David', 'Niven', 'should', 'be', 'cited', 'memorable', 'turn', 'naval', 'captain', 'who', 'down', 'Chatterton', 'character', 'transparently', 'flirtatious', 'ways']",N/A

150828,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792844599,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 4]","""Dodsworth"" represents the convergence of 3 major themes in the mid 1930s - voyeuristic look at upper class life, concern with marital fidelity, and adaptations of plays to film.Hollywood was obsessed with upper class life in the 1930s. For example, among the top 10 grossing films were ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933), ""Becky Sharp"" (1935), ""The Richest Girl in the World"" (1934), ""The Girl from Missouri"" (1934), ""The House of Rothschild"" (1934), ""Libeled Lady"" (1936), ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" (1936), ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (1936), ""Alice Adams"" (1935), etc.Hollywood also made a lot of films from plays in the 30s. For example, among the top grossing films were ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933), ""Becky Sharp"" (1935), ""The Littlest Rebel"" (1935), ""The Gay Divorcee"" (1934), ""These Three"" (1936), etc.Not only were films about the upper classes popular, they also won Oscar - ""Come and Get It"" (Walter Brennan), ""Anthony Adverse"" (Gale Sondergaard), ""Dangerous"" (Bette Davis), ""Cavalcade"" (Best Picture), ""Grand Hotel"" (Picture), etc.Marital fidelity was a major plot point in films like ""Wife vs. Secretary"", ""Riffraff"",  ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933), ""Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933), ""The Gay Divorcee"" (1934), ""Libeled Lady"" (1936), etc.So it's not surprising that ""Dodsworth"", a film based on a play from the novel by the great Sinclair Lewis about marital fidelity among the upper classes, was #12 at the box office and nominated for 8 Oscars.Dodsworth stars Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton with Paul Lukas and Mary Astor. David Niven, John Payne, Spring Byington, and Maria Ouspenskaya have small parts.Walter Huston (1884-1950) plays a recently retired industrialist. At this point in his career, Huston had been churning out films (4 in 1931, 8 in 1932, 5 in 1933) but took a hiatus and began making one or two per year.  His performances had been relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., ""Gabriel Over the White House"") were hits. But the slow down resulted in a much elevated level of performance, and ""Dodsworth"" was his finest role after 30 films. He was nominated for an Oscar for this film and again in 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".Ruth Chatterton (1892-1961) was a major star of the 30s, achieving the distinction of being nominated twice in the same year (1930) for her roles in ""Madame X"" and ""Sarah and Son"". Among her hit films were ""The Magnificent Lie"" (1931), ""Tomorrow and Tomorrow"" (1932), and ""Lilly Turner"" (1933). Chatterton plays Huston's younger wife who blames her husband for ""rushing into old age"" and who desperately clings to her vanishing youth.Mary Astor (1906-1987) plays a widow whom the Dodsworths meet on their voyage to Europe.  Astor is best remembered as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), although she won the Oscar for her role in ""The Great Lie"" which appeared the same year and is now mostly forgotten. Astor made more than 100 films from 1921 to 1964 (""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"") and was a major star in the silent era. Astor does her usual good job. During filming she was undergoing her own public and scandalous divorce. She later recalled that Edith Cortright (her character) was her favorite role.Paul Lukas (1891-1971) plays the suave European who tries to seduce Mrs. Dodsworth. Lucas won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for his performance in ""Watch Over the Rhine"" (1943), a considerable feat considering  he was up against Bogart (""Casablanca"") and Gary Cooper (""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). He's probably best known as the Professor from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"". He was very popular in the 30s, appearing in more than 50 films including ""The Three Musketeers"" (1935), ""Little Women"" (1933), and ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" (1939).""Dodsworth"" was directed by the great William Wyler (1902-1981). Wyler was nominated for an Oscar a record 12 times and won 3 times - ""Ben Hur"" (1959), ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), and ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942). Among my favorite Wyler films are ""Dead End"" (1937), ""Jezebel"" (1938), and ""The Westerner"" (1940). ""Dodsworth"" was Wyler's 40th film and his first Oscar nomination.There are several themes going on at the same time - European vs. American culture, youth vs. old age, and comfort vs. excitement. We see this best in a confrontation between Chattenton and the mother of one of the men with whom she is having an affair. In this brief scene, Maria Ouspenskaya (1876-1949) plays the Baroness. Ouspenskaya was nominated for an Oscar for this brief scene, and again for ""Love Affair"" in 1939, but I remember her best as the Gypsy woman in ""The Wolfman"" (1941) and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" (1943).This is a very long film, especially by 1930s standards. Good acting and direction make it palatable, but I can't help but wonder if some of the European scenes could have been reduced and if some of the US scenes could also have been trimmed. That being said, you will rarely see a film that documents in such detail the slow deterioration in a relationship. Huston and Chatterton are terrific in the small glance and the quiet hurt. This type of real life acting was rare in the 30s, and quite frankly, rare in any decade.This film is a definite must see. More than 75 years after it was made it remains a classic.PS - If Amazon had a 10 point scale I would give this a 9. The only real fault is the length of the film, but is is definitely too long and would benefit greatly from being some judicious cuts.",4,Classic film with great performances,1302480000,"04 11,

150829,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792844599,Ed Uyeshima,"[18, 18]","This one is a gem, and along with ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", director William Wyler's best film, which is high praise since he has one of the most impressive canons in Hollywood history. This 1936 classic has to be one of the most mature views of marriage and divorce ever provided by the Hollywood studio system, and the cinematic translation of Sinclair Lewis' novel also represents Wyler's signature humanism at its most absorbing. The story centers on the Dodsworths - Sam is a millionaire industrialist who just sold his large automotive company so he can enjoy life with his vainglorious wife Fran, perpetually restless and fearful of getting old. They sail to Europe, as they usually did in 1930's romantic melodramas, and Fran wastes no time in flirting with Clyde Lockert, a young and perceptive lothario who sees the aging Fran for the fraud she is but pursues her anyway. This turns out to be the first of three liaisons Fran selfishly pursues, as the prospect of becoming a grandmother sends her over the edge while Sam patiently waits for her to come to her senses.Walter Huston gives one of the great screen performances as Sam, perfectly evoking his everyman demeanor in either full bluster or shades of subtlety. In a particularly brave turn, Ruth Chatterton plays his fortyish wife with palpable desperation and vindictive fervor, conveying the pretentiousness of a woman who wants to be Continental but never will be. She loses viewer sympathy with appropriate fearlessness but also with an interesting ambiguity that prevents her from being a stock villainess. In one of his earliest roles, David Niven already displays his trademark cavalier wit as Lockert. Paul Lukas plays the dapper but oily Arnold Iselin, who memorably confronts Sam's hold over Fran with a burning letter on a Lake Geneva villa terrace. Spring Byington has a nice scene as Matey, a friend back home who silently recognizes Fran's indiscretion, and in a memorable cameo, Maria Ouspenskaya shows up as the mother of Fran's new and even younger intended and stops her cold with one classic question, ""Have you thought how little happiness there could be for the old wife of a young husband?"". Although Mary Astor usually plays the villainous female, this time she plays Sam's new love, Edith Cortright, with such quiet maturity and infectious liberation that it makes the union between her and Sam all but inevitable.

In short, this is a great movie.It's about the complexity of people, their shadow side and their light side, involved in relationships for better or for worse.  A story about an automobile tycoon who adores his wife.  A story about a woman who married young and missed out on experiencing life as a single woman, who performed her duties and cares for her husband and children, but feels she has never really lived life to the core.  Unfortunately, she loses her humanity in her quest for a more colorful life.And the acting, oh my, the acting.  Walter Huston is just plain terrific (lost out at academy award time that year to Paul Muni),  and Ruth Chatterton (straight from Broadway, and does it show in her awesome performance) is perfect for the role of Fran Dodsworth.  Ms. Chatterton lived a life ahead of her time:  she directed Broadway plays as well, translated French plays for the American theatre, and was a licensed pilot.  After she retired she even became a successful writer.One of the greatest scenes in the film is between Ms. Chatterton and the great Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya, who studied in Russia with the reknowned Stanislavski.  She only accepted the role to support her own theatre school in New York, and went on to make many more film appearances.  The final lines in this scene will bowl you over.  Can't miss.We even see a very young John Payne, who bills himself as John Howard Payne after an ancestor who actually wrote the classic song ""Home Sweet Home.""Excellent directing by William Wyler (he keeps the film going at a fast pace), screenplay by Sidney Howard (also wrote the screenplay of ""Gone with the Wind,"" along with other uncredited writers), and the Broadway play, ""The Silver Cord.""I think this film should have won the academy award that year (1936) instead of ""The Great Ziegfeld,"" although, of course, there is much to be said for that film as well.",5,WHAT A GEM!,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,2249,"['expected', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'dated', 'interesting', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'anything', 'was', 'fascinated', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'mesmerized', 'whole', 'film', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'great', 'cast', 'honest', 'moving', 'story', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'multidimensionality', 'characters', 'parading', 'short', 'great', 'movie.It', 'complexity', 'people', 'shadow', 'side', 'light', 'side', 'involved', 'relationships', 'better', 'worse', 'story', 'automobile', 'tycoon', 'who', 'wife', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'married', 'young', 'missed', 'out', 'experiencing', 'life', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'performed', 'duties', 'cares', 'husband', 'children', 'never', 'really', 'lived', 'life', 'core', 'Unfortunately', 'humanity', 'quest', 'more', 'colorful', 'acting', 'oh', 'acting', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'just', 'plain', 'terrific', 'lost', 'out', 'academy', 'award', 'time', 'year', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'straight', 'Broadway', 'show', 'awesome', 'performance', 'perfect', 'role', 'Fran', 'Dodsworth', 'Ms.', 'Chatterton', 'lived', 'life', 'ahead', 'time', 'directed', 'Broadway', 'plays', 'as', 'well', 'translated', 'French', 'plays', 'American', 'theatre', 'was', 'licensed', 'pilot', 'retired', 'even', 'became', 'successful', 'writer.One', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Chatterton', 'great', 'Russian', 'actress', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'who', 'studied', 'Russia', 'reknowned', 'Stanislavski', 'only', 'accepted', 'role', 'support', 'own', 'theatre', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'went', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'film', 'appearances', 'final', 'lines', 'scene', 'will', 'bowl', 'over', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'miss.We', 'even', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'John', 'Payne', 'who', 'bills', 'John', 'Howard', 'Payne', 'ancestor', 'who', 'actually', 'wrote', 'classic', 'song', 'Home', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Excellent', 'directing', 'William', 'Wyler', 'film', 'going', 'fast', 'pace', 'screenplay', 'Sidney', 'Howard', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'other', 'uncredited', 'writers', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Silver', 'Cord', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'year', '1936', 'instead', 'Great', 'Ziegfeld', 'course', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'as', 'well']",N/A

I found the movie version much better, as the book is weighted down into the brink with Fran Dodsworth sniping and snobbery, and I really hated her way too soon, whereas in the movie, I could hold back from wanting to slap her by Sam Dodsworth's devotion to her.  Sam Dodsworth is a man of considerable character and intelligence, who after making a fortune in the auto industry, sells off his business and sails off onto a European extended trip with his spoiled wife.  His attitude is to take this time to broaden his horizons, learn something of his family background, educate himself historically, and fall in love with his wife Fran again.  Fran's attitude is make herself a centerpiece of upper-class European sophistication, of which she feels entitled to after putting in years of running their home and raising their daughter.  You almost get the feeling that she's been marking off the days on a wall, maybe somewhere in the attic, to the day when she'll be able to begin the life she has been fantasizing about for so long in Zenith, Michigan.  Fran's frantic desire for attention from men makes you wince with pain for Sam, but he is so patient with her and so true to her, that you want to be on his side and keep giving her another chance, and another and another.  Thank God for Edith Cortwright (Mary Astor).  I learned later that at this time in Mary Astor's life, she was going through a very public divorce, with hints at adultery and a ""purple"" diary.  Mary Astor's first lines in Dodsworth are said off camera, and when the movie came out in the theaters, Mary wrote that at the sound of her voice the audience exploded in applause.  She wrote that this show of affection from the public was so comforting to her, but I like to think some of the applause was the audience perhaps knowing the story and realizing Hurray, here's the woman who is going to save Sam Dodsworth from his wife.  To be totally fair, though, Fran is someone to be pitied, because she is so lost and blinded about the fine and true love she had all the time with her husband.  A great movie and a great cast.

I believe this film made it pretty clear to the Hollywood powers that be that the lady should remain on the stage.Dodsworth & his wife present 2 very different representations of the American tourist abroad. She is snooty & really only cares about her creature comforts & ""jumping up"" in European society.

A trip to Europe finds Mrs. Dodsworth on the hunt, first with a young David Niven, later with a young Frenchman ( Kurt), whom she's going to marry after a quick divorce in Vienna. Sam reacquaints himself, quite by accident,to Edith ( Mary Astor), a widowed American living in Southern Europe. This duo falls in love, but when Kurt's mother  refuses to have her young son married to an older Mrs. Dodsworth (Chatterton), the cagey wife postpones the divorce and agrees to meet Sam to sail back to America.

Directed by the legendary William Wyler (""Roman Holiday"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The Little Foxes"", ""Mrs. Miniver"", ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", etc...) and starring Walter Huston in the lead role as Sam Dodsworth, a self-made millionaire who at the start of the film has just retired after selling his automobile company.  Sam and his younger, pretentious wife Fran (Ruth Charleston), a woman who is completely athirst at preserving her waning youthful appearance, decide to take their ""second honeymoon"" on a long excursion to Europe.Dodsworth, a powerful business tycoon, and a man who far from lacks common sense and confidence, completely lets his affected, self-absorbed spouse walk all over him.  It doesn't take long on their European vacation for the flirtatious, frivolous Fran to start having an affair (a common faux pas of those going through a mid-life crisis).  Yet, loyal and loving to a fault, Sam doesn't wish to acknowledge all of her many shortcomings and continues to have faith that his needy, naive wife will someday see the light and come back to him.  He also begins up a platonic friendship with another woman Edith Cortright (Mary Astor), who in many ways is the complete antithesis of Fran.  She is a simple woman of kindness who possesses an air of quiet confidence, and a heart of gold.  Edith, like Sam, is also completely unaffected and the two of them can't help but be attracted to each other.  What unfolds for us the audience, is a bittersweet tale of a crumbling marriage and a man's self-discovery.I can't say enough about the acting in this fine film.  Walter Huston gives, in my opinion, one of the greatest acting performances not only of his career, but of any actor in the history of American cinema.  There is something so human, so consummately vulnerable about his character that makes it impossible (just as with Edith in the story) to not only feel empathetic but also tenderness toward his plight.  Many of us have experienced in our lifetimes unrequited love by either a significant other or even a spouse, and Huston's performance as the 'whipping boy' is simply on the money.  I would be amiss, if I also didn't acknowledge the great character actress Mary Astor's performance as well.  I have seen her in a handful of other films, and while she has always been great, her understated effort in this classic is simply a thing of beauty.""Dodsworth"" was nominated for seven Oscars (including Best Picture, Director and Actor for Huston) and possesses everything you look for in a great movie - great acting led by one of the greatest directors ever in Wyler, excellent writing, sound, art direction, etc... It also boasts one hec of a supporting cast - David Niven, Paul Lukas, John Payne, Harlan Briggs, Gregory Gay, Odette Myrtil, Spring Byington, and the illustrious Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya (nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar).  The latter, although not on the screen for very long, has one of the most memorable scenes in the film and it's a real treat to witness such masterful work.If you haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

Boullosa,"[2, 2]","It would be difficult to find a more sterling example than ""Dodsworth"" of what the American cinema can do when it turns to our own fine literature for a story, and then utilizes first-class scriptwriting, expert direction, and a magnificent cast to bring that story to life onscreen.This tale of a successful American industrialist retiring between the two World Wars, and the impact of his retirement on his long-time marriage, is based upon the novel of the same name by Sinclair Lewis.  In the tradition of good storytelling, the film explores social and cultural values through character development and personal conflict.Samuel Dodsworth represents the best in American business: a man who has done well not only because he is shrewd and hardworking, but because he subscribes doggedly to old-fashioned principles of upright behavior.  He has applied these principles both to his business and his personal life.  As the film opens, Sam says farewell to the successful auto plant he has built up in a small city somewhere in the midwest, and which he has just sold.  He departs having earned the respect and affection of all his workers, and now he prepares to take his wife on that long-deferred trip to Europe they have dreamed of for years.  They have a newly married daughter, their parenting responsibilities are over, thanks to the sale of the auto plant they have plenty of money, and they are now setting off to enjoy the first phase of what, ostensibly, is a well-earned, leisured retirement.Sam adores his wife, Fran, a still-pretty and elegant blonde just entering middle age.  Fran, however, has no intention of acknowledging her incipient middle-age, and we soon see that husband and wife have very different expectations of their European voyage.  Sam sees the trip as a chance, at last, to indulge his burning curiosity about the rest of the world in the company of the woman he has always loved.  Fran sees the trip as a first step to grander social horizons that she clearly feels she has always been cut out for, but that were out of reach in the provincial midwest.  Fran brings along an extensive, costly wardrobe and the first thing she does is overdress for dinner on their first night at sea.  As their journey progresses, the shallowness of Fran's values are increasingly exposed.  She is seduced by the gloss of European culture and sophistication she encounters without questioning whether anything more solid lies beneath.  She begins to view her marriage, as well as her midwestern home base, as insufficient showcases for her true destiny as a Great Lady.  She begins flirtations with European men whose values in such matters she does not quite grasp, and gets into trouble.  Little by little, as their journey progresses, the couple's at first seemingly small differences in personal and world views widen into larger and larger fissures, until a major crisis occurs.  Sam is deeply hurt and confronts decisions that violate his long-held principles, while Fran deludes herself into false hopes for her future.The cast is, without exception, superb. Exceptional mention must go to Ruth Chatterton for her brittle yet vulnerable portrayal of Fran - she nearly walks off with the movie.  Walter Huston as Sam manages to combine strength of character with a wistfulness that is touching in so strong a man.  Mary Astor, as Edith Cortright, the woman Sam meets in Europe whose values are so much closer to his than Fran's, brings all her accustomed intelligence and taste to this role.  A young David Niven appears as the first of Fran's European flirtations.  And, in an unforgettable scene, Maria Ouspenskaya, in a brief role as the formidable Baroness von Obersdorf, tells Fran the truth about herself as no one else has quite dared to.Quiet and literate as it is, this is a riveting film.  Produced by Samuel Goldwyn, ""Dodsworth"" richly deserves its place in the highest ranks of American cinema - once seen, its characters will remain clearly etched in memory.",5,One of the True Cinematic Greats,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,3996,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'find', 'more', 'sterling', 'example', 'Dodsworth', 'what', 'American', 'cinema', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'own', 'fine', 'literature', 'story', 'then', 'utilizes', 'first-class', 'scriptwriting', 'expert', 'direction', 'magnificent', 'cast', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'onscreen.This', 'tale', 'successful', 'American', 'industrialist', 'retiring', 'two', 'World', 'Wars', 'impact', 'retirement', 'long-time', 'marriage', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'tradition', 'good', 'storytelling', 'film', 'social', 'cultural', 'values', 'character', 'development', 'personal', 'conflict.Samuel', 'Dodsworth', 'best', 'American', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'done', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'shrewd', 'hardworking', 'doggedly', 'old-fashioned', 'principles', 'upright', 'behavior', 'applied', 'principles', 'business', 'personal', 'life', 'film', 'Sam', 'farewell', 'successful', 'auto', 'plant', 'built', 'up', 'small', 'city', 'somewhere', 'midwest', 'just', 'sold', 'having', 'earned', 'respect', 'affection', 'workers', 'now', 'take', 'wife', 'long-deferred', 'trip', 'Europe', 'have', 'dreamed', 'years', 'have', 'newly', 'married', 'daughter', 'parenting', 'responsibilities', 'are', 'thanks', 'sale', 'auto', 'plant', 'have', 'plenty', 'money', 'are', 'now', 'setting', 'off', 'enjoy', 'first', 'phase', 'what', 'ostensibly', 'well-earned', 'leisured', 'retirement.Sam', 'wife', 'Fran', 'still-pretty', 'elegant', 'blonde', 'just', 'entering', 'middle', 'age', 'Fran', 'however', 'intention', 'acknowledging', 'incipient', 'middle-age', 'soon', 'see', 'husband', 'wife', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'expectations', 'European', 'voyage', 'Sam', 'trip', 'chance', 'last', 'indulge', 'burning', 'curiosity', 'rest', 'world', 'company', 'woman', 'always', 'loved', 'Fran', 'trip', 'first', 'step', 'grander', 'social', 'horizons', 'clearly', 'always', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'were', 'reach', 'provincial', 'midwest', 'Fran', 'extensive', 'costly', 'wardrobe', 'first', 'thing', 'overdress', 'dinner', 'first', 'night', 'sea', 'journey', 'shallowness', 'Fran', 'values', 'are', 'increasingly', 'exposed', 'seduced', 'gloss', 'European', 'culture', 'sophistication', 'questioning', 'anything', 'more', 'solid', 'beneath', 'view', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'midwestern', 'home', 'base', 'insufficient', 'showcases', 'true', 'destiny', 'Great', 'Lady', 'flirtations', 'European', 'men', 'values', 'such', 'matters', 'not', 'quite', 'grasp', 'trouble', 'Little', 'little', 'journey', 'couple', 'first', 'seemingly', 'small', 'differences', 'personal', 'world', 'views', 'widen', 'larger', 'larger', 'fissures', 'major', 'crisis', 'Sam', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'confronts', 'decisions', 'violate', 'long-held', 'principles', 'Fran', 'false', 'hopes', 'future.The', 'cast', 'exception', 'superb', 'Exceptional', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'brittle', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'portrayal', 'Fran', 'nearly', 'walks', 'off', 'movie', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Sam', 'combine', 'strength', 'character', 'wistfulness', 'touching', 'so', 'strong', 'man', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Edith', 'Cortright', 'woman', 'Sam', 'Europe', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'closer', 'Fran', 'accustomed', 'intelligence', 'taste', 'role', 'young', 'David', 'Niven', 'first', 'Fran', 'European', 'flirtations', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'brief', 'role', 'formidable', 'Baroness', 'von', 'Obersdorf', 'Fran', 'truth', 'about', 'one', 'else', 'quite', 'dared', 'to.Quiet', 'literate', 'riveting', 'film', 'Produced', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'Dodsworth', 'richly', 'place', 'highest', 'ranks', 'American', 'cinema', 'once', 'seen', 'characters', 'will', 'remain', 'clearly', 'etched', 'memory']",N/A

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Dodsworth is an outstanding motion picture that portrays a marriage between two middle-aged ""empty-nesters"" who quickly find themselves at odds over how they wish to lead their lives when the husband sells his huge business and retires. The acting is convincing and very memorable; the cinematography and the choreography make Dodsworth even better. The plot moves along at a good pace although there were a few times I felt it could have been edited just a bit; but overall this is a very good movie indeed.When the action starts, we see somewhat depressed middle-aged Sam Dodsworth (Walter Huston) leaving his automobile company after building it up for decades; he has sold it and he now wishes to retire. His snooty wife Fran (Ruth Chatterton), however, is extremely sensitive and even neurotic about her becoming ""old"" even though she doesn't look anywhere near it. Soon Fran convinces Sam that maybe they need to have some adventure to spice up their new lives together so they set sail on the Queen Mary to go sightseeing in Europe.And this is precisely where the real trouble begins. Although Sam meets a divorcee named Edith Cortright (Mary Astor), Sam and Edith keep it strictly friends as they enjoy each other's company, socializing a bit as the ship nears its port in London. Unfortunately, however, Fran Dodsworth is already beginning to get the itch for another man. She is almost swept off her feet by a young man named Captain Clyde Lockert (David Niven) but she just manages to rebuff him in time. After Sam and Fran are actually in Europe, however, it isn't long before Fran gets another quasi-surreptitious suitor named Arnold Iselin (Paul Lukas). Now the marriage truly starts to crumble: We see Sam Dodsworth return to America without his wife Fran who stays on in Europe having what is presumably a most romantic affair with Arnold. Sam suspects something is up; he returns to Europe to confront both Arnold and Fran in a European hotel room where Fran does some mighty fine performing to pretend she's so very innocent. No matter, Sam is STILL willing to ""wipe the slate clean"" but Fran may not be able to resist the temptation to start life again with another man.Will Fran meet yet another man in Europe after Sam again goes back to America--and will they be able to get married if Fran can get a divorce from Sam? The answer could surprise you. And what about Sam's relationship with Edith Cortright after they have a chance meeting in Italy--will they be able to stay just friends? Watch the movie and find out!Dodsworth, no doubt, is one of the finest early portrayals of a marriage crumbling into divorce at a time when the real world still considered divorce a scandalous shame at best. I highly recommend this movie for many reasons; again as I mentioned the acting is superlative and the subject matter is dealt with very well. Fans of the actors in this movie will no doubt enjoy it as well.",5,did you ever notice how transparent people are when you REALLY look at them?,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,2925,"['Dodsworth', 'outstanding', 'motion', 'picture', 'marriage', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'empty-nesters', 'who', 'quickly', 'find', 'odds', 'how', 'wish', 'lead', 'lives', 'when', 'husband', 'huge', 'business', 'retires', 'acting', 'convincing', 'very', 'memorable', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'make', 'Dodsworth', 'even', 'better', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'just', 'bit', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'indeed.When', 'action', 'see', 'somewhat', 'depressed', 'middle-aged', 'Sam', 'Dodsworth', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'leaving', 'automobile', 'company', 'building', 'up', 'decades', 'sold', 'now', 'retire', 'snooty', 'wife', 'Fran', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'however', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'even', 'neurotic', 'becoming', 'old', 'even', ""n't"", 'look', 'anywhere', 'Soon', 'Fran', 'convinces', 'Sam', 'maybe', 'need', 'have', 'adventure', 'spice', 'up', 'new', 'lives', 'together', 'set', 'sail', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'go', 'sightseeing', 'Europe.And', 'precisely', 'where', 'real', 'trouble', 'begins', 'Sam', 'divorcee', 'named', 'Edith', 'Cortright', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Sam', 'Edith', 'keep', 'strictly', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'socializing', 'bit', 'ship', 'port', 'London', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'Fran', 'Dodsworth', 'already', 'beginning', 'get', 'itch', 'man', 'almost', 'swept', 'feet', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Captain', 'Clyde', 'Lockert', 'David', 'Niven', 'just', 'rebuff', 'time', 'Sam', 'Fran', 'are', 'actually', 'Europe', 'however', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Fran', 'quasi-surreptitious', 'suitor', 'named', 'Arnold', 'Iselin', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'Now', 'marriage', 'truly', 'crumble', 'see', 'Sam', 'Dodsworth', 'return', 'America', 'wife', 'Fran', 'who', 'Europe', 'having', 'what', 'presumably', 'most', 'romantic', 'affair', 'Arnold', 'Sam', 'something', 'up', 'Europe', 'confront', 'Arnold', 'Fran', 'European', 'hotel', 'room', 'where', 'Fran', 'mighty', 'fine', 'performing', 'pretend', 'so', 'very', 'innocent', 'matter', 'Sam', 'STILL', 'willing', 'wipe', 'slate', 'clean', 'Fran', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'temptation', 'start', 'life', 'again', 'man.Will', 'Fran', 'meet', 'yet', 'man', 'Europe', 'Sam', 'again', 'back', 'America', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'married', 'Fran', 'can', 'get', 'divorce', 'Sam', 'answer', 'could', 'surprise', 'what', 'Sam', 'relationship', 'Edith', 'Cortright', 'have', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Italy', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'just', 'friends', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Dodsworth', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest', 'early', 'portrayals', 'marriage', 'crumbling', 'divorce', 'time', 'when', 'real', 'world', 'still', 'considered', 'divorce', 'scandalous', 'shame', 'best', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'many', 'reasons', 'again', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'superlative', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealt', 'very', 'well', 'Fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

He wants to be a tourist and she wants to be a socialite.  This throws her into the arms of various gigolos.Sam tries to ignore her flirtations but eventually he tires of the vagabond life and returns home.  The only thing is that home has moved on and he no longer belongs at the head of his own table.Sam returns to Europe but Fran has formed an attachment.  Sam agrees to a divorce but has to stay in Europe until it is final.  During his travels he again runs into Edith (Mary Astor).  Edith is an American expatriate widow, who is living in Italy.  Sam met Edith on his first ship over and then ran into a couple of times during his earlier travels.  Edith invites Sam to stay at her villa until the divorce case is final.During this time Sam is contented for the first time since his retirement.  Once again a curve ball, Fran's boyfriend's mother does not approve of her and he leaves her.  Fran decides that Sam is better than nothing.  But as the ship is about to depart, Sam realizes that it is time to look after his best interest.This is a beautifully simple look at a marriage between the wars.  This was a period when divorce was still taboo and adultery was even worse.  This film featured early performances by many future stars.  Walter Huston would not become a star for twenty years when his son John ""rediscovered"" him.  But this film gives him a chance to show that he had talent.  As his unfaithful wife Fran, Ruther Chatterton is fine but is probably the weakest link in the film.  The great discovery is Mary Astor.  She will become one of the greatest character actresses ever.  This film shows the depth and range that Mary Astor is capable of.  She is just stunning in this film.

It's included in The National Film Registry for good reason. The characters are 3-dimensional, with complications and contradictions that are rare in Hollywood films. (It's a perfect example of why the Turner Movie Channel has been so successful.) Directed by William Wyler, released in 1936, it's about a middle-aged marriage that was held together by a type-A husband and, in a sense, his absence. When he realizes he has made a lot of money--as much as he needs--but hasn't seen enough of the world, he sets out for Europe with his wife. Unanticipated changes occur for both of them, leading to a very convincing portrait of a marriage that gets into trouble when both individuals are forced to spend a lot of time together, as well as the disorientation from the culture shock of adjusting to Europe and a different way of doing things. Both are forced to change their visions of what they want out of life and who they are. Beautifully paced and acted, with a fine adaptation of the novel, it's a classic Hollywood example of drama that avoids melodrama, that walks the line between engaging entertainment and artfully asking serious questions. It's a very fresh, original variation on the typical American-in-Europe narrative. And for me, the screen presence of Ruth Chatterton has been a revelation ever since first seeing ""Female.""

It is a masterful examination of love and romance being affected by both aging and differences in age and a heavy-hitting reflection on second chances and preserving youth, all conducted in tear-jerking seriousness. Amazing performances, unforgettable moments and sensational music make Dodsworth one of the greatest romantic dramas of all time.After 20 years of both marriage and success as a great industrialist, Samuel Dodsworth (Walter Huston) sells off Dodsworth Motors and plans to make a new life in retirement, learning how to enjoy leisure. He's thrilled to take a cruise to Europe with his wife Fran (Chatterton) who is chiefly concerned with staying young and preserving her ideals of youth. Sam is easily entertained with the friendly people and simple tourist attractions, but Fran feels stifled by his old-fashioned outlook and begins to drift away - flirting with a captain (David Niven) and the smooth-talking Iselin (Paul Lukas) and finally attracting the attentions of a Baron (Gregory Gaye). When Sam wishes to return to their comfortable hick hometown of Zenith, she can only think of her high class friends and his unimpressive bourgeois ideas.Sam returns to his home companionless to learn that his daughter Emily will be having a baby - and that he's dreadfully lonely without the wife he's always loved. In a last attempt to win her back, he resorts to ruthless measures to catch Fran cheating - and although guilt drives her to him, they soon grow even further apart. Even her joy of hearing about Emily's new child is lessened when Dodsworth hints at their new grandparent status. When Fran finally demands a divorce so she can wed the Baron, Sam is consumed with grief and weightily journeys around Europe to forget - and luckily reunites with a widowed acquaintance (Mary Astor) who is familiar with his marital woes. (The most affecting scene in the film is when Sam boards a train after Fran announces her plans to wed - and bids farewell with an absolutely heartbreaking, disillusioned sentimental remark.)It's heart-wrenching and poignant and very serious in its approach to dramatic romance. The plot may sound like a soap opera, but the acting and execution is absolutely perfect. The hero must undergo great emotional torment in his journey to re-discovering the excitement he never achieved with his younger wife. But Dodsworth is a film that knows how to win over audiences - not only does it think of appropriate happiness for the lead, it also insists upon total destruction for the wrongdoer; typical Golden-Age Hollywood influence that orders standing-ovation resolutions.- Mike Massie",5,Dodsworth Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,2783,"['Dodsworth', 'one', 'rare', 'monumental', 'movies', 'strike', 'emotional', 'chord', 'audiences', 'focusing', 'delicate', 'subject', 'matter', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'masterful', 'examination', 'love', 'romance', 'being', 'affected', 'aging', 'differences', 'age', 'heavy-hitting', 'reflection', 'second', 'chances', 'preserving', 'youth', 'conducted', 'tear-jerking', 'seriousness', 'Amazing', 'performances', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'sensational', 'music', 'make', 'Dodsworth', 'one', 'greatest', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'time.After', '20', 'years', 'marriage', 'success', 'great', 'industrialist', 'Samuel', 'Dodsworth', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Dodsworth', 'Motors', 'plans', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'retirement', 'learning', 'how', 'enjoy', 'leisure', 'thrilled', 'take', 'cruise', 'Europe', 'wife', 'Fran', 'Chatterton', 'who', 'chiefly', 'concerned', 'staying', 'young', 'preserving', 'ideals', 'youth', 'Sam', 'easily', 'entertained', 'friendly', 'people', 'simple', 'tourist', 'attractions', 'Fran', 'feels', 'stifled', 'old-fashioned', 'outlook', 'drift', 'away', 'flirting', 'captain', 'David', 'Niven', 'smooth-talking', 'Iselin', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'finally', 'attracting', 'attentions', 'Baron', 'Gregory', 'Gaye', 'When', 'Sam', 'return', 'comfortable', 'hick', 'hometown', 'Zenith', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'high', 'class', 'friends', 'unimpressive', 'bourgeois', 'ideas.Sam', 'returns', 'home', 'companionless', 'learn', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'will', 'be', 'having', 'baby', 'dreadfully', 'lonely', 'wife', 'always', 'loved', 'last', 'attempt', 'win', 'back', 'ruthless', 'measures', 'catch', 'Fran', 'cheating', 'guilt', 'drives', 'soon', 'grow', 'even', 'further', 'apart', 'Even', 'joy', 'hearing', 'Emily', 'new', 'child', 'lessened', 'when', 'Dodsworth', 'hints', 'new', 'grandparent', 'status', 'When', 'Fran', 'finally', 'divorce', 'can', 'wed', 'Baron', 'Sam', 'consumed', 'grief', 'weightily', 'journeys', 'Europe', 'forget', 'luckily', 'widowed', 'acquaintance', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'who', 'familiar', 'marital', 'woes', 'most', 'affecting', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Sam', 'train', 'Fran', 'plans', 'wed', 'bids', 'farewell', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'disillusioned', 'sentimental', 'remark', 'heart-wrenching', 'poignant', 'very', 'serious', 'approach', 'dramatic', 'romance', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'soap', 'opera', 'acting', 'execution', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'hero', 'must', 'undergo', 'great', 'emotional', 'torment', 'journey', 're-discovering', 'excitement', 'never', 'achieved', 'younger', 'wife', 'Dodsworth', 'film', 'how', 'win', 'over', 'audiences', 'not', 'only', 'think', 'appropriate', 'happiness', 'lead', 'also', 'total', 'destruction', 'wrongdoer', 'typical', 'Golden-Age', 'Hollywood', 'influence', 'orders', 'standing-ovation', 'resolutions.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

150868,AY8WZDYR79GFV,0792844599,Yasha Banana,"[1, 3]","I liked this movie very much.  It was well acted, well directed and well scripted.  Moreover, there was nothing in this movie that compromises itself in terms of frankness.  We all know that Ruth Chatterton, Walter Huston's wife in the movie, wants to schtup evey guy she meets.  This is some hot-to-trot chick, lemme tell ya.But movie, made in 1936 as opposed to 2010, doesn't *show* us anything.  Which makes the story all the more engaging and intriguing.In real life Walter Huston, who looked old when he was in his 30s, was 51 when he made this movie and Ruth Chatterton was 43, although in the movie we're led to believe that the age difference is greater, the idea being that the Ruth Chatterton character is getting tired of her old husband and wants to find a new lover.Ruth Chatterton develops he character brilliantly.  Little by little, we begin to realize that her Fran Dodsworth is one spoiled rich brat: selfish, manipulative and shallow.  Her husband, Walter Huston (Sam Dodsworth) turns a blind eye to her faults and goes on to live happily ever after.  But not with her.Mary Astor is only 30 in this movie and although she was in real life 21 years younger than Walter Huston, she looks and plays her part older than she actually is.What I find interesting about movies that came out in the 30's and 40's is that American-born actresses, such as Mary Astor who was born in Illinois, speak in such a way that they sound almost English.  Any number of actresses back then did that: Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, et al.  I suppose the idea was to make them sound more sophisticated, more worldly.  In this particular movie that characteristic in Mary Astor makes Walter Huston's character, a down-home, no-nonsense Midwesterner, all the more American by contrast.One can only imagine what dreck would result if today's Hollywood filmed a remake of this classic movie.  Let's hope that never happens.",5,Great movie!,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1912,"['liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'scripted', 'Moreover', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'terms', 'frankness', 'know', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'wife', 'movie', 'schtup', 'evey', 'guy', 'hot-to-trot', 'chick', 'lem', 'tell', 'ya.But', 'movie', 'made', '1936', 'opposed', '2010', ""n't"", '*show*', 'anything', 'story', 'more', 'engaging', 'intriguing.In', 'real', 'life', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'who', 'looked', 'old', 'when', 'was', '30s', 'was', '51', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'was', '43', 'movie', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'age', 'difference', 'greater', 'idea', 'being', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'character', 'getting', 'tired', 'old', 'husband', 'find', 'new', 'lover.Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'Little', 'little', 'begin', 'realize', 'Fran', 'Dodsworth', 'one', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat', 'selfish', 'manipulative', 'shallow', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Sam', 'Dodsworth', 'blind', 'eye', 'faults', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'not', 'her.Mary', 'Astor', 'only', '30', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'life', '21', 'years', 'younger', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'part', 'older', 'actually', 'is.What', 'find', 'interesting', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '30', '40', 'American-born', 'actresses', 'such', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Illinois', 'speak', 'such', 'way', 'sound', 'almost', 'English', 'Any', 'number', 'actresses', 'back', 'then', 'did', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'et', 'al', 'suppose', 'idea', 'was', 'make', 'sound', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'more', 'worldly', 'particular', 'movie', 'characteristic', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'character', 'down-home', 'no-nonsense', 'Midwesterner', 'more', 'American', 'contrast.One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'dreck', 'would', 'result', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'filmed', 'remake', 'classic', 'movie', 'Let', 'hope', 'never']",N/A
