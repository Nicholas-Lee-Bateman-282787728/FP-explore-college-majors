The premise seemed cool enough, and I like a couple people in the cast so I decided to rent it.It was entertaining, but not a good movie.  There is definitely no payoff for the audience in the story.  It kept me entertained, but I was unhappy with how it ended.  No one will be winning any acting awards for this one.  It seems to have been made on a tighter than normal budget.

1661833,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DVD5RE2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Brit Marling is really making a lot of herself and becoming one of those names to get excited over.  Between her work (in front and behind the camera) in films like &#8216;Another Earth&#8217; and &#8216;The Sound of My Voice&#8217;, she is clearly one of those &#8216;ones to watch&#8217; of this decade.  She&#8217;s certainly more interesting than some of the talentless &#8216;bodies&#8217; you see floating around magazine covers.  With her latest entry, Marling once again proves that she has the smarts to not only craft an original piece of work but also the talent to carry it on her shoulders.&#8216;The East&#8217; is possibly her most straightforward work so far, and so for that it may be deemed her least impressive and yet it is probably her most polished to date.  Where &#8216;The Sound of My Voice&#8217; felt somewhat avant-garde in tone, and &#8216;Another Earth&#8217; felt entirely indie, there is something very grounded about &#8216;The East&#8217;.  It feels very surefooted, which is a good thing, and even though the ending left me a tad underwhelmed (and yet, it was effective), there is a lasting presence here that is undeniable.&#8216;The East&#8217; tells the story of a young woman who is working for a private intelligence firm.  Her firm is hired to infiltrate a group of terrorists targeting companies who are putting the health of their fellow man at risk.  Under the alias of Sarah Moss, this woman finds herself being sucked into the world of The East, becoming part of their plans and their &#8216;jams&#8217; and eventually sympathizing with their mission.  The thing is, these kids aren&#8217;t just random punks looking to stir up trouble; they have legitimate axes to grind and, in a way, they are just looking out for the greater good.It doesn&#8217;t make it legal.&#8216;The East&#8217; excels in one area over all, and that is in the pitch perfect ensemble.  Every player here in uniformly great, with a few standouts (this could be Ellen Page&#8217;s best performance) and not a single sour note.  The brooding is kept at bay, and used only when needed, for there is so much brimming beneath the brood that it becomes important to play it just right.  Skarsgard is also very good here, betraying his good looks with something far more impactful.The film&#8217;s message is very much the same as the group it glamorizes, and in that effect it works rather well.  The fact remains that things like this are not uncommon (I&#8217;m talking conglomerates exploiting and endangering the rest of us) and sometimes it feels like the only thing to do is take matters into one&#8217;s own hand.  The film&#8217;s concluding twist is a smart one, even if it feels anticlimactic in a way (so subtle), because it adds a more realistic and admirable spin on the film&#8217;s message.  Violence does not beget violence, and so Sarah&#8217;s eventual decisions shed a glimmer of hope where bleakness reigns.I do wish that the clich&eacute;s regarding the cultish nature of The East weren&#8217;t so pronounced (the dinner scene was regrettable), but overall it&#8217;s a minor glitch.Like I said, this film is very polished.  The cinematography is beautiful, and adds to the film&#8217;s atmosphere.  The set pieces are memorable, especially that abandoned house (eerie) and the overall construction of the film&#8217;s themes are engaging and interesting.  Mostly though, &#8216;The East&#8217; serves as further proof that Brit Marling is the real deal.  She has range (sci-fi, cults, terrorists) and she understands how to build tension without resorting to histrionics or gruesome violence.I, for one, am anxious to see her become a huge star.",4,A darkly polished work&#8230;,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3681,"['Brit', 'Marling', 'really', 'making', 'lot', 'herself', 'becoming', 'one', 'names', 'get', 'excited', 'over', 'Between', 'work', 'front', 'camera', 'films', '8216', 'Earth', '8217', '8216', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', '8217', 'clearly', 'one', '8216', 'ones', 'watch', '8217', 'decade', '8217', 'certainly', 'more', 'interesting', 'talentless', '8216', 'bodies', '8217', 'see', 'floating', 'around', 'magazine', 'covers', 'latest', 'entry', 'Marling', 'once', 'again', 'smarts', 'not', 'only', 'craft', 'original', 'piece', 'work', 'also', 'talent', 'carry', 'shoulders.', '8216', 'East', '8217', 'possibly', 'most', 'straightforward', 'work', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'deemed', 'least', 'impressive', 'yet', 'probably', 'most', 'polished', 'date', 'Where', '8216', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', '8217', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'avant-garde', 'tone', '8216', 'Earth', '8217', 'felt', 'entirely', 'indie', 'something', 'very', 'grounded', '8216', 'East', '8217', 'very', 'surefooted', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'ending', 'left', 'tad', 'underwhelmed', 'yet', 'was', 'effective', 'lasting', 'presence', 'here', 'undeniable.', '8216', 'East', '8217', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'working', 'private', 'intelligence', 'firm', 'firm', 'hired', 'infiltrate', 'group', 'terrorists', 'targeting', 'companies', 'who', 'are', 'putting', 'health', 'fellow', 'man', 'risk', 'alias', 'Sarah', 'Moss', 'woman', 'being', 'sucked', 'world', 'East', 'becoming', 'part', 'plans', '8216', '8217', 'eventually', 'sympathizing', 'mission', 'thing', 'kids', 'aren', '8217', 'just', 'random', 'punks', 'looking', 'stir', 'up', 'trouble', 'have', 'legitimate', 'axes', 'grind', 'way', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'out', 'greater', 'good.It', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'make', '8216', 'East', '8217', 'excels', 'one', 'area', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'ensemble', 'Every', 'player', 'here', 'uniformly', 'great', 'few', 'standouts', 'could', 'be', 'Ellen', 'Page', '8217', 'best', 'performance', 'not', 'single', 'sour', 'note', 'brooding', 'kept', 'bay', 'used', 'only', 'when', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'brimming', 'brood', 'important', 'play', 'just', 'right', 'Skarsgard', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'betraying', 'good', 'looks', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'impactful.The', 'film', '8217', 's', 'message', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'group', 'effect', 'rather', 'well', 'fact', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'uncommon', '8217', 'talking', 'conglomerates', 'exploiting', 'endangering', 'rest', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'take', 'matters', 'one', '8217', 'own', 'hand', 'film', '8217', 'concluding', 'twist', 'smart', 'one', 'even', 'anticlimactic', 'way', 'so', 'subtle', 'more', 'realistic', 'admirable', 'spin', 'film', '8217', 's', 'message', 'Violence', 'not', 'beget', 'violence', 'so', 'Sarah', '8217', 'eventual', 'decisions', 'shed', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'where', 'bleakness', 'reigns.I', 'do', 'wish', 'clich', 'eacute', 'regarding', 'cultish', 'nature', 'East', 'weren', '8217', 'so', 'pronounced', 'dinner', 'scene', 'was', 'regrettable', '8217', 's', 'minor', 'glitch.Like', 'said', 'film', 'very', 'polished', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'film', '8217', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'memorable', 'especially', 'abandoned', 'house', 'eerie', 'overall', 'construction', 'film', '8217', 's', 'themes', 'are', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'Mostly', '8216', 'East', '8217', 'serves', 'further', 'proof', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'real', 'deal', 'range', 'sci-fi', 'cults', 'terrorists', 'how', 'build', 'tension', 'resorting', 'histrionics', 'gruesome', 'violence.I', 'one', 'am', 'anxious', 'see', 'become', 'huge', 'star']",N/A

Patricia Clarkson plays her firm's controller. Ellen Page plays a member of the group seeking answers from her parents as to why the corporate business they control by sitting as executive chairmen is illegally dumping toxic chemicals.

Eastwood,"[3, 4]","The majority of Americans know that our Congress is more than half full with ""lawmakers"" who are the corrupt tools of large corporations that make relatively large ""donations"" to them. Those who ""frack"" and pollute citizens' water supplies have a get-out-of-jail-free card, and those who spill oil on land or sea basically have much the same. Indeed many of us well remember that when BP caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a few years ago (a spill which has not yet been properly cleaned up), there were those is Congress who demanded that an apology be given ... to BP!And it is apparent to many of us that regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the EPA are often manipulated by members of Congress and by various wealthy corporate interests ... for the enrichment of the corporations (and members of Congress) rather than the protection of American citizens.THE EAST (2013), a Ridley Scott production with a liberal agenda, opens with disturbing images of water fowl and sea turtles covered in thick layers of oil and dying.Next, we are shown images of vigilantes ""punishing"" an oil executive by invading his lavish house and providing his personal property with a thick covering of black oil.In the plot of this well-made polemic, an athletic young woman (Brit Marling, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Zal Batmanglij) is assigned by her pro-corporation, anti-vigilante company to infiltrate the group responsible for such an outrage to an oil executive; she (with vast amounts of implausible good luck) is able to do so very quickly and easily. The questions arise: what IF she is expected to participate in ""terrorism"" that will hurt or kill somebody? what IF she is found out as a spy? what IF her sympathies are converted to the goals of these people she has been gathering evidence against?The range of ratings THE EAST has received thus far by nearly a hundred Amazon reviewers is almost typical of the views of similar percentages of voters in America. About 55 percent of American voters tend to view many corporations as greed-driven organizations that will put their profits first and the welfare and health of ordinary citizens last. And about 45 percent of American voters tend to believe that corporations are basically necessary things that should be protected at almost all costs, regardless of any harm they might do.During the course of this film viewers are invited to consider whether vigilantes are ever justified, whether the moral code of ""an eye for an eye"" is appropriate, or whether citizens should try to rely on our country's current system of laws and lawmakers. We see some diversity in the views of the vigilantes themselves, and towards the end of the film we see some polarization of views ... followed by the infiltrator's own chosen path for taking action.This is a film that is designed to make its audience Think (with a capital T) and Rethink (with a capital R). It does not present the answers for us.Chiefly because it is a vivid and largely successful prod towards finding a solution (or solutions) to the harms (plural) of corporate greed and Congressional corruption, if I were giving this film a letter grade, I would give it a solid ""A"". Its occasional plot-holes are annoying, but it is far, far more effective than PROMISED LAND, another recent polemical movie (starring Matt Damon and John Krasinski, who also co-scripted the film) that deals much too gently with the problems of fracking.",5,A VERY GOOD POLEMICAL MOVIE WITH A RATHER LAME TITLE,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3463,"['majority', 'Americans', 'know', 'Congress', 'more', 'half', 'full', 'lawmakers', 'who', 'are', 'corrupt', 'tools', 'large', 'corporations', 'make', 'relatively', 'large', 'donations', 'who', 'frack', 'pollute', 'citizens', 'water', 'supplies', 'have', 'get-out-of-jail-free', 'card', 'who', 'spill', 'oil', 'land', 'sea', 'basically', 'have', 'much', 'same', 'Indeed', 'many', 'well', 'remember', 'when', 'BP', 'caused', 'massive', 'oil', 'spill', 'Gulf', 'Mexico', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'spill', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'properly', 'cleaned', 'up', 'were', 'Congress', 'who', 'demanded', 'apology', 'be', 'given', 'BP', 'apparent', 'many', 'regulatory', 'agencies', 'such', 'FDA', 'EPA', 'are', 'often', 'manipulated', 'members', 'Congress', 'various', 'wealthy', 'corporate', 'interests', 'enrichment', 'corporations', 'members', 'Congress', 'rather', 'protection', 'American', 'citizens.THE', 'EAST', '2013', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'production', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'disturbing', 'images', 'water', 'fowl', 'sea', 'turtles', 'covered', 'thick', 'layers', 'oil', 'dying.Next', 'are', 'shown', 'images', 'vigilantes', 'punishing', 'oil', 'executive', 'invading', 'lavish', 'house', 'providing', 'personal', 'property', 'thick', 'covering', 'black', 'plot', 'well-made', 'polemic', 'athletic', 'young', 'woman', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Zal', 'Batmanglij', 'assigned', 'pro-corporation', 'anti-vigilante', 'company', 'infiltrate', 'group', 'responsible', 'such', 'outrage', 'oil', 'executive', 'vast', 'amounts', 'implausible', 'good', 'luck', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'quickly', 'easily', 'questions', 'arise', 'what', 'IF', 'expected', 'participate', 'terrorism', 'will', 'hurt', 'kill', 'somebody', 'what', 'IF', 'found', 'out', 'spy', 'what', 'sympathies', 'are', 'converted', 'goals', 'people', 'been', 'gathering', 'evidence', 'range', 'ratings', 'THE', 'EAST', 'received', 'thus', 'far', 'nearly', 'hundred', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'almost', 'typical', 'views', 'similar', 'percentages', 'voters', 'America', '55', 'percent', 'American', 'voters', 'tend', 'view', 'many', 'corporations', 'greed-driven', 'organizations', 'will', 'put', 'profits', 'first', 'welfare', 'health', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'last', '45', 'percent', 'American', 'voters', 'tend', 'believe', 'corporations', 'are', 'basically', 'necessary', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'protected', 'almost', 'costs', 'regardless', 'harm', 'might', 'do.During', 'course', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'invited', 'consider', 'vigilantes', 'are', 'ever', 'justified', 'moral', 'code', 'eye', 'eye', 'appropriate', 'citizens', 'should', 'try', 'rely', 'country', 'current', 'system', 'laws', 'lawmakers', 'see', 'diversity', 'views', 'vigilantes', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'polarization', 'views', 'followed', 'infiltrator', 'own', 'chosen', 'path', 'taking', 'action.This', 'film', 'designed', 'make', 'audience', 'Think', 'capital', 'T', 'Rethink', 'capital', 'R', 'not', 'present', 'answers', 'us.Chiefly', 'vivid', 'largely', 'successful', 'prod', 'towards', 'finding', 'solution', 'solutions', 'harms', 'plural', 'corporate', 'greed', 'Congressional', 'corruption', 'were', 'giving', 'film', 'letter', 'grade', 'would', 'give', 'solid', 'occasional', 'plot-holes', 'are', 'annoying', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'PROMISED', 'LAND', 'recent', 'polemical', 'movie', 'starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'also', 'co-scripted', 'film', 'deals', 'much', 'too', 'gently', 'problems', 'fracking']",N/A

1661858,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00DVD5RE2,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 1]","Actor/Screenwriter Brit Marling really has something on the ball. She's a remarkable performer, and she certainly has an ear for dialogue and creating realistic situations out of moments that could easily be made very melodramatic. And with co-writer and director Zal Batmanglij's THE EAST, Marling has certainly become a force to be reckoned with in independent cinema.THE EAST exists in a morally grey area about moral superiority and how it's acted upon. Sarah (Marling) is a rising star in a private security agency, whose agents are overseen by the fearsome yet relaxed Sharon (the excellent Patricia Clarkson). The agency represents major conglomerates all over the country, and an environmental/humanist activist group calling themselves The East have risen up and seem to be up to more than just chaining themselves to trees and occupying Wall Street as they commit acts of ""environmental terrorism"" against some of America's wealthiest citizens. Sarah is tasked with infiltrating the group, which she does through incredible guile and amazing use of tradecraft. She meets the charming and earthy leader Benji (Alexander Skarsgard), and his right-hand, the more volatile and angry Izzy (Ellen Page). As she goes deeper into the people in the group, they prove to be even more enigmatic the more she learns, and her mission to stop them becomes an internal conflict between her sense of justice and her personal morality. And, with all stories of this kind, she needs to make a choice between what's in her head and what's in her heart.If this were a larger budgeted film aimed at a more ""Hollywood"" audience, it would mark Marling's work in this film as someone who could easily be the next big thing, but this isn't that kind of film by design because there's no way that a more ""Hollywood"" studio would take on a film of this kind. The performances, particularly by Marling and Skarsgard, are extraordinary, but when it comes to Page, it seems that this role is a little rote for her. She's an wonderful actress and she really disappears effortlessly into the role of Izzy, but too many beats of this character hearken back to her breakout debut in David Slade's HARD CANDY. Another problem is the ending. I would have liked to have seen this film take a bigger risk with a more definitive ending. So much of the film exists in the grey area already, and the ending follows through on that thread, but it seems a little perfunctory.However, the rest of the film makes up for what the ending seems to be lacking for in staying power and creates more layers to the ongoing questions that need to be asked. Such as how most of us seem perfectly fine with the status quo despite the criminal activity being perpetrated by some of the wealthiest in our society. Are the members of The East terrorists? Are they misguided young people looking for a cause to believe in? Are our corporations solely interested in their bottom line that they would perpetrate what are truly crimes against humanity or does benevolence exist at all in the corporate world? These are certainly questions worth asking, and THE EAST will certainly polarize its audience on these ideas, but when it comes down to it, THE EAST works best when it's more of a concentrated character study that holds its characters in a grey area allowing us to make our own decisions.",4,"Taut, well-written, directed and acted activism drama/thriller.",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,3345,"['Actor/Screenwriter', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'really', 'something', 'ball', 'remarkable', 'performer', 'certainly', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'creating', 'realistic', 'situations', 'moments', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Zal', 'Batmanglij', 'THE', 'EAST', 'Marling', 'certainly', 'become', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'independent', 'cinema.THE', 'EAST', 'morally', 'grey', 'area', 'moral', 'superiority', 'how', 'acted', 'Sarah', 'Marling', 'rising', 'star', 'private', 'security', 'agency', 'agents', 'are', 'overseen', 'fearsome', 'yet', 'relaxed', 'Sharon', 'excellent', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'agency', 'major', 'conglomerates', 'country', 'environmental/humanist', 'activist', 'group', 'calling', 'East', 'have', 'risen', 'up', 'seem', 'be', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'chaining', 'trees', 'occupying', 'Wall', 'Street', 'commit', 'acts', 'environmental', 'terrorism', 'America', 'wealthiest', 'citizens', 'Sarah', 'tasked', 'infiltrating', 'group', 'incredible', 'guile', 'amazing', 'use', 'tradecraft', 'charming', 'earthy', 'leader', 'Benji', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'right-hand', 'more', 'volatile', 'angry', 'Izzy', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'deeper', 'people', 'group', 'prove', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'enigmatic', 'more', 'mission', 'stop', 'internal', 'conflict', 'sense', 'justice', 'personal', 'morality', 'stories', 'kind', 'make', 'choice', 'what', 'head', 'what', 'heart.If', 'were', 'larger', 'budgeted', 'film', 'aimed', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'would', 'mark', 'Marling', 'work', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', ""n't"", 'kind', 'film', 'design', 'way', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'would', 'take', 'film', 'kind', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Marling', 'Skarsgard', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'when', 'Page', 'role', 'little', 'rote', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'really', 'effortlessly', 'role', 'Izzy', 'too', 'many', 'beats', 'character', 'back', 'breakout', 'debut', 'David', 'Slade', 'HARD', 'CANDY', 'problem', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'take', 'bigger', 'risk', 'more', 'definitive', 'ending', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'grey', 'area', 'already', 'ending', 'thread', 'little', 'perfunctory.However', 'rest', 'film', 'up', 'what', 'ending', 'be', 'lacking', 'staying', 'power', 'more', 'layers', 'ongoing', 'questions', 'need', 'be', 'asked', 'Such', 'how', 'most', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'status', 'quo', 'criminal', 'activity', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'wealthiest', 'society', 'Are', 'members', 'East', 'terrorists', 'Are', 'misguided', 'young', 'people', 'looking', 'cause', 'believe', 'Are', 'corporations', 'solely', 'interested', 'bottom', 'line', 'would', 'perpetrate', 'what', 'are', 'truly', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'benevolence', 'exist', 'corporate', 'world', 'are', 'certainly', 'questions', 'asking', 'THE', 'EAST', 'will', 'certainly', 'polarize', 'audience', 'ideas', 'when', 'down', 'THE', 'EAST', 'best', 'when', 'more', 'concentrated', 'character', 'study', 'characters', 'grey', 'area', 'allowing', 'make', 'own', 'decisions']",N/A

However, don't expect an all loving, spiritual awakening type of film, it still rubs raw the ideals and expectations of the naive with brutal truths and discoveries.Zal Batmanglij wrote and directed a great film. While it is not his first outing in the directors chair, it is by far his most well polished work thus far.Brit Marling (""Arbitrage"") plays Jane, an operative for a very deep pocketed elite private investigation firm that is sent out to infiltrate the group as Sarah. What she finds is a well polished and close knit group of like minded people, most of which have a very personal interest in the anarchist movement that is The East.Alexander Skarsgrd (""True Blood"", ""Battleship"") completely sheds his inner vampire for this role, and does an extraordinary job portraying Benji, the cautious and scarred Zen like commander of this leaderless pack of renegades.Ellen Page (""Juno"", ""Inception"") takes hold of the reins of Izzy, a protective and very defiant young woman who does not take kindly to the uninvited introduction of Sarah into their little family.The actors do an absolutely outstanding job creating unique and likable characters. From Shiloh Fernandez (""Evil Dead"", ""Red Riding Hood"") as Luca, the motherly one of the group who brings Sarah in when she needs medical attention, to Toby Kebbel (""Wrath of the Titans"", ""RockNRolla"") as Doc, who struggles with his own physical limitations and provides the medical help that the group sometimes needs. There are zero weak links in the chain of actors in this film, even the supporting cast all do an outstanding job peeling back the curtains and giving the viewer a glimpse at what it is like to run rampant upon the corporate world with revenge and retribution fueling the fires of well conceived chaos.Most of the film takes place in and around an old half burned down home in the forest, which the group uses as it's temporary headquarters while the carry out their Jams (attacks). The cinematography is spot on and always finds a way to incorporate the surroundings, whether its peeling wallpaper or horses running across a meadow into the story to keep your eyes entertained and your mind thinking. What is important, what isn't?

1661880,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00DVD5RE2,M. Oleson,"[40, 45]","I first caught actress and screenwriter Brit Marling in a movie called ""Another Earth"" from a couple years ago.  Shortly thereafter she shows up in ""Sound of My Voice.""  In both cases she plays quiet, thoughtful young women with complicated personalities.  ""The East"" is her best role and her best film.  She plays an FBI-trained agent who is working for a private security firm headed by Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), a no BS CEO.Sarah/Jane is given the task of infiltrating an eco-terrorist group known as The East.  This is a big step up in Sarah's career and she relishes the assignment.  She's very good at her job and manages to get inside the secret group, which is headed by Benji (Alexander Skarsgard) an heir to a fortune, but ultimately disillusioned by corporate greed.  Ellen Page plays Izzy and like Benji, she seeks payback for corporate atrocities is necessary even if lives are at stake.While this sounds pretty cut and dry, Sarah using the alias Jane, begins to see the other side and why The East feel they must do what they do.  Evidence exists to see polluted lakes and water sources.  Drug companies produce unsafe compounds with little repercussions.  So now in most films, we would expect Sarah/Jane to flip sides, but Marling and her co-writer and director Zal Batmanglij don't make it so simple.Even after Sarah and Benji play advanced kissy-face, things aren't so easy for Sarah.

1661884,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DVD5RE2,Paul Allaer,"[16, 20]","""The East"" (2013 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Sarah Moss (played by Brit Marling). As the movie opens, a TV report comes on regarding the latest ""eco-terrorist"" attack by an outfit called The East, and we then see Sarah in discussions with the CEO (played by Patricia Clarkson) of Hiller Brood, a high-end security/intelligence firm. Sarah is tasked to go undercover and infiltrate The East, to gather up as much information as possible, and eventually bring this eco-terrorist cell down. Sarah manages very quickly to infiltrate the group and becomes part of it, eventually becoming close to the leader of them, Benji (played by Alexander Skarsgrd). At this point we're not even half-way into the movie, but to reveal more this plot-heavy film would surely ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie is brought by the same ""team"" that brought you last year's ""Sound Of My Voice"", with Zal Batmanglij as director and co-writer and Brit Marling as co-writer and co-producer (and of course co-starring). In fact there are a number of scenes in ""The East"" that reminded me immediately of ""Sound of My Voice"", when the cell does some ""group bonding"" but in reality it feels more cult-like. This is supposed to be a political thriller, but to me some of the 'bad stuff' that Big Pharma is accused of seems over-simplistic (chemical dumping every day at exactly 3 o'clock!). The movie is far more effective as a psychological thriller: will Sarah fall for Benji? Even the Hiller Brood CEO recognizes the danger (""we understand it's quite natural to bond, but don't ever get soft""). And who is playing/setting up who exactly? That tension plays strongly in the last 45 min. of the movie, with a couple of plot twists I hadn't expected (and that is not a complaint!). I suppose I should mention that both Alexander Skarsgrd and Ellen Page are part of The East group, but in reality I felt a bit sorry for them and the other performers, as they are simply blown away on the screen by Brit Marling. She seems to get better and better (last year in ""Sound of My Voice"" and equally excellent in ""Arbitrage"" in that Ivanka Trump-reminding role, and earlier this year in a smaller role in Robert Redford's ""The Company You Keep""). She is still not even thirty! Last but not least, any movie that plays The National's ""About Today"" in its soundtrack (it plays at a key moment in the second half), is quite alright in my book!The screening I saw this at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in late June, was surprisingly well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this.

There is no point in regurgitating the whole plot here. However, the premise is as follows &#8211;Our main protagonist Jane is an operative for a private intelligence firm Hiller Brood, and is assigned by her boss Sharon to infiltrate &#8216;The East&#8217; an underground anarchist co &#8211;operative who plan and carry out covert actions against corporations in an effort to bare/reveal their corruption and negligence. In her undercover role, and in-line with the ethos of the anarchist cell, she practices Freeganism. This entails the eating of recovered/eating food that has been thrown away. As Jane gets to know the group, her views are shown to change, as she is not immune to the cells message as well as the individual narratives of the group members. As the plot progresses there some rather interesting twists and turns to the story.For me there lots of symbolism in this film, some of which is quasi-religious such as the set up involving straight-jackets, where by, each member feeding each other as they are unable to feed themselves. It is interesting to note that Brit Marling &#8211; who plays Jane in the film, experienced first-hand how to hop trains and learned to sleep rough as well as practicing Freeganism. The East, is no espionage film as we know it and Jane uses the same field craft &#8211; disguise, tools of spy craft and a legend that holds up to the scrutiny of the cell. This is film whether you like it or not it raises many questions. The cell&#8217;s attack on a pharmaceutical company that sells flawed and dangerous medicine &#8211; is part based on a drug company that touted medication that lead to a number of suicides amongst patients that used it.

Soon as she assimilates, she becomes part of their ideological imprint spying on their actions yet doing her job. The film's approach is one that is conventional of the espionage thriller but without much of the action, thrills, and extreme intensity that is inherent in much of the Hollywood fare. Still, it is much of the grassroots, underground approach in the film that is a good feature which is due in part to Brit Marling and Zat Batmanglij living among the Occupy Wall Street protesters.But despite its origins and acclaim being a Sundance Film Festival favourite, the film suffers and drags a bit with a rather rudimentary approach of suspense (except the scenes where The East goes out to hunt for their suspects) for drama by focusing more on a romance, acknowledgment of strange encounters, and having some rather bland and stale characters (even the stereotypical head of the agency that sent the lady to do the mission) that could come out of a Demetri Martin skit of 'hipsterdom.'Ellen Page was never once convincing here nor is Peter Skarsgaard and Brit Marling but the themes of the film were and some of the satirical-like voiceovers and actions which are pretty much a stab at organisations like Greenpeace and PETA (which some love and some hate). The ending is not enough to suffice and the suspense sizzles out pretty quickly to where what was almost promising seems ordinary and stale like white bread. Certainly a nice take on the hypocrisy and odd mannerisms of extreme organisations but not enough to keep its head on its knees with suspense and intrigue. Some scenes steal it and so does the intriguing and mysterious trailer but that is not enough.If you want that cream on your pie, why not consider watching a documentary about this subject or the news. Well, at least I seen this film over the perceivably predictable The Company You Keep.
