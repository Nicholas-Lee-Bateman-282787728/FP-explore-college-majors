The (real) Georgia O'Keefe strikes me as a very strong, independent woman who loved New Mexico and was dedicated to her art.  I just didn't feel that in this film - it was more on her relationship with Stieglitz.  The film did show a few (too short) shots of the New Mexico landscape which is beautiful - I would have loved to see more of that and why she connected with that.

1315597,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0030T120A,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This film is primarily about the romantic and professional relationship between Georgia O'Keeffe and her much older husband, photographer Alfred Steiglitz. Joan Allen does an excellent job of portraying O'Keeffe and Jeremy Irons is equally good as Steiglitz. Their marriage and partnership was rocky, to say the least, and this film does a fairly good job of showing how the art world experienced Steiglitz was instrumental in helping his young wife obtain the publicity needed to launch her career in a highly competitive field. She was a talented young artist, but the guidance of Steiglitz helped bring her art to the collectors and curators needed to establish a career. Steiglitz left his wife of 30 years to marry O'Keeffe but she finds that his bohemian personal philosophy and attitudes toward extramarital affairs does not change just because he has a new young wife. The celebrated nude photographs of O'Keeffe are a critical portion of this film but it is hard to imagine that O'Keeffe really thought that her husband would not show these works in his gallery. They are both artists and realize the nude is a valid subject. This event and several other in the film made Steiglitz look a bit too much of a manipulator of his young wife. I suspect she was more sophisticated and worldly that the film portrayed her. The transition from New York to New Mexico is well done in the film and is very vivid in showing O'Keeffe discovering her own voice and vision in these wide open spaces. The film is more about their relationships than it is about his photography and her painting, thus it is not an art history documentary. But it does reveal much about this uniquely talented couple in an uneasy relationship that lasted for years.",4,A film more about their relationship than about their art,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,1740,"['film', 'primarily', 'romantic', 'professional', 'relationship', 'Georgia', ""O'Keeffe"", 'much', 'older', 'husband', 'photographer', 'Alfred', 'Steiglitz', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', ""O'Keeffe"", 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'equally', 'good', 'Steiglitz', 'marriage', 'partnership', 'was', 'rocky', 'say', 'least', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'art', 'world', 'experienced', 'Steiglitz', 'was', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'young', 'wife', 'obtain', 'publicity', 'needed', 'launch', 'career', 'highly', 'competitive', 'field', 'was', 'talented', 'young', 'artist', 'guidance', 'Steiglitz', 'helped', 'bring', 'art', 'collectors', 'curators', 'needed', 'establish', 'career', 'Steiglitz', 'left', 'wife', '30', 'years', 'marry', ""O'Keeffe"", 'bohemian', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'attitudes', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'not', 'change', 'just', 'new', 'young', 'wife', 'celebrated', 'nude', 'photographs', ""O'Keeffe"", 'are', 'critical', 'portion', 'film', 'hard', 'imagine', ""O'Keeffe"", 'really', 'thought', 'husband', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'works', 'gallery', 'are', 'artists', 'realize', 'nude', 'valid', 'subject', 'event', 'several', 'other', 'film', 'made', 'Steiglitz', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'manipulator', 'young', 'wife', 'suspect', 'was', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'worldly', 'film', 'portrayed', 'transition', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Mexico', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'very', 'vivid', 'showing', ""O'Keeffe"", 'discovering', 'own', 'voice', 'vision', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'film', 'more', 'relationships', 'photography', 'painting', 'thus', 'not', 'art', 'history', 'documentary', 'reveal', 'much', 'uniquely', 'talented', 'couple', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'lasted', 'years']",N/A

It won multiple awards as a TV performance.  Joan Allen BECOMES Georgia O'Keefe, the way George Scott became General Patton--I think now I will always see her as Georgia O'Keefe.  Jeremy Irons gives a great performance (as usual) as her much older husband, Alfred Stieglitz.  I have always admired Georgia O'Keefe but did not know details of her life until I watched this documentary.  It's a great look at her development as an artist, her personality, and her marriage.  Stieglitz was a pioneer of American photography, and his last great photographs seem to be his series of photographs of O'Keefe.The film is 1.5 hours long.  Subtitles are available in multiple languages and also (unusual for a TV-to-DVD production) there are previews of other films (most of them not so well-matched to this documentary) and a short ""making of"" special feature.  The film is not rated but if it were, it would probably rate a PG-13 for occasional partially-nude scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is high-quality, the dialog is good and of course, the paintings are beautiful: I just wish there had been even more examples of her art in the movie.

Bernabo,"[6, 7]","I know that Lifetime runs a lot of movies, because it is usually one of my wife's default channels on the television, but when I rented this DVD I did not know that ""Georgia O'Keeffe"" was had already aired and that she had already seen it.  She warned me that it was going to be depressing, which is invariably the case when you depict the life of a painting, amply proven by movies on everybody fromMichelangeloandVermeertoVan GoghandKahlo.  But no matter how wretched their existence might be, at least the rest of us got some beautiful paintings out of it.  As for this movie, it might be tempting to say it is too good for Lifetime, but the more important conclusion is that the network gets some serious points for putting together a biopic of this caliber.The script by Michael Cristofer is primarily about the tortured but all important relationship O'Keeffe (Joan Allen) had with photographerAlfred Stieglitz(Jeremy Irons), beginning with their first meeting when she discovers he is displaying her drawings in his gallery without her permission in 1916 and ending with his death in 1946.  In the opening lines, O'Keeffe declares, ""I don't trust words.  Words and I are not good friends at all.""  Stieglitz has words of plenty and despite her stated maxim, O'Keeffe falls for them.  Their life together is a painful collision of the professional and the personal, for every step he takes to advance her career comes at a price.  Part of the pain in watching this play out is that it takes O'Keeffe so long to figure out the price is too high, although it is clear that she and Stieglitz will only be parted by death (and even then).  I loved Stieglitz's egotistical argument that she is more important than he is, but that he is more than half of the relationship, because it so perfectly encapsulated his selfish view of a universe in which he is the brilliant giant gas bag at the center.For me the high point of the film is when O'Keeffe suffers a nervous breakdown while painting a mural for the ladies powder room at Radio City Music Hall.  I am unable to find anything that indicates whether or not what we see is a reproduction of the original mural (which was abandoned), the use of a later O'Keeffe painting or something original based on her work (or, in that case, who painted it).  But it is a gorgeous painting, the most memorable one seen on screen, and, of course, I would love to have a wall in our bedroom painted like that, to which I would then color coordinate everything else.  Beyond the art, the symbolic nature of the scene stands out as well.  I appreciate that director Bob Balaban's movie does not attempt to make any obvious connections between her life and her art, beyond the obvious shift in what she painted when she moved from New York City to northern New Mexico.  We also get to see a lot of O'Keeffe's art from the period covered, although we are rarely given the time to really enjoy it (that is what Internet searches are for, boys and girls).It will come as no surprise that Joan Allen turns in a riveting performance as the title character.  Allen is my pick for the best actress who has not yet won an Oscar, a state of affairs I thought would be rectified by ""The Upside of Anger,"" but she did not even get a nomination.  The common element I would draw between the two is that, in keeping with O'Keefe's opening lines, is what Allen can evoke with her silence.  Equally good is Jeremy Irons, who has a history of playing men who are less than nice, epitomized by his Oscar for ""Reversal of Fortune,"" although I think this performance is better.  Both were nominated for Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards for these roles.  In the end, I round up on this film because their fine performances outweigh any dissatisfaction I have with the relationship being depicted.  Judging proto-feminists from a contemporary perspective is almost always going to be inherently harsh.",5,Georgia O'Keeffe's muse turns out to be a devil in disguise,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,3929,"['know', 'Lifetime', 'lot', 'movies', 'usually', 'one', 'wife', 'default', 'channels', 'television', 'when', 'rented', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Georgia', ""O'Keeffe"", 'was', 'had', 'already', 'aired', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'warned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'depressing', 'invariably', 'case', 'when', 'depict', 'life', 'painting', 'amply', 'proven', 'movies', 'everybody', 'fromMichelangeloandVermeertoVan', 'GoghandKahlo', 'matter', 'how', 'wretched', 'existence', 'might', 'be', 'least', 'rest', 'got', 'beautiful', 'paintings', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'tempting', 'say', 'too', 'good', 'Lifetime', 'more', 'important', 'conclusion', 'network', 'serious', 'points', 'putting', 'together', 'biopic', 'caliber.The', 'script', 'Michael', 'Cristofer', 'primarily', 'tortured', 'important', 'relationship', ""O'Keeffe"", 'Joan', 'Allen', 'had', 'photographerAlfred', 'Stieglitz', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'beginning', 'first', 'meeting', 'when', 'displaying', 'drawings', 'gallery', 'permission', '1916', 'ending', 'death', '1946', 'opening', 'lines', ""O'Keeffe"", 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'words', 'Words', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'friends', 'Stieglitz', 'words', 'plenty', 'stated', 'maxim', ""O'Keeffe"", 'life', 'together', 'painful', 'collision', 'professional', 'personal', 'step', 'advance', 'career', 'price', 'Part', 'pain', 'watching', 'play', 'out', ""O'Keeffe"", 'so', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'price', 'too', 'high', 'clear', 'Stieglitz', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'parted', 'death', 'even', 'then', 'loved', 'Stieglitz', 'egotistical', 'argument', 'more', 'important', 'more', 'half', 'relationship', 'so', 'perfectly', 'encapsulated', 'selfish', 'view', 'universe', 'brilliant', 'giant', 'gas', 'bag', 'center.For', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'when', ""O'Keeffe"", 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'painting', 'mural', 'ladies', 'powder', 'room', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'am', 'unable', 'find', 'anything', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'reproduction', 'original', 'mural', 'was', 'abandoned', 'use', 'later', ""O'Keeffe"", 'painting', 'something', 'original', 'based', 'work', 'case', 'who', 'painted', 'gorgeous', 'painting', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'seen', 'screen', 'course', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'wall', 'bedroom', 'painted', 'would', 'then', 'color', 'coordinate', 'everything', 'else', 'art', 'symbolic', 'nature', 'scene', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'movie', 'not', 'attempt', 'make', 'obvious', 'connections', 'life', 'art', 'obvious', 'shift', 'what', 'painted', 'when', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'northern', 'New', 'Mexico', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'lot', ""O'Keeffe"", 'art', 'period', 'covered', 'are', 'rarely', 'given', 'time', 'really', 'enjoy', 'what', 'Internet', 'searches', 'are', 'boys', 'girls', '.It', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'riveting', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'Allen', 'pick', 'best', 'actress', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'won', 'Oscar', 'state', 'affairs', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'rectified', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'nomination', 'common', 'element', 'would', 'draw', 'two', 'keeping', ""O'Keefe"", 'opening', 'lines', 'what', 'Allen', 'can', 'evoke', 'silence', 'Equally', 'good', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'history', 'playing', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'nice', 'epitomized', 'Oscar', 'Reversal', 'Fortune', 'think', 'performance', 'better', 'were', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'awards', 'roles', 'end', 'round', 'up', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'outweigh', 'dissatisfaction', 'have', 'relationship', 'being', 'depicted', 'Judging', 'proto-feminists', 'contemporary', 'perspective', 'almost', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'inherently', 'harsh']",N/A
1315606,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B0030T120A,mk,"[15, 18]","Finally, something on Georgia O'Keeffe, a very good TV production, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. A bio emphasizing O'Keeffe and Stieglitz(got the spelling right) more than about her art or her beloved time in New Mexico. It does contain both, but, I think, in painfully lacking quantities.Summary: Unknown, turn of the century, artist Georgia O'Keeffe meets artsy, philandering, much older and married Alfred Stieglist who heavily promotes her to eventual fame and a fiery romance.  He, of course, cheats, mistreats and manipulates her in a self-centered, petulant, controlling way.  But she loves him, and spends the movie dealing with that while trying to discover her place in art.We've travelled the last 3 years to the Santa Fe/Taos area; hit the museums, enjoyed her artwork immensely; this year we visited Abiquiu and Ghost Ranch, saw her house there.  I wish they would have included more on that aspect of her life.The actors are very good.  Jeremy Irons is superb, brilliant! Joan Allen, whom my wife immediately said, ""She's too old!""(true, O'Keeffe met Stieglitz when she was 29, Allen is 53-but such is Hollywood) does a fine job showing pain and compassion.  Tyne Daly shines as her friend, but as much of the cast was way under-utilized.  This story needed desperately to be a mini-series, only 89 minutes?Researching their lives, the script appears, I would say, about 90% accurate.  There are some major points that the filmmakers, as they often do, took liberties with the truth. One example, in the movie she shows shock at him exhibiting his private nude photos of her, but what I've read, she actually knew about it, and they both agreed to just leave her name off the prints.It is, of course, true that Stieglitz was quite an accomplished photographer and definitely a putz; moreover, it is debatable whether she would have became famous without him.  I believe so; her art is just too amazing even if she had diasappeared to Texas!  Plus, her part in the relationship was quite odd and not necessarily so innocent or shocked as portrayed in the movie.  Her and her husband were quite bohemian and so were their other relationships; however, after Stieglitz' death, she pretty much told his long time mistress(the one that hung on) to get lost, took over his gallery proclaiming that the whole thing had been ""disgusting"".

I've been to Taos and the Ghost Ranch (from a distance).  I've seen the museum in Santa Fe and a special exhibit in Indianapolis so I don't know how I missed this movie.  Unfortunately, it is one of those made for TV movies originally shown on the Lifetime channel.  Nice performances by the always reliable Joan Allen and Jeremy Irons as Alfred Steiglitz almost save the movie.  While O'Keeffe and Steiglitz had a complicated arrangement, too much of the film's time deals with their relationship in an overly melodramatic way.  When the setting moves to New Mexico, the film comes alive only to sink again back in New York.  The New Mexico photography and the art itself keep the film from dragging too much, but overall it was disappointing.",3,Disappointing film about a great artist's life,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,847,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Ms.', ""O'Keeffe"", 'work', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'fascinating', 'independent', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Taos', 'Ghost', 'Ranch', 'distance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'museum', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'special', 'exhibit', 'Indianapolis', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'originally', 'shown', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'Nice', 'performances', 'always', 'reliable', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Alfred', 'Steiglitz', 'almost', 'save', 'movie', ""O'Keeffe"", 'Steiglitz', 'had', 'complicated', 'arrangement', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'time', 'deals', 'relationship', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'way', 'When', 'setting', 'moves', 'New', 'Mexico', 'film', 'alive', 'only', 'sink', 'again', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Mexico', 'photography', 'art', 'keep', 'film', 'dragging', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'was', 'disappointing']",N/A

Good story for those who like art and even those who dont but then again as I am an artist I am prejudiced.I lived in New Mexico for seven years from 1997 in and around the Santa Fe and Roswell area and so have visited sthe Okeefe museum and visited Ghost ranch where she lived for many years.  I am an artist also and she is my inspiration so I was very excited when this movie came out as it added another dimension to OKeefe as a young woman artist and not just the old woman we seem to see many pictures of.  The acting is terrific but I didnt think joan allen was the right choice as Okeefe as I didnt think she was intense enough in the role.

Even if you are not familiar with her paintings, it will move you in many ways.  Joan Allen's performance cannot be overstated, it was as if she literally slipped inside this talented woman in a way that is almost scary.  The art can bring tears to your eyes, and I must also give a shout out to Tyne Daly.  She fills all her roles with such clarity that there is no such thing as a small part when she embodies it.  Jeremy Irons is once again accomplished as the philandering husband/art dealer who is so selfish he cannot understand why he cannot have his cake and eat it too.  The scene where she stands up to him when he tries to take credit for her talent made me want to stand up and cheer.  Best of all, if you are not familiar with O'Keeffe's work, it will make you want to research and learn.
