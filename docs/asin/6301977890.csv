I would describe it as hypnotic (even without drugs, and I would recommend you watch this without drugs, at least the first time). I'm not generally a fan of bad films, but this isn't so much bad as worst.I first caught this on cable in the 80s and didn't know quite what to think of it. Watched it again in the early 90s, and was blown away. Have managed to find it in video stores several times since then and finally bought a Widescreen, 3D DVD (copied from the laserdisc) about 5 years ago. Still waiting for an official release, though.Loving this movie does not mean you need therapy. It means you're beyond therapy.",5,Brilliant,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,771,"['Did', 'title', 'Brilliant', 'Sorry', 'meant', 'absolute', 's***', 'transcend', 'own', 'hideousness', 'become', 'something', 'rather', 'amazing', 'would', 'describe', 'hypnotic', 'even', 'drugs', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'drugs', 'least', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'generally', 'fan', 'bad', 'films', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'worst.I', 'first', 'caught', 'cable', '80s', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'think', 'Watched', 'again', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Have', 'managed', 'find', 'video', 'stores', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'finally', 'bought', 'Widescreen', '3D', 'DVD', 'copied', 'laserdisc', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'Still', 'waiting', 'official', 'release', 'though.Loving', 'movie', 'not', 'mean', 'need', 'therapy', ""'re"", 'therapy']",N/A
287033,A2GEQ6I6M11JR2,6301977890,Fred Rayworth,"[5, 5]","I've always had a soft spot for this movie. We (my wife and I) first saw it in the early eighties and loved it. What makes this movie so special was that it was filmed in Spain (for the most part) and that is where we lived at the time. That scene where Tony Anthony walks down that passageway underneath that waterfall is where we used to walk. Driving down Paseo Del Prado and then the scenery in Madrid as they go to the museum gave us a thrill. When they went to the snow to get the drunk, that was Navacerrada, a ski resort we used to visit all the time even in the summer.The second thing I like about this movie is that it is so awful it is great. Sort of like a Plan 9 for the Indiana Jones set. You can see the string holding up the props that are supposed to be 3-D. Shoving everything into the camera unnecessarily is really dumb but cool. The plot is ok but there are only three crowns (like a previous reviewer pointed out) and the dialogue is only a notch above Plan 9. Still, it was an absorbing story that had us hooked at that time. I had a recording of the movie and lost it over the years. Just found a copy in a video store and rented it. They would not sell it to me though. I tried to look up a history of the movie and there is not much out there. It seems like Treasure was Tony Anthony's last movie as his movie history cuts off at that point.Overall, if you like cheesy Mystery Science Theater type movies, this one is for you! Highly recommended.",5,The Ultimate in Cheese,1027123200,"07 20, 2002",2002,1473,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'movie', 'wife', 'first', 'saw', 'early', 'eighties', 'loved', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', 'Spain', 'most', 'part', 'where', 'lived', 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'Tony', 'Anthony', 'walks', 'down', 'passageway', 'waterfall', 'where', 'used', 'walk', 'Driving', 'down', 'Paseo', 'Del', 'Prado', 'then', 'scenery', 'Madrid', 'go', 'museum', 'gave', 'thrill', 'When', 'went', 'snow', 'get', 'drunk', 'was', 'Navacerrada', 'ski', 'resort', 'used', 'visit', 'time', 'even', 'summer.The', 'second', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'awful', 'great', 'Sort', 'Plan', '9', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'set', 'can', 'see', 'string', 'holding', 'up', 'props', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', '3-D', 'Shoving', 'everything', 'camera', 'unnecessarily', 'really', 'dumb', 'cool', 'plot', 'ok', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'crowns', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'dialogue', 'only', 'notch', 'Plan', '9', 'Still', 'was', 'absorbing', 'story', 'had', 'hooked', 'time', 'had', 'recording', 'movie', 'lost', 'years', 'Just', 'found', 'copy', 'video', 'store', 'rented', 'would', 'not', 'sell', 'tried', 'look', 'up', 'history', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'Treasure', 'was', 'Tony', 'Anthony', 'last', 'movie', 'movie', 'history', 'cuts', 'off', 'point.Overall', 'like', 'cheesy', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', 'type', 'movies', 'one', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

287036,A226HQJ6IO0CQC,6301977890,M. Okada,"[1, 2]","I saw this film in 1983 and I loved it.  Some 15 minutes of this film have been posted on You-Tube and I can't believe how much I remember, even though it was 25 years ago that I saw it.  I particularly remember how good the soundtrack music was. (no wonder--the composer is none other than Morricone!)  I thought the music sounded like Wagner's Tannhauser Overture and whenever I hear that piece I think of the Treasure of the 4 Crowns.  This is the last 3D film made that anybody can remember, until the awful Spy-Kids in 3d and the recent Beowulf.  According to Wikipedia, this film was rushed into production by Cannon films (remember them?) after the success of ""Comin at Ya"".  I remember taking the bus down Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles.  Cannon films had a building at the intersection of Wilshire and La Cienega.  After a while, the Cannon logo disappeared and was replaced with ""Pathe Films"".  After a while, another name appeared on the building, so a lot of turmoil must have been taking place in the film industry during the 1980's (the era of the VHS tape and before the internet).
