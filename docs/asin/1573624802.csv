It is not necessarily the best movie I have seen or what I think is the best movie, everyone has their own opinion of what is the best. To me this is a fun twist to a movie about two teenage boys, One turning into a Vampire and the other mistaken for a vampire. The Teenage vampire being stocked by a vampire trainer and his friend is being stocked by two vampire killers. The parents of the vampire thinks he is gay, but is not and the girl he wants finally goes out on a date with him.

Then, at other times, it is stagnant. I found too much inconsistency when it came to the old traditions of Vampirism as shown in the movie. The biggest obvious rule-breaker is that Jeremy Capello, played by the usually gosh awful Robert Sean Leonard, is able to withstand the sunlight when as a vampire. Another rule-breaker is that he was supposed to possess super human strength yet couldn't break through the windows of a car. You know, when the film ended, it becomes apparent that Jeremy will never revert back to a human being, so basically, he is pretty much stuck being as a vampire. So, that means he has to convert everybody else around him because they feel envy? What else...I thought Evan Mirand did a nice job of channeling the same energy that makes Billy Jacoby and Oliver Platt who they are personality-wise. The movie did suffer greatly as soon as Robert Sean Leonard started to look deathly pale. Somehow, the momentum started to deaden. Then, it was getting boring as I saw more of the Professor and his assistant acting like idiots. It would be nice if they could be a bit smarter than that.

I've seen it around a hundred times, and it never loses anything.Jeremy Capello has a bit of a problem. He goes on a grocery delivery and meets a beautiful woman who invites him to come back to her house at midnight. A teenage boy with hormones all-a-rage wouldn't turn her down, that's for sure! He meets her, and she bites his neck just before a madman breaks the door down and runs him out.The next day, he is approached by a man who claims that the woman was a vampire, and that he would soon be turning himself. Of course, Jeremy doesn't believe his new 'vampire advisor', until he starts to notice the changes himself.This film is an 80's comedy, and is filled with great 80's music. The acting is surprisingly good, even though the film is full of no-name actors (except for one or two). Don't sit down expecting Oscar material and you might just enjoy this one.

But, there are two problems.  The first is that it's still in Full Frame instead of Widescreen.  Why go through the motions of putting this great comedy out in only Full Screen?  Second, the disc cover indicates it has a 5.1 Dolby sound audio.  This is a lie.  I just checked the channels and they are not separated properly like an true 5.1 DVD.  Instead, channel one through three are all the same - music, sound effects and dialog mixed together.  If this was an actual 5.1 disc, channel one would be music only, channel two sound effects with a bit of music and the third what you hear in the film.  This situation really disappointed me since I've been trying to complete the soundtrack to this film for quite awhile now and had high hopes to get the needed songs from the 5.1 audio.

But Jeremy is strangely drawn to Darla Blake - a baritone sax player in the band and not the type of girl that usually leads to the sorts of dreams that Jeremy has been having about her.Things start to get strange when Jeremy's dream about Darla is interrupted by a strange woman.  Even weirder, the next day when out delivering groceries, Jeremy discovers this strange woman is the new delivery recipient on his grocery route.  After her cat has scratched his finger, she first licks, then sucks on his finger and invites him back to her house that night at midnight ... I'm sure you can see where this is going.  Needless to say, there is a crazed vampire killer with his bumbling assistant; a vampire ""counselor"" sent to help Jeremy adjust to his new life (played by the very talented Rene Aberjonois of ""Deep Space Nine"" fame) and, of course, a bevy of beautiful vampire women.

With the help of his vampire advisor, Modoc, Jeremy Capello learns the ins and outs of being a modern vampire, from buying pig's blood at an all-night butcher's shop to avoiding the local slayer-wannabes (in this case, the always great David Warner). It wouldn't be so difficult for Jeremy if he wasn't trying to win the heart of a certain girl at school, and if he didn't have to worry about his best friend being slain by a vampire hunter who is after the wrong guy all-together.Ah, how to describe this gem of a film called ""My Best Friend is a Vampire"". It's a 1980's classic, if you liked the goofy supernatural comedies of the '80's. I'm a Teen Wolf fanatic myself, and I always saw this 1987 flick as the vampire answer to TW. It's no ""Fright Night"". In fact, it's not scary at all, but it's a lot of cheesy '80's fun. Very dated, but very enjoyable. But I honestly do not get Jeremy's attraction to the androgynous girl at school rather than the gorgeous cheerleader who was desperate for his bod (for some reason). After seeing the flick, I don't think it was her personality, so I really don't get it, ha. Though, it probably relates to the film's themes on subjects like sexual identity and activity, teen angst, prejudice, etc..., all that heavy '80's teen stuff. Actually, it particularly plays as a metaphor on homosexuality, though one can also simply view this as a fun vampire click if you don't want to think too hard. This movie is a great flashback fun-flick, especially if you like '80's comedies or '80's vampire flicks. Not to be confused with the early-Jim Carrey vampire comedy, ""Once Bitten"", which, frankly, I'm not sure I've ever really seen in its entirety yet. Gotta remedy that sometime. This DVD release is severely lacking, but could be a lot worse. It's fullscreen and the only bonus feature is an okay triva track. The trailer at least would have been a great inclusion. Still, I'm just glad this one made it onto DVD. There are many others I can think of that still need to get that far, or need to go back into print.",4,Fun '80's Supernatural Comedy Flashback,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2218,"['Houston', 'teen', 'world', 'turned', 'upside-down', 'when', 'woman', 'recently', 'attempted', 'have', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'was', 'vampire', 'now', 'one', 'too', 'help', 'vampire', 'advisor', 'Modoc', 'Jeremy', 'Capello', 'ins', 'outs', 'being', 'modern', 'vampire', 'buying', 'pig', 'blood', 'all-night', 'butcher', 'shop', 'avoiding', 'local', 'slayer-wannabes', 'case', 'always', 'great', 'David', 'Warner', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'Jeremy', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'win', 'heart', 'certain', 'girl', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'best', 'friend', 'being', 'slain', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'who', 'wrong', 'guy', 'all-together.Ah', 'how', 'describe', 'gem', 'film', 'called', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Vampire', '1980', 'classic', 'liked', 'goofy', 'supernatural', 'comedies', ""'80"", ""'m"", 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'fanatic', 'myself', 'always', 'saw', '1987', 'flick', 'vampire', 'answer', 'TW', 'Fright', 'Night', 'fact', 'not', 'scary', 'lot', 'cheesy', ""'80"", 'fun', 'Very', 'dated', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Jeremy', 'attraction', 'androgynous', 'girl', 'school', 'rather', 'gorgeous', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'was', 'desperate', 'bod', 'reason', 'seeing', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'personality', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ha', 'probably', 'film', 'themes', 'subjects', 'sexual', 'identity', 'activity', 'teen', 'angst', 'prejudice', 'etc', 'heavy', ""'80"", 'teen', 'stuff', 'Actually', 'particularly', 'metaphor', 'homosexuality', 'one', 'can', 'also', 'simply', 'view', 'fun', 'vampire', 'click', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'great', 'flashback', 'fun-flick', 'especially', 'like', 'comedies', 'vampire', 'flicks', 'Not', 'be', 'confused', 'early-Jim', 'Carrey', 'vampire', 'comedy', 'Once', 'Bitten', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'really', 'seen', 'entirety', 'yet', 'Got', 'ta', 'remedy', 'sometime', 'DVD', 'release', 'severely', 'lacking', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'worse', 'fullscreen', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'okay', 'triva', 'track', 'trailer', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'inclusion', 'Still', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'one', 'made', 'DVD', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'think', 'still', 'need', 'get', 'far', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'print']",My Best Friend Is a Vampire VHS
