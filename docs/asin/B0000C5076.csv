The hero actually is nice and the heroine has a lot to think about. She is engaged to someone whom her upper-crust family expects her to marry. However, when she meets the hero, she realizes that she doesn't love her fiance nor does she marry him. There is a twist after the heroine breaks the engagement. This movie's plot is predictable in some ways just like any other, but some of the characters are not. It's setting is international and it has a delightful edginess. What I like about this movie, also, is that the characters could be for real and not just some body that looks good on screen. They are not Hollywood's ideal for movies. One can really identify and empathize with these characters.",5,Just enjoy!,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,813,"['Mixed', 'reviews', 'usually', 'mean', 'movie', 'book', 'CD', 'worth', 'investigating', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'hero', 'actually', 'nice', 'heroine', 'lot', 'think', 'engaged', 'someone', 'whom', 'upper-crust', 'family', 'marry', 'However', 'when', 'hero', ""n't"", 'love', 'fiance', 'marry', 'twist', 'heroine', 'engagement', 'movie', 'plot', 'predictable', 'ways', 'just', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'setting', 'international', 'delightful', 'edginess', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'also', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'not', 'just', 'body', 'good', 'screen', 'are', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'ideal', 'movies', 'One', 'can', 'really', 'identify', 'empathize', 'characters']",N/A

But it could easily have been worse too.  We've all seen examples.The love scene that drove one reviewer below to distraction is minimal, PG-level.  Anybody who is bothered by a love scene as vanilla as this should stay away from love stories.The other problem with this movie is the script (or maybe the novel--which I haven't read).  We needed to see that she was about to marry the wrong man, not just be told so by a friend.  We needed to fear for her and hope that she would avoid it before it was too late.Also, the behavior of the new man could have been less nudgey.  It was the wrong approach.  The audience needed to want them to get together before she relented.  And that would have solved the problem of convincing the audience that she was attracted to him.  As it is, she appears to just fall into it with an ""Oh well, why not?"" attitude.The scenes of Venice were brief but nice.  They've certainly cleaned up the city since I was there and photographed it in 1979.  Ireland was also nicely rendered.  The depiction of the Balkans was stark and the people convincing.  It's rare that the public gets to see such an honest presentation of the consequences of multiculturalism.Bottom line: This is a movie worth having, especially for the price.",3,"not great, but worth it",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,1376,"['true', 'casting', 'two', 'leads', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'alone', 'could', 'have', 'made', '4-star', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'too', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'examples.The', 'love', 'scene', 'drove', 'one', 'reviewer', 'distraction', 'minimal', 'PG-level', 'Anybody', 'who', 'bothered', 'love', 'scene', 'as', 'vanilla', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'love', 'stories.The', 'other', 'problem', 'movie', 'script', 'maybe', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'needed', 'see', 'was', 'about', 'marry', 'wrong', 'man', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'told', 'so', 'friend', 'needed', 'fear', 'hope', 'would', 'avoid', 'was', 'too', 'late.Also', 'behavior', 'new', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'nudgey', 'was', 'wrong', 'approach', 'audience', 'needed', 'want', 'get', 'together', 'relented', 'would', 'have', 'solved', 'problem', 'convincing', 'audience', 'was', 'attracted', 'just', 'fall', 'Oh', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'scenes', 'Venice', 'were', 'brief', 'nice', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'cleaned', 'up', 'city', 'was', 'there', 'photographed', '1979', 'Ireland', 'was', 'also', 'nicely', 'rendered', 'depiction', 'Balkans', 'was', 'stark', 'people', 'convincing', 'rare', 'public', 'see', 'such', 'honest', 'presentation', 'consequences', 'multiculturalism.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', 'especially', 'price']",N/A

Janine Turner, hair long here, whom I remember from Northern Exposure, plays an engaged woman on a business trip in Venice.  She meets and is pursued by a handsome Irish journalist.  They have a fling; she tells him that's it; she flies back to be with her so-so fiance.  Of course, they are two fated lovers destined to be together again with lots of conflict thrown in.I like the on location scenes shot in Venice.  Super.  What hurt the movie for me is that I didn't care for or like the characters.  She lies and cheats; she's superficial and self-centered.  She and her girlfriend practically gloat over the affair she had in Venice that is until her fiance shows up, whom she's determined to marry because he's her future, even though she obviously doesn't love him or respect him.Her lover, when he first meets her in Italy, chases after her like a won't be put off Casanova, trying to say all the right things so as to win her interest and, hopefully, her bed.  (The sex scenes are PG TV like.)  He neglects his daughter since he's gone all the time and threatens her with the fact that he's a war correspondant, and she may end up fatherless.I quess one could see this as a tale of two flawed, very human people who discover true love, and grow with their experiences.

The squealing and giggling never rang true, the love story was sooooo predictable. I just can't see why anyone would love the story itself. Not to mention, she's a cheat, a liar...he's leaving his daughter alone with his mom even though he's away enough (as a reporter) already.Aside from that, it's totally worth seeing if you want to see Italy.

""A Secret Affair"" stars Janine Turner (of Northern Exposure fame) and Irish actor Paudge Behan as two people who meet by chance in Venice, and fall in love. Janine Turner's character is engaged in the movie, and the story follows the pair's romance as the female lead slowly realizes that she is not in love with her fiance ( a relationship built on duty more than love). But things get complicated when the male lead's character (who plays a television reporter) gets sent on a dangerous mission to the Balkans and is kidnapped.The plot is quite threadbare really, but this is one of those romances that you can just watch and enjoy, without thinking too much about the plot or even character development - though to be fair, the female lead's character is fleshed out quite credibly by Janine Turner, showing viewers a woman who is initially afraid to acknowledge her own desires and needs, but who eventually breaks free of the demands placed on her by her parents and fiance, and strikes out on her own. The cinematography of Venice and Ireland is beautiful too. Compared to the book this is based on,A Secret Affair, I'd rate the movie better.
