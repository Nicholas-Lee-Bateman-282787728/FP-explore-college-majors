680989,A3S3QZF1DG4VAO,B00005RYRI,Alex,"[3, 4]","This direct-to-video release stars Dean Cain as Max Hooper, a professional jewel thief.  He agrees to do one last heist for an unknown source.  However, things don't go as planned when a fire starts in the building that Max is working in.  He now has to decide whether to keep working and retrieve the data information he was originally hired to get, or to help rescue the people trapped inside the building as the fire spreads.  Dean Cain does a decent job playing his character, a man with a major moral dilemma.  The visual effects are OK, but I think it's the good performances by the actors that help make this movie stand out from other direct-to-video titles.  I definitely recommend this title for the next time you are looking for a decent movie rental.",3,Decent action movie that is worth the rental!,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,762,"['direct-to-video', 'release', 'stars', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Max', 'Hooper', 'professional', 'jewel', 'thief', 'do', 'one', 'last', 'heist', 'unknown', 'source', 'However', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'when', 'fire', 'building', 'Max', 'working', 'now', 'decide', 'keep', 'working', 'retrieve', 'data', 'information', 'was', 'originally', 'hired', 'get', 'help', 'rescue', 'people', 'trapped', 'building', 'fire', 'spreads', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'man', 'major', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'OK', 'think', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'direct-to-video', 'titles', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'title', 'next', 'time', 'are', 'looking', 'decent', 'movie', 'rental']",N/A

680996,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005RYRI,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","Sure, FIRETRAP is loaded with cliches and improbably stupid people (such as the janitor who fights the fire with a broom and opens the hazardous materials door), but the movie with its CGI created fire, is an entertaining and engrossing &quot;disaster&quot; flick.  Dean Cain who will probably always look like an overgrown boy does his role well.  The biggest kudo goes to the screenwriter who decided to make a stereotypical character a little more human and realistic:  James Storm's role as the owner of the company is not your typical head honcho.  He helps rescue people on more than one occasion; he is a man who acts and is not afraid to get down and dirty; and he has a fierce and commendable loyalty to his company.  Storm (who once played Gerard Stiles on Dark Shadows) gives it his best and carries a large portion of the movie's heroics.  His lover (Lori Petty)also goes against type in that she is not the hot little tamale his secretary Traci (with an I) is.  Mel Harris (much better here than in the more recent Hangman's Curse) plays his wife who hands him his divorce papers at a special emergency meeting of the company.  Her fluctuation between good and bad works well and Harris carries it off.  Perennial bad guy Richard Tyson is flaccid and ineffectual in the early part of the film, but manages to become a vital force in the last third of the movie.  Vanessa Angel (Camouflage, Sabertooth) once again gets a role another actress could have done much better.  She must really know someone in the industry!All in all, FIRETRAP is an enteraining Towering Inferno for the digital age.",4,CAIN PROVES ABLE,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,1605,"['Sure', 'FIRETRAP', 'loaded', 'cliches', 'improbably', 'stupid', 'people', 'such', 'janitor', 'who', 'fire', 'broom', 'hazardous', 'materials', 'door', 'movie', 'CGI', 'created', 'fire', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'quot', 'disaster', 'quot', 'flick', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'look', 'overgrown', 'boy', 'role', 'well', 'biggest', 'kudo', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'decided', 'make', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'human', 'realistic', 'James', 'Storm', 'role', 'owner', 'company', 'not', 'typical', 'head', 'honcho', 'rescue', 'people', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'down', 'dirty', 'fierce', 'commendable', 'loyalty', 'company', 'Storm', 'who', 'once', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Stiles', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'best', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'heroics', 'lover', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'also', 'type', 'not', 'hot', 'little', 'tamale', 'secretary', 'Traci', 'Mel', 'Harris', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'more', 'recent', 'Hangman', 'Curse', 'wife', 'who', 'divorce', 'papers', 'special', 'emergency', 'meeting', 'company', 'fluctuation', 'good', 'bad', 'works', 'well', 'Harris', 'off', 'Perennial', 'bad', 'guy', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'flaccid', 'ineffectual', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'become', 'vital', 'force', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'Camouflage', 'Sabertooth', 'once', 'again', 'role', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'must', 'really', 'know', 'someone', 'industry', 'FIRETRAP', 'enteraining', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'digital', 'age']",N/A
