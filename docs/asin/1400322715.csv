167755,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,1400322715,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[17, 24]","I don't always agree with Dinesh D'Souza, but this film is truly masterful. It takes on a very controversial, indeed, hollow, president, and puts some flesh on the skeleton.Who shaped Obama's thinking, where do his ideas come from, what does he really hope to accomplish, what are his goals, and are those goals in sync with the needs of America and its people, or its democratic ideals?I never liked Obama. I never trusted him, and I did not vote for him in 2008.But for all the reasons I had before, this film added new ones, without a single mean-spirited or unkind word (as another reviewer noted). What viewers get here are facts, pure and simple, most of them taken straight out of the President's ""own"" memoir, albeit one that we now know was ghost written by his friend, former Weather Underground bomber Bill Ayers.What D'Souza brings to the discussion is the unique perspective of an Indian-born, naturalized American, one who loves America for everything that it has given to the world, precisely because it is developed, and wealthy, and strives to educate all men and women fairly, and because its capitalist economic model is the one that has finally given promise to India, and China, and all other former ""third world"" countries that have understood that socialism simply does not work.Die hard Obama fans will not like this movie. But they ought to watch it anyway: There is a great deal of calm, collected thinking given here, along with interviews of people who knew Obama's father, his grandfather, his mother, his communist mentor Frank Marshall Davis --- and Obama himself during his university years.This film is food for serious thought. Do we want a nation invested in a growing and expanding economy that can support everyone willing to support himself, or do we want a basket case welfare state bankrupted by its monumental and fast-accelerated accumulation of $15 to $20 trillion dollar debts?In the laws of physics, gravity always pulls us back to earth.When it comes to finance, no household can long survive that outspends its earnings ten times over. No nation is exempt from economic law, either.People who love, and think they know Obama may be very surprised by what they see here.

Watching over the years, how many of these ideals have become reality today in our modern world has been very sobering. So when O came on the scene, I was very wary of his past associations. I knew a lot about his mentor and sponsor Bill Ayres, the former domestic terrorist. Though this material has been available from day one, no one has put it together quite like Gerald Molen, Dinesh D'Souza and John Sullivan. It makes the reading of O's mindset clear as a bell.

167773,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,1400322715,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[5, 22]","---------------------------------------------------------------""2016: Obama's America""(Lionsgate, 2012)---------------------------------------------------------------Released in theatrical distribution during the 2012 presidential primary season, ""Obama's America"" was touted as a surprise ""hit"" movie, making several million dollars at the box office, a success that for some was taken as proof of the validity of the film's somewhat questionable political assertions.The film is an adaptation and update of author Dinesh D'Souza's partisan tract of the same name, and it follows the same lazy, disjointed pseudo-intellectualism as the book, arguing that Obama's ""colonial"" heritage (his African ancestry) predetermined his supposed reflexive anti-Americanism and supposed relentless efforts of undermine American global interests. D'Souza propagates various Fox News/Tea Party myths about Obama's presidency, such as the mythical ""apology tour"" to the Middle East, etc. etc. and attempts to bolster this with a penny-ante pop-psychology character profile which posits that Obama's (made-up) daddy issues have led him to be some sort of covert dashiki-wearing Third World militant Mau-Mauist who somehow snookered his way into the White House and is now leading us to ruin... on purpose.D'Souza attempts to project a well-measured intellectual veneer over what is clearly a bunch of partisan twaddle. But whereas the book seemed insidious and slightly seditious, the movie just feels muddled and poorly produced, in many parts bafflingly amateurish. For example, the sound mix is terrible -- in some scenes the incidental music competes with and even drowns out D'Souza's narration: is this on purpose, to distract from the intellectual paucity of his arguments, or was it just poorly mixed?Likewise, the visual imagery is revealing, particularly in clumsy scenes such as the sequence in which D'Souza argues that racism in America is a thing of the past, merely a vestigial paranoia of activists such as Rev. Jesse Jackson: while D'Souza struggles to keep the smirking tone out of his voice, onscreen we see a beer-ad scenario in which a black guy sits down at the bar next to some white guys, and they get up and walk away, leaving the sad man to sulk alone on his stool, rejected by the dominant culture. But, surprise! Really they were just going to the other room so they could get the cake for Black Guy's surprise party: the whole bar bursts into song and smiles: they love him! There's no racial barrier at all. Subtle, huh?The rest of the cinematography is more or less loosely-assembled stock footage: the producers seem to feel that pointing a camera in front of something, anything at all, will lend credibility to the narrative. If D'Souza is ""exploring"" Obama's childhood sojourn into anticolonialism, it is sufficient to shoot a bunch of street scenes of traffic in Indonesia; the visuals don't have to prove anything, they're just placeholders that don't interrupt the flow of D'Souza's laughably thin narrative.This film will have a very, very short shelf life, and indeed is probably outlived its expiration date. To the extent that it has historical value, it is a very revealing document of the far-right's xenophobic fear of otherness and inability to reconcile America's relationship to the rest of the world. Asians, Africans -- even Hawaiians -- give D'Souza the willies, or at least he is willing to use their ""otherness"" as a way to stir up distrust for the President among his nativist American audience. I won't presume to psychoanalyze D'Souza's own issues as an immigrant American (he continually attempts to draw false analogies between his experiences and Obama's) since that seems like a red herring to me.  Because he is a neocon political propagandist, it's hard to tell how much of what he writes and says is something he actually cares about, and how much is just him trying to find some meager foothold to propagandize against ""the other side."" Perhaps a better tack to follow is the technical weakness in his arguments: there's just no ""there"" there.The film is more useful than the book because of the sad visual imagery of the bookish D'Souza, clearly uneasy in his body and in his role as an interviewer, as he sits down with a series of largely inconsequential people: a guy in Kenya, some people who vaguely knew Obama in Hawaii, a pinch-faced phony expert who claims Obama is a communist, etc. D'Souza clearly thinks there are a lot of ""gotcha moments"" in these interviews, but there just aren't. There's nothing substantive to any of them, just a bunch of hearsay and unsupported though strident assertions about Obama and his supposed motivations. Hyper-partisans will find comfort and self-contained intellectual reinforcement in this film; people who have never heard of or considered the history of colonialism might believe that the footage of some guy in Africa calmly discussing how Europeans exploited his homeland as proof of some crazy radicalism that's beyond the pale of reason, but anyone who's been paying attention since 1945 will find this all pretty ho-hum. It is, however, a window into the insecurities and obsessions of the current-day American Right.Still, it's depressing that the neocons are trying to re-litigate history, and reverse commonsense understanding of how the balance of global power has shifted since the breakup of the British and continental empires, and equally depressing that such loose, facile, pseudo-intellectual partisan hackery has found traction with so many Americans. Perhaps more dispiriting is the sight of a vigorous, energetic person such as D'Souza devoting himself to a project which at its core is hollow and false. Like fellow media figures such as Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, D'Souza surely knows what he's saying isn't true, but he says it because it serves a raw, blunt political purpose, to further the goals of his ideology. It's an age-old debate, whether the ends should be consistent with the means: can you achieve a good, honorable victory using deceptive, unfair tactics? The American Right clearly no longer cares: they just want to win, and perhaps more importantly they want to defeat their foes. They relish combat and yearn for complete, absolute victory, and this seems to matter more to them than actual problem solving, comity or a shared American identity. This film, and now Dinesh D'Souza's entire personal legacy, is emblematic of this divisive, winner-take-all philosophy, and it is to my way of thinking, very very sad.

I am not totally sold on President Obama, but this movie is so bad I could not hold my laughter in. The four (not kidding: FOUR) other people in the theater didn't seem too impressed either. There is so much sucking going on in this film that I can only hit a few highlights: here goes.1). Not one person D'Souza interviews has expertise on the subject matter. D'Souza does this bait-and-switch thing where he cites some ""expert"" or reads a quote from someone, but then inexplicably interviews someone else. Did you pay attention to the credentials of the media-starved morons he interviews? I did. They have none. These people don't know the President, they don't know government, they don't know anything about running a country. They are just a few pathetic right-wing morons who seem like they would do or say anything to get their mugs in front of a camera, even if it meant being filmed while talking on a phone (see #3 below).2). The thing D'Souza accuses Obama of, WE ALL ARE. His big accusation? Obama is an (insert gasping sound here), ANTI-COLONIALIST!!! Well, hate to tell you this, Dinesh (but I DO have to tell you because, unlike the President, you are not American-born), ALL AMERICANS ARE ANTI-COLONIALISTS. We had this war, see....back in the late 1700's, where we threw out the British. ""Why"", you ask??? Because we did not like being BRITISH COLONIES, you ferret-brained idiot. I personally would never vote for a president who was not an anti-colonialist. I rather prefer being a whole and independent country. Read some of my country's history before you criticize my President, Dinesh.3). Extremely poor production quality. This film looks like it was put together by high-school students with a $150 budget. Half the interviews are done OVER THE PHONE. Films are....um....sort of visual, dude. Doing interviews in person is generally taken for granted. But nope, D'Souza could not be bothered with that crap: he did about half the interviews over the f-ing phone. Seriously.4). Techniques your 8-year old would find cheesy. The rolling black clouds: seriously? The shot, repeated ad nauseum, of an unidentified person picking up handfuls of dirt and pouring it over Obama's father's grave.

Gwin ""college girl""","[11, 15]","If this were a news piece, I would say that it was poorly done as it is taking a few facts and spinning them into a prediction of the future. But it's not a news piece- it's a documentary which should be designed to make a person think. I believe that it does this and it does it well.The documentary shows several people in Obama's life and examines the effect of not having his father around might have caused on him. There is another documentary on Netflix about the influence of a father figure in our lives and as a person who has a distant father and tends to pay attention to people's actions in relation to this failed relationship, I can tell you, this father figure documentary is right in probably 90% of the cases. That being said, the psychology lesson given in ""2016"" is not a bad guess at the truth. It may not be the truth, but it is a possibility and holds at least some element of the real truth most likely. Having our fathers around makes us stronger people. Without them, most people wind up confused and searching to fill a hole they can't fill.Whether the people interviewed are trustworthy sources or crazy people who sound sane is up to you, but they are providing you with a point of view which you can interpret however you may choose.Our documentary host is right about one thing at least and that is the unknown factor of Barrack Obama in the election in 2008. Without that quality, concerns about his character would hold much less space in our synapses. The birther claims and the socialist claims are all based upon the unknowns of our President. This documentary, however, claims a much more possible viewpoint. And that is that Barrack Obama may be trying to level the playing field for the entire world- not just America. The documentary seems to believe that Obama is mostly a new wave of anti-colonialism.

A popular icon and admission of America's conservative racism in itself, but I'll get to that later. Interesting title as well, ""2016: Obama's America"" intrudes the senses that Obama has a secret country somewhere that equals Stalin or The Peoples Temple.In posing the question of racism in America that stumps Jesse Jackson, Dinesh D'souza and Mr. Jackson both forget that there is a population of Americans that do live by limited freedoms and representation politically and economically, hindered by racism and systematic barriers to opportunities open to the rest of America, and that is the American Indian. It is obvious both Jesse Jackson and Dinesh D'souza have never heard of tribal sovereignty or the multitude of organizations, laws and politicians across the nation bent on keeping reservations, indigenous peoples from prospering by blocking native advancements. Beginning with the acosting of children into boarding schools where molestation, suicide and abuse were the norm into the Bureau of Indian Affairs today that filters native landowners royalties via energy, land and natural resources. Do non-native landowners and corporations put up with federal intrusions? Since that is another documentary, lets not dampen D'souza and conservatives efforts to demonize President Obama, so on with the show!This film from Dinesh D'souza holds Obama to standards not held to congress, Romney, McCain, Gingrich, Bush, Cheney and the associates these men are photographed with. Bush Jr. holding hands or kissing Arab oil kings, makes this film thin and reek with nothing but the singular voice of a foreign born writer that never grew up in America, never had one parent or grandparents raise him into a lawyer, yet, is given full reins to use the terms ""we"", ""our country"" and ""us"" when Obama himself, has yet to gain full citizenry from many Americans. This propaganda film attempts to define President Obama and his father's kinship, with little, or no definition of his white family's values or careers. Rather, we get Obama and his ""founding fathers"" and their damage to mankind. There are interviews in plush Republican offices, a psychologist thats an expert on father and sons relations and businessmen bent on the continued fearmongoring the right has mastered, only this time, instead of ""weapons of mass destruction"", we have ""debt of mass destruction"". Rather than interview colleagues, family and community partners Obama has spent time with in order to gain some personal knowledge of Obama the man, Dinesh delves deep into the jungles and scary third world poverty to try to bait Obama's estranged brother George into calling the President neglectful of his family duties, but Dinesh gets nowhere here, no matter how hard he comes off like a dirty cop interrogating a criminal. Even Michael Moore interviews more than three people in his documentaries, right wrong or just plain entertainment value, Moore makes Dinesh D'souza's film look like a boring term paper nobody, even a grading professor, would want to read.It is obscene and contradictory how the film ends in the eyes of a non-white child, possibly Eastern Indian or Iraqi, but no doubt similiar to many of the children killed in both Bush wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. I find this racists and disturbing in itself. Do conservatives really relate to this childs plight?This film fails to convince me that President Obama is the anti-American, anti-capitalist demagod conservatives like to label him as. One minute, Obama is not a legitimate leader and critique'd as incompetent or a failure. When this doesn't work, he is labeled an evil genius out for world dominion alongside his army of militant black liberation army with Bill Ayers and Reverend Wright front and center. If Obama's presidency does anything. It gets Americans on their feet, off their gluteus maximus obesitys  and raises their IQ's in the areas of civics, politics and economics, because before Obama, Americans didn't really care if our presidents couldn't speak and stuttered, killed Indians or found an exit from the stage as long as they looked like CEO's or ministers, gave the rest of the globe a middle finger and I think that says alot more about Americans than our first half African American President in Obama.

There was also no information about Barack Obama out there for anyone to learn about him.  Today, he has been president for four years and while all those other things have shown a degree of change, and public focus, the media is still not aware that Barack Obama had a past and therefore has plans for the future.  This is a very good attempt to help us get to know this man we are to honor as our President, because we are to honor the powers that be, that are ordained of God.  We are a nation under God and indivisible because of it.  This documentary presents concerns and data that help us know how to pray for our country and one another.We can't see America only through our own eyes.  D'Souza, as an immigrant, gives us pause to see it entirely differently, and I appreciate his effort.Reviews of the movie here on Amazon include various accounts of its content: Sam Graham's is one of the more offensive approaches, in my opinion, because he clearly sees it from an entirely different set of life values from mine.  That's why we have both peaches and asparagus: we are not the same, and we benefit from differing choices.  This was a choice I was glad to have made but can't know whether others are going for fruit or vegetables.

To a constantly loud, ominous and foreboding soundtrack, the propagandist narrates throughout the film in an subtle alarmist and almost slick talking voice. As he presents each fact about Obama's past he stamps each one with a presumption and/or idea on how this could be bad for America and it's future. The facts are all stuff most of us already know about Obama's upbringing and the Barack Obama that ""we didn't know"" turns out in the end to be who the Director THINKS he is and where the Director THINKS he's leading the country. In the end it's simply a biased documentary full of fearful presumptions, world economic contradictions and radically extreme rightwing view points based entirely on either a hunch or a wealthy mans agenda or both and brought to you by a ""man"" who served in the White House for good old Ronald Wilson Reagan?This man has given us his opinion on the facts he presented and that's Propaganda!This man sat right next to the Presidents half brother and tried to talk him into admitting that the President betrayed him, as his brother giggles and disagrees with the mans presumptions, the Director set it to dark music to make it seem sarcastic and sad... that is the definition of propaganda.Last but not least, towards the end of the documentary the music gets scarier and the Director then reveals something that to me speaks volumes about himself and OldWorld propagandists like him, he talks about how Obama doesn't want America to be the number one world super power and that it's somehow unAmerican to want to have the same amount of nuclear weapons than Russia(this man thinks we should always have more than everyone???).This is an extremely scary and nationalistic world view of a man telling you not to trust the world view of another man who is far more grounded on the topics of fear and reason.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[75, 133]","Obama supporters (e.g. the mainstream media) want you to believe that ""2016: Obama's America"" is a sensationalistic, white supremacist attack on President Barack Hussein Obama. It isn't. ""2016"" is a fact-based, artistically ambitious documentary, the product of an egghead intellectual, Dinesh D'Souza, who himself is a college president, and who is non-white, Indian-born, the grandson of an anti-white grandfather. D'Souza supports almost every point he makes with original material, including Obama's biography and onscreen experts, including Shelby Steele, the eloquent, African American scholar, George Obama, the president's Kenyan half-brother, Kenyan villagers who knew Obama Sr. intimately, and US Comptroller General David Walker.The film is shot in an artistically ambitious style, with lots of shaky camera work, off-center placement, explanatory animation, and depressing montages of garbage-strewn Kenyan, Indian, and Indonesian slums.In fact, for many viewers this documentary will be entirely too cerebral and level-headed. This is not Michael Moore. It's not funny, it's not shocking, and it's less manipulative than lots of other election-year material. D'Souza never exploits his subjects with the ruthlessness of a Michael Moore. I didn't laugh, I didn't gasp, and I didn't become outraged. I mostly compared what was being said to publicly available information on the subjects discussed and I found the film - dare one say it - reasonably responsible and informative. In fact, the film's one mistake may be that it does not talk down to viewers enough. Anti-colonial theory and action will be new to many viewers. Many will simply not know who Frantz Fanon is, for example, or even Shelby Steele. These scholars could have been introduced to the viewer more slowly, carefully, and thoroughly.Dinesh D'Souza was born in India, famous as the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of the British Empire. India was a hotbed of anti-colonial theorizing and activity. D'Souza inherited this from his grandfather. As such, he sees Barack Hussein Obama, Jr., through the lens of anti-colonialism. D'Souza supports this view of Obama with quotes from Obama's own work, interviews with people who know the Obama family, and scholars like Paul Kengor who has researched Obama's relationship with Frank Marshall Davis.D'Souza argues, using Obama's own words from his memoirs, that Obama wants to fulfill his father's dream of anti-colonial political and economic action. Rich, white, Western people need to be shaken down in order to even the score with poor people of color living in formerly colonized countries like Kenya and Indonesia, and poor, exploited people of color living in Western countries.Interestingly, the lack of economic soundness of this grudge-and-race-based politics is argued by George Obama, the president's half-brother. George makes a very interesting observation. Compare the ""Asian tiger"" countries to formerly colonized countries in Africa. South Korea used to be at the same economic level as Kenya. South Korea has been able to advance in a way that Kenya has not. Why is that, George asks? The unstated but implied answer: not just colonization is to blame for the poverty of some formerly colonized countries. Rather, cultural and economic differences also play a role. Rather than pursuing the kind of race-and-grudge based politics and economics that have destroyed Mugabe's Zimbabwe, exploited people could benefit from learning from countries like South Korea.The documentary veers into speculation toward the end, stating that President Obama wants to see the US in the debt crisis it faces now. That's the film's most outrageous speculation. As the Comptroller General explains, the debt crisis is very real. That Obama desires the debt crisis is mere speculation. The film also criticizes Obama for reducing nuclear warheads and NASA. Again, that Obama has taken these steps is fact. His motivation for doing so, as presented in the film, is mere speculation.",3,Fact Based and Artistically Ambitious,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,3992,"['Obama', 'supporters', 'e.g', 'mainstream', 'media', 'want', 'believe', '2016', 'Obama', 'America', 'sensationalistic', 'white', 'supremacist', 'attack', 'President', 'Barack', 'Hussein', 'Obama', ""n't"", '2016', 'fact-based', 'artistically', 'ambitious', 'documentary', 'product', 'egghead', 'intellectual', 'Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'who', 'college', 'president', 'who', 'non-white', 'Indian-born', 'grandson', 'anti-white', 'grandfather', ""D'Souza"", 'almost', 'point', 'original', 'material', 'including', 'Obama', 'biography', 'onscreen', 'experts', 'including', 'Shelby', 'Steele', 'eloquent', 'African', 'American', 'scholar', 'George', 'Obama', 'president', 'Kenyan', 'half-brother', 'Kenyan', 'villagers', 'who', 'knew', 'Obama', 'Sr.', 'intimately', 'US', 'Comptroller', 'General', 'David', 'Walker.The', 'film', 'shot', 'artistically', 'ambitious', 'style', 'lots', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'off-center', 'placement', 'explanatory', 'animation', 'depressing', 'montages', 'garbage-strewn', 'Kenyan', 'Indian', 'Indonesian', 'slums.In', 'fact', 'many', 'viewers', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'entirely', 'too', 'cerebral', 'level-headed', 'not', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'shocking', 'less', 'manipulative', 'lots', 'other', 'election-year', 'material', ""D'Souza"", 'never', 'subjects', 'ruthlessness', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'gasp', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'outraged', 'mostly', 'compared', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'publicly', 'available', 'information', 'subjects', 'discussed', 'found', 'film', 'dare', 'one', 'say', 'reasonably', 'responsible', 'informative', 'fact', 'film', 'one', 'mistake', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'talk', 'viewers', 'enough', 'Anti-colonial', 'theory', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'many', 'viewers', 'Many', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'Frantz', 'Fanon', 'example', 'even', 'Shelby', 'Steele', 'scholars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'viewer', 'more', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'thoroughly.Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'was', 'born', 'India', 'famous', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'British', 'Empire', 'India', 'was', 'hotbed', 'anti-colonial', 'theorizing', 'activity', ""D'Souza"", 'inherited', 'grandfather', 'such', 'Barack', 'Hussein', 'Obama', 'Jr.', 'lens', 'anti-colonialism', ""D'Souza"", 'view', 'Obama', 'quotes', 'Obama', 'own', 'work', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'Obama', 'family', 'scholars', 'Paul', 'Kengor', 'who', 'researched', 'Obama', 'relationship', 'Frank', 'Marshall', ""Davis.D'Souza"", 'using', 'Obama', 'own', 'words', 'memoirs', 'Obama', 'fulfill', 'father', 'dream', 'anti-colonial', 'political', 'economic', 'action', 'Rich', 'white', 'Western', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'shaken', 'down', 'order', 'even', 'score', 'poor', 'people', 'color', 'living', 'formerly', 'colonized', 'countries', 'Kenya', 'Indonesia', 'poor', 'exploited', 'people', 'color', 'living', 'Western', 'countries.Interestingly', 'lack', 'economic', 'soundness', 'grudge-and-race-based', 'politics', 'argued', 'George', 'Obama', 'president', 'half-brother', 'George', 'very', 'interesting', 'observation', 'Compare', 'Asian', 'tiger', 'countries', 'formerly', 'colonized', 'countries', 'Africa', 'South', 'Korea', 'used', 'be', 'same', 'economic', 'level', 'Kenya', 'South', 'Korea', 'been', 'able', 'advance', 'way', 'Kenya', 'not', 'Why', 'George', 'unstated', 'implied', 'answer', 'not', 'just', 'colonization', 'blame', 'poverty', 'formerly', 'colonized', 'countries', 'Rather', 'cultural', 'economic', 'differences', 'also', 'play', 'role', 'Rather', 'pursuing', 'kind', 'race-and-grudge', 'based', 'politics', 'economics', 'have', 'destroyed', 'Mugabe', 'Zimbabwe', 'exploited', 'people', 'could', 'benefit', 'learning', 'countries', 'South', 'Korea.The', 'documentary', 'veers', 'speculation', 'end', 'stating', 'President', 'Obama', 'see', 'US', 'debt', 'crisis', 'now', 'film', 'most', 'outrageous', 'speculation', 'Comptroller', 'General', 'debt', 'crisis', 'very', 'real', 'Obama', 'debt', 'crisis', 'mere', 'speculation', 'film', 'also', 'Obama', 'reducing', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'NASA', 'Again', 'Obama', 'taken', 'steps', 'fact', 'motivation', 'doing', 'so', 'presented', 'film', 'mere', 'speculation']",N/A

The way things were before the rich and greedy took control of the media.It is adolescent to suggest that he is part of some conspiracy to destroy our way of life, our freedoms, our ability to learn and grow and raise a family, and to someday be able to retire comfortably.It is the kind of fear mongering that we have come to expect from the kind of people who just don't get it. The kind who think that having the most expensive things is what proves their worth.What proves your worth is what's inside you, not what you wear.The way to keep life good for everyone is to allow them to be who they are, as long as they're peaceful, and to defend their right to have a happy life.It's all in the the U.S. Constitution. Our country's founding fathers had the concept right, but it has taken a very long time for most people to understand and embrace the concept.If any president would try to force people to change, it could result in war, because people want to change on their own, not be told to change.That's the reason we should not be pushing for change in any other country. They will resist as a matter of principal, even if they know the change is good.If people won't change for the good of others, then leave them to their own fate.Maybe they'll figure things out on their own.",3,The United States is not so easy to take.,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,1995,"['movie', 'was', 'released', 'run', 'up', 'presidential', 'election', 'paints', 'Obama', 'radical', 'anti-colonial', 'anti-white.Even', 'were', 'true', 'Obama', 'wanted', 'change', 'fundamental', 'guidlines', 'goverment', 'Obama', 'would', 'have', 'convince', 'majority', 'congress', 'senate', 'go', 'along', 'him.The', 'president', 'not', 'have', 'authority', 'enact', 'new', 'laws', 'consent', 'houses.I', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Obama', 'anti-people', 'regardless', 'how', 'look', 'where', ""'re"", 'who', 'love', 'anything', 'else.Maybe', 'better', 'way', 'run', 'country', 'way', 'hard', 'working', 'good', 'people', 'get', 'ahead', 'build', 'comfortable', 'life', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'rich', 'greedy', 'took', 'control', 'media.It', 'adolescent', 'suggest', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'destroy', 'way', 'life', 'freedoms', 'ability', 'learn', 'grow', 'raise', 'family', 'someday', 'be', 'able', 'retire', 'comfortably.It', 'kind', 'fear', 'mongering', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'kind', 'who', 'think', 'having', 'most', 'expensive', 'things', 'what', 'worth', 'what', 'inside', 'not', 'what', 'wear.The', 'way', 'keep', 'life', 'good', 'everyone', 'allow', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'peaceful', 'defend', 'right', 'have', 'happy', 'life.It', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'country', 'founding', 'fathers', 'had', 'concept', 'right', 'taken', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'understand', 'embrace', 'concept.If', 'president', 'would', 'try', 'force', 'people', 'change', 'could', 'result', 'war', 'people', 'want', 'change', 'own', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'change.That', 'reason', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'pushing', 'change', 'other', 'country', 'will', 'resist', 'matter', 'principal', 'even', 'know', 'change', 'good.If', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'good', 'others', 'then', 'leave', 'own', 'fate.Maybe', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'own']",N/A

It was interesting, but not likely to change the minds of fence sitters.Here's my report:----------------I just returned from 2016: Obama's America (2012) written, narrated, and starring Dinesh D'Sousa doing a right wing version of Michael Moore's Farenheit 911 (2004) written, narrated, and starring Michael Moore.Michael Moore's 2004 ""Fahrenheit 911"" movie was released the summer before the 2004 election Bush II won anyway (as Obama will likely win again in Nov. 2012 in the tradition of incumbent USA Presidents not plagued by major scandal or a divisive 3rd party candidate which changes the election....Ross Perot in '92 was the last of those...the guy who put Bill Clinton in the White House by dividing the Conservative vote.....one could argue that Ralph Nadar gave the election to Bush II in 2000 since Nadar votes would have gone to Gore, and the tiny margin Gore needed to beat bush would have come to him...one could argue Nadar was another 3rd party candidate pest .....).The movie 2016: Obama's America (2012) was interesting and an important piece of political documentary cinema.......I'm glad I went.D'Souza's mudslinging at Obama and ""guilt by association"" efforts seemed unpersuasive and unimpressive, and Obama came out OK, I thought.Very interesting personal background stuff about Obama I didn't know, and a brief interview with Obama's half-brother in Kenya named ""George Obama"" who has true movie star qualities, as Obama does himself.Obama looks and sounds good in front of a camera! Every moment Obama was shown on the screen was a moment which defeated D'Souza's effort to trivialize, defame, and criticize him.He's the biggest movie star President in looks and demeanor (""star quality"" guy) since Kennedy and Reagan, and unlike Reagan, he's young and handsome......has a movie star's weight control!Slick movie in some ways, and to my thinking, interesting in all ways. I recommend it. Food for thought.The genre of ""opponent"" movie presented the summer an incumbent USA President runs for office a second time could become a permanent thing, and Moore and D'Souza set standards and imitate each other in interesting ways.What they avoid is almost as interesting as what they present! The oversimplification and trivialization of the USA Presidential selection and performance process is almost comic.....movie house owners won't lose a moment's sleep worrying they will get in trouble showing these movies! The money flows in, and the ""message"" of defamation is forgotten quickly.....everybody's happy at the end, eh?----------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG movie actor.See WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for details about Tex Allen, his movie credits and his biog.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com",2,"""2016: Obama's America"" (2012) Not Likely To Hurt President Obama's Re-Election Chances At All....Lightweight (But Interesting)",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,3712,"['2016', 'Obama', 'America', '2012', 'Not', 'Likely', 'Hurt', 'President', 'Obama', 'Re-Election', 'Chances', '.Lightweight', 'Interesting', 'Stuff', 'August', '28', '2012', 'Lancaster', 'Pennsylvania', 'USA', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', '2016', 'Obama', 'America', '2012', 'created', 'starring', 'Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'styled', 'anti-Obama', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'change', 'minds', 'be', 'ranked', 'brilliant', 'documentary', 'political', 'cinema', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'anyway', 'went', '12:30', 'PM', 'early', 'afternoon', 'show', 'Lancaster', 'City', 'PA', 'largest', 'movie', 'complex', 'Regal', 'Cinema', '16', 'complex', 'large', 'theater', 'was', 'filled', 'senior', 'citizens', 'probably', 'mostly', 'Republicans', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', 'South', 'Central', 'PA', 'Harrisburg', 'PA', 'are', 'traditionally', 'Republican', 'conservative', 'political', 'areas', '..likely', 'not', 'many', 'Obama', 'supporters', 'were', 'audience', 'movie', 'presented', ""n't"", 'likely', 'change', 'Mr.', 'Obama', 'very', 'good', 'chances', 'being', 're-elected', 'USA', 'President', 'November', '2012', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'likely', 'change', 'minds', 'fence', 'sitters.Here', 'report', 'just', 'returned', '2016', 'Obama', 'America', '2012', 'written', 'narrated', 'starring', 'Dinesh', ""D'Sousa"", 'doing', 'right', 'wing', 'version', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Farenheit', '911', '2004', 'written', 'narrated', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Moore.Michael', 'Moore', '2004', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'summer', '2004', 'election', 'Bush', 'II', 'won', 'anyway', 'Obama', 'will', 'likely', 'win', 'again', 'Nov.', '2012', 'tradition', 'incumbent', 'USA', 'Presidents', 'not', 'plagued', 'major', 'scandal', 'divisive', '3rd', 'party', 'candidate', 'election', '.Ross', 'Perot', ""'92"", 'was', 'last', 'guy', 'who', 'put', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'White', 'House', 'dividing', 'Conservative', 'vote', '..one', 'could', 'argue', 'Ralph', 'Nadar', 'gave', 'election', 'Bush', 'II', '2000', 'Nadar', 'votes', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'Gore', 'tiny', 'margin', 'Gore', 'needed', 'beat', 'bush', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Nadar', 'was', '3rd', 'party', 'candidate', 'pest', '..', 'movie', '2016', 'Obama', 'America', '2012', 'was', 'interesting', 'important', 'piece', 'political', 'documentary', 'cinema', ""'m"", 'glad', ""went.D'Souza"", 'mudslinging', 'Obama', 'guilt', 'association', 'efforts', 'seemed', 'unpersuasive', 'unimpressive', 'Obama', 'came', 'out', 'OK', 'thought.Very', 'interesting', 'personal', 'background', 'stuff', 'Obama', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'brief', 'interview', 'Obama', 'half-brother', 'Kenya', 'named', 'George', 'Obama', 'who', 'true', 'movie', 'star', 'qualities', 'Obama', 'himself.Obama', 'looks', 'good', 'front', 'camera', 'moment', 'Obama', 'was', 'shown', 'screen', 'was', 'moment', 'defeated', ""D'Souza"", 'effort', 'trivialize', 'defame', 'criticize', 'him.He', 'biggest', 'movie', 'star', 'President', 'looks', 'demeanor', 'star', 'quality', 'guy', 'Kennedy', 'Reagan', 'Reagan', 'young', 'handsome', 'movie', 'star', 'weight', 'control', 'Slick', 'movie', 'ways', 'thinking', 'interesting', 'ways', 'recommend', 'Food', 'thought.The', 'genre', 'opponent', 'movie', 'presented', 'summer', 'incumbent', 'USA', 'President', 'office', 'second', 'time', 'could', 'become', 'permanent', 'thing', 'Moore', ""D'Souza"", 'set', 'standards', 'imitate', 'other', 'interesting', 'ways.What', 'avoid', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'what', 'present', 'oversimplification', 'trivialization', 'USA', 'Presidential', 'selection', 'performance', 'process', 'almost', 'comic', '..movie', 'house', 'owners', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'moment', 'sleep', 'worrying', 'will', 'get', 'trouble', 'showing', 'movies', 'money', 'message', 'defamation', 'forgotten', 'quickly', '..everybody', 'happy', 'end', 'eh', 'Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'movie', 'actor.See', 'WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen', 'details', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'movie', 'credits', 'biog.Email', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'TexAllen', '@', 'Rocketmail.Com']",N/A

In the case of the background and performance of President Barack Obama, the unfairness has been taken to extremes by his apologists. Frankly, these ""reviewers"" have not been intellectually honest and have given bad ratings to a masterful documentary they could not have seen, or if they have, they plainly rated it dishonestly. And that is a shame!We can disagree about the ultimate political bent of the film, but not about the documentation of hard, cold facts that can be checked out plainly by those who do not fear facing cold reality. The documentary is in fact very fair to Obama - revealing but not shocking, informing while entertaining. It may be too cerebral for some who have become too used to the Jerry Springer-type of sensationalism or Rousseauian emotionalism. But some intellectual challenge is occasionally needed for something as serious as a presidential contest approaching and an incumbent president who despite a mediocre performance, has been sheltered and shielded by the American press and media.Because of the political polarization of this documentary, this film will be most helpful to those who consider themselves centrists and independents. It is an essential film for those who are still undecided. As I have noted, Democrats are panning these movies not only for what it reveals, but for what they think it reveals. Many Republicans do not think this movie goes far enough in exposing all the revelations, but have nevertheless given it the commendable good ratings it deserves.And because detractors of President Obama have been unfairly labeled in some cases ""Neanderthals"" or racists by partisan Democrats, it should be noted the executive producer, co-director, and co-writer of this film is Dinesh D'Souza, not an ""angry white male,"" but an Indian-born intellectual, an eminent college president.Mr. Dinesh D'Souza and associates should be commended for carrying out a masterful piece of investigative journalism and producing an exemplary documentary, doing the homework that should have been performed by the mainstream media at least since to 2008 and which the American press still refuses to carry out, even as we approach the momentous November 2012 Presidential U.S.elections.Dr. Miguel A.

167869,AYG1U47VFZ165,1400322715,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 9]","Predicting the future can be a fuzzy business.  Literally, there are dozens (if not hundreds) of variables that come into play.  Predicting the future of a nation?  Well, that's a whole different game altogether, because of the very nature of prognostication.  See, it's all nebulous.  It's all elusive.  Despite the best intentions, there's no effective way to know what tomorrow will look like.  All we can do is what documentary filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza suggests: get to know the person pulling the strings, and, once you understand what makes him (or her) tick, then you can project some reasonable short- and long-term decisions that he (or she) will make.  No, you can't know anything for certain - that is, not until time travel becomes a reality - but you can offer a learned guess, and the best learned guesses could and should be considered by both leaders and followers at large.On the eve of America's next national election, I thought I'd sit down, watch, and respond to something political, so 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA fit the bill perfectly.In short, a look back isn't always the best way to see forward.  Granted, knowing what events have transpired from history serves as the best predictor of future behaviors, but, where politicians are concerned, I think in this day and age it's become increasingly difficult to say who will decide what, when, where, how, and why.  Washington influences - mostly driven by money - always appear to be in flux, certainly from those of us sitting on the sidelines or on the outside.  What one politician says today is usually only to assuage or influence voters to go to the polls and cast a ballot, nothing more, nothing less.  Once political cycles come to a close, THEN the real business of governance and leadership takes place, and Barack Obama - whether he likes it or not - has left a bit of a dubious legacy.  I say this not as a Conservative or a Progressive but as a realist.""Hope"" and ""change"" have no specific meaning other than what the dictionary underscores, and that's why his ascendancy to the American `throne' (my words, not his or D'Souza's) was a heavily calculated move.  In fact, I'd imagine that if you went from person-to-person in a crowded room, you'd be hard pressed to show consensus around whatever they interpreted would come to pass from any of Obama's speeches.  An accomplished speaker, his focus appears entirely inspirational; he lacks specificity to that point that a realist like myself would want ... but, in fairness, ALL politicians do.  That's because they, largely, answer to the `money' and NOT to the `people.'  Any one of them says a wrong word, and their backers then find someone else to do their bidding.  (Again, maybe that's me, but I've yet to meet a politician I'd fully trust to do ANYTHING other than run for office.  Call me a cynic.  I'm comfy with the title.)All I can say after viewing 2016 is that writer/director D'Souza has achieved what any essayist would hope: he's presented a theory, he's backed it up with facts, and he's leaving the audience to make up their minds.As a result, it's hard for me to sink my teeth into all that much that's presented here.  That isn't because I disagree with it; rather, as I've tried to make clear, it's only a working theory.  So little of the picture deals with what America in 2016 would effectively look like beyond the theory.  There's no way to know, but it's all presented with as much pomp and circumstance required.  It's put together quite well.  It raises solid concerns.  And it's all done solely to make you - the viewer - think about it.  That was achieved.If anything, I guess I was left wanting to know more.  I believe I understand perfectly well where D'Souza's coming from - even he appears to underscore to viewers that much of what he's explored is only T-H-E-O-R-Y and that it's entirely based on his pursuit and understanding of the facts.  Despite what many in the mainstream press would tell you, questions persist in the background and ideology of Barack Obama.  From what I've watched of him, he rarely answers anything in the definitive, and, until such a time as a journalist enters the scene who can effectively get a politician to that point, then we're all left with theories.  Dismiss D'Souza or embrace his ideas - much like Obama's followers or detractors do the President - but he makes a cogent argument for accepting that Barack doesn't much care for the country he leads.Is that Obama truly feels?Go ask him, but remember: above all things, Obama's a politician, and no politician's word is golden until AFTER the election.2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA is produced by Obama's America Foundation.  Theatrical and DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  Video quality is very solid, though there are a few moments when I wasn't quite certain what I was looking at; much of this is due to the nature of documentary filmmaking - meaning some folks didn't want the camera to be on them while they were speaking and/or dismissing the filmmaker.  Honestly, I had some minor problems with audio quality; D'Souza narrates some portions of the film - those were largely okay - but there are a few sequences where I suspect a sub-par microphone was being used, and I found it a noticeable drop in quality.  It's a small quibble, but it's an honest one.  There are no special features, but, with documentaries, there really isn't that much call for them, either.RECOMMENDED.  By its very nature, I'm not sure that 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA will win any converts, though I'd encourage folks from any point in the political spectrum to watch it.  Best-selling author Dinesh D'Souza presents a theory surrounding Barack Hussein Obama - the modern man who would be king - whereas others (supporters and detractors) largely present their own respective biases.  Then, D'Souza goes about presenting the evidence supporting his theory.  While it's a convincing package, I think it'll remain a bit elusive until the facts - the cold hard facts of Obama's ideology - are fully exposed.  Then, audiences won't have to deal in theory; instead, they'll be able to make up their own minds - rightly or wrongly - on the reality of today's most loved and most hated politician.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener of 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA Ain't Political, Folks, So Calm Down ...

Barrack's speeches were extremely moving. 4 years later, they seem to be empty speeches. Both  of my sister in laws have been laid off. My older sister can't find work even though she's been trying to get a job for 2 years. My pay has been cut by 30 percent. I owe $65,000. More on my house than it's actually worth. I'm paying twice as much for gas since Barrack took office. My 75 year old mother is worried because her doctor told her when Obamacare is fully implemented in January 2013,  he will probably not be allowed to see her as often due to cuts in Madicare mandated by Obamacare.  This is disturbing since she has an extremely serious illness and needs good care.We gave this man over 800 billion dollars in tax-payer dollars to help stimulate the economy.IT DID NOT WORK.

167878,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,1400322715,"Fabulinus ""To err is human. To forgive for no...","[43, 92]","My goodness... where to begin?  Every so often I'll turn on Fox News or watch a documentary by a far right pundit just to see how the other half lives.  Most of the time I regret it and can't seem to stomach their foolishness and lies for very long, but with this film I didn't walk away with that reaction.  I did so much laughing that I contemplated giving Dinesh D'Souza's film 2 stars for its entertainment value.  I actually took notes throughout the film, but when I realized how much time I was giving to it, I stopped.There are three important facts that D'Souza either gets wrong, distorts or outright lies about in his film.  The first being the lack of familiarity of Obama's extended Kenyan relatives to him.  ** Fact:  Barack  Obama was raised by his white, American, Midwestern mother and his white, American, Midwestern grandparents. **Just about every bit of social science, psych literature that has been published since Freud has established that the people who are the most influential in shaping character and personality in someone's life are the people who RAISED him/her (e.g. biological parents, step-parents, grandparents, foster parents, Auntie Em, Uncle Jesse, mom's boyfriend, dad's girlfriend... whatever - lol).  Obama Sr. kept in touch with his son... over the phone... half way around the world... how many times?  Oh, yeah - there's some really deep parenting going on there (not).  President Obama's ""long lost brother,"" who D'Souza tracks down and harasses, met him how many times?  I'm pretty sure the film gives the impression he met him once when he was a kid, but for the sake of trying to be somewhat complimentary, let's just say he met President Obama 5 times - lol.  Unless these two have been palling around their whole lives and hanging out, they don't know each other.  This could be said for all of President O's Kenyan relatives and their assorted friends - they don't really know him other than to say hi, how ya doing, the weather is fine over here and I like your hair do, obviously.  As for President O reaching out to them, he's trying to understand part of his heritage.  What reasonably thinking, self-aware person wouldn't do that?  People with Irish, Italian, German, Greek, English, and Scottish DNA (etc.) do it all the time.  So if a Black person does it, there's a problem?  Come on.The second piece of distorted info in this film would be the constant barrage of communist labeling attributed to President Obama.  Obama is not a communist.  If he were, he'd be a card carrying member of the Communist Party.  He is not.  And as for his more left leaning professors and associates, having been born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts myself (he went to school at both Harvard in Cambridge, MA and Columbia in New York, NY), I can say the more politically and socially left leaning way of thinking is normal in that part of the country (hence most Republicans in much of the North East being centrist... Remember Mitt Romney's liberal governorship in Massachusetts?).  Also, in regards to Obama's well rounded college education,  it is not uncommon for college students to be exposed to varying forms of knowledge.  That's why people attend college in the first place (cough).  What college worth their weight in salt would teach only American style capitalism when world history is full of other forms of economic systems?  How dumb do some of you want Americans to be?  While the rest of the civilized world learns a well-rounded array of information about our collective world economic history, we'll elect a dunce who doesn't understand the global community or anything else except greedy, immoral, unregulated capitalism then sit back and watch the train wreck happen.  Oh wait... that already happened... under Dubbya...  Some folks are left leaning and some are right leaning.  If you're left leaning it doesn't automatically make you a communist.Finally, the notion that Obama was elected president simply because of white guilt (asserted by Shelby Steele in the film and by D'Souza indirectly) is funny considering that he lost the white vote.  Yes, I'll repeat that:  President Barack Obama lost the white vote in the 2008 presidential election.  The only two large groups of people who voted for Barack Obama out of the white vote were single, professional white women and white college students (or college age).  Looks like this time around for the 2012 election, that trend will continue - lol.  Barack Obama was in the right place at the right time in history.  He was a fresh face who arrived on the scene with grand ideas, smarts and an authentic, energetic style.  After coming out of 8 disastrous years that saw us weather the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 2 major wars in the middle east (one of which was unnecessary) and the worst financial situation since the Great Depression (all of which were brought on by the Bush Administration), the majority of Americans were in no mood for the establishment (John McCain or Hillary Clinton).  Had the country not been through the above mentioned, I doubt HIGHLY that Barack H. Obama would have been elected president.  The country was weary and needed someone new.""2016 Obama's America"" is ridiculous.  Dinesh D'Souza is literally scrounging for any piece of information he can stretch to scare the ignorant public.  The 5 star reviews for this film almost make me think they are either phantom reviews or friends of Dinesh doing him a favor - lol - because otherwise it is a sad commentary to think that someone would look at this movie and see either fact or importance in it.It cost me $3.99 to rent this film on Amazon, which is about the cost of a medium ice cream sundae at my local ice cream shop.  In reflection, I now see where I made my mistake...",1,1 star for at least establishing Obama born in U.S. - LOL,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,5777,"['goodness', 'where', 'begin', 'Every', 'so',

Obama's knowledge of economics, for example seems to be at the level of illiteracy. Somehow, he was imbued with Keynesian economics and socialist thought that is at an extraordinarily rudimentary level. Obama's economic policies have been and remain destructive to the national economy.Then there is his conduct of foreign policy which has absolutely no logical explanation for most of what he does.For example, why did he make such an ostentatious effort to insult the British over the bust of Winston Churchill? Why not put it someplace where he did not have to look at it instead of being so upfront insulting? It is a little thing, but a very telling thing.Obama's anti-colonial roots may be the best explanation. Somewhere in the recesses of a rejected little boy, we now have an adult vendetta that threatens the survival of the nation.The only interest that Obama has in running the nation, is his outstanding ability to campaign for the job. Doing the job he is absolutely terrible. In fact, he is worse than terrible he is destructive e.g. health care reform.In a real sense, Obama is much more a prisoner of his past than someone like Churchill. Churchill was not a crippled human being that could not learn to do things differently if necessary to his success. Obama appears to be just that; a crippled human being that does not understand himself and does not understand the place of the country in the scheme of the world that he governs.Obama is in reality the most dangerous man imaginable to the future of America. What he will do when unfettered by reelection campaigning is utterly frightening. What is even worse, we are doing it to ourselves by electing such a person.

We paused it many times to discuss the facts presented and conclusions reached. We got on Google and did research, like ""return of Churchill bust"". My view is that this is a movie and not a documentary.  I found the ""therefore"" conclusions to be weak. It would seem a documentary would recognize that views held many years ago (assuming they were held) could not change later.  Is a Romney allowed to change his views (I think he is, ideally explaining it if it changes within a year)?I asked my wife at the end of the movie whether she wonders why so many people in the world who have been around and have access to information we in the public typically do not, why they did not have these same concerns.  Colin Powell for example.  If the assertions were true, are the supporters of BO of like mind, wanting to destroy America with increased debt, or are they just naive or stupid?  How did this president allude so many seemingly smart people, yet the producer of this movie peel the onion back and see the truth others have not?See this movie with someone who is on opposite sides.  Pause, research, and evaluate whether in each step the ""therefore"" conclusions are necessary or even likely to be valid.  If you are convinced, great.  For me, I saw the conclusions as ""wow, that was a big leap from what was just shown"".I did like the movie in terms of the frequent quoting of BO, that was useful.  I found the history of his parents and brother to be very useful.  I did feel the producer badgered the brother to try and force him to say certain things, and because he would not, the conclusion was BO rejected him and would not help him.  That was the only way to discredit his half brother.I give a three star because of the history of the family and pictures and interview with the half brother. One star for objectivity and clear thinking if this was my only criteria.Back to the title of my review.

Casey ""gcasem""","[15, 20]","2016: Obama's AmericaOne of the first things we read on the jacket cover of 2016 Obama's America is ""Love him, hate him, you don't know him"".  We found that this was true for us; there were things we didn't know, especially about his founding fathers which are not the founding fathers of the United States of America.Some of the founding fathers of President Obama kept a low profile during the election of 2008 and one was offered $150,000 to keep quiet.  The rabid anti-Semitic, Professor Unger of Harvard, refused interviews in 2008 because he didn't want to hurt Mr. Obama's chances of election to the Presidency.The movie explains very well the meaning of Obama's book ""Dreams from My Father"" for his values are deeply rooted in Kenya.  A friend of his father's said that the ideas of the father and the son are one.  One of his grandfather's five wives said the same thing.The film explains why one of the first things that President Obama did in the White House was to return a bust of Winston Churchill to England.It explains why Obama moved oil drilling out of the Gulf and offshore elsewhere and moved it to third world countries and gave billions of dollars to Brazil to drill for oil (and/or refine it) saying that the United States would buy from Brazil.It  explains why Obama sides with the Palestinians against Israel.It explains why he took one of America's symbols of greatness, NASA, and reduced it more or less to a glorified outreach to the Muslim world.It explains why he has greatly weakend our defenses by reducing out missile strength from 5,000 to about 1500 and why he plans to rid us entirely of them, while other countries, our enemies, are increasing their number.  This he has done besides slashing deeply the funds given to our military.Mr. Obama's values are not the traditional values of most Americans.  They are foreign to most of us.  He was elected the first time because tens of millions of people thought they knew what he was about when he promised ""hope and change"".Now we have no excuse for no longer not knowing Mr. Obama.

167901,A3KULFIW5DD2TW,1400322715,Goosta,"[3, 4]","To start, I must say that I'm amazed this film made it to the theaters...that's because it barely misses noticing, while trying earnestly to really notice, the inner essence of Obama, his purpose in life.And what is Obama? To make a long story short, Barack Hussein Obama is an anti-white black racial-socialist. He is not merely a black 'nationalist' because his undying allegiance to his black race transcends all nationality, like many black activists before him and along with the black contemporaries that are presently assisting him inside and outside of government, like Eric Holder and Jay-Z with his '5-Percent Nation' medallions, and lets not forget the Reverend Jeremiah Wright and all of 'Religious Liberation Theology', which graphs religious innuendo onto racial animosity as a to make the latter that much more respectable for non-whites.That Obama 'made it' is a testament to the power of the Liberal media, the Universities, the Liberal elite in Government and the collective flabbiness, fecklessness and impotence of the Millennial generation. Obama was domesticated for the liberal white palette. If he came off as what he was, he would have scared the moronic 'independents/libertarians'  and nascent white liberals away with the real stuff. I know of a lilly-white hipster girl, now 26 years old, that eagerly voted for Obama in 2008 and then in 2012 complained about his 'radicalism' and became a Ron Paul supporter. That is the level of obliviousness Obama had to tame to win.All the liberalism surrounding Obama and the liberal rhetoric he exudes is merely a predication of his position as a black in contemporary America's racial spoils system, the system that interprets the races of men as that of black, non-white employment first (Equal Opportunity) and evil white men with their evil history ruining everyone else.This merely proxy liberalism, ""proxy"" because liberalism's neutralizing power is purely a tool used by Obama to further black empowerment, includes all of Obama's overtures to same-sex marriage, all of his allegiances to like-minded non-whites (Leland Yee) in the form of 'immigration' and 'privilege', gun-control, an almost exclusively white issue, and even statements about marijuana, which is a stigma only in Southern/rural white households. In each case Obama supports the issue insofar as it benefits the black race to the detriment of whites, hence the polarized voting racial statistics shoved in our face by the media.Everyone knows the black prison/crime statistics and marijuana's role in those statistics, so Obama supports legalization and supports it only for that reason, not because of the wider context of the bogus 'drug war'.Michael Moore is correct in saying that whites consist of like 90% gun ownership in this country. Guns are of course another leading factor in black/urban crime, the very principle of gun ownership endangers Federal sovereignty and whites are buying them because they're scared of what is coming, since everyone formally despises whiteness, so Obama and Democrats support the outright illegalization of guns.Homosexuality is only really 'accepted' in America and Europe, formally white nations, and the overwhelming majority of homosexual speech comes from white mouths, so much that I see homosexual activism banners at my college explicitly endorsing black men to come out the closet. This is done because of the overwhelming, if not brutal and basic, masculinity in Hip-Hop, a black cultural artifact, and in black males' roles in professional sports, another bastion of a very elementary masculinity. Obama knows that the main acceptance of homosexuality comes in the form of feckless white liberals and he knows that the black community as a whole is so masculinized that it will never budge in its mutual opposition to the issue, regardless that they vote in favor for it when they vote for Obama, and they always will vote for him no matter what, so Obama supports same-sex marriage. The only people who lose in this case are non-reconstructed whites. Same-sex opposition, besides religious invocations, has been directly equated with 'white male patriarchy' and this has been burned in the mind of the masses by Media, Universities, and the Federal Government. So, blacks can approve same-sex marriage while existing outside of it's context as merely 'black', so they escape the corrosive influence the same-sex issue has on family and history. Only whites, and specifically white men have their entire existence equated with the same-sex issue, so they either have to vote 'Democrat' or be evil. That is the power-structure not only of this issue but really of every political issue current in America.And the list goes on. These are 'proxy' issues because they represent a larger struggle that everyone notices but only sporadically evokes, like when Kamau Kambon called for the extermination of white people in 2007, but this usually only occurs in protected environments like Howard University. To actually talk about it in public threatens the underlying success of the plan of which they speak and with which all the Democrats agree; this is essentially why Jeremiah Wright disappeared so quickly in 2008, why the media, Obama's lackeys, dropped him forever and McCain never said anything about him.D'Souza never says anything about any of this, as Republicans cannot say anything about it and this explains the present dysfunction of the Republican part.  Instead D'Souza focuses on a few impartial connections Obama has with 'Marxists', a slogan that is readily digestible for the overwhelmingly white, and might I say stupid, audience of this film. The 'Marxists' are literary influences, Bill Ayers, and similar ilk. Therefore, Obama is a Marxist and wants to socialize Capitalist America. It is the slightest of hints.The reality, as I have said earlier, is that Obama sees everything as a race issue. Obama of course despises Capitalism, not because of the myriad and serious criticisms Capitalism has received since the 19th century, but because blacks are mainly poor in America. That blacks are poor world-wide is because of White Colonialism and Capitalism, which many blacks, perhaps even Obama, consider to be an exclusively white phenomenon and consider it part of the essence of 'whiteness'.Now Obama didn't just think of all this by himself, although simply being black today affords the attention of the many powerful institutions that certainly do think this way, and this explains how Obama went to college. Obama is also a product of the contemporary 'Academy', that is, the 'Humanities and Social Sciences' of Universities. I'm an English major, I know. From Top to Bottom, the Academy is universally anti-white. One only has to read Derrida, Judith Butler, Judith Halberstam, Foucault, and so on down the honor-roll to understand this. People who would formally have been Leftists have completely abandoned Marx's economic determinism, 'vulgar Marxism', and with the assistance of 'Post-Modernism', they have displaced and replaced that Master/Slave relationship onto racial and sexual grounds. Thus, 'Identity Politics' is born. Now everything a white man does is a consequence of his white privilege and racism, and so, in a very religious manner, he has to repent for his evil, go out of his way to love blacks, homosexuals, Rap music, Beats by Dre, and vote for the 'Democratic' party. Obama is really just a product of the Univeristy, a university that sees itself as not just reconfiguring the parameters of American society on economic grounds but, as I said, just as much, if not more so on racial and sexual grounds. So calling them 'Marcists' and 'Socialists', as only the bravest of Republicans will do, is itself meaningless and self-defeating.What we really have here, and what they instinctually recognize, is the logical conclusion of Liberalism.",4,Just the tip of the iceberg,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,7885,"['start', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'film', 'made', 'theaters', 'barely', 'noticing',

167902,A3GQXLVWTJLARH,1400322715,Gordo the Gatling Gun,"[2, 3]","NOTE:  This review was posted on an amazon forum back in 2012, when this movie came out!  The review in question is reposted as it was written (with only one bit marked by an asterisk changed due to context) as a means to gauge it's relevance today.  Keep this in mind.***Spoilers***Now for my second review: 2016: Obama's America. Now, this is the first time I've ever seen a documentary of great significance on the big screen (I've seen a few science and national geography documentaries at the Denver Museum's Imax theater once upon a time), and will thus be the first time I review a documentary here on this site (or anywhere for that matter). And considering the fact that the whole movie is an argument-based documentary on a significanct subject, this review will be a bit different. See, unlike [your ordinary feature film]*, I cannot simply rate the film, say, a 10 out of 10, because there's a whole different set of credentials I need to follow. As a result, this review will take the form of a short essay of my own, in which I tackle the following criteria: What stance does it take on Obama? And does he do this stance justice (are the details in any way valid?)?Now, before I tackle that part of my review, I might as well get technique out of the way as that still remains a factor in this movie. The overall presentation is fantastic. The way some of the clips, the precise detail, the way it was all strung together, it gives the film a perfect flow. And instead of mostly talking heads, many of the interviews are filmed as if they were scenes in an actual movie. It just goes to show that the overall editing, cinematography, and use of sound are all first rate. And frankly, if I were to give it the general 10-star rating, this film would earn a whole star based on the technique alone, as the presentation of this particular documentary ranks the film among the best in cinematic history.Now the question is, does the whole rest of the film live up to the film's technique? Well, Dinesh D'Souza starts off his documentary by going through a general rundown of where he came from as an immigrant to the United States, and then he moves on to compare his origins and views on America to those of Obama. He essentially starts from day one, specifically where Obama's father came from and what he did during his lifetime, and then goes from there (as that he was one of Obama's original sources of inspiration). He interviews various family, friends and acquaintances that knew either his father or Obama himself, and even looked into his autobiography and his various speeches.The film itself is based on D'Souza's observations on the President and the various interviews he's done for this particular project. The stark contrast would have to be Michael Moore who not only cherry picks his clients and then turns a tragic incident into a gun control propaganda flick, but is a complete cynical @2$h01e to boot. Here, there isn't a single solitary trace of cyncism or otherwise attempts at mean spirited wisecracks. Granted, what he says can make you uncomfortable (especially if your political leanings are more to the left, as are the majority of mainstream professional critics), but it is an important side of the argument to take into consideration.Now, before I continue any further, allow me to get something out of the way before some flamming Liberals begin to lynch me with so-called leverage they may have on me: I am not a Republican. In fact, I am not even a Mitt Romney fan. Yeah, my leanings are more towards the right, but I am a nonaffiliate. I am only going to vote Mitt Romney because based on personal observations, Obama needs to go, and Romney's the only candidate who remotely stands a chance getting rid of him.And in addition to this, I am not fond of many of the previous projects from the Conservative side of the movie business. An American Carole, while a sincere attempt at satire, falls flat on its face. Most of the jokes don't work, and its satirical approach is both too easy and too obvious; and only the former is in any way understandable. And the less that can be said about Team America: World Police, the better; and need I mention Adam Sandler? Or Larry the Cable Guy? Heck, the only films tackling the Right that I admired in recent memory are Atlas Shrugged Part One, and to a lesser extent, Act of Valor (a great film, but more of a pro-marine propaganda flick than a pro-conservative one).But the question shouldn't be about my political preferences so much as whether or not the film works. Well, after gathering all the facts together and putting together all that he knew from his various interviews, he came to a startling conclusion: Another term under Obama would be catastrophic. Not just for America, but for the rest of the world as well. This film doesn't bs at all; it is a straight-forward analysis of Obama's history and how it's come to shape who he's become today.Now considering the fact that I whole-heartedly support this movie's stance, I can't bring myself to rank this film at all. I mean, as far as setting up a side in an argument's concerned, it's a solid A+ in my book, but beyond that, this is a completely different entity from just about every other film I've seen this year. To rank it among the 10 best films of the year wouldn't be able to do it, or any other film on said list, justice. And the radical changes to form in this movie means that it utterly defies the typical 10-star rating system that I normally give it. It is utterly unrankable under any circumstances in my book.But overall, it was an enlightening experience, but a cold, uncomfortable reminder of what may soon become our reality. But the sad part was that, at the mere age of 22, I was easily the youngest person in the theater. The fact of the matter is, more of the younger generations need to see this film, as it is clearly resonating more with an audience that should already know all the details presented in said film.So who can I recommend this film to? Anyone who is young, ignorant, and/or anyone else who relies more on raw emotions and other chemical and hormonial imbalances than their brains. Of course, those who are conservative or undecided need to see this film too, but the younger generations need the wake up call the most. Those who are genuinely concerned for where this country--and for that matter, the rest of this world--is heading needs to see this movie. I don't care who you are or what circumstances are preventing you from seeing this movie; see this movie. The only way you will not get much out of this is if you lean too far into the left of the political spectrum and you firmly believe that Socialism works.But when and if you do see this movie, I suggest you do something fun and may cheer you up, like watch a film you greatly admire, or play a video game you like, or even something more casual like going for a swim. In fact, that's exactly what I'm going to do. But no matter what happens, keep what you've gathered from this film as food for thought.***Spoilers end***I figured today, this movie is proving itself correct with each and every passing day.  While it isn't quite 2016 yet, I am confident in giving this movie a perfect rating.  As to where I'd rank it on my list of favorite films of 2012, I'd rate it number 3--better than The Master, but not quite as good as Seven Psychopaths or Holy Motors.

This film is like Dinesh D'Souza's books: logical and semi-academic up to a point, after which it turns avowedly mean-spirited and begins to parrot far rightwing ideology.I too had questions about our first black president, some of them still unanswered. And one of the reasons I bought this film is because I thought that D'Souza might shed new light -- however jaundiced it might be. However that is not what he did. He came just short of ""setting up"" those he interviewed, egging them on, channeling his questions so that only the bad side of Mr. Obama would be revealed.Did Dinesh think we were too dumb to see what he was doing, or, are his standards just that low? For me, who has read and reviewed most of his books, I can assure the reader that it is both.In this regard, I thought the way he treated Mr. Obama's brother was really low-class. Although the brother avoided being drawn into D'Souza cleverly engineered trap.

I also realized that this identification was powerful enough to direct Obama's attitudes toward the United States and to prompt a certain amount of interference in Kenyan politics (like sending Joe Biden to campaign for Odinga's Shari'ah-friendly constitution) but definitely NOT strong enough to move Obama to any personal expenditure of either self or money on his family connections there.D'Souza, with his extensive knowledge and research has done an outstanding job of exposing, in the words of the title of his first work on this subject, ""The Roots of Obama's Rage.""This is a thoughtful, careful presentation that deserves very serious consideration in the process of trying to understand this otherwise engimatic radical in the White House.",5,The Most Compelling Explanation Yet,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,1308,"['begin', 'caveat', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'reading', ""D'Souza"", 'books', 'subject', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'autobiographies', 'sampling', 'writers', 'Obama', 'flatly', 'helped', 'form', 'world-view.I', 'long', 'ago', 'figured', 'out', 'time', 'return', 'Churchill', 'bust', 'reading', 'Dreams', 'From', 'Father', 'Audacity', 'Hope', 'Obama', 'more', 'basis', 'personal', 'understanding', 'Luo', 'Kenyan', 'heritage', 'anybody', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'who', 'read', 'uncritically', 'can', 'imagine', 'also', 'realized', 'identification', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'direct', 'Obama', 'attitudes', 'United', 'States', 'prompt', 'certain', 'amount', 'interference', 'Kenyan', 'politics', 'sending', 'Joe', 'Biden', 'campaign', 'Odinga', ""Shari'ah-friendly"", 'constitution', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'strong', 'enough', 'move', 'Obama', 'personal', 'expenditure', 'self', 'money', 'family', 'connections', ""there.D'Souza"", 'extensive', 'knowledge', 'research', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'exposing', 'words', 'title', 'first', 'work', 'subject', 'Roots', 'Obama', 'Rage', 'thoughtful', 'careful', 'presentation', 'very', 'serious', 'consideration', 'process', 'trying', 'understand', 'otherwise', 'engimatic', 'radical', 'White', 'House']",N/A

Did this picture grab and maintain my interest? Did it seem to try to be fair while attempting to persuade the audience to take his view? Did he let his opposition speak for themselves as opposed to using cinematography to twist their comments? The answer to the preceding questions are yes, yes, and yes.While Michael Moore is a household name, Dinesh D'Souza is not. As a result, D'Souza wisely introduced himself -- comparing himself with Obama. He also mentioned a debate with Jesse Jackson on racism. He established that his background resulted in him having a perspective that would differ from one who lived here in the country. Additionally, later on in the movie he showed some criticism he received for his book ""The Root of Obama's Rage"".He early on stated things about Obama's presidency that made him wonder. From there, he looks at Obama's upbringing -- frequently using Obama reading his own words -- for the purpose of seeing how his background affects his political worldview. He then commented on what he expected (right on target each time) and projected what he'd expect in a second term.Important things to realize. D'Souza is not a birther -- he stated Obama was born in Hawaii. He also focused on areas of economy and foreign affairs; abortion and same sex marriage were not topics in this documentary.In conclusion, the ending of the film can be considered propaganda.

167922,A1LJCJLFWTURI4,1400322715,Jakey D,"[2, 3]","Dinesh D'Souza is not out to insult or disgrace our ""president"". He actually felt pride in the decision that America made. I personally didn't, since I saw the socialist Obama, but if Obama would have proven me wrong, I would be the first to admit my mistake and judgment in a man and what he was about to do. The movie, ""2016: Obama's America"", is to present facts, show you who the man in the White House really is and what he represents. For those of you who feel that this movie is about ""Obama trashing"", you could not be furthest from the truth and therefore would be the primary audience to watch this film. It is a movie that is a must see before the election for everyone. Whether you believe that the current Occupier of the White House has done a great job or not, you have to know who Obama really is, before you press the voting button!!Mr. D'Souza is a scholastic and political genius in my personal opinion. To try not to go into the details of the movie too much, I would just like to provide my personal view on what I have gathered from the movie and would encourage everyone to see it, make your own judgment and decisions. As mentioned before, the movie IS NOT about bashing Obama, not about discussion about the ""president"" and what he has not done, but it is about Obama as a person, his view of the world and his view of America's future, which is different from what America was built upon. The film is about his childhood, family members, mentors and everyone who shaped his young life. We cannot judge a man, without seeing what shaped and developed his life. As per my background and my view of the world, how I was raised, how I was brought up to despice socialism and what it stands for, due to the fact that my family had nothing that the socialist society has to offer, I shaped my decisions and my views from that. The same goes for everyone, including Barry Soetoro aka Barack Hussein Obama.Here are the facts and the shaping of the anti American ""president""...While watching the film, I could not help but notice the similarities in all the ""open thinkers"", ""scholars"" and ""anti colonial"" socialists. Obama's biological father died in a car accident. According to his close friends, they were drinking and having their ""intellectual"" discussions. At 1:30 pm he was already drunk and drove home killing himself. Not the first time for Barack Obama Sr to drink and drive, but this time his life ended just like many ""heroes"", where drinking and doing whatever you please for scholars, elite members of socialist system was popular. One that really comes to mind was Yuri Gagarin. Yuri was a Soviet Pride. Gagarin, first man in space, prove to the world that the Russian space program was the best. Yuri, at the time a test pilot, becomes a national Soviet hero, only to die later testing a plane. Well, according to some, something went wrong, but according to others, Yuri was an alcoholic. Could it be that another ""hero"" was just too drunk to figure out what to do in the complex situation, like flying a plane or in Obama Sr's case, just driving a car? Not saying anything about Barry Obama, but just pointing out my point of view on the so called ""free thinking"" socialists. There were other ""free thinkers"" and just plain bums in history who turned to bottle, so that they can avoid personal responsibility and preach ""equality"" to others and in such way Karl Marx comes to mind. Free loader, alcoholic, even though a scholar, but let his own children starve to death, so that he can drink and preach useless theory that later ruined nations and created millions of miserable lives. I am not saying anything about Obama, yet, but merely drawing parallels on some of his family members and others who have chosen to live the same ""heroic"" way.Obama's mother.... She tried to get away from ""imperialistic"" and ""capitalistic"" United States or the West in general. She did everything and anything to insure that her child, Barry, was raised with the same views that she held dear. She even divorced Lolo Soetoro, hence the name Barry Soetoro, because Lolo did nothing more than tried to provide for her and their children. She despised success and American free market, just like I despise socialism. Perhaps Obama's mother would have been better off in those societies that she ran to, but even they couldn't handle her and therefore divorce after divorce she kept searching. She did whatever she could to ""shield"" young Obama from anything that she deemed western and therefore ""corrupt"".It seems that according to his socialism sympathetic mother, her anti Colonist views of the world and Obama's grandfather, they thought that someone like Frank Marshal Davis would serve as a better role model. Mr Davis was not just a friend of the family. Frank Marshal Davis became Obama's friend, mentor and the influence that later provides direction to Obama's views, choices in life and friends that he makes and keeps. Not to mention that Frank was a card carrying communist and an open anti American, Soviet supporter. They had a name for people like that and still do. They called them Enemies of the State!!Then we skip to the more current events and take a closer look into Obama's speech ""your brother's keeper"". By George Obama's example, younger half brother of Barack Obama, besides the fact that Obama would not support his own brother,  on the merit of brother's keeper and because George does not share his anti Colonial and anti Western views, it is not about family, values or ""brother's keeper"", it is all about ideology for our ""president"".  Furthermore, we can clearly see that not just the fact that Obama has shared views and idolized his drunken socialist father, but he also based his magnetism towards certain individuals on the false hope of a myth rather than the character of the individual. Obama is truly an opposite of what Martin Luther King Jr. has spoken about. Obama doesn't judge the people by their character, but by their ideology and therefore the background of his own false demons and idols. Therefore his own brother does not fall into that category and is ruled out of Obama's ""brother's keeper"" rhetoric. Barack Hussain Obama sees the entire western world as colonizing oppressors. It is not an attack on our current resident of the White House or an insult, but a fact. Before I saw this movie, I had many theories of my own, since I have some background and experience, my view on speeches and promises that BHO made in 2008, but the way Dinesh D'Souza describes it, it makes complete and total sense of what Obama stands for and why he cannot stand America, Israel and the entire western society as it is. That is why Obama is sympathetic to the ""oppressed"" Muslim world and that is why he stands on the wrong side of our principles and our values.What a clich&eacute;, Jews voting for Obama and Barry's views on Israel as a ""colonizing"" nation. I am a Soviet born Jew and therefore I cannot see Obama as someone who would support our closest ally. Obama sees the world as such, so he views Muslims as oppressed, rather than oppressors, even if they kill millions of other Muslims, that would be fine according to people like Barry in Chief, as long as the tiny Israel is not involved. Then Obama steps in and pretends to be on the just side of the formula and trying to broker peace from the Palestinian side. How obvious and how much more does he have to do, in order for people to realize that he is not friends of our friends, our allies, and sides with American enemies?Towards the end of the film, I noticed another interesting item that just brought me right back to the oppressive and brainwashing Soviet regime. The kids are singing an Obama song in the classroom and the teacher very enthusiastically working with the class on the song. If the teachers are so patriotic, they should then implement singing the National Anthem or recite The Pledge of Allegiance? I bet they didn't sing songs to be ""pro-American"" during Bush or even Clinton era. Is it because we made history this time around and the teachers are proud to pretend that we actually chose our first Black president or is it because we chose our first socialist president? Have our ""educators"" been victorious in finally achieving the first steps in socialist direction, therefore the song seems appropriate? Very recently, we have noticed teachers disallowing the Pledge of Allegiance because it invokes God and yet we praise a man who we don't know much about and is only in the office for 4 years? Recently, a teacher decided to disallow and omit ""God Bless the USA"" from the program, saying that it is too much of a song for the young kids. The parents were fine with the song, the kids enjoyed learning it and yet it was too much? I guess singing and praising Obama in the song is not too much? This reminds me, very much, of the times when we were forced or better yet, asked with enforcement, to learn songs about the revolution, Lenin, Stalin and recite poems in former Soviet Union. Dictators love to be praised and it is just too hard for me to ignore that this ""school song"" about Barry Obama is just an innocent celebration of historical event. Sorry, I am not buying it!!To wrap things up and let you go ahead, get out of the house, away from the computer and watch this incredible, eye opening film, I would just like to say a few more words. In my personal opinion, I have been noticing a trend. The trend is that even the far left is not able to ignore at times. Yes, we have some very left liberals, but when faced with pure socialism, they tend to realize, that it is not their cup of tea or brand of vodka. The other day, I was watching CNN and the headlines were ""Obama Revealed"", so I guess the Prince of Poppers has been revealed, even by his loyal legions of the left wing media. Even MSNBC's Rachel Maddow had a presentation on Obama's extreme and possible martial law and that should have been a sign that a very liberal Rachel is just not buying the whole ""Hope and Change"" any longer? Even they did not sign up for what the most elusive and secretive ""president"" has to offer. When Obama promised to transform and change America, those who praised it, might have not realized that, he actually meant what he said, but perhaps they were just not listening?Also

The author begins by noting certain similarities in his own and Obama's upbringing. Being of Indian origin and of the same age as Obama, D'Souza understands the kind of British-inspired anti-colonialism that Barack Sr. would have felt and how it would have resulted in the kind of worldview that President Obama that he uses to view the planet.D'Souza does something the mainstream media has NEVER done... he has sought those who knew Obama prior to his candidacy for president. And as he illustrates in this film, the media reaction to D'Souza's scholarship by the mainstream media is scoffing disbelief and continued ignorance: the disgraceful treatment of Obama's half-brother living in Kenya (why? Because he doesn't share the vision of Barack Sr.), the influence of a CPUSA member on a young Obama, the divorce of Obama's mother from her second husband when he turned out not to be the revolutionary she thought he was... all fascinating. Yet not worthy of CNN or the New York Times.Why would Obama back Argentina's claim to the Falklands over the British? Why would Obama order away the bust of Winston Churchill out of the Oval Office? Well, if your father hated the British as much as Barak Sr. you might not be so sympathetic to the British role in history either.Anyone, pro- or anti-Obama, who thinks they're going to watch a hit piece when viewing 2016 will be disappointed.

167933,A140XH16IKR4B0,1400322715,Jean E. Pouliot,"[76, 288]","In ""2016: Obama's America,"" Dinesh D'Souza makes the case that President Barack Obama is trying to fulfill his father's anti-colonial dream of destroying America and allowing the rise of the ""United States of Islam."" The film is a curious mix. It includes dramatic recreations of past events (notably and repeatedly, a young Obama grieving at his father's grave), interviews (including some with friends of Obama's father), graphics (the Statute of Liberty drowning in a sea of red ink!), guest narration (by Barack Obama himself from the audio version of his books) and some of the most audacious jumps of logic this side of the Olympics.The list of the film's flaws, outright lies and intellectual dishonesty is endless.D'Souza starts by dramatizing a conversation with a nave white college kid who tries to ingratiate himself with D'Souza by telling him how blown away he was by the awesomeness of India, D'Souza's home country. D'Souza cuts him off, citing his country's poverty, caste system and bride burning tradition. Having thus defeating the mighty, liberal college student, he claims to have bested Jesse Jackson in a debate, when (he claims) Jackson could not name a single instance of overt racism in the US. Whether true or not, by this encounter D'Souza shows that racism is no longer a potent force in the country, and is just an attempt by minorities to shake down the System for privileges. He illustrates America's color-blindness with a staged scene in barroom full of blacks and whites, celebrating happily together. One of the white kids even bakes a cake for a black friend! Racism is dead!D'Souza then roles out a clever technique: in a voice over, he makes a true claim, but one that his audience will accept as false. The ploy is clever because on its face, he has stated something true. Who can argue? But since his audience likely does not believe the statement, D'Souza communicates the very opposite of what he overtly states. This happens at least twice in the film. Once, D'Souza states that anti-colonialists and their white liberal allies believe that western nations (like Britain, France and the US) colonized African countries to get their wealth. Then, on a visit to Hawaii, he meets with a historian who claims that missionaries, merchants and politicians overthrew the government of Hawaii in the 19th century to allow the US to annex the islands and grab their wealth. To anyone with a modicum of education, these two claims are utterly true. Belgian troops committed horrible atrocities in the Congo to brings its wealth, mostly rubber, back home. The Spanish and English were notoriously brutal in removing indigenous peoples to extract riches from their lands. And the US did undermine Hawaiian customs and royalty in order to establish a pretext for annexation that would ""save"" the islands. D'Souza is either ignorant of these facts, or assumes that his audience will be unaware that their country participated in such skullduggery.Early on, D'Souza claims that Obama has shut down oil drilling off US shores, but is subsidizing oil drilling in Brazil and elsewhere. He spins the short moratorium on drilling after the Deep Sea Horizons explosion as a permanent ban. In fact, Obama has expanded drilling off the US Coast. The claim that the US wants Britain to give the Falklands back to Argentina is also nonsense. And claiming that Obama has ""done nothing"" to constrain a nuclear Iran is an outright lie.D'Souza claims that in 2008, no one knew who Obama was. He was, according to D'Souza, and with no evidence whatsoever, the great Black Messiah, embraced by whites who didn't care about Obama as such, but only wanted to participate in a historic election to raise a black man to the presidency. It is true that Obama rose quickly the from Illinois senate to the US Congress, where he had served only six years. But Obama had written two probing and intelligent book about himself -- one in 1995, the other in 2006 -- that laid out his intellectual development and influences. His 2004 speech to the Democratic Convention brought him to the attention of a wide segment of American voters. Barack Obama was hardly unknown in 2008, especially after a grueling primary season in which he and Hillary Clinton, who were in a death struggle for the White House, campaigned in all 50 states and debated 28 times.The interviews with friends of Obama's father are amateurish and slanted. D'Souza wants desperately to tie the father's supposed anti-colonial rage to his son. He finds one old friend, a man whose grasp if English is rudimentary, to state that the Obama senior and junior ""are one."" It was clear to me that the man was saying something no more controversial than that the son was a chip off the old block - perhaps looking the same or having similar personalities. To suggest that this man was making a nuanced conclusion that the president shares his father's politics stretches logic to breaking. In an interview with Obama's half-brother George, D'Souza tries to show that Obama has not done enough for his own family. But the canny Obama refuses to take the bait to denigrate his brother. Barack has his own family to support, says George. By helping the world, he says, he helps me. Bravo!Large sections of the movie feature Barack Obama himself, reading from his books ""The Audacity of Hope"" and ""Dreams from My Father."" This gives the impression that Obama is hanging himself with his own words. But while the words are Obama's, the wild conclusions are all D'Souza's. Obama, says D'Souza, has anti-colonial rage, somehow inherited from a man he hardly knew, to diminish America and put it at the mercy of foreigners. He wants to create a ""United States of Islam"" that will be a threat to the United States. This is ""proven"" because Obama supported attacks on Libya to protect its citizens, while refusing to attack Syria which is also attacking its citizens. That the geopolitics around each country are radically different (Syria is geographically closer to Israel, for a starter) matters little to D'Souza.Nearly every one of the film's statements and conclusions is open to challenge. By the end of the film, I was dazed by its inanity and begging for it to end. Just one more example. D'Souza tracks Obama's childhood years in Indonesia, where he lived with his mother and his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro. According to the movie, Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, was appalled that Lolo was getting involved with American oil interests who were bribing their way into influence. But rather than admiring Dunham's distaste for corruption, D'Souza blames her for trying to flee Lolo's ""Western"" ways. And where did this crazy leftist turn to flee the evils of western corruption? Hawaii!! She hated America so much that she fled a Third World nation for the U. S. of A.!It's hard to know whether D'Souza is merely partisan, or dishonest or just not very bright. His premises are shaky or wrong. His conclusions do not flow from them. But the effect on a certain segment of the American populace is unmistakable. The 40-some-odd folks who watched the film with me were all white and of retirement-age - the Tea Party demographic -- some of who were annoyingly vocal about being in synch with the film's conclusions. These are the unreachables in our body politic, having neither the basis in factual knowledge nor discernment required to understand that they are being lied to.But I wonder about D'Souza himself. He was bred in India, a country still suffering the after-effects of British colonialism, just ended in 1947. Wouldn't he be the one who was prone to unrecognized rage about colonial powers? After all, Obama was an American citizen raised in Kansas and Hawaii, with only a 5-year stint in Indonesia. D'Souza spent his first 17 years in Mumbai, before coming to the US in 1978. One has to wonder whether his entire oeuvre is to project his own fears and inadequacies on others. Why not? If Obama can be haunted by the political views of a man he met only twice in his life, why not Dinesh, who spent his formative years in a Third World country, with a US education his only means of escape?""2016"" is a mess of lies, half-truths, and truths presented as lies. Frankly, it says more about the author than about its subject. And it says a great deal about a citizenry that is willing to swallow whole, and without evidence, paranoid and baseless conclusions about the inner workings of the mind of what, to all outward appearances, is a man who loves his country and wants it to prosper.",1,This guy went to Dartmouth?,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,8552,"['2016', 'Obama', 'America', 'Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'case',

The shame is what has become of the American electorate and their willingness to buy into one half baked conspiracy theory after another. We have almost completely given up on selecting our officials based on the facts and instead rely on childish emotional responses fed to us by a right wing hate establishment.  Obama is one of the most moderate and pragmatic Democratic presidents in our history, any historical review of the EVIDENCE will confirm this assessment.  His policies towards Africa have actually been a step backwards from those of his predecessor.  I found the in abstentia psychological assessment in the movie the most disturbing element and a flatly ridiculous premise. What radical influences were needed to stimulate a desire for universal health coverage?  Something the rest of the civilized world took care of decades ago.  What radical influences were needed to push an intelligent and pragmatic President to seek a path of moral authority and diplomacy over a the path of being a world bully and our all to frequent ""yur fur us or agin us"" mentality. Finally, the whole conjecture of the film, that an Obama second term would produce disastrous consequences flies in the face of the FACTS from the last four years. What circumstances in the second term will eliminate a stonewalling GOP that has blocked almost every piece of meaningful legislation proposed by the President, many of which emerged from the Republican party or affiliated think tanks.  The President's power is not absolute and his ability to affect long term change is far more nuanced than the film would lead us to believe.",1,"An Atrocious Disservice to America, Not Obama",1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,1737,"['film', 'bad', 'American', 'politics', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'elected', 'officials', 'shame', 'what', 'become', 'American', 'electorate', 'willingness', 'buy', 'one', 'half', 'baked', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'have', 'almost', 'completely', 'given', 'up', 'selecting', 'officials', 'based', 'facts', 'instead', 'rely', 'childish', 'emotional', 'responses', 'fed', 'right', 'wing', 'hate', 'establishment', 'Obama', 'one', 'most', 'moderate', 'pragmatic', 'Democratic', 'presidents', 'history', 'historical', 'review', 'EVIDENCE', 'will', 'confirm', 'assessment', 'policies', 'towards', 'Africa', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'step', 'backwards', 'predecessor', 'found', 'abstentia', 'psychological', 'assessment', 'movie', 'most', 'disturbing', 'element', 'flatly', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'What', 'radical', 'influences', 'were', 'needed', 'stimulate', 'desire', 'universal', 'health', 'coverage', 'Something', 'rest', 'civilized', 'world', 'took', 'care', 'decades', 'ago', 'What', 'radical', 'influences', 'were', 'needed', 'push', 'intelligent', 'pragmatic', 'President', 'seek', 'path', 'moral', 'authority', 'diplomacy', 'path', 'being', 'world', 'bully', 'frequent', 'yur', 'fur', 'agin', 'mentality', 'Finally', 'whole', 'conjecture', 'film', 'Obama', 'second', 'term', 'would', 'produce', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'flies', 'face', 'FACTS', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'What', 'circumstances', 'second', 'term', 'will', 'eliminate', 'stonewalling', 'GOP', 'blocked', 'almost', 'piece', 'meaningful', 'legislation', 'proposed', 'President', 'many', 'emerged', 'Republican', 'party', 'affiliated', 'think', 'tanks', 'President', 'power', 'not', 'absolute', 'ability', 'affect', 'long', 'term', 'change', 'far', 'more', 'nuanced', 'film', 'would', 'lead', 'believe']",N/A

It's one fault it's credited by those who oppose it, is that it shows a side to President Obama that his faithful either can't tolerate or refuse to hear.  Further they don't want YOU to hear it!  So, now they are getting on here with their reviews (most of which if they were honest would have to admit they NEVER saw the film) and are nonetheless giving it a one star rating just to poison the effects of this documentary.  This film is a very courageous statement if you really consider who made it & produced it.Let me ask you a few questions and you will need to be open minded and fair.  Have you ever wondered why Obama's background (his political views and idealogy) weren't more vetted?  Have you ever questioned the source of your information?  Is it the mainline press on either CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, or ABC news?  I would venture that 85% of the top level broadcasters or news analysts, news writers, reporters, or news producers are either extreme left leaning or consider themselves Democrats.  Why does this even matter?  Because even the best of news people can't help but have their political bias show through... and the worst among them purposely slant and ignore important news stories that don't show their political ""Rock Stars"" in a good light.  If these channels had been more committed to unbiased news then there would never have been a Fox News.  The reason Fox News has now overtaken all the other news broadcasts in the rating is that they don't ignore the news stories that are breaking they report on them and follow the story to wherever it leads or investigate it to try to find out how or why it happened.  If you were college educated do you realize that 80% of the university professors are also clearly left leaning.  These institutions have even given entry and refuge to 60's radicals who clearly have agendas and actively plotted to overthrow our government.  Some of these very people have the President's ear and are his advisers.  Do you know that the President's election team in 2008 tried to buy his former pastor's silence?  It's because they knew if you heard, really heard what he believed you would be forced to think what was Obama thinking to stay in this man's church for all those years!Getting back to this film... clearly this IS a film that the people in Obama's reelection campaign do not want you to see.

D'Souza presents it like-this is what I found, this is what I discovered, and this is what I will predict will happen. You don't have to believe his prediction, he is presented it, so you can form your own opinion.For me, some of it seems like a real possibility considering his history so far these past four years. Other stuff may be far fetched.I found his upbringing to be very enlightening and shed light on he really is.I never trusted Obama, didn't think he had enough experience to rule our country.

I thought the film attempted to be objective in its evaluation of the inner workings of the mind of a collectivist.  Those who criticize the film because it mentions the mentors of Obama influenced his thinking process are just ignorant of the facts.  We are all a product of what we have read and studied in our life.  It is clear President Obama's far left radical ideas came from his many communist and socialist teachers and from the books he studied throughout his life.  Anyone who thinks stealing from those who produce in order to give to those who refuse to produce should never be trusted to govern a free country.It is also obvious that we fail to learn from history.  Socialism has failed all over the world (Greece, Italy, France, spain), yet we seem to be heading in that direction every day.  The last four years have been clearly a failure under President Obama's leadership, but the majority of people drank the cool aid and reelected him to another four years.  Well, if you liked the last four years, you will love the next four years.In conclusion, this is a film every American should see in order to better understand the true and real meaning of the President's ""Hope and Change"" philosophy.Rating:  5 Stars.

In this documentary he takes the Presidents autobiography and retraces Obama's footsteps to try and understand what motivates the President in his relentless pursuit of America's downfall. D'Souza begins by describing Obama senior and his immigration from Kenya. He trace the Presidents footsteps and meets many influential figures. One of Obama's many half brothers and his best friends from childhood to his election for Illinios senate.Obama's actions are very clear after watching this documentary. He stopped offshore drilling and gave billions of dollars to other countries so that they could make more oil rigs in the gulf. He is taking away our defense capability by reducing our stockpile of nuclear weapons, as well as making crippling cuts to our military. He dishes out money to those who don't want to work. He also bypasses congress and goes to war in Libya and Egypt. All the while tripling our national debt. It is now 3 times what all 43 presidents totaled conbined. America is nearly on it's knees.Dinesh D'Souza uncovers the things in Obama's past that make him intentionally destory our contry. This documentary is very objective and informative. If you are curious about the President's motivation and aim over the next 4 years, this documentary spells it out very clearly. Obama has already disregaded the constitution more than once, he may find a way to become President longer than 8 years. If anyone watches this documentary and still thinks that Obama should be the President, I think the country and it's prosperity are not important to those people. Free stuff is most likely all those people care about. Obama doesn't give out free stuff. He uses taxpayer money to do that.Being a graduate of Dartmouth one would think that Dinesh D'Souza would have a skewed liberal view of politics. This documentary, however, is very objective.

He included GLOBALISM as part of America's ""recipe"". Oh REALLY ??? That sure as HELL is not part of the USA's ""recipe"" NOR is it a part of our Constitution.Oh yes, we are allowing it to creep in {can't believe I have to say anything so disgusting and true} but the way he said that was if it's just us and the way we are. Very matter of fact. Well I'd like to say NO IT IS NOT. If we let it happen yeah, we are going to get swallowed by Globalism. {New World Order}. NO IT IS NOT ""PART OF OUR RECIPE"". I am really annoyed by that statement and Dinesh ought to explain himself on that statement of his.2. Made the occupy movement sound only negative. It didn't go perfectly no, but hey, at least some people got off their butts to protest what is going on. We are supposed to do that, we're Americans and we have the right to get mad and protest.3. There was a third point and I forgot it - likely I'll remember it. When I do I'll come back and edit. It was something Dinesh said that didn't jibe - it was just as odd his weird statement that ""Globalism is part of the American recipe"".I thought this DVD was otherwise brilliant and I believe it - but WHAT THE F. with this guy and his crap that the USA has Globalism in it's ""recipe"". ? Listen carefully to him in this film. You might come across the third oddball statement of his that I'm having trouble remembering-Dinesh had me agreeing with nearly everything but he'd slip in these bizarre statements.So I don't entirely trust him, and after seeing the DVD I sure as Hell don't trust Obama.

Fellow students and friends were hanging on every word and I remember celebrations and joyful outbursts floating across campus the night he won. It just didn't make sense to me and I always felt like something wasn't right. Here was a man who came out of nowhere, swooned everyone into loving him, and had no clear experience or new ideas to bring to the table. I always felt that something was missing and I couldn't put my finger on what it was about Obama that I found so frightening. I'm a conservative but it was more than just a difference of ideas. There was something about what he said and it made me uneasy. I figured he was just incompetent and unable to rise up to the role of Leader of the Free World. That may very well be true. However, 2016: Obama's America finally proposes a theory that makes sense and does it in a compelling and respectful manner.Dinesh D'Souza did his homework and takes us into Obama's past, present, and the probable future if he retains power in the White House. One thing I really appreciated about this film was that it examines Obama's life and beliefs without being mean-spirited. There are no personal attacks, hateful remarks, or unfair shots. Everything is calmly and easily laid out in a conversational manner, sucking the viewer in without insulting their intelligence. There's also nothing in here about Romney or any Republican candidates. This is solely Obama's film and he is the main focus.D'Souza's theory is brilliant and he uses Obama's own words to prove his points. For the past few years I kept trying to figure out how Obama could do what he does and why so many harmful and questionable policies have been enacted. D'Souza's assertion that Obama holds an anti-colonial view of America was the missing puzzle piece I was looking for. Granted, only the president himself knows what he really believes. This is simply the theory that makes the most sense and I believe it's spot on. The facts and interviews are very revealing and give D'Souza's commentary the weight they need to really be persuasive. The production values on the film are excellent. This doesn't look like some half-baked documentary or propaganda piece. It moves at a brisk pace and keeps you engaged from start to finish. The last ten minutes are especially chilling and a serious look at what America, as well as the rest of the world, may look like if Obama gets four more years. Any open-minded and serious voter should see this and give it consideration.If you're an Obama supporter then chances are you've either dismissed this film or haven't seen it, which I'm guessing many of the negative reviews here prove. On the flip side, the detractors will feel validated after watching this and it will probably reiterate what you already know. Every American needs to be informed and make up their own mind after examining all of the facts.

168029,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,1400322715,Mark Turner,"[80, 111]","Documentaries have never been a popular film genre in the U.S. On occasion a rare documentary will capture the attention of the film going public, it will get an increase in hype and the movie will take off at the box office. But for the most part it rarely happens which is sad.More sad it the recent trend in documentaries to be so over the top one sided that most become more propaganda than actual films about the topic being discussed. Rather than take movies like this to task for some reason, they've been held as the standard for the genre. The most blatant example of these are the films made by Michael Moore. Having won an Oscar for one and having made the most financially successful documentary to date, Moore's films are more about himself and his beliefs than they are about an open minded discussion of ideas seeking a center of the road approach. In Moore's films, it's his way or the highway. The fact that numerous web sites have popped up to show the falsehoods in his films says a lot.So into this genre comes a new picture. And just like Moore's film FARENHEIT 9/11 which was released only weeks before this country voted for a new President, so has this film been released, in theaters months before hand but now on DVD within a month of the national election for President. That film is 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA.I'll admit up front that I tend to lean conservative when it comes to politics but when I'm watching a film I try to judge it based on what it presents, how it presents it and just how misleading it can be. There have been propaganda pieces done by the right as much as by the left. The only difference is that in Hollywood to lean right means to be chastised as out of touch or a traitor so folks rarely have movies made with that political perspective. If you don't think that's true, try telling Stacy Dash.So when I sat down to watch this film I wanted to see if it was no more than a film much like the ones Moore has made or was it more of a true documentary? I'm glad to say that while it doesn't present President Obama in the best light, it does seem well researched and even handed. Rather than insert insults and caustic comments, the film offers interviews with various participants and allows them to speak for themselves.Co-writer/co-director/co-producer Dinesh D'Souza based most of the movie on his novel THE ROOTS OF OBAMA'S RAGE. He begins the film by discussing similarities to his life and that of Obama. Both had a foreign parent, both are men of color, both were born in the same year, both went to Ivy League schools and both graduated from those colleges. But their views on this country and how their views were shaped were vastly different. Where D'Souza saw this as a land of opportunity, Obama's views were of a country where America was trying to rule the world rather than present opportunity.D'Souza focuses much of his research and opinions on the books that Obama wrote, especially DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. In the title alone he theorizes that Obama wasn't writing about dreams presented from his father to him but dreams that his father had. These greatly involved anti-colonialism and in so doing present an image of why he has followed up trying to do some of the things he has done while in office. One example is of his sending a bust of Winston Churchill back to England which many questioned. The reason presented here is that it represented the British Empire which had held his father's land in check for many years.While the better part of the film is discussing the things that D'Souza researched, it doesn't just stick with his ideas but presents the facts through archived footage of the President as well as interviews with people who knew him and his father. The most talked about interview involves his half brother George, a man living in poverty who has never talked to his half brother nor asked him for anything. This man presents a much different picture of the President's father than we've heard before.It also leads to a fearful prediction of where this country will go if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. This is the only section where rather than go with straight facts D'Souza theorizes as to what might happen. Granted, he uses the words of those interviewed as well as information well known about the President's past history and who he was shaped by while growing up, but it's still just theory. The good part is that D'Souza never presents it as anything more than that. It's his belief, something Moore never seems to state in his films.While the movie is well made and well researched, it is sure to cause controversy, more so since the DVD release has been made so close to the election. It is a film that many should watch just to find out things that the major media failed to discover or at least reveal during the election of 2008.Sadly the film will find supporters that will cheer portions of it blindly thinking of it as an attack film which it definitely is not. Those on the other side of the fence will condemn the film and talk about how it's filled with lies while never viewing it. Rather than allow the far ends of either right or left make the decision for you, I would suggest that people watch the film and make up their own minds. I would also suggest that rather than except anything seen as pure fact, do more research and find out the answers to the questions it raises. In any event, this is one film that should be seen.",4,EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,5448,"['Documentaries', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'popular', 'film', 'genre', 'U.S.',

168030,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,1400322715,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[8, 12]","I read ""The Roots of Obama's Rage,"" on which this movie is based, shortly after it came out. I agree with much of what Dinesh D'Souza says about Barack Obama, and D'Souza builds the case around his thesis very competently: Obama was groomed to be an anti-colonialist, sees the U.S. as a colonial power, and is dedicated to ""correcting"" our society to make up for past mistakes.  Unfortunately, Obama's approach, if successful, will cripple--if not destroy--American culture, and it will take decades to repair the damage.Some of the problems people have mentioned, with this movie, are the flashbacks and D'Souza's insertion of his own personal experiences as an immigrant coming from a background almost identical to Obama's. I don't find the flashbacks annoying, but D'Souza's personal journey was, perhaps, a bit overplayed. Obama's own memoirs and the comments of his friends offer more than enough evidence to support D'Souza's claims.The Jesuits used to say, ""Give us a child until he is seven, and you can have him for the rest of his life."" That's true: the events that played out in young Barry's life formed who he is as a politician. Even his most ardent supporters would benefit from watching this film and considering some of the questions posed by Obama's early experiences.Two mentors are given the attention they deserve: Frank Marshall Davis, who is such a hardcore Communist he makes Stalin look just slightly to the left of Joe McCarthy, and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who is still stung by Obama's rejection of their relationship.I was impressed that D'Souza included a few segments with Daniel Pipes, one of the world's foremost experts on radical political Islam. I've followed Pipes for years, and have yet to find his analysis of any issue off the mark. Pipes is solid; the film is worth watching just for his comments.Obama's view of America's place in the world is disturbing on a very fundamental level. He almost speaks in code when he makes statements about foreign policy, but if you KNOW the code, his perspective is pretty creepy. This will help you understand why he says what he says, and what impact those statements will have on the country in the coming years, if he's re-elected. (We've recently seen some of how this plays out regarding the Benghazi murders.)This movie gives every registered voter important information about the candidate. If you haven't had time to read ""Dreams from My Father"" or ""Roots of Obama's Rage,"" this movie will give you insight into both books.In less than a week, the election will be decided. Whether or not Obama wins, the message of this movie will resonate. Viewers will either be relieved that we dodged a major cultural bullet, or we'll know what we need to brace ourselves for.Either way, it might be a good time to start reciting the prayer to St. Michael.",4,How fast can we decline in four years?,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2830,"['read', 'Roots', 'Obama', 'Rage', 'movie', 'based', 'shortly', 'came', 'out', 'agree', 'much', 'what', 'Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'Barack', 'Obama', ""D'Souza"", 'case', 'thesis', 'very', 'competently', 'Obama', 'was', 'groomed', 'be', 'anti-colonialist', 'U.S.', 'colonial', 'power', 'dedicated', 'correcting', 'society', 'make', 'up', 'past', 'mistakes', 'Unfortunately', 'Obama', 'approach', 'successful', 'will', 'cripple', 'not', 'destroy', 'American', 'culture', 'will', 'take', 'decades', 'repair', 'damage.Some', 'problems', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'are', 'flashbacks', ""D'Souza"", 'insertion', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'immigrant', 'coming', 'background', 'almost', 'identical', 'Obama', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'flashbacks', 'annoying', ""D'Souza"", 'personal', 'journey', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'overplayed', 'Obama', 'own', 'memoirs', 'comments', 'friends', 'offer', 'more', 'enough', 'evidence', 'support', ""D'Souza"", 'claims.The', 'Jesuits', 'used', 'say', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'can', 'have', 'rest', 'life', 'true', 'events', 'played', 'out', 'young', 'Barry', 'life', 'formed', 'who', 'politician', 'Even', 'most', 'ardent', 'supporters', 'would', 'benefit', 'watching', 'film', 'considering', 'questions', 'posed', 'Obama', 'early', 'experiences.Two', 'mentors', 'are', 'given', 'attention', 'deserve', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'Davis', 'who', 'hardcore', 'Communist', 'Stalin', 'look', 'just', 'slightly', 'left', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'Rev', 'Jeremiah', 'Wright', 'who', 'still', 'stung', 'Obama', 'rejection', 'relationship.I', 'was', 'impressed', ""D'Souza"", 'included', 'few', 'segments', 'Daniel', 'Pipes', 'one', 'world', 'foremost', 'experts', 'radical', 'political', 'Islam', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'Pipes', 'years', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'analysis', 'issue', 'mark', 'Pipes', 'solid', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'comments.Obama', 'view', 'America', 'place', 'world', 'disturbing', 'very', 'fundamental', 'level', 'almost', 'code', 'when', 'statements', 'foreign', 'policy', 'KNOW', 'code', 'perspective', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'what', 'what', 'impact', 'statements', 'will', 'have', 'country', 'coming', 'years', 're-elected', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'seen', 'how', 'out', 'regarding', 'Benghazi', 'murders', 'movie', 'registered', 'voter', 'important', 'information', 'candidate', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'read', 'Dreams', 'Father', 'Roots', 'Obama', 'Rage', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'insight', 'books.In', 'less', 'week', 'election', 'will', 'be', 'decided', 'not', 'Obama', 'wins', 'message', 'movie', 'will', 'resonate', 'Viewers', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'relieved', 'dodged', 'major', 'cultural', 'bullet', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'need', 'brace', 'for.Either', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'start', 'reciting', 'prayer', 'St.', 'Michael']",N/A

168032,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,1400322715,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[130, 168]","For those unfamiliar with the premise, 2016: Obama's America follows bestselling author Dinesh D'Souza's carefully chosen steps as he travels the world in an attempt to better understand Barack Obama. The journey takes him from the Hawaiian Islands to Indonesia; from the slums of Nairobi, Kenya to the seat of the world's largest superpower in Washington, D.C. Along the way he interviews relatives, scholars, and other sources of information on Obama's life.This movie should not be mistaken for a conspiracy theorist's quest for truth on Obama. There are no baseless charges or accusations based on the place of Obama's birth, religion or college transcripts. In fact, about fifteen minutes into D'Souza's film he matter-of-factly states Obama was born in Hawaii, as was reported by two Hawaiian newspapers on the day of his birth. Even Slate's Dave Weigel begrudgingly acknowledges D'Souza stands on ""mostly solid"" ground, steering clear of conspiracy charges making rounds in conservative circles.Instead, D'Souza intentionally traces the steps of Obama's upbringing, attempting to explain Obama's sometimes baffling decisions. Decisions like returning a bust of Winston Churchill to Great Britain at the beginning of his presidency, delaying the construction of the Keystone pipeline while giving money to South American countries to drill for oil, cherry-picking where to intervene in the Middle East (e.g. using force in Libya but not Iran or Syria), reducing America's nuclear arsenal while making no moves to stop Iran from making nuclear weapons, and reducing NASA's mission to Muslim outreach are all examined. D'Souza's conclusion? Obama is an anti-colonialist.Anti-colonialism, D'Souza explains, is the worldview that sees America's net effect in the world as bad, not good. It also is the belief that America and European countries got wealthy not through capitalism, entrepreneurship, and innovation, but by exploiting Third World countries and stealing their natural resources.Through interviews with Obama's father's friends and colleagues, and a close examination of some of Barack Sr.'s written work, D'Souza shows that Obama's father espoused this very worldview. Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, though only married to Barack Sr. for a short time, always loved and respected him. By reading passages from Obama's book, Dreams from My Father, D'Souza shows that Ann passed many of Obama's father's beliefs to our president when they lived in Indonesia with her second husband during Obama's childhood.As Obama grew older, he began associating himself only with leftwing radicals. A passage from Dreams reveals Obama picked his friends ""carefully"", choosing to associate himself only with those who shared his political and cultural beliefs.Some of these associations are just scary. Frank Marshall Davis became a close mentor of Obama's during his formative years. In Dreams from My Father, Obama mentions Davis numerous times attesting to their close relationship. Davis was a Communist Party member who was under constant surveillance by the FBI, who had direct orders to pick him up immediately if war ever broke out between the Soviet Union and the United States. Of course, there are also the more well-known associations of Obama like Bill Ayers, the known leftwing terrorist, and Jeremiah Wright, Obama's pastor of more than 20 years. The relationships between these men and Obama are all explored at length during the film.Some of the interviews in the movie score major points. While in Kenya, D'Souza brings one of Obama's father's wives three goats for the right to talk to talk to her (even though her speaking fee was just one). She quickly turns cold, however, after a phone call and tells Dinesh he must leave. Many of Obama's father's friends and relatives who met Barack when he visited Kenya after his father's death, describe the father's and son's ideology as identical. This is especially chilling after D'Souza shows an article authored by Barack Sr. in which he states it would be theoretically okay to tax people with tax rates as high as 100% as long as they were compensated in return with commensurate government services.D'Souza's coup de grace has to be his time spent with Obama's half-brother George Obama. George is also a scholar of sorts having authored a book a couple of years ago. Unfortunately for George, however, he deviates from the family's anti-colonialist beliefs; thus he is largely ostracized from his family and lives on a couple bucks a day in a small hut in Nairobi, Kenya.George believes that white people, meaning Americans and Europeans, were good for the development of Third World countries. He even goes as far to say that white people were even a net positive in countries like South Africa, where the native population was oppressed and discriminated against for centuries by their colonialists. For proof, George points to the economic development of countries like South Korea, Singapore and South Africa which were once on economic par with Kenya but have now far surpassed the economic prowess of the central African country mired in poverty.The end of the movie turns into a horror show as D'Souza speculates what Obama might wish to do in a second term. In short: You ain't seen nothin' yet. With good reason, D'Souza believes we will see higher taxes, more spending, more attempts to lower the number of nuclear warheads in the U.S. and no resistance to our enemies building their arsenals. Most frighteningly, D'Souza fears a United States of Islam might emerge in the Middle East, isolating Israel even more from the rest of the world.Credit is also due to Dinesh: He lets you see when he falls short. Throughout the course of the interview with George Obama, D'Souza tries to get George to say that Barack should help him more. Instead, George gently demurs and states that he is an adult and perfectly capable of taking care of himself. George says that Barack has enough on his plate without having to help his half-brother he only met once a long time ago. Instead of editing this bit out, however, D'Souza leaves it in, confident enough to let you in on his shortcomings.This is where the similarities to Michael Moore end. While the documentary employs the same slick editing and fast pace of a Moore documentary, it employs none of the ambush/gotcha-style interview tactics commonly seen in Moore's films.As I write this 2016 has surpassed the $20 million mark in ticket revenues, making it the fifth largest political documentary of all-time. To say that the low cost endeavor, with virtually no promotional backing but heavily-promoted by talk radio, has surpassed expectations would be an understatement. The NY Daily News goes as far to proclaim that the movie has ""shocked"" industry insiders. For comparison, Rocky Mountain Pictures, the studio behind 2016, had previously never produced a film that surpassed even $12 million.All in all, D'Souza has given us a highly entertaining and informative feature-length documentary that is well worth the price of admission. Even for someone like me, who follows the news religiously through several mediums, I exited the theater feeling like a I learned a lot about our president, his worldview, and ultimately, where he wants to take the country.",4,"Not Michael Moore hackery, this movie deserves serious consideration",1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,7285,"['unfamiliar', 'premise', '2016', 'Obama', 'America',

This movie needs more facts, and more talking from the President than Dinesh. Way too subjective.Does this documentary provide a little more insight into why Obama thinks the way he does. Yes, I believe Dinesh did a great job there. In fact, I think it makes Obama even more genuine. Obama's past shows the struggles of those around him, how he helps others, and how hard work leads to achieving the American dream.

168042,A25LSNKTK8W9O3,1400322715,Mike Renzulli,"[4, 5]","I must say I like this film. It is based on 2 books authored by D'Souza in which he makes the case that Barack Obama's world view and approach to governing is grounded in anti-Colonialism. In effect, the President wants to see a reduced role for Western civilization (specifically the United States) in world affairs while, simultaneously, strip wealthy countries of their prosperity and redistribute it to third-world nations who have been ""exploited"" by their former occupiers.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! Dinesh D'Souza draws on a variety of sources to make his case. He interviews members of Obama's family, friends of his father and demonstrates the kind of people who mentored Barack Obama in his college days. His mother, Ann Dunham, was the one who emphasized the goodness of Barack, Sr. and demonstrated her far-left sympathies by divorcing an Indonesian man named Lolo Seotoro. As it turns out Seotoro decided he would leave his job as a government relations officer for Union Oil Company and an enlist in his country's military to fight Communist rebels. Barack's father, D'Souza claims, is the most influential figure in his life thanks to the way the mother built him up and can be seen as such in Barack Obama's own book ""Dreams from My Father"". Barack, Sr. was a non-practicing Muslim-turned-atheist educated overseas. Initially, the President's father did have classical liberal/libertarian sympathies but somehow changed as indicated by some of his friends that were interviewed. During his travels, Barack, Sr. irresponsibly married a number of women and fathered numerous children (including Barack, Jr.). Barack, Sr.'s recklessness not only included womanizing but also abusing alcohol and, consequently, Barack Obama's father met his untimely demise in a car accident in Nairobi, Kenya in 1982.The people who played a large role in shaping the President's world view (i.e. Barack Obama's Founding Fathers) were hardcore leftists and anti-Semites such as Frank Marshall-Davis, William Ayres, Jeremiah Wright, and Edward Said. Each of the men who influenced Obama's life condemned the United States and the prospertiy we enjoy and it should be no surprise that Barack Obama is implementing the policies he has. D'Souza makes a very thoughtful critique of Barack Obama effectvely attempting to present an intellectual profile of him in order to make sense of what the President thinks and why.""2016"", however, should not be taken entirely as Gospel. In my review of some of the things brought up, I did discover some issues raised that were incorrect. For example, D'Souza alleges that Obama returned the bust of Winston Churchill to England since Churchil was the person who put down the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya and represented British colonialism. In fact, the Churchill bust was on loan from England and was to be returned to Great Britain before the President took office. A White House spokesperson states another bust of Churchil is in Obama's private residence. In another segment, D'Souza accuses President Obama of wanting to return control of the Falkland Islands to Argentinia from Great Britian. However, back in April 2012 the U.S. nixed the idea by refusing to approve a resolution at a Summit of the Americas conference declaring the Falkland Islands Argentinian territory.The movie further alleges that Obama has not done anything significant to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms. While the President does oppose an interm military strike against the country, the U.S. spearheaded a U.N. resolution imposing strong sanctions against Iran, and U.S. Naval forces were recently increased in the Persian Gulf. Also, three computer viruses were directed at Iran in which all three actions are geared at disrupting their nuclear ambitions or being a buffer against the Islamist regime's influence. Obama's low opinion of Western civilization (including Jews) is further evidenced by his conduct toward Israel along with his courting Islamist regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and siding Egypt's elected President Mohammed Morsi who is a member of the Nazi-sympathizing Muslim Brotherhood despite Morsi's ouster by the Egyptian military.Despite the movie's flaws, I think D'Souza makes a very strong case as to why Obama is conducting himself the way he is. By understanding what influences Barack Obama's world view it is small wonder that the U.S. economy is in such a downward spiral. Not only have the Fed's recent and past constant credit expansions along with new economic laws passed by Congress resulted in the near stagnation we experience, but Obama has (directly or indirectly) redistributed American wealth from the United States to developing third world nations. He not only authorizes the payout of money to Islamist organziations and regimes, he also has spearheaded spending billions of dollars to fund companies (like Solyndra) geared toward renewable energy that eventually went bankrupt. The new offshore oil drilling rules he pushed for has made the process to obtain drilling permits very cumbersome. As a result of this and his moratorium(s), U.S. oil companies are looking to drill offshore in places other than the Gulf of Mexico. His quasi-nationalization of the healthcare and automobile sectors of the U.S. economy is an extension of his low opinion of capitalism too.In her book ""Philosophy: Who Needs It"", Ayn Rand outlines the power of philosophy by showing its influence in uncommon places. Ms. Rand points out in her essay ""Egalitarianism and Inflation"":""There is only one institution that can arrogate to itself the power legally to trade by means of rubber checks: the government. And it is the only institution that can mortgage your future without your knowledge or consent: government securities (and paper money) are promissory notes on future tax receipts, i.e., on your future production.""She pointed out many times in her speeches and writings that if one wants to understand the actions of someone, you need look no further than the philosophy they subscribe to. In the case of Barack Obama, it is a disdain for American prosperity and the ability to flourish. The left looks to drag down America and other Westernized countries and pragmatically allies themselves with like-minded people (such as Islamists) who will help them achieve their goal naively thinking they will be the remnant to restore society to their liking. It does not matter that the ones who helped them will also clamor for power up to and including going to war against their leftist ""friends"" which will lead to total and complete civil unrest.In a recent interview, Dinesh D'Souza discusses how he ended up becoming the brother of Barack Obama's half-brother George who was also interviewed in ""2016"". George believes that it is Kenya (and not the West's fault) that the country is poor. George's son was in need of an expensive medical treatment due to a serious illness he contracted and asked D'Souza for money to pay for it. Upon confirming George's story was true, D'Souza wired George a thousand dollars. When asked as to why George didn't call Barack, essentially, George stated Barack doesn't talk to him anymore.In his book, Barack Obama also talks about a lunch he had in China with his half-brother Mark who is a successful physicist and works abroad. The two had, according to Mark, an ""intense"" and ""overwhelming"" meeting. As it turns out, Mark authored a book based on his experiences growing up with Barack, Sr. whose story revoled around a Jewish mother and an abusive father. Mark has disclosed in interviews that Barack, Sr. was an abusive man and I am sure the discussion the two men had in China centered around just that. Barack did not like the fact that Mark openly told the truth about their father and he would not return to Kenya. Barack Obama continuously demonstrates an altruistic morality and chooses to live in a fantasy land where his father is one he has chosen to emulate and will cut off relations with anyone who does not share his world view or reveals the truth about his ideal man.The philosophical lines were clearly drawn in 2012 with Mitt Romney representing the former private sector executive who worked extremely hard to become the accomplished man that he is. Obama, on the other hand, represents the Harvard and Columbia-educated college law professor who not only never worked a day in his life and also subscribes to a quasi-Marxist philosophy seeking to damn the very civilization that enabled his mobility in order to reward his supporters who leach off the productive. D'Souza points out in his film the learning institutions where Obama let his subconscious (paraphrasing from Ms. Rand) accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, and integrated by his subconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: self-doubt, like a ball and chain in the place where his mind's wings should have grown.Despite ""2016""'s flaws, Dinesh D'Souza has certainly hit the nail on the head in terms of Obama's base philosophy and is a testament to the wisdom of Ayn Rand demonstrating the importance of philosophy and how it can affect or influence one's activities. While it is not my intent to slander the President, however, I urge you to see the other side of the coin and am not specifically refering to voting for the Republican Party. Restoring America to the greatest country on Earth is a priority and all Americans have an obligation to open their eyes by understanding the threat and impact that President Obama's beliefs and actions are having. They are the result of the men who planted the intellectual seeds in the President's mind. That's what D'Souza's movie does a very good job of pointing out.",4,"Like Father(s), Like Son?",1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,9874,"['must', 'say', 'film', 'based', '2', 'books', 'authored',

All this film didis preach to those already converted.Mr. D'Souza was not very honest with his background.  He made it seem as though he was born to the typical Indian household.  In reality he was born into anupperclass Christian, in his case Roman Catholic, Indian family.  He can't really speak to the typical Hindu, let alone Muslim Indian person - just as a Christian American can't speak to that of say a Muslim American.Furthermore, Mr. D'Souza gave examples of why Obama is so bad and one he gave was that he is the first US President who has taken Argentina's side against that of the UK regarding the Falkland Islands.  I for one don't think Britain has any business in a country that is off the coast of Argentina.  In addition, just because he is the first president to think a new way doesn't make him bad e.g. if he were the first President to condemn the genocide of Armenians at the hand of the Turks it would be a good thing!

He was college president of The King's College, a Christian college, until it was revealed that he announced his engagement to a woman while still married to his first wife. He also appeared in a movie, ""Michael Moore Hates America."" He has written many books attacking Obama and liberals: ""The Roots of Obama's Rage?"",""The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11!"", and ""Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream."" Neither the movie nor these books attacking Obama make the connection between him and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, for example. FDR also took over the presidency at the beginning of a depression and is indeed a touchstone for all modern liberals. Did Obama stop us from The Great Depression, Part 2? Doesn't Obama's anti-colonialism have its roots in the birth of America when we overthrew our colonial masters, the English? Aren't all Americans sympathetic to nations economically colonized as a result of our national experience?

He realizes that in order to bring his agenda to full fruition he is going to have to hoodwink the American electorate one more time. Furthermore, he understands that if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are elected much of what he has ""accomplished"" over the past four years is going to be overturned. But make no mistake about it. Barack Obama means business. He will say anything and do anything to secure his re-election. And if you believe he is dangerous right now just imagine President Barack Hussein Obama without the shackles of another re-election bid to tie him down. Author Dinesh D'Souza and Academy Award winning director have contemplated this scenario and offers us a sobering glimpse of what Mr. Obama would do in a second term in the remarkable new documentary film  ""2016: Obama's America"".  You will come to understand what Dinesh D'Souza means when he opined in the companion book ""Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream"" that ""the makeover of America will be so drastic that the `shining city on a hill' will become a shantytown in a rather dangerous global village.""  I saw this film in a theater more than a month ago and I found it nothing less than chilling!  This in spite of the fact that I have read more than a half dozen books about this President over the past couple of years.  I can only imagine the impact this film might have on someone who is completely oblivious to what has been going on.In his popular 2011 book ""The Roots of Obama's Rage"" Dinesh D'Souza theorized that it was really ""anticolonialism"" that shapes Barack Obama's worldview.  Now it is extremely important to understand that the way anti-colonialists like President Obama see it the Western world has grown rich with the gold and raw materials mined in places like Latin America, China and Africa.  In their view this wealth was really not earned....rather it was stolen. Thus, according to the anti-colonialists the optimum way to settle the score and make things right is a massive program of global reparations.  Although President Obama subscribes to this way of thinking he understands that the American electorate would never buy it.  And so he and his minions have devised other means to achieve the very same end.  In ""2016: Obama's America"" you will discover that in order to complete the job before the end of his second term Obama would continue to ratchet up our national debt exponentially which would more than likely result in an economic collapse of monumental proportions.  Thus one could argue that if Obama is re-elected the American people will have essentially voted for their own demise.  Furthermore, if all goes as planned the United States would be through as a superpower and the American people would suffer a steep and painful decline in their standard of living. And as you will discover in ""2016:  Obama's America"" these events would pave the way for increased Muslim influence in the Middle East and around the world. Very scary indeed!Perhaps the most alarming facet of Barack Obama's grand scheme to weaken the United States and diminish our influence around the world is his plan to make drastic cuts to our nation's military. He intends to achieve his by doing the following: 1) continue to slash defense spending, 2) blocking missile defenses and 3) make further drastic reductions in our nuclear arsenal. The President is well aware that China continues to add to its stockpile of nuclear weapons and will achieve parity with the United State in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, you will be distressed to discover that while our esteemed President has drastically curtailed new oil drilling in this country and blocked the construction of the Keystone pipeline he is busy assisting other nations like Brazil, Columbia and Mexico in securing new sources of oil. The American people should be outraged!In my view Dinesh D'Souza and John Sullivan have done the American people a great service by producing this film.  ""2016:  Obama's America"" clearly and logically lays out the facts for everyone to see.  What kind of America do you want to live in?  Clearly this President does not have the best interests of the United States at heart.  It is my sincere hope that ""2016: Obama's America"" will help to sway just enough independent voters to allow us to wrest our country back from those who wish to diminish it.  It would be nice to have a President who is on our side once again.  If you have not yet seen ""2016:  Obama's America"" I would wholeheartedly encourage you to purchase a copy and pass it on to relatives, friends and neighbors after you have viewed it.  The future of our nation is at stake.

Bill Clinton said it best, ""This guy is a Big Fairy Tale."" Dinesh D'Souza tells Barry's life story by using the subjects own words as written in his book, Dreams From My Father. Since Barry actually read his book for the audio version, the impact of the film is enhanced. We all have moments in our life that help shape and point us in one direction or another. In Barry's case, his mother, grand parents, communist mentor (Frank Marshall Davis), and last but not least, his absentee father's memory provided the foundation to his beliefs today. Those of you that might think of Barry Obama as a 'great' leader should see this film to hear in his own words where he came from and how he came to the realization of what America should be. Those who think Barry is the 'worst' President since the inception of the office, should see this film to learn where his 'fair share' mentality came from (dear old dad).

It's amazing to me to read all these reviews and see how many one star categories there are and how many four and five star categories.  Everything from ""right wing"" propaganda inferences to bad filmmaking, to comments about D'Souza's lovelife--it's all over the place.  First of all, like the writing on the DVD cover says ""Love Him Or Hate Him, You Don't Know Him.""  If anyone read Dinesh D'Souza's What's So Great About America, you already are familiar with his views and that's what he brings to this film.  So if you already don't agree with his ideas of American Exceptionalism, then you won't like this film because your mind is already made up. The belief that this country has survived as long as it has with our constitution, the idea that we have equal opportunities, and that we champion free speech and a free economy is the reason we are a country of immigrants and people looking for a better life.  I was made aware of this when I took my daughter to visit the large university that she had been accepted to.  At the hotel we stayed at, there was a large group of students from Thailand who were also looking at this university as a potential place to study.  My daughter roomed across the hall from an engineering student from Malaysia.  Dinesh D'Souza talks of this opportunity as well as he came here to study at Princeton, and much to the chagrin of his family, became a writer, because he realized that in this country he could do whatever his passion led him to do. Yes, this country started out with the anti-colonialism idea of separating ourselves from Britain, but we became so much more.  Why would we want America to be just like the European countries who are going bankrupt, do not have a strong defense, and really do depend on America, that great beacon of light to help defend them from our foes, and believe me they are out there!

Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza is as fierce as ever in exposing the real Obama in his recent book ""Obama's America."" The American voters have two choices in the 2012 presidential election; realizing the American dream as envisioned by the founding fathers or the Obama's dream, which is a world in which countries share wealth and power, and unmake United States as a global leader. Obama has done plenty to alienate Israel to win the minds of Islamists in this country and Islamic nations around the globe. He has minimized the influence of Christian principle on which this country was founded. His foreign and domestic policies have weakened American influence in global affairs. He pushed for elections in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood emerged as victorious, which is not in the best interest of United Sates or Israel, since this group is a known supporter in Islamic terrorism. We have given Egypt an average of $2 billion annually and we help elect anti-American leadership. He has done very little to contain Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Internationally, he's been scaling back America's influence in almost everything.The movie exposes the real Obama by going into his grass roots to understand his political philosophy. Filmed on four continents, it features on-camera interviews with his destitute half-brother George Obama in Kenya, and Philip Ochieng, an associate of Barack Obama, Sr. The film is produced by real heavy weights like, Doug Sain, and Gerald Molen, who produced ""Schindler's List,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Hook."" This film has fired up Americans and it has grossed more than $33 million at the box office, and it is at the top of the DVD charts. The film is also the top-selling documentary of the year and fourth documentary of all time. It uses the best argument of all: Barack Obama's own words from his book ""Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.""Gerald Molen, the producer of this movie has stated that the current scandal involving the film's star and co-director, Dinesh D'Souza should not be used by movie critics to discredit the movie.

This film makes huge leaps and bounds on Obama's past family history in an effort to psychologically profile the man and they do it as if they have intimate knowledge of the man. They screen through Obama's admittedly badly written autobiography and use some elements, leaving out others to hone into the most negative representations of Obama's past and what they believe to be his ""psyche"".

Mr. D'Souza traces the path of Obama's childhood from Hawaii to Indonesia, and also traces the origins of the president's parents.  Extensive quotations are provided throughout the documentary, all from 'Dreams from my Father' and in Mr. Obama's own voice, presumably from an audiobook.  Mr. Obama's remote, idealized father turned out to be a drunken womanizer killed in a DUI, and certain professors that influenced a young Barack held leftist views, all valid and interesting material.  But the conclusions that D'Souza draws from these influences on Obama are beyond hypothetical and cross into paranoid fantasy.First of all, a 'United States of Islam' stretching from approximately Israel to Afghanistan.  In 2016?  Maybe after four hundred years of arguing, not four.  And secondly, so what?  If there were a United States of Islam (and I doubt they would choose that name), it would not be the 'fault' of a U.S. president or even his or her responsibility.  Obama is a rabid anti-colonialist.  Proof?  A Winston Churchill bust scandal and some leftist professors, unconvincing at best.  And the kicker.  Obama secretly wants to run the deficit to such extremes that he will bankrupt the country, and then remold it as a socialist utopia!  By that logic, starting two wars (and keeping funding off the books), and simultaneously providing a massive tax cut just as the baby boomers were preparing to retire would be a far more realistic scenario for bankruptcy.  Also, you could unleash a greedy financial sector without regulation and see what happens, that might bankrupt us too.I had the privilege to hear Bill Clinton speak a year or so ago, and he advised us to hold our noses and watch Fox occasionally just to see what the other side is saying.

What is Obama's worldview and where does he see the USA fitting into the world? Much of the material is drawn directly from Obama himself, by way of audio clips narrated by Obama in his own words, in his own voice, from his autobiography ""Dreams From My Father"" (not of, from).

168157,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,1400322715,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","Dinesh D'Souza opens the film as an ego fest comparing himself to Obama, claiming they are both &#34;mixed race.&#34; He discusses his debate with Jesse Jackson where our author agrees with Jesse that &#34;racism is a reality.&#34; D'Souza claims he is a black man just like Jesse Jackson because when they both hold up their hands, the inside of the palms looks the same. I mean seriously, the guy shows two palms side by side in the film. Wasn't anyone else laughing at this point?D'Souza is also the guy who took his mistress to a family values meeting and wondered what the fuss was about.His impression of Reagan was that he was &#34;not that serious of a guy.&#34;He claims Obama was born in Hawaii, perhaps as an attempt to look factual. D'Souza plays clips of conservative pundits claiming they don't know anything about Obama, followed five minutes later by revealing important things about Obama, in his own words, from his autobiography that would have been available to said conservative pundits. I guess &#34;truthiness&#34; is what counts.The film mentions that the first act of Obama was to return the Churchill bust. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence outside the Treaty Room and is still there as of this writing. The confusion is described by Factcheck: &#34;The White House has had a bust of Winston Churchill since the 1960's. At the start of the Bush administration Prime Minister Blair lent President Bush a bust that matched the one in the White House, which was being worked on at the time and was later returned to the residence. The version lent by Prime Minister Blair was displayed by President Bush until the end of his Presidency. On January 20, 2009 -- Inauguration Day -- all of the art lent specifically for President Bush's Oval Office was removed by the curator's office, as is common practice at the end of every presidency. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence.&#34;The connection of Obama to his father's dreams seems to be a main point of the film, although we never specifically told what those dreams were. D'Souza conjures up guesses from dubious interviews. Obama's father worked within the system. He valued education and attended American universities. At this point D'Souza attempts to rewrite history. Apparently the effects of colonialism was all a good thing.D-Souza doesn't understand why Obama intervened in Libya and not Syria, or why we aren't taking our marching orders from Israel and going after Iran. All one has to do is look at a map to answer that. Coastal areas provide for easy drone access in Libya whose population is concentrated in a small area, no need to use ground troops. The Strait of Hormuz near Iran, which passes much of the world's oil, needs to be stable.D'Souza also gets a failing grade in economics. A communist would not have bailed out the banks or saved the auto industry. Obama has carefully taken steps to prevent socialism.D'Souza also claims the government took over health care. This is not really true. The government is regulating the private health insurance business. Obama adopted a Republican plan that requires people to buy health care insurance. He is forcing people to buy something from the private sector. I can't imagine this is what communist Frank Marshall Davis had in mind, that is, enacting a Nixon plan for health care.What D-Souza doesn't say is that the US and Russia together have the capability to destroy the world 400 times over. Seems once would be enough. It cost money to maintain nuclear weapons, something our one-sided narrator never mentions. He should have quoted Reagan May 16, 1983 &#34; And my goal is the total elimination of nuclear weapons.&#34;The movie is as entertaining and accurate as a Sean Hannity telecast. It draws lines and makes connections that are not there. It relies on the fact that most viewers don't have the background to grasp complex issues or are willing to Google the information.An entertaining film for all the wrong reasons.

168159,A1GOJSM3XB62VB,1400322715,Thomas G. Farrar,"[6, 26]","2016: Obama's America is self-described as an explanation about the politician and his beliefs, and ultimately what will happen if Obama is re-elected in the 2012 election.D'Souza, the writer and narrarator,  describes a curiosity about Obama, who he originally felt a kinship with as a racial minority (in D'Souza's case, from India) who attended an Ivy League School and became involved in politics.  D'Souza joined a radical conservative group at Dartmouth, and eventually worked within the Reagan Administration.D'Souza spends most of the movie investigating Obama's impression of his absent father, and concludes that Obama idolized his missing parent.  For a brief time in the film, D'Souza describes Obama's attempt to fill his father-figures with mentors, including Jeremiah Wright.Ultimately, D'Souza decides that Obama's entire philosphy is based around ""Anti-Colonialism,""  which is the idea that the US (and many West European Countries) exploited third-world/developing countries and should pull back and allow other groups to develop themselves.These ""investigations"" take up the first 80 minutes or so of the documentary.  For the last 5-10 minutes of the movie, D'Souza finally describes what he thinks will happen if the US follows the pattern of Anti-Colonialism, which is the US will lose all of it's nuclear superiority, the economy will decline (and likely collapse), and there will be a new ""United States of Islam"" (yes, those are the author's exact words)through the Middle East.First of all, the claims of Obama being affected by his absent father are likely true at least in part (after all, who isn't affected by their parents, present or absent?).  Secondly, the idea of ""Anti-Colonialism""  is nothing new (look at European countries such as Britain and France pulling away from all of their influence in Africa and Asia), and Obama may be affected by this idea in part as well.So these factors may have influenced Obama and his policies.  D'Souza has found support for his own theory that Obama is pulling US influence away from the world scene to some degree.  However, US foreign policy moves in cycles, and after a push of foreign involvement the US typically pulls back and focuses on domestic issues The Reagan and Bush eras focused externally, while the Clinton era focused internally.  Since George W. Bush, the US seems to be focusing internally again, shown by both Romney and Obama campaigning heavily about the economy and unemployment. This historical pattern is completely ignored by D'Souza, and he seems to be trying to self-fulfill his own prophecy.I also was very disappointed that after trying to support his theory, there was only a tiny percentage of the film devoted to the future.

Much effort is placed on the character of obama's ""dead-beat dad"" absentee father, a true leftist-loser who returned to Kenya after some years abroad at various universities. Unable to find the success he believed he deserved, obama senior spent his last years as an abusive, chronically unemployed alcoholic.Then there is the mother, ...another parental figure largely absent from her responsibility. When one reads the biographies of various leftists, prominent and obscure, ...chronic dodging of responsibility and an overt lack of accountability is really quite common. The priority for barry's mother appears to have been the pursuit of her liberal politics combined with international philandering.Many of the facts detailed in this movie were known to me from previous reading, ...however, I did not know that barry was an illegitimate bastard!In fact, obama-the-father was already married in Kenya, when he was engaging in his deceptive daliance with stanley ann dunham.So who IS this pretentious buffoon who just appeared out of nowhere?All the basic questions are answered in this film. Despite being largely abandoned by his parents, barry was raised by his mother's parents. The dunham family ensured  that their grandson was exposed to ultra-left radicals at a very young age, most notably a notorious communist-journalist, frank marshall davis. In his priveledged college years, this list would include edward said, and lefto-terrorist bill ayers. The 20 year affiliation with racist white-hating ""preacher"" jeremiah wright has continued up until very recently, ...until it became a potential impediment to barry's political career.So what will be the end-result of another 4 years of this highly questionable individual at the helm of OUR nation? We have a ""president"" who DOES NOT love our country.This individual and his followers desperately want to believe that America and the West are ""inherantly racist"" and undeserving their hard-won prosperity.

I have to admit, I wasn't very exciting about going, but they didn't want to go alone and I had agreed to go, so I went.  The movie is a documentary based upon narrator Dinesh D'Souza's 2010 book, THE ROOTS OF OBAMA'S RAGE. As far as documentaries go, 2016 isn't terrible. There are parts of the movie that are well-researched (for instance, it's far better researched and documented than some of the stuff in Al Gore's AN INCOVENIENT TRUTH), but then there are other things that aren't as well documented, presented, or researched. As far as having an agenda, not all, but most documentaries have an agenda of some sort. The difference between 2016 and many other documentaries is that the agenda of the movie has a conservative bent instead of a progressive one. Personally, I didn't learn anything new by watching 2016. It's stuff that I've heard before. Being from Illinois, I've known about Obama and his socialist ideology long before he gave that 2004 Democratic National Convention key note address that made him famous.

Perhaps the best part of this biographical story is utilizing Barack Hussein Obama's own words and video clips of his speeches that leave any objective viewer little doubt as to the motivations, influences and intentions of Obama.  Mr. D'Souza is neither sensational nor biased in his conveyance of the facts; he merely shares the details of his research, and effectively uses Obama's narrative from ""Dreams of my Father"" to enable viewers to draw their own conclusion about Obama.  And unless the viewer is in a state of denial, the litany of truisms and details as well as the documentation of Obama's USA-hating, communist-embracing mentors leaves little doubt about our President's mission as well as the irreparable harm he is likely to cause if our unwitting American public elects Comrade Obama for a second term.

It attempts to portray Obama as unreliable and beholding to values unAmerican, such as altruism, empathy, sympathy, the very bedrock of any social group's hope to be continuous in time and not destroy itself ripping itself to shreds to suck whatever value it can away from the herd. All civilization depends on the herd, and all war and destruction is born in the elites.Fascism is not a word that the bottom half of the American intelligence distribution fully understands. Nor has any of them even heard of, much less read, the most influential book of the 20th Century: ""Propaganda"" by Edward Bernays (cousin of Freud). It was from this playbook that Goebbels fashioned NAZI Germany. It is from this playbook that rupert murdock manages fox news. If you seriously read many of the reviews here, you will discover comments essentially of the order ""I knew Obama was a bum before I had ever heard of him."" These are the same folks who would reelect gwb or his (proven) even more evil twin romney. America's greatest threat is the absolute ignorance of history so fashionable amongst the anti-intelligentsia and their Pavlovian reflexive embrace of unconscionable greed as the ""American Way"". A great British philosopher and thinker, W. Olaf Stapledon (ex: Star Maker), in the 1920's was so advanced in his realization of group behaviors that his contemporaries had no idea what he was talking about and he had to turn to science fiction to bring his thinking to a wider audience. He liked to create civilizations based on sound humanistic self-reinforcing ideas that allowed a civilization to rise to great heights and then describe in great detail how those same values would mutate just slightly over time and lead to the absolute destruction of the civilization. We are seeing that here in America at this time. ""Freedom"". It has made America strong and powerful. Now, ""freedom"" is being used to justify complete economic domination of all Americans by a psychopathic, completely parasitic, greed-deranged elite who, themselves, see the herd as their rightful victim (there's one born every minute and one born every hour to take them) and are developing ever more invasive and powerful tools to enslave Americans into their trap of debt. There is only one determinant of 'right' in America, only one source of power at this time: Greed. The Constitution has been pushed aside, the ownership of America taken from the people and given to the clinical psychopaths comprising our elite. Corporations have become their tool of parasitism, sucking our energies from us and packaging them for delivery to the elite and dropping a few crumbs to the more easily corruptible amongst us who, themselves, make Judas look like the right kind of guy. There is not a senior corporate executive in America who would not have sold Jesus down the river for the bottom line. Again, ""Freedom"" has been corrupted to mean freedom to enslave, freedom to punish monetarily those who choose not to jump through the shiat-covered hoops exactly when and how high corporate dictates. Have any problem and the credit score slave collar tightens until you become almost a non-citizen unable to find housing, food, even a job. Good luck, America. The same American parasites who fully supported German National Socialism (NAZIs) in the 1930s and into the 1940s (even as we were at war with them) are now aiming at you with the same tools. That, organized innuendos and outright lies, is what this video is about. If you buy the message, please don't forget to apologize to your children for the harm you are doing to them now and in the future. Slavery is measured by the limits on one's options. Ask a recent college graduate out of the middle class (your child?) what their options are. That is slavery. And it's creeping over all of us. And there is only one way to rid ourselves of this curse because the psychopaths who make up this now hereditary deranged elite will not free us without a fight. We must shave these people off the hide of our America and bury them. We'll grow a new elite, but they will be much more honest and polite.",1,America sinks into fascism,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,4276,"['artfully', 'deceptive', 'twisted', 'image', 'man', 'sophisticated', 'varied', 'childhood', 'who', 'clearly', 'not', 'driven', 'personal', 'greed', 'corruption', 'portray', 'Obama', 'unreliable', 'beholding', 'values', 'unAmerican', 'such', 'altruism', 'empathy', 'sympathy', 'very', 'bedrock', 'social', 'group', 'hope', 'be', 'continuous', 'time', 'not', 'destroy', 'ripping', 'shreds', 'suck', 'value', 'can', 'away', 'herd', 'civilization', 'herd', 'war', 'destruction', 'born', 'elites.Fascism', 'not', 'word', 'bottom', 'half', 'American', 'intelligence', 'distribution', 'fully', 'even', 'heard', 'much', 'less', 'read', 'most', 'influential', 'book', '20th', 'Century', 'Propaganda', 'Edward', 'Bernays', 'cousin', 'Freud', 'was', 'playbook', 'Goebbels', 'fashioned', 'NAZI', 'Germany', 'playbook', 'murdock', 'manages', 'fox', 'news', 'seriously', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'discover', 'comments', 'essentially', 'order', 'knew', 'Obama', 'was', 'bum', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'are', 'same', 'folks', 'who', 'would', 'reelect', 'gwb', 'proven', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'twin', 'romney', 'America', 'greatest', 'threat', 'absolute', 'ignorance', 'history', 'so', 'fashionable', 'anti-intelligentsia', 'Pavlovian', 'reflexive', 'embrace', 'unconscionable', 'greed', 'American', 'Way', 'great', 'British', 'philosopher', 'thinker', 'W.', 'Olaf', 'Stapledon', 'ex', 'Star', 'Maker', '1920', 'was', 'so', 'advanced', 'realization', 'group', 'behaviors', 'contemporaries', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'had', 'turn', 'science', 'fiction', 'bring', 'thinking', 'wider', 'audience', 'liked', 'create', 'civilizations', 'based', 'sound', 'humanistic', 'self-reinforcing', 'ideas', 'allowed', 'civilization', 'rise', 'great', 'heights', 'then', 'describe', 'great', 'detail', 'how', 'same', 'values', 'would', 'mutate', 'just', 'slightly', 'time', 'lead', 'absolute', 'destruction', 'civilization', 'are', 'seeing', 'here', 'America', 'time', 'Freedom', 'made', 'America', 'strong', 'powerful', 'Now', 'freedom', 'being', 'used', 'justify', 'complete', 'economic', 'domination', 'Americans', 'psychopathic', 'completely', 'parasitic', 'greed-deranged', 'elite', 'who', 'see', 'herd', 'rightful', 'victim', 'one', 'born', 'minute', 'one', 'born', 'hour', 'take', 'are', 'developing', 'ever', 'more', 'invasive', 'powerful', 'tools', 'enslave', 'Americans', 'trap', 'debt', 'only', 'one', 'determinant', ""'right"", 'America', 'only', 'one', 'source', 'power', 'time', 'Greed', 'Constitution', 'been', 'pushed', 'aside', 'ownership', 'America', 'taken', 'people', 'given', 'clinical', 'psychopaths', 'comprising', 'elite', 'Corporations', 'have', 'become', 'tool', 'parasitism', 'sucking', 'energies', 'packaging', 'delivery', 'elite', 'dropping', 'few', 'crumbs', 'more', 'easily', 'corruptible', 'amongst', 'who', 'make', 'Judas', 'look', 'right', 'kind', 'guy', 'not', 'senior', 'corporate', 'executive', 'America', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'sold', 'Jesus', 'river', 'bottom', 'line', 'Again', 'Freedom', 'been', 'corrupted', 'mean', 'freedom', 'enslave', 'freedom', 'punish', 'monetarily', 'who', 'choose', 'not', 'jump', 'shiat-covered', 'hoops', 'exactly', 'when', 'how', 'high', 'corporate', 'dictates', 'Have', 'problem', 'credit', 'score', 'slave', 'collar', 'tightens', 'become', 'almost', 'non-citizen', 'unable', 'find', 'housing', 'food', 'even', 'job', 'Good', 'luck', 'America', 'same', 'American', 'parasites', 'who', 'fully', 'supported', 'German', 'National', 'Socialism', 'NAZIs', '1930s', '1940s', 'even', 'were', 'war', 'are', 'now', 'aiming', 'same', 'tools', 'organized', 'innuendos', 'outright', 'lies', 'what', 'video', 'about', 'buy', 'message', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'apologize', 'children', 'harm', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'future', 'Slavery', 'measured', 'limits', 'one', 'options', 'Ask', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'middle', 'class', 'child', 'what', 'options', 'are', 'slavery', 'creeping', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'rid', 'ourselves', 'curse', 'psychopaths', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'now', 'hereditary', 'deranged', 'elite', 'will', 'not', 'free', 'fight', 'must', 'shave', 'people', 'hide', 'America', 'bury', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'new', 'elite', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'honest', 'polite']",N/A

I actually gained respect for him, as his upbringing is atypical for a modern President. He is portrayed as an abandoned son looking to know his father. A man who really was undeserving of the hero worship his son bestowed upon him. In fact what I took is the need to meet his father's false legacy groomed a Young Barack Obama into the liberal activist who would eventually become the first African American President of the United States. It really is the true American Dream, I think a lot of his detractors don't really appreciate the journey this man has taken, this film articulates his journey very well.The last third of the movie can be seen as the conclusions section.

Next, the producer goes around trying to ""find out"" who Obama is, and starts with talking to a psychiatrist, who I think was definitely a far right-wing republican. This MD ought to lose his license, if he is even an MD to start with. He diagnosed a patient without ever examining them, or ever speaking to them. Plus, he seems to think that Obama has issues, over child abandonment, and surprisingly wants to be just like his father, imagine that? Hogwash, pure and simple!The producer goes to Africa next, only to get ran off by the authorities when he approaches a relative of the presidents, which he should have, and rightfully so. After this, he heads into the village, and finds a so-called friend of Obama's father, who then swears, with a slur, that he's just like his father, and the same guy looks like he's drunk to me, and was probably paid to say it. You could see his bloodshot eyes, and the way he can barely form a sentence.This claptrap goes on and on, alluding to Obama being a socialist-communist, due to his father, but they never come right out and say it, more than likely afraid of being sued. They do this by trying to continuously compare him to his father, who was supposedly a socialist in Kenya. However, there are a lot of socialist states in Europe, like Greece, or even the UK, which this same producer is calling communists by this label. Socialized government and communism are two different things.After I finished the DVD, which was mailed to me by a republican arm known as the ""Citizens Awareness Project"", I removed it from my PC, and threw it in the garbage, where it belongs.

I think Dinesh's theory was vindicated by US efforts promoting what happened in Egypt(before the coup in 7/2013), Libya, and Obama's insane efforts to get the US involved in the middle of the Syrian civil war. Eventually, military officers now silenced/'retired' and the 'civilian'  survivors (silenced under Dept of State gag orders) of the  ghastly Benghazi atrocities will tell what happened....
