The Hardball skit where he calls Osama bin Laden an Uncle Tom is utterly timeless humor.

Nor did I mind Chris Rock on the bill.  I couldn't have told you who Tracy Morgan was.  Oddly enough, after watching all four discs, each at around an hour, Tracy Morgan was probably my favorite of the bunch.  I dug it.  Some really hilarious and imaginative skits (though probably could've done without the Conan O'Brian show spots, but those were 'extras' on special features).  Second in the running would have been Sandler who is hilarious even in his very young days, as anyone knows (Opera Man, etc!). Then Chris Rock also good fun.  And last but not least Eddie Murphy!  I was really surprised that I should enjoy them in this order but so it went.
