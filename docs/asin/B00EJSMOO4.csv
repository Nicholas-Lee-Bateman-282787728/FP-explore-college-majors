The plots are mundane but half the fun is how they get there. And, who doesn't love Dick Van Dyke? The guy is a national treasure. Victoria Rowell has a flair for understated comedy and still looks beautiful. All in all, it's a good way to spend an hour or two.",4,Nice clean entertainment!,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,350,"['Okay', 'was', 'never', 'destined', 'Emmy', 'good', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'plots', 'are', 'mundane', 'fun', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'guy', 'national', 'treasure', 'Victoria', 'Rowell', 'flair', 'understated', 'comedy', 'still', 'beautiful', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'two']",N/A

1667482,A1R84LGQX6DMJ8,B00EJSMOO4,Michael Serrano,"[3, 3]","Like apparently a lot of other people I first saw this show with a parent back when it was on. I quickly became a fan and now own all 8 seasons. I've always been a fan of Dick Van Dyke and actually enjoy this show more than his more famous show from the sixties. They don't make shows like this anymore. The cast is perfect, with each bringing his or her talents to the murder solving table. The cast come across as actual friends, none of the petty sniping or insults, or the more popular sexual innuendo that transgresses almost every show today. These shows are about murder, but do play out as a family friendly show. I'm no prude, but just simply enjoying these murder mysteries for entertainment value is not the norm today. Now the shows have to have an edge or taboo subject matter to be considered &#34;good entertainment&#34;. The DVDs themselves are fine with no trouble playing them, and the picture is pretty good as well. VEI the company that puts these DVDs out has done a very commendable job. One small quibble though I noticed in the season five series cliff hanger episode &#34;Obsession&#34; is missing a certain scene. In the scene Dr. Mark Sloan goes to visit villain Carter Sweeney at radio station to appear on his radio talk show. In the original broadcast Dr. Sloan walked down the hallway and viewers were treated to a snippet of the Dick Van Dyke show episode, &#34;100 Hours&#34; in which Rob Petrie is doing a radio broadcast. Dr. Sloan looks at Rob and shakes his head in amusement, then proceeds to Carter Sweeney's broadcast booth. I assume VEI was unable to secure rights to this fun little clip. Viewers of the Dick Van Dyke show season four can see this clip in the extras section. Other than that I would very much recommend this set to any lovers of entertaining murder mysteries. It's surprising how much fun murder can be.",5,Excellent Fun Entertaining Murder Mysteries,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1862,"['apparently', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'parent', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'quickly', 'became', 'fan', 'now', 'own', '8', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'famous', 'show', 'sixties', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'shows', 'anymore', 'cast', 'perfect', 'bringing', 'talents', 'murder', 'solving', 'table', 'cast', 'come', 'actual', 'friends', 'none', 'petty', 'sniping', 'insults', 'more', 'popular', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'almost', 'show', 'today', 'shows', 'are', 'murder', 'do', 'play', 'out', 'family', 'friendly', 'show', ""'m"", 'prude', 'just', 'simply', 'enjoying', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'norm', 'today', 'Now', 'shows', 'have', 'have', 'edge', 'taboo', 'subject', 'matter', 'be', 'considered', '34', 'good', 'entertainment', '34', 'DVDs', 'are', 'fine', 'trouble', 'playing', 'picture', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'VEI', 'company', 'DVDs', 'out', 'done', 'very', 'commendable', 'job', 'One', 'small', 'quibble', 'noticed', 'season', 'five', 'series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'episode', '34', 'Obsession', '34', 'missing', 'certain', 'scene', 'scene', 'Dr.', 'Mark', 'Sloan', 'visit', 'villain', 'Carter', 'Sweeney', 'radio', 'station', 'appear', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'original', 'broadcast', 'Dr.', 'Sloan', 'walked', 'down', 'hallway', 'viewers', 'were', 'treated', 'snippet', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'show', 'episode', '34', '100', 'Hours', '34', 'Rob', 'Petrie', 'doing', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'Dr.', 'Sloan', 'Rob', 'shakes', 'head', 'amusement', 'then', 'Carter', 'Sweeney', 'broadcast', 'booth', 'assume', 'VEI', 'was', 'unable', 'secure', 'rights', 'fun', 'little', 'clip', 'Viewers', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'show', 'season', 'four', 'can', 'see', 'clip', 'extras', 'section', 'Other', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'set', 'lovers', 'entertaining', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'murder', 'can', 'be']",N/A
