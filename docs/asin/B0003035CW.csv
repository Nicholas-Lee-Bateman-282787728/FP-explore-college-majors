Every last song was familar to me & I could have sang along to every one(except no one,including myself,wants to hear me sing).They were, and still are, a great band. I saw them live once but by then Domenic Troiano had replaced Bachman.(I can't blame Bachman for leaving- he sold 30 million albums with Bachman Turner Overdrive). There are 4 BTO songs performed here as well as the Guess Who hits(no complaint). Burton still has a great voice & Bachman has left a big mark in r&r; history.Unfortunately the video quality is not very good considering this concert is from 2000. The close-ups are fine but it seems the further the shot the worse the video quality. This was quite noticable on my 55"" tv. It's also 4:3 aspect ratio.

853835,A26Y0Q3FALSDDY,B0003035CW,G. K. Beaulieu,"[3, 3]","Living in Canada and being of a certain age, you tend to forget how many songs The Guess Who created that became part of the soundtrack of when you were growing up. This concert DVD pulls together most of those songs in what is a tremendous performance. Burton Cummings might not be the easiest guy to work with, but his talent is unquestionable and he gives a good effort here, even though his voice isn't quite what it was in his prime. Randy Bachman these days may be better known as a radio show host on CBC, but the man was and is an incredible guitarist and songwriter. Some of his guitar work on this DVD is fantastic, to the point where he blows up one guitar in the middle of American Woman and the guitar tech has to provide a replacement. Donnie MacDougall is hugely underrated, as he is a talented vocalist and fine guitar player. Garry Petersen and Bill Wallace keep the beat as a solid rhythm section and add good backing vocals. One of the things you forget about The Guess Who is the quality of their vocal arrangements, and this lineup does a good job of recreating those.A comment on American Woman -- the version here is the same as that on ""Live at the Paramount"", with the extended bluesy opening... ""whatcha gonna do when the roast beef's gone?""... just fabulous, I had a smile on my face a foot wide.There are two downsides to this set. The concert was shot on video in 2000 in standard-def and so video quality is not of the same standard as later DVD sets. There is also an annoying sound issue with the concert on some tracks, where volume seems to be capped or filtered for some reason, and the level seems to vary. I didn't notice it on every track, but it's definitely there on a few.For me, these are minor issues for such a superb performance by such a great band. Buy this.

Well I can now safely say I was not disappointed. They still sounded great although a bit toned down in the vocal department, which is understandable being that they are pushing past 60 in some cases. Randy Bachmanseems to benifit from the years of playing beyond The Guess Who,he really hits every note and jams the solo's more than ever. He was a real joy to watch and the standout of the show.The sound and visual quality of the show were quite good. The mixing was well done, and the set list was great. There was a Thunder and Lightening rumbling in the backround, which was quite fitting, as The Guess Who were creating some sparks of their own. Only one thing bugged me just a little about the DVD, it has six bonus tracks which is great but you can not play them along with the regular show. You have to go into a seperate menu and start each song, one by one kind of dumb. I mean ok gimmie bonus/encore tracks let me just watch them without all the monkey business.

In the marketplace, they held their own but could and should have been a commercial behemoth. Maybe we diehards are lucky they weren't; we may not have ""Live At The Paramount"" in it's expanded version to feed us smart, cynical, edgy pop/rock all these decades hence.The DVD has it's problems, for sure, but I don't think they add up to all that much. I like what I hear a whole lot and like what see a little less. But the best bands of the '70's tended to be uninterested in image and instead concerned themselves with superior songwriting and kick [...] live performances. This sort of work and marketing ethic is foreign to most modern bands and their fans, but it sure made for some awesomely great records. That it fails to deliver us sexy video in 2009, well, you'll excuse me for excusing them.I have admired Burton Cummings' feisty attitude, craftsman's work ethic and consistent fearlessness in the studio and onstage for 40 years. Bachman is a superb musician, whose jazz chops delight me every time. But Cummings threw some risky long balls without him on ""Share The Land"", while Bachman was handing off to less talented journeymen with BTO.I know I have failed miserably to actually review this DVD. Can't help it. I love this band, admire everything about them, and while I note the technical problems with the DVD, they do not stop me from enjoying the proceedings thoroughly. Get the CD if the visuals don't work for you. If the sound is a bummer for you, pull out the old CD's and relish how great they were. Personally, I want it all. This band was just too friggin' good.BTW...avoid the current ""GW"" like the plague. It's original rhythm section Peterson & Kale with 3 or 4 ringers. Kale was booted from the band in 1973 for being a selfish drunk. Now, he thinks he's getting revenge. Don't give this goon the satisfaction. JUST SAY 'NO' to ""Kale's Klones"" masquerading as The GW ! Imagine Pink Floyd without Gilmour OR Waters...the Stones without Mick OR Keith...The Who without Townshend OR Daltrey.

853856,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0003035CW,trebe,"[1, 1]","Running Back Through Canada features a live performance of a reformed version of the Guess Who, recorded in 2000, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the hometown of members Burton Cummings, Randy Bachman, Bill Wallace, Garry Peterson, and Donnie McDougall.This performance is particularly notable, because the band had to stop playing and leave the stage, due to rain and a lightning storm.  Fortunately, they were able to return and continue the performance, before a loyal and appreciative audience, who waited through the rain.  The main feature is a 15 song 90 minute performance.  Among the bonus features are six additional songs, an interview with the members of the band, and extensive rehearsal footage.  All in all, this a really nice release for fans of these veteran rockers.Although challenged by the weather conditions, and the pressure of playing before a hometown audience, everyone on stage seems very relaxed and in good spirits.  Dressed in an Elvis shirt, Burton Cummings is centerstage behind his keyboard stand.  His voice sounds more mature, but still has power, and displays the same unique singing style, that first made the band a major success in the late 60's.Randy Bachman is showing his age a bit, but is clearly having a wonderful time.  Even with the massive career he went on to have with Bachman Turner Overdrive, Randy has always been underrated as a guitarist and songwriter.  It's very cool that the Guess Who included three BTO songs in their set, ""Looking Out For #1"" and ""Let It Ride"", both performed with acoustic guitars, and the rocker ""Takin' Care Of Business"".Most of the band's better known songs are included in either the main performance or the bonus tracks.  High points include ""No Time"", ""Undun"", ""These Eyes"", ""American Woman"", ""Laughing"", ""Hand Me Down World"", ""Share The Land, and ""No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature"".  The lesser known ""Tailsman"", is also a special treat.The video presentation is very relaxed and easy going, without the constant cuts prevalent today.  Coverage of the band is good, and the editing is sensible.  When a solo is being played, that's what the cameras are usually focused on.  Image quality however, isn't always the greatest, as there are some instances of softness and pixelization.  Perhaps the weather was a factor, but it's not really that big of a distraction.  Sound options are Dolby 2.0 stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.Bachman, Cummings, and Peterson, formed the nucleus of the group, during their breakout period in the late 60's.  McDougall and Wallace joined the band post-Bachman,  during the 70's.  Although this particular lineup never played together as the Guess Who during the band's glory days, they still have good chemistry together, and are obviously intimately familiar with the material.  If you are a Guess Who fan, you will certainly appreciate this DVD, and the warm memories it may generate.",4,"braving the elements, the Guess Who shine before their hometown crowd...",1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,2909,"['Running', 'Back', 'Canada', 'live', 'performance', 'reformed', 'version', 'Guess', 'Who', 'recorded', '2000', 'Winnipeg', 'Manitoba', 'Canada', 'hometown', 'members', 'Burton', 'Cummings', 'Randy', 'Bachman', 'Bill', 'Wallace', 'Garry', 'Peterson', 'Donnie', 'McDougall.This', 'performance', 'particularly', 'notable', 'band', 'had', 'stop', 'playing', 'leave', 'stage', 'due', 'rain', 'lightning', 'storm', 'Fortunately', 'were', 'able', 'return', 'continue', 'performance', 'loyal', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'who', 'waited', 'rain', 'main', 'feature', '15', 'song', '90', 'minute', 'performance', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'six', 'additional', 'songs', 'interview', 'members', 'band', 'extensive', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'really', 'nice', 'release', 'fans', 'veteran', 'rockers.Although', 'challenged', 'weather', 'conditions', 'pressure', 'playing', 'hometown', 'audience', 'everyone', 'stage', 'very', 'relaxed', 'good', 'spirits', 'Dressed', 'Elvis', 'shirt', 'Burton', 'Cummings', 'centerstage', 'keyboard', 'stand', 'voice', 'more', 'mature', 'still', 'power', 'same', 'unique', 'singing', 'style', 'first', 'made', 'band', 'major', 'success', 'late', ""60's.Randy"", 'Bachman', 'showing', 'age', 'bit', 'clearly', 'having', 'wonderful', 'time', 'Even', 'massive', 'career', 'went', 'have', 'Bachman', 'Turner', 'Overdrive', 'Randy', 'always', 'been', 'underrated', 'guitarist', 'songwriter', 'very', 'cool', 'Guess', 'Who', 'included', 'three', 'BTO', 'songs', 'set', 'Looking', 'Out', '1', 'Let', 'Ride', 'performed', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'rocker', 'Takin', 'Care', 'Business', '.Most', 'band', 'better', 'known', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'main', 'performance', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'High', 'points', 'include', 'Time', 'Undun', 'Eyes', 'American', 'Woman', 'Laughing', 'Hand', 'Me', 'Down', 'World', 'Share', 'Land', 'Sugar', 'Tonight/New', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'lesser', 'known', 'Tailsman', 'also', 'special', 'treat.The', 'video', 'presentation', 'very', 'relaxed', 'easy', 'going', 'constant', 'cuts', 'prevalent', 'today', 'Coverage', 'band', 'good', 'editing', 'sensible', 'When', 'solo', 'being', 'played', 'what', 'cameras', 'are', 'usually', 'focused', 'Image', 'quality', 'however', ""n't"", 'always', 'greatest', 'are', 'instances', 'softness', 'pixelization', 'Perhaps', 'weather', 'was', 'factor', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'distraction', 'Sound', 'options', 'are', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround.Bachman', 'Cummings', 'Peterson', 'formed', 'nucleus', 'group', 'breakout', 'period', 'late', '60', 'McDougall', 'Wallace', 'joined', 'band', 'post-Bachman', '70', 'particular', 'lineup', 'never', 'played', 'together', 'Guess', 'Who', 'band', 'glory', 'days', 'still', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'obviously', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'material', 'are', 'Guess', 'Who', 'fan', 'will', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'warm', 'memories', 'may', 'generate']",Guess Who - Running Back Thru Canada

I was at the concert and I will never forget it. I can recall the darkening, menacing skies, with lightening flickering all over the area. Would we be spared from a downpour? We weren't, but with an unforcasted intermission, the show went on. The ten-minute intermission lasted over an hour due to the weather. Fortunately, the rain didn't last all evening. They actually risked electrocution by playing on instead of calling it a night, which made the evening all the more special. From watching the DVD commentary in between songs, the band was actually more concerned about the wind picking up and blowing apart the covered stage.The band sounded fantastic. You might expect the sound at an outdoor show to be mediocre, but that wasn't the case from I stood, on the field. Seeing Randy Bachman play live only enhanced, in my mind, his status as a guitar virtuoso. Witness his euphoric, dazzling soloing on the jam part of American Woman. The Guess Who are my favorite Canadian band and at this warm summer evening show, I was in my glory. I only wish they had played another encore. Clearly, they left the audience wanting more. I know I would see them again and again and again, if I could.The Guess Who have a huge amount of strong material, much more than they could play in a show. Some of the lesser known, but equally appealing songs that were played included: Rain Dance, Guns Guns Guns, Talisman and Glamour Boy. Also included was the Bachman-penned BTO hit, Takin' Care of Business and Takin' Care of Number One.The now swelte Bachman looked liked a well-fed grandfather, with the beard and a bit too much girth. Donnie McDoougall and Bill Wallace on guitar and bass, respectively, didn't look anywhere near their 50-something years from my vantage point. Burton Cummings looked like he was in his 40s. Drummer Gary Peterson looked like he could lose a lot of weight, but he was solid in his performance and that's all that really matters.There are some things you see in the DVD that I didn't notice from the show. During the American Woman jam, Bachman took a drumstick from Cummings and used it to run up and down the fretboard, which resulted in a string breaking, You suddenly see the broken string swaying by itself in the camera close-up.There are a couple of things about the DVD that I was disappointed in. The concert was originally filmed for a 2-hour television broadcast. Consequently, six of the tracks are not part of the main feature, but they are relegated to the bonus section of the disc. It would have been better if all 21 tracks were played sequentially. There an inlay card, but no extensive liner notes. There's nothing that actually tells you who is in the lineup on the card.The DVD also includes an interview and footage from one of their rehearsals. Although the concert was already aired on TV, I'm glad I purcased the DVD and I know I will watch it over and over again.",5,"magical reunion concert, must-have!",1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,3088,"['was', 'shopping', 'Mom', 'spotted', 'newly', 'released', 'Guess', 'Who', 'DVD', 'Running', 'Back', 'Thru', 'Canada', 'was', 'filmed', 'Goldeyes', 'baseball', 'park', 'Winnipeg', 'June', '2000', 'was', 'concert', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'can', 'recall', 'darkening', 'menacing', 'skies', 'lightening', 'flickering', 'area', 'Would', 'be', 'spared', 'downpour', 'were', ""n't"", 'unforcasted', 'intermission', 'show', 'went', 'ten-minute', 'intermission', 'lasted', 'hour', 'due', 'weather', 'Fortunately', 'rain', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'evening', 'actually', 'risked', 'electrocution', 'playing', 'instead', 'calling', 'night', 'made', 'evening', 'more', 'special', 'watching', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'songs', 'band', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'concerned', 'wind', 'picking', 'up', 'blowing', 'apart', 'covered', 'stage.The', 'band', 'sounded', 'fantastic', 'might', 'expect', 'sound', 'outdoor', 'show', 'be', 'mediocre', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'stood', 'field', 'Seeing', 'Randy', 'Bachman', 'play', 'live', 'only', 'enhanced', 'mind', 'status', 'guitar', 'virtuoso', 'Witness', 'euphoric', 'dazzling', 'soloing', 'jam', 'part', 'American', 'Woman', 'Guess', 'Who', 'are', 'favorite', 'Canadian', 'band', 'warm', 'summer', 'evening', 'show', 'was', 'glory', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'played', 'encore', 'Clearly', 'left', 'audience', 'wanting', 'more', 'know', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'could.The', 'Guess', 'Who', 'have', 'huge', 'amount', 'strong', 'material', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'play', 'show', 'lesser', 'known', 'equally', 'appealing', 'songs', 'were', 'played', 'included', 'Rain', 'Dance', 'Guns', 'Guns', 'Guns', 'Talisman', 'Glamour', 'Boy', 'Also', 'included', 'was', 'Bachman-penned', 'BTO', 'hit', 'Takin', 'Care', 'Business', 'Takin', 'Care', 'Number', 'One.The', 'now', 'Bachman', 'looked', 'liked', 'well-fed', 'grandfather', 'beard', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'girth', 'Donnie', 'McDoougall', 'Bill', 'Wallace', 'guitar', 'bass', 'respectively', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anywhere', '50-something', 'years', 'vantage', 'point', 'Burton', 'Cummings', 'looked', 'was', '40s', 'Drummer', 'Gary', 'Peterson', 'looked', 'could', 'lose', 'lot', 'weight', 'was', 'solid', 'performance', 'really', 'are', 'things', 'see', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'show', 'American', 'Woman', 'jam', 'Bachman', 'took', 'drumstick', 'Cummings', 'used', 'run', 'up', 'fretboard', 'resulted', 'string', 'breaking', 'suddenly', 'see', 'broken', 'string', 'swaying', 'camera', 'close-up.There', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointed', 'concert', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', '2-hour', 'television', 'broadcast', 'Consequently', 'six', 'tracks', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'main', 'feature', 'are', 'relegated', 'bonus', 'section', 'disc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', '21', 'tracks', 'were', 'played', 'sequentially', 'inlay', 'card', 'extensive', 'liner', 'notes', 'nothing', 'actually', 'who', 'lineup', 'card.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'interview', 'footage', 'one', 'rehearsals', 'concert', 'was', 'already', 'aired', 'TV', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purcased', 'DVD', 'know', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",Guess Who - Running Back Thru Canada
853858,A1N998SR39ZV25,B0003035CW,"UnderTaker Fanatic ""Eccentric Collector""","[42, 42]","I rate this Guess Who concert above and beyond the standard 5 stars. It's fabulous.There are about 22 songs including their bonus songs.Burton Cummings has not lost anything over the years. Not even his boyish and crazy charm with adorable,sexy expressions.He looks great and is as gorgeous as ever.If possible, Burtons voice is better than it ever was.They do all their hits almost exactly in the original format with alot of extra added to them.I loved them back in the 60's and 70's and do still now.Randys incredible on the guitar too with mega closeups of his hands playing.Infact, ever solitary one of them are incredible musicians.Better than I remember.American woman was done in such an incredible way but one song that sticks out as well is Talisman.They have never performed it in concert other than in their Finland concert tour.It seems to me that all the groups that were popular when I was young(Not that I'm that old.I am 48 to be exact) are coming back or or are still going strong.It goes to show exactly where all the musical talents lie and there is no doubt in my mind that The Guess Who is back and will be for a very long time.The songs performed are:Albert Flasher, No Time, These Eyes,Glamour Boy,Rain Dance,American Woman,Talisman,No Sugar Tonight,Lookin' Out for #1,Share the Land,New Mother Nature,Runnin' Back to Saskatoon,Takin' Care of Business,Laughing,Bus Rider & Undun.Plus you get 6 bonus songs and a 20 minute interview and rehersal hall segment.The Guess Who plays for their home town crowd in Winnipeg and the crowd adores them and it is very obvious.Infact, the group performed in a very bad thunder and lightening storm that included severe down pours but never the less with the bad storm and all the entire crowd didn't budge.They stayed for the entire concert rain and all.It was so dangerous that the group had to leave the stage for about an hour and when they returned everyone was still there.Absolutely one incredible and very exciting concert from one of the best musical talents in the world.I recommend this to everyone.It is well worth the price.I have many concerts plus I am a musician and this has got to be now my favorite.I don't know what else to say other than if you are a Guess Who fan then you will most assuredly love this dvd.I recommend buying it before you can't anymore.The entire concert is over 2 hours.Also....the camera man did one heck of a job filming this with many closeups of all their faces and their hands playing.The band features Burton Cummings,Randy Bachman,Garry Peterson,Donnie Mc Dougall and Bill Wallace.Simply awesome!!!!What a performance they give!!!!!",5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!
