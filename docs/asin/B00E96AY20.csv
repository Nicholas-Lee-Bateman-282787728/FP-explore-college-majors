1666373,AE23DYT0RDFUV,B00E96AY20,Brian Ridgway,"[2, 3]","I've always been a big fan of Steve McQueen's work, but like many kids growing up the in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the bulk of my exposure to McQueen came from his later films like Bullet and The Getaway. But I've always enjoyed classic television westerns (moreso now that I've turned that 'post-40' bend) and I decided it was time to go back and check out some of McQueen's earliest television work. While 'WANTED&#34; sports very conservative production values, and the stories are all neatly wrapped up in their alloted 24-minute an episode time frame, each chapter in this series manages to tell a concise, tightly-written, sometimes humorous, and always exciting western tale. McQueen's character of JOSH RANDELL, at first, seems one-note and single-minded, but as you watch the series, you realize he follows a very strict code of honor and is much more than his 'bounty-hunter' label would suggest. Most episodes feature an up-and-coming Hollywood film or television actor/actress, and the sparkling Black and White photography is crisp and sharp. You'll soon become addicted to watching these shows, and the overall entertainment value per package is far HIGHER than you will receive from most current television series collections. Fans of the 'film' McQueen won't be disappointed, as you will see the earliest incarnations of many of his ongoing on-screen habits, manners and style.

As a collector of films and TV shows for over 30 years I have never seen such a shoddy way of presenting and protecting the contents within this case. Inside all the DVD discs are slipped into CD paper sleeves that cost maybe .10 cents and they stack into an internal plastic box that is barely large enough to hold all the discs without cramming them into it.  To watch a single episode you must first remove all the paper sleeved discs and then sort through them to find what you want then cram them back into the small internal box.  (the sleeves provide the friction needed to hold them into place)  A few times doing this and the sleeves will fall apart, and without the sleeves the discs will just rattle around that box, causing untold damage.  For this reason alone I rated it 3 stars.  If you order this box set be sure to order one or two cases that will hold mult-discs.(12 discs total)As for the discs themselves, they are wonderful, crisp and clear for a fantastic, truly classic TV series and they receive a 5 star rating!.
