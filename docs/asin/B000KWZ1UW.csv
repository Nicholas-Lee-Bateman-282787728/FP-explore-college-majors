Fast Forward left behind the complex, well-written, and nicely animated TMNT series of 2003+.  With Fast Forward, the TMNTs are in a brightly colored, flatly drawn world of trite dialogue spoken by two-dimensional characters.  There is nothing distinctly TMNT about the show anymore.  Splinter and the Turtles could be replaced by any good-guy characters,  with no impact on the series.  It is as if the Turtles, and Splinter, were plunked into a generic storyline, instead of having an original storyline inspired by the characters themselves.  I've been a fan of the TMNT for some time, and I will continue to be a fan of the Turtles.

It's really a shame cause the 2003 series was such a brilliant series with great characters and story continuity. 4Kids really ruined TMNT with this horrible fast forward nonesense. I am all for trying new things, and I don't hate Fast forward for being too campy, after all I am a hardcore fan of the original 1987 series, but this is just painful to watch. I am not going to buy this DVD, I have seen all the episodes and none of them have any redeeming quality. I am saving my money for The Ninja Tribunal Season, which takes place after the forth season. I really hope 4Kids won't ruin the 2003 series for us fans by not releasing The Ninja Tribunal season, in favour of Fast forward.

I'm a fan of the turtles so whether its that great or not I'll buy it just to have it probably lol but yea this is decent enough.Don't expect it to be overly mature or as dark as the previous incarnation. It can be be described as probably a mixture of the first and the 2003 series. They don't look overly childish but at the same time they aren't that as dark as you'd maybe expect.I'm almost through the two discs and maybe its because I've only recently starting watching again, I dunno, but I've pretty much enjoyed it.

1035895,A3LK1D2X0SALC4,B000KWZ1UW,Entertainment Enthusiast,"[0, 0]","This is season 6... not many fans welcomed this season. preferable the older fans or long time fans like me. But to little kids this must be gold. heres some backstory about this season and why they made it:Season 4 was dark and gloomy,featuring monsters and mutants and depressing stories of their treatment. Episodes like dragons brew and i monster made 4kids wonder if maybe the mood needed a little lightening. then a big mix-up happened. Appearantley a new employee for the broadcasting network caused a mishap and a TMNT episode was created that didnt follow the network standards. the notorious banned episode ""Insane in the membrane"", Its not secret because it was included in the season 4 DVD and streamed at 4kids website. Insane in the membrane is something from a touching horror film full of gore and despressing moments. Think dragons brew but with 10x more sadness and 10x more gore. Although the episode was never aired, word still got out that 4kids let this happen. So they quickly finished season 4 with the episode entitled ""ninja tribunal"", which was a cliff hanger. That episode shouldnt have been the season finale. Good genes part 2 makes more sense because it explains how the mystics broke free. You would expect the new season to be about this strange organization and the tengu shredder. nope. Heres what happened: the turtles get captured by a strange organization and are going on a ship to japan. Next week: The turtles are recovering from dons mutation then they get sent to the future. I think ""ninja tribunal"" should have been aired after fast forward. the season was but not the cliffhanger that explains the season. After the season 4 dark and gloom, playmates suggested that 4kids change the direction to something light and corny to boost toy sales. Thus fast forward was made... to bad as soon as playmates got their wish TMNT cgi came out and fast forward only got 1 toy line. Epic fail!Story: the turtles are sent to the future by accident. they meet so many boring secondary characters and villians you wont remember them. the only real villians who gets more than 10 episodes screen time is shokanabo and viral.Vaule: good price for 1 half of the season.overall: decent but volume 2 ""day of awakening"" has an actual arc in it.",4,Its Marketing time!,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,2269,"['season', '6', 'not', 'many', 'fans', 'welcomed', 'season', 'preferable', 'older', 'fans', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'little', 'kids', 'must', 'be', 'gold', 'backstory', 'season', 'why', 'made', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'featuring', 'monsters', 'mutants', 'depressing', 'stories', 'treatment', 'Episodes', 'dragons', 'brew', 'i', 'monster', 'made', '4kids', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'mood', 'needed', 'little', 'lightening', 'then', 'big', 'mix-up', 'happened', 'Appearantley', 'new', 'employee', 'broadcasting', 'network', 'caused', 'mishap', 'TMNT', 'episode', 'was', 'created', 'didnt', 'follow', 'network', 'standards', 'notorious', 'banned', 'episode', 'Insane', 'membrane', 'not', 'secret', 'was', 'included', 'season', '4', 'DVD', 'streamed', '4kids', 'website', 'Insane', 'membrane', 'something', 'touching', 'horror', 'film', 'full', 'gore', 'despressing', 'moments', 'Think', 'dragons', 'brew', '10x', 'more', 'sadness', '10x', 'more', 'gore', 'episode', 'was', 'never', 'aired', 'word', 'still', 'got', '4kids', 'let', 'happen', 'quickly', 'finished', 'season', '4', 'episode', 'entitled', 'ninja', 'tribunal', 'was', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'episode', 'shouldnt', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'finale', 'Good', 'genes', 'part', '2', 'more', 'sense', 'how', 'mystics', 'broke', 'free', 'would', 'expect', 'new', 'season', 'be', 'strange', 'organization', 'tengu', 'shredder', 'nope', 'what', 'happened', 'turtles', 'get', 'captured', 'strange', 'organization', 'are', 'going', 'ship', 'japan', 'Next', 'week', 'turtles', 'are', 'recovering', 'dons', 'mutation', 'then', 'get', 'sent', 'future', 'think', 'ninja', 'tribunal', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'aired', 'fast', 'forward', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'season', '4', 'dark', 'gloom', 'playmates', 'suggested', '4kids', 'change', 'direction', 'something', 'light', 'corny', 'boost', 'toy', 'sales', 'Thus', 'fast', 'forward', 'was', 'made', 'bad', 'as', 'soon', 'playmates', 'got', 'wish', 'TMNT', 'cgi', 'came', 'out', 'fast', 'forward', 'only', 'got', '1', 'toy', 'line', 'Epic', 'fail', 'Story', 'turtles', 'are', 'sent', 'future', 'accident', 'meet', 'so', 'many', 'boring', 'secondary', 'characters', 'villians', 'wont', 'remember', 'only', 'real', 'villians', 'who', 'more', '10', 'episodes', 'screen', 'time', 'shokanabo', 'viral.Vaule', 'good', 'price', '1', 'half', 'season.overall', 'decent', 'volume', '2', 'day', 'awakening', 'actual', 'arc']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward - Future Shellshock! v.1

While the time traveling has been done in the third live action movie but with this it's different scenario.

How can they prepare for a city that's 100 years into the future?  Some of the things that made the first 5 seasons good, are kind of still here while at the same time the writing seems to be different for this season of this show, dealing with new enemies.One in particular is Sh'Okanabo, who is an alien who is apparently trying to get control of NYC and the other being Cody's uncle, who doesn't seem to want Cody to have any word in the family business.

1035900,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000KWZ1UW,Simon,"[14, 17]","TMNT: Fast Forward takes the Turtles from the revamped 2003 series and tosses them 100 years into the future. There they team up with Cody Jones, great grandson of April and Casey, and must learn to live in a world now teeming with alien life.This show reeks of corporate interference all over. The original 2003 series, despite its obvious problems, took itself seriously and featured an ongoing storyline that gave the characters something to do. It was also reasonably well animated, especially in the later seasons when the show amped up its fight choreography and featured varying colour palettes.All this seems to be gone with Fast Forward. The action has been toned down to generic brawls, the animation is flat and the colours are garish and bright. The writers seem to be building some kind of ongoing story, one featuring Cody's corrupt uncle and another featuring an alien threat; it's vaguely interesting, just nowhere near as fun as the old Shredder, Bishop, Hun, Karai stories. In-between there are lots of pointless filler adventures and Cody Jones is shoved down the viewers' throats every episode. As the obligatory kid character he could be worse, but he's not a character you'll miss. And ""It's Ninja Time!"" is just stupid and grating.Really, the show isn't quite Ninja Turtles anymore, you could replace our heroes with anyone and the dynamics wouldn't change. It's still amusing every so often, and over the course of these 13 episodes the show does seem to find its comfort zone.
