As with the first one, Urla calmly explains what to do, and stresses that it's OK to go at your own pace. I have done a lot of Pilates, but not so much yoga, so this is a really nice blend of both. Downward dog and some of the inverted postures are hard for me to do, but each section (there are 3 of them) gets you warmed up and ready to take them on. You will definitely feel stretched and worked out mentally and physically after doing Yogilates!",5,Excellent pacing and instruction,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,536,"['got', 'beginners', 'Yogilates', 'really', 'liked', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'one', 'too', 'first', 'one', 'Urla', 'calmly', 'what', 'do', 'OK', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'Pilates', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'yoga', 'really', 'nice', 'blend', 'Downward', 'dog', 'inverted', 'postures', 'are', 'hard', 'do', 'section', 'are', '3', 'warmed', 'up', 'ready', 'take', 'will', 'definitely', 'feel', 'stretched', 'worked', 'out', 'mentally', 'physically', 'doing', 'Yogilates']",N/A
828424,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00029NLXW,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[41, 41]","Yogilates is a blend of yoga and Pilates, and in Workout 2, instructor Jonathon Urla leads an intermediate-level class. The practice is broken into three sections, thus allowing you to customize your workout. The first 12-minute segment focuses mainly on stretches from a seated position to warm up the body. In the second segment, you'll start immediate with a shoulderstand/plow series and then move right into the Pilates rollover, which was a nice flow. You'll continue with additional Pilates-inspired abs work and then do some additional core work from an all-fours position; this entire segment lasted about 17 minutes. The third segment was the longest at 29 minutes. After some opening stretches, you'll move into a sun salutation series from yoga, gradually adding in additional poses such as lunges and the warrior series. The total time for the workout is 54 minutes.Overall, I really enjoyed this hybrid practice, although I found it to be more yoga-focused than Pilates (I would have liked a bit more Pilates matwork). Jonathon Urla cues well and offers very good form pointers throughout the workout; he has a very encouraging, calming, and relaxing manner. This practice is probably most appropriate for those with some prior exposure to both yoga and Pilates who are interested in combining the two disciplines in an excellent, seamless flow.",5,"An excellent, flowing blend of intermediate yoga and Pilates",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1359,"['Yogilates', 'blend', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'Workout', '2', 'instructor', 'Jonathon', 'Urla', 'intermediate-level', 'class', 'practice', 'broken', 'three', 'sections', 'thus', 'allowing', 'customize', 'workout', 'first', '12-minute', 'segment', 'mainly', 'stretches', 'seated', 'position', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'second', 'segment', ""'ll"", 'start', 'immediate', 'shoulderstand/plow', 'series', 'then', 'move', 'right', 'Pilates', 'rollover', 'was', 'nice', 'flow', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'additional', 'Pilates-inspired', 'abs', 'work', 'then', 'do', 'additional', 'core', 'work', 'all-fours', 'position', 'entire', 'segment', 'lasted', '17', 'minutes', 'third', 'segment', 'was', 'longest', '29', 'minutes', 'opening', 'stretches', ""'ll"", 'move', 'sun', 'salutation', 'series', 'yoga', 'gradually', 'adding', 'additional', 'poses', 'such', 'lunges', 'warrior', 'series', 'total', 'time', 'workout', '54', 'minutes.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'hybrid', 'practice', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'yoga-focused', 'Pilates', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'Jonathon', 'Urla', 'cues', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'form', 'pointers', 'workout', 'very', 'encouraging', 'calming', 'relaxing', 'manner', 'practice', 'probably', 'most', 'appropriate', 'prior', 'exposure', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'combining', 'two', 'disciplines', 'excellent', 'seamless', 'flow']",N/A

Here he takes it up a notch, again seamlessly merging yoga and Pilates exercises into a graceful, flowing, and challenging workout.  The calm voice and excellent instruction are back, as is the trippy and mystical music.This workout does move a bit faster and is a bit more challenging than the beginner workout, though, so please try that one first if you have no experience with yoga or Pilates.  Nonetheless, most of the exercises were pretty accessible to me, someone with some experience in yoga and minimal in Pilates.  I'll need a few more times through to really start to feel comfortable with the workout, though, and some of the poses were a little beyond me.But that is what practice is all about, is it not?If you want a workout to challenge your core muscles as well as your mind and soul -- if you want a workout that leaves you feeling energized and centered and bendy and strong -- check out this DVD!

Great lighting, good sound, good music, not too fast, not too boring. Jonathan leads speaking/teaching in real time. He will perform all the exercises himself & then help others as they stay in it. He cues YOUR left & right, not his/students. He gives great instruction, has a soothing voice, but not to soothing. This almost felt to me like a rigorous stretching workout rather then anything else. The warm up was the entire first section & at first I thought it would be too easy. After the warm up & stretching, there is modified & full pilates, stretching of the legs, butterfly stretch, torso stretching, bridge bridge w/1 leg up,  etc. Last he gets more advanced with modified & full side plank, standing  He saves the sun salutations, warrior poses, triangle, side angle, chair, camel, standing wide legged fwd bends, for almost last. Though many of the postures were modified, some were not.
