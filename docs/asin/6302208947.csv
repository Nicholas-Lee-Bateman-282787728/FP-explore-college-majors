301451,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302208947,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various crime noir efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass. Some, such as the film under review from 1946, Undercurrent, frankly baffles me. A pyscho-drama, no question, a famous director, no question, but also a very non-femme fatale in Kate Hepburn, and a very non-tough guy (street or detective) role for classic 1940s tough guy and a good guy to have at your back, Robert Mitchum.A little plot look will help explain my bafflement. Robert Taylor, a ruthless, driven high-tech capitalist who made big dough during World War II is also a little mad, well, a lot mad. However he is able to cover that little problem up while courting, well not beautiful, but let's call her handsome, Kate Hepburn. Seems he needs a trophy wife and Kate fills the bill. And that is where the problems begin because Brother Taylor has a brother whom he is insanely jealous of for the usual Freudian, or pseudo-Freudian, reasons that drive the plot lines of these pycho-dramas. Kate, however, loves the big lug Taylor until he starts going over the edge about his brother (and some other things like a little murder of an employee that goes a long way to allowing him to be that ruthless high-tech capitalist). Of course, as in all such dramas old Robert will get his comeuppance, have no fear.But where is the noir in this noir? No femme fatale, no tough guy throwing his weight around or tilting at windmills to right the world's wrongs, no problem that requires quick thinking to right those wrongs. Well when you go on a tear on a subject as I am on &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> not everything will come up Out Of The Past or The Big Sleep.

301452,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302208947,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Take a few dark and stormy nights, fog coming in from the coast, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night silently grinding out a glowing cigarette butt, and, finally, a tremulous heroine who finds herself threatened as much by her own doubts as by one -- but which one? -- of the men around her. Sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir. Instead, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and with two A-list leads, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes a nearly two-hour matinee melodrama, a long slog of threatening angst amidst the perfectly groomed, coifed and dressed cast. When you glance at your watch half-way through a movie and with a sinking heart see that you have another hour to go, both you and the movie probably have problems.Minnelli, in one of his earliest non-musical movies, doesn't lay on the rococo hothouse approach as heavily as he later was known to do. Still, what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession is turned into an endless Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Hepburn shows us in carefully lit close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, giddiness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less along for the ride.Hepburn starts the movie as the tomboyish Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to get her married. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it's love at first sight. Garroway is the smooth, handsome, dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, which was vital in the war, and which has turned him into a hard-charging millionaire manufacturer. He's a captain of industry, as one of his many Washington friends says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a bit of the tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those Congressmen and judges her husband knows. She learns fast and eagerly. They both are obviously and blissfully in love.But wait. The canker is about to gnaw. Ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk about them to her. When she learns bit by bit that Alan's mother died in the old family home in Middleburg while seated at the piano, or that he has a brother, Michael, who has disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet...and sometimes goes into a rage. He always apologizes. But wait once more. Did his mother really play the piano? Didn't she really die in bed? Wasn't Michael caught taking money from the family firm and Alan sent him away? All this plays out against the exquisite hotel suites, the manicured country home in Middleburg with the horse stable and the tasteful ranch house by the sea. Everyone in the movie except employees are dressed to the nines. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black-and-white movie, Minnelli can't help but give us dining tables filled with crystal and china, tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of gowns.By the end of the movie, when all is finally known, when Ann on horseback is chased along a high, extremely well-designed mountain trail by the bad guy on another horse, when she is threatened with death by boulder and her pursuer finally meets death by horse, it's a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to bring much tension to the movie. What might have been in lesser hands a taut little B-movie, instead with the A list is just an overwrought melodrama, too big for its bones.Undercurrent is part of the DVD package, The Katharine Hepburn Collection. It can also be tracked down separately on VHS. It's worth watching once as a lesson in how a small, good idea can be ruined by too much of just about everything.",2,"There was a taut B-movie noir struggling to get out, but it died trying because of overwrought directing and acting",1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3927,"['Take', 'few', 'dark', 'stormy', 'nights', 'fog', 'coming', 'coast', 'obsession', 'doubt', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'mysterious', 'connection', 'based', 'hatred', 'suspicious', 'disappearance', 'shoe', 'night', 'silently', 'grinding', 'out', 'glowing', 'cigarette', 'butt', 'finally', 'tremulous', 'heroine', 'who', 'threatened', 'as', 'much', 'own', 'doubts', 'one', 'one', 'men', 'might', 'have', 'good', '80', 'minute', 'noir', 'Instead', 'direction', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'two', 'A-list', 'leads', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Undercurrent', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'matinee', 'melodrama', 'long', 'slog', 'threatening', 'angst', 'perfectly', 'groomed', 'coifed', 'dressed', 'cast', 'When', 'glance', 'watch', 'half-way', 'movie', 'sinking', 'heart', 'see', 'have', 'hour', 'go', 'movie', 'probably', 'have', 'problems.Minnelli', 'one', 'earliest', 'non-musical', 'movies', ""n't"", 'lay', 'rococo', 'hothouse', 'approach', 'as', 'heavily', 'later', 'was', 'known', 'do', 'Still', 'what', 'basically', 'simple', 'story', 'greed', 'murder', 'obsession', 'turned', 'endless', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'vehicle', 'Hepburn', 'carefully', 'lit', 'close-ups', 'how', 'demonstrate', 'fear', 'love', 'anxiety', 'giddiness', 'happiness', 'doubt', 'suspicion', 'terror', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'more', 'less', 'ride.Hepburn', 'movie', 'tomboyish', 'Ann', 'Hamilton', 'energetic', 'young', 'woman', 'slacks', 'who', 'father', 'inventions', 'housekeeper', 'determined', 'get', 'married', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Hamilton', 'sell', 'important', 'formula', 'Alan', 'Garroway', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Garroway', 'smooth', 'handsome', 'dynamic', 'inventor', 'Garroway', 'Distance', 'Controller', 'was', 'vital', 'war', 'turned', 'hard-charging', 'millionaire', 'manufacturer', 'captain', 'industry', 'one', 'many', 'Washington', 'friends', 'Ann', 'Hamilton', 'now', 'Ann', 'Garroway', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'bit', 'tomboy', 'husband', 'how', 'dress', 'how', 'be', 'successful', 'social', 'hostess', 'Congressmen', 'judges', 'husband', 'knows', 'fast', 'eagerly', 'are', 'obviously', 'blissfully', 'love.But', 'wait', 'canker', 'gnaw', 'Ann', 'nothing', 'husband', 'family', 'None', 'employees', 'friends', 'seem', 'inclined', 'talk', 'When', 'bit', 'bit', 'Alan', 'mother', 'died', 'old', 'family', 'home', 'Middleburg', 'seated', 'piano', 'brother', 'Michael', 'who', 'disappeared', 'Alan', 'very', 'quiet', 'sometimes', 'rage', 'always', 'wait', 'once', 'more', 'Did', 'mother', 'really', 'play', 'piano', 'Did', ""n't"", 'really', 'die', 'bed', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'caught', 'taking', 'money', 'family', 'firm', 'Alan', 'sent', 'away', 'out', 'exquisite', 'hotel', 'suites', 'manicured', 'country', 'home', 'Middleburg', 'horse', 'stable', 'tasteful', 'ranch', 'house', 'sea', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'employees', 'are', 'dressed', 'nines', 'are', 'exclusive', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'intimate', 'dinners', 'twenty', 'Even', 'black-and-white', 'movie', 'Minnelli', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'dining', 'tables', 'filled', 'crystal', 'china', 'tasteful', 'elegant', 'furniture', 'lots', 'gowns.By', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'finally', 'known', 'when', 'Ann', 'horseback', 'chased', 'high', 'extremely', 'well-designed', 'mountain', 'trail', 'bad', 'guy', 'horse', 'when', 'threatened', 'death', 'boulder', 'pursuer', 'finally', 'death', 'horse', 'relief', 'Even', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'Michael', 'unable', 'bring', 'much', 'tension', 'movie', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lesser', 'hands', 'taut', 'little', 'B-movie', 'instead', 'A', 'list', 'just', 'overwrought', 'melodrama', 'too', 'big', 'bones.Undercurrent', 'part', 'DVD', 'package', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Collection', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'separately', 'VHS', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'lesson', 'how', 'small', 'good', 'idea', 'can', 'be', 'ruined', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'everything']",N/A
301453,A23UB49EG29MVT,6302208947,Commenter77,"[0, 0]","It's always interesting to see an unusual combining of players in atypical roles and venues.  For me, that's part of the draw of this picture.  Very enjoyable Kate - not hyper, not emotively morose - just down to it.  Decent Robert Taylor here, my consideration of his acting ability being what he said about himself and Barbara Stanwyck, to whom he was then married.  He said that Barbara was an actress; he was just a movie star. Thought it would be quite interesting to check out this admitted mere movie star with an even stronger talent than Stanwyck (my opinion).For those concerned with Hepburn being miscast, have you never heard of the wail of an actor or actress about being typecast?  They want to try something different, a challenge, not be locked into the same thing.  Whether she was happy with the result or not, by this time she had a say in her parts.  As for comparisons, she retains her style with a much steadier hold on herself in her perplexing and sinister dilemma from Fontaine's quivering lamb caught in the brambles.Did feel frustrated by a plot element, which comes up in films -  an improbable that you find difficult to ignore.  In this case, it is that a settled and stable girl like Ann would marry a virtual stranger after only a few weeks' acquaintance, and that her father would be gung-ho about it all.  It is a bit of a stretch.  The father only knew Alan by professional reputation and nothing at all about him as a person.  Ann and her father are of solid stock who live by deliberation and preparation.  For such a girl, regardless of her dissatisfaction with her status quo, to rush into alliance with a near stranger, break with her roots and go off alone with him is unrealistic and frustrating. The angst only grows as the folly of having done so is played out.  She's not a naive ing&eacute;nue who ""falls madly in love"" and rashly runs off on such slim acquaintance.  But, that's the movies sometimes.Some are concerned that Robert Mitchum ""has little to do,"" that catch phrase used when someone has a smaller part than one would prefer or think appropriate for them.  It helps to know where Mitchum was in his career in 1946, the year this film was released.  This picture, along with others done this same year, represent his breakout from routine B pictures with small, obscure roles and billing.  He's not the veteran actor at this point with many starring roles behind him.  As for his playing ""against type"" in this film,  since this is his first major motion picture, he has yet to be established in a type.  Rather than ""having little to do"" or being wasted in the role, it's a needed break for him, working with top actors for the first time.  Again, this role is part of his launch pad into bigger and better things.All in all, this is one that holds interest as it goes, fulfilling suspense and outcome.  Like a lot of films, it's an experiment that brought mixed results.  Depending on your focus and entertainment bent, it's flaws and faults are forgivable, unforgivable or overborne by other elements.  For me, the novelty of the interplaying of Taylor and Hepburn, along with the variation of the Hepburn role, make this one a keeper for periodic viewing.",4,Unique Pairings and Roles,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3216,"['always', 'interesting', 'see', 'unusual', 'combining', 'players', 'atypical', 'roles', 'venues', 'part', 'draw', 'picture', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'Kate', 'not', 'hyper', 'not', 'emotively', 'morose', 'just', 'Decent', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'here', 'consideration', 'acting', 'ability', 'being', 'what', 'said', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'whom', 'was', 'then', 'married', 'said', 'Barbara', 'was', 'actress', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'star', 'Thought', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'check', 'out', 'admitted', 'mere', 'movie', 'star', 'even', 'stronger', 'talent', 'Stanwyck', 'opinion', '.For', 'concerned', 'Hepburn', 'being', 'miscast', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'wail', 'actor', 'actress', 'being', 'typecast', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'challenge', 'not', 'be', 'locked', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'happy', 'result', 'not', 'time', 'had', 'say', 'parts', 'comparisons', 'style', 'much', 'steadier', 'hold', 'perplexing', 'sinister', 'dilemma', 'Fontaine', 'quivering', 'lamb', 'caught', 'brambles.Did', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'plot', 'element', 'up', 'films', 'improbable', 'find', 'difficult', 'ignore', 'case', 'settled', 'stable', 'girl', 'Ann', 'would', 'marry', 'virtual', 'stranger', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'acquaintance', 'father', 'would', 'be', 'gung-ho', 'bit', 'stretch', 'father', 'only', 'knew', 'Alan', 'professional', 'reputation', 'nothing', 'about', 'person', 'Ann', 'father', 'are', 'solid', 'stock', 'who', 'live', 'deliberation', 'preparation', 'such', 'girl', 'regardless', 'dissatisfaction', 'status', 'quo', 'rush', 'alliance', 'near', 'stranger', 'break', 'roots', 'go', 'off', 'alone', 'unrealistic', 'frustrating', 'angst', 'only', 'folly', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'played', 'out', 'not', 'naive', 'ing', 'eacute', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'rashly', 'runs', 'off', 'such', 'slim', 'acquaintance', 'movies', 'sometimes.Some', 'are', 'concerned', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'little', 'do', 'catch', 'phrase', 'used', 'when', 'someone', 'smaller', 'part', 'one', 'would', 'prefer', 'think', 'appropriate', 'know', 'where', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'career', '1946', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'picture', 'others', 'done', 'same', 'year', 'represent', 'breakout', 'routine', 'B', 'pictures', 'small', 'obscure', 'roles', 'billing', 'not', 'veteran', 'actor', 'point', 'many', 'starring', 'roles', 'playing', 'type', 'film', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'yet', 'be', 'established', 'type', 'Rather', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'being', 'wasted', 'role', 'needed', 'break', 'working', 'top', 'actors', 'first', 'time', 'Again', 'role', 'part', 'launch', 'pad', 'bigger', 'better', 'things.All', 'one', 'interest', 'fulfilling', 'suspense', 'outcome', 'lot', 'films', 'experiment', 'brought', 'mixed', 'results', 'Depending', 'focus', 'entertainment', 'bent', 'flaws', 'faults', 'are', 'forgivable', 'unforgivable', 'overborne', 'other', 'elements', 'novelty', 'interplaying', 'Taylor', 'Hepburn', 'variation', 'Hepburn', 'role', 'make', 'one', 'keeper', 'periodic', 'viewing']",N/A

I am a big Mitchum fan, but big Bob was wasted in this snorefest. Usually, I think Hepburn is pretty great, but I found her tiresome in this role. Playing against type, Robert Taylor was outstanding in his portrayal of the slick entrepreneur slowly coming unglued to reveal a psychopathic core. I'm no Bob Taylor fan but he was the only thing worth watching (that and a traumatized stable hand who rattles off the goods about Taylor's horse-abusing past). Mitchum plays this with even more than his usual laconic stoicism--he probably knew what an egg this one was going to lay. The film takes WAY TOO LONG to get to an all-too-obvious confrontation, and becomes very tedious indeed. There are plenty of Freudian overtones here--a daughter overly-attached to her father, two brothers vying to be mommy's favorite, and a kinky kinda-incestuous fantasy (later real) relationship between a wife and her phantasmic brother-in-law. However, it all turns to pablum in Minnelli's hands (sorry Liza). Another Amazon reviewer likens this film to Gaslight--wow, check yourself, bro!! A lot of potential here, but just did not deliver the goods. I was sadly disappointed. Another off-beat Hepburn (and Spencer)that worked much better for me was Sea of Grass--try that one instead, if you can find it.ADDENDUM: 5/10/09:  Can it really be that not one person in 7 has found this review helpful to them?

301456,A106016KSI0YQ,6302208947,Jay Dickson,"[6, 12]","In one of the few times she ever played a genuinely frightened person in her entire life, Katharine Hepburn stars in this silly but very expensive melodrama from MGM. The dowdy daughter of a New England university chemistry professor (who keeps his laboratory, which she also uses, adjoining the family dining room), she is wooed by millionaire manufacturer Robert Taylor, who whisks her off to his Georgetown mansion to introduce her to Washington high society and dress her according to his supposedly exquisite taste in women's clothing. (The outfits, by Irene, are so horribly unflattering on Hepburn they seem almost perversely chosen.) In DC, Hepburn learns never to mention Taylor's absent brother, whose very mention seems to produce fits of twitching and nostril-flaring in her new husband; this meassage becomes hammered home even further when they visit Taylor's childhood home, a plush estate in Virginia horse country. Then there are further steps along the way in San Francisco and the California countryside, with even one scene set in a Seattle board room, and a special guest appearance by Robert Mitchum before we're back to the ominous mansion in Virginia with NO TELEPHONES (as the characters repeatedly remind us) before Taylor really goes off his nut.Why this film had to be so expansive and cover so many states is an even bigger mystery than what happened to Taylor's brother. So too is the reason why MGM chose Katharine Hepburn, of all people, to play the kind of role usually accorded Joan Fontaine: although Hepburn is quite charming in the final scenes where she's required to be terrified, she seems to be playing an entirely different person altogether than in the beginning when she does her usual schtick as a father-adoring Yankee tomboy. The film seems to go on forever because there are so many little loose ends that have to be drawn together at the very end; even so, the film's storyline gives the impression of having been made up as it goes along.

Based on the novel ""You Were There"" by Thelma Strabel, this thriller features a psychologically deviant villain that could have been in the best psychoanalytical tradition of 1940s cinema, if the story had some compelling driver behind it. Ann Hamilton (Katherine Hepburn) is a quirky, forthright woman from a family of chemists. She is swept off her feet by Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), a suave inventor and wealthy business associate of her father. The couple set up house in Washington, DC, where Alan hobnobs with the political and social elite. Out of place at first, Ann adapts admirably to her new lifestyle but soon discovers her husband's obsession. Alan is consumed by hatred for his brother Mike (Robert Mitchum), who disappeared years ago amid some nasty rumors.""Undercurrent"" is a suspense in the wife-in-peril mold. Ann digs into her husband's past, trying to solve the mystery of Alan's present behavior. There's nothing wrong with the plot; it just never takes off. Alan sounds like an interesting character, but he isn't interesting to watch. He may genuinely love Ann, but he's unprincipled and pathologically insecure. It is his insecurity more than his lack of scruple that undermines his life and marriage. It's strange to see Robert Mitchum playing the brother described as ""not handsome"", but his earthy masculinity is right for the part of Mike. Robert Taylor and Katherine Hepburn are well-suited to their roles also. But there isn't enough tension. We never fear for Ann or feel her changing perceptions of Alan on an emotional level. It's not a bad film, but it's rather flat.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2007): This is disc 3 in Warner's Katherine Hepburn Collection. Bonus features are 2 short films. ""Traffic with the Devil"" (20 min) was made in 1946 for the ""Theatre of Life"" ""fact-films from real-life"" series. It's a documentary narrated by a Los Angeles traffic cop, Sgt. Charles Reineke, about America's growing automobile culture and the benefits and perils that go with it, ultimately focusing on traffic fatalities. ""Lonesome Lenny"" (8 min), also from 1946, is a Screwball Squirrel cartoon about  a dopey dog named Lenny whose owner gives him a squirrel for a playmate. But the squirrel has other ideas, and Lenny will have to catch him first. Subtitles for the main feature are available in English and French. The film was also released on VHS (Warner 1998, 2000) but is out of print in that format.",3,"Great Cast, but This Wife-in-Peril Suspense Never Really Takes Off.",1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,2536,"['star-studded', 'cast', 'director', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'Undercurrent', ""n't"", 'lack', 'talent', 'Based', 'novel', 'Were', 'Thelma', 'Strabel', 'thriller', 'psychologically', 'deviant', 'villain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'psychoanalytical', 'tradition', '1940s', 'cinema', 'story', 'had', 'compelling', 'driver', 'Ann', 'Hamilton', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'quirky', 'forthright', 'woman', 'family', 'chemists', 'swept', 'feet', 'Alan', 'Garroway', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'suave', 'inventor', 'wealthy', 'business', 'associate', 'father', 'couple', 'set', 'up', 'house', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'Alan', 'political', 'social', 'elite', 'place', 'first', 'Ann', 'admirably', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'soon', 'discovers', 'husband', 'obsession', 'Alan', 'consumed', 'hatred', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'disappeared', 'years', 'ago', 'nasty', 'rumors', 'Undercurrent', 'suspense', 'wife-in-peril', 'mold', 'Ann', 'husband', 'past', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Alan', 'present', 'behavior', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'plot', 'just', 'never', 'off', 'Alan', 'interesting', 'character', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'watch', 'may', 'genuinely', 'love', 'Ann', 'unprincipled', 'pathologically', 'insecure', 'insecurity', 'more', 'lack', 'scruple', 'life', 'marriage', 'strange', 'see', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'playing', 'brother', 'described', 'not', 'handsome', 'earthy', 'masculinity', 'right', 'part', 'Mike', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'are', 'well-suited', 'roles', 'also', ""n't"", 'enough', 'tension', 'never', 'fear', 'Ann', 'feel', 'changing', 'perceptions', 'Alan', 'emotional', 'level', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'rather', 'flat.The', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '2007', 'disc', '3', 'Warner', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Collection', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', '2', 'short', 'films', 'Traffic', 'Devil', '20', 'min', 'was', 'made', '1946', 'Theatre', 'Life', 'fact-films', 'real-life', 'series', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'traffic', 'cop', 'Sgt', 'Charles', 'Reineke', 'America', 'growing', 'automobile', 'culture', 'benefits', 'perils', 'go', 'ultimately', 'focusing', 'traffic', 'fatalities', 'Lonesome', 'Lenny', '8', 'min', 'also', '1946', 'Screwball', 'Squirrel', 'cartoon', 'dopey', 'dog', 'named', 'Lenny', 'owner', 'squirrel', 'playmate', 'squirrel', 'other', 'ideas', 'Lenny', 'will', 'have', 'catch', 'first', 'Subtitles', 'main', 'feature', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'French', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'VHS', 'Warner', '1998', '2000', 'print', 'format']",N/A

Nonetheless, being on an old film kick, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a suspense movie I had never seen before.Robert Taylor, devastatingly handsome in a slippery sort of way, plays the part of Alan Garraway, a sophisticated businessman/inventor who presents on business to the house of a famous scientist one evening because their talents compliment each other in aerospace advancement.  The older scientist has a daughter; bright and vivacious but hardly the type that might be expected to attract an Alan Garraway:  Ann Hamilton played by Katherine Hepburn.But there is an ""undercurrent"" about him that is hard to dispel, despite his charm and even-tempered personality, which is carefully cultivated and controlled. The rejected suitor of Ann's who has done business with him before doesn't like him (which may be expected to be without cause considering the circumstances) but neither does the dog.  Any dog.  However, Ann is smitten to the toes, and under the smoky, sultry spell of Alan Garraway, she agrees to marry him.From the moment the viewer feels the intensity of his focus on Ann, we are given the sensation somehow that he is choosing her in a calculating way; a plain, unsophisticated person who will be so in love with him that he can remake her into anything he wishes; and who will allow him to retain complete control of her in matters of the heart - she will be ""his.""  That this doesn't quite happen the way he thought it would is what makes the ""undercurrent"" of the story what it is - there's a reason for this.Ann starts finding out right away that things are not what they seem in her new home; her husband's snooty social circle is quite a departure from her simple, hard working one, but she is up to the task and overnight evolves into the beautiful Katherine Hepburn we know is under there.  That is part of where it doesn't quite cut the mustard as far as continuity goes, but let it slide, we know more and better is coming.  She also discovers that he has a mysteriously absent brother whom he obviously doesn't want to talk about and as her scientists inquisitive instinct is aroused by any unsolved mystery, she sets out to find out why; but no one seems to know if he simply abandoned his family or if he was murdered. In the process of investigation, the mystery overwhelms her and she falls in love with a phantom; a someone she does not know, has never seen, but seems more a part of who she is than her new husband is.This is a good movie that could have been a lot better with just a little more aforethought taken in smoothing the script.  Robert Michum, by the way, is very interesting in his role and is the focus of two of the best scenes in the entire movie, in my view.",4,"""Phantom""",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2847,"['had', 'right', 'people', 'right', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'bit', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'quite', 'up', 'potential', 'Nonetheless', 'being', 'old', 'film', 'kick', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'suspense', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before.Robert', 'Taylor', 'devastatingly', 'handsome', 'slippery', 'sort', 'way', 'part', 'Alan', 'Garraway', 'sophisticated', 'businessman/inventor', 'who', 'business', 'house', 'famous', 'scientist', 'one', 'evening', 'talents', 'compliment', 'other', 'aerospace', 'advancement', 'older', 'scientist', 'daughter', 'bright', 'vivacious', 'hardly', 'type', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'attract', 'Alan', 'Garraway', 'Ann', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn.But', 'undercurrent', 'hard', 'dispel', 'charm', 'even-tempered', 'personality', 'carefully', 'cultivated', 'controlled', 'rejected', 'suitor', 'Ann', 'who', 'done', 'business', 'before', ""n't"", 'like', 'may', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'cause', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'dog', 'dog', 'However', 'Ann', 'smitten', 'toes', 'smoky', 'sultry', 'spell', 'Alan', 'Garraway', 'marry', 'moment', 'viewer', 'intensity', 'focus', 'Ann', 'are', 'given', 'sensation', 'somehow', 'choosing', 'calculating', 'way', 'plain', 'unsophisticated', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'love', 'can', 'remake', 'anything', 'who', 'will', 'allow', 'retain', 'complete', 'control', 'matters', 'heart', 'will', 'be', ""n't"", 'quite', 'happen', 'way', 'thought', 'would', 'what', 'undercurrent', 'story', 'what', 'reason', 'this.Ann', 'starts', 'finding', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'new', 'home', 'husband', 'snooty', 'social', 'circle', 'quite', 'departure', 'simple', 'hard', 'working', 'one', 'up', 'task', 'overnight', 'evolves', 'beautiful', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'know', 'there', 'part', 'where', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', 'mustard', 'as', 'far', 'continuity', 'let', 'slide', 'know', 'more', 'better', 'coming', 'also', 'mysteriously', 'absent', 'brother', 'whom', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'about', 'scientists', 'inquisitive', 'instinct', 'aroused', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'one', 'know', 'simply', 'abandoned', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'process', 'investigation', 'mystery', 'love', 'phantom', 'someone', 'not', 'know', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'part', 'who', 'new', 'husband', 'is.This', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'aforethought', 'taken', 'smoothing', 'script', 'Robert', 'Michum', 'way', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'focus', 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'entire', 'movie', 'view']",N/A
