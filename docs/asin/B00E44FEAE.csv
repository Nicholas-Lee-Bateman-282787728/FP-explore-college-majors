1664471,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00E44FEAE,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 6]","Following his return from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, Chris is having problems adapting to life in San Diego.  After several job offers fell through, Chris reluctantly agrees to a proposition from a young woman, whose brother died in Chris&#8217; unit overseas.  She hires Chris to seduce and kill Andrew, her brother&#8217;s lover, in order to receive a valuable inheritance that would otherwise go to him.This film is directed by Sean Paul Lockhart, aka gay porn&#8217;s Brett Corrigan, who also plays Andrew.  Judging by Lockhart&#8217;s long-winded introduction that preceded the film on the DVD, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much, but it was somewhat better than my reduced expectations.  The plot is far-fetched and far from cohesive, some scenes are stretched out way too long, and the acting by the secondary characters is cartoonish.  Still, the story does provide some suspense, and the final reveal is something I was not expecting, so I&#8217;ll give them three stars out of five for effort and eye-candy.  Unrated, but would be a solid R for male nudity and simulated sexual situations.  DVD bonuses include outtakes, a music video and a &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; feature.",3,"Generally mediocre effort has some pluses, holds suspense.",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1190,"['Following', 'return', 'tour', 'duty', 'Afghanistan', 'Chris', 'having', 'problems', 'adapting', 'life', 'San', 'Diego', 'several', 'job', 'offers', 'fell', 'Chris', 'reluctantly', 'proposition', 'young', 'woman', 'brother', 'died', 'Chris', '8217', 'unit', 'overseas', 'Chris', 'seduce', 'kill', 'Andrew', 'brother', '8217', 'lover', 'order', 'receive', 'valuable', 'inheritance', 'would', 'otherwise', 'go', 'him.This', 'film', 'directed', 'Sean', 'Paul', 'Lockhart', 'aka', 'gay', 'porn', '8217', 'Brett', 'Corrigan', 'who', 'also', 'Andrew', 'Judging', 'Lockhart', '8217', 'long-winded', 'introduction', 'preceded', 'film', 'DVD', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'reduced', 'expectations', 'plot', 'far-fetched', 'far', 'cohesive', 'scenes', 'are', 'stretched', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'acting', 'secondary', 'characters', 'cartoonish', 'Still', 'story', 'provide', 'suspense', 'final', 'reveal', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', '8217', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'five', 'effort', 'eye-candy', 'Unrated', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'R', 'male', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'situations', 'DVD', 'include', 'outtakes', 'music', 'video', '8220', 'scenes', '8221', 'feature']",Triple Crossed

1664473,A16TTO0XISBJF0,B00E44FEAE,Budas Root,"[5, 6]","U.S. gay cinema is enjoying a growth spurt.  Suddenly we have some new sexy adult dramas that are about American gay men.  Nothing wrong with watching British gays, Scandinavian gays, German gays, Latin American gays, and all the other internationalities that kept gay cinema going, but it's nice to be able to watch American gays for a change!  This is a unique film, a twisty modern noir that is also a compelling romance and also has touches of real humor; and it's very sexy.  Sean Paul Lockhart is almost like Marilyn at times in this, as the lead he has a really endearing star quality.  This is the first film I have ever seen where a total gay bottom is upheld as the &#34;good woman&#34; (in heterosexual terms) in a story in which he gets betrayed by one loser (&#34;looks like Tarzan but sounds like Jane,&#34; as they say in Araki's Mysterious Skin) only to be saved by a hunky Marine whose love is tattoo-true.

1664478,AG7RTXB2YXWTL,B00E44FEAE,Linda Davis,"[4, 5]","First you need to understand that I have a great respect for Sean Paul Lockhart. Controversial though he may be, he is an example of a young man who has a plan and is following it. He not only convinced a skeptical adult film industry that he was old enough to do it (when he wasn't of legal age), he then became a successful participant. Something those much older never achieved. Always moving forward, he moved into Gay film and is successful in that arena. Taking the next step, &#34;Triple Crossed&#34; is his debut as a director, while holding a major role in the film. Sean Lockhart is a genuinely nice young man, and aside from his entry into the adult world, has proven that he is honest. I wish Mr. Lockhart all the best in his future. The movie &#34;Triple Crossed&#34; is well written, an uncomplicated story line, but have to admit  I didn't see it coming. Well worth viewing, holds your interest, you actually like the characters. Jack Brockett made his acting debut, and has great appeal. I own this film and recommend it.

It reminded me of when you have to write a term paper and have a good idea, and plan to bring it all together at the end, and tie up all the loose ends nicely.Then, you get tired of doing it, time is running out, and so you take all your ideas to make your point at the end, and jumble them all together in an incomprehensible mess that make no sense whatsoever.To say that the acting by some of the actors in the film seemed ""wooden"" is an understatement. It was like they were reading their cue cards on the side and not quite comprehending just what scene they were in and what it was about.I was tired of this thing about one third of the way through it. I wonder if anybody out there is in contact with Sean Lockart? If you are, please ask him if he would refund the money I spent on his movie. If this were an undergrad paper, it would get a D.

1664484,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00E44FEAE,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[15, 18]","I am a big fan of indie cinema and they are often timely reminders to the big studios as to just how good and innovative films can be. This is not one of those films - sadly. It starts with the star and director, Sean Paul Lockhart (Andrew), doing a piece to camera explaining why he made such a great film and how they all put `blood sweat and tears' into the production. Actually judging from some of the scenes there were probably a few other bodily fluids thrown into the mix too.We then have a veteran of Afghanistan, Jack Brocket playing Chris, he has returned with PTSD and just wants a job, but instead winds up getting hired as a hit man. This is to kill another vet who has inherited a fortune from his now dead gay, soldier lover and whose half sister will then get the lot if Andrew goes to the big gay disco in the sky. So begins his courtship of Andrew.This is gay and so as such there are what can only be called `gratuitous shower scenes', some bedroom action and some nudity. I think it might have been me but the plot is so ludicrous that I stopped caring. Scooby Doo has better thought out plots and the acting lacked more conviction than a hedge fund manager trying to explain why he deserves a bonus. The sound levels vary in places and the CGI action is poor. The two leads are good looking but there needs to be more than good looking guys who are allergic to wearing their shirts to make a film more than just a pre watershed porno. So sorry good effort but no cigar and all that - it is not disastrous hence my rating but there are too many issues to make this anything approaching `good'.",3,"Indie, Afghan, Gay,  Thriller Farce",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1614,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'indie', 'cinema', 'are', 'often', 'timely', 'reminders', 'big', 'studios', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'innovative', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'sadly', 'star', 'director', 'Sean', 'Paul', 'Lockhart', 'Andrew', 'doing', 'piece', 'camera', 'explaining', 'why', 'made', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'how', 'put', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'production', 'Actually', 'judging', 'scenes', 'were', 'probably', 'few', 'other', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'thrown', 'mix', 'too.We', 'then', 'have', 'veteran', 'Afghanistan', 'Jack', 'Brocket', 'playing', 'Chris', 'returned', 'PTSD', 'just', 'job', 'instead', 'up', 'getting', 'hired', 'hit', 'man', 'kill', 'vet', 'who', 'inherited', 'fortune', 'now', 'dead', 'gay', 'soldier', 'lover', 'half', 'sister', 'will', 'then', 'get', 'lot', 'Andrew', 'big', 'gay', 'disco', 'sky', 'courtship', 'Andrew.This', 'gay', 'so', 'such', 'are', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'gratuitous', 'shower', 'scenes', 'bedroom', 'action', 'nudity', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'plot', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'stopped', 'caring', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'better', 'thought', 'out', 'plots', 'acting', 'lacked', 'more', 'conviction', 'hedge', 'fund', 'manager', 'trying', 'explain', 'why', 'bonus', 'sound', 'levels', 'vary', 'places', 'CGI', 'action', 'poor', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'allergic', 'wearing', 'shirts', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'pre', 'watershed', 'porno', 'So', 'sorry', 'good', 'effort', 'cigar', 'not', 'disastrous', 'hence', 'rating', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'issues', 'make', 'anything', 'approaching', 'good']",Triple Crossed
