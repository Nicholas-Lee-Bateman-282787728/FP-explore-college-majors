Although the credits list as: Holly Sampson, Shauna O'Brien..Shauna does not have any scenes in this. Her character is in a wheelchair communicating the story through email, and has a total of about 15 seconds screen time..Im not quite sure what thats' all about. The only erotica scenes feature the usual boring Holly Sampson and plastic women who could'nt follow in Shauna's footsteps if they [wanted to]. Even though I would never be one to say anything bad about any of Shauna O'Brien's movies...this is kinda misleading to her fans. Trust me, skip this and stick to her older, more thankful movies like 'Scandal-The Big Turn On' and 'Platinum Blonde'...until hopefully she comes back and makes something new for us.",2,"Shauna O'Brien Fans, These are Not for You...",1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,818,"['bought', 'two', 'movies', 'Cinemax', 'Originals', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'last', 'year', 'credits', 'list', 'Holly', 'Sampson', 'Shauna', ""O'Brien..Shauna"", 'not', 'have', 'scenes', 'character', 'wheelchair', 'communicating', 'story', 'email', 'total', '15', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time..Im', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'only', 'erotica', 'scenes', 'feature', 'usual', 'boring', 'Holly', 'Sampson', 'plastic', 'women', 'who', ""could'nt"", 'follow', 'Shauna', 'footsteps', '[', 'wanted', ']', 'Even', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'one', 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Shauna', ""O'Brien"", 'movies', 'kinda', 'misleading', 'fans', 'Trust', 'skip', 'stick', 'older', 'more', 'thankful', 'movies', ""'Scandal-The"", 'Big', 'Turn', 'Blonde', 'hopefully', 'back', 'something', 'new']",N/A

695437,A179GX8E3M4G52,B000063K0S,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[11, 12]","As Emmanuelle flicks go, Emmanuelle's Intimate Encounters wasn't too bad. Yes the story was cheesy but in a fun way. The movie is sort of a tongue in cheek science fiction sexual romp that doesn't take itself too seriously.Emmanuelle, played in this film by actress de jour, Holly Sampson, is the unwitting player in a married couple's perversion. The wife is a paraplegic, having previously been involved in an auto accident but she is apparently a scientist as well and has found a way to experience unbridled sex with her husband, vicariously while her husband shags a surrogate sexual partner. In this case Emmanuelle, a slender sylph of a woman.I must admit that, in all my single years I have never met a woman that was quite as eager as Emmanuelle. Of course this is a soft porn movie and they can't waste too much time on courting, can they? Anyway after only one dance with the husband in the hotel lounge, she leads him off to the hotel laundry room, which is conveniently unattended, for a ""roll in the sheets"" while washing machines and dryers are undulating to the beat of their sex.I should point out that in order for the wife to experience what her husband's sexual partner is experiencing, the partner, in this case the lithe Emmanuelle, must wear a special heart shaped necklace while the wife wears a matching tiara which is ostensibly connected to computer style flashing equipment. Now I don't know if this is the initial time they have tried this but something unexpected happens.Emmanuelle and the wife have mentally changed places. I must say that I found it a little disingenuous that Emmanuelle who suddenly found herself in a strange house, in a wheelchair, in a different body remained so calm. So calm in fact, that she manages, with the help of the equipment that put her in this state, to induce two would be burglars who were downstairs, a man and a woman, to engage in hot sex on the living room floor.When the husband and wife, now in Emmanuelle's body came home, the woman burglar said something like ""busted, call the cops, take us away, just no more sex, please."" This was one of many moments of levity that permeated the film kept the it light, despite the erotic subject matter. I must admit that I prefer this style of soft porn movie - humor over whips.Afterward, the wife and Emmanuelle re-exchanged bodies. Instead of being mad, EMMANULLE WAS INTRIGUED! She talked the couple into allowing her to be their field researcher, so armed with the tiara, a couple necklaces and a palm pilot linked back to the equipment, off Emmanuelle went to seduce the world or at least Las Vegas and LA.CONCLUSIONOk, the acting was lacking, (at least it wasn`t abysmal) and the babes even Emmanuelle were less than stunning but they did appear in various stages of undress and several showed everything they had (four by my count with at least as many topless). The story was corny but cute and some of the sets were a joke, like the one that was supposed to be in a lounge in the Tropicana Hotel that looked like someone's basement, with a painted concrete floor and all but hey it wasn't Ocean's Eleven now, was it.Emmanuelle herself was naughty but nice. She seemed to be undressed more than she was dressed and that was a pleasant experience, (seeing her that is). Holly Sampson is no knockout but she is attractive with blond hair and a lean body showing off champagne glass sized (...)with perky nipples. Holly really did seem to relish and enjoy the Succubus style part she played, and she certainly isn't shy.On a sensuality side the movie was lacking a bit. Almost all the sex scenes were immediate with little or no kissing or foreplay, which would not allow the viewer to warm to the moment but what the movie missing in sensuality it made up for with quantity .Obviously Emmanuelle's Intimate Encounters was a movie with strengths and weaknesses. No it was not a good movie but there is a dearth of good erotic movies. With erotic movies you come expect and therefore accept less as good. In that respect Emmanuelle's Intimate Encounters was a fairly good movie. Combining it's strengths and weaknesses I came out with a high three star rating.",3,Another Cheesy Emmanuelle,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,4180,"['Emmanuelle', 'flicks', 'go', 'Emmanuelle', 'Intimate', 'Encounters', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Yes', 'story', 'was', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'way', 'movie', 'sort', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'science', 'fiction', 'sexual', 'romp', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.Emmanuelle', 'played', 'film', 'actress', 'jour', 'Holly', 'Sampson', 'unwitting', 'player', 'married', 'couple', 'perversion', 'wife', 'paraplegic', 'having', 'previously', 'been', 'involved', 'auto', 'accident', 'apparently', 'scientist', 'well', 'found', 'way', 'experience', 'unbridled', 'sex', 'husband', 'vicariously', 'husband', 'surrogate', 'sexual', 'partner', 'case', 'Emmanuelle', 'slender', 'sylph', 'woman.I', 'must', 'admit', 'single', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'woman', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'eager', 'Emmanuelle', 'course', 'soft', 'porn', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'courting', 'can', 'Anyway', 'only', 'one', 'dance', 'husband', 'hotel', 'lounge', 'off', 'hotel', 'laundry', 'room', 'conveniently', 'unattended', 'roll', 'sheets', 'washing', 'machines', 'dryers', 'are', 'undulating', 'beat', 'sex.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'order', 'wife', 'experience', 'what', 'husband', 'sexual', 'partner', 'experiencing', 'partner', 'case', 'lithe', 'Emmanuelle', 'must', 'wear', 'special', 'heart', 'shaped', 'necklace', 'wife', 'matching', 'tiara', 'ostensibly', 'connected', 'computer', 'style', 'flashing', 'equipment', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'initial', 'time', 'have', 'tried', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happens.Emmanuelle', 'wife', 'have', 'mentally', 'changed', 'places', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'little', 'disingenuous', 'Emmanuelle', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'strange', 'house', 'wheelchair', 'different', 'body', 'remained', 'so', 'calm', 'So', 'calm', 'fact', 'help', 'equipment', 'put', 'state', 'induce', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'burglars', 'who', 'were', 'downstairs', 'man', 'woman', 'engage', 'hot', 'sex', 'living', 'room', 'husband', 'wife', 'now', 'Emmanuelle', 'body', 'came', 'home', 'woman', 'burglar', 'said', 'something', 'busted', 'call', 'cops', 'take', 'away', 'just', 'more', 'sex', 'please', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'moments', 'levity', 'permeated', 'film', 'kept', 'light', 'erotic', 'subject', 'matter', 'must', 'admit', 'prefer', 'style', 'soft', 'porn', 'movie', 'humor', 'whips.Afterward', 'wife', 'Emmanuelle', 're-exchanged', 'bodies', 'Instead', 'being', 'mad', 'EMMANULLE', 'WAS', 'INTRIGUED', 'talked', 'couple', 'allowing', 'be', 'field', 'researcher', 'so', 'armed', 'tiara', 'couple', 'necklaces', 'palm', 'pilot', 'linked', 'back', 'equipment', 'off', 'Emmanuelle', 'went', 'seduce', 'world', 'least', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'LA.CONCLUSIONOk', 'acting', 'was', 'lacking', 'least', 'wasn', 't', 'abysmal', 'babes', 'even', 'Emmanuelle', 'were', 'less', 'stunning', 'did', 'appear', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'several', 'showed', 'everything', 'had', 'four', 'count', 'least', 'many', 'topless', 'story', 'was', 'corny', 'cute', 'sets', 'were', 'joke', 'one', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'lounge', 'Tropicana', 'Hotel', 'looked', 'someone', 'basement', 'painted', 'concrete', 'floor', 'hey', 'was', ""n't"", 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'now', 'was', 'it.Emmanuelle', 'was', 'naughty', 'nice', 'seemed', 'be', 'undressed', 'more', 'was', 'dressed', 'was', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Holly', 'Sampson', 'knockout', 'attractive', 'blond', 'hair', 'lean', 'body', 'showing', 'off', 'champagne', 'glass', 'sized', 'perky', 'nipples', 'Holly', 'really', 'did', 'seem', 'relish', 'enjoy', 'Succubus', 'style', 'part', 'played', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'shy.On', 'sensuality', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'bit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'immediate', 'little', 'kissing', 'foreplay', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'viewer', 'warm', 'moment', 'what', 'movie', 'missing', 'sensuality', 'made', 'up', 'quantity', '.Obviously', 'Emmanuelle', 'Intimate', 'Encounters', 'was', 'movie', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'dearth', 'good', 'erotic', 'movies', 'erotic', 'movies', 'come', 'expect', 'therefore', 'accept', 'less', 'as', 'good', 'respect', 'Emmanuelle', 'Intimate', 'Encounters', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'Combining', 'strengths', 'came', 'out', 'high', 'three', 'star', 'rating']",N/A
