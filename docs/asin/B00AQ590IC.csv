Like many other reviewers have mention each dvd comes in paper sleeves. so chances are they well have scraches as soon a you open it. If you do manage to get a set that is scratch free I suggest you go buy a lotto ticket cause it might be your lucky day. The other bad thing is that sometimes the dvds works well in one dvd player but not in another. If you have problems with a disc try it in another dvd player since millcreek has terrible quality assurance. I didnt get my set from amazon so I cant exchange it but even if I could I bet I would be getting the same problem. If you want to keep your dvds from getting scraches from the sleeves I suggest that you look at amazon or ebay for multi disc cases and switch the disks and artwork to them. You might want to buy more then one since millcreek is sadly the only company pumping out old classic out of print or never been release obscure cartoons and tv series.,3,"Cool cartoon, bad dvd flaws",1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1022,"['great', 'street', 'sharks', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'dvd', 'downside', 'Millcreek', 'released', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mention', 'dvd', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'so', 'chances', 'are', 'well', 'have', 'scraches', 'soon', 'open', 'do', 'manage', 'get', 'set', 'scratch', 'free', 'suggest', 'go', 'buy', 'lotto', 'ticket', 'cause', 'might', 'be', 'lucky', 'day', 'other', 'bad', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'dvds', 'well', 'one', 'dvd', 'player', 'not', 'have', 'problems', 'disc', 'try', 'dvd', 'player', 'millcreek', 'terrible', 'quality', 'assurance', 'didnt', 'get', 'set', 'amazon', 'cant', 'exchange', 'even', 'could', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'same', 'problem', 'want', 'keep', 'dvds', 'getting', 'scraches', 'sleeves', 'suggest', 'look', 'amazon', 'ebay', 'multi', 'disc', 'cases', 'switch', 'disks', 'artwork', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'millcreek', 'sadly', 'only', 'company', 'pumping', 'out', 'old', 'classic', 'print', 'never', 'been', 'release', 'obscure', 'cartoons', 'tv', 'series']",Street Sharks - The Complete 40 Episode Series

1614808,A2P7OBZO1PH59P,B00AQ590IC,"B. Ross ""Cartoon Lover""","[6, 6]","The 80s and 90s were a time when cartoon action shows featured animal-warrior superheroes, and the Street Sharks are the most ""Jawsome"" of them all.  While the series maybe ""corny,"" as some adult viewers might say, it's a good comedy, all-action packed type of corny that most cartoons from the 1990s were known for.  The Street Sharks not only exemplify heroism but also family values.  The four super hero sharks (Ripster the Great White, Streex the Tiger Shark, Slammu the Whale Shark and Jab the Hammerhead) are brothers who work together to save the citizen of Fission City, thwart the evil schemes of the diabolical Doctor Paradigm and look for their beloved father, who remains secretly close by and helping his four sons in their quests.  They also form allegiances with other victims of Dr. Paradigm's mutation formulas, and even gain the friendship of humans who see the Sharks for who they are on the inside.I placed an order for this DVD complete series and received it three days later.  I was impressed with the fast delivery, but even more so with the amazing quality preserved in all 40 episodes. The whole collection is 10 episodes of the show each placed chronologically on four separate DVDs, which are all packaged neatly in individual sleeves into one DVD case.  The case is presented with a simple and fantastic looking cover, and the entire collection is priced at just $10, which is an excellent bargain for a four-disc DVD set.All in all, it was well worth the money spent to add this collection of animated memorabilia to my home video library.",5,Well worth it!!!,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1570,"['80s', '90s', 'were', 'time', 'when', 'cartoon', 'action', 'shows', 'featured', 'animal-warrior', 'superheroes', 'Street', 'Sharks', 'are', 'most', 'Jawsome', 'series', 'maybe', 'corny', 'adult', 'viewers', 'might', 'say', 'good', 'comedy', 'all-action', 'packed', 'type', 'corny', 'most', 'cartoons', '1990s', 'were', 'known', 'Street', 'Sharks', 'not', 'only', 'exemplify', 'heroism', 'also', 'family', 'values', 'four', 'super', 'hero', 'sharks', 'Ripster', 'Great', 'White', 'Streex', 'Tiger', 'Shark', 'Slammu', 'Whale', 'Shark', 'Jab', 'Hammerhead', 'are', 'brothers', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'citizen', 'Fission', 'City', 'thwart', 'evil', 'schemes', 'diabolical', 'Doctor', 'Paradigm', 'look', 'beloved', 'father', 'who', 'secretly', 'close', 'helping', 'four', 'sons', 'quests', 'also', 'form', 'allegiances', 'other', 'victims', 'Dr.', 'Paradigm', 'mutation', 'formulas', 'even', 'gain', 'friendship', 'humans', 'who', 'see', 'Sharks', 'who', 'are', 'inside.I', 'placed', 'order', 'DVD', 'complete', 'series', 'received', 'three', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'impressed', 'fast', 'delivery', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'amazing', 'quality', 'preserved', '40', 'episodes', 'whole', 'collection', '10', 'episodes', 'show', 'placed', 'chronologically', 'four', 'separate', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packaged', 'neatly', 'individual', 'sleeves', 'one', 'DVD', 'case', 'case', 'presented', 'simple', 'fantastic', 'looking', 'cover', 'entire', 'collection', 'priced', 'just', '10', 'excellent', 'bargain', 'four-disc', 'DVD', 'set.All', 'was', 'well', 'money', 'spent', 'add', 'collection', 'animated', 'memorabilia', 'home', 'video', 'library']",Street Sharks - The Complete 40 Episode Series
1614809,A1LXMEHG1LLXVQ,B00AQ590IC,Chase Marshall,"[1, 2]","I've only watched the first three episodes but man it took me back.  Those episodes looked fine, sounded fine, it's all good.  Cheesy and nostalgic maybe, but who cares it was one of those fun shows of the 90's that you wouldn't see nowadays because of picky viewers and even pickier TV stations.  The biggest drawback is the packaging.  I was totally surprised to open it and find the four discs waiting in paper sleeves.  I mean I get not wanting to do maybe a middle dvd holder thing or whatever...but paper sleeves?  Sure it's $10 for 40 episodes but I mean I bought a copy of Moribito the complete series and all eight discs were stacked on top of each other on one tall peg.  Not the greatest, but debatable that it's better than a stack of paper sleeved discs.Though really, it isn't the most horrible thing, just surprising and new though I hear from others this is how Mill Creek releases their dvds.

1614811,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B00AQ590IC,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[5, 7]","Animation series conquered the television screens during the 1980s until the mid 1990s. Growing up during that time period, I watched dozens of cartoon series, but by the mid 1990s I was out of my cartoon stage and became interested in other stuff. Now as an adult, I have taken an interest in revisiting the cartoons that I grew up with and others that I never got a chance to watch. One those series was Street Sharks that aired from 1994-1996. The complete series has recently been released to DVD for the first time from Mill Creek Entertainment, who sent me a complementary copy in exchange for my honest review.Street Sharks was based on the Mattel toy-line of the same name. The main plot involved Dr. Paradigm experimenting on gene-manipulation. His assistant, Dr. Robert Bolton, tried to destroy his research, but ended up being mutated before escaping the lab. Bolton's sons, John, Bobby, Coop, and Clint, investigated his disappearance, but were kidnapped by Dr. Paradigm, who turned them into sharks.The rest of the series focused on the brothers', now known as Ripster, Jab, Streex, and Big Slammu, attempts at capturing Dr. Paradigm, so he could return them back to their human form. Each episode has Dr. Paradigm turning people into mutants and the brothers must stop them.The 40 episodes on the two disc set are:Disc One: Sharkbait (Mini-Series Part 1), Shartsbite (Mini-Series) Part 2) Sharkstorm (Mini-Series Part 3), Shark Quest, Lone Shark, Shark N' Roll, Fresh Water Sharks, Shark Treatment, Road Shark, Shark FightBonus Episode: C.O.P.S. The Case of the Boy Who Cried Sea MonsterDisc Two: Sky Sharks, Sharks of Steel, Shark Source, Jurassic Shark, Sir Shark-A-Lot, Shark to the Future, First Shark, Rebel Sharks, Space Sharks, A Shark Among USDisc Three: To Shark or Not, Eco Shark, Close Encounters of the Shark Kind, Satellite Sharks, Cave Sharks, Shark Wars, Sharkfather, Shark Hunt, Card Sharks, Shark-JackedDisc Four: Turbo Shark, 20,000 Sharks Under the Sea, Ancient Sharkonauts, Sharkotic Reaction, Sand Sharks, Shark Quake, Super Shark, Jungle Shark,Trojan Sharks, Shark-Apolypose Now!I never watched Street Sharks during its original run, but I do remember it being advertised along with the toys. The main plot of four mutant brothers reminds me a lot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There is plenty of action every episode, but the plots are silly and outrageous. The series was short-lived and I&#8217;m glad that Mill Creek Entertainment is bringing these almost forgotten cartoons to DVD for a new generation. Just like similar releases, each disc is in a paper sleeve. Overall, I enjoyed watching each shark attack episode and I recommend it to other cartoon fans.",4,Shark Attack!,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2706,"['Animation', 'series', 'conquered', 'television', 'screens', '1980s', 'mid', '1990s', 'Growing', 'up', 'time', 'period', 'watched', 'dozens', 'cartoon', 'series', 'mid', '1990s', 'was', 'cartoon', 'stage', 'became', 'interested', 'other', 'stuff', 'Now', 'adult', 'have', 'taken', 'interest', 'revisiting', 'cartoons', 'grew', 'up', 'others', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'One', 'series', 'was', 'Street', 'Sharks', 'aired', '1994-1996', 'complete', 'series', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'who', 'sent', 'complementary', 'copy', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review.Street', 'Sharks', 'was', 'based', 'Mattel', 'toy-line', 'same', 'name', 'main', 'plot', 'involved', 'Dr.', 'Paradigm', 'experimenting', 'gene-manipulation', 'assistant', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Bolton', 'tried', 'destroy', 'research', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'mutated', 'escaping', 'lab', 'Bolton', 'sons', 'John', 'Bobby', 'Coop', 'Clint', 'investigated', 'disappearance', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'Dr.', 'Paradigm', 'who', 'turned', 'sharks.The', 'rest', 'series', 'focused', 'brothers', 'now', 'known', 'Ripster', 'Jab', 'Streex', 'Big', 'Slammu', 'capturing', 'Dr.', 'Paradigm', 'could', 'return', 'back', 'human', 'form', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Paradigm', 'turning', 'people', 'mutants', 'brothers', 'must', 'stop', 'them.The', '40', 'episodes', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'Disc', 'One', 'Sharkbait', 'Mini-Series', 'Part', '1', 'Shartsbite', 'Mini-Series', 'Part', '2', 'Sharkstorm', 'Mini-Series', 'Part', '3', 'Shark', 'Quest', 'Lone', 'Shark', 'Shark', 'N', 'Roll', 'Fresh', 'Water', 'Sharks', 'Shark', 'Treatment', 'Road', 'Shark', 'Shark', 'FightBonus', 'Episode', 'C.O.P.S', 'Case', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Sea', 'MonsterDisc', 'Two', 'Sky', 'Sharks', 'Sharks', 'Steel', 'Shark', 'Source', 'Jurassic', 'Shark', 'Sir', 'Shark-A-Lot', 'Shark', 'Future', 'First', 'Shark', 'Rebel', 'Sharks', 'Space', 'Sharks', 'A', 'Shark', 'USDisc', 'Three', 'Shark', 'Not', 'Eco', 'Shark', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Shark', 'Kind', 'Satellite', 'Sharks', 'Cave', 'Sharks', 'Shark', 'Wars', 'Sharkfather', 'Shark', 'Hunt', 'Card', 'Sharks', 'Shark-JackedDisc', 'Four', 'Turbo', 'Shark', '20,000', 'Sharks', 'Sea', 'Ancient', 'Sharkonauts', 'Sharkotic', 'Reaction', 'Sand', 'Sharks', 'Shark', 'Quake', 'Super', 'Shark', 'Jungle', 'Shark', 'Trojan', 'Sharks', 'Shark-Apolypose', 'Now', 'never', 'watched', 'Street', 'Sharks', 'original', 'run', 'do', 'remember', 'being', 'advertised', 'toys', 'main', 'plot', 'four', 'mutant', 'brothers', 'lot', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'plenty', 'action', 'episode', 'plots', 'are', 'silly', 'outrageous', 'series', 'was', 'short-lived', '8217', 'glad', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'bringing', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'cartoons', 'DVD', 'new', 'generation', 'Just', 'similar', 'releases', 'disc', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'shark', 'attack', 'episode', 'recommend', 'other', 'cartoon', 'fans']",Street Sharks - The Complete 40 Episode Series

I would only recommend this if you grew up on it, the first 2 disks and some of the 3rd disk were fun. Sometimes the animation is rubbery, sometimes the voices didn't match, especially with the sharks, most the episodes (Like He-Man or Thundercats) had the same villain and similar or the same plot and just felt like the same thing over and over. The show had little human involvement and treated humans (regular civilians and villains) as stupid, bad, irrelevant, etc. The sharks never know why the humans don't like or trust them a lot and I think if they stopped causing more damage in almost every single episode to their city then that may help their image a bit. Some episodes had these like music montages towards the end of them and this was a really lame and bad idea I felt, it would ruin some good episodes. The main villain was kinda cool, but some of the mutants he creates are really cool, be it hero or villain.Street Sharks *** out of *****Violent Content: 3/10 - Frequent Strong Stylized Action and Sci-Fi Violence, Brief Blood, and Brief War Violence, Mutations, Some Minor Animal Cruelty/Endangerment, Some Brief Human Cruelty, Frequent Needless Destruction, Some Car Accidents/Wrecks, and Suggested Drug Use.",3,Mostly a good 90's show,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1427,"['Other', 'last', 'half', 'disk', '3', 'Which', 'where', 'show', 'started', 'get', 'horrible', 'disk', '4', 'Where', 'NONE', 'episodes', 'were', 'even', 'OK', 'were', 'horrid', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'grew', 'up', 'first', '2', 'disks', '3rd', 'disk', 'were', 'fun', 'Sometimes', 'animation', 'rubbery', 'sometimes', 'voices', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'especially', 'sharks', 'most', 'episodes', 'He-Man', 'Thundercats', 'had', 'same', 'villain', 'similar', 'same', 'plot', 'just', 'felt', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'show', 'had', 'little', 'human', 'involvement', 'treated', 'humans', 'regular', 'civilians', 'villains', 'stupid', 'bad', 'irrelevant', 'etc', 'sharks', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'humans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'trust', 'lot', 'think', 'stopped', 'causing', 'more', 'damage', 'almost', 'single', 'episode', 'city', 'then', 'may', 'help', 'image', 'bit', 'episodes', 'had', 'music', 'montages', 'towards', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'lame', 'bad', 'idea', 'felt', 'would', 'ruin', 'good', 'episodes', 'main', 'villain', 'was', 'kinda', 'cool', 'mutants', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'be', 'villain.Street', 'Sharks', '***', '*****Violent', 'Content', '3/10', 'Frequent', 'Strong', 'Stylized', 'Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Violence', 'Brief', 'Blood', 'Brief', 'War', 'Violence', 'Mutations', 'Minor', 'Animal', 'Cruelty/Endangerment', 'Brief', 'Human', 'Cruelty', 'Frequent', 'Needless', 'Destruction', 'Car', 'Accidents/Wrecks', 'Suggested', 'Drug', 'Use']",Street Sharks - The Complete 40 Episode Series

It holds up very well and has some good action and comedy. It will definitely take you back some years seeing some things like retro fashions, slang, colors/artwork. Just all around good fun.Its a great set and i actually kind of like the packaging toy box uses. The cds are inside individual sleeves that are securely held in place inside the case. I hate getting a dvd case and hearing a loose dvd inside. A loose dvd inside means damage or scratches and i havent had that problem with toy box dvd sets.",5,Jawsome!!!,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,605,"['remember', 'watching', 'kid', 'love', 'older', 'retro', 'toons', 'i', 'had', 'add', 'collection', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'action', 'comedy', 'will', 'definitely', 'take', 'back', 'years', 'seeing', 'things', 'retro', 'fashions', 'slang', 'colors/artwork', 'Just', 'around', 'good', 'fun.Its', 'great', 'set', 'i', 'actually', 'kind', 'packaging', 'toy', 'box', 'cds', 'are', 'inside', 'individual', 'sleeves', 'are', 'securely', 'held', 'place', 'case', 'hate', 'getting', 'dvd', 'case', 'hearing', 'loose', 'dvd', 'inside', 'A', 'loose', 'dvd', 'damage', 'scratches', 'i', 'havent', 'had', 'problem', 'toy', 'box', 'dvd', 'sets']",Street Sharks - The Complete 40 Episode Series
