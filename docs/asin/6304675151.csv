I have found the kids under age 9 get bored with this movie, probably because it is in black and white. This film follows the same safe formula used in the first film, but there is something fresh and new about it that sets it apart from it's predecessor. The storyline is that Professor Branard's invention of Flubber has been confiscated by the government, leaving him and his wife pennyless. By using Flubber gas, he is able to make a gun that can control the weather, however it dosen't work according to plan. After a fight, his wife leaves him. Without funding, Medfield College will have to shut down. So when his invention gets him into trounle with the law, he tries to save the college and his marriage by helping the football team win their last game.This DVD release is very disapointing. Disney has restored the picture so that it looks almost as good as it did when the film came out, but they released it in fullscreen. This is the kind of film that needs to be viewed in it's original widescreen aspect ratio, because there are a lot of newspaper articles and you miss somw of the headlines. It is real frustrating trying to figure out what it says.

A very frustrating start to the terrific sequel to Absent Minded Professor, all adding to the frenection of MacMurray, who must now invent something entirely new so that he can save Medfield, his home, and his marriage from the slimey advances of Prof. Shelby Ashton (Elliot Reid) and the return of luscious old flame Desiree de la Roche (Joanna Moore).All the usual suspects are here from Disney's vast arsenal of character actors to keep us entertained while Ned goes about inventing a weathermaking glassbreaking foodgrowing machine. The Halloween chase scene with Prof. Brainerd terrorizing Shelby Ashton from above with his new rainmaking device is one of the funniest in Disney history. And of course we're treated to another Medfield sports showdown vs. national champs Rutland in a gridiron matchup where Flubber becomes the great equalizer. ROTFL!However, Disney gets no props for this DVD release. The retail case proudly proclaims on the cover ""The Original Black & White Classic."" Well, except for one thing...the original theatrical release was in 1.75 widescreen, not pan and scan like this version. Why would Disney do this you ask? That's a good question. When you have the answer to that mystery, maybe you can explain to me why they likewise released Absent Minded Professor in a ""colorized full screen"" edition 9 months before they released the original widescreen B&W; print on DVD. However, they did a superb job remastering this print cause the video is top notch, and you won't mind the Dolby mono, but there are sadly no extras on this disc to speak of unless you're the type that gets excited about a photo gallery and ads for other Disney films.
