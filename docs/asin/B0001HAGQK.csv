805218,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0001HAGQK,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[24, 26]","Aaron Sorkin is a prodigy. Nobody can write dialogue that simultaneously sounds so polished and natural like he can. He also can write well for people: his characters are believable, flawed, and heroic, and his view of the world is realistic, yet optimistic. I find myself missing my weekly dose of Sorkin's West Wing these days, but there is a prescription that can help: the West Wing DVD sets of yesteryear.The West Wing's second season had the show really hitting its stride. The season starts in the aftermath of the previous season's cliffhanger, with the President and Josh being shot by white supremacists and everyone else struggling to get through it all. Interspersed throughout the episode (In the Shadow of two Gunmen) were flashbacks to Bartlet's presidential campaign, a framework which really worked for the episode, although I cannot put my finger on how. Then, we were off to the races. I'll never forget Bartlet's vitriolic speech to the Dr. Laura-type pundit in ""The Midterms,"" good material to remember if you ever get engaged in a debate with someone who likes to pick and choose which parts of the Bible they like to follow. ""Do I have to kill my brother for planting different crops side by side?"" Great stuff. Among the rest of highlights: Emily Procter begins her recurring role as Ainsley Hayes, a Republican lawyer working in the White House and constant sparring partner for Sam. Her best episode here was ""And It's Surely to their Credit,"" which evoked much empathy for the poor soul. Plus, an impassioned speech at the end by Sam really got the juices flowing. The episode that just blew me away was ""Noel"", a haunting and poignant foray into Josh's head that really showed his pain underneath the facade of composure. The scene with Yo-Yo Ma alone was unbelievably intense. Perhaps the defining moment in the season is the discovery by Toby, and subsequently everyone else, that the President has Multiple Sclerosis, which is impressively explored in the episode ""17 People"". The episode takes the form of a series of fiery dialogues between Toby and the President and is filled with tension, but is lightened up by its subplot of staffers trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with jokes for the President. The juxtaposition is inspired, and the episode sets up what would become a key issue in the show for the upcoming season. ""Two Cathedrals"" was another episode with such raw emotional power -- the president announces his M.S. and contemplates whether or not to run. The final shot alone will send chills down your spine. This was surely Sorkin's best season on the show, in terms of narrative power (and that says a lot). It's what he does best: portraying the complex and jagged emotions that pervade us, consciously and subconsciously. Lord knows I miss him. Come back, Aaron. Please! We need you now more than ever.In conclusion, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative (or whatever in between), this is a show that you can enjoy. This is substantial entertainment, there's comedy, but also pathos, problems to solve and the interplay of emotions, ideas, and forces outside our control. Words cannot convey my deep respect for this show (and I don't even consider myself liberal). Get it, and see television as it once was, and as it might again be one day.",5,Mind-boggling stuff,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,3321,"['Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'prodigy', 'Nobody', 'can', 'write', 'dialogue', 'simultaneously', 'so', 'polished', 'natural', 'can', 'also', 'can', 'write', 'well', 'people', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'flawed', 'heroic', 'view', 'world', 'realistic', 'yet', 'optimistic', 'find', 'missing', 'weekly', 'dose', 'Sorkin', 'West', 'Wing', 'days', 'prescription', 'can', 'help', 'West', 'Wing', 'DVD', 'sets', 'yesteryear.The', 'West', 'Wing', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'show', 'really', 'hitting', 'stride', 'season', 'aftermath', 'previous', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'President', 'Josh', 'being', 'shot', 'white', 'supremacists', 'everyone', 'else', 'struggling', 'get', 'Interspersed', 'episode', 'Shadow', 'two', 'Gunmen', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'Bartlet', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'framework', 'really', 'worked', 'episode', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'finger', 'how', 'Then', 'were', 'off', 'races', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Bartlet', 'vitriolic', 'speech', 'Dr.', 'Laura-type', 'pundit', 'Midterms', 'good', 'material', 'remember', 'ever', 'get', 'engaged', 'debate', 'someone', 'who', 'pick', 'choose', 'parts', 'Bible', 'like', 'follow', 'Do', 'have', 'kill', 'brother', 'planting', 'different', 'crops', 'side', 'side', 'Great', 'stuff', 'rest', 'highlights', 'Emily', 'Procter', 'recurring', 'role', 'Ainsley', 'Hayes', 'Republican', 'lawyer', 'working', 'White', 'House', 'constant', 'sparring', 'partner', 'Sam', 'best', 'episode', 'here', 'was', 'Surely', 'Credit', 'evoked', 'much', 'empathy', 'poor', 'soul', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'end', 'Sam', 'really', 'got', 'juices', 'flowing', 'episode', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'was', 'Noel', 'haunting', 'poignant', 'foray', 'Josh', 'head', 'really', 'showed', 'pain', 'facade', 'composure', 'scene', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'alone', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'intense', 'Perhaps', 'defining', 'moment', 'season', 'discovery', 'Toby', 'subsequently', 'everyone', 'else', 'President', 'Multiple', 'Sclerosis', 'impressively', 'explored', 'episode', '17', 'People', 'episode', 'form', 'series', 'fiery', 'dialogues', 'Toby', 'President', 'filled', 'tension', 'lightened', 'up', 'subplot', 'staffers', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'come', 'up', 'jokes', 'President', 'juxtaposition', 'inspired', 'episode', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'key', 'issue', 'show', 'upcoming', 'season', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'was', 'episode', 'such', 'raw', 'emotional', 'power', 'president', 'M.S', 'not', 'run', 'final', 'shot', 'alone', 'will', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'was', 'surely', 'Sorkin', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'terms', 'narrative', 'power', 'lot', 'what', 'best', 'portraying', 'complex', 'jagged', 'emotions', 'pervade', 'consciously', 'subconsciously', 'Lord', 'miss', 'Come', 'back', 'Aaron', 'Please', 'need', 'now', 'more', 'ever.In', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'show', 'can', 'enjoy', 'substantial', 'entertainment', 'comedy', 'also', 'pathos', 'problems', 'solve', 'interplay', 'emotions', 'ideas', 'forces', 'control', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'convey', 'deep', 'respect', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'liberal', 'Get', 'see', 'television', 'once', 'was', 'might', 'again', 'be', 'one', 'day']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...The West Wing (Season 2) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 1"" in which the staff awaits news relating to the gunshot wounds suffered by Josh Lyman and President Bartlett, prompting them to reminisce about their initial involvement in Bartlet's campaign and how they all came to know each other. Meanwhile, Leo, Toby, and C.J. examine the formal inquiry into the Secret Service's policies as well as the legal implications of Bartlet's surgery and the transfer of his executive power... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""In This White House"" in which the White House staffers host a contingent of pharmaceutical executives and leaders from Africans nations in relation to ending the AIDS crisis, and ""The Leadership Breakfast"" in which the staffers participate in a bi-partisan breakfast which they hope will actually substantively tackle an issue...Below is a list of episodes included on the West Wing (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (In the Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 1)Episode 24 (In the Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 2)Episode 25 (The Midterms)Episode 26 (In This White House)Episode 27 (And It's Surely to Their Credit)Episode 28 (The Lame Duck Congress)Episode 29 (The Portland Trip)Episode 30 (Shibboleth)Episode 31 (Galileo)Episode 32 (Noel)Episode 33 (The Leadership Breakfast)Episode 34 (The Drop In)Episode 35 (Bartlet's Third State of the Union)Episode 36 (The War at Home)Episode 37 (Ellie)Episode 38 (Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail)Episode 39 (The Stackhouse Filibuster)Episode 40 (17 People)Episode 41 (Bad Moon Rising)Episode 42 (The Fall's Gonna Kill You)Episode 43 (18th and Potomac)Episode 44 (Two Cathedrals)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating series...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3123,"['Premiering', 'September', '1999', 'original', 'NBC', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'built', 'instant', 'cult', 'following', 'seemingly', 'realistic', 'weekly', 'excursions', 'inner', 'sanctums', 'White', 'House', 'series', 'became', 'such', 'hit', 'pollsters', 'claimed', 'certain', 'people', 'actually', 'believed', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'real', 'president', 'true', 'more', 'negative', 'reflection', 'intelligence', 'electorate', 'not', 'necessarily', 'indication', 'West', 'Wing', 'realism', 'regardless', 'truth', 'matter', 'West', 'Wing', 'definitely', 'chord', 'certain', 'audiences', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'brew', 'action', 'suspense', 'drama', 'weekly', 'basis', 'Seasoned', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'lead', 'role', 'President', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'day-to-day', 'affairs', 'Bartlet', 'administration', 'are', 'run', 'number', 'individuals', 'who', 'surround', 'are', 'Claudia', 'C.J', 'Cregg', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Toby', 'Ziegler', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 'John', 'Spencer', 'Charlie', 'Young', 'Dule', 'Hill', 'West', 'Wing', 'dedicated', 'staffers', 'work', 'extended', 'hours', 'behind-the-scenes', 'help', 'keep', 'White', 'House', 'running', 'smoothly', 'way', 'stress', 'job', 'characters', 'personal', 'lives', 'make', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'real-life', 'White', 'House', 'administration', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Shadow', 'Two', 'Gunmen', 'Part', '1', 'staff', 'news', 'relating', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'suffered', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'prompting', 'reminisce', 'initial', 'involvement', 'Bartlet', 'campaign', 'how', 'came', 'know', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'Leo', 'Toby', 'C.J', 'examine', 'formal', 'inquiry', 'Secret', 'Service', 'policies', 'as', 'well', 'legal', 'implications', 'Bartlet', 'surgery', 'transfer', 'executive', 'power', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'White', 'House', 'White', 'House', 'staffers', 'host', 'contingent', 'pharmaceutical', 'executives', 'leaders', 'Africans', 'nations', 'relation', 'ending', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'Leadership', 'Breakfast', 'staffers', 'participate', 'bi-partisan', 'breakfast', 'hope', 'will', 'actually', 'substantively', 'issue', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Shadow', 'Two', 'Gunmen', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '24', 'Shadow', 'Two', 'Gunmen', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '25', 'Midterms', 'Episode', '26', 'White', 'House', 'Episode', '27', 'Surely', 'Their', 'Credit', 'Episode', '28', 'Lame', 'Duck', 'Congress', 'Episode', '29', 'Portland', 'Trip', 'Episode', '30', 'Shibboleth', 'Episode', '31', 'Galileo', 'Episode', '32', 'Noel', 'Episode', '33', 'Leadership', 'Breakfast', 'Episode', '34', 'Drop', 'Episode', '35', 'Bartlet', 'Third', 'State', 'Union', 'Episode', '36', 'War', 'Home', 'Episode', '37', 'Ellie', 'Episode', '38', 'Somebody', 'Going', 'Emergency', 'Somebody', 'Going', 'Jail', 'Episode', '39', 'Stackhouse', 'Filibuster', 'Episode', '40', '17', 'People', 'Episode', '41', 'Bad', 'Moon', 'Rising', 'Episode', '42', 'Fall', 'Gon', 'Kill', '43', '18th', 'Potomac', 'Episode', '44', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'DVD', 'Report']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

805246,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0001HAGQK,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","Season 1 of the West Wing was a bit uneven at times, and lacked a season-arching continuity.  Season 2 does not suffer this problem, and so makes for enjoyable watching from end to end, with recurring plotlines stretching over the entire season and consistently high levels of quality in acting, directing, and screenplays.So what is going on at the White House?  Well, it turns out that the President has multiple schlerosis, which could cause him to lose consciousness at unpredictable times.  This is obviously a problem for someone with the nuclear launch codes, but is early enough in the disease that it's not an acute problem.  Unfortunately, if the president intends to run for reelection, there's the issue of whether he maliciously covered up the fact that he has MS, and what the public should know when voting.  In fact, very few of the senior staff (only Leo, the VP, and a couple cabinet members) know, and as the others are let in on the secret, they do not take it well.  Toby takes it particularly badly, and some of the best shows (17 People, the Stackhouse Filibuster) focus on the relationship between Leo, Toby, and Bartlet.Then there is the question of reelection - should the president, with his MS, actually run again?  If not, should he even finish his term?  What about getting his legislation through?  What about international crises like a military coup in Haiti?  What about the aftermath of the assassination attempt?  Will Leo gain any converts to the idea of ""Big Block of Cheese"" day?Oddly enough, special mention must be made of both the (2-part) premier and the final show, which are flashback episodes.  ""In the Shadow of 2 Gunmen"" gives us flashbacks to the hype and excited optimism of Bartlet's winning of the Democratic nomination for president.  In a nifty contrast, ""Two Cathedrals"" at the end of the season provides a flashback even further back, when Jed was in high school and first debating politics with Mrs. Landingham, which helps shape his decision on whether to seek reelection.  Viewers who pay attention during the episode will be rewarded with the answer to the question ""Will you seek reelection,"" even though the show stops before Bartlet verbally answers.So, pick up Season 2 of the West Wing for the best examples of the show's wit, relatively even-handed politics (Ainsley, the Republican lawyer, scores not a few points for the Right in a number of episodes), and fast-paced verbal action.  It well deserved the Emmy for best drama.  Unfortunately, there are precious few extras on this DVD package - don't be fooled by the box's list, they are quite short and deal entirely with the mechanics of the show.  Again, I have to ask, where are the extras on actual politics?  Why not do documentaries on the issues in the show?  Why not show us some of the ""extra material"" the producers supposedly make available to schools that use the show as a civics lesson?",5,The cast and writers are at the peaks of their game,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2919,"['Season', '1', 'West', 'Wing', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven', 'times', 'lacked', 'season-arching', 'continuity', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'suffer', 'problem', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'end', 'end', 'recurring', 'plotlines', 'stretching', 'entire', 'season', 'consistently', 'high', 'levels', 'quality', 'acting', 'directing', 'screenplays.So', 'what', 'going', 'White', 'House', 'Well', 'out', 'President', 'multiple', 'schlerosis', 'could', 'cause', 'lose', 'consciousness', 'unpredictable', 'times', 'obviously', 'problem', 'someone', 'nuclear', 'launch', 'codes', 'early', 'enough', 'disease', 'not', 'acute', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'president', 'run', 'reelection', 'issue', 'maliciously', 'covered', 'up', 'fact', 'MS', 'what', 'public', 'should', 'know', 'when', 'voting', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'senior', 'staff', 'only', 'Leo', 'VP', 'couple', 'cabinet', 'members', 'know', 'others', 'are', 'let', 'secret', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'Toby', 'particularly', 'badly', 'best', 'shows', '17', 'People', 'Stackhouse', 'Filibuster', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Leo', 'Toby', 'Bartlet.Then', 'question', 'reelection', 'should', 'president', 'MS', 'actually', 'run', 'again', 'not', 'should', 'even', 'finish', 'term', 'What', 'getting', 'legislation', 'What', 'international', 'crises', 'military', 'coup', 'Haiti', 'What', 'aftermath', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Will', 'Leo', 'gain', 'converts', 'idea', 'Big', 'Block', 'Cheese', 'day', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', '2-part', 'premier', 'final', 'show', 'are', 'flashback', 'episodes', 'Shadow', '2', 'Gunmen', 'flashbacks', 'hype', 'excited', 'optimism', 'Bartlet', 'winning', 'Democratic', 'nomination', 'president', 'nifty', 'contrast', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'end', 'season', 'flashback', 'even', 'further', 'back', 'when', 'Jed', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'debating', 'politics', 'Mrs.', 'Landingham', 'shape', 'decision', 'seek', 'reelection', 'Viewers', 'who', 'pay', 'attention', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'answer', 'question', 'Will', 'seek', 'reelection', 'even', 'show', 'Bartlet', 'verbally', 'answers.So', 'pick', 'up', 'Season', '2', 'West', 'Wing', 'best', 'examples', 'show', 'wit', 'relatively', 'even-handed', 'politics', 'Ainsley', 'Republican', 'lawyer', 'not', 'few', 'points', 'Right', 'number', 'episodes', 'fast-paced', 'verbal', 'action', 'well', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'best', 'drama', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'extras', 'DVD', 'package', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'box', 'list', 'are', 'quite', 'short', 'deal', 'entirely', 'mechanics', 'show', 'Again', 'have', 'ask', 'where', 'are', 'extras', 'actual', 'politics', 'Why', 'not', 'do', 'documentaries', 'issues', 'show', 'Why', 'not', 'show', 'extra', 'material', 'producers', 'supposedly', 'make', 'available', 'schools', 'use', 'show', 'civics', 'lesson']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

Well, it was a very impressive first time around looking more like an extended film with a phenomenal cast growing into their characters with some splendid writing and interesting stories.  While by the end of the first season the plotting was becoming a little repetitious with a main story involving the entire cast and a sub-plot usually about one of the characters on a personal level.  In the second season most of this predictability is thrown out the window, the cast is expanded to include some great guest acting, the acting and writing are much sharper, and the classiest of all moves is that the show is now being shot in Widescreen.  But I do have a question: What happened to Moira Kelly?  She is absent from the entire second season with no apparent explanation for her absence.  Also, during the first season it was fairly frequent that sub-characters were discarded for four or five episodes at a time and I was left wondering just where those characters have gone.  In the second season, just when I began to wonder when I would see a certain character again, the actor would promptly return to the West Wing to let me know they haven't gone away.  In other words, none of the sub-characters are ever discarded or forgotten, giving the show a transfusion of energy and newness just when it needs it.  This exceptional cast has finally gelled and completely embraced their characters with depth of emotion and nuance of characterization.  The second season has the show in full flight.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[3, 3]","With the benefit of retrospect over the past four years of the West Wing, years that have ranged from uneven to irrelevant to awful, it now becomes clear the show climaxed in season 2, a rousing, magnificently plotted, unforgettable season.  The first half of the season - that is, after the jaw dropping how'd-we-come-this-far two parter ""In The Shadow of Two Gunmen"" - is occupied by the weekly duties of the righteous - i.e. granting asylum here, falling satellites there.  That sort of thing could get tedious and self-aggrandizing easily, but with Sorkin writing at his fluid best, it makes for the stuff of compelling left wing fables.  That's true even when they include the right wing - the addition of Emily Proctor's spunky and endearing Ainsley Hayes is an inspired setup that, out of nowhere, brings into focus all the dreams and hopes of people that work in Washington.  Of course, the first half of the season is just there to get us complacent for the long narrative of the season - the unveiling of President Bartlett's run for a second term and the admission of his MS.  This plotline, stretched as it is, never lost dramatic momentum and had the rare ability to bring out the fiery best in every single cast member, from Toby's stirring discovery in ""17 People"" to Abby's ferocious and heartbreaking scream of ""We had a deal!"" in ""Bartlett's Third State of the Union.""  The build of this plot is so involving, that by the time it reaches its elegant and even understated conclusion in ""Two Cathedrals,"" we can scarcely remember ever seeing anything like it.  And, to put in my two cents for the best West Wing episode ever, may I cast a vote for ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You,"" an episode that, in barely trying, brings out the complex moral middleground of its great female characters CJ and Abby.  The moment CJ, with cold focus, finally answers the question ""Have you ever lied about the President's health"" feels like the foundational moment for arguably The West Wing's most memorable senior staff member.",5,Truly outstanding television,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2025,"['benefit', 'retrospect', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'West', 'Wing', 'years', 'have', 'ranged', 'uneven', 'irrelevant', 'awful', 'now', 'clear', 'show', 'climaxed', 'season', '2', 'rousing', 'magnificently', 'plotted', 'unforgettable', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'jaw', 'dropping', ""how'd-we-come-this-far"", 'two', 'parter', 'Shadow', 'Two', 'Gunmen', 'occupied', 'weekly', 'duties', 'righteous', 'i.e', 'granting', 'asylum', 'here', 'falling', 'satellites', 'there', 'sort', 'thing', 'could', 'get', 'tedious', 'self-aggrandizing', 'easily', 'Sorkin', 'writing', 'fluid', 'best', 'stuff', 'compelling', 'left', 'wing', 'fables', 'true', 'even', 'when', 'include', 'right', 'wing', 'addition', 'Emily', 'Proctor', 'spunky', 'endearing', 'Ainsley', 'Hayes', 'inspired', 'setup', 'nowhere', 'focus', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'people', 'work', 'Washington', 'course', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'just', 'there', 'get', 'complacent', 'long', 'narrative', 'season', 'unveiling', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'run', 'second', 'term', 'admission', 'MS', 'plotline', 'stretched', 'never', 'lost', 'dramatic', 'momentum', 'had', 'rare', 'ability', 'bring', 'out', 'fiery', 'best', 'single', 'cast', 'member', 'Toby', 'stirring', 'discovery', '17', 'People', 'Abby', 'ferocious', 'heartbreaking', 'scream', 'had', 'deal', 'Bartlett', 'Third', 'State', 'Union', 'build', 'plot', 'so', 'involving', 'time', 'elegant', 'even', 'understated', 'conclusion', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'can', 'scarcely', 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'anything', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'best', 'West', 'Wing', 'episode', 'ever', 'may', 'cast', 'vote', 'Fall', 'Gon', 'Kill', 'episode', 'barely', 'trying', 'out', 'complex', 'moral', 'middleground', 'great', 'female', 'characters', 'CJ', 'Abby', 'moment', 'CJ', 'cold', 'focus', 'finally', 'question', 'Have', 'ever', 'lied', 'President', 'health', 'feels', 'foundational', 'moment', 'arguably', 'West', 'Wing', 'most', 'memorable', 'senior', 'staff', 'member']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

Starting off with a bang (no pun intended), we see the roots of the Bartlet campaign as Josh Lyman holds on for his life following the VA shootings that ended season 1. As the characters slowly recover from the traumatic experience, the series shifts to President Bartlet's MS and his bid to run for reelection. You get the feeling that Aaron Sorkin picked up on some of the criticisms of last season's so-called grandstanding and soapbox sermonizing, as he delved deep into the personalities of each of the cast members to show a kind of pain and longing that binds them together through thick and thin, this time through standing behind Jed as he admits to the country that he lied about his health. The season (along with Season 3's two-part opener &quot;Manchester&quot;) takes a swooping bow into the reelection year with the kind of heart and vigor that's rarely seen by movies nowadays.The highlights are a plenty throughout the magnificent season, peaking with the focus pieces on each staff member: Sam's father in &quot;Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going To Jail&quot;, Josh's post-traumatic stress disorder in the emmy-winning &quot;Noel&quot;, Toby's ethical battles and toe-to-toe face off with POTUS in my personal favorite, &quot;17 People&quot;, and a look into Jed's past with what has to be one of the most sublime and superbly acted episodes in the season finale &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot;.We get a gentler and smoother hand guiding us this season, a contrast to last season's desperation leading up to the semi-forced &quot;Let Bartlet Be Bartlet&quot; that finally brought the gang ready to play. In season 2, you see a more serious and deeper exploration of above all things, a surrogate family struggling to survive and depending on eachother as things get tougher, leading up to Jed's announcement for reelection, done with such great skill that you want to cheer, you want to cry, you want more.....which is a shame, since Season 3 just can't compare to the first two...Especially this one.",5,Who says people don't want smart television?,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,2211,"['viewing', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'numerous', 'times', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'season', 'terms', 'WW', 'series', 'also', 'finest', 'television', 'today', 'Starting', 'off', 'bang', 'pun', 'intended', 'see', 'roots', 'Bartlet', 'campaign', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'life', 'following', 'VA', 'shootings', 'ended', 'season', '1', 'characters', 'slowly', 'recover', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'series', 'shifts', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'MS', 'bid', 'run', 'reelection', 'get', 'feeling', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'picked', 'up', 'criticisms', 'last', 'season', 'so-called', 'grandstanding', 'soapbox', 'sermonizing', 'delved', 'deep', 'personalities', 'cast', 'members', 'show', 'kind', 'pain', 'longing', 'together', 'thick', 'thin', 'time', 'standing', 'behind', 'Jed', 'country', 'lied', 'health', 'season', 'Season', '3', 'two-part', 'opener', 'quot', 'Manchester', 'quot', 'swooping', 'bow', 'reelection', 'year', 'kind', 'heart', 'vigor', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'nowadays.The', 'highlights', 'are', 'plenty', 'magnificent', 'season', 'peaking', 'focus', 'pieces', 'staff', 'member', 'Sam', 'father', 'quot', 'Somebody', 'Going', 'Emergency', 'Somebody', 'Going', 'Jail', 'quot', 'Josh', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'emmy-winning', 'quot', 'Noel', 'quot', 'Toby', 'ethical', 'battles', 'toe-to-toe', 'face', 'POTUS', 'personal', 'favorite', 'quot', '17', 'People', 'quot', 'look', 'Jed', 'past', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'sublime', 'superbly', 'acted', 'episodes', 'season', 'finale', 'quot', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'quot', '.We', 'get', 'gentler', 'smoother', 'hand', 'guiding', 'season', 'contrast', 'last', 'season', 'desperation', 'leading', 'up', 'semi-forced', 'quot', 'Let', 'Bartlet', 'Be', 'Bartlet', 'quot', 'finally', 'brought', 'gang', 'ready', 'play', 'season', '2', 'see', 'more', 'serious', 'deeper', 'exploration', 'things', 'surrogate', 'family', 'struggling', 'survive', 'depending', 'things', 'get', 'tougher', 'leading', 'up', 'Jed', 'announcement', 'reelection', 'done', 'such', 'great', 'skill', 'want', 'cheer', 'want', 'cry', 'want', 'more', '..which', 'shame', 'Season', '3', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'two', 'Especially', 'one']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

First, the president, as played by Martin Sheen.My friend described President Barclay as the president we wished Bill Clinton had been.  He is a principled New England catholic who doesn't need women.  H'mmm.  Maybe he's the president we wished John Kennedy had been.Anyway, Sheen did such a good job in the first season that they wrote a lot more stuff for him here in the second season.  He struggles here with more ethical concerns, many of which occur close to home.  My favorite moment:  when he tells a trusted advisor who operates as an ethical canary-in-the-coal-mine to shut up.But the series was really about the senior White House staff:  the operatives, press handlers, and political muscle men.  It teaches at the same time as it entertains - somehow avoiding a fatal cynicism, we're fascinted by both how little and how much can be done within our system.Worst thing about Season Two:  Season One.

Well-written by Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote two Rob Reiner films ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The American President"", the depth of the political and social subject matter is very good.As most people know, the series has garnered many Emmy awards.Season two literally takes up where season one ended, thanks to the season one cliff-hanger ending involving an assassination attempt. Season two continues to investigate a wide range of issues - from drug-company motives and profits, political asylum for persecuted Chinese Christians, education measures, and the president's muscular dystrophy.The series still has some humor amid the drama. In one scene, after three months, the president finally meets an attractive young Republican attorney in her White House basement office - as she is drunk and dancing and singing in her bathrobe. He gives her a greeting humorously suggested earlier by Rob Lowe - ""Yeah, Ainsley. I wanted to say hello and to mention, you know, uh...a lot of people assumed you were hired because you were a blonde Republican sex kitten, and, well, they're obviously wrong.

Charlie spends most of the ""Shibboleth"" episode (directed by Laura Innes of ER fame) trying to pick out a knife for the President to carve his Thanksgiving turkey.Aside from the superb regular and recurring cast there are guest stars galore from Adam Arkin to Marlee Matlin and so many more.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 1]","The West Wing pulls together all elements of great ""shows"" - writing, directing, acting, sets, costumes, lighting and music - in a way that always has me at rapt attention.At the end of Season one the cliffhanger had gunmen raining a hail of bullets down on the President's entourage leaving a televised town meeting - the shooting and editing of that sequence was intentionally confusing and as season one faded to the final credits a voice cried out ""Who's been shot? Who's been shot?""The 2-part opening of Season Two tells us who was shot, and the motivations of the shooters - and the scenes following the shooting are intercut with scenes from the beginning of the Bartlet campaign, back when Senator Hoynes had the nomination all sewed up and Jed Bartlet was only a liberal intellectual Governor from New England.  We get to see how Josh and Sam and Donna join the Cinderella campaign.  We get to see how Tobey goes from the guy who has overseen a half dozen losing campaigns to trusted advisor to the President.  We see C.J. go from press secretary for Hollywood's fattest egos to the job she was meant to have - as President Barlet's Press Secretary.The writing has always come from a liberal/democrat perspective, but I think Aaron Sorkin and his team have also tried to show a balanced perspective.  Ainsley Hayes, a brilliant young Republican Lawyer, is first shown trouncing Sam on a Sunday morning talk show over education.  President Bartlet recognizes her intelligence and fire and has Leo ask her to become a White House lawyer - which provides more opportunities for ""opposing viewpoints"".The season progresses in a realistic manner, and although I've been a Republican my entire voting life - going back to Reagan's first election against President Carter - I only hope and pray that the men and women who are actually running my country are doing it with as much intelligence and compassion as the fictional Democrats of ""The West Wing"".Bravo, Sorkin and company.",5,TVs Best Show presents: it's 2nd Emmy-Winning Season,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1982,"['West', 'Wing', 'together', 'elements', 'great', 'shows', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'sets', 'costumes', 'lighting', 'music', 'way', 'always', 'rapt', 'attention.At', 'end', 'Season', 'one', 'cliffhanger', 'had', 'gunmen', 'raining', 'hail', 'bullets', 'down', 'President', 'entourage', 'leaving', 'televised', 'town', 'meeting', 'shooting', 'editing', 'sequence', 'was', 'intentionally', 'confusing', 'season', 'one', 'faded', 'final', 'credits', 'voice', 'cried', 'Who', 'been', 'shot', 'Who', 'been', 'shot', '2-part', 'opening', 'Season', 'Two', 'tells', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'motivations', 'shooters', 'scenes', 'following', 'shooting', 'are', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'Bartlet', 'campaign', 'back', 'when', 'Senator', 'Hoynes', 'had', 'nomination', 'sewed', 'up', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'only', 'liberal', 'intellectual', 'Governor', 'New', 'England', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Josh', 'Sam', 'Donna', 'join', 'Cinderella', 'campaign', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Tobey', 'guy', 'who', 'overseen', 'half', 'dozen', 'losing', 'campaigns', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'President', 'see', 'C.J', 'go', 'press', 'secretary', 'Hollywood', 'fattest', 'egos', 'job', 'was', 'meant', 'have', 'President', 'Barlet', 'Press', 'Secretary.The', 'writing', 'always', 'come', 'liberal/democrat', 'perspective', 'think', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'team', 'have', 'also', 'tried', 'show', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'Ainsley', 'Hayes', 'brilliant', 'young', 'Republican', 'Lawyer', 'first', 'shown', 'trouncing', 'Sam', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'talk', 'show', 'education', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'intelligence', 'fire', 'Leo', 'ask', 'become', 'White', 'House', 'lawyer', 'more', 'opportunities', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', '.The', 'season', 'progresses', 'realistic', 'manner', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Republican', 'entire', 'voting', 'life', 'going', 'back', 'Reagan', 'first', 'election', 'President', 'Carter', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'running', 'country', 'are', 'doing', 'as', 'much', 'intelligence', 'compassion', 'fictional', 'Democrats', 'West', 'Wing', '.Bravo', 'Sorkin', 'company']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)

This season was filmed during the last year of the Clinton administration through the beginning of the Bush administration.  They tend to center around social issues and never criticize the actual administration.  They also have a tendency to bring up general issues from a political view that the general public never thinks of when they listen to the evening news. Now I am a die hard Reagan Republican and I have never taken offense with the show (I sometimes disagree with their stance but never thought that they were malicious.)This is a generally brilliantly written and directed series.  The only complaint that I have is at times the writting gets a little smug.  The lines are a little too ""look at how smart I am.""  I think that they are trying to copy David Mamet's style of writing.  The only problem is that despite how brilliant Mamet is 22 episodes of Mamet will get on anyone's nerves.  I want to empisize that this is a minor flaw in a great season.As we left season 1 of The West Wing, the President, his daughter and the White House staff were leaving a lecture when gunmen opened fire.Season Two is presented on 4 double sided DVD's (Twenty two episodes on discs 1 -3 and extras on disc 4).  The following is (hopefully) a brief summary of each episode and extra:Disc One Side A:In the Shadow of Two Gunmen - The aftermath of the shooting.  The President and Josh have been shot.  This turns into a flashback on how the West Wing staff came together.

You start with a blueprint of the White House and navigate to each room that has a photo gallery.  At the beginning there is a 15 minute documentary on the production design with designer Jon Hutman and producer Thomas Schlamme.  It's a good look at the actual production design for the series.Gag Order - just over one minute of bloopers - fun but too shortDeleted Scenes - 10 minutes of 9 deleted or abridged scenes - The only problem is that there is no setup for these scenes, so we don't know why this was deleted or just abridged.",5,A Great Show Gets Greater,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,7503,"['West', 'Wing', 'look',

With repeated viewings I've come to critique the writing and acting in a new way, but theres never a blatant let-down from episode to episode. Theres a handful of 'devices' in the writing that are used to convey the intelligence of the characters that gets repeated a lot.. and theres the over riding tendency of all the characters to, you know, use the same key phrase ('you know'.)But the first 4 seasons are a treasure.

Yet, every once in a very great while, there comes along a show which is really worth watching.  The West Wing (TWW) was such a show.  The members of the White House staff are portrayed as smart, energetic, and principled, which is of course at variance to government in general.  Jon Stewart once described The West Wing as ""Total ******* bull****.""  In a sense, he was right.  These characters aren't really true to life, particularly when it comes to the issue of integrity.  But we wish that's how our government operated. And that's why TWW was, for me, appointment television.Noel has particular interest to me as a therapist.  It is well-written, the hallmark of Aaron Sorkin's work, with excellent character development.  The stages that the character Josh Lyman goes through with metamorphoses in his issue of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder are very true to life.  All of the symptoms he shows are textbook, and they were very well acted.

This series follows on exactly from the cliff hanger that the first series ended on and the opening two episodes focus on the aftermath of the shooting. It then progresses to look at various events in the year of the administration, including the hiring of a republican lawyer to work in the White House, a Haitian election crisis, a Columbian crisis involving kidnapped American drug officers, an inspiring filibuster, post traumatic stress affecting staff after the shooting and the presidents own situation where he has MS and didn't tell anyone before he ran for election. In fact this last story dominates the second half of the series and makes for engrossing viewing as the ramifications, politically, legally and personally, become clearer. Like the first series this is very well written, with intelligence and humour and I love how the audience is respected to understand the political concepts with minimal explanation. This may be mildly biased and patriotic towards America (as you would expect from an American show), but it doesn't shy away from the more unsavoury aspects of American politics and this makes for quite a well rounded show overall.

It is a show that attempts to make Democrats look like idealistic, well meaning, courageous, 24/7 workaholics. These people do exist, but in light of the recent death of Ronald Reagan and the new Bill Clinton book, it is instructive to recall that this show, along with &quot;The American President&quot;, was an attempt to disuade the public from the realities of the Clinton Presidency. If the Democrats were all like the ones shown in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, they would get 90 percent of the vote.Th show does try to stay balanced on occasion, but a comparison between President Bartlett and his wife and Bill and Hillary Clinton provides a dose of reality that is not of help to Clinton apologists.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASAEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;...",4,&quot;THE LEFT WING&quot;,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,1050,"['quot', 'West', 'Wing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Left', 'Wing', 'quot', 'call', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'work', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'political', 'junkies', 'Manna', 'Heaven', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'dedicated', 'Democrat', 'star', 'show', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'show', 'make', 'Democrats', 'look', 'idealistic', 'well', 'meaning', 'courageous', '24/7', 'workaholics', 'people', 'do', 'exist', 'light', 'recent', 'death', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'new', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'book', 'instructive', 'recall', 'show', 'quot', 'American', 'President', 'quot', 'was', 'attempt', 'disuade', 'public', 'realities', 'Clinton', 'Presidency', 'Democrats', 'were', 'ones', 'shown', 'quot', 'West', 'Wing', 'quot', 'would', 'get', '90', 'percent', 'vote.Th', 'show', 'try', 'stay', 'balanced', 'occasion', 'comparison', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'wife', 'Bill', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'dose', 'reality', 'not', 'help', 'Clinton', 'apologists.STEVEN', 'TRAVERSAUTHOR', 'OF', 'quot', 'BARRY', 'BONDS', 'BASAEBALL', 'SUPERMAN', 'quot']",WEST WING: S2 (DVD)
