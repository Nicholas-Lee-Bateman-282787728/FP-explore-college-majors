909646,AR0TPKBRIOECO,B0009OL934,,"[0, 0]","What's there to say that I have not said about that first two seasons?The door to junior high is about to close, and the door to senior high is to open. The ups and downs of friendship and intimacy are clear as day and night. The need-to-know issues from racism and drinking to anorexia and depression to dealing with divorce and (do I dare say) sexual preference are top priority. No &#34;Beverly Hills 90210&#34; blues added or needed.Joey is still learning the hard way. Wheels has begun his downward and upward spiraling following the tragic loss of his parents. Kathleen is too proud to admit she has problems. Lucy is going about the right and wrong ways of proving her self-suffiency. Spike is dealing with being a student and a mother, back and forth about whether Shane is in or out. Arthur and Yick, once the lightest of the guys in class, are each growing into their own--and so far liking their standings as bachelors. Melanie and Snake are yet to get past mono-syllables. Mr. Raditch is as professional as ever, like Mr. Feeny after him. Ms. Avery is  still laid-back, as long as no one or nothing gets on her bad side. Oh, and like students, parents, and teachers, school buildings are not perfect.How much better would &#34;Degrassi: The Next Generation&#34; be if they stuck with the standards set by and with the original concept and class.

909648,A565PMDP4YNU4,B0009OL934,Big Joe '83,"[3, 4]","During its third season, you can see Degrassi slightly alter its format a bit to fit in with the significant changes to the characters through puberty. There's more focus on the relationships, with romance brewing between Caitlin and Joey, and episodes about interracial dating, dating a senior, and the tension between teen parents. Stephanie is gone, Spike's given birth, Kathleen is still a prude, and there's the addition of the funniest character I've forgotten about over the years; Arnold's cousin. The most significant story arc in this season concerns the death of Wheel's parents, which was inspired by the death of the actor's real life father, and it's dealt with a much more grittier tone than the previous seasons. (Compare it to the bout of depression Stephanie suffered in season two.) I reckon the performance is still as powerful as anything you'd see today. This set has a great behind-the-scenes feature that really highlights the impact of the show and will really open your eyes about how convincing the realism was seen during its day.  All in all, a great season and a nice lead in to what will be the much darker and serious, Degrassi High series.

909652,A1OB1H0LB2ZGSJ,B0009OL934,"Kelly ""Kelly""","[0, 2]",This DVD was finally relesed in Australia over a week ago. Season 3 was a great season. Wheels parents die in a car crash in the first two episodes. After they forbid him to hang out with Joey Jeremiah his best friend. Throughout season 3 Wheels struggles to accept his parents deaths which is understandle no one could blame Wheels for the way he feels. All though how he acted out in Degrassi High was unacceptable. Spike had her baby over the summer a beautiful baby girl named Emma who you can see know in Degrassi Next Generation going to Degrassi herself. Joey remains very committed to the Zit Remedy. His blossoming romance with Caitlin is one of the the highlights of season 3.  Melanie's and Kathleens friendship starts to go under strain when Kathleen becomes vice president and when Kathleen gets anorexia. They become friends again at the end of the season when Allison tries to attract Snake away from Melanie. Melanie also steals $20 from her mum to go on a date with Snake. Shane takes acid at a concert. The twins switch places when Cluch asks Heather out who Erika likes. Lucy acts grown up this season. First she has Paul as a boyfriend then Clutch. Arthurs and Yick's friendship is also under strain when Arthurs mum wins the lottery. Simon and Alexa break up early in the season but then get back together. Michelle and BLT start going out desprite her parents disappoval because BLT is black. Snake finds out his brother Glen is gay. In Australia we have a different cover Joey and Caitlin are on the front. Also we had two discs instead of 3. And no special features. But this DVD is great anyway.,5,Great TV Series,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,1620,"['DVD', 'was', 'finally', 'relesed', 'Australia', 'week', 'ago', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'Wheels', 'parents', 'die', 'car', 'crash', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'forbid', 'hang', 'out', 'Joey', 'Jeremiah', 'best', 'friend', 'Throughout', 'season', '3', 'Wheels', 'struggles', 'accept', 'parents', 'deaths', 'understandle', 'one', 'could', 'blame', 'Wheels', 'way', 'how', 'acted', 'out', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'was', 'unacceptable', 'Spike', 'had', 'baby', 'summer', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'girl', 'named', 'Emma', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'know', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'going', 'Degrassi', 'Joey', 'very', 'committed', 'Zit', 'Remedy', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Caitlin', 'one', 'highlights', 'season', '3', 'Melanie', 'Kathleens', 'friendship', 'go', 'strain', 'when', 'Kathleen', 'vice', 'president', 'when', 'Kathleen', 'anorexia', 'become', 'friends', 'again', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'Allison', 'attract', 'Snake', 'away', 'Melanie', 'Melanie', 'also', '20', 'mum', 'go', 'date', 'Snake', 'Shane', 'acid', 'concert', 'twins', 'switch', 'places', 'when', 'Cluch', 'Heather', 'out', 'who', 'Erika', 'Lucy', 'grown', 'up', 'season', 'First', 'Paul', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'Clutch', 'Arthurs', 'Yick', 'friendship', 'also', 'strain', 'when', 'Arthurs', 'mum', 'lottery', 'Simon', 'Alexa', 'break', 'up', 'early', 'season', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Michelle', 'BLT', 'start', 'going', 'desprite', 'parents', 'disappoval', 'BLT', 'black', 'Snake', 'out', 'brother', 'Glen', 'gay', 'Australia', 'have', 'different', 'cover', 'Joey', 'Caitlin', 'are', 'front', 'Also', 'had', 'two', 'discs', 'instead', '3', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'great', 'anyway']",Degrassi Junior High - Season 3
909653,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B0009OL934,Kevin Caffrey,"[1, 2]","The first season of ""Degrassi Junior High"" often came very close to feeling like public access, with a miniscule (at best) budget and often very wooden/weird acting. A true guilty pleasure. From a technical standpoint, Season Two was a big improvement. New topics tackled included depression, divorce/remarriage, and sex. The teen actors clearly developed their talents and come off more believable as they did in Season 1. The camerawork and direction also improved.Season Three is something of an anomaly.  With two seasons under their belt, you would've thought the people behind the scenes (directors, writers, editors, etc.) would have improved by Season Three -- yet be on the lookout for some major editing gaffes, continuity errors, and just plain weirdness (the huge sweat stains on the math teacher's shirt in a few episodes come to mind...the directors must've come to their senses when they put him in blazers in later episodes).Yet, there are many powerful moments in Season Three.  Wheels' losing his parents in a drunk driving accident and the aftermath of the event are well done.  An episode about eating disorders is also good.  The acting from the young cast also is an improvement over seasons 1 & 2.  Pat M. as Joey Jeremiah is especially good.  The DVD set comes with teaching supplements that would be helpful for any jr.high/hs teachers that are thinking of showing episodes in class. There's also a short ""behind the scenes"" special which is interesting.Like the first two season collections, you can't go wrong with this DVD. You'll appreciate its honest portrayal of 12-15 year olds, but find much to laugh at in terms of the production values and overall 80s nostalgia.
