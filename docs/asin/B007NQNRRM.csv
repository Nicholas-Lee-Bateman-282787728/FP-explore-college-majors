1535033,A2OTZHOJJM4ZKR,B007NQNRRM,A. Wellman,"[5, 16]","Last week I posted a ""review"" pointing out that since this DVD would not be released for another two-and-a-half weeks, the ""reviews"" that ostensibly ""rated"" this DVD at five stars were, in fact, not reviews of the DVD at all, but merely reviews of the Los Angeles Kings.  Yet for some reason, my ""review"" (which wasn't any more of a review than any of the other reviews seen here) was deleted.  Why?  Nobody else who has ""reviewed"" this DVD owns this DVD; nobody else who has ""reviewed"" this DVD has actually watched the contents of this DVD, and nobody who has actually ""reviewed"" this DVD has any idea what bonus features will be included on this DVD.If the issue was that I ""skewed"" the so-called ""five-star rating"" that this DVD supposedly had received by giving it only one star, then fine, I'll give it a five-star rating too.  What difference does it make, anyway?  Any rating that I--or anybody--give this DVD, prior to the July 17, 2012 release date, is worthless.",5,This is neither a review nor a five-star rating,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,973,"['Last', 'week', 'posted', 'review', 'pointing', 'out', 'DVD', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'two-and-a-half', 'weeks', 'reviews', 'ostensibly', 'rated', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'were', 'fact', 'not', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'merely', 'reviews', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Kings', 'reason', 'review', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'review', 'other', 'reviews', 'seen', 'here', 'was', 'deleted', 'Why', 'Nobody', 'else', 'who', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'nobody', 'else', 'who', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'actually', 'watched', 'contents', 'DVD', 'nobody', 'who', 'actually', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'idea', 'what', 'bonus', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'DVD.If', 'issue', 'was', 'skewed', 'so-called', 'five-star', 'rating', 'DVD', 'supposedly', 'had', 'received', 'giving', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'then', 'fine', ""'ll"", 'give', 'five-star', 'rating', 'too', 'What', 'difference', 'make', 'anyway', 'Any', 'rating', 'anybody', 'give', 'DVD', 'prior', 'July', '17', '2012', 'release', 'date', 'worthless']",N/A

It starts with a little History, first the Kings were Part of the 1967 Expansion that doubled the size of the NHL. We are shown our Early Superstars such as Rogie Vachon and the Triple crown Line, which included Marcel Dionne, Charley Simmer and Dave Taylor. Then we move up to the Gretzky Era and center on that 1993 Stanley Cup Run where they Kings played an exciting and excellent semi finals against Toronto winning in seven and unfortunately falling short in the finals against the Montreal Canadians. The we are show this team and a little bit of how it was built from within. How this team had great hopes before the season but with a very tough early session that resulted in the Firing of the Coach Terry Murray and bringing in Darryl Sutter to replace him, it was a big key to the season. We also see how the Kings' brought up two keys players (King and Nolan) both big hard nose layers and made a trade for Jeff Carter who was another important key. Along with Brown, Quick and Kopitar and the rest, the Kings were ready to Rock. The Kings went on a great run and made the playoffs, getting the last playoff spot in the western conference. The we are taken along on a wonderful ride through the playoffs, all, the highlights are there. First the first seed the Vancouver Canucks Kings won 4 games to 1; then the St Louis blues the second seed and the Kings win 4 games to 0, Then the Phoenix Coyotes the Kings won 4 games to 1 and Finally the Cup Finals with New Jersey Devils and the Kings win 4 games to 2. Its really well done and it ends with Bob Miller the Kings announcer for 39 years calling the end of the game including saying ""After 45 years the Kings can were there Crowns.""The Extras include Because its the cup which are adds about the Stanley Cup Playoffs an there very cool, funny or inspirational. The NHL network interviews including Doughty, SCUDERI, Richards, Carter, Kopitar, Bob Miller (with a recap of the Miracle on Manchester the 5 goal come from behind playoff win VS the Edmonton Oilier's as well) Quick and more.  Behind the scene with the Cup, The top 10 Kings Highlights which are fantastic and a must see, And Extended Locker room coverage. And an NHL end of season roll out. Its a must have for every KINGS fan.",5,FANTASTIC!!!,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2364,"['have', 'been', 'Kings', 'fan', 'close', '40', 'years', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'little', 'History', 'first', 'Kings', 'were', 'Part', '1967', 'Expansion', 'doubled', 'size', 'NHL', 'are', 'shown', 'Early', 'Superstars', 'such', 'Rogie', 'Vachon', 'Triple', 'crown', 'Line', 'included', 'Marcel', 'Dionne', 'Charley', 'Simmer', 'Dave', 'Taylor', 'Then', 'move', 'up', 'Gretzky', 'Era', 'center', '1993', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'Run', 'where', 'Kings', 'played', 'exciting', 'excellent', 'semi', 'finals', 'Toronto', 'winning', 'seven', 'unfortunately', 'falling', 'short', 'finals', 'Montreal', 'Canadians', 'are', 'show', 'team', 'little', 'bit', 'how', 'was', 'built', 'How', 'team', 'had', 'great', 'hopes', 'season', 'very', 'tough', 'early', 'session', 'resulted', 'Firing', 'Coach', 'Terry', 'Murray', 'bringing', 'Darryl', 'Sutter', 'replace', 'was', 'big', 'key', 'season', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Kings', 'brought', 'up', 'two', 'keys', 'players', 'King', 'Nolan', 'big', 'hard', 'nose', 'layers', 'made', 'trade', 'Jeff', 'Carter', 'who', 'was', 'important', 'key', 'Brown', 'Quick', 'Kopitar', 'rest', 'Kings', 'were', 'ready', 'Rock', 'Kings', 'went', 'great', 'run', 'made', 'playoffs', 'getting', 'last', 'playoff', 'spot', 'western', 'conference', 'are', 'taken', 'along', 'wonderful', 'ride', 'playoffs', 'highlights', 'are', 'there', 'First', 'first', 'seed', 'Vancouver', 'Canucks', 'Kings', 'won', '4', 'games', '1', 'then', 'St', 'Louis', 'second', 'seed', 'Kings', 'win', '4', 'games', '0', 'Then', 'Phoenix', 'Coyotes', 'Kings', 'won', '4', 'games', '1', 'Finally', 'Cup', 'Finals', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Devils', 'Kings', 'win', '4', 'games', '2', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'Bob', 'Miller', 'Kings', 'announcer', '39', 'years', 'calling', 'end', 'game', 'including', 'saying', '45', 'years', 'Kings', 'can', 'were', 'there', 'Crowns', 'Extras', 'include', 'cup', 'are', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'Playoffs', 'there', 'very', 'cool', 'funny', 'inspirational', 'NHL', 'network', 'interviews', 'including', 'Doughty', 'SCUDERI', 'Richards', 'Carter', 'Kopitar', 'Bob', 'Miller', 'recap', 'Miracle', 'Manchester', '5', 'goal', 'come', 'playoff', 'win', 'VS', 'Edmonton', 'Oilier', 'as', 'well', 'Quick', 'more', 'scene', 'Cup', 'top', '10', 'Kings', 'Highlights', 'are', 'fantastic', 'must', 'see', 'Extended', 'Locker', 'room', 'coverage', 'NHL', 'end', 'season', 'roll', 'out', 'must', 'have', 'KINGS', 'fan']",N/A
