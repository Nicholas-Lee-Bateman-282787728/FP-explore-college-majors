But only the films themselves were the special editions, they had very lackluster and bland menus and lacked chapter selection menus. But other than that, the two full films are very good films and the extra footage are included that makes this a good set to own.The animated film in between I would have to say is not really worth it. First of all, it's short. The term ""Trilogy"" is kind of misleading because you think this is another feature film, but it's more like a short film than an actual feature film. It's only about half an hour long and features just one isolated incident that doesn't really tie itself or affect the main plots of either full-length feature films. More like a side story. I thought that it would talk about how they got separated and how the ending of Pitch Black where they leave together turned out to them scattered throughout the galaxy and how the grudge between some of them ignited, but it turns out this short animated film shows none of that. And to be honest, the animation style itself is not that great. It is like the kind of animation from the old MTV Aeon Flux cartoon, which I never liked anyhow.Overall, the set is a pretty good value as buying the two Special Edition Director's Cut feature films separately would probably cost more and would take up more room in your collection, but don't have too high of expectations to see something new in the Dark Fury animated short. Personally, I would have paid a little more if this included the game Escape from Butcher Bay because that was a much better addition to the series than Dark Fury.

""Dark Fury"" is an animation piece which I won't comment on.""Pitch Black"" uses the standard SF plot of crash-survivors battling for their lives against hostile alien life forms. Vin Diesel, as a convict and murderer, adds another dimension to the story though. The production also adds some fresh twists and great effects. This is VERY good stuff despite the familiar theme.The gem in this collection is ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". This is imaginative 'space opera' at its finest. The production is lavish with detailed and overwhelming sets of mysterious deities. The dark plot is driven by otherworldly religious fanaticism, ugly politics, human greed and Riddicks revenge. There's lots of action here but thought provoking grist as well. The movie stands out as some of the very best SF ever made.Both movies are the Directors Cuts and are burned on a separate disk.

We get Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick, and The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, a short animated film.  But will all of the movies and all of the extras, we are still missing the half-hour promotion feature where we see Riddick's past.  Originally he was a government assassin who was trained a bit too well.  When the government was done with him they tried to eliminate him.  Riddick survived and trumped up charges were invented sending him on the run.  But that original story is missing from this collection.Pitch Black.  Riddick is one of a handful of survivors who crash on a bright and arid world.  But once in a while, the three suns are completely blocked and true darkness covers the land.  It is in this darkness that the remaining life on the planet comes out of hiding and goes hunting.  Riddick must fight the dark, hold tr group together, and somehow escape the planet.Dark Fury.  Having escaped at the end of the first movie, Riddick and company are picked up by a bounty hunter who has a different idea of what to do with dangerous men.  Now Riddick is faced with killers, monsters, and a captain who seems to worship the skill of killing and survival.  This film is short and animated but uses the voices of actors from the other movies.The Chronicles of Riddick.  Here old acquaintances try to enlist Riddick's help in stopping a force known as the Necromongers.  It is their sworn duty to purge the flawed life of our universe so that they can be born in perfection in the underverse.  This time Riddick is faced with his past, unstoppable armies, weapons of mass destruction and possibly the fate of the whole world.A nice collection of some interesting films.  Packed in a nice small package this is not just a bundle but an original collection.  Plenty of action and tough guys for any appetite.  See the full range of the Richard P.

I hope the rumor is true regarding a new movie to add to this series. The original actors were the voice actors for the Dark Fury animation, which made it even better.

If you like classic, sullen, doesn't talk a lot Vin Diesel, Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick are the movies for you. They are both science fiction, outer space movies. Pitch black is really dark- it's sort of a horror movie  but not really- sort of scary but not really- maybe because some of the characters that meet an untimely end aren't that nice to start with. The Chronicles of Riddick is dark too, but has a much more involved story line- lots of action- not a happily ever after ending.

977493,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000EQHXN2,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","This two disc set from Universal gives us the Riddick trilogy of films so far produced starring Vin Diesel in the title role:Pitch Black(Feb/200),Dark Fury,animated(June/04) and The Chronicles of Riddick(June/04).Pitch Black contains about 13 minutes of extra footage while Chronicles gives us an extra 15 minutes.Pitch Black is an uneven story about a cargo ship on its' way to port.Its crew are all in stasis when an unexpected storm of meteorites penetrates the hull,killing some of the crew and compromising the hull's integrity.The crew is automatically brought out of their sleep but the ship is perilously close to a planet and they end up crash landing on it.Aboard the ship is a Merc(mercenary or bounty hunter)and his prisoner is one Richard Riddick.Riddick is wanted in several systems and he has a frightfully bad rep.After the crash he escapes while the rest of the survivors do what they can to consolidate supplies.Everyone is one edge wondering if Riddick will strike as they go about their work on the hostile desert planet.The sun seemingly never sets and water is their first priority.While digging one of the survivors finds a hole and investigates.His screams are heard and Riddick is seen at the scene but flees.No body is found and a further investigation in the hole finds caverns inhabited by some unknown creatures that were the actual cause of the passengers terrible demise.On a walkabout they discover a geological encampment that is 22 years old.Along the way they also stir up some of the creatures that were discovered in the cave.As things start to escalate and more people fall victim to these creatures the skies start to darken and eventually a long night arrives.This of course is the creatures cue to arise from their slumber in the caverns below and fly about the surface looking for prey.The survivors had found a ship at the gelogical encampment but the only way to get off the planet is to return there with fuel canisters.They do this but this time in the dark and more are lost along the way.In the end only Riddick,a holy Muslim on a pilgrimage to the second Mecca and a young girl survive the ordeal and escape.This film was uneven in its' original form but the extra footage alleviates this a little,just a little.The film sets up a kind of stop and start routine throughout,sidetracked more often than not  by the constant internal squabbling of the survivors.I give this version 3 1/2 stars as opposed to the original version's 3 stars.Dark Fury was released around the same time as Chronicles and is a 35 minute anime' starring the original voices from Pitch Black and Chronicles.It is a bridge between the two movies and it manages to tell a very interesting story in that short amount of time.It concerns a collector of beings;beings with the most ruthless reputations in the galaxy.The collectors' ship is a virtual museum piece of displayed frozen entities.Continuing with the last moments of Pitch Black as the girl,the holy man and Riddick are leaving the desert planet,here they get captured by the collector.There is an initial struggle but Riddick and his charges succumb to her forces.She wants to see exactly how Riddick fights/kills before she freezes him so she puts him into a ring with two deadly floating aliens.In the end he wins the day and the three struggle free from her clutches and escape.She unfreezes a bounty hunter whom she sends after them and this hunter will be seen in Chronicles at the very beginning.The anime' is very well done and directed by Peter Chung.It has a compelling story and the use of the original voices for each part enhances it greatly.I give it a solid 4 stars.Chronciles of Riddick begins with Riddick being chased down by the bounty hunter from Dark Fury on an ice planet,whom he manages to escape from and head to a planet called Helion Prime.Here he seeks out the holy man only to arrive just as the race known as Necromongers arrive.Its leader is a half dead dictator who plans to take over world after world.If they don't submit and convert they are killed.Riddick is eventually taken prisoner by them but escapes only to be caught by the bounty hunter he eluded on the ice planet.He is taken to Crematoria whose surface temperature during the day disintegrates anything living in a matter of seconds.The ""slam""/prison there is about 30 K's below the surface.It's a deadly place full of the most despicable criminals anywhere and who should he run into but the girl he escaped with from the desert planet in Pitch Black,now all grown up.At the right moment Riddick,the girl and some other of the inmates escape overland to a hangar where an escape craft is located.It's a race against the approaching heat of the rising sun and the prison guards who also want to escape.When they arrive some Necromongers are there to try and foil everyone's plans.The Necromongers capture the girl and Riddick barely escapes with his life.He is saved by a Necromonger who stays behind.It seems Riddick isn't the only Furyan left as the Necrmonger reveals his origin is the same as his.With nothing left to return to the Necromonger walks out into the heat of the day,committing suicide.Riddick returns to Helion Prime and confronts the leader of the Necromongers in order to gain the girl's freedom,who it seems has already been ""converted"".It's a fight to the death but Riddick comes through in an epic battle but loses the girl in the process.The ending has Riddick sitting on the throne full of grief and very fatigued,slowly looking up and realizing the entire Necromonger army is at his command,and saying""You keep what you kill"".Epic is the word I would use to describe this last movie of the trilogy.Everything seems to flow well throughout this film and we learn alot about Riddick and how he came to be the person he is.There are side plots here of the Elemental who has predicted Riddicks return and that of a subordinate of the head Nercomonger who's wife would like nothing more than to obtain ultimate power for her husband and thusly herself.And it's all on a grand scale where the special effects are top notch and help to enhance the movie all the way.I give it 4 1/2 stars.Technically the movies are all transferred very well and all are in their delightful widescreen format.The special features in Pitch Black are The Johns Chase Log,Feature Commentary with Vin Diesel, Cole Hauser and Director David Twohy,Feature Commentary with Director David Twohy, Producer Tom Engleman and Visual Effects Supervisor Peter Chiang,featurettes The Making of Pitch Black,Dark Fury: Advancing the Arc,The Chronicles of Riddick Visual Encyclopedia,and A View Into the Dark.In Dark Fury they are From Pitch Black to The Chronicles of Riddick: Bridging the Gap,Peter Chung - The Mind of an Animator,and Into the Light.In Chronicles of Riddick the extras are Deleted Scenes,Virtual Guide to The Chronicles of Riddick,Toomb's Chase Log,Riddick Insider,Visual Effects Revealed,Vin Diesel's Guided Tour,Interactive 360 View of the Sets,and Audio Commentary with Writer/Director David Twohy and Actors Karl Urban & Alex Davalos.If you enjoyed the Riddick films like I did then you will definitely enjoy these special director cut versions with extended footage in Dark Fury and Chronicles.Dark Fury was always the weakest of the two(playing more like a poor man's Alien)but Chronicles more than makes up for the formers weaknesses.Dark Fury is a wonderful story bridge in anime' with a very appealing plot and the original voices along to give an authentic aura about it.All in all a must have for the Riddick fans in your family.",4,Riddick done right!,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,7615,"['two', 'disc', 'set', 'Universal', 'Riddick', 'trilogy', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'produced', 'starring', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'title',

Anything that helped in understanding these five essential elements of the Riddick Trilogy were greatly appreciated.  The rest was just...entertaining.I watched and read The Chronicles of Riddick (III) before watching Pitch Black, although I had read the book Pitch Black.  The Chronicles was a better film than Pitch Black, but I know Pitch Black helped make sense of some of The Chronicles.  There were a number of ah-ha moments... Riddick's relationship with the Imam and ""Jack"", why he is on the run, ""Jack's"" statements that were repeats of what she learned and heard in Pitch Black, and more.Dark Fury is an animated short that really does a number of neat, but non-essential things:  introduces Toombs the merc, demonstrates Riddick's fighting abilities, and explains the tightness of him, Imam, and Jack.The Chronicles of Riddick (III) was great.  As I mentioned, the concept of and cinematography ""on"" Crematoria was worth the price of the movie.There's what is missing.  We really need to know more about the pre-Pitch Black portion of Riddick's life.  What was Furya really like... a futurist Sparta?  And then, given that Riddick got to ""keep what he kills,"" what does he do with the Necros when he becomes Lord Marshall?

977500,AE4JNORCLW8F6,B000EQHXN2,Sasha,"[2, 2]","To appreciate the Riddick experience, I do suggest obtaining the trilogy. Everything from Pitch Black is well-transitioned to The Chronicles by the animated Dark Fury. The film is a very detail-oriented sci-fi experience. The story is complex, which makes the plot execution unusual for this genre. The action in the films is not what you'd expect, though the special effects are spectacular. Character development is highlighted over action, so there is a dramatic element not typical of a sci-fi action adventure.Most sci-fi adventures have a 'loud' effect as far as action is concerned. The Riddick series approaches its action sequences 'quietly,' so be ready for something different. For a fantasy, the story proceeds 'realistically.' A solid series, the films are very well-developed. As sci-fi goes, this isn't at the top of the list. I watched the films in increments, stopping for days even in the middle of the features.

Knight""","[32, 36]","Having already owned the three Riddick films on dvd, I stumbled upon this collection and discovered that it contained all three films in a nifty bundle.  So instead of having all three films in separate dvd cases, you get them all in one with this here.  I went ahead & purchased this and sold the three separate Riddick films that I had prior.  Afterall, what have I got to lose?Granted there are some missing effects from the menu screens (noticeably on COR) the movies themselves are all kept intact in high quality as seen in their originals (which is excellent), along with the full director's cut versions of both PB and CoR.  Some may be wondering why PB & Dark Fury are on the same disc this time around.  Well for one, Dark Fury's a short enough movie to fit onto the same disc as PB without sacrificing much of anything, it's actually better this way.  Now you won't have to switch inbetween disc to watch (granted you already owned both PB & DF prior, if not, please excuse this).  Afterall, PB and DF interlace with each other.  It would only make sense for them both to be on the same disc.  You definitely get alot for this collection's small retail price.  You're getting three films which could run you at $30.00+, for under twenty bucks. 400+ minutes of nonstop sci-fi action.All in all, to those of whom already own all three films, there really isn't anything new here to see with the exception of the gnarly dvd packaging, along with the films being in a single dvd case on two discs (no new features that weren't already found in the originals) as opposed to three. However, to those who don't already own the Riddick films (or to those who simply owned the prior films on vhs), now's your chance to PICK THIS UP!  The price alone justifies the purchase, and this collection serves as a great intermission into the Riddick universe.",4,Great bargain.
