It includes four short ballets, each in a different style and by a different composer, and all excellently performed. Unfortunately, it does not have the story of any of the ballets, which makes it hard to follow the action for anyone who is not already familiar with these ballets.

Especially notable is their joy of folk dancing in this DVD.  It captures the true spirit of dance, which is joy.  I can watch this over and over and never tire of the beautiful dancing of the Russians.  To me, the two jewels of this recording are the Firebird and Spectre de la Rose.  I imagine what Nijinsky must have looked like as the spirit of the rose.  The Russian man has amazing flexibility, which is only seen in male dances who start training young enough to develop it.  The choreography of this is brilliant, as is the choreography in the Firebird.  The firebird is a true animal spirit, which Nijinsky has captured in his ballet.

873936,A1K548TDR33DMN,B0006SSQ6Q,Anna Shlimovich,"[2, 4]","The main attraction of this DVD is Sheherazade and Polovtsian Dances - the ballets you will see less often than The Firebird and Le Spectre de la Rose.And the main feature of Sheherazade is a fabulous pas-de-deux of Sheherazade (Svetlana Zakharova) and the Golden Slave (Farukh Ruzimatov).  Those 15 minutes of their dance is really amazingly well-done; the sensuality of their dancing, expressed through flawless mastery of their movement, is astonishing.  Everything there was a perfection - the choreography of the pas-de-deux, the costumes, and even their skin color was so in line with a classical (painting) idea of beauty - she is pale-white and gracious, while he is darker and ; in short, they are here perfect expression of the idealised difference and harmony of sexes.  I also noticed that the camera behaved very well for this particular pas-de-deux, mercifully showing the whole bodies with their incredible sways, even keeping the feet in the view, without cutting them, as it does for the beginning and ending of this ballet.  It seems that the producers paid special attention to this jewel of a dance.Apart from that, even despite their glorious dancing, the music starts drilling into your mind with its incessant repetiton.  Sheherazade is the most famous Rimsky-Korsakov's tune, the melody, like Ravel's Bolero, is incredibly catching at the beginning, but after one thousand and one repetition one wants to cry out: ""Basta, basta, per pieta!""  ironically, this tune shows the limitation of this composer - and one can only compare him with a later entrant, Stravinsky, and hear the difference between a nice talent and an omnipotent genius.And other elements of this Sheherazade are rather naive, bordering on pantomime rather than ballet with dancing, and seem to be tailored for children audience.  The overall choreography is truly outdated, but still it is interesting to see from the historic standpoint.Polovtsian Dances are an amusing piece, with its exotic costumes and interesting design by Nicolai Roerich - the same artist who designed Le Sacre du Printemps for Ballets Russes.  Yet the former in choreography is much less than the latter, and speaking off music, it is probably below comment.  If Rimsky-Korsakov is a somewhat interesting composer, although not exceptionally good, then Borodin is at best a mediocre amateur.  But they, as part of The Five, or The Mighty Handful (Moguchaya kuchka), were popular since their day till today for their distinct ""Russian music"" - as opposed to Tchaikovsky or Scriabin, who were conspicuously cosmopolitan or Western in their style.  Listening to Sheherazade or Polovtsian Dances, one can appreciate the best of The Mighty Handful - Mussorgsky, a true genius and a former victim of Rimsky's arrangements.Two other ballets on this DVD are quite good, but they are in line with other productions of the same, so I will not rave about them.  They are well-done, La Spectre is always a crowd-pleaser with its pleasant (luckily short) suite music and polished lines.  The Firebird again is done according to the tradition and is danced and filmed well.  It is the most traditionally ""Russian"" ballet music of Stravinsky, closer to Rimsky and The Mighty Handful tradition than his any other piece (like Le Sacre, Pulcinella, maybe with the exception of Petrouchka).Overall, this DVD seems to lean distinctively into Russian exotics, except for Le Spectre de la Rose, which is short; with its four ballets, it provides a good insight into that special style of the Mighty Five and those who enjoy that kind of music would certainly love it.  I also think it is a very good assortment of ballets for children.",4,"The Mighty Four, or a delicious Russian stew.",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,3681,"['main', 'attraction', 'DVD', 'Sheherazade', 'Polovtsian', 'Dances', 'ballets', 'will', 'see', 'less', 'often', 'Firebird', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'la', 'Rose.And', 'main', 'feature', 'Sheherazade', 'fabulous', 'pas-de-deux', 'Sheherazade', 'Svetlana', 'Zakharova', 'Golden', 'Slave', 'Farukh', 'Ruzimatov', '15', 'minutes', 'dance', 'really', 'amazingly', 'well-done', 'sensuality', 'dancing', 'expressed', 'flawless', 'mastery', 'movement', 'astonishing', 'Everything', 'there', 'was', 'perfection', 'choreography', 'pas-de-deux', 'costumes', 'even', 'skin', 'color', 'was', 'so', 'line', 'classical', 'painting', 'idea', 'beauty', 'pale-white', 'gracious', 'darker', 'short', 'are', 'here', 'perfect', 'expression', 'idealised', 'difference', 'harmony', 'sexes', 'also', 'noticed', 'camera', 'behaved', 'very', 'well', 'particular', 'pas-de-deux', 'mercifully', 'showing', 'whole', 'bodies', 'incredible', 'sways', 'even', 'keeping', 'feet', 'view', 'cutting', 'beginning', 'ending', 'ballet', 'producers', 'paid', 'special', 'attention', 'jewel', 'dance.Apart', 'even', 'glorious', 'dancing', 'music', 'drilling', 'mind', 'incessant', 'repetiton', 'Sheherazade', 'most', 'famous', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'tune', 'melody', 'Ravel', 'Bolero', 'incredibly', 'catching', 'beginning', 'one', 'thousand', 'one', 'repetition', 'one', 'cry', 'out', 'Basta', 'basta', 'pieta', 'ironically', 'tune', 'limitation', 'composer', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'compare', 'later', 'entrant', 'Stravinsky', 'hear', 'difference', 'nice', 'talent', 'omnipotent', 'genius.And', 'other', 'elements', 'Sheherazade', 'are', 'rather', 'naive', 'bordering', 'pantomime', 'rather', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'seem', 'be', 'tailored', 'children', 'audience', 'overall', 'choreography', 'truly', 'outdated', 'still', 'interesting', 'see', 'historic', 'standpoint.Polovtsian', 'Dances', 'are', 'amusing', 'piece', 'exotic', 'costumes', 'interesting', 'design', 'Nicolai', 'Roerich', 'same', 'artist', 'who', 'designed', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'former', 'choreography', 'much', 'less', 'latter', 'speaking', 'off', 'music', 'probably', 'below', 'comment', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'composer', 'not', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'then', 'Borodin', 'best', 'mediocre', 'amateur', 'part', 'Five', 'Mighty', 'Handful', 'Moguchaya', 'kuchka', 'were', 'popular', 'day', 'till', 'today', 'distinct', 'Russian', 'music', 'opposed', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Scriabin', 'who', 'were', 'conspicuously', 'cosmopolitan', 'Western', 'style', 'Listening', 'Sheherazade', 'Polovtsian', 'Dances', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'best', 'Mighty', 'Handful', 'Mussorgsky', 'true', 'genius', 'former', 'victim', 'Rimsky', 'arrangements.Two', 'other', 'ballets', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'line', 'other', 'productions', 'same', 'will', 'not', 'rave', 'are', 'well-done', 'La', 'Spectre', 'always', 'crowd-pleaser', 'pleasant', 'luckily', 'short', 'suite', 'music', 'polished', 'lines', 'Firebird', 'again', 'done', 'according', 'tradition', 'danced', 'filmed', 'well', 'most', 'traditionally', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'music', 'Stravinsky', 'closer', 'Rimsky', 'Mighty', 'Handful', 'tradition', 'other', 'piece', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'Pulcinella', 'maybe', 'exception', 'Petrouchka', '.Overall', 'DVD', 'lean', 'distinctively', 'Russian', 'exotics', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'de', 'la', 'Rose', 'short', 'four', 'ballets', 'good', 'insight', 'special', 'style', 'Mighty', 'Five', 'who', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'music', 'would', 'certainly', 'love', 'also', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'assortment', 'ballets', 'children']",N/A

Even though we only watched the first two performances (which was all we could tolerate in a single sitting), Sheherazade and La Spectre de la Rosa, it was enough to sufficiently season this review.The anorexic leading lady in Sheherazade looked more eel-like than human, let alone female.  Yikes!  As for her dance with the ""golden slave,"" I felt it was way too protracted, busy and, well, bordering on the boring.  The choreography leaned more toward that of American Modern Dance than ballet, and was needlessly busy, flailing and lacking the classic curvature, grace and strength that I expect from something billing itself as ""ballet.""La Spectre de la Rosa was utterly and painfully disappointing.  The male lead projected more femininity than did--nor indeed could--the female lead, and their dance went on completely bereft of any male/female complimentarity, especially masculine strength (from the male) and feminine grace (from the female).  It may have worked better with a female given the part of the rose, or with a male who was capable of exuding at least a modicum of masculinity.Yikes!  It looks as though the amorphous, transgendered plight of western society has finally caught up with, and wrecked, classical dance.

873942,A32ASMR822BFSE,B0006SSQ6Q,"Richard Rawls ""Richard Ardle Rawls""","[2, 3]","If you only ordered this DVD to get ""Firebird"", you would get your money's worth. However, the other three ballets are bonuses worthy of your time and money also. The ballets on this disc, in the order they appear in the program are: Sheherazade,w/music of Rimsky-Korsakov, Le Spectre de La Rose w/music of Carl Maria Von Weber, Polovtsian Dances, w/music of Alexander Borodin, and Firebird, w/music of Igor Stravinsky. All of the music is spectacular, but Firebird is a cut above.Diana Vishneva is a fabulous Firebird, with great jumping and turning ability, typical of the Russian ballerinas, and her partner Andrei Yakovlev, is very good also, but his dancing is limited to supporting his partner. Besides, he would have had trouble dancing in the costume they had him in. I think that if he had grasped a real bird by the tail-feathers as he did his Firebird, she would have just pulled out her tail-feathers as she struggled to get away. I caught a little bird once on my enclosed porch, (I was afraid it would break it's neck flying into the windows), so I held it by it's tail-feathers as I was trying to release it, and it pulled ALL it's tail-feathers out as it struggled to get away. It was able to fly w/o It's tail-feathers, however. Our Firebird did not pull out her tail-feathers until she was ready to give one to her captor in exchange for her release. A very magical feather it is too, for when our hero is about to be turned into stone by the magic of the evil sorcerer Kotchei (sometimes spelled Kashchey), he uses it to call the Firebird to his rescue. Some of you have never seen this ballet, (I had not when I first bought it) so, take the plunge and get it to view over and over. If you really love FIREBIRD, for heavens sake, get the Royal Ballet version also, w/Leanne Benjamin....Stravinsky - The Firebird & Les Noces / Royal Ballet....It's even better than this one (IMO). Read my review on it.The best thing about Sheherazade is it's music. The story concerns an orgy, plain and simple. Of course, this is an orgy your children can watch. An Arabian Sultan, Shakhriar, has a harem, and I suppose his favorite concubine is Zabeida, whom he suspects is unfaithful to him. So, he fakes a hunting trip and goes off leaving his harem to the safe keeping of a comical eunuch, who is tricked into giving up the keys of the harem to the concubines, who in turn unlock the doors to allow their lovers inside to.....well you know what. The Sultan returns to find the orgy, and kills everyone. But, to hear the beautiful music you have to put up with a 20 to 30 murders, and one suicide. Not too much to ask, is it?Le Spectre de La Rose is the story of a girl who dreams. She falls asleep with a rose in her hand, and dreams of a ghost who enters through a window looking all rose colored, and dances with her until she awakens, then he jumps through the window through which he entered. The music is Von Weber's, ""Invitation to the Dance"", which is his claim to fame. The story is believable, because remember, the only entertainment in years past was dancing and other musical galas, so she could have gone to a dance and dreamed about it later. It's a very nice short ballet.Polovtsian Dances includes a vocal by a Russian speaking chorus of very good voices. Of course a ballet is the main feature, with music by Borodin. The beautiful music inspired the once popular song ""Stranger in Paradise"", back when songs used to make sense. This is also a short ballet worth having. For pure listening pleasure, this is as good as music gets. It's right up there with Tchaikovsky for me.Hey, would you be interested in hearing another fabulous Russian chorus? Buy the opera SADKO by Rimsky-Korsakov. It has an aria by a tenor that is so utterly  beautiful you might cry when you hear it. It's called THE SONG OF INDIA sung by ""the indian guest"". The dancing girls he brings with him aren't hard to look at either.....Rimsky-Korsakov - Sadko / Vladimir Galouzine, Gegam Grigorian, Sergei Alexashkin, Larissa Diadkova, Nikolai Putilin, Valery Gergiev, Kirov Opera",5,A common man's point of view.,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,4074,"['only', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'get', 'Firebird', 'would', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'However', 'other', 'three', 'ballets', 'are', 'worthy', 'time', 'money', 'also', 'ballets', 'disc', 'order', 'appear', 'program', 'are', 'Sheherazade', 'w/music', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'de', 'La', 'Rose', 'w/music', 'Carl', 'Maria', 'Von', 'Weber', 'Polovtsian', 'Dances', 'w/music', 'Alexander', 'Borodin', 'Firebird', 'w/music', 'Igor', 'Stravinsky', 'music', 'spectacular', 'Firebird', 'cut', 'above.Diana', 'Vishneva', 'fabulous', 'Firebird', 'great', 'jumping', 'turning', 'ability', 'typical', 'Russian', 'ballerinas', 'partner', 'Andrei', 'Yakovlev', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'dancing', 'limited', 'supporting', 'partner', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'dancing', 'costume', 'had', 'think', 'had', 'grasped', 'real', 'bird', 'tail-feathers', 'did', 'Firebird', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'pulled', 'out', 'tail-feathers', 'struggled', 'get', 'away', 'caught', 'little', 'bird', 'once', 'enclosed', 'porch', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'break', 'neck', 'flying', 'windows', 'so', 'held', 'tail-feathers', 'was', 'trying', 'release', 'pulled', 'ALL', 'tail-feathers', 'out', 'struggled', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'able', 'fly', 'tail-feathers', 'however', 'Firebird', 'did', 'not', 'pull', 'out', 'tail-feathers', 'was', 'ready', 'give', 'one', 'captor', 'exchange', 'release', 'very', 'magical', 'feather', 'too', 'when', 'hero', 'be', 'turned', 'stone', 'magic', 'evil', 'sorcerer', 'Kotchei', 'sometimes', 'spelled', 'Kashchey', 'call', 'Firebird', 'rescue', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'ballet', 'had', 'not', 'when', 'first', 'bought', 'so', 'take', 'plunge', 'get', 'view', 'over', 'really', 'love', 'FIREBIRD', 'heavens', 'sake', 'get', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'version', 'also', 'w/Leanne', 'Benjamin', '.Stravinsky', 'Firebird', 'Les', 'Noces', '/', 'Royal', 'Ballet', '.It', 'even', 'better', 'one', 'IMO', 'Read', 'review', 'it.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Sheherazade', 'music', 'story', 'concerns', 'orgy', 'plain', 'simple', 'course', 'orgy', 'children', 'can', 'watch', 'Arabian', 'Sultan', 'Shakhriar', 'harem', 'suppose', 'favorite', 'concubine', 'Zabeida', 'whom', 'unfaithful', 'So', 'hunting', 'trip', 'off', 'leaving', 'harem', 'safe', 'keeping', 'comical', 'eunuch', 'who', 'tricked', 'giving', 'up', 'keys', 'harem', 'concubines', 'who', 'turn', 'unlock', 'doors', 'allow', 'lovers', '..well', 'know', 'what', 'Sultan', 'returns', 'find', 'orgy', 'everyone', 'hear', 'beautiful', 'music', 'have', 'put', 'up', '20', '30', 'murders', 'one', 'suicide', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'de', 'La', 'Rose', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'asleep', 'rose', 'hand', 'dreams', 'ghost', 'who', 'window', 'looking', 'rose', 'colored', 'dances', 'then', 'window', 'entered', 'music', 'Von', 'Weber', 'Invitation', 'Dance', 'claim', 'fame', 'story', 'believable', 'remember', 'only', 'entertainment', 'years', 'was', 'dancing', 'other', 'musical', 'galas', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'dance', 'dreamed', 'later', 'very', 'nice', 'short', 'ballet.Polovtsian', 'Dances', 'vocal', 'Russian', 'speaking', 'chorus', 'very', 'good', 'voices', 'course', 'ballet', 'main', 'feature', 'music', 'Borodin', 'beautiful', 'music', 'inspired', 'once', 'popular', 'song', 'Stranger', 'Paradise', 'back', 'when', 'songs', 'used', 'make', 'sense', 'also', 'short', 'ballet', 'having', 'pure', 'listening', 'pleasure', 'as', 'good', 'music', 'right', 'there', 'Tchaikovsky', 'me.Hey', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'hearing', 'fabulous', 'Russian', 'chorus', 'Buy', 'opera', 'SADKO', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'aria', 'tenor', 'so', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'might', 'cry', 'when', 'hear', 'called', 'THE', 'SONG', 'OF', 'INDIA', 'sung', 'indian', 'guest', 'dancing', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard', 'look', '..Rimsky-Korsakov', 'Sadko', '/', 'Vladimir', 'Galouzine', 'Gegam', 'Grigorian', 'Sergei', 'Alexashkin', 'Larissa', 'Diadkova', 'Nikolai', 'Putilin', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', 'Kirov', 'Opera']",N/A
