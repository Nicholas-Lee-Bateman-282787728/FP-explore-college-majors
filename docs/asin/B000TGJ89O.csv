The DVD has over 70 minutes of material filmed in New York's Harry De Jur Playhouse on a stage featuring both a gigantic flower arrangement and a pile of trash.  Waters delivers a charmingly bizarre performance which touches on his childhood (he has a great relationship with his Catholic parents), his cinematic inspirations, his films and frequent collaborators (including Divine, Traci Lords, and Johnny Depp), and his own personal philosophies.The performance is never foul and always engaging, full of humorous vignettes.  Waters tells us about his father's reaction to one of his early films:  ""It was pretty funny.  But I hope to never see it again.""  He explains that even Divine had limits:  ""The first time he met Richard Simmons, he felt homophobic.""  Waters himself also has limits.  ""A drug that makes you love everyone?"" Waters says of Ecstasy. ""Sounds like hell to me.""  This DVD is sure to delight long-time fans as well as inspire some new ones to explore the extensive John Waters film catalog.",5,"Never foul, always intelligent and engaging",1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1232,"['John', 'Waters', 'been', 'honing', 'monologue', 'college', 'campuses', 'other', 'low-key', 'circuits', 'years', 'release', 'Filthy', 'World', 'DVD', 'too', 'can', 'view', 'pencil-mustached', 'director', 'living', 'room', 'DVD', 'over', '70', 'minutes', 'material', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'Harry', 'De', 'Jur', 'Playhouse', 'stage', 'featuring', 'gigantic', 'flower', 'arrangement', 'pile', 'trash', 'Waters', 'charmingly', 'bizarre', 'performance', 'childhood', 'great', 'relationship', 'Catholic', 'parents', 'cinematic', 'inspirations', 'films', 'frequent', 'collaborators', 'including', 'Divine', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'own', 'personal', 'philosophies.The', 'performance', 'never', 'foul', 'always', 'engaging', 'full', 'humorous', 'vignettes', 'Waters', 'father', 'reaction', 'one', 'early', 'films', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'hope', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'even', 'Divine', 'had', 'limits', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'felt', 'homophobic', 'also', 'limits', 'drug', 'love', 'everyone', 'Waters', 'Ecstasy', 'like', 'hell', 'DVD', 'sure', 'delight', 'long-time', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'inspire', 'new', 'ones', 'explore', 'extensive', 'John', 'Waters', 'film', 'catalog']",John Waters: This Filthy World

I do not think &#34;Pink Flamingos&#34; was the landmark film that everyone believes it to be. It was nothing more then a degenerate home film with transvestites, orifices, gays and fecal consumption. John Waters and his entourage engage in a lifestyle that I find deplorable. But I liked &#34;Serial Mom&#34; so much that I gave &#34;John Waters: This Filthy World&#34; a view and was completely surprised. It was very entertaining due to John Waters' almost &#34;innocent&#34; charm. I thought it was going to be a one man rant on stage about gay rights. But actually, it was a fun and informative monologue about a filmmaker's life, experience and dealings with people and situations throughout his career. What I liked about it was the natural, calm, homespun presentation. There seemed to be no real political agendas or issues he was trying to push. He's not trying to promote his lifestyle or judge anyone else. Waters is an appealing on stage story teller, weaving a mixture of Hollywood gossip, personal insight and humor in this one man show.

1089629,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000TGJ89O,MortensOrchid,"[3, 3]","I've always been a fan of John Waters.  He was indie before it was cool, and always had a sense of humor that I found hilarious.  You can sense it in his movies across the years.  Now that he's much older and wiser and his career has come full circle of being a misfit to that of being a ""filth elder"" (as he says), we can look back with him on his life story and find inspiration and delight in creating our own filthy things.I've had the privilage of seeing John Waters live in his theater tours a few years ago.  He is just as funny and entertaining then as he is now.  He has the whole audience in stitches, telling his tales of how weird people really are.  He tells the tales of his film inspirations, meeting his friends that would star in his indie to his mainstream movies, and encountering the myriad of oddities that have inspired him to create all that he has created.A word of criticism?  In the question and answer period, the audience doesn't ask the funniest possible questions.  Then again, there was no control over that factor.  Waters is not filthy, he produces witty and clever commentary on celebrities, trends and all the things in between.  I was remembering the funniest thing I think I have ever heard him say, when the last question of the night was when someone shouted ""Who's the filthiest person alive?!"".  Without pausing for a moment, he said ""Michael Jackson! Thank you, good night!"" and left the house roaring.",5,Oh what a filthy world it is,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,1444,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'John', 'Waters', 'was', 'indie', 'was', 'cool', 'always', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'found', 'hilarious', 'can', 'sense', 'movies', 'years', 'Now', 'much', 'older', 'wiser', 'career', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'being', 'misfit', 'being', 'filth', 'elder', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'life', 'story', 'find', 'inspiration', 'delight', 'creating', 'own', 'filthy', 'things.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'privilage', 'seeing', 'John', 'Waters', 'live', 'theater', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'then', 'now', 'whole', 'audience', 'stitches', 'telling', 'tales', 'how', 'weird', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'tales', 'film', 'inspirations', 'meeting', 'friends', 'would', 'star', 'indie', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'encountering', 'myriad', 'oddities', 'have', 'inspired', 'create', 'created.A', 'word', 'criticism', 'question', 'answer', 'period', 'audience', ""n't"", 'ask', 'funniest', 'possible', 'questions', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'control', 'factor', 'Waters', 'not', 'filthy', 'witty', 'clever', 'commentary', 'celebrities', 'trends', 'things', 'was', 'remembering', 'funniest', 'thing', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'say', 'when', 'last', 'question', 'night', 'was', 'when', 'someone', 'shouted', 'Who', 'filthiest', 'person', 'alive', 'pausing', 'moment', 'said', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thank', 'good', 'night', 'left', 'house', 'roaring']",John Waters: This Filthy World
