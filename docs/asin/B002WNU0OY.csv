The cd was a little confusing at first with what movie is on what side. I thought on the main menu they would give you a choice for the two movies, but no you have to flip the cd over. It would have been helpful if the cd said this.

I have since ordered the Wedding on a single DVD from a different provider.I was disappointed not to see Julia Stiles in the second one...the chemistry was not there (although it was good)the third, Honeymoon, was a bigger disappointment because Luke Mably was replaced:( That was like Robert Pattinson  being replaced in Twilight!

I watched Edvard's and Paige's face so many times. The acting was Emmy worthy. I was hoping for a continuation.  The chemistry was missing with Edvard and Paige. Luke Mably is a incredible actor to pull this one off, (The Royal Wedding).  Whoever did these sequels knew nothing of fan loyalty for the original actors, if they had, the trilogy would have been wonderful.  I was really let down.  I bought them without reading the reviews first.  The only thing I liked about the Royal Honeymoon was the actor who played Eddie bore a striking resemblance to the real Prince William.
