901048,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00094ARN2,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[4, 6]","This is a musical masterpiece; it is not a biography, but a surreal portrait that captures the essence of one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century. Bobby Darin was a man of extreme contrasts, a dynamo with ""a hot head and a weak heart,"" living on borrowed time, and making every minute count.There are song and dance sequences in this polished gem that are reminiscent of the great movie musicals from decades ago, blended into the dramatic story of Darin's life.Kevin Spacey was born to play Darin. Everything he has done in his immensely talented life has lead to this point. His age is irrelevant, all he needed was a little added to his nose for the transformation to be complete. He spent over five years on this project, to write, direct, and star in this fantastic tribute. Being a big Darin fan since the mid '60s, I was apprehensive about seeing this film, especially when I read that Spacey was singing, but he won me over in the first few minutes of the first scene. His singing is remarkable, and comes very close to the real thing, and the body language sometimes makes me think I'm watching Darin.The smartest thing Darin ever did was to keep those closest to him people he trusted from his early days, and in this film, Spacey has the finest of actors taking these parts.Kate Bosworth is marvelous as Sandra Dee, with a walk and subtle tilt of the head that is pure Dee, as well as being incredibly beautiful. John Goodman, Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn, Greta Scacchi, and Caroline Aaron are all superb, and special mention must be made of William Ulrich, the amazing youngster that plays ""Little Bobby Darin"" as a child, and an alter ego that follows him throughout the film.Shot on location in Berlin and London, the cinematography by Eduardo Sera is a marvel, and the choreography by Rob Ashford and the terrific dancers are a joy to watch. The extraordinary skill and brilliance of Spacey's direction and performance makes this film one I can view repeatedly with increased appreciation, and total running time is 118 minutes.The DVD extras are not to be missed, with a ""Making of"" piece, and some interesting producer/director commentary.",5,"""...he was born to play the part""",1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2169,"['musical', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'biography', 'surreal', 'portrait', 'essence', 'one', 'greatest', 'entertainers', '20th', 'century', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'was', 'man', 'extreme', 'contrasts', 'dynamo', 'hot', 'head', 'weak', 'heart', 'living', 'borrowed', 'time', 'making', 'minute', 'are', 'song', 'dance', 'sequences', 'polished', 'gem', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'great', 'movie', 'musicals', 'decades', 'ago', 'blended', 'dramatic', 'story', 'Darin', 'life.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Darin', 'Everything', 'done', 'immensely', 'talented', 'life', 'lead', 'point', 'age', 'irrelevant', 'all', 'needed', 'was', 'little', 'added', 'nose', 'transformation', 'be', 'complete', 'spent', 'five', 'years', 'project', 'write', 'direct', 'star', 'fantastic', 'tribute', 'Being', 'big', 'Darin', 'fan', 'mid', ""'60s"", 'was', 'apprehensive', 'seeing', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'read', 'Spacey', 'was', 'singing', 'won', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'first', 'scene', 'singing', 'remarkable', 'very', 'close', 'real', 'thing', 'body', 'language', 'sometimes', 'think', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Darin.The', 'smartest', 'thing', 'Darin', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'keep', 'closest', 'people', 'trusted', 'early', 'days', 'film', 'Spacey', 'finest', 'actors', 'taking', 'parts.Kate', 'Bosworth', 'marvelous', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'walk', 'subtle', 'tilt', 'head', 'pure', 'Dee', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Caroline', 'Aaron', 'are', 'superb', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'William', 'Ulrich', 'amazing', 'youngster', 'Little', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'child', 'alter', 'ego', 'film.Shot', 'location', 'Berlin', 'London', 'cinematography', 'Eduardo', 'Sera', 'marvel', 'choreography', 'Rob', 'Ashford', 'terrific', 'dancers', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'extraordinary', 'skill', 'brilliance', 'Spacey', 'direction', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'view', 'repeatedly', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'total', 'running', 'time', '118', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Making', 'piece', 'interesting', 'producer/director', 'commentary']",N/A

My reaction is that the film did have numerous flaws, and especially in the first half of the film it just didn't have ""it"", as character Polly described that intangible necessity of successful show business. The film meandered through several incoherent flash back/alternate reality episodes and several unnecesary musical extravaganza-type dance numbers which were just superfluous and out of place. However, I must say that the film got much better as it went along and the second half was very good. There are several beautiful scenes including the Darins' wedding night and the closing concert number when Bobby gives his farewell. The other good thing is that Kevin Spacey did all his own musical performances in this movie, and he sings and dances very well, especially his singing, which really does Bobby Darin justice. It's obvious from interviews Spacey has given that he is a big fan of Darin's, and his care and emotion for the legend are obvious in the film, which Spacey also directed and produced. Spacey had to get overseas financing for this film and it was shot in Germany, because Hollywood didn't think American audiences would pay to see a movie about a singer most people don't know about. I think that was a mistake, but instead of detracting from the quality of the film, I think like most European productions, the German production locations and crews were an advantage, and certainly the Las Vegas and California scenes look like they were shot in the U.S. (thanks to modern special effects). I recommend this movie. It's a loving tribute to Bobby Darin, a great singer and an entertainer who overcame impossible odds to succeed in show business. This movie also overcame long odds and Kevin Spacey must be given credit for persevering and finally getting it made.",4,"A good film about Bobby Darin, lovingly made by Spacey",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,1902,"['saw', 'movie', 'opening', 'weekend', 'Saturday', 'last', 'night', 'Loews', 'Lincoln', 'Square', 'Cinemas', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'reaction', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'numerous', 'flaws', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'character', 'Polly', 'described', 'intangible', 'necessity', 'successful', 'show', 'business', 'film', 'meandered', 'several', 'incoherent', 'flash', 'back/alternate', 'reality', 'episodes', 'several', 'unnecesary', 'musical', 'extravaganza-type', 'dance', 'numbers', 'were', 'just', 'superfluous', 'place', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'went', 'along', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'several', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'including', 'Darins', 'wedding', 'night', 'closing', 'concert', 'number', 'when', 'Bobby', 'farewell', 'other', 'good', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', 'own', 'musical', 'performances', 'movie', 'dances', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'singing', 'really', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'justice', 'obvious', 'interviews', 'Spacey', 'given', 'big', 'fan', 'Darin', 'care', 'emotion', 'legend', 'are', 'obvious', 'film', 'Spacey', 'also', 'directed', 'produced', 'Spacey', 'had', 'get', 'overseas', 'financing', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Germany', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'movie', 'singer', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'instead', 'detracting', 'quality', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'European', 'productions', 'German', 'production', 'locations', 'crews', 'were', 'advantage', 'certainly', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'California', 'scenes', 'look', 'were', 'shot', 'U.S.', 'thanks', 'modern', 'special', 'effects', 'recommend', 'movie', 'loving', 'tribute', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'great', 'singer', 'entertainer', 'who', 'overcame', 'impossible', 'odds', 'succeed', 'show', 'business', 'movie', 'also', 'overcame', 'long', 'odds', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'persevering', 'finally', 'getting', 'made']",N/A

Clearly no effort was made to make Spacey appear Darin's age, which I'm sure was intentional.

901054,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00094ARN2,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 6]","Kevin Spacey definitely carries this entire film on his very supportive back.  The film falls short in brilliance where a biopic is concerned but it excels in brilliance when entertaining the idea of a musical, a genre that is very hot or miss.  Spacey is infectious as he plays his real life idol Bobby Darin.  His moves are crisp and his voice is effortlessly beautiful to listen to.  The script though fails to truly uncover the man that was Bobby Darin.  We see his relationship with screen legend Sandra Dee, played by the beautiful Kate Bosworth, but we never really understand it.  The film seems to be more focused on telling the relationship between Darin's adult self and his child self, played by newcomer William Ullrich.Bosworth is notably fantastic as Sandra Dee though, her emotion fully invested in a character that is sadly left a little two-dimensional.  Bob Hoskins also shines; an actor who just continues to amaze me with every performance, each more poised and promising than the last, and here as Darin's brother-in-law he does a beautiful job juggling protective, compassionate and judgmental.  Caroline Aaron and the splendid Brenda Blethyn also illuminate their scenes, but no one is able to stop the tidal wave that is Kevin Spacey in full on shiny luminescent glory.The film, a dream project of Spacey's, follows Darin as he devotes himself to making a motion picture musical chronicling his life.  This I feel was done so that Spacey, an actor quite a bit older than Darin was in his prime, could justify starring in the film.  Darin in his older years is now starring as himself in his younger years in a film telling his life story.  I may have made it sound too complicated but it's not.  The set pieces are spectacular, the musical numbers are extraordinary and the acting as a whole is fulfilling and right on point.  The story telling itself though is a bit off.I recommend this biopic for the music itself, a true testament not only to the brilliance in the acting but also to the legend that is Bobby Darin, and Spacey here has created a wonderful example of how to reintroduce music of old to a new generation.  Spacey's determination and dedication to his performance makes every word jump out at you, makes every line swim in your ears for hours on end.  Even scenes as corny as his `Rub-a-Dub-Dub' music video are done with enough humor and sass that the audience is forced to appreciate it for what it is.`Beyond the Sea' may not be the most effective of the biopic's, and coming out in a year that sported some wildly successful and critically appraised films such as `The Aviator' and `Ray' may not have helped it none, but here is a classic example of an actor taking his passion for a performer, a legend and an inspiration and creating a whole knew feel from it.  To me Spacey one up's Foxx's Oscar winning performance by investing his very soul into Bobby.  Spacey didn't merely impersonate the man but he recreated him within himself and gave us Spacey the performer, the actor and the legend.  As a musical showcase `Beyond the Sea' sizzles and shines and is worth every fun filled minute.",4,"The story telling may be a little off center, but Spacey is in true form and more than makes up for it...",1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,3139,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'definitely', 'entire', 'film', 'very', 'supportive', 'back', 'film', 'short', 'brilliance', 'where', 'biopic', 'concerned', 'brilliance', 'when', 'entertaining', 'idea', 'musical', 'genre', 'very', 'hot', 'miss', 'Spacey', 'infectious', 'real', 'life', 'idol', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'moves', 'are', 'crisp', 'voice', 'effortlessly', 'beautiful', 'listen', 'script', 'fails', 'truly', 'man', 'was', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'see', 'relationship', 'screen', 'legend', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'focused', 'telling', 'relationship', 'Darin', 'adult', 'self', 'child', 'self', 'played', 'newcomer', 'William', 'Ullrich.Bosworth', 'notably', 'fantastic', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'emotion', 'fully', 'invested', 'character', 'sadly', 'left', 'little', 'two-dimensional', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'also', 'actor', 'who', 'just', 'amaze', 'performance', 'more', 'poised', 'promising', 'last', 'here', 'Darin', 'brother-in-law', 'beautiful', 'job', 'juggling', 'protective', 'compassionate', 'judgmental', 'Caroline', 'Aaron', 'splendid', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'also', 'illuminate', 'scenes', 'one', 'able', 'stop', 'tidal', 'wave', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'full', 'shiny', 'luminescent', 'glory.The', 'film', 'dream', 'project', 'Spacey', 'Darin', 'making', 'motion', 'picture', 'musical', 'chronicling', 'life', 'feel', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'Spacey', 'actor', 'quite', 'bit', 'older', 'Darin', 'was', 'prime', 'could', 'justify', 'starring', 'film', 'Darin', 'older', 'years', 'now', 'starring', 'younger', 'years', 'film', 'telling', 'life', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'sound', 'too', 'complicated', 'not', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'spectacular', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'whole', 'fulfilling', 'right', 'point', 'story', 'telling', 'bit', 'off.I', 'recommend', 'biopic', 'music', 'true', 'testament', 'not', 'only', 'brilliance', 'acting', 'also', 'legend', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Spacey', 'here', 'created', 'wonderful', 'example', 'how', 'reintroduce', 'music', 'old', 'new', 'generation', 'Spacey', 'determination', 'dedication', 'performance', 'word', 'jump', 'out', 'line', 'swim', 'ears', 'hours', 'end', 'Even', 'scenes', 'as', 'corny', 'Rub-a-Dub-Dub', 'music', 'video', 'are', 'done', 'enough', 'humor', 'sass', 'audience', 'forced', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Sea', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'effective', 'biopic', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'sported', 'wildly', 'successful', 'critically', 'appraised', 'films', 'such', 'Aviator', 'Ray', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'helped', 'none', 'here', 'classic', 'example', 'actor', 'taking', 'passion', 'performer', 'legend', 'inspiration', 'creating', 'whole', 'knew', 'feel', 'Spacey', 'one', 'up', 'Foxx', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'investing', 'very', 'soul', 'Bobby', 'Spacey', 'did', ""n't"", 'merely', 'impersonate', 'man', 'recreated', 'gave', 'Spacey', 'performer', 'actor', 'legend', 'musical', 'showcase', 'Sea', 'sizzles', 'shines', 'worth', 'fun', 'filled', 'minute']",N/A

Bobby Darin was a teen idol during my teen years.  Your movie, so lovingly made and beautifully acted, brought back so many wonderful memories that I sat there in the theater and cried with joy.  An 8th grade sock hop where everyone was jumping to ""Splish Splash,"" a dj-call in show where my current crush dedicated ""Dream Lover"" to me, and the reassuring and hopeful lyrics of ""Beyond the Sea"" that played in my mind during some of high school's darker moments are just some of the many memories your movie brought back.  I'm sure anyone of my generation who was tuned in to music would love this movie.  But my 21-year old daughter whom I coerced into going with me also loved it and we plan on scouring amazon for all the remastered CD's and DVD's on this great and talented man, Bobby Darin.Speaking of great and talented, you have outdone yourself on this one.  We all knew you were a fine actor, but to see you singing and dancing and obviously loving it and imitating Bobby's style and moves so uncannily well must have brought as much joy to you as it did to all of us fortunate enough to have seen this movie.Seeing Bobby's love affair with Sandra Dee played out on the screen was great and brought back all those hours my friends and I spent pouring over issues of ""Photoplay"" to read anything about the super couple.Even those not blessed with memories of Bobby from his heydey will fall in love with this movie for its songs alone.

And Kevin wanted to make a movie about him all his life so he could show-off his impression of Darin and get a chance to sing on film.  So somehow he got someone to finance this vanity piece and he got it made.  Good for him.But as a viewer, should I find that reason enough to applaud the effort?  Maybe if it had been better.  Maybe if someone approaching Darin's youth had starred.  Maybe if Darin's life had been more interesting.Let's face it, Darin's life is a subject for interest because it was cut short. I liked Bobby Darin.  He was a gifted musician and a good singer.  He wrote a couple of good songs.  He was an average actor (his Oscar nomination for a supporting role aside...the Academy did that all the time, especially back then).  Fame came to him early, and without a lot of pain.  He got rich quickly, married a movie star, and even by this loving account, was a petulant, self-absorbed ego-maniac.  He didn't adjust easily to the changing times and struggled to stay relevant.  And before anyone could make a judgement about where he was going or what he would or could become, he died.  Sadly.I sympathize with the effects Rheumatic fever had on his life, I had a beloved cousin that died young because of that.  But Darin's illness allowed his pursuit of music and his gifts gave him a charmed, albeit short, life.As many have pointed out, Kevin Spacey is too old to play the part and there is no getting around that.  Especially when he is playing opposite the very young Kate Bosworth, who doesn't have much to do here by the way.  He got cute with the scenario doing the film within a film bit and so on, but basically, beyond singing the famous tunes, there isn't a lot to work with here, and all the flash and glitter can't cover up the lack of story. He had one shocking relevation later in his life, but it is dramatically flat, and all I felt was the way I felt when he was whining over losing the Oscar....get over it!It was mis-cast, especially in the title role, it was too cute by half in its structure, and it was much ado about very little as far as I was concerned.  So, if you want to spend a couple of hours indulging Kevin's preening fantasy, go ahead. Or, how about just buying Bobby Darin's recordings, and forget this kind of celebrity bio rubbish.",2,Vanity Piece.,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,2344,"['Okay', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Mom', 'loved', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Kevin', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'life', 'could', 'show-off', 'impression', 'Darin', 'get', 'chance', 'sing', 'film', 'So', 'somehow', 'got', 'someone', 'finance', 'vanity', 'piece', 'got', 'made', 'Good', 'him.But', 'viewer', 'should', 'find', 'reason', 'enough', 'applaud', 'effort', 'Maybe', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'approaching', 'Darin', 'youth', 'had', 'starred', 'Maybe', 'Darin', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'interesting.Let', 'face', 'Darin', 'life', 'subject', 'interest', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'liked', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'was', 'gifted', 'musician', 'good', 'singer', 'wrote', 'couple', 'good', 'songs', 'was', 'average', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'supporting', 'role', 'aside', 'Academy', 'did', 'time', 'especially', 'back', 'then', 'Fame', 'came', 'early', 'lot', 'pain', 'got', 'rich', 'quickly', 'married', 'movie', 'star', 'even', 'loving', 'account', 'was', 'petulant', 'self-absorbed', 'ego-maniac', 'did', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'easily', 'changing', 'times', 'struggled', 'stay', 'relevant', 'anyone', 'could', 'make', 'judgement', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'would', 'could', 'become', 'died', 'Sadly.I', 'sympathize', 'effects', 'Rheumatic', 'fever', 'had', 'life', 'had', 'beloved', 'cousin', 'died', 'young', 'Darin', 'illness', 'allowed', 'pursuit', 'music', 'gifts', 'gave', 'charmed', 'short', 'life.As', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'getting', 'around', 'Especially', 'when', 'playing', 'very', 'young', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'here', 'way', 'got', 'cute', 'scenario', 'doing', 'film', 'film', 'bit', 'so', 'basically', 'singing', 'famous', 'tunes', ""n't"", 'lot', 'work', 'here', 'flash', 'glitter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'lack', 'story', 'had', 'one', 'shocking', 'relevation', 'later', 'life', 'dramatically', 'flat', 'felt', 'was', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'was', 'whining', 'losing', 'Oscar', '.get', 'was', 'mis-cast', 'especially', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'too', 'cute', 'half', 'structure', 'was', 'much', 'ado', 'very', 'little', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'So', 'want', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'indulging', 'Kevin', 'preening', 'fantasy', 'go', 'ahead', 'how', 'about', 'just', 'buying', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'recordings', 'forget', 'kind', 'celebrity', 'bio', 'rubbish']",N/A

It is impossible for me to review one without thinking of the other.Two different singers, two different people were profiled in each.Charles was a kid from rural poverty who fought his way through racism and blindness and denied each victory by dominating R&B.; On the charts in the same era was Bobby Darin, a Sinatra-like crooner who wanted to supplant Frank from being chairman of the board.Here, profiling Bobby Darin, Kevin Spacey shows us the demons Darin was dealt. A heart disease almost levels Darin as a child who, from then on, considers life a gift. He grows up to be a star. You know the hits.It was the American dream. Darin was a self-made man. He had fame, fortune, the beautiful wife, the delightful son. He ached knowing his days were numbered. How could he make the most of it?Darin wanted it all, and got most of it. While some of his songs are classics, Sinatra has more of everything. Better movies, better music, and twice the adulation. Still, Darin got his share.The biopic challenge stalls the movie. Trying to make it more than a documentary, there are flashbacks and dialogues with himself as a younger boy. This confused me some, not sure if we were seeing the boy or Darin's imagination.As I say in my review of the CD, Spacey does a fine job of imitating Darin. Where this becomes a problem is in its similarity. Darin is only imitated. He is not equaled. I heard ""Mack the Knife"" on the radio the other day and was reminded how much better the real Darin was. Spacey deserves credit, and yet his limitations are too obvious.Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee is unremarkable. She is dressed up like Dee, but never reaches into her personality. The directors set her up as a place keeper and not an instrumental character. This was the Kevin Spacey show, and everyone else is, at best, a supporting actor/actress.Too much is unexplored. I wanted to see more introspective conversation with his younger self, and more time between Darin and his son. The stress between Darin and Dee never seems real. The interplay between Darin's staff comes across forced, as if inserted into the script at the last minute.It is an interesting movie, especially if Darin's music is still new to you.

I had seen it on the big movie screen when it first came out a few years ago.  Although I can't say it was bad or that I didn't like parts of it, I was distracted by the musical staged numbers which interrupted the story line all too many times.  On stage this may work;  but not in the drama which was really Darin's life.Kevin Stacey's impersonation of Bobby Darin's singing style is almost flawless; but, I stress again, that  the story line seemed liked a drama with inserted musical portions which somehow just didn't flow together right.Kate Bosworth makes a good to very good  attempt at ""doing"" Sandra Dee.  But, not , the Sandra Dee I well remember and  would have liked to have seen. Looking like her just didn't capture the essence of the Sandra Dee I remember and I mean the one in serious drama.  She does show us a Dee who was far from ""Tammy"" or ""Gidget"" and does well  in the fights with Stacey (Darin).  However,  it is really Kevin Stacey's movie until the ending when the young boy who plays Darin as an eight or so year old steals the show. Yet even the final dance scene was uneven and almost an insert to take away from the tragic reality of Darin's untimely death. Instead of that the movie tries to sooth this over and make us all feel better by using  the old standby: ""The guy is dead but the song lives on."" Please!Yet, anything, which is related to the great Bobby Darin deserves praise and applause which is, perhaps, far over due.I will be forgetting this movie (actually had forgot most of it since my first viewing);  but I will never forget the singer I so loved as I danced (in my young adult years) to ""Mack the Knife."" The ""song"" does live on almost as classic as Garland's ""Over the Rainbow.""  This man's talent went beyond most popular  singers of his time, despite poor health and set backs and a failed marriage. Back in a day of social revolutions and change he did  make  transitions in style and creativity to go beyond Darin to the heart beat of a suffering country with his ""simple freedom"" song.  Wish he had been around a lot longer to stay with us on the journey and transitions we all had to make.  Thanks to Stacey and cast (John Goodman was good as Darin's sassy manager) for their efforts.

And Kevin Spacey has captured the magic in this loving film biography!While far too old for the role (his gaunt features scarcely recall the chubby-faced Italian-American crooner), Spacey, as star and director, shares Darin's passion for perfection, and the film has an electricity that many other recent film bios have lacked. Not only does the film offer a flawless musical performance by Spacey (who worked from Darin's original arrangements), it addresses Darin's personal demons (knowledge he would die young, after childhood rheumatic fever; discovering his 'sister' was, in fact, his mother; seeing the musical world completely change around him; an increasing dependency on drugs) without falling into clich&eacute;s or relying on modern-day editorializing. Darin embraced life, and this joy makes the film a celebration of the man behind the music.The highlight of the film is Darin's remarkable, life-long love with Sandra Dee, portrayed to wide-eyed perfection by Kate Bosworth. Dee, totally controlled by her manipulative mother (Greta Scacchi), was as naive as any of her screen heroines, and her pursuit by the amorous pop singer was as funny and wildly romantic as a classic Hollywood musical (a fact not lost on Spacey, who turns the courtship into a terrific singing and dancing production number). Only after their marriage, when Darin's career made him a frequently absentee husband and father, did Dee find increasing solace in a bottle, as her career crumbled...and to both of their credit, Darin and Dee put their careers on hold, to give their son more attention, despite the disastrous effect it had on each of them, professionally.""Beyond the Sea"" offers a first-rate supporting cast, including blustery John Goodman, as loyal manager Steve Blauner, Brenda Blethyn, as Darin's gifted mother/grandmother, and Caroline Aaron and Bob Hoskins, as his sister/mother, and her wise, 'blue collar' husband. Deserving special recognition is young William Ullrich, portraying Darin, as a child, who not only offers a sensitive portrayal, but does a very credible song-and-dance number with Spacey!Filmed entirely at Germany's Marlene Dietrich Studios (during the frigid winter of 2003), the film perfectly captures the 'look' of New York, Italy, and Las Vegas, with no indication of the financial difficulties Spacey faced during production (causing shooting to be delayed nearly six months).The final film certainly justifies the hardships; it is on the short list of truly great pop performer biographies, and is a well-deserved triumph for Kevin Spacey!",5,Spacey's Loving Tribute to Meteoric Star...,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,2785,"['Bobby', 'Darin', 'crammed', 'lot', 'living', '37', 'years', 'never', 'achieved', 'pinnacle', 'stardom', 'yearned', 'created', 'unforgettable', 'legacy', 'era', 'where', 'talent', 'luck', 'magic', 'could', 'happen', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'captured', 'magic', 'loving', 'film', 'biography', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'gaunt', 'features', 'scarcely', 'recall', 'chubby-faced', 'Italian-American', 'crooner', 'Spacey', 'star', 'director', 'shares', 'Darin', 'passion', 'perfection', 'film', 'electricity', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'film', 'bios', 'have', 'lacked', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'offer', 'flawless', 'musical', 'performance', 'Spacey', 'who', 'worked', 'Darin', 'original', 'arrangements', 'Darin', 'personal', 'demons', 'knowledge', 'would', 'die', 'young', 'childhood', 'rheumatic', 'fever', 'discovering', ""'sister"", 'was', 'fact', 'mother', 'seeing', 'musical', 'world', 'completely', 'change', 'increasing', 'dependency', 'drugs', 'falling', 'clich', 'eacute', 'relying', 'modern-day', 'editorializing', 'Darin', 'embraced', 'life', 'joy', 'film', 'celebration', 'man', 'music.The', 'highlight', 'film', 'Darin', 'remarkable', 'life-long', 'love', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'portrayed', 'wide-eyed', 'perfection', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Dee', 'totally', 'controlled', 'manipulative', 'mother', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'was', 'as', 'naive', 'screen', 'heroines', 'pursuit', 'amorous', 'pop', 'singer', 'was', 'funny', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'fact', 'not', 'lost', 'Spacey', 'who', 'courtship', 'terrific', 'singing', 'dancing', 'production', 'number', 'Only', 'marriage', 'when', 'Darin', 'career', 'made', 'frequently', 'absentee', 'husband', 'father', 'did', 'Dee', 'find', 'increasing', 'solace', 'bottle', 'career', 'crumbled', 'credit', 'Darin', 'Dee', 'put', 'careers', 'hold', 'give', 'son', 'more', 'attention', 'disastrous', 'effect', 'had', 'professionally', 'Sea', 'first-rate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'blustery', 'John', 'Goodman', 'loyal', 'manager', 'Steve', 'Blauner', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Darin', 'gifted', 'mother/grandmother', 'Caroline', 'Aaron', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'sister/mother', 'wise', 'collar', 'husband', 'Deserving', 'special', 'recognition', 'young', 'William', 'Ullrich', 'portraying', 'Darin', 'child', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'very', 'credible', 'song-and-dance', 'number', 'Spacey', 'Filmed', 'entirely', 'Germany', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Studios', 'frigid', 'winter', '2003', 'film', 'perfectly', ""'look"", 'New', 'York', 'Italy', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'indication', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'Spacey', 'faced', 'production', 'causing', 'shooting', 'be', 'delayed', 'nearly', 'six', 'months', '.The', 'final', 'film', 'certainly', 'hardships', 'short', 'list', 'truly', 'great', 'pop', 'performer', 'biographies', 'well-deserved', 'triumph', 'Kevin', 'Spacey']",N/A
901064,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00094ARN2,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[0, 7]","No Title AvailableThe Bobby Darrin Story:Almost skipping this movie because of the clip shown on Today Show, a minor few seconds which could easily have been missed (in fact, I probably would have had I not seen it on t.v.), I debated about whether I would enjoy it. But, loving music won out to my dismay, with a slight machine dysfunction, and the ending had an ironic, pleasant, totally unexpected 'beginning.'Now I like Richard Gere; he was my first choice to play the lead of Robert Kincaid in BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. This movie proved that point, he definitely would have been a perfect Kincaid. His innocent sensuosity makes women blossom as, in this movie, his character (John Clark) is a late bloomer.In my April, 2003, review of CHICAGO, I wrote, ""Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?"" In this film, he did some fancy footwork especially the Quick Step (ballroom style) which to me was the 'best dance' even though a minor calamity became a tragic consequence at the pivotal point of the Competition. The 'dirty dancing' scene was overdone but I finally found some dance moves I could do! (See my review of DIRTY DANCING: HAVANA NIGHTS)This story is about the humdrum, mundane life of a big city lawyer, bored with his responsible lifestyle of wealth and material things who became fascinated with a young woman who changed his existence during his mid-life crisis.But mainly it is a movie about dancing, all types, showing an excerpt of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in SILK STOCKINGS. He'd found 'the woman of my dreams' though he had two teenagers and a busy wife at home. His life became the dance, less of family and work.On an impulse, he enters the life of this troubled young dance instructor who was carrying a lot of emotional baggage from a failed relationship (her former dance partner jilted her) who was hiding out, frustrated, angry at the 'deck life had dealt her.' He did something totally out of character after twenty years -- 'out of the blue'; his quiet desperation can't be quiet anymore.In the window, she'd looked like he felt, despondent. Every night he'd look for her from the train, and she'd be looking for him. Long ago, I too looked out my window at a young handsome FBI man as he exited work and he'd look up at me. But that's another story.The actress who played the stand-offish dance teacher has much experience doing modern dances but admitted on CBS Early Show that she had trouble concentrating on the ballroom dancing moves. She had a stiff back, and I learned on into the movie that dancing creates good posture along with the graceful motions involved.In the beginning, he fumbled trying to do the two-step (waltz) with the young woman, which reminded me of Eddy Roy at the first swing dance I attended in Knoxville. This gal seemed stiff and I thought early on that the young couple at this local dance performed much better. I was wrong. The Rumba is the dance of love, as explained with emotion by Pauline. Every move of the male dancer is to show off the female partner, as exhibited at Al Curtis' dances.These were a group of mismatched dancers and his beginning compatriots were a riot as they attempted to learn the moves without partners, only an older teacher who owned the dance establishment. She was a good actress, as was the full-figured blonde who wanted to be Cinderella but looked like a taller Dolly Parton. She was John's dance partner at the Competition. A truthful woman, crude but terrifying to the men, when she said, ""I'm doing you a favor telling you something obnoxious about yourself."" The ChaCha dancers were something else as they showed their stuff. Shades of GREASE. Stanley Tucci lost his wig but gained composure and finesse. Stanley Tucci was a closet dancer who came out of the closet in a big way.As with most marriages, there was miscommunication and many lies as a coverup. He admitted ""I was ashamed of wanting to be happy when we have so much."" Finally, everything is out on the table; I agree with him that football and dance don't agree. The working wife was sorry for her snooping, which had a positive effect on the investigator.Their home life could never be the same because of his 'change.' He kept going back to the dance lessons and was coaxed onto the floor at a disco by his elder dance teacher, pretending to be Yul Brunner doing ""Shall We Dance"" from THE KING AND I. My goodness, he was good.As #126 at the Dance Competition, he sparkled in the tux and some fancy dance shoes (similar to what Michael Feinstein wears in his concerts) but had to do some deep breathing practices learned in relaxation response. This life was too emotional for a practical lawyer, but he was a different person from the man who had walked into that studio in search of the elusive 'dream.' They had changed each others' lives for the better; she felt that for the first time she could be herself again. From childhood, she had held an illusion of the 'most beautiful woman in the world' who had influenced her to become a dancer.Dance begins with the dancer's feelings. Teaching the steps to his devoted wife, he explains that all you do is move with the music (with a little emotion involved, of course). Once I said that to someone who refused to believe. She wanted a little part of his new life, and he had his cake (ate it, too!). Like someone I asked to teach me to drink (he refused), he was afraid to hurt the person you treasure most. He resisted his impulses to love and traveled a strange journey to redemption. His son's friend was a surprise.You should get a kick out of the ending. He did. A rewarding movie outing well-worth the price of admission.",3,Shall We Dance,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,5670,"['Title', 'AvailableThe', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'Story', 'Almost', 'skipping', 'movie',

I've enjoyed all of his films to date ...with the exception of this one.The plotting of ""The Usual Suspects"" left me gasping and laughing and clapping. ""The Shipping News"" left me equally impressed, as did ""K-Pax"" and ""American Beauty"". But here I feel that Mr. Spacey went a bit beyond his reach, and beyond his age.First, let me say that I love Bobby Darin's voice. ""Splish-Splash"" and ""Mack the Knife"" are two of my favorite oldies. They're snappy tunes with a distinctive quality to them. Whenever I hear them on the radio, I turn it up. But now, there may be a ""stain"" in my memory thanks to this film. Spacey is not, could never be, Bobby Darin. It is, to the best of my knowledge, the first time Spacey has ever portrayed an actual historical character, let alone a musical legend, and he didn't pull it off very well.Spacey's love of the material shines through more than the material itself. To his credit, Kevin Spacey gives it his all, trying to sing and dance his way into our hearts. But, unfortunately, he is NOT Bobby. The plotting of the film tries to dismiss Spacey's advanced years by showing us a film being made within this film; a film based on the life of Bobby Darin. But Spacey is so much older than Bobby Darin ever was that his performance rang hollow.And although Spacey can sing, he cannot sing up to the quality of Bobby Darin. Whenever a song was presented during the film, I could instantly tell which ones were being sung by Darin and which by Mr. Spacey.The musical numbers involving choreographed dance sequences also weren't up to today's standards. Moulin Rouge and Chicago were far superior productions.There were some decent moments in the film; for instance whenever Bobby Darin first meets Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), and doesn't let up swooning her until she agrees to marry him. And when he finally accepts who his true mother was (tear-jerking).Although it had it's good moments, the bad dialogue, scripting, dancing, and songs not sung by Darin himself, made this a tough film to watch. But I'd be willing to bet that big time Bobby Darin fans will love it to pieces.",3,An Average Film From A Normally Above Average Actor,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2161,"['am', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'films', 'date', 'exception', 'one.The', 'plotting', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'left', 'gasping', 'laughing', 'clapping', 'Shipping', 'News', 'left', 'equally', 'impressed', 'did', 'K-Pax', 'American', 'Beauty', 'here', 'feel', 'Mr.', 'Spacey', 'went', 'bit', 'reach', 'age.First', 'let', 'say', 'love', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'voice', 'Splish-Splash', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'oldies', ""'re"", 'snappy', 'tunes', 'distinctive', 'quality', 'Whenever', 'hear', 'radio', 'turn', 'up', 'now', 'may', 'be', 'stain', 'memory', 'thanks', 'film', 'Spacey', 'not', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'best', 'knowledge', 'first', 'time', 'Spacey', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'actual', 'historical', 'character', 'let', 'alone', 'musical', 'legend', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'well.Spacey', 'love', 'material', 'shines', 'more', 'material', 'credit', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'trying', 'sing', 'dance', 'way', 'hearts', 'unfortunately', 'NOT', 'Bobby', 'plotting', 'film', 'tries', 'dismiss', 'Spacey', 'advanced', 'years', 'showing', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'film', 'based', 'life', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Spacey', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'ever', 'was', 'performance', 'rang', 'hollow.And', 'Spacey', 'can', 'sing', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'up', 'quality', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Whenever', 'song', 'was', 'presented', 'film', 'could', 'instantly', 'tell', 'ones', 'were', 'being', 'sung', 'Darin', 'Mr.', 'Spacey.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'involving', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'sequences', 'also', 'were', ""n't"", 'up', 'today', 'standards', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'productions.There', 'were', 'decent', 'moments', 'film', 'instance', 'whenever', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'first', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'swooning', 'marry', 'when', 'finally', 'who', 'true', 'mother', 'was', 'tear-jerking', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'scripting', 'dancing', 'songs', 'not', 'sung', 'Darin', 'made', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'big', 'time', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'pieces']",N/A
901066,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B00094ARN2,Bob L,"[2, 7]","I'm a huge fan of Bobby Darin and Kevin Spacey but I was avoiding this movie because as we all know Kevin won't be able to fool us into thinking he's Bobby and I didn't want to feel embarrassed for him. Kevin didn't look young enough to play the baby-faced Darin when he was in Working Girl, little less now.I was at Western Union and the guy in front of me and I started talking. I wish I could remember how it started but basically we talked briefly for about four or five minutes about our appreciation for the arts over the past forty or so years. I found out at the end of our conversation that his name is Dave and he's a DJ in a strip joint in San Jose. Of course, I was extremely envious but I digress. We found that we had so many likes in common that I figured I tout a few things to him. I told him about Eric McFadden(check him out)and that I had discover, just in time to see the greatest concert I'd ever seen(out of about two thousand), Michael Buble. I may be one of a couple hundred people, if that, that follow both these artists. In fact, I might be the only one as this is a very wide gap between these two giants. But after talking to Dave for four or five minutes I knew he had the necessary appreciative skills. In return Dave quiried, ""Have you seen Beyond the Sea?"" Dave had already read me well enough to know where I would be at concerning Spacey and Darin and possible reservations about the flick without us having talked about any of these subjects. I realized this but still needlessly asked, ""You've seen Aces Back to Back(for which I had just written a review) and the Mack is Back?"" and of course he replied, ""Oh yah."" Well, as you can guess, if you're still with me, that was enough for me.I just finished watching it and read the first dozen or so reviews. First thing first, thanks Dave. I equate this with Bob Roberts which I think is one of the Hundred Greatest Movies ever and with Kung Fu Hustle(oddly enough another one I just reviewed). I don't care for the Academy but I sure hope they don't over look this effort. That is unless it was in last year's group and was already been overlooked. Chow, Robbins, Beatty and Spacey are modern day Orson Welles. I would never have expected this movie or Spacey to be so good. No, he not young enough but it doesn't make a bit of difference because Spacey is a great actor and fully capable of suspending our belief. The alternative would be to have Jonathan Rhys Meyers unconvincingly lip synch Darin tracks and that would have made a dull movie. This is anything but dull.Some reviewers complained about the contrivances of the plot but I found them immediately engaging. The point that I felt he had nailed it was Artificial Flowers. He didn't make me feel it like Bobby did and the same goes for Song of Freedom but what I got was the he understood and not that many people do. Believe me, I tried vainly with many. It easy to get it when it's Beyond the Sea or Dream Lover or Mack the Knife. But Kevin really gets it and he's bringing it to us. He was far more animated then Darin really was but that was part of the fantasy, the moonbeams but this is useless diatribe. Spacey, as was Darin, was brilliant. Goodness, he co-wrote and directed it too. Chow, Robbins, Beatty and Spacey, who are these people? Are the from Earth?Everyone in this movie was great, even Goodman but especially Bosworth, Aaron, Ullrich and Blethyn. The music and choreography are a joy to behold. It's funny and it's heartfelt. Thanks again Dave.One thing curious to me is where was the industry support for this movie? I got no buzz at all. Our top Bay Area critic panned it but that's to be expected. He wouldn't know a good movie if it sat on him. Speaking of which, Hey Chronicle, why don't you hire me. All the good jobs have been taken by guys like Dave. And say, can that Antoinette write a review? Makes wish I was literate.I just was told by my wife that it was in last year's group. The Academy sucks. And I'm not taking anything away from Jamie, I've been a fan of his for years.",5,I know my hair is falling out,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,4055,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'avoiding', 'movie', 'know', 'Kevin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'fool', 'thinking', 'Bobby', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'Kevin', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'young', 'enough', 'play', 'baby-faced', 'Darin', 'when', 'was', 'Working', 'Girl', 'little', 'less', 'now.I', 'was', 'Western', 'Union', 'guy', 'front', 'started', 'talking', 'wish', 'could', 'remember', 'how', 'started', 'basically', 'talked', 'briefly', 'four', 'five', 'minutes', 'appreciation', 'arts', 'past', 'forty', 'so', 'years', 'found', 'out', 'end', 'conversation', 'name', 'Dave', 'DJ', 'strip', 'joint', 'San', 'Jose', 'course', 'was', 'extremely', 'envious', 'digress', 'found', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'likes', 'common', 'figured', 'tout', 'few', 'things', 'told', 'Eric', 'McFadden', 'check', 'out', 'had', 'discover', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'greatest', 'concert', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'thousand', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'couple', 'hundred', 'people', 'follow', 'artists', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'very', 'wide', 'gap', 'two', 'giants', 'talking', 'Dave', 'four', 'five', 'minutes', 'knew', 'had', 'necessary', 'appreciative', 'skills', 'return', 'Dave', 'quiried', 'Have', 'seen', 'Sea', 'Dave', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'concerning', 'Spacey', 'Darin', 'possible', 'reservations', 'flick', 'having', 'talked', 'subjects', 'realized', 'still', 'needlessly', 'asked', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Aces', 'Back', 'Back', 'had', 'just', 'written', 'review', 'Mack', 'Back', 'course', 'replied', 'Oh', 'yah', 'Well', 'can', 'guess', ""'re"", 'still', 'was', 'enough', 'me.I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'read', 'first', 'dozen', 'so', 'reviews', 'First', 'thing', 'first', 'thanks', 'Dave', 'equate', 'Bob', 'Roberts', 'think', 'one', 'Hundred', 'Greatest', 'Movies', 'ever', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'oddly', 'enough', 'one', 'just', 'reviewed', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Academy', 'sure', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'over', 'look', 'effort', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'group', 'was', 'already', 'been', 'overlooked', 'Chow', 'Robbins', 'Beatty', 'Spacey', 'are', 'modern', 'day', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'expected', 'movie', 'Spacey', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'No', 'not', 'young', 'enough', ""n't"", 'make', 'bit', 'difference', 'Spacey', 'great', 'actor', 'fully', 'capable', 'suspending', 'belief', 'alternative', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'unconvincingly', 'synch', 'Darin', 'tracks', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'dull', 'movie', 'anything', 'dull.Some', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'contrivances', 'plot', 'found', 'immediately', 'engaging', 'point', 'felt', 'had', 'nailed', 'was', 'Artificial', 'Flowers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'Bobby', 'did', 'same', 'Song', 'Freedom', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'understood', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'Believe', 'tried', 'vainly', 'many', 'get', 'when', 'Sea', 'Dream', 'Lover', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'Kevin', 'really', 'bringing', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'animated', 'then', 'Darin', 'really', 'was', 'was', 'part', 'fantasy', 'moonbeams', 'useless', 'diatribe', 'Spacey', 'was', 'Darin', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Goodness', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'too', 'Chow', 'Robbins', 'Beatty', 'Spacey', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'Are', 'Earth', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'Goodman', 'especially', 'Bosworth', 'Aaron', 'Ullrich', 'Blethyn', 'music', 'choreography', 'are', 'joy', 'behold', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'Thanks', 'again', 'Dave.One', 'thing', 'curious', 'where', 'was', 'industry', 'support', 'movie', 'got', 'buzz', 'top', 'Bay', 'Area', 'critic', 'panned', 'be', 'expected', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'sat', 'Speaking', 'Hey', 'Chronicle', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'hire', 'good', 'jobs', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'guys', 'Dave', 'say', 'can', 'Antoinette', 'write', 'review', 'Makes', 'wish', 'was', 'literate.I', 'just', 'was', 'told', 'wife', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'group', 'Academy', 'sucks', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'Jamie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'years']",N/A

901069,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00094ARN2,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[4, 7]","""Beyond the Sea"" is an entertaining movie about one of rock and roll's earliest pop sensations, the late Bobby Darin. Musical biopics have been made for several performers but this is the only one I have watched that examines the life of the man who popularized such classics as Mack the Knife, Splish Splash, Dream Lover, and many others.Several aspects of this movie make it different from other music biopics and some of them may not be to everyone's liking. One of the major parts of the movie involves actor William Ulrich who plays Bobby Darin as a young boy. Throughout the film, Ulrich pops into the scene in the movie and talks to Bobby Darin and discusses the film, talks about his life, and reminds the older version of himself about some of the important things he learned from his family members. This addition to the movie seemed a little odd at first and I wasn't sure what to think about it. I got used to it after a while, but I don't know if it was the best way to make a movie about Bobby Darin's life. It was ripe with symbolism and it related to the other parts of the movie but I know that many will not like this part of the film and it is one of the few areas where movie critics came down hard against Beyond the Sea. Another thing that some may not like is the fact that Kevin Spacey was about 45 years old when he made this movie yet he is portraying a man who was 10 to 25 years younger. Spacey might have done better to make this movie about ten or fifteen years ago when he looked even more like the real Bobby Darin.Another unusual part of this movie- but one that i liked- was the fact that it includes elements of a musical production rather than just an ordinary movie. Every music biopic includes musical performances, so this is nothing new. But what is interesting is director Kevin Spacey's decision to include small parts of the movie that are like a Broadway musical or opera (where the script is sung, not spoken). I liked this idea and I felt that it added a new dimension to the movie that you don't normally see in a biopic. I should point out that most of these musical moments were during the surreal sequences that involved Bobby talking to himself as a little boy. But I still thought they were good for the overall enjoyment of the film due to the songs and the entertaining dance routines.Let's now talk about the performances because at least one of them is superb. I am talking about, of course, Kevin Spacey in the lead role as Bobby Darin. Spacey is an excellent actor who has won a couple of Oscars so it shouldn't surprise anyone that his performance would be better than average. What is surprising, however, is how excellent Spacey is at performing in this role. Not only does he have the look, the mannerisms, and the personality of Bobby Darin, he can sing and dance, too. I was shocked to discover later that Spacey sings all of the songs in this movie! To hear him sing, you would swear you are listening to Bobby Darin. I thought for sure some of the songs were lip- synced but they are not. And then there is the dancing. Spacey shows how multi- talented he is in front of a camera in the many dance routines in this movie. The singing and dancing added to the film's educational value, too. Not only did I get to learn things I didn't know about Bobby Darin (like the fact that he adopted the name ""Darin"" and was really named Cassotto) but I also got to learn that Kevin Spacey is an excellent singer and dancer. In one of the extras on the DVD, Spacey points out that he started out his career in musicals and even auditioned for roles in many big name movie musicals. Again, I did not know anything about this so it was quite a shock when Spacey grabbed the microphone and started singing like a seasoned professional.Other performances in this movie are also notable, like Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Bosworth plays Bobby Darin's wife- not an easy task when you consider the arrogant, volatile personality of Mr. Darin. She is emotional in the movie without taking it too far and she also shows her devotion to her husband in spite of his many personality flaws and his general neglect of his family. I also liked John Goodman in the role as Steve Blauner. Goodman is cool yet firm- exactly the type of person needed to handle the character of Bobby Darin and set him straight when necessary.Beyond the Sea has a great soundtrack- not just for the Bobby Darin songs but for other musical selections as well. One great surprise was the song ""Let it Loose"", a generally unknown song from the Rolling Stones (from the album Exile on Main Street). When I first heard this tune, I was pleasantly surprised and director/producer Kevin Spacey deserves credit for its inclusion. Its surreal sound and message fit in perfectly with the scene where it is played.Bobby Darin is a true rags to riches story that turns tragic in the end when Darin dies at the young age of 37. His life story is an interesting one, full of fast living, quick success, lofty goals, and personal turmoil. Keven Spacey's performance of Bobby Darin captures the arrogant, conceited personality of Darin quite well and Spacey's singing and dancing are nearly flawless. The movie overall could have been improved with a few slight changes but it is still a good film. Darin was several years before my time but I am still familiar with his music and much of it is showcased nicely in this biopic. Fans of Bobby Darin and his music will greatly enjoy this trip down memory lane.",4,Life is But a Dream,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,5514,"['Sea', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one', 'rock', 'roll',

901070,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00094ARN2,Caleb Williams,"[3, 5]","Being a fan of the swing era and in particular Darin I couldn't wait to see this movie when I first heard about it being made. Knowing about the people involved, what story it had to tell and the format it would take I just knew this would be amazing from the first minute to the last. Kevin Spacey is currently the finest actor to ever grace the silver screen, and he will go down in history as one of the finest to ever grace it. Bobby Darin in contrast was one of the finest singers of the great musical generation, was basically the first ever teen idol and has definitely gone down in history as one of the most entertaining and charismatic singers of the swing generation.Before the film had even come to the screens, there was constant talk about whether Spacey was too old to play the part being 45 at the time and playing Bobby from his early to later career. In some respects it may be true that Kevin may have been too old to play the part, but he certainly put my fears to rest. The opening sequence of the film is an elongated introduction to the legendary song of ""Mack The Knife"" in which we're instantly introduced to Spacey as Darin making his way to the stage. The minute Spacey hits the stage, grabs the mic and engages the audience of actors you know that he was born to play Darin.The story quite simply focuses around the life of Bobby Darin starting off modestly in his childhood when being taught the piano and to sing by his Mother, then growing into becoming the star he is. At the age of 8 Darin overheard a doctor tell his mother that he (Darin) would be lucky to see 16 years of age, so he lived in constant fear of his own mortality and developed high determination to live his short life to the fullest. Throughout the story we come to see the people he met that changed his life forever, especially his first wife Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth).Being a Biopic Musical is something you don't regularly see, but when it does come around it certainly is an experience and this is made all the better with Spacey doing his musical performances. I honestly didn't realise that Spacey had such vocal talent, but the mimicry of all of Darins mannerisms are certainly something special. The dialect, the movements, the charisma and the aura are all expressed superbly throughout the film. In effect Spacey overshadows the entire supporting cast with his truly outstanding performance throughout. I'm not sure why but Spacey seemed to put that little bit extra into this performance, whether it was to prove the critics wrong or whether it was to do Darin justice I simply don't know, but what I do know is that it was wonderful.Mentioning the supporting cast, there are certainly a few big names in there such as John Goodman as Darins manager, Bob Hoskins as his sisters husband and of course Kate Bosworth as the fabulous Sandra Dee. A special mention should go to William Ullrich as he plays a young Bobby Darin and actually performs a few musical duets with Spacey within the film. He's a delightful kid and very talented and possibly the only one not to be overshadowed by Spacey's presence.Overall I would advise you all to ignore the negative critics on this one and at least give it a chance. Of course, if you don't like it then, then at least you can say ""well I gave it a shot and it just didn't work for me."" This isn't a film for everyone because of its subject and its format as some simply aren't fans of musicals, but judge each film on its merit that's what I say.",5,A Divine Piece Of Musical Cinema,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,3501,"['Being', 'fan', 'swing', 'era', 'particular', 'Darin', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'being', 'made', 'Knowing', 'people', 'involved', 'what', 'story', 'had', 'tell', 'format', 'would', 'take', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'first', 'minute', 'last', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'currently', 'finest', 'actor', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'finest', 'ever', 'grace', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'contrast', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'singers', 'great', 'musical', 'generation', 'was', 'basically', 'first', 'ever', 'teen', 'idol', 'definitely', 'gone', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'charismatic', 'singers', 'swing', 'generation.Before', 'film', 'had', 'even', 'come', 'screens', 'was', 'constant', 'talk', 'Spacey', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'being', '45', 'time', 'playing', 'Bobby', 'early', 'later', 'career', 'respects', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Kevin', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'certainly', 'put', 'fears', 'rest', 'opening', 'sequence', 'film', 'elongated', 'introduction', 'legendary', 'song', 'Mack', 'Knife', ""'re"", 'instantly', 'introduced', 'Spacey', 'Darin', 'making', 'way', 'stage', 'minute', 'Spacey', 'stage', 'mic', 'audience', 'actors', 'know', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Darin.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simply', 'life', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'starting', 'off', 'modestly', 'childhood', 'when', 'being', 'taught', 'piano', 'sing', 'Mother', 'then', 'growing', 'becoming', 'star', 'age', '8', 'Darin', 'overheard', 'doctor', 'tell', 'mother', 'Darin', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'see', '16', 'years', 'age', 'lived', 'constant', 'fear', 'own', 'mortality', 'developed', 'high', 'determination', 'live', 'short', 'life', 'fullest', 'story', 'come', 'see', 'people', 'met', 'changed', 'life', 'forever', 'especially', 'first', 'wife', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', '.Being', 'Biopic', 'Musical', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'regularly', 'see', 'when', 'come', 'certainly', 'experience', 'made', 'better', 'Spacey', 'doing', 'musical', 'performances', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'Spacey', 'had', 'such', 'vocal', 'talent', 'mimicry', 'Darins', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'certainly', 'something', 'special', 'dialect', 'movements', 'charisma', 'aura', 'are', 'expressed', 'superbly', 'film', 'effect', 'Spacey', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Spacey', 'seemed', 'put', 'little', 'bit', 'extra', 'performance', 'was', 'prove', 'critics', 'wrong', 'was', 'do', 'Darin', 'justice', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'wonderful.Mentioning', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'certainly', 'few', 'big', 'names', 'there', 'such', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Darins', 'manager', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'sisters', 'husband', 'course', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'fabulous', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'William', 'Ullrich', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'actually', 'few', 'musical', 'duets', 'Spacey', 'film', 'delightful', 'kid', 'very', 'talented', 'possibly', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'Spacey', 'presence.Overall', 'would', 'advise', 'ignore', 'negative', 'critics', 'one', 'least', 'give', 'chance', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'then', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'well', 'gave', 'shot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', ""n't"", 'film', 'everyone', 'subject', 'format', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'musicals', 'judge', 'film', 'merit', 'what', 'say']",N/A

I'd read some reviews that criticized Spacey for being too old or the plot for interrupting the flow with the young Bobby Darin character. No way! Spacey is wonderful and sings amazingly well, thank goodness. (I hate bad singing in musicals.) I could not tell the difference between him and Darin. He even dances well in the (limited) dancing scenes. The story, which moves cleverly from an opening scene with Darin at his oldest back to his childhood, kept me totally engrossed from start to finish. This movie shows the creativity that we crave in films, giving some insight into Darin and Sandra Dee (gorgeously played by Kate Bosworth) while paying tribute to Darin's one consistent characteristic: he was an entertainer, and this movie stays unrelentingly entertaining as well. Most important, the director, Spacey, lets you actually see and hear a lot of the singing and dancing without too much interruption. I found the ending quite touching, but Spacey does not let us wallow in deathbed scenery and there is an upbeat feeling as the credits roll. Well worth a watch if you like Bobby Darin's singing or just an interesting biographical summation.

This is an odd requiem for a talented performer who put such a high value on the truth.  A callous reporter once remarked that Bobby Darin failed to achieve his goal to be a living legend at age 25 and become more popular than Frank Sinatra.  Kevin Spacey failed to achieve his goal, too.  If you want to learn about Darin, a man on borrowed time obsessed with stardom, you will leave the theater feeling cheated.  Read the biography, Dream Lovers, by son Dodd, and you will learn there is much of Darin's life missing in the 2-hour account filled with more imagery and illusion than meat or meaning.  There's nothing about his relationship with Connie Francis, his divorce from Sandra Dee, or his other marriage.  I kept hoping Spacey would redeem himself at various points and he had plenty of opportunity to do so.  When we heard the voice-over of Darin's mom repeating their telephone number, I thought Spacey would follow with Darin repeating that number as his last words on his deathbed, which reportedly happened.  Then we saw a nervous Dee on her wedding night almost hysterical at the thought of intimacy with Darin.  At that point, I was expecting Spacey to clue the audience into a possible origin for Dee's sudden anxiety (again, read the book,) but he glossed it over with a quick fix fairy-tale.  The only moment Spacey gives the audience a chance to care about the characters is when sister Nina tells Darin the truth about his mom, Polly.  That moment is also Spacey's best use of the stylized flashback, a technique better executed by Bob Fosse in his autobiographical All That Jazz.  Fosse had his character periodically communicating with a beautiful angel of death while Spacey had Darin searching for truth and time through conversations with himself as a child.  Fosse's musical productions were insightful in themselves while Spacey's were often intrusive and only served as reminders that he can sing and dance.  Spacey made it easy to care about Bobby, the child.  I had trouble caring about the middle-aged man playing a popular singer in his early twenties romancing a teenager, especially in the YELLOW suit.  There's never a suspension of disbelief.  I collected all of Bobby Darin's recordings as a child.  He was my teen idol, and I drove 200 miles just to see this film.  However, as biopics go, this is more about Spacey wanting to be Bobby Darin instead of Spacey's desire to show us who Bobby Darin really was.",2,If I Were A Critic...,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,2565,"['end', 'motion', 'picture', 'disclaimer', 'have', 'watched', 'fantasy', 'version', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'odd', 'requiem', 'talented', 'performer', 'who', 'put', 'high', 'value', 'truth', 'callous', 'reporter', 'once', 'remarked', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'failed', 'achieve', 'goal', 'be', 'living', 'legend', 'age', '25', 'become', 'more', 'popular', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'failed', 'achieve', 'goal', 'too', 'want', 'learn', 'Darin', 'man', 'borrowed', 'time', 'obsessed', 'stardom', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'Read', 'biography', 'Dream', 'Lovers', 'son', 'Dodd', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'Darin', 'life', 'missing', '2-hour', 'account', 'filled', 'more', 'imagery', 'illusion', 'meat', 'meaning', 'nothing', 'relationship', 'Connie', 'Francis', 'divorce', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'other', 'marriage', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Spacey', 'would', 'redeem', 'various', 'points', 'had', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'When', 'heard', 'voice-over', 'Darin', 'mom', 'repeating', 'telephone', 'number', 'thought', 'Spacey', 'would', 'follow', 'Darin', 'repeating', 'number', 'last', 'words', 'deathbed', 'reportedly', 'happened', 'Then', 'saw', 'nervous', 'Dee', 'wedding', 'night', 'almost', 'hysterical', 'thought', 'intimacy', 'Darin', 'point', 'was', 'expecting', 'Spacey', 'clue', 'audience', 'possible', 'origin', 'Dee', 'sudden', 'anxiety', 'again', 'read', 'book', 'glossed', 'over', 'quick', 'fix', 'fairy-tale', 'only', 'moment', 'Spacey', 'audience', 'chance', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'sister', 'Nina', 'Darin', 'truth', 'mom', 'Polly', 'moment', 'also', 'Spacey', 'best', 'use', 'stylized', 'flashback', 'technique', 'better', 'executed', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'autobiographical', 'Jazz', 'Fosse', 'had', 'character', 'periodically', 'communicating', 'beautiful', 'angel', 'death', 'Spacey', 'had', 'Darin', 'searching', 'truth', 'time', 'conversations', 'child', 'Fosse', 'musical', 'productions', 'were', 'insightful', 'Spacey', 'were', 'often', 'intrusive', 'only', 'served', 'reminders', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'Spacey', 'made', 'easy', 'care', 'Bobby', 'child', 'had', 'trouble', 'caring', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'playing', 'popular', 'singer', 'early', 'twenties', 'romancing', 'teenager', 'especially', 'YELLOW', 'suit', 'never', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'collected', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'recordings', 'child', 'was', 'teen', 'idol', 'drove', '200', 'miles', 'just', 'see', 'film', 'However', 'biopics', 'go', 'more', 'Spacey', 'wanting', 'be', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'instead', 'Spacey', 'desire', 'show', 'who', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'really', 'was']",N/A

He was born to play the part; no one else could have sang like Darin. Kevin was excellent in the role, and, directed the film with imagination and courage.

901083,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00094ARN2,Craig Matteson,"[17, 18]","Frankly, I did not appreciate Bobby Darin when he was alive.  I was too young and didn't quite get what he was about.  I had just started paying attention to him when he died in 1973.  It is about time someone told his story.  By all accounts, Kevin Spacey is a Bobby Darin devotee and it shows in this wonderful and fascinating movie.First of all, I loved the way the story is told.  It is not a narrative, although it talks about the singer's life.  It is all about the music and how it came out of his strange youth and how his illness forced him to focus in on what mattered most to him because he never expected to live all that long.  Rheumatic Fever as a child had damaged his heart.  Of course, the smoking, drinking, and pills along they way didn't help him and he died at 37 after heart surgery.The movie points out the structure of his life, his early show business inspiration, the rough beginnings, his successes, meeting, wooing, and marrying Sandra Dee.  The movie is able to point out the problems in the marriage without becoming dark or making anyone into the bad guy.  Again, the emphasis is on the music and the strains that puts on the human side of being human.Kevin Spacey is clearly too old to play Bobby Darin, but so what?  Who else is going to do it?  He sure does a great job singing the songs and pulling off the spirit of the guy.  To give you an idea of how the story is told, the opening scene has Darin and some guys walking through the kitchen of a club to the stage.  Before he gets there some reporter says to Darin that he is too old to be playing himself.  Darin then goes through the curtains as the announcer introduces him.  Spacey begins singing a great version of ""Mack the Knife"".However, somewhere in the middle of the song, when everything is going strong, he sees a little boy (obviously the young Bobby Darin) looking out through the curtains.  Darin stops singing and it becomes apparent that this isn't a club, but a movie set for an autobiographical picture of Darin.  You can see all the layers and perspectives being set up here.  All of them continue to be used with a few more added throughout the film.  Do not expect a simple narrative or a single voice being used in the film.  There is a lot going on to tell this story and I loved the richness of the thing.  For me, telling it this way gets to the truth of the man a lot more than a simple left to right telling of his life.  Aren't most of us a lot of things trying to be something else again?  Yet, there is a theme to each of us that all those perspectives enrich.Great job.  I enjoyed this far more than I expected to.

Now I was too young to remember Bobby Darin in his prime except for a summer TV variety show he had around 1973.  I'm also not an afficienado of nightclub performers but through Spacey's persuasive direction he has me convinced that Darin elevated this type of performing to an art form.

901089,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00094ARN2,David E. Levine,"[2, 4]","Kevin Spacey acts, directs and sings in this movie about the life of Bobby Darin. The movie starts off in an almost sureal manner as Bobby is singing in a club but then, it turns out that this ""club"" is actually a movie set with Bobby acting as himself in a movie about himself. The young boy, acting as the young Bobby Darin looks on and acts as a backdrop to the entire movie. Spacey's singing is surprisingly good. It is certainly more than passable and he deserves a lot of credit taking that risk because if the attempt had fallen short, the entire movie would have fallen flat on it's face. Instead, Spacey pulled it off.The biggest problem I had was that Spacey is about ten years older than Darin was when he died and a good 20 years older than he was during key parts of the movie. Although Spacey looked like Darin, in subtle ways you could tell he was the middle aged Spacey, not the young Darin. This may be the only drawback to the movie because, quite frankly, Spacey was almost uncanny in the role. I was a fan of Babby Darin and I believe that the movie captures the essence of the Darin that I remember.I see some dramatic license that was taken but, that's OK if it ultimately assists in the telling of the story of the subject's life. Later in life, Darin became a fighter for liberal causes and dropped his flashy club image for a more laid back, jeans wearing, folk singing image. The movie makes it seem as though during this change, he sank nearly to obscurity. In fact, Darin was still in the forefront with a huge folk hit; a recording of Tim Hardin's ""If I Were a Carpenter."" Also, the movie makes it appear that he had a big comeback concert in Las Vegas right before he died. In fact, although short lived, he had a television variety series and he had a fairly extended run in Las Vegas.

901094,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00094ARN2,Deborah Earle,"[2, 5]","I reacted to the announcement that Kevin Spacey was to play Bobby Darin with approval. Although he was about a decade older than the 60s crooner  ever lived to be, and his age showed a bit, Spacey (who successfully won an Oscar whereas Darin was only nominated for one) quite deftly engaged in the art of personification. He looks enough like Darin, although Darin's chin was narrower.Spacey helms an occassionally surreal  account of Darin's life, beginning with a backstage view of  his venue in Las Vegas, during which  the singer takes a detour, and presides over a telling of his own remarkable life story.Newcomer William Ullrich portrays the young Walden Robert Cassotto  (a.k.a Darin's not-so-inner child throughout the course of the film), a child of the Bronx who lives with Nina and Charlie Maffia (Bob Hoskins and Caroline Aaron) and the doting Polly Cassotto (Brenda Blethyn), from whom he inherits his  love of music. It would be years later that the singer would be devastated by the revelation of a  family secret.In the meantime, he builds his reputation as a performer, taking those closest to him along for the ride. He acquires a manger named Steve Blauner(John Goodman), and works his way from seedy nightclubs to more upscale venues. Spacey's recreation of Darin's signature performances  is admirable. One really has to listen hard to be able to differentiate between the original recordings and the reproductions made for this film.Tragedy strikes as Darin's recordings climb the charts. Still, the singer perseveres, making appearances on national televison, winning a Grammy, and beginning a film career, during which he meets America's Golden Girl, Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), with whom he feels he can make  even more beautiful  music if he can lure her away from her  controlling mother, Mary Duvan (Greta Scacchi). Spacey shows impressive dancing skills in the process of getting the girl.Before long, Darin has won his prize, but in an emotional  scene that relies on a viewer's awareness  of Dee's survival of incest, the bride has an anxious moment, which her groom nobly redeems.The Darins have a son named Dodd, and the honeymoon ends soon enough during an Oscar Night brawl in which the couple become violent over incredibly petty issues. One feels dismayed that people who appear to have been given everything in life can't at least behave themselves!Still, as Darin strives towards his goal to play at the Copacabana, one may come to empathize with him since a childhood bout with rheumatic fever weakened his heart, and he knew his time was limted.As the 60s wear on, and social changes ensue, Darin, a politically  conscious entertainer who, earlier helped desegregate a nightclub, struggles to stay relevant. Amid Sandra's  increasing problems with the  bottle, and his being a hands-on Dad to his son, Darin refurbishes his act with songs that are more topical, and makes plans to join Senator Robert Kennedy in his bid for the Presidency.  Nina drops a bombshell on Bobby, regarding his family history (in order to beat the media to the punch), sending him into a tailspin, and he spirals even harder and deeper when RFK is assassinated.In real life, Darin could be be found lying at Kennedy's grave, but the film ignores this. It focuses on  his desertion of his family, his soul-searching, his reconciliation with his family(although it neglects to mention a short-lived second marriage), and  the triumphant revival of his career at the Flamingo in Las Vegas before the curtain prematurely falls...This film may be viewed some as a vanity project, as it was something Kevin Spacey had wanted to do since he and his late mother (to whom the film is lovingly dedicated) were fans of Darin's. He definitely dominates the project, but omits the presence of  Darin's half-sister, Vee, who was with him at the end. But it is an apparent labor of love in which Darin's ex-wife (who happily lived long enough to see the film's release) and son had some input.It does capture the salient points of Darin's life, and it's more than obvious that Spacey had fun playing off of the sassily precocious Ullrich, especally in the final dance number. I feel glad that Spacey's dream came true! He was born to play the part!The child from the Bronx may have died; the legend lives, and through the eyes of a devoted  fan, Bobby Darin is forever swinging at the Flamingo!",5,A Vanity Project?

This turned out to be an economical, and entertaining device that kept the film from slowing down or becoming too heavy with drama and tragedy, which of course punctuates the end of Darin's life, but not of this film's. Spacey simply did not go down the road to death's melo-dramatic door. Instead, he had the movie-within-a-movie device take a detour, and allow the film to end as celebration of Darin's life with yet another tasteful, epic, music video.

This was Kevin Spacey's pet project. Unfortunately, ""Sea"" doesn't manage to be much more than that -- it feels bloodless and overstuffed, and we never get to know any of the people in it.It opens with Darin (Spacey) filming a movie about himself, and generally acting like a diva -- and being interrupted by the specter of himself as a young boy. Cue cringes.His story shoots back to see himself as a critically ill, fatherless child, whose ""mother"" (actually his grandmother) says he'll be bigger than Sinatra. Despite the odds, he becomes a massive star, even shooting a Hollywood movie alongside Rock Hudson and Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth).He marries the beautiful girl after a whirlwind courtship, and after a rocky start, all seems to be going well -- they have a child, wealth, and a beautiful home. But then his ""sister"" reveals that she is his biological mother, and Bobby falls to pieces. Now he sets out to find himself -- as a person, and as a musician.""Beyond the Sea"" is both too long and too short -- it only looks at a few parts of Darin's life, and yet it feels overstuffed. The story itself focuses on only a few aspects of Darin's life, but it pushes them so hard that Darin himself -- and the entirety of his life -- get lost in the muddle.And while some movies could have managed, ""Beyond the Sea"" doesn't. It skips the entire latter half of Darin's life -- divorce, teen idol phase, mother's death, et cetera -- so we can hear more about how Darin was sick as a kid, and how finding out about Mom messed him up forever. The movie feels like a series of unconnected scenes that are strung together on those plot threads.Worse, Spacey is a very awkward writer/director -- that horribly Broadway-style opener proves it. There are a few good moments, like Darin dedicating a song to his mother. But most of the movie is awkward or even laughable, such as the scene where Darin does his ""knight of Camelot"" routine in the bedroom. I dare you not to laugh at that -- or at seriously delivered lines like, ""Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what we will.""Despite his directorial shortcomings, Spacey makes a decent Darin -- he has some onstage charisma, and he sings nicely, and does a tolerable job in most of the other scenes. He even includes Darin's snipey behavior (""Let me tell you something, blondie, you're not exactly Audrey Hepburn!""). But Bosworth seems to be sleepwalking in her role, and the ""young Bobby"" is simply awful.""Beyond the Sea"" could have been a good movie, even with the awkward direction. But in the end, it fails to do one important thing: Tell us about Bobby Darin's life.",2,Beyond and under,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,2723,"['Sea', 'opened', 'same', 'year', 'bio-pic', 'classic', 'musical', 'talent', 'De', 'Lovely', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'pet', 'project', 'Unfortunately', 'Sea', ""n't"", 'manage', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'bloodless', 'overstuffed', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'it.It', 'opens', 'Darin', 'Spacey', 'filming', 'movie', 'generally', 'acting', 'diva', 'being', 'interrupted', 'specter', 'young', 'boy', 'Cue', 'cringes.His', 'story', 'shoots', 'back', 'see', 'critically', 'ill', 'fatherless', 'child', 'mother', 'actually', 'grandmother', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bigger', 'Sinatra', 'odds', 'massive', 'star', 'even', 'shooting', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'alongside', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', '.He', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'whirlwind', 'courtship', 'rocky', 'start', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'have', 'child', 'wealth', 'beautiful', 'home', 'then', 'sister', 'reveals', 'biological', 'mother', 'Bobby', 'pieces', 'Now', 'out', 'find', 'person', 'musician', 'Sea', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'Darin', 'life', 'yet', 'overstuffed', 'story', 'only', 'few', 'aspects', 'Darin', 'life', 'so', 'hard', 'Darin', 'entirety', 'life', 'get', 'lost', 'muddle.And', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'managed', 'Sea', ""n't"", 'entire', 'latter', 'half', 'Darin', 'life', 'divorce', 'teen', 'idol', 'phase', 'mother', 'death', 'et', 'cetera', 'can', 'hear', 'more', 'how', 'Darin', 'was', 'sick', 'kid', 'how', 'finding', 'out', 'Mom', 'messed', 'up', 'forever', 'movie', 'feels', 'series', 'unconnected', 'scenes', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'plot', 'threads.Worse', 'Spacey', 'very', 'awkward', 'writer/director', 'horribly', 'Broadway-style', 'opener', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'Darin', 'dedicating', 'song', 'mother', 'most', 'movie', 'awkward', 'even', 'laughable', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Darin', 'knight', 'Camelot', 'routine', 'bedroom', 'dare', 'not', 'laugh', 'seriously', 'delivered', 'lines', 'Memories', 'are', 'moonbeams', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'directorial', 'shortcomings', 'Spacey', 'decent', 'Darin', 'onstage', 'charisma', 'nicely', 'tolerable', 'job', 'most', 'other', 'scenes', 'even', 'Darin', 'snipey', 'behavior', 'Let', 'tell', 'something', 'blondie', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Bosworth', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'role', 'young', 'Bobby', 'simply', 'awful', 'Sea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'awkward', 'direction', 'end', 'do', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'Tell', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'life']",N/A
901103,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00094ARN2,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[6, 10]","I love Kevin Spacey. He'e made some pretty great movies like ""American Beauty,"" and ""The Life of David Gale."" Now he's back, in front of, and in back of the camera in ""Beyond the Sea,"" which is the life story of Bobby Darrin. Alot of biography movies have been coming out this year, and most of them about music. There was the Ray Charles movie, ""Ray,"" the Cole Porter movie, ""De-Lovely,"" and it wasn't about music, but the Howard Hughes movie ""The Aviator."" I have to say that ""Beyond the Sea"" is the worst, but it continues to prove that Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor. He does save the movie. I love Bobby Darrin, and throughout the film I could feel my head, and many others, bobbing to the music. Kevin Spacey did his own singing for the film, and he is almost as good as Darrin, but not better.  I was very upset that I didn't like the film, because I was looking forward to it. It looked promising, but it's main problem was that nothing that it did quite worked with the flow. It kept changing moods. It also didn't give us a look at the real Bobby Darrin. We only get to see one side of him, and that's the side that we like. We never see him as a person, and just this carefree, fun guy, so that in the end when he dies, you don't care, because it's like when a background character dies in a war movie.The movie is told as if Bobby Darrin was making a movie about his life, playing himself. He talks to himself as a child for ideas, and the story starts when he was a child. His mother, Polly, is talking to the doctor, and finds out that he has a heart problem, and he'll be lucking if he lives past his 15th birthday. He passes that age, and every day he lives makes him more and more of a medical marvel. His mother teaches him to play the piano, and sing, and soon he is preforming on the stage in nightclubs, always striving to do better. It's when he decides to make movies where he meets Sandra Dee, played well by the cute Kate Bosworth. He puts it in his mind that he is going to marry her, so he decides to charm the mother before he charms her. She falls in love with him, and they are soon engaged, much to the dismay of her mother. Soon, his own mother dies, and then he learns of a secret from his sister Nina, and her husband Charlie. Bobby always wants more, and he's nominated for an Oscar Award, gets tons of songs number one on the charts, and is one of the most celebrated musicians in the world, but he still wants more, and he doesn't stop until he gets it.I'm not the kind of person that usually notes this, because I hate when people do. When ""Troy,"" came out, which I liked, and ""Alexander"" which I didn't, all I heard from history teachers was that it wasn't what actually happened. Of course everything in the movie didn't happen, it's a movie, but Bobby Darrin actually divorced Sandra Dee years before he died, and was remarried and seprated right before he did. The movie doesn't talk about this at all, and at the end when they recap all the characters, it states that Sandra Dee is still alive and loves Bobby Darrin to this day. Not only is that probably untrue, but it is also one of the most overused, cliche, mock ""happy"" endings that I've ever seen. I rolled my eyes at that even before I learned about that information.What ""Beyond the Sea"" tried to do was give the movie that old musical feel. I recently saw ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and loved it. What made all the overacting, and lavish set/costume design, and big musical numbers work, was that when Gene Kelly was splashing around in the puddles, and when Donald O' Conner was playing with a giant doll and crashing through brick walls, it all served a purpose. When Kevin Spacey grabs the suitcase that was thrown at him from his mother to go run down the street with everybody in the town waving at him, it didn't serve a purpose but to be fun and light, and it was pretty stupid. And then it went from this jovial, brightly colored, musical drama, and then it turned into this drama where Bobby is trying to ""find himself."" Most of the scenes didn't work. For instance, when Bobby and Charlie are walking into someplace, Nina is yelling at the limo driver because she dropped her suitcases. It's trying to be funny, but it's just annoying. As much as I love Kevin Spacey, his acting and singing couldn't get this movie past two stars, and it's going to be towards the bottom of my worst movies of the year list. Worth seeing on video for the singing though. I didn't like it, but you might.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for some strong language and a scene of sensuality.",2,Spacey Saves the Film!,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,4566,"['love', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'e', 'made', 'pretty', 'great', 'movies', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'Now', 'back', 'front', 'back', 'camera', 'Sea', 'life', 'story', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'Alot', 'biography', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'movie', 'Ray', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'movie', 'De-Lovely', 'was', ""n't"", 'music', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'movie', 'Aviator', 'have', 'say', 'Sea', 'worst', 'prove', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'amazing', 'actor', 'save', 'movie', 'love', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'film', 'could', 'feel', 'head', 'many', 'others', 'bobbing', 'music', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Darrin', 'not', 'better', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'looked', 'promising', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'nothing', 'did', 'quite', 'worked', 'flow', 'kept', 'changing', 'moods', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'look', 'real', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'side', 'side', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'person', 'just', 'carefree', 'fun', 'guy', 'end', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'background', 'character', 'war', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'told', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'life', 'playing', 'child', 'ideas', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'mother', 'Polly', 'talking', 'doctor', 'out', 'heart', 'problem', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lucking', '15th', 'birthday', 'age', 'day', 'more', 'more', 'medical', 'marvel', 'mother', 'play', 'piano', 'sing', 'soon', 'preforming', 'stage', 'nightclubs', 'always', 'striving', 'do', 'better', 'when', 'make', 'movies', 'where', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'played', 'well', 'cute', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'mind', 'going', 'marry', 'charm', 'mother', 'love', 'are', 'soon', 'engaged', 'much', 'dismay', 'mother', 'Soon', 'own', 'mother', 'dies', 'then', 'secret', 'sister', 'Nina', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'Bobby', 'always', 'more', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Award', 'tons', 'songs', 'number', 'one', 'charts', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'musicians', 'world', 'still', 'more', ""n't"", 'stop', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'usually', 'hate', 'when', 'people', 'do', 'When', 'Troy', 'came', 'out', 'liked', 'Alexander', 'did', ""n't"", 'heard', 'history', 'teachers', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'course', 'everything', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movie', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'actually', 'divorced', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'years', 'died', 'was', 'remarried', 'seprated', 'right', 'did', 'movie', ""n't"", 'talk', 'end', 'when', 'recap', 'characters', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'still', 'alive', 'Bobby', 'Darrin', 'day', 'Not', 'only', 'probably', 'untrue', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'overused', 'cliche', 'mock', 'happy', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'even', 'learned', 'Sea', 'tried', 'do', 'was', 'give', 'movie', 'old', 'musical', 'feel', 'recently', 'saw', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'loved', 'What', 'made', 'overacting', 'lavish', 'set/costume', 'design', 'big', 'musical', 'numbers', 'work', 'was', 'when', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'was', 'splashing', 'around', 'puddles', 'when', 'Donald', 'O', 'Conner', 'was', 'playing', 'giant', 'doll', 'crashing', 'brick', 'walls', 'served', 'purpose', 'When', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'grabs', 'suitcase', 'was', 'thrown', 'mother', 'go', 'run', 'down', 'street', 'everybody', 'town', 'waving', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'purpose', 'be', 'fun', 'light', 'was', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'then', 'went', 'jovial', 'brightly', 'colored', 'musical', 'drama', 'then', 'turned', 'drama', 'where', 'Bobby', 'trying', 'find', 'Most', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'instance', 'when', 'Bobby', 'Charlie', 'are', 'walking', 'someplace', 'Nina', 'yelling', 'limo', 'driver', 'dropped', 'suitcases', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'annoying', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'acting', 'singing', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'going', 'be', 'bottom', 'worst', 'movies', 'year', 'list', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'video', 'singing', 'did', ""n't"", 'might.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'strong', 'language', 'scene', 'sensuality']",N/A

Here, Kevin Spacey proves that he sure is no Clint Eastwood.Spacey does a competent job singing and acting, it's just his direction that makes this film embarassingly dull.  The musical numbers quickly become repetitive and pointless, adding nothing to character or plot development---in fact, the most engaging part of the film is the last 1/3 when we see Darin taking a long break from performing as he tries to ""find himself.""If you are going to have musical numbers that stand on their own as opposed to helping the character and plot develop, you'd better have some truly spectacular singing and dancing, which we simply don't get.  While Spacey tries his best to project showbiz charisma, he remains a hard-working amateur and the actual songs he does are not all that great either except for maybe ""Mack the Knife.""The storyline is ridiculously trite: poor sickly boy overcomes the odds through sweat and grit to become a smashing success, then (gasp!) is swallowed up by fame and somehow loses touch with himself.  Characters are mainly two-dimensional, with very mechanical and contrived growth.  Kate Bosworth provides some much needed eye-candy to distract us from the dead script, it's too bad she doesn't get more camera time.

901105,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00094ARN2,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","You have to give Kevin Spacey a lot of credit for the cajones he displays here. Star, director, producer, co-writer, and of course, singer and dancer...he makes Barbra Streisand look like a relative shrinking violet in her comparably mammoth, multi-hyphenated self-production, 1983's ""Yentl"". Both movies share something rather unique, the intensive arm-wrestling match between the purity of a singular artistic vision and the towering supremacy of an equally individualistic ego. Neither side fully dominates, but such efforts cannot help but be fascinating to watch. On the surface, this film appears to be a biopic of the late entertainer Bobby Darin, but the movie is really about Spacey's obsession with Darin, a key distinction of which one needs to be aware to derive any sort of enjoyment here. Why else would he cast himself in the role when he is obviously at least fifteen years too old for it? He even acknowledges this fact in a cheeky scene-within-a-scene of a fictitious film the actors are making of Darin's life in the film.Once I accepted the actor's unyielding tenacity in the role, it became easier to accept him as Darin, a personality familiar to any baby boomer who can recall his movies and TV appearances up until his death at 37 in 1973. Yet the memory of his impact, unlike that of Ray Charles', has faded considerably, and consequently, Spacey eclipses the performer he portrays, perhaps unintentionally. It's an odd dynamic that works to the story's detriment. Regardless, Spacey's idolatry of Darin is clear in every shot, and he proves to be an excellent singer who does a fine job approximating Darin's vocal style. Spacey also dances with surprising &eacute;lan in some kitschy musical sequences that are fun to watch and brings the whole Hollywood-meets-Vegas pizzazz to the foreground (I frankly don't recall Darin dancing so Gene Kelly-like in his career). At the same time, they also emphasize the contrived method Spacey has chosen to tell Darin's story as a series of real-life episodes interlaced with fanciful speculation. And even though Darin was known for his braggadocio, the more elliptical Spacey seems more on the verge of intolerable smugness about his considerable talent. Intriguingly, his eerie physical resemblance to the late-sixties Darin is actually quite startling, both physically and temperamentally, and this is the most resonant portion of the movie because the effort to dazzle has been put on the back burner. Yet again, Spacey does not leave well enough alone and reverts back to a Vegas-style fantasy when he ends the film.Kate Bosworth is convincingly winsome and conflicted as Darin's first wife, actress Sandra Dee, though the film idealizes their love story to the point of dismissing their divorce and minimizing her problems with alcohol and anorexia (sadly Dee died earlier this year). Grade-A actors have been cast in supporting roles but given little more than broad strokes to brush here - John Goodman as Darin's put-upon manager Steve Blauner, Bob Hoskins as blindly loyal brother-in-law Charlie, Caroline Aaron overly blowsy as sister Nina, Brenda Blethyn convincingly American as showbiz mama Polly and Greta Scacchi looking surprisingly aged as Dee's mother Mary. To Spacey's immense credit, there is nothing remotely lazy about this production as he makes the Berlin and England locations look credibly like California, New York and Italy.

You can see Spacey's love for Darin and appreciation for what he achieved in his short life throughout this film.  If anything, I would have liked to see more about the latter part of his life, although that was clearly not the most joyous time.In addition to Spacey, the acting is very good from every member of the cast.  William Ullrich is particularly fun to watch as the Young Bobby Darin, and anyone who ever saw Sandra Dee ""act"" will appreciate Kate Bosworth's ability to come across just as numb and clueless on screen as the real thing.  And the Spacey dance sequences paying homage to the goofy dancing that often popped up for no reason in musicals and other films of the '50s and '60s displays his sophisticated sense of humor and quiet sarcasm.Now, if you're a huge fan of Bobby Darin and own every album or movie he ever made, this is probably not your movie.  After all, it really is just a movie, and Spacey is not going to BE Darin any more than Jimmy Stewart was Glenn Miller.  But if you've liked a few of Darin's songs, yet never really knew much about him, this is a great way to learn more while enjoying an unusual performance by one of our time's best actors, and several others.I'm a little disappointed by the DVD itself, though, in that I think it should have more ""extras"" to look at after the film.  While I'm not usually one who watches those things, in this case I was left looking for more.  There is an interview with Spacey about his appreciation for Darin and some clips from the filming of the movie, which are both nice.  But sadly missing, perhaps to avoid a DIRECT comparison, is the real Bobby Darin himself.  After all, this is not Napoleon or some other person from hundreds of years ago...there's plenty of footage of Bobby Darin available and it would have been nice, upon finishing the movie, to see a few clips of the real guy, if only to appreciate what a great job Spacey did in re-creating him.Overall, this is a fun and well-executed DVD that's well worth buying.

901116,AG6NBC3NLVVJ,B00094ARN2,Gubben,"[9, 13]","Kevin Spacey is a great actor. Okay that said now on to Beyond the Sea his (first that I know of) directorial debut.  My attention slid within the first scene when we are presented with Darin performing for a night club audience which is not really a night club and what we are watching is surreal re-enactment of Darin's life directed by Darin with the support of his family (or at least the actors that play his family).  Not confused yet?  The scene is interrupted by Spacey as Darin seeing what turns out to be a boy age Darin peeking from a curtain (a motif used several times in this movie). Young Darin is so much wiser for some reason and pops up at key times in old Darin's life or at least the retelling of it with advice. There are 1950's musical Gene Kelly style dance numbers that are throwaway and just prolong the film. I wont go into the miscasting here, this is a vanity project beyond all vanity projects but I will say Spaceys heart is in every scene. The big bombshell dropped late in the movie involving who Darin's real mother is will not be a surprise to any of Darins fans therefore the emotional impact of this plot twist is null.Beyond the Sea may remind you of Bob Fosse's ""All that Jazz"" which Fosse' wrote and directed. Jazz has fantasy scenes, musical numbers which seem natural as well as dreamlike over the top and tacky. But with Jazz you know the difference between fantasy and reality something that Beyond the Sea doesn't seem to care about.

901117,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B00094ARN2,Guy De Federicis,"[7, 13]","This film starts off on the wrong foot and gets worse as it dances along. Amazingly ill-conceived drama gives us the free-wheeling, care-free public image of Bobby Darin in enormity, but offers little insight into the man behind the celebrity, as if Darin's press agent was still working for a dead man.  Almost immediately, ""Beyond The Sea"" ventures into a surreal world, a lot like Roy Scheider talking to his dead Mom in ""All That Jazz"", and retains that effect, remaining cold and detatched from the subject at hand as a result. The script is almost dismally bad, cutting through glossy Hollywood bio cliches (Mom dies), and weak uninvolving situations, (married to 'Gidget' Sandra Dee with much less adventurous romance than found in a Gidget movie), just so Kevin Spacey as Darin, can sing and dance, neither of which, it seems to me, he does very well, the singing particularly, like your average guy deluded into believing in his vocal prowess due to the echo in the shower stall.Time lines zip by; the Vietnam War, death of Robert Kenndy Jr., a change in popular music's taste, as if rushing us to a big conclusion while John Goodman, as Darin's manager keeps popping his head in doorways, serving as some kind of time signature; ""Bobby, you're playing the Copa."", ""Bobby, you're nominated for an Oscar."", ""Bobby, your toupee needs straightening."" It seems Mr. Spacey who also wrote, directed and produced ""Beyond The Sea', would be content to scrap the entire bio, and instead put on a Bobby Darin impersonation night club routine. He could sing and dance to his heart's desire, but eventually somebody (young) would come along and do it better. He could then recite the movie's thematic quote, repeated in the film, - ""Memories are like moon beams. It's up to you what to do with them."" Not very heavy.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 3]","IN A NUTSHELL: ""YOU HEAR WHAT YOU SEE"" -- Sandra DeeKevin Spacey Co-wrote, Directed, Starred, and sang an enormously well done tribute to the life of Bobby Darin. Spacey utilized a somewhat novel technique of non-linear storytelling, by simply telling a story-within-a-story, and having two Bobby Darins, [young and adult] giving their deliberately narcissistic perspectives [as interpreted by Spacey], and thereby adding insight to the scenes.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: STYLE - PACE - ENTERTAINMENT & TRUTHA combination of depth and a fast pace, was established by Spacey, by turning to a collection of stylized epic musical videos, of sight and song, to depict movement and change as Darin's life progresses. This turned out to be an economical, and entertaining device that kept the film from slowing down or becoming too heavy with drama and tragedy, which of course punctuates the end of Darin's life, but not of this film's. Spacey simply did not go down the road to death's melo-dramatic door. Instead, he had the movie-within-a-movie device take a detour, and allow the film to end as celebration of Darin's life with yet another tasteful, epic, music video. This effectively avoided the excessive sadness that inevitably permeates the later scenes of most biopics, since inevitably the star dies and/or fades, but Spacey adroitly avoided this, and it is for many, a pleasant surprise.THE CAST:Kevin Spacey  - Bobby DarinKate Bosworth  - Sandra Dee - turns in a solid honest performanceJohn Goodman  - Steve Blauner - excellent strong side-kickBob Hoskins  - Charlie Cassotto Maffia - always there for BobbyBrenda Blethyn  - Polly Cassotto - Bobby's motherGreta Scacchi  - Mary Duvan - Sandra Dee's domineering stage-motherWilliam Ullrich  - Little Bobby - Excellent foil for the adult BobbyAWARDS:Best Soundtrack (nom)  2004  Broadcast Film Critics AssociationBest Young Actor (nom)  William Ullrich  2004  Broadcast Film Critics AssociationBest Actor - Comedy or Musical (nom)  Kevin Spacey  2004  Golden GlobeABOUT THE DVD: I WISH THERE WERE MORE FEATURES ABOUT DARIN'S LIFEThere is a short featurette with Spacey and members of the cast, but this film needed more due to the heaviness of the topic and the personal interest that was rekindled in Darin by this film.BOTTOM LINE: A FILM THAT MAKES ONE WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BOBBY DARIN!Spacey was sensational, and the entire cast really shined. The soundtrack that Spacey did, standing in for Darin, was both awesome and accurate.

901126,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00094ARN2,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[4, 6]","Kevin Spacey's biopic of Bobby Darin, ""Beyond The Sea""  may not go down in the annals of film history as a great classic, but it is movie made with lots of heart. Mr. Spacey, an obvious fan of Mr. Darin's, not only co-wrote the screenplay with Lewis Colick, he produced, directed and stars in this longtime project. The job he does is a worthy one, and I vigorously applaud him for his achievement. It is clear that his efforts to bring the life of the versatile performer and vocalist to the big screen are indeed a labor of love. Spacey's background research is extraordinary. Apparently, he was given the full cooperation of Bobby Darin's estate, getting permission to do the covers for Darin's songs, which Spacey also sings. I have to say, as a major admirer of Kevin Spacey, (""The Life of David Gale,"" American Beauty,"" ""Pay It Forward,"" ""The Usual Suspects,"" etc.), that I never realized he could sing and dance...and do the job well!Spacey physically resembles Darin in the film. He has the performing style down pat, and plays a remarkably credible nightclub entertainer too. Most importantly, Bobby Darin, pop artist as well as the man he was off-stage, are indeed brought to life in ""Beyond The Sea."" Are there flaws? Absolutely! However, Darin's talent, drive, energy and ambition are evident through Kevin Spacey's fabulous, energetic portrayal.Born Walden Robert Cassotto, in 1936, to a poor, working-class family in the Bronx, NY, Bobby was a frail child. He contracted rheumatic fever at age eight, and the disease left him with a seriously diseased heart. The doctor predicted he would die by the time he reached sixteen, and although he obviously did not, he lived with the constant knowledge that his life might end at any moment. Driven by poverty and continuing poor health, he possessed an innate talent for music. Encourage by his mother Polly, (Brenda Blethyn), a veteran vaudeville performer, he could play several musical instruments by the time he was a teen, and belt out a song with the best of them. His ambition was to be better than Sinatra and to play the Copacabana nightclub. He certainly did play at the Copa, many times, to sell-out crowds. As far as being better than Sinatra....well no, not to me. But does it matter? He was terrific as Bobby Darin!Rock and roll was at its prime in the late 1950's when Darin released a song he wrote himself, ""Splish-Splash."" It became an instant hit, selling more than one million records. Shortly afterward his ballad ""Dream Lover,"" topped the charts - one of my own favorites. And than came his jazz-pop interpretation of ""Mack the Knife,"" from Kurt Weil's ""Three Penny Opera."" Darin's music career soared, and he was offered movie roles - not as a vocalist, but as a serious actor, and met his wife, Sandra Dee while filming ""Come September."" He was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role in ""Captain Newman, M.D."" with Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson.The film begins as a movie within a movie. Darin appears onstage. It looks like he is directing an autobiographical motion picture. He begins to sing ""Mack The Knife."" Then he calls ""Cut,"" and discusses with the child who plays him as a young boy, (a super performance by William Ullrich), how the story would best be told from a cinematic perspective. Darin follows the boys advice. There is a drum roll - and the audience is taken back to the Bronx, where it all began. The opening montages, with the musical song and dance numbers on New York City streets, are wonderful, and campy. Throughout, there are flashbacks, with the older Darin making comments on his life in present time. The issue of Spacey's age is addressed up front, and for me age was no issue at all. Spacey is Darin, at any and all ages. Darin's admiring brother-in-law, Charlie (Bob Hoskins) asks, ""How can you be too old to play yourself?""The supporting cast is very good, but the focus is on Darin 90 percent of the time. Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, Bobby's teen bride and Hollywood star, does an excellent job of portraying the sheltered, naive actress, who panics on her wedding night. Her decline from successful ingenue, to disappointed, alcoholic has-been by age twenty-six is quite moving. John Goodman as Darin's best friend and manager, Steve Blauner, is good, as is Greta Scacchi as Sandra Dee's overbearing mother - but their parts are minimal. Darin's much older sister, Nina (Caroline Aaron), overacts, at times grotesquely, and this is a shame, as her connection with her brother is an extremely important one. However, her husband, Charlie Maffia, (Hoskins), brings tremendous warmth to the production.Darin is not whitewashed here. We are shown his demons as well as all the good stuff. I was a Darin fan, but not as big a one as Kevin Spacey. However, after watching the film, I began to think about the performer and admire him more. He died at such a young age, 37, that he had little time to make his mark upon the world. Yet, he certainly did so. I say Bravo to all those involved in making the movie. You bring Bobby's name and achievements to the fore 32 years after his death. Sandra Dee also died young, in February, 2005. Both Bobby and Sandra are survived by their son, Dodd, his wife and two children.""Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what we want,"" says Bobby Darin in ""Beyond the Sea."" I haven't thought of him in years, but thanks to Kevin Spacey I am thinking about him now - and even listening to one of his CDs as I type.JANA",4,"""Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what

901127,A1M3DUQIYFUPJD,B00094ARN2,"J. Birch ""softwolf4""","[3, 5]","Well, my wife & I went to see BTS in Annapolis, MD on 12/30/04 (her Birthday). We were the only ones in the theater (10:20pm showing).I would have to honestly say that for a movie we've been waiting about 5 yrs to see, it was a dissapointment. We have been BD fans for years and years, and we have followed all of the hype to a degree, but I think you will find this an honest and sincere, objective and unbiased review. [Note that when I say unbiased, I mean that I was not only happy that Spacey took on the role, but actually sort-of ""prophesied"" it about 18 months before his name was ever mentioned in relation to it, saying to my wife that he would be brilliant for the part for many many reasons] This review does delve into the movie itself, so if you want to wait until you've seen it to hear about it, discontinue reading.The dissapointment we have in is the whole fantasy aspect of the film. Rather than just simply tell (dramatize) the story, they involved too much embroidery and I guess what some would call ""showmanship."" It was really sad because first you're drop- kicked in the middle of ""Mack"" with the interruption and find that it's an auto- biographical, fictional (re)telling of Bobbo's life (my wife & I lovingly refer to him as Bobbo), and then you have the kid, and within minutes of the beginning, we had quickly realised the movie was not merely embellished with fantasy, but actually *founded* on fantasy. The whole area of Bobby growing up really encapsulated the flaws of the movie in general; so much was left out (the small bands he played in, the ""bongo lady,"" etc) and yet added in was all this stuff with Polly and the piano and the big crazy technicolor dance sequence. Where there was fantasy-based fluff, there could well have been substance.There was way too much focus on ""the kid"" (please understand I'm referring to him now as the character in the movie, not as young BD himself, hardcore BD fans, please don't be offended) and so many things left out. Where were the recording sessions? Where were the relationships with the close band members? Where were the TV appearances (like David Frost), and even his own show? Where was Connie Francis, not to mention the ""other women"" in his life?My wife and I discussed the movie throughout our entire hour-long drive home, and my summation is this: when all of Bobby Darin is done and said and told, it is not so much about his relationships or his family (which all needs to be there, don't get me wrong), but what it's about is the wonderful body of work he gave us: the records, the movies, the appearances, and it's all about him overcoming *so* many obstacles simply to dowhat??? To leave us so happy and entertained by what he did and at the same time inspired that he gave it everything he had. So to me, I would have preferred more about the achievements and the actual body of work he lovingly produced - whereas all I saw of that was a bit of Artificial Flowers (in the studio) and some posters & record covers (all with Spacey rather than the originals with Darin, a neat touch). And even those were gone in a few seconds.A few minor things that irked me were; the fact that young Dodd has almost no lines whatsoever, he was just this mute boy peering around doors and so forth... and if I'm not mistaken John Goodman has an ""accent"" (so to speak) in the opening scene in the film that is never heard again. I also feel a lot of the coarse language was unecessary in order to tell the story.There were nice touches as well - one wordless thing that spoke volumes was when Charlie visited Bobbo at the trailer and asked was he okay, and Spacey just shook his head no. That to me encapsulated the whole feeling of his ""sabbatical."" Nina was probably one of the best-performed roles in the film I would have to say. I of course liked how they treated the songs and also as well the songs they chose (though I could certainly list off some more that would have been appropriate, beginning with ""Once In A Lifetime""). I say this, meaning of course to exclude the fantasy numbers with Polly &/or the young Darin, which we ourselves skip over on the soundtrack.I suppose that's it. I'm sure you have about 80 gajillion BTS reviews to choose from, and I just pray mine is one of the more objective ones. Please understand; I'm *glad* this movie has been made! I would not discourage people from seeing it at all, but if they were a fellow fan I would caution them to be prepared for the fantasy aspect.If you're looking for a really good way to get a feel for the life and times of Bobby Darin, I would suggest you start not necessarily with this movie, but with the Rhino 4-CD box set ""As Long As I'm Singing."" It covers Bobby's career quite well, from early rock&roller;, to swinger, to folk singer and back again.Thank You -God Bless You -James",3,"Don't Miss It, But Ticket-Buyer Beware!",1104537600,"01 1,

Kevin Spacey may have been a bit to mature to play the role but Bobby always looked older than he was and Spacey really was into the role. You can tell this was a labor of love for Spacey. I liked that level of feeling. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Some may say the plot played like a B movie or was to melodramatic but Bobby Darin was all that in life. Probably more so than even portrayed here. I also liked the occasional flashback / surrealistic approach as well.

901129,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B00094ARN2,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[13, 15]","Passion often leads to risk, and for Hollywood, nothing is as risky as a big screen biography. Which hasn't swayed or even stopped investors from fueling such recent passion plays as Oliver Stone's Alexander and Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, both larger-than-life portraits of pioneering pundits.Then there's Beyond The Sea, actor-director Kevin Spacey's belated Valentine to crooner Bobby Darin, a small film featuring a passionate, larger-than-life performance by Spacey which transcends the customary Lifetime three-hanky flashback.Talk about taking risks, pitching a film about a modestly successful singer-actor more remembered for marrying perpetual teen sweetheart Sandra Dee than for his catalog of songs or best supporting actor Oscar nomination. Anyone under 30 is probably more familiar with Steve Martin's spoof of Mack the Knife than Darin's chart topper.And quite frankly, isn't Spacey, making his debut behind the camera, a tad too old to be playing a young Bobby Darin? Isn't that like asking audiences to not only suspend disbelief, but don rose colored glasses? How much petroleum jelly can they smear on a camera lens before you start losing all resemblance of shape?Then Spacey does something brilliant. He knows he's too old to be playing a twenty-something playboy. So instead of bathing us in a cinematic fountain of youth, Spacey comes right out and admits that he's too old to be playing a young Bobby Darin. It's like acknowledging that hideous wart on the lunch lady's face. Once you come to terms with its existence, it's no longer an issue.So when Beyond the Sea opens, we find Spacey, playing Darin, playing a younger version of himself in a film biography. Darin comes face-to-face with his inner-child, a kid who questions his motives, exposes his warts. When self-doubt begins to consume him, Darin asks a friend if he's too old to play the part. The friend reassures him that he's Bobby Darin, who better to play the part?Once Spacey gets that out of his system, he becomes Darin, guiding us through an abbreviated tour of the performer's short albeit electric life. Darin has been a lifelong Spacey passion, and Spacey plays him passionately. From his humble beginnings to his meteoric rise in the recording and movie industries, Darin's life was ripe for drama and melodrama. Writers Lewis Colick and Spacey avoid painting Darin as a Patron Saint of Pop Singers, briefly but effectively exploring the inner demons that haunted many performers of his era.Darin's rise to prominence, both as a singer and an actor, came just before the war in Vietnam and the radical shift in popular entertainment. Just as he was beginning to enjoy the security of success, his star started to fade. A pervasive heart condition and continued career rejection eventually took their toll on Darin, but not before making inroads back into the music business.Spacey is quite engaging as Darin, affecting not only his mannerisms, but his stage presence. Once we accept Spacey as Darin, rarely do we see anyone else on the screen. Even Spacey's vocals resonate with authenticity, whether he's singing on stage or pursuing Sandra Dee through the streets of Rome. Of all the cinematic flourishes Spacey heaps on Beyond the Sea, incorporating Darin's songs into full-blown movie musical moments is my favorite.Remember that moment in Living Out Loud, when Holly Hunter, dancing by herself at a nightclub, is joined by two women, and before you know it everyone on the floor is doing the exact same moves? That's what Spacey accomplishes in Beyond the Sea. Just when we think we're in for a stuffy biography about another Rat Pack-era singer, Beyond the Sea breaks out into song and dance.Having Bobby Darin sing Beyond the Seas as he chases down and courts Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) while shooting a film in Rome not only rocks, it makes sense within the context of the film. Darin's life was filled with music, from his early childhood to his last breath, so Spacey and Colick wisely assimilate the songs as part of the overall milieu.That spares us from having to sit through a bunch of unnecessary concert performances, allowing Spacey to pursue other avenues of Darin's life. Bosworth is stunning as Dee, young, pure, almost innocent, a facade that is quickly shattered. Spacey surrounds himself with a cast of sturdy players, including Bob Hoskins as Darin's brother-in-law, John Goodman as his agent, Brenda Blethyn as his mother, and an extremely sympathetic Caroline Aaron as his sister.I'm not sure who the target audience for Beyond the Sea is. It's a vanity project, but it's not one done in vain. It's funny, engaging, gorgeous to look at and dishes enough information to give it weight.",4,BEYOND IS SEAWORTHY,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,4710,"['Passion', 'often', 'risk', 'Hollywood', 'nothing', 'as', 'risky', 'big', 'screen', 'biography', 'Which', ""n't"", 'swayed', 'even', 'stopped', 'investors', 'fueling', 'such', 'recent', 'passion', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Aviator', 'larger-than-life', 'portraits', 'pioneering', 'pundits.Then', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'actor-director', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'belated', 'Valentine', 'crooner', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'small', 'film', 'featuring', 'passionate', 'larger-than-life', 'performance', 'Spacey', 'customary', 'Lifetime', 'three-hanky', 'flashback.Talk', 'taking', 'risks', 'pitching', 'film', 'modestly', 'successful', 'singer-actor', 'more', 'remembered', 'marrying', 'perpetual', 'teen', 'sweetheart', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'catalog', 'songs', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Anyone', '30', 'probably', 'more', 'familiar', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'spoof', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'Darin', 'chart', 'quite', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'Spacey', 'making', 'debut', 'camera', 'tad', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Darin', ""n't"", 'like', 'asking', 'audiences', 'not', 'only', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'don', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'How', 'much', 'petroleum', 'jelly', 'can', 'smear', 'camera', 'start', 'losing', 'resemblance', 'shape', 'Then', 'Spacey', 'something', 'brilliant', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'twenty-something', 'playboy', 'So', 'instead', 'bathing', 'cinematic', 'fountain', 'youth', 'Spacey', 'right', 'admits', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'acknowledging', 'hideous', 'wart', 'lunch', 'lady', 'face', 'come', 'terms', 'existence', 'no', 'longer', 'issue.So', 'when', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'opens', 'find', 'Spacey', 'playing', 'Darin', 'playing', 'younger', 'version', 'film', 'biography', 'Darin', 'face-to-face', 'inner-child', 'kid', 'who', 'questions', 'motives', 'warts', 'When', 'self-doubt', 'consume', 'Darin', 'friend', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'friend', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'who', 'better', 'play', 'part', 'Once', 'Spacey', 'system', 'Darin', 'guiding', 'abbreviated', 'tour', 'performer', 'short', 'albeit', 'electric', 'life', 'Darin', 'been', 'lifelong', 'Spacey', 'passion', 'Spacey', 'passionately', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'recording', 'movie', 'industries', 'Darin', 'life', 'was', 'ripe', 'drama', 'melodrama', 'Writers', 'Lewis', 'Colick', 'Spacey', 'avoid', 'painting', 'Darin', 'Patron', 'Saint', 'Pop', 'Singers', 'briefly', 'effectively', 'exploring', 'inner', 'demons', 'haunted', 'many', 'performers', 'era.Darin', 'rise', 'prominence', 'singer', 'actor', 'came', 'just', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'radical', 'shift', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'Just', 'was', 'beginning', 'enjoy', 'security', 'success', 'star', 'started', 'fade', 'pervasive', 'heart', 'condition', 'continued', 'career', 'rejection', 'eventually', 'took', 'toll', 'Darin', 'not', 'making', 'inroads', 'back', 'music', 'business.Spacey', 'quite', 'engaging', 'Darin', 'affecting', 'not', 'only', 'mannerisms', 'stage', 'presence', 'accept', 'Spacey', 'Darin', 'rarely', 'do', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'screen', 'Even', 'Spacey', 'vocals', 'resonate', 'authenticity', 'singing', 'stage', 'pursuing', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'streets', 'Rome', 'cinematic', 'flourishes', 'Spacey', 'heaps', 'Sea', 'incorporating', 'Darin', 'songs', 'full-blown', 'movie', 'musical', 'moments', 'favorite.Remember', 'moment', 'Living', 'Out', 'Loud', 'when', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'dancing', 'nightclub', 'joined', 'two', 'women', 'know', 'everyone', 'floor', 'doing', 'exact', 'same', 'moves', 'what', 'Spacey', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'Just', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'stuffy', 'biography', 'Rat', 'Pack-era', 'singer', 'Sea', 'out', 'song', 'dance.Having', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'sing', 'Seas', 'down', 'courts', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'shooting', 'film', 'Rome', 'not', 'only', 'sense', 'context', 'film', 'Darin', 'life', 'was', 'filled', 'music', 'early', 'childhood', 'last', 'breath', 'Spacey', 'Colick', 'wisely', 'assimilate', 'songs', 'part', 'overall', 'milieu.That', 'having', 'sit', 'bunch', 'unnecessary', 'concert', 'performances', 'allowing', 'Spacey', 'pursue', 'other', 'avenues', 'Darin', 'life', 'Bosworth', 'stunning', 'Dee', 'young', 'pure', 'almost', 'innocent', 'facade', 'quickly', 'shattered', 'Spacey', 'cast', 'sturdy', 'players', 'including', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Darin', 'brother-in-law', 'John', 'Goodman', 'agent', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'mother', 'extremely', 'sympathetic', 'Caroline', 'Aaron', 'sister.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'vanity', 'project', 'not', 'one', 'done', 'vain', 'funny', 'engaging', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'dishes', 'enough', 'information', 'give', 'weight']",N/A

901132,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00094ARN2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Kevin Spacey is the co-writer, director, and star of the Bobby Darin bio-pic and hopefully you were able to figure out by my 4-star rating, but I one of the major problems in the film (that almost led me to give it 3 stars) was the fact that there is too many flashback/childhood sequence that half the time you can't tell what's going on in the story at the moment and what's not.This can sometimes be annoying, however the film is interesting and Kevin Spacey is amazing in the role, that it was hard for me not to like the film. I love Kevin Spacey from films like ""American Beauty,"" ""K-Pax,"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" and I'm not really familar with Bobby Darin. I knew the songs ""Beyond the Sea,"" ""Mack the Knife,"" and ""Splish Splash"" but that's as far as it went. This movie does give insight into the life of Bobby Darin. The film opens with Darin singing Mack the Knife when he sees a young boy (the younger version of himself) he stops the show and we realize that he's actually filming a movie about his own life. At some point during this scene, a person says ""you're too old to play the role."" which relates to a lot of people (and critics) feeling about Spacey playing Darin. Anyway, while working on a movie Bobby meets Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) and a musical scene with Darin singing ""Beyond the Sea"" evolves which brings to mind classic films from the fifties where people would burst out in song for seemingly no reason. Spacey sounds exactly like Darin and is truly a great singer. I agree with the editors review that says Sandra Dee doesn't hold his attention as much as the little boy does. But I wouldn't say it has ""soap opera"" twists. You could read a small page of these so called-twists by googling Bobby Darin. This is a bio-pic, not a murder mystery. I think Spacey should have been given a Best Actor, Best Director, or Best Original Score Oscar nomination, because he succeeded greatly at these things. The script isn't quite solid, but is definitley interesting.

Frankly, I was really surprised at how well he sang.  Now, having said that, I also have to say that Beyond the Sea could have been so much better. It was over done and too disjointed to be enjoyable. Spacey was also the film's director and I believe that was a major problem.The psychological sequences, where the adult Darin talks with his younger self, are ridiculous and annoying.  They were not needed and made the movie difficult to watch.  It jumps around entirely too much and scenes from the past are intertwined with the present.The actors were all very good! The role of Sandra Dee was well done by Kate Bosworth and she even resembled Dee a great deal.  Bo Hoskins and John Goodman were also believable as Darin's support team.The other problem that I had with Beyond the Sea was the big dancing sequence at the end of the movie.  The story had ended and then this (again, out of place) Hollywood production sequence shows up and seemed to have little or no connection with the story.

901137,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00094ARN2,kaduzy,"[16, 31]","The salient points have already been covered by other reviewers, so I'll just offer a brief recap of the main two:1) Spacey is too old to play this part!  His scenes with Kate Bosworth are creepy because she looks like Sandra Dee and he looks like Sandra Dee's dad.  Without the toupees, he looks like her grandfather!  But it's not just her.  Spacey's mistake was casting every part but his with people who were age-appropriate to their roles, which just makes him look older by comparison.  In one scene he tries to be a teenager, leaning out of an open car to throw fliers at people, then laughing with his teenaged friend and driving off.  The kid who played the friend was actually a teenager.  Spacey made himself look ridiculous by comparison.  OLD and ridiculous.  And having Bob Hoskins play his father figure when the man is hardly more than ten years older than Spacey himself was equally as ridiculous.2) Spacey's singing is nowhere near as good as Darin's.  He should have lip-synched but he was too busy show-casing himself to think clearly.Having acknowledged that, I have to say that the WORST part about this film is its screenplay.  Not just the dialogue, which is pure crap (examples coming later!), but the story itself.  The script's opening conceit is that Bobby Darin is making a movie about Bobby Darin.  This is convenient because it allows people in the movie to comment on what we're all thinking -- that Darin (aka Spacey) is ""too old"" to play himself as a young man.  The film's answer to that (courtesy of Bob Hoskins) is, in essence, ""Shut up.""  Okay!  Thanks for that crystal-clear justification.  And I don't know if Darin was actually going bald as a young man, but if so it's convenient because Spacey's going bald too!  And since this is worked into the screenplay as well, his toupees, worn to make him look a smidge younger, are also ""justified.""  In addition to Bobby making a movie of himself, he is also confronted by the childhood version of himself.  Apparently the actor they got to play him (in the movie of himself, not this movie) is actually Bobby Darin as a kid, traveling through time or something.  It's really not explained, which is better for the filmmakers because no explanation would hold water.  My, that's one fantastic casting director they've got is all I can say.In having his childhood self lead him through his life, Spacey's Darin is able to deliver clunkers like ""Memories are like moonbeams -- we do with them what we will.""  This is the worst metaphor I've EVER heard.  It makes Dan Brown's metaphors (author of the poorly written ""Da Vinci Code"") look like the stuff of Pulitzer Prizes.  You can't do what you want with a bloody moonbeam!  That doesn't make ANY sense!  But Spacey & Co. are obviously proud of the line; they repeat it ad nauseum and then throw it at us again just before the end credits as a way of doing one final justification for any inaccuracies in the movie, inaccuracies that are glossed over under colorful singing & dancing montages.  Spacey's dancing is stiff and terrible.  He moves like a middle-aged man with back problems, even while running.The job of the supporting cast members is to look adoring at all times.  This movie is a criminal waste of Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn.  Even Bosworth and John Goodman could be doing better.The script was written by Lewis Colick (known mainly for bringing us gems like ""Domestic Disturbance"" and ""Bulletproof"") and of course Kevin Spacey (who did everything short of craft services for this movie).  He hasn't written anything before, and it shows!  Lines in this movie include things like: ""God, you're beautiful""; ""Oh my God, I love you.  I really love you"" and ""My career went by like a freight train and Dodd grew up like a moose.""  Great!  Why not say he grew like a bullfrog, or like a polar bear!  Either of those would have had just as much relevance in context and made just as much sense!  There's also a huge plot hole involving a mysterious suitcase Darin gives to his son Dodd just before he dies.  We never find out what's in it!  How pointless!The only extras on the DVD were a making-of documentary and commentary from Spacey and one of his producers, both of which I skipped in order to get this horrible movie out of my life with greater haste.  But it seems odd that after everything we've read about how many years Spacey worked to get this movie off the ground, and how hard it was, and how much he worked doing everything for the film from writing to directing to acting to dancing to singing to juggling flaming plates, that there wouldn't be more to offer in the way of extras.In the movie, the kid playing young Darin (who is, I'm sorry to say, the worst child actor I've ever seen) says ""You want truth?  I'll give you some truth.""  Well right now *I* can give some to *you*:* Kevin Spacey used to be a great actor, but he has fallen on hard times.  He hasn't made a good movie since the '90s, and they just keep getting worse.  This one is a new low.* Gidget royalties must not be paying much, because money is the only reason I can imagine Sandra Dee and her son Dodd Darin signing off on this garbage.* THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL.  AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.(And P.S. -- if you're thinking of voting unhelpful because of my opinion on Dan Brown & his writing, try reading my review of that one first.

Even when they're bad you feel something's at stake, that passion is involved.  John Wayne wore all his hats for THE ALAMO (1960) and when America didn't embrace it as enthusiastically as he had hoped, it broke his spirit, embittered him a little.  And some stars never even have pet projects--do you think Elizabeth Taylor ever really cared about what movie she was making?  It was the old factory mentality for Liz, punch in, punch out, bye, have a nice weekend.  Thus I really wanted to like BEYOND THE SEA and when I didn't, I finally figured out the problem.  It was the pet project of a star who isn't really a star, and inside this bright jewelbox of a film is nobody you can really care about.These projects are all about vanity and Spacey must never get bored with hearing how much he's like Bobby Darin, singing, dancing, acting, they even look alike with that fake little nose-strip he's got pasted on his face in this film.  Was turning the picture into a meta-fictional 8 1/2 meditation on fame and disease the wise thing to do?  Oh, who knows, it gives the movie a startling beginning and provides a ""reason"" for those spectacular sub-ALL THAT JAZZ dance sequences that keep popping up every ten minutes or so (BEYOND THE SEA, UP A LAZY RIVER, etc), numbers without a lick of sense to them or even any real choreography.  At least ALL THAT JAZZ had Bob Fosse.  BEYOND THE SEA's got-- Kevin Spacey of course (and Rob Ashford, the Broadway choregrapher whose dances for THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE five years ago had everyone gasping in despair).The truth is, the BobbY Darin story was done much better in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, and the actor playing Tony Polar (the late lamented Tony Scotti) was more like Darin than Spacey will ever be.  Darin's romance with brilliant and tragic Sandra Dee is already amply chronicled in the magnificent trilogy of Universal films they made together, COME SEPTEMBER, IF A MAN ANSWERS, and the superb THAT FUNNY FEELING.

901141,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00094ARN2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 4]","The musical biography is always a hit-or-miss genre for me. These pictures can be effective, but oftentimes lack dramatic heft as we move through the years. It's a Cliff's Notes version of someone's life only stopping for an occassional weighty scene or recognizable milestone.  Kevin Spacey's love letter to Bobby Darin, ""Beyond the Sea,"" is a flight of fantasy (Darin recalls his legacy from a mystical movie set) that feels more indulgent than enlightening.  It uses relevant music to dramatize significant events and to link passages of time, and then comes together with an imagined, jubilant musical number to play us out.  It's kind of hard to take anything too seriously.Here's the thing. When looking at a biographical movie, I have to ask myself two questions. Is the person relevant enough to merit a full blown film? And is there enough of interest to warrant that film? I certainly have nothing against Bobby Darin.  If anything, I hoped this picture would have illuminated just why his memory should not be forgotten.  But his life just wasn't that unusual or interesting, especially compared to dozens of comparable pop idols through the years.  And with the star handling all the musical numbers, we get the limited appeal of Kevin Spacey singing and dancing and singing and dancing some more. It's fine, but hardly the stuff to make young girls all aflutter.""Beyond the Sea"" was problematic from the beginning. Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly a talented actor, but he severely miscast himself here. Everyone knows it and the film even winkingly acknowledges the fact that he's way too old. But forgiving that, the film glosses over any unnecessarily unpleasant or dramatic points in his life. A childhood deadly disease.  Cue song.  Sandra Dee doesn't like him.  Cue song.  Problems in the marriage.  Cue song.  A neglected child.  Cue song.  No issue is ever handled effectively by the script!  Instead a musical video number comes along and the problem doesn't exist anymore. Still as lightweight entertainment, the film was fine initially.  However, the longer it goes on, the more self important it becomes. Then boom, let's call that illness up again and end this picture with a showstopper.  ""Beyond The Sea"" offers one more self-indulgent song and dance from Mr. Spacey.  As depicted, even Bobby Darin knew he was obsolete by the end of the sixties, so I'm not sure why I'd care 40 years later anyway.  This picture didn't convince me I should.  For me, ""Beyond The Sea"" started out as a three star film because of its harmlessness but sinks to one star by the end due to its own pretensions.

901142,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00094ARN2,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 6]","The first thing that strikes out in this loosely based biography is Kevin Spacey who co-wrote, directed, produced, and performed the roll of Bobby Darin.  Spacey displays an astonishing talent level in this production where he also sings and dances.  He simply becomes Bobby Darin, the diligent musician slash actor, who overcame difficulties and fought his way out of the Bronx while struggling with rheumatic fever.  His illness left him with a scarred heart and doctors did not believe that he would live past fifteen.  Nonetheless, Bobby overcame this too while his sheltering mother provided a safe home where she taught him the basics of showbiz.Bobby Darin's attentiveness to perfection emerges in the opening scene of the film where he disrupts himself in the middle of the shooting of a song scene.  His desire to perfect things made him somewhat difficult to approach, which often generated frustration among his fellow employees.  Yet, no one dared to address their issues with him in the fear of the consequences.  Thus, Bobby rethinks the opening of the film while some of his closer friends disagree with him when he wants to change the opening.  Out of nowhere, a young kid, who performs the part of Bobby in his youth, expresses discontent with the opening.  Attentively, Bobby listens to the boy who brings him into a dreamy flashback that borderlines between reality and the fictionalized world of stage performance.  This is a remarkably clever introduction that Spacey and his co-writer Lewis Colick created that genuinely captures the audience's attention.Through the borderline opening, the audience will dance on the line in between life and the stage while following the flashback.  Bobby provides his own voiceover that described parts of his life, which begins with his youth where he is bedridden by the rheumatic fever.  Despite the doctor's medical assessment, Bobby continues to grow beyond the age of fifteen while developing a passion for performing and singing through his inspiring mother.  It almost feels as if Bobby's inspiration for the music keeps him alive way beyond the time prediction.  Well into his twenties, Bobby continues to struggle, but this time to become successful performer.  After years of uphill fighting, Bobby finally faces the success he seeks through the popular song Splish-Splash, which set him off in the direction of his much desired stardom.The success in the music business urges him to seek further challenges, which he seeks in Hollywood.  His first major role came through Come September (1960) where he plays a part against Rock Hudson and on the rise actor Sandra Dee who turned 19 at the year of the film's release.  A love struck Bobby begins to pursue Sandra with roses and other admiration for her, but her mother stands between him and her.  Again, he overcomes adversity and marries the woman of his life with whom he stayed until his death in 1973.  Knowing that Bobby Darin will die does not affect the film's value, as it deals with several interesting issues such as self-discovery, persistence, and many other valuable lessons.The story of Bobby Darin does not offer an authentic biography of him, but a more conceptual biography that touches on the his ideas and possibly his existential perspective.  This, however, makes the story so much more interesting, as it deals with how he might have experienced his own life.  The success of the story rests with the co-writer, director, producer, and actor Spacey who brings the story to life through a vibrant performance.  Spacey's performance finds support in a terrific cast including names such as Kate Bosworth, John Goodman, and Bob Hoskins.  Hoskins does a brilliant job, as his brother-in-law.  After the blackened screen, the audience will be remembering Darin, not as the arrogantly demanding boss, but as a person who lived life to the fullest while experiencing the wonder of each breath.",4,Brilliant Spacey Performs Every Breath of the Part...,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,3929,"['first', 'thing', 'out', 'loosely', 'based', 'biography', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'produced', 'performed', 'roll', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Spacey', 'astonishing', 'talent', 'level', 'production', 'where', 'also', 'dances', 'simply', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'diligent', 'musician', 'slash', 'actor', 'who', 'overcame', 'difficulties', 'fought', 'way', 'Bronx', 'struggling', 'rheumatic', 'fever', 'illness', 'left', 'scarred', 'heart', 'doctors', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'would', 'live', 'past', 'fifteen', 'Nonetheless', 'Bobby', 'overcame', 'too', 'sheltering', 'mother', 'provided', 'safe', 'home', 'where', 'taught', 'basics', 'showbiz.Bobby', 'Darin', 'attentiveness', 'perfection', 'emerges', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'middle', 'shooting', 'song', 'scene', 'desire', 'perfect', 'things', 'made', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'approach', 'often', 'generated', 'frustration', 'fellow', 'employees', 'one', 'dared', 'address', 'issues', 'fear', 'consequences', 'Thus', 'Bobby', 'opening', 'film', 'closer', 'friends', 'disagree', 'when', 'change', 'opening', 'nowhere', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'part', 'Bobby', 'youth', 'discontent', 'opening', 'Attentively', 'Bobby', 'boy', 'who', 'dreamy', 'flashback', 'reality', 'fictionalized', 'world', 'stage', 'performance', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'introduction', 'Spacey', 'co-writer', 'Lewis', 'Colick', 'created', 'genuinely', 'audience', 'borderline', 'opening', 'audience', 'will', 'dance', 'line', 'life', 'stage', 'following', 'flashback', 'Bobby', 'own', 'voiceover', 'described', 'parts', 'life', 'youth', 'where', 'bedridden', 'rheumatic', 'fever', 'doctor', 'medical', 'assessment', 'Bobby', 'grow', 'age', 'fifteen', 'developing', 'passion', 'performing', 'singing', 'inspiring', 'mother', 'almost', 'Bobby', 'inspiration', 'music', 'alive', 'way', 'time', 'prediction', 'Well', 'twenties', 'Bobby', 'struggle', 'time', 'become', 'successful', 'performer', 'years', 'uphill', 'fighting', 'Bobby', 'finally', 'success', 'popular', 'song', 'Splish-Splash', 'set', 'off', 'direction', 'much', 'desired', 'stardom.The', 'success', 'music', 'business', 'seek', 'further', 'challenges', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'came', 'Come', 'September', '1960', 'where', 'part', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'rise', 'actor', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'who', 'turned', '19', 'year', 'film', 'release', 'love', 'struck', 'Bobby', 'pursue', 'Sandra', 'roses', 'other', 'admiration', 'mother', 'Again', 'adversity', 'woman', 'life', 'whom', 'stayed', 'death', '1973', 'Knowing', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'will', 'die', 'not', 'affect', 'film', 'value', 'several', 'interesting', 'issues', 'such', 'self-discovery', 'persistence', 'many', 'other', 'valuable', 'lessons.The', 'story', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'not', 'offer', 'authentic', 'biography', 'more', 'conceptual', 'biography', 'ideas', 'possibly', 'existential', 'perspective', 'however', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'experienced', 'own', 'life', 'success', 'story', 'co-writer', 'director', 'producer', 'actor', 'Spacey', 'who', 'story', 'life', 'vibrant', 'performance', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'support', 'terrific', 'cast', 'including', 'names', 'such', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Hoskins', 'brilliant', 'job', 'brother-in-law', 'blackened', 'screen', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'remembering', 'Darin', 'not', 'arrogantly', 'demanding', 'boss', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'fullest', 'experiencing', 'wonder', 'breath']",N/A

901146,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00094ARN2,Larry VanDeSande,"[12, 15]","My greatest memory of this film -- ""Beyond the Sea"", actor/director/producer Kevin Spacey's very personal and somewhat idiosyncratic look at the life of 1960s singer-actor Bobby Darin -- is how little the film used the immense talent availableIn a cast that included Spacey, Kate Bosworth, John Goodman and Bob Hoskins, not a single actor in the group could be said to deliver anything more than an adequate performance. Spacey, who played the adult Darin and did his own singing in the movie, was a shell of the actor that distinguished himself in much better films like ""The Shipping News"", ""American Beauty"" and ""L.A. Confidential"". His singing was pretty good and, who knows, he may have been the epitome of Darin. But he wasn't much compared to what Kevin Spacey has been in the past.Kate Bosworth has starred in a mix of films in her young life ranging from ""Sin City"" to ""Blue Crush"" to ""Rules of Attraction"", does creditable work as Mrs. Darin, Sandra Dee. Her wigs don't do much for the part -- the real Sandra Dee's hair looked more realistic than actresses hair does in the new century -- although she was always well-lighted and, therefore, filmed well. Unfortunately, her role was monodimensional and she delivered the goods as if a cardboard cutout with moveable lips and eyebrows.The greatest disappointment for me was the tawdry and boring character John Goodman was asked to play. Here is an actor of stature that can adapt to many characterizations and adapted well to this one. However, either the role, the script of the direction drained Goodman of his trademark humor and individuality. I wasn't sure if his character was supposed to be English but it seemed so; he spoke with a minor accent and displayed all the reticence of an English gentleman.As to the film itself, Spacey's production was too far fetched in the beginning to pull you into the story. In fact, it wasn't clear to me what was going in the movie's first 10 minutes. Was this a put on, this correspondence between characters in front of the audience? When the story got moving, it was pretty entertaining. Yet, if this movie was all there was to Darin's life, it made a pretty forgettable flick.This movie seemed to me to play out more like a made for TV flick than a Hollywood production. Comparing it to ""Walk the Line"", the film about singer Johnny Cash made about the same time, was like comparing ""Reagan"" to ""Nixon"": One was made for cable with a limited budget & limited perspective and played out like a sequence of frames in the cartoon section. Yhe other was made for the big screen with corresponding acting budget, breadth in production values, and felicities in the script based on solid historical research.""Beyond the Sea"" can be an interesting view into the life of a 1960s pop icon if you can get by the cornball beginning and not think about why these great actors aren't being asked to be great actors.

901148,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00094ARN2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","Kevin Spacey did ""Beyond the Sea"" so that a new generation of fans could fall in love with the songs of Bobby Darin.  Of course, the person we are really impressed with by the end of this 2004 bio-pic is Spacey (on the off chance that there are those who do not recognize him as one of the finest actors of his generation).  Spacey directs ""Beyond the Sea,"" he wrote the script (apparently off of a 1987 draft by Lewis Colick), he stars as Bobby Darin, he sings Bobby Darin's songs himself and he even does his own dancing.  We are so busy being impressed by Kevin Spacey that we almost forget to be impressed by Bobby Darin, but I think everybody will find a point in this film when they decide they like what the man is singing because there are so many different facets to his music one must inevitable hit home.  I always liked ""Mack the Knife"" over ""Splish Splash"" or ""Dream Lover,"" but these days I think of him and Tim Hardin doing each other's songs, ""Simple Song of Freedom"" and ""If I Were a Carpenter,"" respectively).In terms of bio-pics this one has a touch of ""All That Jazz (granted, that was an allegorical bio-pic for Bob Fosse, but that can count too).  This film has a post-modern self-reflexivity in the idea Darin is staging his life and doing what he wants in telling his own story (""Memories are like moonbeams,"" we are reminded more than once), but I think it is also simply a device for validating Spacey playing the young Darin.  By now it is clear, this is Kevin Spacey's movie, body and soul, and he can do whatever he wants in it and with it, which includes little Bobby Darin (William Ullrich) rebuking the older Bobby Darin for getting things wrong.  Born Walden Robert Cassotto, he suffered from rheumatic fever as a child and was not expected to live.  So turning himself into Bobby Darin and trying to replace Frank Sinatra as the most popular singer and failing is not exactly the worst thing that could ever happen to a fella.  Being loved by your mother (Brenda Blethyn) and sister, Nina (Caroline Aaron), and marrying Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) can be part of the good life as well.Spacey also gets credit for getting this movie made.  Hollywood has been kicking a Bobby Darin film around for decades, with everybody from Bruce Willis and Tom Cruise to Leonardo Di Caprio and Johnny Depp supposedly going to star and the likes of Barry Levison and Paul Schrader directing.  But for Spacey this is clearly a personal effort.  There is a disclaimer at the end that there should not be any assumption that Darin's family and friends have endorsed this film, but it is hard to believe that they would see it as anything other than an act of love by Spacey.  Darin's story has ups and downs, both of which are chronicled by the film, and the story, like Darin's life, ends on an upswing before he dies during heart surgery at the age of 37.  But the final high point was nowhere near where Darin was at the height of his popularity, so this is still a sense of sadness at the end, as there should be.  When ""Beyond the Sea"" is over you are going to want to listen to these songs again.  It will be interesting to see if you go for one of the hit collections of Bobby Darin or if you go for Kevin Spacey on the soundtrack album.",4,Kevin Spacey does it all in this Bobby Darin bio-pic,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,3258,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'could', 'fall', 'love', 'songs', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'course', 'person', 'are', 'really', 'impressed', 'end', '2004', 'bio-pic', 'Spacey', 'off', 'chance', 'are', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', 'Spacey', 'Sea', 'wrote', 'script', 'apparently', '1987', 'draft', 'Lewis', 'Colick', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'songs', 'even', 'own', 'dancing', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'impressed', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'almost', 'forget', 'be', 'impressed', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'think', 'everybody', 'will', 'find', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'decide', 'what', 'man', 'singing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'facets', 'music', 'one', 'must', 'inevitable', 'hit', 'home', 'always', 'liked', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'Splish', 'Splash', 'Dream', 'Lover', 'days', 'think', 'Tim', 'Hardin', 'doing', 'other', 'songs', 'Simple', 'Song', 'Freedom', 'Were', 'Carpenter', 'respectively', '.In', 'terms', 'bio-pics', 'one', 'touch', 'All', 'Jazz', 'granted', 'was', 'allegorical', 'bio-pic', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'can', 'count', 'too', 'film', 'post-modern', 'self-reflexivity', 'idea', 'Darin', 'staging', 'life', 'doing', 'what', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'Memories', 'are', 'moonbeams', 'are', 'reminded', 'more', 'once', 'think', 'also', 'simply', 'device', 'validating', 'Spacey', 'playing', 'young', 'Darin', 'now', 'clear', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'movie', 'body', 'soul', 'can', 'do', 'whatever', 'little', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'William', 'Ullrich', 'rebuking', 'older', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'getting', 'things', 'wrong', 'Born', 'Walden', 'Robert', 'Cassotto', 'suffered', 'rheumatic', 'fever', 'child', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'live', 'So', 'turning', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'trying', 'replace', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'most', 'popular', 'singer', 'failing', 'not', 'exactly', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'ever', 'happen', 'fella', 'Being', 'loved', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'sister', 'Nina', 'Caroline', 'Aaron', 'marrying', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'can', 'be', 'part', 'good', 'life', 'well.Spacey', 'also', 'credit', 'getting', 'movie', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'kicking', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'film', 'decades', 'everybody', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'supposedly', 'going', 'star', 'likes', 'Barry', 'Levison', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'directing', 'Spacey', 'clearly', 'personal', 'effort', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'assumption', 'Darin', 'family', 'friends', 'have', 'endorsed', 'film', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'act', 'love', 'Spacey', 'Darin', 'story', 'ups', 'downs', 'are', 'chronicled', 'film', 'story', 'Darin', 'life', 'upswing', 'heart', 'surgery', 'age', '37', 'final', 'high', 'point', 'was', 'nowhere', 'where', 'Darin', 'was', 'height', 'popularity', 'still', 'sense', 'sadness', 'end', 'should', 'be', 'When', 'Sea', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'listen', 'songs', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'go', 'one', 'hit', 'collections', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'go', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'soundtrack', 'album']",N/A
901149,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00094ARN2,Lawyeraau,"[4, 5]","Clearly, Kevin Spacey is a big time Bobby Darin fan, and this is his own personal homage to that great entertainer, as well as a showcase for himself. As director, producer, co-writer  and star of this show, Kevin Spacey hits some highs, as well as some lows, in this bio pic.First of all, not only is Kevin Spacey a great actor, he is also a terrific singer, as well as an agile and nimble dancer. I thought that, at times, especially when playing the older Bobby Darin, he had Bobby Darin down pat. Although the film tried to reconcile the issue of Kevin Spacey's age in the film through the cinematic contrivance of a film within a film, I just could not buy Kevin Spacey as the teenage Bobby Darin, no matter how hard I tried. For me, this was a glaring weakness through the film.  Moreover, I found the use of flashbacks a little confusing at times, especially as the teenage Bobby Darin looked exactly like the older Bobby Darin.While artistic license was certainly taken with Bobby Darin's life, I think thatthe film does a yeoman's job of hitting some of the highlights of his life. Born to a working class Bronx family in 1936, he was baptized Walden Robert Cassotto. He grew up believing that his grandmother, Polly (Brenda Blethyn), was his mother, not knowing that Nina (Caroline Aaron), the woman he knew as his sister,  was really his mother. He would discover the truth much later on in life, and it would be hard for him to reconcile with the truth.Bobby Darin contracted rheumatic fever as a young child, an illness that left his doctor concluding that he would not live past the age of fifteen. Growing up with the sword of Damocles hanging over his head, where every day could be his last, Bobby Darrin lived life to the fullest. Under the early tutelage of Polly, a former vaudevillian performer, he developed an affinity for song and dance. This would be the catalyst for all he would do and become in life. Nina's husband, Charlie Maffia (Bob Hoskins), would help the young Bobby, becoming a father figure and an important member of Darin's entourage, along with Steve Blauner (John Goodman),  Darin's best friend turned manager.Bobby Darin would hit the silver screen and star in a number of films, including one where he would meet his future wife, the teenage beauty, Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth). Their marriage was to begin with many hope and dreams, but they would find that the silver lining in their cloud of happiness would soon tarnish, as professional jealousy and unhappiness would begin to set in. With Bobby Darin's personal demons unleashed, as well as Sandra Dee's, it is little wonder that their marriage turned rocky.  The film takes the viewer through the good, the bad, and the ugly in Darin's life until his death in 1973 at the age of thirty-seven, when his heart finally had enough.Kevin Spacey dominates the film, as his is the central role. Moreover, he is simply a talented singer and dancer in his own right. I just found it to difficult to buy him as the teenage Bobby Darin and therein lies the rub. I think that he let his ego get the better of him in that respect. Still, his is a riveting performance. Kate Bosworth was decent in the role of Sandra Dee, although I did feel that she simply had too contemporary an edge. Bob Hoskins, as always, is simply terrific. He imbues the role of Charlie Maffia  with  an avuncular charm and warmth. Brenda Blethyn is wonderful as the down to earth and loving Polly. As Nina, Caroline Aaron is a bit histrionic, at times, but effective, nonetheless. Of course, asides from Kevin Spacey's magnetic performance, the music is simply terrific, especially if you loved Bobby Darin's songs.Those who are fans of Bobby Darin will enjoy this movie.

901151,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00094ARN2,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 5]","""Beyond the Sea"" is a good film with some great music and great performances.  Lewis Colick's screenplay experiments with Darin making a movie about Darin, thus we have a frame within a frame, and the young Bobby Darin played by newcomer William Ullrich interfacing with the mature Darin played by Kevin Spacey.  Colick's credits as a screenwriter include the excellent ""October Sky"" (1999), ""Along Came A Spider"" with Morgan Freeman & ""Domestic Disturbance"" with John Travolta (2001) as well as ""Ladder 49"" again with John Travolta (2004).  Perhaps the screenplay is a bit too clever and a more straightforward telling of Darin's story would have reached a broader audience.  But with Kevin Spacey as director & star, this film works most of the time.  Of course, the unwritten star is Bobby Darin himself whose music and performances made him a legend.  Finding out more about his life simply deepens my appreciation for his marvelous music.The cast is fantastic.  No, Kevin Spacey is not going to make anyone forget Darin's voice, but he does an excellent job selling the songs in the numerous numbers in the film.  William Ullrich as the younger Darin has an equal amount of sass & swagger and was recognized as ""Best Young Actor"" by the Broadcast Critics Association.  Brenda Blethyn as his mother/grandmother Polly is one of the busiest actors with 5 films this year (""On A Clear Day,"" ""Clubland,"" ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""Piccadilly Jim,"" & the animated ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"").  Twice nominated for an Oscar in ""Secrets & Lies"" (96) & ""Little Voice"" (98), she brings depth, compassion and gives the young Darin the dream & grit to overcome his health problems and find salvation through music.  As Charlie, Bob Hoskins adds a bustling energy.  Caroline Aaron who plays sister Nina does a great and boisterous job.  She's one of those actresses who works a lot, yet you struggle to place: ""Working Girl"" (88), ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (93), ""Primary Colors"" (98).  As the manager Steve Blauner, John Goodman turns in solid support as part of Darin's team.  Greta Scacchi who first came to U.S. movies in 1990 with Harrison Ford in ""Presumed Innocent,"" plays Sandra Dee's mama with great bravado.  Kate Bosworth who played girlfriend to Val Kilmer's John Holmes in ""Wonderland"" & as a surfer in ""Blue Crush"" may or may not fit Dee.  But she has a perky presence and gives a varied performance as a lush, devoted wife, and glamorous movie star.I've got to give a special recognition to Peter Cincotti because I'm SUCH a fan of his jazz CDs.

901166,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00094ARN2,Michael Butts,"[0, 2]","Kevin Spacey's homage to the charismatic Bobby Darin was vastly overshadowed by the release of RAY the same year.  While one can't help but find praise for Spacey's co-writing, directing, acting, singing and dancing, the main problem with BEYOND THE SEA is that unlike RAY, Spacey chose to add fantasy elements and production numbers that invalidated the biopic status.  While RAY painted a straightforward picture of the dynamic Charles, the script didn't sugarcoat Ray's vices and Jamie Foxx was so much Ray Charles, the film overwhelms Spacey's flick.  Also, many key ""truths"" about Darin were eliminated from the film:  his love for Connie Francis, which was squelched by her overprotective father; his courting of Sandra Dee's mother prior to his pursuit of Ms. Dee; his eventual divorce from Dee and his remarriage---these elements weren't touched and thus in BEYOND THE SEA, we don't get an honest, complete biopic.BUT, Spacey is dynamite; one can tell his respect for Darin's abilities and his singing is surprisingly good, and his dancing ain't half bad either.  Kate Bosworth captures the naivete and innocence of Sandra Dee, while demonstrating her stubborness and ultimate decline into alcohol abuse; Caroline Aaron is dynamite as Darin's ""sister"" who has her own dark secret; and newcomer William Ullrich does a nice job as the young Darin.While the technique of using a movie about Darin's life is unique, it undermines a lot of the substance of the film, and if Spacey decided to fictionalize parts of the movie, which parts were the audience supposed to believe?If you're a fan of Darin, you will probably cozy up to the image Spacey has given us, and even if you aren't one can't deny the amount of professionalism in this movie.

And yes, most of the acting is cringe-inducing: Bob Hoskins and John Goodman giving tired retreads of every other performance they've ever given; Kate Bosworth -- forgeddaboutit!

901168,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00094ARN2,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","""Beyond the Sea"" is a musical biopic of Bobby Darin, pop singer of catchy hits like ""Splish Splash"", ""Dream Lover"", ""Beyond the Sea"", and ""Mack the Knife"", brief movie star, and one of the greatest nightclub entertainers ever. The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also plays Darin and does all of his singing and dancing numbers himself. Bobby Darin's story is told through flashbacks, subjective memories, voice-over narration, and by the grown Bobby Darin and his childhood self speaking to one another. ""Beyond the Sea"" starts off by commenting on its own style, as we see Darin filming a movie that is to be a self-portrait and responding to a reporter who asks if he isn't too old to play himself. At times like those, the film steps out of Darin's life to explain itself, which might seem self-indulgent on Kevin Spacey's part...or it might seem forthright and amusing.We see the genesis of Bobby's musical career when he was sick as a boy. Unable to play outside due to damage from rheumatic fever, young Walden Robert Cassotto (William Ullrich) found solace in music. His mother Polly (Brenda Blethyn), a former vaudevillian, taught him to sing, dance and play the piano, and together they dreamed that Bobby would be a bigger star than Frank Sinatra. As a young man, Bobby (Kevin Spacey) headed to Los Angeles to realize his dream, his manager Steve ""Boom Boom"" Blauner (John Goodman), brother-in-law Charlie (Bob Hoskins), an inexperienced publicist, and an accompanist in tow. We follow Bobby's rise to fame in the 1950s, his tumultuous marriage to Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), his flagging career in the late 1960s, and the revival of his Vegas nightclub act in the 1970s, until his death in 1973.""Beyond the Sea"" doesn't attempt to hide its nonlinear structure, which might rub some viewers the wrong way. But musicals don't conceal their style or attempt to appear literal, so this isn't a stretch. Bobby Darin was a performer, and this film is a performance. Darin's arrangements for his songs have been copied note-for-note. The songs are performed admirably by Spacey and integrated into the narrative in such a way as to advance the story. Spacey is older than Bobby Darin and plays him from ages 20-37 without age-defying make-up. That actually seems appropriate here, since ""Beyond the Sea"" has adopted the theme of Darin's timelessness, and the film is upfront in telling the audience not to take his age seriously. Both Bobby Darin's and Kevin Spacey's passion for this music come across clearly, as do the crucial facets of Darin's personality and life.The DVD (Artisan Entertainment 2005): Bonus features include a making-of documentary and an audio commentary. ""Bobby's World: The Making of Beyond the Sea"" (16 minutes) includes interviews with actor/director Kevin Spacey, cast, and creative team, in which Spacey talks about Darin's character, the musical numbers, and everyone talks about filming in freezing Berlin. The audio commentary with Kevin Spacey and producer Andy Paterson is low-key and information-packed. Spacey talks extensively about the film's structure and provides scene-by-scene commentary about filming.

901178,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B00094ARN2,Noirdame,"[4, 7]","Kevin Spacey, a long time fan of Bobby Darin, pulls out all the stops for this entertaining biopic of late performer's life.  Darin was a singer and actor with a definate interest in politics, who was beset by a critical heart condition that threatened to take his life before he turned 30.  Spacey's dynamic, energetic portrayal elevates this film above the many star bio movies out there.  His vocals are remarkably similiar to that of Darin and you can feel the enthusiasm behind every note.  His performance and direction is so effective (although a Brooklyn accent would have been nice) that at times it is easy to overlook the fact that he is too old to play Bobby, with the glaring exception in his scenes with Kate Bosworth, as Sandra Dee, the teen sweetheart of 1960s America.  They share a good chemistry, but the age difference is a bit distracting at times.  Also, Bosworth, as talented as she is, was something of a disappointment to me in her performance.  Dee had the most adorable voice, with a tinge of her native New Jersey; Bosworth does not even attempt this, and some of the wigs she wore were absolutely horrible (not her fault) - particularly the longer one we see as Bobby carries her over the threshold - I've seen photos that were taken on their wedding day and the clothing and hairstyles are not accurate at all.  Sandra's fear on their wedding night, touchingly vulnerable as it is, is not really expanded upon - those of us who are familiar with her life know that she was sexually abused by her stepfather will catch the significance but others won't. The ""Come September"" recreation scene involving the wishbone doesn't bear much of a resemblance to the actual scene from that film - as a Darin fan, Spacey could have been much more meticulious (Darin wore a black bow tie, not a white one, to the 1963 Oscar ceremony), Sandra's drinking problem is barely touched upon, her anorexia and miscarriages not even mentioned.  I also don't agree with the voice-over, stating that the films he and Sandra made together were ""dogs"".  Also the presence of Sandra's mother, Mary Douvan (Greta Schacci) in their lives, is very much downplayed - she would eventually move in with her daughter and son-in-law after they married, no doubt contributing to their marital discord.The songs that Spacey chose to define their love for each other are achingly appropriate - Dream Lover, Beyond The Sea, and the most moving Once Upon A Time - it really sums up the strong emotional attachment that Darin and Dee had for one another, although they couldn't live together.  Sandra Dee died in 2005 and she loved Bobby to her dying day, as confirmed by their son, Dodd ""Moose"" Darin.Bobby Darin struggles to reach the top and to be somebody before he turns 25, if he lives that long.  His grandmother, Polly (Brenda Blethyn), whom he believes to be his mother, encourages him, as does his brother-in-law, Charlie Maffia (Bob Hoskins), and his manager, Steve ""Boom-boom"" Blauner (John Goodman), and when he finally becomes a top charter with his hits ""Splish Splash"" and ""Mack The Knife"", he continues to reach out into other venues, to appeal to a mass audience, and also becomes an effective actor, scoring an Oscar nomination for ""Captain Newman, M.D."".  With the changing of the times in the late 60s, his marriage to Sandra crumbles and he finds himself trying to catch up with the political tide and the devestating consequences of the Vietnam war.  As he begins his comeback, ""the curtain falls"".  Even more devestating is his discovery that his ""sister"" Nina Maffia (Caroline Aaron), is actually his mother.  There is a tear-inducing moment in the film where he acknowledges her as such on stage, but in real life, that actually never occurred.  A special mention must go to William Ulrich, who plays Bobby as a little boy - his interactions with the adult Darin bring a deeper understanding of the conflicting emotions and demons of Bobby, trying to do everything, and be everything to everybody.His brief remarriage in 1973, important friendships he formed (with Sammy Davis Jr, Dick Clark, George Burns and much more) and his bittersweet romance with Connie Francis don't even get a mention, but even without that, this movie hits the right chord and leaves a wonderful, poignant afterglow of this incandescent personality and the great love of his life.""But somehow once upon a time, never comes again . . . . . . . . .""",4,Once Upon A Time . . . . .,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,4439,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'long', 'time', 'fan',

Like a fabulous designer, this film is all flash and no substance. Darin's presence in pop culture was brief, with a load of stylistic about-turns, and an edge to it that was driven by some unknown force, all of which were tragically cut short. Who knows what directions he would have taken or what styles he would have settled in to had he lived a long life. He could have ended up a Vegas act, although there are plenty of indications that formulaic trappings were not what he was after.This film, for all the ways it conjures his hair style, his tuxedos, his flapping finger snaps, is an empty shirt. Kaiser Sashay, or whatever he was in USUAL SUSPECTS, is less convincing here than in almost anything I have ever seen him in. Spacey acts like he is in front of a mirror and adores what he sees. God save us. Darin's career is reduced in this film to a series of showtunes, compounding the tragedy of a man who may or may not have been a great force. Regardless, to reduce anyone to stylisms that you can mimic certainly closes the coffin on any future considerations. There is a lot of dumb stuff in this film, mostly because there is nothing of any depth. The actress who plays the actress Sandra Dee is as blank as a 2 x 4, the kind of girl you'd expect at a fashion show completely oblivious to the coniptions around her. Nothing regesters on her throughout the movie. Spacey's voice over at one point tells you that he and Sandra are drifting apart. How could he tell? How would he have the wherewithall to know? Bob Hoskins and a stage hand remove themselves from character to opine on Spacey's performance. Honestly, that works if you're Ian Richardson, or sometimes Woody Allen, but in a Spacey movie all actors would be well advised to breathe some life into the script, such as it is. The stage hand has it right, by the way.At no point is there anything resembling an analysis of what motivated and drove Darin forward. His childhood illnesses, his mother, none of the usual Freudian conceits are given even a cursory once over. Instead, we can admire Spacey's hairpieces, lack of chemistry, and incredible mimicry of Darin's voice and the band arrangements. Well, I admire impersonators. They are often very funny. But this story could have used some gravitas, even of the Billy Crystal schtick.My guess is that the film answers more of Spacey's ambivalences than anything else.

This movie is great but Spacey doesn't do any Bobby Darin moves but he's pretty good at making this movie. I also liked the young Bobby Darin (William Ullrich) But when they were showing him in the 1930s, Young Bobby was wearing the wrong clothes. He was just wearing today's casual style. A T-Shirt and Jeans. He could've at least tucked his shirt in but this is a good movie anyway and mostly old people went to see this one since Bobby Darin is a '50s singer. Bobby Darin is my favorite singer of all time! And the original Bobby will be missed by millions even today even though he died in 1973 and I still got a concert of his recorded on my tape. That was his last performance and it was in 1973. My favorite song is Mack the Knife. I was thinking they could've called the movie ""Mack is back again."" But I guess they didn't choose that since that was the title of his last performance. But Beyond the Sea is a good name too.

His acting is perfect, the film fits together decently enough, he can actually sing, and hey, we care about his character enough.Further than that, this film doesn't really pay off.A musical biography of the musician Bobby Darin, this film attempts to explore his rise as a national star and his relationship with Sandra Dee.  Neither of those things are quite played out well.  For the story of his rise, it kind of goes right from him deciding to be a star (by his mother's influence) and then him just being a star.  As for his relationship with Sandra Dee, it doesn't seem believable and I wonder how much of it is based in actual fact.  Still, it's not like the film doesn't have a story.Kudos MUST be given to Spacey for his acting.  I couldn't tell what part of the personality was his or Darin's, so I could only assume it was actually how Darin was as a person.  Supporting acting is fine, only it's not as good as Spacey's, so it often causes a little dilemma on-screen while Spacey's trying to act off of someone else who's not acting as well as he is.

In fact, its premise even evolves when the premiseof Bobby's life suffers the same kind of dramatic shift.In reflecting on this, I think it would have been easier for Spacey to craft a box office success than what he created, but what he created is something film students and critics will be talking about in decades to come in the same breath with Citizen Kane.",5,Here's to Brilliant Experiments,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1074,"['DVD', 'example', 'everything', 'love', 'DVD', 'releases', 'extras', 'make', 'experience', 'original', 'release.To', 'hear', 'commentary', 'Kevin', 'Spacy', 'perhaps', 'America', 'finest', 'living', 'actor', 'talk', 'process', 'actor', 'director', 'maiden', 'directorial', 'voyage', 'outstanding', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'type', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'release', 'Braveheart', 'Gibson', 'commentary.With', 'unique', 'combination', 'drama', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Sea', 'was', 'not', 'commercial', 'success', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'was', 'brilliant', 'experiment', 'honor', 'constant', 'experimentor.Bobby', 'Darin', 'career', 'pushed', 'expectations', 'film', 'same', 'fact', 'premise', 'even', 'when', 'premiseof', 'Bobby', 'life', 'same', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'shift.In', 'reflecting', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'Spacey', 'craft', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'what', 'created', 'what', 'created', 'something', 'film', 'students', 'critics', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'decades', 'come', 'same', 'breath', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",N/A

901203,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00094ARN2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 27]","Watching Kevin Spacey's new film ""Beyond The Sea"", a biopic of singer Bobby Darin, made me mad.The film opens with Darin (Spacey) walking through the kitchen area of the Copacabana Night Club. His step-brother, Charlie (Bob Hoskins), manager Steve (John Goodman) and others are following behind him as he takes the stage at the historic nightclub. He starts off with ""Mack The Knife"". However, a few bars into the song, he stops and says ""We're starting over."" The lights go up and the actors in the audience grumble. They've been there all day. Darin looks out past the audience, out into the studio soundstage and spots the little boy playing Little Bobby. Little Bobby loudly announces that ""This isn't right. You can do it better."" Darin considers this for a moment and says ""You know what? We can do it better"". Then the film picks up with Darin's childhood in Brooklyn, with his mom (Brenda Blethyn).You see. ""Beyond The Sea"" is a film about Bobby Darin making a film about his life. It's not enough to just tell the story, we have to see the inner workings of his id and superego. It's Darin vs. Freud.This annoying, contrived set-up is Spacey's (yes, the blame lies on him. He co-wrote and directed the film) way of providing an introspective peek into Darin's life. As if we need that. A more straight forward approach or a more out-and-out movie musical approach would have been much better. Even more annoying, this method of storytelling is abandoned after a few minutes and the film tells a conventional chronology of Darin's life.Anybody who has read any interviews with Spacey will know that this film has been a dream of Spacey's for a long time. He even put together a little concert tour to promote the film. Spacey, the star, does an adequate job or playing Darin, and convincing us that he has the talent and persistence to become a star. However, at one point, a character says ""He's too old for the role."" Remember, they are talking about Darin playing himself. This little snippet of dialogue is very telling.  Spacey is currently 45 or 46. The first time we see him playing Darin, Darin is probably in his early 20s. Darin only lived to be 36. So essentially, he is way too old to play Darin. The fact that Darin needed a hair piece doesn't really help bridge the gap. Spacey's laugh lines stand out like a sore thumb.Spacey. the co-writer and director, clearly wants to tell the life of someone he greatly admires, but the effort is muddled. Beyond the awkward beginning, which I have already mentioned, he can't decide if he wants to do a traditional biopic, with music, ala ""Ray"" (a far superior film) or a musical like ""Chicago"". The transition from Darin as a little boy to Darin as a teenager, ready to go out and make a name for himself involves Spacey and many other people in a large production number of a street in Brooklyn. The street is clearly a soundstage, which makes me wonder if they are trying to pay homage to the musicals of yesteryear. If they are, in fact, trying to do this, why isn't there more of it? As Darin is romancing Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) in Italy, he breaks into song and dance and cavorts around. The third and final example of an actual musical number is the finale where Darin dances with Little Bobby. Not only is this a little weird (Darin dancing with himself and about twenty other guys in tuxedo?) it is strangely out of place. It seems as though it would be more in place in ""Chicago"" than this film. There are a lot of scenes when Darin is singing his standards, but curiously, it doesn't seem as though there are enough. The scenes depicting Darin's film work, his disappointment at losing an Oscar (his first time nominated and apparently he was upset he lost) and his scenes of marital strife with Sandra Dee become labored and excruciating to watch.All in all, the awkward, inconsistent storyline and every scenes emphasis on Darin (Sandra Dee has a fraction of the screentime) lead me to believe that perhaps, sometimes, people shouldn't be allowed to make films about subjects they are passionate about..",2,"Spacey Is Reaching ""Beyond The Sea""",1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4082,"['Watching', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'new', 'film', 'Sea', 'biopic', 'singer', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'made', 'mad.The', 'film', 'opens', 'Darin', 'Spacey', 'walking', 'kitchen', 'area', 'Copacabana', 'Night', 'Club', 'step-brother', 'Charlie', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'manager', 'Steve', 'John', 'Goodman', 'others', 'are', 'following', 'behind', 'stage', 'historic', 'nightclub', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'However', 'few', 'bars', 'song', ""'re"", 'starting', 'over', 'lights', 'go', 'up', 'actors', 'audience', 'grumble', ""'ve"", 'been', 'day', 'Darin', 'out', 'audience', 'studio', 'soundstage', 'spots', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'Little', 'Bobby', 'Little', 'Bobby', 'loudly', ""n't"", 'right', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'considers', 'moment', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Then', 'film', 'up', 'Darin', 'childhood', 'Brooklyn', 'mom', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', '.You', 'see', 'Sea', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'making', 'film', 'life', 'not', 'enough', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'have', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'id', 'superego', 'Darin', 'vs.', 'Freud.This', 'annoying', 'contrived', 'set-up', 'Spacey', 'yes', 'blame', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'way', 'providing', 'introspective', 'peek', 'Darin', 'life', 'need', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'approach', 'more', 'out-and-out', 'movie', 'musical', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Even', 'more', 'annoying', 'method', 'storytelling', 'abandoned', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'conventional', 'chronology', 'Darin', 'life.Anybody', 'who', 'read', 'interviews', 'Spacey', 'will', 'know', 'film', 'been', 'dream', 'Spacey', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'put', 'together', 'little', 'concert', 'tour', 'promote', 'film', 'Spacey', 'star', 'adequate', 'job', 'playing', 'Darin', 'convincing', 'talent', 'persistence', 'become', 'star', 'However', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'Remember', 'are', 'talking', 'Darin', 'playing', 'little', 'snippet', 'dialogue', 'very', 'telling', 'Spacey', 'currently', '45', '46', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'playing', 'Darin', 'Darin', 'probably', 'early', '20s', 'Darin', 'only', 'lived', 'be', '36', 'So', 'essentially', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Darin', 'fact', 'Darin', 'needed', 'hair', 'piece', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'bridge', 'gap', 'Spacey', 'laugh', 'lines', 'stand', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb.Spacey', 'co-writer', 'director', 'clearly', 'tell', 'life', 'someone', 'greatly', 'effort', 'muddled', 'awkward', 'beginning', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'do', 'traditional', 'biopic', 'music', 'ala', 'Ray', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'musical', 'Chicago', 'transition', 'Darin', 'little', 'boy', 'Darin', 'teenager', 'ready', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'name', 'Spacey', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'large', 'production', 'number', 'street', 'Brooklyn', 'street', 'clearly', 'soundstage', 'wonder', 'are', 'trying', 'pay', 'homage', 'musicals', 'yesteryear', 'are', 'fact', 'trying', 'do', 'why', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'Darin', 'romancing', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Italy', 'song', 'dance', 'cavorts', 'third', 'final', 'example', 'actual', 'musical', 'number', 'finale', 'where', 'Darin', 'Little', 'Bobby', 'Not', 'only', 'little', 'weird', 'Darin', 'dancing', 'twenty', 'other', 'guys', 'tuxedo', 'strangely', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'place', 'Chicago', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'when', 'Darin', 'singing', 'standards', 'curiously', ""n't"", 'seem', 'are', 'enough', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'Darin', 'film', 'work', 'disappointment', 'losing', 'Oscar', 'first', 'time', 'nominated', 'apparently', 'was', 'upset', 'lost', 'scenes', 'marital', 'strife', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'become', 'labored', 'excruciating', 'watch.All', 'awkward', 'inconsistent', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'emphasis', 'Darin', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'fraction', 'screentime', 'lead', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'sometimes', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'films', 'subjects', 'are', 'passionate', 'about..']",N/A

901209,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00094ARN2,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","This is no box-office hit, and ignored by Oscar, but 'Beyond the Sea' has lots of good things in it, even if you don't know anything about Bobby Darin.  Kevin Spacey made it publicly known that to make Bobby Darin's bio-pic had been his dream, and the film proves that he really meant it.  Though the film could be better with different approach, 'Beyond the Sea' is still impressive for its songs, dances, and acting.Though many remember him as the singer of pop songs like 'Splish Splash' 'Dream Lover' or various jazz numbers including 'Mack the Knife,' Bobby Darin did much more than that.  Born in 1936, Bobby Darin was Oscar nominated for his supporting role in 'Captain Newman, MD' in 1963; he sang a Tim Hardin folk rock song; and he hosted a TV show in the 70s.  Kevin Spacy as director and star follows the life of Bobby Darin from his childhood in Bronx to his early death.What is most memorable and amazing is the musical parts inserted here and there in the story.  Kevin Spacey is usually associated with the part of A) creepy guy or B) weird guy, but here he shows his side of great entertainer.  Not only he sings Bobby Darin songs himself, but shows amaaing dancing.  In fact, the film looks as if it stops to show his skills, and though some may say it's his vanity, his talent is still undeniable.The supprts include Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, John Goodman, Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn and Greta Scacchi.  Quite frankly, none of them are as effective as Kevin Sapcey, perhaps with an exception of Brenda Blethyn who disappears too soon from the film.  I really like Kate Bosworth (and I liked her in 'Blue Crush'), but there's hardly any chemistry between Spacey and her that makes us believe Bobby and Sandra are married.  Real Sandra Dee was younger than Bobby Darin by six years while Kate Bosworth, gifted as she is, is younger than Kevin Spacey by 24 years.  That's too much descrepancy.But my real complaint is not this: as some of you know, Bobby Darin knew he was not going to live long (see the film), and was determined to be a professional singer no matter what people say.  This is a great story, and Kevin Spacey must have known it.  However. Kevin somehow decided on using 'frames' or unorthdox storytelling (used also in 'De-Lovely') in which Kevin's Bobby sees his life, guided by a child actor playing Bobby Darin's childhood.  Why not use more orthodox way of telling a story when there is a good story at hand?At one scene (I don't say where), Kevin Spacey indirectly gives his answer to some of the media people who continues to say he is too old to play the role of Bobby Darin.  At another scene (in fact, it's opening), Kevin's Bobby Darin stops singing in the middle of 'Mack the Knife' and shows us that it's part of shooting the bio-pic of Bobby Darin.  Take away these self-conscious moments, which clearly lessen the impact of the story, and 'Beyond the Sea' would be much better.Still, the songs and dances are all great, full of energy and expert skills of first-rate artists.  I don't know you and your reaction, but I like this film as the showcase of Kevin Spacey's talent.",4,See for Kevin Spacey's Bravura Singing and Dancing,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,3127,"['box-office', 'hit', 'ignored', 'Oscar', 'Sea', 'lots', 'good', 'things', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'made', 'publicly', 'make', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'bio-pic', 'had', 'been', 'dream', 'film', 'really', 'meant', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'different', 'approach', 'Sea', 'still', 'impressive', 'songs', 'dances', 'acting.Though', 'many', 'remember', 'singer', 'pop', 'songs', ""'Splish"", 'Splash', ""'Dream"", 'Lover', 'various', 'jazz', 'numbers', 'including', 'Knife', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'did', 'much', 'more', 'Born', '1936', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'role', ""'Captain"", 'Newman', 'MD', '1963', 'sang', 'Tim', 'Hardin', 'folk', 'rock', 'song', 'hosted', 'TV', 'show', '70s', 'Kevin', 'Spacy', 'director', 'star', 'life', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'childhood', 'Bronx', 'early', 'death.What', 'most', 'memorable', 'amazing', 'musical', 'parts', 'inserted', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'usually', 'associated', 'part', 'A', 'creepy', 'guy', 'B', 'weird', 'guy', 'here', 'side', 'great', 'entertainer', 'Not', 'only', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'amaaing', 'dancing', 'fact', 'film', 'show', 'skills', 'may', 'say', 'vanity', 'talent', 'still', 'undeniable.The', 'supprts', 'include', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'none', 'are', 'as', 'effective', 'Kevin', 'Sapcey', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'who', 'too', 'soon', 'film', 'really', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'liked', ""'Blue"", 'Crush', 'hardly', 'chemistry', 'Spacey', 'believe', 'Bobby', 'Sandra', 'are', 'married', 'Real', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'was', 'younger', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'six', 'years', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'gifted', 'younger', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', '24', 'years', 'too', 'much', 'real', 'complaint', 'not', 'know', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'long', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'determined', 'be', 'professional', 'singer', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'great', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'However', 'Kevin', 'somehow', 'decided', 'using', ""'frames"", 'unorthdox', 'storytelling', 'used', 'also', ""'De-Lovely"", 'Kevin', 'Bobby', 'life', 'guided', 'child', 'actor', 'playing', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'childhood', 'Why', 'not', 'use', 'more', 'orthodox', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'when', 'good', 'story', 'hand', 'one', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'indirectly', 'answer', 'media', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'role', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'scene', 'fact', 'opening', 'Kevin', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'singing', 'middle', 'Knife', 'part', 'shooting', 'bio-pic', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Take', 'away', 'self-conscious', 'moments', 'clearly', 'lessen', 'impact', 'story', 'Sea', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better.Still', 'songs', 'dances', 'are', 'great', 'full', 'energy', 'expert', 'skills', 'first-rate', 'artists', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reaction', 'like', 'film', 'showcase', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'talent']",N/A

Spacey clearly is responsible for what is wrong with this picture and what little is right. One of many 2004 biopics, it didn't impress critics or audiences and, after watching this new DVD release, no one will wonder why.Spacey catches the impatience that drove Darin to achieve success and the pathos of the popularity that was soon to wane. The tribulations of his parentage, marriage and evolving personality, with its later preocupation with politics, give weight to the narrative, and the show biz period detail seems authentic. The production numbers are borne of Dennis Potter's ""Pennies From Heaven"" and ""The Singing Detective,"" and they are sometimes diverting.Spacey is too old to play the role and too ordinary a singer (it's his own voice) to snap his fingers with Darin's brio. Moreover, telling his story within a story of the singer seeking his identify in tandem with himself as a child, all told inside the conceit of filming a biopic about Darin, is needlessly confusing. The child playing the boy is a comer, however, and such dependable actors as John Goodman, Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn and an urecognizable Greta Scacchi do manage to register.Spacey gets credit for attempting to capture a person in a period that still resonates with its take on the folly in Vietnam reflecting the current folly in Iraq. Yet any  sympathy for the real Darin and his troubled family does not emerge from the fantasy script or the performances. The potential for a better picture is there.

901212,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00094ARN2,Wanda B. Red,"[1, 3]","While this film itself -- in its plot and structure -- is quite imperfect, Kevin Spacey's impersonation of the late, great Bobby Darin makes it worth watching. His ability to mimic Darin's singing style, his moves onstage, and even his voice are, to my view, uncanny. The film composes a moving tribute to the life and musical contribution of a rat packer who is too often forgotten. Also watch the ""Making of"" extra feature; it provides intriguing background, including the fact that all the scenes were shot in East Germany, where preservation of early twentieth-century architecture made it possible to recreate mid-century New York, jazz clubs, and other sites that would have seemed much less authentic had the film been made here in the USA.Given the quality of the acting (not only by Spacey but also by his gifted cast which includes Kate Bosworth, John Goodman, Brenda Blethyn, and Bob Hoskins), it's too bad that the film was so flawed in its conception. It serves up a kind of hash of other celebrity-life films -- the tumultuous marriage, the drinking problems, the difficulty of conducting personal life in the limelight -- which it wraps around in a pretentious metaplot along the lines of  ""All That Jazz"" that presents the making of the film as its own subject. The only good thing about that plot is that it permits the film to end on a high note, with a rousing reprise rather than a dreary deathbed sequence. The film's convoluted structure also gives more play to the talented boy-actor, William Ulrich, who brings tremendous musical ability to the part of the young Bobby.All in all, an entertaining but ultimately flawed production.",4,Worth it for the music,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1654,"['film', 'plot', 'structure', 'quite', 'imperfect', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'impersonation', 'late', 'great', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'worth', 'watching', 'ability', 'mimic', 'Darin', 'singing', 'style', 'moves', 'onstage', 'even', 'voice', 'are', 'view', 'uncanny', 'film', 'moving', 'tribute', 'life', 'musical', 'contribution', 'rat', 'packer', 'who', 'too', 'often', 'forgotten', 'Also', 'watch', 'Making', 'extra', 'feature', 'intriguing', 'background', 'including', 'fact', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'East', 'Germany', 'where', 'preservation', 'early', 'twentieth-century', 'architecture', 'made', 'possible', 'recreate', 'mid-century', 'New', 'York', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'other', 'sites', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'much', 'less', 'authentic', 'had', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'here', 'USA.Given', 'quality', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'Spacey', 'also', 'gifted', 'cast', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'flawed', 'conception', 'up', 'kind', 'hash', 'other', 'celebrity-life', 'films', 'tumultuous', 'marriage', 'drinking', 'problems', 'difficulty', 'conducting', 'personal', 'life', 'limelight', 'around', 'pretentious', 'metaplot', 'lines', 'All', 'Jazz', 'making', 'film', 'own', 'subject', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'plot', 'film', 'end', 'high', 'note', 'rousing', 'reprise', 'rather', 'dreary', 'deathbed', 'sequence', 'film', 'convoluted', 'structure', 'also', 'more', 'play', 'talented', 'boy-actor', 'William', 'Ulrich', 'who', 'tremendous', 'musical', 'ability', 'part', 'young', 'Bobby.All', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'production']",N/A
901213,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00094ARN2,William Hare,"[8, 9]","Kevin Spacey had a tremendous admiration for Bobby Darin and it shows in this fast paced story on the musical genius' life.  The pacing needed to be fast since Darin was a man on a mission.  Overcoming the handicap of a rheumatic heart, the clock was always ticking extra fast since he knew that each year he lived defied medical expectations.We hear the great Darin repertoire once more, the hit songs such as the title of the film, his big success ""Beyond the Sea"" along with the memorable ""Mack the Knife"", ""Splish Splash"" and so many others.  He moved fast from his New York City roots and dreams of playing The Copacabana in the manner of Hoboken, New Jersey's idol, and also Italian song master Frank Sinatra.  Darin soon realized the Copa ambition.  From there it was on to wowing them in Las Vegas, also in the manner of the great Sinatra.Spacey interacts well with Patricia Bosworth, who plays the part of his beautiful blonde actress wife Sandra Dee.  The facts are accurate concerning how they connected, in the dramatic atmosphere of Italy, the land of Bobby's roots.  He pursued Dee intensely, having to overcome her determined stage mother to secure her hand in marriage.  They were there to perform in the Universal film ""Come September"" starring Rock Hudson and Gina Lollabrigida.In addition to cataloguing Dee's success in popular youth films as Gidget and Tammy we also see Darin's triumph as he is nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Universal's ""Captain Newman"" starring Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson.  He is revealed as a competitive man who hated to lose at anything, as evidenced by his reaction to losing the Oscar to Melvyn Douglas, who appeared in ""Hud"" with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal.Another important element of Darin's life and career was his peace activism and role in the campaign of his friend, the man he admired so greatly, Senator Robert Kennedy.  One of the film's most touching scenes is his reaction to Kennedy's assassination after his victory in the California presidential primary.We cannot help but admire Darin's courage at the end of his life when, after open heart surgery, with the knowledge he does not have long to live, he defies the odds to the end as he continues performing.

I have hesitated on seeing this film, because I never expected to see Kevin Spacey in a musical biopic. To my surprise, I found his performance and singing to be very impressive. He really captured the essence of the old Hollywood performing style. His dance and singing gave me flashbacks of some of the old movies I have seen years ago. Kate Bosworth is convincing as Sandra Dee, because her youthful beauty is perfect to play her. I had no idea that Dee was not as sweet and nice like her movie images. She smokes and swears throughout the movie.Brenda Blethyn is amazing as Polly(Darin's non-biological mother who taught him to become an entertainer). Once again she proves that she's one of the best and versatile actresses from England and she does a very good American accent. Polly dies when Darin rose to the top of stardom as singer and movie star. Darin eventually persued the lovely Sandra Dee when when they were making a film together in Italy. Despite the disapproval of her controlling mother(Mary, played by the scene-stealing Greta Scacchi), they eventually fall in love and get marry.Life is good to Darin, he has money, a beautiful wife, a successful career, and gets nominated for an Oscar. Then his life goes downhill when his career comes crushing down.  He eventually have to go work the stages of Las Vegas in his prime in order to stay in the game. During that time, his biological mother confessed to him that Polly was not his real mother, and he was shocked by the news.....Overall, I enjoyed this film more than De-Lovely and Ray, because it's not as depressing, and it's more of a feel good musical biopic. This is probably Kevin Spacey's best work since American Beauty.",4,Beyond What I Have Expected of Kevin Spacey.,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,1886,"['First', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'make', 'much', 'judgement', 'impersonations', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'have', 'hesitated', 'seeing', 'film', 'never', 'expected', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'musical', 'biopic', 'surprise', 'found', 'performance', 'singing', 'be', 'very', 'impressive', 'really', 'captured', 'essence', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'performing', 'style', 'dance', 'singing', 'gave', 'flashbacks', 'old', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'ago', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'convincing', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'perfect', 'play', 'had', 'idea', 'Dee', 'was', 'not', 'sweet', 'nice', 'movie', 'images', 'swears', 'movie.Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'amazing', 'Polly', 'Darin', 'non-biological', 'mother', 'who', 'taught', 'become', 'entertainer', 'Once', 'again', 'one', 'best', 'versatile', 'actresses', 'England', 'very', 'good', 'American', 'accent', 'Polly', 'when', 'Darin', 'rose', 'top', 'stardom', 'singer', 'movie', 'star', 'Darin', 'eventually', 'persued', 'lovely', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'when', 'when', 'were', 'making', 'film', 'together', 'Italy', 'disapproval', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Mary', 'played', 'scene-stealing', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'marry.Life', 'good', 'Darin', 'money', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'successful', 'career', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Then', 'life', 'downhill', 'when', 'career', 'crushing', 'down', 'eventually', 'have', 'go', 'work', 'stages', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'prime', 'order', 'stay', 'game', 'time', 'biological', 'mother', 'confessed', 'Polly', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'mother', 'was', 'shocked', 'news', '..Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'De-Lovely', 'Ray', 'not', 'depressing', 'more', 'feel', 'good', 'musical', 'biopic', 'probably', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'best', 'work', 'American', 'Beauty']",N/A
