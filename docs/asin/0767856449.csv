23405,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,0767856449,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[40, 40]","This movie, which I saw for the first time in 1971, changed my life forever.  From the first moment of the film, I was struck by the stunning Afghan scenery.  Over the next three years, I visited Afghanistan three times.  It was a fantastic adventure, like a voyage in another time, on another planet.  Since then, I have not stopped travelling in this part of the World.The film is based on Joseph Kessel's (1898 - 1979) novel, ""Les Cavaliers,"" written following his travel throughout Afghanistan in the early 60's.  Kessel is, in the tradition of Saint-Exupery, Malraux, Pierre Mac Orlan, and Hemingway, an adventurer, journalist, globetrotter, and great writer, a man who tried to make the novel ""the privileged expression"" of the ""lived"" adventure.The movie, filmed for six months in Afghanistan, and then in Spain, in 1969-1970, was directed by John Frankenheimer. The picture cost $4.5 millions.  Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo recognized there was no need to embellish Kessel's fantastic adventure, and faithfully followed the book's story line.The action takes place on the vast plains around Maimana in the northwest of the country, across the forbidding Hindu Kush, and in Kabul.  Although the scenery and characters are timeless, the sight of a high-flying jet during a scene subtly establishes the movie's time period.  The drama revolves around the ""mad horse,"" Jahil, with its almost human presence.  Uraz (Omar Sharif), son of the great ""chapendaz"" Tursen (Jack Palance) is to ride Jahil, Tursen's latest prized white stallion, in the great ""buzkashi"" of the King, in Kabul.The Afghan national game of ""buzkashi"" dates back to the time of Ghengis Khan. In this fierce competition, played on the northern steppes by expert horsemen, everything goes. Hundreds of ""chapendaz"" horsemen independently compete to grab and carry the carcass of a goat or a small calf to the circle of justice, outlined on the field.If Uraz wins, Jahil is his to keep.  How can he not win?  ""If you cannot win on Jahil, you cannot win on any horse,"" says Tursen.  Uraz, like his father before him, is now the most famous ""chapendaz"" in the ""three (northern) provinces.""  Nevertheless, his quest for glory seems endless, as an inner demon keeps driving him to surpass both his father and himself.  An old lady in the bazaar says of him, ""If you wager him for glory, you will lose.  If for money, you will win.""At the ""buzkashi"" in Kabul, Uraz will know defeat.  He not only loses the game, but his leg is fractured.  His life lesson about pain and hate begins as he returns to Maimana, vanquished, prouder, more resolute, and crazier than ever.Uraz has the choice of two roads to return to Maimana: the relatively easy road across the terrible Hindu Kush Range, through the Salang Pass, the World's highest pass at 10,000 feet, or the dreadful ""old road,"" running through the Unai and Hajikak passes, both also near 10,000 feet, Bamiyan, followed by more high passes, before finally arriving on the northern steppes.  Of course, Uraz chooses the ""old road,"" challenging himself to the limit, in order to redeem himself in his own eyes, and also those of his father.  For all his toughness, his father had never traveled that road.As if the ""old road"" was not challenge enough, Uraz, whose fractured leg is fast becoming gangrenous, tempts his sais with a pact that involves ownership of the magnificent Jahil.Following his master, his good ""sais"" (groom), Mokkhi (David de Keyser), meets with love in the arms of the beautiful ""untouchable,"" Zareh (Leigh Taylor-Young), but also experiences greed, a taste for murder, and a pitiful downfall.  Zareh, as beautiful as she is devious, inspires Mokkhi to murder and destruction.  She is herself tormented by ""the horse"": ""Do you know, great Prince, what brought me to you that first night?...it was the horse.""  Along this endless ""old road,"" the trio each confronts the worst in themselves, and arrive at their destination perverted and lost.  There is also the mysterious and likable character, Hayatal (Peter Jeffrey) with whom Uraz will eventually continue wandering the steppes.The stunning cinematography is the result of the collaboration of the disinguished French cinematographer Claude Renoir (of the artistic lineage,) Andre Domage, and James Wong Howe.  They give an accurate taste of the beauty of the rugged Afghan country and of its people.  In particular, the remarkable sequences of the ""buzkashi"" of the King, in Kabul, and the flashback of Tursen's ""buzkashi"" through the great open steppes of the north, are worth the price of the admission by themselves.  There are also actual scenes of organized fights between camels, rams, and partridges (the Afghans are big gamblers).The casting of westerners as principles may seem strange at first, until one remembers that there were neither TV nor movies in Afghanistan, in 1970, and therefore no Afghan actors. Frankenheimer wanted Yves Montand or James Garner for the lead, but learning that he was an expert rider, chose Omar Sarif instead. The ""buzkashi"" scenes required 25 days of shooting. Of course, Sharif had to appear in some of these scenes, but the ""chapandaz,"" impressed by his superior riding, unobtrusively ""chaperoned"" him through the most dangerous moments.  Omar Sharif gives one of his best, if not the best, performances ever.  On the other hand, Jack Palance was not skillful enough to ride in the mayhem of the game, and required an Afghan rider stand-in for these sequences.  However, with his both feet on the ground, Palance's presence on the screen is overwhelming.  As I traveled through the northern provinces of the country, I must have met two or three Palances, and as many Sharifs.  By some extraordinary coincidence, Leigh Taylor-Young also bears a strong resemblance to the now famous ""Afghan girl,"" who appeared on the front cover of the National Geographic Magazine, in 1984.  Physically at least, the choices for the leading characters were fortunate.The renowned French composer Georges Delerue (more than 47 film scores) wrote the music, remarkable in its lyricism and romanticism, which integrates itself perfectly in the film.""The Horsemen"" is a stunning film, inspired by epic adventure and timeless conflicts which, given the present condition in Afghanistan, I am afraid can only now be experienced in an armchair.",5,A beautiful adventure,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,6353,"['movie', 'saw', 'first', 'time', '1971', 'changed', 'life', 'forever', 'first',

23406,A31BBNT8C62MLU,0767856449,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[2, 3]","When this film began I was struck by the fantastic cinematography and the stunning beauty of Afghanistan.  It's a gorgeous film, as are the faces of Omar Sharif, Leigh Taylor-Young, Jack Palance and the Afghan men who worked as extras, striking. But I found this film very disturbing, with no payoff for my distress or disgust- thus this review, for those with similar sensibilities.SPOILERS FOLLOW:My idea of entertainment is not watching animals get torn to pieces, fights to the death between camels, rams, cocks, dogs, or horses.  The camel fight in particular was one of the most awful things I've ever seen (NOT simulated, and to the death).  It is patently obvious that many animals, particularly horses, were hurt/killed in the making of the film.Featured is a harsh environment in which men plot against each other, bet against each other on various forms of animal battles to the death (while looking on gleefully), and plan all year for the shockingly brutal ""sport"" called Bozkeshi (as reviewer Tom Keogh describes it- few of the reviews here even mention the brutality towards animals).  In the Bozkeshi competition, men on horseback vie for possession of a calf that is first decapitated; they kick and beat each other and each others' horses with whips and sticks, trying to snatch the body from whomever has possession.  The ultimate goal is to carry it across the finish line.  In the interminable Bozkeshi scene countless horses were obviously hurt and likely died of their injuries.  Men were also injured, I'm sure, but of course their participation was by choice, presumably.There are films I like that are disquieting and difficult to watch, such as Midnight Cowboy and A Clockwork Orange (though of course in these the violence is simulated).  A redeeming quality for me of these films is an underlayer of tenderness and tragedy, the sense that the camera and the film has empathy for the characters.  I care about them, or at least I learn something about them.  But I didn't care about any of the characters here.  Sharif is obviously tortured, by what is not clear.  He's cold and cruel to the point of sociopathy.  He meets a beautiful slave girl who nurses him and saves his life.  He repays her by calling her an untouchable whore and giving her to a friend- later, after having sex with her himself he has her dumped by the side of the road (and tells his minions that if she says anything, to cut her throat).He has a conflict with his father, played by Jack Palance- we never find out exactly what it is, though there are hints that he may want to gain his approval, perhaps be a better horseman than he.  What drives him?  Other reviews, here and elsewhere, pay homage to a theme involving a man testing his own mettle, and achieving victory in the face of overwhelming odds.  One, it's been much better done elsewhere, in films where we're afforded a glimpse into the emotional life of the characters (A Man Called Horse, Raging Bull, dozens of others).  Two, his victory is hollow and meaningless, the ending extremely unsatisfying, with Sharif heading for parts unknown, deciding to live the life of a nomad.  One is tempted to conclude, for closure's sake, that it's a reaction to, a rejection of the brutality of his culture, but that's wishful thinking and sheer projection because we're never afforded the slightest glimpse into Sharif's inner life or mind, never shown anything that suggests evolution or growth.But even if the script had been better, I cannot overlook or condone the abuse of animals, especially as a corollary to ""art"" or a profit-making enterprise.  Were this a documentary about life in Afghanistan, it would be included as part of the fabric of life there, certainly.  I would still be disturbed by scenes of animals suffering, and human beings reveling in their pain, but at least such scenes would have SOME justification.  Also, I would imagine, would be included scenes of intimate connections, family life, spirituality, aspects to balance the depiction of the Afghan people.  For me, this film is one long exercise in gratuitous violence, and gorgeous scenery and striking performances cannot redeem it.  If you love animals or are tender of heart, skip this and see ""The Story of the Weeping Camel"" instead- IT will make you glad to be alive and a member of the human race.The Story of the Weeping Camel",1,"Gratuitous violence, animal abuse, & misogyny- not my cup of tea",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,4373,"['When', 'film', 'began', 'was', 'struck', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'Afghanistan', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'are', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Leigh', 'Taylor-Young', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Afghan', 'men', 'who', 'worked', 'extras', 'striking', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'payoff', 'distress', 'disgust-', 'thus', 'review', 'similar', 'sensibilities.SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'idea', 'entertainment', 'not', 'watching', 'animals', 'get', 'torn', 'pieces', 'fights', 'death', 'camels', 'rams', 'cocks', 'dogs', 'horses', 'camel', 'fight', 'particular', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'awful', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'NOT', 'simulated', 'death', 'patently', 'obvious', 'many', 'animals', 'particularly', 'horses', 'were', 'hurt/killed', 'making', 'film.Featured', 'harsh', 'environment', 'men', 'plot', 'other', 'bet', 'other', 'various', 'forms', 'animal', 'battles', 'death', 'looking', 'gleefully', 'plan', 'year', 'shockingly', 'brutal', 'sport', 'called', 'Bozkeshi', 'reviewer', 'Tom', 'Keogh', 'it-', 'few', 'reviews', 'here', 'even', 'mention', 'brutality', 'animals', 'Bozkeshi', 'competition', 'men', 'horseback', 'vie', 'possession', 'calf', 'first', 'decapitated', 'kick', 'beat', 'other', 'others', 'horses', 'whips', 'sticks', 'trying', 'snatch', 'body', 'whomever', 'possession', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'carry', 'finish', 'line', 'interminable', 'Bozkeshi', 'scene', 'countless', 'horses', 'were', 'obviously', 'hurt', 'likely', 'died', 'injuries', 'Men', 'were', 'also', 'injured', ""'m"", 'sure', 'course', 'participation', 'was', 'choice', 'are', 'films', 'like', 'are', 'disquieting', 'difficult', 'watch', 'such', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'course', 'violence', 'simulated', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'films', 'underlayer', 'tenderness', 'tragedy', 'sense', 'camera', 'film', 'empathy', 'characters', 'care', 'least', 'learn', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'here', 'Sharif', 'obviously', 'tortured', 'what', 'not', 'clear', 'cold', 'cruel', 'point', 'sociopathy', 'beautiful', 'slave', 'girl', 'who', 'saves', 'life', 'calling', 'untouchable', 'whore', 'giving', 'friend-', 'later', 'having', 'sex', 'dumped', 'side', 'road', 'minions', 'anything', 'cut', 'throat', '.He', 'conflict', 'father', 'played', 'Jack', 'Palance-', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'hints', 'may', 'want', 'gain', 'approval', 'perhaps', 'be', 'better', 'horseman', 'What', 'Other', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'pay', 'homage', 'theme', 'involving', 'man', 'testing', 'own', 'mettle', 'achieving', 'victory', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'One', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'elsewhere', 'films', 'where', ""'re"", 'afforded', 'glimpse', 'emotional', 'life', 'characters', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'dozens', 'others', 'Two', 'victory', 'hollow', 'meaningless', 'ending', 'extremely', 'unsatisfying', 'Sharif', 'heading', 'parts', 'unknown', 'deciding', 'live', 'life', 'nomad', 'One', 'tempted', 'conclude', 'closure', 'sake', 'reaction', 'rejection', 'brutality', 'culture', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'sheer', 'projection', ""'re"", 'never', 'afforded', 'slightest', 'glimpse', 'Sharif', 'inner', 'life', 'mind', 'never', 'shown', 'anything', 'evolution', 'growth.But', 'even', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'can', 'not', 'overlook', 'condone', 'abuse', 'animals', 'especially', 'corollary', 'art', 'profit-making', 'enterprise', 'Were', 'documentary', 'life', 'Afghanistan', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'part', 'fabric', 'life', 'there', 'certainly', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'disturbed', 'scenes', 'animals', 'suffering', 'human', 'beings', 'reveling', 'pain', 'least', 'such', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'SOME', 'justification', 'Also', 'would', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'scenes', 'intimate', 'connections', 'family', 'life', 'spirituality', 'aspects', 'balance', 'depiction', 'Afghan', 'people', 'film', 'one', 'long', 'exercise', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'striking', 'performances', 'can', 'not', 'redeem', 'love', 'animals', 'are', 'tender', 'heart', 'skip', 'see', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel', 'instead-', 'IT', 'will', 'make', 'glad', 'be', 'alive', 'member', 'human', 'race.The', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel']",N/A
