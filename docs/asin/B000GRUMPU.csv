1006271,A1DS5AROCQZ4L6,B000GRUMPU,40yo Average American White Guy,"[8, 10]","Here's something I never, ever say about a movie: ""Poseidon"" is too short. The opening shot, a fake-o special effect circle around the ship, lasts nearly 3 minutes. I don't think any sequence that follows it lasts as long.All major characters and storylines are sketched into place and the ship flipped within the first 15 minutes (and that's taking at least 100 seconds to have the Black-Eyed Peas chick sing a song). Scenes whip along so quickly and with such a sense of rush that you do, indeed, feel like you're running cuz the ship is rapidly sinking... which would be good, if you'd ever had time to care about any of the characters.The acting is passable, and Josh Lucas is actually pretty good in the lead. All the stuff blowing up and the water rushing about looks good enough. None of that's the problem.The problem IS, you just don't care. You don't know anything at all about any of the characters (okay, I'm exaggerating: there's a young couple that you know are in love. There.) And there's no sense of a Big Plan being executed, so you could get involved in whether it's gonna work out. Yes, somebody spits out ""Let's head for the propeller tubes!"" and off they go...Rush rush rush. It's not just that there's no extra time devoted to developing the characters: scenes that SHOULD be there aren't. Example (SPOILER WARNING) we learn in about twenty words of dialogue that Richard Dreyfuss' character is gay and has been dumped. Fine. We see him about to kill himself over this by jumping overboard. Fine. He sees the ""rogue wave"" approaching and retreats. Okay. He's the only character who lives through the first 15 minutes who actually SAW what happened to them: he never mentions it. A few minutes later, he is required, basically, to deliberately kill another character to save himself. It's rather twisted, but there is an irony there that deserves at least a pause for his suicidal character to take a moment to examine. Nada. Nope, no time for reflection, we gotta hit the next explosion shot, RUN!Since it ended so quickly, I took the time to watch the ""Making Of"" special feature, and from the interviews, you could tell that Wolfgang Petersen thought he was doing a good job, Lucas was very excited about what they were doing, many crew members believed they were working on a film that would be cutting-edge and state-of-the-art. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and have decided to assume that some idiotic producer demanded they trim the film down to an hour-and-a-half, to maximize the number of showings per day, and so, in the process, they edited this thing down to a skeleton, slicing out all the ""fat"" that might have made it compelling.It's a true shame. Hokey though the 1972 original was, it was involving and a whole lot of fun. A solid remake using today's special effects and approach to narrative was a great idea. Who knows? Maybe now that this outline was booed off the screen, Petersen will be given the chance to go back to the editing room and re-cut us a 2 1/2 hour version that WILL be worth watching.

1006272,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000GRUMPU,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 2]","Oh Kurt Russel, what happened to you? Your roles in movies like The Thing and 3000 Miles to Graceland were great, and now you're like a cheap prostitute for a movie role. You just had to pick a worthless role of a father of a teenage daughter with all the stupid drama thrown in... a disaster movie. Great....WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Think of this movie as a combination of Titanic and The Perfect Storm. Then, remove the great characters and replace them with characters so worthless you care less about them being killed than stupid teenagers who get killed in horror movies, and then add liberal politics into the mix. During a cruise on the Poseidon, a gigantic freak wave causes the ship to capsize (flip upside down), trapping several people on board with a limited air bubble while they wait for help to come. But, a group of people decide not to wait and try to escape; a gambler, the gambler's smuggled girlfriend, a homosexual old man (Uuuugggghhhh....), an annoying kid (Why couldn't you drown in the movie?) and his mom, the mayor of New York (Kurt Russel), his daughter, and her boyfriend.MUSIC: The music is bland and rarely sets the mood. It can at key moments, but fails to the rest of the time.ACTION: The best parts of the film are scenes with the ship being flipped over, people drowning, things being turned over and destroyed, explosions, and some extra action. The action is the best part, too bad the whole film couldn't be filled with a lot more of those moments.ACTING: The script is full of predictable dialogue, and the actors don't do a very good job bringing the already sub-par script to life. Their acting capabilities are laughable at best.ENTERTAINMENT: You will only want to watch this movie for the action scenes, not really anything else. If you wish to see all of it, I hope you have humor, because you will only get pissed off if you don't. Take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them, because they are laughable (Yay! We've escaped! Oh look, there just so happens to be a raft over there).OVERALL: I would only recommend this as a rental for now, not a buy. I managed to take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them for how bad they were, but this film was overall very disappointing and had so much more potential. Plus, adding politics into the mix, kinda ruins the experience. Decent overall, but disappointing.THE GOOD: The action moments.THE BAD: The acting, the politics, predictable dialogue and events, unintentionally funny.",3,DISAPPOINTMENT...  7 OUT OF 10,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2467,"['Oh', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'what', 'happened', 'roles', 'movies', 'Thing', '3000', 'Miles', 'Graceland', 'were', 'great', 'now', ""'re"", 'cheap', 'prostitute', 'movie', 'role', 'just', 'had', 'pick', 'worthless', 'role', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'stupid', 'drama', 'thrown', 'disaster', 'movie', 'Great', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Think', 'movie', 'combination', 'Titanic', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Then', 'remove', 'great', 'characters', 'replace', 'characters', 'so', 'care', 'less', 'being', 'killed', 'stupid', 'teenagers', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'horror', 'movies', 'then', 'add', 'liberal', 'politics', 'mix', 'cruise', 'Poseidon', 'gigantic', 'freak', 'wave', 'ship', 'capsize', 'flip', 'upside', 'down', 'trapping', 'several', 'people', 'board', 'limited', 'air', 'bubble', 'wait', 'help', 'come', 'group', 'people', 'decide', 'not', 'wait', 'try', 'escape', 'gambler', 'gambler', 'smuggled', 'girlfriend', 'homosexual', 'old', 'man', 'Uuuugggghhhh', 'annoying', 'kid', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'drown', 'movie', 'mom', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'daughter', 'boyfriend.MUSIC', 'music', 'bland', 'rarely', 'mood', 'can', 'key', 'moments', 'rest', 'time.ACTION', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'ship', 'being', 'flipped', 'people', 'drowning', 'things', 'being', 'turned', 'destroyed', 'explosions', 'extra', 'action', 'action', 'best', 'part', 'too', 'bad', 'whole', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'filled', 'lot', 'more', 'moments.ACTING', 'script', 'full', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'already', 'sub-par', 'script', 'life', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'are', 'laughable', 'best.ENTERTAINMENT', 'will', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'wish', 'see', 'hope', 'have', 'humor', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'pissed', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'Take', 'advantage', 'flaws', 'laugh', 'are', 'laughable', 'Yay', ""'ve"", 'escaped', 'Oh', 'look', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'raft', 'there', '.OVERALL', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'rental', 'now', 'not', 'buy', 'managed', 'take', 'advantage', 'flaws', 'laugh', 'how', 'bad', 'were', 'film', 'was', 'overall', 'very', 'disappointing', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'adding', 'politics', 'mix', 'kinda', 'experience', 'Decent', 'overall', 'disappointing.THE', 'GOOD', 'action', 'moments.THE', 'BAD', 'acting', 'politics', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'events', 'unintentionally', 'funny']",N/A
1006273,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GRUMPU,A Customer,"[20, 24]","Director Wolfgang Peterson seems to be in such a terrible hurry with Poseidon - everything moves at such a fast pace that the characters - and the viewers - rarely have enough time to stop for a mouthful of air. And while the movie campy fun and as suspenseful as the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure, the film is certainly short and most definitely to the point.In this remake you see lots of extras die as their world is turned upside down one New Year's Eve, with little warning once the ""rogue wave"" is sighted and heads towards the doomed luxury liner. Overcome by flooding, shorting electricity and baked by flash fires, the expendable masses yield with barely more than a shocked glimpse, hands clapped over mouths and last-minute hugs with total strangers.As the Disco and swimming pool, galleys and grand suites and of course the grand ballroom go belly-up, there's the bunch of heroic characters that defy the Captain and decide to head-onward and upward through the waterlogged, overturned ship in feats that call for a deep-sea suspension of disbelief. No matter, because the delectable Josh Lucas leads this eclectic, mismatched gang, and wouldn't you follow him!Alas, there's no Shelly Winters-like character in this version. The protagonists all come across, as rather nameless and faceless, blandness is the order of the day here. Kurt Russell plays a devoted father, and the ex-Mayor of New York, Richard Dreyfuss is lamenting being dumped by his boyfriend, Josh Lucas is a gambler and I think a fireman - which is why of course he knows the workings of the luxury liner backwards.Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mia Maestro, Mike Vogel and Kevin Dillon round at the crowd. And they all have remarkably strong lung capacity, considering how long they have to spend underwater! But it doesn't really matter who's who, or who will sink or swim because once the ship flips, character development isn't high on the list of this movie's agenda.Obviously the special effects are what it's all about and there's tons and tons of rushing water, exploding electrical circuits, people caught in air-conditioning shafts and being burnt to death by sudden fires - it's all big and loud and contains some expert stunt work and superb integration of digital technology.The direction is mostly crisp and although it all gets a bit repetitious towards the end - it also becomes hard to figure out what is going on - the film mostly works because it steps up its dramatic speed early on, and its pacing never falters.

Great movie, we saw it 100+ times and we DON'T wanna go back! Wanna know why? Cause besides the fact that there were far more deaths on Titanic (more tragic), Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this and that there is one maybe two main characters you'll actually recognize in this one (I recognized Kurt Russell only), this movie was FAR BETTER in EVERY OTHER WAY.Who cares that Titanic had a better orchestra, we're here to see the action: People dying, surviving and overcoming tragic occurrences and once the boat starts to capsize, sink and fill with deathly water, the action truly never stops. If anything, it slows down, but NEVER stops, TRUST IN ME.The characters were pretty good. I won't say who died but I will say that I won't be surprised if someone who's watching with you (if you're not a movie loner) sheds a tear or starts to seriously ball before the very end.The people involved in this tiny tragedy were pretty expressive, especially the females. When Kurt Russell went back to stop the propeller fans that stood in the way of true freedom instead of his daughter's husband/boyfriend/fiancee, his daughter began to sulk. And when it took a while for him to come back (does he come back? Find out!) she broke down and I did too. I shed a small tear out my right eye as I felt half as bad as she did at the time. Very decent acting. Even the kid was just beneath brilliance!The ending was very sad but not without light. The actors and actresses put on a damn good show and the special effects were decent and aplenty.--Not Titanic 2.0 (Thank goodness)--Good acting--Music is kept in the background once the ship capsizes--Action aplenty--Special effects here and there and here again--Characters meet their fears eye to eye and face them--So worth your time--Don't listen to the naysayersCover Art: A- (Frightening but puts the movie into perspective, summing it up without really watching it first)Inside Art: N/ACharacters: ADialogue: B-Story: C+Comedy Relief: D+Music Score: D- (I hardly remember anything besides the lame music that played when everyone was fine and laughing...)Length: A4.45 stars.Overall: A-",5,"Love gained and lost and many brutal, brutal deaths = Titanic 2.0?",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2315,"['NO', 'NOT', 'THANK', 'G', 'O', 'D', 'Yes', 'what', 'was', 'Titanic', 'classic', 'then', 'Great', 'movie', 'saw', '100+', 'times', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'wan', 'go', 'back', 'Wan', 'na', 'know', 'why', 'Cause', 'fact', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'deaths', 'Titanic', 'more', 'tragic', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'main', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'recognize', 'one', 'recognized', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'FAR', 'BETTER', 'EVERY', 'OTHER', 'WAY.Who', 'Titanic', 'had', 'better', 'orchestra', ""'re"", 'here', 'see', 'action', 'People', 'dying', 'surviving', 'overcoming', 'tragic', 'occurrences', 'once', 'boat', 'capsize', 'sink', 'fill', 'deathly', 'water', 'action', 'truly', 'never', 'anything', 'down', 'NEVER', 'stops', 'TRUST', 'IN', 'ME.The', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'died', 'will', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'someone', 'who', 'watching', ""'re"", 'not', 'movie', 'loner', 'tear', 'seriously', 'ball', 'very', 'end.The', 'people', 'involved', 'tiny', 'tragedy', 'were', 'pretty', 'expressive', 'especially', 'females', 'When', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'went', 'back', 'stop', 'propeller', 'fans', 'stood', 'way', 'true', 'freedom', 'instead', 'daughter', 'husband/boyfriend/fiancee', 'daughter', 'began', 'sulk', 'when', 'took', 'while', 'come', 'back', 'come', 'back', 'broke', 'down', 'did', 'too', 'shed', 'small', 'tear', 'right', 'eye', 'felt', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'did', 'time', 'Very', 'decent', 'acting', 'Even', 'kid', 'was', 'just', 'beneath', 'brilliance', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'not', 'light', 'actors', 'actresses', 'put', 'damn', 'good', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'decent', 'aplenty.', 'Not', 'Titanic', '2.0', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Good', 'acting', 'Music', 'kept', 'background', 'ship', 'Action', 'aplenty', 'Special', 'effects', 'here', 'there', 'here', 'again', 'Characters', 'meet', 'fears', 'eye', 'eye', 'face', 'So', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'naysayersCover', 'Art', 'A-', 'Frightening', 'movie', 'perspective', 'summing', 'up', 'really', 'watching', 'first', 'Art', 'N/ACharacters', 'ADialogue', 'B-Story', 'C+Comedy', 'Relief', 'D+Music', 'Score', 'D-', 'hardly', 'remember', 'anything', 'lame', 'music', 'played', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'fine', 'laughing', 'Length', 'A4.45', 'stars.Overall', 'A-']",N/A

I knew modern effects would be outstanding without even seeing it. I dont know why many of the reviews are putting an enphasis on that as if it wasnt expected. Yes, the old school acting was missing. There was passion in trying to escape, but the interaction of confusion, anger and pure uncertainty was not present. Fortunately, the level of fear was maintained solidly to somewhat compensate. I wasnt expecting a duplicate of the original, but a few more connections would have been nice along with a cameo or trivia point. The charactors where very thin and I believe the movie was way to short. The onset of the wave came too fast and much development was lacking in relation to the captain and his crew. Finding others in another area of the ship would have added to the film, with their eventual peril of course. Richard Dreyfus shaking off a passenger from his leg was a frightening touch, but I feel is a reflection of our current society. When ""Chris"" says to his girl , ""I need you to tell me you love me"", I thought I was watching acting from Night of the Living Dead, very empty. I thought the film was a bit overly dark at times. On the plus side the film started to get a good feel to as the water rushed in. Looking at the flipped ship was spectacular and realism took hold watching the constant electrical problems. The sound was awesome(if you have a good system). In a big scope way I was pulled in enough to enjoy the excitement . Filmmaker Peterson needed to realize that there was more then the rush to escape from the original.

Very very unrealistic and cheap CGI made the entire boat glossy and very artificial.  Remember many portions of this movie are shot on a green screen stage...  So you can tell nearly every shot of the movie is shot in lighting a half meter different than the virtual background (the indoor shots of the ship and the outdoor shots) the only real sound stages used in the movie were for the bedrooms, the captains deck, oh and some of the crappy, dark and 80's neon destructive backgrounds after the ship flips over.  It's insane how the ship turns from a 5 star cruise ship, to a resident evil meets Bladerunner catastrophe.  If you think that this movie is going to handle a ship wreck as well as they did in the Titanic, you're gravely mistaken.The movie's intro is 10 minutes of learning about 6 character's sad and pathetic lives and what dysfunctions their having with parents, lovers etc.  Then, literally 3 minutes later in the movie everything goes completely to hell.  The acting is terrible and all over the map, with Kurt Russell playing over the top, Dreyfus is an 80 year old hack, and all the other B role characters are completely pathetic even that blonde young guy I don't know his name and he doesn't deserve to be recognized by name anyways because his acting was so awful.Literally 35-40 minutes into the movie my friend and I looked at each other laughing to tears at how terrible this movie was and I cursed him for renting it.  There is NOTHING good about this movie.  On top of bad acting, cheesey dialogue, bad special effects, and a terrible soundtrack (okay the Orchestrated parts are okay, but the black eye peas girl is horrendous) this movie has the Goriest scenes you'll see in any current blockbuster.  Mind you this isn't as gory as the Hills Have Eyes, or Descent, but it does show many close up shots of dead peoples bloodied faces and mangle limbs, and not to mention, half the cast gets killed in incredibly morbid and horrifying ways.  Something no kids should be subjected to.  Some of the death scenes made me sick to my stomach.  I can't believe ANYBODY with taste in movies would want to see this.  I can thankfully say I didn't spend any money on renting it and neither should you.

It is raw and earthy and stunning to watch.  It never grows tired, it remains deep and challenging in parts and it rises above the restraints of the genre with a slew of deeply settled performances that are rooted in actual character progression.This 2006 remake has some nice CGI.Sadly, that is all that exists here.  There was no need for this other than to show off some great special effects, and it does that to a degree (I found the waves in A Perfect Storm much grander, to be honest).  The problem here is that there is no depth of story, and the script is so preposterous that it leaves you completely baffled at the fact that this was green lit at all.  The performances are mere surface, with no heart or soul (and you need that if you are going to root for anyone here).  Richard Dreyfuss is especially repulsive here; just hard to watch (and I love him more than most, as a rule).  Like another reviewer mentioned, this film is just bland.

Thanks you for spitting out another INSTANTLY forgettable ""Blockbuster"" Thank God I only paid $4 dollars to see this. Not only can't the Studios come up with original material. The material they remake is worse than the original. If this crap keeps up you will have even less of an audience. A good cast given nothing to chew on and a Director who has made great films and this is what we get? $150 million and the Ballroom set in the original was more impressive?Video games are so prevalent in society that I fear their mind numbing influence is starting to permeate even NON video game derived movies. The original movie was a good solid, involving movie. This remake takes every element of the original and removes what made it involving. I mean EVERY element. There are people out there making these decisions!! And they are paid huge sums to make these decisions! With the talent in front of and behind the camera this is truly frightening as this seems to be the norm at the present.Right from the start there is almost NO set up. We don't know where the ship is, where it is sailing, even what ocean it's on! Things that actually would create some atmosphere like the originals speech by the Captain explaining the origin of Poseidon. Greek God of the Sea. They are sailing on the Mediterranean, to Greece? Get it? Cheesy but involving. You know it gives the proceedings some gravatis, some mystery. In the remake we get nothing, we are are in Video game land, we don't have time for such things.Even the cause for the disaster has absolutely no set up. Happy new year, bang, the tidal wave hits. Unlike the originals slow build up, as it explained WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHY! Even the effects in the original worked better. They were simpler but executed as a whole created more of an impact because of the tension that was built up. Again a sense of gravity, HUMAN INVOLVEMENT and Atmosphere! Even in the original, Leslie Nielsen's corny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster. It's a very basic cinematic technique. But I guess todays more ""sophisticated"" audience don't need this kind of thing anymore.There is no human involvement in the wave hitting in this remake. The Captain isn't called to the bridge, no build up, just some crew members we've had no contact with running around. Absolutely unmemorable. The effects are impressive but who cares, I'm not given anything to latch on to.Straight across the board EVERY situation is diminished from the original. The scene chewing conflict between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine is totally lost in the remake. There is NO conflict with the characters. NONE! It's just one disaster to overcome to the next. You know , like a VIDEO GAME.Even the self sacrificing Shelly Winters death swim has almost no emotional impact because the character doesn't return and die in front of everybody. Like DUH! Hey screen writers perhaps you should learn of something called ELEMENTS OF DRAMA!! Even if you have no talent you could at least COPY the original, not make it worse! Absolutely mind boggling!! If you WANTED to sabotage the original, you couldn't have done a better job. UNREAL! All you film lovers just keep repeating ""Things will get better"".

So much so, that during a particularly thrilling sequence in the middle of the movie, in which all the characters are racing up a very tight air conditioner vent to avoid the rising water, that I almost vomitted. Perhaps it had to do with the massive amount of popcorn I inhaled during the previews. Nonetheless, the movie was extremely thrilling and I had such a blast, a bigger blast than watching The Da Vinci Code (which was less thriller and more mystery). I love to begin the summer movie season with an excellent thriller!!Poseidon boasts an all-star cast, including Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and the heartthrob Josh Lucas, incredible special effects, and decent performances all around. Here's the story, in short, a giant wave crashes into a luxury oceanliner, killing everyone on board, except a precious few who defy captain's orders and manage to wriggle and run their way through the destroyed, and upside down floating, oceanliner. Each character is key in some way, performing a ""thank God we have this person on board"" action at some point during the movie.When the captain spies that giant wave coming at the cruiseliner, you'll instantly grab your seat in shock and awe. Because it's a giant wave. And it's much more impressive this time around than in the original.

I DID care about that little boy who almost didn't make it towards the end of the film.

It is bound to be compared to 9/11, the overseas tsunami, or Hurricane Katrina.  Yes, it is a particularly sensitive time within the world today given these disasters that happened.However, everyone has different tastes in movies and some find escapism in action/adventure films. Some, like me, are fascinated with the element of survival and how individuals fight to get out of difficult situations.  Yes, some like myself also like special effects and disaster movies.Second, while movie critics have every right to share their opinion in hopes we will all listen to them and follow their advice, my advice is to see the movie if you want to and formulate your own opinion.That said, I observed the film ""Poseidon"" today and found it a very suspenseful action adventure film.  I saw the original and to this day it is one of my favorites, therefore felt drawn to see how it could be remade.As expected, the computer animated effects were excellent, although at times a bit unrealistic (in the original Poseidon Adventure, the wave actually looked much more realistic). However, the destruction within the ship was breathtaking and shocking, depicting just what might happen if a large luxury liner nowdays capsized.I agree with the critics that not much character development was present.  I'm not for sure if director Peterson meant to rush the film's opening sequences along, but it was here's the ship, a few characters, it's New Year's Eve, here's the wave (out of nowhere with no explanation as to how it developed) and bam-the ship's upside down.  I for one tend to disagree with the film's 99 minute running length; more shots of characters withinin the ship's surroundings to get to know them better prior to the disaster would have been more sufficient, but that's just my opinion.However, Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, and Jimmy Bennett who played the young boy play their roles well and I found myself caring more about the characters as the movie went along, despite the lack of dialogue within the non stop action.The surprising thing I found within the film is that the survivors, while making their way through the ship, saw no other survivors, only multitudes of dead bodies which I found strange given the ship's huge size.  Encountering others or picking up another survivor along the escape route would have added to the realism.All in all, Poseidon was worth the money.  My advice is that if you are not in the mood for a disaster movie with realism when it comes to death (movie critics have criticized the carnage-what do you think is going to happen if a ship capsizes?  People are going to die, some will survive, it's a fact), find another film you will enjoy.However, if you're like me and enjoy disaster movies with special effects, action/adventure (plenty of explosions, suspenseful escape scenes abound here, the what is going to happen next factor keeps the adrenaline pumping) and some good acting especially by Lucas, Russell, and Dreyfuss, it's worth your money.",3,An entertaining suspenseful disaster movie if you're in the mood for one,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,3183,"['extend', 'sympathy', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'signs', 'death', 'destruction', 'disaster', 'related', 'chaos', 'bound', 'be', 'compared', '9/11', 'overseas', 'tsunami', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'Yes', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'time', 'world', 'today', 'given', 'disasters', 'happened.However', 'everyone', 'different', 'tastes', 'movies', 'find', 'escapism', 'action/adventure', 'films', 'are', 'fascinated', 'element', 'survival', 'how', 'individuals', 'fight', 'get', 'difficult', 'situations', 'Yes', 'also', 'special', 'effects', 'disaster', 'movies.Second', 'movie', 'critics', 'have', 'right', 'share', 'opinion', 'hopes', 'will', 'listen', 'follow', 'advice', 'advice', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinion.That', 'said', 'observed', 'film', 'Poseidon', 'today', 'found', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'saw', 'original', 'day', 'one', 'favorites', 'therefore', 'felt', 'drawn', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'remade.As', 'expected', 'computer', 'animated', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'times', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'wave', 'actually', 'looked', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'However', 'destruction', 'ship', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'shocking', 'depicting', 'just', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'large', 'luxury', 'liner', 'nowdays', 'capsized.I', 'agree', 'critics', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'present', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'director', 'Peterson', 'meant', 'rush', 'film', 'opening', 'sequences', 'along', 'was', 'here', 'ship', 'few', 'characters', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'here', 'wave', 'nowhere', 'explanation', 'how', 'developed', 'bam-the', 'ship', 'upside', 'down', 'one', 'tend', 'disagree', 'film', '99', 'minute', 'running', 'length', 'more', 'shots', 'characters', 'withinin', 'ship', 'surroundings', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'prior', 'disaster', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sufficient', 'just', 'opinion.However', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'boy', 'play', 'roles', 'well', 'found', 'caring', 'more', 'characters', 'movie', 'went', 'along', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'non', 'stop', 'action.The', 'surprising', 'thing', 'found', 'film', 'survivors', 'making', 'way', 'ship', 'saw', 'other', 'survivors', 'only', 'multitudes', 'dead', 'bodies', 'found', 'strange', 'given', 'ship', 'huge', 'size', 'Encountering', 'others', 'picking', 'up', 'survivor', 'escape', 'route', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'realism.All', 'Poseidon', 'was', 'money', 'advice', 'are', 'not', 'mood', 'disaster', 'movie', 'realism', 'when', 'death', 'movie', 'critics', 'have', 'criticized', 'carnage-what', 'do', 'think', 'going', 'happen', 'ship', 'People', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'will', 'survive', 'fact', 'find', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy.However', ""'re"", 'enjoy', 'disaster', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'action/adventure', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'suspenseful', 'escape', 'scenes', 'here', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'factor', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'good', 'acting', 'especially', 'Lucas', 'Russell', 'Dreyfuss', 'money']",N/A

I am an unabashed fanatic of the original movie which made such an impact on me when I saw it at the tender young age of 9. It remains my all time favourite movie, albeit it dated and slightly camp. So when I heard that it was being remade by Wolfgang Peterson I was alternately pleased and apprehensive. Pleased because 30 years later there is so much more one can do with specials effects and CGI and apprehensive because who would fill the roles played so admirably by Shelley Winters, Gene Hackman and especially STELLA STEVENS?.  Fortunately the film makers realised the original cast fit their characters perfectly and that the film is a cult classic so they opted for an entirely new set of characters and a newer modern cruise liner set in the present.That said its quite ironic that in the opening credits it states ""based on the novel by Paul Gallico"" when the only thing it has in common with the original novel and book is 1.tidal/rogue wave 2. cruise liner gets turned upside down...surely ""inspired by"" would have been more apt. Ok onto the film itself; it certainly is a feast for the eyes the pre capsize sequences show a cruise liner of great beauty and outstanding sets. The capsize sequence is visually spectacular and very realistic and the post capsize sequences are definately gripping and well done.But and its a big but..there is absolutely no depth and any character development whatsoever, in fact there is hardly anyone that appeals or even stands out in any way. And this is the movies downfall as you dont really care who lives or dies, unlike in the original where each death is gut wrenching. Its also implausible that in a ship of this size there would only be six survivors. Its cold and heartless and the gruesome deaths of hundreds of people is disturbing.Having said all of the above I still think Poseidon should be viewed and taken on its own merit, spectacular special effects and many stunning sequences which are worth viewing more than once on the DVD.Would have liked to have a commentary and deleted scenes added.",4,Visually spectacular lacking in depth,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2094,"['Ok', 'going', 'be', 'tough', 'one', 'am', 'unabashed', 'fanatic', 'original', 'movie', 'made', 'impact', 'when', 'saw', 'tender', 'young', 'age', '9', 'time', 'favourite', 'movie', 'dated', 'slightly', 'camp', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'being', 'remade', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'was', 'alternately', 'pleased', 'apprehensive', 'Pleased', '30', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'specials', 'effects', 'CGI', 'apprehensive', 'who', 'would', 'fill', 'roles', 'played', 'so', 'admirably', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'especially', 'STELLA', 'STEVENS', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'makers', 'realised', 'original', 'cast', 'fit', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'film', 'cult', 'classic', 'opted', 'entirely', 'new', 'set', 'characters', 'newer', 'modern', 'cruise', 'liner', 'set', 'present.That', 'said', 'quite', 'ironic', 'opening', 'based', 'novel', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'when', 'only', 'thing', 'common', 'original', 'novel', 'book', '1.tidal/rogue', 'wave', '2.', 'cruise', 'liner', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'surely', 'inspired', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'apt', 'film', 'certainly', 'feast', 'eyes', 'pre', 'capsize', 'sequences', 'show', 'cruise', 'liner', 'great', 'beauty', 'outstanding', 'sets', 'capsize', 'sequence', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'very', 'realistic', 'post', 'capsize', 'sequences', 'are', 'definately', 'gripping', 'well', 'done.But', 'big', 'but..there', 'absolutely', 'depth', 'character', 'development', 'whatsoever', 'fact', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'appeals', 'even', 'out', 'way', 'movies', 'downfall', 'dont', 'really', 'care', 'who', 'dies', 'original', 'where', 'death', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'also', 'implausible', 'ship', 'size', 'there', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'six', 'survivors', 'cold', 'heartless', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'hundreds', 'people', 'disturbing.Having', 'said', 'above', 'still', 'think', 'Poseidon', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'taken', 'own', 'merit', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'many', 'stunning', 'sequences', 'are', 'worth', 'viewing', 'more', 'once', 'DVD.Would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'added']",N/A
1006290,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GRUMPU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","When word that Wolfgang Petersen -- director of such fantastic films as DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM -- was slated to direct the remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (now shortened to simply POSEIDON), the sizzling hype around Hollywood was immediately palpable. Production costs for the heavily CGI-laden film skyrocketed to $160 million, making it one of the most costly films of 2005 (released in 2006).Adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring Josh Lucas (GLORY ROAD), Kurt Russell (SKY HIGH), Richard Dreyfuss (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS), Emmy Rossum (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004), Freddy Rodriguez (LADY IN THE WATER), and Kevin Dillon (24 TV Series).Now The Poseidon Adventure (1972) wasn't that great a film to begin with, but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by Karen Carpenter (""It's Got To Be The Morning After"") and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event: the capsizing of a cruise ship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelly Winters, and Jack Albertson rounded out that all-star cast. And although the production was a bit cheesy by today's standards, it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice. This was the focus. The destruction of the ship was just the catalyst, not the focal point. Which is where Wolfgang's remake encounters significant problems.The character set-up in Poseidon is rushed, never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard. More film time is given to the CGI water, fires, explosions, and other non-character items. Many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship, then we're jerked back to the characters who don't really respond to it. So what was the purpose of showing the movie-watcher these things? The simple answer is because it was CGI, it was cool, it cost money, so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses.Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer. Most will probably say, ""So what"" when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive CGI water, fire, or explosion.Hollywood needs to learn that it's the people in the film audiences care about, not the ""totally awesome"" special effects.

It was, however, better than I expected.For those who, like me, haven't seen the original and are flying pretty much blind in considering this film, ""Poseidon"" tells the story of the cruise ship Poseidon.  After meeting a rogue wave, the ship capsizes, killing many passengers and stranding the rest inside the overturned boat.  A small group of passengers, led by Dylan (Josh Lucas) and Robert (Kurt Russell), leave the rest of the survivors and set out on a perilous journey to escape the sinking ship before it's too late.Let me begin by saying that this movie is extremely intense.  The 98 minutes of this film consist of nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation.  If you're looking for a movie that doesn't halt for a whole lot of talking, this is the one to see.I've read many other reviews that complain about the acting, and I couldn't agree less.  I think the acting was pretty darn good.  What can be expected with cast members like Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfuss?The criticism that I will agree with involves the beginning sequence.  The director obviously wanted to ""wow"" viewers with the vastness of the ship and accordingly did a long pan around the entire thing.  Of course, all this was achieved through special effects, and with today's special effects, I would have expected more.  The ship looked fake and even slightly cartoonish.  The later special effects (ie. the ship getting hit by the wave and the ship slowly sinking) are not as disappointing, simply because the plot takes over and doesn't leave you too much time to consider the special effects shortcomings.As an action-adventure film, this movie delivers.  It doesn't deliver too much depth or character-development, but it makes up for these in pure intensity.4-stars - watch it, it's worth your while.",4,Better Than Expected,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1939,"['criticism', 'movie', 'attracted', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'however', 'better', 'expected.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'are', 'flying', 'pretty', 'much', 'blind', 'considering', 'film', 'Poseidon', 'story', 'cruise', 'ship', 'Poseidon', 'meeting', 'rogue', 'wave', 'ship', 'killing', 'many', 'passengers', 'stranding', 'rest', 'overturned', 'boat', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'passengers', 'led', 'Dylan', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Robert', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'leave', 'rest', 'survivors', 'set', 'out', 'perilous', 'journey', 'escape', 'sinking', 'ship', 'too', 'late.Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'movie', 'extremely', 'intense', '98', 'minutes', 'film', 'consist', 'nail-biting', 'situation', 'nail-biting', 'situation', 'nail-biting', 'situation', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', ""n't"", 'halt', 'whole', 'lot', 'talking', 'one', 'see.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'complain', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'less', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'cast', 'members', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'criticism', 'will', 'agree', 'involves', 'beginning', 'sequence', 'director', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'wow', 'viewers', 'vastness', 'ship', 'accordingly', 'did', 'long', 'pan', 'entire', 'thing', 'course', 'was', 'achieved', 'special', 'effects', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'more', 'ship', 'looked', 'fake', 'even', 'slightly', 'cartoonish', 'later', 'special', 'effects', 'ie', 'ship', 'getting', 'hit', 'wave', 'ship', 'slowly', 'sinking', 'are', 'not', 'disappointing', 'simply', 'plot', ""n't"", 'leave', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'consider', 'special', 'effects', 'shortcomings.As', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'character-development', 'up', 'pure', 'intensity.4-stars', 'watch', 'while']",N/A

[Credit mainly] director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot,"" ""In the Line of Fire,"" Air Force One,"" ""Outbreak,"" ""The Perfect Storm,"" AKA a lot of good stuff - of course, he also made ""Troy"").  He shoots both barrels in this escapist blast. After a perfunctory character setup, Petersen hits the action button and never stops whaling on it.  Hollywood made a hit film of Paul Gallico's novel The Poseidon Adventure back in 1972, sparking an era of disaster flicks (Most recently, and most similarly, was Sly Stallone's underrated ""Daylight""). On the technical front, this remake whups the original's ass.  You'll end up entertained if you forgive the clich?s and let Petersen grab you with the visuals, from the avalanche of water in the ballroom to the eerie sight of a flooded crawl space where wires take on the form of deadly tentacles. One of the bigger names in the cast has a drowning scene that really had me going. You don't expect a remake to spring surprises. This one does.""So says Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers (everything in parenthesis are my own little thoughts and additions).  And he is right on the money.  This movie may be plot-light, and yes, it is yet another remake, but movies like this are made to be updated as technology is.  It would be sacrilege for anyone to attempt a remake of say, ""The Godfather"" or ""Gone with the Wind"" just because they can, but ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was not The Godfather.""  I'm sure it has its loyalist fans, but unless they are completely delusional they should be able to admit the movie was pure cheese and pretty much was made, as many movies are today, for a special effects showcase and not much more.  These are really the only kind of movies Hollywood should bother remaking.  You can't really insult the integrity of the original and on a technical level you can do things so much better.  The BIG special effect movies tend to wear me out after being force-fed them all summer long.  Movies can truly do anything nowadays, so effects alone just don't cut it - especially after a whole summer of similar, effect-laden fare.  But ""Poseidon"" has the advantage of being first out of the gate. I am not oversaturated at this point and as a kick off to the summer movie season, this one is just right.  For pure thrills, grandeur and eye-popping visuals, ""Poseidon"" is the go-to movie so far this summer.  Watch your back ""MI:  III.""***By the way, unlike the completely insane John Q.

I was hoping the DVD would have come out with a longer cut that gave us a slower opening.  This version hits so fast that the very first time we are in the captain's booth the wave hits.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[3, 5]","I had been a little skeptical at first the night I decided to go ahead and watch ""Poseidon""...man am I glad I did.Although many claimed it ""sunk"" at the box-office, no pun intended (well...okay, maybe it's a little intended), I thought this film was truly amazing. To be honest, I'm a little shocked it was only rated PG13. According to amazon, it received this rating due to prolonged sequences of disaster and peril. They were not wrong. I'll say this much...get used to seeing *a lot* of dead bodies. Dead bodies everywhere. Floating, impaled, burned, charred, crushed...you name it. I wonder how many extras it took to get that many dead bodies, or do you think they just cycled through the same people?Anyway, a QUICK SYNOPSIS: As hundreds of people gather aboard an enormous luxury cruise liner in celebration of New Years, a HUGE wave (can't stress that enough) catches the revelers off guard and completely capsizes the gigantic vessel, killing a good 3/4 of the people aboard in a matter of minutes. Though the ship is, technically, upside-down, it is still generally floating on the ocean surface...but sinking slowly. There is one large ballroom full of people who mostly survive (for the time being), in addition to a few stragglers from another part of the ship. After assessing the situation, a very sexy man named Dylan (Josh Lucas) decides to take matters into his own hands and find a way off the ship instead of waiting helplessly for rescue. He takes a few people with him, and together they fight their way through the dangers and perils of the capsized ship in a desperate attempt to reach the top...and escape.This film is exciting, suspenseful, and ACTION PACKED. It also doesn't hurt to have Josh Lucas there...who is wet most of the time (woo-hoo for the ladies out there).One good thing is that they don't make you wait too long for the awesome action (and the incredible wave sequence). The film does a good job of introducing you to the main characters, giving you a feel for who they are, what kind of people they are, and the type of relationship they have with one another, in a quick, thorough, and timely manner. They don't mess around with tedious, boring exposition. They work the exposition in when you need it, and let the action flow when you don't.The one critique that I might have to give this film is the lack of proper closure at the end. I don't want to give too much away, but lets just say you are left wanting a *little* more. But thats okay.

1006296,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000GRUMPU,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","It all started with Paul Gallico's novel, ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" which I found fascinating due to the way it presented a fairy tale disguised as a modern survival story. I say this mostly because of character development; each person was assigned a given personality that never faltered and often times created great conflict as they made their way through the bowels of the capsized S.S. Poseidon, a luxurious but aging ocean liner. Despite most being unwilling to band together, they were still drawn to the leadership of an obsessively driven reverend, and in an almost supernatural way, they continued on their journey.Then came Irwin Allen's 1972 film adaptation, something that focused more on the action than on the humanity of the situation. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of this version; I guess I was too bogged down by the original novel and the way it banded a group of one-tracked characters together. It did succeed in providing some good visual material (even though the special effects are cheesy looking by today's standards), and it gave audiences a lot of familiar faces to root for (Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, and Jack Albertson just to name a few). But on the whole it felt flat, emotionless, and shallow.Now we have Wolfgang Petersen's remake, simply entitled ""Poseidon."" Petersen--perfectly capable of handling nautical tragedies (""The Perfect Storm"")--has crafted a much more entertaining adaptation despite the fact that character development is seriously lacking (meaning that it bears little if any resemblance to Gallico's novel, other than the capsized ship). There's really no need to describe the basic plot; anyone who's read the book or seen the original film will know what to expect. And even if they haven't done either, the trailer for this new version pretty much says it all: on New Year's Eve, a freak title wave hits the ship and flips it over, leaving precious little time for a handful of survivors to work their way to the keel and escape.The aspects of the story created just for this version focus only on special effects and character names. Gone are the Reverend Frank Scott, Mike and Linda Rogo, Manny and Belle Rosen, Susan and Robin Shelby, and James Martin. Instead, we have: Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a former navy officer; Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former Mayor of New York; his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), secretly engaged to the love of her life, Christian (Mike Vogel); Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfus), an architect reeling over the breakup with his boyfriend; Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son, Conor (Jimmy Bennett); and Elena Gonzales (Mia Maestro), a stowaway desperate to reach New York and visit her hospitalized brother.In terms of the special effects, I think it's obvious that the model-ship-in-a-tub quality shots of the original film don't hold a candle to the work put into this remake. The destruction scenes are absolutely amazing, and for that we can thank computer generated imagery. The overall design of the Poseidon itself is striking, looking more like a streamlined, modern luxury liner than a cheap imitation of the Queen Mary. It's the kind of look that lends itself better to the moments of action, which are numerous to say the least; certain sections of the ship can't seem to stop flooding, and there are enough explosions to keep thrill junkies on the edge of their seats. It takes the action to a level the original film didn't dare explore by making it fast paced and adrenaline pumping.Of course, I can't forget that because this takes place in the present day, the technology is much more advanced. Is this an improvement? Not necessarily, although it does make the danger they're in more realistic (because, as we all know, technology doesn't always ensure survival). In both the novel and the original film, the characters made the perilous journey with only the hope that they might be rescued. But in reality, they had no way of knowing if they had any chance of survival. In today's world, there are GPS satellite tracking systems and automatic distress signals. In ""Poseidon,"" help is definitely on the way for these people. It's just a matter of time. It's also a matter of who makes it and who doesn't (and you probably already know that not everyone does).In this sense, it's almost symbolic that the characters are forced to encounter death on their journey (just as it's symbolic that the ship is named after the destructive ancient Greek god of the sea). They frequently pass dozens of dead bodies that are strewn throughout the wreckage, signaling a kind of cinematic foreshadowing. This aspect of the story was prominent in the novel but barely alluded to in the original film; in that version, the dead are shown sparingly, making it seem like the characters were traveling through a deserted ghost ship. It wasn't plausible because an ocean liner holds thousands of people during a voyage, not just in passenger friendly areas, but in the lower decks, as well. The remake did a better job of showing that the people are trying to escape from a tomb as well as from a sinking ship.It's interesting that I found ""Poseidon"" so much more enjoyable than ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" considering the humanity of Gallico's story still hasn't been explored. Maybe I went into the remake knowing that his Disaster at Sea fable wouldn't be taken into serious consideration; it's an upgrade of the original film, not the novel. That must have enabled me to turn off my feelings for it and focus only on the new material. Everyone always says an original is better than a remake, but apparently, that isn't always the case. I will say that ""Poseidon"" isn't better than the novel; that was far too unique to be overshadowed by a film adaptation. But as a film and as a remake, it works.Take whatever you will from this upgraded movie. It delivers exactly what it promises in a relatively short period of time, and it definitely isn't boring. I'd recommend it, even to the diehard fans of Irwin Allen's 1972 film. Maybe it's time they get upgraded, as well.",4,Disaster at Sea Gets an Upgrade,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,6136,"['started', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'novel', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'found',

As others have noted, the audience barely gets to know the characters before they are plunged headlong into survival mode by the massive wave that hits the cruise ship. Besides that, the audience is introduced to some circumstances, many of which seem gratuitous. For example, we learn early in the film that the character played by Richard Dreyfuss is gay and is on the cruise to recover from being dumped by his boyfriend. For some reason, the director thought this was important for the audience to know. I can't figure out why, though, since neither this characters' sexuality nor his personal situation had any bearing on anything once the wave hit. Seems like a bit of gratuitous PC characterization to me.  The budding romance between the gambler and the mother is only marginally better.  At least the relationship between the daughter, her boyfriend, and the firefighter (Russel's character) seemed to have a purpose.SPOILER ALERT:  Perhaps the worst part of the movie and the main impetus for my two-star rating was the ending.  After all the near impossible struggles to make it to the bottom of the ship (now the top since it overturned), the survivors jump into the water, and lo and behold, there's an already inflated raft right there for the taking. What luck, huh?  And less than a minute later, a helicopter arrives to save them.  This left me scratching my head in utter confusion at first and then angry at the lazy way the director/producer/writer (or whomever) decided to end the film. After having invested two hours in the movie, I felt cheated by the ending.In short, this movie stinks.",2,A piece of fluff w/ decent special effects,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,1649,"['What', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'audience', 'barely', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'plunged', 'headlong', 'survival', 'mode', 'massive', 'wave', 'cruise', 'ship', 'audience', 'introduced', 'circumstances', 'many', 'seem', 'gratuitous', 'example', 'learn', 'early', 'film', 'character', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'gay', 'cruise', 'recover', 'being', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'reason', 'director', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'audience', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'though', 'characters', 'sexuality', 'personal', 'situation', 'had', 'bearing', 'anything', 'once', 'wave', 'hit', 'Seems', 'bit', 'gratuitous', 'PC', 'characterization', 'budding', 'romance', 'gambler', 'mother', 'only', 'marginally', 'better', 'least', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'firefighter', 'Russel', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'purpose.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'main', 'impetus', 'two-star', 'rating', 'was', 'ending', 'near', 'impossible', 'struggles', 'make', 'bottom', 'ship', 'now', 'top', 'overturned', 'survivors', 'jump', 'water', 'lo', 'behold', 'already', 'inflated', 'raft', 'right', 'there', 'taking', 'What', 'luck', 'huh', 'less', 'minute', 'later', 'helicopter', 'save', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'utter', 'confusion', 'first', 'then', 'angry', 'lazy', 'way', 'director/producer/writer', 'whomever', 'decided', 'end', 'film', 'having', 'invested', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'felt', 'cheated', 'ending.In', 'short', 'movie']",N/A

Yet there's reviews(like critic reviews) that suggests the film was tepid, overproduced and a summer blockbuster masquerading as an important tragic story of survival. It's really one of those kind of films that wants to be more than it is, even though it's got the visuals to convince you so.Passengers on the cruise ship Poseidon are enjoying New Years' until a rogue wave smacks the ship and tips it over, making it float upside down, slowly flooding. The only way to get out is go up, which is in reality down towards the bottom of the ship. In their way stands a ton of water, small spaces and big stunts.One thing that's starting to become better with Hollywood in regards to its effects is the lack of novelty to it. No longer are we going ""holy [...], how'd they do that?!"" like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2. Since we've seen it so many times, as well as the documentaries on it, we know how it's done so it no longer knocks us down but we can follow the story better. The wave scene definately impresses at its coolest but it's not as ""whoa!"" like it would be in the early 90's. Much of the film was done by real sets and stunts by the real actors so it's more impressive.Where the film falls apart is its characterization. One character becomes rogue and wants to be alone until all of a sudden he gets into action hero mode while the mom is so inept at a mom that it's like ""you mean she's still around?"". Then there's one character that's super cute and I'm being biased but once she's gone, the film just kind of felt ""meh"". You can tell the filmmakers wants you to feel bad when someone dies but there's not much buildup to it(except for the cutie).What is also disappointing is the extras for the 2-disc. I've seen single discs with more special features than this. Wolfgang Petersen's quite the info heavy when it comes to commentaries...there isn't one. The film apparently went through a severe edit to make the film seem quicker yet there's no deleted scenes. Expect a triple-dip sometime in the future.If you are a fan of the film, I suggest waiting.

There are some spoilers.Pros:- Kudos to the effects team. I've seen all the other special-effects driven movies this summer (X3, Superman Returns, Pirates 2) and this by far exceeds all three of them. The same goes for the stuntwork, which I've read are sometimes done by the main cast themselves.- Rather than being just the background of the disaster, the ship, due with the opening sequence and some other scenes, is given some character.- It didn't have a love story.Cons:- Like another certain movie released this summer (X3), I feel that the characters are wasted in all the fast-paced action. There wasn't much development at all...-...The stowaway girl had the most potential for this. After what happened to her, I didn't care much for the movie anymore.- Having a (retired??) firefighter along with the team just made it too easy for them. It would've been nice if they somehow had to learn escape/survival skills rather than just dragging along someone who already knew it.- I wish the rumors about Queen Latifah joining the cast were true. It would've made this a bit more interesting.This would've only gotten 1 star from me but the incredible effects and stuntwork saved it from being a total disaster (pun disturbingly intended).

The real star is the ""rogue wave"" (gosh, to repress a smirk hearing that explanation stagger like an inebriated dwarf from the lips of ""Detective Pembleton"" Andre Braugher is truly an arduous task) and the systematic dismantling of the cast. Viewers will be reminded of the various stars' creative missteps; Kurt Russell fans will conjure images of ""Captain Ron"" and ""Breakdown"", not ""Backdraft"" and ""Escape from New York"", while Richard Dreyfuss fans will think about ""The Crew"" and ""Silent Fall"" in lieu of ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". My friends and I literally concocted scorecards for this flick, placing wagers on the characters' one-dimensional lives. Stacey Ferguson, Freddy Rodriguez, and Kevin Dillon earn disaster movie accolades for ascertaining the signatures on their checks were legit and then shrieking/mugging/cussing on cue upon the precipices of their respective demises. Heck, Miss Black Eyed Pea gets to sing a song, heave a sigh, and hug the captain AND THAT'S IT, FOLKS!!! Take the money and run...However, the movie is not bad.

Before the days of computerized visual effects, the big disaster films at times dazzled with what seemed to be impossible visuals and generated guffaws with some very cheesy effects.  Their fans loved all of it because they never took themselves seriously and it was more like a ride at an amusement park than anything like real life.  Even being scared was about having fun.This remake of the original ""Poseidon Adventure"" is much more serious in its intent.  Of course, the computer graphics make the images seem incredibly real and that does draw us in.  We think we feel the heat from the fires, the chill of the water, the panic of being trapped in the vents, our lungs burn for air as we swim underwater with the characters in the movie.We don't get the same characters that were in the first movie.  I won't discuss how the roles map or don't map onto each other, but I will say that in making all this more real, the director and writers made the people less distinguishable from each other.  Sometimes it is hard to tell who it is that is crying or screaming or whatever.Kurt Russell is terrific as Robert Ramsey, former fireman, former mayor of New York.  I think he is a widower, because he has no wife, but I don't remember that being explained amid all the noise.  He is on a cruise with his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and her boyfriend / fianc&eacute;e, Christian (Mike Vogel).  As always, there is tension between the father and daughter and the potential son-in-law (at the beginning of the film, the dad doesn't know how far along their intentions to get married are).Josh Lucas plays the mysterious Dylan Johns.  Since learning about this guys is a very interesting part of the movie, I don't want to discuss the character or what he does.  However, I do want to say that I loved seeing Andre Braugher on screen as Captain Bradford.  He plays the role with just the right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people, especially in an incredible disaster.  Braugher also plays Bradford with enough humanity to endear him to us.The rest of the cast I will leave you to discover.  While they aren't as vividly drawn as they are in the first film, they are more compatible with the apparent desire to make such an impossible system seem more ""real"".While the comments I heard when the movie came out indicated to me that the film wasn't worth seeing, I think it more worthwhile than I had thought.

But as it played out on screen, it was not that at all...It was bad... bad enough to arouse only the popcorn action hungry moviegoer who doesn't mind the knowing what will play out on screen next....the film gets 3 stars just because it has a few unexpected sequences (just a few) and has lots of CGI thrown in... If you truly would like to enjoy this movie, my suggestion is to place all expectations out the door and watch it.

To play these characters, the filmmakers assembled some of my least favorite actors in the world (e.g., Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell).  Fortunately, though, the cast includes the angelic Emmy Rossum, who looks extremely good wet, I must say (especially from certain camera angles).  Josh Lucas is actually quite good in his role, although his sudden transformation from a guy who cares only about saving himself to full-fledged, selfless hero is problematic, and I guess you're supposed to pull for the kid to survive, but none of these characters really matter all that much.  You would think this kind of life-threatening ordeal would endear the characters to us, but that just doesn't happen.  Why develop characters when you can just keep blowing things up?  That seems to be the filmmakers' philosophy here.You already know the story.  A rogue wave comes up and knocks the cruise liner Poseidon all the way over, leaving a small group of characters to defy the captain's ill-advised instructions and head upward to try and find a way out through the bottom of the ship.  They face all kinds of deadly obstacles on their way, from rising water (duh) to live wires to flash fires and explosions, etc.  Some make it, some don't, but it's not like you actually care about any of them.  The only thing resembling a subplot involves Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and Jennifer's young suitor (Mike Vogel), who hasn't really gained the old man's trust as of yet.  Dreyfuss' character is gay for no apparent reason, and we learn next to nothing about the other main characters.  Basically, this film has the kind of script that could easily have been written on a napkin during some writer's lunch meeting with the director.The CGI-laded special effects are pretty good (albeit excessive), but it's just a mistake to build a film around the special effects.  I certainly appreciate the filmmakers going to so much trouble to make the climactic first few minutes of the capsizing surprisingly graphic and as real as possible, but it would have served the film well to devote some of that same passion to the weak script.  As it is, the film - like the ship itself - sinks more and more with each passing minute.",3,"A bland, wholly unnecessary remake of the original classic",1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2534,"['Poseidon', 'Adventure', '1972', 'original', 'classic', 'focused', 'characters', 'trying', 'survive', 'upside-down-ship-sinking', 'disaster', 'incredibly', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'merely', 'characters', 'good', 'excuse', 'put', 'lot', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'together', 'call', 'film', 'play', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'assembled', 'least', 'favorite', 'actors', 'world', 'e.g.', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Fortunately', 'cast', 'angelic', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'who', 'extremely', 'good', 'wet', 'must', 'say', 'especially', 'certain', 'camera', 'angles', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'sudden', 'transformation', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'saving', 'full-fledged', 'selfless', 'hero', 'problematic', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'pull', 'kid', 'survive', 'none', 'characters', 'really', 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'would', 'think', 'kind', 'life-threatening', 'ordeal', 'would', 'endear', 'characters', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Why', 'develop', 'characters', 'when', 'can', 'just', 'keep', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'philosophy', 'here.You', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'rogue', 'wave', 'up', 'knocks', 'cruise', 'liner', 'Poseidon', 'way', 'leaving', 'small', 'group', 'characters', 'defy', 'captain', 'ill-advised', 'instructions', 'head', 'upward', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'bottom', 'ship', 'face', 'kinds', 'deadly', 'obstacles', 'way', 'rising', 'water', 'duh', 'live', 'wires', 'flash', 'fires', 'explosions', 'etc', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'actually', 'care', 'only', 'thing', 'resembling', 'subplot', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Jennifer', 'young', 'suitor', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'gained', 'old', 'man', 'trust', 'yet', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'gay', 'apparent', 'reason', 'learn', 'next', 'nothing', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'Basically', 'film', 'kind', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'napkin', 'writer', 'lunch', 'meeting', 'director.The', 'CGI-laded', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'excessive', 'just', 'mistake', 'build', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'filmmakers', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'make', 'climactic', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'capsizing', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'film', 'well', 'devote', 'same', 'passion', 'weak', 'script', 'film', 'ship', 'sinks', 'more', 'more', 'passing', 'minute']",N/A

Knowing the only reason Warner Bros. would even bother remaking it, this was a sinker (no pun intended). I didn't care who died and who lived. In fact I wanted everyone to die, there being no human connection for me to even see them survive. When they cut back to Fergie and the captain right before the ball room floods, I hadn't seen them (though minor players anyway) in so long, I thought they were dead already. All the characters are brushed over and after fifteen minutes, the wave hits the ship. While Elena (or however you spell her name) does have good motivation to survive, that motivation is revealed to late into the movie so I'm not that phased when she dies. I have a sinking feeling that, while good actors in other films, Kurt Russell (his sacrifice didn't move me at all compared to Gene Hackman's) and Richard Dryefuss only did this one for the paycheck. The one character that wished would die throughout the whole picture was the little boy. He annoyed the crap out of me to the point where ever time he talked, I said ""Shut up kid!"" I know in the original there was a kid, but he was actually useful and was the one who suggested the go to the engine room. The music is dull and listless and we are pained to endure not one, but TWO songs by Fergie. All in all, a very disappointing film which makes the sequel to the original feel like Gone with the Wind.

What I found was a really good thrill ride and its a pity that it hasn't done better at the box office!The director doesn't give us much time to blink before the rogue wave hits the huge cruise ship, killing a great deal of the passengers and turning the ship completely upside down.  The survivors, a small group who decide to try and find a way out of the ship, face one challenge after another.  You might think that the action would let up once the ship has been hit, but you would be wrong.  Wolfgang Peterson quicks the action rolling until the end of the movie.The movie is full of stars---Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfess, to name a few but the best action hero of the bunch is Josh Lucas, who gets the most harrowing sequences in the film.

I saw it with my father at the tender age of six, and vividly recall walking outside the theater to be told that the ground was ""icing up."" That evening became the famous ice storm of 1972 (made even more famous by the movie, ICE STORM), and seeing the original film has assumed a sort of epic quality in my childhood recollections.All that aside, as well as the fact that a ship turning upside down when you're only six is pretty heady stuff, this movie just fell flat for me.  I had hoped that something more than special effects would bring the original up to date.  What I found was a cast of characters that was too sweeping, and that this particular version owed a bit too much to the smash TITANIC.Also, I just love Richard Dreyfus.  Just saw him again in JAWS in the past day or so while watching the DVD.  What's going on with him? He seemed very off to me, but more than that, this remake came off as downright empty.  I'm sorry to say it, too, because with many admirable actors populating the cast (Andre Braugher, Josh Lucas, Dreyfus), I'd thought this would be a powerful film.  Not so.  Apart from the moment when the massive tidal wave turns the cruise ship upside down, it was boring all the way through.Wish I could recommend it, but alas, I just can't.

Sure, the acting could've been better and the intro of the movie could've been longer but the amazing special effects and the fast paced action totally makes up for somewhat lackluster character display. My favourite scene is the capsizing and I'm impressed with how realistic the wave looks. Seeing that CGI-water is very hard to make, the special effects people did a fantastic job in that department! I've seen the original 1972 version too and while that had better characters, this one picks the longest straw when it comes to special effects. The underwater explosions inside the boat are breathtaking and the final groan we hear from the ship as it sinks at the end makes us realize Poseidon's days has been counted. All throughout the movie it feels like we're on the ship being part of the surviving group struggling to make it out of the boat and there really isn't a dull moment in this film. The extra DVD with the bonus materials is pretty interesting too, you learn about the rouge wave phenomenon and they interview sailors who experienced being capsized by rouge waves. There's even a part about a norwegian oil platform that got capsized by a rouge wave in the North Sea and I found that particularly interesting seeing that I'm from Norway myself. I had never heard about that before and had no idea that rouge waves could be found in our very own North Sea. The Behind The Scenes is also fun to watch and the sets they made are nothing short of impressive. I also liked how they used an actual nightclub in Los Angeles for the nightclub scene, they made an exact upside down copy of it and trashed it lol. I always buy DVD's with lots of bonus material on them, most of them are very fun and interesting for a little insight into the making of a movie and this one is no exception.Recommended if you want nonstop action and not a soppy love romance story.

On that end, the movie didn't disappoint.  And once the action begins, it keeps up pretty much non-stop, which was good, because that's really all this movie had going for it.  The special effects with the ship slowly sinking were incredibly well done, and that's what really kept this movie, no pun intended, afloat.The character development was seriously lacking, and it was hard for me to care one way or the other if any of the core cast made it off the ship or not.  In fact, some of the characters I was actually hoping would meet a watery fate just because their whininess and/ or stupidity was just irritating.  Maybe if there'd been more to the characters besides the obvious set up at the beginning, heroic alpha male leaders (Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell), scared stowaway (Mia Maestro), young lovers (Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel), token single mom & child (Jacinda Barrett, Jimmy Bennett), and the token gay architect (Richard Dreyfuss), I could have empathized with their characters more.  Richard Dreyfuss I credit with uttering one of the silliest lines in the film, by the way.  ""I'm an architect, these ships weren't designed to stay afloat upside down.""  That may have held more meaning if he'd said that he was a ship designer or builder, but an architect?  Sorry, but no, the two aren't interchangable.The absolute worst thing about this movie was the predictability.  It became extremely obvious as the movie progressed who would die and when.  For instance, when the Captain gets the brilliant idea to keep all those people there in the dining room, with those nice big glass windows that were underwater, you knew they were all screwed.  When Kevin Dillon's character, Lucky Larry, announces that you have to be lucky to get a name like that, you knew he was minutes away from dying.  And it just kept going, one cliche after another down to the raft that just happens to be floating right there by the ship, and the helicopters that miraculously appear as soon as the first flare is fired.All my complaints aside, it's still an okay movie if you're in the mood for something doesn't require much thought, and features lots of fire, explosions, and one killer wave.",3,This would be a four star rating if...,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,2430,"['movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'predictable.I', 'was', 'fan', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'much', 'remake', 'seriously', 'improved', 'special', 'effects', 'concerning', 'wave', 'striking', 'ship', 'capsizing', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'once', 'action', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-stop', 'was', 'good', 'really', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'special', 'effects', 'ship', 'slowly', 'sinking', 'were', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'really', 'kept', 'movie', 'pun', 'intended', 'afloat.The', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'was', 'hard', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'core', 'cast', 'made', 'off', 'ship', 'not', 'fact', 'characters', 'was', 'actually', 'hoping', 'would', 'meet', 'watery', 'fate', 'just', 'whininess', 'and/', 'stupidity', 'was', 'just', 'irritating', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'characters', 'obvious', 'set', 'up', 'beginning', 'heroic', 'alpha', 'male', 'leaders', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'scared', 'stowaway', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'young', 'lovers', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'token', 'single', 'mom', 'child', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'token', 'gay', 'architect', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'could', 'have', 'empathized', 'characters', 'more', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'credit', 'uttering', 'one', 'silliest', 'lines', 'film', 'way', ""'m"", 'architect', 'ships', 'were', ""n't"", 'designed', 'stay', 'afloat', 'upside', 'down', 'may', 'have', 'held', 'more', 'meaning', ""'d"", 'said', 'was', 'ship', 'designer', 'builder', 'architect', 'Sorry', 'two', 'are', ""n't"", 'interchangable.The', 'absolute', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'predictability', 'became', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'movie', 'progressed', 'who', 'would', 'die', 'when', 'instance', 'when', 'Captain', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'keep', 'people', 'there', 'dining', 'room', 'nice', 'big', 'glass', 'windows', 'were', 'underwater', 'knew', 'were', 'screwed', 'When', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'character', 'Lucky', 'Larry', 'have', 'be', 'lucky', 'get', 'name', 'knew', 'was', 'minutes', 'away', 'dying', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'one', 'cliche', 'down', 'raft', 'just', 'be', 'floating', 'right', 'there', 'ship', 'helicopters', 'miraculously', 'appear', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'flare', 'fired.All', 'complaints', 'aside', 'still', 'okay', 'movie', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'thought', 'lots', 'fire', 'explosions', 'one', 'killer', 'wave']",N/A

If you have a simple, nothing up-to-date, television, but have not seen previous versions, you should enjoy it..although not as much since most of the advanced technology screenwork will not be working for you. If you have the latter set-up and have seen all the previous versions, a  more than  little bit of 'I've seen all this before with characters I could identify with' will probably be your response.Other reviewers have pointed out some of what is missing (aside from an hour of movie): lack of character development, absence of any particularly interesting characters, the absence of anyone with charismatic qualities and the decreasing suspense as one after another impossible barrier is surmounted with little pause between them. I would not knock any of the actors for their performances; they did the best that could be done with the parts as written. Dreyfuss, who can capture audiences, is not given the chance, Russell, less of an actor but more of a personality, is also subdued; the rest I do not know and cannot judge in comparison with their other work.To summarize, this is a good version of an original hit, speeded up and cut down in size, to make it move faster, in the process of which much of the interest in the survival of the characters is diminished. For the general audience, not hardened  by viewings and re-viewings of previous versions,  the picture is worth seeing.  For the other categories, it is hard to predict.

An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, ""Das Boot"" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, ""The Perfect Storm"". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several ""making of"" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs.

It's a decent movie, with very realistic special effects, atmospheric booming sounds of explosions and rushing water, and some impressive directing.  Two things that are bad about Poseidon, are....1. The bland talentless acting.2. And the story. (There isn't any)The movie starts off very quickly and goes straight into the action of the gigantic wave smashing into the titanic sized 'Poseidon', which is very impressive.  After the disaster (that kills nearly everybody) a group of survivors try to escape by making their way through the dangerous maze that is the upside down cruise ship.  And thats it.Characters are poor, with brief introductions it is hard to form a relationship with any of the cast.  Some characters you feel as if you don't care if they die a horrible death.  However, with Richard Dryfuss' and Kurt Russell's characters you do care if they live or die. (Maybe its because they are the only GOOD actors in this entire movie) Some deaths in the movie are very gruesome, but also funny.  With women smashing through glass, guys running around on fire and a dancefloor full of people being electrocuted by dangling power lines.  The music and the excellent audio makes every scene thrilling and exciting.  Other scenes evoke situations of panic towards the viewer.Overall, Poseidon is just an OK movie with minimal flaws.  Not a summer blockbusting hit, but more of a Sunday evening treat.

The game is played thusly: You watch a performer and decide if the performance is something.This film is nothing. It has almost zero character development, very predictable storyline, cheesy dialog, and amazing special effects. When are studios going to learn that until your story is as solid as your special effects you've got nothing?This movie is about a ship sinking and people escaping. That's it. I just summed up the entire movie and all its important plot points in 10 words. That's not a good sign.The problem with this film is, a rogue wave hits Poseidon (that's the name of the ship they are all sailing on) about 15 minutes into the 1 hours and 40 minute movie. That leaves 15 minutes for the character development of no less than 8 characters. The rest all end up dying so there is no use expending energy on their lives is there.The problem with having the disaster come so soon is that there is no time to develop character so when the actors are thrown into their perilous situations you think...Who is this guy again? And why am I supposed to care? The death of a character only takes seconds on screen while it takes a good while to develop an interesting and compelling character. What they should have done, was spend the whole movie developing the 8 main characters and then have them escape over the course of the last 15 minutes. I guarantee that would have made for a much more interesting film.That, incidentally, is one of the things that made ""Alien"" such a great film (especially when compared to so many other monster movies). Ridley Scott spent more of the film building the characters than he did killing them off. I think the monster doesn't even make its first appearance until halfway through the film. Wolfgang Petersen can make a good film, but this is not one of them.

I give it 1 star because I cannot go any lower than that. I read the reviews before watching it, so I was prepared for the worst, but it was even worse than I expected. Let's keep in mind we're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here, not a mere TV-film. The only positive thing I have to say about it, is that it is mercifully short. While watching it on DVD, I barely overcame the urge to fast-forward certain scenes. The plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of Titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver. There is no introduction, no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going, who the people are, what caused the monster-wave, etc. Calling the main characters two- instead of three-dimensional is giving them too much credit. You don't care at all whether they survive or die, the only exception perhaps being the little boy. The CGI effects aren't all that great either. I never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged ocean-liner (a typical and, to me, illogical and extremely irritating Hollywood trademark). The movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas. The water is supposed to be cold and salt, but that doesn't show, even for a second. Although they are just (first-time) passengers, the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well (even though it is turned upside down)and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape. They know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push, even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater. Ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself ? You don't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it. At the end of the movie, the survivors reach daylight and: lo and behold: there's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated life-raft, conveniently located near the bow-thrusters. In typical Hollywood tradition, the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft. Mr Petersen's Poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started.

(The sailing ships are less interesting to me, unless, of course, any of them should happen to have a pirate crew aboard! Errol Flynn still ""rocks""!) Nonetheless, ultimately I guess that I have to go to the 1972 movie, ""The Poseidon Adventure"", or to this 2006 remake, titled simply ""Poseidon"", for some real ship-kicking fun. My experience on ships as a young sailor was with those of Second World War vintage, and these modern vessels, like the Poseidon sort or any such cruise ship now, are mystifying, with all of that advanced technology. Then, atop that, things are mostly upside down, of course, once the ship has capsized completely! Those factors bewilder, as well as the fact that cruise ships have come to look, and to operate for the passengers, more along the lines of floating hotels (with or without casinos) than more recognisably like ""real"" sea-going vessels!Still, it's fun going through the guts of any ship as the actors do in this film, so I was happy that most of the film takes place not in the ballroom and passenger cabins, but deep within the ship, right to the bottom of its overturned hull. For those who like the ""innards"" of ships most of all, this is fun to watch, as, for the same reason, so much of ""Ghost Ship"" was, too.

Probably the temptation of the state of the art CGI effects positioned Peterson into 'recreating' the 1972 thriller, but sadly the result is a heavy mess of special effects with little attention paid to the characters who should be 'driving the boat' into a story.After a scant few poorly written minutes that introduce the passengers and crew who are to provide the emotional interest in the story (Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, Andre Braugher, Kevin Dillon, Jacinda Barrett,  Emmy Rossum,  Mike Vogel, M&iacute;a Maestro, etc - stereotypes all), up comes the 'rogue wave' and the ships turns upside down leaving the remainder of the film focused on how to get out of the trapped bubble.  For about fifteen minutes it works then all becomes redundant and the ending matches the desire of the tired audience - the sinking.Why with so many fine stories to tell and new concepts to explore Hollywood continues to exhume old movies to remake is  a puzzle.  Perhaps that is why the film industry is having tough times these days. A movie for those who love special effects without an interfering story.

But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense.Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says ""Here, this is the only way out.""  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again.When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over.So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.

1006348,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B000GRUMPU,Ian,"[3, 6]","Think you've had a bad day?  Well, you haven't been on board a gigantic ocean liner that's been hit by a rogue tidal wave, capsized, and then is subsequently flooded while the few survivors try desperatly to escape before the big boat plunges to the bottom of the ocean.Poseidon was (along with the as-of-this-writting, unreleased ""Snakes on a plane"") the one big movie that I was looking forward to in 2006.  It had everything going for it.  An incredibly cool trailer, a great concept, state of the art CGI effefts, and a director who has had more then his fair share of water films.  It had everything going for it, and had all the elements of a blockbuster summer action movie.Alas, it was not to be.What went away here?  Perhaps it's the pacing and the timing.  A common complaint for Titanic when it came out way back in 1997 is that it took too long to get to the actual sinking.  Here, we get to the sinking in what feels like ten minutes.  In no time flat the boat has been hit by the wave, is upside down, and the escape attempt beings.  After that it's just bang, bang, bang as the film moves from one scene to another, barely giving you any time to catch your breath.This is probably the films greatest weakness.  It just moves far too quickly.  As an aspiring film editor, i'm aware that all the elements that don't add to the plot or the action at hand need to be cut out, but I just couldn't help but feel that a LOT of good material was cut out to try and keep the movie going as quickly as possible.  And when you cut out such material, your movie may go faster, but it looses  lot in the process, and I think that's what happened with Poseidon.One of my favorite aspects of James Cameron's Titanic is that it took the time to introduce it's charachters, build thier relationships and make us care about them.  By doing so, the movie was more gripping as the ship was sinking because we cared about Jack and Rose as the ship sank (I admit it, I cried when Jack turned into a popsicle).  Here, your charachters are nameless generic people (old guy, mom and kid, rouge anti-hero) who's names you forget five seconds after the credits start rolling.  Although the film does try to do some development, it just doesn't work.  I diddn't care for any of our heros (save for Richard Dreyfus, because it's always cool to see elderly people rise up to escape disaster), and I wasn't really sad when any of them died.  I will say this however, Poseidon does bend the rules a bit when it comes to charachter deaths.  Just like the shark film Deep Blue Sea, you never really know who's going to die.  One death in paticular, is given to a charachter who I thought for sure was going to live, and it suprised me when he/she died.The film isn't helped by the dialogue.  Now, to be fair, it is hard to write dialogue that doesn't sound expositional and i'm sure the scriptwritters tried hard, but the dialoge just sounds...well...artificial.  It's structured in a way that gives us the charachter's background and thier stories while trying to make us care about them.  Sadly, it doesn't work.  There are a few moments where the dialogue is actually silly.  When one of our heros says (in repsponse to the dad heading towards the disco room), ""What?  You got an urge to dance now?""  I couldn't help but raise my hand in the John Travolta disco style, much to the laughter of other people in the theater.  When people in the audience are giggling and laughing at some of what is said on screen in a disaster movie, that can't be a good thing.In a way, Poseidon is just an excuse to go and watch big things happen on screen.  And this is the film's greatest strength.  It's a visual movie.  It's not a charachter driven epic, rather, it's a big action movie that spent the time and money on the visual effects, and it shows.  From the very cool capsizing sequence to the final plunge of the liner, Poseidon does hit the mark when it comes to great visuals.  Unfortunitly, the best moments are scattered throughout the film (such as the capsizing at the beginning and the final sinking at the end).  The rest of the time, we get pretty good visuals, but these just aren't as spectacular as the big stuff.Now, inevitably, comparisons are come up between Poseidon and Titanic, and in a way they are to be expected.  Both films are about sinking ships and the people on board.  The sad thing is, Titanic is just better then Poseidon in almost every way.  It's bigger, it has a more epic feel, and it has charachters we care about.  It takes it's time building up to the big event and keeps the flow going nicely without being too quick or too slow.Sadly, Poseidon has everything backwards.  Poseidon is full of charachters we don't care about, it moves far too quickly and relies more on big visuals over a good story.I really don't like giving this movie a low score because I had high hopes for it, and it is clear that Mr. Peterson and his crew put a lot of effort into making it (the design of the sets and the movie are quite good), but it just moves far too quickly and pretty much ignores charachters in favor of big effects. If you do want to see it, go in expecting a (very) fast paced movie that's big on visuals and don't go in expecting gripping charachters and complex relationships.",2,"A sad case of ""The preview for

It cost Warner $160 million dollars to produce, which means that the film cost $900, 000 for every thirty seconds of footage. Wolfgang Petersen's original cut was 125 minutes before someone, somewhere ordered him to cut it down. Don't get me wrong, it's constantly going and the short running time matches the no-seconds-to-spare realism of a gradually sinking capsized ship. The set pieces the film has to offer are all nail-biting and intense, but I just felt that there wasn't enough of them.I'm not such a big fan of the original. I liked it as a kid but viewing it as an adult I'm turned-off by the soap opera drama and dated effects. Back in the early 70s this may well have been fine but perhaps such advances in movie effects is why remakes of these kind of movies are not so unnecessary. Though I don't really consider this a 'remake' as it is just another version of Paul Gallico's novel.The characters are all likable and even though the set-up and introductions are pretty quick, we get to know enough and grow attached to them before the big wave hits (no longer a tsunami) and what a set-piece that turns out to be! The initial capsizing of the ship is a brilliantly edited destruction derby in which many, many human lives meet violent deaths. If there would be just one thing the film has to offer it is plenty of dead bodies. But why not go one step further and show some really heavy gruesomeness? I would have liked that!The idiots (there are usually loads in disaster films) stay behind in the ballroom while a bunch of more sensible survivors decide to escape by going up (down) to the engine room and out through the propeller tubes. Only because everything is inverted, there are loads of obstacles, including a race-against-time in a very small and very cramped air vent. Not all of them make it!It's a shame that Poseidon didn't do better at the box office but it faced stiff competition in summer 2006. The worldwide grosses maxed out at $181 million, so it only just barely broke even. For some reason Poseidon has had a bad reputation, which is doesn't deserve. The theatrical cut, available here on this Blu Ray, is stripped-down and on the nose. A fleshed-out extended version might win over the doubters.The Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack with plenty of extras.",4,Where is the Director's Cut?,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2419,"['Poseidon', 'surprisingly', 'brisk', '99', 'minutes', '10', 'minutes', 'reserved', 'credits', 'cost', 'Warner', '160', 'million', 'dollars', 'produce', 'film', 'cost', '900', '000', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'footage', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'original', 'cut', 'was', '125', 'minutes', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'ordered', 'cut', 'down', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'constantly', 'going', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'no-seconds-to-spare', 'realism', 'gradually', 'sinking', 'capsized', 'ship', 'set', 'film', 'offer', 'are', 'nail-biting', 'intense', 'just', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'liked', 'kid', 'viewing', 'adult', ""'m"", 'turned-off', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'dated', 'effects', 'Back', 'early', '70s', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'perhaps', 'such', 'advances', 'movie', 'effects', 'why', 'remakes', 'kind', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', ""'remake"", 'just', 'version', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'novel.The', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'even', 'set-up', 'introductions', 'are', 'pretty', 'quick', 'get', 'know', 'enough', 'grow', 'attached', 'big', 'wave', 'hits', 'no', 'longer', 'tsunami', 'what', 'set-piece', 'out', 'be', 'initial', 'capsizing', 'ship', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'destruction', 'derby', 'many', 'many', 'human', 'meet', 'violent', 'deaths', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'offer', 'plenty', 'dead', 'bodies', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'show', 'really', 'heavy', 'gruesomeness', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'idiots', 'are', 'usually', 'loads', 'disaster', 'films', 'stay', 'ballroom', 'bunch', 'more', 'sensible', 'survivors', 'decide', 'escape', 'going', 'up', 'down', 'engine', 'room', 'propeller', 'tubes', 'Only', 'everything', 'inverted', 'are', 'loads', 'obstacles', 'including', 'race-against-time', 'very', 'small', 'very', 'cramped', 'air', 'vent', 'Not', 'make', 'shame', 'Poseidon', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'faced', 'stiff', 'competition', 'summer', '2006', 'worldwide', 'maxed', 'out', '181', 'million', 'only', 'just', 'barely', 'broke', 'even', 'reason', 'Poseidon', 'had', 'bad', 'reputation', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'available', 'here', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'stripped-down', 'nose', 'fleshed-out', 'extended', 'version', 'might', 'win', 'doubters.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'great', '2.35:1', '1080p', 'picture', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'soundtrack', 'plenty', 'extras']",N/A

Both films included an all-star cast.When Warner Brothers Pictures announced their remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", NBC/Hallmark quickly put in to motion their version of the Possidon disaster, titledThe Poseidon Adventure (2005 TV Movie) (Full Screen Edition)(2005-TV), starring Steve Guttenberg.

It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down. Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.Evidently there are things called ""rogue"" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict. This ""rogue"" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon. The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink. What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate. There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well. He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice. He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless. The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.",3,Nobody drops a diamond in this one,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2035,"['Poseidon', 'great', 'ship', 'massive', 'cruise', 'liner', 'amenities', 'disco', 'lounge', 'singer', 'giant', 'ballroom', 'sorts', 'top', 'line', 'bells', 'whistles', 'ritz', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'spit', 'shine', 'Titanic', 'however', 'still', 'going', 'down', 'Naturally', 'tragedy', 'strike', 'ship.Evidently', 'are', 'things', 'called', 'rogue', 'waves', 'gigantic', 'walls', 'water', 'come', 'nowhere', 'are', 'impossible', 'predict', 'rogue', 'wave', 'ship', 'flipping', 'side', 'nearly', 'capsizing', 'Poseidon', 'buildup', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening', 'non-existent', 'portion', 'movie.Eventually', 'ship', 'upside-down', 'cup', 'sink', 'What', 'race', 'climb', 'up', 'bottom', 'boat', 'escape', 'probability', 'watery', 'grave.The', 'acting', 'saving', 'grace', 'downfall', 'movie', 'simply', 'adequate', 'was', 'fairly', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'letting', 'viewer', 'establish', 'character', 'traits', 'action', 'screen.Kurt', 'Russell', 'tough', 'guy', 'concerned', 'father', 'expedition', 'leader', 'fairly', 'well', 'strength', 'confidence', 'displaying', 'highly', 'uncommon', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'least', 'two', 'genuine', 'goose-bump', 'scenes.Josh', 'Lucas', 'confident', 'loner', 'who', 'poker', 'professionally', 'brash', 'risk', 'taker', 'desperate', 'exit', 'willing', 'risk', 'all.The', 'rest', 'escape', 'crew', 'fills', 'cracks', 'admirably', 'providing', 'tension', 'excitement', 'helping', 'hand', 'escape.The', 'added', 'bonuses', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'not', 'star', 'old', 'lady', ""n't"", 'mindlessly', 'chuck', 'priceless', 'diamond', 'ocean', 'end', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'slightly', 'anticlimactic', 'somewhat', 'unreal', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'board', 'ship', 'was', 'incendiary', 'very', 'good', 'thrill', 'ride', 'nonetheless', 'ending', 'what', 'viewer', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'had', 'several', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'stunning', 'CGI', 'enough', 'action', 'enthrall']",N/A

1006365,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000GRUMPU,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 3]","Everyone can recall the earlier ""Poseidon Adventure"", released in the early 1970s and starring Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, etc.  While the earlier version was exciting and thrilling, this new version is just as exciting and thrilling in its own right.  The special effects have improved dramatically over the past 30+ years since the original film was made, and these are the highlight of the new film.As for the story, the plot remains basically the same.  The SS Poseidon is on a New Year's Eve cruise when a gigantic tidal wave strikes the ship, causing it to capsize.  Instead of immediately sinking, the ship has ""turned turtle"", and now the hull is facing upright.  After the ship has turned over, the captain urges the surviving passengers to remain in the ballroom, because he believed an automatic distress signal has been sent and the ship should be able to remain afloat for several hours; long enough for help to arrive.  Tragically, he was wrong.One person not waiting around to be rescued is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional poker player.  He immediately begins to formulate a plan to somehow make his way ""up"" which is really down, into the bowels of the uptuurned vessel to find a way out.  Along the way, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former mayor of New York City, Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett), her young son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) decide to join Dylan and search for a way out.  Robert informs the group that his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiance Christian (Mike Vogel) were in the ship's disco when the wave hit.  The group struggles their way up to the disco to rescue them.  After recovering Jennifer and Christian, the group begins a perilous climb through the bowels of the ship, all the while racing against time.  The watertight compartments have begun to fail and soon the ship is beginning to settle further in the water.Meanwhile, the determined group of survivors has continued to make their way through the ship, swimming through narrow passages and into vent tubes, all the while trying to avoid the onrushing flow of the sea.  Will the group make it to the bow and be able to escape through the propeller tubes, as Dylan has discovered to be a safe way out, or will they all suffer the same fate as the other passengers aboard?This is an exciting and thrilling movie that is topped off with eye-popping special effects and superior acting performances. Some reviewers have commented that the characters were not as developed in this movie as they were in the original film, but I would disagree.  I felt that the strong performances, especially by Kurt Russell (Robert), Josh Lucas (Dylan), and Richard Dreyfuss (Nelson) were one of the high points of the film.  I found myself easily relating to all of the characters, and I was genuinely wondering who would play the part of hero next?  Would it be Robert, who vainly tried to save the life of Elena, or would it be Dylan, who risked his own life several times to save the rest of the group?  On the contrary, I found the character development to be excellent.  The aforementioned special effects, especially the scenes with the wave striking the ship, is what really made this movie stand out from the original.Having viewed both movies, I feel that each deserves a high recommendation.  The original contains many famous actors, and the original storyline was developed, but this great re-make deserves its own place as one of the great ""disaster"" movies.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you're a fan of great special effects and believeable characters, then you won't want to miss this thrilling and exciting movie.",5,A Very Good Re-Make of the Original Classic,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,3757,"['Everyone', 'can', 'recall', 'earlier', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'released', 'early', '1970s', 'starring', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'etc', 'earlier', 'version', 'was', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'new', 'version', 'just', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'own', 'right', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'improved', 'dramatically', 'past', '30+', 'years', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'are', 'highlight', 'new', 'film.As', 'story', 'plot', 'basically', 'same', 'SS', 'Poseidon', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'cruise', 'when', 'gigantic', 'tidal', 'wave', 'ship', 'causing', 'capsize', 'Instead', 'immediately', 'sinking', 'ship', 'turned', 'turtle', 'now', 'hull', 'facing', 'upright', 'ship', 'turned', 'over', 'captain', 'surviving', 'passengers', 'remain', 'ballroom', 'believed', 'automatic', 'distress', 'signal', 'been', 'sent', 'ship', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'remain', 'afloat', 'several', 'hours', 'long', 'enough', 'help', 'arrive', 'Tragically', 'was', 'wrong.One', 'person', 'not', 'waiting', 'be', 'rescued', 'Dylan', 'Johns', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'professional', 'poker', 'player', 'immediately', 'formulate', 'plan', 'somehow', 'make', 'way', 'really', 'down', 'bowels', 'uptuurned', 'vessel', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'way', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'retired', 'firefighter', 'former', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Maggie', 'James', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'young', 'son', 'Conor', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'stowaway', 'Elena', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'Richard', 'Nelson', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'decide', 'join', 'Dylan', 'search', 'way', 'out', 'Robert', 'group', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'fiance', 'Christian', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'were', 'ship', 'disco', 'when', 'wave', 'hit', 'group', 'way', 'disco', 'rescue', 'recovering', 'Jennifer', 'Christian', 'group', 'perilous', 'climb', 'bowels', 'ship', 'while', 'racing', 'time', 'watertight', 'compartments', 'have', 'begun', 'fail', 'soon', 'ship', 'beginning', 'settle', 'further', 'water.Meanwhile', 'determined', 'group', 'survivors', 'continued', 'make', 'way', 'ship', 'swimming', 'narrow', 'passages', 'vent', 'tubes', 'while', 'trying', 'avoid', 'onrushing', 'flow', 'sea', 'Will', 'group', 'make', 'bow', 'be', 'able', 'escape', 'propeller', 'tubes', 'Dylan', 'discovered', 'be', 'safe', 'way', 'will', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'other', 'passengers', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'topped', 'off', 'eye-popping', 'special', 'effects', 'superior', 'acting', 'performances', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'developed', 'movie', 'were', 'original', 'film', 'would', 'disagree', 'felt', 'strong', 'performances', 'especially', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Robert', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Dylan', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Nelson', 'were', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'found', 'easily', 'relating', 'characters', 'was', 'genuinely', 'wondering', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'part', 'hero', 'Would', 'be', 'Robert', 'who', 'vainly', 'tried', 'save', 'life', 'Elena', 'would', 'be', 'Dylan', 'who', 'risked', 'own', 'life', 'several', 'times', 'save', 'rest', 'group', 'contrary', 'found', 'character', 'development', 'be', 'excellent', 'aforementioned', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'scenes', 'wave', 'striking', 'ship', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'original.Having', 'viewed', 'movies', 'feel', 'high', 'recommendation', 'original', 'contains', 'many', 'famous', 'actors', 'original', 'storyline', 'was', 'developed', 'great', 're-make', 'own', 'place', 'one', 'great', 'disaster', 'movies', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', ""'re"", 'fan', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'believeable', 'characters', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'movie']",N/A
1006366,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000GRUMPU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","The movie itself is pretty much an empty vessel, though it is certainly a product of its time. Trivial concerns such as story and character are jettisoned in favor of elaborate and expensive sets and CGI special effects. Like so many CGI blockbusters, human interaction is merely a bothersome detail; the real focus being on the violent extermination of masses of nameless, faceless victims. And once again, Hollywood has mistaken technological gimmickry for storytelling skill. When the film does try to escape from tired predictability it bites off for more than it can chew.The capsizing sequence was stunning, but so many areas of the ship were highlighted in such a short time that I never really felt I was part of the action. We witness the galley bursting into flames and everybody being burnt to a crispy critter. Elevators come crashing down, people are falling and dying all over the place, dead bodies float all throughout the ship and outside the ship, and it's one big mess. There was no Christmas tree!?! The Christmas tree played a pivotal role in the original film ... from passengers falling into it during the capsizing ... to it unexpectedly crashing down ... to the survivors climbing it (and Mrs. Rosen getting stuck in the spokes) ... to it falling back into the flooding Dining Room when panic ensues! Why leave it out entirely when there are so many cinematic possibilities? Instead the characters in the new film ""sneak out"" of the Ballroom using some stacked chairs. There is absolutely no plea for others to join them even though they know that anyone left behind may die. I suppose it says something about today's society ... ""I'm getting out of here -- to hell with everyone else!"" But these guys are supposed to be the heroes in the film? The film has no sense of humanity, let alone a sense of humor about the absurdity of the entire premise.I suppose that the filmmakers wanted this to be like the remake of KING KONG, an eye-popping, special effects reinvention of a well-worn story. But, instead, POSEIDON ends up being like the woefully unnecessary remake of PSYCHO: there was no need, demand or purpose for this film to exist and the filmmakers reveal they have no apparent clue as to why the original is loved in the first place.

1006375,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000GRUMPU,Jonathan Appleseed,"[1, 6]","This film suffers in comparison to others, namely the ""original"", andTitanic. One wonders at the wisdom of greenlighting this project and approving a budget of $160 million. That question becomes more relevant during the opening credits. Not to disrespect either actor, but Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss are past their A-list days.Not only does POSEIDON suffer in comparison to other films, it suffers from filmmakers more concerned with a visual product than any other components. For main characters, we're given a group that you could pluck down in just about any thriller and watch them run with little or no guidance: in other words, they're stock characters. We've seen them hundreds of times: the former fire-fighter turned Mayor turned wealthy gambler, the former navy guy who can navigate his way through a ship that's turned upside down with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, the gay man with a can't-miss-it-sized earring in his right ear who's there just to be gay, a single mother with a young cute son who makes endearing comments and looks just so, the mayor's daughter who is nervous around him for no apparent reason, and the guy who wants the mayor's daughter to marry him who calls him sir. Nothing new here.What was surprising, however, was that the filmmakers approached POSEIDON with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Everyone's life was up for grabs, and I mean everyone's.

Without having done that, this film would have been a waste.But a film can't build a reputation by having great special effects and killing people indiscriminately.

1006376,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000GRUMPU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","Remaking movies is a big thing in Hollywood right now, it seems like every time I turn around there's another classic movie or TV show that is being remade.  Sometimes these remakes prove to be inferior to their source material (""Psycho"" and ""The Omen"" to name a couple), but in some instances they become equals to the originals, or even better than the original.  A very recent addition to the ever-increasing list of remakes would be director Wolfgang Peterson's (""Air Force One"" and ""Troy"") attempt at remaking the classic disaster-type film ""Poseidon Adventure"" with ""Poseidon"" starring Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Richard Dreyfuss.""Poseidon"" takes place during New Year's Eve on the cruise ship Poseidon (hmm, I wonder where they got the title of the movie from).  While the many passengers on the ship are partying the night away to welcome in the New Year, disaster is quickly approaching.  A giant wave, apparently called a rogue wave, strikes the ship, causing it to flip over and many passengers to die in the disastrous process.  With time running out, and the ship slowly becoming a watery grave for all aboard, a small group of passengers struggle to make their way to the bottom of the ship (which is now the top for those not paying attention), and hope to survive.Remaking a movie would seem to be somewhat difficult to me, because you have to try to present a story that has already been done before in a similar manner, while giving the audience something new and engaging to witness.  Some directors have been less original with their remakes, opting to merely copy the source movie scene for scene and word for word, merely updating the surroundings a little bit, of course I don't feel these movies do as well, but that's just me.  Now, I never saw the original ""Poseidon Adventure"", so I can't say how much of a copy this version is, but even if this remake is merely a scene for scene recreation of the original, I believe it is one of the rare successes that had been achieved this way.The success of ""Poseidon"" is achieved in part because of the terrific special and practical effects that were employed to make the scenes of the ship being struck by the wave into reality, and for all the disastrous side effects that followed throughout the flipped over ship.  The other part of this movie's success is due to the excellent group of actors that were assembled to fight to survive the sinking cruise ship.  All of the actors did an excellent job with fleshing out these characters over the course of the movie, because there wasn't much time given in the beginning for exposition or development.  I personally felt that the lack of character development prior to the wave striking (which occurs approximately 25 minutes into the movie, providing enough time to basically introduce the characters) was somewhat strange, because you didn't know who to root for, other than by going off whether or not you knew the actor from previous movies and if you liked them or not.  However, once the struggle for survival arc of the movie kicked in, the actors were given more to work with and developed their characters through their interaction with each other allowing them to become more accessible to the audience.The decision to focus the movie on the disaster side of the story early on was an odd choice, but one that worked to the film's advantage, by allowing things to get moving quickly and not allow for a lull in the momentum.  Featuring a rather short running time for a disaster movie, at just 98 minutes, a fact that may seem odd for a Wolfgang Peterson film (his movies generally last 2 hours or more), in this instance the shorter running time made for a much tighter feeling movie which served the story well.

I was lucky to have seen it on the IMAX screen, and for $15 per ticket I must say that it was worth it!The movie starts out with gorgeous sweeping angels with the most majestic music that berated into the wide open surface of the ocean around the cruise ship. It starts off fast and there is no sitting around and waiting for something to happen. About ten minutes into the movie I was actually pissed at myself for almost missing it and the scenes in front of my eyes went from wild to insane.This movie is extremely graphic to say the least. Except for some really dark war movies I have never seen people die and get hurt in so many ways to the point where the realistic portrayal knocked the wind out of my lungs. I felt as if I was there, tumbling with the ship hit by a rough wave exactly on midnight on new years ever. Watching the ship go from wild turning to being turned upside down, having the fuel leak and explode, the rooms fill with ocean water, people flying and dying right and left looked like some crazy National Geographic disaster special. I couldn't believe how hard the struggle for a small group of passengers was as they were going back to the bottom of the boat, now facing up, trying with all they had for a chance to jump into the bottomless black ocean.This reminded me of the Titanic, and the characters were fresh and modern, they struggled and sacrificed honor and lives, and they took us with them thorough the intestines of the ship. Kurt Russell has always been one of my favorites and his determination and strength were quite powerful in this movie as he and a group or random people reached to the ends of their sanity and physical strength to move forward. Pinocchio sure made escaping out of a whale look a lot easier then escape from the Poseidon was.Overall I loved this movie yet it was terrifying because it threw human mortality and fragility right in front of the viewer. I do not think I could have survived going through what these people went through and that was sad and scary. Really good movie, bit sad, bit heart warming and definitely very intense.And on the end note the music in the movie was staggering and breathtaking; it gave this movie such layers of depth that I got goose bumps from the first minute upon hearing it.",5,"Violent, strong and quite extraordinary",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,2442,"['Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'Poseidon', 'insanely', 'negative', 'reviews', 'got', 'went', 'only', 'boyfriend', 'begged', 'see', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'seen', 'IMAX', 'screen', '15', 'ticket', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'movie', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'sweeping', 'angels', 'most', 'majestic', 'music', 'berated', 'wide', 'open', 'surface', 'ocean', 'cruise', 'ship', 'fast', 'sitting', 'around', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'pissed', 'almost', 'missing', 'scenes', 'front', 'eyes', 'went', 'wild', 'insane.This', 'movie', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'say', 'least', 'really', 'dark', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'people', 'die', 'get', 'hurt', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'point', 'where', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'knocked', 'wind', 'lungs', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'tumbling', 'ship', 'hit', 'rough', 'wave', 'exactly', 'midnight', 'new', 'years', 'ever', 'Watching', 'ship', 'go', 'wild', 'turning', 'being', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'having', 'fuel', 'leak', 'explode', 'rooms', 'fill', 'ocean', 'water', 'people', 'flying', 'dying', 'right', 'left', 'looked', 'crazy', 'National', 'Geographic', 'disaster', 'special', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'hard', 'struggle', 'small', 'group', 'passengers', 'was', 'were', 'going', 'back', 'bottom', 'boat', 'now', 'facing', 'up', 'trying', 'had', 'chance', 'jump', 'bottomless', 'black', 'ocean.This', 'reminded', 'Titanic', 'characters', 'were', 'fresh', 'modern', 'struggled', 'sacrificed', 'honor', 'lives', 'took', 'intestines', 'ship', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'determination', 'strength', 'were', 'quite', 'powerful', 'movie', 'group', 'random', 'people', 'reached', 'ends', 'sanity', 'physical', 'strength', 'move', 'forward', 'Pinocchio', 'sure', 'made', 'escaping', 'whale', 'look', 'lot', 'easier', 'then', 'escape', 'Poseidon', 'was.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'yet', 'was', 'terrifying', 'threw', 'human', 'mortality', 'fragility', 'right', 'front', 'viewer', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'going', 'what', 'people', 'went', 'was', 'sad', 'scary', 'Really', 'good', 'movie', 'bit', 'sad', 'bit', 'heart', 'warming', 'definitely', 'very', 'intense.And', 'end', 'note', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'staggering', 'breathtaking', 'gave', 'movie', 'such', 'layers', 'depth', 'got', 'goose', 'bumps', 'first', 'minute', 'hearing']",N/A
1006379,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000GRUMPU,Kaya Savas,"[2, 2]","MOVIE: Wolfgang Petersen has been a pretty consistent director when it comes to big bombastic CGI driven movies. He has never really made an excellent film, but he has done good work.  The Perfect Storm was a good story and handled very well, while Air Force One was an intense thriller that had all the right ingrediants to work so well. Troy was considered by many to be a bad movie, but I found it to have a great vision on Petersen's part that resulted in a very enjoyable blockbuster. Now Wolfgang Petersen hits the screen with his next blockbuster wannabe, Poseidon. A remake of the 1972 The Poseidon Adventure. Nothing new to report here, but remakes never capture the essence of the originals, it just seems like a fact that Hollywood doesn't care about. The film tells the disasterous tale of a cruise ship that gets hit by a rogue wave in the middle of the ocean, and that's about it. The film is a short 1 hour, 48 minutes. Short in terms of movies in the same genre. The script is contrived and full of cardboard characters and wooden dialogue. It's nothing but one clich? after another and just makes excuses to show more amazing CGI and ""been there, done that"" escape sequences. Sure the movie has incredible CGI and some amazing set design, but at what cost? My rule of thumb is that you cannot sacrifice story for action, which is just what this movie did. The dialogue and the characters were merely lead-ins to the next action sequence. No character development was done, which basically says ""okay, don't care about the characters, just watch this ship rollover."" Mark Protosevich was the film's screenwriter, and this is only his second screenplay, which shows his lack of experience and really his screenplay is the thorn in this movie's side. Petersen does a great job at directing the action, William Sandell's (Master & Commander) production design is spectacular, and Klaus Badelt's score is intense and in your face. However it is the script, the backbone of a film, that is lacking and thus creates a very lackluster experience.ACTING: When you hear a cast listing like this movie has, you have certain expectations. There is some great talent in the film, but what can you say about the acting if the script is horrible. Some of the lines that are delivered are laughably bad. In one scene Josh Lucas tells Kurt Russell who is a former firefighter, ""I work better on my own . . . no offense"". In which Russell replies, ""None taken"". You can't get much better than that.BOTTOM LINE: Is it clich?d? Yes. Has it been done before? Many times. Do we care about the characters? No. However, you can't help but feel a little entertained by the overwritten score by Klaus Badelt and the bombastic CGI scenes as the ship turns belly up. It'll be a good DVD to give your home theater a workout.",3,"A Weak & Shallow Script (No Pun Intended) Is To Blame, But You Can't Help But Be A Little Entertained",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2812,"['MOVIE', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'been', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'director', 'when', 'big', 'bombastic', 'CGI', 'driven', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'excellent', 'film', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'was', 'intense', 'thriller', 'had', 'right', 'ingrediants', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Troy', 'was', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'bad', 'movie', 'found', 'have', 'great', 'vision', 'Petersen', 'part', 'resulted', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'blockbuster', 'Now', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'screen', 'next', 'blockbuster', 'wannabe', 'Poseidon', 'A', 'remake', '1972', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Nothing', 'new', 'report', 'here', 'never', 'capture', 'essence', 'originals', 'just', 'fact', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'film', 'disasterous', 'tale', 'cruise', 'ship', 'hit', 'rogue', 'wave', 'middle', 'ocean', 'film', 'short', '1', 'hour', '48', 'minutes', 'Short', 'terms', 'movies', 'same', 'genre', 'script', 'contrived', 'full', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'one', 'clich', 'just', 'excuses', 'show', 'more', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'escape', 'sequences', 'Sure', 'movie', 'incredible', 'CGI', 'amazing', 'set', 'design', 'what', 'cost', 'rule', 'thumb', 'can', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'action', 'just', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'were', 'merely', 'lead-ins', 'next', 'action', 'sequence', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'done', 'basically', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'just', 'watch', 'ship', 'rollover', 'Mark', 'Protosevich', 'was', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'only', 'second', 'screenplay', 'lack', 'experience', 'really', 'screenplay', 'thorn', 'movie', 'side', 'Petersen', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'action', 'William', 'Sandell', 'Master', 'Commander', 'production', 'design', 'spectacular', 'Klaus', 'Badelt', 'score', 'intense', 'face', 'However', 'script', 'backbone', 'film', 'lacking', 'thus', 'very', 'lackluster', 'experience.ACTING', 'When', 'hear', 'cast', 'listing', 'movie', 'have', 'certain', 'expectations', 'great', 'talent', 'film', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'acting', 'script', 'horrible', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'are', 'laughably', 'bad', 'one', 'scene', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'who', 'former', 'firefighter', 'work', 'better', 'own', 'offense', 'Russell', 'replies', 'None', 'taken', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'that.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'clich', 'd', 'Yes', 'been', 'done', 'Many', 'times', 'Do', 'care', 'characters', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'entertained', 'overwritten', 'score', 'Klaus', 'Badelt', 'bombastic', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'ship', 'belly', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'DVD', 'give', 'home', 'theater', 'workout']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","Proving that God can crank out a sheet of water that's way more powerful than any man-made ship, ""Poseidon"" gives her viewers a brief look into high society, then wipes it all off of the table with a wave that'd make any surfer wig out.  A few survivors are left to make it to the hull of the ship and eventual safety, but this film has plenty of dangers lying ahead for them all.I'm sure there are plenty of comparisons to ""Titanic"" and the original ""Poseidon Adventure,"" but this remake holds its own against many other modern adventure flicks.  Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot,"" ""The Perfect Storm""), strips away character development and relies on CGI and live-action sequences to move this ship along.  It's an above-average study in modern, bloated action yarns that cuts to the chase and ties all of the loose ends nicely in just under an hour and forty minutes.The visuals are rather stunning for the most part, and show just how far CGI has come since James Cameron's ""Titanic"" first set sail.  The bulk of the scenes were shot on blue screen sets, but you can hardly tell while you're watching the flick.  Also, the main actors in this film did almost all of their own stunts.  Kudos to Josh Lucas for swimming under a lake of fire.  That was pretty impressive.Speaking of acting, Lucas headlines a cast of faces both new and familiar.  Most of the characters are cardboard stereotypes, but the whole point of this flick is the visual appeal of it all.  Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss (both of the original ""Poseidon Adventure"") do wonderful jobs in their respective roles.  Russell's the over-protective father of his daughter (Emmy Rossum of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"") and Dreyfuss plays a jilted lover who's on the boat to drown his sorrows in wine, lots of wine.  Jacinda Barrett plays a single mother who's son (Jimmy Bennett) is tagging along on her journey.  There's a also a stowaway (Mia Maestro) and a future son-in-law (Mike Vogel).  Andre Braugher has a brief but solid role as the captain, and Stacy Ferguson (Fergie of the Black-Eyed Peas) plays the ship's local siren.

But first, we meet the unsuspecting partygoers:  Father (Kurt Russell) and daughter (Emmy Rossum), handsome and conceited gambler (Josh Lucas), single mom and her small son, and rich but depressed businessman (Richard Dreyfuss).  The surprise wave turns the ship over, there are countless causalities, but who will survive the climb to the top, er, bottom?Comparisons with the Irwin Allen original are natural, but they really are very different movies.  The 1972 version was character-driven.  We knew a lot about the personalities and histories of the main cast and cared about them.  There was a lot of inter-personal drama that was quite enjoyable and special effects were limited to the upside-down roll of the ship.  The new ""Poseidon"" is all about the CGI effects, and they are truly outstanding.  The flipping of the ship is much more violent and realistic this time around, and it's just the start of the action.  And there are enough underwater scenes to have you holding your own breath as you are caught up in the excitement.  We know almost nothing about the characters, but that didn't bother me as the star of the show is the explosive action.The director maintains a high level of tension throughout the film; the danger never lets up, and the pace is quick.  We know some of the cast won't survive, but we don't know who, and that keeps us involved.

1006390,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000GRUMPU,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[2, 3]","This remake from 2006 stars Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss. You've got an elegant cruise liner, a diverse cast of characters, and suddenly a rogue wave tips the whole thing over. Most of the survivors huddle in the main dining room - but a small group of passengers decide to make it out on their own.It's hard to judge this film just as a ""stand alone disaster flick"" since the 1972 version was so spectacular. It's sort of like if you really loved the Titanic with Leonardo - and then watched an action-adventure movie made now, that was half as long and truncated the characters. It would be really hard not to compare the two. So there are probably two types of watchers for this movie. One will be the people who saw the 1972 version and who are probably disappointed with this one as a result. On the other hand, people who watch this movie without any expectations, and just want a ""wild ride for 1 1/2 hours"" will find the special effects quite thrilling.Part of what this story is about is how a wide variety of characters - young boy, just-engaged couple, stowaway, older homosexual, etc. - manage to get over their issues and bond and get through troubles. Again if you're just looking for a ""wild ride"" won't care that these people are very stereotypical and cardboard cutout types. If you're actually a fan of drama movies where the characters grow and learn and reach into their inner strengths, you'll find this a poor version of that earlier film.On the other hand, part of any disaster movie is the excitement and reality of the disaster. A lava disaster movie seems hokey when they are running from ""red water"". When the lava is roiling, the heat waves are filling the screen and the smoke is thick, suddenly you can feel the panic and the danger. That is why we watch disaster movies - to watch people face dangers, and their fears, and hopefully rise above them. It gives us hope and encouragement that we might do the same.So while the 1972 version of Poseidon had some rather silly scenes of water and flood, this 2006 version does a GREAT job with many of the scenes. The way the water bursts through the windows, the way the ship is affected as it tilts upside down, it all feels very real. After the footage and experience of the Tsunami, it definitely feels real and scary to have a gigantic wave of water coming at you with nowhere to run to. You can also understand the panic of being in a submerged vessel that is sinking.There are numerous plot holes and factual errors, that if you're even half paying attention, make you lose your suspension of disbelief. I suppose it's that way with many disaster films - you have to just accept that they did things A and B even though doing C makes MUCH more sense to any sane person. Also, you would have thought that people working on a high budget film involving a ship would have made sure that all their basic research about how a ship works, how the ballast works, how the propeller works, etc. was correct.Still, in the end, you probably watch this film because it's a fun way to pass an hour and a half with your popcorn and soda. So in that sense, the movie suits that purpose, and is well worth a watch.",4,"More Adventure, Less Drama than 1972 Version",1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,3185,"['remake', '2006', 'stars', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', ""'ve"", 'got', 'elegant', 'cruise', 'liner', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'rogue', 'wave', 'whole', 'thing', 'Most', 'survivors', 'huddle', 'main', 'dining', 'room', 'small', 'group', 'passengers', 'decide', 'make', 'out', 'own.It', 'hard', 'judge', 'film', 'just', 'stand', 'alone', 'disaster', 'flick', '1972', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'spectacular', 'sort', 'really', 'loved', 'Titanic', 'Leonardo', 'then', 'watched', 'action-adventure', 'movie', 'made', 'now', 'was', 'half', 'long', 'truncated', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'types', 'watchers', 'movie', 'One', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'saw', '1972', 'version', 'who', 'are', 'probably', 'disappointed', 'one', 'result', 'other', 'hand', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'expectations', 'just', 'want', 'wild', 'ride', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'will', 'find', 'special', 'effects', 'quite', 'thrilling.Part', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'how', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'young', 'boy', 'just-engaged', 'couple', 'stowaway', 'older', 'homosexual', 'etc', 'manage', 'get', 'issues', 'bond', 'get', 'troubles', 'Again', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'wild', 'ride', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'types', ""'re"", 'actually', 'fan', 'drama', 'movies', 'where', 'characters', 'grow', 'learn', 'reach', 'inner', 'strengths', ""'ll"", 'find', 'poor', 'version', 'earlier', 'film.On', 'other', 'hand', 'part', 'disaster', 'movie', 'excitement', 'reality', 'disaster', 'lava', 'disaster', 'movie', 'hokey', 'when', 'are', 'running', 'red', 'water', 'When', 'lava', 'roiling', 'heat', 'waves', 'are', 'filling', 'screen', 'smoke', 'thick', 'suddenly', 'can', 'feel', 'panic', 'danger', 'why', 'watch', 'disaster', 'movies', 'watch', 'people', 'face', 'dangers', 'fears', 'hopefully', 'rise', 'hope', 'encouragement', 'might', 'do', 'same.So', '1972', 'version', 'Poseidon', 'had', 'rather', 'silly', 'scenes', 'water', 'flood', '2006', 'version', 'GREAT', 'job', 'many', 'scenes', 'way', 'water', 'windows', 'way', 'ship', 'affected', 'upside', 'down', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'footage', 'experience', 'Tsunami', 'definitely', 'feels', 'real', 'scary', 'have', 'gigantic', 'wave', 'water', 'coming', 'nowhere', 'run', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'panic', 'being', 'submerged', 'vessel', 'are', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes', 'factual', 'errors', ""'re"", 'even', 'half', 'paying', 'attention', 'make', 'lose', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'suppose', 'way', 'many', 'disaster', 'films', 'have', 'just', 'accept', 'did', 'things', 'A', 'B', 'even', 'doing', 'C', 'MUCH', 'more', 'sense', 'sane', 'person', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'people', 'working', 'high', 'budget', 'film', 'involving', 'ship', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sure', 'basic', 'research', 'how', 'ship', 'how', 'ballast', 'how', 'propeller', 'etc', 'was', 'correct.Still', 'end', 'probably', 'watch', 'film', 'fun', 'way', 'pass', 'hour', 'half', 'popcorn', 'soda', 'So', 'sense', 'movie', 'suits', 'purpose', 'well', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A

The characters represented in this film are more a cross-section of our typical modern-day thoughts of self-promotion and survival as opposed to Gene Hackman's character motivating and imploring all to join him to get to safety in the original.I don't discount that there were well-crafted scenes in this film, but it was effects-heavy and didn't have any heart.",3,Poo-seidon,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,1188,"['Well', 'considering', 'rumored', 'amount', 'money', 'went', 'production', 'film', 'expected', 'something', 'really', 'engaging', 'lackluster', 'many', 'respects', 'especially', 'often', 'quoted', 'less-than-stellar', 'character', 'development', 'lead', 'given', 'one', 'two', 'lines', 'throw-away', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'movie', 'encapsulate', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'BAM', 'rogue', 'wave', 'guess', 'many', 'movie-goers', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'anyway', 'producing', 'team', 'figured', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'action', 'quickly.That', 'aside', 'was', 'disturbed', 'what', 'seemed', 'lack', 'compassion', 'characters', 'seemed', 'man', 'was', 'Religion', 'played', 'prominently', 'original', 'film', 'Here', 'reduced', 'young', 'girl', 'relationship', 'crucifix', 'neck', 'characters', 'represented', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'cross-section', 'typical', 'modern-day', 'thoughts', 'self-promotion', 'survival', 'opposed', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'character', 'motivating', 'imploring', 'join', 'get', 'safety', 'original.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'discount', 'were', 'well-crafted', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'effects-heavy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart']",N/A

1006399,A22R1X2P28BFCV,B000GRUMPU,Mark K. Rempel,"[0, 0]","This remake of the 1972 film includes a 22 minute documentary on how it was made, why it was made, and interviews with cast and crew. The documentary tries to convince the viewer that it is the greatest extravaganza ever made, but I note that Leonard gave it 2 stars and a who cares attitude. He was not impressed. But in fact much of the film is impressive, however, the characters are thin with no background on them or not enough to access their motives. Too little set up time before rogue wave hits ship. I prefer films where the director spends time forming the personalities of the characters before the action begins. Also disappointing is that the ship is all CGI, no real ship was used. Yet the ship looks very much like those used by Disney Cruises--on purpose? Some characters are too one dimensional. The drunk jerk who dies early (spectacularly), the pious stowaway who dies near the end, the heroic ex-fireman who saves them all at the last minute, then drowns all by himself. The character played by Josh Lucas is a cypher. Who is he? What kind of ex-Navy? He seems to act as if he wanted to forget his Navy career. Did he find his career an embarrassment? The director should have given him a back story. I believe the broad scenario is impossible, in spite of what was said in the documentary that comes with the DVD. A ship would not capsize so easily and flip over so quickly, especially it would not right itself again just as the heroes escape and then go down. Much of the film is difficult to believe. Exciting but also absurd. The stuff of fiction. The film would be amusing for sadists who enjoy schadenfreude entertainment, that is seeing others suffer in odd circumstances. disappointing no real ship was used. All sets or CGI. The film was exciting while actually watching it, but afterwards I realized it was too impossible to accept.

I must admit, I have never actually seen the first ""Poseidon adventure,"" but from those that I have talked to that have, this is a very different movie.The movie is about a ill-fated ship called Poseidon. The ship is hit by a rogue wave and sinks, UPSIDE DOWN! That's the part of the story that we all know. The characers, special effects, and heart pounding suspense are what makes the movie a home run!The movie focuses on about 9 characters, which makes it very different from James Cameron's Titanic. Instead of getting emotionally invested in just one couple, the movie goer has to split their attachment amung these characters. It is inevitiable that you will pick a favorite two or three that you want to make it.Regarding the nine characters, there's not a lot of background given, but there is just enough that you care about the people.  Josh Lucas plays Dylan Johns who is a professional gambler, Kurt Russell who plays Robert Ramsey, a former mayer of NYC and a former figher captain. They are the main stars of the film. Also aboard the doomed ship are his Daughter who is played by Emmy Rossum and her fiance' played by Mike Vogel. Jacinda Barrett plays a single mother who is aboard with her 10 year old son. Two more charcters worth mentioning are played by Mia Maestro (a stoaway who is traveling to NYC to see her sick brother), and Richard Dryfuss who plays a man who has been dumped by his lover and in his mind has little reason to live.These characters all band together to try to escape from the sinking Poseidon against the wishes of the captain. What follows is absolute heart pounding suspsense!!! The movie is not very long, but for about a hour out of the hour and a half I was a nervous and emotional wreck. It is nearly impossible to predict who lives and who dies and I liked that!!! Every element of a good suspense film was here, however, I must say that the dramatic elements of this film are what I enjoyed the most.My only problem with this movie was that it was not longer. It was kinda obvious that it had been edited within a inch of its life and I think I would have enjoyed it even if it was 30-60 minutes. I hope the DVD release rectifies that.All of that said, my reccomendation is to go see this movie!!!

Titanic, Hard Rain, and now Poseidon. I'm actually shocking myself to say that Poseidon is rivalling Titanic in my eyes. But Titanic is my main love.I'd already seen The Poseidon Adventure, and Beyond The Poseidon Adventure, before I got to see this on HD, so I knew what to expect. I thought I'd feel some loyalty towards the original, but I was blown away by this, and to watch it on a massive screen AND in HD as well, words cannot describe the experience. The sound is absolutely amazing, we had to keep turning the sound down, in order not to frighten the neighbours, and the picture is beyond perfect. Honestly I can't rave about HD much more. I actually went out the next afternoon to buy the regular DVD to compare, but I just had to do the review first. I loved the movie that much that I would have bought it anyway.I agree with some other reviewers that yes, the character development is not great, but I hope someday there will be a director's cut, as many of Fergie's scenes got cut. Fergie (or Stacy Ferguson if you prefer) was my one highlight of seeing this film - at the time I didn't realise Kurt Russell or Mia Maestro was in it - but I was disappointed to see she didn't have very much screen times. She's gorgeous, and has a gorgeous voice to match, but we didn't get to hear much of the latter either. I wish she could have shown off her acting skills by being one of the survivors. If only for a little while. My other very small problems with the movie were the loss of the Christmas tree, which played a pivotal role in the original. That should have stayed. The fact that not many of the passengers in the ballroom get a choice whether to go or not with the ragtag bunch of determined-to-escape passengers (Fergie, lift your feet and go!) I felt was also wrong. As they could have tried to escape. But then it did make for a spectacular scene, particularly when Fergie's character went over to the captain (I think?) and gave him a hug. That's when you know they know they have nothing left, but to surrender to whatever is about to happen.Also, some reviewers have complained about the fact that the scene with spotting the rogue wave on radar was cut. Why complain?! The director had to cut something to cut it down, it was probably unnecessary anyway, so it has to go. You have to be brutal. But this starts the sentimentality of the film - Richard Dreyfuss's character, alone at New Year, since his partner deserted him, is the first to spot the rogue wave, interrupting his impromptu suicide attempt. Believe me, if you're going to start crying at a film that was the point I nearly did! What a wuss.The rest of the cast were excellent though, my favourite was Mia Maestro, who I already knew from starring in Alias. She was the only person who stopped to help Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) & Chris (Mike Vogel), and her fear when they were trapped in that very small, and partly caved in air vent made me genuinely terrified myself. And let's face it, her cross necklace saved the day in the end!Most of the characters you will begin to warm to just when the ship capsizes in a few shocking minutes, when I swore I would never set foot on a ship again! There are the few stereotypical characters, mainly the Kurt Russell character, doing the overbearing and overprotective father routine on his daughter who's secretly engaged. The single mother & her son weren't given THAT much screen time - a lot of the others did get more - but the scene were she's on one side of a wall, and he's on the other, and it's slowly filling with water, will bring out the maternal side to anyone.Of course, with these films it's always a race against time, which is probably why I enjoy them so much. What's so original about this & funnily enough, the original is that the ship is capsized. Therefore, a million times the obstacles, and a REAL race against time, and the rising water. (Plus I can't swim that well, so it makes it even more shocking.) Yes, some of the characters do die along the way (and there's a similar death to Shelley Winter's death from the original), and I did shed a little tear, at one particular character death. I had to hide my face behind the cushion I just happened to be clutching throughout most of the film. Some of the death scenes, albeit not gory, were very realistic, and the expressions on the characters as they died have left an impression on me. Elevators come crashing down (look out if you happen to be UNDERNEATH it at the time), people fall great heights, and bodies get burnt to a crisp. Nice images huh?I absolutely adore this movie, and eagerly await a possible director's cut, or a better special edition, with deleted scenes. There appear to be no deleted scenes featured on the HD, although it's not much of a loss, when you see what is on it. You're quite spoilt. Complete with an in movie experience, which I'm not sure about, as I think, as I do with commentaries, it could be quite irritating.This movie is now a major high up feature on my favourites list, and I'm so happy to actually own it myself. Even if it's not on HD. But I'll make do. I'll try and sneak the HD into the DVD player again soon.",4,This would have been amazing at the cinema but I'll make do with a 50 inch TV,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,5236,"['must', 'say', 'have',

1006404,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000GRUMPU,Mel Odom,"[2, 3]","Everyone knows the story of the POSEIDON.  This is only the third movie to bear the name and be based (loosely) on Paul Gallico's novel, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  There was also a sequel to the original diaster film made by Irwin Allen that starred Ernest Borgnine and Shelly Winters and a ton of others that went on to be major stars.This version offers Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, and Andre Braugher.  Unfortunately, it only features the actors and actresses in roles that you can understand at a glance.  There are no real characters here, no sense of history.What you do get is a knuckle-buster of an adrenaline-soaked movie.  After POSEIDON was overturned by the rogue wave about eighteen minutes into the film, I didn't draw a breath till the final frames rolled through.  Was the plot predictable?  Sure.  Could I figure out who was going to live and who was going to die?  I was right more times than I was wrong.POSEIDON was shot on 53 sound stages, some of them several stories tall.  The special effects were amazing and the digital work is unsurpassed.  The ship felt real even though it wasn't.In this HD-DVD version, the video portions are beautiful and really show off the cinematography and sets.  But the audio is where POSEIDON soars.

Of the three POSEIDON films, this one has the least involving or interesting characters.  Kurt Russell is the ex-mayor of New York who is on the ship with his daughter (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA'S Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend/fiancee (Mike Vogel).

So it was inevitable that I would see Poseidon, a movie that must be witnessed on the big screen for the full effect.Everyone knows the story by now: Poseidon, a massive cruise liner, flips over when a ""rogue wave"" strikes during a New Year's Eve celebration.  Just about every passenger is gathered in the grand ballroom, although the youngsters are also celebrating in one of the (invariably many) nightclubs on the ship.  And just like that, their world is literally turned upside down.Our hero is the professional gambler, Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas).  Rugged, shifty, and a little too smooth for his own good, Dylan is an ex-Navy man who lost his moral center.  He finally meets a woman seemingly immune to his charms in the form of Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett).  What's a lovable rogue to do?One of those rich folks that Dylan separates from their money is Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former New York City mayor and ex-fireman.  His daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) struggles for her independence with her boyfriend Christian (Mike Vogel). There's also the lovelorn Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) who is considering killing himself, and the secret couple of Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez) who smuggles aboard Elena Gonzalez (Mia Maestro). And how could we forget one-note Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon)!While the ship's captain, Michael Bradford (Andre Braugher) advises that everyone stay in the ballroom, Dylan has other plans.  He leads Maggie, Conor, Robert, Richard, and Marco to find his daughter in the nightclub.  Facing their own struggles to survive in the nightclub are Jennifer, Christian, Elena and yes...Lucky Larry.I don't remember the original Poseidon Adventure very well, but it was a very detached experience, much less horror and much more of a character study.  Fortunately, director Wolfgang Petersen isn't interested in showing how good an actor can mime hysterics.  Instead, he goes for the throat; this is a disaster film and it looks like it: dead bodies float everywhere.  When the ship flips, everything flips with it, and we can never forget that our protagonists are upside-down because every sign, door, and table is the wrong way.  And then there's the water.Gurgling, growling, snaking through shafts, suffused with flames; water has never been so terrifying.  The survivors must swim through a conflagration, in the dark, through a nettle of wires, past floating dead bodies, and at one point, hold their breath to the breaking point.  It is horrible.  It is undoubtedly realistic.  It is a disaster movie with a capital D.Throughout, there are little bits of humor that help relieve the tension.  I mean, there's a guy named Lucky Larry for crying out loud!  Conversely, Poseidon is deadly serious about the plight of its characters, and the survivors must make a host of moral choices that force us to ask: faced with survival or death, would we make the same decisions and sacrifices?Disaster movies are in a particular quandary these days.  It's no longer sufficient to pretend that we're watching a make believe event that can happen to fictional people.  Always lurking in the back of our minds is the possibility that whatever disaster we're witnessing could happen to us...or happened recently.  When is a movie about a disaster appropriate?The answer is that there is no appropriate timing for a film.  I think releasing Poseidon on May Day was an inspired choice.  It's our reaction to it that moviegoers must ultimately decide for themselves.  If the film disturbs you...then perhaps that was the point.If you're ready for a wild ride, if you've ever been afraid of water, or if you always wondered what nature thinks of big floating cities in her oceans...see Poseidon.",4,A disaster movie with a capital D,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,3866,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'disaster', 'movies', 'also', 'recently', 'went', 'cruise', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'water', 'was', 'inevitable', 'would', 'see', 'Poseidon', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'witnessed', 'big', 'screen', 'full', 'effect.Everyone', 'story', 'now', 'Poseidon', 'massive', 'cruise', 'liner', 'flips', 'when', 'rogue', 'wave', 'strikes', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'celebration', 'Just', 'passenger', 'gathered', 'grand', 'ballroom', 'youngsters', 'are', 'also', 'celebrating', 'one', 'invariably', 'many', 'nightclubs', 'ship', 'just', 'world', 'literally', 'turned', 'upside', 'down.Our', 'hero', 'professional', 'gambler', 'Dylan', 'Johns', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Rugged', 'shifty', 'little', 'too', 'smooth', 'own', 'good', 'Dylan', 'ex-Navy', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'moral', 'center', 'finally', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'immune', 'charms', 'form', 'Maggie', 'James', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'son', 'Conor', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'What', 'lovable', 'rogue', 'do', 'One', 'rich', 'folks', 'Dylan', 'separates', 'money', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'former', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mayor', 'ex-fireman', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'independence', 'boyfriend', 'Christian', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'also', 'lovelorn', 'Richard', 'Nelson', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'considering', 'killing', 'secret', 'couple', 'Marco', 'Valentin', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'who', 'aboard', 'Elena', 'Gonzalez', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'how', 'could', 'forget', 'one-note', 'Lucky', 'Larry', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'ship', 'captain', 'Michael', 'Bradford', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'everyone', 'stay', 'ballroom', 'Dylan', 'other', 'plans', 'Maggie', 'Conor', 'Robert', 'Richard', 'Marco', 'find', 'daughter', 'nightclub', 'Facing', 'own', 'struggles', 'survive', 'nightclub', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Christian', 'Elena', 'yes', 'Lucky', 'Larry.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'detached', 'experience', 'much', 'less', 'horror', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', ""n't"", 'interested', 'showing', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'mime', 'hysterics', 'Instead', 'throat', 'disaster', 'film', 'dead', 'bodies', 'float', 'everywhere', 'When', 'ship', 'everything', 'flips', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'protagonists', 'are', 'upside-down', 'sign', 'door', 'table', 'wrong', 'way', 'then', 'water.Gurgling', 'growling', 'snaking', 'shafts', 'suffused', 'flames', 'water', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'terrifying', 'survivors', 'must', 'swim', 'conflagration', 'dark', 'nettle', 'wires', 'past', 'floating', 'dead', 'bodies', 'one', 'point', 'hold', 'breath', 'breaking', 'point', 'horrible', 'undoubtedly', 'realistic', 'disaster', 'movie', 'capital', 'D.Throughout', 'are', 'little', 'bits', 'humor', 'help', 'relieve', 'tension', 'mean', 'guy', 'named', 'Lucky', 'Larry', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Conversely', 'Poseidon', 'deadly', 'serious', 'plight', 'characters', 'survivors', 'must', 'make', 'host', 'moral', 'choices', 'force', 'ask', 'faced', 'survival', 'death', 'would', 'make', 'same', 'decisions', 'sacrifices', 'Disaster', 'movies', 'are', 'particular', 'quandary', 'days', 'no', 'longer', 'sufficient', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'watching', 'make', 'believe', 'event', 'can', 'happen', 'fictional', 'people', 'Always', 'lurking', 'back', 'minds', 'possibility', 'disaster', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'could', 'happen', 'happened', 'recently', 'When', 'movie', 'disaster', 'appropriate', 'answer', 'appropriate', 'timing', 'film', 'think', 'releasing', 'Poseidon', 'May', 'Day', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'reaction', 'moviegoers', 'must', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'film', 'disturbs', 'then', 'perhaps', 'was', 'point.If', ""'re"", 'ready', 'wild', 'ride', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'afraid', 'water', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'nature', 'thinks', 'big', 'floating', 'cities', 'oceans', 'see', 'Poseidon']",N/A

A majority of the passengers die, except for a selected few: seasoned gambler Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) and daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), unlucky-in-love homosexual Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), Jen's fianc&#65533; Christian (Mike Vogel), Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon), and onboard waiter Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez). But as they proceed through the sinking ship, they must deal with the fact that not everyone will survive.Back in 1972, there was a popular disaster flick called ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Starring Gene Hackman and Shelly Winters, this flick wasn't anything big, but it earned Winters a Golden Globe win for Best Supporting Actress, and had the song ""The Morning After"" which, of course, got an Academy Award for Best Original Song. And it's no surprise that a remake would pop out of nowhere, because who wants to see this opus with modern-day special effects and new actors to populate the Poseidon. Who better to turn to disaster flick maestro Wolfgang Peterson?And boy does this movie pack on the special effects. Sure, they're nothing really special, but whenever an explosion occurs, glass breaks, or water fills, they can bring up blood curdling tension. And wait until you see the finale, which can be explained as nothing more or less of a doozy. Director Peterson knows what the crowd wants, and he delivers. Composer Klaus Badelt (""16 Blocks"") even adds a good soundtrack that is actually suspenseful than cheesy.Compared to what critics are saying, ""Poseidon"" has some decent acting. Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell take advantage of their 2D characters and give them enough heroics and heart. There are some good performances from up-and-coming actresses Emmy Rossum (""Phantom of the Opera"") and Jacinda Barrett (""Ladder 49""). Sadly, Peterson is sometimes too fixated with the disaster that he fumbles dealing with stereotypical characters, including the ones played by Richard Dreyfuss (as the gay guy), Jimmy Bennett (as the annoying little brat), and Mia Maestro (overacting as the stowaway) who fail to come off worthy of our attention. But as long as you focus on the more developed characters (Lucas and Russell the most), it shouldn't be a big deal.Which is why I had to give this film an 8. The suspense of this movie is massive, but it's dramatically inert when several annoying characters are introduced (I know I'm gonna go to hell for this, but I wished they got rid of Nelson and the annoying brat), thus failing to let Josh Lucas grow as an actor and Kurt Russell get back his credibility (though he had success with 2003's ""Dark Blue""). But aside from this, if you're looking for a good popcorn movie, ""Poseidon"" should entertain.",3,"""Oy vey, that would be ironic.""",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,3017,"['What', 'began', 'innocent', 'New', 'Year', 'party', 'sexy', 'performance', 'singer', 'Gloria', 'Black', 'Eyed', 'Peas', 'Fergie', 'Stacy', 'Ferguson', 'literally', 'upside', 'down', 'passengers', 'luxury', 'liner', 'Poseidon', 'majority', 'passengers', 'die', 'selected', 'few', 'seasoned', 'gambler', 'Dylan', 'Johns', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'mayor', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Maggie', 'James', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'son', 'Conor', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'unlucky-in-love', 'homosexual', 'Richard', 'Nelson', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'stowaway', 'Elena', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'Jen', 'fianc', '65533', 'Christian', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'Lucky', 'Larry', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'onboard', 'waiter', 'Marco', 'Valentin', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'proceed', 'sinking', 'ship', 'must', 'deal', 'fact', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'survive.Back', '1972', 'was', 'popular', 'disaster', 'flick', 'called', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Starring', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'big', 'earned', 'Winters', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'had', 'song', 'Morning', 'course', 'got', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'surprise', 'remake', 'would', 'pop', 'nowhere', 'who', 'see', 'opus', 'modern-day', 'special', 'effects', 'new', 'actors', 'populate', 'Poseidon', 'Who', 'better', 'turn', 'disaster', 'flick', 'maestro', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'boy', 'movie', 'pack', 'special', 'effects', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'whenever', 'explosion', 'glass', 'breaks', 'water', 'fills', 'can', 'bring', 'up', 'blood', 'curdling', 'tension', 'wait', 'see', 'finale', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'doozy', 'Director', 'Peterson', 'what', 'crowd', 'Composer', 'Klaus', 'Badelt', '16', 'Blocks', 'even', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'suspenseful', 'cheesy.Compared', 'what', 'critics', 'are', 'saying', 'Poseidon', 'decent', 'acting', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'take', 'advantage', '2D', 'characters', 'give', 'enough', 'heroics', 'heart', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'up-and-coming', 'actresses', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Ladder', '49', 'Sadly', 'Peterson', 'sometimes', 'too', 'fixated', 'disaster', 'dealing', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'including', 'ones', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'gay', 'guy', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'annoying', 'little', 'brat', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'overacting', 'stowaway', 'who', 'fail', 'come', 'off', 'worthy', 'attention', 'as', 'long', 'focus', 'more', 'developed', 'characters', 'Lucas', 'Russell', 'most', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal.Which', 'why', 'had', 'give', 'film', '8', 'suspense', 'movie', 'massive', 'dramatically', 'inert', 'when', 'several', 'annoying', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'know', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'hell', 'wished', 'got', 'rid', 'Nelson', 'annoying', 'brat', 'thus', 'failing', 'let', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'grow', 'actor', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'get', 'back', 'credibility', 'had', 'success', '2003', 'Dark', 'Blue', 'aside', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'Poseidon', 'should', 'entertain']",N/A

While the original was certainly a great movie, why should its existence reduce the enjoyment you can get from this film?  I would recommend viewers judge this film on its own merits, as most comparisons to the original will only limit your own enjoyment.This is an exciting movie with some great special effects.  I know that many people have knocked the character development and the uninspired dialogue, but I think that they miss the point of the film.  When you watch this film, I would encourage you not to build up any false expectations.  Instead, realize that the show you are about to view was made with great special effects and will feature numerous escapes ""just in the knick of time"" (Even if most are out of the realm of realism).  This is not an academy award nominee for best picture, but that doens't mean that it isn't a lot of fun to watch.While the characters aren't developed very fully, most have a lot of charisma.  Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, and Richard Dreyfus really stand out, but the rest do well, too.  The nature of the film, in which we're never sure who's going to live or die, makes the many close excapes exiting.  In fact, several of the stars die in the process, so you never really know who is going to make it.  Thus, even though we all know that some will escape, we never know until the end which ones that will be.I also appreciate the fact that the film is only 1 1/2 hours long.  For an action film like this, that's about the limit before the viewer tires of all the effects and close calls.All in all, this film is one that most people can enjoy without having to think too hard.  While there is no sex in the film, the scenes of people dying are often disturbing, so the film is not for the very young.

Emmy Rossum is pretty bad here, but at least she looks good. If you go to a movie about a ship that flips over due to a 100 foot wave that pops up out of nowhere, leaving people trying to make it the top (actual bottom) of the ship, are you really expecting good acting and dialogue? The special effects are good, but I still can't figure out where the 160 million dollar budget went. It is fast paced and entertaining at times. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back when I left the theater, but then again I knew what to expect going in.

Every moment once the ship was hit by the wave was a moment of seat edged excitement. The actors all do a superb job! I say that because alot of them performed their own stunts. These were not easy stunts either however, director Wolfgang Petersen requested that the actors do any stunts that they felt ok with doing.. and you really notice them doing alot of dangerous ones. For instance one of our lead actresses goes sliding down a cluttered hallway with gallons of water as the ship begins to tilt (not the first tilt). Also actor Josh Lucas really swims in water under a humongous layer of fire! Plus all the actors spent more time under water than any human is supposed to. Bravo once again to the cast. Now for the sets. Absolutely stunning and worth an Academy Award!! The sets are remarkable in every scene.. truly no lack of detail. ""Poseidon"" is an action packed crowd pleaser with great attention to detail. Okay, now to explain my title. If you have seen the film ""The Poseidon Adventure"" you know this isnt really a remake. This film more less only takes the same idea and runs with it. All new characters to root for and a completely different script.. dont expect the Shelley Winters character to pop up in this one. The only thing that is the same with both movies is, ..a ship (called the Poseidon) is hit by a massive wave that turns it over on New Years. Enjoy! Here are some other films by this director.

I must say that being a pre-teen when the original film was released, I saw this film many times at the theater. Who could resist this adventure? The young boy is one of the heroes and we get to ooggle  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants! In the original film when Roddy McDowell (""Ackers"") and Shelly Winters (""Bel"") die we feel genuinely sad. When Jack Albertson (""Manny"") discovers his wife of 50 years has suffered a heart attack after saving the preacher from a horrible under water death, we feel empathy for him (Albertson). I am a big fan of the original, though I must admit it has lost some steam as I've grown older. First I want to point out I have a very nice home theater with a 10 foot screen. I watched a HD version of the new film, so it had everything going for it. The remake doesn't take any time to develop the characters, so nobody cares that their lives are in danger or if they die! There is no build up to the giant wave, so there is no tension when it capsizes the ship! I also thought the special effects were NOT all that big an upgrade, if at all!  This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen! All the acters including the stars phoned in the performances and the action sequences did not equal the sweat inducing ""swim along the rope under water"" sequence of the original.

1006417,A3KXFQQFBPJTQE,B000GRUMPU,"Mr N Forbes-warren ""author of RESURGENCE and ...","[5, 8]","The original POSEIDON ADVENTURE was one of my childhood favourite movies, which I had on video and watched many times, it was big in our house! And I'm happy to say the long-awaited Wolfgang Petersen remake was well worth seeing on the big screen! My heart missed a beat when I saw the name IRWIN ALLEN PRODUCTIONS and also SHEILA ALLEN, Irwin's widow, as executive producer at the start during the intro - awesome CGI shots leading into the jogging-on-the-deck scene! When I saw those names I thought YEEESSSS! Irwin Allen has made some great movies(THE LOST WORLD(1960), ONE HOUR TO DOOMSDAY, the original Poseidon of course, THE TOWERING INFERNO, FLOOD, HANGING BY A THREAD, FIRE!), and also some stinkers(BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE NIGHT THE BRIDGE FELL DOWN, CAVE-IN, WHEN TIME RAN OUT, THE SWARM) and lest we forget, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS, THE TIME TUNNEL et al for TV . . .but at least the baddies were hugely entertaining in a guilty pleasure kind of way that I rate them well. But I digress. Like many disaster movies, the usual nuts line up for the New Year's Eve cruise. When the POSEIDON capsizes due to a rogue wave(?!), a compulsive career gambler played by JOSH LUCAS decides to climb up to the propellor shafts against the orders of the captain who instructs those that survived the capsizing to remain in the main dancehall. Joing  JOsh are an ex NY mayor and fireman Robert Ramsay played by KURT RUSSELL, a jilted gay man(cashing in on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN methinks) played by RICHARD DREYFUS!!!!(Mr Holland's Opus, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the fireman's daughter played by the lovely EMMY ROSSUM(Phantom of the Opera, The Day After Tomorrow) who looked great wet(hee), and many more. You get the rest. Some live, some die. As this motley group climbs up the ship through a surreal and inverted world, you get to see some awesome setpieces and suspenseful action scenes - the aircon shaft scene was well and truly claustrophobic and the elevator/burning oil sequence was brilliantly excecuted bringing back fond memories of the original. The ballast tanks flooding was good and also like the original, anyone remember Stella Stevens swimming in her panties? You get a snatch of this as well. Of course, with every disaster movie you get an annoying kid, the one here was no exception. Again, I refer to lots of disaster movies of the 1970s like TOWERING INFERNO, CASSANDRA CROSSING(clock this one, this is fun), EARTHQUAKE  . . . the annoying kid cliche makes the experience complete! The ending was truer to Paul Gallico's novel on which this is based than the original too, and again this was well executed. Overall, this remake is genuinely gripping in places, boasts some eye-popping SFX and excellent production design and cinematography. Oh, one moret hing, Black Eyed Peas fans will get a kick out of Stacey Ferguson as the ballroom singer on the doomed cruise!

Sure as heck, my fears were very much real.Comparison between the two in inevitable - and I've even read the original (and brilliant) Paul Gallico novel, which both films heavily diverted from.  But even standing alone, this ""Poseidon"" can't - it's just a fairly awful movie by itself.The S.S. Poesidon is capsized in the middle of the ocean by a ""rogue wave"" - turned upside down so those wishing to survive quickly realize they have to work their way through an upside-down world and get to the bottm of the ship (now the top) and somehow get out, in order to survive.  Simple enough premise, but clocking in at only 90 minutes ""Poseidon"" doesn't even give you a chance to know or care for the characters; where the first story had some lead-in time before the wave hits, where you got to learn a bit about Rogo and Linda, Susan and Robin, Reverend Scott and the Rosens, etc. - here, the wave hits maybe 15 minutes into the film or so, with so little time given to developing the people in the story, you couldn't really care that much for them when they become endangered or die later.  Richard Dreyfuss plays a weepy, suucidal gay man who is about to hurl himself off the ship himself when he sees the monster wave coming and suddenly wants very much to live; Josh Lucas, as Dylan, is an adventurer/bad boy who gives the best performance in the film (not saying much), and is BY FAR the only truly interesting character to watch; Kurt Russell is the ex-firefighter who is on board with his daughter (Emmy Rossum), and Russell's acting here is so hammy it's almost laughable.  ""Six Feet Under"" star Freddy Rodriguez - one of the best, most real performances in the film - is given WAY short-shrift, in more ways then one, in one particular scene that made me mad as hell just watching it.  Kevin Dillon, as a chauvinistic creep, turns in a performance that easily makes you forget the guy's brother was noimnated for an Oscar for ""Crash"" so recently - ugh, so much for talent running in the family!So the ship overturns and Josh Lucas decides he's not staying around and waiting for the water to come in.  Kurt Russell, searching for his daughter in the disco on another floor of the ship, goes with him - but there's no scene where those willing to climb up and out try to get anyone else to come.  Nothing's really said, a few people just start following Josh Lucas and that's it.  Andre Braugher, in maybe THE WORST performance of his career as the Captain, insanely tells everyone to stay where they are and help is coming, etc. - but unlike the original, it takes awhile for water to get into that ballroom ... and by the time it does, you won't give a damn who drowns and who doesn't (and in fact, those trying to survive sort of indirectly cause the room to finally flood, in the first place - how much does THAT suck??).The obstacles and challenges the motley crew of survivors go through are pretty lame - and yet, somehow, whenever these passengers find a ship's map, or need technical info on how the ship works, someone always either easily reads the map or already knows the answer.  It's amazing, and amazingly stupid.  The only two scenes worth watching are the actual capsizing of the ship (great special effects, period), and at the end, when those who make it do get off (how they get out makes more sense, logically, then the original's ending, as well - when the survivors just showed up at the time the rescuers were cutting through).But overall the script stinks and the acting is sub-par and Wolfgang Petersen shouldn't have taken it on without giving the project more care.  There's no love or TLC put into making this movie by anyone - worst of all, especially not by the director.",1,This Poseidon S(T)INKS,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,3928,"['huge', 'huge', 'HUGE', 'fan', '1972', 'original', 'approached', 'seeing', 'Poseidon', 'even', 'decent', 'cast', ""'d"", 'approach', 'rattlesnake', 'wearing', 'shorts', 'shoes', 'socks', 'total', 'trepidation', 'fear', 'Sure', 'heck', 'fears', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'real.Comparison', 'two', 'inevitable', ""'ve"", 'even', 'read', 'original', 'brilliant', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'novel', 'films', 'heavily', 'diverted', 'even', 'standing', 'alone', 'Poseidon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'fairly', 'awful', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'S.S.', 'Poesidon', 'capsized', 'middle', 'ocean', 'rogue', 'wave', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'so', 'wishing', 'survive', 'quickly', 'realize', 'have', 'work', 'way', 'upside-down', 'world', 'get', 'bottm', 'ship', 'now', 'top', 'somehow', 'get', 'out', 'order', 'survive', 'Simple', 'enough', 'premise', 'clocking', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'Poseidon', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'chance', 'know', 'care', 'characters', 'where', 'first', 'story', 'had', 'lead-in', 'time', 'wave', 'hits', 'where', 'got', 'learn', 'bit', 'Rogo', 'Linda', 'Susan', 'Robin', 'Reverend', 'Scott', 'Rosens', 'etc', 'here', 'wave', 'maybe', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'so', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'given', 'developing', 'people', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'when', 'become', 'endangered', 'die', 'later', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'weepy', 'suucidal', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'hurl', 'off', 'ship', 'when', 'monster', 'wave', 'coming', 'suddenly', 'very', 'much', 'live', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Dylan', 'adventurer/bad', 'boy', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'BY', 'FAR', 'only', 'truly', 'interesting', 'character', 'watch', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'ex-firefighter', 'who', 'board', 'daughter', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Russell', 'acting', 'here', 'so', 'hammy', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Six', 'Feet', 'star', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'real', 'performances', 'film', 'given', 'WAY', 'short-shrift', 'more', 'ways', 'then', 'one', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'made', 'mad', 'hell', 'just', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'chauvinistic', 'creep', 'performance', 'easily', 'forget', 'guy', 'brother', 'was', 'noimnated', 'Oscar', 'Crash', 'so', 'recently', 'ugh', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'running', 'family', 'ship', 'overturns', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'not', 'staying', 'around', 'waiting', 'water', 'come', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'searching', 'daughter', 'disco', 'floor', 'ship', 'scene', 'where', 'willing', 'climb', 'up', 'try', 'get', 'anyone', 'else', 'come', 'Nothing', 'really', 'said', 'few', 'people', 'just', 'start', 'following', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'maybe', 'THE', 'WORST', 'performance', 'career', 'Captain', 'insanely', 'everyone', 'stay', 'where', 'are', 'help', 'coming', 'etc', 'original', 'awhile', 'water', 'get', 'ballroom', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'who', 'who', ""n't"", 'fact', 'trying', 'survive', 'sort', 'indirectly', 'cause', 'room', 'finally', 'flood', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'much', 'suck', '.The', 'obstacles', 'motley', 'crew', 'survivors', 'go', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'yet', 'somehow', 'whenever', 'passengers', 'find', 'ship', 'map', 'need', 'technical', 'info', 'how', 'ship', 'someone', 'always', 'easily', 'map', 'already', 'answer', 'amazing', 'amazingly', 'stupid', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'watching', 'are', 'actual', 'capsizing', 'ship', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'period', 'end', 'when', 'who', 'make', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'how', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'sense', 'logically', 'then', 'original', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'survivors', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'time', 'rescuers', 'were', 'cutting', '.But', 'script', 'stinks', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'giving', 'project', 'more', 'care', 'love', 'TLC', 'put', 'making', 'movie', 'anyone', 'worst', 'especially', 'not', 'director']",N/A

Perhaps, by having two familiar faces, Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, the director wants the audience to fill in the blanks about their respective characters.  Russell's is possibly an extension of the character that he played in ""Backdraft"" inasmuch as in this film he's a former New York firefighter turned mayor; Dreyfus is, perhaps, ""Matt Hooper"" from ""Jaws,"" after the great white scared him out of the closet.  Both actors didn't seem to stretch their acting muscles much in this film.As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, Josh Lucas's ""reformation"" from professional gambler to savior of the group is almost believable, considering the predicament in which the survivors find themselves.  Though he has more lines than original ""captain"" Leslie Neilson, Andre Braugher doesn't get too much screen time and ""goes down with the ship,""...literally.Because of the brevity of character development, the rest of the cast is filled out with your basic stereotypes: the single mom and son (Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett), the young couple (Emmy Rossum and Mike Vogel), the stowaway (Mia Maestro), the wise-ass (Kevin Dillon), and the noble crewman (Freddy Rodriquez).The special effects are indeed spectacular but more than thirty years have passed since the first film and it's logical that there would be an improvement in that area.  However, the first one benefited from having characters of whom the audience could connect.  By going ""straight for the jugular"" with the massive effort spent on CGI effects and stuntwork, Peterson has crafted a nice-looking package but with nothing inside.And even the original had a nifty John Williams' score; Klaus Bedelt's does not compare, even to his own superlative score to the hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.""The film does have one great bonus: the sinking of the ship at the film's end.

Too bad the new generation won't sit still for a gradual buildup of suspense, and deeper characters. Petersen has said, of the 1972 classic, ""It's charming to see that film, today. It's delightfully old fashioned."" I wonder if anyone will remember this version, thirty years hence, but this time around, there is suspense and spectacle. The problem is, once the ship turns over, the sets, though impressive, don't really look upside down (something Neame went to great lengths to showcase in the original). Josh Lucas had some unkind things to say about the characters and script of the 1972 version, but his statements would have carried more weight if this film had improved upon them. The capsizing is fine, but like many modern spectacles, is edited for confusion rather than clarity: somehow the shots don't ""read"" as cleanly as the similar shots from Neame's version. Purists will miss Manny, Belle, Nonnie, and especially Stella Stevens' Linda Rogo, and I'd advise them to go into this without the expectation that it will remind them of the first version. I suspect this film was at least a half hour longer before some studio boss decided to cut it down.

1006449,A2BCFN8IW56RIW,B000GRUMPU,Rusty Nails,"[2, 2]","Warner's Poseidon is less of a movie and more of an experiment in cinema as if Wolfgang Petersen tried to see if a film could be carried only by the authentic emotions of actors in peril. Unencumbered by character development or questions of who to follow, who lives or who dies, or which way to go (one of the most repeated sentiments is ""stay here and we die!"") Poseidon is filmed somewhat incredibly in sequence, with the actors doing their own stunts on gigantic sets.  Petersen and DP John Seale shoot with multiple hand-held cameras striving to capture actual anxiety in the performers documentary style.The result is... OK. Part of the problem is the mix of live action and visual effects. Sure the actors are experiencing on-set peril (wearing safety harnesses), but the film is so chock-full of effects work, from the 99% computer-generated opening shot to the numerous digital set extensions, that we become inured to the spectacle assuming everything was probably shot bluescreen. Nor does the marketing help. In a good DVD extra, Petersen and the actors talk about the harrowing experience of being on set. But their message has already been dulled by the segment's title, ""Ship on a stage,"" which conjures images of actors drinking Evian in trailers between takes.The performances also suffer from perhaps too big a dose of reality. Amazingly, that really is Josh Lucas swimming under a pool of fire. But Lucas' determined expression is the kind of mask we put on when trying to accomplish a task under stress. By putting his actors in difficult situations, Petersen has stripped away actor-y performances to reveal yet another level of performance never getting to primal emotion.Finally, Petersen can't get around the central emotional requirements of mainstream filmmaking. Petersen sets us up to believe that this is going to be a gritty keep moving-or-die drama. Yet, the characters have to pause and reflect when one of their group dies--even though we know that the water is rising quickly around them. These kind of concessions disrupt any attempt by Petersen to capture authentic terror.Poseidon is an intriguing experiment, a sort of big budget reality show in which not-quite bankable actors do their own stunts on gigantic soundstages. This Circus of the Stars-meets-Survivor is a taut, brisk watch forsaking even the expected denouement. But it its desire to strip away the conventions of the genre and distill film to the thinnest of narrative threads, Poseidon also does away with the reason we watch these films in the first place.",4,A $160 million Circus of the Stars,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2560,"['Warner', 'Poseidon', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'experiment', 'cinema', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'tried', 'see', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'carried', 'only', 'authentic', 'emotions', 'actors', 'peril', 'Unencumbered', 'character', 'development', 'questions', 'who', 'follow', 'who', 'who', 'way', 'go', 'one', 'most', 'repeated', 'sentiments', 'stay', 'here', 'die', 'Poseidon', 'filmed', 'somewhat', 'incredibly', 'sequence', 'actors', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'gigantic', 'sets', 'Petersen', 'DP', 'John', 'Seale', 'shoot', 'multiple', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'striving', 'capture', 'actual', 'anxiety', 'performers', 'documentary', 'style.The', 'result', 'OK.', 'Part', 'problem', 'mix', 'live', 'action', 'visual', 'effects', 'Sure', 'actors', 'are', 'experiencing', 'on-set', 'peril', 'wearing', 'safety', 'harnesses', 'film', 'so', 'chock-full', 'effects', 'work', '99', '%', 'computer-generated', 'opening', 'shot', 'numerous', 'digital', 'set', 'extensions', 'become', 'inured', 'spectacle', 'assuming', 'everything', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'bluescreen', 'marketing', 'help', 'good', 'DVD', 'extra', 'Petersen', 'actors', 'talk', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'being', 'set', 'message', 'already', 'been', 'dulled', 'segment', 'title', 'Ship', 'stage', 'images', 'actors', 'drinking', 'Evian', 'trailers', 'takes.The', 'performances', 'also', 'suffer', 'perhaps', 'too', 'big', 'dose', 'reality', 'Amazingly', 'really', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'swimming', 'pool', 'fire', 'Lucas', 'determined', 'expression', 'kind', 'mask', 'put', 'when', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'task', 'stress', 'putting', 'actors', 'difficult', 'situations', 'Petersen', 'stripped', 'away', 'actor-y', 'performances', 'reveal', 'yet', 'level', 'performance', 'never', 'getting', 'primal', 'emotion.Finally', 'Petersen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'central', 'emotional', 'requirements', 'mainstream', 'filmmaking', 'Petersen', 'up', 'believe', 'going', 'be', 'gritty', 'keep', 'moving-or-die', 'drama', 'characters', 'have', 'pause', 'reflect', 'when', 'one', 'group', 'even', 'know', 'water', 'rising', 'quickly', 'kind', 'concessions', 'disrupt', 'attempt', 'Petersen', 'capture', 'authentic', 'terror.Poseidon', 'intriguing', 'experiment', 'sort', 'big', 'budget', 'reality', 'show', 'not-quite', 'bankable', 'actors', 'do', 'own', 'stunts', 'gigantic', 'soundstages', 'Circus', 'Stars-meets-Survivor', 'taut', 'brisk', 'watch', 'forsaking', 'even', 'expected', 'denouement', 'desire', 'strip', 'away', 'conventions', 'genre', 'distill', 'film', 'thinnest', 'narrative', 'threads', 'Poseidon', 'also', 'away', 'reason', 'watch', 'films', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Well, I had high hopes for this movie, but I knew somehow it wasn't going to beat the original story becuase of all of the reviews that I had read.I was right.  This movie could have been so good, but unfortunately it seemed really rushed, and half of the script seemed missing.  For example, at the beginning of the movie we all know that a huge title wave is coming, and we were thinking that one of the crew members was going to inform the captain that something odd was showing up on the monitors.  But, no this didn't happen.  Instead we hear the captain saying ""I feel something odd.""  And then half a minute later, people are yelling ""There's a huge wave over there.""  I guess it came out of absolutely no where.  How unrealistic.Also, after the ship turns over, there is no true sence of panic, and no true sence of fear.  You don't hear anyone screaming hysterically!And some of the scenes in this movie are just absurd, and you would never hear them in a real life situation.  Becuase in real life most people will heroically try to help others in danger, and will even risk their own lives to help others.  I think that 9/11 is a really good example of what I mean.But in this movie, we have one really crazy scene. In this scene, the survivors are trying to get across an elevator shaft and Richard Dreyfuss is almost there except that he ends up having a crew member hanging onto his leg for dear life - becuase if he lets go, he will plummet to his death by falling down the elevator shaft.All of a sudden we start hearing ""Kick Him Off! Kick Him Off!""  yells Josh Lucas.  When I heard this line, I couldn't stop laughing.  My husband couldn't stop laughing either. At this point I knew that this movie was going to be a bit ridiculous, and for sure unrealistic.I still recommend the movie though becuase of the special effects, and it is still a Disaster Movie.

I've always been a big fan of Kurt Russell and think he's never given enough credit for his versatile acting skills.  He makes a good leader without being arrogrant or bossy.  In addition, Josh Lucas (Stealth,Glory Road) makes a great reluctant hero.  Of course, Emmy Rossum ofThe Phantom of the Operafame is always a pleasure to watch along with Richard Dryfuss whom we all learned to love inClose Encounters of the Third KindandJawsback in the '70's.  The acting is all very convincing as is most of the dialogue and sets.The special effects are not groundbreaking, but they are extraordinary and very believable.  They definitely have the ""WOW!"" factor even though we have seen these types of effects before (The Perfect Storm), only here they are better.This film is worth owning and stands much more on it's own rather than as a simple remake.  It's noteworthy that the two leaders played by Lucas and Russell work together rather than against each other as the two main characters (played by Hackman and Borgnine) did in the original film (The Poseidon Adventure).The ""Special Features"" are definitely worth viewing on the two-disc set ""Special Edition"" package.",4,Poseidon Floats on Its Own Merits,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1341,"['spotlight', 'review', 'G-Man', 'above', 'very', 'accurate', 'well-written', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', ""'ll"", 'try.I', 'think', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'remake', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'think', 'never', 'given', 'enough', 'credit', 'versatile', 'acting', 'skills', 'good', 'leader', 'being', 'arrogrant', 'bossy', 'addition', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Stealth', 'Glory', 'Road', 'great', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'course', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'ofThe', 'Phantom', 'Operafame', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Richard', 'Dryfuss', 'whom', 'learned', 'love', 'inClose', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'KindandJawsback', ""'70"", 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'most', 'dialogue', 'sets.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'very', 'believable', 'definitely', 'have', 'WOW', 'factor', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'types', 'effects', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'only', 'here', 'are', 'better.This', 'film', 'worth', 'owning', 'much', 'more', 'own', 'rather', 'simple', 'remake', 'noteworthy', 'two', 'leaders', 'played', 'Lucas', 'Russell', 'work', 'together', 'rather', 'other', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Hackman', 'Borgnine', 'did', 'original', 'film', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', '.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'two-disc', 'set', 'Special', 'Edition', 'package']",N/A

I've always been a huge fan of the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ('72) and still watch it every New Year's Eve the way some people will watch IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE for Christmas.But I did buy the 2-disc DVD.  Part of the reason for justifying this was that I was buying the extras, especially a documentary from the History Channel about rogue waves.As far as the movie goes, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be...but that's hardly an enthusiastic ""thumbs up"" either.  I kept thinking Roger Ebert's word to sum it up: ""perfunctory.""  That works for me.It's as if Hollywood has taken the screenwriting process away from the writers and handed it over to the folks who design amusement park rides.Movies are now calculated to rush your senses and ignore your inner organs...like your brain and your heart.  Just keep those pupils dilating and reflexes jumping.My biggest major beef with POSEIDON was the movie's choice to jettison what I felt was the coolest aspect of the original: it wasn't just a survival story, it was a metaphor for Life itself.The original film said, ""In an upside-down world, a rebellious religious leader leads a small group of believers UP while everyone else is going DOWN.""The remake says, ""We're just going to whack people every few mintues--but, man, it's gonna look so cool!""THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE told its story and its appeal has lasted over thirty-five years (and will live on).POSEIDON hit DVD three months after its release and will probably be piled in a clearance bin by the end of this year.Will Hollywood figure it out?  I doubt it.I don't blame the actors (like a lot of reviews here) because it all comes down to writing, writing, writing.I didn't care about any of these characters.  Not a one.  Think about the way the audience felt when a character died in the original (especially Gene Hackman's powerful scene of losing Mrs. Rosen).  POSEIDON never worked on that level.The music biz made a big deal that Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas has a cameo...but I thought she looked and sounded like Charo--coochie, coochie! (Talk about a bad Love Boat flashback!).The special effects provided some good moments, especially the sequence of the tidal wave capsizing the ship.  As usual, the only good thing Hollywood films these days can be praised for are their special effects...and little else.If you haven't seen the original, CHECK IT OUT.  I've talked to a lot of young people who haven't seen it and didn't feel like watching the same movie again.I tell them two things:Even if you saw POSEIDON, then you didn't see THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.And, yes, it's in color.",3,The Wreck of the S.S.

1006467,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000GRUMPU,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 4]","With a movie like ""Poseidon,"" the first question to ask is ""Why did they bother to remake this?""  The similarly titled 1972 all-star disaster epic was, after all, the definitive cinematic statement on phantom waves that turn an ocean liner upside down in the middle of the ocean.  But ever in the pursuit of quick bucks, Hollywood decided that remaking a film with a tweaked screenplay was more cost-efficient than commissioning a brand new script.""Poseidon"" is not a terrible film.  It's just a ho-hum, predictable one.  As you watch, you know that almost everyone aboard the massive ship will die horrible deaths, a small group will reach temporary safety only to expire along the way, while a few will make it to the final credits.  Therein, I guess, lies the suspense.  When ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was made thirty-four years ago, the filmmakers depended on elaborate, upside-down sets and huge miniatures to suggest the topsy-turvy disaster that unexpectedly befalls a cruise ship on New Year's Eve.  It was quite an impressive picture with some beloved old-timers in featured roles and, in the era of the big-budget disaster film, racked up a fortune at the box office.The cast of characters is different this time around, but still registers ""generic.""  There's the suicidal businessman (Richard Dreyfuss) whose dive into the ocean to kill himself is interrupted by an enormous wave bearing down on the ship.  Rather than let the wave finish what he started out to do, he retreats into the grand ballroom.  There's the overly self-assured ship's captain (Andre Braugher) who assures the survivors that they are perfectly safe in the ballroom, which is waterproof and air tight.  This is a clear signal that those folks are doomed.There's  former big city mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), the overprotective father of Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), who is in love with hunk Christian (Mike Vogel).  Rounding out the roster of characters are an obnoxious passenger (Kevin Dillon), a waiter who serves as a guide through the ship (Freddy Rodriguez), a pretty stowaway (Mia Maestro), and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a gambler who makes a living playing high-stakes poker on cruise ships.Dylan, the apparent main character, musters his little group together and leads them through all sorts of danger in a hopeful attempt to reach the bottom -- now the top -- of the ship to safety.  Navigating the narrow passageways, elevator shafts, air ducts, and ballast tanks proves tough going as fears and tensions mount.  But there is never real concern for these folks, who are on hand simply to picked off by the ravages of water, fire, and heavy machinery.Like ""Mission Impossible III,"" ""Poseidon"" offers no surprises.  It is a well crafted movie whose special effects must have cost considerably more than the collective price tag for talent.  Digital technology makes anything possible, but we are at the point when we are no longer blown away by an obviously digitally-rendered shot.  The opening, uninterrupted shot of the Poseidon is an example.  The camera views the ship from the starboard side at water level, sweeps up and across the bow of the ship to port, where it rises to deck level, glides along toward the back of the ship, tracks into a jogging Josh Lucas, then continues its overview of the ship, winding up viewing it from aft.  Five years ago this would have blown audiences away.  Now, however, it doesn't register as anything special.What is missed most in this remake is the aging Shelley Winters, who stole the original film with the scene in which she swims underwater to help her comrades continue their escape to safety.  No longer the svelte ingenue of ""A Place in the Sun,"" Winters unashamedly swam like a whale, giving new meaning to service above and beyond the call of duty.  In ""Poseidon,"" Lucas's Dylan dives daredevil-like through water blazing with a coat of oil.  Though more dangerous, perhaps, than Winters' feat in the earlier film, it pales in dramatic impact.""Poseidon"" looks more like a made-for-TV film than a big-screen effort.  Its second-tier collection of actors and its over-familiarity make it hardly worth adding it to your ""Must See"" list.",2,"Water, water everywhere, but not a bit of substance",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,4183,"['movie', 'Poseidon', 'first', 'question', 'ask', 'Why', 'did', 'bother', 'remake', 'similarly', 'titled', '1972', 'all-star', 'disaster', 'epic', 'was', 'definitive', 'cinematic', 'statement', 'phantom', 'waves', 'turn', 'ocean', 'liner', 'upside', 'down', 'middle', 'ocean', 'ever', 'pursuit', 'quick', 'bucks', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'remaking', 'film', 'tweaked', 'screenplay', 'was', 'more', 'cost-efficient', 'commissioning', 'brand', 'new', 'script', 'Poseidon', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'just', 'ho-hum', 'predictable', 'one', 'watch', 'know', 'almost', 'everyone', 'massive', 'ship', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'small', 'group', 'will', 'reach', 'temporary', 'safety', 'only', 'expire', 'way', 'few', 'will', 'make', 'final', 'credits', 'Therein', 'guess', 'suspense', 'When', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'was', 'made', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'ago', 'filmmakers', 'depended', 'elaborate', 'upside-down', 'sets', 'huge', 'miniatures', 'suggest', 'topsy-turvy', 'disaster', 'unexpectedly', 'cruise', 'ship', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'picture', 'beloved', 'old-timers', 'featured', 'roles', 'era', 'big-budget', 'disaster', 'film', 'racked', 'up', 'fortune', 'box', 'cast', 'characters', 'different', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'generic', 'suicidal', 'businessman', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'dive', 'ocean', 'kill', 'interrupted', 'enormous', 'wave', 'bearing', 'down', 'ship', 'Rather', 'let', 'wave', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'do', 'grand', 'ballroom', 'overly', 'self-assured', 'ship', 'captain', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'who', 'survivors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'safe', 'ballroom', 'waterproof', 'air', 'tight', 'clear', 'signal', 'folks', 'are', 'former', 'big', 'city', 'mayor', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'overprotective', 'father', 'Jennifer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'who', 'love', 'hunk', 'Christian', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'Rounding', 'out', 'roster', 'characters', 'are', 'obnoxious', 'passenger', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'waiter', 'who', 'guide', 'ship', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'pretty', 'stowaway', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'Dylan', 'Johns', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'gambler', 'who', 'living', 'playing', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'cruise', 'ships.Dylan', 'apparent', 'main', 'character', 'musters', 'little', 'group', 'together', 'sorts', 'danger', 'hopeful', 'attempt', 'reach', 'bottom', 'now', 'top', 'ship', 'safety', 'Navigating', 'narrow', 'passageways', 'elevator', 'shafts', 'air', 'ducts', 'ballast', 'tanks', 'tough', 'going', 'fears', 'tensions', 'mount', 'never', 'real', 'concern', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'hand', 'simply', 'picked', 'off', 'ravages', 'water', 'fire', 'heavy', 'machinery.Like', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'III', 'Poseidon', 'surprises', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'considerably', 'more', 'collective', 'price', 'tag', 'talent', 'Digital', 'technology', 'anything', 'possible', 'are', 'point', 'when', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'blown', 'away', 'obviously', 'digitally-rendered', 'shot', 'opening', 'uninterrupted', 'shot', 'Poseidon', 'example', 'camera', 'ship', 'starboard', 'side', 'water', 'level', 'up', 'bow', 'ship', 'port', 'where', 'deck', 'level', 'glides', 'back', 'ship', 'jogging', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'then', 'overview', 'ship', 'winding', 'up', 'viewing', 'aft', 'Five', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'blown', 'audiences', 'away', 'Now', 'however', ""n't"", 'register', 'anything', 'special.What', 'missed', 'most', 'remake', 'aging', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'who', 'stole', 'original', 'film', 'scene', 'underwater', 'help', 'comrades', 'continue', 'escape', 'safety', 'No', 'longer', 'svelte', 'ingenue', 'Place', 'Sun', 'unashamedly', 'swam', 'whale', 'giving', 'new', 'meaning', 'service', 'call', 'duty', 'Poseidon', 'Lucas', 'Dylan', 'daredevil-like', 'water', 'blazing', 'coat', 'oil', 'more', 'dangerous', 'perhaps', 'Winters', 'feat', 'earlier', 'film', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Poseidon', 'more', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'big-screen', 'effort', 'second-tier', 'collection', 'actors', 'over-familiarity', 'make', 'hardly', 'adding', 'Must', 'See', 'list']",N/A
1006468,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000GRUMPU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 7]","What is it with Wolfgang Peterson and water?Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the newest entry in the Greed Won Over Better Judgement Awards... And the winner is ""Poseidon"".Directed by Wolfgang Peterson, ""Poseidon"" is a completely unnecessary film. And it isn't a very good unnecessary film. Made because they have no original ideas and better special effects to display those ideas, Warner Bros. clearly wanted (needed?) a popcorn film to fill the multiplexes over the weekend. Someone suggested the 1972 film ""The Poseidon Adventure"" deserved to be remade (stop laughing, it happened.) and they called on Wolfgang Peterson to hammer out a special effects and action extravaganza. Apparently, Peterson has been typecast as the `Water' director; after ""Das Boot"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and now ""Poseidon"", he is clearly the guy to go to if your story involves water and your actors will get wet.But why was ""Poseidon"" remade? The 1972 film is remembered for two reasons; the ship overturns and Shelly Winters in an evening dress crawling through small passageways. Last year, a television movie was made; this time, a terrorist's bomb causes the boat to capsize and one of the survivors is a Homeland Security agent. How timely. So why is this version hitting the multiplexes? Money and more money. Studios feel like they have to release two or three big budget ""tent poles"" every summer. These films cost a lot of money and will (hopefully) bring in a lot of money and ticket buyers. Sometimes, they hit it big (""Spiderman""), other times; they lose (""Poseidon""). Before these big films begin playing, the studio will get to show one or two previews for some of their other big summer offerings, trying to win potential ticket buyers. Before ""Mission Impossible III"", Paramount included a preview for ""Nacho Libre"", a film I suspect cost about a third of Tom Cruise's salary alone. Before ""Poseidon"", we saw trailers for ""The Lake House"", a new weepy romance starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock (probably cost about a third of ""Poseidon"") and ""Superman Returns"" (which probably cost more, a lot more.) So, long story long, it's all about economics. The studios would rather spend $120 million on a special effects filled offering rather than finance a dozen Wes Anderson or Woody Allen films.For those of you that don't know... The Poseidon, a luxury cruise ship, is traveling across the Atlantic on New Year's Eve. Just as the guests reach one in the countdown, a `rogue wave', as the Captain (Andre Braugher, in probably the most thankless role of the film) later explains, catches the ship broadside, causing it to flip upside down. Many people die, but the survivors include Dylan (Josh Lucas), a gambler and former Navy man who was never happier than when he was broke, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former fireman and the Mayor of New York and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), a [...] architect who is trying to get over a bad breakup. The group also includes a single mom (Jacinda Barrett) and her `adorable' little boy, Jennifer Ramsey (Emmy Rossum, the musical ""The Phantom of the Opera""), Richard's daughter and Christian (Mike Vogel), her boyfriend and new fianc&eacute;e. As soon as the ship capsizes, Dylan figures he can find a way out and this ragtag group of people follows him through various obstacles. Some of them will make it, some won't.Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell are both good actors and the only reason I can think of for their involvement is money. Why would they agree to make a film in water tanks, soaked to the bones during the entire day, when their characters have little, if any, character? This is the type of film where character development is done in quick, broad strokes. Anything we learn about them is learned through quick, off hand comments. ""I was never as happy as when I was broke"". ""May dad was Mayor of New York when I was young"". ""That must've been great."" ""It wasn't"". Basically, the only way a film like this will help their careers is if it is a huge hit. The film doesn't require them to act particularly well, so it all comes down to money. And because the film cost so much, the likelihood of a huge hit diminishes.There are many reasons for newcomers like Jacinda Barret, Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel and Freddy Rodriquez to appear in the film. Exposure, exposure and more exposure. They are at the point in their careers where any film will help, no matter how bad. Appearing in a multi-million dollar film of this sort can only help their careers. Who knows? It might even help them stay away from the slasher/ horror films so many actors of their age populate.Richard Dreyfuss? Just behind John Travolta for most career revivals, Dreyfuss' career could use a shot in the arm. Here he plays a [...] architect. You see, he's an architect so he can say things like ""This ship isn't designed to survive underwater."" Presumably, an architect knows about these things. But then again, wouldn't anyone? He seems to be a `[...]' architect to be merely pathetic. At one point, he calls his ex-lover and leaves a voice mail. ""I'm begging, aren't I?"" At another point, he calls Freddy Rodriguez's character gorgeous. This happens as they are trying to traverse an upside down elevator shaft. I guess this is why his character has an ex-lover.For a moment, I thought Kevin Dillon's character Lucky Lou had been transported intact from the 1972 original. His character is so laughably over the top you will also cheer when he dies.As the story progresses, the already spotty dialogue degenerates further as we get statements like ""There is no other way!"" or ""I can't do it."" ""Yes, you can."" ""The water is rising."" Yes, all serviceable, but because we know so little about the characters this dialogue only serves to make each person all the more two-dimensional.Yes, the special effects are impressive, when the ship is turning over, but after this point, the film looks like it was filmed in water tanks. The cast encounter a series of obstacles, all of which take place in closed, confined spaces. But because we know so little about the characters, it is difficult to care if they ever make it through the obstacle course alive.As in any disaster film, some of the recognizable faces will make it out alive, some won't. Some of the newer faces will make it out, some won't. But all will go on to appear in new movies and projects. Hopefully, much better new movies and projects.If ""Mission Impossible III"" represents the best a summer can offer, ""Poseidon"" represents the worst; a film made to showcase special effects with little attention to character or story.

1006469,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000GRUMPU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","The originalPoseidon Adventurewas Irwin Allen in his disaster film best...ensemble acting with a tragedy to work through. He worked that formula like no-one else...so when Wolfgang Petersen went to remake it, he did what he should have. He scrapped what Allen was magic at and inserted his own strength in their place. Which meant characters that might not be the most interesting, but working as a team to overcome the odds (thinkDas Boot).To that end, his ""Poseidon"" is a faster paced, tighter and shorter movie than Allen's and moves at such a tear that it's hard to notice when it falters. The cast is helmed by Kurt Russell (playing troubled macho as only he can), Josh Lucas (loner gambler subbing for Gene Hackman's loner priest) and Richard Dreyfuss (gay man just jilted by his ex for a younger man). Along with seven other survivors, this group must battle fire, water and the clock to climb up the ship to safety.Minus the 3-dimensional characters, Petersen gives us a 3-dimensional ship. The effects are a marvel (the bonus disc shows you just how few CGI effects were used) and the opening wave scene is visceral in its blunt force. The capsizing boat, with the ensuing death and the mayhem, will scare the saltwater out of you. Maybe even more so than some horror movies. Little time is wasted between survival episodes, although the nod to Shelly Winters' swim team dialog from the original is a nice touch. The survivors overcome obstacle after peril and each more tense than the last.There is, naturally, a happy ending. Just who makes it out and how is the fun of ""Poseidon.""

You couldn't ask for more action in a film than this.  Every second is filled with action, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.As for people complaining about bad acting, bad plot, etc, I'm just wondering if they saw this same movie I did or just making crap up. The acting was top notch in here.  Overall, the entire cast gave excellent performances, but  with the 2 main standouts being Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas.  They were perfect for the roles they played in this type of movie.  Whoever did the casting, I give you credit.  You really know how to pick your people.  Oh, and Richard Dreyfuss is getting really old yes, but he shows he can still do some heavy action stuff. And as for the plot,  yes, there is one.  A big giant wave crashes into a big ship,  people are hurt and killed, and a few try to find a way to escape, and they do.  There you go.  And what did you want, another Titanic, which runs about 3 hours long.  Heck no, I would think not.  This movie runs a good short 98 minutes, so you can't really complain about that.  The movie does not drag on, and gets to the action right away.So all in all, I highly recommend this action masterpiece to everyone who enjoys an awesome action movie filled with stunning visual effects and scenery.  You can really tell that the 140 million budget for this film was used all the way and was not a waste.  Great acting, great visual effects, great cast, great plot, overall GREAT!  Go see.

1006474,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000GRUMPU,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","The most predictable of last year's box-office bombs, Poseidon was always on a hiding to nothing: a remake of the much-loved but frankly not that good blockbuster that kickstarted the 70s disaster movie trend, arriving a year after a reviled TV miniseries version, showing all the signs of burning cash as it was rushed through production to meet a summer release date (it looks like it cost $80m but cost nearer twice as much despite the less than stellar cast) and coming in at a very slim 98-minutes (twelve of them credits) was always going to be facing too many negative waves. Perhaps someone at Warners should have remembered what happened the last time they boarded the Poseidon with Irwin Allen's disastrous sequel to the original, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, which sank with all hands. Naturally, this isn't anywhere near as bad.Always having been disappointed with the 1972 version, I must admit I didn't find this nearly as bad as others did and probably enjoyed it more despite its many obvious failings. To be fair the much-criticized lack of characterization isn't a major issue here since the wave hits at roughly the same point in the running time as the original, which relied on the audience identifying with recognisable stars in clich&eacute;d roles rather than quality writing, although it's a film that's in too much of a hurry to work as well as it could. The pacing definitely is a problem, with some scenes not allowed long enough to establish any real tension before amping up: it's definitely a film in a hurry, whether due to re-editing (not particularly readily apparent, to be fair) or a desire to give the film a sense of urgency. It's not one of Petersen's better jobs of direction - better than The Perfect Storm or Air Force One, not as good as Troy or Das Boot - and the CGI is variable - many of the most criticized shots are pretty decent, while it's often the explosions that convince the least - but it throws in a couple of surprises (including one surprisingly brutal moment in an elevator shaft), has a much better than expected supporting turn from Richard Dreyfuss who steals what few acting honors are going and is much more enjoyable than I was expecting.For a two-disc set, the extras are pretty light - aside from the 22-minute featurette and trailer on disc one, the extras on the second disc barely clock over an hour, with the half-hour documentary on Rogue Waves the clear winner.",3,Not quite the disaster you might expect,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2436,"['most', 'predictable', 'last', 'year', 'box-office', 'bombs', 'Poseidon', 'was', 'always', 'hiding', 'nothing', 'remake', 'much-loved', 'frankly', 'not', 'good', 'blockbuster', 'kickstarted', '70s', 'disaster', 'movie', 'trend', 'arriving', 'year', 'reviled', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'version', 'showing', 'signs', 'burning', 'cash', 'was', 'rushed', 'production', 'meet', 'summer', 'release', 'date', 'cost', '80m', 'cost', 'nearer', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'less', 'stellar', 'cast', 'coming', 'very', 'slim', '98-minutes', 'twelve', 'credits', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'facing', 'too', 'many', 'negative', 'waves', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'Warners', 'should', 'have', 'remembered', 'what', 'happened', 'last', 'time', 'boarded', 'Poseidon', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'disastrous', 'sequel', 'original', 'Beyond', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'sank', 'hands', 'Naturally', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'bad.Always', 'having', 'been', 'disappointed', '1972', 'version', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'others', 'did', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'many', 'obvious', 'failings', 'be', 'fair', 'much-criticized', 'lack', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'major', 'issue', 'here', 'wave', 'hits', 'roughly', 'same', 'point', 'running', 'time', 'original', 'relied', 'audience', 'identifying', 'recognisable', 'stars', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'roles', 'rather', 'quality', 'writing', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'hurry', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'pacing', 'definitely', 'problem', 'scenes', 'not', 'allowed', 'long', 'enough', 'establish', 'real', 'tension', 'amping', 'up', 'definitely', 'film', 'hurry', 'due', 're-editing', 'not', 'particularly', 'readily', 'apparent', 'be', 'fair', 'desire', 'give', 'film', 'sense', 'urgency', 'not', 'one', 'Petersen', 'better', 'jobs', 'direction', 'better', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Troy', 'Das', 'Boot', 'CGI', 'variable', 'many', 'most', 'criticized', 'shots', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'often', 'explosions', 'convince', 'least', 'couple', 'surprises', 'including', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'brutal', 'moment', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'supporting', 'turn', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'what', 'few', 'acting', 'honors', 'are', 'going', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'expecting.For', 'two-disc', 'set', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'light', 'aside', '22-minute', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'disc', 'one', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'barely', 'clock', 'hour', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'Rogue', 'clear', 'winner']",N/A

Realizing the boat is going to sink soon, they search for a way out of the ship by climbing through the now upside down vessel.  Waves of this size don't actually occur anywhere in the open sea, as waves generally only exist in shallow areas or directly on shorelines, but that doesn't really matter.  The reasoning behind the movie is secondary to the action and effects, which are in abundant supply.  It's really unfair to compare the effects of this movie to the original ""Poseidon Adventure"", which was filmed over 30 years prior, but honestly this remake is a lot more believable than the first film.  In the original, it was quite obvious that people were voluntarily throwing themselves sideways while the camera tilted at an angle - showcased by the fact that none of the chairs fell from the ceiling.  No such suspension of disbelief occurs in this film, where quite a deal of effort has been expended to convince the viewer that a ship is in fact turning upside down.  Barring the very beginning of the movie, in which everything has a far too bright look and it's obvious some sort of green screen is being utilized, the effects used throughout the film are on par with those seen in recent special effects extravaganzas such as the Lord of the Rings series or the new remake of King Kong.  One particular effect of note occurs when a giant engine plunges through an upside down ceiling, unleashing a huge stream of fuel which soon catches on fire.  A superbly done giant pillar or flame streams endlessly downward, seemingly preventing passage by the intrepid group of survivors bent on escaping the ship.There is really only one direct translation of character from the original, and that is the character of the little boy who has befriended the various crew members and has a working knowledge of the boat's layout.  Everyone else is at least slightly different from the original characters.  Kurt Russell plays a character based on Gene Hackman's role in the original.  While Kurt delivers his lines in a much different style, it's easy to see why he was cast as this particular character, as Hackman and Russell look almost identical in close up shots and have very similar mannerisms.  The characters presented are all very stereotypical of our age.  There is a young couple who obviously cannot die as they are in love, a sternly disapproving father who has to show everyone how much he is willing to sacrifice for his family, a selfish man who will of course realize the error of his ways and become a more well rounded individual, a love-lorn man who wants to kill himself, and then the obligatory cannon fodder characters who will be offed quite quickly by the sinking ship.  Thankfully, they are all less annoying the characters in the original film.  During the first movie, it was hard not to root for the bleak cold depths of the oceanic deep to just get it over with and kill the lady who wouldn't quit sobbing uncontrollably and hold the team back, or the woman who would just not stop trying to tell her husband to go on without her.  In the new version the viewer will never be so annoyed as to actually wish the death of any particular character.While lacking any kind of deep storytelling or characterization, Poseidon is a fun adventure, and worth at least viewing once.",4,"Entertaining, and more riveting than the original",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,4255,"['Poseidon', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'character', 'development', 'human', 'inspiration', 'thought', 'provoking', 'themes', 'social', 'commentary', 'anything', 'resembling', 'argument', 'point', 'are', 'summarily', 'ignored', 'favor', 'entertainment', 'more', 'visceral', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'Viewers', 'can', 'leave', 'brains', 'door', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'needed', 'here', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Poseidon', 'definitely', 'what', 'out', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'amazing', 'effects', 'entertained', 'story', 'Macguyver', 'style', 'survival', ""n't"", 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'great', 'movie', 'making', 'price', 'admission.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Poseidon', 'silly', 'simple', 'huge', 'wall', 'water', 'crashes', 'luxury', 'ship', 'out', 'sea', 'tipping', 'massive', 'boat', 'submerging', 'hapless', 'inhabitants', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'ignore', 'pleas', 'captain', 'remain', 'sealed', 'off', 'room', 'await', 'rescue', 'Realizing', 'boat', 'going', 'sink', 'soon', 'search', 'way', 'ship', 'climbing', 'now', 'upside', 'down', 'vessel', 'Waves', 'size', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'occur', 'anywhere', 'open', 'sea', 'waves', 'generally', 'only', 'exist', 'shallow', 'areas', 'directly', 'shorelines', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'reasoning', 'movie', 'secondary', 'action', 'effects', 'are', 'abundant', 'supply', 'really', 'unfair', 'compare', 'effects', 'movie', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'was', 'filmed', '30', 'years', 'prior', 'honestly', 'remake', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'first', 'film', 'original', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'people', 'were', 'voluntarily', 'throwing', 'sideways', 'camera', 'tilted', 'angle', 'showcased', 'fact', 'none', 'chairs', 'fell', 'ceiling', 'such', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'occurs', 'film', 'where', 'quite', 'deal', 'effort', 'been', 'expended', 'convince', 'viewer', 'ship', 'fact', 'turning', 'upside', 'down', 'Barring', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'everything', 'far', 'too', 'bright', 'look', 'obvious', 'sort', 'green', 'screen', 'being', 'utilized', 'effects', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'par', 'seen', 'recent', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganzas', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'series', 'new', 'remake', 'King', 'Kong', 'One', 'particular', 'effect', 'note', 'occurs', 'when', 'giant', 'engine', 'plunges', 'upside', 'down', 'ceiling', 'unleashing', 'huge', 'stream', 'fuel', 'soon', 'catches', 'fire', 'superbly', 'done', 'giant', 'pillar', 'flame', 'streams', 'endlessly', 'downward', 'seemingly', 'preventing', 'passage', 'intrepid', 'group', 'survivors', 'bent', 'escaping', 'ship.There', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'direct', 'translation', 'character', 'original', 'character', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'befriended', 'various', 'crew', 'members', 'working', 'knowledge', 'boat', 'layout', 'Everyone', 'else', 'least', 'slightly', 'different', 'original', 'characters', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'character', 'based', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'role', 'original', 'Kurt', 'lines', 'much', 'different', 'style', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'particular', 'character', 'Hackman', 'Russell', 'look', 'almost', 'identical', 'close', 'shots', 'have', 'very', 'similar', 'mannerisms', 'characters', 'presented', 'are', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'age', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'obviously', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'are', 'love', 'sternly', 'disapproving', 'father', 'who', 'show', 'everyone', 'how', 'much', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'family', 'selfish', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'course', 'realize', 'error', 'ways', 'become', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'individual', 'love-lorn', 'man', 'who', 'kill', 'then', 'obligatory', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'offed', 'quite', 'quickly', 'sinking', 'ship', 'Thankfully', 'are', 'less', 'annoying', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'bleak', 'cold', 'depths', 'oceanic', 'deep', 'just', 'get', 'kill', 'lady', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'quit', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'hold', 'team', 'back', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'just', 'not', 'stop', 'trying', 'tell', 'husband', 'go', 'new', 'version', 'viewer', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'so', 'annoyed', 'actually', 'wish', 'death', 'particular', 'character.While', 'lacking', 'kind', 'deep', 'storytelling', 'characterization', 'Poseidon', 'fun', 'adventure', 'worth', 'least', 'viewing', 'once']",N/A

It is all about the action baby! Hardly a moment goes by where you can relax enough to take a breath.Technically, this is an awesome presentation.

It is a hell of a lot of fun and a great way to make it through a bag or two of extra buttery microwave popcorn. To be sure.We are fans of the original Poseidon, and while that was a traditionally better film, I would have to say the new version is more entertaining in its own way.

1006481,A2H1P6O6MW2DE4,B000GRUMPU,WayneInSF,"[1, 1]","When I first heard back in early 2004 that Wolfgang Petersen was planning a remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" I was stoked. The 1972 film, starring Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters, holds a special place on my personal favorites list because it was the very first film my parents took me to see (at the local drive-in, no less). I was 6 years-old and what a flick! Imagine, at that age, watching a ship the size of the Queen Mary get struck by a rouge wave and turn upside down. It was amazing stuff!But while that film was considered a spectacle in its day (it was the top grossing film of 1973), the visuals have become dated and the performances are now labeled, fairly or unfairly, campy. Still, the Irwin Allen classic has become a guilty pleasure for loyal fans. Over the last several years many of those fans (myself included) have thought that, in the right hands, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from a remake.And in Mr. Petersen the producers found the perfect filmmaker. How could Warner Bros go wrong with the brilliant, visionary director of the claustrophobic classic ""Das Boot"" and the brilliant ""The Perfect Storm?"" Combine the best elements of those two films with the classic tour-de-force survival story originally told by Paul Gallico in his 1969 novel and a new movie could become a critical and box office success.So with much anticipation I headed to see ""Poseidon"" this past weekend. The long awaited remake is a tremendous spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire length of the movie.The story is well known to just about everybody. During New Years Eve celebrations aboard the S.S. Poseidon, a monster rogue wave comes out of nowhere, slams into the luxury liner, capsizing her and leaving a few survivors, led by Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, to try and find an escape from the upside down water trap.Petersen begins the film with one of the most stunning opening shots in the history of film: A 3-minute wrap-around of the grand luxury liner as she sails the Atlantic. What makes this scene so amazing is the fact that the ship doesn't really exist. The Poseidon is completely computer generated, yet when you see her up on that screen you can only be in awe. She is majestic and stately - and puts a certain James Cameron luxury liner to shame.We are then introduced to the main characters at a quick clip. Mark Protosevich's screenplay doesn't draw them very well, if at all. We learn very little about our travelers, and that misguided calculation bothers me. But, I'll speak to that in a moment. Because just as I was starting to let the lack of characterization bother me, the mighty Greek God of the Sea lashes out at our New Years revelers and spins their world upside down in a heart-pounding capsize sequence that bests the original's by a mile.From there it's non-stop, edge-of-your-seat, hair-raising action as our rag tag group of survivors fight their way up the dying ship to find an escape, battling water and obstacles and more water along the way. Petersen's brilliant direction (assisted by Klaus Badelt's nerve-racking score) on three scenes in particular will have you climbing the walls.The first involves a scene in which Richard Dreyfuss' character is faced with one of the most gut-wrenching decisions a human being would ever have to make. I could feel the audience collectively asking themselves ""God! What would I do?"" The second involves the group's ascent through an air vent. The claustrophobia in this scene is so intense if you're not climbing the walls then you need to have your head examined. The third involves a mother (played by Jacinda Barrett) and her son (Jimmy Bennett) and the rising waters. Mothers will be ready to pull their hair out during this segment.All of the action sequences are well done, but those three, spaced through out the movie, will leave you feeling exhausted...in a good way...as if it the cost of the ticket was money well spent.As with most well done disaster movies it's the action sequences and special effects that save ""Poseidon."" I recommend the movie highly and think that on my list of ""popcorn flicks"" this will join the original near the top. That is thanks in large part to Petersen, his computer and design crews, and a cast that did the best they could with the script they got.And it is that script where I find my sole disappointment. Why Warner Bros moved ahead with such a lackluster screenplay puzzles me. This had the chance to be a classic sea tale. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting ""Moby Dick,"" but Paul Gallico's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the consummate story of survival at sea. It is deep in character study; human nature complete with all of its flaws. It is dark and psychological and leaves the reader breathless.Unfortunately none of that transferred over in the 1972 film. When I read that Wolfgang Petersen would be at the helm of this new version I had high hopes that the dramatic human stories told in the Gallico novel would finally be told on the big screen. But it doesn't happen.Roger Ebert opined that he felt Petersen's heart wasn't in this film. I don't think that was it. To me it almost seems like Warner Bros wanted ""Poseidon"" in the can sooner rather than later and were willing to sacrifice a strong story in order to get the film on screens by May 12. As a result the film is awkwardly edited at times - as if there had been a script there, but that it was jettisoned and then a half-assed editing job done to plug the holes. It makes me wonder whether they purposefully threw away a potentially triumphant story for yet another piece of popcorn fluff.At this point it doesn't really matter, because the film is popcorn fluff. Mind you, it is well done, exciting, and thrilling popcorn fluff and I highly suggest you head to the theatre and give it a look. But, I just can't help but wonder ""what if?"" I'm afraid we'll never know, because it is highly doubtful that this story will be told again.",4,"Tremendous film, but with a missed opportunity",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,5985,"['When', 'first',

At age 10, i guess i saw enough 'Creature Feature' and what TV had to offer in order to make such a comparison.Since then, i have seen the original about 20 times, and each time, i do see, hear, and read between the lines more than what i saw during the previous viewing.Sometimes it does take more than one viewing to understand not only what the actors do on-screen, but what the director wanted you to see, or think, then you make your own conclusion.Now, on to the remake.I am one to not like remakes. At times, there are needs to remake an original film due to artistic mistakes, to update in order to include more gore, violence, bad language, etc. These elements sometimes hinders the mood of the original film. Take for instance 'House On Haunted Hill', '13 Ghosts', House Of Wax'. These films not only were updated, but were changed to a point where it bore almost nothing to the original, except it's core story, otherwise they played for more of the elements that made them repulsive.In the remake of 'The Poseidon Adventure', it did need an updating, mainly for the progress in the use of special effects, which were handled superbly. It took me awhile, like the previous critic listed here to get the nerve to see the remake. I was also kicking myself for not seeing it sooner, as i was blown away by the special effects.One must remember, the original film had actors that were all famous. The remade version had a few familiar faces, but to me the rest i did not know, which to me made the film better than the original since it didn't matter to me who died, as long as the the handful of survivors made it to where they were supposed to go, to the bottom of the ship in order to be rescued. Films like these will always have unfortunate deaths in order to move the story along, as this one has, but also, one must remember, this is only a film, and films do not have to be made to win academy awards, but to entertain, which this remake does, in abundance.The characters were developed just enough to care about them to a point, but was just enough to get the rest of the situation at hand when the wave hit, and the wave sure hits, and the action does not stop thereafter. In fact, there is rather little time from opening credits to the wave to get bored waiting.I gave the remake '5 stars' for the reasoning that all involved with the film did a job well done. Some, if not many who did not see the original should see this version first, just for the sake of seeing how far special effects has progressed from previous action films. Then, see the original, and see how the effects were at an age where effects were sometimes done in the camera, and manually, without CGI.Both versions are not to miss. As for the TV version of 'The Poseidon Adventure', well, i'd have to do another review on that one, but since it wasn't a great version, i will leave it up to others who may share my feelings.",5,WORTHY REMAKE,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,3531,"['10', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'original', 'version', ""'Poseidon"", 'Adventure', 'was', 'time', 'adventure', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'rather', 'routine', 'sometimes', 'unbelievable', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'masterful', 'work', 'made', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trite', 'film', 'piece', 'art.After', 'viewing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'audience', 'exploded', 'applause', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'viewer', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'character', 'life', 'struggle', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'demise', 'special', 'effects', 'superb', 'set', 'designs', 'i', 'also', 'joined', 'i', 'witnessed', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'age', '10', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'saw', 'enough', ""'Creature"", 'Feature', 'what', 'TV', 'had', 'offer', 'order', 'make', 'such', 'comparison.Since', 'then', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'original', '20', 'times', 'time', 'i', 'do', 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'lines', 'more', 'what', 'i', 'saw', 'previous', 'viewing.Sometimes', 'take', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'understand', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'actors', 'do', 'on-screen', 'what', 'director', 'wanted', 'see', 'think', 'then', 'make', 'own', 'conclusion.Now', 'remake.I', 'am', 'one', 'not', 'like', 'remakes', 'times', 'are', 'needs', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'due', 'artistic', 'mistakes', 'update', 'order', 'include', 'more', 'gore', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'etc', 'elements', 'sometimes', 'mood', 'original', 'film', 'Take', 'instance', ""'House"", 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Ghosts', 'House', 'Wax', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'updated', 'were', 'changed', 'point', 'where', 'bore', 'almost', 'nothing', 'original', 'core', 'story', 'otherwise', 'played', 'more', 'elements', 'made', 'repulsive.In', 'remake', ""'The"", 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'did', 'need', 'updating', 'mainly', 'progress', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'handled', 'superbly', 'took', 'awhile', 'previous', 'critic', 'listed', 'here', 'get', 'nerve', 'see', 'remake', 'was', 'also', 'kicking', 'not', 'seeing', 'sooner', 'i', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'special', 'effects.One', 'must', 'remember', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'actors', 'were', 'famous', 'remade', 'version', 'had', 'few', 'familiar', 'rest', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'made', 'film', 'better', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'died', 'as', 'long', 'handful', 'survivors', 'made', 'where', 'were', 'supposed', 'go', 'bottom', 'ship', 'order', 'be', 'rescued', 'Films', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'unfortunate', 'deaths', 'order', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'one', 'also', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'only', 'film', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'win', 'academy', 'awards', 'entertain', 'remake', 'abundance.The', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'just', 'enough', 'care', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'get', 'rest', 'situation', 'hand', 'when', 'wave', 'hit', 'wave', 'sure', 'hits', 'action', 'not', 'stop', 'thereafter', 'fact', 'rather', 'little', 'time', 'opening', 'credits', 'wave', 'get', 'bored', 'waiting.I', 'gave', 'remake', '5', 'stars', 'reasoning', 'involved', 'film', 'did', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'many', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'should', 'see', 'version', 'first', 'just', 'sake', 'seeing', 'how', 'far', 'special', 'effects', 'progressed', 'previous', 'action', 'films', 'Then', 'see', 'original', 'see', 'how', 'effects', 'were', 'age', 'where', 'effects', 'were', 'sometimes', 'done', 'camera', 'manually', 'CGI.Both', 'versions', 'are', 'not', 'miss', 'TV', 'version', ""'The"", 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'well', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'do', 'review', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'version', 'i', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'share', 'feelings']",N/A
