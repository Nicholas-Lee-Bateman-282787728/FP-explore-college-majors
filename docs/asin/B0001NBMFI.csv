Granted, it didn't have Mulder, but it went on just fine without him.Once again Agent Dogget &amp; Reyes carry the series, and if i may say so do just as good a job as Mulder &amp; Scully.The positives of this season: Further developement of Dogget &amp; Reyes, the return of Agent Harrison (albeit for only one episode), The Burt Reynolds episode, and the finale which sets up the next X-files movie (whenever it comes out). Their are a few good episodes mixed in here and there (audrey pauley, 4-d)The negatives are that the episodes seemed too similar. How many times was either reyes or dogget in the hospital in a bad kind of way? And i don't know if i would have gone the direction of the super soldier story, i wish they would have kept it just &quot;regular&quot; aliens like they did the first seven seasons. One thing pissed me off, As much as i love the Mulder character, i don't like David Duchovny, and he has a set of brass balls to include himself in the opening credits of the finale, he should be listed as a guest star if anything.The first few episodes of the season are confusing. Scully and Skinner seem too bitchy. And AD Kirsch seems to be the polar oposite of himself? They could have explained mulder leaving a little better. They drop AD Fullmer on us out of left field, but we see the tie in later in the season. I like Carey Elwes and hope he shows up in the next movie.One thing they should have done with the final, left in the Presdient Bush scene (available as a bonus on the last disk)that was awesome!Overall, it went out with a bang and i was very happy. I await the next movie to find out what happens to everyone. And real fans should too and stop bitching and complaining like a three year old girl with a stubbed toe",5,Mixed emotions...,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,1802,"['Ok', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'Granted', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mulder', 'went', 'just', 'fine', 'him.Once', 'again', 'Agent', 'Dogget', 'amp', 'Reyes', 'carry', 'series', 'i', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'Mulder', 'amp', 'Scully.The', 'positives', 'season', 'Further', 'developement', 'Dogget', 'amp', 'Reyes', 'return', 'Agent', 'Harrison', 'albeit', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'episode', 'finale', 'up', 'next', 'X-files', 'movie', 'whenever', 'out', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'mixed', 'here', 'there', 'audrey', 'pauley', '4-d', 'negatives', 'are', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'too', 'similar', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'reyes', 'dogget', 'hospital', 'bad', 'kind', 'way', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'direction', 'super', 'soldier', 'story', 'i', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'just', 'quot', 'regular', 'quot', 'aliens', 'did', 'first', 'seven', 'seasons', 'One', 'thing', 'pissed', 'off', 'As', 'much', 'i', 'love', 'Mulder', 'character', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'set', 'brass', 'balls', 'include', 'opening', 'credits', 'finale', 'should', 'be', 'listed', 'guest', 'star', 'anything.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'confusing', 'Scully', 'Skinner', 'seem', 'too', 'bitchy', 'AD', 'Kirsch', 'be', 'polar', 'oposite', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'mulder', 'leaving', 'little', 'better', 'drop', 'AD', 'Fullmer', 'left', 'field', 'see', 'tie', 'later', 'season', 'like', 'Carey', 'Elwes', 'hope', 'up', 'next', 'movie.One', 'thing', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'final', 'left', 'Presdient', 'Bush', 'scene', 'available', 'bonus', 'last', 'disk', 'was', 'awesome', 'Overall', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'await', 'next', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'everyone', 'real', 'fans', 'should', 'too', 'stop', 'bitching', 'complaining', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'stubbed', 'toe']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season
811510,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,B0001NBMFI,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[10, 14]","Season 9 was by far the least satisfying of all the X-Files seasons due to the formulaic and prosaic writing. Although Robert Patrick's Agent Doggett worked quite well in this series, I felt Annabeth Gish's Monica Reyes was very weak. She is a mediocre actress at best, insipid at worst. She served the series best as eye candy, as she was mostly seen in tight leather jackets and sleeveless blouses. She was mostly expressionless throughout the series and seems better suited to soap operas.Some very good episodes appeared, including &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; &quot;Release,&quot; and &quot;Sunshine Days.&quot; The final episode, &quot;The Truth,&quot; was a let down. The set-up, in a military Kangaroo court, was preposterous. The only good thing about the episode was the summation of all the confusing &quot;alien conspiracy/mythology&quot; episodes.David Duchovney was sorely missed throughout the season, but I would have preferred Doggett and Scully, as in season 8, than the insipid Reyes.The season is worth seeing to complete all the seasons, but it's not really a keeper.",3,The Bitter End,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1090,"['Season', '9', 'was', 'far', 'least', 'satisfying', 'X-Files', 'seasons', 'due', 'formulaic', 'prosaic', 'writing', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'series', 'felt', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'mediocre', 'actress', 'best', 'insipid', 'worst', 'served', 'series', 'best', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', 'mostly', 'seen', 'tight', 'leather', 'jackets', 'sleeveless', 'blouses', 'was', 'mostly', 'expressionless', 'series', 'better', 'suited', 'soap', 'operas.Some', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'appeared', 'including', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'quot', 'quot', 'Release', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'Days.', 'quot', 'final', 'episode', 'quot', 'Truth', 'quot', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'set-up', 'military', 'Kangaroo', 'court', 'was', 'preposterous', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'episode', 'was', 'summation', 'confusing', 'quot', 'conspiracy/mythology', 'quot', 'Duchovney', 'was', 'sorely', 'missed', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Doggett', 'Scully', 'season', '8', 'insipid', 'Reyes.The', 'season', 'worth', 'seeing', 'complete', 'seasons', 'not', 'really', 'keeper']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

This is precisely why I missed out on the episodes but when I brought the boxed set for season 9 I got a lot more than I expected.  Some of the episodes in Season 9 were very good, very suspenseful.  The first two, ""Nothing Important Happened Today"" were pretty good.  Lucy Lawless as a guest star was a nice touch.  I also enjoyed ""John Doe"" which is when John Doggett (Robert Patrick character) loses his memory while in Mexico.  It was very compelling to watch, as were ""TrustNo1"" and especially, ""Improbable.""  I think ""Improbable"" was by far the best because it was so hilarious.  Burt Reynolds was superb as a guest star.  He certainly gave the most memorable performance of the season.  Now, the worst episode, by far, is ""Jump the Shark.""  Very important characters are killed off in this episode.  I won't say which ones because I don't want to ruin the suspense but really, I don't know what the creators were thinking when they did this.  These characters didn't have to die.  They were great.  In fact, I think the X-Files could have continued without David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.  Sure, it wouldn't have been the same but Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish are terrific actors.  Combine that with good scripts, good producers, and good directors and we could've had X-Files running for maybe two or three more seasons.  Anyway, what's done is done.  All I can say is watch this if you don't mind the fact that David Duchovny is no longer a part of the regular cast.

Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...The X-Files (Season 9) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""Nothing Important Happened Today"" in which, despite returning to her position as an instructor at Quantico, Doggett enlists the help of Scully in investigating the murder of an EPA worker after the worker's car is forced off a bridge by a mysterious female hitchhiker... Other notable episodes from Season 9 include ""Provenance"" in which a conspiracy within the FBI attempts to hide from Scully newly discovered evidence concerning the African alien spacecraft, and ""Secrets of the X-Files"" in which the show utilizes clips from previous episodes to explain the origins and background of the characters on The X-Files with greater clarity...Below is a list of episodes included on The X-Files (Season 9) DVD:Episode 183 (Nothing Important Happened Today)Episode 184 (Nothing Important Happened Today II)Episode 185 (Demonicus)Episode 186 (4-D)Episode 187 (Lord of the Flies)Episode 188 (Trust No 1)Episode 189 (John Doe)Episode 190 (Hellbound)Episode 191 (Provenance)Episode 192 (Providence)Episode 193 (Audrey Pauley)Episode 194 (Underneath)Episode 195 (Improbable)Episode 196 (Scary Monsters)Episode 197 (Jump the Shark)Episode 198 (William)Episode 199 (Release)Episode 200 (Sunshine Days)Episode 201 (The Truth)The DVD Report",4,A unique and original TV drama series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3445,"['Nominated', '12', 'Golden', 'Globes', '61', 'Emmys', 'including', '4', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', 'X-Files', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'popular', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'Premiering', 'Fall', '1993', 'Fox', 'Network', 'home', 'popular', 'programs', 'such', 'Simpsons', '1989', 'King', 'Hill', '1997', 'X-Files', 'created', 'entire', 'fictional', 'world', 'conspiracies', 'secret', 'organizations', 'building', 'legion', 'fanatic', 'followers', 'devoted', 'series', 'Trekkies', 'are', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Creator', 'Cris', 'Carter', 'former', 'writer', 'numerous', 'TV', 'shows', 'late-80s/early-90s', 'Nanny', '1993', 'one', 'example', 'together', 'finest', 'aspects', 'suspense-laden', 'spy', 'novels', 'alien', 'science', 'fiction', 'result', 'one', 'top', 'sci-fi', 'franchises', 'ever', 'produced', 'spawning', 'own', 'line', 'merchandise', 'even', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', '1998', 'nine', 'successful', 'seasons', 'credit', 'X-Files', 'one', 'longest-running', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'television', 'history', 'X-Files', 'exploits', 'four', 'FBI', 'agents', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'series', 'unsolved', 'mysterious', 'cases', 'known', 'only', 'X-Files', 'FBI', 'special', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'are', 'primary', 'agents', 'investigating', 'unusual', 'cases', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'solved', 'conventional', 'investigatory', 'methods', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'particular', 'play', 'prominent', 'roles', 'series', 'partnership', 'friendship', 'two', 'develop', 'course', 'series', 'tone', 'investigations', 'paranormal', 'Scully', 'medical', 'doctor', 'playing', 'skeptic', 'Mulder', 'deeply', 'held', 'beliefs', 'widespread', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'alien', 'abductions', 'course', 'series', 'X-Files', 'wide-range', 'frightening', 'mysterious', 'subjects', 'killer', 'insects', 'secret', 'world', 'government', 'organizations', 'colonization', 'Earth', 'parasitic', 'aliens', 'so', 'doing', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'original', 'blend', 'creativity', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'X-Files', 'Season', '9', 'DVD', 'number', 'suspense', 'riddled', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Nothing', 'Important', 'Happened', 'Today', 'returning', 'position', 'instructor', 'Quantico', 'Doggett', 'help', 'Scully', 'investigating', 'murder', 'EPA', 'worker', 'worker', 'car', 'forced', 'off', 'bridge', 'mysterious', 'female', 'hitchhiker', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '9', 'include', 'Provenance', 'conspiracy', 'FBI', 'attempts', 'hide', 'Scully', 'newly', 'discovered', 'evidence', 'concerning', 'African', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'Secrets', 'X-Files', 'show', 'utilizes', 'clips', 'previous', 'episodes', 'explain', 'origins', 'background', 'characters', 'X-Files', 'greater', 'clarity', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'X-Files', 'Season', '9', 'DVD', 'Episode', '183', 'Nothing', 'Important', 'Happened', 'Today', 'Episode', '184', 'Nothing', 'Important', 'Happened', 'Today', 'II', 'Episode', '185', 'Demonicus', 'Episode', '186', '4-D', 'Episode', '187', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Episode', '188', 'Trust', 'No', '1', 'Episode', '189', 'John', 'Doe', 'Episode', '190', 'Hellbound', 'Episode', '191', 'Provenance', 'Episode', '192', 'Providence', 'Episode', '193', 'Audrey', 'Pauley', 'Episode', '194', 'Underneath', 'Episode', '195', 'Improbable', 'Episode', '196', 'Scary', 'Monsters', 'Episode', '197', 'Jump', 'Shark', 'Episode', '198', 'William', 'Episode', '199', 'Release', 'Episode', '200', 'Sunshine', 'Days', 'Episode', '201', 'Truth', 'DVD', 'Report']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season
811514,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0001NBMFI,Busy Body,"[7, 8]","Coming to love The X-Files around Season 7, I was, obviously, somewhat of a latecomer of the sci-fi phenomenon. That doesn't mean I wasn't acquainted with it though. Everyone who wasn't living under a rock in the Nineties at least knew who Mulder and Scully were; the biggest TV icons of their generation. The success of this show was absolutely astronomical on a global scale, with hundreds of millions of devoted viewers every week from America to Japan, and England to Australia. I remember when the show started back in 1993 and I was only six years old. My dad went out on a Monday night with his friends, and my mum stayed in and watched The X-Files on the BBC. My sister and I were tucked up in bed as she watched religiously every week, as did the rest of the nation. At the show's peak, an average of 13 million people were watching this show in the UK alone! That's almost a quarter of the population, and absolutely unprecedented for a US Import.The show's ratings did, naturally, decline over time and by Season 9 the show was rescheduled to late night showings on BBC 2. Quite a fall from grace and such a terrible decline, right? Wrong. I approached Season 9 of the show with as much caution as I did Season 8, thinking it was going to be a dire season of bad writing, poor casting and boring plots. I was wrong. I admit, I let people's opinions influence me on this one, but those people tend to be the Mulder-philes who couldn't stand to see the show continue without him. Is The X-Files worse without Mulder? Yes. Is it bad altogether? No. Obviously, the show couldn't sustain the level of success it achieved with its first five seasons, because the episodes in there are the stuff of TV legend. Those episodes will still be being shown in 25 years from now.The X-Files had many fans of the romantic subplot between Mulder and Scully. I was one of them, because they are the perfect on-screen couple. The chemistry between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson is like electricity, and their love for each other surpasses any other on-screen partnership in my own opinion. But that doesn't mean the show can't continue without it. Sure it would have been better if Duchovny's ego hadn't inflated and he'd decided to stay on for the full nine years, but I think the show managed just fine without him.The mythology of Season 9 was definitely the weakest of the show's entire run in my opinion. The two-part opener ""Nothing Important Happened Today"" and ""Nothing Important Happened Today II"" was satisfying, but I felt they both dragged in places. We're used to action-packed season openers, and after the stunning finale to Season 8, I was expecting the same pace of tension. Lucy Lawless was superb as the Super Soldier, however, and she made this two-parter good on her own. I liked the idea of one Super Soldier hating what she was, and another revelling in it. The next mythology of the season was the two-parter ""Provenance"" and ""Providence,"" which was a superb addition to the series. These two episodes helped develop the story arc of Scully's baby William further and gave some great reasons as to why a UFO-cult wanted to kidnap the baby - not for evil, but for good. The aforementioned Super Soldiers story arc also helped play a role in these episodes, even if it did confuse viewers somewhat.""Trust No 1"" was one of my personal favourites from Season 9, and I suppose is classed as a mythology episode. In this episode, Scully encounters a woman who claims her baby is special like William. Together they must avoid the Super Soldiers. Scully's every move is being watched by one of these Super Soldiers, which leads to a terrifying climax at a quarry where Scully discovers the only thing that can kill them. The season finale ""The Truth"" is a satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest programmes in history. This isn't the best season finale I think the show has ever supplied (those accolades belong to ""Anasazi"" and ""Talitha Cumi"") but it's a very emotional and nostalgic episode. Mulder is on trial for murder of one of these so-called Super Soldiers in a military base. To get him off the hook, people from the past nine years help in his defence. This is really just an excuse to bring back old faces such as Alex Krycek, Marita Covarrubias, Agent X, Gibson Praise, The Lone Gunmen, Jeffrey Spender, and of course, the legend that is the Cigarette Smoking Man. Deputy Director Kersch and (the sexy) Brad Follmer add to the tension of this season finale. It does drag a bit for the first half an hour, but the desert scenes are amazing viewing and a real sense of the show having come first circle is achieved in my opinion.In my opinion there are some pretty amazing stand-alone episodes of this season. The first is ""Daemonicus,"" is which Doggett and Reyes investigate Satanic, ritualistic cult-like murders. It's a really scary episode, and very shocking at times. ""4D"" is a brilliant episode in which a man who can shape-shift between two alternate realities puts Doggett in critical condition. It's up to Reyes to solve the case. ""Lord Of The Flies"" divides fans, but I thought it was a really funny and light-hearted episode. ""John Doe"" is a great episode in which Doggett wakes up in the middle of New Mexico not remembering who he is, or how he got there. The only thing he can remember is having a son, which leads him to a man who can steals people's memories. ""Hellbound"" stands on its own as one of the single greatest episodes in the show's history! Doggett and Reyes investigate several victims who have been skinned alive. The shocking truth revealed near the end is that a group of people from more than 100 years ago are being reborn in different guises. It is their destiny to die through being skinned. It's too complicated to go into precise detail, but it's a very gripping episode.In ""Audrey Pauley,"" Reyes finds herself in an alternate dimension, in a hospital which is actually a doll's house, while her body lays in a coma after a car crash. It's up to Doggett to find a way to bring her back. ""Underneath"" is an average episode where a man is haunted by a killer after being released from prison, thirteen years after being wrongly-accused of murder. ""Improbable"" is a funny episode, starring Burt Reynolds, in which Reyes thinks she can solve a case by numeracy/probability. ""Scary Monsters"" was a superb episode in my opinion. It was a bit cheesy but it had many twists and turns. ""Jump The Shark"" was a sad episode as it saw the death of some very important people in the show, and the episode itself wasn't up to much. ""William"" was a great episode in which Scully realises she must give up her son to protect his life. ""Release"" is a brilliant episode where Doggett finally catches his son's killer, some nine years after he was abducted. It's an emotional episode and one of the most memorable of the season. The final stand-alone episode of the week is ""Sunshine Days,"" which was a bit of a mixed bag. The agents investigate the death of a man who was hoisted into the air before falling to earth, after entering a strange Brady Bunch-like household. A surreal episode, but rather pleasant.All in all I enjoyed Season 9 a lot more than I thought I would. Robert Patrick was seriously underrated as John Doggett, and it makes me wonder why he wasn't given a lead-role in the show earlier than Season 8. Many see Annabeth Gish as a wooden actress but she is so much more. She isn't as good as Gillian Anderson (who also outdid herself this season) but I still think she's a loveable actress.

But I still feel that the series could've ended with season 8 and gone into another movie to conclude the mythology.But since it didn't, we got a lackluster two-part season opener to conclude the two-part season finale of season 8. It was ok, but I felt let down a bit after how good season 8 was. And we also got an unsatisfactory conclusion to the underrated and cancelled ""The Lone Gunmen"" TV series in an X-files episode called ""Jump the Shark"": (...)Ok, I'd be fine with it if they'd make another movie where we actually get to see them beat the aliens. It doesn't have to be like Independence day or anything, but just have a similar concept in the sense that we have to ""fight the future"" and win. I think most X-Fans wanted to see Mulder receive justice for his beliefs since he was mocked throughout the entire series because of his belief in aliens, and also us winning against the aliens. But so far, the creators of The X-Files say that the next movie will be a stand-alone movie and not about the mythology (although I read recently that the person who played the alien bounty-hunter in the series is cast to be in the movie, so maybe they changed their minds). I'm sure it'll be a great movie, but I still think we need more conclusion to the alien mythology than what we got.Overall, this season was good, but not great.

811520,AE2KCASMQPMO,B0001NBMFI,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[12, 16]","Okay, Fox has managed to make me give five stars to the only season of The X-Files that I was ready to qualify under five stars (I was going to give it four stars). Mulder has left the series after the two parter finale of the eighth season, and we don't quite understand why. The season begins with ""Nothing Important happened today"" I and II, where we see Doggett trying to pursue his investigation on the odd events that unfolded in Existence: the meeting implicating Kersh with the human replacement/super soldier Knowle Rohrer and agent Crane. But he finds out that he's been left alone by his former partner (agent Scully, now on full mommy duty) and Skinner. Monica Reyes is his only help... and then there is Lucy Lawless, whose agenda is hard to understand. If things didn't look so troubling for poor Doggett, he has to face a new enemy: A.D. Brad Follmer, whose past relationship with Reyes makes him jealous of Doggett. And if you thought Scully's baby was normal and the aliens just found out that they had made a mistake (in Existence) and retrieve from him... well, the baby begins to move his circular moving toy with his thought. That's why Scully decides to help Doggett in the end. But, as usual for the series, by the end of the second episode, they don't really know much more that they knew before (which is a hell of an acomplish for a series after nine years). After these two episodes come two of the most interesting stand alones of the series: Daemonicus and 4-D. Scully is shown now giving class in Quantico. These two episodes set straight the emotional entanglements between the three main characters (how Doggett cares for Reyes and Scully, and how they perceive him). After that, the season loses the great pace with which it begins. ""Lord of the flies"" is an unsuccessfull effort to make one of those classic funny or humorous episodes of previous seasons (such as those from seasons 3,4 and 5). In ""Trust no1"" we find a Scully desperate to make contact with Mulder, but at the risk of being manipulated by those trying to find him. By this episode we discover that the human replacement are, after all, vulnerable to one thing. ""John Doe"" and ""Hellbound"" are two very normal and typical X-Files episodes. The real treat comes in the following disc, where a great two parte finds place: Provenance and Providence have to do with Scully's baby. A group of UFO cultists are after the little boy... and they get him. Oh! And after nine seasons, Mrs. Scully finds out in her own flesh how hard is her sister's job (only for a second, but it is interesting). ""Audrey Pauley"" is a bit too weird for and X-Files (if such a thing is even posible). Underneath is pretty much an average episode. Then comes ""Improbable""... okay this one is even weirder than Audrey Pauley! But it is well done... To this day I don't know quite well what to do with this episode... and it is a reason to treasure it. ""Scary Monsters"" is another normal episode about a boy whose claims of seeing monsters in his closet turn out to be true. We see Leila Harrison in this episode again, which is a nice (this time she has a boyfriend bringing dead things to Scully's kitchen table, where she makes little William's food!). The two extremes of the season follow: ""Jump the shark"" was the most disappointing episode of the season for me... I just felt like that was not a proper farewell to the Lone Gunmen. And ""William"" is a wonderfully achieved episode directed by David Duchovny! A man whose face has been terribly destroyed claims to be Mulder... but he could be someone else trying to approach baby William. ""Release"" is the closure to Doggett's arc: he discovers what happened to his son... I always thought that they should have left his story open; it seemed somewhat rushed and all over the place. ""Sunshine days"" is another not so great comedic episode. And finally: The Truth: the two hour series finale. Mulder has been imprisoned and is being accused of murdering Knowle Rohrer. Scully, Doggett, Reyes and Skinner come to his aid, as the military plan to judge him. We see Krycek, X, Marita, Gibson, the lone gunmen, and Spender again. But his is a trial meant to be lost. It is most remarkable the definitive demise of the Cigarrette Smoking man: I find it to be the image of the decade in T.V. My top 10 for the season are: 10.Hellbound  9.Nothing important happened today I  8.Underneath  7.Scary Monsters  6.Trust no1  5.Providence  4.Provenance  3.4-D  2.Daemonicus  1. The Truth.  It is remarkable how many extras FOX is planning to release with this package. It deserves it, after all, this was the series that got the whole tv to DVD to the success it has today as a trend. The image of the box looks wonderfull (I've seen it outside amazon's page) and the news about the extras concur with the number of discs of the package: seven! It includes the very well known 30 minute documentary about the overall season. But it has a 90 minute long making of The Truth, the DVDROM game ""The Truth"", deleted scenes, audio commentaries on The Truth, Improbable and Jump the shark, three more featurettes (okay featurette does not justice to these extras) of 45 and 20 minutes, two profiles (on Reyes and Follmer), footage of the celebration of the 200th episode and an on-location featurette of 15 minutes (the extras are detailed in a very well known page devote to tv shows to dvd). And it is cheaper than the previous seasons!!! This is really the way to go, FOX. Now, there is only one thing that could make me happier: the announcement of the second movie... but if the legacy of the series finishes here, I am truely pleased with the way it is sent to the future of uncountable repetitions.",5,Unbelievable amount of extras,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,5709,"['Okay', 'Fox', 'managed', 'make', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'season', 'X-Files', 'was',

In an attempt to make an extra buck, Chris Carter and his corporate goonba accomplices sacrificed content and continuity for series longevity, and in the end succeeded in tarnishing a one-of-a-kind program.I would love to know what kind of rationale was in play when those in charge decided to kill off some of the most important characters, thereby severing story lines, plots, and important character interdependencies that had been cultivated from the beginning. The Lone Gunmen, C.G.B. Spender (Cigarette Smoking Man), Krycek, and The Syndicate (to name a few) formed an impossible-to-replace group of characters, and I lost all respect for the show when these characters were eliminated and nothing of substance was created to take their place.Carter should have called it quits when Duchovny left, but no. What we have instead are two additional seasons that are total monstrosities and an insult to viewers who placed emotional stock in this show and its characters. Carter obviously had zero loyalty to the program's fans, otherwise he would never have made such a callous decision to ruin this show's legacy by tampering so radically with the storyline. What was left after the deed was done? Absolutely nothing.The series finale was perhaps the biggest disappointment in programming history. From the very first episode, the series revolved around an extraterrestrial storyline, and what did we get at the end and in return for all of our years of loyal viewing? We get Mulder and Scully sitting in a hotel room, reminiscing about old times, not knowing where to go or what to do next. And to top it all off, Carter always promised he would never entangle Mulder and Scully in any type of sexual intrigue, and what did he do during the last two seasons? You guessed it.It's been a long time since this series went off the air, but the greed and selfishness surrounding the production of the last two seasons, and in particular the last season, still resonates because this series did mean alot to so many people, myself included. Chris Carter is set for life, but he has lost my respect.

I was hooked on the stories, and fell in love with the characters of Mulder and Scully. I stayed with the series faithfully, saw ""Fight the Future"", the feature film, on opening night, and loved the way season 7 took up right where the film left off. Then along came season 8 & 9. I have to admit I didn't give it a chance, when I heard that Duchovny was basically gone except for a brief cameo here or there, and that Gillian Anderson's Agent Scully would basically be relegated to second fiddle status.....I gave up on the show without giving Agent's Doggett and Reyes a shot.Man did I cheat myself out of some really good TV.I just finished re-watching the entire series on DVD, and watched for the first time seasons 8 & 9. I just couldn't get over how great Robert Patrick was as Agent Doggett. I came to care about Doggett in his brief 2-seasons as much as I cared about Scully and Mulder.

Quon,"[0, 0]","Say what you will, but season 8 of &#34;The X-Files&#34; is pretty solid, interesting, and helped expand the series' mythos in a way that was refreshing and satisfying (even with Mulder missing through half of it). The same can not be said about the series' ninth season.I was willing to give it a try, seeing as how I have an open mind about the latter years of the show, but to be honest this season is horrid. The mythology episodes are turgid and boring (especially that stinker that is the two-part opener; the name -- &#34;Nothing Important Happened Today&#34; -- is too fitting), whereas the &#34;Monsters-of-the-Week&#34; that X-Philes have come to love are either too campy, boring, or just blame terrible.That being said, there are a few bright moments. John Doggett really shines in both &#34;4-D&#34; and &#34;John Doe&#34; (the latter of which is sort of a MOTW spin on the season four episode &#34;Demons&#34;), whereas Monica Reyes (an otherwise major misstep) hits all the right notes in &#34;Aubrey Pauley&#34;.Unfortunately, the core of what we have all come to know and love about the &#34;X-Files&#34; is almost completely missing: Mulder and Scully. David Duchovny left for good in the ninth year, and Gillian Anderson cut back her time, meaning that the series' real main characters are mere echoes. Scully arrives on the scene now and then to give Doggett and Reyes some info or help with an autopsy or two, but other than that, she's mainly relegated to the (boring and offensively bad) mythology episodes. Mulder only appears in the two-part season/series finale where he gets tried &#34;Seinfeld&#34;-style.If you are an &#34;X-Files&#34; collector like myself, I'd recommend getting this season (preferably used). If you're just a casual fan, I'd by-pass it. It's only really note-worthy because its the last season.

(Which was alot).Basically, The X Files should have had the greatest and most enthralling ending of any television show in history, and any film. What we ended up with was something so depressing that you regret not switching off early and starting afresh on Sunset Beach.Oh man!The X files will always be remembered, and I can garuantee that the final two seasons (and seven to an extent) will in time be forgotton. Anyone out there who disagrees was obviously never an X Files fan in the first place, or is just a very stupid person.There is frankly so much to criticise about the way that The X Files turned out, that it frankly isn't worth going in to.Goodbye X Files.

811537,A169CPBR76SEF1,B0001NBMFI,Ian K. Hughes,"[44, 48]","The 9th (and final) season of THE X FILES (2001-02) stands, along with Season 6, as the most consistent of all the years filmed in Los Angeles and exhibits a number of unique qualities.First and foremost, the loss of David Duchovny's participation created the necessity to play off (as in Season 8) his absence. While the (not insignificant) feeling of contrivance concerning yet another Mulder disappearance was unfortunate, the writers made full creative use of this (business related) circumstance. Specifically, through scripts (mostly ""stand alone"") that fleshed out new characters (Agents John Doggett & Monica Reyes) and through the mythology arc, in which themes from the previous year (and the series as a whole) were developed.Secondly, the show regained a sense of equilibrium, its structure a throwback to the Vancouver years, where the (uniformly interesting) ""mythology"" episodes were aired at specific points: early, mid, and late season. This well-planned strategy mitigated the effect of some of the more routine ""stand alone"" efforts while moving inexorably towards a conclusion illuminating much of Chris Carter's ""underground project"".STAND ALONE EPISODES:There were several efforts by writers ( relatively ) new to THE X FILES:An ambitious attempt to marry characterization to storyline appears in two of Steven Meada's scripts: both ""4-D"" and ""Audrey Pauley"" share similar sci-fi plots against a backdrop of (implied) romantic affection shared by Agents Doggett and Reyes. ""Audrey Pauley"" in particular, benefits from excellent writing as well as fine performances from the principles (esp Annabeth Gish) and guests (the actress playing Audrey was previously seen in the 3rd Season masterpiece ""Oubliette"").Writer Thomas Schnauz also turned in two scripts: ""Lord of the Flies"" (the season's only overtly comedic take) is a clever but at times strained affair. The main attraction is really for diehard X-philes, since the episode is full of playful allusions to writer Darin Morgan's classic 3rd season script ""War of the Copraphages"". More effective is Schnauz' ""Scary Monsters""; while its surface story is purposely borrowed from THE TWILIGHT ZONE, the whimsical ""Mulder vs Doggett"" subplot is a fun spoof. Agent Scully's impromptu ""kitchen autopsy"" is also a great bit, harkening back to the classic comedy of the series' golden years.Three more scripts, in what could be termed the ""Exorcist File"" vein, were seen in Season 9:""Daemonicus"" (written & directed by Frank Spotnitz) features some eerily creative camera work and a ""Hannibal Lechter"" type villain while adding further details to the character of Agent Doggett. The graphically violent ""Hellbound"" outlines writer David Amann's deliberately odd theological juxtaposition: Calvinist predestination and Buddhist reincarnation. John Shiban's ""Underneath"" is a disaster; easily the worst episode of the season.Chris Carter wrote and directed the superb ""Improbable"", the latest in a long line of quirkily humerous yet serious scripts (a la Darin Morgan) that deal with perennial philosophical issues (free will/determinism good/evil, et al ). The episode features an excellent performance by Burt Reynolds; the brilliantly shot street scenes (and music) are a Carterian homage to Italian ""cinema dell'arte"".Longtime staff writer Vince Gilligan's two contributions are mixed affairs: the sepia-tone cinematography of ""John Doe"", coupled with Robert Patrick's fine acting make this episode enjoyable up until the oddly strained ""crash and bang"" finale. ""Sunshine Days"" is one of Gilligan's rare missteps; a re-tread of his ""Je Souhaite"" (Season 7) with an unfortunate undercurrent of saccharine sentimentality.The ongoing subplot (treated in various episodes of Seasons 8-9) relating to Agent Doggett's personal tragedy was resolved in ""Release"" ( particularly beautiful music by Mark Snow ). It is a testament to the quality of THE X FILES that in their last season the staff writers (John Shiban & David Amann) would prepare so properly respectful a vehicle for Robert Patrick, whose performances were so vitally important for the series in its final years.""Jump the Shark"" was neither the best nor worst treatment that could have been prepared as the swan song of the beloved Lone Gunmen. However flawed the script, the heroic efforts of the three misfits in this episode were a necessary correction to the idiotic mischaracterization that shot through the (mercifully short-lived) series (Spring 2001) that bore their name. In ""Jump the Shark"" some of the eccentric nobility of the Lone Gunmen was restored.MYTHOLOGY EPISODES:The symbiotic partnership between Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz continued with their co-writing of 6 of the 7 myth arc episodes airing in Season 9 (the finale was penned by Carter alone).The ambitious 2-part opener (""Nothing Important Happened Today I/II"") fuses the familiar ""alien hybrid"" concept with the newer (logically consistent) element of ""supersoldiers"".The Orwellian/Kafkaesque atmosphere of ""Trust No1"" is a compellingly well-framed continuation of the myth arc as well as a dark commentary on certain governmental strictures enacted in the wake of 9/11.An extraordinary degree of openly religious (Christian) symbolism (in terms of plot, dialogue and cinematography) pervades the mid season 2-parter titled ""Provenance/Providence"".""William"" is taut episode creatively directed (and co-written) by David Duchovny; the clever double twist ending has dramatic ramifications that extend backward and forward in time. Gillian Anderson puts forth a customarily moving performance emphasizing Scully's unique qualities of nobility and loving self-sacrifice.The grand 2 hour finale (""The Truth"") exudes a special glow, starting out (""in media res"") with the return of Mulder, lagging a bit during the lengthy court-room trial scenes and ending with a fireworks flourish in which director Kim Manners pulls out all the stops. The final scene of THE X FILES is a quiet coda; a truly beautiful moment between Mulder and Scully as they share their mutual belief that, in spite of all appearances, hope is not lost and that ""the light shines in the darkness"" .",4,the light shines in the darkness,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,6170,"['9th', 'final', 'season', 'THE', 'X', 'FILES', '2001-02', 'Season', '6', 'most', 'consistent',

The stand-alones were a welcome change from many of the two prior years' awful ones.  ""4-D"" and ""Release"" are some of the series' best, and show how good the show could be when it avoided Mulder, the baby, and even Scully's irritating motherly concerns.It is the show's central arc, its mythology, in which the writers prove to be out of ideas.  No longer able to create interest by revealing anything new, they were unable to write interesting stories.  Instead, the characters moved through the dramatic motions in so formulaic a manner, lacking clear motivations, while the stories lacked real plot;  scenes and dialogue felt stretched out on purpose.  The mythology had become a caricature of itself, employing mystifying dialogue and pointless confrontation to put nothing substantial across, but to serve as ends in themselves.  The opening two-parter is the most blatant example of this, but so are ""Trust No 1"" and the February sweeps ""Providence"" and ""Provenance"".  Only the finale held interesting dialogue and genuinely interesting drama, but even it seemed a shadow of what the show was able to do before the sixth season two-parter that killed off the most fascinating participants to the conspiracy:  the syndicate.",3,"Standalones get better, but Mythology falls flat.",1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,1489,"['Firstly', 'many', 'fans', 'feel', 'Doggett', 'added', 'nice', 'touch', 'show', 'especially', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'drama', 'was', 'getting', 'highly', 'repetitive', 'one', 'flaws', 'long-running', 'series', 'however', 'talented', 'writers', 'themes', 'grow', 'repetitive', 'stand-alones', 'were', 'welcome', 'change', 'many', 'two', 'prior', 'years', 'awful', 'ones', '4-D', 'Release', 'are', 'series', 'best', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'avoided', 'Mulder', 'baby', 'even', 'Scully', 'irritating', 'motherly', 'concerns.It', 'show', 'central', 'arc', 'mythology', 'writers', 'prove', 'be', 'ideas', 'No', 'longer', 'able', 'create', 'interest', 'revealing', 'anything', 'new', 'were', 'unable', 'write', 'interesting', 'stories', 'Instead', 'characters', 'moved', 'dramatic', 'motions', 'so', 'formulaic', 'manner', 'lacking', 'clear', 'motivations', 'stories', 'lacked', 'real', 'plot', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'stretched', 'out', 'purpose', 'mythology', 'had', 'become', 'caricature', 'employing', 'mystifying', 'dialogue', 'pointless', 'confrontation', 'put', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'across', 'serve', 'ends', 'opening', 'two-parter', 'most', 'blatant', 'example', 'so', 'are', 'Trust', '1', 'February', 'Providence', 'Provenance', 'Only', 'finale', 'held', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'drama', 'even', 'seemed', 'shadow', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'sixth', 'season', 'two-parter', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'fascinating', 'participants', 'conspiracy', 'syndicate']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

Even so, it is still better than most other shows of its era. Mulder's absence led to more development in the characters of Doggett, Reyes, and the introduction of Brad Follmer, and Lucy Lawless in the incredible role of Shannon McMahon. The mythology episodes are excellent, especially the sequels to the episodes &quot;Biogenesis, The Sixth Extinction, and The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati,&quot; which are called &quot;Providence,&quot; and &quot;Promenance.&quot; The crossover Lone Gunmen episode &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; ties up the loose ends from that series, and Burt Reynolds is hillarious in &quot;Improbable.&quot; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a funny spoof of &quot;Jackass.&quot; &quot;The Truth&quot; nicely wraps up the show, and throughout the season, old characters return and some die.

While Robert Patrick who has been accused of single handily killing the X-Files is fine as Agent Doggett. How is that he gets the blame from the fans any way. Isn't it more of David Duchovny's fault if anything ? I mean, he made some small appearances in the 8th season but here he only makes one in the Series finale. He made a big deal over money issues, when is he on the street begging for money with his wife T&eacute;a Leoni ? No. Duchovny as a regular would have made it a more solid last season. If not as a regular, he could have at least made more than just one appearance this season. Trying to throw answers together for us in one episode with him in the end just wasn't enough.Anyone who took Duchovny's place had a big task ahead of them and Patrick does as well as he could have. While Annabeth Gish wasn't as bad of an addition to the cast as his partner Monica Reyes as fans have tried to say. They both do fine work. It's the writing I think that was the problem. I mean although Gish isn't bad, she wasn't needed. Especially since they have feelings for each other and can't be together because of certain reasons. That's all familiar territory. It doesn't help that Reyes has the same hair cut as Scully even if she has a different hair color. After fans being used to just Mulder and Scully working together on the X-Files. I could see how it could be a little hard for fans to get used to having another male and female team working together on it.This season still had more life to it than the recent movie though. It's dark but it at least has the humor we came to love as well. That's no where to be seen in the movie. Patrick does better work this season than I think he did in season 8 as well. The two episodes that he really stands out in is one where he loses his memory in Mexico and another where he finally may have found who killed his son. In some episodes it's not Patrick's fault if he has too many scenes where he's complaining to Skinner or Scully about being out of the loop.There's also strong appearances in this season by Terry O'Quinn ""who makes his 3 appearance in the X-Files if you count the movie"", Carey Elwes as the new assistant director and a former lover of Monica's, Adam Baldwin as a super soldier and Michael Emerson, ""Ben in Lost"". Emerson is in a silly episode where he's a lonely man who imagines the Brady Bunch to spend time with him. Despite being silly, it's an effective episode due to Emerson's performance. It also has a touching moment. Still, I'm not sure if it was a worthy last episode before the finale. Sadly, it is more memorable than it though.",4,It's Really Not That Bad,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2712,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'last', 'season', 'as', 'bad', 'fans', 'have', 'said', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'told', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'single', 'handily', 'killing', 'X-Files', 'fine', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'How', 'blame', 'fans', 'way', ""n't"", 'more', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'fault', 'anything', 'mean', 'made', 'small', 'appearances', '8th', 'season', 'here', 'only', 'one', 'Series', 'finale', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'money', 'issues', 'when', 'street', 'begging', 'money', 'wife', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'No', 'Duchovny', 'regular', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'solid', 'last', 'season', 'not', 'regular', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'made', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'appearance', 'season', 'Trying', 'throw', 'answers', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough.Anyone', 'who', 'took', 'Duchovny', 'place', 'had', 'big', 'task', 'ahead', 'Patrick', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'addition', 'cast', 'partner', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'fans', 'have', 'tried', 'say', 'do', 'fine', 'work', 'writing', 'think', 'was', 'problem', 'mean', 'Gish', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'Especially', 'have', 'feelings', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'certain', 'reasons', 'familiar', 'territory', ""n't"", 'help', 'Reyes', 'same', 'hair', 'cut', 'Scully', 'even', 'different', 'hair', 'color', 'fans', 'being', 'used', 'just', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'working', 'together', 'X-Files', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'fans', 'get', 'used', 'having', 'male', 'female', 'team', 'working', 'together', 'it.This', 'season', 'still', 'had', 'more', 'life', 'recent', 'movie', 'dark', 'least', 'humor', 'came', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'better', 'work', 'season', 'think', 'did', 'season', '8', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'episodes', 'really', 'out', 'one', 'where', 'memory', 'Mexico', 'where', 'finally', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'who', 'killed', 'son', 'episodes', 'not', 'Patrick', 'fault', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'complaining', 'Skinner', 'Scully', 'being', 'loop.There', 'also', 'strong', 'appearances', 'season', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'who', '3', 'appearance', 'X-Files', 'count', 'movie', 'Carey', 'Elwes', 'new', 'assistant', 'director', 'former', 'lover', 'Monica', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'super', 'soldier', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'Ben', 'Lost', 'Emerson', 'silly', 'episode', 'where', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'spend', 'time', 'being', 'silly', 'effective', 'episode', 'due', 'Emerson', 'performance', 'also', 'touching', 'moment', 'Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'worthy', 'last', 'episode', 'finale', 'Sadly', 'more', 'memorable']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

The fact that Mulder maintained a strong presence at the end of season 8 and dissapeared at the season premier of season 9 was a dissapointment, no questions.  Cary Elwes appearing as a character is an interesting angle, but a little unrealized as he unfortunately does not really make all that many appearances.  Fortunately, we get at least one return to the comedy genre with the episode Improbable.  This was something I missed in season 8.  I believe this season is a bit of a let-down, but only for those who don't enjoy the X-Files.  I think if you're a dedicated fan, you'll still enjoy this season.

811546,A10872FHIJAKKD,B0001NBMFI,Just Bill,"[69, 78]","Thanks to only catching a few episodes on TV when it aired -- not to mention the plethora of negative reviews -- I was all set to dislike Season 9 of The X-Files when I sat down to watch it from start to finish.But I can't. No way.Season 9 is actually quite good. A few episodes in particular are superb. &quot;Release,&quot; for example, the episode in which Agent Doggett learns the truth about his son's death and puts the past behind him. My wife and I were stunned by that episode. It had &quot;Wow Factor&quot; written all over it. Great acting by Robert Patrick. Intriguing story line.The final episode (titled &quot;The Truth&quot;) was only so-so when I watched it on TV. But that was because I hadn't seen the rest of the season (or Seasons 7 and 8 leading up to it) in context. When I watched all of Season 9 back to back, I discovered &quot;The Truth&quot; to be a powerful way to end the series. It was great to have Fox Mulder back, but -- to be honest -- we didn't really consider the show to be about Mulder any more.Blasphemy? Am I do for a tarring and feathering?Don't think so. True, The X-Files started out as a show about Mulder and his partner Dana Scully. And the show endeared itself to millions of fans worldwide because of that pairing.But when David Duchovny (Mulder) left the show at the end of Season 7, just appeared in a handful of episodes in Season 8, and only appeared in the final episode of Season 9, the show changed. But not necessarily for the worse. The other characters stepped up to the plate. Doggett and Monica Reyes were fascinating characters. Each brought depth and strength to the roles.The X-Files was a show about the unexplained, the paranormal, the out-there-ness of Truth. As such, it was a show that was constantly filled with surprises, twists, turns and even dead-ends.When people get hung up on keeping the show exactly the same -- with Mulder and Scully in every episode -- they fail to see the point of the series: the unexpected.If the show would have gone downhill without Mulder, *then* I could see justification for all the bellyaching. But it didn't. The writers and directors rose to the challenge. Season 8 is one of the best of the series, in my opinion. And Season 9 is far from the worst.One thing we noticed, however: there was a distinct lack of character continuity from episode to episode. Plus, it seems like one or the other of Doggett and Reyes was always hovering on the brink of death -- with the healthy partner watching, praying and hoping for a complete recovery. When the recovery happened, emotions ran high. It seemed like things would change. But, in the very next episode the characters were back to the way they were before the crisis.In other words, when Reyes almost died in the hospital, Doggett was in tears. He felt deep emotion -- far beyond that felt for a partner in the FBI -- and couldn't wait until she recovered to tell her. But when she recovered, he didn't. Nothing changed.Those kinds of inconsistencies hampered Season 9. If the writers were true to the characters, changes would have occured from crisis to crisis. They would have siezed the opportunity to get more involved emotionally.Ditto for the episode in which Scully has to give up William for adoption. In that episode, she's racked with emotion. Yet, in the very next episode, she's composed and emotion-free. Like the adoption never happened. How is that possible? Scully lived for William in virtually every episode. Yet in the very next one after she gives him up for adoption, she doesn't shed a tear and, if memory serves, doesn't even mention him.As large as those kinds of character consistencies seem, I don't think they completely derail Season 9. The build-up to the end -- combined with a few truly stellar episodes -- make Season 9 well worth having if you're an X-Files fan.Oh, and let's not forget the bonus material. Two full DVDs of bonus material -- including a wonderful behind-the-scenes peek at the making of &quot;The Truth.&quot;My advice? Don't listen to the naysayers who slam Season 9 and call it the worst. There really isn't a &quot;worst&quot; when it comes to The X-Files.

811547,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0001NBMFI,Kenji Fujishima,"[7, 8]","The ninth and final season of THE X-FILES is easily the least of the nine. There are still some good episodes here and there, but most of the good ones are the standalone one-offs, the ones that have nothing to do with the Supersoldier and savior-baby stories that served as the mythological arc of the season.By this point, it became clear that the mythology was running on fumes, that it was being stretched taut even though the original vast alien conspiracy seemed to have been resolved by Season 6, and subsequent loose ends tied up by Season 7. I would almost be willing to concede that maybe---MAYBE---the whole idea of a secret program to repopulate Earth with Supersoldiers might have truly gone somewhere had Chris Carter and company been allowed to develop it further in another season. But I doubt it; the air of staleness would probably remain.So it's not that the episodes themselves are terrible. ""Provenance"" and ""Providence""---which sees the return of those rubbings that led Mulder to nearly go mad towards the end of Season 6 and the beginning of Season 7---certainly have their moments, and at least ""Nothing Important Happened Today"" has the freshness of discovery to recommend it---the freshness of seeing how new X-Files agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) handle their new assignment. It's just that, at this point, the mythology has clearly been played out, and, as hard as Chris Carter tries to breathe new life into it...let's face it, the paranoia toward the government that the early seasons of ""The X-Files"" were able to touch upon became old hat at about the show's midway point (Season 5).But, when it comes to ""The X-Files,"" I'm always a pretty optimistic fan, and, as always with this show, there are some fine standalone episodes to make Season 9 possibly worth a look. My personal favorite is ""4-D"" for the following reason: the episode may well be the ""X-Files"" version of Clint Eastwood's recent MILLION DOLLAR BABY! Yeah, I know the episode was made maybe three years before Eastwood made his award-winning picture, but some of the parallels are uncanny, especially with Reyes being forced to make a decision as to whether to listen to a paralyzed Doggett and pull the plug. By itself, though, it's a pretty good, interesting episode, which involves a serial killer who can somehow walk into different dimensions to act out his sick fantasies. There are other notables: ""Daemonicus,"" ""Hellbound,"" ""John Doe,"" ""Underneath,"" ""Scary Monsters."" Season 9 also contains some stabs at the kind of humor and sentimentality---qualities which were basically absent in Season 8---that characterized Seasons 6 & 7; unfortunately, episodes like ""Improbable"" and ""Sunshine Days"" turn out to be the lesser efforts of the season. ""Improbable"" was written and directed by Chris Carter, and it's a thoroughly bizarre effort, with special guest star Burt Reynolds playing---well, playing someone who may well be God Himself. It's interesting, to say the least, but ultimately I thought it was a failure. And Vince Gilligan's ""Sunshine Days"" is not one of his finer episodes; its descent into bathos reminds you of Season 6's ""The Rain King""---not necessarily a good reminder for most fans. On the other hand, the episode does show flashes of the kind of chemistry between Doggett and Reyes that weren't always in abundance in the rest of the season.Doggett and Reyes are perhaps the two most controversial points about Season 9. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish, I think, did as well as anyone could with their parts. If you found Patrick rather one-note in Season 8, watch Season 9's ""John Doe"" and marvel at the range of emotions he shows in playing a Doggett who has had his memory removed. As for Gish...well, she's no Gillian Anderson (who was at least a good trouper throughout Season 9, and brought her typical emotional warmth to the show), but she has her moments (see ""Hellbound"" and ""Audrey Pauley""). Unfortunately, both actors are hampered by writers who didn't really bother to make Doggett and Reyes nearly as interesting as Mulder and Scully were in the show's first 7 seasons. If there are those that feel that Doggett and Reyes didn't show much personality, I don't think it's necessarily the fault of the actors; the writers apparently didn't find them compelling enough to shade the characters in either.All this leads up to the finale, ""The Truth,"" in which Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), after disappearing again (out of his own free will this time), resurfaces, accused of murder. He is put on trial for his life---a trial that he believes is a trial about the truth that he and Scully have been looking for for years. Opinions range regarding this series finale. Some were disappointed that the centerpiece trial was basically a glorified clip show (a la the sitcom SEINFELD); others were perhaps more disappointed at how it all ended (continuing Chris Carter's obsession with frustrating the audience). Still, overall I thought it was a decent finale. The trial sequences, at the very least, summed up the mythology in a reasonably satisfying way, and the episode's final scene once again loyal fans that the characters were just as important to the vision of THE X-FILES as the creepy, freaky, and paranoid intrigue. The ending really does produce a feeling of the end of an era.Thus closes a 9-year chapter of groundbreaking television on THE X-FILES. After abandoning the show during its initial run during Season 7, it has been fun to rediscover the show from the beginning all the way to the end. This is a generally excellent television show that, even at its worst, still provides some of the smartest thrills and chills you'll ever see on TV---and, for me, not even Season 9, which is easily the least of the nine seasons, can diminish the achievements of this show. If it's not necessarily as essential as the show's first 7 seasons, Season 9 is still perhaps worth a look.",3,"Easily the least of the 9 seasons, though still has its moments",1124409600,"08 19,

I do not.Although the show is primarily based on the character of Mulder, there is no reason to end it, just because David Duchovny feels bored. As much as I like him, I have to say that I like Robert Patrick and the character of Doggett just as much if not even more. Annabeth Gish also is brilliant as Reyes, so there's no moaning there, too. Think about this: If things were reversed, and Patrick/Gish had started the show and were now to be replaced by Duchovny/Anderson, I believe that the fans' discomfort could be even greater!So what you have here is yet another very-well thought-through season with great episodes and a strong leading cast, keeping the integrity of the story (=not getting even more illogic than already at some times...) and delivering a great final year, which honestly deserved another one or two years with the new cast. So I can only hope that Mr Carter also incorporates Doggett and Reyes into the upcoming feature film along with Mulder & Scully, since it would be more than unfair and just plain stupid to leave them out. They were and are great characters and actors, and no bad ratings, no bad reviews and no smart remarks are going to change that!Every true X-Phile can embrace this season without any hesitation, it marks the end of a TV-legend that the world had not seen before!",5,"Extravagant season, without a doubt!",1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1450,"['Many', 'people', 'choose', 'hate', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'new', 'leading', 'ensemble', 'Duchovny', 'leaving', 'show', 'do', 'show', 'primarily', 'based', 'character', 'Mulder', 'reason', 'end', 'just', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'feels', 'bored', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'character', 'Doggett', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Reyes', 'moaning', 'there', 'too', 'Think', 'things', 'were', 'reversed', 'Patrick/Gish', 'had', 'started', 'show', 'were', 'now', 'be', 'replaced', 'Duchovny/Anderson', 'believe', 'fans', 'discomfort', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'greater', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'yet', 'very-well', 'thought-through', 'season', 'great', 'episodes', 'strong', 'leading', 'cast', 'keeping', 'integrity', 'story', 'getting', 'even', 'more', 'illogic', 'already', 'times', 'delivering', 'great', 'final', 'year', 'honestly', 'deserved', 'one', 'two', 'years', 'new', 'cast', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Mr', 'Carter', 'also', 'Doggett', 'Reyes', 'upcoming', 'feature', 'film', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'unfair', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'leave', 'out', 'were', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'actors', 'bad', 'ratings', 'bad', 'reviews', 'smart', 'remarks', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'true', 'X-Phile', 'can', 'embrace', 'season', 'hesitation', 'end', 'TV-legend', 'world', 'had', 'not', 'seen']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

811550,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001NBMFI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","I have now watched the entire nine season run of ""The X-Files"" from start to finish on DVD and my primary reaction to the final season was that it was not Mulder that I missed for most of these last 20 episodes but Scully.  Gillian Anderson's character is in most of these season nine episodes, but far too often she comes a bit unglued regarding her absent former partner.  Granted, we have enjoyed every one of Scully's emotional outbursts throughout the years, but the explosions strike me as being excessive.  When Scully is forced to play the true believer opposite the skepticism of Doggett, in the more mundane cases investigated this final season, things are fine.  All things considered, the episodes that focus on Agent John Doggett (e.g., ""John Doe,"" ""Underneath,"" ""Release"") are the most interesting in the ninth season.As the final season begins Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has once again disappeared, but this time of his own choice since he knows his presence is putting Scully and their son William in danger.  Agent Doggett (Robert Patrick) is trying to find Muldar (""Nothing Important Happened Today"") as part of his investigation of Deputy Director Kersh (James Pickens Jr.), but Scully and Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) finally convince him to drop the matter.  Scully is now teaching at the FBI Academy, helping Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) from time to time, but fully aware that William is in danger.  It is William's fate, even more than Mulder's disappearance, that defines the arc of this final season.While watching these episodes again, at midnight each night, I found myself wondering if the season could have been stronger if not only Mulder but also Scully had been jettisoned and the season had been about agents Doggett and Reyes.  As a general rule in the final seasons I intended to enjoy the standalone investigations (e.g, ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""Scary Monsters""), than those that focus on the show's mythology (e.g., ""Provenance,"" ""Providence"").  The final season is a mix of episodes where one week the focus is primarily on Reyes (""Audrey Pauley"") and the next almost entirely on Doggett (""John Doe"").  Sometimes Dogget and Reyes work together (""Daemonicus"") and then again it could be Reyes and Scully (""Hellbound""), or maybe all three (""Underneath""). Things are clearly progressing more quickly with Doggett and Reyes on the romantic front (""4-D,"" ""Release""), but then you would be hard pressed to name a couple that took longer to be a couple than Mulder and Scully.  In the comedy department that standout episodes is clearly ""Improbable,"" which features Bert Reynolds as a checker-playing God (Einstein always said God did not play dice with the universe, but he never excluded any board games).With one exception, the twisted Brady Bunch tale ""Sunshine Days,"" the final episodes that aired are all about tying up lose ends.  ""Jump the Shark"" becomes the final ride of the Lone Gunmen, ""William"" finds Scully reaching a fateful decision regarding her son, and the best of the bunch, ""Release"" brings closure to the unsolved murder of Doggett's son.  ""The Truth,"" the double-episode finale, proves to be unsatisfying, but I think expectations were so exceedingly high that it was impossible for fans to view the end with anything other than regret.  I like the final fade out, but the trial of Mulder is clearly a mockery, which means we are treading water for most of the story until the big finish because nothing that happens there matters.  There is a big bang near the end, but the saga of Mulder and Scully really ends with silence and a set up that will allow Chris Carter and the gang to do anything they want with the planned second ""X-Files"" movie.  Final Note: It would be my recommendation that you watch all of ""The Lone Gunman"" episodes before or concurrently with ""The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season,"" so that you end you ""X-Files"" experience with ""The Truth"" and not watching ""Jump the Shark"" a second time.",4,"Tying up the loose ends at the end of the run of ""The X-Files""",1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3994,"['have', 'now', 'watched', 'entire', 'nine', 'season', 'run', 'X-Files', 'start', 'finish', 'DVD', 'primary', 'reaction', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'Mulder', 'missed', 'most', 'last', '20', 'episodes', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'character', 'most', 'season', 'nine', 'episodes', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'bit', 'unglued', 'regarding', 'absent', 'former', 'partner', 'Granted', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Scully', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'years', 'explosions', 'strike', 'being', 'excessive', 'When', 'Scully', 'forced', 'play', 'true', 'believer', 'skepticism', 'Doggett', 'more', 'mundane', 'cases', 'investigated', 'final', 'season', 'things', 'are', 'fine', 'things', 'considered', 'episodes', 'focus', 'Agent', 'John', 'Doggett', 'e.g.', 'John', 'Doe', 'Underneath', 'Release', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'ninth', 'season.As', 'final', 'season', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'once', 'again', 'disappeared', 'time', 'own', 'choice', 'presence', 'putting', 'Scully', 'son', 'William', 'danger', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'trying', 'find', 'Muldar', 'Nothing', 'Important', 'Happened', 'Today', 'part', 'investigation', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Kersh', 'James', 'Pickens', 'Jr.', 'Scully', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Skinner', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'finally', 'convince', 'drop', 'matter', 'Scully', 'now', 'teaching', 'FBI', 'Academy', 'helping', 'Doggett', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'time', 'time', 'fully', 'aware', 'William', 'danger', 'William', 'fate', 'even', 'more', 'Mulder', 'disappearance', 'arc', 'final', 'season.While', 'watching', 'episodes', 'again', 'midnight', 'night', 'found', 'wondering', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'not', 'only', 'Mulder', 'also', 'Scully', 'had', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'agents', 'Doggett', 'Reyes', 'general', 'rule', 'final', 'seasons', 'intended', 'enjoy', 'standalone', 'investigations', 'e.g', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Scary', 'Monsters', 'focus', 'show', 'mythology', 'e.g.', 'Provenance', 'Providence', 'final', 'season', 'mix', 'episodes', 'where', 'one', 'week', 'focus', 'primarily', 'Reyes', 'Audrey', 'Pauley', 'next', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Doggett', 'John', 'Doe', 'Dogget', 'Reyes', 'work', 'together', 'Daemonicus', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'Reyes', 'Scully', 'Hellbound', 'maybe', 'three', 'Underneath', 'Things', 'are', 'clearly', 'progressing', 'more', 'quickly', 'Doggett', 'Reyes', 'romantic', 'front', '4-D', 'Release', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'name', 'couple', 'took', 'longer', 'be', 'couple', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'comedy', 'department', 'standout', 'episodes', 'clearly', 'Improbable', 'Bert', 'Reynolds', 'checker-playing', 'God', 'Einstein', 'always', 'said', 'God', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'dice', 'universe', 'never', 'excluded', 'board', 'games', '.With', 'one', 'exception', 'twisted', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'tale', 'Sunshine', 'Days', 'final', 'episodes', 'aired', 'are', 'tying', 'up', 'lose', 'ends', 'Jump', 'Shark', 'final', 'ride', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'William', 'Scully', 'reaching', 'fateful', 'decision', 'regarding', 'son', 'best', 'bunch', 'Release', 'closure', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'Doggett', 'son', 'Truth', 'double-episode', 'finale', 'be', 'unsatisfying', 'think', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'was', 'impossible', 'fans', 'view', 'end', 'anything', 'other', 'regret', 'final', 'fade', 'trial', 'Mulder', 'clearly', 'mockery', 'are', 'treading', 'water', 'most', 'story', 'big', 'finish', 'nothing', 'matters', 'big', 'bang', 'end', 'saga', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'really', 'silence', 'set', 'up', 'will', 'allow', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'gang', 'do', 'anything', 'want', 'planned', 'second', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'Final', 'Note', 'would', 'be', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'Lone', 'Gunman', 'concurrently', 'X-Files', 'Complete', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'end', 'X-Files', 'experience', 'Truth', 'not', 'watching', 'Jump', 'Shark', 'second', 'time']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

811552,A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM,B0001NBMFI,Lee,"[83, 93]","Sure, the ninth and final season of The X-Files was its weakest season, but The X-Files at its worst is much better than most TV shows out there today. This season retained excpetionally high production values and looking back, actually had some standout episodes, including the spectacular 2-hour finale that could never satisfactorily wrap up such a long-running series but did have a feel of the classic mythology episodes from the show's glory days.This season tries to pass the baton to Agents Doggett and Reyes, a partnership that is very solid but would never have the appeal of Mulder and Scully. I think Doggett is a very underrated character. Robert Patrick is truly excellent in the role, he's a great actor and makes the character his own. Scully is present all season but is relegated to an advisory role, only really stepping into the spotlight near the end of the season.David Duchovny's return for the 2-hour finale isn't handled perfectly, but it's so satisfying to see David and Gillian together on screen that you can all but forgive the fact that he left.The DVD presentation is simply superb, as we have come to expect from this show. Spread over 7 discs as opposed to the 6-disc sets of recent seasons, this set has fantastic extras. The real gem on this set is the hour long documentary, The Making of The Truth. Ever since the show started I've wanted to see something like this. It takes you into the production meetings, location scouts and then the production itself, and it gives you a real sense of how hard working every member of the crew was and how much they loved working on it. It's an extremely thorough making of, not the usual puff-piece you see on DVDs.Another little treat is ""Reflections on The X-Files"", in which various guest stars discuss in new interviews what it was like to be a part of the show. Cher, Seth Green, Ed Asner, the Dust Brothers, Burt Reynolds are some of the participants.Other behind the scenes documentaries include Secrets of The X-Files and More Secrets of The X-Files, two shallow 45-minute shows from the heydey of the show. Nothing special but they do take you back to when the show was omnipresent. Also included are the usual promo spots, and a couple of decent new documentaries on Season 9 as a whole and also ""Reflections on The Truth"", which features key crew members talking about working on the last episodes. It's nice that the show's editors get a voice here.There are a couple of commentaries, one from Chris Carter on the episode ""Improbable"". They're interesting and frank.One thing I cannot forgive about this season is the fact that even though the show's producers knew this was the last season well before the end, they did not use the last, say, 5 or 6 episodes to wrap up the show. Instead they wrapped up a couple of plot points quickly in one (good) episode (directed by David Duchovny), and then give us some mediocre stand alone episodes. And the biggest slap in the face is that the penultimate episode ever is wasted on a silly story involving the Brady Bunch. Oh well, too late now. The show has passed up so many opportunities for true geatness in its nine-year run, but like I said before, it remains one of the best TV shows ever.It feels great to put this up there with the previous eight seasons and see the entire collection on one shelf. It's hard not to get all warm and fuzzy inside knowing you own every episode of this groundbreaking series. And you can't argue with the price for this beautiful set!",5,"Not The X-Files' best, but still better than most TV.",1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,3506,"['Sure', 'ninth', 'final', 'season', 'X-Files', 'was', 'weakest', 'season', 'X-Files', 'worst', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'TV', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'season', 'retained', 'excpetionally', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'looking', 'back', 'actually', 'had', 'standout', 'episodes', 'including', 'spectacular', '2-hour', 'finale', 'could', 'never', 'satisfactorily', 'wrap', 'up', 'such', 'long-running', 'series', 'did', 'have', 'feel', 'classic', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'show', 'glory', 'days.This', 'season', 'tries', 'pass', 'baton', 'Agents', 'Doggett', 'Reyes', 'partnership', 'very', 'solid', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'appeal', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'think', 'Doggett', 'very', 'underrated', 'character', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'truly', 'excellent', 'role', 'great', 'actor', 'character', 'own', 'Scully', 'present', 'season', 'relegated', 'advisory', 'role', 'only', 'really', 'stepping', 'spotlight', 'end', 'season.David', 'Duchovny', 'return', '2-hour', 'finale', ""n't"", 'handled', 'perfectly', 'so', 'satisfying', 'see', 'David', 'Gillian', 'together', 'screen', 'can', 'forgive', 'fact', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'simply', 'superb', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'show', 'Spread', '7', 'discs', 'opposed', '6-disc', 'sets', 'recent', 'seasons', 'set', 'fantastic', 'extras', 'real', 'gem', 'set', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'Making', 'Truth', 'Ever', 'show', 'started', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'production', 'meetings', 'location', 'scouts', 'then', 'production', 'real', 'sense', 'how', 'hard', 'working', 'member', 'crew', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'working', 'extremely', 'thorough', 'making', 'not', 'usual', 'puff-piece', 'see', 'DVDs.Another', 'little', 'treat', 'Reflections', 'X-Files', 'various', 'guest', 'stars', 'discuss', 'new', 'interviews', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'part', 'show', 'Cher', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Dust', 'Brothers', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'participants.Other', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'include', 'Secrets', 'X-Files', 'More', 'Secrets', 'X-Files', 'two', 'shallow', '45-minute', 'shows', 'heydey', 'show', 'Nothing', 'special', 'do', 'take', 'back', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'omnipresent', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'usual', 'promo', 'spots', 'couple', 'decent', 'new', 'documentaries', 'Season', '9', 'whole', 'also', 'Reflections', 'Truth', 'key', 'crew', 'members', 'talking', 'working', 'last', 'episodes', 'nice', 'show', 'editors', 'get', 'voice', 'are', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'one', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'episode', 'Improbable', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'frank.One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'season', 'fact', 'even', 'show', 'producers', 'knew', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'well', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'last', 'say', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'wrap', 'up', 'show', 'Instead', 'wrapped', 'up', 'couple', 'plot', 'points', 'quickly', 'one', 'good', 'episode', 'directed', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'then', 'give', 'mediocre', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'biggest', 'slap', 'face', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'ever', 'wasted', 'silly', 'story', 'involving', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Oh', 'well', 'too', 'late', 'now', 'show', 'passed', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'true', 'geatness', 'nine-year', 'run', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever.It', 'feels', 'great', 'put', 'there', 'previous', 'eight', 'seasons', 'see', 'entire', 'collection', 'one', 'shelf', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'knowing', 'own', 'episode', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'price', 'beautiful', 'set']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season

But... as time went on Dogget realized he was not just a FBI agent but an X-files FBI agent. He and Reyes won me over. They were a team and not better than Mulder and Sculley but great in their own right. There is no doubt the series could have gone another year but the traditional X-files fans apaprently did not truly accept the NEW TEAM, and maybe the series had gone on too long. All I know is I was addicted to the X-files for many reasons. I never really had the time to sit down on Sundays and watch the show every week but when I did It was great. I liked the X-files because each episode was like a mini movie, not a weekly series. I hope they make another movie and Patrick and Gish are in in this time. They should have been in the last one. If you really understand the X-files then you know that the episodes just didn't follow in lock step, there was always a side track-like the last movie, then they would get back in line with the E.T stuff.

Sure, I would have liked to see Mulder, but I was satisfied enough with Dogget and Reyes.I found the overall story to be annoying. Someone dies, but no, he's not dead. He then dies again, but no wait, he's not dead. After a while, I stopped caring whenever someone died or ended up in a coma. However, this wasn't limited to just season 9.The only thing I really cared about was when the Lone Gunman died. Those were probably the only deaths in the series that bummed me out. And that's only because we saw their funeral and knew they weren't coming back. Had we not seen the funeral, I wouldn't have cared since I would have expected them to miraculously come back to life somehow.I didn't like the story of Scully's miracle baby, Mulder's disappearance (though I'm sure the series could have survived without him...though maybe with not such a huge following), the super soldiers, and the alien bounty hunters. This isn't the X-Files from the early days that I came to like. I realize there were probably good reasons for changing the scope of the series, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.I really liked the early seasons where they were regular FBI agents who investigated the unknown. I must admit, I felt the series needed an overall story.  Well, I got what I wanted and was very unsatisfied. I still think the overall story would have worked, had they done things differently.  I liked the recent movie ""I want to Believe"", but I really don't think it fixed any of the problems from season 9. If there's a future movie, I hope they make it more like ""Fight the Future"" and attempt to give season 9 some closure. For example, whatever happened to agents Dogget and Reyes? That's going to take some serious effort, but that's why these people make millions, right?Season 9 is definitely worth watching if you are a big X-Files fan.  However, if you are trying to cut back on TV time or aren't a big fan, don't bother watching. If you didn't like season 8, you'll probably like this one less.One more thing, Amazon didn't send me the ""Slim set"" for seasons 8 or 9.

David Duchovny was gone for good, and after Gillian Anderson announced this would be her last season on the show, it hardly came as a surprise that the show was soon canceled.  Before that announcement hit though, you could tell that a transition was being made that would have made Agents John Dogget (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) the focus point of the show.  Mitch Pileggi's A.D. Skinner finally became a full time cast member as well as he is featured in the opening credits for the first time.  The 2-parter season premiere ""Nothing Important Happened Today"" is lacking, but it seems that there would have been more of a developing story arc that would have carried over to another season and added more to an already overbloated mythos.  That aside, standout episodes of season nine include ""4-D"", ""Provenance/Providance"", ""Audrey Pauly"", ""Jump the Shark"", ""William"", and the series finale ""The Truth"" where David Duchovny returns to end the series in a special two hour episode.  The series finale is decent, but it could have been so much more, and even though Mulder and Scully end up together, there are purposely left loose ends that could lead up to a hinted to X-Files feature film in the near future.

811561,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B0001NBMFI,OverTheMoon,"[4, 10]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1X-Files: Season 9 is a problem. The way to solve this problem is easy. Stop with Season 7. If you enjoy watching good TV seasons then stop at 7. If you are an X Files fan and want to complete things then fine but you know what is happening and if not here goes. Duchovny has left the show but appears for only a few episodes between Seasons 8 and 9 and when he does turn up it's not worth it. Now we know that Dogget is the Mulder replacement, but what Season 8 didn't tell you was that Reyes was the Scully replacement. So Season 9 is mostly Dogget and Reyes investigating something. The stories are all mostly terrible and a chore to sit through. It is like the writers and producers have lost all heart. In fact X Files Season 8 should never have been called the X Files. A better title for this would be Dogget and Reyes Season 2.The show develops the new introductory credit sequence. There are a few versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. Some have Skinner, others don't. It is mostly Scully, Dogget and Reyes but looks can be deceiving... and they are because Scully is in like 5% of the show if she is in the credits.So Agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) replaces Mulder. Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) practically replaces Scully. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) leaves his lead role from Season 8 and virtually vanishes from this Season. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back for one or two episodes. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) isn't really heard of. Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) has a episode or two but make no mistake about it, this is all Dogget and Reyes.Season 9 of the X-Files is mostly about - water, satanic murders, skinning, serial killers, flies, Mexico, looking for Mulder, more serial killers, crashed saucers, kid's imaginations, near death experiences, numerology, the Lone Gunmen, profiling, disfigurement, psychokinesis and finally... the truth .It's bad. I cannot see how anyone who has sat through the amazing stories that were Seasons 1 to 7 could like, let alone recommend, it. What is there good to say about it? Duchovny was the X Files. They don't even try to tie loose ends up. Even the double episode `The truth' doesn't reveal anything you haven't already heard before and ends in a cliff-hanger that has never been answered and probably never will. The producers are trying to sell us a different show under the banner of the X Files and didn't even have the courtesy to give us a decent Mulder/Scully ending. To top it off the episodes are a slog to get through and lots of them will insult your intelligence. This isn't just a bad season of the X Files... this is a catastrophe that many wish they never sat through, including me. It may well be the worst TV season for any series that I own. I think anyone who throws out boxes 8 and 9 from their X Files collection is rightly justified in doing so.If you think I am wrong, then we can discuss it. Use the comments box below. I will respond :)",1,Deceptive and misleading train wreck with little Scully and practically zero Mulder,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,6512,"['X-Files', 'Collection', 'worthy', 'hobby', 'next', 'Star',

811563,A1DDDTSZJL6M2I,B0001NBMFI,"Paul HItch ""HItchy""","[2, 3]","Hi there, thanks for reading.I found it hard not to like season Nine.The majority of it reminded me of season 8 in that many of the stories were stand out, the characters continued to develop, while some of the more confusing episodes were still very enjoyable.Doggett picked up where he left of last season, still a very no nonsense person, strong and putting his own mark on the "" X- Files"" .I really liked Reyes this season. For the most part she too developed. I found the partnership to be excellent, very refreshing, tying in excellently with Scully who now works at Quantico, and who is being referred to often during the season for her medical expertise.Scully seems also to have much more emotion this season, and was not as lack-lustre as she appeared on odd occassions in season 8.A different approach to the ""X-Files ; which for the most part seemed to work for me.The only cringing point was the constant reference to "" Scully and Mulder"", particuarly half-way through the season. This was just not necessary, and for me spoiled the characters development.The openers double episodes continued the Super-soldier storylines and was extremely well done.I really liked the next episode too ""Demonicus"" with it's great camera work, special effects and music.4-D, while full of plot holes, was also thoroughly enjoyable."" Trust No 1 "" delivered once more with the super soldiers with a taut, well scripted thriller."" John Doe"" a ""Doggett"" episode, was a different spin as Doggett winds up with amnesia in Mexico. Another great episode.Other good stories for mine were the two part "" Provenance"" & "" Providence"".""Improbable"" was a delight with Burt Reynolds guest starring in an episode reminiscent of ""The Goldberg Variation"" from season seven, with elements of "" Humbug"" from season two.The music fitted the story perfectly.The low point for me was "" Lord of the flies"" which started well but quickly went downhill, despite the special effects. This was a story about a teenager who is actually some sort of insect or fly himself. Have the fast forward button handy on this one.""Jump the Shark "" was probably the saddest part of the season with "" The Lone Gunman"" making an improbable, unnessasary and badly written departure, making only a small appearance in the final episode "" The Truth"" as one of Mulders hallucinations.Overall, worth while watching how it all pans out, particuarly as there is still constant rumours of another X-File Movie.The X-Files in it's early years this is definitley not. However for those who enjoyed the darker season eight, and who appreciated the different approach to the story-lines would do well to give this season a chance.The pack also contains bonus discs which give us a look back on all the nine years of "" X-Files "" ( Worth the money alone for that! )There is enough here for several hours enjoyment.Thanks for reading!",4,Still some quality left in the X-Files!..

811564,A3BSRAFXWY7COC,B0001NBMFI,Pete,"[7, 9]","When I heard xfiles was going to continue after Mulder left I didn't see the point. The whole reason for the xfiles was because of Mulder. I also heard that Scully wouldn't be taking the lead as much in season 9 - which had me feeling pretty miffed. So I took a different take on the xfiles - rather than seeing it as a show with all cool characters gone I saw it as the xfiles having already ended and seeing who would take over the investigations etc.And I found this season to be pretty interesting. Maybe it's because I've always prefered the stand-alone episodes, rather than the conspiracy eps, but some of the single storylines marvelled in their originality. Three examples of this are Reyes (who's pretty damn cool in her own right) getting trapped in an alternate-reality dollhouse, an investigation of a boy who ""sees/fears"" monsters that appear to be killing those around him, and a man who turns his house into the brady bunch residence (with the power of his mind)! Pretty wacky storylines and just the ticket to enable a strong season of xfiles without Mulder.By the end of the season fans are not left without a guest appearance by Mulder and revelations on whats to come for our fbi characters. While I found the final episode a little dissapointing the accuracy and frequency of the return of some old friends and foes keeps the final episode of the season on the edge of your seat!Overall a surprisingly great season!",5,Surprisingly good!,1079827200,"03 21, 2004",2004,1436,"['When', 'heard', 'xfiles', 'was', 'going', 'continue', 'Mulder', 'left', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'whole', 'reason', 'xfiles', 'was', 'Mulder', 'also', 'heard', 'Scully', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'taking', 'lead', 'much', 'season', '9', 'had', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'miffed', 'took', 'different', 'take', 'xfiles', 'rather', 'seeing', 'show', 'cool', 'characters', 'gone', 'saw', 'xfiles', 'having', 'already', 'ended', 'seeing', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'investigations', 'etc.And', 'found', 'season', 'be', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'always', 'prefered', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'rather', 'conspiracy', 'single', 'storylines', 'marvelled', 'originality', 'Three', 'examples', 'are', 'Reyes', 'who', 'pretty', 'damn', 'cool', 'own', 'right', 'getting', 'trapped', 'alternate-reality', 'dollhouse', 'investigation', 'boy', 'who', 'sees/fears', 'monsters', 'appear', 'be', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'house', 'brady', 'bunch', 'residence', 'power', 'mind', 'Pretty', 'wacky', 'storylines', 'just', 'ticket', 'enable', 'strong', 'season', 'xfiles', 'Mulder.By', 'end', 'season', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'left', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Mulder', 'revelations', 'whats', 'come', 'fbi', 'characters', 'found', 'final', 'episode', 'little', 'dissapointing', 'accuracy', 'frequency', 'return', 'old', 'friends', 'foes', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'edge', 'seat', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'season']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season
811565,A27MCNZZI03RII,B0001NBMFI,Philip S,"[0, 0]","In the last season of the X-Files, we are treated to more of Agents Doggett and Reyes and less of Scully and even less of Mulder, who only returns for the series' 90 minute finale. The chemistry is still good between the leads, although Scully is relegated to more of a supporting character until the final few episodes.In terms of plot, while avoiding any spoilers, the show's creators manage to provide closure on a number of story lines, some satisfactorily and some not so much. The ending left me wanting a lot more, specifically with regard to Agents Doggett and Reyes who we've grown to care about. The two characters are not even given a proper goodbye and this is a shame, especially considering actor Robert Patrick's terrific work on the show. In summation, the series' finale felt rushed overall when I think of all that could have been done with it. The grand aspirations I had for the full-scale alien attack on earth, ever since I watched the show's first episode and was introduced into the wonderfully convoluted world of Carter's mythology, went completely unsatisfied. Hopefully, the still much-rumored third X-Files movie can close this chapter once and for all in a satisfying manner.For fans still wanting more, check out the The X-Files movie I Want To Believe, it picks up neatly where the show leaves off and provides some insight into the characters themselves.

811566,A3B1XRW9HIGYQB,B0001NBMFI,P. Woods,"[4, 4]","The X-files is probably one of my favourite shows. After each season, something seems to happen to them. With seasons 6 and 7 they be come a bit more comedic. Season 8 shows us a change in chracters with John Doggett. Season 8 also went back to its horror roots. Season 9 is more of the same as season 8, yet it is not as superior. Scully (Gillian Anderson) is reduced to a smaller role in this season. She now seems like a minor charcter, like Skinner. Agent Doggett and Agent Reyes are basically the new main charcters. John Doggett seemed to have a smaller role in season 8, but now he gets his time to shine. In my opinion he is a very misunderstood charcter and it great to watch. Agent Reyes is decent, she's not great, but she ain't too bad either. Annabeth Gish does a good job at playing her.The season opens up with 'Nothing important happened today' which is a two-parter. It is decent, and it gives us a bit more info about the new super-soldier story-line. Other mythology ones which follow are 'Trust no 1' which deals with Mulder's disappearence, which is quite an exciting episode. 'Provenance/Providence' is an OK episode which goes deep into the mysteries involving Scully's son William. 'Willaim' is another episode involving her son, and it also brings us back an old character.The stand-alone episodes are probably the best thing about the season. 'Scary monsters' is a personal favourite for me, which deals with a freaky little boy. 'Audrey Pauley' is an episode to do with Agent Reyes fighting for her life. 'Underneath' is a straight-ahead horror story which includes a bit of Agent Doggetts past. 'Improbable' is a fun episode in which Burt Reynolds stars as possibly god himself. 'Sunshine days' brings some of the comedy back into the show.Though, some stand-alones are quite bad. 'Lord of the flies' is very weak (you may already know that). 'Hellbound', while it's gruesome, it's just one of those episodes that I nearly fell asleep on. And '4-D', which dealt with a parallel dimension, wasn't as good as I expected.'The truth' is the last episode. If you want to see Mulder one last time, then see this. For me the episode is only OK. Mulder has been in hiding, and now he is being charged for the murder of Knowle Ruhrer, despite the fact that he can't die. For the first half of the episode is basically talks about the last nine years of mythology which seems a bit unnecessary. The episode revolves more around Mulder and Scully, and leaves Doggett and Reyes in the background. It also ncludes a number of guest-stars such as Krycek, Lone gunmen and X.Out of all nine seasons, season 9 probably contains the most extras. The extras are strangely spread on two discs. On disk 1, it has 3 documantaries: 'The truth about season 9', 'The making of the truth' and 'Refelctions on the truth'. There are also many special effects sequences. And TV spots on every single episode. Deleted scenes are also included on a number of episodes, including a scene with the president for 'The truth'. On the second special features disk there are 2 behind-the-scenes documantaries and a 'tribute to the x-files' featurette.Also, audio commentaries are on a few selected episodes, including a Chrish Carter commentary on 'Improbable' and a commentrary from director Kim Manners on 'Thr truth'.So, while this isn't the best season, there are still a number of good episodes. Frankly, the majority of them are good. Don't expect to see Scully that much. She is in every episode, just in a much smaller role, but she does have the main role for a few episodes. Though, Mulder only appears in the last episode.

811567,AFV2584U13XP3,B0001NBMFI,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","This series sadly was the finale of a great show and I feel that if they wanted to the character Dogget and Reyes could have kept the show going for a few more years but sadly not to be.  Of course this season had Mulder disappearing again to supposedly protect his son, Scully, and find the truth about the alien colonists final objectives.  For me Mulder or rather David Duchovny's leaving for most of the season was not a real loss as far as the episodes were concerned.  You still had Scully who while not with the X-files as she is teaching a course for FBI forensics techs is also helping Reyes and Dogget with their X-files cases.  The finale of the show wasn't that memorable as you have Mulder caught while trying to hack into a military database is put on trial for treason and a few other crimes.  Of course the X-files gang can't allow that and after Mulder's convicted the gang free him and allow him and Scully to drive away and escape the ""Evil"" shadow group allied with the aliens.  The only other memorable episode is when the Lone Gunman are killed while trying to stop a bio-logical weapon from being released by a terrorist.  So for the price of the set I say buy the season finale set and again while the character of Mulder doesn't appear much on this season it doesn't detract this seasons entertainment to watch..",5,Mulder Missing Again But Not Truly Missed,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,1337,"['series', 'sadly', 'was', 'finale', 'great', 'show', 'feel', 'wanted', 'character', 'Dogget', 'Reyes', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'show', 'going', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'sadly', 'not', 'be', 'course', 'season', 'had', 'Mulder', 'disappearing', 'again', 'supposedly', 'protect', 'son', 'Scully', 'find', 'truth', 'alien', 'final', 'objectives', 'Mulder', 'rather', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'leaving', 'most', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'loss', 'as', 'far', 'episodes', 'were', 'concerned', 'still', 'had', 'Scully', 'who', 'not', 'X-files', 'teaching', 'course', 'FBI', 'forensics', 'techs', 'also', 'helping', 'Reyes', 'Dogget', 'X-files', 'cases', 'finale', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'memorable', 'have', 'Mulder', 'caught', 'trying', 'hack', 'military', 'database', 'put', 'trial', 'treason', 'few', 'other', 'crimes', 'course', 'X-files', 'gang', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Mulder', 'convicted', 'gang', 'free', 'allow', 'Scully', 'drive', 'away', 'escape', 'Evil', 'shadow', 'group', 'allied', 'aliens', 'only', 'other', 'memorable', 'episode', 'when', 'Lone', 'Gunman', 'are', 'killed', 'trying', 'stop', 'bio-logical', 'weapon', 'being', 'released', 'terrorist', 'So', 'price', 'set', 'say', 'buy', 'season', 'finale', 'set', 'again', 'character', 'Mulder', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'season', ""n't"", 'detract', 'seasons', 'entertainment', 'watch..']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season
811568,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001NBMFI,Robert Moore,"[34, 42]","The new slimpack releases of Seasons 7 through 9-which are essentially the original sets with the extras disc removed as well as many other special features-will complete the entire rerelease of all the X-FILES in affordable editions.  I've been disappointed to find many of the special features missing in the first six volumes, but given that I couldn't afford the original editions, I'm all in all delighted to finally own my own copies, instead of relying on video stores and Netflix.Even great things must come to an end. After nine marvelous seasons, in which the series managed to establish new benchmarks in quality television, THE X-FILES wrapped up its run with what is unquestionably its most controversial and reviled season. Although Season Nine has come in for a vast amount of criticism, I firmly believe that much or most of it is undeserved. Many of its critics have obviously not seen all or even most or perhaps even any of it. For instance, if one scrolls down to the reviewer from Sweden, they complain that Scully spends the season crying over the fate of poor William. Actually, she spends very little time during the season crying, and she doesn't cry any at all in the two episodes that immediately follow her decision to put William up for adoption. She does cry briefly when telling Mulder in the series finale about having to give up William, but that hardly justifies the claim that she spends all of her time crying. One finds literally dozens of inane comments on the season like that one. All in all, Season Nine is a worthy successor to the eight that preceded it. It remained to the very end one of the finest series on all of television.My own belief is that Season Nine was more often criticized than watched, and that those who did watch and still criticized did so mainly because it no longer felt as familiar has it had been in the past. Many hated Doggett and Reyes primarily because they were not Mulder and Scully. Many hated the fact that while Scully was back, she was no longer officially on the X-Files, though she spent so much time helping Doggett and Reyes-and vice versa-that the distinction in the end was a bit meaningless. But for those willing to get past the fact that Mulder was no longer there and Scully only unofficially part of the X-Files, Season Nine was yet another season filled with riches. The show was always split between stand-alone episodes and mythology episodes. I will be the first to admit that this year's mythology episodes left a lot to be desired. Though I think criticism of Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish, who I both thought did marvelous jobs and should definitely play roles in future X-FILE movies, was simply wrong-headed, I will be the first to agree that the Super Soldiers story arc simply sucked. It lacked originality, passion, and the power to fire the imagination of the show's viewers. There were despite this some good moments, especially Terrance Quinn's (aka Terry O'Quinn, who went on to a great year as a regular on ALIAS in that show's Season Two and currently is superb on LOST as former paraplegic and resident knife-throwing badass John Locke) appearance as a Super Soldier, by and large this arc was an utter mistake. But the stand-alone episodes were absolutely first rate, with several as good as anything seen in any previous season. The season opening two-parter, ""Nothing Important Happened Today,"" had some great moments, many of them thanks to Lucy Lawless, who had just departed XENA. ""Hellbound"" was not merely one of the most haunting episodes in X-FILES history, but the point where Monica Reyes became integrated into the show. ""Lord of the Flies"" was simultaneously one of the funniest episodes of the season, and one of the most transcendently weird, as Doggett, Reyes, and Scully (aided by a self-smitten scientist who insisted on being called ""Rocky"") investigate a boy who has the ability to manipulate flies. ""John Doe"" is truly as good as any stand-alone episode in X-FILE history, as John Doggett wakes up in Mexico with no memory of who he is. ""Trust No 1"" is one of a couple of great Scully episodes, where she discovers that she has been the focus of the attention of a nebulous secret governmental organization. And for those who had hoped for the blossoming of a Mulder/Scully romance, her e-mail to Mulder in the episode confirmed that that had finally taken place, even if after Mulder had left the show (but meaning that he could not return without the romance being fullblown). ""Underneath"" was a great episode about a Jekyll and Hyde personality, another great episode worthy of the X-FILE name. ""Provenance"" and ""Providence"" formed an excellent two-parter that developed William's story to a greater extent. ""Scary Monsters"" was a solid if unspectacular episode about a boy with the power to create monsters with his mind, while ""Audrey Pauley"" was an absolutely stunning episode about coma-victims, of whom Monica Reyes was one, who exist in a kind of limbo, but which a mentally impaired woman was able to visit. Up to this point there had been no truly bad episodes during the whole season, even if some of the Super Soldiers arc had not been especially stellar. But then the show turned it up a notch with Burt Reynolds supplying one of the best guest appearances in the run of the series in the great episode ""Improbable."" After this, however, the show did stumble for a few episodes, though even then they were not completely without interest. ""Jump the Shark"" saw the show saying farewell to the Lone Gunmen, with a demise that was dramatically flat. It was a terrible way to say good-bye to some of the show's most beloved characters. ""Release"" had some fine moments as one of Scully's students at the Academy displayed an uncanny ability to analyze the corpses of murder victims, but it failed at some crucial moments. ""William,"" on the other hand, was very nearly a great episode, when a horribly disfigured man who seemed genetically similar to Mulder appears in the office of the X-Files. It slipped a bit with a lack of explanation of the emotional process that Scully went through to put William up for adoption. Nonetheless, a very fine episode. Many seem to like the episode ""Sunshine Days,"" where a man with remarkable mental powers recreates the inside of his house as the Brady Bunch home, but apart from that gimmick I don't think it did very much. But the show went out marvelously with the final two-parter that formed the finale of both the season and the series, ""The Truth."" It also imposed order on previous seasons that in truth were not as clear as this episode would make them appear. For instance, it really wasn't crystal clear that the Cigarette Smoking Man was Mulder's father (there had been some clues that would suggest that he was lying to Mulder), or which account of what happened to Mulder's sister was true, or other details in the overarching mythology. I believe the final episode imposed an order that the show did not in fact possess. Nonetheless, they managed to provide something approaching a narrative of what the previous nine years had been about (more of this in a second). But the great thing for the episode for me was seeing Scully get Mulder back, for them finally to be able to affirm and admit openly what they meant to each other, and for the foundations for future movies to be laid down, as Scully asserts to Mulder that her goals are the same as his, and their implied joint assertion to continue the search for the truth.Now, the reason I think that the final two-parter was a bit of a cheat was the fact that in a variety of places the writers and producers admit that they were pretty much making up the mythology as they went along. Frequently they tried things that were not truly compatible with what had gone before. A couple of times they painted themselves into corners. And on a few occasions they killed off characters with no very clear idea of why they were doing it (Krycek, the death of The Well-Manicured Man in the film, the first two deaths of the Cigarette Smoking Man, and the death of the Lone Gunmen are merely a few examples). Contrast this with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, where Joss Whedon would plant hints of events that would occur a couple of years later, e.g., in Season Three where Faith mentioned something to Buffy in a dream sequence that would take place in exactly two years-what happened was Buffy died). But credit must be laid where it is due: the multi-season consistency that we saw in BUFFY was in large part made possible by the multi-season inconsistency of THE X-FILES. With THE X-FILES, it became possible for shows to develop long story arcs that would take years to tell, and in that way, among others, it has made a permanent mark on television. My own feeling is that THE X-FILES produced the greatest stand-alone episodes since THE TWILIGHT ZONE, but that its even greater influence could be in making it OK for shows like BUFFY to develop long, multi-season story arcs. The value of this can't be overstated. In the early 1990s I read an article by a television critic who argued that television, often considered the poor sister of the movies, actually had more potential for extended narrative than did film. I absolutely agree with this, and would insist that the two shows that most fully developed and confirmed the potential of TV are THE X-FILES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Jointly they established the range of what television was capable of. In the wake of those two shows, it is impossible to imagine cinema ever developing story lines anywhere near as complex, or character analyses as rich and sustained as is possible in television. For instance, in THE X-FILES we gradually become sensible of the enormous contradictions in Scully's personality, a remarkably gifted and talented woman who has considerable personal achievements, who nonetheless has the self-realization that she has a fascination with charismatic males, and we see her over several seasons struggle with the way she feels drawn to Mulder for this reason and her attempts to keep herself apart from him. Or the two or three seasons during which Scully feels that she has no life because of the X-Files, and often manifests hostility towards Mulder as a result. No movie provides the opportunity to develop the host of character nuances that we observe in Scully over the years.This was not the best season for THE X-FILES, but it was still great, great television, and an essential part of the X-File saga. I strongly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to give it a chance.",5,"Weak compared to the rest of THE X-FILES, but great compared to most other TV shows",1143417600,"03 27,

Doggett's character is actually a great one, but, again, he's not really a true part of The X-Files to me.I actually think this season would have been worse if Mulder had stayed. What's left to do? We've seen enough monsters and green goo to last a lifetime, and the mythology played itself out long ago. It's still one of the best shows out there though. Unfortunately, Reyes was awful, and I think the reason is because she was never allowed her own place aside from Scully. Doggett was just a great character, and, with Mulder gone, this new character began to take shape. But Reyes was terrible. . . .

It was so well crafted all the way around it was like watching big screen movies on my television each week.  The seasons after Mulder I admit I went into with a grimace.I'd waited so long for Mulder and Scully to get together that the fact that David Duchovny was leaving had me at a loss for the show.  Although he left during season 8.  I wanted to review season 9's dvd's.  They have wonderful extra features.The main reason I am writing this review is that there was a major back lash over the casting of Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett.  But I found him charasmatic on screen.  The tough cop turned agent soon deligated to the X-files wasn't something I was complaining about so much anymore.  He was different and brought a new spin on the series.  Although they retained the spirit of the show with the Alien Conspiracy, etc.  I felt that he could easily keep me viewing.  He's not a traditional looking leading man so his talent needed to be top notch and I felt it was.  He made me care about Agent Doggett even when my Mulder/Scully fan side was screaming a resounding ""NOOOO.""  I'm glad I gave this season a chance.I won't say every show was excellent there are a couple I didn't care for fully, but I still will watch them over and over again.  This series never gets old for me.  There is always something new I pick up on that I didn't the last time.Don't miss out on Season 9 because of preconcieved notions there are wonderful X-files story rivaling Mulder and Scully only with a little different twist.My only complaint with the X-files DVD series in all 9 boxed sets is that they didn't price them lower for people like me who'd love to have them but can't shell out anywhere from $65-110 per season.  To have the complete collection it runs about $700-800 which is a large investment and I continually ask myself do I really need to spend the money on them.

811573,A3D7P8Q4SC1617,B0001NBMFI,shadowdoc,"[12, 12]","Season Nine of the X-Files was perhaps the most embattled of all the seasons.  If the series was to take on new life and new direction that was injected into it at the conclusion of Season Eight, this was to be the big transition year.  As had been planned, Scully would have bowed out at the conclusion of the season (hence her reduced role) and Doggett and Reyes would control the reigns (hence their prominence this season).  Some sketchy stand-alone episodes and a new conspiracy mythology frought with apparent continuity errors prevented this transition from succeeding.This season is worth owning for the simple fact that this ultimately became the series conclusion.  The final episode ""The Truth"" wraps up nearly all the plots left dangling.  Despite much reconciliation, the fates of our heroes and foes is left uncertain at the end (I won't spoil the premise).  The other mythology episodes: ""Nothing Important Happened Today I and II"", ""Trust No1"", ""Provenance"", and ""Providence"" do not contribute much to the series conclusion since the decision had not yet been made to end the series.  As such, these scripts further the conspiracy arc in ways that would never receive much resolution.  ""Trust No1"" stands out as a particularly excellent episode that introduces fan favorite Terry O'Quinn (billed as Terrance Quinn) as the Shadowman (what could have become a Cancerman substitute).  ""Provenance"" and ""Providence"" also introduce a shadowy figure that never had a chance to grow, though he's believed to not be human.  Much of the secondary characters are given episodes to conclude their personal stories: The Lone Gunmen, AD Brad Follmer, and Jeffrey Spender.  Other former favorites will return as well.In the end, I will buy this boxset for two reasons: 1) I own all the others, so I feel I should have it for completeness; and 2) I am very curious to see some of the behind-the-scenes dialogue on how this final season played out.Potential buyers should note that this is not the best season of the X-Files.  It's not the worst either (as some reviewers would suggest).  It clearly struggled, but to some extent, it is forgiveable since the ultimate fate of the series hung in the balance for much of the season.  Give it a chance.  Agents Doggett and Reyes are worthy successors to the legacy of Agents Mulder and Scully.

I will admit I've seen only a select few of the season's episodes and, of course, &#34;The Truth,&#34; but what little I did see was just crap.It appears FOX and the show's producers meant to squeeze every last dollar they possibly could out of the franchise before it met its predictable Mulder-less demise. And it's a shame because that's where they made their mistake. They could have taken that franchise far into the future if they had handled it properly. If they hadn't made such a mess of the mythology. If they hadn't used baby William as a mere plot device. If they hadn't created that mess of a storyline about &#34;super&#34; soldiers. If Chris Carter hadn't let his bitterness at David Duchovny's departure spill over into his storyline. If they hadn't doomed the Lone Gunman to failure by sending them off by themselves instead of making them a more integral part of The X-Files. And in particular, if they hadn't expected us to swallow that Fox Mulder would actually hide out in New Mexico abandoning Scully and his son--his son--to fend for themselves knowing full well what they were up against.They might have successfully launched Patrick and Gish into a version of the show with their own stamps on it. They were good, their characters likeable and interesting. They might have continued Mulder and Scully's story on the big screen with periodic movies. Fans all over the world would eagerly await each installment. We could have followed Mulder and Scully into the future. We could have watched them save the world. Instead we got &#34;I Want to Believe&#34; which no doubt drove the final nail into the coffin.I own seasons 1-7 and will always be a fan. But I watch them today with much less pleasure than I once did. The last two seasons left us fans who had been there since the beginning with a bitter taste in our mouths.

Well I believe that it is one of the best seasons together with the first 6 and far superior to the seventh season.The positive aspects are the following:1. Robert Patrick is a very good actor and finally in this season he gets to play the major role. Far better stories for his character than the previous season and together with Annabeth Gish they make a perfect pair.2. Very good stories and I enjoyed every single one of them. I could only find a mediocre episode through the whole.3. I believe that the continuation of the super soldier myth was satisfying despite some small gaps that exist.4. The introduction of the two characters brought a new feeling to the series and honestly I don't understand why the heck they ended the series. There are hundreds of more stories to tell having to do with strange stuff and just when the characters seemed to be working and evolving they decide to cancel the series. A pitty...The negative aspect is this:The last episode was a dissapointment. 90 minutes without doing anything, reaching nowhere, no surprise and not even a closure. If there is a movie supposed to wrap the series then its ok but they owned their fans a decent last episode of the series and not the one they created.Why did they kill the Lone Gunmen???

811579,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0001NBMFI,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 6]","By the end of the eight season it was clear that ""The X-Files"" had peaked by season six. That doesn't mean that there aren't pleasures to be found in the remaining 3 seasons. While Season Nine wasn't as consistent as the series at its peak (seasons 2-6), there were many interesting detours along the way. Robert Patrick and Annabelle Gish did a credible job as very different characters than those played by Duchovny and Anderson. Having Anderson on the sidelines as more of an observer was an interesting concept although, again, the series worked best when the trio worked together.I personally felt that the mythology episodes were fascinating to watch but not always as strong as the shorter story arcs or the stand alone episodes. That's also the case here with the ""super solider"" story arc. It starts off promising enough but quickly degenerates into a mere shadow of the off shoot story arcs from previous seasons. Still, it offered an interesting diversion for season nine. Episodes such as ""4-D"" offered a lot of potential that were undermined by plot and holes in the logic.Still, if the magic wasn't quite as slick as before, Carter still had some tricks up his sleeve. ""Sunshine Days"" had moments that matched the best the series had to offer likewise a number of other fine episodes. I was a bit disappointed in the conclusion for the series however as it seemed as if Carter elected to wrap up the outstanding story lines a bit too swiftly and a bit too neatly. Still, I have to give him credit for resolving the major story arc of the series.The picture quality is terrific for the most part and the commentary tracks particularly for ""Jumping the Shark"" are quite good as well. Although Fox has always priced this series at a premium, the set is nicely packaged and has some terrific extras including a DVD-ROM game. I'd recommend starting from the beginning but you will want the end of the series as well. Some of the nasty comments on the last season are unfair as the exceptations were set so high for the series. Also, the reality is that seasons 8 and 9 were really a new beginning in the series cycle.

811580,AP3B615GM191G,B0001NBMFI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","One of the big problems of popular TV shows is when they are going to end.  Unless a show is like LOST, which had the clout to forecast and negotiate a set number of seasons, many shows either are pulled off the air too soon, or stick around for a bit too long.  The X-Files definitely had a problem with the latter of those two options.Though the Ninth Season of the X-Files provided more thrilling stand-alone episodes (show creator Chris Carter said he had many more years of stories he could tell), the show was put in a rather awkward situation for one reason: main cast members were moving on.  With David Duchovny (Mulder) only making a single appearance (in the season finale) this season, and Gillian Anderson (Scully) saying that this would be her final season, the show was turned over to Robert Patrick (Doggett) and Annabeth Gish (Reyes) playing the lead characters.Surprisingly, that major transition worked quite well, especially for the stand-alone episodes, as the Dogget-Reyes relationship is as interesting as the early Mulder-Scully pairing.  However, the myth-arc episodes suffered tremendously.  For years, the backbone of the X-Files had been Mulder's quest to find his sister, Mulder's unearthing of government conspiracies, and the Mulder-Scully relationship.  With those first two qualifications being wrapped up in earlier seasons, the only remnant of the ""original"" X-Files was the Mulder-Scully relationship (with baby William as the conduit)...which was never meant to be at the forefront of the show in the first place.  Sure, the super-soldier myth-arc was fascinating, but without Mulder's passion it really became an entirely different show.To conclude, even in this Ninth Season (widely-regarded as the worst of the show's run), the X-Files continued to produce compelling television.  Yet, due to casting changes beyond the control of the writers/producers, the entire premise of the show shifted from Mulder's quests to the ensemble cast of Scully, Doggett, and Reyes.  While I would not, by any means, say that the show went into the tank, it did lose the ""magic"" (Mulder's passion, witty humor, etc.) that made the X-Files the best show on the air for many years.So, as you settle in to watch this show's final run, try to enjoy the show for what it once once...a paranormal spookfest (before it evolved into a web of government conspiracies).  Then, enjoy the season finale (""The Truth""), which does its best to try and explain what happened during the nine years of the show's extended run.",3,An Awkward Situation,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,2531,"['One', 'big', 'problems', 'popular', 'TV', 'shows', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'show', 'LOST', 'had', 'clout', 'forecast', 'negotiate', 'set', 'number', 'seasons', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'pulled', 'off', 'air', 'too', 'soon', 'stick', 'around', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'X-Files', 'definitely', 'had', 'problem', 'latter', 'two', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'provided', 'more', 'thrilling', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'show', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'said', 'had', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'stories', 'could', 'tell', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'rather', 'awkward', 'situation', 'one', 'reason', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'moving', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Mulder', 'only', 'making', 'single', 'appearance', 'season', 'finale', 'season', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Scully', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'turned', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Doggett', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Reyes', 'playing', 'lead', 'characters.Surprisingly', 'major', 'transition', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'especially', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'Dogget-Reyes', 'relationship', 'as', 'interesting', 'early', 'Mulder-Scully', 'pairing', 'However', 'myth-arc', 'episodes', 'suffered', 'tremendously', 'years', 'backbone', 'X-Files', 'had', 'been', 'Mulder', 'quest', 'find', 'sister', 'Mulder', 'unearthing', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'Mulder-Scully', 'relationship', 'first', 'two', 'qualifications', 'being', 'wrapped', 'up', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'only', 'remnant', 'original', 'X-Files', 'was', 'Mulder-Scully', 'relationship', 'baby', 'William', 'conduit', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'forefront', 'show', 'first', 'place', 'Sure', 'super-soldier', 'myth-arc', 'was', 'fascinating', 'Mulder', 'passion', 'really', 'became', 'entirely', 'different', 'show.To', 'conclude', 'even', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'widely-regarded', 'worst', 'show', 'run', 'X-Files', 'continued', 'produce', 'compelling', 'television', 'due', 'casting', 'changes', 'control', 'writers/producers', 'entire', 'premise', 'show', 'shifted', 'Mulder', 'quests', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Scully', 'Doggett', 'Reyes', 'would', 'not', 'means', 'say', 'show', 'went', 'tank', 'did', 'lose', 'magic', 'Mulder', 'passion', 'witty', 'humor', 'etc', 'made', 'X-Files', 'best', 'show', 'air', 'many', 'years.So', 'settle', 'watch', 'show', 'final', 'run', 'try', 'enjoy', 'show', 'what', 'once', 'once', 'paranormal', 'spookfest', 'evolved', 'web', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'Then', 'enjoy', 'season', 'finale', 'Truth', 'best', 'try', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'nine', 'years', 'show', 'extended', 'run']",The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season
