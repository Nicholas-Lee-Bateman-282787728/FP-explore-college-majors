1337990,A1KVSBMU1R4GVU,B003EJO8TI,Alicia Adams,"[5, 5]","I love L.M. Montgomery's Emily series, especially Emily herself.  She's a creative, artistic child who also has a strong sense of right and wrong.  She clashes with her adoptive family, but tries to respect their traditions.  She stands up for herself when treated unjustly, but is generally obedient.  Her stories and poems are based on her imagination, not spying on the neighbors.  She has a mystical side, but also a practical one.That Emily does not appear in the TV series.  Instead we see a bratty kid who meddles in adult business for her own entertainment, tells lies shamelessly, and doesn't really respect any of the adults in her life.But what is done to Laura is worse.  The Laura of the book is a salt-of-the-earth character who works tirelessly for the good of her family and mothers her dead sister's child.  She is quite healthy in mind and body, although she lacks the leadership qualities of her elder sister.The TV series has elected to turn Laura into a victim, a tragic example of the supposed effects of Repressive Victorian Morality.  In fact, most of this season is pure propaganda against an important era in human history, with no attempt at being even-handed or fair.  Poor Laura has to endure just about every possible disaster: laudanum addiction, confinement to a mental asylum, betrayal by her first love, a forced marriage, a cruel mother-in-law, poor working conditions at her first job, and so on.  She is generally a passive victim too, and when she does find some spirit and courage, she is driven by lust for another man rather than any true self-respect.The list goes on.  Jimmy in the books is ""very clever in spots,"" damaged by his tragic accident and yet still wise and gifted in his own way.  He nurtures Emily's writing talent and guides her in dealing with the family.  Jimmy in the movie is turned into a mostly comic figure, dependent upon Emily and the other children for help and guidance.  The episodes where Emily's wishing moon makes him a genius are just weird.Then there's Perry, who is transformed from a respectable orphan to the son of a murderess.  Teddy, who is no longer the innocent childhood friend that L.M. Montgomery envisioned for her Emily, but a jealous teenage boyfriend.  And even the firey Ilse was not exciting enough for the screenwriters - she nearly gets killed off in a smallpox epidemic.It's a sad commentary on our times when the old classics can no longer be understood or appreciated on their own terms, but must be rewritten to suit modern prejudices and assumptions about other time periods.",3,a modern distortion of a classic,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2573,"['love', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'Emily', 'series', 'especially', 'Emily', 'creative', 'artistic', 'child', 'who', 'also', 'strong', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'adoptive', 'family', 'respect', 'traditions', 'up', 'herself', 'when', 'treated', 'unjustly', 'generally', 'obedient', 'stories', 'poems', 'are', 'based', 'imagination', 'not', 'spying', 'neighbors', 'mystical', 'side', 'also', 'practical', 'one.That', 'Emily', 'not', 'appear', 'TV', 'series', 'Instead', 'see', 'bratty', 'kid', 'who', 'adult', 'business', 'own', 'entertainment', 'shamelessly', ""n't"", 'really', 'respect', 'adults', 'life.But', 'what', 'done', 'Laura', 'worse', 'Laura', 'book', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'character', 'who', 'tirelessly', 'good', 'family', 'mothers', 'dead', 'sister', 'child', 'quite', 'healthy', 'mind', 'body', 'leadership', 'qualities', 'elder', 'sister.The', 'TV', 'series', 'elected', 'turn', 'Laura', 'victim', 'tragic', 'example', 'supposed', 'effects', 'Repressive', 'Victorian', 'Morality', 'fact', 'most', 'season', 'pure', 'propaganda', 'important', 'era', 'human', 'history', 'attempt', 'being', 'even-handed', 'fair', 'Poor', 'Laura', 'endure', 'just', 'possible', 'disaster', 'laudanum', 'addiction', 'confinement', 'mental', 'asylum', 'betrayal', 'first', 'love', 'forced', 'marriage', 'cruel', 'mother-in-law', 'poor', 'working', 'conditions', 'first', 'job', 'so', 'generally', 'passive', 'victim', 'too', 'when', 'find', 'spirit', 'courage', 'driven', 'lust', 'man', 'rather', 'true', 'self-respect.The', 'list', 'Jimmy', 'books', 'very', 'clever', 'spots', 'damaged', 'tragic', 'accident', 'yet', 'still', 'wise', 'gifted', 'own', 'way', 'Emily', 'writing', 'talent', 'dealing', 'family', 'Jimmy', 'movie', 'turned', 'mostly', 'comic', 'figure', 'dependent', 'Emily', 'other', 'children', 'help', 'guidance', 'episodes', 'where', 'Emily', 'wishing', 'moon', 'genius', 'are', 'just', 'Perry', 'who', 'transformed', 'respectable', 'orphan', 'son', 'murderess', 'Teddy', 'who', 'longer', 'innocent', 'childhood', 'friend', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'envisioned', 'Emily', 'jealous', 'teenage', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'firey', 'Ilse', 'was', 'not', 'exciting', 'enough', 'screenwriters', 'nearly', 'killed', 'off', 'smallpox', 'epidemic.It', 'sad', 'commentary', 'times', 'when', 'old', 'classics', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'understood', 'appreciated', 'own', 'terms', 'must', 'be', 'rewritten', 'suit', 'modern', 'prejudices', 'assumptions', 'other', 'time', 'periods']",N/A

So I was thrilled to discover this new LM Montgomery series after returning from one of my favorite vacations ever -- to Prince Edward Island (where I stayed for several nights in the home-turned-inn that Ms. Dewhurst purchased after falling in love with PEI and where I also met a descendent of LMM herself at the non-touristy homestead in Park Corner).  I thoroughly enjoyed Emily of New Moon Seasons One and Two and was eagerly awaiting the release of Season Three, which I pre-ordered and therefore received on the release date of June 1, two days ago.  I am about a third of the way through this 600+-minute season and have to admit I'm very disappointed -- and have been from the start.  The actors remain wonderful, but the writing!!! -- it's nowhere near the standard of the first two seasons.  What a cliff hanger at the end of Season Two -- will Laura marry Ian Bowles or throw him over for the good doctor?  I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't reveal what happens to them in the first episode of Season Three (and I won't reveal what I feel are the many other ridiculous and unrealistic plotlines of this season).  I compared the list of writers and found that, while there are some new ones for this season, the list of writers for the first two seasons were not identical either and all three seasons have a common core of writers.  So what can be the explanation?  I keep waiting for the next episode to see if the quality I enjoyed is restored, but not yet.  Since both Seasons 3 and 4 were released on June 1, I had pre-ordered both, so I hope I have not wasted my money.  I will update this review when I complete season 3 and again when I watch season 4 (if I don't just give up and relegate these to the back of my video library).",3,A Long-Awaited but Disappointing Season 3,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1901,"['fell', 'love', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'mother', 'gave', 'books', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst/Megan', 'Followes', 'videos', 'Christmas', 'So', 'was', 'thrilled', 'discover', 'new', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'series', 'returning', 'one', 'favorite', 'vacations', 'ever', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'where', 'stayed', 'several', 'nights', 'home-turned-inn', 'Ms.', 'Dewhurst', 'purchased', 'falling', 'love', 'PEI', 'where', 'also', 'met', 'descendent', 'LMM', 'non-touristy', 'homestead', 'Park', 'Corner', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Emily', 'New', 'Moon', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'release', 'Season', 'Three', 'pre-ordered', 'therefore', 'received', 'release', 'date', 'June', '1', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'am', 'third', 'way', '600+-minute', 'season', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'have', 'been', 'start', 'actors', 'remain', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'nowhere', 'standard', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'What', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'will', 'Laura', 'marry', 'Ian', 'Bowles', 'throw', 'over', 'good', 'doctor', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiler', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'feel', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'unrealistic', 'plotlines', 'season', 'compared', 'list', 'writers', 'found', 'are', 'new', 'ones', 'season', 'list', 'writers', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'not', 'identical', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'common', 'core', 'writers', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'explanation', 'keep', 'waiting', 'next', 'episode', 'see', 'quality', 'enjoyed', 'restored', 'not', 'yet', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'were', 'released', 'June', '1', 'had', 'pre-ordered', 'hope', 'have', 'not', 'wasted', 'money', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'when', 'complete', 'season', '3', 'again', 'when', 'watch', 'season', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'up', 'relegate', 'back', 'video', 'library']",N/A

I enjoyed the first two immensely but found as the story progressed there was more delving into the unknown and whether one would call it a form of witchcraft I do not know. I do not think I would want my 9 year old granddaughter watching the last two seasons though because of that. I love wonderful victorian stories and have ordered many dvd movies here at amazon. But the Lucy Montgomery series left me with a kind of bad taste. I have not read the books so I can not say the tv series is based on the books. I just hate it when writers introduce alot of the spirit world into things for children to watch and yes, even adults like myself. I have read some of the acting was poorly done. Well I suppose it gets hard to come up with stories after several seasons. But this could have been so beautifully written and portrayed and I forgot one thing...you do not have to write a series like this and include so many 'damns' and 'hells' and subject matter that is inappropriate for young children to watch. What has happened to our society when it feels cursing and some of the story lines must be included.
