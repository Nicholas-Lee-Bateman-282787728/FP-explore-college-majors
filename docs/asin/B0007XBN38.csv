There is a sadistic serial killer on the loose, but this mere murderer is the least of the town's problems. You see, a huge dam is being built, forcing the town into near extinction. Most of the residents have either left, or are getting ready to do so. The remaining skeleton crew find themselves caught up in a battle between the guilty living and the vengeful dead. Patty McCormack (The Bad Seed, Bug, Mommy, Mommy 2: Mommy's Day) has a central role in this fleshcrawler! It's always good to see her in anything.

Boy am I glad I'm not stuck with a worthless disk. Although this movie starts out promisingly, it taxes the patience of the viewer and never pays off.  The frustrations are of two types:  1) nobody in the movie can figure out what's going on, and 2) neither can the the viewer.  Why did the naked boy walk into the police station oozing blood from every pore?  Dunno.  Why do people become homicidal and/or extremely stupid when they touch said blood?  Search me.  But surely, the frenzied activity on the screen will result in everything being resolved, right?  Surely, the two naked women strung up from tree limbs will not have suffered without explanation, right?  Not on your life.  And just when you think the agony of watching terrible acting and baffling behavior has come to an end, the movie finishes with a scene from out of nowhere.  Reminds me of another horror movie with a perplexing ending...the viewer was rewarded with a fade-out of a cemetery caretaker looking into the camera and laughing his @#$ off.  Well, it's not funny.

Evidently, the creators of this flick thought that this confusion would help keep the viewer interested.  It does to a certain extent, but by the time the ending rolls around, the viewer or audience becomes irritated and disappointed with the plot development and the ending itself.  Frankly, the killer's identity in the end undercuts the early success of the movie...I mean a grandmother for Pete's sake!!!???  That is just soooooo scary!!  NOT!!!Also, the boy coming back from the grave and all of the blood really did not do much for me at all.  At first, it kept me interested, but ultimately, all the blood was just window dressing for this flick.  ""Shallow Ground"" tries to be cute with its confusing plot, but ultimately fails to deliver the goods.  The acting in this movie is below average to average at best in ""Shallow Ground"".  If you are interested in confusing plots and strange plot twists, you may want to check this out.  However, in the opinion of this reviewer, ""Shallow Ground"" represents an unconvincing attempt at style over substance.  The mystery that is ""Shallow Ground"" keeps one's interest for a little while, but as the movie unfolds and begins to reveal itself to the viewer, the audience gets a feeling of emptiness or a cheated feeling if you will...at least, this is the feeling I came away with after watching this rubbish.If you want style over substance, check out Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" which is the classic style over substance horror movie which actually produces some scares unlike this dressed up trash called ""Shallow Ground"".

Well actually, it seems that every zombie movie uses dense woods as a setting, and this movie is no exception.  What separates this from other zombie movies is the unique story and plot.  Basically what it comes down to is that murder victims across the world are rising up and seeking to find their killers with the intention of killing them in revenge.  The movie is quite gorey and twisted.  The special effects are pretty impressive considering this movie's budget was a whopping $78,000.  The acting is pretty good overall.  There is a lot of nudity.  The music throughout the movie is pretty decent.  This is a rare B zombie movie that actually has some substance to it, rather than it being a mindless attempt to scare the audience, like so many B zombie movies are.  The camerawork is good and normal.  What I mean by normal is that the camera doesn't shake intentionally like it does in the B zombie movie Severed - Forest Of The Dead, for example.Overall, not a bad horror movie.

It ultimately is a tale of the dead getting revenge on a murderer who has been making people disappear, with some additional plotlines that somehow tie in.

For a low budget film of this type, Shallow Ground manages to avoid many of the cliches of the genre, and the cast is surprisingly decent throughout as well.

There is lots of blood and not a lot of time wasted on silly and often formulaic plots. Yet an atmosphere of suspense. I would give it one star for ME personally as entertainment. But my sense is that horror fans might like it because it is kind of different. Just relentless immersion in blood and weirdness -- no hockey masks or teenagers on camping trips or who gets killed first, second, third, etc. Kind of minimalist!!So my three stars are sort of for a technical accomplishment that maybe SOME horror film fans might appreciate. It is sort of like a relentless and disgusting bad dream not held up by a clear plot (there is actually a sort of plot, but it is not the point and can be done without).In SOME ways it reminds me of some of the David Decoteau low-budget films that just kill people off sort of randomly, with ""thin"" plots, though of course without all the shirtless young men. He seems to have a sort of minimalist vision that sometimes works better than others.  Shirtless guys are HIS novelty, but the novelty value in this film seems to be mostly the blood covered kid that appears right at the opening of the film and just keeps appearing and disappearing along with the creepy sound effects. Different. What can you do with a camera and only a few dollars? Low budget film makers quite fascinate me no mater what genre they are working in. Sometimes they really put a lot into their films and get a lot out, but of course sometimes they quite flop.I suspect that within the genre (and again I am not that familiar with it) they are TRYING to do something different and interesting for their target audience.

Not because they suck-- though, assuredly, most of them do-- but because I inevitably compare something like Shallow Ground (or the more recent Deadbirds) to (a) the complete unwatchable trash that shows up as ""Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies"" and (b) the complete only-slightly-more-watchable crap that's coming out in theaters under the horror banner. I can't begin to tell you how much more Shallow Ground deserved to be on a big screen than did the recent Hills Have Eyes or Dark Water remakes or, Jehosephat help us, Haute Tension. Yeah, it's got its problems, but when you put it up against any of the three other films mentioned, or scores of others, it's Oscar material.The plot: a small town, made into a boomtown by an influx of temporary workers building a dam, is deflating again after the dam is finished. Sherriff Jack Sheppard (Skeleton Man's Timothy Murphy), his deputies Stuart (character actor Stan Kirsch) and Laura (Lindsey Stoddart, whose biggest role until now has been a minor part in The Ring), and town paramedic Darby Owens (Scab's Natalie Avital) are all getting ready to go their separate ways when a stranger wanders into town, naked and covered in blood. Suddenly, there's a reason to hang around town, especially when Jack starts to suspect that to silent man killed Amy Underhill (Tara Killian, of American Pie Presents Band Camp), whose murder still haunts him. The truth, however, is a whole lot weirder...The script could have used a good rewrite or two for the purpose of patching up holes and doing a bit more character development. This, however, is true of a lot of microbudget movies, and we can't really give points off for it here any more than we did for El Mariachi. Besides, lack of character development is pretty much a staple in horror films, no? I can't help but think, though, this one's got enough stubs from which real characters could grow to make a rewrite (and a remake, preferably with the same connections) worthwhile, in the same way El Mariachi grew into Desperado. But if you look past the script's shortcomings and a relatively silly final scene, this is a fantastic little shocker-- well thought out, with enough plot twists to keep you looking like you're trying to follow Wimbledon, some decent acting (coupled with some scream queen action, but again, in a horror flick that's kind of forgivable), and a good deal of convention-flaunting.I liked this movie a whole bunch, and I hope it ends up getting the attention it deserves. It's the kind of fresh, new horror film that Hollywood needs to understand is what's going to hook a new generation. Cranking out crappy remakes of good films is going to do nothing more than inspire contempt and desensitization. *** ",4,Fantastic microbudget flick.,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2830,"['Shallow', 'Ground', 'Sheldon', 'Wilson', '2004', 'sometimes', 'pick', 'up', 'straight-to-DVD', 'horror', 'releases', 'Not', 'suck', 'assuredly', 'most', 'do', 'inevitably', 'compare', 'something', 'Shallow', 'Ground', 'more', 'recent', 'Deadbirds', 'complete', 'unwatchable', 'trash', 'up', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movies', 'b', 'complete', 'only-slightly-more-watchable', 'crap', 'coming', 'out', 'theaters', 'horror', 'banner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'Shallow', 'Ground', 'deserved', 'be', 'big', 'screen', 'did', 'recent', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Dark', 'Water', 'remakes', 'Jehosephat', 'help', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'Yeah', 'got', 'problems', 'when', 'put', 'up', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'mentioned', 'scores', 'others', 'Oscar', 'material.The', 'plot', 'small', 'town', 'made', 'boomtown', 'influx', 'temporary', 'workers', 'building', 'dam', 'deflating', 'again', 'dam', 'finished', 'Sherriff', 'Jack', 'Sheppard', 'Skeleton', 'Man', 'Timothy', 'Murphy', 'deputies', 'Stuart', 'character', 'actor', 'Stan', 'Kirsch', 'Laura', 'Lindsey', 'Stoddart', 'biggest', 'role', 'now', 'been', 'minor', 'part', 'Ring', 'town', 'paramedic', 'Darby', 'Owens', 'Scab', 'Natalie', 'Avital', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'when', 'stranger', 'wanders', 'town', 'naked', 'covered', 'blood', 'Suddenly', 'reason', 'hang', 'town', 'especially', 'when', 'Jack', 'suspect', 'silent', 'man', 'killed', 'Amy', 'Underhill', 'Tara', 'Killian', 'American', 'Pie', 'Presents', 'Band', 'Camp', 'murder', 'still', 'truth', 'however', 'whole', 'lot', 'weirder', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'good', 'rewrite', 'two', 'purpose', 'patching', 'up', 'holes', 'doing', 'bit', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'however', 'true', 'lot', 'microbudget', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'points', 'off', 'here', 'more', 'did', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'Besides', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'pretty', 'much', 'staple', 'horror', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'though', 'one', 'got', 'enough', 'stubs', 'real', 'characters', 'could', 'grow', 'make', 'rewrite', 'remake', 'preferably', 'same', 'connections', 'worthwhile', 'same', 'way', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'grew', 'Desperado', 'look', 'script', 'shortcomings', 'relatively', 'silly', 'final', 'scene', 'fantastic', 'little', 'shocker', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'looking', ""'re"", 'trying', 'follow', 'Wimbledon', 'decent', 'acting', 'coupled', 'scream', 'queen', 'action', 'again', 'horror', 'flick', 'kind', 'forgivable', 'good', 'deal', 'convention-flaunting.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'whole', 'bunch', 'hope', 'up', 'getting', 'attention', 'kind', 'fresh', 'new', 'horror', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'hook', 'new', 'generation', 'Cranking', 'out', 'crappy', 'remakes', 'good', 'films', 'going', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'inspire', 'contempt', 'desensitization', '***']",Shallow Ground
893581,AK1OBVI54SY73,B0007XBN38,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[2, 5]","That was what I was thinking about at the end of the credits. I hate it when I feel in the middle of a movie, c.d., book, etc. It's a very rare thing for me to be in the middle of a horror movie, yet this movie did in fact leave me left in the middle. This movie was not terrible, nor was it great.All you see in this movie really is blood, blood, and more blood, usually coming from this naked boy who just sits there staring at nothing. Yet, sitting there watching this naked, bleeding boy leaves you endlessly curious about what he truly is- a spirit, a real boy- what? You wonder what is also going to happen to the dull- ish actors that are centered around this bleeding mystery.The actors are truly a bore mainly, there are no real stand- out characters in this movie but the sheriff, the naked bleeding boy and finally the antagonist at the end. The others I think were just filler, you find yourself not caring about the others too much. Then the nudity in the film could have easily have been cut out but the director decided for some reason it had to be shown. I could have lived without it honestly. I hate how I have to see so much unnecessary nudity in horror films, but at least it's not overdone in this film like in so many others.Then the ending just never seemed to come. I don't know if others felt that way, but I did feel like the ending stretched out way too long. They put a few things in the film that made me think they should have been in the deleted scenes pile, and thanks to a few of those unnecessary scenes, there was not enough time really for the final enemy in the end of the film to explain why they did what they did. So you only get a short explanation, which leaves you pushing the rewind button. Then the ending itself was a little strange, an ending that leaves you a bit confused and makes you wonder why they wrote it like that, when they could have done it one or two others ways possibly. Yet the ending for sure is creative, and finally one horror movie that was not predictable. I certainly did not predict the ending that happened. It may have been a bit of a confusing ending, but creative and different, nonetheless.So through the sifting of the negatives and the positives, I found myself not saying 'stinks' or excellent'.

I like a movie that makes you think and i sure did a lot of thinking to try to figure out what was going on with this movie. I will not go into any detail to avoid giving away any of the story. We find out near the very end the reason for the killings and have a better understanding of the characters. After watching this movie again, I now have a better understanding of the who's, why's and how's of what it's all about. Maybe I was just not in the mood for this movie the first time or was just to tired to really pay close attention to it, but it did make more sense the second time around. There are several continuity issues that plague this movie and the use of sound effects/music is also ill timed/placed and cause more harm than good to a given scene. The movie does have a few eerie scenes and its story is decent and somewhat of a compilation of other movies in this genre that will be recognizable to many.

There's lots of gore to keep a horror fan (like me) satisfied. It's original, scary, gorey *drools with rememberence of gore in movie*, unpredictable, etc, and you'll probably like it. (I don't remember any of the character's names, so I'm just going to call them by appearence) Probably the goriest scene is when the boy covered in blood pushes his fist right through the old woman's throat, which causes her to collapse on herslelf. Apparently, ever since this woman lost her husband and daughter, she's ""gotten revenge"" on the people in this city, and has shot them and butchered them. Then, she takes their corpses into a secret room in her home and puts them into a lving room and makes it look like they're having conversation and whatnot. This teen - formed by the blood of those people - kills her in return for her sins. Then, a cop (who turns out to be the main character) and a local (whose daughter lost her life to the old woman) bury her corpse in, well, shallow ground, and drive back to the local area. It ends with the gorey kid staring at the car, and he walks off.....But there's more. As he walks off into the forest (should I spoil the end for you? Ehh, why not), a pitch black being covered in blood with thick white eyes and pointy devil ears, gritting its teeth, comes out from behind a bush and jams it's fist right through the kid! He falls with a thud. Then, this new creature, looks around, pondering what its next move would be. And, as I would imagine, it decides to head back to where it all started!!!!Who that being is supposed to be, I don't know. It may be the old woman, or maybe one of the cops that was killed. Or maybe it's a combination of all the people who were killed by the bloody beings bakc in a new form, wanting revenge on these people (!). Whatever. Overall, I think Sheldon Wilson did a pretty good job directing it, and the acting is also pretty good. Watch it! Rent it or something.

This is strange, because screenplay is generally the least expensive element of a movie like this, and should not have been shortchanged. If you can get the Budapest Symphony Orchestra to provide the background music (as they miraculously did), surely you can find someone who could write a story that makes sense.There were some shocking, scary scenes and some suspense, but no real payoff. I watched very closely, and I still have not resolved many loose ends regarding who did what to whom....and how or why they did it. If the villain is indeed who they seemed to be, they simply would not possess the strength or stamina to commit the atrocities depicted. Also, the ""surprise ending"" creates more questions than answers about what was happening. I think it was simply tacked on for shock value rather than any coherent addition to the plot.The confusing nature of the plot was definitely not due to a clever, intricate screenplay and skillful direction, such as in ""Memento"" or ""The Jacket"", in which you have to watch very carefully to catch each clue....instead, I think it was simply a result of amateurish editing and an inability to see the story as a whole. I fault the writer/director. Despite the limited budget, he obviously had all the necessary resources to make an excellent independent film, and he dropped the ball by focusing on small details (such as the way that blood flowed on the floor), rather than telling a good story. There were individual, shocking events, but they did not flow together coherently.For all the reasons stated, and many that were omitted due to space, I suggest that if you absolutely must view this movie, rent the DVD and do not buy it....I can assure you that one viewing is more than enough.",2,Some Good Production Values....but an Incoherent Plot,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2021,"['DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'revealed', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'only', '70,000', 'mind', 'cinematography', 'music', 'acting', 'cast', 'including', 'experienced', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'one', 'missing', 'feature', 'was', 'coherent', 'plot', 'strange', 'screenplay', 'generally', 'least', 'expensive', 'element', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'shortchanged', 'can', 'get', 'Budapest', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'provide', 'background', 'music', 'miraculously', 'did', 'surely', 'can', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'write', 'story', 'were', 'shocking', 'scary', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'real', 'payoff', 'watched', 'very', 'closely', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'resolved', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'regarding', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', '.and', 'how', 'why', 'did', 'villain', 'indeed', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'possess', 'strength', 'stamina', 'commit', 'atrocities', 'depicted', 'Also', 'surprise', 'ending', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'think', 'was', 'simply', 'tacked', 'shock', 'value', 'rather', 'coherent', 'addition', 'plot.The', 'confusing', 'nature', 'plot', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'due', 'clever', 'intricate', 'screenplay', 'skillful', 'direction', 'such', 'Memento', 'Jacket', 'have', 'watch', 'very', 'carefully', 'catch', 'clue', '.instead', 'think', 'was', 'simply', 'result', 'amateurish', 'editing', 'inability', 'see', 'story', 'whole', 'fault', 'writer/director', 'limited', 'budget', 'obviously', 'had', 'necessary', 'resources', 'make', 'excellent', 'independent', 'film', 'dropped', 'ball', 'focusing', 'small', 'details', 'such', 'way', 'blood', 'flowed', 'floor', 'rather', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'were', 'individual', 'shocking', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'together', 'coherently.For', 'reasons', 'stated', 'many', 'were', 'omitted', 'due', 'space', 'suggest', 'absolutely', 'must', 'view', 'movie', 'rent', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'can', 'assure', 'one', 'viewing', 'more', 'enough']",Shallow Ground
893587,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B0007XBN38,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[4, 6]","SHALLOW GROUND will surprise you.It has all the hallmarks of a typical serial killer film, mixed with all the earmarks of a supernatural thriller - both of which are then framed by your standard FRIDAY THE 13TH set up and pay off, and if memory serves - a little seen 80's horror film called HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME (if you've seen the film, when you reach the payoff in SHALLOW GROUND - you'll know exactly what I'm talking about - it's a welcome return).  SHALLOW GROUND should not work because it really is all over the map, yet the story does drive directly from start to finish with one focus.  It's not this focus that is the problem, it's just all the trappings that we've come to expect, and directors and writers think they need to provide, that slows the film down.SHALLOW GROUNND opens with a solid, effective, and creepy credit sequence that builds both a mystery and a head of steam right up until when the actual movie starts - and then it stops dead.  Really, if you love to watch a guy pack and unpack a jeep, then this films first few minuets are for you!  But, luckily the film does manage to ditch the boxes and dive headlong into the story.  The films divided focus between the ""serial killer"" track and the ""supernatural"" track plays favorites with the supernatural end, leaving the serial killer side of the film in the dust.  There are simply too many empty spaces and scenes that run a few frames too long.  There are also a number of scenes with no dialouge which leaves the door open for music and sound effects to fill the void.  The trouble is, despite being just fine, they are often over the top and are there to, at best, mislead the viewer, and at worst, telegraph exactly what's about to happen.  But when it comes to the supernatural side of the story - it really opens up.  You'll be hard pressed to find too much that you haven't seen before, but SHALLOW GROUND does have its moments that are inventive and original (the fingerprint scene is a stand out) - and it's here that the movie really shines.  The direction actually kicks up a notch, the perfomances seem more alive and vibrant, and while there is a large amount of gore and blood (oh, dude - A LOT of blood) it's never so over the top as to simply be just a covering to hide plot holes or kill time.  Blood is so vital in SHALLOW GROUND, it's actually a character.  It has personality and purpose.  Also, either by choice, or by luck - the film takes a chance and leaves you with both an ending, a mystery (the supernatural side is never explained), and a ""what next?"" epilogue - which may leave some feeling cheated, while others may want to know more.Commentary is included in the deal and while solid and knowledgeable, it gets stuck in a rut of explaining shots, camerawork, music, sets, lighting and locations - it's tech heavy.  It's informative, but tends to grind.Overall, SHALLOW GROUND was a surprise.  Better than the promise of the box art or the quotes found on it (how or why this film is compared to 28 DAYS LATER is lost on me - neither film has anything to do with the other).Finally I have to give props to ROCKY MARQUETTE - who plays our blood soaked mystery boy.  It takes a lot of dedication to not only appear nude from the opening credits to the closing roll in a film, but to also be painted head to toe in red for it as well.  There really should be some kind of award...",3,"THICKEN YOUR COFFEE, SIR?",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,3389,"['SHALLOW', 'GROUND', 'will', 'surprise', 'you.It', 'hallmarks', 'typical', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'mixed', 'earmarks', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'are', 'then', 'framed', 'standard', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'set', 'up', 'pay', 'off', 'memory', 'little', 'seen', '80', 'horror', 'film', 'called', 'HAPPY', 'BIRTHDAY', 'TO', 'ME', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'reach', 'payoff', 'SHALLOW', 'GROUND', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'welcome', 'return', 'SHALLOW', 'GROUND', 'should', 'not', 'work', 'really', 'map', 'story', 'drive', 'directly', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'focus', 'not', 'focus', 'problem', 'just', 'trappings', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'directors', 'writers', 'think', 'need', 'provide', 'film', 'down.SHALLOW', 'GROUNND', 'solid', 'effective', 'creepy', 'credit', 'sequence', 'mystery', 'head', 'steam', 'right', 'up', 'when', 'actual', 'movie', 'then', 'dead', 'Really', 'love', 'watch', 'guy', 'pack', 'unpack', 'jeep', 'then', 'films', 'first', 'few', 'minuets', 'are', 'luckily', 'film', 'manage', 'ditch', 'boxes', 'dive', 'headlong', 'story', 'films', 'divided', 'focus', 'serial', 'killer', 'track', 'supernatural', 'track', 'supernatural', 'end', 'leaving', 'serial', 'killer', 'side', 'film', 'dust', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'empty', 'spaces', 'scenes', 'run', 'few', 'frames', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'scenes', 'dialouge', 'door', 'open', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'fill', 'void', 'trouble', 'being', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'often', 'top', 'are', 'there', 'best', 'mislead', 'viewer', 'worst', 'exactly', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'when', 'supernatural', 'side', 'story', 'really', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'too', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'SHALLOW', 'GROUND', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'inventive', 'original', 'fingerprint', 'scene', 'stand', 'out', 'here', 'movie', 'really', 'shines', 'direction', 'actually', 'up', 'notch', 'perfomances', 'seem', 'more', 'alive', 'vibrant', 'large', 'amount', 'gore', 'blood', 'oh', 'dude', 'LOT', 'blood', 'never', 'so', 'top', 'simply', 'be', 'just', 'covering', 'hide', 'plot', 'holes', 'kill', 'time', 'Blood', 'so', 'vital', 'SHALLOW', 'GROUND', 'actually', 'character', 'personality', 'purpose', 'Also', 'either', 'choice', 'luck', 'film', 'chance', 'ending', 'mystery', 'supernatural', 'side', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'next', 'epilogue', 'may', 'leave', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'others', 'may', 'want', 'know', 'more.Commentary', 'included', 'deal', 'solid', 'knowledgeable', 'stuck', 'rut', 'explaining', 'shots', 'camerawork', 'music', 'sets', 'lighting', 'locations', 'tech', 'heavy', 'informative', 'grind.Overall', 'SHALLOW', 'GROUND', 'was', 'surprise', 'Better', 'promise', 'box', 'art', 'quotes', 'found', 'how', 'why', 'film', 'compared', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'lost', 'film', 'anything', 'do', 'other', '.Finally', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'ROCKY', 'MARQUETTE', 'who', 'blood', 'soaked', 'mystery', 'boy', 'lot', 'dedication', 'not', 'only', 'appear', 'nude', 'opening', 'credits', 'closing', 'roll', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'painted', 'head', 'toe', 'red', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'kind', 'award']",Shallow Ground

Honestly, I have seen many horror movies in my days - some good, some not-so-good, but few as bad as Shallow Ground. The movie tries too hard to be dramatic with everything other than the story.There are many parts in this movie that are so ridiculous that you would rather burn the movie than return it to the video store and let someone else be tortured by it. For example:When it begins getting dark, we see the sheriff in a cabin loading a shotgun. Very loudly, we hear the wind heavily whistling outside. The wind even blows out the sheriff's lantern when he goes outside. But, and a big but, when the sheriff does go outside we still hear the loud wind but nothing is moving! Nothing! All the trees are perfectly still. There are a few frames in particular where some hanging tree branches are in frame and they are as still as a corpse is dead.You would be better off saving the money you were about to spend on this movie and purchasing sewing needles and sticking them into your eyeballs because it would be more entertaining than watching Shallow Ground.And next time you go through McDonalds, be extra nice to the drive thru employees because they probably took part in making this film.",1,Awful,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,1327,"['Acting', 'DFright', 'Factor', 'DEntertainment', 'value', 'FWhere', 'did', 'get', 'director', 'movie', 'drive', 'thru', 'McDonalds', 'Honestly', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'few', 'as', 'bad', 'Shallow', 'Ground', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'dramatic', 'everything', 'other', 'are', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'rather', 'burn', 'movie', 'return', 'video', 'store', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'be', 'tortured', 'example', 'When', 'getting', 'dark', 'see', 'sheriff', 'cabin', 'loading', 'shotgun', 'Very', 'loudly', 'hear', 'wind', 'heavily', 'whistling', 'outside', 'wind', 'even', 'out', 'sheriff', 'lantern', 'when', 'outside', 'big', 'when', 'sheriff', 'go', 'still', 'hear', 'loud', 'wind', 'nothing', 'moving', 'Nothing', 'trees', 'are', 'perfectly', 'still', 'are', 'few', 'frames', 'particular', 'where', 'hanging', 'tree', 'branches', 'are', 'frame', 'are', 'as', 'still', 'corpse', 'dead.You', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'saving', 'money', 'were', 'about', 'spend', 'movie', 'purchasing', 'sewing', 'needles', 'sticking', 'eyeballs', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'Shallow', 'Ground.And', 'next', 'time', 'go', 'McDonalds', 'be', 'extra', 'nice', 'drive', 'thru', 'employees', 'probably', 'took', 'part', 'making', 'film']",Shallow Ground
