But this BBC version of the story put me to sleep:  the charmingly eccentric members of the Fossils' household are overplayed and campy, and the whole thing is rather claustrophic: with very little in the way of actual dancing (perhaps they were on a limited budget), virtually the whole thing takes place in various drawing rooms at a glacial pace, losing the vigor, wit, and energy of the books - and limiting its appeal to children rather severely.  My dance-obsessed daughter watched for a few minutes, puttered around with her toys, then wandered off.However, if you were a fan of the books, you will probably still want to give it a look.",3,BBC'd into submission,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,801,"['child', 'really', 'loved', 'book', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'three', 'orphan', 'girls', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'dance', 'theatre', 'stars', 'thrilled', 'BBC', 'version', 'story', 'put', 'sleep', 'charmingly', 'eccentric', 'members', 'Fossils', 'household', 'are', 'overplayed', 'campy', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'claustrophic', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'actual', 'dancing', 'perhaps', 'were', 'limited', 'budget', 'virtually', 'whole', 'thing', 'place', 'various', 'drawing', 'rooms', 'glacial', 'pace', 'losing', 'vigor', 'wit', 'energy', 'books', 'limiting', 'appeal', 'children', 'rather', 'severely', 'dance-obsessed', 'daughter', 'watched', 'few', 'minutes', 'puttered', 'toys', 'then', 'wandered', 'off.However', 'were', 'fan', 'books', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'want', 'give', 'look']",Ballet Shoes
272006,A1WNREX300FSHU,6301903412,J. Demers,"[0, 0]","This is the earlier film version of Ballet Shoes. I had seen the newer film first with Emma Watson with more modern film techniques and slightly faster pace, so at first this piece seemed a little bland, but then I was able to separate the two versions and appreciate it for its own sake. This version remains more true to the book, I feel.As for characters and actors, I've read the book and I don't remember Sylvia being quite so flighty and unable to make decisions. Other than that, I liked all of the characters and thought the child actors did very well in their parts.  I did like 2007 version of Posy's character, which was more spirited and bold--the 1975 version of Posy is much more sweet and pretty much faultless, though the actress pulls it off pretty well.",4,Sweet film--recommend it!,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,771,"['earlier', 'film', 'version', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'had', 'seen', 'newer', 'film', 'first', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'more', 'modern', 'film', 'techniques', 'slightly', 'faster', 'pace', 'so', 'first', 'piece', 'seemed', 'little', 'bland', 'then', 'was', 'able', 'separate', 'two', 'versions', 'appreciate', 'own', 'sake', 'version', 'more', 'true', 'book', 'feel.As', 'characters', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Sylvia', 'being', 'quite', 'so', 'flighty', 'unable', 'make', 'decisions', 'Other', 'liked', 'characters', 'thought', 'child', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'parts', 'did', '2007', 'version', 'Posy', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'spirited', 'bold', '1975', 'version', 'Posy', 'much', 'more', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'much', 'faultless', 'actress', 'off', 'pretty', 'well']",Ballet Shoes
