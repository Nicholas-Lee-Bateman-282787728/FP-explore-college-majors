506472,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00000JMOE,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 20]","Shooting at just under two hours, this is one of those films where you nearly feel winded after watching it in its entirety.  Not that it is a ""bad"" thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut.  The lack of air, the ""whoosh"" of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film.  For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the ""originally average"".  This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat.  Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not.  You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music.  This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments.  The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing.  Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it.  It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film.  As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music.  The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant.  She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly ... I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life.  You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers.  You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew.  It just doesn't happen, and why ... because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life.  This latter I blame Anders.  She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film.  Is she a feminist?  Is she as independent as we all thought?  Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes?  These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision.  It is nearly sickening.  While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film.  Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner.  Turturro took his ""bit"" part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen.  He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above.  That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred.  So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get?  Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film.  If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options.  Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film.  I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character.  Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men?  Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others?  Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film?  I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened.  I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film.  It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd.  Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.Grade: ** out of *****",2,What exactly did you like about my record?,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,4909,"['Shooting', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'nearly', 'feel', 'winded', 'watching', 'entirety', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'happening', 'just', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'felt', 'solid', 'blow', 'gut', 'lack', 'air', 'whoosh', 'intense', 'pain', 'increased', 'blurred', 'vision', 'due', 'excitement', 'punch', 'were', 'experiences', 'had', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'sit', 'here', 'claim', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'really', 'beg', 'differ', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'brave', 'advocate', 'originally', 'average', 'were', 'elements', 'completely', 'loved', 'followed', 'suit', 'elements', 'made', 'awaken', 'night', 'pool', 'own', 'sweat', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'was', 'one', 'classic', 'cinematic', 'tug-o-wars', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'stalemate', 'had', 'fans', 'side', 'waiting', 'final', 'results.Beyond', 'cryptic', 'comparisons', 'make', 'above', 'were', 'moments', 'honesty', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'thinking', 'elements', 'worked', 'did', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'film', 'giving', 'Anders', 'credit', 'music', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'survived', 'talent', 'was', 'musical', 'moments', 'energy', 'emotion', 'cultural', 'independence', 'were', 'ravishing', 'Literally', 'could', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'realized', 'set', 'tone', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'viewer', 'could', 'close', 'eyes', 'ignore', 'spoken', 'words', 'film', 'get', 'completely', 'lost', 'music', 'way', 'Anders', 'incorporated', 'established', 'modern', 'singers', 'bring', 'era', '50s', '60s', '70s', 'life', 'were', 'brilliant', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'followed', 'musical', 'footsteps', 'film', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'had', 'firm', 'grip', 'rest', 'story.What', 'mean', 'songs', 'established', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'hurt', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'material', 'presented', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'drag', 'life', 'never', 'quite', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'experiencing', 'sorrows', 'excitements', 'pain', 'man-infested', 'life', 'hers', 'watch', 'go', 'motions', 'never', 'feel', 'tear', 'erupt', 'couch-excitement', 'brew', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'why', '1', 'never', 'course', '20ish', 'years', 'only', 'thinner', 'thinner', '2', 'voice', 'semi-whiney', 'entire', 'film', 'causing', 'feel', 'was', 'bit', 'sour', 'finally', '3', 'consistent', 'need', 'man', 'life', 'latter', 'blame', 'Anders', 'never', 'Waverly', 'character', 'film', 'feminist', 'as', 'independent', 'thought', 'create', 'simply', 'steal', 'other', 'misfortunes', 'are', 'simple', 'questions', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'film', 'instead', 'are', 'nearly', 'forced', 'explode', 'stated', 'before', 'more', 'more', 'information', 'jammed', 'vision', 'nearly', 'sickening', 'Illeana', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'disaster', 'completely', 'own', 'shoulders', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'mold', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'seemed', 'be', 'completely', 'miscast', 'respective', 'roles', 'again', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'immersing', 'vivid', 'story.The', 'only', 'character', 'can', 'give', 'credit', 'towards', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Joel', 'Millner', 'Turturro', 'took', 'bit', 'part', 'new', 'level', 'always', 'giving', 'enough', 'so', 'constantly', 'waited', 'reappear', 'screen', 'was', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'brought', 'more', 'screen', 'other', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'above', 'sad', 'see', 'film', 'caliber', 'what', 'occurred', 'So', 'take', 'grandiose', 'excitement', 'music', 'couple', 'sub-par', 'acting', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'purest', 'form.Overall', 'never', 'good', 'use', 'more', 'one', 'Fonda', 'film', 'find', 'going', 'more', 'one', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'reconsidering', 'options', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'completely', 'ruined', 'film', 'keen', 'eye', 'had', 'blast', 'picking', 'out', 'today', 'artists', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'was', 'developed', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Why', 'did', 'continually', 'fall', 'love', 'wrong', 'men', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'catch', 'creative', 'songs', 'were', 'developed', 'suffering', 'others', 'Finally', 'why', 'did', 'bring', 'up', 'family', 'fortune', 'was', 'never', 'used', 'film', 'kept', 'waiting', 'use', 'family', 'money', 'build', 'climax', 'film', 'never', 'happened', 'felt', 'cheated', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'wallflower', 'cinematic', 'world.Grade', '**', '*****']",Grace of My Heart

506476,A2JAQ6W2EYA1KE,B00000JMOE,"ClassicKol ""Kol""","[6, 6]","A lot to recommend here, Illeana Douglas deserved an Oscar nomination, and much more popular recognition than was forthcoming for her terrific performance in what should have been her breakthrough movie. Her portrayal of Denise Waverly (nee Edna Buxton) is just so RIGHT that it has to be seen rather than droned-on about. But drone on, I must, if it might help let people know there is a lot in this movie to savor.Ms. Douglas is so excellent that it's tempting to overlook good work of other actors in the movie, but i won't.  As the beautiful but snooty British songwriting colleague of Denise's, Patsy Kensit is just perfect, the eventual friendship of the two women unfolds believably and very enjoyably. Douglas and Kensit are terrific in their scenes together.Matt Dillon gave one of his best film performances here, Eric Stoltz and John Turturro were spot-on in roles that seemed to be (loosely) based upon Gerry Goffin and Phil Spector.  The Edna/Denise character clearly has shadings of Carole King, while Dillon's character seems to have more than a tad of Brian Wilson used as inspiration.  Chris Isaak, in a miniscule role, unfortunately, is totally forgettable as Kensit's husband.Recapturing what NYC's  Brill Building may have been like circa 1963, progressing with a satisfying segue into early 70's Los Angeles, the movie hits all the right notes.Members from the girl-group that Denise wrote early hits for nicely weave in and out of the movie, the Patty Duke-esque female teen-star who struggles with her 'Secret Love' provides another memorable segment amongst many.The film may have undone itself by not admitting the not-so-subtle maskings of aspects of the lives of Carole King and Phil Spector.  These 'fictional' characters seem to be a treatment of ""what if Phil Spector had discovered Carole King and then she fell in love with Brian Wilson?' (It is less obvious that the roles of Kensit and Isaak could also be intrepreted as being based upon Mann and Weill, the UK's  answer to King and Goffin in the 1960's).Maybe  'karma' somehow prevented this film from being the huge smash it should have been, only in that if the lives of King, Goffin, Spector and Wilson actually were the inspiration of this movie, it may have been better to be upfront about it.  Yet, the film is so life-affirming, the music so good, the feel of it so resonant, 'Grace Of My Heart' is a success of its own entity.Today in 2007, Motown, Diana Ross, Berry Gordy and Florence Ballard are getting similar treatment with 'Dreamgirls'-- aspects of their lives are used without monetary compensation, changing just enough not to have to pay.  'Dreamgirls' is 2007's ""Grace of My Heart"", with louder box-office ka-ching and some Oscar noise that 'Grace of My Heart' was actually more deserving of.The DVD is a great value for the price, loaded with extras  and a sufficient fold-out booklet.

506483,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00000JMOE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Grace of My Heart (Allison Anders, 1996)Allison Anders spent the early part of her career making little gems that no one saw (with the exception of one film upon which she collaborated with, among others, Quentin Tarantino). Grace of My Heart is one of them, a loosely-fictionalized account of Carole King's career in the Brill Building, writing hit song after hit song for other artists before reaching into herself and drawing on that material for the groundbreaking 1971 album Tapestry, to this day considered one of the best records ever released in America by many critics.Illeana Douglas (Bondage) plays Edna Buxton, a socialite from the Philadelphia suburbs who wins a recording contract in New York. When she gets there, she finds out the whole thing was something of a scam, and finds herself down and out until she meets Joel Millner (John Turturro [Rounders] in what may be one of his finest roles), a producer who renames her Denise Waverly and gets her caught up in writing songs for other artists, and Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz [who would come back and work with Anders again in Things Behind the Sun]), who becomes her songwriting partner, and after a while her husband. The marriage is anything but stable, and Denise's life continues on its rocky path through a succession of friends, lovers, and inevitable heartbreak. Until, that is, Tapestry-- excuse me, Grace of My Heart.What Anders brings to the table is that, while she was obviously going for some sense of the reality underlying the fiction, she never lets it get in the way of telling a good tale. Music historians will find a good deal to munch on where this picture is concerned, but the rest of us can just sit back, chew popcorn, and have a good time without worrying about whether we understood all the in-jokes or not. (Not that that stops us. It seems there's been a debate raging for years over whether Bridget Fonda's character in the movie is a lesbian or not. I don't understand why; isn't it patently obvious?) The primary goal of any good film should be to entertain, and Grace of My Heart delivers. Everything else is just icing on the cake. ****",4,Lovely.,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2139,"['Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'Allison', 'Anders', '1996', 'Allison', 'Anders', 'spent', 'early', 'part', 'career', 'making', 'little', 'gems', 'one', 'saw', 'exception', 'one', 'film', 'collaborated', 'others', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'one', 'loosely-fictionalized', 'account', 'Carole', 'King', 'career', 'Brill', 'Building', 'writing', 'hit', 'song', 'hit', 'song', 'other', 'artists', 'reaching', 'herself', 'drawing', 'material', 'groundbreaking', '1971', 'album', 'Tapestry', 'day', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'records', 'ever', 'released', 'America', 'many', 'critics.Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Bondage', 'Edna', 'Buxton', 'socialite', 'Philadelphia', 'suburbs', 'who', 'recording', 'contract', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'there', 'out', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'something', 'scam', 'down', 'Joel', 'Millner', 'John', 'Turturro', '[', 'Rounders', ']', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'roles', 'producer', 'who', 'Denise', 'Waverly', 'caught', 'up', 'writing', 'songs', 'other', 'artists', 'Howard', 'Caszatt', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', '[', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'work', 'Anders', 'again', 'Things', 'Sun', ']', 'who', 'songwriting', 'partner', 'husband', 'marriage', 'anything', 'stable', 'Denise', 'life', 'rocky', 'path', 'succession', 'friends', 'lovers', 'inevitable', 'heartbreak', 'Tapestry', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart.What', 'Anders', 'table', 'was', 'obviously', 'going', 'sense', 'reality', 'underlying', 'fiction', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'telling', 'good', 'tale', 'Music', 'historians', 'will', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'munch', 'where', 'picture', 'concerned', 'rest', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'chew', 'popcorn', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'worrying', 'understood', 'in-jokes', 'not', 'Not', 'been', 'debate', 'raging', 'years', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'character', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'patently', 'obvious', 'primary', 'goal', 'good', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'entertain', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'Everything', 'else', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', '****']",Grace of My Heart
