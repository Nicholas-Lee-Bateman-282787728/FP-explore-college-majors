It's very entertaining as most fans of the show will agree.  Of course it's just a matter of taste, and I find that many fans of the show like it for various different reasons.  I personally love the show for it's ability to present countless textured skits.  Fantastic direction and artistic input were always present, and they were never afraid of going over the audience's heads.  I believe that The Kids are as bold and intelligent as they are funny, catching even suspecting viewers off gaurd.",5,Great as always,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,631,"['fans', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'will', 'obviously', 'enjoy', 'collection', 'new', 'fans', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'purchase', 'Season', '4', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'entertaining', 'most', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'agree', 'course', 'just', 'matter', 'taste', 'find', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'various', 'different', 'reasons', 'personally', 'love', 'show', 'ability', 'present', 'countless', 'textured', 'skits', 'Fantastic', 'direction', 'artistic', 'input', 'were', 'always', 'present', 'were', 'never', 'afraid', 'going', 'audience', 'heads', 'believe', 'Kids', 'are', 'bold', 'intelligent', 'are', 'funny', 'catching', 'even', 'suspecting', 'viewers', 'gaurd']",N/A
1009773,A2BN6JB7E0N4J5,B000H5U5SA,S. Tak,"[0, 1]","First of all, the good: There are some classic, awesome skits in Season 5, ""Penny"" being a work of genius.  This is definitely the season for ""Bruce"" fans, since you can sense a lot of his odd, offbeat humor here.  Many of the skits are superbly produced, and actually look more well directed than many movies.The bad: I'd still have to say there's quite a few skits that fall short of noteworthy, which is why I can't give this an additional star.  Specific gripes: Scott is hilarious in other people's skits, but often becomes unfunny when he stars in his own material.  Bruce seems to have been allowed to go off on his merry, artistic way, and unfortunately, his artistic journey does not always coincide with ""funny.""  There are attempts by all of them to push the envelope, but maybe it's just a fact that comedy ages, and what might seem shocking back then seems boring now.  I often found myself waiting impatiently for the unfunnier skits to end.There is nothing better than good comedy, and nothing worse than bad comedy.  Season 5 has both.This season beats the lackluster Season 4 for sure, but I'd still have to go with season 1-3 as the creme de la creme of KITH.  If you are a diehard fan, get all 5 seasons.  If you aren't, I'd recommend only the first 3 sets.",4,"I cannot give this 5 stars, but it's still a good season",1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1276,"['First', 'all', 'good', 'are', 'classic', 'awesome', 'skits', 'Season', '5', 'Penny', 'being', 'work', 'genius', 'definitely', 'season', 'Bruce', 'fans', 'can', 'sense', 'lot', 'odd', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'here', 'Many', 'skits', 'are', 'superbly', 'produced', 'actually', 'look', 'more', 'well', 'directed', 'many', 'movies.The', 'bad', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'say', 'quite', 'few', 'skits', 'fall', 'short', 'noteworthy', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'additional', 'star', 'Specific', 'gripes', 'Scott', 'hilarious', 'other', 'people', 'skits', 'often', 'unfunny', 'when', 'own', 'material', 'Bruce', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'go', 'off', 'merry', 'artistic', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'artistic', 'journey', 'not', 'always', 'coincide', 'funny', 'are', 'attempts', 'push', 'envelope', 'just', 'fact', 'comedy', 'ages', 'what', 'might', 'seem', 'shocking', 'back', 'then', 'boring', 'now', 'often', 'found', 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'unfunnier', 'skits', 'end.There', 'nothing', 'better', 'good', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'worse', 'bad', 'comedy', 'Season', '5', 'both.This', 'season', 'lackluster', 'Season', '4', 'sure', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'go', 'season', '1-3', 'creme', 'la', 'creme', 'KITH', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'get', '5', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'recommend', 'only', 'first', '3', 'sets']",N/A
