I've noticed some people here complain somewhat about the second half where it gets alittle serious. But that is part of the wonderful balance of this story. It needed to take a break from the comedy alittle to show the sincerity and soul of these characters.Simply put 'The White Dragon' is a wacky & wonderful movie that doesn't take itself so seriously.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[7, 9]","Perhaps the one flaw with ""wire-fu"" movies is that they tend to take themselves too seriously -- humor is pretty much absent from movies like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" That isn't a problem with ""White Dragon,"" a humorous little action/romance flick that never quite gets serious. Not too much, anyway.Black Pheonix (Cecilia Cheung) is an average airhead schoolgirl -- she thinks about her looks, school, clothes, her looks, the handsome second prince, and her looks. But when the aged hero White Dragon (Nay Suet) is injured, she bestows her powers on Black Pheonix. And a bad case of acne, which White Dragon assures her can be cured by doing good deeds.Pheonix is starting to enjoy her heroic alter ego -- White Dragon Jr. -- when she is called on to capture the blind assassin Chicken Feathers (Francis Ng). But she breaks her leg during the fight, and to her surprise, Chicken Feathers brings her to his home and nurses her back to health. Now Pheonix must make a choice -- save the blind outlaw, or wed the hunky prince?When watching this film, do not take it seriously, unless it wants to be taken seriously. The first half of it is an unabashed joke -- where else could you see an ancient Chinese musician smash her lute, while the audience does the wave? McDonald's, baseball, designer handbags, and Latin pop tunes all get name-dropped over the course of the movie. And when Pheonix gets her powers, a downloading bar appears on the bottom of the screen.The plot sags a bit when Pheonix and Chicken Feathers spend time together at his cottage, and you start wondering when the plot will get moving again. And when it does, some of the humour has gone, as a broken-spirited Chicken Feathers wanders aimlessly through the town. Then it kicks into high gear again, with assassination plots, whirling fight scenes, and a pleasant finale where everything falls into place at last.While there are moments that smack of cutesiness, like the ""my only weak spot is you"" line, the love triangle is a remarkably sweet one -- both Chicken Feathers and the prince are nice guys, and it's easy to see how Pheonix would be torn between them. And some twists are unusually sweet ones, such as the idea of Pheonix's flute music allowing Chicken Feathers to ""see"" the stars.Cheung is the star as a girlish, selfish airhead, who is unexpectedly called on to be a hero -- a sort of selfish Robin Hood (""Please don't scar my face!""), who throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way. Her Pheonix is enormous fun just to watch. But she can also play a more poignant part. And both Ng and Lei Liu give wonderful performances as the rival lovers.Pop-culture martial-arts are the order of the day in ""White Dragon,"" an unabashedly silly comedy that also turns in some poignant romance and solid action.",4,"Flying ""Dragon""",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2803,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'flaw', 'wire-fu', 'movies', 'tend', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'humor', 'pretty', 'much', 'absent', 'movies', 'Hero', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', ""n't"", 'problem', 'White', 'Dragon', 'humorous', 'little', 'action/romance', 'flick', 'never', 'quite', 'serious', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'anyway.Black', 'Pheonix', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'average', 'airhead', 'schoolgirl', 'looks', 'school', 'clothes', 'looks', 'handsome', 'second', 'prince', 'looks', 'when', 'aged', 'hero', 'White', 'Dragon', 'Nay', 'Suet', 'injured', 'powers', 'Black', 'Pheonix', 'bad', 'case', 'acne', 'White', 'Dragon', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'doing', 'good', 'deeds.Pheonix', 'starting', 'enjoy', 'heroic', 'alter', 'ego', 'White', 'Dragon', 'Jr.', 'when', 'called', 'capture', 'blind', 'assassin', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'Francis', 'Ng', 'leg', 'fight', 'surprise', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'home', 'back', 'health', 'Now', 'Pheonix', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'save', 'blind', 'outlaw', 'wed', 'hunky', 'prince', 'When', 'watching', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'first', 'half', 'unabashed', 'joke', 'where', 'else', 'could', 'see', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'musician', 'smash', 'lute', 'audience', 'wave', 'McDonald', 'baseball', 'designer', 'handbags', 'Latin', 'pop', 'tunes', 'get', 'name-dropped', 'course', 'movie', 'when', 'Pheonix', 'powers', 'downloading', 'bar', 'bottom', 'screen.The', 'plot', 'bit', 'when', 'Pheonix', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'cottage', 'start', 'wondering', 'when', 'plot', 'will', 'get', 'moving', 'again', 'when', 'humour', 'gone', 'broken-spirited', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'wanders', 'aimlessly', 'town', 'Then', 'high', 'gear', 'again', 'assassination', 'plots', 'whirling', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pleasant', 'finale', 'where', 'everything', 'place', 'last.While', 'are', 'moments', 'smack', 'cutesiness', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'line', 'love', 'triangle', 'remarkably', 'sweet', 'one', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'prince', 'are', 'nice', 'guys', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'Pheonix', 'would', 'be', 'torn', 'twists', 'are', 'unusually', 'sweet', 'ones', 'such', 'idea', 'Pheonix', 'flute', 'music', 'allowing', 'Chicken', 'Feathers', 'see', 'stars.Cheung', 'star', 'girlish', 'selfish', 'airhead', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'called', 'be', 'hero', 'sort', 'selfish', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'scar', 'face', 'who', 'tantrums', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'Pheonix', 'enormous', 'fun', 'just', 'watch', 'can', 'also', 'play', 'more', 'poignant', 'part', 'Ng', 'Lei', 'Liu', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'rival', 'lovers.Pop-culture', 'martial-arts', 'are', 'order', 'day', 'White', 'Dragon', 'unabashedly', 'silly', 'comedy', 'also', 'poignant', 'romance', 'solid', 'action']",N/A
883661,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0007N1JXC,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[4, 6]","I never expected to discover a martial arts film that was funny. This film is humorous and contains satire along with tremendously effective martial arts scenes. There is a great story line and plot, a romantic love triangle with some tension, beautiful scenery, and great cinematography with long shots of fighting in a bamboo forest, along with very creative photography of fight scenes looking down from the bamboo trees onto the fighters. At times, there is the feeling of a video game in progress because occasionally the acting is somewhat exaggerated to emphasize a specific scene, plus there is the insertion of two crossed swords onto the screen, prior to or during a fight. The music within this film is most enjoyable. Different musical styles accompany various scenes which enhances the feeling and sensitivity of the moment. There is Spanish flamenco music, classical music, some Mediterranean Italian sounding music, and extraordinairy flute playing throughout the film.The characters are developed with great style and creativity. There is Phoenix Black, a pretty and talented female student who plays two musical instruments, the flute and the lute, and dances very sensitively and provocatively. By chance she encounters the blind assassin in the forest, who hears her flute music and is captivated both by her music as well as her fighting skills. Although the assassin is viewed as a criminal, in reality he is doing a service for the community because he only kills corrupt people ... He also shares whatever bounty he collects with the poor.Phoenix encounters the assassin again at her school where Auntie, the cleaning lady (who in reality is a great fighter) ends up nearly being defeated by the assassin. This great elderly lady martial artist's name includes the word ""Dragon"". She suffered near fatal injuries during her fight with the blind assassin, she fears she is dying and quickly downloads her special powers to Phoenix who then becomes ""The White Dragon"". Phoenix fights the assassin on the school grounds where the assassin is even more impressed by her skills and effective powers/techniques. It turns out, the assassin had a goal: to kill the principal of the school who was discovered to have been harassing the female students in a most personal way. The principal signed a confession to this misdeed before he was killed.The students are in an uproar after learning their principal was killed. Two rival cliques of female students huddle together discussing the strange events of the night before. The cook at the school, named Gene, provides some humourous insights into how it is known when the blind assassin strikes. Gene reveals his discovery that there are always chicken feathers left at every crime where the assassin has struck. Gene has studied the matter thoroughly. He even names the types of chickens whose feathers are floating in the air, after the assassin has sruck.After Phoenix plays the lute and performs a very beautiful sensual Chinese dance, she captures the attention of the local King's son, Prince Tian Yong. His father rules the territory and they want to bring the assassin to justice. She has a date with the Prince where besides playing the lute and flute for him, they play tennis and roller skate. Eventually, Phoenix ends up fighting the blind assassin and during one highly stylized martial arts encounter, she fractures a leg. The assassin takes pity on her and brings her to his home located on a beautiful lake. When she plays her flute, he falls in love with her. The blind assassin makes her food, creates crutches for her and even builds a wheelchair from wood. She acts petulant and spoiled. She tricks him into buying paper, pen, and ink which she uses to write letters to Prince Tian that are sent by carrier pigeon. She explains her absence with a white lie, telling him she is on tour performing with the school's music and dance troupe. Eventually, her heart is awakened to the plight of the blind assassin and she wants to know how he became blind. She develops empathy toward him after learning his story which is very sad, sensitive and touching.Despite her tender feelings toward the blind assassin, the plot thickens. Through a highly crafted story-line and via well developed scenes, Phoenix manages to escape from the blind assassin. The assassin is captured by the army of the local warlord/king. Phoenix is torn between trying to save the life of the blind assassin who had treated her so well during captivity or to resume the romance with Prince Tian, who inherited the throne from his father. Prince Tian has become the local ruler - his plans are clear: the blind assassin must be put to death for his crimes. The suspense and drama is immense as Phoenix is forced to choose between the blind assassin and her boyfriend, now the ruler of the realm. Amazingly, chicken feathers provide the the major clue to helping Phoenix resolve her personal conflict and they play a major role in saving the life of the blind assassin. This is a most highly recommended film.

I rented White Dragon on the recommendation from a friend who knew I loved the three previously mentioned movies. I am so glad I rented it. That's four bucks I'll never see again! But at least it wasn't twenty from purchasing this little masterpiece of disaster.Okay, it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen. But it didn't deliver what I was expecting. Basically, it did make me chuckle a bit from time to time, as I asume/hope it was meant to do. Some things were down right hockey. Like ""Downloading"" your skills into someone else's brain and a progress bar shows up at the bottom of the screen. Meant to be funny? Perhaps. But it came off as absolutely hockey.Technically, the movie was obviously low budget. Some of the effects were certainly lacking, but not all together horrible. Some of the fight scenes were meant to be smooth and flowing and ended up a bit choppy. Especially the last scene that should have established the whole movie. More care should have been put into that scene above all and it seemed to be the worst battle scene of the entire movie.Okay, now for the acting. There are two main characters. Chicken feathers, the blind assassin, and White Dragon, his counterpart. I assume the script was a bit weak, but the acting of the blind assassin certainly didn't help with this shortcoming. White Dragon has successfully been in some higher caliber movies and can certainly act. This movie was not her best ever performance.I have to say, however, that after all of this, I am glad I saw this Movie. Why? Well, I am not totally sure. In a strange way, in the back of my mind, I found it nothing more than a bit comical. Even the ending was just too weak.Rent it. Make your own judgment.

In the case of this film the Dragon title goes to the lovely Cecilia Cheung, so as you can see this is a different film. Now with that said I can tell you that this is a very fun film and you should know that going in. I have been around some people expecting this to be some epic because of the cover art. Needless to say they were surprised but they did indeed enjoy once they got that it was a comedy.Black Pheonix (Cecilia Cheung) is just another girl at just another school worrying about average girl stuff. You know friends, herself, and of course boys, one in particular that is, the young prince. Of course she starts to develop a relationship with him when see notices that she has developed acne. As all of this is happening the schools principal is killed in the middle of the night by an assassin, an assassin named ""CHICKEN FEATHERS"".Yes with an intimidating name like that how can one not shiver at the mere sound of a cluck. Any way the first White Dragon is wounded by this assassin and hands the powers of such title over to Pheonix. She eventually learns to love the new abilities she possesses and starts to use them well, until she is called upon. What is she asked to do you might ask, well take out Chicken Feathers of course. So she is off to do battle with him and thus the battle ensues and it is a good one, until. Until her leg is broken in the fight and he takes her in, that is right he takes her in to care for her. This is were the film gets excellent as they go back and forth one upping each other or trying to. The film blossoms from there making it a comedy with a little romance and a whole lot of treachery [you'll see].This is a very fun flick full of humor and some good action as well, more so on the humor part but still good. There are all kinds of pop culture references and a very excellent download bar when she gets her powers, I am telling the truth [I love it]. Also did I mention that the deadly assassin Chicken Feathers is blind, yes very much so but that adds to a lot of the relationship between him and White Dragon. There are moments when the film slows do a little but for the most part it is a cool flick.Cecilia Cheung is delightfully bubbly at times and very angry teen at others, a nice mix that plays out better than it sounds. Francis Ng is great as Chicken Feathers [keep wanting to type fingers] and is deadly/goofy/funny and all that in this role. Written by director Wilson Yip and Yiu Fai Lo the film is not perfect but if you go in understating its style you will like it.

When her beauty fades because she gets the power of the White Dragon, her mentor and former White Dragon tells her the only way to get her beauty restored is to do good deeds... aka rob from the rich and give to the poor. Upon doing this, she decides also to face the man who killed her principal and tried to kill her mentor, Chicken Feathers. She plays her flute for him and he always comes. He is a great fighter... but blind. When they fight the third time (I think), Chicken Feathers brakes White Dragon's leg... accidently but hillariously. So, Chicken Feathers takes White Dragon in his care. She is bossy and hateful to him. Still, he tries to take care of her and please her. What unfolds is laughs and even heartaching times... as he falls for her but she is in love with the Second Prince of her kingdom a man Chicken Feathers is supposed to kill. What will happen?!?!?! I can't tell you or I will ruin it all for you.I will say it is a romantic comedy and it will have you laughing, crying, and feeling good by the end.

The movie then goes from bad to worse, with something approximating the Chinese equivalent of a US high school, but set who-knows-when...The problem with the movie isn't so much the movie itself (though it's pretty bad, if you're not prepared for what it actually is)... The problem is that it's marketed all wrong. By comparing the movie to House of Flying Daggers, a certain expectation is set up that the movie in no way shape or form lives up to.The bottom line on this movie is that it's largely a satire on the martial arts genre. That's fine and all, but attempting to mask that and make the promotional text on the package make it seem like it's in the realm of other high class, artistic, well-written, and moreover SERIOUS martial arts dramas is disingenuous at the minimum.If the packaging had made clear that this is a SPOOF of the martial arts genre, I would be less upset about purchasing it. In fact, I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT just for that (as I happened to be looking for decent spoofs at the time).So, I guess what I'm upset about is that the movie isn't what the box says it is.Now, getting past that, the movie actually has a few rather funny moments (a ""power transfer bar,"" the whole scene rewinding when the heroine asks someone to repeat herself, etc.)... But it's also mixed up with a romantic storyline that tries to be slightly serious. Unfortunately, that puts it at odds with the comedy, and I don't really think it works. If it's going to be funny, and a bit slapstick, it should be funny throughout and not try to redeem itself with romantic drama, etc.I'd class this closer to send-ups likeKung Pow - Enter The Fist,Where Is Mama's Boy, Kung Phooey! andShaolin Soccerthan films with serious artistic / dramatic intent likeCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,Hero,Iron Monkey,Jet Li's Fearless,House of Flying Daggers,The Legend of the Black ScorpionorCurse of the Golden Flower.If you're looking for comedy, try this or the former movies.

After becoming White Dragon junior, she gets her first pimple and this is heartbreaking for her.  Unlike most wuxias, this is more of a comedy.  The dramatic scenes are mostly reserved for Francis Ng who plays an [...] himself named Chicken Feathers.  While he is blind and his character blatantly copies Zatoichi, it still works because Francis Ng is such a great actor.  Chicken Feathers is looking to assassinate the second prince and White Dragon junior loves him so she challenges Chicken Feathers to a duel in order to save the prince.  Chicken Feathers wins quite easily yet doesn't kill her.  WD junior and the former WD now look to outwit him.  She finally realizes Chicken Feathers is a kind person and finds out he isn't quite what he seems to be.This movie is obviously made in the vein of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Hero' and the action is somewhat similiar.  Luckily, they do put some creativity into it and it is quite good.  I don't like ""wire-fu"" that much, except when it's done right like in this movie.  The action is very sparse, but good when it happens.What makes this so different is the odd comedy and mixing in modern day life like rollerblading.  The modern day injected moments don't work, but I liked the comedy very much.  There is a scene at the beginning of the movie that is hilarious where WD junior is playing various instuments and ends her show by slamming a stringed instrument up against a wall like Jimi Hendrix.  I also loved the scene where Chicken Feathers finds out he is good looking.The first 30 minutes are exciting, but the rest of the movie I found hard to sit through.  I loved the comedy, but there is not enought of it.  The movie just moves along too slow and has a hard time deciding whether it wants to be comedic or serious.  The boredom is interrupted by the great acting of Francis Ng a few times, but not enough.2.5/5The DVD from Sony Entertainment has perfect picture quality and good 5.1 Cantonese audio.  It also has an English and French dub in 5.1 which I didn't listen to.
