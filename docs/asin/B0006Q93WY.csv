The guy playing Michael looks like SheNaynay from In Living Color. In drag. It's really bad. It has bad acting,  a dumb story line, lack of facts, is stupid, boring, and very negative. Makes Michael look like a retarded person. Wow VH1, didn't know you could go so low. You can tell they had a real bad attitude towards Michael and totally didn't see him at all, just the lying media junk from the 90's.

872162,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0006Q93WY,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[2, 2]","Folks, this is a VH1 TV-movie. Do not expect ""Gone With The Wind"" here. It's actually closer to Ed Wood (of Glen or Glenda and Plan 9/Grave Robbers from Outer Space infamy).Flex is a tad ridiculous as the King of Pop, but he does manage to make you feel for him and MJ. Much of the film is based on fact, although out of sequence (as is common with biopics to make a better story).The ending (this film was made during the second MJ alleged child molestation trial) was a tad premature. The producers should have waited until the trial concluded before making this film, which would have made for a more satisfyling ending.One gets the impression that there was a lot cut from the film, as the Diana Ross sequence that is repeated throughout much of the film is out of synch with events as the film describes them. The actress playing Janet Jackson, while making her sweet and sympathetic, takes some time to make you realize who she is portraying. The Joe and Katherine Jackson portrayers do a very good job, though, but the Liz Taylor caricature is WAY over the top and it makes one wonder if the grand dame of classic Hollywood ever sicced her lawyers on them.Watch it with some beers and pizza with your buddies. Leave your brains a the door. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll be alright. It makes for some good unintended comedy in spots. Yes, its BAD, but in a goofy and entertaining way. At least its better that the abominable Pearl Jr. videos on MJ.",3,Michael Jackson meets Ed Wood,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,1464,"['Folks', 'VH1', 'TV-movie', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'here', 'actually', 'closer', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Glen', 'Glenda', 'Plan', '9/Grave', 'Robbers', 'Outer', 'Space', 'infamy', '.Flex', 'tad', 'ridiculous', 'King', 'Pop', 'manage', 'make', 'feel', 'MJ', 'Much', 'film', 'based', 'fact', 'sequence', 'common', 'biopics', 'make', 'better', 'story', '.The', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'second', 'MJ', 'alleged', 'child', 'molestation', 'trial', 'was', 'tad', 'premature', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'waited', 'trial', 'concluded', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'satisfyling', 'ending.One', 'impression', 'was', 'lot', 'cut', 'film', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'much', 'film', 'synch', 'events', 'film', 'actress', 'playing', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'making', 'sweet', 'sympathetic', 'time', 'make', 'realize', 'who', 'portraying', 'Joe', 'Katherine', 'Jackson', 'portrayers', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'though', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'caricature', 'WAY', 'top', 'one', 'wonder', 'grand', 'dame', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'sicced', 'lawyers', 'them.Watch', 'beers', 'pizza', 'buddies', 'Leave', 'brains', 'door', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'be', 'alright', 'good', 'unintended', 'comedy', 'spots', 'Yes', 'BAD', 'goofy', 'entertaining', 'way', 'least', 'better', 'abominable', 'Pearl', 'Jr.', 'videos', 'MJ']",Man in the Mirror - The Michael Jackson Story

872166,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0006Q93WY,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[7, 9]","It was summer of 2004.  Somewhere in the season marks a day of travesty, and people who have seen it are either scared for life...or decided to take that memory of absurdity and throw it out the window.  Even if you're a fan, there's something wrong with this picture.  Hence this tv-movie I'm going to review, ""Man In The Mirror.""~R3VI3W~Months ago, I was watching Vh1 when they played a made-for-tv movie display the good side of Jacko, ""Man In The Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story"", and boy, it's about as ugly as Michael Jackson's mugshot.  Vh1 is the channel known for satirical tv segments and ""I love the decades"" laugh-a-thons, but this movie, the company is ACTUALLY being serious; SHOCKING!  Even though made-for-tv movies are the lowest-common-denominators of filmography outside of HBO, some of those movies have gotten some ideas right.  No chance of finding the right idea here, and I'm better of just smashing a mirror than watching it.The things about this movie could've been promosing:Having a covincing-looking actor to play Michael Jackson?...nope.Oh well, since this is a MJ movie, can the movie have licensed MJ songs playing the music score?...forget it.At least the movie is a biopic on MJ's problems, right?  That's right, and it's as generic as it comes.Considering this the indirect sequel/spin-off of ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"", this movie is about what people should already know about Jacko through gossip magazines and ET.  After becoming independent from his abusive father, MJ does whatever music artist does to gain popular status: reinventing himself.  And by revinventing himself, I mean carving his nose and cover his vitiligo skin with ivory lotion due to the commerical incident (Thanks, Pepsi), following by building a theme park of his childhood dreams.  Eventually, his career goes into a downward spiral due to copyright lawsuits and the ever-popular, and current, child-molesting charges.This could've work, because this movie's showing the innocent side of michael that some people are too prejudice to see.  Unfortunately, too many distractions occur to take this seriously.  I must meet the people of this movie's makeup department, so I can beat them up for doing an insulting job on the cast.  None of the cast look much like their real counterparts, and then there's the guy who played Mike.  Who thought smearing flour on his face instantly makes him MJ?  Not only is this the worse make-up job since ""White Chicks"", they don't seem to get the memo WHEN they're suppose to do a lousy job; if the real MJ was more light-skinned and carved in 1987, the actor playing him should also look more light-skinned and carved during that era!Acting-wise...well, it's as convincing as the make-up job. I'm sure the Jacko actor had some convincing lines, but it didn't help for the whole one-dimensional vibe of the roles.  Another thing that annoyed me, besides the make up, is the rushed pacing.  Scenes are over way too sudden, and some didn't take the time for the scenarios to be fleshed out, especially the scene when Micheal meets the nurse and had children; that scene didn't take the time to add character on the nurse.  I felt the movie was in a hurry to get this finish, the same way I felt when watching this.Speaking as a fan of his music, ""Man in the Mirror"" is a passable movie that could've been treated way better, even for a tv flick.  This movie would work if the cast were believable, the scenes weren't so rushed, and it would have actual MJ music in it (it worked for the MC Hammer tv movie); none of that happened, so it all falls apart in the process.  The only tv movie besides ""Man In The Mirror"" that would've deal with much more failure is ""Zolar""...and I still can't believe that movie made it on DVD.  So what if this movie did a good job at being sympathetic towards MJ...that's not enough.FIN/\L WORDS: Avoid this like you avoid taking your children to Neverland Valley.",1,What a broken mirror this is,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3949,"['was', 'summer', '2004', 'Somewhere', 'season', 'day', 'travesty', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'either', 'scared', 'life', 'decided', 'take', 'memory', 'absurdity', 'throw', 'out', 'window', 'Even', ""'re"", 'fan', 'something', 'wrong', 'picture', 'Hence', 'tv-movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'Man', 'Mirror', '~R3VI3W~Months', 'ago', 'was', 'watching', 'Vh1', 'when', 'played', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'good', 'side', 'Jacko', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Story', 'boy', 'as', 'ugly', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'mugshot', 'Vh1', 'channel', 'known', 'satirical', 'tv', 'segments', 'love', 'decades', 'laugh-a-thons', 'movie', 'company', 'ACTUALLY', 'being', 'serious', 'SHOCKING', 'Even', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'are', 'lowest-common-denominators', 'filmography', 'HBO', 'movies', 'have', 'gotten', 'ideas', 'right', 'chance', 'finding', 'right', 'idea', 'here', ""'m"", 'better', 'just', 'smashing', 'mirror', 'watching', 'it.The', 'things', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'promosing', 'Having', 'covincing-looking', 'actor', 'play', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'nope.Oh', 'well', 'MJ', 'movie', 'can', 'movie', 'have', 'licensed', 'MJ', 'songs', 'playing', 'music', 'score', 'forget', 'it.At', 'least', 'movie', 'biopic', 'MJ', 'problems', 'right', 'right', 'as', 'generic', 'comes.Considering', 'indirect', 'sequel/spin-off', 'Jacksons', 'American', 'Dream', 'movie', 'what', 'people', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'Jacko', 'gossip', 'magazines', 'ET', 'becoming', 'independent', 'abusive', 'father', 'MJ', 'music', 'artist', 'gain', 'popular', 'status', 'reinventing', 'revinventing', 'mean', 'carving', 'nose', 'cover', 'vitiligo', 'skin', 'ivory', 'lotion', 'due', 'commerical', 'incident', 'Thanks', 'Pepsi', 'following', 'building', 'theme', 'park', 'childhood', 'dreams', 'Eventually', 'career', 'downward', 'spiral', 'due', 'copyright', 'lawsuits', 'ever-popular', 'current', 'child-molesting', 'charges.This', 'could', ""'ve"", 'work', 'movie', 'showing', 'innocent', 'side', 'michael', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'prejudice', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'many', 'distractions', 'occur', 'take', 'seriously', 'must', 'meet', 'people', 'movie', 'makeup', 'department', 'can', 'beat', 'up', 'doing', 'insulting', 'job', 'cast', 'None', 'cast', 'look', 'much', 'real', 'counterparts', 'then', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Mike', 'Who', 'thought', 'smearing', 'flour', 'face', 'instantly', 'MJ', 'Not', 'only', 'worse', 'make-up', 'job', 'White', 'Chicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'memo', 'WHEN', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'do', 'lousy', 'job', 'real', 'MJ', 'was', 'more', 'light-skinned', 'carved', '1987', 'actor', 'playing', 'should', 'also', 'look', 'more', 'light-skinned', 'carved', 'era', 'Acting-wise', 'well', 'as', 'convincing', 'make-up', 'job', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Jacko', 'actor', 'had', 'convincing', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'whole', 'one-dimensional', 'vibe', 'roles', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'make', 'up', 'rushed', 'pacing', 'Scenes', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'sudden', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'scenarios', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'especially', 'scene', 'when', 'Micheal', 'nurse', 'had', 'children', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'add', 'character', 'nurse', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'hurry', 'get', 'finish', 'same', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'watching', 'this.Speaking', 'fan', 'music', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'passable', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'treated', 'way', 'better', 'even', 'tv', 'flick', 'movie', 'would', 'work', 'cast', 'were', 'believable', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'rushed', 'would', 'have', 'actual', 'MJ', 'music', 'worked', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'tv', 'movie', 'none', 'happened', 'apart', 'process', 'only', 'tv', 'movie', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'would', ""'ve"", 'deal', 'much', 'more', 'failure', 'Zolar', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'made', 'DVD', 'So', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'MJ', 'not', 'enough.FIN/\\L', 'WORDS', 'Avoid', 'avoid', 'taking', 'children', 'Neverland', 'Valley']",Man in the Mirror - The Michael Jackson Story

As everyone knows, Jackson's musical exploits had already been documented in the authorized and highly-sanitized AN AMERICAN FAMILY mini-series, so it's refreshing that VH-1's MAN IN THE MIRROR keeps the musical interludes to a minimum and devotes the majority of its running-time to the more compelling human story of the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop's unprecedented implosion.

I'm pretty sure there's some actual news reel footage sprinkled throughout (the ""Blanket Balcony Blunder,"" comments and clips from various Jackson family members), lending an authenticity to the film that is by turns poignant and disturbing.So why a four and not a five-star review?  Well, this being a Paramount release, the disc is light on extras and the picture is a tad soft.  Jackson's ever-changing appearance no doubt presented a formidable challenge to the makeup department as well as the film's cinematographer, and frankly I was expecting the picture to have more ""pop"" in contrasting the ""Thriller-era"" Michael with the bleached, ""Marcel Marceau"" Michael of the ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"" years.  Oh well, perhaps when this hits blu-ray such flaws will be corrected, and with interest in Jackson's lurid legacy at an all-time high, VH-1 may even deliver a sequel to pair with this film and the original mini-series -- a sprawling and exhaustive trilogy worthy of the MAN IN THE MIRROR himself!",4,Daring and Compelling -- the Definitive Film Portrait,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,1934,"['be', 'honest', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'puff-piece', 'would', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIRROR', 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'deliver', 'definitive', 'film', 'portrait', 'Jackson', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'clamoring', 'everyone', 'Jackson', 'musical', 'exploits', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'documented', 'authorized', 'highly-sanitized', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'FAMILY', 'mini-series', 'refreshing', 'VH-1', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIRROR', 'musical', 'interludes', 'minimum', 'majority', 'running-time', 'more', 'compelling', 'human', 'story', 'Self-Proclaimed', 'King', 'Pop', 'unprecedented', 'implosion', 'Starring', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIRROR', 'unlikely', 'Flex', 'Alexander', 'who', 'inappropriately', 'bulky', 'frame', 'deliver', 'sincere', 'memorable', 'portrayal', 'pitch-perfect', 'conversational', 'tone', 'wild', 'eyes', 'expressions', 'shocked', 'indignation', 'few', 'performers', 'have', 'captured', 'subject', 'so', 'well', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'actual', 'news', 'reel', 'footage', 'sprinkled', 'Blanket', 'Balcony', 'Blunder', 'comments', 'clips', 'various', 'Jackson', 'family', 'members', 'lending', 'authenticity', 'film', 'turns', 'poignant', 'disturbing.So', 'why', 'four', 'not', 'five-star', 'review', 'Well', 'being', 'Paramount', 'release', 'disc', 'light', 'extras', 'picture', 'tad', 'soft', 'Jackson', 'ever-changing', 'appearance', 'doubt', 'presented', 'formidable', 'challenge', 'makeup', 'department', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'frankly', 'was', 'expecting', 'picture', 'have', 'more', 'pop', 'contrasting', 'Thriller-era', 'Michael', 'bleached', 'Marcel', 'Marceau', 'Michael', 'Bad', 'Dangerous', 'years', 'Oh', 'well', 'perhaps', 'when', 'blu-ray', 'such', 'flaws', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'interest', 'Jackson', 'lurid', 'legacy', 'all-time', 'high', 'VH-1', 'may', 'even', 'deliver', 'sequel', 'pair', 'film', 'original', 'mini-series', 'sprawling', 'exhaustive', 'trilogy', 'worthy', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIRROR']",Man in the Mirror - The Michael Jackson Story

MJ's behavior is never explained, just depicted, such as his obsession with plastic surgery.Flex Alexander did an excellent job portraying Michael Jackson, although I question the interpretation of MJ's character. Here MJ is portrayed as an innocent trapped in a cruel, unimaginative adult world, an unsuspecting, too-trusting Peter Pan. Jackson is also known as cold, manipulative, and a shrewd businessman, which was absent in Alexander's portrayal of Jackson.  I would have liked to seen a more rounded presentation of MJ, showing all facets of his personality.The makeup on Alexander when he depicts Jackson later in life is horrendous. In some scenes ( for example the 1993-95 MJ), the makeup looks greenish. For the current MJ, the makeup looks grayish-white. Still, Flex Alexander's acting manages to rise above the bad makeup, resulting in a sympathetic albeit one-sided portrayal of the King of Pop.Frederic Tucker as Joe Jackson captures his unmitigated bullying and harshness. Lynne Cormack as Elizabeth Taylor is a hoot, but still very likeable. Cedric DeSousa was a great piece of casting as Martin Bashir--he looks and sounds like the guy. April Telek did not capture Debbie Rowe's brash, blunt personality at all. She is much too pretty and soft in the role.There's several kitschy dream sequences, but they work fairly well here. It is as if the viewer is inside MJ's mind, viewing the world as he sees it.All in all, the movie is entertaining and worth purchasing. I've watched it several times already.

It wasn't clear on the DVD what this really was, so I was suprised to see that it was kind of like a rip off of ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"" tv movie which was excellent.  Well, I was rather disappointed and thought the movie sucked.  But the amazing thing was that the movie actually got better as it progressed.  Then watching it the second time around was more enjoyable because I knew what to expect.  The make-up of MJ when he turned white was rather bad, I could tell it was some Halloween mickey mouse type of make-up.  And MJ's nose is too big.  It seemed to get slimmer when they showed him in recent years, starting in 2001 or so, but in real life, his nose got really slim in 1986 before the ""Bad"" album came out and it progressed to get slimmer as the years went by.  If they had a bigger budget they could of used cgi to make his nose slim, but  this was really low budget.  I also thought that MJ was a bit too bulky, kind of buff.  The real MJ is skin and bones practically, even during the ""Thriller"" days.  Anyway, this is kind of a sequel to ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"", and you know that sequels usually suck.  Well, I'm a huge MJ fan, so I am starting to like this movie.  The actress for Liz Taylor is horrible, and the guy playing Martin Bashir seems a little to flakey and smiles too much and he doesn't sound British.  The Lisa Marie Presley character was pretty good, so were MJ's parents.  Janet looked too skinny, she was chubby in the '80s.  It's funny how they showed the real interview with Latoya, because she looked more like MJ then the guy playing MJ in the movie.

872184,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0006Q93WY,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 1]","Man In The Mirror was made for VH1 in 2004 and is sort of a continuation of the acclaimed The Jacksons: An American Dream. It picks up where An American Dream ends, right after the Victory tour and focuses on Michael's solo career and all the events and controversy that surrounded him up prior to the film airing on television. Unlike An American Dream, Man In The Mirror is heavily criticized and it's easy to see why, it really comes off as a cheap version of the Michael Jackson story that puts too much emphasis on the bad events and the heart isn't there. It feels like a quick work for the buck and ultimately that's what it ended up being and why so many fans despise it. On the good Flex Alexander has actually somewhat of a resemblance to Michael (especially around Thriller but I still think he looks more like his brother, Jermaine), and he comes off alright overall; it's only with the white pancake makeup of the latter years that he looks completely silly. The actress who played Lisa Marie had some resemblance to her and I think she delivered the best acting of the movie. I thought it was a shame that the Bad era was almost completely ignored (in the movie Michael says he wants a new look and that's it, he gets the bad era look then it's off almost straight to the 1993 accusations). It's not all accurate either, Michael new Lisa Marie Presley since she was little and in the movie they meet far latter. Am I the only one who thought the actor who played Michael's father, Joe Jackson, doesn't look anything like Joe and is far too short to be believable?This is definitely not worth purchasing, maybe a viewing if you're a REALLY curious or hardcore MJ fan but otherwise it's a completely forgettable movie and what's sad is nearly every bad thing that happened to Michael is in the film (Pepsi commercial incident, Vitiligo, 1993 Trial, 2003 Berlin incident.... ) and is heavily focused on but there's practically nothing of him writing, composing or performing music. Very little of his family too. For you money the very best documentary on Michael Jackson and his career is without a doubt The Jacksons: An American Dream which has a serious approach, good acting, performances,  has heart and genuinely makes an effort to be entertaining (although it is mostly about The Jackson family and The Jackson 5 and not just Michael, it's a fantastic look at the artists and a dream of a documentary for fans at over 5 hours and is very detailed and complete). Man In The Mirror is a huge let down. The worst part is that there is actually NO Michael Jackson song for a film on Michael Jackson. Flex's performance is not horrible, certainly not great and it is a cheesy movie but he seemed into it and he put effort but the surrounding cast, the poorly written script and many other factors do not help him or his performance in any way. His transformations for the different MJ looks is funny to watch. The very lowest of the low, a 1 star rating it's very campy and cheesy, it ends up being unintentionally funny a few times and I can't see any MJ fan actually liking this dud.",1,As bad as they say it is,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,3099,"['Man', 'Mirror', 'was', 'made', 'VH1', '2004', 'sort', 'continuation', 'acclaimed', 'Jacksons', 'American', 'Dream', 'up', 'where', 'American', 'Dream', 'ends', 'right', 'Victory', 'tour', 'Michael', 'solo', 'career', 'events', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'up', 'prior', 'film', 'airing', 'television', 'American', 'Dream', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'really', 'off', 'cheap', 'version', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'bad', 'events', 'heart', ""n't"", 'there', 'quick', 'work', 'buck', 'ultimately', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'despise', 'good', 'Flex', 'Alexander', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'resemblance', 'Michael', 'especially', 'Thriller', 'still', 'think', 'more', 'brother', 'Jermaine', 'off', 'alright', 'overall', 'only', 'white', 'pancake', 'makeup', 'latter', 'years', 'completely', 'silly', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'had', 'resemblance', 'think', 'delivered', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'shame', 'Bad', 'era', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignored', 'movie', 'Michael', 'new', 'look', 'bad', 'era', 'look', 'then', 'off', 'almost', 'straight', '1993', 'accusations', 'not', 'accurate', 'Michael', 'new', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'Presley', 'was', 'little', 'movie', 'meet', 'far', 'latter', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Michael', 'father', 'Joe', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'Joe', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'believable', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'maybe', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'REALLY', 'curious', 'hardcore', 'MJ', 'fan', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'what', 'sad', 'nearly', 'bad', 'thing', 'happened', 'Michael', 'film', 'Pepsi', 'commercial', 'incident', 'Vitiligo', '1993', 'Trial', '2003', 'Berlin', 'incident', 'heavily', 'focused', 'practically', 'nothing', 'writing', 'composing', 'performing', 'music', 'Very', 'little', 'family', 'too', 'money', 'very', 'best', 'documentary', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'career', 'doubt', 'Jacksons', 'American', 'Dream', 'serious', 'approach', 'good', 'acting', 'performances', 'heart', 'genuinely', 'effort', 'be', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'Jackson', 'family', 'Jackson', '5', 'not', 'just', 'Michael', 'fantastic', 'look', 'artists', 'dream', 'documentary', 'fans', '5', 'hours', 'very', 'detailed', 'complete', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'worst', 'part', 'actually', 'NO', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'song', 'film', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Flex', 'performance', 'not', 'horrible', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'seemed', 'put', 'effort', 'surrounding', 'cast', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'many', 'other', 'factors', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'performance', 'way', 'transformations', 'different', 'MJ', 'funny', 'watch', 'very', 'lowest', 'low', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'very', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'up', 'being', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'few', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'MJ', 'fan', 'actually', 'liking', 'dud']",Man in the Mirror - The Michael Jackson Story

I am one of those MJ fans who enjoy everything connected to Jackson so I may not be very objective. The physical portraits of the characters are pretty poor in this film but the plot follows Michael's life just as it was up to this day. The movie is very informative. For instance, I never knew MJ was a vegetarian until I heard it in this movie. You won't recognize Elizabeth Taylor until they mention her name. Don't buy this movie, just rent it, see it once.",3,Informative and fun to watch!,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,576,"['movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'will', 'frame', 'hang', 'wall', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'am', 'one', 'MJ', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoy', 'everything', 'connected', 'Jackson', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'objective', 'physical', 'portraits', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'poor', 'film', 'plot', 'Michael', 'life', 'just', 'was', 'up', 'day', 'movie', 'very', 'informative', 'instance', 'never', 'knew', 'MJ', 'was', 'vegetarian', 'heard', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'mention', 'name', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'just', 'rent', 'see', 'once']",Man in the Mirror - The Michael Jackson Story
