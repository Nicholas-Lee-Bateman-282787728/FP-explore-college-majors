I love this show, I continue to watch this and I'm still shocked by all the stuff this show gets away with. My favorite episodes from season 2 include: Closure Pt. 2, Baby Killer, Abuse, Folly, and Scourge. I highly recommend purchasing season two, definitely one of the best seasons (season 4 is my fave).

I too don't understand why Universal released Season 5 after Season 1, but when I discovered that Season 2 was finally out, I scooped it right up because that's the point where the show went from good to great.What really made the show better was the addition of three actors: Stephanie March as ADA Alexandra Cabot, Ice-T as Detective Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola, and B.D. Wong as psychiatrist Dr. George Huang (even though he wasn't too likable initially). I knocked a star off my rating because I didn't care for the episodes ""Asunder"" or ""Abuse"", but overall, everything is impressive. This show is so successful that it even surpassed the original Law & Order in popularity. What does that tell you? While you're waiting for your copy of this to come in the mail, catch new episodes of SVU on NBC or reruns on USA.Anthony Rupert",4,This is where the show really took off,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,940,"['first', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'had', 'moments', 'comparison', 'rest', 'series', 'run', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Universal', 'released', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '1', 'when', 'discovered', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'finally', 'scooped', 'right', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'show', 'went', 'good', 'great.What', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'better', 'was', 'addition', 'three', 'actors', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'ADA', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'Ice-T', 'Detective', 'Odafin', 'Fin', 'Tutuola', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'George', 'Huang', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'likable', 'initially', 'knocked', 'star', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'episodes', 'Asunder', 'Abuse', 'overall', 'everything', 'impressive', 'show', 'so', 'successful', 'even', 'surpassed', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'popularity', 'What', 'tell', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'copy', 'come', 'mail', 'catch', 'new', 'episodes', 'SVU', 'NBC', 'reruns', 'USA.Anthony', 'Rupert']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year

923339,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B000A7DW7Q,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","In the second season of Special Victims Unit we see as two detectives struggle to keep their jobs and we see a few new additions to the cast as well as recurring characters. First off there is Assistant District Attorney Alex Cabot, the first series regular from the DA's office. Every case SVU detectives close gets handed to Cabot in the DA's office Special Victims Unit. Now we see what a Sex Crimes prosecutor must go through when it's their turn to handle these sensitive cases of terrorized woman and children. Also joining the team is Detective Odafin Tutuola, a transfer from Narcotics. He eventually becomes Munch's new partner and this season is the best one that portrays their contrasting partnership. The skeptic liberal and the Narc Republican. This is my favorite Ice-T season, because I felt his character kept losing some depth every season onward except for a few the episodes that would focus on him. I sure wish he'd wear that suit again. Also there Tamara Tunie who plays Dr. Warner from time to time as a guest before becoming a regular in season 7-12. Also we see B.D Wong as Dr. George Huang from the FBI. His characteristics differs much in his first appearance form later ones. This season is what the show should have been about. The detectives investigating this vicious felonies and their lives on and off the job. Captain Cragen seemed like he used his authority a bit more prominently than in latter seasons, pointing out his Detectives' flaws and putting them in their place when they go out of line. He treats them with respect but he expects them to follow his orders as well as those above him in the chain of command. You can see as this show starts off as what it was when left at season 1 and slowly turn into the show Neal Baer has made it in the 11 seasons during his time as showrunner. The season opener is probably the best in the series until seasons 13 and 14 and I would most likely put it in a list of the top 5 openers in the Law & Order franchise. The second year is everything you've came to expect from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and more.

Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[1, 1]","Ok so the double-sided disks took a bit of getting used to but it wasn't worth knocking a star off the score. And since they played without any difficulty whatsoever I definitely feel it's worth 5 stars.Season two of SVU picks up right where the season one cliffhanger ended. In Wrong is Right, Stabler's daughter Maureen accidentally catches a horrifying glimpse of a recently murdered man whose body appeared to have been set on fire. Meanwhile, Captain Cragen is faced with the consequences of the psychologist's recommendation. We are first introduced to Odafin (Fin) Tutuola, Munch's more or less permanent partner,, in this episode. In Honor, the detectives find themselves investigating the rape/murder of an Afghan diplomat's daughter, during which they discover certain dictates of Taliban beliefs that condone honor killings if a child goes against the wishes of his or her family. In Closure part 2, Harper Anderson, the rape victim from part 1, disgusted by the SVU's failure to convict him, decides to follow her accused rapist, ultimately with devastating consequences. In Baby Killer, the SVU investigates the shooting death of a young girl on a school playground. in Legacy, the SVU investigates a family when their comatose daughter is brought into the hospital. With at least two possible suspects, the detectives ultimately crack the case to a disturbing revelation. In Noncompliance, the investigation into the rape/murder of a young woman turns into a heated debate about patients' rights when the prime suspect, a young Schizophrenic man, refuses to take medication. In Taken, the SVU investigates the rape of agirl during the festivities celebrating the opening of a luxury hotel. But as they dig for further information, the truth they discover reveals that the situation is far from what it appears.Other standout episodes include Pixies, in which a young gymnast is found raped and murdered, and the SVU find themselves contending with multiple suspects including the girls' strict trainer, a wealthy benefactor who seemed to have a special thing for the victim and one of her competitors, this last seemingly having a personal grudge against her. In Consent, the investigation into the rape of a young colege student and the subsequent discovery that she had a homemade date rape drug in her system turns into a debate about what constitutes consent. In Abuse, the tragic death of the son of two famous singers sparks an investigation into whether or not their young daughter is being abused by her parents. Unfortunately, the girl's parents, not liking their daughter's attachment to one of the SVU detectives, take out a restraining order against the entire unit. In Paranoia, Benson's former mentor is raped and the crime is first linked to her x husband's gambling debts and then to her fellow officers. In Countdown, the detectives race against time to save an abducted girl from a serial killer who kills his victims on the third day. In Manhunt, the detectives investigate the recent abduction of a waitress and are reminded of a series of unsolved rapes and murders with a disturbingly similar Motus Operandi. In Pique, the SVU must investigate the stabbing death of a software company employee with the help of Dr. George Huang, an FBI agent and psychology expert who subsequently becomes an invaluable asset to the team. The trail leads to a fired colleague and a disturbing truth about the nature of his relationship with his overbearing mother. The season ends with Scourge, in which the detectives must track down a serial killer who justifies his actions with religious paranoia, which they discover was brought on by a rapidly deteriorating medical condition. This of course complicates matters since it forces not only the SVU detectives themselves but ADA Kabot as well to make the difficult decision of whether to administer the death penalty in response to public opinion or honor the request of a mother and her children.Also included on this DVD set is a short Sesame Street sketch in which some of the SVU detectives take a break from catching rapists to track down the missing letter M. Of course each disk also features deleted scenes from the episodes it contains. So once again, an excellent season. Of course there's no shortage of cast interviews, all of wich are extremely interesting. Needless to say, I can't wait to get my grubby little paws on the rest of the series.",5,Even better than the first one.,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,4427,"['Ok', 'double-sided', 'disks', 'took', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'knocking', 'star', 'score', 'played', 'difficulty', 'whatsoever', 'definitely', 'feel', 'worth', '5', 'stars.Season', 'two', 'SVU', 'picks', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'cliffhanger', 'ended', 'Wrong', 'Right', 'Stabler', 'daughter', 'Maureen', 'accidentally', 'horrifying', 'glimpse', 'recently', 'murdered', 'man', 'body', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'fire', 'Meanwhile', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'faced', 'consequences', 'psychologist', 'recommendation', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'Odafin', 'Fin', 'Tutuola', 'Munch', 'more', 'less', 'permanent', 'partner', 'episode', 'Honor', 'detectives', 'find', 'investigating', 'rape/murder', 'Afghan', 'diplomat', 'daughter', 'discover', 'certain', 'dictates', 'Taliban', 'beliefs', 'condone', 'honor', 'killings', 'child', 'wishes', 'family', 'Closure', 'part', '2', 'Harper', 'Anderson', 'rape', 'victim', 'part', '1', 'disgusted', 'SVU', 'failure', 'convict', 'follow', 'accused', 'rapist', 'ultimately', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'Baby', 'Killer', 'SVU', 'shooting', 'death', 'young', 'girl', 'school', 'playground', 'Legacy', 'SVU', 'family', 'when', 'comatose', 'daughter', 'brought', 'hospital', 'least', 'two', 'possible', 'suspects', 'detectives', 'ultimately', 'crack', 'case', 'disturbing', 'revelation', 'Noncompliance', 'investigation', 'rape/murder', 'young', 'woman', 'heated', 'debate', 'patients', 'rights', 'when', 'prime', 'suspect', 'young', 'Schizophrenic', 'man', 'take', 'medication', 'Taken', 'SVU', 'rape', 'agirl', 'festivities', 'celebrating', 'opening', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'dig', 'further', 'information', 'truth', 'discover', 'reveals', 'situation', 'far', 'what', 'standout', 'episodes', 'include', 'Pixies', 'young', 'gymnast', 'found', 'raped', 'murdered', 'SVU', 'find', 'contending', 'multiple', 'suspects', 'including', 'girls', 'strict', 'trainer', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'special', 'thing', 'victim', 'one', 'competitors', 'last', 'seemingly', 'having', 'personal', 'grudge', 'Consent', 'investigation', 'rape', 'young', 'colege', 'student', 'subsequent', 'discovery', 'had', 'homemade', 'date', 'rape', 'drug', 'system', 'debate', 'what', 'consent', 'Abuse', 'tragic', 'death', 'son', 'two', 'famous', 'singers', 'sparks', 'investigation', 'not', 'young', 'daughter', 'being', 'abused', 'parents', 'Unfortunately', 'girl', 'parents', 'not', 'liking', 'daughter', 'attachment', 'one', 'SVU', 'detectives', 'take', 'out', 'restraining', 'order', 'entire', 'unit', 'Paranoia', 'Benson', 'former', 'mentor', 'raped', 'crime', 'first', 'linked', 'x', 'husband', 'gambling', 'debts', 'then', 'fellow', 'officers', 'Countdown', 'detectives', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'abducted', 'girl', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'third', 'day', 'Manhunt', 'detectives', 'investigate', 'recent', 'abduction', 'waitress', 'are', 'reminded', 'series', 'unsolved', 'rapes', 'murders', 'disturbingly', 'similar', 'Motus', 'Operandi', 'Pique', 'SVU', 'must', 'investigate', 'stabbing', 'death', 'software', 'company', 'employee', 'help', 'Dr.', 'George', 'Huang', 'FBI', 'agent', 'psychology', 'expert', 'who', 'subsequently', 'invaluable', 'asset', 'team', 'trail', 'fired', 'colleague', 'disturbing', 'truth', 'nature', 'relationship', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'season', 'Scourge', 'detectives', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'actions', 'religious', 'paranoia', 'discover', 'was', 'brought', 'rapidly', 'deteriorating', 'medical', 'condition', 'course', 'complicates', 'matters', 'not', 'only', 'SVU', 'ADA', 'Kabot', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'administer', 'death', 'penalty', 'response', 'public', 'opinion', 'honor', 'request', 'mother', 'children.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'short', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'sketch', 'SVU', 'detectives', 'take', 'break', 'catching', 'rapists', 'track', 'down', 'missing', 'letter', 'M.', 'course', 'disk', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'season', 'course', 'shortage', 'cast', 'interviews', 'wich', 'are', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'Needless', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'grubby', 'little', 'paws', 'rest', 'series']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year

Why they released season 5 before the others is quite beyond me, but as long as the other seasons get released quickly, and allow me to complete my collection, I won't complain. One of the things that really gets me about this series isn't just the hard-hitting cases that this show tackles, but also the characters and the acting.The season opened with Stabler's daughter witnessing a gory crime scene, and some great father/daughter scenes resulted from this episode, depicting Stabler as a caring family man, sometimes made too paranoid by his job.  Another episode that I found touching was 'Legacy', where a case of Shaken Baby Syndrome hits really close to home for Munch, played by Richard Belzer, who was originally on the series ""Homicide: Life on the Street.""  Personally, I wish that the series focused more on Munch than it currently does.  We learned a good deal about him in ""Homicide"", but since then, character development on this amazingly unique character has ground to a virtual halt, except for learning that his father killed himself, and young Munch considered himself responsible (see Season 5).Season 2 also introduced the characters of Detective Odafin 'Fin' Tutuola, played by Ice-T, and Assistant District Attorney Alex Cabot, played by Stephanie March. Although not a series regular, Dr. George Huang also appeared several times in the second season, brilliantly acted by B.D. Wong.  This DVD set is well worth owning!At any rate, Law & Order SVU has been, and continues to be one of the best TV series on the air in this age of cheezy, trashy reality shows which are in no way realistic.  Who wants to see a bunch of idiots dress up like Gilligan and go through with a set of ridiculous stunts?

Through its success, the police drama has spawned three similar productions that crossover into different realms of the criminal world and guardians of the law.  One of the descendants from the original series is Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, also known as SVU, which deals sensitive crimes of sexual nature.  Each episode follows the complete circle of the crime.  From the crime to the legal consequence portrayed through the eyes of the prosecutors.  However, the focus of the series seems to rest on the investigators in the SVU and their investigative work, which reveals gruesome crimes such as rape and incest.The opening of the second season brings an episode, Wrong is Right, that possess all the intrigues necessary to continue to fascinate the audience, as it did during its initial season.  It simply continues where season one left off, as the repercussions of a psychological evaluation where two of the main characters shared their thoughts and actions.  Detective Stabler's (Christopher Meloni) work begins to drastically affect his personal life, as his daughter witnesses a gruesome crime.  Meanwhile, Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Detective Munch (Richard Belzer) continue to work with dreadful crimes while Captain Cragen (Dann Florek) helps his squad whenever needed.  During this initial and difficult episode of SVU, Detective Tutuola (Ice-T) arrives after having been transferred from the narcotics department.The first episode helps set up the rest of the season, which ends with the season finale where a serial killer is on the loose.  Every episode in between also contains grisly themes such as stalkers, child molesters, and prostitution among many other crimes that fall under the SVU jurisdiction.  All episodes present some level of discomfort, as the audience gets to experience how the main characters reacted to the crimes and how they confront these crimes.  The SVU is the most controversial of Law & Order's off-shoot, which with its dreadful themes attracts attention to why people commit such ghastly crimes.  It also provides an interesting perspective on the human psyche, as it affects the characters in the series.  Ultimately, the second season of SVU presents a very good experience that provides suspense and drama.Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year is a terrific television series that offers some light on a segment of the police profession that most people desire not to hear about.  Nonetheless, NBC has been brave enough to create a TV series that discusses the dreadfulness of sex crimes in a clever and lawful manner.  Those initiated to SVU should know that this show is definitely worth a viewing, as each episode will provide something new and ghastly.  Yet, awareness could maybe help these crimes from surfacing and prevention could maybe be a little easier, as understanding for the victims is augmented through this excellent television show.",4,...This Excellent Television Show.,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,3037,"['Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'second', 'only', 'Simpsons', 'be', 'longest', 'running', 'television', 'show', 'success', 'police', 'drama', 'spawned', 'three', 'similar', 'productions', 'crossover', 'different', 'realms', 'criminal', 'world', 'guardians', 'law', 'One', 'descendants', 'original', 'series', 'Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'also', 'known', 'SVU', 'sensitive', 'crimes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'episode', 'complete', 'circle', 'crime', 'crime', 'legal', 'consequence', 'portrayed', 'eyes', 'prosecutors', 'However', 'focus', 'series', 'rest', 'investigators', 'SVU', 'investigative', 'work', 'gruesome', 'crimes', 'such', 'rape', 'incest.The', 'opening', 'second', 'season', 'episode', 'Wrong', 'Right', 'possess', 'intrigues', 'necessary', 'continue', 'fascinate', 'audience', 'did', 'initial', 'season', 'simply', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'repercussions', 'psychological', 'evaluation', 'where', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'shared', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'Detective', 'Stabler', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'work', 'drastically', 'affect', 'personal', 'life', 'daughter', 'gruesome', 'crime', 'Meanwhile', 'Detective', 'Benson', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Detective', 'Munch', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'continue', 'work', 'dreadful', 'crimes', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'Dann', 'Florek', 'squad', 'whenever', 'needed', 'initial', 'difficult', 'episode', 'SVU', 'Detective', 'Tutuola', 'Ice-T', 'having', 'been', 'transferred', 'narcotics', 'department.The', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'up', 'rest', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'where', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'episode', 'also', 'grisly', 'themes', 'such', 'stalkers', 'child', 'molesters', 'prostitution', 'many', 'other', 'crimes', 'fall', 'SVU', 'jurisdiction', 'episodes', 'present', 'level', 'discomfort', 'audience', 'experience', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'reacted', 'crimes', 'how', 'confront', 'crimes', 'SVU', 'most', 'controversial', 'Law', 'Order', 'off-shoot', 'dreadful', 'themes', 'attention', 'why', 'people', 'commit', 'such', 'ghastly', 'crimes', 'also', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'human', 'psyche', 'characters', 'series', 'Ultimately', 'second', 'season', 'SVU', 'very', 'good', 'experience', 'suspense', 'drama.Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'Second', 'Year', 'terrific', 'television', 'series', 'light', 'segment', 'police', 'profession', 'most', 'people', 'desire', 'not', 'hear', 'Nonetheless', 'NBC', 'been', 'brave', 'enough', 'create', 'TV', 'series', 'dreadfulness', 'sex', 'crimes', 'clever', 'lawful', 'manner', 'initiated', 'SVU', 'should', 'know', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'episode', 'will', 'provide', 'something', 'new', 'ghastly', 'awareness', 'could', 'maybe', 'help', 'crimes', 'surfacing', 'prevention', 'could', 'maybe', 'be', 'little', 'easier', 'understanding', 'victims', 'augmented', 'excellent', 'television', 'show']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year

923360,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000A7DW7Q,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","I don't really like any of the other Law & Orders.  Can't tell you why either.  Maybe its the characters, maybe the plots aren't as heartbreaking, I just never took to them.  But I really enjoy Law and Order: SVU despite the fact that it deals with some very hard topics.Law & Order SVU deals with the hard cases in New York.  Those cases of child abuse, rape, and violence against the elderly.  Because of the sensitive nature it requires a special force of detectives to investigate these crimes.  Season Two begins where Season One left off, with Detective Jeffries being removed from the force and Stabler's service called into question.  Like the first season, each episode could be considered a stand alone (with a few exceptions) in that a case is solved in each one.  There are some side plots that are continued through the whole season and from the first, but these are more to do with the reoccurring characters than with the plots within the episodes.  There are a few episodes that do rely on previous ones though.  One of these details a man who is a serial rapist in the episode Closure.  It brings back a victim from the first season who wants to try to get her rapist put behind bars, and isn't afraid to follow him to do it.  One of my favorite episodes from this season is Pixies.  It deals with gymnasts training for the Olympics and it's horrifying and inspiring all at once.  Not even thinking about the grisly crime in the episode, it opens up a world of gymnastics and Olympics that I wouldn't have even thought about.Characters:Christopher Meloni: Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay: Olivia BensonRicharld Belzer: John MunchMichelle Hurd: Monique JeffriesIce-T: Fin TutuolaStephanie March: Alexandra CabotDann Florek: Don CragenB.D. Wong: George HuangThere are many many characters in the Law and Order universe; but the ones listed above are those that show up in nearly every episode (with the exception of B.D. Wong who becomes a permanent character towards the end of this season).  And it's the characters that make this show.  There's only so much gory satisfaction a human being can get out of watching depravity; don't let it be questioned that most people watch this show because the cast of characters is excellent.  Meloni and Hargitay really work well together and it makes their union as Benson and Stabler seem realistic; like partners who really can work together.  Florek as Captain Cragen is what holds the whole team together with his calm personality.  And Munch and Fin are the comic relief, although they too can have a serious side to them.  Stephanie March comes in as ADA Cabot who prosecutes the cases for SVU and assists them with warrants and other legal matters and she's a kind of no-nonsense person that deep down has a good heart.  It's hard to warm up to her, but you eventually do.  And then there's B.D. Wong as Dr. George Huang, a psychiatrist who helps with the cases as well.  It's hard to picture Wong, who prances around in Father of the Bride as a serious doctor type, but he does it admirably well.  And while I like his fun side, he is very very good at what he does on SVU.A very good series and this one comes off a lot more polished than the first.  The characters fit into their roles better, the plots are edgier, and there aren't many episodes that I would suggest skipping.  There are a few that are somewhat lackluster, or the plot progressed slowly on, but the majority are edge of your seat you have to know what happens type of episodes.  The camera work was better too, not quite as choppy and it highlighted the detectives when they were on the case.  Of course there is violence, being that this is a cop show and it does cover hard topics, so parental discretion is advised.If you've never seen SVU give it a try (and start at the first season)!Review by M.
