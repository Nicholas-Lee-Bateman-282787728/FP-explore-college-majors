Like the Chick's previous EVENING WITH THE DIXIE CHICKS, the DVD highlights a lot more than the sex appeal of these three charismatic performers.  With a set list culled from each of their three major albums, the show might have been a winner had it actually been the record of one, or even two, shows.  Instead, we have a two-hour montage of performances from several shows from the TOP OF THE WORLD tour.  The production comes off as more a slick documentary than a compelling, cohesive record of performance.  One reason for lobbing off one star is that the editing of these shows, obviously paced to match the rhythm of the music, lurches, cuts and cuts and lurches again.  It is some of the most spastic editing of otherwise decent footage I've ever seen in a rock or country video.  It actually made me edgy. Having said that, the Dixie Chicks are fabulous at what they do and the disc is a bargain pure and simple.  It would be possible to say that Natalie Maines is a force of nature.  Her voice and presence are phenomenal.  If you love this trio as much as I do, don't let all the critical poo-poo get you down.  You WILL enjoy yourselves.

They tendto razz each other and joke a bit which is refreshing. This brings themto the fan level where they don't portray themselves as ""stars"" but the people next door who most likely would come for a BBQ.This disc does not convey that.2)The band does not stretch far on it's arrangements, many are are very close to the studio version.

Splicing different performances together, on the same song, came off very smoothly.  It was a magic show.Natalie is great but I hate her hair.  It looks so butch.  I love her mind but I'm not that into her voice, which is limited in range and kind of metallic.What I missed the most in this video was interaction with the audience, with the viewer, with us, with me.  It was just one song after another, period.During some songs it seemed like the Natalie show, not the Dixie Chicks.  During Landslide it was different.  The girls stood in front of her, like they were protecting her, like she was taking a back seat to them.Natalie reminds me of Ani DiFranco.  She's brilliant, she's tough, she's independent, she has a butch look to her, she seems unapproachable, and of course she's not a fan of our current group of thieves running things from Washington.But Ani is tougher.  Ani is much more political and never stops swinging.  Natalie isn't the political pit bull that Ani is.

Some are certain that these are not live recordings, others believe they are.  I'm in agreement with the latter.  I know the studio recordings well enough to know these aren't lip-sync video mix jobs.  I do believe there are some overdubs, based upon the variations in the acoustic envelope from one song to another.The video editing is a bit distracting from time to time.  In case you haven't seen it, the video from a single song was taken from as many as 10 different performances, with the chicks wearing different costumes for each.  So you get Natalie singing a verse, then on the next verse, she's wearing something different.  But the audio sounds seamless for the most part, so it's possible they took the audio feed from the best performance or two they got, then synced-up the video pieces to match.  This must have been a huge job at the editing console and I'm a bit ambivalent about it.  On one hand, it can be distracting and on the other, it could have been part of their artistic statement.Cool stage setup, excellent contributions from the band, great live sound.

These were the only two songs I knew by name, before I watched the Dvd's.I started watching the first one, ""An Evening With..."" (it's in full-screen, with some widescreen shots mixed in), but found it a bit too slow, so I switched to the ""Top of the World Tour Live"" (which is in widescreen). I was a little confused at first, because I wasn't sure if Natalie's clothing kept changing, or if I was just imagining it? Or maybe, they were just quickly cutting to the other blonde Chick? Anyway, I jumped forward to chapter 4, and when Natalie said, ""Well, hello Houston...Cleveland...Boston, etc., I realized what they were doing. Why they didn't start off with chapter 4, first, is beyond me, but I then went back and watched the entire concert! Without the shots of the different clothing and hairstyles, I would have skipped many of the songs.Yes, some of the edits were too quick, but the quick edits were much less frequent, when the slower, softer songs were sung. I also wish they would have had fewer shots of Natalie wearing black, or sporting her crazy Mohawk hairstyle. To counter this, I just briefly looked elsewhere (on the screen), and waited till the next edit came.I then watched ""An Evening With..."", and enjoyed Natalie's humor and sweetness. In addition, I enjoyed seven of the songs, and no longer found it too slow. I liked both concerts equally, but for different reasons.""Top of the World Tour Live"", had more style and flash; while ""An Evening With..."", had much more charm and humor.I guess it's true what they say...""The Chicks Rule!""",4,I can't believe I watched the whole thing...and enjoyed it all!,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,1735,"[""'m"", 'just', 'moderate', 'fan', 'Chicks', 'only', 'rented', 'previous', 'PBS', 'concert', 'Evening', 'see', 'sing', 'Goodbye', 'Earl', 'Wide', 'Open', 'Spaces', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'songs', 'knew', 'name', 'watched', ""Dvd's.I"", 'started', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'Evening', 'full-screen', 'widescreen', 'shots', 'mixed', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'switched', 'Top', 'World', 'Tour', 'Live', 'widescreen', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Natalie', 'clothing', 'kept', 'changing', 'was', 'just', 'imagining', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'quickly', 'cutting', 'other', 'blonde', 'Chick', 'Anyway', 'jumped', 'forward', 'chapter', '4', 'when', 'Natalie', 'said', 'Well', 'hello', 'Houston', 'Cleveland', 'Boston', 'etc.', 'realized', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'off', 'chapter', '4', 'first', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'entire', 'concert', 'shots', 'different', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'would', 'have', 'skipped', 'many', 'songs.Yes', 'edits', 'were', 'too', 'quick', 'quick', 'edits', 'were', 'much', 'less', 'frequent', 'when', 'slower', 'softer', 'songs', 'were', 'sung', 'also', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'fewer', 'shots', 'Natalie', 'wearing', 'black', 'sporting', 'crazy', 'Mohawk', 'hairstyle', 'counter', 'just', 'briefly', 'looked', 'elsewhere', 'screen', 'waited', 'next', 'edit', 'came.I', 'then', 'watched', 'Evening', 'enjoyed', 'Natalie', 'humor', 'sweetness', 'addition', 'enjoyed', 'seven', 'songs', 'no', 'longer', 'found', 'too', 'slow', 'liked', 'concerts', 'equally', 'different', 'reasons', 'Top', 'World', 'Tour', 'Live', 'had', 'more', 'style', 'flash', 'Evening', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'charm', 'humor.I', 'guess', 'true', 'what', 'say', 'Chicks', 'Rule']",N/A

The way they edited this together was rather inovative. Most concert DVD's are just from one location on any given band's tour. This DVD took video from several arenas from their 2003 tour.  This gives the viewer a chance to see glimpses of the Chicks on their entire tour. Not just one city.It might not be the norm, but it is unique and I happen to like it. I also have to give the editing crew kudos for the royal pain it must have been to select from the thousands of clips and edit this thing together they way they did.The negative reviews make it sound like this DVD is confusing and unwatchable.  Far from it. This is a very enjoyable DVD with very professional editing.  The only weird thing was seeing Natalie's hair change from clip to clip. In one location, it looks like she's wearing a Mohawk. In another, her mascara is so thick, she looks like a punk rocker. But that's okay, cause she's hot in anything she wears.

Forget the Bush-Maines controversy...wotever spills from Natalie's lips other than music is irrelevant. The Chicks make damn good music and this DVD solidifies the highlights of their last 3 albums, with crowd-pleasing hits-fest Landslide, There's Your Trouble, Long Time Gone and Wide Open Spaces amongst others. What you witness is a group that exudes vitality and talent, and performs more challenging songs than your average group.  What impressed me most aobut the DVD is that it selects highlights form different cities in the US, hence makin the DVD not just a re-enactment of the Tour but a wonderful souvenir of an electric night's entertainment!  The stage is humungous (in Ireland they used a standard stage as they haven't the same fanbase as in US) and the girls work it - they look fantastic and sound even better (the DVD proudly states that no overdubs were used!).  Travellin Soldier, a hymn to war-veterans is a haunting poem set, Truth No2 a challenge of political inconsistency and Godspeed the tale of a father whose son moves to France and this song was written to send the child to sleep at night. The Chicks are story-tellers. The finery of Robison and Maguire's musicianship is impeccably demonstrated in the more vibrant numbers which also get the crowds going - White Trash Wedding is a tongue-in-cheek riot and Tortured Tangled Hearts a sardonic look at love gone awry. The most torturous songs amply indicate the force that is Maines...Cowboy and Ready to Run have amazing harmonies along with confident lead vocal delivery. The key tune for the night (and in Dublin the video was performed with it) is lent to the title of the Tour - Top of the World.  The harrowing and tear-jerking video is on the DVD and the live! version on the cd. It tells the story of a deceased man's retrospective and bitterly regretful view of his life. This an EPIC song which caused audience eruptions. An unlikely song which simply kills me EVERY time I watch it. A grammy-worthy song from a grammy-winning album and a worthy title for a tour which has smashed all records....awesome, euphoric and harrowing.  Some slight difference to the tour I saw....A Home was not performed, but More Love was.  Nevertheless I can't complain (although would have loved I Believe In Love to be performed). The Tour is a veritable romp through not only the Chicks' musical and lyrical evolution but testimony to the fact that these gals are the saving grace of country music. Long may they continue.

At around 10 bucks you get an amazing concert... and an extra video (wow! what a video, better than Cash's Hurt) for Top of the World (the song form Home).The tracklist for this concert includesGoodbye EarlSome Days You Gotta DanceThere's Your TroubleLong Tome GoneTortured, Tangled HeartsTravelin' SoldierAm I the Only One (Who Ever Felt this Way)  (on the CD only)Hello Mr. HeartacheCold Day in JulyWhite Trash WeddingLil' Jack SladeA HomeTruth No. 2  (on the CD only)If I Fall You're Going Down With MeMississippi  (on the CD Only)Cowboy Take Me AwayGodspeed (Sweet Dreams)LandslideReady To RunWide Open SpacesTop of the World (live version on CD only, included here as a bonus concept Videoclip)Sin Wagon",5,Wonderful Music at an Amazing Price,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,1850,"['throught', 'year', 'heard', 'hype', 'chicks..', 'media', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'were', 'everybody', 'mouths..', 'why', 'first', 'headlining', 'tour', 'multiplatinum', 'streak', 'continuing', 'one', 'top', 'selling', 'albums', 'year', 'setting', 'concert', 'ticket', 'sales', 'records', 'breaking', 'previous', 'records', 'first', 'day', 'ticket', 'sales', 'why', 'So', 'now', 'were', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'ticket', 'sold', 'out', 'were', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'live', 'show', 'full', 'lenght', 'concert', 'been', 'released', 'CD', 'amp', 'DVD', 'separately', 'America', 'listening', 'watching', 'pleasure.The', 'Chicks', 'surely', 'understand', 'live', 'shows', 'energy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'media', 'why', 'tickets', 'were', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'LOW', 'price', 'DVD', 'country', 'say', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'here', 'music', 'louder', 'comments', 'made', 'band', 'year', 'only', 'thing', 'louder', 'music', 'tremendous', 'fan', 'energy', 'concert.If', 'Chiks', 'music', 'why', ""'re"", 'reading', 'right', 'buy', 'DVD', 'immediately', '10', 'bucks', 'get', 'amazing', 'concert', 'extra', 'video', 'wow', 'what', 'video', 'better', 'Cash', 'Hurt', 'Top', 'World', 'song', 'form', 'Home', '.The', 'tracklist', 'concert', 'EarlSome', 'Days', 'Got', 'ta', 'DanceThere', 'Your', 'TroubleLong', 'Tome', 'GoneTortured', 'Tangled', 'HeartsTravelin', 'SoldierAm', 'Only', 'One', 'Who', 'Ever', 'Felt', 'Way', 'CD', 'only', 'Hello', 'Mr.', 'HeartacheCold', 'Day', 'JulyWhite', 'Trash', 'WeddingLil', 'Jack', 'SladeA', 'HomeTruth', 'No', '2', 'CD', 'only', 'Fall', ""'re"", 'Going', 'Down', 'MeMississippi', 'CD', 'Only', 'Cowboy', 'Take', 'Me', 'AwayGodspeed', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'LandslideReady', 'RunWide', 'Open', 'SpacesTop', 'World', 'live', 'version', 'CD', 'only', 'included', 'here', 'bonus', 'concept', 'Videoclip', 'Sin', 'Wagon']",N/A
