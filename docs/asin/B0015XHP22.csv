1150982,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0015XHP22,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","Resurrecting `Rambo' doesn't offer much sentimentality.  Unlike `Rocky Balboa' where we get lingering memories of previous fame and Adrienne's haunting presence, Sylvester Stallone brings back John Rambo after a twenty-year hiatus with nothing more than harrowing flashbacks from his Vietnam experiences.  These brief, yet skillful scenes are taken from past movies, cleverly revealing his inner turmoil, flashing before our eyes. This time they don't fool around.  Clocking in at 1:23, this installment of the action adventure series doesn't leave much to the violent imagination.  Stallone and company don't waste much time getting reacquainted with the audience.Starting in the present, Rambo (Stallone) returns to Burma as an ex-green beret seeking to free captive humanitarian workers (Julie Benz and Matthew Marsden).  Rambo's rogue mission finds him fully confident with few words as he works with a mutinous, motley crew led by Aussie leader, Lewis (Graham McTavish).  In one scene Rambo tells the volunteer couple, ""You're never going to change the world.""  Well, then, Rambo, what are you doing here?  I guess he does believes in change; he just doesn't agree with their methods.At times graphic, the combat scenes are well-edited and riveting to watch.  I can't remember the last time I've seen such a suspenseful, harrowing, and gruesome action adventure, but I can guarantee you it never gets dull.  (Women and children are often seen killed along with the military men, so viewer discretion is advised.)",4,'Rambo's' Resurrection Spare on Sentimentality,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,1517,"['Resurrecting', 'Rambo', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'sentimentality', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'where', 'get', 'lingering', 'memories', 'previous', 'fame', 'Adrienne', 'haunting', 'presence', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'back', 'John', 'Rambo', 'twenty-year', 'hiatus', 'nothing', 'more', 'harrowing', 'flashbacks', 'Vietnam', 'experiences', 'brief', 'yet', 'skillful', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'past', 'movies', 'cleverly', 'revealing', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'flashing', 'eyes', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'fool', 'around', 'Clocking', '1:23', 'installment', 'action', 'adventure', 'series', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'violent', 'imagination', 'Stallone', 'company', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'getting', 'reacquainted', 'audience.Starting', 'present', 'Rambo', 'Stallone', 'Burma', 'ex-green', 'beret', 'seeking', 'free', 'captive', 'humanitarian', 'workers', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'Rambo', 'rogue', 'mission', 'fully', 'confident', 'few', 'words', 'mutinous', 'motley', 'crew', 'led', 'Aussie', 'leader', 'Lewis', 'Graham', 'McTavish', 'one', 'scene', 'Rambo', 'volunteer', 'couple', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'change', 'world', 'Well', 'then', 'Rambo', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'guess', 'change', 'just', ""n't"", 'agree', 'methods.At', 'times', 'graphic', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-edited', 'riveting', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'suspenseful', 'harrowing', 'gruesome', 'action', 'adventure', 'can', 'guarantee', 'never', 'dull', 'Women', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'seen', 'killed', 'military', 'men', 'so', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'advised']",N/A

1150986,AUDWCQXIG0QZG,B0015XHP22,abettertomorrow,"[1, 1]","While the hectic camerawork and editing are indicative of modern action movie trends, Rambo has the soul of an old-school action flick.  The plot picks up twenty years or so after Rambo helped the Mujahideen defeat the Soviets in Agfhanistan.  A group of aid workers are taken hostage by the genocidal Burmese military and Rambo must give up his solitary life as a snake wrangler to rescue them, against his better judgement.  Predictably, the blood and bullets fly.The best part about the film is, quite simply, seeing a grizzled John Rambo come out of action hero retirement.  Unlike the special effects-oriented fourth Die Hard and Indiana Jones films, which were not only terrible but extremely boring, Rambo is a gritty, stripped-down action thriller with a compelling lead character.  Stallone does a great job portraying Rambo as a nihilistic outcast who's all but given up on life.  Even when Rambo is doing something seemingly heroic, it's not out of altruism or duty, but rather his own personal sense of purpose.I have only one major complaint about Rambo, and that is the deletion of several great scenes that help establish the characters and film's overall message.  These scenes are available on the DVD, but they should have been kept in the final cut.  Rambo is only around 90 minutes long, so it doesn't make much sense for them to have been deleted for runtime purposes.  Some of the CGI is weak, and again, the camerawork and editing are a little too fast, but they don't ruin the film.  Rambo is the first film in the franchise since First Blood to have a true sense of pathos, and for this reason, I'd say it's the second best in the series.

1150988,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B0015XHP22,Ace,"[2, 2]","RAMBO is an extremely vicious and violent film that should please both action and (yes) splatter cinema fans. Most of my buds are into splatter and it was without hesitation that I sprung this gem on them. RAMBO is the 4th and best installment of the franchise and all were extremely delighted with this film. This is not like any of the previous Rambo pictures as it is extremely DARK and loaded with much graphic violence. Make no mistake, this new RAMBO is one of the goriest films ever made and not for the faint of heart. My Gorehound cadre shamelessly lapped up the head shots, blood, dismemberment, exploding bodies, evisceration, stabbings and (yes) lens splatter that RAMBO dished out, for a total of 236 killings (2.59 per minute) in the film. One of them even went as far to say that it brought tears to their eyes! Yes, they did weep tears of joy, (even that shocked me)! As that was someone who shared the SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD trailer spotlight with George ROMERO that is quite a compliment! All agreed that the change in scenery and bigger budget (at 50 million) proved a welcome relief from the B-level monotony that is splatter cinema. As for plot synopsis this is standard Rambo fare in which STALLONE had little dialogue as he deals in lead. Nonetheless, RAMBO proved to be a great movie as it is a compelling picture that is emotionally draining. People really do these sort of things to other people, which added to the morose, and real life horror of the film. Also included are what appeared to be some graphic news reel footage of regional carnage. That added to the dark pall which hangs over this entire picture.

As a punch-them-up thriller with lots of explosions and gory, bloody scenes it works pretty well. Sly is a bit too old to be running around killing people, but the script gives him plenty of reason to stay in one place and puts a lot of action onto the other cast members. The action sequences are done decently, but the acting from the cast (not so much from Stallone as from everyone else) is subpar even for an action film. Also, Stallone must be a 24 fan because he freely steals Jack Bauer's conviction from season 6, ""Live for nothing or die for something.""

1150991,A22VWAE7WCUE5K,B0015XHP22,A man from the east coast,"[12, 12]","It is nothing short of astounding to me how many people (exception: ) seem to just not get this movie.  To me, this is a very fine war picture.In a misguided attempt to be witty, there are those who are saying that the film's body count should be compared to the number of words spoken onscreen, to see which is higher.One must realize that David Morrell, the original author of ""First Blood"", and Stallone, who co-authored the original film's screenplay, and is a  co-author of the ""Rambo"" screenplay, both envision and present John Rambo as a man who is profoundly introverted.  Stallone has, at least partially, based his writing and protrayal of this character on his son Seargeoh, who is profoundly autistic.  Stallone has stayed true to this portrayal, critics be damned.  John Rambo shows little of his emotional and psychological identity to the outside world, and only slightly more to those few whom he considers to be his friends.  Col. Trautman saw a side to ""Johnny"" that few others do.  Sarah, a Christian Missionary in this latest installment, is only one of a few characters in the series to be distinguished as being someone John Rambo considers to be his friend.Also present here is implication is that this is just a bloodfest for sick voyeurs who like to watch people suffering and dying.Nothing could be further from the truth.  Although this is, indeed, a profoundly violent film, that barely escaped an NC-17 rating, one thing must be made clear:  THIS FILM DOES NOT GLORIFY VIOLENCE.A Vietnam veteran once said to me, ""The only thing that will prepare you for battle is to be in one.  There is nothing that can truly prepare you for what war is really like.  Nothing.""  Having written that, I cannot now tell you that seeing films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" with it's ultra-high body count will put you on a level of first-hand knowledge comparable to a combat veteran.  No one has ever suggested such a thing, not should they.  However, many veterans of the D-Day invasion had to leave the theatre during the scenes of storming the beach at Normandy.  This tells me that Spielberg got it right, and his film will stand for decades as the best possible cinematic telling of what that day was like.Stallone is doing something similar here.  This film presents war at its most horrific.  This film is quite dissimilar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that the storyline in ""SPR"" was an archplot.  In other words, an epic, something Joseph Campbell of THE MONOMYTH fame would identify as a story that transcends cultures, identities and contexts.  The mission that leads to the finding of Private Ryan reveals much about the nature of war and those that fight it, and in so doing much about the human condition is brought to light.  Specifically, humanity fighting tooth-and-nail for survival against a culture that has been corrupted to the point of profound evil.This installment of Rambo is distinct from this monomyth, archplot structure.  This is by no means an epic.  Stallone shows us one of his most famous characters, living by himself in Thailand, making a living selling snakes and piloting a boat on the Salween river.  He is approached by a group of Christian missionaries intent on bringing medical and other humanitarian supplies to the Karen people of Myanmar (referred to as Burma in the film).  Rambo initially refuses, making no emotional connection with Michael, a Christian doctor imploring Rambo to assist him in his cause.  The missionaries' sole female, Sarah, then attempts to convince Rambo to help.  It is obvious that an immediate emotional connection is made.What is interesting here is that the missionaries are scripted by Stallone to sound exactly as they do in real life:  profoundly idealistic, convinced that they alone understand how to change the world better than anybody else ever could, and absolutely unwilling to listen to reason (these aren't presented as negative traits per se, but rather as their mentality, for better or for worse).  Stallone's Rambo is usually a man of few words, but he uses his economy of dialog to make his points quite clear.  He has no interest in debate.  He asks Michael, who has declared that he means to change things in Burma, if he's planning on bringing any weapons.""Of course not,"" Michael responds, clearly contemptuous, not of Rambo, but of the idea of taking weapons to try to stop Burma's endless violence.""Then you ain't changin' nothin'"", is Rambo's response, spoken in an overtone of absolute finality, and with an undertone of the despair John Rambo's experience has bequealthed upon him, that further debate is clearly pointless.  (In case you missed it, Stallone-hating reviewers, Sly is doing something called ""acting"".  You wouldn't understand.)A few scenes later, Sarah manages to convince Rambo to help the missionaries.  Although payment is offered, Rambo refuses it.  Rambo and the missionaries begin their journey up the Salween river.  When Sarah begins to speak with Rambo during the boat ride, she asks his name, to which he replies, ""John"".Are you getting me, dear reader?  It isn't, ""I'M RAMBO, THE MOST POWERFUL WARRIOR OF ALL TIME, HELPING YOU PUNY WEAKLING DO-GOODERS TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM ..."" and yada-yada-yada.  It's clear from Rambo's demeanor that he is not terribly impressed with himself.  A first name introduction suffices just fine, as far as he's concerned.  His violent resume?  He'd just as soon not speak of it at all, answering Sarah's questions about his past with the shortest answers possible.  ""John"", as he introduces himself, is profoundly divested of pride.  Sarah's a committed Christian missionary, long in the habit of putting her money where her mouth is, and living selflessly according to her belief in aiding the oppressed in any way she can.  John's lack of pride, in inextricable tandem with his very powerful presense, well be at least part what draws her to her friendship with him.You'll recall, dear reader, if you watched ""Rambo III"", that Rambo refuses to join Col. Trautman in his mission to Afghanistan with the words, ""My war is over.""  As Stallone has taken over the writing of this story from it's initial novelist creator, David Morrell, Rambo's inner conflict has become that he is supremely gifted in the art of waging war, but wants nothing more than to cease fighting and killing.This is highlighted in this new installment of ""Rambo"" during a dream sequence in which Rambo is hearing the voice of Col. Trautman, these words from the final scenes of ""First Blood"" and also ""Rambo III"" hauntingJohn Rambo as he sleeps.  Trautman accuses Rambo of tearing away at himself, resisting what he is.  Rambo is, in Trautman's view, a one-of-a-kind warrior, capable of victory against overwhelming odds.  This is John Rambo's gift.John Rambo is then awakened from this dream by another missionary, who comes to tell him that Sarah, Michael and the other missionaries are missing.  We in the audience already know this, as we've just witnessed the horrific assault on the village the missionaries had reached and were working to help.This sequence is brilliantly shot by director Stallone, presenting a maelstorm of violence and atrocity that explodes on screen, each image presented telling a story in itself.  This attack occurs during a moment of profound tenderness.  Stallone shows us humanities' saving grace in his depictions of the doctor's ministering to the villagers both medically and spiritually.  This culminates with Sarah moving towards a child, embracing him and comforting him.  We see that this is the most natural expression of her identity.  This is who she is.  This child is someone she has never met before, is not related to, and is someone to whom most people would say she owes nothing.  But there she is, putting herself in extreme danger of unimaginable torture and certain death simply because of her beliefs.  You'll have to see this moment to truly understand it, but rest assured, you will see both the best and the worst of what it is to be human in these scenes that are onscreen for only a few moments.  The attack quickly overwhelms the village.  Sarah and her friends are taken prisoner.From here, the pace of the film picks up quite a bit.  John Rambo prepares himself for battle, forging a new blade at his anvil, his internal dialog a monologue of coming to terms with what he is, and what he is meant to do.For now, John Rambo is not fighting a war his commanders sent him to fight, nor is he fighting the country that didn't want him back.  He is not fighting to free POW's from that war, in an effort to right the wrongs of America's involvement in Vietnam.  He's not fighting to free his mentor and teacher Col. Trautman, as doing so is his duty, dictated by the inescapable bonds of the warrior brotherhood.  He is, possibly for the first time in his life, committing to an act of war based upon his own beliefs, period.  It is clear an emotional bond was formed with Sarah.  John Rambo cannot leave her to the atrocities of her captors.Don't try to attack that one either, Stallone-bashers;  No, the scenes in which John Rambo and Sarah become friends were not too brief.  Some people are true friends in a few moments, others would not become true friends if forced to spend a lifetime together.  The depth of the emotional connection between John and Sarah is quite clear to me.  If it isn't to you, that says more about you than it does about this film.  Deal with it.The film continues, with John Rambo guiding a group of mercenaries up the Salween River, staying out of their soldier's banter, and refusing to take the bait of the strongest of the mercenaries, who tries to intimidate John.  We see from Stallone's enactment of his character that John Rambo is not at all intimidated, but will not engage in a fight with this man.  John's abilities are quite intact, but his lack of pride in what he is persuades him that it's not worth showing this mercerary what he can do.  The time for that, as we soon see, comes later.To see what happens from here, go see the film.  It's is a story about a man who makes a decision about who and what he is.  He comes to realize that he is a warrior.  He cannot escape this identity.  He admits to himself that he has killed in the past, not for a cause but for the enjoyment of using this gift of waging war.  Yet now, he commits himself to a fight for his own reason:  his bond with Sarah.  This film is about choosing to fight, not to defend one's pride against the taunts of a mercenary, or for a political cause, or for a warrior brotherhood, but for something that exists deep within oneself.  At this point in John Rambo's life, this is all the really matters.  It is about fighting to defend and protect that which we hold dear.  It is about what Sarah was trying to communicate to John in the beginning of the film; it is about laying down your life for your friends, for those you care for.There is no great and complex plot in this film, no series of plot-twisting rising actions, each event in the storyline there to compel deep thought about our history as a nation, and about human history.  No, this film drops us in to a particular point in John Rambo's life in which we witness him make a decision about his identity, and then act upon that decision in such a way that once committed, he can be true to his identity and very likely lose his life, or, he can deny who he is, and what he truly believes in, and so live a life that matters nothing to anyone, least of all to himself.This is a film about John Rambo choosing, for the first time, to fight for what he himself believes in.  It is a film that forces the audience to see war for the nightmare that it is, not a spectacle to entertain the masses by appealing to the lowest common denominator.  This is a film about one man who makes a choice about what his gift is for, and in so doing is finally, at the end of his saga, true to what he really is:  One who is supremely gifted at sheperding the weak through the valley of the shadow of death.I recommend this film without reservation.  This is one of the best war films ever made.",5,A Truly Great War Film,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,12155,"['nothing', 'short', 'astounding', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'exception', 'seem', 'just',

That being said it is a very good one......John Rambo has been treated like dirt by the American People when he came back from 'Nam.  (First Blood)  He was used again by the U.S. Government and left to rot while helping men the government didn't care about.  (First Blood Part 2) Then he went to get his mentor and brother, COL Trautman back from behind enemy lines. (Rambo III)This has shaped this character into the one that is depicted in the latest story of this soldier.  He is a bitter, quiet man that is desperately trying to keep the killer that he is under control.  Sylvester Stallone does this brilliantly.A group of missionaries come to Burma seeking to help the people of a Genocidal Army from being eradicated.  They have no way to get into the country and they ask for the assistance of the one man they have heard could help them get in.  Rambo........Rambo tries to convince the people to go home but they persist and eventually get Rambo to help them.  After this happens the violence just keeps rising until the finale.This movie is not for the weak stomached individual or for a person that is an advocate for non-violence.  This is freaking Rambo people he is a killer!This is one of the few films that accurately and graphically portrays exactly what happens on a battlefield with weapons that are used by people today.  It is bloody and vicious but it is reality people.  At the end of the film you see a man that knows what he is and knows that he must change himself to really put that ""war machine"" to bed forever.This is a must see if you enjoy Rambo and if you are a war movie fan, if not steer clear as you probably won't enjoy this movie.

Even though the camera shakes around a lot, it manages to keep good focus on the action.  The photography ultimately serves well to capture the gritty realness of combat from Rambo's point of view.*Despite being moody and silent, Stallone remains true to his character and is believable.*This film is probably one of the most violent movies I know of, both graphically and brutally.  Much of this is focused on the injustices of the Burma regime, as they raid their own villages and brutally slaughter innocent civilians.  The film's main intention is to expose these attrocities, and I believe is it very effective and invoking (and thus successful).*Very strong theme about the need for heroes or war fighters in society.*Pretty good music.The Bad Things*Not for the squeamish.*Some of the dialogue is simplistic or dull (especially when the missionaries are trying to convince Rambo to go upriver; their arguments weren't very convincing, so it's kind of weird that Rambo agreed).*The plot is ultimately very thin and simplistic (but this could also be a good thing, because its mercifully short).As a Rambo action movie, this one probably doesn't work as well.  But as a video-essay concerning the situation in Burma and the need for heroes in this world, it is quite excellent.  It's not ""Schindler's List"" by any means, but like ""Children of Men"" or ""Lord of War,"" it definately highlights the worst, most brutal aspects of human violence and war.  You're probably not supposed to enjoy watching Rambo tear all of the bad guys apart, but after seeing what the bad guys do, you wind up rooting for him anyway.  Ultimately, the movie exposes the attrocities of a regime that would have otherwise gone unnoticed by the general public (I know I would have never known).

[...] I am irrevocably obsessed with it, as I am a military historian.""Rambo"" was something I didn't care at all about, until a YouTube video featuring one of my favorite Iced Earth songs features scenes from this movie in it.  Particularly, the final action sequence.And so that drew me in to see it.Comparing him to the Rambo I saw later in ""First Blood"" and ""First Blood II"" I see a journey that is nearly complete.  The 'aw-shucks' sort of kid in the beginning of ""First Blood"" hardened and closed up like a stone by this film.  John Rambo rarely says anything, and it's not for wont of sparing the audience his heavily slurred voice.Right from the start, Stallone indicates he is using the backdrop of the film to highlight the 60 year running civil war in Myanmar/Burma, largely between the reigning military junta and the Karin people.  We get lots of sequences (not real footage, but part of the film) of 'games' the military plays, by tossing mines into shallow riverbanks, and having prisoners run across, and placing bets on which ones will make it across without hitting a mine.  We also get a sequence of a raid on a village, ""recruitment"" as it is, as the military snatches away young boys to be broken in as soldiers, and threatens the villagers with extermination if they try to resist.John Rambo, meanwhile, is a practical man, who realizes he can't do anything about it, and that seemingly he doesn't care, even though Sylvester Stallone clearly does.And what really stood out for me in this was that Stallone is very clear in his message that while peace is good, and it's very insightful and honorable to go to countries such as Burma with only peaceful intentions of medicine and religion, quite frankly, as Rambo says, you aren't changing a thing in Burma with peace.""Rambo"" makes it clear that Burma is among the worst of Asian countries, in a perpetual state of war, and that the oppressive military runs rampant over the villages, which are presumably Karin though the movie never explicitly shows them, perhaps in a message that the Karin people are not so vastly different from the rest of the Burmese.  If it isn't the military, it's pirates who are not willing to negotiate money over the chance to rape hot white ass (Sarah's ass), prompting Rambo to kill again, perhaps the first time in years.Once the missionaries (lead among them being Sarah and Michael, played by Julie Benz and Paul Schulze) arrive at a village and do good work, they are attacked by the military seemingly within hours, and the survivors captured because they are white.This prompts the core of the movie to unfold; action violence, as Rambo shuttles a team of plucky mercenaries, memorably the asshole Brit, into Burma, and eventually goes himself to their aid.This starts a series of action scenes that does not stop until the end, from the first encoutner during a second scene featuring the mine-running game (and, quite frankly, a goddamn awesome 'trick-shot' with Rambo hitting a Burmese soldier with an arrow, and sending him flying several feet to explode on a landmine in the water), a stealthy-nighttime rescue mission, and a dash through the woods to escape, where the Brit gets his leg shredded by a mortar, and Rambo's use of a Claymore to throw off the Burmese military and detonate a World War II bomb left unexploded in the jungle.This all leads up to the final action sequence, in which the mercenaries and missionaries (minus the sniper and Sarah) are lined up about to be executed, when Rambo appears to the rescue, with a .50 caliber mounted machine gun at hand.When I had complained about ""First Blood""'s lack of genre-defining violence, I fear I may have been spoiled by this movie, though I was at least understanding in recognizing that what I saw here could possibly never have been shown in 1982.For about ten minutes at the end of ""Rambo"", we're given quite possibly the absolute goriest, most realistically bloody action sequence ever depicted in any movie of its kind; from the start with Rambo swinging a machete hard enough to decapitate a man in one swift stroke, to the gore-soup staining the face-guard of the machine gun.  Very literally, heads are exploded, bodies have huge holes shot through them, and limbs fly off or simple crumble beneath the person as the .50 caliber machine gun's effect on human flesh is depicted in gross, yet accurate detail, as not only Rambo wreaks hell on the machine gun, but the sniper unloads, and the mercenaries escape and start killing with bare fists, rocks, grenades, and AK47s.Eventually the Karin Rebels show up, showering the Burmese with mortars and guns, and the battle winds down with a Burmese attack boat going up in flames, followed by the main bad-guy general being quickly disemboweled by Rambo as he tries to escape.And so with this action sequence, Stallone entertains and teaches, with gore that is excessive and yet surgical, going well overboard by comparison to its older features, and yet perfectly fitting the tone and context of the film.  Its message is clear; the situation in Burma cannot be diplomatically resolved---it must be resolved with war, against the military regime.  Even Michael, who at first whined about violence, and even yelled at Rambo for killing the pirates who threatened to rape Sarah and kill them all, ends up pouncing on a Burmese soldier, and beating him to death with a large rock.My only major complaint about this final action sequence was that seemingly overwhelmingly Burmese-military-death based, as only about two or three of the mercenaries died, and very few Karin Rebels were shown being hit by military fire.John Rambo was a man in utter denial.  He went to Vietnam and died.  He was trained to be the absolute best of fighting men, and when he returned, he returned to rejection by his society, and near death as he put his military training to test in ""First Blood"".  Since his many adventures, he has tried to bury his past, and end his violent lifestyle, hiding away from the rest of the world in the backwater jungles of Thailand.By the end of the movie, in a scene reminiscent of the opening scene of ""First Blood"", he is back in America, arriving on his father's farm, and seeking out the very last link to his former life, as he had in ""First Blood"" seeking out the last comrade in his unit.  By the end of it, Rambo has clearly come to terms with the fact he stated himself mid-way through the film:""War is in your blood""",5,War is in my blood,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,6704,"['was',

OK, Rambo III was a dozer (at least relatively). I won't bother comparing it to that one. Rambo II versus the new one? Well, the new Rambo is definitely more realistic, and the special effects are spectacular, particularly the bloody ones. But Rambo II was more entertaining and inspiring. The actors were better, the characters more colorful, and the timing, from a marketing/political standpoint, was perfect. The cold war was in force, and Rambo single-handedly wiped out a whole sector of commies--YEAH! Let's face it--1985 was an upbeat year! All these factors made for great entertainment in Rambo II.The new movie seems to serve more as a documentary than fist-pumping entertainment. Rambo wins in the end, but the violence and brutality of the military powers in Burma is depressing, and we know the scenes depicted in the movie are real, whereas Rambo himself unfortunately isn't. Normally I don't like too much Hollywood shtick, but the new Rambo could use a little more of it. The characters were just kind of blah--boring.Still, a good movie, and if you're a big Rambo fan, you should get it. As other reviewers have said, the whole series does resolve nicely in the end of this movie when Rambo goes home.

Why, resurrect the other iconic character he has. One John Rambo. Again, just like with Rocky, the public laughed at the thought. Rambo?. Stallone pulled off the unexpected with ""Rocky Balboa"", but could he do it again?. Could Sly strike lightning twice?. In one way, yes. In another, not quite. We'll get to that in a bit. One way or the other, what Stallone did was deliver the biggest and bloodiest Rambo yet. As Randy from ""Scream 2"" says - ""Carnage candy!"". So, what is it all about?.We find John Rambo catching and selling snakes in Thailand, and boating around. He is years removed from his adventures of yesteryear and is just living life. That all changes when he is approached by a group of missionaries(featuring Julie Benz, 'Darla' to us ""Buffy"" fans), who want him to take them on his boat into Burma, an incredibly war torn place, to help aid there. Of course, just as you would expect, it all doesn't go too well, and before long, Rambo is back in action hero mode when he has to invade the place to help rescue them.The plot of the film may not be a giant leap, but it works. And this is Rambo, after all. Sure there has been the angry bitter vet we knew in the past films, but it all comes down to action and explosions. How much stuff does Rambo blow up?. How many people does he kill?. The very, very short answer for that is - A LOT!. Seriously, this is one of the most violent, bloody movies I think I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of stuff in my day, but even I was surprised and taken away by the sheer amount of violence in this film. It pulls no punches. The end shoot out made the storming of the beach scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" look like something out of a Disney film. It is brutal. And don't ask me what the end body count is. I lost count. If that's what you want in your movies, or in your Rambo movie, then you will most definitley not be disappointed in the least. Stallone also directs the violence and the action scenes in the film with such ferociousness that it really does feel like it's actually real. Sly did a bang up job in that area. No doubt about it.And then we comes down to the cast, the acting, and so on. Really, it's Stallone's show here people. I'm not complaining whenever Julie Benz shows up, but most of the cast is there to be kidnapped, or shoot guns. It's all about Stallone. Look, Stallone may never win the Best Actor Oscar, but he brings his Rambo and Rocky to life. He writes these films, and has directed a good many of them too. Some may mock and make fun of the Slyster, but there is no doubt that he is a very talened guy, and is probably far smarter than a lot of people give him credit for. He may be over 60 now, but would you of thought so if you didn't already know that piee of info?. I know I wouldn't. He jumps into the role full on from the get go and is just as capable and incredibly strong and buffed in this as any of the other three films in the series. He looks great. I know he could probably whip me with one hand tied behind his back. Looks and acting aside, John Rambo may not resonate with the people as much as Rocky did/does. In that regard, the movie doesn't come close to reaching the heart and spirit of ""Rocky Balboa"", but Rambo, the movie and character, is what it's always been. Fun, heroic, action packed, and entertaining.""Rambo"" was a welcome return. To me, Stallone succeeded with this film in the way he did with ""Rocky Balboa"" because, for starters, I thought it was a good movie. It delivered the goods one usually expects from a Rambo movie, and then ups the ante. It showed that yes, Stallone could do it again, both as the actor and that the character can still hold up. He was up for the challenge. He passed with flying colors in my book. Where it doesn't quite succeed like ""Balboa"", was that Rocky felt finished. Like it had come full circle and was done. With a Rambo 5 already being talked about, I guess Sly knew he was not done with this character. ""Balboa"" also hits on a more human and emotional level. The type of character work and study is not quite apparent in ""Rambo"". The ending of the film was very interesting. Maybe Rambo 5 will have more of what I am talking about?. It certainly ends in a way that makes a Rambo 5 intriguing.Also, I wanted to say how deeply missed Richard Crenna is. He was a fine man and a great actor. He was as much a big part of these movies as Stallone. It seems weird not having him around. It was nice that he was shown in a flashback scene. At least they got him in there somehow.Rambo 5?.

After the catastrophe that was ""Rambo 3"", I didn't have high hopes for this. I was wrong.While this can't be called ""high cultural entertainment"", it's a fun movie. If you thought the body count of ""Rambo 3"" was over the top, you've got some surprises coming. I believe, by last count, he kills the entire population of Burma...twice. And no one dies with a simple ""bang"", but must explode in a gush of blood and guts everywhere. The movie is way way waaaaaaaay overboard with deaths, but Stallone manages to keep Rambo true to the character we've seen in the previous films.I especially enjoyed the final scene in the film.

Please, you've got to be kidding. I would take Rambo any given day of the week rather than torture myself again with Cloverfield. Thanks again sly for saving the day!The latest installment in the Rambo series doesn't bare the number 4 but is certainly a welcomed return of our favorite hero. John has long since sworn off fighting again but now captures & sells exotic snakes for a living. When approached by two young missionaries for assistance in delivering aid to needy people in the Thai-Burmese border, he initially refuses. Eventually, he does break down & takes them to their destination.As fate would have it, the do-good missionaries are in dire need of help & they're days on Earth may be numbered if John doesn't step in. As one can guess, John again packs his machete & leads a pack of mercenaries on a rescue mission to the save the people from their treacherous surroundings.I will admit that this is, by far, one of the best Rambo films I've seen since the second one. We can simply forget part 3 & focus all our attention on the latest installment. Stallone really gives us a run for our money this time around. It's bloody, it's extremely graphic, & there are some very disturbing scenes which actually stick in your mind long after the credits roll. The burmese goons are not strangers to torturing as their victims are subject to brutal assaults (rape), skull crushing, & being fed to wild animals among other inhumanities. Trust me, Stallone gives us a very hardcore look at war this time around.Gone is the cartoonish side of Rambo which we loved in our pre-teens. (I do remember the cartoon very well in the '80's.) Now we have a serious killing machine out to make things right on the warfront & this film is a thrill-a-minute. Stallone is in his early sixties & looks great! He's still built like a rock statue but our hearts may still melt at the end of the film when he bequeaths his half grin. We love you Stallone!!!! Thank you again!Rambo reminds me of several things that I've learned in life. If you can't stand up & fight for what is right, then what is your raison d'etre? If you can't protect from the weak from the strong, then what good are you?

Taking the setting to Burma to give the mainstream audience a view on how violent parts of Burma are, Rambo is revived in a triumphant massacre. This time, he's not alone.After being approached by a group of Christian Aid Workers, Rambo takes them up the river and into Burma. He starts to fall for one of the aid workers by the name of Sarah (Julie Benz) but they are both two very different people. Whilst on their aid trip in a small village, the village is attacked by the armed militia and the aid workers are kidnapped along with Sarah. Rambo, having left the workers behind, is approached 10 days later to help track down the workers. This time he has help from a group of mercenaries which will help him save Sarah, and take down the evil regime.This is a really good movie that, when involving the violence is no holds barred graphic wise. I can't help but think we've been lied to somehow as Sly has said in numerous interviews that he didn't use any CGI for this movie. This appears to be untrue as there's one part of the movie that we see a considerably large explosion that seems very much computer generated. Sly seems to be wanting to bring back the old glory days of the first rocky movies and the first Rambo's. With the success of Rocky Balboa and now with the success of Rambo 4, it's clear that Sly still has what it takes to give us a really good film.

I haven't felt this visceral since the first movie, it's that impressive and Sly looks great at Sixty. Once again John Rambo is fighting injustice, this time in Myanmar (previously Burma). Apparently since we last saw Rambo he has spent years in Thailand and Myanmar catching snakes and miscellaneous other jobs to get by. When Rambo takes a church group up river to give medical aid and Christian teaching to people suffering the religious cleansing he feels they won't make a difference and he leaves. The village and the group is later ambushed by soldiers. Most the village is killed but several in the Church group survive. Rambo finds out and feels he must return to rescue them.The problem is a mercenary group has been sent in to extract them and they don't want Rambo's company past the point on the river he dropped off the Church group. Once again John won't take no for an answer and after he polishes off a few enemies with his trusty bow they are happy to have him. John proceeds to blow enemy soldiers up with Claymores and anything else he can get his hands on. When he gets his hands on a .50 caliber machine gun he cuts them to pieces literally. The effects and stunt people did a masterful job of making it look realistic. So be prepared for some major carnage that shouldn't be seen by younger viewers. One slight complaint is I would have liked it a little longer to develop the characters just slightly more, not to mention I didn't want it to end so quickly. I still think the first movie is the best in the series because of the story and characters, but this one is probably second because of how well it shows real events with realistic effects. Good quality DVD with reasonable replayability. If you enjoyed this catch the other ""Rambo"" movies or ""Ruckus"" for a lighter take on this story that came out pre-Rambo First Blood. - C.

Stallone was not `on fire' when it came to movies. His last Rocky film didn't get the credits Stallone himself probably wanted and before that his movies were rated below average (Truth hurts Sylvester I know).I got to watch `Rambo' on blue-ray the second day it was released, and just as I can imagine many people who did not believe in this film, I was also stunned and amazed. It is actually a great movie! No boring dialogue and the plot is interesting and intense. What you'll see in this film is what actually happens across our planet by these sadistic radical fanatics war groups and how their killing spree goes on. Yes, the movie is gory, in fact one can say it's too gory, and also explicit;  but in the end it is reality and sometimes we must be expose to it to understand what is going on in foreign countries.Rambo is a bad ass, no doubt about that. A very serious man and when it comes to business he will tear anyone apart (literally!). If you're an action movie lover do not miss on this work of art.

Sinclair ""doctorcreation""","[3, 7]","Having recently re-watched First Blood 1 and 2 I thought that it would be cool to see the newest installment in the ""Rambo"" franchise. Boy, was I wrong. The first 2 Rambo movies mixed action with a message creating a serious movie that was entertaining and yet thought provoking. Rambo 4 takes all the entertainment out, tosses in horribly grotesque CG gore, and an old protagonist that hasn't grown at all and in fact has seemingly lost more humanity than he gained in the intervening years. Part of what made John Rambo compelling is this inner struggle of being a killer and yet a patriot, tough yet tender, someone who wants to move on and yet can't. This older Rambo is simply existing in limbo and when pushed, is all killer without conflict. So the character was very flat in my opinion.A Rambo movie also carries with it the burden of entertainment, a consumate ""guy's movie"" where the adrenaline flows and over the top action gets the heart racing. This new Rambo has ZERO entertainment value. Presenting the pathetic conditions of the ""snake wranglers"", the implications of rape, the carnivorous pigs, or sport killings really left me cold and depressed, not entertained. While I get the idea that the film makers wanted to send a message regarding the Burmese atrocities I'm not sure that a Rambo movie is the proper forum. Make a film like Hotel Rawanda, create a documentary, watch the news, but please don't screw up a beloved franchise by eliminating the intrinsic escapist entertainment.So overall, highly disappointing.

Few films do this as well as Rambo. Pump up the volume and watch the bluray on a big screen. The dialogue is quite honestly surprisingly good and better than Rocky Balboa imho. A few lines might call out to people and some of the acting is average at times but never bad and the integrity of the gritty plotline never lets it get in the way. This, I'm happy to say, is a film that pretty much sets a new benchmark for action films.Now about this extended edition. It cuts some violence that didn't need to be cut. It adds some things that may not need to be there. It has a lower bitrate by a fair margin of 5Mbps or so and it also doesn't carry the 'Director's Cut' in name meaning this isn't fully sanctioned as such?IDK but you might want both of them as the Extended cut includes some great video diaries. It's up to you but for my money I will take the theatrical cut. Something seems off with the other one. The pacing is different and doesn't seem to gel with me. Others may find things they like with the little bits of extra dialogue but there was really no reason to cut the explicit violence which helps to portray the ruthless enemies fairly well. All in all they both do the job. Higher bitrate wins out for me along with what I know to be Stallone's first and official cut of the film.",5,One of the best action films ever made.

Yes, I really do like the 'Rambo' films. This is not some ironic, ""weren't the eighties great"" nostalgia of the type you're seeing pimped all over mainstream broadcast media at the minute. They're great action films with some of the best musical scoring of the last thirty years which were massively influential, and, if we're honest, the originalFirst Bloodis 'the' populist mainstream film that really brought the debate concerning the shameful treatment of returning Vietnam veterans into the public consciousness. I'll take them over the likes of 'The Matrix' et al any day of the week. I also don't buy into the ""they were Reaganite propaganda"" argument. While they may have been a favourite of Teflon Ron's during the eighties, it doesn't hold water if you watch them. True, the Soviets are the enemy 'du jour' in parts two and three, but its hardly as if the American political administration comes across as any better in either of the films. Watch the opening sequences of 'First Blood' again and tell me that Brian Dennehy's agent provocateur sheriff with his ""we don't want long-haired drifters in our town"" wouldn't have been a dyed in the wool Republican; watch the closing soliloquy in the police station and tell me that it is in any way pro-war.

1151033,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0015XHP22,Dave. K,"[7, 7]","After the success of Rocky in 1976, Stallone would have a character that would go down in cinema history and went onto become one of the biggest stars in the world. In 1982 with the release of First Blood, John Rambo would join Rocky as yet another Iconic character for Stallone.But there came a time when all things must end; the 2nd Rambo flick was a blockbuster hit and made a total of $150-million dollars in 1985 it's almost like everyone in the US went to see the movie, but despite the popularity of the character Rambo III would only gross about $53-million and would put an end to the series. Even Rocky V would be a flop in 1990 and it seemed these two Iconic characters were done for.Sly would have success and failures, but by the end of the 90s it seemed like a lot more failures with some of his movies even going DTV. Once the biggest action star, it seemed Sly was a thing of the past, but that all changed with Rocky Balboa; a lot of people were laughing at a 60-year old Stallone playing that character again, but the movie was a hit and nobody was laughing after they saw Stallone could still pull it off. With the success of Rocky Balboa, Sly was now ready to resurrect John Rambo. There were still some people laughing due to his age, but there's that saying age is just a number and Stallone proved that.At the time of Rambo's release, Stallone was 61-years old and I'll take Stallone in his 60s over any of these so called action stars out there right now that are half of Stallone's age. Rambo is the return of the action movie as we know it. I can't remember the last American action that was this good besides Kill Bill. Rambo is as good as an action movie any country could produce for that matter. The last American action movie that is just as good if not better than Rambo was back in probably the 80s or early 90s.The screenplay was written by Art Monterastelli & Sylvester Stallone and while the screenplay is good the supporting characters aren't really well developed, but I suppose it doesn't matter seeing as it doesn't hurt the movie and I don't think anyone watches a Rambo flick for the supporting characters we watch them for the Rambo character. While the script isn't the best it delivers on what the audience wants. And really at the end of the day isn't that all that matters?Sylvester Stallone knows what his audience wants and a lot of people don't realize that he wrote or co-wrote a lot of the movies he starred in; odds are the movies he co-wrote he did rewrites to better suit the script for his style. While I wouldn't say Sly is a great writer in the traditional sense he's a guy that knows what his audience wants and delivers that. Though with Rocky and Rocky Balboa, Sly showed how he can also be a great writer and was actually nominated for an Oscar for the Rocky screenplay, which he easily could have won.Sly also steps into the director's chair for the first time in this franchise and wow does he ever deliver. Stallone has many directing credits, but like his writing I wouldn't call Sly a great director in the traditional sense. Again Sly knows what his audience wants and he always manages to deliver just that. If anything though I really think Sly is getting better with age, which is rare. Most filmmakers as they go on they lose touch with the modern audience, but not Sly. I think with Rocky Balboa he proved he can make a great dramatic, funny and even touching movie and with Rambo he made an action movie as good as any action filmmaker has ever done. Rambo is suspenseful, thrilling and has some of the best action scenes I have seen in a very long time.Rambo is a borderline exploitation flick in my opinion; the violence is actually quite extreme for a mainstream movie and for a movie rated R. Nobody is Rambo is safe; men, women and even children are murdered. This isn't a toned down Hollywood action flick. This is a balls to the wall no holds barred brutal movie. You name it Rambo has it; decapitations, throats being ripped out, people getting shot and they just don't fall down and die they get ripped to shreds; arms, legs you name it, it gets shot off.The running time for Rambo is only 80-minutes not counting the closing credits so there never is a slow moment. The movie always moves forward. Rambo is light on plot, but hey that's the way a lot of action movies are. Rambo easily for me rates as one of the best theater going experiences of my life and the movie on DVD is just as exciting. This one is no doubt one of my very favorite action movies of all time and once again Sly shows age is just a number. Rambo has everything you can want in an action movie and more.",5,Rambo is back and better than ever,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,4661,"['success', 'Rocky', '1976', 'Stallone', 'would', 'have', 'character', 'would', 'go', 'down', 'cinema', 'history', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'world', '1982', 'release', 'First', 'Blood', 'John', 'Rambo', 'would', 'join', 'Rocky', 'yet', 'Iconic', 'character', 'Stallone.But', 'came', 'time', 'when', 'things', 'must', 'end', '2nd', 'Rambo', 'flick', 'was', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'made', 'total', '150-million', 'dollars', '1985', 'almost', 'everyone', 'US', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'popularity', 'character', 'Rambo', 'III', 'would', 'only', 'gross', '53-million', 'would', 'put', 'end', 'series', 'Even', 'Rocky', 'V', 'would', 'be', 'flop', '1990', 'seemed', 'two', 'Iconic', 'characters', 'were', 'done', 'for.Sly', 'would', 'have', 'success', 'failures', 'end', '90s', 'seemed', 'lot', 'more', 'failures', 'movies', 'even', 'going', 'DTV', 'biggest', 'action', 'star', 'seemed', 'Sly', 'was', 'thing', 'past', 'changed', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'laughing', '60-year', 'old', 'Stallone', 'playing', 'character', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'hit', 'nobody', 'was', 'laughing', 'saw', 'Stallone', 'could', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'success', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sly', 'was', 'now', 'ready', 'resurrect', 'John', 'Rambo', 'were', 'still', 'people', 'laughing', 'due', 'age', 'saying', 'age', 'just', 'number', 'Stallone', 'proved', 'time', 'Rambo', 'release', 'Stallone', 'was', '61-years', 'old', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Stallone', '60s', 'so', 'called', 'action', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'Stallone', 'age', 'Rambo', 'return', 'action', 'movie', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'American', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'besides', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Rambo', 'as', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'country', 'could', 'produce', 'matter', 'last', 'American', 'action', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Rambo', 'was', 'back', 'probably', '80s', 'early', '90s.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Art', 'Monterastelli', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'screenplay', 'good', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'well', 'developed', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'matter', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Rambo', 'flick', 'supporting', 'characters', 'watch', 'Rambo', 'character', 'script', ""n't"", 'best', 'what', 'audience', 'really', 'end', 'day', ""n't"", 'matters', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'what', 'audience', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'wrote', 'co-wrote', 'lot', 'movies', 'starred', 'odds', 'are', 'movies', 'co-wrote', 'did', 'better', 'suit', 'script', 'style', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Sly', 'great', 'writer', 'traditional', 'sense', 'guy', 'what', 'audience', 'delivers', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sly', 'showed', 'how', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'writer', 'was', 'actually', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Rocky', 'screenplay', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'won.Sly', 'also', 'steps', 'director', 'chair', 'first', 'time', 'franchise', 'wow', 'ever', 'deliver', 'Stallone', 'many', 'directing', 'credits', 'writing', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'Sly', 'great', 'director', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Again', 'Sly', 'what', 'audience', 'always', 'deliver', 'just', 'anything', 'really', 'think', 'Sly', 'getting', 'better', 'age', 'rare', 'Most', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'lose', 'touch', 'modern', 'audience', 'not', 'Sly', 'think', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'proved', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'even', 'touching', 'movie', 'Rambo', 'made', 'action', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'action', 'filmmaker', 'ever', 'done', 'Rambo', 'suspenseful', 'thrilling', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time.Rambo', 'borderline', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'opinion', 'violence', 'actually', 'quite', 'extreme', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'Nobody', 'Rambo', 'safe', 'men', 'women', 'even', 'children', 'are', 'murdered', ""n't"", 'toned', 'down', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flick', 'balls', 'wall', 'barred', 'brutal', 'movie', 'name', 'Rambo', 'decapitations', 'throats', 'being', 'ripped', 'out', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'down', 'die', 'get', 'ripped', 'shreds', 'arms', 'name', 'shot', 'running', 'time', 'Rambo', 'only', '80-minutes', 'not', 'counting', 'closing', 'credits', 'so', 'there', 'never', 'slow', 'moment', 'movie', 'always', 'forward', 'Rambo', 'light', 'plot', 'way', 'lot', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'Rambo', 'easily', 'rates', 'one', 'best', 'theater', 'going', 'experiences', 'life', 'movie', 'DVD', 'just', 'exciting', 'one', 'doubt', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'action', 'movies', 'time', 'once', 'again', 'Sly', 'age', 'just', 'number', 'Rambo', 'everything', 'can', 'want', 'action', 'movie', 'more']",N/A
1151034,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,B0015XHP22,David Baltazar,"[2, 3]","This review is from;Rambo (Special Edition + Digital Copy)After Sylvestor Stallone completed the satisfactory ""Rocky Balboa"" in 2006, we get the final chapter in the ""Rambo"" series this year. I was very pleased with this effort as should many other fans of the ""Rambo"" series.Similar to part three, John Rambo (Stallone) is in Asia again (Thailand) working as a snake collector and boat captain. Rambo seems very content to what he is doing and shows no desire to go back to America or get involved in any action. Although there is no Colonel Troutman (the late Richard Crenna unfortunately died in 2003) or other officials to recruit him for any missions, a small group of Christian missionaries approach Rambo requesting his boat services. The missionaries indicate their desire to go to the war ravaged Burma to help aid the Karen (pronounced ""Kareen"") Rebels who oppose the abusive, military dictatorship of Burma.Despite repeated refusals from Rambo to take them up river to Burma, the missionaries persist in their request, especially the young woman, Sarah Miller (played by Julie Benz). Rambo ultimately agrees and drops them off, but things ultimately go wrong as we would expect. Rambo is approached again by another member of the missionaries' congregation requesting Rambo now take a group of battle ready mercenaries to the same drop off point to find the now, lost missionaries. The mercenaries are led by the over-talkative Lewis (played by Graham McTavish). Somehow, I kept waiting for Rambo to punch Lewis in the face when Lewis taunts him relentlessly, but no such luck! Rambo agrees to transport the mercenaries by boat and ultimately gets involved in the action too just as we would easily predict again.From here on, the film now becomes the blood battle that we expect and it is very violent. The version of the film in this DVD is the same one that was shown theatrically, so there is no director's cut, unrated cut or any other alternate version. Just the same one shown in the theater on DVD (at least for now until another DVD version of ""Rambo"" pops up in the future?). In fact, the film's producers were convinced that their finished product would have gotten a NC-17 rating, but they were surprised they got the R-rating from the film board.  Nevertheless, this is a violent film and once the violence starts it continues to get very violent! Ammunition fired from weapons & mines literally tear people to pieces! Of course Rambo himself is responsible for much of the carnage by his own custom blade (that he spends a lot of time making), trademark bow & arrow and his climatic 50-caliber machine gun ""mow down"" of the opposition!Without going into exact detail about how the film ends because that's purely up to you find out, I could only say the ending is reminiscent of ""First Blood"" as John Rambo now has come full circle as there is  a fitting/satisfying ending for the whole John Rambo series.As for the Special Edition 2-disc set of ""Rambo"" there is a feature-length commentary by Sylvester Stallone, six featurettes, deleted scenes and trailers for other Lions Gate films on DVD. The second DVD is the bonus digital copy of the film. The deleted scenes mainly deal with John Rambo's interaction with Sarah Miller. I could understand why these scenes were cut because they seem mostly repetitive in nature, but I enjoyed the ""talking in the boat during the rain"" scene the most, because we get slightly more, inspirational insights on what changes Rambo's mind to help the missionaries. Throughout the film you get the sense that Rambo has a genuine affection for Sarah. Not a sexual affection, but an affection of respect for her concerns and sincerity to help the helpless.  Even her simple question ""Don't you want to go home & see what it's like?"" has a heavy influence on Rambo near the end of the film.The featurettes range from six to about fifteen minutes in length.  The featurettes are ""It's a Long Road: Resurrection of an Icon"", ""A Score to Settle - Music of Rambo"", ""The Art of War: Completing Rambo"", ""The Weaponry of Rambo"", ""A Hero's Welcome: Release & Reaction"" and ""Legacy & Despair: The Struggle in Burma"".All of the featurettes are your standard behind the scenes, cast & film crew interviews with some film clips and weapons/locations details except for the ""Burma"" feature. In fact I found the Burma feature to be the most interesting because it covers the harsh REALITY of what is going on there now. The featurette is only about ten minutes in length, but contains some valuable information that must be seen which reflects not only the film's purpose to entertain, but to also bring attention to the struggling people of Burma. My co-worker and her husband are immigrants from Burma and they concur about how bad Burma's conditions really are under the current, military regime. The recent cyclone in Burma has only made matters much worse. The feature also points out how displeased the Burmese government is with the film and has threatened 10 years prison to anybody in Burma who possesses a copy of the movie ""Rambo"" and a life prison sentence to anybody selling it in Burma! Sylvester Stallone is of course banned from visiting Burma (not that he would want to go there anyways!). It is also interesting to note that the actor who played the Burmese captain had second thoughts about doing the film because his real family is in Burma and he had real fears about what the military government would do to them.  Courageously he did the film anyways believing the effort of bringing world attention to the Burma situation was more important!""The Ressurection of an Icon"" is an interesting featurette because Stallone discussed an  alternate script about Rambo going to Mexico before the Burma story was finalized. Rambo in Mexico? How different that could have been!  By the way actress, Julie Benz looks hot in the featurettes! At first, I didn't recognize her from her screen character, Sarah because they looked totally different! Apparently Julie Benz's involvement in the film had a personal effect on her because she has become an active speaker for the U.S. campaign for Burma as well as international efforts for human rights.In conclusion, I heavily recommend Rambo not just for fans of the series, but for anyone in general. It is a violent action movie so beware, but the Burma story merits some interest and attention. The film's line ""Live for Nothing, Die for Something!"" has become a battle cry for the people of Burma. Overall, I liked ""Rambo"" because it brings the whole Rambo series to a fitting end and concludes with a homage to the original film ""First Blood"".",4,"Satisfied with This Effort as ""Rambo"" Comes

1151036,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0015XHP22,David Girod,"[2, 3]","As a child of the 80's I grew up watching Stallone as Rambo. I wanted a knife with a compass so bad after seeing ""First Blood"" I could hardly see straight!! But I have to admit when I first heard that Stallone was going to milk the Rambo teet for another film, I had serious reservations. But I guess having Rambo help create the Taliban in Part III isn't the best way for one of America's heroes to go down in cinematic history.I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rambo"", it's a violent gore-fest which tries to cram in message about fighting for ""something"" in it's 80 minute run time. The basic story is you get some bible-thumpers who want to spread medecine and ""the word"" to the poor folks in war-torn Burma, and they want Rambo to guide them upriver into this stinking hell-hole. Well you know whats going to happen from the first moment Rambo leaves these do-gooders alone, but how it happens is a whole other matter. When the bad guys make an entrance.....they make an entrance. People getting blown up left and right, ripped to pieces by machine gun fire..and it's not like the old ""Rambo"" flicks where somebody would get shot and fall down, when someone gets shot here you see limbs come flying off, guts come pouring out, heads explode...it's some of the greatest gore effects this side of the ""Saw"" films. Seriously it's like ""Rambo"" meets ""Cannibal Holocaust"".Of course the main reason to see a Rambo film is to watch Rambo get his revenge. And this he does, and in true gruesome fashion. More limbs go flying and more noggins erupt in blood spouts, and of course Rambo puts his hunting knife and bow to great use.So, is ""Rambo"" a good film? I enjoyed it. But then, I love horror films so splatter doesn't really bother me too much. (If anything I kept thinking that whoever did these special effects really needs to be hired for the next ""Friday the 13th"" flick!). If you are squeamish, then this probably isn't the flick for you. If you are looking for the rah-rah go America Rambo of the 80's, you'll probably be disappointed as well, as Rambo himself makes it clear he isn't fighting for country or god..he's just fighting for himself. Also, if you are looking for Rambo to be a one-man extermination squad, you'll probably be disappointed as well. This film is more like ""Team Rambo"" with several mercenaries thrown in to help Rambo out. But if you don't mind the blood, and just want to watch Rambo kick some butt, then you will enjoy this flick.",3,"""God didn't save you.....we did""",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2466,"['child', '80', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Stallone', 'Rambo', 'wanted', 'knife', 'compass', 'so', 'bad', 'seeing', 'First', 'Blood', 'could', 'hardly', 'see', 'straight', 'have', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Stallone', 'was', 'going', 'milk', 'Rambo', 'teet', 'film', 'had', 'serious', 'reservations', 'guess', 'having', 'Rambo', 'help', 'create', 'Taliban', 'Part', 'III', ""n't"", 'best', 'way', 'one', 'America', 'heroes', 'go', 'down', 'cinematic', 'history.I', 'have', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Rambo', 'violent', 'gore-fest', 'cram', 'message', 'fighting', 'something', '80', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'basic', 'story', 'get', 'bible-thumpers', 'who', 'want', 'spread', 'medecine', 'word', 'poor', 'folks', 'war-torn', 'Burma', 'want', 'Rambo', 'guide', 'upriver', 'stinking', 'hell-hole', 'Well', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'first', 'moment', 'Rambo', 'do-gooders', 'alone', 'how', 'whole', 'other', 'matter', 'When', 'bad', 'guys', 'make', 'entrance', '..they', 'make', 'entrance', 'People', 'getting', 'blown', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'ripped', 'pieces', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire..and', 'not', 'old', 'Rambo', 'where', 'somebody', 'would', 'get', 'shot', 'fall', 'down', 'when', 'someone', 'shot', 'here', 'see', 'limbs', 'come', 'flying', 'off', 'come', 'pouring', 'out', 'heads', 'explode', 'greatest', 'gore', 'effects', 'side', 'Saw', 'films', 'Seriously', 'Rambo', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', '.Of', 'course', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'Rambo', 'film', 'watch', 'Rambo', 'get', 'revenge', 'true', 'gruesome', 'fashion', 'More', 'limbs', 'go', 'flying', 'more', 'noggins', 'erupt', 'blood', 'spouts', 'course', 'Rambo', 'hunting', 'knife', 'bow', 'great', 'use.So', 'Rambo', 'good', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'so', 'splatter', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'anything', 'kept', 'thinking', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'be', 'hired', 'next', 'Friday', '13th', 'flick', 'are', 'squeamish', 'then', 'probably', ""n't"", 'flick', 'are', 'looking', 'rah-rah', 'go', 'America', 'Rambo', '80', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'as', 'well', 'Rambo', 'clear', ""n't"", 'fighting', 'country', 'god..he', 'just', 'fighting', 'Also', 'are', 'looking', 'Rambo', 'be', 'one-man', 'extermination', 'squad', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'more', 'Team', 'Rambo', 'several', 'mercenaries', 'thrown', 'help', 'Rambo', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'blood', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'Rambo', 'kick', 'butt', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'flick']",N/A

Rambo the fight continues is a beautiful film and yes I know how strange it is that the word beautiful could be associated with anything that Stallone does let alone ANY war film. As star, director, producer and writer Sly certainly had his hands full, but it is because of his meticulous attention to detail that we are treated to a visual extravaganza that is oft times so realistic, you will be moved to tears.Rambo the fight continues depicts John Rambo as the loner we know on a deep personal journey when he is confronted by missionaries who ask for John's help in getting into war torn Burma. When the missionaries don't return, John Rambo feels obligated to join a group of mercenaries to retrieve the hostages. The atrocities depicted in the film are a real life daily occurrence for the people living in Burma, and it is because of this reality that the story rings so true. Sly's gritty, jittery camera work and frenetic direction tell the story as though we were seeing all of it through the eyes and mind of John Rambo. Regardless of how you feel about Sly and his former efforts, see Rambo the Fight Continues if for no other reason, it is the most realistic war film ever created. Be prepared when you start the film, however, as it doesn't hold back anything.

Case,"[0, 0]","When 'Rambo' was released last winter, it was either ignored or excoriated by the mainstream media (with the notable exception of 'Entertainment' magazine) largely for political reasons. Showing an evil Communist dictatorship was just not politically correct.Flash forward to May. A cyclone kills tens of thousands in Myanmar. The dictatorship refuses international aid, and sells on the open market relief supplies destined for the starving masses.It is in this vein that 'Rambo' exists.Living on the Thai- Myanmar (Burma) border, John Rambo is eking out a living catching cobras for the local bazaars. He is hired by missionaries to take them into Myanmar to give aid to the Karen tribesman, who have been the target of an official genocide campaign by the junta for over 40 years.Naturally, things go sideways, and the missionaries are captured. The head of the Christian mission (Ken Howard) comes to Thailand with a smallband of mercenaries and task Rambo to guide them to the spot where they were taken. Reluctant to get involved, John Rambo is a study in PTSD- which he first demonstrated in the iconic 'First Blood'. Still, he agreesand then the action begins.Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a very real condition and Stallone heas always been honest in it's portrayal- including the side effects. It is in this emotional framework that his character exists. Nothing cartoonishabout it...When you watch this film keep in mind the enemies in it are very real and exist much as they are portrayed. The only real flaw in the film is it's brevity- it could actually use 10 or 12 more minutes of exposition.Shot on location in Thailand, Stallone's life was in constant danger. The object of continuous death threats, it was a rugged shoot. Looking great at 62, the technical detail is impressive as are the stunts.A fitting companion to his Rocky series finale, 'Rambo' is eminently worth watching.Don Case",4,Overlooked Classic,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1911,"['When', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'winter', 'was', 'either', 'ignored', 'excoriated', 'mainstream', 'media', 'notable', 'exception', ""'Entertainment"", 'magazine', 'largely', 'political', 'reasons', 'Showing', 'evil', 'Communist', 'dictatorship', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'politically', 'correct.Flash', 'forward', 'May', 'A', 'cyclone', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Myanmar', 'dictatorship', 'international', 'aid', 'open', 'market', 'relief', 'supplies', 'destined', 'starving', 'masses.It', 'vein', ""'Rambo"", 'exists.Living', 'Thai-', 'Myanmar', 'Burma', 'border', 'John', 'Rambo', 'eking', 'out', 'living', 'catching', 'cobras', 'local', 'bazaars', 'hired', 'missionaries', 'take', 'Myanmar', 'give', 'aid', 'Karen', 'tribesman', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'target', 'official', 'genocide', 'campaign', 'junta', '40', 'years.Naturally', 'things', 'go', 'sideways', 'missionaries', 'are', 'captured', 'head', 'Christian', 'mission', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'Thailand', 'smallband', 'mercenaries', 'task', 'Rambo', 'guide', 'spot', 'where', 'were', 'taken', 'Reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'John', 'Rambo', 'study', 'PTSD-', 'first', 'demonstrated', 'iconic', 'Blood', 'Still', 'then', 'action', 'begins.Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'very', 'real', 'condition', 'Stallone', 'heas', 'always', 'been', 'honest', 'portrayal-', 'including', 'side', 'effects', 'emotional', 'framework', 'character', 'exists', 'Nothing', 'cartoonishabout', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'enemies', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'exist', 'much', 'are', 'portrayed', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'film', 'brevity-', 'could', 'actually', 'use', '10', '12', 'more', 'minutes', 'exposition.Shot', 'location', 'Thailand', 'Stallone', 'life', 'was', 'constant', 'danger', 'object', 'continuous', 'death', 'threats', 'was', 'rugged', 'shoot', 'Looking', 'great', '62', 'technical', 'detail', 'impressive', 'are', 'stunts.A', 'fitting', 'companion', 'Rocky', 'series', 'finale', 'eminently', 'worth', 'watching.Don', 'Case']",N/A
1151040,ACXDDDPTK8OL,B0015XHP22,Deckard,"[86, 89]","Well I must admit I had to have this, cos let's face it, it's Rambo. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy and was a huge fan of Stallone's recent revival of the character in 'John Rambo' which i thought was a raw and gritty supercharged action film yet with depth of character and story that easily surpassed any of it's disposable contemporaries. Make no bones about it; ""the expendables"" sticker on the front the ""expendables"" trailer; the trailers of films from all of the actors in the ""expendables"" - this is a pure money making and marketing combo to tie in with the release of Sly's latest actioner. BUT, I have to say, what whilst expecting nothing more than the all new ""Rambo - to hell and back"" production diaries special feature, and maybe a couple of extended scenes in the movie, I was actually really surprised at just how different this new cut of the film is.This is not just the theatrical cut with a couple of extra bits, this is a true director's cut style extended edition with a completely re-edited opening, many extended takes, many alternate takes, and whole new extra scenes that all blend seemlessly to really compliment and add much to the film. A lot of this really helps to elaborate the story, and really flesh out character and themes that whilst hinted at in the original, were never really fully explored. When Rambo says in the original ""no, what you're trying to do is change what is"", and Sara asks him ""and what is?""; he just says ""go home"". I always used to wonder, ""yeah, what is??"". Well, a whole knew alternate take here reveals all, and also a few real home truths about his real feelings about war and regret. And that's not all, you find out so much more about the characters, their relationships, motivation, and so many tiny insertions of lines here and there, very subtle shot changes, alternate dialog, black and white flashbacks, that it's almost an entirely new take on the film. It's all great stuff!A word of warning tho, there do appear to be a few cuts and alterations to some of the more violent and extreme/controversial scences. Some of these bits are alternate takes (when the main bad guy leader takes delivery of the young village boy for example), but others are just plain removed, or cut short. The child being stabbed in the attack on the village is missing, the guy flying though the air with both legs blown off is cut short, the bearded mercenary stabbing the solider under the hut is removed, and a few other bits that seemed slightly shortened. I should add that these alterations are VERY few, I probably counted 5 or 6, and doubt that this was a censorship issue as the majority of the blood soaked limb exploding violence is completely intact. I'd imagine this was purely a directorial/artistic decision, (a lot of the excised scenes were digital effects, some of which don't stand up quite as effectively as others). Something to bear in mind though before you buy!The stunning MPEG 4 AVC encoded 1080p picture and 7.1 dts hd master audio remain, giving an blu-ray experience of reference quality, just like the original lionsgate release.

Stallone takes this view and goes just a tiny bit overboard.  While this movie can't honestly be accused of racism, Stallone's depiction of a monolithic and relentlessly sadistic Burmese military does provide a hilarious caricature.  But that is part of this movie's shambling appeal.  Stallone is content to construct a faceless gang of nefarious automatons as an enemy, for the sole purpose of finding new and creative ways to slaughter them.  In terms of stylized violence and action sequences, Rambo is probably the best film of the year.  Sure, the dialogue is cheesy, the characters are wooden, the plot is laughable and half the film makes no sense, but trust me, you will never see orgies of gratuitous violence constructed with such care and affection as they are in this film.When Stallone says, before using his trusty bow to fire an arrow through the skull of some Burmese fascist: ""Live for nothing, or die for something."", you might think to yourself: are those really my only two options?  Hasn't Rambo just managed to contradict himself 3 or 4 times in one sentence? And finally: if you can only live for nothing, how is it possible to die for something?

Nevertheless and anyway you look at it, ""John Rambo"" is no farewell story, nor is it heartfelt or gentle.Previous releases of the franchise had political agendas interwoven throughout: ""First Blood"" dealt with the tremendous difficulties American Vietnam War Veterans faced upon returning to the country that had sent them to a war it later wanted to forget. ""Part II"" covered the issue of Vietnam War left-behind POWs and ""Rambo III"" praised the fight of the Afghanian people against the oppressing Soviet occupation. The new Rambo release brings to light the plight of the Karen, an ethnic group in Burma (Myanmar) that is suffering from persecutions under a ruthless ruling junta.All the way, Stallone's Rambo is the hero everybody knows, and more: tougher than ever, frustrated, strong, courageous, protector of the weak, extremely violent and still capable of wreaking havoc wherever and whenever it's needed. Way back, the name Rambo has become synonym with a description of a soldier that has acted in a heroic manner above and beyond the call of duty and this last installment reinforces this reputation; more than once when all hope is lost comes Rambo to show that God does exist. Over and above, take into account that this film is one of the bloodiest ever and the body count statistics rise well above those of its predecessors. Stallone sums it all up with one of the quadrilogy's best one liners - ""when you're pushed - killing is as easy as breathing"".In an extraordinary timing, ""Rambo"" was in production in the summer of 2007 when the most serious uprising of the last years against the junta erupted in Burma, mostly in the capital Yangon. The protestors, led by revered monks, were rather peaceful and demonstrated by marching along the streets to show their discontent from the persecutions and oppression and their need for a change in the country. The protests were crashed shortly afterwards without any significant changes or reforms. In the face of this reality ""John Rambo"" carries one prominent message: Defying the totalitarian regime peacefully is futile and in order to be freed the Burmese folks will have to unite, fight, sacrifice and seek help from the outside.

1151055,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B0015XHP22,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[2, 4]","As a huge Stallone fan, I really looked forward to 2006's Rocky Balboa. And it paid off dearly. So shortly after hearing that ole Sly was bringing back his other 80's icon John Rambo for a fourth time, I quickly was reminded how well he brought back Mr. Balboa into a new generation. This was going to be a cinch, right?Well, not really. After seeing leaked trailers months before the film's release, the public quickly found out just how graphic this film was going to be. Limbs blown off, bullet wounds spraying, and people just exploding like never seen in a Rambo film. And trust me, while seeing the actual film, they are still in there, but what would be left without them? Not much really.It seems old Rambo's been hanging out in Thailand, as a ferry boat captain of some sorts that reluctantly is rented by some do-gooder group that wants to bring medicine & supplies to a nameless area of war-torn Burma. Of course, minutes after dropping them off all Hell breaks loose, and eventually Rambo, this time paired with an amazingly stereotypical mercenaries team, must go in to save whoevers left alive. Do I need to say more?Seriously, I shouldn't expect Apocalypse Now here, but after the greatness in story of Rocky Balboa, which Sly also wrote, there should have been more here than just porn levels of gore and old Sly in a T-Shirt, demoted of course from his tank-top/shirtless days gone by. Even the baddie was weak for Rambo standards, with no lines or flair of past protaginists.Also, the runtime is awfully short, and it does go quick yet with that empty feeling. As for the disc, here's what got me. I saw the 1 disc version, and when it comes to bare-bones, wow this one really takes the cake. While Disc One of the more expensive 2 Disc Edition has commentary, featurettes, and tons of bonus features on the same disc as the movie, the 1 Disc Version is movie and that's it. Hell, it's even on a single layer disc. This wouldn't be all that bad, but considering that Disc Two of the bigger edition is nothing but the IPod version of the film, to release two different Disc One's seems really cheap. So even though the 2 Disc is usually only 5 dollars more than the 1, even if you ""just want the movie"", it still seems like a rip-off when most 2 Disc sets feature the same disc but with an extra one in addition to.Overall, I was slighly disapointed in my man, Sly. This could have been a more broader, fuller send-off than this. Sure, congrats to the man to get away with such graphicness in an ""R"" rated film (Jeez, this wasn't Unrated?...WOW!), but even gorehounds like me need a little more in between the head-rolling. Well, at least Rocky got the better walk-off in the sunset....",3,Rambo Deserves A Better Send-Off Than This...,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,2703,"['huge', 'Stallone', 'fan', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', '2006', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'paid', 'off', 'dearly', 'So', 'shortly', 'hearing', 'ole', 'Sly', 'was', 'bringing', 'back', 'other', '80', 'icon', 'John', 'Rambo', 'fourth', 'time', 'quickly', 'was', 'reminded', 'how', 'well', 'brought', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Balboa', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cinch', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'seeing', 'leaked', 'trailers', 'months', 'film', 'release', 'public', 'quickly', 'found', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'graphic', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Limbs', 'off', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'spraying', 'people', 'just', 'exploding', 'never', 'seen', 'Rambo', 'film', 'trust', 'seeing', 'actual', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'Not', 'much', 'really.It', 'old', 'Rambo', 'been', 'hanging', 'out', 'Thailand', 'ferry', 'boat', 'captain', 'sorts', 'reluctantly', 'rented', 'do-gooder', 'group', 'bring', 'medicine', 'supplies', 'nameless', 'area', 'war-torn', 'Burma', 'course', 'minutes', 'dropping', 'off', 'Hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'eventually', 'Rambo', 'time', 'paired', 'amazingly', 'stereotypical', 'mercenaries', 'team', 'must', 'go', 'save', 'whoevers', 'left', 'alive', 'Do', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'Seriously', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'here', 'greatness', 'story', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sly', 'also', 'wrote', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'here', 'just', 'porn', 'levels', 'gore', 'old', 'Sly', 'T-Shirt', 'demoted', 'course', 'tank-top/shirtless', 'days', 'gone', 'Even', 'baddie', 'was', 'weak', 'Rambo', 'standards', 'lines', 'flair', 'past', 'protaginists.Also', 'runtime', 'awfully', 'short', 'go', 'quick', 'yet', 'empty', 'feeling', 'disc', 'here', 'what', 'got', 'saw', '1', 'disc', 'version', 'when', 'bare-bones', 'wow', 'one', 'really', 'cake', 'Disc', 'One', 'more', 'expensive', '2', 'Disc', 'Edition', 'commentary', 'featurettes', 'tons', 'bonus', 'features', 'same', 'disc', 'movie', '1', 'Disc', 'Version', 'movie', 'Hell', 'even', 'single', 'layer', 'disc', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'considering', 'Disc', 'Two', 'bigger', 'edition', 'nothing', 'IPod', 'version', 'film', 'release', 'two', 'different', 'Disc', 'One', 'really', 'cheap', 'So', 'even', '2', 'Disc', 'usually', 'only', '5', 'dollars', 'more', '1', 'even', 'just', 'want', 'movie', 'still', 'rip-off', 'when', 'most', '2', 'Disc', 'sets', 'feature', 'same', 'disc', 'extra', 'one', 'addition', 'to.Overall', 'was', 'slighly', 'disapointed', 'man', 'Sly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'broader', 'fuller', 'send-off', 'Sure', 'congrats', 'man', 'get', 'away', 'such', 'graphicness', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'Jeez', 'was', ""n't"", 'Unrated', 'WOW', 'even', 'gorehounds', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'head-rolling', 'Well', 'least', 'Rocky', 'got', 'better', 'walk-off', 'sunset']",N/A

The original Rambo I and II, and Scharzeneggers ""commando"" have violence in them, but the producers don't delight in showing someones guts get knifed out in the name of entertainment.However, this Rambo comes across as nothing more than killing for an evenings entertainment. There is no need for such gratuitous violence, it doesn't add to the story line.There are scenes when children are slaughtered, women are gang raped and a mans legs are eaten off by a pig.  And that's on top of betting on which prisoner dies first when running across a paddy field with land mines in it. This movie was rated R for a very good reason.  This movie really shouldn't be shown to children, it will upset them.The (well acted) personal turmoil John Rambo goes through is the sole redeeming feature of this film.

It's much grittier than the previous movies. None of the dialog felt forced and there wasn't any of the annoying hokey humor that I disliked in some of the movies.The only thing I would have changed was the too long b&w; flashback in the middle of the movie. I felt they could have shorted that considerably or possibly even removed it entirely.All action movies have tons of violence, but it's often not very gritty. It's often just a bullet to the bad guy and they go down. There is some serious bloody violence in this movie and I absolutely love it.I really liked the way that Stallone played Rambo in this one. Strangely, I think he actually looks better in this movie than in the previous ones. In previous movies he was just a big musclebound hero. In this one he looks like a huge chiseled stone giant.Some people think that action heroes should throw in the towel when they get older.

I'd certainly rather watch Sly slay evil-doers than watch him wallow in self-pity over Adrienne once again. Rambo is back in the jungle where he belongs, doing manly things, looking quite buff for a Vietnam vet, I must say. But still fighting his inner demons as he pounds out the iron ware and ventures forth into the night.The basic plot line is as black and white as any ever written, and pretty bare bones at that. They've found the perfect villians in the Burmese Army, perhaps one of the few groups other than the janjaweed, whom no one will shed a tear for. And we get some pretty nasty scenes to help us uderstand just how much these folks need killing. Versus the Christian Karin rebels who've been valiently fighting the Burmese government for decades. Then throw in a group of evangelical Christian do-gooders boldly going into the Heart of Darkness itself. So, Rambo is literally on the side of the Angels on this one, sort of St. Michael with a 50 cal, blowing holes in bad guys you can see through.For me, the interesting moment is when Rambo comes to the self-realization that he hasn't been fighting and killing all these years for God and country. He does it because that's who he is, that's what he does. And even the head evangelical, having shown his extreme distain for Rambo early on eventually comes to accept the need for violence in another defining moment and kills his own bad guy before it's all over.But, it's a non-stop thrill ride beyond any doubt.

She like me was instantly hooked into the realistic feel of the action scenes and the evil of the bad guys.One thing I noticed that for all the realistic look to the battle scenes, they had a weird camera effect of old battlefield films from Viet Nam, and WWII. I don't want to spoil the film by giving away the story line so I'll just say this, Rambo is even more graphically violent than 300300 (Two-Disc Special Edition), GladiatorGladiator - Extended Edition (Three-Disc Extended Edition), or BraveheartBraveheart (Special Collector's Edition), so if you are put off by violence of every kind, blood and gore (and brief glimpses of perversion), then this is not a film to even consider watching. However, it is a surprisingly moving film, that reminds us that there are bad guys in the world more evil than we can readily imagine. It is also a moving tale of acceptance for the protagonist. It is an action film that doesn't waste time on pointless dialogue except to help you understand who the characters are, rather than to be the story.So here's the deal, this is not a movie for everyone, but every one should understand at least on some level the lessons that this movie teaches.But that's just me.",5,Graphically (and necessarily violent) film.,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,1581,"['downloaded', 'unbox', 'version', 'Rambo', 'Tivo', 'way', 'excellent', 'quality', 'watch', 'HDTV', 'watched', 'last', 'night.My', 'wife', 'not', 'Stallone', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'started', 'soon', 'was', 'watching', 'yelling', 'sweetheart', 'movie', 'yeller', 'Did', 'see', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'realistic', 'feel', 'action', 'scenes', 'evil', 'bad', 'guys.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'realistic', 'look', 'battle', 'scenes', 'had', 'weird', 'camera', 'effect', 'old', 'battlefield', 'films', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'WWII', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'line', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Rambo', 'even', 'more', 'graphically', 'violent', '300300', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'GladiatorGladiator', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Three-Disc', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'BraveheartBraveheart', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'so', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'violence', 'kind', 'blood', 'gore', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'perversion', 'then', 'not', 'film', 'even', 'consider', 'watching', 'However', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'film', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'world', 'more', 'evil', 'can', 'readily', 'imagine', 'also', 'moving', 'tale', 'acceptance', 'protagonist', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'pointless', 'dialogue', 'help', 'understand', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'be', 'story.So', 'here', 'deal', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'one', 'should', 'understand', 'least', 'level', 'lessons', 'movie', 'just']",N/A

John's response is ""You're not bringing weapons?  Then you're not changing anything.""This is where the film becomes predictable.[SPOILERS!]After John turns the people down, a girl comes in and says to let her try.  Obviously, you know that she will be able to talk John into taking them to Burma.  Once they're on his boat, you know that she and her people will be kidnapped.  Once that happens, you know that John is going to try to save her.  Once John is on his way, you know that both he and the girl will both get away (but that John will probably at least get shot once).[END OF SPOILERS]Because of the movie being so predictable, I was kind of just waiting for it to end the whole time.I also found it a bit annoying how during the final getaway battle, nearly the whole thing is done in fast motion, which is kind of like fake action and takes all of the drama and emotion out of the scene.While I know Sly tried to make a good movie here, I just think he focused too much on the action and not enough on the story.It was good to see once, but I don't think I'll be buying this movie.",2,Rambo 4: Blood & Gore,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1466,"['would', ""n't"", 'say', 'fourth', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'much.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'predictable.John', 'Rambo', 'confronted', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'boat', 'take', 'Burma', 'war', 'zone', 'can', 'bring', 'medicine', 'other', 'things', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'dying', 'John', 'response', ""'re"", 'not', 'bringing', 'weapons', 'Then', ""'re"", 'not', 'changing', 'anything', 'where', 'film', 'predictable.', '[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'John', 'people', 'down', 'girl', 'let', 'try', 'Obviously', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'John', 'taking', 'Burma', ""'re"", 'boat', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'Once', 'know', 'John', 'going', 'try', 'save', 'Once', 'John', 'way', 'know', 'girl', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'John', 'will', 'probably', 'least', 'get', 'shot', 'once', '[', 'END', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'predictable', 'was', 'kind', 'just', 'waiting', 'end', 'whole', 'time.I', 'also', 'found', 'bit', 'annoying', 'how', 'final', 'getaway', 'battle', 'nearly', 'whole', 'thing', 'done', 'fast', 'motion', 'kind', 'like', 'fake', 'action', 'drama', 'emotion', 'scene.While', 'know', 'Sly', 'tried', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'just', 'think', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'story.It', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'movie']",N/A

And here's why: bad guys and good guys, no ""nuanced"" portrayal, and ... worst of all ... there are Christians in the movie who are not wacky, homicidal, perverse, sadistic, or hypocritical! It's Hollywood's worst nightmare, and certainly not a movie I would have expected to see these days. I can't imagine what must have been going through Stallone's head to be making this movie. I wish this DVD had a commentary or some special feature to shed some light on this.What can I say? It's a beautifully shot (color-wise, that is) ballet of brutality, post-Saving Private Ryan. Not for the faint of heart. The pacing is perfect, the violence is horrible, when inflicted by Burmese militia upon innocents, and cathartic, when they're themselves shredded into bloody bits.I had read criticisms to the effect that the bad guys were portrayed as ""faceless"" cannon fodder. Not true. They are portrayed as psychopathic, sadistic rapists and murdererers, and this is the true face of evil: boring as hell. It's why modern portrayals of villains, such as Wesley Snipes' character in Demolition Man, are surprisingly boring: you know they'll shoot their buddy in the head at the drop of a hat, just to show they're really bad. When it happens, big yawn. In the end, all really evil men look the same, devoid of what makes them truly unique or human. Faceless.It's a reminder that out there are evil men with guns, ready to wreak havoc upon whomever they will, and that they will not be stopped by appeals to conscience. And it's a tribute to the soldier who defends the weak, perhaps at the cost of his own soul. In other words, a world totally alien to the progressive mindset of today.Horrible things are happening in the world, and they're screaming cluelessly about ... carbon footprints. (Even though last year's temperature drop alone was enough to ""wipe out"" all the ""warming"" of the last decade ... hilarious!) Under Saddam, husbands were kidnapped by the government and returned in pieces, or fed into shredders, and whole villages were wiped out with poison gas, and they're screaming about ... outlawing plastic bags and trans-fats and SUVs.What can I say?

At times there are scenes where the movie is pushing a message so hard I started to flash back to the Wayans spoof movie 'Don't Be A Menace While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood' where Keenen Wayan's mail man character would walk in after these &#34;deep&#34; lines and yell, &#34;Message!&#34;Overall, the movie does a good job of moving at a good pace. No lulls and plenty of ultra violence. Unfortunately, I think the over the top blood bath kind of took away from the movie. Imagine, a 1st person shooter video game where you see the body parts gibbed after each kill. That's pretty much what happens every time a weapon is fired. You get to see the bullet pass through the target's body or if it's an explosion and a person is too close, you'll see body parts fly off.This film tries to get back to showing the internal struggle and emotional scarring that First Blood presented so well but it seems to lose its way in all the action and explosions and other special effects.

Stallone said he was on a deadline to deliver the final cut of the movie, and, if given more time, THIS version is what he would have released first time around.Now running 99 minutes (with 11 still swallowed up by credits) we get a bit more character development, and a couple of scene re-arrangements along with a new on-screen title 'John Rambo'. There's not much more than that. The extended character scenes are even more repetitive than they already were featuring annoyingly circular dialogue that seems to go on forever without really going anywhere. The editing over these extended moments is really, really bad too. Lots of fades, lots of mis-matched cross-cutting, little sense of place or timing. Terrible!Rambo (or Fourth Blood as I call it) is, stylistically, a world away from the previous 3 movies. While the others were shot in lovely anamorphic Panavision/JDC-Scope, this one is shot in ugly, cheap, nasty Super-35. There are loads of fake filters too, which make it look like a hack episode of CSI. Stallone could have done better there. But the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst thing about this film is the overabundance of incredibly fake, totally unconvincing CGI blood effects, which take me out of the film every time. I don't care if Stallone was on a budget and a schedule, he could have sacrificed some of his paycheck to improve this. He claimed the film was intentionally super-violent because that's what war carnage is really like. Fine, good for you. But when he uses dozens of fake CGI deaths it completely ruins and cheapens whatever realism he was aiming for (pun intended).I suppose it's a hard juxtaposition and a sad testament to modern day action film-making where everything is fixed with cheap cheats in post-production, very little is actually there before the camera, and nothing is really made to last. When you compare Rambo to films of the equivalent 10-15 years ago, where most of the action, atmosphere and effects were done in-camera, when you actually felt like you were taken some place authentic and real, it makes you long for a revival of action movies where the action and danger is tangible and not just an afterthought by a lazy director. I find it odd that First Blood director Ted Kotcheff was a 'technical consultant' on Rambo, when there is really no similarity between them. First Blood felt raw and believable, while Rambo feels overly polished (to disguise the numerous faults) and fake.Yes, I am still giving it four stars as I am glad that the Rambo story finally came to a satisfying close and it was good to see him return home once and for all, though one can't help but think that would have happened 25 years sooner if it hadn't been for Sheriff Teasle, but after the realism of Rocky Balboa, Stallone should have delivered something better. He has the ability, but was clearly just seduced by the modern aesthetic and attitude.This Blu Ray features a nice 1080p 2.40:1 picture that brings out all the fakeness of the camera filters and a very, very loud DTS HD-MA sound design.

1151076,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B0015XHP22,JAG 2.0,"[0, 0]","In this, likely the last installment of the Rambo films, Sylvester Stallone once again plays former Green Beret, Vietnam Vet John Rambo. In this film, Rambo is back in Southeast Asia and living a quiet life with no desire to again ""make war"". Events cause him to once again become the lethal weapon of years past.John Rambo is contracted by a Christian missionary group to take them into Burma to bring both medical and spiritual healing to the people of remote Burma. Reluctantly, Rambo takes them into a place where the Burmese government is waging a genocidal war against the Karen people.When contact is lost with the missionaries, it is Rambo that is again contracted - this time to transport mercenaries to find and bring back the very people he had earlier taken upriver. In this film, John Rambo seems tired, old and adrift without anything in his life to anchor him. In this film, he seems to have found that missing element.I personally felt this the most sophisticated Rambo film in which he is not only challenged to re-evaluate his current and past life by one of the missionaries (Julie Benz, who gives and excellent performance) but also by the end of the film comes to grip with his past and seek a kind of redemption. This film is well acted and the cast give fine performances, especially Stallone and Benz. Cinematography, score and locations are all excellent.I liked this film and felt the tone of the movie was very different that most of these films and is the logical conclusion to the anger and rejection John Rambo conveyed to America in First Blood. I feel it brought closure to the man we met in the first film.Having said that, I did not care for the excessive bloodiness of the film's many action sequences. I often feel these types of films highlight the bloody special effects simply because they can - it's simply a showcase for specialist techniques whether the film is enhanced by them of not.I do recommend this film with four stars despite the overly brutal special effects.

This Rambo movie is not only the best in the Rambo series, but it's also one of the best action movies of all time.Did you think that Commando had a lot of killing?  BAH!Did you think that Saving Private Ryan had the most gruesome injuries?  Hardly.This movie is saturated with arms being cut off, legs exploding into bloody stumps, heads popping like over-inflated balloons, and enough gun-play to satisfy even the most hardcore, extremist gun-enthusiast.  If it isn't an arrow evenly dividing a man's skull, or someone's intestines being spilled on the ground, then it's an extreme amount of people being sawed in half by high calibre machine gun fire.  There's even a crazy-intense seen in which Rambo basically pulls off the throat removal move from Roadhouse, only with a little slower satisfaction to it.  About the only thing lacking is a Colombian necktie.The story itself plays second-fiddle to the incredible amount of action.  A church-group from Colorado is doing peacework in Burma, bringing medicine and religion to people oppressed by a militaristic regime intent on genocide.  To make their way into hostile territory, the church-goers ask for Rambo's services as a river guide.  At first he is hesitant, but the kind-hearted but deadly Rambo eventually consents.Sure enough, after Rambo drops them off for their jungle-trek to the villagers, the church-group gets caught in the middle of chaos, as the evil military members are senselessly slaughtering every villager in sight.  Once they are captured, it's up to Rambo to save the day.The rest of the movie is a whirlwind of action, as Rambo leads in a hardened group of mercenaries for an extraction mission.  They plan on sneaking into the compound, killing anything and anyone that gets in their way, and saving the prisoners.  What transpires is carnage the likes of which I have never seen before.This version of Rambo is an incredible movie if you're looking for pure action and entertainment from beginning to end.

The main characters were convincing, drawing you into the movie.  The fact that Burma recently had some poor press pertaining to the military government not allowing aid when the country obviously needed it makes you realize that there is probably some truth to this story.  Whether or not it is appropriate to paint the Burmese military dictatorship in this fashion can remain a topic of conversation for the ""scholars"" who will no doubt never watch this type of movie.

Man I hate reviews like that; does anyone else appreciate having an entire movie laid out, making sure that there's absolutely no surprise when watching the film?  You don't need to watch the movie anymore, you just read it.Alright 1st off, maybe Rambo isn't for everyone.  However, anyone that's ever enjoyed even a seconds worth of this American icon will absolutely love this movie.  It must be seen by all as far as I'm concerned just so that it's given it's due.  The sad part is that most people have forgotten what an icon Rambo was in the 80's, what a hero he was to alot of people.  Alot of the younger crowd don't even know who this character is anymore.  Well, not for long as this is the film that will bring the character back from the dead.  Once again Stallone has rejuvinated one of his iconic roles (much like Rocky Balboa last year)This is by far the very best Rambo film since ""First Blood"".  The 2 prior sequals lost the realism & were primarily cheezy popcorn fluff war movies.  This one kinda brings our hero back into the real world.  It's still Rambo, he's just not the one man taking on entire platoons & military camps all by himself anymore.  In this film we see an apropriately aged John Rambo having to once again jump into a war torn area for a fight.  There's a certain symolism to this film that just feels right when ol' Ram-ey starts tearing into people in this movie.  To top it all off, if nothing else it brings closure & a good ending to the series.  I don't mean to come off like one of those ultra, flag humping, gun nuts, I just really liked this movie & think that everyone else will too.Bottom line, there are 1,000,000 reasons to go watch this movie.  Is it violent?  Yes, but shouldn't war movies be violent?  Do we really wanna see a war movie without including the horrific images included?  Wouldn't that be irresponsible?

And it's hard to say whether it was more violent than Passion because of how slow and excruciating the violence was, but sheer body counts I can say this one is amazingly high. I think Rambo kills HUNDREDS himself. He gets behind a fifty cal and firstly, decimates at point blank a couple of burma's and then just squeezes the trigger for what I think is his own genicide. But these guys really deserved it! But if you think about it, those young boys he killed were just victims themselves. They were stollen from their villages and forced into an abusive army under threat that everyone back home (left) would be killed off horribly. I loved this movie, it is sort of one of those action movies from the eighties that doesn't get made anymore. Awesome start to the Year.Stallone wears the face of a war veteran, even more true than ever before. I watched his acting believing that he had lost hope with humanity. That the world had kicked him around all of his life, and that he trusts no one. It is in his eyes and his slow, direct speech. And Stallone is still in really great physical shape for his age. It is amazing that he is still making action movies after a lifetime of doing them. And rumor has it, he will be doing more! It's just incredible to me that Stallone is playing the role such as this, that requires so much physicality, such as firing huge, anti-vehicle weapons, and even using his trademark bow and arrow! His longevity is endless, and this act isn't stale, it's refreshing of all things!

A lot people has seen Rocky Balboa and loved the movie, but wait until Stallone gathers all of his strength and places all of his energy into making John Rambo, the fourth Rambo film of the saga. It's definitely not an upgrade from any previous Rambo installment; it's just the next one. The dialog is very 'Stallone-esque' (lots of cheesy tag lines that sometimes hit and sometimes miss) but tolerable if you keep your expectations realistic being that it's a Stallone movie.For Rambo lovers and non-Rambo lovers the story is simple enough. John Rambo tells the story of John leading a group of mercenaries up a river, and takes them deep into the jungles of Burma to rescue a religious group that have been taken captive after a village was burned to the ground, and the villagers were brutally murdered, one by one. I really enjoyed this flick During the movie he is referred to by his name John or as ""boatman.""  Stallone wants to distance his character from ""super soldier"" from the man Rambo was in the last two movies. He is no longer a hotshot. So no wonder he is not breaking teeth when he gets insulted by the leader of the mercenaries. It does not matter anymore but once the Rambo comes out he fights so ferociously as if his soul was already burning in hell for those 20 years after we last saw him in Afghanistan. As if his desperation, anger, sadness, guilt altogether explode on the screen. It's not pretty, it's not enjoyable and there is no easy way talking about it.The character development is pretty poor with the main character jumping into a trusting relationship w/ the female lead the instant he makes eye contact without any real explanation as to why. The chemistry between these two was virtually non-existent, but this was probably due to just poor writing more so than casting issues. This may have also been a product of the very fast pace of the film as it really jumps right into the action, but it wasn't a very long movie so they could have done it a little more justice by making it somewhat believable. I think they did a better job with this in First Blood. The team really put together a shocking and graphic representation of war with all of the 'bits and pieces.' I was smiling in amazement of how realistic everything looked and ashamed at the same time for grinning at something so violent.Still, even with the flaws above it doesn't need a continuing sequel and I think Stallone knows that. Got to pay tribute to this man because he had portrayed one of the best Action Hero's and at the same time reminded us what an action movie is all about. John Rambo came full circle with himself as well as his character's realization for his fans. Any doubt that action movies are dead? Look no further, Stallone still got it.

1151087,A680RUE1FDO8B,B0015XHP22,Jerry Saperstein,"[4, 5]","Many years ago, a then famous novelist named John Hersey wrote an anti-war novel about WWII pilot Buzz Marrow. Marrow loved war and didn't want see his war end. It was because of people like Marrow, the war lovers, that wars existed maintained Hersey.Well, some people are born to be soldiers and we Americans are much better off for the Pattons, Washingtons, Grants and many others whose names are not famous, but who believed enough in the nation to put their lives at risk.Relatively few people have ever read the original David Morrell novel ""First Blood"" that gave birth to John Rambo, a man for whom the Vietnam war never ended. Sylvester Stallone turned Rambo into a fire breathing patriot and the world (of cinema and American culture, at least) has never been the same.A much older Rambo lives now in Southeast Asia. (Hasrd to believe that Stallone is 62!) He captures snakes and runs a rickety old river boat for a living. Rambo is still the very conflicted man, a man born for war trying to live peacefully.Some missionaries - caricatured as hopelessly naive, optimistic and frankly lacking in rationality - want Stallone to take them into Burma. The film opens with a montage of the political and military violence in Burma to provide a bare minimum storyline for the film to rest on.John Rambo wants no part of them: he asks if they know that Burma is a war zone and if they have weapons. Yes to the first question, no to the second and Rambo says no. Later, the fiancee of one of the missionaries persuades him to take them. Rambo's conflict comes to the surface when they encounter a boatload of river pirates. He tries everything to placate the pirates and when then doesn't work . . . well, he is John Rambo, isn't he?Do I have to tell you that the missionaries are captured by the Burmese military in an orgy of mayhem, violence, murder, sadism and rape? Do I have to tell you that this movie obviously had a huge budget for special effects? Do you really think that a gunshot wound in this film looks like dab of ketchup on a shirt? Nope. Limbs fly, heads shatter and blood flows by the barrel. These bad guys are really, truly bad.Another missionary approaches John Rambo and asks him to take a team of mercenaries to rescue the captured missionaries. Rambo refuses; Rambo then accepts his date with destiny.The mercenaries are a rag tag group who try to goad the silent, taciturn Rambo. When they disembark to start on their rescue mission, they tell Rambo, the ""boat man"" to stay with the boat while they go do men's work.When the mercenaries encounter some bad guys, they sure glad that Rambo tagged along behind them. After saving them, Rambo now becomes the leader.The rest of the film is the rescue and the race to safety.Lots of gore, lots of mayhem, lots of great, adrenaline stimulating action.This is a classic American movie. The lone gunman against hordes of bad guys. Rambo is smarter and meaner than a million zillion bad guys - that's the joy of movies, isn't it?This is a movie for people who like action movies. The storyline is paper thin. The Rambo character is one we are familiar and comfortable with. If you didn't like Rambo before, you won't like Rambo now. The other characters are all cartoons.None of that matters. What matters is the basic ethos: good guy faces impossible odds - good guy wins. For the benefit of the foreign markets that are so important to the financial success of American films, there isn't any flag waving. But there is a lot of action, a lot of violence, great special effects.In short, a very satisfying movie for those who like this kind of film. Others might be well advised to stay away.Jerry",5,A simply told sory of good versus evil with barrels of fake blood and great special effcts.,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,3667,"['Many', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'famous', 'novelist', 'named', 'John', 'Hersey', 'wrote', 'anti-war', 'novel', 'WWII', 'pilot', 'Buzz', 'Marrow', 'Marrow', 'loved', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'war', 'end', 'was', 'people', 'Marrow', 'war', 'lovers', 'wars', 'existed', 'maintained', 'Hersey.Well', 'people', 'are', 'born', 'be', 'soldiers', 'Americans', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'Pattons', 'Washingtons', 'Grants', 'many', 'others', 'names', 'are', 'not', 'famous', 'who', 'believed', 'enough', 'nation', 'put', 'lives', 'risk.Relatively', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'original', 'David', 'Morrell', 'First', 'Blood', 'gave', 'birth', 'John', 'Rambo', 'man', 'whom', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'never', 'ended', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'turned', 'Rambo', 'fire', 'breathing', 'patriot', 'world', 'cinema', 'American', 'culture', 'least', 'never', 'been', 'same.A', 'much', 'older', 'Rambo', 'lives', 'now', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Hasrd', 'believe', 'Stallone', '62', 'snakes', 'rickety', 'old', 'river', 'boat', 'living', 'Rambo', 'still', 'very', 'conflicted', 'man', 'man', 'born', 'war', 'trying', 'live', 'peacefully.Some', 'missionaries', 'caricatured', 'hopelessly', 'naive', 'optimistic', 'frankly', 'lacking', 'rationality', 'want', 'Stallone', 'take', 'Burma', 'film', 'montage', 'political', 'military', 'violence', 'Burma', 'provide', 'bare', 'minimum', 'storyline', 'film', 'rest', 'on.John', 'Rambo', 'part', 'know', 'Burma', 'war', 'zone', 'have', 'weapons', 'Yes', 'first', 'question', 'second', 'Rambo', 'Later', 'fiancee', 'one', 'missionaries', 'take', 'Rambo', 'conflict', 'surface', 'when', 'encounter', 'boatload', 'river', 'pirates', 'everything', 'placate', 'pirates', 'when', 'then', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'John', 'Rambo', ""n't"", 'Do', 'have', 'tell', 'missionaries', 'are', 'captured', 'Burmese', 'military', 'orgy', 'mayhem', 'violence', 'murder', 'sadism', 'rape', 'Do', 'have', 'tell', 'movie', 'obviously', 'had', 'huge', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'film', 'dab', 'ketchup', 'shirt', 'Nope', 'Limbs', 'fly', 'heads', 'shatter', 'blood', 'flows', 'barrel', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'really', 'truly', 'bad.Another', 'missionary', 'approaches', 'John', 'Rambo', 'take', 'team', 'mercenaries', 'rescue', 'captured', 'missionaries', 'Rambo', 'Rambo', 'then', 'date', 'destiny.The', 'mercenaries', 'are', 'rag', 'tag', 'group', 'who', 'try', 'goad', 'silent', 'taciturn', 'Rambo', 'When', 'disembark', 'start', 'rescue', 'mission', 'tell', 'Rambo', 'boat', 'man', 'stay', 'boat', 'go', 'do', 'men', 'work.When', 'mercenaries', 'encounter', 'bad', 'guys', 'sure', 'glad', 'Rambo', 'tagged', 'along', 'saving', 'Rambo', 'now', 'leader.The', 'rest', 'film', 'rescue', 'race', 'safety.Lots', 'gore', 'lots', 'mayhem', 'lots', 'great', 'adrenaline', 'stimulating', 'action.This', 'classic', 'American', 'movie', 'lone', 'gunman', 'hordes', 'bad', 'guys', 'Rambo', 'smarter', 'meaner', 'million', 'zillion', 'bad', 'guys', 'joy', 'movies', ""n't"", 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'action', 'movies', 'storyline', 'paper', 'thin', 'Rambo', 'character', 'one', 'are', 'familiar', 'comfortable', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rambo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rambo', 'now', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'cartoons.None', 'matters', 'What', 'basic', 'ethos', 'good', 'guy', 'impossible', 'odds', 'good', 'guy', 'wins', 'benefit', 'foreign', 'markets', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'financial', 'success', 'American', 'films', ""n't"", 'flag', 'waving', 'lot', 'action', 'lot', 'violence', 'great', 'special', 'effects.In', 'short', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'who', 'like', 'kind', 'film', 'Others', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'stay', 'away.Jerry']",N/A

1151091,AB0MFQPQLB8DF,B0015XHP22,J. Mardis,"[0, 0]","Initially I had no intentions of seeing this fourth installment of the RAMBO franchise. Why? Because while I really liked FIRST BLOOD, my memories of RAMBO II and III were of a more campy, 80s-type mindless action film generally made to exploit such traits. Those films, while enjoyable, where not made to be taken with 100% realism - but more rather as ""movie-escapism"". They were fun, popcorn movies. RAMBO is not that kind of film. In my opinion, this is the BEST film of the franchise (and if not the BEST, it's at least on par with FIRST BLOOD). Does this film have blood and guts and lots of explosions? Yes. But that's not why I watch these films. I'm not a ""blood and guts"" kind of guy. If it's thrown in ""just to show it"", or to get a quick thrill from the teenyboppers, for me it's pointless and a waste of film. But I don't think that that's why this film is so violent. The ""blood and guts"" of this film has purpose: (1) to show the harsh-reality brutalism of real-world, mindless, evil; and (2) to show the lengths at which one tortured man (John Rambo) is willing to push himself in order to put somewhat of a stop to such ""real-world"" evil. Many of the violent scenes are hard to watch (innocent people being killed), but they're there for a reason.Stallone's acting and direction are excellent. As are the supporting actors. As usual, the John Rambo character is quite and subdued.

While ""First Blood"" will always go down as a classic for me, the other two Rambo films (far more commercial and the badly executed rambo III) are entertaining.However, this fourth and final installment of the roaming life of Viet Nam Vet John Rambo closes with a bang and I believe that Burma is still recovering from this one. You have to hand it to Stallone for carefully choosing the catalyst for the fourth Rambo film (the ongoing 60 year civil/genocidal war of Burma).The other aspect of this film is how underestimated Stallone is not only as an actor, but really as a director. Perhaps he may follow into the foot steps of Clint Eastwood and really take on a path as a director? His last two films were so good (particularly Rockt Balboa) one can only guess what his capabilities are in the future?For those of you who haven't seen Rambo yet, BE FORWARNED. Rambo does not have the cartoony action in it you might identify with as seen in the second and third films. Rambo is ""in your face up close and personal"" graphic blood and guts with non stop gore through about half the film. Just think about the first 20 minutes or so of Private Ryan but its about 40 strait minutes of killing (allot with the 50 cal).So our plot synopsis is Rambo living his days out in Thailand as a boatman doing whatever he can to survive and leaving his life of war behind him. One day missionaries (nobel,yet misguided) contact him for a trip up the river into Burma, which he then reluctantly agrees to. The missionaries disappear, and Rambo is once again brought back into war and coming to terms of ""what he is"", a finely honed killing machine. With a small group of mercenaries, they plan a rescue extraction of the remaining missionaries being held captive. One their way out, they run into trouble with the Burmese army right on top of them....let the killing and non stop carnage begin.""Live for nothing, or die for something"" is the phrase that Rambo utters and is really the message delivered in this film despite the blood and carnage. There's nothing satisfying about war and that is another aspect of Rambo that I belive is missed as well which has been otherwise glorified by some the war films of the early and mid 1980's.Look at what the exposure of violence and a life of war/killing has done to an otherwise regular guy like Rambo.He could be someone who could easily be your next door neighbor?Make no mistake, war runins people on all sides whether for good or bad reasons and that has been horribly overlooked from some of the reviews I have read here so far.Well worth owning and watching...even better on Blue Ray and on a big flat screen TV. Read between the lines of Rambo, just don't focus all attention on the obvious(although it is difficult not to dwell on it).Stallone delivers on Rambo and it ends with a big bang as opposed to other failed franchises ending with a pathetic sputter.",4,"""Are you bringing any weapons?You're not changing anything.""",1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,3028,"['Stallone', 'mission', 'bring', 'end', 'iconic', 'characters', 'films', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'epic', 'finally', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'will', 'always', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'other', 'two', 'Rambo', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'commercial', 'badly', 'executed', 'rambo', 'III', 'are', 'entertaining.However', 'fourth', 'final', 'installment', 'roaming', 'life', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'Vet', 'John', 'Rambo', 'bang', 'believe', 'Burma', 'still', 'recovering', 'one', 'have', 'hand', 'Stallone', 'carefully', 'choosing', 'catalyst', 'fourth', 'Rambo', 'film', 'ongoing', '60', 'year', 'civil/genocidal', 'war', 'Burma', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'underestimated', 'Stallone', 'not', 'only', 'actor', 'really', 'director', 'Perhaps', 'may', 'follow', 'foot', 'steps', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'really', 'take', 'path', 'director', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'particularly', 'Rockt', 'Balboa', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'what', 'capabilities', 'are', 'future', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Rambo', 'yet', 'BE', 'FORWARNED', 'Rambo', 'not', 'have', 'cartoony', 'action', 'might', 'identify', 'as', 'seen', 'second', 'third', 'films', 'Rambo', 'face', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'graphic', 'blood', 'guts', 'non', 'stop', 'gore', 'film', 'Just', 'think', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'Private', 'Ryan', '40', 'strait', 'minutes', 'killing', 'allot', '50', 'cal', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'Rambo', 'living', 'days', 'out', 'Thailand', 'boatman', 'doing', 'can', 'survive', 'leaving', 'life', 'war', 'One', 'day', 'missionaries', 'nobel', 'yet', 'misguided', 'contact', 'trip', 'river', 'Burma', 'then', 'reluctantly', 'missionaries', 'disappear', 'Rambo', 'once', 'again', 'brought', 'back', 'war', 'coming', 'terms', 'what', 'finely', 'honed', 'killing', 'machine', 'small', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'plan', 'rescue', 'extraction', 'remaining', 'missionaries', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'One', 'way', 'run', 'trouble', 'Burmese', 'army', 'right', 'top', '.let', 'killing', 'non', 'stop', 'carnage', 'begin', 'Live', 'nothing', 'die', 'something', 'phrase', 'Rambo', 'utters', 'really', 'message', 'delivered', 'film', 'blood', 'carnage', 'nothing', 'satisfying', 'war', 'aspect', 'Rambo', 'belive', 'missed', 'well', 'been', 'otherwise', 'glorified', 'war', 'films', 'early', 'mid', ""1980's.Look"", 'what', 'exposure', 'violence', 'life', 'war/killing', 'done', 'otherwise', 'regular', 'guy', 'Rambo.He', 'could', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Make', 'mistake', 'war', 'runins', 'people', 'sides', 'good', 'bad', 'reasons', 'been', 'horribly', 'overlooked', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'here', 'so', 'far.Well', 'owning', 'watching', 'even', 'better', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'big', 'flat', 'screen', 'TV', 'Read', 'lines', 'Rambo', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'attention', 'obvious', 'difficult', 'not', 'dwell', 'delivers', 'Rambo', 'big', 'bang', 'opposed', 'other', 'failed', 'franchises', 'ending', 'pathetic', 'sputter']",N/A

I used to eat up action films like candy when I was younger and I still have a soft spot in my heart for them -- especially rah-rah, kill-everyone, blow-everything-up, monosyllabic-superhuman-ability-hero ones like ""Rambo.""As an action film, ""Rambo"" absolutely rocks.  But as a serious film?  It's pretty awful.  Stallone, who co-wrote and directed, wants to make a grand pro-aggression political statement -- complete with the bleeding-heart liberal who must come to terms with the ""true nature"" of violence -- but that falls incredibly flat.  Stallone has a tin ear for dialogue, and his exchanges with ""Dexter's"" Julie Benz are unintentionally hilarious.The plot is simple: a group of human-rights missionaries show up in Burma hoping to get medicine and care to villagers wounded in the ongoing civil war; they enlist Rambo to get them there and then are, inevitably, taken hostage.  Rambo, with the aid of a few mercenaries, goes back to kick butt and a lot of stuff blows up.Stallone makes Rambo a bitter, faithless man, and in one odd moment has him reveal that he's nothing but a bloodthirsty killer.  I find this to be a contradiction to this film and the previous ones.While Stallone can't seem to help himself and makes this movie very melodramatic (he's a total butcher as a director working with other actors; he leaves Benz and Paul Schulze out to dry), I have to admit his extended action scenes -- filled with impossibly violent blood and gore -- got my adrenaline pumping.  There's nothing like the sugar rush of extreme violence.  It's the most fleeting of thrills, but you cannot deny its charge.  As far as cheap thrills go, it's not bad.Stallone, looking cartoonish with his Play-Doh face and grossly bloated body, never changes expression throughout the movie.  Whatever this character once was is gone; he is now stripped of all traces of humanity.For me, ultimately, ""Rambo"" is nothing more than disposable, quick-hit entertainment.  Stallone didn't think so, obviously, and its major flaw is that at times it looks like he thinks he's making ""Platoon.""""Rambo"" is worth a look if you like bloody action movies and enjoy a good adrenal jolt.",3,"If Rocky can end the Cold War, why can't Rambo stop genocide?",1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,2224,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'lot', 'Rambo', 'going', 'used', 'eat', 'up', 'action', 'films', 'candy', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'still', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'especially', 'rah-rah', 'kill-everyone', 'blow-everything-up', 'monosyllabic-superhuman-ability-hero', 'ones', 'Rambo', 'action', 'film', 'Rambo', 'absolutely', 'serious', 'film', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Stallone', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'make', 'grand', 'pro-aggression', 'political', 'statement', 'complete', 'bleeding-heart', 'liberal', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'true', 'nature', 'violence', 'incredibly', 'flat', 'Stallone', 'tin', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'Dexter', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'group', 'human-rights', 'missionaries', 'show', 'up', 'Burma', 'hoping', 'get', 'medicine', 'care', 'villagers', 'wounded', 'ongoing', 'civil', 'war', 'enlist', 'Rambo', 'get', 'there', 'then', 'are', 'inevitably', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Rambo', 'aid', 'few', 'mercenaries', 'back', 'kick', 'butt', 'lot', 'stuff', 'blows', 'up.Stallone', 'Rambo', 'bitter', 'faithless', 'man', 'one', 'odd', 'moment', 'reveal', 'nothing', 'bloodthirsty', 'killer', 'find', 'be', 'contradiction', 'film', 'previous', 'ones.While', 'Stallone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help', 'movie', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'total', 'butcher', 'director', 'working', 'other', 'actors', 'Benz', 'Paul', 'Schulze', 'dry', 'have', 'admit', 'extended', 'action', 'scenes', 'filled', 'impossibly', 'violent', 'blood', 'gore', 'got', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'nothing', 'sugar', 'rush', 'extreme', 'violence', 'most', 'fleeting', 'thrills', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'charge', 'As', 'far', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'go', 'not', 'bad.Stallone', 'looking', 'cartoonish', 'Play-Doh', 'face', 'grossly', 'bloated', 'body', 'never', 'expression', 'movie', 'character', 'once', 'was', 'gone', 'now', 'stripped', 'traces', 'humanity.For', 'ultimately', 'Rambo', 'nothing', 'more', 'disposable', 'quick-hit', 'entertainment', 'Stallone', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'obviously', 'major', 'flaw', 'times', 'making', 'Platoon', 'Rambo', 'look', 'like', 'bloody', 'action', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'good', 'adrenal', 'jolt']",N/A

1151104,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B0015XHP22,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]",I'm going to review Rambo IV which I think is a really solid sequel that's the that comes pretty close to 1st Blood. It stars Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo & Julie Benz as Sarah the story is short & sweet Rambo takes these relief workers over to Burma but they were captured by the Burmaneese army. Stallone of course directed this & all as I have to say is that he really knows his audience & knows how to get the audience to hate the villain. So this precher or something tells Rambo that these people have been captured so Rambo teams up with some Merc's & they kind of remind me of the guys from the 1st Predator movie they were entertaining. I thought that Julie Benz was a decent lead girl & this was by far my favorite perfomance of Sylvester Stallone as the Rambo chracter. He kills a bunch of mother f*****s there's a video on youtube that has Stallone's kill count. Brian Tyler did a good job with the score. It used very little CGI as well it had a decent story that really drove the action. Of course Stallone did a good job with the directing which he has directed a lot of his own movies in the past I really think he understands his audience more than Jean Claude Van Dammme. So I'am looking forward to the Expendables this summer also directed by Stalllone if you love old school 80's action movies then you'll more than likely like Rambo IV. Now I'm going to talk about The Extended Edition It has all the deleted scenes added back in with some alternate takes. There are more scenes with Rambo & Sarah. The opening is John Rambo. During the opening 2 guys on the boat are playing with the cobra. Also added back in while Rambo is working in the hut Sarah asks him to take them to Burma again. Added dialog at the night scene where it's raining Sarah asks him to take them again. When Rambo is taking the Rrlief Workers up river there is a longer conversation with Rambo & Sarah we learn Sarah is a 6th grade school teacher & her & Michael are engaged. Also after Rambo kills the pirates different dialog is spoken Michael tells Sarah will come back next year. More lines are added when Sarah begs him not too. The part where Rambo sets the boat on fire there are flashbacks to what happend earlier. Added scene where Rambo is thinking about what Sarah said about going back to The States.

The release date just happens to coincide with world revulsion at the way the Burmese authorities are handling a disaster of catastrophic proportions when a majority of countries are falling over themselves to provide humanitarian assistance.One finds oneself asking why good thinking men and true allow reigimes such as the Burmese to rule their subjects this way. Why does the democratic world allow such goings on? Should missionaries be allowed to interfere in other countries affairs? Should mercenaries be allowed to infiltrate and murder? Is there such a thing as god etc, etc.This film may not provide the answers, as they do for the subdued performance of Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, but it will provoke a lot of questions for the viewer. Killing Fields it may not be, but it is a hankering back to kinder, gentler times in America and by implication when America took a different role in world affairs than it currently does.Rambo works on several levels and is surprisingly better than expected.

1151106,A1MF862XU2WI2W,B0015XHP22,Just a guy in Oregon,"[2, 3]","Well, usually I read the prior reviews before writing one but not this time.  Unbiased is best no?  I was struck by the obvious that this movie is Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" .  It is NOT for children unless, perhaps, you want your children to understand the nature of the world and human nature early.  It's brutal and, I think , accurate in its portrayal of the lowest form of human life-the genocidist.  Evil personified is the unredeemable government general whose men kill, rape, torture, toy with, terrorize, and mutilate humans of all ages for no reason other than stark ethnic hate.Oh, these people certainly exist in the world.  Some suggest that we just need to unilaterally sit down and talk with 'em.  Surely, talking it out over a nice campfire with marshmallows and hot chocolate can make all the evil go away.  Eh?  I guess in the unlikely event anyone of a liberal political/social persuasion were to see this movie they'd say that the evil was exaggerated.  Surely nobody could be that bad.  Surely the movie exaggerates just to make the reaction of our hero Rambo seem justified?  Eh?Oh, but some of us know such ultimate evil exists.  And some of us have realized this from our childhood.  ( Mine, as at the age of ten I read accounts of the holocaust complete with photos of the pits and ovens. )The only way to deal with such a level of evil is to eradicate it.  You will get your monies worth if you want to see Mr. John do this.The movie is a bit stereotyped.  I personally cannot fathom that do good liberals are really as bone head stupid as the crew of white Christian medical personnel intent on going into the heart of darkness to minister to the unsaved unwashed poor of Burma's hinterland.  But, the exaggeration of those characters is to a good effect for when, after the ultimate battle of good and evil, some of them ""get it"" the distance they have traveled is much greater than had they been even slightly aware of their stupidity up front.Rambo is underplayed in this one at first.  He's a quiet sort who likes his simple craft in the third world tending a blacksmith shop with electricity from somewhere or other.Soon enough Mr. Rambo's unique skill set come to the fore and we all, or at least some of us, start to cheer.I'd have to say this is the best Rambo movie and I envy Sly for being able to put himself into the role of champion over the obvious evil that rules Burma today.  ( Or did you miss the storm coverage? )The major battle sequences are very realistic I would think.  Not having been in combat I have to say "" I think"".  Action is very fast.  Isn't that the way it is?  Action is very gory, brutal, and impersonnal especially as John chews up and spits out the evil opposition with a big 50-in one case getting two with one shot.  ( and accurately, as we see the victims from the back as they are hit from the front 5+ inch holes open up - I suppose that's what a 50 would do to a man ).I must stress that this movie is NOT for the gentle people.  It's very gory and the problem is that it's not, IMO, gratuitous violence and gore.  It's necessary to the story to really see what the hateful genocidists do to innocent defenseless people.  And it's also necessary to see and experience what such people deserve in response.This movie plays on both my ( obvious ) conservative and liberal ( yes ) sides.  I like to see evil get what's due it and I don't doubt the existence of this level of evil many places in the world.  However, I wish also that I could forget what I know and believe and live in the fairy tale world of the ultra left  winger who thinks evil resides in this country and the west and not where it really lives.If you like Rambo movies this one is a home run.  It's the best.  Rambo is a mature man in this story.  He knows what he is and borrows some lines from my favorite TV series of all time, Millenium,  ""this is who we are and this is what we do "" to paraphrase.  He loves war and killing and admits it.  We are glad and fortunate he's on our side though the other side has his sort as well.He has full self knowledge in this movie.  He understands that it was OK for him to kill several hundred people with arrows, rifles, handguns, machine guns and probably a few just by looking at them.  They had it coming or J.R. would not have put them on his hit list.  As in the first Rambo John didn't start this one but he sure as heck finished it.The libs who made it home alive from this escapade probably feel like the proverbial conservative who was once a liberal , that is, until they were mugged.Thanks, Sly, you tied the whole Rambo saga together very nicely.  You are lucky to have the popular podium from which to at least attempt to wake us up to what is really waiting for us out there in the world.There are darn few people of ""note"" in this world I'd even walk across the street to shake hands with.  You are one of them since I take you and your work seriously.  So here's a handshake for you and a thank you.

1151107,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0015XHP22,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 5]","Twenty years after his last foray on the big screen in ""Rambo 3"", writer/director/actor Sylvester Stallone has resurrected one of America's greatest action heroes once more. After successfully reviving his `Rocky' franchise with the most recent, and supposed final chapter, ""Rocky Balboa"", Stallone indicated that he felt he should give fans another hefty dose of mayhem in the form of John Rambo, largely due to feeling like he had left fans a little disappointed by the events of the third film (though I still enjoyed it). Displaying that he is more than just an over-the-hill action star, Sylvester Stallone wrote the story for the newest installment in the `Rambo' franchise, simply titled ""Rambo"", along with directing and starring in the film, and take it from me he delivers on all counts with this film.""Rambo"" picks up approximately 20 years after the events in ""Rambo 3"", as John Rambo is living out his life operating a longboat along the Salween River in Northern Thailand. However, Rambo's quiet existence has just been interrupted when a Christian missionary group arrives, seeking Rambo's help in crossing the border into war-ravaged Burma. Reluctantly, Rambo agrees to assist the missionaries with the understanding that he would merely be dropping them off into the country and nothing more, but when the group is captured by the ruthless Nationalist Army that controls the area, John Rambo must once more wreak havoc on those that would attack the innocent, and attempt to rescue the prisoners, no matter the cost.For me, ""Rambo"" is a welcome return from Hollywood exile for an iconic action hero that knows how to get the job done and get it done right. His return, though much more violent than the previous three films, was extremely triumphant in my eyes. Many critics, not surprisingly, felt the movie was brainless, featuring overly simplistic villains, average to below average acting, and so much gratuitous violence that it would possibly make Quentin Tarentino (director of the extremely violent `Kill Bill' movies) turn away. I don't know why the critics hated this movie so much, I felt that this movie was just as good, if not better, than the first and second films, and definitely better than the third film which was good but not as great as its predecessors.The acting was solid, and was exactly what I expected from a movie such as this, it's not like anyone went into the movie looking to hand out Oscars to the cast or anything like that, and to me, Sylvester Stallone (""Rocky Balboa"") handled Rambo perfectly. From his steely gaze, world weary outlook, and his no-fuss, never quit attitude, Stallone delivered to audiences a performance that was realistic for that character, making him seem more in line with the all-business attitude the character had in the first two films, yet seemed to have less of with the one-liner spewing persona in ""Rambo 3"". The supporting cast that comprised the team of mercenaries assisting Rambo on his mission were essentially character actors that I'd seen before, though I couldn't really place them in anything specific; regardless, each actor played their individual characters with a ruthlessness and thirst for money and violence that fit perfectly with their characters' lot in life. The missionaries that Rambo assists are led by a man named Michael, played by Paul Schulze (TV's ""The Sopranos""), who comes off as a weak man who can't see the harsh reality in front of him until it's too late, and he seemed to possess a rather off-putting holier-than-thou mentality that is doesn't fit in with the self-less work of a missionary. Portraying the other main member of the missionary group is actress Julie Benz (""The Punisher: War Zone"") who portrays her character of Sarah as a woman whose warmth can melt even the coldest heart, and her compassion for others is a true testament to her faith in humanity and God above, a true representation of the missionary spirit.The story for ""Rambo"" was a well-conceived, hard-hitting, and extremely fast-paced return for the title character, and Stallone along with co-writer Art Monterastelli (""The Hunted"") easily silence all the nay-sayers that said another `Rambo' movie would never work for today's audiences. The characters are well-written and in some cases are given a surprising amount of depth for an action movie. Now, I'll admit that some of the characters are not as developed as others; but then again, this is an action movie, not some heavy dramatic Oscar contender, so what do you expect? As far as the excessive action of the story is concerned, I don't feel that it was any more gratuitous or over-the-top than any other action movie these days, and to me, I thought that the action was very realistic and necessary given the circumstances of the movie. Plus, I'm sure if someone was to go back and look at past reviews of those critics that ripped ""Rambo"" for being overly violent, you would find that these very same critics most likely praised the excessive, extremely bloody, and senseless violence of the two `Kill Bill' films, so I wouldn't take their comments in that regard too seriously.""Rambo"" is a superbly triumphant return for America's jaded action hero, John Rambo. Full of enough action to keep even the most ardent of action junkies satisfied, along with surprisingly well-written characters and dialogue for an action movie, and not to mention the film was also able to shed some light on the disturbing reality that exists over in Burma or Myanmar, or whatever it's actually called. Overall, ""Rambo"" delivers audiences a pulse-pounding sequel that easily lives up to the excitement and adventure of its predecessors and possibly surpasses them all in the end.""Rambo"" is rated R

Caught it on U-Verse and seemed pretty good. Then the ""Extended Cut"" BD came out and the reviews were ""Highly Recommended"". Belonging to a BD/DVD forum I inquired and checked why such a highly recommendation? So I grabbed it during the holiday sales thinking ok, another war hero effort.WOW...was this a surprise. The transfer and PQ was top notch. It was Rambo meets National Geographic. Colors of the green jungle and foilage were sharp and even. And night time shots were dark yet visable. Everything was natural yet clearly came to life.But the soundtrack thanks to the DTS really made this BD shine. From the sounds in the woods to the rain coming down you felt you were there. Of course with Rambo expect lots of action and this didn't disappoint. I could go on and on about several instances from the highpower sniper to Rsmbo using his bow but no doubt the last 15 minutes really shakes the house.

I was expecting one of those ""Jaws #8"" type movies where the actors just did it for the money....Well, I was EXTREMELY surprised from the minute I tossed in this disc.Stallone has done many great things in his career, but, I must admit, I thought this movie was absolutely phenomenal. The acting from Stallone in this movie just blew me away. Stallone has shown some real passion in this film.....despite the gore, blood & violence...(which I like! By the way!!!)...The acting was great.I know, I know....you're saying ""It's an action movie, the acting is supposed to stink in those movies!"" ....Well....This film is very different....There is NO action-movie ""cheese factor""...This is NOT your ""typical"" action movie.In this film, ""John Rambo"" (living in Thailand) is asked to bring a group of American Missionaries up-river, to Burma to bring medicine, medical aid, comfort...etc. all in the middle of a war zone. The missionaries are captured, and I'll just leave it at that...not wanting to give anything away.Mentally, ""Rambo"" has finally come full circle. Realizing, or ""coming to terms"" with the fact that he is what he is...""An instrument of war."" And doing his part to rescue the missionaries, despite internal conflicts that he has been dealing with in the previous Rambo films. I have to give credit to Stallone, because this was a first rate performance, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film.For the sake of the children, I will say that this film is EXTREMELY bloody! Even downright ""disturbing"" at times. On the ""Blood-O-Meter"", I'd say that it's right up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"".....Maybe even a bit bloodier! After all, it's a ""war movie"" (so, keep that in mind). It's safe to say that this film will NOT be suitable for many viewers.Despite it's violence, blood, gore, and disturbing content, Sylvester Stallone has really done a superb job with this film.

With RAMBO and last year's triumphant ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone has reclaimed the respect and admiration accorded him early in his career, when his performance as a down-on-his-luck prize fighter from Philadelphia inspired comparisons to Brando and his attendant screenplay was praised for its gritty realism and fragile romanticism. There is plenty of the former and precious little of the latter in the brutal landscape Stallone has committed to celluloid with RAMBO, but that's as it should be; this isn't a live-action cartoon -- it's a nasty, grim, and uncompromising portrait of the savagery of war.Unfortunately, what all this means is that while RAMBO represents a new peak for the series, the sheer volume and disturbing realism of the carnage onscreen is wearing and anyone expecting the bombastic ""fun"" of previous installments is missing the point. Even with a relatively compact running time of just over ninety minutes, the relentless fatalism espoused by the haunted Vietnam vet makes RAMBO seem like a much longer movie. That's not a criticism -- if anything, it's a reflection of just how thoroughly Stallone has come to inhabit this character, for we feel the weight of Rambo's world-weariness in each and every frame.On a final note, kudos to Stallone for resisting the temptation to ""water down"" his vision of RAMBO to secure a PG rating; John Rambo and Sylvester Stallone are back, integrity intact.",4,The Long Road Back,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,1514,"['John', 'Rambo', 'back', 'so', 'more', 'importantly', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'artist', 'filmmaker', 'RAMBO', 'last', 'year', 'triumphant', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'Stallone', 'reclaimed', 'respect', 'admiration', 'accorded', 'early', 'career', 'when', 'performance', 'down-on-his-luck', 'prize', 'fighter', 'Philadelphia', 'inspired', 'comparisons', 'Brando', 'attendant', 'screenplay', 'was', 'praised', 'gritty', 'realism', 'fragile', 'romanticism', 'plenty', 'former', 'precious', 'little', 'latter', 'brutal', 'landscape', 'Stallone', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'RAMBO', 'should', 'be', ""n't"", 'live-action', 'cartoon', 'nasty', 'grim', 'uncompromising', 'portrait', 'savagery', 'war.Unfortunately', 'what', 'RAMBO', 'new', 'peak', 'series', 'sheer', 'volume', 'disturbing', 'realism', 'carnage', 'onscreen', 'wearing', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'bombastic', 'fun', 'previous', 'installments', 'missing', 'point', 'Even', 'relatively', 'compact', 'running', 'time', 'just', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'relentless', 'fatalism', 'espoused', 'haunted', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'RAMBO', 'seem', 'much', 'longer', 'movie', 'not', 'criticism', 'anything', 'reflection', 'just', 'how', 'thoroughly', 'Stallone', 'come', 'inhabit', 'character', 'feel', 'weight', 'Rambo', 'world-weariness', 'frame.On', 'final', 'note', 'kudos', 'Stallone', 'resisting', 'temptation', 'water', 'down', 'vision', 'RAMBO', 'secure', 'PG', 'rating', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'are', 'back', 'integrity', 'intact']",N/A

Stallone actually uses his brainpan to have Rambo actually age gracefully, but still does the smart thing and aligns his Rambo with a group of mercenaries to help him out, instead of doing the past 'do everything yourself' action flick. Intelligent move.This is most definately the best Stallone acted and directed movie -ever! And his last Rocky movie was well done and well acted, but lacked somewhat of the explosive stuff that the first 4 had. But it still managed to grip your heart.Rambo rocks, and we really hope that Stallone keeps showcasing his still intact acting and directing acumen. Now that Stallone has finally returned in full force, with both a Rocky and Rambo one-two success, the word is that some smart producers gave Stallone the greenlight to create more Rambo action/adventure films.Can't wait to see this. Rocky ended with a solid movie. Stallone will hopefully end it on a good note, but continue John Rambo's adventures.

In RAMBO, Sylvester Stallone continues in the fourth go round as the emotionally wounded Vietnam vet who tours the world's hot spots encountering gore as he goes. In the first two of the series, the ""hidden"" or sublimated Rambo self shows itself often enough to engage the viewer on multiple levels. By the time Stallone hits this latest reincarnation of a killing machine, he has very nearly dropped all pretense as to motivation. There are one or two disjointed flashbacks that hint at the supressed turmoil but such scenes are thrown in merely to give a brief respite from the ubiquitous bloodletting. The deepest that Stallone allows Rambo to emote is when his inner voice acknowledges that he is indeed a killing machine, which in this film is the plot around which the external events of a rescue of missionaries are but a periphery. These missionaries are total humanists, pacifists, and generally stand for everything that Rambo despises. Even when he saves them from a scurvy bunch of Burmese river pirates by killing the brigands with a pistol, they reward his actions by suggesting that he did not have to do that at all.  Stallone's grimace at this point was his emotional highlight.  The bulk of the movie is to set up the Burmese pirate army as the slimiest horde of impotent sadists I have ever seen.  They enter a peaceful village to loot, rape, and kill.  They even kill for sport, betting on the outcome as to how long it will take to kill helpless villagers. The camera spends several minutes merely focusing on a drunken orgy in which the pirates are pictured as beasts who fully deserve their upcoming fate.  The last half shows Rambo dispensing his own brand of frontier justice. He uses his bow and arrow from RAMBO II to skewer a half dozen.  He takes his finely honed Bowie knife to disembowel their leader. He uses a captured machine gun to blow away scores of thugs in gory closeups of exploding body parts in a manner that seems borrowed from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. At sixty, Stallone yet possesses a cut and ripped physique that well matches his grainy etched face. We do not doubt for a moment his ability to do exactly what we see him do.  The only moments in which we suspend our disbelief are the rare moments when he acts as a normal human being.  But the other 99% of this RAMBO movie leaves him to do what we expect.

If your not into Rambo/war action flicks, then this isn't for you at all. The film doesn't give you much to go on as far as establishing who Rambo is if your new to this. You HAVE to know who Rambo is and his career history of being a one man army that takes down hordes of enemy soldiers. Just for the fact Stallone did one more Rambo flick for the hell of it I salute him. I think all us Rambo/Stallone fans appreciated that. Now the movie itself... that's a different story.This Rambo movie just didn't feel like rambo to me. He wasn't really the 1 man army that survives it all in this one. There was no scene where he picks up the M60 and starts firing it one handed, No exploding arrows, no grenade throwing, and not many of those Rambo sneaking up on you scenes. It felt like Rambo was just there for the ride. Alot of the action scenes weren't focused on him accept for a few big ones. The latest addition just doesn't seem to capture that 1 man against it all feel all the other Rambo flicks had. Now the action was good with lots and lots and lots of gore effects. Kind of reminded me of saving private ryans with the way the footage was captured. I don't know why, but even for a Rambo flick the ""killer of killers"" I think they kind of over did it on the gore stuff. Yeah Rambo is violent, but the classic Rambo's got that point across without people showing being ripped to shreds and blood pouring everwhere. It was almost like Horror/Action just didn't seem in Rambolikeness for me.The plot was focused around Rambo saving a group of peace lovers. One of these happens to be a woman that I'm not sure if she was intended to be his love interest of not. She wasn't very attractive, and seemed a bit too naive compared to Rambo's other girls (You remember the one that shot up the entire camp just to rescue him?).The plot was so so. It barely gave you what you came to see. Which was Rambo fighting an entire army single handedly. It's like all these other characters are in the way.

1151137,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0015XHP22,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 5]","Let me set the scene: you've just walked out a cinema screen, in a mad crush of people, who were all desperate to see the new Rambo movie. You're waiting around, and the door to the guys toilets open. Out stumbles out four or five die hard Rambo fans, wearing black vests, and red strips around their heads.What?I know. Guys actually dressed up as Rambo in the UK screening of the movie, on the first day of its release. AND people started cheering at the end of the movie. Why, I have absolutely no idea. Whoever started it (cos when one person starts clapping, everyone else has to follow), should have been faced with an angry Rambo himself.But back to the movie. I've seen the previous three Rambo movies, and while they were all good, there was lots of violence, bad guys, and turn-away-from-the-screen moments. And Sly wearing next to nothing. Particularly in the third one.What was initially disappointing for me about this movie, was he does not remove his top once. It barely gets ripped, never mind ripped so much he's best off not wearing it. But then the guy is in his sixties, and while he still has the tremendously broad shoulders, he's not as trim as he once was, and the black T-shirt was trying to cover up a noticable paunch. Another reason might have been he got a tattoo of his wife's/partner's face on his upper arm, but I'm not sure whether that was during filming or not, but it would have been cause not to lose the top.For a sixty-something guy, he's looking pretty damn good isn't he? The face is a little worn and tired, and he's showing his age there mostly, but otherwise, I bet there's a lot youunger men who would love to look like this.Following on from the last Rocky film, Sly decided to revisit (and direct) another of his most famous movies. Once again, it's about the war, in Burma this time, and he's trying to live the quiet life once more. Collecting snakes for some weird reason, he's approached by a group of missionaries who want to get into Burma, and 'hire' him and his boat. The group are mostly a bunch of unknown actors, unless any Coronation Street fans recognise Matthew Marsden (hubba hubba), who had an affair with Sally Webster many years ago. Julie Benz seems familiar, but can't quite place her, and she looks so much better as a brunette! You've got the hard man and the others are not really worth talking about.Rambo agrees to take them up the river (at his own pace of course), after a bat of Sarah's (Julie Benz) eyelashes. He's even more smitten when she gives him a crucifix. When they get there, he turns back and goes back down the river.I'm not going to reveal anymore, cos you really have to go and watch. But it is the most violent of all the Rambo movies yet, and some imaginative deaths - I'll never hear someone 'joke' about someone's throat being ripped out again, cos it actually happens. I didn't think it was possible. There's obvious decapitation, holes being shot into bodies, torture, rape, everything you can possibly think of and then some more.Was it right of Sly to bring back Rambo, for (hopefully) one last outing? Yes it was in my opinion. The cinema was packed, and it's already being raved about by people I've spoken to. Sly still looks reasonably good for his age, and the final scene, was just what was needed to wrap up the franchise. It was just the right ending, and it worked perfectly in terms of the character. Believe me, you will shed a little tear. Or cheer. Whatever.Rambo is a must-see. Whether you were a fan of the originals, or if you had a crush on Sly and didn't want to admit it (hmmmmmmmmmmmm), you need to see it, and if you can, see it at the cinema. Wow. It's definitely one for my DVD collection when it comes out, and one for the HD lovers out there.

1151143,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B0015XHP22,Mike Zimmerman,"[6, 9]","Trying to dodge painful memories of his past, Vietnam vet John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is making a life in Thailand where he spends his time salvaging old PT boats and tanks for scrap metal. But his R&R; has been interrupted as Christain missionaries Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) and Sarah Miller (Julie Benz) request he take them to Burma. Little do the missionaries know that it's one of the biggest mistakes they could ever make, as Burmese military men kidnap them for sick and twisted pleasures. Now Rambo has to snap out of his funk and rescue his friends before they are killed.The new decade has seen re-emergence of familiar movie franchises making a return: Arnold Schwartzeneggar's ""Terminator"", Bruce Willis's ""Live Free or Die Hard"", and Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky Balboa""... and the latest in ""Rambo"". A franchise that probably shouldn't have bared its presence since the third film, which I heard was monumentally terrible, its newest installment, simply titled ""Rambo"", makes a surprsingly entertaining 93 minute sit. Just as long as you don't get squeamish.Bare in mind, the film wears its R rating on its chest. Not only is the film hyperviolent (limbs are shot off and bodies explode), but it also seems to be based on real-life events, with atrocious militants putting the hurt on innocent people, whether it's rape, beheading, or child endangerment. It's sadism if handled irresponsibly (Hostel Part 2, Alien versus Predator: Requiem), but as a director, Sylvestor Stallone throws those willing into the heat of the moment. And, in the final action scene, the film really goes for the gully, yet it never loses its mojo and fist-pumping intensity that the franchise is known for.At 61, Stallone does a solid job with his performance as the wounded vet. Unlike in past efforts, and like in ""Rocky Balboa"", he's more comfortable with his acting choices and his gravitas works well for his character's trauma. Yeah, he's going to chop some people up and man a turret like no one's business (well directed here, I might add), but Stallone's more in tune with keeping the thing popping with zest and charm.I'm not to sure about the rest of the cast though. Despite showing up with a straight face, Julie Benz almost winds up showing some amateurish acting and can't seem to match the hyperactive scenes of action with her gravitas either; it ain't the point though, this is a raw action film, but her hyped performance may turn off some ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fans. The rest of the cast is fine, however, though it's hard to pick some of them out of a line-up (Matthew Marsden was somewhere), but it's a solid choice that real Vietnamese citizens were used as extras.""Rambo"" may not be the film everyone may be into (reviews aren't too pleasant), but I thought it was on the money at times. Stallone isn't a horrible actor like the likes of Steven Seagal, and his choices here won me over.

1151144,AMWAP277BFGRJ,B0015XHP22,Mitchell Cassman,"[3, 3]","As the film opens, we are provided with a thumbnail sketch of the situation in Burma, where most of the action will take place. Credit Stallone for not being topical by setting this in Iraq or some other Middle Eastern location where Rambo could battle terrorists. (Ironically, Rambo III put the character in Afghanistan battling alongside the ""freedom fighters"" who would eventually develop into terrorists.) Here, he's after the old stand-by of a corrupt army led by a sadistic colonel, whose evil and cruelty are highlighted in brutal scenes where innocent peasants are slaughtered by the dozens. Anyway, Rambo is minding his own business, grunting, catching snakes, grunting, hammering hot metal rods into weapons of mass destruction (in his hands, at least), and grunting some more. That's when Michael and Sarah enter his life. They're Christian missionaries on their way up river from Thailand to Burma and they would like Rambo to be their guide. He takes some persuading but ultimately can't resist a pretty face.  The river trip doesn't go without incident. Rambo has to wipe out a boat full of nasty pirates to keep them from raping Sarah and beheading her colleagues.  Of course, the missionaries are soon captured by the bad guys and in almost no time, Rambo is retracing his path up river with a bunch of mercenaries in tow. Following a lot of running around in the jungle we are treated to a few Rambo moments and the climax has a suitably high body count. Is there a reason to be disappointed?

I admit that when I heard Stallone was reviving Rambo (as well as Rocky), I was more than skeptical. But both films were dutifully faithful to their respective franchises and profess now that I was wrong about Stallone - he has garnered my full respect as a quality director and film maker, at least within the confines of his own beloved franchises.In the case of Rambo, Stallone pulls no punches (no pun intended.) Here we get another glimpse of John Rambo as a lost man. We also get to see him lay down untold destruction on a group of Burmese militia, lead by a very sadistic leader.This is hardly a brainy film, but who would ever expect a Rambo film to be so? What we DO expect is something dramatic and intense action and on the surface, Rambo delivers in spades. But the film's underlying beauty is its message about the true terrors of Burma and like countries. Of course this film is fictional, but Stallone did plenty of research; even the chief villain (Maung Maung Khin) is a former freedom fighter in Burma and I'm sure added his own nightmarish accounts of the realities of the situation.And let me say this now, this film is a blood bath, but not in a Hollywood sense....in a very realistic sense. When you watch this movie, remember that is happening RIGHT NOW, somewhere in the world.Not a huge fan of mindless action, nor a violence-junkie, I was surprised by how visceral and powerful this film is.

It's the story that's the problem.No wonder this movie felt so short, how can you base an entire feature film around some guy saving some other guys from a village? And that's what this is, this is totally devoid of any character development, no emotional growth, no lessons learned or anything. And don't tell me this is based on real life, that's an excuse to give this movie more substance than it has. This almost feels like some extended flashback sequence shot to be used in some hypothetical, future Rambo movie, and instead of watching the condensed down 5 minute version recounting the events of Rambo rescuing some missionaries from a village, at which point they go back to telling the main story, we're seeing the full, uncut, 90 minute version of it. That would explain the lack of emotion in this movie. It's only a glorified flashback.Thoughts:--I like the most recentRockymovie, gave it an 8/10, so I'm not biased against Stallone.--I have zero memory of the original Rambo movies, so I'm not biased against a new movie from this franchise.--I kept thinking the story would take a twist and take us in a different direction at some point. I kept thinking it couldn't possibly be this simple, there's gotta be more to this story? Nope. What happened was the equivalent of saving Zelda from Hyrule Castle inLink to the Past, and that being the end, never even going back to Dark World..--Was it just me or was this movie unusually short? I know it's listed at about 90 minutes, but I could've sworn that Rambo had looked at his mailbox with a smile and had begun strolling down that road at around the hour and sixteen minute mark?",3,this reminded me of RESERVOIR DOGS,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2040,"['were', ""n't"", 'violence', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'praise', 'movie', 'as', 'SIMPLE', 'THAT', 'do', ""n't"", 'overthink', 'know', 'true.It', 'gore', 'movie', 'was', 'gimmick', 'not', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'little', 'gore', 'thrown', 'gore', 'movie', 'tiny', 'sprinkle', 'Rambo', 'thrown', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mind', 'fact', 'what', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep', 'watching', 'story', 'problem.No', 'wonder', 'movie', 'felt', 'so', 'short', 'how', 'can', 'base', 'entire', 'feature', 'film', 'guy', 'saving', 'other', 'guys', 'village', 'what', 'totally', 'devoid', 'character', 'development', 'emotional', 'growth', 'lessons', 'learned', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'excuse', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'substance', 'almost', 'feels', 'extended', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'shot', 'be', 'used', 'hypothetical', 'future', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'instead', 'watching', 'condensed', 'down', '5', 'minute', 'version', 'recounting', 'events', 'Rambo', 'rescuing', 'missionaries', 'village', 'point', 'go', 'back', 'telling', 'main', 'story', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'full', 'uncut', '90', 'minute', 'version', 'would', 'explain', 'lack', 'emotion', 'movie', 'only', 'glorified', 'flashback.Thoughts', 'like', 'most', 'recentRockymovie', 'gave', '8/10', ""'m"", 'not', 'biased', 'Stallone.', 'have', 'zero', 'memory', 'original', 'Rambo', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'biased', 'new', 'movie', 'franchise.', 'kept', 'thinking', 'story', 'would', 'take', 'twist', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'point', 'kept', 'thinking', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'simple', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'more', 'story', 'Nope', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'equivalent', 'saving', 'Zelda', 'Hyrule', 'Castle', 'inLink', 'Past', 'being', 'end', 'never', 'even', 'going', 'back', 'Dark', 'World..', 'Was', 'just', 'was', 'movie', 'unusually', 'short', 'know', 'listed', 'about', '90', 'minutes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', 'Rambo', 'had', 'looked', 'mailbox', 'smile', 'had', 'begun', 'strolling', 'down', 'road', 'hour', 'sixteen', 'minute', 'mark']",N/A

1151162,AGKB3TS7PVF51,B0015XHP22,"Nicholas Bryant ""MovieMad""","[5, 6]","There is no doubt that Stallone was going to take huge abuse for sending out this 4th installment in the hugely successful ""Rambo"" franchise.Everyone forgets that it worked only a few months ago when 60 year old Rocky Balboa stepped into the ring for one more round (is his 6th outing) in another hugely successful franchise. But, unlike Rambo, Rocky was a far more complex, well written and hugely likeable character. The underdog: who against all odds becomes a symbol of hope and realising your dreams.Rambo was always going to be more of a bulls-eye for critics. Rightly so, it's not as superbly written nor as good as Rocky Balboa. But if good means ""a well crafted story, excellent dialogue, outstanding performances, and complex characters"" then RAMBO (like the other 3 films) was never going to be your night out anyway. In fact, even Rocky Balboa, to a certain extent, was purely another round for ""the fans"".That's exactly what Rambo is... it's for the fans. It truly plays out more like a series of Rambo's ""Greatest Hits"". With Rocky, we have the catchy ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme played out over the training montage... and with Rambo - the now more mature and updated Rambo Theme (Brian Tyler does an awesome job with Jerry Goldsmith's Theme from First Blood Part 2) whilst we are re-introduced to the troubled Vietnam Vet.Both are there stirring up all the emotions and flash-backs of why we are really watching these films. We loved watching Rocky smash his way through ring, defeating his opponents and taking home the belt... and we love watching ""Green Beret"" John. J Rambo using every conceivable weapon to exact revenge against ""the bad guys"".In First Blood it was the small town Sheriff who didn't like a soldier returning from Vietnam. Rambo taught him and his whole county sheriff's department, volunteers, et al that a ""determined one man fighting machine"" was an unstoppable force. In Rambo : First Blood Part 2 it was cutting up red-tape and government bureaucrats in order to bring home POW's still in concentration camps in Vietnam... and in Rambo 3 it was taking sides with Afghan Rebels against the Russian's invading forces.In ""John Rambo"" / ""Rambo 4"" or ""Rambo: The Fight Continues"", we find Rambo in Thailand. (Rambo has aged, as has Stallone. Still a bulky muscle bound fellow... albeit older and a little heavier). A group of Christian Missionaries find him and request help getting up river into Myanmar (Burma) to help the Karen people - who are being persecuted for their Christian Beliefs by the brutal Military led government (The film is up with current events). At first he's not interested and warns off the group from traveling into a War Zone. However, after being persuaded by the group's only woman he takes them up river. A few weeks later he gets word they've been captured by a Burmese Military Leader (who condones beatings, rape, murder, torture and burning down villages). The head of the Christian Group in the United States has contacted a group of mercenaries (led by a British SAS soldier) who will use Rambo's boat to get up river. Of course, the group brushes Rambo aside as nothing more than a ""boat man"". And this is where the story moves into over-drive and literally all hell breaks loose. Rambo's expertise is soon recognised by the 'mercs' and he leads the team to rescue the missionaries.The level of visual violence moves from truly brutal and upsetting images of live footage (actual news broadcast footage) of the violence against the Karen people into an almost stylised violence used by Rambo and the `mercs' (heads and bodies explode, heads are lopped off, limbs blown off, etc, etc). But, no matter how much retribution against the military we see, you can't help but cheer Rambo (and his huge home-made Knife/Panga) on... he is exacting revenge against Brutal Genocide. Something we all secretly wish we could do. And, that is why 90% of us go to see this type of film. He's a HERO... not a SUPERHERO, but just a man. A huge hulking mono-syllabic beast that exacts revenge against those who deserve it.It's not everyone's cup of tea, but then again those who recall the first three films, should already know that. It's for the FANS... the final farewell tour of a character that will go down in cinema history as one of the greats, alongside legends like Rocky Balboa. Die for Something... or Live for Nothing.

1151163,AGAKHE014LQFU,B0015XHP22,Nicodimus,"[0, 1]","I just watched the theatrical cut (which I've seen 5 times already) and the extended cut back-to-back. If you're concerned about the violence being toned down, it is here and there, but probably 95% of it is left untouched. This is still a very gory and brutal film depicting the horrors of war, in the same vein as Saving Private Ryan, but a bit more gruesome. The one scene that I noticed was really tame compared to the theatrical cut was the last shot in the nighttime boat scene, which is a bummer. That's always going to bug me a little. The theatrical release is 91 minutes, and this extended cut is 99 minutes. The extra 8 minutes in the extended cut are primarily spent fleshing out Rambo and the other characters just slightly more, which is nice, but ultimately I didn't think they made a huge difference. I still felt the same way about the characters in both versions, and no crucial moments, motivations or plot points changed.If you've never seen either version, then by all means get the extended cut. You won't know what you're missing in the few scenes where the violence is edited to be less intense, and it is still one of the most blood-and-guts war films out there. If you already own the theatrical version, it's very hard to recommend buying this again for the extra 8 minutes of non-essential material. You can easily youtube the extra scenes for the novelty instead of buying it again. I really dislike this tactic studios employ of releasing a film, and then a few years later, releasing a slightly improved version to make you buy almost exactly the same thing twice. The only way to stop them from doing it is to vote with your wallet and stop buying both versions. If it was an extra 20-30 minutes and/or the context and tone of the film was changed (See: Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut vs Theatrical Cut) it might merit another purchase. Here, it's only a slight difference. The super-hardcore Rambo fan may still want the extended cut, but for most viewers, it's not much of a difference and they'll enjoy both versions equally.

1151164,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B0015XHP22,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[4, 6]","To anyone laughing at a 61-year old Stallone's decision to star as John Rambo in a fourth film, Stallone himself says 'Take that'.  Rambo (just plain Rambo), not only completely gets the job done as an ultraviolent action movie, but it even has a thought or two on the world, and an eye on a real-life hellhole (Burma).Re-visiting the character who came to define 80s Reagan macho guy with guns, Stallone does not opine on the state of the world, or even philosophize on mankind.  Instead, Rambo is a man of very few words, a quiet, wounded shell living in the jungles of southeast Asia, catching poisonous snakes for a living, and basically being tortured by his past and his true nature.  When the action across the border invites a group of well-wishing missionaries, Rambo reluctantly agrees to shephard them along the river so they can deliver medicine to the terrorized Burmese peasants.  When missionaries get kidnapped by the insano Burmese military, led locally by a nameless guy with evil mirrored shades, Rambo escorts a group of mercenaries up the river on a privately funded rescue mission.What follows is nothing short of an orgy of violence, outdoing all of the previous Rambo films in its intensity and graphic nature.  Heads explode, fly off, arrows penetrate skulls, people get blown up by grenades, people get shot to pieces (literally), body parts are yanked out or off with bare hands, and when the smokes clears, yes, Rambo is still standing.  Game over.If one doubts that Stallone honestly did have something sincere to bring to the table, consider that he did film this in Burma, right before the top blew off and the real slaughter began.  Consider that he's that obsessed, that he'll depict the Burmese generals as the worst people on earth, then outdo even them as he blows heads up in the brain-soaked finale.Highly recommended for genre fans, Stallone is a quiet, brooding death machine with little hype and less to say.  This film deals violence and oppression in the world, the use of violence, and the perservering nature of the best and worst of mankind, and also the perservering nature of Stallone himself.  The world is a cold, ugly, violent place that clearly has many uses for violent men, but it also stages their necessity for the preservation of hope and good amidst machine-gunned torsos and decapitated noggins.And a note on the DVD itself: excellent job.  Of special note are the missing/deleted scenes, since none of them are missed at all.  The decision to scrap the sappy, extended, philosophical exchanges between Rambo and the main female character (who somehow is able to get through and convince him to help out) are totally unnecessary and would have (unacceptably) delayed the ultraviolence that all paid to see.  This is a trim, efficient film, and even though he claims that there is no 'Director's Cut' (since this is it), I wouldn't be surprised if someone decides to mess with a good thing and does, in fact, release a 'Director's Special Directorial Producer's Cut'.

It amounts to this; don't go to Burma. Especially if your an unarmed group of idealistic white folk from Colorado. Outside of that handy little moral, the undercurrent of this unabashed slaughter riot is how to make a film into a veritable vessel of viscera.There are zero pulled punches in this tale of a horrid civil war.

After a debate and warning them against it (especially without guns) Rambo takes them up the river into deep Burma territory and drops them off. The missionaries eventually fall victim to a very bloody genocide campaign that is one the film's most brutal sequences as even kids aren't spared from the sadistic attack. Rambo soon discovers that the missionaries have gone missing from their pastor who has arrived from America with some mercenaries to go look for them. Rambo is invited along because he was the last one to know where they went and feels a duty to get them back. The remainder of the film is a very bloody and traumatic search and rescue mission and lots of action from start to finish.If the question is ""is this a good film?"" The answer is ""absolutely not"", well not in any traditional sense that we know understand the word good, but then again do we watch Rambo as an Oscar contender? Exactly, of course we don't, so we change the question to ""Is it a good action film?"" Yes! Rambo delivers and even tries to throw in some brainwork in the mix, especially its overall political message, an interesting basic idea about trying to make a difference and appeals to the real world scenario of developing nations and the problem of genocide and child soldiers. Overall Rambo IV is squeezed in at the right place and the right time.

Sylvester Stallone's return as John Rambo is not only a good movie but a movie that has become a rallying cry to a group of actually fighting tyrany.We find our hero settled in Thailand, working with and catching snakes.  He is approached by a group from a church wanting to bring in a group of doctors into Burma.  Rambo declines warning them of the danger but the persistence of Sarah (Julie Benz) of religious convinces them to go.  A dangerous run-in fails to deter them and Rambo leaves them in a village where they start tending to the people's needs.To nobody's surprise a short time later the leader of the parish approaches him.  They haven't gotten out and haven't been heard from so he hires Rambo to bring in a group a mercs to the spot where he dropped them.The use of these characters really makes a difference in the movie, Rambo doesn't have to carry all the load (he is the ""boat guy"") and the interplay between the various guys really works well.  There is not a bad performance in the lot.The special features concerning the making of the movie really adds value, particularly the story of the actual repression in Burma.  The chief villain of the picture is an actual refugee from the war which is as bad as the picture describes it.  The only objection I have to the entire disk are the deleted scenes.

The film ties up all the loose ends in the previous outings and ends in a very satisfying way. As one reviewer said, Rambo is no Private Ryan, but the film nevertheless makes a point.

Rambo films were not tremendous examples of subtle art. Life's realities arent art work either, they are explicitly horriable in many ways, and the enormously brutal nature of RAMBO 4 perfectly displays this reality. And anyone who writes it off as ""mindless"", are most definatly absent of a mind or a heart.The graphic depictions in RAMBO are so horrific, i think its the closest any film out of Hollywood has gotten to showing the truth in crimes against humanity. This movie is a wake up call....but yet isnt a public service announcment, nor is it preachy. Make no mistake, it does remember its a movie and its an entertaining one. Some of the best action ive ever seen in a film.Mix the explosivness of 80s blockbusters with the reality and heart of a 'Saving Private Ryan' brutality, but pushed to the MAXIMUM. Youve never seen anything like this before. Now lets talk about acting and plot. The acting is nothing special. Nope. But it gets the job done. Again, what are you expecting from Rambo? The fact that Stallone injects lots of heart and honesty into this film is enuff i think for its genre. Stallone acted better in pervious Rambos perhaps, but thats all. In every other catagory, as far as the sequals go, RAMBO 4 blows them all a way...leaving only the first Rambo, 'FIRST BLOOD' as the superior work in the collection.The plot is a worthy story, about a group of missionaries who wanna give a loving and peacefull message to a people that are in the middle of genocide, and in the midst of that, they get into trouble, and Rambo has to help them out of harms way. And Slyvester Stallones story has GREAT meaning becouse its about true events happening in the country of Burma that never gets any news coverage, and is the least publicised atrocity in the world. So Stallone revolved this Rambo film around it to bring attention to the utter carnage happening in Burma.It isnt executed with the most depth, but i dont expect too much from an action film. People who are sipping wine and nibbling on cheese, need not apply. And why the hell are you watching Rambo in the first place? Unless your going to leave your ultra politically correctness at the door, you might as well skip RAMBO, becouse this will prove as too big of a dose of reality for you. Now if youre strong.

John Rambo living in Thailand since the end of Rambo III has managed to survive without trouble.  But after Christian missionaries convince him to drop them off in war torn Burma so they can help the oppressed locals, things change.  The missionaries are captured and John has to get them out.  Stallone holds up well despite his age, he still manages to convey a real sense of power from the character.  He doesn't have to learn many lines, since Rambo has very little speaking parts in the movie.  The action is very violent and gory--certainly a hard R rating.  The film is very realistic in what high caliber rounds and explosives will do to a human body.  There are more limbs flying and head explosions than I have ever seen in any movie.  Though the movie is 90 minutes long, it seems shorter.  There aren't any side sub plots, there is just a little set up and tons of action.

1151191,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0015XHP22,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Rambo(released Jan.25/08)has Mr.Stallone back in his seat as his signature character of John Rambo.With his portrayal here,it doesn't seem as if more than 20 years have passed since the original movies,he is so spot on.Back is the dark,loner whose blackness from within is never too far from the surface.The film is sweeping and sometimes epic in look,and the music score is very reminiscent of the original trio of films.The story finds John living in Thailand,eking out a living,providing snakes for a small outfit that provides shows for tourists.One day a group of Americans with medical supplies and other stuffs,comes a calling.They ask John to take them up river and into Burma to a small village,which is their ultimate destination.John repeatedly refuses,until one of the group finally wears him down and he relents.Off they go in John's river boat and the first big obstacle they encounter is an encampment of Burmese river pirates along the shore.John revs his engine down and they are almost passed when suddenly one of the pirate boats is in pursuit.Their boat is just too modern and powerful,so John is forced to stop.John tries negotiating with them but when they realize there is a woman on board things go south very quickly.In the end John is forced to shoot everyone of them to save their own lives.John fulfills his end of the bargain and drops the group off at the village in Burma.On the way back he disposes of the boat and the bodies therein of the pirates he wasted.Back at the village things seem to be going well until it is invaded by government troops who begin a wholesale slaughter of the village's inhabitants and raze it to the ground.The group of Americans are captured and taken to the soldier's encampment.John is back home and asleep when the pastor from the Church who sponsored the American group,comes to call on him.He tells John the group should have been back 10 days before and has heard they have been taken hostage.The pastor has hired a rag tag group of mercenaries to go rescue the group.John is now hired to take them back to the village so they can get the hostages back.John spends that night forging a new knife and he accompanies the group to the village.Once there he is about to leave with the mercenaries but is told to wait at the boat.The mercs travel inland with a Burmese rebel as their guide and they eventually come upon a group of government soldiers forcing innocent civilians to run through a rice field sprinkled with mines.The civilians make it to one side without mishap but when the soldiers force them to make a return trip,John shows up with bow and arrow in hand and quickly dispatches the entire group of soldiers.From that point on John is part of the rescue team.They find the encampment and set about trying to free the hostages.The main group of mercs get most of the people,but John is still involved in trying to rescue the girl.When things get a little dicey the mercs fall out with those they have.One,a sniper,remains to assist John.With the girl obtained,the three head away from the camp.Early the next morning the Burmese troops awake to find their hostages gone and some of their guards slain and the hunt is on.The troops in good time find the mercs and have them set for the slaughter.John,the girl and the sniper find them,after having blown their trackers to kingdom come by setting off an old WW2 bomb in the jungle.Just as the mercs are about to die the firing begins.John kills a soldier manning a 50c machine gun and starts into ripping up everything in sight.The mercs are into the fight too and it becomes a real slaughterhouse.It's a pitched battle until a large group of Burmese rebels show up to assist John and the mercs.In a poignant scene,when the dust settles,John is standing,slightly wounded,overlooking the battlefield and its carnage.The film ends as John returns home for the first time in many a year.He stops at the post box with his fathers name on it.Then he proceeds to walk the long dusty driveway in towards the farmhouse.From the get go Mr.Stallone makes sure you see the atrocities the Burmese troops commit with actual film and news footage.Then throughout,to reinforce that theme,you get to see recreations of some of the horrible and sick things these government soldiers do to their own people,such as forcing civilians to run through mine fields.He makes sure you're on his side because he does not hold back an inch when it comes to showing the carnage that real bullets do to real bodies.It is not for the squeamish,but Mr.Stallone's set up has steeled you for what is to come and you're on his side all the way.When John takes control of that 50c machine gun in the final battle,it's hard not to be up on your feet encouraging him to go for it.Mr.Stallone has adeptly kept true to the original character,as if time has stood still all these years.Mr.Stallone also makes a wide us of varying camera techniques to put the story over.I particularly liked his,for lack of a better description,prowling tiger mode,if that makes sense.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras includes deleted scenes and several featurettes which I am looking forward to seeing after I write this review(as always I never let extras influence my reviews).There is a second disc,which is a digital copy.All in all a terrific return to the character of John Rambo,made famous many,many years ago.He steps into the character like he just finished the last movie a year ago.The film is sweeping and epic in nature,with a great musical score to enhance the proceedings.It is very realistic in nature but has a reason for being so which,dollars to donuts,you will be behind every minute you watch this baby.4 1/2 stars.Highly recommended.",4,Mr.Stallone upholds the Rambo tradition,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,5781,"['Rambo', 'released',

Rambo may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he is certainly capable of wiping out a whole cadre of Burmese soldiers all by his lonesome.  The poor people being systematically slaughtered under that regime will, I'm sure, be relieved to hear he's on his way.Despite a terrifically high body count and endless footage of stomach-churning carnage, it's amazing just how utterly dull an action movie ""Rambo"" turns out to be.  Stallone, as always, mumbles and grunts his way through his part, which, considering the laughably pretentious dialogue assigned to him (especially in ""reflective"" voiceover narration), is probably the wisest choice he could have made under the circumstances.  Graham McTavish displays some fire in the belly as a belligerent mercenary, but he's the only one on either side of the camera who seems to be putting any real effort into the movie.",2,Dreadful action flick,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,1404,"['something', 'inherently', 'distasteful', 'taking', 'real-life', 'tragedy', 'genocide', 'Burma', 'using', 'fodder', 'yet', 'fantasy-fueled', 'Rambo', 'movie.After', '18-year', 'hiatus', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'one', 'two', 'signature', 'roles', 'other', 'course', 'being', 'Rocky', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'vet', 'John', 'Rambo', 'world-weary', 'cynical', 'reluctant', 'warrior', 'who', 'installment', 'hired', 'lead', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'Burma', 'rescue', 'American', 'missionaries', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'there', 'Rambo', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'certainly', 'capable', 'wiping', 'out', 'whole', 'cadre', 'Burmese', 'soldiers', 'lonesome', 'poor', 'people', 'being', 'systematically', 'slaughtered', 'regime', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'be', 'relieved', 'hear', 'way.Despite', 'terrifically', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'endless', 'footage', 'stomach-churning', 'carnage', 'amazing', 'just', 'how', 'utterly', 'dull', 'action', 'movie', 'Rambo', 'out', 'be', 'Stallone', 'always', 'mumbles', 'grunts', 'way', 'part', 'considering', 'laughably', 'pretentious', 'dialogue', 'assigned', 'especially', 'reflective', 'narration', 'probably', 'wisest', 'choice', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'circumstances', 'Graham', 'McTavish', 'fire', 'belly', 'belligerent', 'mercenary', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'camera', 'who', 'be', 'putting', 'real', 'effort', 'movie']",N/A

If you like action films this is for you. It's cool how this movie is loosely based on a real conflict going on in Burma even as I type this. This is a dark film showing human depravity at the worst. The most realistic Rambo films in some ways. The only Rambo film to show blood after shooting enemy soldiers. If you want tons of character development and a deep story line then read Shakespeare. People complain about not having a deep story line or lots of character development,but only the first Rambo really had that. This movie is right up real Rambo fans alley. Lets be honest we watch these films to see Rambo kick butt. Despite his age he moves just as well as he did back in the day. I thought all the actors did a good job of portraying their characters.the consnot a lot of character development or a deep story line to be found here. Very violent film with soldiers exploding into bloody sprays. Not a big fan of the CGI blood to be honest. Some of the CGI kills look a bit on the phony side to be honest. I hate how they didn't use the back ground music from the other films for the battle scenes. The music they used isn't horrible,but nothing memorable. The picture didn't have any memorable main bad guy that's worth talking about. Funny that even after all this time the racist cop in the first film is still the most memorable bad guy in the series.the conclusionI loved this film for it's dark gritty view of life in Burma.

1151210,A7T1NIWZHTC4P,B0015XHP22,"Seven Kitties ""7kitties""","[1, 4]","I'm still a little boggled by the reviewer who was disappointed that this movie wasn't funny.  The previous three entries in this franchise in my mind haven't exactly been laugh riots, either.Anyway, as an action movie, it's pretty good.  It does test my theory that a movie that is all action all the time actually gets kind of boring--the last half-hour of the film include 10 minutes of running and grunting, fifteen minutes of blowing ammo, intermixed with worried reaction shots.The meat-pinata effects were tremendous, though, as usual, Hollywood still seems to think all blood is bright red. They perhaps overuse the effect, kind of like how Ridley Scott really had too much fun with the Arterial Bloodspray in _Kingdom of Heaven_ (which is really odd because it seems to this medievalist that they wore gorgets--armor on their necks--precisely to avoid the kind of thing Scott finds so cinematic).  Still, it's an impressive effect.They use the new-fangled 'speed combat scenes up and jerk the camera around to make it all like, y'know, intense and stuff' thing only rarely--in fact, so rarely that the few times they trot it out, it's out of place.Julie Benz delivers exactly the same kind of performance she gives as Dexter's girlfriend Rita in the Showtime series--that is to say a woman who thinks that being a 'strong woman' means irritating the poop out of a man until he does what she wants him to.  Outside of horror movies, I have never wanted a character to die so badly.  She's dressed in ethereal, pure white, just in case you're too dumb to remember you're supposed to be on her side. But, I suppose Rambo fights for ideas, and not for charisma of the leading lady.The reason I wasn't crazy about this movie is that compared to the others, the plot was thin. Yeah, that stuff that lets the audience (and the actors) take a breather, that little valley in the rollercoaster that sets us up for the next hill?  Not so much here.  And what there is does keep the veneer of Freudian analysis, except, now, daddy-figure's gone.  I mean, just for a starter, at the beginning of the film, our Man Rambo is collecting *snakes*.  Freudian? Naaaaaah.  And all of the bad guys suffer from various sexual perversions (so we know they're the bad guys, I suppose, in case the killing of women, children and dogs isn't enough to clue us in), compared to sexless God of War Rambo.If you want an action film without all that pesky plot and character development, this is a winner.  If you wanted the same rich mix of story and action that the first three Rambo films had (and that they try to recapture using flashbacks which really just remind us what Stallone looks like without all the steroids), this will disappoint.",3,Not a successor,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,2725,"[""'m"", 'still', 'little', 'boggled', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'previous', 'three', 'entries', 'franchise', 'mind', 'have', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'been', 'laugh', 'riots', 'either.Anyway', 'action', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'test', 'theory', 'movie', 'action', 'time', 'actually', 'kind', 'boring', 'last', 'half-hour', 'film', 'include', '10', 'minutes', 'running', 'grunting', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'blowing', 'ammo', 'intermixed', 'worried', 'reaction', 'shots.The', 'meat-pinata', 'effects', 'were', 'tremendous', 'though', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'think', 'blood', 'bright', 'red', 'perhaps', 'effect', 'kind', 'how', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'really', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'Arterial', 'Bloodspray', '_Kingdom', 'Heaven_', 'really', 'odd', 'medievalist', 'wore', 'gorgets', 'armor', 'necks', 'precisely', 'avoid', 'kind', 'thing', 'Scott', 'so', 'cinematic', 'Still', 'impressive', 'effect.They', 'use', 'new-fangled', ""'speed"", 'combat', 'up', 'jerk', 'camera', 'make', ""y'know"", 'intense', 'stuff', 'thing', 'only', 'rarely', 'fact', 'so', 'rarely', 'few', 'times', 'trot', 'out', 'place.Julie', 'Benz', 'exactly', 'same', 'kind', 'performance', 'Dexter', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'Showtime', 'series', 'say', 'woman', 'who', 'being', ""'strong"", 'woman', 'means', 'irritating', 'poop', 'man', 'what', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'wanted', 'character', 'die', 'so', 'badly', 'dressed', 'ethereal', 'pure', 'white', 'just', 'case', ""'re"", 'too', 'dumb', 'remember', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'side', 'suppose', 'Rambo', 'fights', 'ideas', 'not', 'charisma', 'leading', 'lady.The', 'reason', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'movie', 'compared', 'others', 'plot', 'was', 'thin', 'Yeah', 'stuff', 'audience', 'actors', 'take', 'breather', 'little', 'valley', 'rollercoaster', 'up', 'next', 'hill', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'what', 'keep', 'veneer', 'Freudian', 'analysis', 'now', 'daddy-figure', 'gone', 'mean', 'just', 'starter', 'beginning', 'film', 'Man', 'Rambo', 'collecting', '*snakes*', 'Freudian', 'Naaaaaah', 'bad', 'guys', 'suffer', 'various', 'sexual', 'perversions', 'know', ""'re"", 'bad', 'guys', 'suppose', 'case', 'killing', 'women', 'children', 'dogs', ""n't"", 'enough', 'clue', 'compared', 'sexless', 'God', 'War', 'Rambo.If', 'want', 'action', 'film', 'pesky', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'winner', 'wanted', 'same', 'rich', 'mix', 'story', 'action', 'first', 'three', 'Rambo', 'films', 'had', 'try', 'recapture', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'really', 'just', 'remind', 'Stallone', 'steroids', 'will', 'disappoint']",N/A

1151214,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0015XHP22,Sid the Elf,"[0, 1]","It's a double-dip this week. We polished off Rambo after the wonderfulForced Vengeance. Sid the Elf doesn't want to start a ""Paul is Dead"" type of conspiracy theory here, but are we sure that it was Sly in Rambo and not just some guy wearing a Sly Stallone mask? All right, we'll move on. Why Sly decided to revive Rambo, Sid doesn't know. Maybe it was because Rocky Balboa was well enough recieved. Maybe because he signed a new 3 picture deal(Lockup 2 has to be in the works. Please, Sly!). Whatever the reason, Sid couldn't be happier that John Rambo is back enforcing American rightousness. Even if the old boy Sly had to have botox injections between takes, it was worth it. Rambo was killer--seriously.This time, Rambo lives in Southeast Asia. His existance is really simple and peaceful. Rambo actually seems happy, even if his first line in the movie was ""f-off."" He catches dangerous snakes in the jungle and sells them to a sort of circus. While he's selling off his latest catch, a missonary from Colorado, played by the priest from The Sopranos, approaches Rambo about renting his boat to take the group of missonaries into Burma. The plot thickens, literally.Not wanting to go near the sensativities about the Middle East, Sly decided on setting Rambo in Burma. He centered the film on the conflict between two factions there. In the words of Father Phil, ""It's more like genocide."" The missonaries want to go to Burma to help the group that is being slaughtered. Rambo expresses what Sid is sure everyone watching the movie was thinking: that going into Burma at that point is just a really bad, stupid idea. But, it's here that we see the softer side of Rambo. He lets Sara, who is one of the missonaries, played by the incomparable Julie Benz, talk him into taking them to Burma in his boat(there is probably the ultimate Quagmire joke to be made with that sentance, but Sid will keep this one clean). Not that we can blame Rambo here, she could probably coax Sid into oncoming traffic. Anyway, en route to their destination, Rambo and the gang encounter Burmeese piarates. Of course, Rambo obliterates them. He then drops the group off, and tells them they're on their own and goes back to the pirates' boat to blow it up and destroy the evidence. You know these Burmeese dudes are no joke if Rambo is covering his tracks.About 10 days pass and Rambo gets a visit at his home while he's asleep in his hammock. He is told that the group of missonaries has been captured(shocker) and a band of mercenaries has been hired to get them. Rambo then agrees to take the mercenaries to the point he dropped the missionaries. The leader of the mercenaries is a real stroonz. He argues with Rambo without John J. even saying a word. He even commented on Rambo's ""thousand yard stare,"" saying that he's ""seen it all before,"" and that he's ""not impressed."" Anyway, when they reach their destination, Rambo sets off to go onto land with them. He's told to piss off basically. Unreal. He goes another route anyway, unbenownst to the mercenaries. When they get in trouble, Rambo bails them out. He then organizes the group to infiltrate the camp where the missonaries are being held. He gets them out, but now they have to reach safety. This proves rather tricky, and ends up being the climax of the film. Obviously, Rambo and the mercenaries have a massive firefight with the Burmeese militants. This scene lasts for a good 10-15 minutes and is filled with a wonderfully abundant amount bullets and explosions. The best thing about it though was that it looked so realistic. Guys didn't go flying 10 feet into the air. They just crumpled against the ground. So, after they win(you knew they would) Rambo leaves. We then see him in his old Army jacket with his old bag walking along a road presumably in his hometown of Bowie, Arizona. He is at his father's ranch. As the closing credits roll, he approaches the house.If you notice, Sid doesn't make too much fun of this one, well except for Sly's new weird face. The reason for this is that Rambo was a genuinely good film--seriously. It did have a ton I mean a TON of explosions and guys being ripped apart by large caliber bullets which never hurts the cause. There were  262 kills in Rambo, more than the first three films combined. Sid was surprised by this figure because it didn't seem like there were THAT many bodies falling. The reason for our surprise: the violence was integral to the plot. It underscored the fact that what was going on in Burma was deplorable. In the battle scene, Father Phil picked up a rock and bashed an attacker's head in with a purely visceral look on his face. A more clear symbol of man's survival instincts Sid cannot imagine. Here is a man who vigouously denounced killing at the begining of the film, but changed when he had to. Sly must be huge on change. He uses it as a major theme in Rambo, just like he did in Rocky 4. And you know what? It's what pulled the film together. Sid really cannot even make fun of the scene with Rambo walking down the street at the end. It signified him coming full circle and finally excercising his deamons. Under normal circumstances, Sid would have been hysterical at this sight. But it was actually nice to see some sentimentality and a layer added to a character who, up to that point had been just a killing machine. So, kudos to Sly for a really well-done effort. See Rambo, it is one of the better action flicks around.",5,"Sly never disapoints.

In First Blood, John James Rambo went from a regular guy to a viciously skilled ex-green beret that you do NOT mess with. In the next two sequels, there is no more regular guy...just ""Rambo""...the mercenary-like tough guy that's here to do some damage.Rambo 2008 gives Rambo back a little of the regular guy feel. Rambo is living in what appears as a small fishing village in Thailand where he is approached by some missionaries seeking transportation up river to atrocityville (Burma). Rambo gets the do-gooders to their destination, but things do not go well at all for the missionaries when they come under attack and are captured by the Burmese Army. And it's Rambo to the rescue.The action is great (sometimes a bit over the top, but hey, that's what we're here for, right?) and, as fully expected, Rambo deals out some major just desserts to the bad guys. The fun is packed into a movie that only runs for only about 85 minutes...which is a welcome relief from Hollywood's binge of 2+ hour films.But the nature of knowing that Rambo is going to be this hired gun (again) to get the bad guys versus the victimized loner from the first movie made Rambo 2008 as predictable as they come for me.

1151219,AXF3ZAXUGOEON,B0015XHP22,snowleopard,"[3, 3]","Despite what you may have heard, John Rambo is still very much alive. He's battle worn, sick of the world, and ""retired"" in a village deep in Thailand where he catches snakes, fishes, and sleeps fitful nights.  He probably would have lived out his days this way and quietly died years from now with us never hearing from him had not a group of missionaries from Colorado decided that they would go into the worst area of Burma on a humanitarian mission, or had Rambo been able to talk them out of it. But that didn't happen...And with that set-up, John Rambo is back. I won't recant the plot anymore, suffice to say there is incredible action in this film, just amazing, and if you are like the rest of the population, and Rambo is your kind of American hero, you'll follow his every move.Sylvester Stallone gets some big props here for several reasons. Though you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, it doesn't matter. There are enough surprises, and each individual scene will keep you in your seat. Sly also gets credit for reminding us when he steps up, he can act pretty well. Despite at times being the killing machine you might expect, he does a very good job of the war torn Rambo, and allowing him to be a complex character. The film is also very nice looking, with terrific sound and visual effects, and Brian Tyler's score pays good homage to the late Jerry Goldsmith.There are a few things I had a hard time with though. For taking a step and reminding the world that the regime in Burma (Myanmar) is an oppressive dictatorship, the film may have missed out on showing it's complexity and reality. In this film it's simply an end of the world war zone of all war zones. There's a fine line here, and Sly takes the stance showing the worst of the worst of Burma, in a worst case scenario. This would be more believable had the enemy not be partly faceless, and outrageously cruel. These guys are on par with the Nazis and some of the most brutal inhumane people in history. Are the Myanmar (Burmese) military that brutal? Perhaps at times they have been, but Sly doesn't spend any time showing why, or how it got to be this screwed up. It just is. The film is also incredibly violent and brutal. If you're not ready to see some amazingly realistic gore, you're not going to make it through the film. However, if you can stomach it, the film is very real. War battles aren't guys getting shot with no blood, and rolling over telling their buddies to say good-bye to mom. They are loud, harsh, terrifying, fast and bloody, and this film is as realistic as it gets in this regard, reflecting that ugliness and brutality. Get ready.Rambo fans, or really fans of any action film should watch it. Even if you think you might like this film, you should watch it. If you can handle the brutal reality of it, you'll find it's an excellent addition to the series by Sly and you won't be disappointed.",4,Excellent Addition to the Series,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2911,"['what', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'John', 'Rambo', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'battle', 'worn', 'sick', 'world', 'retired', 'village', 'deep', 'Thailand', 'where', 'snakes', 'fishes', 'sleeps', 'fitful', 'nights', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'out', 'days', 'way', 'quietly', 'died', 'years', 'now', 'never', 'hearing', 'had', 'not', 'group', 'missionaries', 'Colorado', 'decided', 'would', 'go', 'worst', 'area', 'Burma', 'humanitarian', 'mission', 'had', 'Rambo', 'been', 'able', 'talk', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'set-up', 'John', 'Rambo', 'back', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recant', 'plot', 'anymore', 'suffice', 'say', 'incredible', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'amazing', 'are', 'rest', 'population', 'Rambo', 'kind', 'American', 'hero', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'move.Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'big', 'props', 'here', 'several', 'reasons', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', ""n't"", 'matter', 'are', 'enough', 'surprises', 'individual', 'scene', 'will', 'keep', 'seat', 'Sly', 'also', 'credit', 'reminding', 'when', 'up', 'can', 'act', 'pretty', 'well', 'times', 'being', 'killing', 'machine', 'might', 'expect', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'war', 'torn', 'Rambo', 'allowing', 'be', 'complex', 'character', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'terrific', 'sound', 'visual', 'effects', 'Brian', 'Tyler', 'score', 'pays', 'good', 'homage', 'late', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'though', 'taking', 'step', 'reminding', 'world', 'regime', 'Burma', 'Myanmar', 'oppressive', 'dictatorship', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'showing', 'complexity', 'reality', 'film', 'simply', 'end', 'world', 'war', 'zone', 'war', 'zones', 'fine', 'line', 'here', 'Sly', 'stance', 'showing', 'worst', 'worst', 'Burma', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'believable', 'had', 'enemy', 'not', 'be', 'partly', 'faceless', 'outrageously', 'cruel', 'guys', 'are', 'par', 'Nazis', 'most', 'brutal', 'inhumane', 'people', 'history', 'Are', 'Myanmar', 'Burmese', 'military', 'brutal', 'Perhaps', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'Sly', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'showing', 'why', 'how', 'got', 'be', 'screwed', 'up', 'just', 'film', 'also', 'incredibly', 'violent', 'brutal', ""'re"", 'not', 'ready', 'see', 'amazingly', 'realistic', 'gore', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'However', 'can', 'stomach', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'War', 'battles', 'are', ""n't"", 'guys', 'getting', 'shot', 'blood', 'rolling', 'telling', 'buddies', 'say', 'good-bye', 'mom', 'are', 'loud', 'harsh', 'terrifying', 'fast', 'bloody', 'film', 'as', 'realistic', 'regard', 'reflecting', 'ugliness', 'brutality', 'Get', 'ready.Rambo', 'fans', 'really', 'fans', 'action', 'film', 'should', 'watch', 'Even', 'think', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'should', 'watch', 'can', 'handle', 'brutal', 'reality', ""'ll"", 'find', 'excellent', 'addition', 'series', 'Sly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

1151223,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0015XHP22,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 2]","Stallone's back to remind us of what an entertaining action movie should be.  It's been so long since a decent action film came out of the mainstream that this film is a total gut punch.  It more or less slipped in and out of theaters rather quickly and undetected.  A shame, but at the same time the film had zero hype attached to it, making it a more pleasant surprise.  Of course the critics panned this movie big time upon it's release for being too brutal and violent and short on plot.  I guess they forgot they were reviewing a Rambo movie.  But the reasons the critics hated this movie will most likely be the reasons action fans will love it.Stallone wanted to bring the genocide in Burma to the people's attention considering it really doesn't get any news coverage at all.  In the film's intro we're shown some rather graphic and unpleasant newsreel type footage of actual atrocities in Burma.  Stallone tries to simulate this kind of brutality throughout the film.  Though Stallone has a bit of a message he's trying to get across, and we as the viewers do actually become more enlightened about what's going on in Burma, in the end we don't watch action films to be educated.  We want to see Rambo turning schmucks into pulled pork....and that's just what he does here.  Rambo is now an old and grumpy man with a chip on his shoulder who has long since flipped the bird to the rest of the world(and who can blame him after all we've seen him go through?).  His peaceful yet scarred life on the Burmese border is thrown all out of whack when some missionaries want him to escort them into Burma by boat.  After helping out and returning home only to find the missionaries have been captured, it's time to get his hands dirty once again.  This time he's not acting solo, he has the help of a group of mercenaries.Those expecting a good chuckle at seeing an aging Rambo take on an army might be a bit surprised.  The tone of this film is grim, brutal and violent.  Rambo's not cracking any cute one liners, nor is he trying to impress us with his pecs(he spends the entire film in a shirt).  Rambo is old, mean, pissed off and kicking some serious ass.  The guy's so hardcore that he charges into battle with nothing but a bow and a homemade machete!  It may sound unrealistic(which it is) and a bit silly, but it works!  I think it's do to Stallone's directing.  The man does a breathtaking job of shooting action scenes.  The onscreen carnage is downright vicious and shocking.  Try thinking of the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan and you'll have a good idea.  Stallone must have been inspired by his son, Sage, coz the movie is bloody as hell.  An early attack on a Burmese village shows children shot and stomped to death, all in unflinching detail.  When Rambo gets his hands on a gun(and even before that) people are exploding into geysers of blood and body parts.  I'm surprised the MPAA passed this with an R rating!  Apparently Stallone is surprised by that as well.  He got away with it by convincing the censors that the depiction of violence was necessary to show the horrors of war.  I'm sure this is true, but I can't help but think he's chuckling to himself at the victory.I give this the highest recommendation, no doubt about it.

At least this one involves a conflict between a real, live repressive regime that violently stays in power, with all the popular support as that enjoyed by North Korea, and this one isn't saddled with a pro-colonial, pro-imperial side to champion as the earlier Rambo romps.What makes this one a five star Rambo was its jaw-dropping depiction of a claymore mine exploding with what appears to be all the qualities of a low yield field nuclear weapon.  As super-patriot Sly Stallone somehow missed serving in the military during the Vietnam war, he may be excused from thinking that a mushroom cloud is produced by a claymore.There are lots and lots of Saving-Private-Ryan exploding heads and flying flesh.  Some local women (and one guy) are sexually abused (we learn nothing about them or their fates), while the one European woman in the movie is saved from the fate worse than death...and even manages to fall down during the race to escape; she further exercises her acting chops by holding her hands to her ears and looking pained, for the last 20 minutes of the movie, i.e. during the Kill 'em All ""plot"" resolution for which the audience has been so patiently waiting.Next to watching Keanu Reeves drive a motorcycle faster than the light/heat/shock wave of a nuclear blast (Chain Reaction), there's been no better example of testosterone based science fantasy.If you don't care a whit about plot or character development, and if nuance is anathema, this is for you!",5,Taking Claymores Where They've Never Been Before,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,1534,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Rambo', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'conflict', 'real', 'live', 'repressive', 'regime', 'violently', 'power', 'popular', 'support', 'enjoyed', 'North', 'Korea', 'one', ""n't"", 'saddled', 'pro-colonial', 'pro-imperial', 'side', 'champion', 'earlier', 'Rambo', 'romps.What', 'one', 'five', 'star', 'Rambo', 'was', 'jaw-dropping', 'depiction', 'claymore', 'mine', 'exploding', 'what', 'be', 'qualities', 'low', 'yield', 'field', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'super-patriot', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'somehow', 'missed', 'serving', 'military', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'may', 'be', 'excused', 'thinking', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'produced', 'claymore.There', 'are', 'lots', 'lots', 'Saving-Private-Ryan', 'exploding', 'heads', 'flying', 'flesh', 'local', 'women', 'one', 'guy', 'are', 'sexually', 'abused', 'learn', 'nothing', 'fates', 'one', 'European', 'woman', 'movie', 'saved', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'even', 'manages', 'fall', 'down', 'race', 'escape', 'further', 'acting', 'chops', 'holding', 'hands', 'ears', 'looking', 'pained', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Kill', ""'em"", 'All', 'plot', 'resolution', 'audience', 'been', 'so', 'patiently', 'waiting.Next', 'watching', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'drive', 'motorcycle', 'faster', 'light/heat/shock', 'wave', 'nuclear', 'blast', 'Chain', 'Reaction', 'been', 'better', 'example', 'testosterone', 'based', 'science', 'fantasy.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'whit', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'nuance', 'anathema']",N/A
1151226,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B0015XHP22,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[2, 5]","Having only ever seen the original FIRST BLOOD on TV as a child some 20 years ago, I decided to give the series a run through this week.  I rewatched the original and loved it, watched Rambo: First Blood II and rolled my eyes alot but still had fun.  Then watched Rambo III and rolled my eyes more and actually had even MORE fun.So I was really excited to finally reach RAMBO IV to see what Stallone would do with modern day storytelling and techniques.  Well, I hate to say I was bored for about 80 minutes and then postively repulsed for about 10 more minutes.  Let me break things down for you:Boring 80 minutes: Ok, so the last two Rambo's weren't exactly story-driven.  Nevertheless, things made sense.  Rambo is a war machine - you send him into a war zone so he can do his thang.  This film, however, tries to start off on a more serious note.  For starters, we open with Burmese soldiers (sorry, I'm not going to type Myanmarese over and over) playing mine-field ""roulette"" with innocent POWs before mowing them down with machine guns.  So right away we know good times are ahead . . . not.We then see Rambo, but it isn't really Rambo.  No, it's the character Stallone has been playing since COP LAND - the sad, morose guy who looks off into the distance alot and never says anything.  Plus, like a certain Archaelogist who also doesn't belong in movies anymore, he just looks achingly old!  He's huge, yet he never takes his shirt off.  That's because his hugeness is no longer muscle!His moping around just adds to the depressing feel of the opening parts of the film.  Enter happy-go-lucky missionaries.  These guys are total jokes, portrayed as morons who think they can just skip and dance up to the Burmese and have no problems bringing them aid.  Well, here's a head-scratcher for you - THEY GET CAUGHT!  And now Rambo has to go rescue them.But not just Rambo.  No, remember, he's an old fart now - he goes in with a ""team"" of foul-mouthed mercs.  The film plays out predictably, with the mercs being annoyed at Rambo's slow pace until he finally unleashes hell.  Then, for the rest of the film, they pretty much follow him around and take orders.After the requisite Rambo night-raid gone wrong and a shockingly fake digital explosion that takes out half the forest, Rambo and co. head for the final explosive showdown.  And now we reach the . . .Positively Repulsive 10 minutes: Words cannot descibe the finale of this film.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN deserves a PG rating if this film made it out with an R.  Essentially, Rambo mans a 50cal and decimates an entire army for about five minutes.  Exploding heads, severed torsos and limbs, exploding bodies by the jeep and boat load.  All in gooey blood spewing goodness.  I laughed for about 30 seconds until I realized it was going to keep going - by the end I was cowered in the corner of the room in the fetal position.  It's as if Stallone, knowing he couldn't pull off an over-the-top stunt driven ending like he did in the previous films, decided he would make up for it in gore.Well, here in a nutshell is Stallone's problem.  He never made me care about these missionaries.  They were in the film so briefly in the beginning, that when they were taken in the raid, I just didn't care.  And, he didn't really make me hate the Burmese soldiers that much.  Yes, I hate seeing families and children executed and raped - but again, I don't know these people because the script hasn't let me.  So, when we arrive at the blood-bath, I'm just not that invested in hating the Burmese that I want to see them literally blown-apart by machine gun fire.As I mentioned in my title, the Rambo films have always touched on hot-button issues.  This film is no exception.  The message would seem to be ""put away your Bible and take out your gun if you are going to deal with these people.""  This is as pro-war as a film can get these days.What it isn't is a real RAMBO film.  It's a war melodrama - I suppose the conservative side of me can appreciate the sentiment of ""just blow 'em away and let God sort them out.""  But the filmgoing side of me just can't connect THIS character to the same one who once told a Russian helicopter pilot, ""I'm your worst nightmare.""",2,"One thing you CAN say for the Rambo films, they leave us with ALOT to talk about!",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,4217,"['Having', 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'original', 'FIRST', 'BLOOD', 'TV', 'child', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'decided', 'give', 'series', 'run', 'week', 'rewatched', 'original', 'loved', 'watched', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'II', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'alot', 'still', 'had', 'fun', 'Then', 'watched', 'Rambo', 'III', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'more', 'actually', 'had', 'even', 'MORE', 'fun.So', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'finally', 'reach', 'RAMBO', 'IV', 'see', 'what', 'Stallone', 'would', 'do', 'modern', 'day', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'Well', 'hate', 'say', 'was', 'bored', 'about', '80', 'minutes', 'then', 'postively', 'repulsed', 'about', '10', 'more', 'minutes', 'Let', 'break', 'things', 'down', 'Boring', '80', 'minutes', 'Ok', 'last', 'two', 'Rambo', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'story-driven', 'Nevertheless', 'things', 'made', 'sense', 'Rambo', 'war', 'machine', 'send', 'war', 'zone', 'can', 'do', 'thang', 'film', 'however', 'tries', 'start', 'off', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'starters', 'open', 'Burmese', 'soldiers', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'type', 'Myanmarese', 'playing', 'mine-field', 'roulette', 'innocent', 'POWs', 'mowing', 'down', 'machine', 'guns', 'So', 'right', 'away', 'know', 'good', 'times', 'are', 'ahead', 'not.We', 'then', 'see', 'Rambo', ""n't"", 'really', 'Rambo', 'No', 'character', 'Stallone', 'been', 'playing', 'COP', 'LAND', 'sad', 'morose', 'guy', 'who', 'distance', 'alot', 'never', 'anything', 'certain', 'Archaelogist', 'who', 'also', ""n't"", 'belong', 'movies', 'anymore', 'just', 'achingly', 'old', 'huge', 'yet', 'never', 'shirt', 'off', 'hugeness', 'no', 'longer', 'muscle', 'moping', 'around', 'just', 'depressing', 'feel', 'opening', 'parts', 'film', 'Enter', 'happy-go-lucky', 'missionaries', 'guys', 'are', 'total', 'jokes', 'portrayed', 'morons', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'skip', 'dance', 'up', 'Burmese', 'have', 'problems', 'bringing', 'aid', 'Well', 'here', 'head-scratcher', 'THEY', 'GET', 'CAUGHT', 'now', 'Rambo', 'go', 'rescue', 'them.But', 'not', 'just', 'Rambo', 'No', 'remember', 'old', 'fart', 'now', 'team', 'foul-mouthed', 'mercs', 'film', 'out', 'predictably', 'mercs', 'being', 'annoyed', 'Rambo', 'slow', 'pace', 'finally', 'hell', 'Then', 'rest', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'follow', 'around', 'take', 'orders.After', 'requisite', 'Rambo', 'night-raid', 'gone', 'wrong', 'shockingly', 'fake', 'digital', 'explosion', 'out', 'forest', 'Rambo', 'co.', 'head', 'final', 'explosive', 'showdown', 'now', 'reach', '.Positively', 'Repulsive', '10', 'minutes', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'descibe', 'finale', 'film', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'PG', 'rating', 'film', 'made', 'out', 'R.', 'Essentially', 'Rambo', '50cal', 'entire', 'army', 'five', 'minutes', 'Exploding', 'heads', 'severed', 'torsos', 'limbs', 'exploding', 'bodies', 'jeep', 'boat', 'load', 'gooey', 'blood', 'spewing', 'goodness', 'laughed', '30', 'seconds', 'realized', 'was', 'going', 'keep', 'going', 'end', 'was', 'cowered', 'corner', 'room', 'fetal', 'position', 'Stallone', 'knowing', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'over-the-top', 'stunt', 'driven', 'ending', 'did', 'previous', 'films', 'decided', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'gore.Well', 'here', 'nutshell', 'Stallone', 'problem', 'never', 'made', 'care', 'missionaries', 'were', 'film', 'so', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'when', 'were', 'taken', 'raid', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'hate', 'Burmese', 'soldiers', 'much', 'Yes', 'hate', 'seeing', 'families', 'children', 'executed', 'raped', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'script', ""n't"", 'let', 'So', 'when', 'arrive', 'blood-bath', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'invested', 'hating', 'Burmese', 'want', 'see', 'literally', 'blown-apart', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire.As', 'mentioned', 'title', 'Rambo', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'touched', 'hot-button', 'issues', 'film', 'exception', 'message', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'put', 'away', 'Bible', 'take', 'out', 'gun', 'are', 'going', 'deal', 'people', 'as', 'pro-war', 'film', 'can', 'get', ""n't"", 'real', 'RAMBO', 'film', 'war', 'melodrama', 'suppose', 'conservative', 'side', 'can', 'appreciate', 'sentiment', 'just', 'blow', 'away', 'let', 'God', 'sort', 'out', 'filmgoing', 'side', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'THIS', 'character', 'same', 'one', 'who', 'once', 'told', 'Russian', 'helicopter', 'pilot', ""'m"", 'worst', 'nightmare']",N/A

However, I have been asked by a few individuals to write a critique of this film, and so I have. I've never been a huge Rambo fan, and this film didn't change that for me. I've seen many dumb films in my life. Most of them are in the ""so bad, they're good"" category - as in all of Ed Wood's films and anything by William Castle - only they knew how to make B-movies FUN.This new installment of RAMBO (and hopefully the last) is so incredibly stupid, that I cannot believe that it was even greenlit in the first place. Sylvester Stallone is not an idiot. I've seen him in interviews, and he seems like a really cool, intelligent individual. He's even working on an upcoming bio-pic on Edgar Allen Poe, that he is planning to direct. I just don't see why he would waste his time on this disaster of a film, when he could have spent all of that time and energy on his POE project. Who knows? POE might actually be his first masterpiece, if he can stop wasting his time on blown up, macho doo-doo like this.Of course, there are those who care nothing for quality film - no doubt the types that would label indie and foreign films ""stupid"" will likely get a kick out of Rambo. It is a film for neanderthals, plain and simple. There is plenty of carnage, yes, but it has no soul. There is an inherent lack of creativity from the opening credits onward.

1151228,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0015XHP22,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[9, 9]","There isn't a lot of dialogue or even plot to this action film, but that doesn't mean it has no message.Stallone, still impressive at 60, brings back another beloved icon of film, John Rambo.  The plot is deceptively simple in that a small band of religious good deed doers want to sneak into a Burmese village to give some much needed aid and go to the one nut case most likely willing to take them up the dangerous river, Rambo.  While he thinks they are foolish wishful thinkers, he does take them up and does so without payment of any kind making one think that deep down, Rambo would love to seem the succeed somehow after all the violence he has seen.  He even says, in a rare moment when he does speak, that they, these religious warriors, have good lives that they should be grateful for instead of coming here in a vain attempt to change things.Unfortunately, Rambo turns out to be all too right in that their attempts end up getting an entire village wiped out and themselves held captive.  Rambo is then hired by a small commando group of mercenaries to retrieve the kidnapped church team and, naturally, all hell breaks lose.The violence, contrary to some critics, is NOT the type we've seen before.  The battle sequences are disturbing realistic and capture the brutality of war, especially a civil one, in all its intensity.  We see people literally blown apart by mines, 50 caliber machine guns, and bombs.  We see children crushed under boot in front of parents and parents hacked to death in front of their children.  We witnessed rapes interspersed with these other violent images.  It's horrific to say the least.  My heart sank as I watched this realizing it was probably all too realistic.For me the main theme of this Rambo film is a constant theme in our world today, ""Man's inhumanity to man.""  Is there anything in the natural world that even comes close to what we humans do to each other over land, race, religion, ethnicity, or social class?

However it seems that violence and only more graphic violence can carry the Rambo series forward. Bodies are blown to bits with flesh, bones and blood splattered all around using more fire-power and more powerful weapons with Stallone being at the helm of most of such violent acts. Rambo also uses his bare hands, traditional weapons such as the bow and arrow and the machette (or machette like dagger) and using the latter he almost slices one of his adversaries in half. Considering the violence in the film I wonder what is in store in the next installment. I am told Rambo V is being considered and is in the making. Stallone looks a lot older from the first three installments. Thanks to my adoration I can still watch him. Like many of his fans know, Stallone can also really shine in non-action roles but for which Rambo 4 has little scope. One very funny moment that got me rewinding the scene over and over again was the cobra and snake display scene at the beginning of the movie. Just focus on the local Thai commentator speaking English through the microphone, to describe the snakes and the show to the English audience. It is hilarious.

Even as those events are going on, John Rambo is apparently somewhat content to round up snakes and do his own blacksmithing, at least until a god squad of Doctors and missionaries comes to hire him to take them to where the action has been so they can help the victims there.Of course in Rambo's world help would mean changing the situation and change isn't possible if you aren't helping to even the fight between the rebels and the cruel and sadistic military that is abusing them.  Rambo asks the leader of the group if they'll be bringing weapons which is met by a 'we don't support violence' type answer that he follows with a tart 'then you aren't changing anything'.Eventually Rambo is convinced to take the group where they wish to go though the motivation for his doing so is an issue that isn't really resolved in the cut of the film that is on the disc.  In fact there are a few places where the film does a poor job of fleshing out why some things are happening and just what the relationship is between some of the characters, all of which actually seem much better resolved and more detailed in the handful of deleted scenes which are on the disc but weren't included in the movie as released.  Of the scenes on the disc at least 2 or 3 should have gone in as filmed, though in one scene there were obvious sound issues that cause the dialog to be garbled and nearly lost (perhaps explaining why the scene was cut).  Considering the films fairly short running time (just over 90 minutes), including the extra footage probably would have made for a better film.Unfortunately for me looking at Stallone carrying the extra pounds (even as I could point back at my own expanding mid-section) while wearing long hair and trying to portray an ""I've lost interest in the world"" type attitude just didn't work as well as I would have hoped.  Yes the movie is filled with plenty of action, plenty of blood and guts (and gore), and a message that deals with when there is or isn't a time for violence or peaceful approach to resolving problems, but having seen the film I'm left thinking an overweight Sly Stallone in the role of action hero isn't a good thing.  It may as well have been George Foreman (carrying a bunch of his grills) on the screen running through the jungle, as that would have been equally as believable really.This isn't a bad film, and the story is worth discussion, but I don't think it was the best in the Rambo series either.  Compared to the earlier films the story may be better, but the passage of time is obvious to the viewer and that doesn't help the illusion that should exist in the film world.  Plenty of violence, plenty of shooting and killing, lots of blood spurting.  Be aware going into viewing that the film is fairly graphic.

I understand that the film really gives us a harsh view on what is happening in Burma, and I think that was great of Sly to use this setting for his film, yet even though setting is key with many movies, its the actually Rambo character that seems to fall a bit flat the fourth time around. I tried to judge this without included the other Rambo films, but it is so hard to judge sequals, escpically ones that have built such a solid character as Rambo though the years. If we go back to First Blood, we get a great feel for who and what Rambo is, and even with its pretty emotinal ending, you really feel for the John Rambo character. I loved the first, and it remains my favorite of the series. As we go back to First Blood, part II and III, we get a little less dialogue from the Rambo character, as these were a bit more action paced then the first one. We still  get a pretty good idea on character development and exactly what John Rambos motives and intentions are. I didnt enjoy the third film that much, yet it still gave us exactly what was in the title Rambo! On to the new Rambo, and what a difference this film is from the first three. Understand, I didnt want to compare this to the other sequals, but darn it, I wanted to know more about what was going on with Rambo and get some better character development. We realy never get an idea of what Rambo is all about in this film. Since he is the main character, yet has almost no dialogue, how are we supposed to relate to what is going on. Sure, we get the anger at the world bit, and of course once again, Rambo is buried somewhere out of civilization, but I just wish the script was more polished. I know some of you might be saying, this is an action film, and just a shoot em up, do we really need much of a plot. I say yes, because the other three films actually had some more meaning toward Rambo. Sly might not be the greatist actor, but besides Rocky, Rambo is a character that he played to the ""T"". As for the action scenes, they are great. Plenty of flying heads, limbs, and blood, which will satisfy any action fan. It is cool to see the Rambo character blend in with the some of the great special effects modern hollywood has to offer, but beside that, there isnt really much here. I enjoyed it, even though it started out a bit slow, and I say that falls between fair and average, if I gave it a grade I give it a C. The ending is a bit of a surpise. It would have probely stood better, if we got a better understanding of Rambo's character. Its worth picking it up on Sale or a rental, but I think fans of the first three films, might not find this as enjoyable. I have to really disagree with the reviewers that say this film should be viewed by everyone. Sure, it shows the brutality of the Burma Soliders, but as for a history lesson. No, please. That would be like showing Rambo II for a history lesson on Nam. If you want movies like that then stick to Platoon, Hamburger Hill, Hanoi Hilton, Flags of our Fathers, things that have more story to the actual events.",2,"Enjoyable Action, But I expected more  2 1/2 Stars",1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,3164,"['realize', 'critics', 'really', 'gave', 'Rambo', 'bad', 'reviews', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'somewhat', 'understand', 'why', 'understand', 'film', 'really', 'harsh', 'view', 'what', 'happening', 'Burma', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'Sly', 'use', 'setting', 'film', 'yet', 'even', 'setting', 'key', 'many', 'movies', 'actually', 'Rambo', 'character', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'fourth', 'time', 'tried', 'judge', 'included', 'other', 'Rambo', 'films', 'so', 'hard', 'judge', 'sequals', 'escpically', 'ones', 'have', 'built', 'solid', 'character', 'Rambo', 'years', 'go', 'back', 'First', 'Blood', 'get', 'great', 'feel', 'who', 'what', 'Rambo', 'even', 'pretty', 'emotinal', 'ending', 'really', 'feel', 'John', 'Rambo', 'character', 'loved', 'first', 'favorite', 'series', 'go', 'back', 'First', 'Blood', 'part', 'II', 'III', 'get', 'little', 'less', 'dialogue', 'Rambo', 'character', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'paced', 'then', 'first', 'one', 'still', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'character', 'development', 'exactly', 'what', 'John', 'Rambos', 'motives', 'intentions', 'are', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'third', 'film', 'much', 'still', 'gave', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'title', 'Rambo', 'new', 'Rambo', 'what', 'difference', 'film', 'first', 'three', 'Understand', 'didnt', 'want', 'compare', 'other', 'sequals', 'darn', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Rambo', 'get', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'realy', 'never', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'Rambo', 'about', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'yet', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'Sure', 'get', 'anger', 'world', 'bit', 'course', 'once', 'again', 'Rambo', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'civilization', 'just', 'wish', 'script', 'was', 'more', 'polished', 'know', 'might', 'be', 'saying', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'much', 'plot', 'say', 'yes', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'actually', 'had', 'more', 'meaning', 'Rambo', 'Sly', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'greatist', 'actor', 'Rocky', 'Rambo', 'character', 'played', 'T', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'Plenty', 'flying', 'heads', 'limbs', 'blood', 'will', 'satisfy', 'action', 'fan', 'cool', 'see', 'Rambo', 'character', 'blend', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'modern', 'hollywood', 'offer', 'isnt', 'really', 'much', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'started', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'say', 'fair', 'average', 'gave', 'grade', 'give', 'C.', 'ending', 'bit', 'surpise', 'would', 'have', 'probely', 'stood', 'better', 'got', 'better', 'understanding', 'Rambo', 'character', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Sale', 'rental', 'think', 'fans', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'really', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'everyone', 'Sure', 'brutality', 'Burma', 'Soliders', 'history', 'lesson', 'No', 'please', 'would', 'be', 'showing', 'Rambo', 'II', 'history', 'lesson', 'Nam', 'want', 'movies', 'then', 'Platoon', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'Hanoi', 'Hilton', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'things', 'have', 'more', 'story', 'actual', 'events']",N/A

I was blown away by Rambo, great story (left open for sequal?), great action, and the acting was on par.  The ""change"" of setting was welcome as was the current events in that part of the world, made for a more realistic setting as opposed to the tried and true Vietnam background (big fan of Vietnam war based movies).The build up to Rambo unleashed was great, the whole time I was thinking, when are they going to let him rage on these guys?  I thought the Special Forces stealth in and wreak havok then leave approach was a much better idea than the previous run and gun style.  I also appreciated the team style of attack on the camp with the Mercs, coordinated chaos.My only problem with this Rambo is the afore mentioned Mercs, specifically the arrogant ""Old School"" SAS guy.  Sure, that was the role but I didn't feel like he lent much to the overall story.

1151236,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0015XHP22,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","Twenty years after Rambo III and only 2 years after Rocky 6, Sylvester Stallone returns to reprise a seminal 80's action film role as John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran who has trouble reestablishing himself back into regular life. In an attempt to distance himself from normalcy, he holes up in various remote locations and gets by with his expert knowledge in survival. In Rambo, he is driven to the anarchical land of Burma, where a 60 year old civil war keeps the villagers in constant fear. But as one-man armies usually demonstrate, Rambo is most assuredly not a man to be messed with.The fourth installment in the famous soldier-of-fortune series finds John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) in northern Thailand as a boat captain disenchanted with the world, and seemingly far removed from humanity. When a group of human rights activists convinces the weary commando to transport them upriver into war-torn Burma, and are captured shortly after their arrival in a local village, Rambo must lead a team of maniacal mercenaries on a dangerous rescue mission into a hellish war camp where death may be the easy way out.The portrayal of violence in films is often used to demonstrate a specific point, such as comedic excessiveness, realism, political seriousness, a demand for bloodthirstiness, or even to show a highly stylized sense of art. In Rambo, gratuitous violence for the sake of encouraging cheers from a blood-frenzied crowd is perhaps the only reason for such brutally graphic and realistic bloodshed, but it is undeniably thrilling. Where Rambo III featured a stick-fight introduction in which Rambo squares off against a skilled martial artist and the two exchange dozens of blows with wooden bludgeons, Rambo IV doesn't showcase any bloodless, cartoon violence - instead it attempts to show every dismemberment and evisceration with as much attention to gory detail as possible. Here, carnage is not Popeye-fun - it is stomach-churning. Art it is not, but for unabashed gut-wrenching excitement, it positively takes the cake.The introduction of a helping hand for John Rambo is something fresh, even though in the previous films he is never completely alone. Here, in the bloodied battlefields of Burma, a group of hired mercenaries introduces camaraderie and military aid for the military juggernaut. Each carries a unique personality, much like the colonial marines in Aliens, one with an over-the-top penchant for cursing, one with schoolboy charm and decency, one with unflinching heroism and another plagued with constant doubt. Each character is likeable in a singular despicable ruffian way, and their interactions with Rambo help to develop his typical one-dimensional character beyond that of the previous films. The young woman, Sarah (Julie Benz) who convinces John to help in the first place, is an initial driving force, and later the brutality against the villagers fuels Rambo to ""live for nothing, or die for something.""If ultra-bloody violence is your cup of tea, then there's certainly plenty to drink up with Stallone's nonstop thrill-ride Rambo. A simple premise reminiscent of parts 2 and 3 sets up a rescue and final confrontation as brutal as any committed to celluloid. The explosive final firefight unleashes nearly twenty minutes of pure, unrelenting carnage that simultaneously pushes the boundaries of action and bloodletting.As John states early on, ""when you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing,"" and Rambo certainly doesn't shy away from the fatalities or the questionable need to evince the atrocities of war. With machinegun battles that leave little more than bloody human pulp, claymore explosions that wipe out the jungle in nuclear mushroom cloud fashion, grenades that dismember villagers with gushing red barrages, machete disembowelment, and decapitations galore, Rambo is not for the squeamish, and most definitely for those who want to see heads roll and the body count reach unspeakable proportions.- The Massie Twins",4,Rambo Movie Review,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3975,"['Twenty', 'years', 'Rambo', 'III', 'only', '2', 'years', 'Rocky', '6', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'reprise', 'seminal', '80', 'action', 'film', 'role', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'who', 'trouble', 'reestablishing', 'back', 'regular', 'life', 'attempt', 'distance', 'normalcy', 'up', 'various', 'remote', 'locations', 'expert', 'knowledge', 'survival', 'Rambo', 'driven', 'anarchical', 'land', 'Burma', 'where', '60', 'year', 'old', 'civil', 'war', 'villagers', 'constant', 'fear', 'one-man', 'armies', 'usually', 'demonstrate', 'Rambo', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'man', 'be', 'messed', 'with.The', 'fourth', 'installment', 'famous', 'soldier-of-fortune', 'series', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'northern', 'Thailand', 'boat', 'captain', 'disenchanted', 'world', 'seemingly', 'far', 'removed', 'humanity', 'When', 'group', 'human', 'rights', 'activists', 'convinces', 'weary', 'commando', 'transport', 'upriver', 'war-torn', 'Burma', 'are', 'captured', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'local', 'village', 'Rambo', 'must', 'lead', 'team', 'maniacal', 'mercenaries', 'dangerous', 'rescue', 'mission', 'hellish', 'war', 'camp', 'where', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'easy', 'way', 'portrayal', 'violence', 'films', 'often', 'used', 'demonstrate', 'specific', 'point', 'such', 'comedic', 'excessiveness', 'realism', 'political', 'seriousness', 'demand', 'bloodthirstiness', 'even', 'show', 'highly', 'stylized', 'sense', 'art', 'Rambo', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'sake', 'encouraging', 'cheers', 'blood-frenzied', 'crowd', 'perhaps', 'only', 'reason', 'such', 'brutally', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'bloodshed', 'undeniably', 'thrilling', 'Where', 'Rambo', 'III', 'featured', 'stick-fight', 'introduction', 'Rambo', 'off', 'skilled', 'martial', 'artist', 'two', 'exchange', 'dozens', 'blows', 'wooden', 'bludgeons', 'Rambo', 'IV', ""n't"", 'showcase', 'bloodless', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'instead', 'show', 'dismemberment', 'evisceration', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'gory', 'detail', 'possible', 'Here', 'carnage', 'not', 'Popeye-fun', 'stomach-churning', 'Art', 'not', 'unabashed', 'gut-wrenching', 'excitement', 'positively', 'cake.The', 'introduction', 'helping', 'hand', 'John', 'Rambo', 'something', 'fresh', 'even', 'previous', 'films', 'never', 'completely', 'alone', 'Here', 'bloodied', 'battlefields', 'Burma', 'group', 'hired', 'mercenaries', 'introduces', 'camaraderie', 'military', 'aid', 'military', 'juggernaut', 'unique', 'personality', 'much', 'colonial', 'marines', 'Aliens', 'one', 'over-the-top', 'penchant', 'cursing', 'one', 'schoolboy', 'charm', 'decency', 'one', 'unflinching', 'heroism', 'plagued', 'constant', 'doubt', 'character', 'likeable', 'singular', 'despicable', 'ruffian', 'way', 'interactions', 'Rambo', 'help', 'develop', 'typical', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'previous', 'films', 'young', 'woman', 'Sarah', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'who', 'John', 'help', 'first', 'place', 'initial', 'driving', 'force', 'later', 'brutality', 'villagers', 'fuels', 'Rambo', 'live', 'nothing', 'die', 'something', 'ultra-bloody', 'violence', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'drink', 'up', 'Stallone', 'nonstop', 'thrill-ride', 'Rambo', 'A', 'simple', 'premise', 'reminiscent', 'parts', '2', '3', 'sets', 'up', 'rescue', 'final', 'confrontation', 'brutal', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'explosive', 'final', 'firefight', 'unleashes', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'pure', 'unrelenting', 'carnage', 'simultaneously', 'boundaries', 'action', 'bloodletting.As', 'John', 'early', 'when', ""'re"", 'pushed', 'killing', 'as', 'easy', 'breathing', 'Rambo', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'fatalities', 'questionable', 'need', 'evince', 'atrocities', 'war', 'machinegun', 'battles', 'leave', 'little', 'more', 'bloody', 'human', 'pulp', 'claymore', 'explosions', 'wipe', 'out', 'jungle', 'nuclear', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'fashion', 'grenades', 'dismember', 'villagers', 'gushing', 'red', 'barrages', 'machete', 'disembowelment', 'decapitations', 'galore', 'Rambo', 'not', 'squeamish', 'most', 'definitely', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'heads', 'roll', 'body', 'count', 'reach', 'unspeakable', 'proportions.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
1151237,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B0015XHP22,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 5]","RAMBO(2008) Directed and Written by Sylvester Stallone.Starring Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz and Ken Howard.The Burmese Govt is currently committing genocide against its Christianpopulation. In Thailand, a group of missionaries asks expatriotAmerican John Rambo to take them up river into the country so that theymight render aid to their beleagered coreligionists. Reluctantly theex-Green Beret--still haunted by his past---agrees and completes histask.However back in Thailand once more and some time later, Rambo isapproached by the group's Reverend to guide a group of mercenaries backinto Burma so that they may attempt to rescue the missing missionarieswho are being held captive by a brutal army and extermination group ledby a sadistic homosexual commander.However this time Rambo will not just stand by while others do thefighting and dying. This time he will draw upon his old skills and makea choice between ""Live for nothing or die for something.""First off it must be held against the film that the language, graphicsexual content and gore is the most excessive that has yet been filmedin my experience. This is not necessarily Stallone's fault but theresult of Spielberg and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN which seems have compelledevery filmmaker to tragically follow suit. It is a pity that Stallonecould not have resisted the trend since....as always...this type ofexcess is numbing and severely mutes the film's emotional effectivenessand important message. Stallone also apes that chaotic style of filmingcombat that Spielberg used which filmmakers will learn to regret sinceit renders battle scenes well nigh incomprehensible as well as makingit impossible to keep track of who lives and who dies. Again muting anyemotional resonence the battle scenes might have. The use of CGI doesnot help either. One was unaware that high caliber shells---whenstriking human bodies--turn people into cartoons as a prelude tokilling them. One did not know that..upon being stabbed orshot...cartoon blood gushes from wounds. And this is really supposed tobe an improvement over the much maligned John Wayne war movie?? This isreally supposed to be ""realism?""The above still holding firm, this is still quite a goodtight...running at a brisk 85 min...well directed war/action film thathas a strong theme, emotional power and genuine courage....the latersorely lacking in our modern ""I never met a genocidal mass murderer Idid not like unless they invaded Communist Russia in 1941"" Hollywood.While this is not a film for actors--the endless obscenities make anytrue acting impossible---the handling of the Rambo character is nicelyhandled and the resolution of his long odessey(unless Stallone goesahead with a possible fifth film) is moving. The plight of the BurmeseChristians is ghastly and heartbreaking. Stallone to be commended forhis dramatizing this terrible crime especially in a culture that wouldprobably prefer to cheer the Burmese killers on and, in any other film,probably would have villified their Christian victims thusindicating--like with their beloved Muslim Barbarians and theiroutrages....that they probably ""deserve it"". Besides making a bitingcomment about the utterly uselessness of smarmy Liberal platitudesabout peace in the face of such horrific Evil, the film alsorightly......and this appears to have slipped under everyone'sradar...makes a highly brave bit of insight by identifying the leaderof and driving force of the Christian exterminators as being ahomosexual. That right there gives the film more true subversive powerthan anything else made in the last ten years...if even that.Due to the above flaws stated in paragraph 4, I tend to rate the filmbelow FIRST BLOOD and RAMBO 3 while being miles above the second film.However this film has been banned in Burma becoming a much treasuredbootleg within the country much like samisdat was in the old SovietUnion. The film is greatly appreciated by the Burmese Christians andhas been a morale booster for their forces fighting to survive. Theyreportedly have adopted dialogue from the film as rallying cries.Stallone has stated the proceeds from a ""director's cut"" will go to thevictimized people of Burma.So this much maligned film and its much maligned main character is muchmore than merely a good film but rather is a force for good. Meanwhileso-called ""serious"" Hollywood films have chosen not only to be badfilms but vessels of Evil and accomplices of genocide.What does that say about John Rambo and his film series? What does thatsay about those who hysterically have attacked and maligned the samefor over 20 years??Recommended.",3,Live for Nothing or Die for Something,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,4614,"['RAMBO',

1151238,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0015XHP22,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[178, 216]","I must admit, that as of recent I have enjoyed current mainstream movies regardless if they are released to the theater or directly to video so I can abase them.  In other words, I truly find pleasure in ripping movies apart.  It has been my perception, my perception, that about 70% of movies made in the past 5 to 6 years are horrid.One might ask why I feel this way, well it is rather simple.  Most movies are a plug in for a new phone, car or maybe to promote a soundtrack.  These movies also rely more on special effects and visual stimulation, where acting, directing and story take the backseat. Therefore, movies (for the most part) in modern times are nothing more than a 90 to 100 minute commercial.Then of course there are the movies that are so over the top they are just down right silly.  This is the perception I had when I saw the trailer for ""Rambo"" (it was titled ""John Rambo"" when I first viewed it on the internet).  I thought, ""What the hell is Stallone thinking""?  I didn't see the most recent ""Rocky"", but I heard it wasn't any good.  I didn't really care too much about the quality of a new ""Rocky"" movie, but I felt like there was nothing else to do and all doors were closed when ""Rocky 5"" was made.  Why was Stallone going back to Rocky?  Was there a point to it?  Now he is going to make another Rambo movie, why?  Both these characters whose names start with ""R"" make a return after not being seen for almost 20 years?I digress to the trailer for Rambo I saw on the internet.  I was laughing so hard I couldn't take it.  The way this movie was presented was comical.  I had said to my brother and some friends, ""I can't wait to see this movie, I need a good laugh"".  Then the day came, it was a work night (the same as a school night, but you go to work early the next day instead of school) and I went to a 9:40pm showing with my brother and two of our friends.  I was so pumped and all four of us were ready to laugh very hard.  As a side note, this is the first time I had been in a movie theater to watch a new release in a very long time.We watched and we absorbed this movie and when the end credits rolled and the lights came back on in the theater we were speechless. I thought this was the first wonderful and moving film I had seen in a long time.  (So did everyone else in my view party.)  I couldn't believe it.  I have seen all the other Rambo films and yes they were entertaining, but I wouldn't say they were deep or compelling pieces of cinema.  This new Rambo movie had something to say.It followed a different format, it seemed more dramatic and the violence (there was plenty of it) was brutal and candid.  When I say candid, I mean that many of things that happened in this movie, happens in the real world.The plot of this film is rather simple, Rambo now lives in Southeastern Asia near Burma and some American humanitarians need a guide and ride by boat to provide health care, food and education to the poor people in the area. They find John Rambo and after some persuasions from a female team member (Julie Benz) Rambo signs on.Consequently, there is a large militant and fundamental group that has nothing better to do than torture and massacre the less fortunate people in their country.  It doesn't take a wizard to figure out what happens next, Rambo, guns, violence, death, and blah, blah, blah.  However, the violence doesn't seem to be moot or without justification if that makes sense.  The best comparison I can make is to ""Saving Private Ryan"", the violence in that film was graphic and at times over the top, but made a point to portray the reality that was World War 2.  ""Rambo"" has the exact type of feel to it with respect to violence being graphic, over the top and making a point.  Mind you I am not saying that ""Rambo is a better film or as good as ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it was used more as a frame of reference.  Oddly enough, ""Saving Private Ryan"" came out in 1998 and ""Rambo"" came out ten years later (2008), perhaps in 2018 there will be another violent film with a message.Stallone did a good job too in this film he gave a rather minimal performance, not much dialogue but did display a level of dichotomy towards his emotions to events in the plot.  I felt the story was also simplistic, but it worked, the movie didn't need a multi-leveled storyline.  I also felt the direction of the film was very good too; by the way Sly wrote and directed this movie.""Rambo"" was a motion picture that stirred myriad thoughts in my head when it was over.  It made me think how revolting and disgusting it is that there are still countries in the world that can't get health care or are being ""controlled"" and/or restricted to certain living conditions by a dictatorship or totalitarian government that results to violence or casualties of human lives. It also made me think how insane it is that U.S. presidential candidates are able to raise thousands, if not millions, of dollars for their campaigns, but when they get into office, it then becomes difficult to ""raise"" money for the things they promised before they were the incumbent.  Then I thought about how everyone wants to go ""green"" and save the environment, yet it costs more money and there is less tax breaks to ""go green"".  Not to mention Earth Day is only one day a year, rather than year long recognition.  What about relying on fossil fuel when there are other forms of fuel for our cars/machines? Or that many people are more up to date with Reality Television than what is going on in the world.In conclusion, I am not sure this was Sylvester Stallone's intention to stir the pot of modern social sciences or in my case promote schizophrenia when making this movie.  However, I felt this film didn't pull any punches and says a lot about the world we live in, on many levels.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants an eye opening experience.  This is a lot coming from a person who thought this movie was going to be the number one unintentional comedy of 2008 and now believes it was one of the best movies made in a very long time.Sly, I commend you.",5,Was expecting funny and I was given philosophy,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,6096,"['must', 'admit', 'recent', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'current', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'regardless',

Alas, not too be. The aging John Rambo is a snake catching recluse in Thailand, still having flashback nightmares about being a supersoldier and giving 'that 1000 mile stare' to show he's still in a war zone somewhere in his head.Along come a band of arrogant missionaries who want to save the world by sneaking into Burma (aka Myanmar) and giving out Bibles and pills. John Rambo stands in the dark rain and grunts things at them until the pretty missionary (Julie Benz) babbles some nonsense about caring and he cracks. Why Rambo suddenly decides she is worth changing his mind over is never given, he just does it. Then...Big Surprise...the missionaries are caught by sadistic Myanmar goons who think fun is betting on which POW will get blown up in a race through a mine field.Thus it is up to John Rambo and a bunch of foul mouthed mercenaries to extract the prisoners. They do so in standard comic book style, all smart-mouthed quips and great big guns. The goons are creepy torturing rape machines, and so they must all be destroyed, right? Of course! And so, Rambo and his motley crew rescue the fair maiden and her friends with unbelievable amounts of blood, explosions, splatter, decapitations and screaming. The final ten minutes of ""Rambo"" are ridiculously surreal and dopey, including the patriotic rah-rah of making a wimpy snot-nosed pacifist into a real man by having him bash an enemy's head with a rock. USA!! USA!! USA!!Given that you have no true idea why Rambo has a thing for Sarah (Benz) or why he'd agrees to take/save her, the characters have all the depth of a blood splatter. (Even as hyper-masculine asRambo: First Blood, Part 2was, you empathized with John Rambo.) The mercs are a multi-national pack of clich&eacute;s who look down on Rambo until they suddenly decide to follow every order he gives. The missionaries, other than Sarah and Michael, are human props. It was hard to give a darn about anyone involved, as the whole movie is a gloriously shot excursive in mayhem. Unfortunately, for all the flying body parts and spewing blood, ""Rambo"" has no heart. It is as generic an actioner as they come, which is a huge disappointment after what Stallone did with ""Rocky Balboa.""",3,Kablam! Splat!

1151244,AUB7WXM7IX81,B0015XHP22,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[0, 0]","First off, let me say that I have always liked Sylvester Stallone.  Unlike many, I actually find him to be a pretty good actor; certainly he is no Robert De Niro, but given a good role, Stallone can easily carry a film with more than just his ability to kill swarms of people in a stoic manner, which is exactly what he does in Rambo.  Unlike the previous two sequels though, the extreme violence actually serves a purpose here.  I argue that every bit of the carnage on display in this film is justified, because it realistically depicts the ongoing atrocities in Burma/Myanmar that continue today.  Stallone has gone on record saying that this is the main reason he decided to take such a serious and brutal approach to this installment of the popular series, which had been growing increasingly cartoonish.I realize that I will endure criticism for this statement, but I firmly believe that Rambo is the best entry in the eponymous series.  First Blood is second in that line, and honestly, it's second by quite a bit.  The first installment was tense at times and carried a message that was very relevant at the time, which is how Americans treated veterans of the Vietnam war like depraved animals, but as a complete work, it was very flawed - the villains/police pursuing Rambo had terrible aim in their shooting skills, as is typical of many action movies, and were little more than stereotypes.  Rambo is the unequivocal hero, and the sheriff and his buffoon deputies are bigoted and incompetent in every way, stubbornly refusing to listen to the voice of reason, as portrayed by Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman.  First Blood wasn't a terrible film, and in fact was quite good in parts, but Rambos II and III grew increasingly worse, with their pretentious political statements mixed with unbelievable action scenes.Rambo is closer in spirit to First Blood, but is a much different film.  It has the highest body count of the four, and is far and away the goriest, but its vision is uncompromising and much closer to reality.  The plot is threadbare, with a group of Christian missionaries imploring Rambo to guide them upriver from Thailand, where Rambo has been residing in isolation since his last adventure, to Burma.  At first resistant, Rambo eventually succumbs the heartfelt pleadings of the group's only woman, played by Julia Benz.  Predictably they get captured by the Burmese junta shortly after arriving, and Rambo joins a group of mercenaries to save them.It doesn't get much simpler than that, but the impact and attitude of the events are undeniable.  Rambo has grown very cold and existential after his years of killing, and he hates himself for what he has done.  Saving the missionaries is the one thing that can enhance his place in a hopeless world, but more than that, killing is the only thing that Rambo truly knows, and it is inevitable that he must return to his violent ways in a forgotten part of the world where such a thing is barely noticed.  And Rambo does indeed embark upon his ultimate rampage, using weapons designed to take down fighter jets on humans at close range, tearing out a man's throat with his bare hands, using a claymore bomb combined with a Cold War era landmine to create an explosion so big he has to be over a mile away to narrowly avoid it, and wielding the biggest knife I've ever seen.  Despite all this, Rambo doesn't even do most of the killing.  Stallone doesn't turn the camera away when the Burmese army blithely kills innocent civilians for sport in all kinds of savage ways.  With a reported body count of 262, only 90 can be credited to Rambo.  Extreme, certainly, but not unwarranted given the real life circumstances that inspired this movie.Rambo isn't a perfect movie.  The acting ranges from acceptable (Stallone, in a laconic, incomplete performance designed with only partial success to mirror Rambo's disdain for the world) to downright irritating (most of the missionaries and mercenaries).  This isn't the kind of movie you see for great acting though.  It's definitely Stallone's most technically accomplished film as a director, and probably his most politically incisive one, too.  Despite his age (61), he shows that he still inhabits the character and is game for the demanding stunt work required for the movie to be effective, which it is.  It will satisfy most action fans, but will also make them a little uncomfortable, too, which I think is exactly what Sly was going for.  The sequel is belated (20 years after Rambo III!) but welcomed.

1151247,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0015XHP22,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[0, 0]","Movie - 4.5Prior to viewing this film, it had been almost 15 years since I'd last seen a Rambo movie. I grew up watching First Blood Part II on VHS and it made an everlasting impression on me of what a badass soldier should be -- John Rambo. A decade and a half later, when my mind and tastes are a little more refined, I saw this; the next Rambo movie where Stallone was now in his 60s (can you believe it?). Thank goodness Sly kept himself in great shape because this is easily his most impressive performance of the franchise thus far. Yes, even better than the original First Blood. I say this because there are 3 particular points this movie makes that I feel are quite true today and are a testament to change in general: 1) there are some very evil people in this world. 2) if you're unprepared to reap the whirlwind, don't stick your nose into other people's business and always expect things to work in your favor, be they altruistic intentions or not. And 3) the power to change lies solely in the our own hands, be they for good (liberation of the Burmese) or bad (the horrendous forms of oppression as represented by the dictatorship). One can interpret that the Burmese in this film are portrayed as Nazis. And in an effort to provide aid for struggling villages, a bunch of Christian missionaries come in claiming no life is worth taking, but eventually are forced to reconsider this concept when the odds are turned against them for the worst. Not to say salvation is totally dismissible. But after seeing this film, it strongly reinforces the notion that all lives are not created equal and not all people are good and worth saving. Yes, as horrific as it may seem, people can be complete savages when pushed to their psychological and social limits. In a way, that's how cultures have survived the last few millennia, and that's how we'll continue to survive whether we want to admit it or not. It's a simple, yet very effect message within the narrative, which ties into Rambo's character perfectly. From the very inception of his being in First Blood, he ultimately finds his place in the world and ""comes full circle"" with what he is -- not quite a man, not quite a killing machine, but a man who has the power to change by putting his life on the line for something he believes in.Video - 4.5Lionsgate did a great job. The landscape shots are especially beautiful with lush colors and a degree of vibrancy befitting of Blu-ray. I'm also pleased with how well the cinematography looks. Stallone admits that he was going for a shaky camera look to better reflect the personality and symbolic traits of the Rambo character, which actually hold up very well in terms of sharpness and consistency throughout the film. Black levels remain excellent through all of the day and most nighttime shots, and contrast never appears overblown, nor does color saturation. Image detail and sharpness are particularly high through a lot of the action sequences. There's also a nice layer of film grain to give the film a more gritty and theatrical presentation as well. The only problem I have is during the scenes at the beginning and around the prison break sequences. Blacks don't feel quite as strong as they could've been and some of the shots had quite a bit of noise in them. But most dark/nighttime scenes are like that in a lot of movies anyway, so depending on your preference the video may or may not be considered reference overall.Audio - 5.0One thing I love about Lionsgate is that they really go all-out on the audio encoding for their BDs. The DTS-HD 7.1 track really shines in Rambo. You'll also be happy to know that this movie has a lot of gunshots. A majority of the anarchy comes from the left and right (both front and side) speakers with rears providing support for additional effects and music during the more hectic sequences. The sound design itself is very active, showcasing both a well-composed score by Brian Tyler and an equally impressive barrage of noises to give the film a very war-like feel. There are no problems with dropout or loss in quality during any sequence whatsoever, be it the dialogue, sound effects, or music. High and low ends are handled to perfection from the sound of gunshots to the rustling of leaves and the creaking of wood. Separation and directionality are equally distributed throughout all seven speakers with a good majority of it in the sides and rears. But I'd have to say my favorite aspect is in the subtlety of the LFEs. Brian Tyler's score uses some especially drum-heavy pieces during chase sequences, which really immerse the viewer in the gravity of it all. Not to mention bass levels are also very noticeable in conjunction with explosions and the sound of .50 caliber bullets during those scenes. This is easily some of the most reference-quality sound in existence on BD today.Extras - 4.5Like a lot of people here in the U.S., I'm very ignorant when it comes to world affairs. I knew Burma was politically and socially messed up, but I had no idea it was still this bad. The little documentary in the special features is very informative, and in fact, detrimental to my overall opinion of the film as a whole. Some people argue this movie as being pro-war, but I think it's just indicative to the philosophy ""live for nothing, or die for something."" The film commentary and documentary within the specials are very astute in their content, and I highly recommend any fans of the movie give them a try. Oh, and as a film the behind-the-scenes and making of features are also worth a watch. Narrative brevity aside, it's interesting to realize this is still a Hollywood movie and that a lot of physical work was put into its production.Overall - 5.0Rambo is a very entertaining and provoking, if not grotesquely accurate war movie. It conveys a message that violence is, in fact a necessary evil at times, and that not all people should be given the benefit of the doubt. No, it's not cruel to think that way, it's a fact of life, and I applaud Stallone for telling it like it is. Lionsgate did a splendid job with the video and audio presentation, and the poignant extra features are very enlightening.

1151257,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0015XHP22,Wuchak,"[4, 5]","""Rambo"" (2008) is the fourth installment in the Rambo franchise after ""First Blood"" (1982), ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) and ""Rambo III"" (1988). I'm a huge fan of the first one, which I think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are merely okay IMHO; although Sylvester Stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous in these sequels, the stories are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard. In other words, there's very little depth, if any. This third sequel makes up for all that because it's not cartooney at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form.THE STORY: John Rambo is alone & bitter and living hand-to-mouth in Thailand when a group of Christian missionaries enlist him to take them into Burma (aka Myanmar) to aid a village of people. Rambo strongly discourages them in light of the political instability of the country, which includes heavy persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist on trying to help so he does it anyway. Weeks later he learns the missionaries have been taken captive so he goes back with a group of mercenaries to bring them out, if possible.""Rambo"" combines elements of ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Killing Fields"" and the first two Rambo films and is ultra-serious & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's probably the most violent film ever made. No lie. The picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. The Christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the Myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for ""fun;"" they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. Obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. Such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: Utter annihilation.Numerous important themes are addressed in the picture (besides the main theme noted above):-- Bitterness/despair and deliverance. The beginning of the film shows Rambo in a complete state of bitterness: He's just existing. He has no friends. He doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's very few words laced with expletives. The male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. Two Biblical proverbs state ""a gentle answer turns away wrath"" and ""a gentle tongue can break a bone."" The female missionary (Julie Benz) knows this and skillfully talks John into helping them. Yet there's more going on here than just that. This woman with a heart of gold is Rambo's ""golden connection"" out of the horrible rut of bitterness he's fallen into. Despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eys -- a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer however faint. Is Rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? John instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. There's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her (realistic) attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. She stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for for too long.-- Violence is not always necessary. Although this is the most violent film ever made it skillfully shows when pacifism is appropriate. Note the incident on Rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continuously insults John and tries to provoke him into a fight. Rambo completely ignores him, choosing not even say a word. In other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. It takes true strength to do this and Rambo has this strength. Indeed, John treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. What do you do when a gnat bothers you? Do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it?-- Total pacifism does not work. I'm a Christian and would like to point out that the New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extemists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. The lead male missionary in the film is such a person (which I found unrealistic btw), but he learns the error of his ways before the story is over. This is an important point: Some people are so morally degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said ""ultimate"").-- The possibility of Rambo's spiritual rebirth [SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this paragraph unless you've already seen the film and/or want to entertain possible insights]. Although the first two sequels are cartooney and lack depth they show Rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. In the second film he gets a Buddhist necklace off of the Asian woman he befriends (who, of course, dies) and at the beginning of ""Rambo III"" he is shown working at a Buddhist temple and helping out the priests there; later, he meets and wins the hearts of (moderate) Islamic villagers and gives his Buddhist necklace to a Muslim boy who helped him out. In ""Rambo,"" as previously noted, the female missionary is key in John's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family back in the USA. He mumbles that he might have a father, he really wasn't sure, and obviously didn't care at that point. She later gives him a cross necklace for helping them out (he wouldn't take money). Anyway, the end of the film shows Rambo back in America walking to his family ranch. Obviously John had a profoundly positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story. The precise nature and extent of this change is not known, unless there's (hopefully) a fifth film [END SPOILER].""Rambo"" was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone and filmed in Thailand. The locations are magnificent.BOTTOM LINE: One reviewer said he went to see ""Rambo"" for some mindless action & laughs but was unexpectedly and deeply moved instead. The story only runs 80 minutes, not including credits, and it's ultra-intense from beginning to end. In fact, I don't suggest seeing the film right before you go to bed because you'll likely be too riled up by the onslaught of violence and intensity to sleep.""Rambo"" is easily the second best of the series, second only to the first one; even that's debatable.Personal Grade: A",5,Intense.,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,6636,"['Rambo', '2008', 'fourth', 'installment', 'Rambo', 'franchise', 'First',

1151258,AP3B615GM191G,B0015XHP22,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","After nearly 20 Rambo-less years (1988-2007), I was a bit skeptical about what to expect from this film.  Sylvester Stallone seemed a bit old to be playing the lead role, and the character had been ""on the shelf"" for so long that his viability in American culture was very much in doubt.  Fortunately, though the writers/producers didn't get everything right, they pleasantly surprised me by providing a film that is quite enjoyable and worthy of the Rambo title.For a basic plot summary, this film explores a much darker side of the John Rambo (Stallone) character.  Found in the deepest regions of Indo-China, an emotionally lost and severely conflicted Rambo reluctantly agrees safe passage to a group of missionaries bringing supplies to the war-ravaged region of Burma.  When the peace mission goes awry and the mercenaries are called in, Rambo feels compelled to once again enter the war zone he has tried for so long to avoid.Really, the only glaring problem with this film is that the plot is very predictable.  You know that things will get screwed up somehow and that Rambo will be called in to fix the situation, so some of the Burmese-territory exposition is a little tedious.  If you can get past this, though, it truly is an entertaining film.The aspect that stands out the most is the brutalness of the entire picture.  What the film loses in predictability it makes up for with some brutal scenes that will really make you despise the Burmese war force.  The slaughter of women, children, animals, and the complete burning of villages are shown with no detail spared.  Plus, it isn't as if the brutality is just being played for bloody special effects, either.  Stallone did his research this time and tried to replicate the shock value of civil warfare/genocide, and the result are some very shocking scenes.What really sets this movie apart, though, is its focus on the John Rambo character.  Whereas parts II & III of the series were just shoot-em-ups, this installment actually tries (like the original) to delve into what makes Rambo tick.  In fact, a lot more time (the film is only 91 minutes long) could have been devoted to the inner-workings of the Vietnam Vet and it wouldn't have been boring.Thus, if you are at all skeptical about coming back to the Rambo franchise after such a long layoff, please dispel those notions and see this movie.  It is easily the best effort in the franchise since the original First Blood.",4,Brutal (If Predictable) Storyline Leads To Great Character Growth,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2447,"['nearly', '20', 'Rambo-less', 'years', '1988-2007', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'seemed', 'bit', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'shelf', 'so', 'long', 'viability', 'American', 'culture', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'Fortunately', 'writers/producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'providing', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'worthy', 'Rambo', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'much', 'darker', 'side', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Stallone', 'character', 'Found', 'deepest', 'regions', 'Indo-China', 'emotionally', 'lost', 'severely', 'conflicted', 'Rambo', 'reluctantly', 'safe', 'passage', 'group', 'missionaries', 'bringing', 'supplies', 'war-ravaged', 'region', 'Burma', 'When', 'peace', 'mission', 'awry', 'mercenaries', 'are', 'called', 'Rambo', 'compelled', 'once', 'again', 'enter', 'war', 'zone', 'tried', 'so', 'long', 'avoid.Really', 'only', 'glaring', 'problem', 'film', 'plot', 'very', 'predictable', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'screwed', 'up', 'somehow', 'Rambo', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'fix', 'situation', 'Burmese-territory', 'exposition', 'little', 'tedious', 'can', 'get', 'though', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'film.The', 'aspect', 'out', 'most', 'brutalness', 'entire', 'picture', 'What', 'film', 'predictability', 'up', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'despise', 'Burmese', 'war', 'force', 'slaughter', 'women', 'children', 'animals', 'complete', 'burning', 'villages', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'spared', ""n't"", 'brutality', 'just', 'being', 'played', 'bloody', 'special', 'effects', 'either', 'Stallone', 'did', 'research', 'time', 'tried', 'replicate', 'shock', 'value', 'civil', 'warfare/genocide', 'result', 'are', 'very', 'shocking', 'scenes.What', 'really', 'movie', 'apart', 'focus', 'John', 'Rambo', 'character', 'Whereas', 'parts', 'II', 'III', 'series', 'were', 'just', 'shoot-em-ups', 'installment', 'actually', 'original', 'delve', 'what', 'Rambo', 'tick', 'fact', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'film', 'only', '91', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'inner-workings', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'boring.Thus', 'are', 'skeptical', 'coming', 'back', 'Rambo', 'franchise', 'long', 'layoff', 'please', 'dispel', 'notions', 'see', 'movie', 'easily', 'best', 'effort', 'franchise', 'original', 'First', 'Blood']",N/A
