Tim Allen had a good thing with the show.  I wish he would have done another season or two instead of moving on to some of the worthless movies that he did (i.e Shaggy Dog).However, the show was concluded very nicely which this set obviously includes.  If you were a fan of the show, this is a must have.  The shows are in their full length, uncut versions instead of the trimed down version that you see in syndication.I have to say one of my favorite aspects of season seven was the departure of that annoying brat, Jonathon Taylor Thomas.  His ultra-liberal ways and stupid comments were really beginning to get on my nerves.  Even Tim Allen has admitted that he wanted him off the set.  Good riddance to JTT.I would have liked to see Tim finally win the Christmas contest in the last season.....",5,The show will be missed....,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,874,"['Home', 'Improvement', 'far', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'had', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'season', 'two', 'instead', 'moving', 'worthless', 'movies', 'did', 'i.e', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', '.However', 'show', 'was', 'concluded', 'very', 'nicely', 'set', 'obviously', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'shows', 'are', 'full', 'length', 'uncut', 'versions', 'instead', 'trimed', 'version', 'see', 'syndication.I', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'departure', 'annoying', 'brat', 'Jonathon', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'ultra-liberal', 'ways', 'stupid', 'comments', 'were', 'really', 'beginning', 'get', 'nerves', 'Even', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'admitted', 'wanted', 'off', 'set', 'Good', 'riddance', 'JTT.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Tim', 'finally', 'win', 'Christmas', 'contest', 'last', 'season', '..']",Home Improvement: Season 7
