555643,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B00004WIC6,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[3, 3]","""Franklin and the Green Knight"" is a top-notch production in so many ways. The story itself is very charming, captivating and enough to hold the interest of a wide variety of viewers. The music is well-done, from the feature's vocal musical numbers to the excellently scored background music. The animation is bright and colorful and the characters are all well-suited to their roles. The DVD enhances all of this. One of the best special features is a ""making-of"" featurette, which includes interviews with Paulette Bourgeois (the author of the ""Franklin Books""), Noah Reid (voice of Franklin), Kristen Bone (voice of Snail) and many other crew associated with the program. Also including is a ""music video"" feature which lets viewers quickly view any of the movie's musical numbers. For those that have a DVD-Rom on their computer, there are also games.",5,"Great Movie, DVD Only Makes It Better",1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,855,"['Franklin', 'Green', 'Knight', 'top-notch', 'production', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'very', 'charming', 'captivating', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'wide', 'variety', 'viewers', 'music', 'well-done', 'feature', 'vocal', 'musical', 'numbers', 'excellently', 'scored', 'background', 'music', 'animation', 'bright', 'colorful', 'characters', 'are', 'well-suited', 'roles', 'DVD', 'One', 'best', 'special', 'features', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'Paulette', 'Bourgeois', 'author', 'Franklin', 'Books', 'Noah', 'Reid', 'voice', 'Franklin', 'Kristen', 'Bone', 'voice', 'Snail', 'many', 'other', 'crew', 'associated', 'program', 'Also', 'including', 'music', 'video', 'feature', 'viewers', 'quickly', 'view', 'movie', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'DVD-Rom', 'computer', 'are', 'also', 'games']",N/A

Gross ""Mom of 2 Kids & 2 Labs""","[11, 11]","My mom sent my daughter this video since she recently had a baby brother join our family and my mom thought our daughter would relate to this turtle.  (In this video Franklin's mother is pregnant with a second child and Franklin has to deal with his excitement, fears and jealousy about that, and there are other nice lessons to learn in the video via the Green Knight story, too.)  I doubted very much that she would &quot;get&quot; the connection and I don't know for sure whether she has or not, but this is now her number one favorite video, over the former standards Elmo and Bear in the Big Blue House!  It is long, but she loves it and pays attention to the entire thing every time.  I love the smiles on her face and her little chuckles as the story progresses; she truly loves the Franklin character.  We've had it less than a month and she has watched it at least 15 times (and I really limit her daily dose of TV; she just picks this one everyday).  Right now I'm shopping for another Franklin video because he is a sweet character and the video we have has a  very nice and non-violent story, which is important to me.  I don't let my daughter watch most Disney stuff yet because I don't want her to see fighting and other scary stuff yet; life is tough enough for a 2 year old.  Anyway, that's my 2 cents.",5,Gift from Grandma is a HIT with 2 year old!,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,1318,"['mom', 'sent', 'daughter', 'video', 'recently', 'had', 'baby', 'brother', 'join', 'family', 'mom', 'thought', 'daughter', 'would', 'relate', 'turtle', 'video', 'Franklin', 'mother', 'pregnant', 'second', 'child', 'Franklin', 'deal', 'excitement', 'fears', 'jealousy', 'are', 'other', 'nice', 'lessons', 'learn', 'video', 'Green', 'Knight', 'story', 'too', 'doubted', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'connection', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'not', 'now', 'number', 'one', 'favorite', 'video', 'former', 'standards', 'Elmo', 'Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'long', 'attention', 'entire', 'thing', 'time', 'love', 'smiles', 'face', 'little', 'chuckles', 'story', 'Franklin', 'character', ""'ve"", 'had', 'less', 'month', 'watched', 'least', '15', 'times', 'really', 'limit', 'daily', 'dose', 'TV', 'just', 'one', 'everyday', 'Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'shopping', 'Franklin', 'video', 'sweet', 'character', 'video', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'non-violent', 'story', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'most', 'Disney', 'stuff', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'fighting', 'other', 'scary', 'stuff', 'yet', 'life', 'tough', 'enough', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Anyway', '2', 'cents']",N/A
