955585,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000C830BQ,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Decision at Sundown, 1957 filmA man leaves a stagecoach and mounts a horse for his travel to the town of Sundown. He is looking for a man. [Revenge is his motive.] Bart wants a shave. Ruby plans to leave, and tells Tate why she will attend his wedding. Who else will attend Kimbrough's wedding? The tavern offers free drinks today. Is there any reason why this marriage should not occur? Bart asks Tate about a woman in another town. The two men take refuge in a stable. Lucy rides off, she avoids the marriage. The townsmen will support Tate against Bart. Men shoot at the stable after the two men refuse to surrender. The doctor enters to retrieve his satchel, and treats one wounded man. He warns against revenge.Back at home Lucy talks to her Dad. Will Tate allow Bart to leave? One man offers a deal to Mr. Allison to leave town, $500 in cash. It is refused. Sam wonders if they should take the deal. Lucy asks Tate about Mary. He says he isn't a saint, she knew about Ruby. Lucy goes to the stable to talk to Bart Allison; Mary was his wife. Whose fault was it, asks Lucy. Sam tells Bart what he doesn't want to know. Sam leaves for the restaurant, then talks to the doctor. [This provides more background information.] As Sam walks away he is shot in the back! The Sheriff orders the people off the street. There is drama in the tavern. Whose town is it, asks the doctor? Who let them take over the town by doing nothing? [A reference to the 1950s?] The speech has an effect, some volunteer to even the odds. [Believable?] Morley's cowboys act.The Sheriff walks toward Bart. One man is wounded, the other dead. Bart is treated by the doctor. Tate won't leave town, but the people no longer respect him. Have things changed? Tate straps on his gunbelt. Will he get lucky? Lucy tells Bart that Tate has lost everything (the support of the people). Tate walks toward Bart, a shot from Ruby fells Kimbrough! Later Tate and Ruby leave town in a buggy. Morley buys drinks for everyone, except Bart Allison. Later Bart rides off, The people won't forget what he did.This story of a man seeking revenge seems to reference the politics of the 1950s. What if a man assumes power, then is shown to be a fraud? This exposure will free the people who were fooled by him. Does this still go on today?

955586,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000C830BQ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I'm not really a Western person.  I think I preface most of my reviews on Western's with that statement.  I just have never really found them the most compelling genre, but I understand their appeal to many.  Still, in my attempt to see everything of note and merit, I have seen my fair share of Westerns.  In all honesty, I have to say that `Decision at Sundown' was one I wasn't at all anticipating and yet found very well constructed and much deeper than I expected.With a complexity of storytelling that really embellished the film's themes, `Decision at Sundown' takes a familiar premise (that of a hatred fueled shootout) and infuses it with a backstory that feels very honest.  It allows for character development in a way that isn't overbearing but that is thoughtful and multi-faceted.The performances are all rather good.  John Carroll is a supreme villain and works charisma into his stance, which only makes him all the more chilling, and Noah Beery Jr. is the perfect complement to the lead's tattered soul.  Randolph Scott plays that tattered soul with enough angst to make his backstory sing.  Some have balked that this doesn't answer questions soon enough, but by allowing us to contemplate the answers before they are given, `Decision at Sundown' offers the audience a rich resolve with a deeper impact.  With a dramatic and rapturous score and set pieces and costumes to die for, this is a Western I'm glad to have seen!",5,The decision to see this was a good one...,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1439,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'Western', 'person', 'think', 'preface', 'most', 'reviews', 'Western', 'statement', 'just', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'most', 'compelling', 'genre', 'understand', 'appeal', 'many', 'Still', 'attempt', 'see', 'everything', 'note', 'merit', 'have', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'Westerns', 'honesty', 'have', 'say', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'was', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'anticipating', 'yet', 'found', 'very', 'well', 'constructed', 'much', 'deeper', 'expected.With', 'complexity', 'storytelling', 'really', 'embellished', 'film', 'themes', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'familiar', 'premise', 'hatred', 'fueled', 'shootout', 'backstory', 'very', 'honest', 'character', 'development', 'way', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'thoughtful', 'multi-faceted.The', 'performances', 'are', 'rather', 'good', 'John', 'Carroll', 'supreme', 'villain', 'charisma', 'stance', 'only', 'more', 'chilling', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'perfect', 'complement', 'lead', 'tattered', 'soul', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'tattered', 'soul', 'enough', 'angst', 'make', 'backstory', 'sing', 'have', 'balked', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'soon', 'enough', 'allowing', 'contemplate', 'answers', 'are', 'given', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'audience', 'rich', 'resolve', 'deeper', 'impact', 'dramatic', 'rapturous', 'score', 'set', 'pieces', 'costumes', 'die', 'Western', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'seen']",Decision At Sundown

I really wanted this tape, especially as it had a giveaway price, but unfortunately the maunufacturer is GOODTIMES.They issued videos at slower tape speeds and without HiFi sound.

955588,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000C830BQ,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","I've always liked Randolph Scott westerns. It's hard not to if a person likes Scott's style, manner, authority and, in his movies with Budd Boetticher, his approach to being an aging, moralistic grim reaper in showdowns with bad guys like Lee Marvin and Richard Boone. I'll make an exception for Decision at Sundown.What put me off was a drama without, for 50 minutes of the 77-minute running time, any gripping motivation for Bart Allison's (Randolph Scott) hatred. We know something, probably nasty, happened to Mary and that the slick Tate Kimbrough (John Carroll) had something to do with it. But what? Allison's sick obsession with killing Kimbrough (""For three years I've hunted Kimbrough, but he didn't know it. Before I settle with him I want him to know he's being hunted.""), even on Kimbrough's wedding day when Allison arrives at Sundown, seems more like a plot device than a major justification for violence. With Kimbrough running the town, with a sly and cowardly sheriff in his pocket and his bride's wealthy father somehow beholden, it's everybody against Allison and his sidekick, Sam (played by that good-natured actor, Noah Beery, Jr.).While we learn that Mary had some qualities other than saintly goodness, for most of the movie Scott winds up sounding like a man choking back tears and irrationally unwilling to hear a bad -- or even balanced -- word against his dead wife. It's an odd performance. By the time we really get to know the people of Sundown -- not just Tate Kimbrough, but his fianc&eacute; (Karen Steele), who doesn't love Tate, his girl friend (Valerie French), who does, and leering barbers, avuncular barkeeps, a noble doctor, a vicious deputy sheriff and assorted nervous and cowed onlookers -- the fact that there might be two sides to what Allison believes becomes more of a righteous afterthought. There are too many clich&eacute;s in the screenplay (""You just stood up there in church and told Kimbrough you wuz gonna kill him? Bart, you must be plumb crazy!""), an uninvolving plot and an unsatisfactory character for Scott. The movie's not all that bad, but not very good. I'll say this: The conclusion, bitter and drunken, almost makes up for the rest. Some think this movie holds up well, including Taylor Hackford, who provides an analysis of the movie. This is one to watch and then make up your own mind.Scott commands the screen, even when a couple of times he sounds like he's about to cry when he thinks of Mary. He was 59 when he made this movie. He made two more before retiring in 1962 with a great finish as Gil Westrum in Ride the High Country. Here he's starting to show his years but it doesn't matter. Whether he was lucky with his metabolism or just dieted rigorously, he doesn't carry an ounce of fat on his frame. He's lean, muscular, moves well and looks believable in a show down. If, like me, you weren't impressed with the Boetticher/Scott combo in Decision at Sundown, just take a look at The Tall T. This Boetticher/Scott movie was made two years earlier. It benefits enormously from a story by Elmore Leonard and a taut, suspenseful screenplay by Burt Kennedy. The Tall T, together withSeven Men from NowandRide the High Countyare Randolph Scott in his later years at his best.The DVD is part ofThe Budd Boetticher Box Set (The Tall T, Decision at Sundown, Buchanan Rides Alone, Ride Lonesome, Comanche Station). To give due credit, the set should have been titled the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott Box Set.",3,"Bitterness and obsessive hate, plus choked back tears, make for an odd Randolph Scott role",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,3480,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'hard', 'not', 'person', 'Scott', 'style', 'manner', 'authority', 'movies', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', 'approach', 'being', 'aging', 'moralistic', 'grim', 'reaper', 'showdowns', 'bad', 'guys', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Richard', 'Boone', ""'ll"", 'make', 'exception', 'Decision', 'Sundown.What', 'put', 'off', 'was', 'drama', '50', 'minutes', '77-minute', 'running', 'time', 'gripping', 'motivation', 'Bart', 'Allison', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'hatred', 'know', 'something', 'probably', 'nasty', 'happened', 'Mary', 'slick', 'Tate', 'Kimbrough', 'John', 'Carroll', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'what', 'Allison', 'sick', 'obsession', 'killing', 'Kimbrough', 'three', 'years', ""'ve"", 'hunted', 'Kimbrough', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'settle', 'want', 'know', 'being', 'hunted', 'even', 'Kimbrough', 'wedding', 'day', 'when', 'Allison', 'Sundown', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'major', 'justification', 'violence', 'Kimbrough', 'running', 'town', 'sly', 'cowardly', 'sheriff', 'pocket', 'bride', 'wealthy', 'father', 'somehow', 'beholden', 'everybody', 'Allison', 'sidekick', 'Sam', 'played', 'good-natured', 'actor', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'learn', 'Mary', 'had', 'qualities', 'other', 'saintly', 'goodness', 'most', 'movie', 'Scott', 'up', 'sounding', 'man', 'choking', 'back', 'tears', 'irrationally', 'unwilling', 'hear', 'bad', 'even', 'balanced', 'word', 'dead', 'wife', 'odd', 'performance', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'Sundown', 'not', 'just', 'Tate', 'Kimbrough', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Karen', 'Steele', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Tate', 'girl', 'friend', 'Valerie', 'French', 'who', 'leering', 'barbers', 'avuncular', 'barkeeps', 'noble', 'doctor', 'vicious', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'assorted', 'nervous', 'cowed', 'onlookers', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'two', 'sides', 'what', 'Allison', 'more', 'righteous', 'afterthought', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'screenplay', 'just', 'stood', 'up', 'there', 'church', 'told', 'Kimbrough', 'wuz', 'gon', 'kill', 'Bart', 'must', 'be', 'plumb', 'crazy', 'uninvolving', 'plot', 'unsatisfactory', 'character', 'Scott', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'say', 'conclusion', 'bitter', 'drunken', 'almost', 'up', 'rest', 'think', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'including', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'who', 'analysis', 'movie', 'one', 'watch', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.Scott', 'screen', 'even', 'when', 'couple', 'times', 'cry', 'when', 'Mary', 'was', '59', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'made', 'two', 'more', 'retiring', '1962', 'great', 'finish', 'Gil', 'Westrum', 'Ride', 'High', 'Country', 'Here', 'starting', 'show', 'years', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'lucky', 'metabolism', 'just', 'dieted', 'rigorously', ""n't"", 'carry', 'ounce', 'fat', 'frame', 'lean', 'muscular', 'moves', 'well', 'believable', 'show', 'down', 'were', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Boetticher/Scott', 'combo', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'Tall', 'T.', 'Boetticher/Scott', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'benefits', 'enormously', 'story', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'screenplay', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'Tall', 'T', 'together', 'withSeven', 'Men', 'NowandRide', 'High', 'Countyare', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'later', 'years', 'best.The', 'DVD', 'part', 'ofThe', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', 'Box', 'Set', 'Tall', 'T', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'Buchanan', 'Rides', 'Alone', 'Ride', 'Lonesome', 'Comanche', 'Station', 'give', 'due', 'credit', 'set', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Budd', 'Boetticher/Randolph', 'Scott', 'Box', 'Set']",Decision At Sundown
955589,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,B000C830BQ,Douglas Doepke,"[11, 12]","One of a handful of remarkable Westerns made by the Ranown production team in the late 50's that established director Budd Boetticher as a master of the genre and Randolph Scott as an icon. All are small-scale, tightly witten, psychologically complex, and shine like polished nuggets. The least scenic of the brood, Decision nevertheless features some of the best one-liners of any Western, ( ""Back where I come from, folks don't  celebrate or make a big to-do when a man acts the way a man's supposed to act,"" snarls Scott's Bart Allison, surely one of the orneriest leads in all cowboydom). The plot itself concerns a revenge obsessed Allison upsetting Sundown's outward calm and toppling the town despot. It's fun to watch alliances rearrange among the shifty townspeople in response to the pig-headed Allison. Then too, suave bad-guy John Carroll more than matches mean-spirited good-guy Scott in the likability department, leaving the audience without the usual white-hat, black-hat stereotypes of the day. My one complaint: where was Boetticher when Vaughn Taylor ruins several barroom scenes with clownish overacting as the town drunk; for a filmmaker who so clearly understood that less often produces more, this seems a curious lapse. Anyway, the film can be enjoyed on its own, or as a step forward in the evolution of the Western before the Vietnam War and iconoclasm in general drove the species to extinction.",5,I Don't Care If Your Arm's Shot Off.
