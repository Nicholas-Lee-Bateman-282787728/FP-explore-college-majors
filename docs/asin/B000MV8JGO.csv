Seven are available at this time, and the series is scheduled to be completed in 2010.  Each of these DVD's is exciting and informative.This DVD takes you through the life of Jesus.  What a blessing to feel like you are actually visiting the places where Jesus walked.  Many of us will never be able to visit the Holy Land and I thank Stephen Ray for taking us on an incredible journey.Walk along the Jordan River, see the land where Jesus lived and taught.  Go with him to Jerusalem and walk the Way of the Cross.  Visit the many beautiful churches built on the holy places like the Transfiguration, Ascension, Birth of Jesus and more.I learned a lot watching this documentary and the others in the series, and I plan on viewing them a second time to really soak in everything.  There is so much information, and they make scripture come alive!  Hearing the readings at Mass I feel I now better understand what is being read.",5,Walk Where Jesus Walked,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1028,"['Jesus', 'Word', 'Became', 'Flesh', 'one', 'ten', 'Footprints', 'God', 'series', 'created', 'Stephen', 'Ray', 'Seven', 'are', 'available', 'time', 'series', 'scheduled', 'be', 'completed', '2010', 'DVD', 'exciting', 'informative.This', 'DVD', 'life', 'Jesus', 'What', 'blessing', 'feel', 'are', 'actually', 'visiting', 'places', 'where', 'Jesus', 'walked', 'Many', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'visit', 'Holy', 'Land', 'thank', 'Stephen', 'Ray', 'taking', 'incredible', 'journey.Walk', 'Jordan', 'River', 'see', 'land', 'where', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'taught', 'Go', 'Jerusalem', 'walk', 'Way', 'Cross', 'Visit', 'many', 'beautiful', 'churches', 'built', 'holy', 'places', 'Transfiguration', 'Ascension', 'Birth', 'Jesus', 'more.I', 'learned', 'lot', 'watching', 'documentary', 'others', 'series', 'plan', 'viewing', 'second', 'time', 'really', 'soak', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'make', 'scripture', 'come', 'alive', 'Hearing', 'readings', 'Mass', 'feel', 'now', 'better', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'read']",Jesus: The Word Became Flesh
