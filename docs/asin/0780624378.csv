I found it especially moving to see this small-sized guy looking so tiny amid the hordes of fans  crowding around him, and I admire his bravery more at having allowed  himself, an intensely private person, to become &quot;public&quot; for the  sake of the New Orleans jazz he loves. The interaction with Previn is  especially surprising, since the media portrays her as a silent figure. My  favorite detail was that his Oscar award statues sit like so many  knick-knacks on his parents' upper shelf. If only the directors who live in  Hollywood were as down to earth as Allen. Made me realize the difference  between the Hollywood crowd and directors who chose to live outside the  cocoon. Allen jokes about himself as a &quot;scumbag&quot; at one point,  feeling like a real outsider amid opulence. This is a touching, interesting  film, and the music is very charming. I also loved the fact that when he  makes a witty side comment, his companions are clearly so used to it that  they barely notice any more that he is constantly making sly wisecracks.",5,Inside Look at a Genius Filmmaker,952646400,"03 10, 2000",2000,1174,"['Having', 'long', 'enjoyed', 'Allen', 'films', 'was', 'fascinated', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'what', 'human', 'being', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'found', 'especially', 'moving', 'see', 'small-sized', 'guy', 'looking', 'so', 'tiny', 'hordes', 'fans', 'crowding', 'admire', 'bravery', 'more', 'having', 'allowed', 'intensely', 'private', 'person', 'become', 'quot', 'public', 'quot', 'sake', 'New', 'Orleans', 'jazz', 'interaction', 'Previn', 'especially', 'surprising', 'media', 'silent', 'figure', 'favorite', 'detail', 'was', 'Oscar', 'award', 'sit', 'so', 'many', 'knick-knacks', 'parents', 'upper', 'shelf', 'only', 'directors', 'who', 'live', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'as', 'down', 'earth', 'Allen', 'Made', 'realize', 'difference', 'Hollywood', 'crowd', 'directors', 'who', 'chose', 'live', 'cocoon', 'Allen', 'jokes', 'about', 'quot', 'quot', 'one', 'point', 'feeling', 'real', 'outsider', 'opulence', 'touching', 'interesting', 'film', 'music', 'very', 'charming', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'when', 'witty', 'side', 'comment', 'companions', 'are', 'clearly', 'so', 'used', 'barely', 'notice', 'more', 'constantly', 'making', 'sly', 'wisecracks']",N/A

33678,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,0780624378,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[6, 9]","In all honesty, I found this film only MILDLY amusing because of the ""voyeuristic"" pleasure of getting to see Woody Allen ""off camera"" - - but let's face it, a documentary crew was following the guy around... so when you see him and Soon Yi chatting away in their robes in the privacy of their hotel room, do you really believe they're alone and unwatched and not trying to ACT as they want to be perceived...? So the question is, who was doing the acting ?  Based on the fact that both came across as rather dull and uninteresting and I'm sure like many viewers I spent most of the film sitting (unfairly) on the edge of my seat waiting for Woody Allen to say something funny or be more neurotic my answer would be either neither or both, and perhaps the film was merely made to simple counter the bad image of Woody Allen that were going around at the time.  - - ""Wild man, my tookus !"" the viewer is expected to say.  - - If the film were to be compared to CRUMB (which I found delightfully entertaining, if not dark and depressing beneath its hillarity at times), in terms of interest it would be like comparing SPEED to MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.All in all, there ARE a lot of interesting and enlightening moments to the film... especially as Woody gets burnt out and testy, winds up with a cold at the end of his tour and you finally get to meet his parents who seem genuinely (if not sardonically) disappointed in him - - and him delightful at showing it off to the public.  Wittness though how Soon Yi stands by graciously as she is virtiously (yet in more polite words) called a shikseh.  - - If Woody Allen's mom mellowed with age, as sharp and nasty as she appears in that seen, one could have only imagined the poor guy as a child.As for the film itself... the words dry yet quirky would be ideal... Who could ever imagine that the hippest film maker in the world could be so... moderately normal and unhip ?All in all, I'm happy the film was made, but its like one of those New Yorker magazine pieces... interesting, well crafted and in the moment, yet somewhat bland despite occasional moments of insight...However, if you ever were curious what Woody Allen is like ""off camera"", this on camera portrayal of him off camera might answer that question... though I still don't see what he saw in Soon Yi Previn who (atleast in the film) does not come across as a really mind stimulating heavyweight (I guess that's because she's supposed to be the ego to the id ???)All in all, this is the type of film that if you're curious about Woody Allen, its something worth watching, but its not something a non-fan could watch and suddenly find himself wanting to go out and watch every Woody Allen ever made.  Such a person would probably wonder, ""Why would anybody be interested in that SCHLUB...???"" and I can answer, because he's a genius and the fact is don't blame him... this is one film he didn't direct ! ! !",3,Dry yet Quirky...,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,2915,"['honesty', 'found', 'film', 'only', 'MILDLY', 'amusing', 'voyeuristic', 'pleasure', 'getting', 'see', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'camera', 'let', 'face', 'documentary', 'crew', 'was', 'following', 'guy', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'Soon', 'Yi', 'chatting', 'away', 'robes', 'privacy', 'hotel', 'room', 'do', 'really', 'believe', ""'re"", 'alone', 'unwatched', 'not', 'trying', 'ACT', 'want', 'be', 'perceived', 'question', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'acting', 'Based', 'fact', 'came', 'rather', 'dull', 'uninteresting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'viewers', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'sitting', 'unfairly', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'say', 'something', 'funny', 'be', 'more', 'neurotic', 'answer', 'would', 'be', 'perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'merely', 'made', 'simple', 'counter', 'bad', 'image', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'were', 'going', 'around', 'time', 'Wild', 'man', 'tookus', 'viewer', 'expected', 'say', 'film', 'were', 'be', 'compared', 'CRUMB', 'found', 'delightfully', 'entertaining', 'not', 'dark', 'depressing', 'beneath', 'hillarity', 'times', 'terms', 'interest', 'would', 'be', 'comparing', 'SPEED', 'MY', 'DINNER', 'WITH', 'ANDRE.All', 'ARE', 'lot', 'interesting', 'enlightening', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', 'Woody', 'burnt', 'out', 'testy', 'up', 'cold', 'end', 'tour', 'finally', 'get', 'meet', 'parents', 'who', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'not', 'sardonically', 'disappointed', 'delightful', 'showing', 'public', 'Wittness', 'how', 'Soon', 'Yi', 'graciously', 'virtiously', 'yet', 'more', 'polite', 'words', 'called', 'shikseh', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'mom', 'mellowed', 'age', 'sharp', 'nasty', 'seen', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'imagined', 'poor', 'guy', 'child.As', 'film', 'words', 'dry', 'yet', 'quirky', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'Who', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'hippest', 'film', 'maker', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'moderately', 'normal', 'unhip', ""'m"", 'happy', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'pieces', 'interesting', 'well', 'crafted', 'moment', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'occasional', 'moments', 'insight', 'However', 'ever', 'were', 'curious', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'camera', 'camera', 'portrayal', 'off', 'camera', 'might', 'answer', 'question', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'saw', 'Soon', 'Yi', 'Previn', 'who', 'atleast', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'really', 'mind', 'stimulating', 'heavyweight', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'ego', 'id', 'type', 'film', ""'re"", 'curious', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'something', 'non-fan', 'could', 'watch', 'suddenly', 'find', 'wanting', 'go', 'out', 'watch', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'ever', 'made', 'person', 'would', 'probably', 'wonder', 'Why', 'would', 'anybody', 'be', 'interested', 'SCHLUB', 'can', 'answer', 'genius', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'one', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct']",N/A

33681,AVNFGFRFPAFK4,0780624378,"Myrna Minkoff ""Myrna""","[4, 6]","First of all let me say that I do not, in any way, hold Barbara Koppel culpable for this dismal film.  Koppel is, of course, the filmmaker responsible for the riveting, Oscar-winning documentary, Harlan County USA.  That project occupied several years during which she and her crew were deeply engaged, along with the principals, in a prolonged and powerful, real-life drama.Any documentary filmmaker would jump at a chance to penetrate the veil surrounding the life of Woody Allen.  But it was obviously a highly constrained opportunity; she had two weeks to film, with who knows what specific limitations, and a painfully thin, predetermined ""dramatic line"" of Woody Allen --uncomfortable and mildly peevish -- joining with some more accomplished Dixeland musicians to present a handful of concerts to his adoring, European, movie fans.  Koppel had little to work with; you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.Perhaps half the film was specifically centered on the concerts, the band actually making music and the hoopla immediately surrounding the performances.  The music seemed lifeless to me, although perhaps it would have been better if the sound recording had been less improvised.  We saw more than enough of the ""green room"" moments, the entrances and exits, the little interactions with the crowd, etc.The other half of the film consisted mostly of the banal conversation and trivialities of travel, staying in hotels, avoiding fans, etc.  One eternal question about Woody is how much does he actually resemble his on-screen characters from his films in the period from Annie Hall through Crimes and Misdemeanors.  I've read a good deal about him and had bought into the view that he was less of a nerd in real life than in those films.  One striking fact about his life, for example, is that he was quite a good athlete as a young man, something that seems to rub against his physically awkward characters.  OTOH, there is the copious testimony from Mia Farrow (not exactly an unbiased source) that Woody has many quirky -- even anti-social -- ways that are, in fact, highly consistent with those characters.  There is the fact, for example, that he is neurotically attached to NYC and makes a big deal of the stress he is caused by even a couple of days in the country.To the extent that Woody revealed his true self in this film, I would say that his on-screen persona actually understates what a creep he is.  Oh, gosh!  I let a quite nasty word slip in there. I am a great fan of Woody's movies, and I embrace his neurotic, on-screen alter-egos.  But I found seeing it in supposed real life to be much, much less appealing.  He was never harsh or arrogantly demanding, as stars can be sometimes; he was just peevish and tediously fretting about things and generally joyless.  Most of all, he was banal.  We all know that Woody has a lot on his mind, but you wouldn't know it by what is revealed in this film.  And this brings me to the topic of Soon-Yi.There is not much to be said about Soon-Yi other than that she must be one of the most vacuous characters ever captured on video.  And who can watch her and Woody together without reflecting on that whole thing.  I'd like to correct one reviewer who I don't think made clear that Soon-Yi was Mia's adopted child and Woody was never her stepfather, which gets into the whole, extremely weird and selfish way he had of relating, or not relating, to Mia's children.  I think that fairness requires the acknowledgment that he never had a parental relationship to Soon-Yi and, therefore, what he did was not incestuous.  It was just extremely creepy, especially that he was taking highly pornographic photos of her and left them around for Mia to find.  Forgive me for putting in all this background, but it seemed necessary to explain my reaction in seeing Soon-Yi in the film. I had let it all go, I thought, some years ago. But seeing her in this film reinforced my negative reaction to all of that and the sense that Woody is a neurotic bordering on being an authentic pervert, a role he rehearsed in Manhattan and played again, more tastefully, in Husbands and Wives. (I love those two films...it is a shame, though, that his sexual impulses toward inappropriately young females were not confined to artistic expression.)  Soon-Yi, as I more or less said, is an uninteresting, seemingly-unintelligent, weirdly-out-of-place, companion-toy for Woody.  (For those who will say, ""Don't judge,"" I say, ""To heck with you. I observe, I reflect, I review, I judge...get over it.""  People who don't want to be judged should not travel with a film crew.)The only really engaging few minutes of the film was Woody with his parents at the end.  Let me just say, ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.""  My purpose in watching this film was not to be amused in the usual movie-watching way, but to gain a little more insight into Woody's character.  Seeing his parents was worth a lot.  And, in fact, that little bit was quite amusing, although it must be said that Woody was playing to the camera as if to say, ""Look at this!  See.  Now do you understand?""  (Unfortunately, there were other times in the film when Woody was also playing to the camera.)Given my interest in Woody, I have no regrets in spending the lavish sum of thirty bucks on this thing. But judged as a film for general audiences -- even general audiences at an art house -- it it a pretty lame, two-star film, IMO.",2,"Lousy film, tedious people...not to be missed by the

33682,A2BSVGJZKD9TLX,0780624378,Nate Goyer,"[9, 14]","I really like Woody Allen and it's still kinda cool seeing one of my favorite filmmakers playing my favorite instrument (the clarinet) in my favorite musical style of 1940's-New Orleans-period Jazz. There's no doubt  that Woody Allen has talent for filmmaking, but we've heard little about  his musical talents until now. Unfortunately, &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot;  doesn't satisfy as a documentary or a Woody Allen film, but a voyeuristic  view of a pretty unglamorous 2-week tour.&quot;Wild Man Blues&quot;  shows Woody go through a European tour with his Jazz band, stopping in  major cities like Paris, Milan, Madrid, Bologna &amp; London. His  performances are to large crowds of 1,000 or more people, and it turns into  an event that is obviously uncomfortable for the notoriously recluse  filmmaker. We get a pale &quot;behind the scenes&quot; view of Woody in  real life, which personally reminded me of the MTV Real World method: Film  everything and keep the most interesting parts, which are few &amp; far  between. As the movie progresses, Woody gets comfortable enough for the  ever-present camera to start making some of his trademark quips about  anomalies in general; broken light switches, forgotten breakfast items,  etc. This wears off some of the effect, since it seems we are not watching  a good documentary, but a film with inconsistent dialogue.I personally  would rather have a movie of an entire performance of the Jazz band, rather  than a tour of fine hotel rooms, backstage areas and curious crowds,  interspersed with a few minutes of performances. The film seemed to focus  on Woody &amp; Soon-Yi, while pretty much neglecting the rest of the band.  Interesting comparisons were left un-addressed: Sure, Woody and Soon-Yi  stay in 5 star hotels, but where does the band stay? How do they feel about  their musical performances often being overshadowed by his celebrity? Woody  gets a private plane, but no other musicians seem to fly with him? That  would have been much more interesting that spending 5 minutes of film being  spent on a broken shower.The one surprise of the film is the revealing  of the roles of Woody &amp; Soon-Yi in their relationship. I was not  expecting this, but I definitely came away thinking that they interact  quite well as a couple. But once again, I love Woody Allen films, but am  pretty uninterested in his personal life.I've seen Woody Allen &amp; his  Jazz band live in NYC, and that was a huge treat unto itself.

33683,AY8WZDYR79GFV,0780624378,Yasha Banana,"[0, 7]","While this is, technically, an adequate-to-good documentary (Barbara Kopple always does technically proficient work) -- as for its *truthfulness* about the characters involved, specifically, Woody and his now-wife Soon Yi, it's an excellent example of Woody Allen's ongoing manipulation of the media.Consider this: It's the late 1990s, Woody Allen is in a world of trouble over his affair with a young, underage girl, Soon-Yi, who at one time was the adopted child of Woody's common law wife, Mia Farrow.  He was also accused by Mia Farrow of molesting one of her other children.  So what does Woody do?  By mutual consent, he and Barbara Kopple agree to do a documentary about him and Soon-Yi.Kopple could hardly refuse.More than that, she goes ga-ga over her subject, throwing out all critical thinking regarding who it is she's documenting.Disappointingly, her ""documentary"" turns out to be a portrait Woody and Soon-Yi as just a couple of sweet, lovable kids.  Albeit, one kid is a teenager, the other in his 50s.Probably the only meaningful account of Woody Allen's life is Marion Meade's 2000 biography, ""The Unruly Life of Woody Allen; A Biography.""  What emerges from Meade's biography is the portrait of a man far, FAR different from what ""Wild Man Blues"" suggests.Meade's book shows Allen to be a deeply distrubed, highly neurotic and, at times, remarkably insensitive, uncaring person.  By contrast, Kopple's documentary is very much what Woody Allen would like the public to buy.Even *Kopple's* version of Woody Allen is distressing.  What we see is a manipulative, self-centered, self-absorbed narcissist.  And those are his good points. (Ba-da-bing-bing!)If Woody Allen were a great artist -- something he's been mainpulating the media into selling to the public for quite some time now -- *if* he were a great artist, some might forgive his unforgiveable selfishness.  But, alas, Woody Allen's filmmaking skills -- praised as they are by the same social types (read: intellectual phonies) he both sadistically roasts and, at the same time, unfailingly reminds one of -- have dissipated greatly, given the movies he's made in the past 15 years.Simply put: his films are embarrassing.He's a ""remarkable filmmaker"" only within the context of a culture of narcissism.  He's a spokesman-philosopher for Narcisssim Inc., a thriving enterprise that has grown in tandem with his career as a filmmaker and  (ahem!) social philosopher.Then there's his deep and abiding conviction that he's God's gift to womanhood.  Consider ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" in which he plays a detective who is romantically involved with a woman (Helen Hunt) who is less than half his age.  (A numerical ""step up"" from the real-life disparity between himself and Soon-Yi.)And not for laughs does he create this age disparity.  He  evidently believes that, at his age, all these young woman are falling head-over-heels in love with him.  In short (no pun intended): he's irresistible and he can prove it!Indeed, he he does this Romeo bit in several of his movies.In ""Celebrity,"" a film Allen doesn't appear in, Kenneth Branaugh, the outstanding Shakespearean actor, portrays his character throughout the movie *imitating* Woody Allen!  The same for John Cusack in ""Bullets Over Broadway"" and Michael Caine in ""Hannah and Her Sisters.""  One imagines Allen the director saying to these actors: ""Here, see, look at me.  Are you looking?  Keep looking.  Wath ME carefully.  Ok, now you try it."")In short (no pun intended again): his ego is that of Olympian proportions.Put another way: He is perhaps not Clark Gable.Alas, where does Woody Allen's fantasy life end and reality begin?  Evidently, it doesn't.  In ""Woody's World,"" the only requirement is that he, alone, has to live in it.Woody Allen's success reminds me of a line from, of all things, a review of Vanna White's autobiography, which came out about 20 years ago.  Quoting the reviewer from memory: ""Her (Vanna's) hotel of self-esteem is only half full, in that even she can't figure out why she's so successful."" ... This goes a long way to explaining Woody Allen's success as well.It's a shame an accomplished fimmaker such as Barbara Kopple wasted her time on such a shallow talent, and an even shallower individual.  What happened, Ms. Kopple, to the social commitment you showed in 1977 when you did your seminal documentary, ""Harlan County USA""?
