1016644,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000HWZ4AW,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","This  season marks the departure of one of my cast favorites, Julianna Margulies as Nurse Manager of the ER. It is the second departure from the original cast, and it marks the beginning of a turnover in the next few seasons, but this season is still shining with all its original members, except George Clooney (who actually seemed out of place in some ways). But we get the addition of Luka Kovac, a Croatian attending, who makes a very nice replacement of Clooney as a ladies' man.Heading the list of attractions is several terrific story arcs. The first is the three episode appearance of Alan Alda as a new hire as chief of the ER. At first, it is clear he is expert, if a bit old fashioned. He plays the role quite differently from his Hawkeye Pierce persona. (I almost missed the Hawkeye humor. Would it have been really so bad to name him &#34;Pierce&#34;) I won't spoil the reason he left after 3 episodes. Far more tense is a story arc featuring &#34;Numb3rs&#34; star, David Krumholtz, as a psychotic patient. The events of his stay change the direction of the show for over a season.Hospital politics plays a big part early in the season, which makes Paul McCrane's role more important, as the doctor everyone loves to hate. I can say with some safety that following seasons sustain the overall quality, but none seem to reach the heights of this season, especially with other guest stars, John Cullum and Francis Sternhagen, whose parts wind down after this season.If you happen to see this review before you buy any ER season, this is the one to try if you just want to sample the show.",5,I seem to follow the crowd.

1016648,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000HWZ4AW,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[8, 12]","Cook County General could easily have been confused with O'Hare Airport with all the arrivals and departures in this, the sixth season of NBC's long-running award-winning drama, ER.The comings and goings of main characters highlighted a very strong season of ER, one that created a number of storylines for years to come and introduced us to characters who are still on the show to this day.Perhaps the most shocking departure was that of med student Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin at her most adorable). Lucy and Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) were attacked by a crazed patient and left to die on the floor of a hospital room as the rest of the staff celebrated with a Valentine's Day party. The patient, Paul Sobricki (guest star David Krumholz) stabbed both Carter and Lucy and left the hospital, only to be found later after a traffic accident. While Carter lived through the ordeal, he came out on the other side in pretty rough shape. He returned to work too early and became addicted to painkillers, which led to his entrance in rehab as the season came to a close. For Lucy, the ending wasn't as positive, as she died despite the heroic efforts of the entire hospital staff. Her death ended a year-and-a-half arc as a med student on the show.A departure that wasn't nearly as shocking, and was actually expected, was that of nurse Carol Hathaway (Jullanna Margulies). As the season began, Carol is pregnant with twins and midway through the season delivers Kate and Tess. She soldiers on as a single parent, but her mind wanders to Seattle, where the father of her babies, former County General doctor Doug Ross (former ER star George Clooney) now resides. In the season's penultimate episode, Carol packs up and heads to the West Coast into Doug's arms. Clooney's appearance was a surprise to anyone watching the show, but it was the good kind of surprise.Another departure came early in the season, as PA Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) became an adoptive parent and left the ER to be a full-time Mom. Jeannie's HIV status and her relationship with cop Reggie (guest star Cress Williams) played a primary role in her early season story line. As I have mentioned in earlier reviews of other seasons, Jeannie was my least favorite ER character ever and I was not terribly disappointed to see her go.One other departure of note was the passing of Dr. Mark Greene's (Anthony Edwards) father, David (guest star John Cullum). Throughout the season, Mark was dealing with his father's health issues and they all came to a head when lung cancer is the culprit. The two spend some quality time together in Chicago before the elder Greene passes away. In my mind, Cullum did a fantastic job in this role, really squeezing life out of a man who was on death's doorstep.Greene, in addition to dealing with his father's health issues, had a full plate in season Six. First he is ambushed by Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) as Dr. Robert Romano (new series regular Paul McCrane) is named as thenew boss and Weaver is put in charge of the ER. However, his relationship with surgeon Elizabeth Korday (Alex Kingston) serves as a bright spot for Dr. Greene, who has seen his share of tough luck in the first five seasons. The relationship would eventually produce a child and marriage in later seasons.While Romano is new to the cast, he is not new to the show, as he was a recurring character in early seasons. However, he is not the only former recurring character to show up in the show's main credits during this season. Jing-Mei Chen (Ming-Na), formerly Deb Chen, returns to County General. She appeared in earlier seasons as a med student, but after having problems with a program elsewhere, returns to her old stopping grounds. She provides good competition for Dr. Carter when she does return.Another new face in the ER is that of Dr. Cleo Finch (Michael Michele), the new pediatrician. Dr. Finch enters into a relationship with surgeon Peter Benton (Eriq laSalle), who is still dealing with his new son's deafness. Dr. Finch doesn't have many central roles in her first season, but her relationship with Benton is one of them. Benton continues to work on his trauma fellowship, much to the dismay of Dr. Romano. It is also Benton, one of Carter's biggest mentors, who convinces the young doctor to get on the plane to rehab at the end of the season. Benton even gets on the plane with him.Dr. Dave Mallucci (Erik Palladino) also joined the staff midway through the season. Mallucci is the typical young hot-shot who believes he has all the answers. In actuality, Mallucci has a lot to learn and gets a tough lesson when he signs off on a patient without seeing her and she has to be readmitted. His knowledge of car parts also comes in handy when Dr. Weaver's car breaks down.But, the two new faces that have stuck around the longest are those of Dr. Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic) and med student (then nurse, then Dr.) Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney). Kovac begins the season as a fill-in doctor, taking shifts when other doctors are on vacation. But when Weaver's new attending Gabe Lawrence (a great guest starring role for television veteran Alan Alda) develops medical issues, Kovac is offered full time status and signs on. The Croatian hides many personal secrets, but his feelings for Carol Hathaway are quite obvious. Kovac has turned into one of my favorite characters on the show, so it was interesting going back to where he began.Abby entered the scene first as a guest star when she was an OB nurse helping Carol through her pregnancy. However, she picked back up her med school studies and ends up in the ER. Watching a young and nervous Abby is quite a change from the hardened ER veteran that is on television each Thursday night in the 13th season, but Tierney does a great job of portraying the nervousness that any med student might have.Dr. Weaver is put in charge of the ER and makes a number of changes that don't always float well, including hiring her mentor, Dr. Lawrence. Her management style was very abrupt in the early going, but as the years wore on, she became a much more likable character.The six-disc set includes additional scenes for many episodes, as well as a gag reel.With all the comings and goings, season six of ER was a roller coaster ride of emotions, but a roller coaster ride that you want to take over and over again.",5,I can't believe they killed

1016657,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000HWZ4AW,Sean Pasek,"[21, 22]","ER has had several memorable episodes over the course of its first five seasons.  We saw Mark Greene attempt to deliver a baby in Season 1 that cost the life of the mother.  We had Doug Ross in Season 2 courageously saves a boy trapped in a storm drain.  And yet, as powerful as those episodes were, even they pale in comparison to Season 6's ""All in the Family.""Before I comment on that episode, we see some new additions to the cast of ER.  Goran Visnijic debuts as Dr. Kovac.  I liked him much better in these earlier seasons before they made him a carbon copy of Doug Ross when he was a womanizer.Michael Michele comes aboard as Dr. Cleo Finch, the new Attending Pediatric physician.  Finch is a good doctor who really cares about her patients, and Michele does a great job of demonstrating this.Erik Palladino is a new, young ER resident, Dr. Dave Malucci.  Malucci is the gung-ho doctor who doesn't have much of a bedside manner, but who is over-eager for the most difficult cases.  Malucci's impulsiveness tends to land him in hot water, especially with Dr. Weaver.Ming-Na also makes her return here as Dr. ""Deb"" Chen.  I really liked her in Season 1 of ER, and I was thrilled when she came back.  She was always a good counterpart for Carter, as the two always seemed to be in competition with each other.Season 6 also has the first appearance of Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) who is doing a rotation as an OBGYN nurse before beginning her rotation down in the ER.Season 6 also has one of the great guest appearances by Alan Alda playing Dr. Gabriel Lawrence.  Dr. Lawrence was the doctor who trained Kerry Weaver, and when a medical condition arises in Dr. Lawrence, Weaver has a difficult time facing her mentor and friend.  There is a great scene between these two characters during his final appearance that is touching.The season is a good one, and the acting talents of Noah Wyle are really put to the test, especially in the episodes that follow after ""All in the Family"" when Carter tries to deal with his guilt as well as the trauma that he suffers.  Wyle was always a strong actor and played Carter with an almost innocent quality.  Perhaps this is truly the first time that we see Carter with a loss of that innocence.This season also sees the exit of the third member of the original cast.  One of the small problems in this season is that, at times, you have too many cast members and too little screen time.  At one point, there are twelve regular cast members during the course of this season.  There simply isn't enough time to really showcase them all, especially the new additions to the cast.SPOILER ALERT BELOWNow, on to the episode of ""All in the Family.""  I still recall vividly the first time I saw this episode when it aired.  It was unlike anything I'd seen on television before.  It was so powerful and poignant, that even seeing it again moves me inexplicably.Dr. Carter and Lucy Knight have just been brutally stabbed by a psych patient.  This occurs at the very end of the previous episode.  So, imagine waiting an entire week to find out what happens next!  This was one of the biggest cliff-hangers that I can remember, and everyone made sure they were available to watch this episode to find out what was going to happen to Carter and Lucy.  Very few people foresaw what transpired.The entire ER springs to action when Dr. Weaver discovers them on the floor in the trauma room lying in pools of blood.  There's nothing like a team coming together for a single purpose, especially when that purpose is dire.  There is something especially powerful in such actions.Benton is nearly out of control when he discovers that Carter has been injured.  Perhaps for the first time in the series, we really see and understand how the usually emotionally cold Dr. Benton feels about Carter.  It's on his face and in his actions.  As Benton tries to assure Carter that he will be all right, Carter says in a cracking voice, ""I'm glad it's you,"" when he realizes that Benton is going to operate on him.Equally strong is Dr. Corday and Dr. Romano working feverishly to save Lucy's life.  Dr. Romano, who seems to care about no one at all, can't even hide his anger, frustration, and grief when it's clear that Lucy can't be saved.  In many ways, Romano is the doctor who speaks for the audience.  Seeing this episode for the first time, it was unbelievable that Lucy was dead.  It wasn't often that a major character was killed in an on-going series, and so Romano expresses his anger and disbelief for us, and he does it well as he sends surgical instruments flying across the room.Just when you think that ER can no longer surprise you, they came up with this episode.  Word has it that Kellie Martin no longer felt comfortable being on the show as her own real-life sister was a traumatic victim of lupus.You have to credit the writers for coming up with this episode.  Very few, if any, characters up to this point in television history have had such a powerful and heart-wrenching exit as Kellie's character here on ER.  I recall the following Friday everyone talking about it.There have been previous events in ER that were terrific episodes, and there were even a couple more that would follow after Season 6, but ""All in the Family"" is still the premiere ER episode that truly defines the pinnacle of a great drama series.",5,Most Gripping Episode of ER Is Here In Season 6,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,5355,"['ER',
