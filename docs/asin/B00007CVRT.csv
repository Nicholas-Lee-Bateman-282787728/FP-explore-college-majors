Poitier gives a very fine performance, as does Gerr and the rest of the cast. The cinematography (note creative use of light and grainy closeups) and soundtrack (hip Quincy Jones) is excellent (if a bit early 70's dated). Brother John may be an enigmatic character, but the plot is not so subtle in it's look at racism, war, worker and big industry relations, modern humanity and a wide range of human relationships.In many ways this plays as an allegory of Jesus Christ's life, but it is also more. By the end I thought he was more John The Revelator than Christ. But he is also more wise, restrained and dispassionate than those traditional Christian characters. He is more like Christ as the Taoist sage witnessing and absorbing the world without resistance or judgment.While the plot is clearly allegorical, with an axe to grind about social injustices, the beauty is that it makes you want to think and examine on your own. And simply live in the moment.",5,Watch this movie before you read these reviews....,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1097,"['great', 'movie', 'one', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'read', 'reviews', 'give', 'explanation', 'what', 'think', 'Poitier', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'Gerr', 'rest', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'note', 'creative', 'use', 'light', 'grainy', 'closeups', 'soundtrack', 'hip', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'excellent', 'bit', 'early', '70', 'dated', 'Brother', 'John', 'may', 'be', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'look', 'racism', 'war', 'worker', 'big', 'industry', 'relations', 'modern', 'humanity', 'wide', 'range', 'human', 'relationships.In', 'many', 'ways', 'allegory', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'life', 'also', 'more', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'John', 'Revelator', 'Christ', 'also', 'more', 'wise', 'restrained', 'dispassionate', 'traditional', 'Christian', 'characters', 'more', 'like', 'Christ', 'Taoist', 'sage', 'witnessing', 'absorbing', 'world', 'resistance', 'judgment.While', 'plot', 'clearly', 'allegorical', 'axe', 'grind', 'social', 'injustices', 'beauty', 'want', 'think', 'examine', 'own', 'simply', 'live', 'moment']",N/A

It's the same Poitier and his character is played in typical Poitier fashion, same voice, same looks, same gestures. But who, or maybe more to the point, what, is Brother John? He has been away traveling the world for many years and the movie begins with him mysteriously turning up in his hometown upon the death of his sister, just as he did years before at the death of his parents. It is not known how he knew that she had died. He seems to have other strange knowledge as well, about people and life. His calm observing demeanor and always slightly sad expression suggest that he's not telling all the secrets he knows. A police officer and a rival for a local woman try to beat him up and are handled as easily as a black belt handling a beer-bellied bubba. His responses to some of the casual questions put to him by townsfolk and the few elements of his back story that are revealed only add to the deep mystery and almost Christ-like aura that builds around him. In the end he disappears and you're left wondering not only who he was but what his true message and mission were.",5,Strangely Fascinating,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1151,"['Brother', 'John', 'surely', 'one', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'odder', 'characters', 'same', 'Poitier', 'character', 'played', 'typical', 'Poitier', 'fashion', 'same', 'voice', 'same', 'looks', 'same', 'gestures', 'who', 'maybe', 'more', 'point', 'what', 'Brother', 'John', 'been', 'away', 'traveling', 'world', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'mysteriously', 'turning', 'up', 'hometown', 'death', 'sister', 'just', 'did', 'years', 'death', 'parents', 'not', 'known', 'how', 'knew', 'had', 'died', 'have', 'other', 'strange', 'knowledge', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'life', 'calm', 'observing', 'demeanor', 'always', 'slightly', 'sad', 'expression', 'suggest', 'not', 'telling', 'secrets', 'police', 'officer', 'rival', 'local', 'woman', 'try', 'beat', 'up', 'are', 'handled', 'as', 'easily', 'black', 'belt', 'handling', 'beer-bellied', 'bubba', 'responses', 'casual', 'questions', 'put', 'townsfolk', 'few', 'elements', 'back', 'story', 'are', 'revealed', 'only', 'add', 'deep', 'mystery', 'almost', 'Christ-like', 'aura', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'true', 'message', 'mission', 'were']",N/A

People were leaping to the stars because they knew where salvation was. They made it. Each death he came to he knew because he was the death angel. The scene where the factories was about the pollution here on the earth. Man is killing himself and the words of the end we all should remember we will not be judged by what we are we will be judged by what we have become on judgement day. The wind is the result of force, a current. The atom in our lives is slow the current created from our movement is quick and powerful. We need to make sure it is a good current.
