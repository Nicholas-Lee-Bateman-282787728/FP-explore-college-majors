983227,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000F50762,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","This isn't merely an inside look at prostitution, it is more on the development of a friendship between two women.  In the streets of Madred,  Caye is disturbed by the influx of competing prostitutes from other countries, and she meets a rival prostitute, Zulema, from Dominican Republic.  We soon learn that Zulema sends money home to her mother and son,  while Caye makes frequent visits to her delusional mother who doesn't believe her husband is dead, and the co-dependent family members.  Almost all Caye's family scenes are at the dinner table and they don't lend much to the film except that the prostitute is more on the normal side, she visits her  family.What you see next is the bond the two have, Caye protecting the other to get back home to her son, and yet, Caye has her own dreams, something simple liked being picked up (taken home) after work by a loved one.At two hours, the film dragged on quite a bit.  And, taking a look at the cover of the DVD, you may get the wrong impression of the film.  It isn't about the beauty and exhilarating life the picture projects.  But yet, it is a not too surprising or shocking look into the prostitute, weird johns, competition, and a dream to take one away from the wretched life.  There is brief frontal nudity, and nothing to bizarre or explicit about the lifestyle moments.Princesas was made in 2005 by Fernando Leon de Aranoa, and for if you like this work, try his 2002Mondays in the Sunwith Javier Bardem about the onset of unemployment amongst dockworkers.

983229,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000F50762,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[28, 29]","Two young prostitutes have a chance encounter in the streets of Spain.  The sensitive and intense Caye (Candela Pe&ntilde;a) finds Zule (Michaela Nev&aacute;rez), an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, in the process of stealing her customer for less money.  The newly arrived Dominican streetwalkers are already a bone of contention for their Spanish counterparts, as competition, as well as the racist stigma associated with their darker-skinned competition.  Yet, Caye and Zule form an unlikely bond when the young Dominican woman is beaten and must be taken to the hospital.  Caye stands by her, in the face of her colleague's pain, not only as a victim of repeated domestic violence, but, as an illegal immigrant.  The trick responsible for leaving her bruised and battered is doing a sick trade with Zule, in order for her to obtain residency papers to legally stay and work in Spain.  Ultimately, her hope is to bring her young son to live with her there.  Meanwhile, Caye has her own set of problems.  Her mother (with whom she lives) refuses to accept that her husband died some three years before, sends flowers and notes to herself and claims they came from her deceased spouse.  The family must play along with the charade to appease to her mother's delusion.PRINCESAS was beautifully written and directed by Fernando Leon de Aranda, and has a gorgeous soundtrack written by the great Manu Chao and Alfonso de Vilallonga.  Shot with a handheld camera, we really get a sense of the urgency and desperation that these two women face, along with their counterparts.  Though, they are part of the oldest profession (prostitution), this is almost an incidental part of the story.  The character development is strong, the writing is engaging and the film is filled with warm, humorous moments, as well as dramatic and painful sequences.  Ultimately, the title is in reference to Caye's dialogue with Zule, about how they have the possibility of being princesses, in spite of all the curve balls, pain and injustice that life throws in their path.  Though, it isn't obvious why both women turn to prostitution, their exchanges give us a glimpse into the fine lines they tread, just to survive in the world.  Perhaps neither of them was ever given a chance in life, nor, the opportunity to realize their potential in other fields in the world.  They are clearly intelligent and able women.  This film truly is poetry set to motion and will make you think.  Drop your preconceived notions and judgments surrounding prostitution before watching PRINCESAS and prepare to be enlightened.  This is one film I highly recommend.",5,"intelligent and sensitive look at ""the oldest profession.....""",1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,2629,"['Two', 'young', 'prostitutes', 'have', 'chance', 'encounter', 'streets', 'Spain', 'sensitive', 'intense', 'Caye', 'Candela', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Zule', 'Michaela', 'Nev', 'aacute', 'rez', 'immigrant', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'process', 'stealing', 'customer', 'less', 'money', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Dominican', 'streetwalkers', 'are', 'already', 'bone', 'contention', 'Spanish', 'counterparts', 'competition', 'as', 'well', 'racist', 'stigma', 'associated', 'darker-skinned', 'competition', 'Caye', 'Zule', 'form', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'when', 'young', 'Dominican', 'woman', 'beaten', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'hospital', 'Caye', 'face', 'colleague', 'pain', 'not', 'only', 'victim', 'repeated', 'domestic', 'violence', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'trick', 'responsible', 'leaving', 'bruised', 'battered', 'doing', 'sick', 'trade', 'Zule', 'order', 'obtain', 'residency', 'papers', 'legally', 'stay', 'work', 'Spain', 'Ultimately', 'hope', 'bring', 'young', 'son', 'live', 'Meanwhile', 'Caye', 'own', 'set', 'problems', 'mother', 'whom', 'accept', 'husband', 'died', 'three', 'years', 'flowers', 'notes', 'herself', 'claims', 'came', 'deceased', 'spouse', 'family', 'must', 'play', 'charade', 'appease', 'mother', 'delusion.PRINCESAS', 'was', 'beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'Fernando', 'Leon', 'Aranda', 'gorgeous', 'soundtrack', 'written', 'great', 'Manu', 'Chao', 'Alfonso', 'de', 'Vilallonga', 'Shot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'urgency', 'desperation', 'two', 'women', 'face', 'counterparts', 'are', 'part', 'oldest', 'profession', 'prostitution', 'almost', 'incidental', 'part', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'strong', 'writing', 'engaging', 'film', 'filled', 'warm', 'humorous', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'painful', 'sequences', 'Ultimately', 'title', 'reference', 'Caye', 'dialogue', 'Zule', 'how', 'have', 'possibility', 'being', 'princesses', 'spite', 'curve', 'balls', 'pain', 'injustice', 'life', 'throws', 'path', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'why', 'women', 'turn', 'prostitution', 'exchanges', 'give', 'glimpse', 'fine', 'lines', 'tread', 'just', 'survive', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'ever', 'given', 'chance', 'life', 'opportunity', 'realize', 'potential', 'other', 'fields', 'world', 'are', 'clearly', 'intelligent', 'able', 'women', 'film', 'truly', 'poetry', 'set', 'motion', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'Drop', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'judgments', 'surrounding', 'prostitution', 'watching', 'PRINCESAS', 'prepare', 'be', 'enlightened', 'one', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
983230,A2FJBJ947VUOGT,B000F50762,giovanni,"[0, 0]","Fernando Leon De Aranoa , director of the critically aclaimed "" Mondays In The Sun ""  , is also the man behind such gems like "" Barrio "" and "" Familia "" ( one of the trickiest , little films about family you'll ever get the chance to see) . His latest offering "" Princesas "" is another slice-of-life film experience , strongly empowered by it's two charismatic leads , Candela Pena and Micaela Nevarez .Caye ( Pena ) is a prostitute working on the streets of Madrid . Seemingly unapologetic about the reasons that led her to this profession , she's a pessimistic creature , weary and doubtful about her chances of happiness . Best time of the day is with other fellow collegues hanging out at a beauty salon a friend owns . Worst time of the day ( or week or month...) is at the family dinner with her mother and brother with whom she has no real communication to speak of . Zulema is a dominican statuesque beauty working too on the streets of the spanish capital , with no papers to feel any security for herself . She has a little boy back in home to whom  she sends most of the money that she earns .Aranoa choses an earthy , unpolished aproach to his material . The girls' grim reality is something the director doesn't shy away from . Still , there is a sweetness in the film - life is a bittersweet mystery afterall .Candela Pena has been a key supporting figure in many great spanish films during the last decade . Here , in one of her few leading roles , she's exceptional , her traumatised gaze displaying all the vulnerability and compation of her struggling character . Along with graceful newcomer Nevarez ,they create one of most believable pair of friends ive ever seen on screen  . Finally , special credit must be given to Manu Chao's music colouring the film - his songs about all the poor lost souls of this earth meet a perfect match with this movie's social sensibilities.",5,Princesses indeed,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,1893,"['Fernando', 'Leon', 'De', 'Aranoa', 'director', 'critically', 'aclaimed', 'Mondays', 'Sun', 'also', 'man', 'such', 'gems', 'Barrio', 'Familia', 'one', 'trickiest', 'little', 'films', 'family', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'latest', 'offering', 'Princesas', 'slice-of-life', 'film', 'experience', 'strongly', 'empowered', 'two', 'charismatic', 'leads', 'Candela', 'Pena', 'Micaela', 'Nevarez', '.Caye', 'Pena', 'prostitute', 'working', 'streets', 'Madrid', 'Seemingly', 'unapologetic', 'reasons', 'led', 'profession', 'pessimistic', 'creature', 'weary', 'doubtful', 'chances', 'happiness', 'Best', 'time', 'day', 'other', 'fellow', 'collegues', 'hanging', 'out', 'beauty', 'salon', 'friend', 'Worst', 'time', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'family', 'dinner', 'mother', 'brother', 'whom', 'real', 'communication', 'speak', 'Zulema', 'dominican', 'statuesque', 'beauty', 'working', 'too', 'streets', 'spanish', 'capital', 'papers', 'feel', 'security', 'herself', 'little', 'boy', 'back', 'home', 'whom', 'most', 'money', '.Aranoa', 'choses', 'earthy', 'unpolished', 'aproach', 'material', 'girls', 'grim', 'reality', 'something', 'director', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'Still', 'sweetness', 'film', 'life', 'bittersweet', 'mystery', 'afterall', '.Candela', 'Pena', 'been', 'key', 'supporting', 'figure', 'many', 'great', 'spanish', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'Here', 'one', 'few', 'leading', 'roles', 'exceptional', 'traumatised', 'gaze', 'displaying', 'vulnerability', 'compation', 'struggling', 'character', 'graceful', 'newcomer', 'Nevarez', 'create', 'one', 'most', 'believable', 'pair', 'friends', 'ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'Finally', 'special', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Manu', 'Chao', 'music', 'colouring', 'film', 'songs', 'poor', 'lost', 'souls', 'earth', 'meet', 'perfect', 'match', 'movie', 'social', 'sensibilities']",N/A
