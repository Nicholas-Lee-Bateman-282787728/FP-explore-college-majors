I did laugh through some of the movie, but it isn't a comedy. I just kept watching one scene over and over, and it doesn't even have Ellen in it. This movie didn't really demonstrate to me how well she can act. If anything it made me feel I should stop watching her films.If you like abstract films you might like this, I'm not really sure. I was lucky this film had that scene or I'd be very angry that I wasted over 30 bucks. I was on the floor laughing; it was so randomly placed in this film. You may have to watch the whole movie to understand why it was so funny.It's when they decide to leave; I don't want to give it away.",3,Wow... just wow.,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,720,"['bought', 'movie', 'love', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'did', 'laugh', 'movie', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'just', 'kept', 'watching', 'one', 'scene', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'Ellen', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'act', 'anything', 'made', 'feel', 'should', 'stop', 'watching', 'films.If', 'abstract', 'films', 'might', 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'was', 'lucky', 'film', 'had', 'scene', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'angry', 'wasted', '30', 'bucks', 'was', 'floor', 'laughing', 'was', 'so', 'randomly', 'placed', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'funny.It', 'when', 'decide', 'leave', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away']",N/A

This loser convinces other homeless people to join his group. Very good acting but the simple concept for a story and an annoying guy that talks weird ruined it a little. It felt depressing to watch so many people being so stupid.

I didn't think it was a mess. I thought the kids lives were a mess but I thought the movie was made very well. It isn't supposed to look like a hollywood glam movie, because its not a hollywood glam story. I thought the lighting/sound/etc...all matched the story it was trying to tell. The movie made me angry, sad, interested, scared, and relieved. It vaguely reminded me of SLC Punk, or Brokedown Palace, or stories along that line. However I wouldn't compare it to them. It is it's own story. It shows you things you don't want to see, it makes you feel emotions you don't want to feel. I would recommend it.",5,See it if you want and don't pay attention to reviews,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,735,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'movie', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'so', 'different', 'personally', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'mess', 'thought', 'kids', 'lives', 'were', 'mess', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'look', 'hollywood', 'glam', 'movie', 'not', 'hollywood', 'glam', 'story', 'thought', 'lighting/sound/etc', 'matched', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'movie', 'made', 'angry', 'sad', 'interested', 'scared', 'relieved', 'vaguely', 'reminded', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'stories', 'line', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'compare', 'own', 'story', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'feel', 'emotions', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A
1024249,A28CZE6LSQ9SL3,B000J2H4YO,ReCynd,"[3, 4]","I'm sucker for street kid/gritty/coming-of-age films.  Sure, I can always HOPE for some cult action, but as my mother used to say, ""wanting ain't getting"", and besides, I'm not usually that greedy.  So how could a movie with all FOUR of these fabulous elements go wrong?  Well, ""Mouth to Mouth"" manages, and the result is a train-wreck, minus the drama.Perhaps it's the acting: sub-par at best (and cringe-worthy at worst).  The biggest offender in this regard was Natasha Wightman (hang your head and hide your face, Natasha!  How could you?), though there wasn't a good performance in the bunch.  But the pacing was just as awful as the acting; I mean, what a DOG.  WOOF.  Was the editor paid by the frame?  Or was it an attempt to be artistic?  Whatever it was supposed to be, the result was really hard to watch.  And the ending--I almost forgot to mention the ending--oh, wait...that's because THERE WAS NO ENDING!The best thing I can say about the movie is that I DID manage to sit through the whole thing (and I can't say that about every horrible movie I've ever seen); it wasn't boring, exactly, and it wasn't all that long at 101 minutes.  How sad is it, though, when this is the highest compliment I can muster?  That I actually managed to endure it?Maybe the movie would appeal to very small slice of the disaffected, suburban, 15-year-old girl-with-a-chip-on-her-shoulder audience.  Thank heavens, that's not me anymore.  However, if that IS you, I'd recommend you skip this one and try ""Thirteen"" instead...it's so much better and (if I recall correctly) it actually has a POINT.",2,Pfft...,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1593,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'street', 'kid/gritty/coming-of-age', 'films', 'Sure', 'can', 'always', 'HOPE', 'cult', 'action', 'mother', 'used', 'say', 'wanting', 'ai', ""n't"", 'getting', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'greedy', 'So', 'how', 'could', 'movie', 'FOUR', 'fabulous', 'elements', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'Mouth', 'Mouth', 'manages', 'result', 'train-wreck', 'drama.Perhaps', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'best', 'cringe-worthy', 'worst', 'biggest', 'offender', 'regard', 'was', 'Natasha', 'Wightman', 'hang', 'head', 'hide', 'face', 'Natasha', 'How', 'could', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'performance', 'bunch', 'pacing', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'awful', 'acting', 'mean', 'what', 'DOG', 'WOOF', 'Was', 'editor', 'paid', 'frame', 'was', 'attempt', 'be', 'artistic', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'result', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'ending', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'ending', 'oh', 'wait', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'NO', 'ENDING', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'DID', 'manage', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'horrible', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'exactly', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', '101', 'minutes', 'How', 'sad', 'though', 'when', 'highest', 'compliment', 'can', 'muster', 'actually', 'managed', 'endure', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'appeal', 'very', 'small', 'slice', 'disaffected', 'suburban', '15-year-old', 'girl-with-a-chip-on-her-shoulder', 'audience', 'Thank', 'heavens', 'not', 'anymore', 'However', 'IS', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'skip', 'one', 'try', 'Thirteen', 'instead', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'recall', 'correctly', 'actually', 'POINT']",N/A
1024250,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B000J2H4YO,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[11, 19]","This film from writer/director Alison Murray is a depressing and altogether predictable morality tale chronicling the attractions and dangers of cult communes for modern youth (together with a warning for parents against seeking to become too involved in the lives of teenage offspring!).  Sadly, however, the film's treatment of an underlying serious topic is every bit as shallow as it is unpleasant. While this production contains some stunning cinematography in places, this is frequently undermined by an over reliance on post-production digital colour treatments that render the image harsh and grainy (I think they were aiming for 'stark and gritty') in a generally unreal and inconsistent manner.  And although it does feature a few genuinely moving scenes, it also contains some that are just downright silly, with acting that is mostly wooden and unconvincing (Ellen Page providing a notable exception). Add to this to a screenplay that is quite frankly a mess and in serious need of good, hard editing, plus a storyline that seems to just have no idea what it wants to do with its life, and the result is a production that is about as much in need of rehabilitation as some of the characters it portrays.There are times when the only redeeming feature of this film is its soundtrack which, ironically, often has more to say than the screenplay; it is largely this, plus Ellen Page's conviction, that made me stay with it to the end and which adds the third star to this review.  I did get one laugh out of this film, though: the commune leader's tag line throughout is ""Intellectual self-defense, without the bull----"".  Oh yeah, right!This DVD edition contains almost nothing by way of bonus materials, just theatrical trailer, plus short (and pointless, uninformative) ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.  This strikes me as an opportunity lost, because if ever there was a film that cried out for some additional commentary from its creator, this must surely be it.
