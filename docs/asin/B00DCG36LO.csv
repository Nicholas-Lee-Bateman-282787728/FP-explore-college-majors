In this world where beauty and youth seem to be what is valued, it was refreshing to see that experience and knowledge are still what makes things work.  Enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.",4,Predictable,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,301,"['was', 'good', 'clean', 'movie', 'Liked', 'had', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'plot', 'did', 'have', 'lesson', 'world', 'where', 'beauty', 'youth', 'seem', 'be', 'what', 'valued', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'experience', 'knowledge', 'are', 'still', 'what', 'things', 'work', 'Enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",All's Fair In Love And Advertising

But,I did not like this movie.Steven Weber,(at 52),with his baggy eyes & ridiculous hair,(which rises up from a widow's peak like a huge M above his head !)would creep out a 30 year old love interest ! Though,Michelle Harrison looked a bit aged herself(for 30) The age difference would have been less creepy & more believable if they they had let her be her actual age in the movie,(which was 39 at the time it premiered).. AND not had her have such fake bright auburn hair that only someone under 25 could pull off!"" The message :"" don't judge a book by it's cover...or how long it's been in print &lt;or even on the shelf> !"" is great, the chemistry, however, just didn't work. As charming as Andrew Francis was as the fake Ad man, his character was shallow, selfish & insincere. His transition from conman to ""yeah I'd let him date my daughter"", was unbelievable & abrupt...(& his invisible eyelashes need some mascara !) I Do applaud Hallmark for presenting some eclectic music as  the score....especially the cello in the coffee shop ! very much an improvement on the usual Hallmark tentative piano music &lt;which unfortunately shows up near the end of the movie>...guess they ran out of $ for the music budget ? overall, it didn't work for me, and I'm in my 50's, so go figure.",3,There's a good reason why buyers are reselling this for so little,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,1665,"['usually', 'never', 'go', 'wrong', 'classic', 'story', 'not', 'exact', 'remake', 'very', 'similar', 'classic', 'Cyrano', 'De', 'Bergerac', 'remade', 'Roxanne', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'etc..', 'someone', 'person', 'pretend', 'be', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'girl', 'love', 'talent', 'persona', 'not', 'person', 'are', 'pretending', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'movie.Steven', 'Weber', '52', 'baggy', 'eyes', 'ridiculous', 'hair', 'up', 'widow', 'peak', 'huge', 'M', 'head', 'would', 'creep', '30', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'interest', 'Though', 'Michelle', 'Harrison', 'looked', 'bit', 'aged', '30', 'age', 'difference', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'creepy', 'more', 'believable', 'had', 'let', 'be', 'actual', 'age', 'movie', 'was', '39', 'time', 'premiered', '..', 'not', 'had', 'have', 'such', 'fake', 'bright', 'auburn', 'hair', 'only', 'someone', '25', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'print', 'lt', 'even', 'shelf', '>', 'great', 'chemistry', 'however', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'As', 'charming', 'Andrew', 'Francis', 'was', 'fake', 'Ad', 'man', 'character', 'was', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'insincere', 'transition', 'conman', 'yeah', ""'d"", 'let', 'date', 'daughter', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'abrupt', 'invisible', 'eyelashes', 'need', 'mascara', 'Do', 'applaud', 'Hallmark', 'presenting', 'eclectic', 'music', 'score', '.especially', 'cello', 'coffee', 'shop', 'very', 'much', 'improvement', 'usual', 'Hallmark', 'tentative', 'piano', 'music', 'lt', 'unfortunately', 'up', 'end', 'movie', '>', 'guess', 'ran', 'music', 'budget', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', ""'m"", '50', 'so', 'go', 'figure']",All's Fair In Love And Advertising
