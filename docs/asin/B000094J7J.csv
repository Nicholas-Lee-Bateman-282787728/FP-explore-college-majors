751908,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B000094J7J,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[3, 5]","In customer reviews there is excessive use of hyperbole and exaggeration when reviewing films. Way, way too many times the phrase ""Worst Film Ever"" or ""worst film I have ever seen"" is casually and capriciously used, even though the latter claim is most likely inaccurate and the first one almost certainly is inaccurate.However, this film may well merit some of the more scathing aspersions. The general premise is not all that bad, although hugely farfetched (a time-traveller goes back in time to stop the JFK assassination). I am a HUGE fan of alternate/counterfactual history (as confirmed by my book buying patterns). I was intrigued by the storyline of this film and had very high hopes for it being an interesting and fascinating movie. Done well, it could have been an intriguing and maybe even a great film. Yet a lack of budget and an ENORMOUS lack of imagination made this a weak community stock theater version of an English composition essay. Besides the very conspicuous lack of even a vague reference to any scientific or sci-fi explanation, Papa Walton shows up in a diver's suit (the old fashioned kind like you see in fish aquariums) in the middle of JFK's supposedly secure hotel suite, then dodderingly proceeds to explain that he went back in time to prevent the assassination (no scientific mumbo-jumbo included).Although the film does make an attempt to present an alternative to what might have been in history (the consequences of JFK's more unethical side catches up with him), mainly it is an embarrassingly bad soliloquy to a time-traveling stalker's love for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. An awkwardly large part of the film was Ralph Waite's character talking about his love for the First Lady (telling her directly), then asking for a slow dance with her as a reward for saving the President's life - I kid you not!The acting was sluggish and palpably uninspired. I was literally embarrassed for the actors at a few points in the film. I swear it is as if the cast was using body language as if to say, ""how did I get talked into this film, and when OH DEAR GOD when will it end?"". Seriously, the actors playing the first couple were listless and seemed to be uncomfortable, although that part is understandable. Ralph Waite's performance or character was just plain creepy and off-putting, combining near-senility with a stalker's eeriness. Even Bruce Campbell (yes, I am a fan), who can generally be counted on to add some energy and interest to a film with his appearances, is both underused and poorly directed.This is way too much like a story written by some marginally skilled Kennedyphile who pines for the days of Camelot, complete with the embellished and exaggerated notions of virtue that were all too often imputed to it. If those who rave about this film can be honest with themselves, the notion that all of America's problems being solved as a result of an unabridged JFK (and later RFK) administration are a little on the ridiculous side, though he no doubt would have made some accomplishments.  Overall, JFK did a good job as President, but this film did not really do him justice as a portrayal.Political leanings aside, you don't have to be a conservative or Republican to dislike this movie, which had an interesting and promising idea but became a weak and lazy result full of poor writing and acting. Do not be mislead by the inaccurate reviews that tell you otherwise. If you want a good film to make you feel good about the Kennedy presidency, watch THIRTEEN DAYS (although too much of that is focused on Kevin Costner's character).",1,remarkable in its lack of imagination and energy,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,3587,"['customer', 'reviews', 'excessive', 'use', 'hyperbole', 'exaggeration', 'when', 'reviewing', 'films', 'Way', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'phrase', 'Worst', 'Film', 'Ever', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'casually', 'capriciously', 'used', 'even', 'latter', 'claim', 'most', 'likely', 'inaccurate', 'first', 'one', 'almost', 'certainly', 'inaccurate.However', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'merit', 'more', 'scathing', 'aspersions', 'general', 'premise', 'not', 'bad', 'hugely', 'farfetched', 'time-traveller', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'alternate/counterfactual', 'history', 'confirmed', 'book', 'buying', 'patterns', 'was', 'intrigued', 'storyline', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'being', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'Done', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'intriguing', 'maybe', 'even', 'great', 'film', 'lack', 'budget', 'ENORMOUS', 'lack', 'imagination', 'made', 'weak', 'community', 'stock', 'theater', 'version', 'English', 'composition', 'essay', 'very', 'conspicuous', 'lack', 'even', 'vague', 'reference', 'scientific', 'sci-fi', 'explanation', 'Papa', 'Walton', 'up', 'diver', 'suit', 'old', 'fashioned', 'kind', 'see', 'fish', 'aquariums', 'middle', 'JFK', 'supposedly', 'secure', 'hotel', 'suite', 'then', 'dodderingly', 'proceeds', 'explain', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'prevent', 'assassination', 'scientific', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'included', 'film', 'make', 'attempt', 'present', 'alternative', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'history', 'consequences', 'JFK', 'more', 'unethical', 'side', 'up', 'mainly', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'soliloquy', 'time-traveling', 'stalker', 'love', 'Jacqueline', 'Bouvier', 'Kennedy', 'awkwardly', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'character', 'talking', 'love', 'First', 'Lady', 'telling', 'directly', 'then', 'asking', 'slow', 'dance', 'reward', 'saving', 'President', 'life', 'kid', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'sluggish', 'palpably', 'uninspired', 'was', 'literally', 'embarrassed', 'actors', 'few', 'points', 'film', 'swear', 'cast', 'was', 'using', 'body', 'language', 'say', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'talked', 'film', 'when', 'OH', 'DEAR', 'GOD', 'when', 'will', 'end', 'Seriously', 'actors', 'playing', 'first', 'couple', 'were', 'listless', 'seemed', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'part', 'understandable', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'performance', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'off-putting', 'combining', 'near-senility', 'stalker', 'eeriness', 'Even', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'yes', 'am', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'generally', 'be', 'counted', 'add', 'energy', 'interest', 'film', 'appearances', 'underused', 'poorly', 'directed.This', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'written', 'marginally', 'skilled', 'Kennedyphile', 'who', 'days', 'Camelot', 'complete', 'embellished', 'exaggerated', 'notions', 'virtue', 'were', 'too', 'often', 'imputed', 'who', 'rave', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'honest', 'notion', 'America', 'problems', 'being', 'solved', 'result', 'unabridged', 'JFK', 'later', 'RFK', 'administration', 'are', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'side', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'accomplishments', 'Overall', 'JFK', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'President', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'portrayal.Political', 'leanings', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'dislike', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'promising', 'idea', 'became', 'weak', 'lazy', 'result', 'full', 'poor', 'writing', 'acting', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'mislead', 'inaccurate', 'reviews', 'tell', 'otherwise', 'want', 'good', 'film', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'Kennedy', 'presidency', 'watch', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'too', 'much', 'focused', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'character']",N/A

Do you suspect things might have been different if JFK hadn't died in 1963?Well, according to this extremely thoughtful direct-to-video SF movie, you're right. See, a guy comes back from the future and prevents JFK's assassination, and the result is . . . well, that's the movie, so I'd better not spoil anything for you.As has been noted, the film does jump around. But it's not confusing at all; in fact it's extraordinarily well handled. The jumping around is part of the process of exposition, and that's where most of the drama in the film lies. At any rate you won't have any trouble knowing which scenes are happening when.The alternate history of the Kennedys is also quite well handled. JFK is respected but not worshipped or whitewashed -- and in general, far from lionizing the Kennedy clan, the film takes a fairly gritty and politically realistic view of them. This is a future that could actually have happened, if only . . .Parts of it are laugh-out-loud funny, too. I won't spoil any of _that_ stuff either, but you'll enjoy all the little references to what-would-have-become-of-so-and-so-in-this-alternate-history.If you enjoy time-travel and/or alternate-history stories, you'll like this movie.

751912,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B000094J7J,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[3, 3]","Can a science fiction film exist without the science? I feel it can, but there are many who do not share that sentiment and those are the people who tend to dislike TIMEQUEST intensely because this is a film about time travel that has the audacity to mention not a single word about the technology that makes its story possible--it simply IS. It is hardly the first film to do this. TIME AFTER TIME hardly gives a logical explanation nor for that matter does the early film version of H.G. Wells' TIME MACHINE, but that didn't prevent us from being able to enjoy them. In TIMEQUEST we are simply asked to presume that it has been developed by a single man acting alone. It is the REASONS behind his need/desire to invent this device and what he intends to do with it as well as the repercussions of his actions on history that are the focus of this story--not a lot of pseudo-scientific babble and sleek shiny computer banks.As I said, I feel a science fiction film CAN exist as more than a mere showcase for its technology, and the reason is because SF merely asks the question ""What if?"" In this case the entire question is; What if a time traveler went back to November 22, 1963 with the intention of stopping the assasination of John F. Kennedy, and by extension that of his brother Robert 5 years later? Why would he do it? The answer appears simple on the surface because a great many of us would give anything to be able to go back to that horrible day and stop it all from happening if we only could...but our time traveler is motivated by something beyond wanting to set history right and change the world for what he is certain will be the better. Why does he wait until almost the last moment--why not pop in a couple of weeks before hand? How on earth does he manage to convince anyone that he's anything more than a nutcase when he shows up in the Presidential Suite of the hotel in what looks like a deep sea diver's outfit? And what is the message that he won't let Jackie hear--only Jack and Bobby are privy to it? Lots of questions.All of this could get terribly serious very quickly if it weren't for the film's sense of humor--which a few seem to have missed. The best part goes to Bruce Campbell playing against type as a futuristic maverick Hollywood director (read= Oliver Stone) who is firmly convinced that the Kennedy family has been involved in a cover-up for the last 37 years which he intends to reveal in his next film entitled NOVEMBER 22, 1963.He's right, of course, although he could never begin to guess what it was that really happened on that date--much less what was supposed to have happened! Bruce's scenes also give us some funny examples of how stopping the assasination changed popular culture--for one thing John Lennon is still alive and still married to his first wife Cynthia, and the Beatles never really made it big in the states although they were fairly popular in Europe for awhile. As Bruce says, ""kids just couldn't relate to them."" I found the bombing of the Beatles to be an interesting sidelight in the film since many psychologists at the time theorized that their extreme popularity was a direct reaction to the truma kids suffered as a result of JFK's death.For a low budget film everything looks pretty slick and polished. Some have objected to the the film's decidedly nonlinear approach, but to me it seems the perfect way to tackle a story about time travel and the fact that almost every scene carries a date at the bottom made it very easy for me to follow. None of the actors resemble their real life counterparts physically, but most of the voices and accents are good matches. Luckily Caprice Benedetti in the critical role of Jacqueline Kennedy did not try mimic her voice--it wouldn't have worked at all and might have sounded a bit silly. JFK isn't portrayed as a saint. His womanizing is brought out, and comes back to haunt him in a later scene when J. Edgar Hoover (nicely played by Larry Drake) tries to uses some evidence of his infidelity as blackmail against him. Robert Kennedy is portrayed as almost ruthless in his determination to protect his brother from any and all dangers, and is more than a match for Hoover in the blackmail department when he has adequate warning.Have you ever wondered how your own life might have been different if you had done this or that, gone here or there, went right or left? Even the slightest change in the most insignificant of lives can have a ripple effect that goes outward and touches others, and so must their death. Who then is to say that the future shown in this silly little movie with its rose colored glasses might not actually occur if the leader of a powerful nation were to be spared assassination--especially if that man was aware that he was being given a second chance at life? It has been suggested that this film is only for die hard Kennedy fans. That might be true (its defintely NOT for die hard right wingers who kneel down in the direction of Bill O'Reilly every night to say their prayers) but with the rebirth of hope that Obama is supposed to have brought to our nation maybe this film will serve as a delicate warning of the day an earlier generation saw the first of three death blows dealt to its own dreams and naievete and innocence, and remind them that such history is only set right in science fiction movies.

I mean, how can a movie be that bad? Also, I really love the whole time travel genre, am interested in the JFK assasination. . . how bad could this movie really be?Well, this movie is indeed very very bad.  As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything redeeming about this at all.  Let's see.  The plot? The plot was okay. Definitely not too interesting, but the premise of the film was good and the actual plot and subplots were even almost okay.  Everything else? Ugh. Just horrid.  The acting was stiff and unnatural.  Everyone in this movie just couldn't act.  The guy who played Kennedy was the most talented, I suppose, but it seemed everyone else was just reading their lines.  They were really really BAD.  And, OMG, the dialogue! The dialogue was unbelievable! It was so so so terrible.  My husband was in the adjoining room on the computer and I was actually EMBARRASSED for him to hear this movie that I was watching! The dialogue was just laughable-- unintentionally laughable.There isn't too much more to say about this. It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. And, I've seen lots and lots of movies.  I'm trying to think of another bad movie so that I could mention it and then say this is even worse. But, I can't even think of a movie that is even at all as bad as this one.  I know that some of the Stephen King movies have been really bad. This is worse. I can't even think of something close that's comparable.

751916,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B000094J7J,Matthew Kresal,"[1, 1]","As anyone who makes the mistake of watching the Sci-Fi Channel on weekends can tell you the term ""low-budget science fiction movie"" is almost an oxymoron. Here though is a film that proves to be far from it. In fact Timequest is a good exercise in how to make a movie on a low budget without looking (entirely) like it is low budget.Timequest has a pretty good cast. True some of them may not be greatest physical look-a-likes in the world but they manage to catch the spirit of the real-life people they portray. This is true of the three leads (Victor Slezak as JFK, Caprice Benedetti as Jackie, Vince Grant as RFK) and especially of Slezak. Slezak makes you believe he is JFK in his appearances especially with his speech at Rice University and the sequence that follows it (which sells this film the best in my opinion). Then there's Bruce Campbell as Oliver Stone like director William Roberts. Now I'm not a Bruce Campbell fan by any means (far from it in fact) but I found his short appearances to be enjoyable none the less. While it is true the cast has a few misfires (Jeffery Steiger as Oswald and Dan Miller as Dan Rather both come to mind instantly) but for the most part it is a fine cast all things considered.The main selling point of this film isn't the cast though but the story. Writer / director Robert Dyke has crafted a good alternate history film based around one of the most profound ""what-ifs"" of the last century: what if JFK had lived past November 22nd, 1963? The world that Dyke and the film shows us is perhaps a bit too optimistic for some but it seriously makes one wonder. The film also finds time to poke fun at some of the conspiracy theories regarding the JFK assassination in some of the most unexpected places which is fun for anyone who has a good knowledge of the subject.That said the film does have some problems. The first of such is the time-travelers' motive for his journey (which is the one cringe-worthy moment of the film to say the least). But perhaps the biggest problem is the fact that the film viewpoint of the world is perhaps too optimistic (yes that is both a plus and minus sadly). There is also the matter of the jumping around in time which I've had people I've shown the film to tell me is confusing (especially in the first third or so of the film). For once though as the production values are excellent for the most part. The low budget nature of the film isn't an issue in a science-fiction film.Yet outside of these problems there is a rather good film sitting here. From a fine cast to a well crafted ""what-if"" story, Timequest shows that that the term ""low-budget science fiction movie"" is not an oxymoron when done right. Here is an intelligent, well thought out, and well produced film that gives an interesting answer to one of the most profound ""what-ifs"" of the last century: what if JFK had lived?

At least the Time Quest movie implied a conspiracy, which is more likely. If Mr. Oswald had been involved in any way, there would not have been any reason to kill him publicly. American justice? No. Texas justice? Most likely. I wouldn't say the country would be better off if Kennedys (both JFK & RFK) had lived, but this country became an oligarchy on 11-23-63.

The actual plot, acting, and dialouge is of the bad indie variety which is why the movie is less popular than what you would expect.",4,MOVIE NEEDS POLISH,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,926,"['movie', 'question', 'What', 'would', 'happened', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'assassinated', 'then', 'most', 'hokey', 'corny', 'fashion', 'Now', 'am', 'big', 'Kennedy', 'lover', 'was', 'really', 'ignorant', 'believe', 'whole', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'up', 'roses', 'plot', 'private', 'chat', 'Kennedy', 'men', 'affairs', 'man', 'who', 'time', 'travels', 'save', 'lives', 'sacrifice', 'Kennedy', 'sure', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'guy', 'was', 'was', 'child', 'time', 'history', 'rewarded', 'Kenndys', 'always', 'look', 'own', 'who', 'help', 'them.The', 'movie', 'amusing', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'had', 'stomach', 'churning', 'times', 'plot', 'premise', 'interesting', 'why', 'movie', 'popular', 'sub-culture', 'way', 'actual', 'plot', 'acting', 'dialouge', 'bad', 'indie', 'variety', 'why', 'movie', 'less', 'popular', 'what', 'would', 'expect']",N/A

The man playing the role looks and seems more like Jesse Jackson.These are just a few odd things thrown in this movie. Nobody looks like the famous people they are portraying. The closest is the woman playing Jackie Kennedy.Time travel is such a strange subject to try to guess what would happen. Personally, I see events happening or not happening on a more micro level. That even one ""insignificant"" soul missing can make a huge difference in the world. Think on a small level. One person can make a ripple effect on the world. Just by turning left instead of right.

751928,AHBUDOLKOWTH9,B000094J7J,Will Bueche,"[10, 12]","Picked this one up on a whim due to the presence of low-budget film favorite Bruce Campbell (appearing here in a brief bit just to signal to genre buffs that this little film is worth checking out), and moreover because I was impressed that a filmmaker would actually believe that this often-thought-of concept was a concept that he or she could do better than anyone else.And as it turns out, this little low budget film manages to tell a solid story that will appeal to anyone who enjoys the old or new ""Outer Limits"" series.Low budget or no budget films are rarely perfect and this is no exception. Yet so much of this film is perfect, from a highly effective recreation of the look of the early 1960s, to a range of excellent main and supporting cast members (fans of Northern Exposure and Twin Peaks will recognize some faces here in the supporting roles), and -- not least important when making a film about Texas and the Kennedys -- excellent voice work. The bizarro Kennedy family accent sounds entirely natural - something that even high-budget epics about the Kennedys have not managed to achieve.Beyond the realistic 1960s environement, the generally good cast -- including the lead actress who reminds me of Linda Fiorentino -- this is a sweet story whose feature length running time manages to give what short ""Outer Limits"" episodes often do not -- time to revel in the alternate world that it so effectively creates.TimeQuest is the kind of indie low budget film that, like a college level theatrical production, can either be an unexpected pleasure, or a complete waste of time. This is firmly in the former category, no question. My rating of five stars acknowledges that this is not a high budget feature film; it is a five star indie film in the sense that it transcends its budget and my expectations, much to my delight.",5,"Picked up on a whim, glad I did",1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,1841,"['Picked', 'one', 'up', 'whim', 'due', 'presence', 'low-budget', 'film', 'favorite', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'appearing', 'here', 'brief', 'bit', 'just', 'signal', 'genre', 'buffs', 'little', 'film', 'checking', 'out', 'moreover', 'was', 'impressed', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'actually', 'believe', 'often-thought-of', 'concept', 'was', 'concept', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'anyone', 'else.And', 'out', 'little', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'manages', 'tell', 'solid', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'new', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'series.Low', 'budget', 'budget', 'films', 'are', 'rarely', 'perfect', 'exception', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'perfect', 'highly', 'effective', 'recreation', 'look', 'early', '1960s', 'range', 'excellent', 'main', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'fans', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'will', 'recognize', 'here', 'supporting', 'roles', 'not', 'least', 'important', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'Texas', 'Kennedys', 'excellent', 'voice', 'work', 'bizarro', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'accent', 'entirely', 'natural', 'something', 'even', 'high-budget', 'epics', 'Kennedys', 'have', 'not', 'managed', 'achieve.Beyond', 'realistic', '1960s', 'environement', 'generally', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'sweet', 'story', 'feature', 'length', 'running', 'time', 'manages', 'give', 'what', 'short', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'episodes', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'time', 'revel', 'alternate', 'world', 'so', 'effectively', 'creates.TimeQuest', 'kind', 'indie', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'college', 'level', 'theatrical', 'production', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'unexpected', 'pleasure', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'firmly', 'former', 'category', 'question', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'high', 'budget', 'feature', 'film', 'five', 'star', 'indie', 'film', 'sense', 'budget', 'expectations', 'much', 'delight']",N/A
