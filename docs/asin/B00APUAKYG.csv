There are the surface elements, things that are quite obvious, that will appeal to some viewers and then there are the challenging little bits.  The intense introspection that the characters experience during the course of the movie.  Real questions, like who am I, what roles to I have in the universe, and so on.

1614744,A359IT81FBX64Y,B00APUAKYG,Steven Mason,"[9, 12]","This film tries to be intellectual and erotic, and it succeeds in some small ways, but not enough to ignite the fires of the mind or the body. The premise is interesting: An older (60-ish) famous and successful journalist trapped in a bathroom with a young and beautiful (30-ish) journalist aspirant, both of them naked. As wonderful as that may sound (at least to us men), neither one wants to be trapped. Expecting to be stuck for at least a day or two, they pass the time with talk, mostly. But none of the talk is very interesting. The old journalist is not wise, he's mostly a lecher. He's a decent enough guy for that; he's not aggressive. But neither is he very seductive. And should you start to feel some empathy or pity for how lonely he must be, devoting his life to the noble calling of journalism and all that, keep in mind that he is happily married and he doesn't really care that much for journalism.Let me back up a bit. I told you that neither one wants to be trapped naked in the bathroom, but the old man does want to have sex with the girl. That's the only reason he agreed to meet her in the first place. This is what he does and this is what he has always done, with lots of girls over the years, in spite of being happily married. This girl, an aspiring journalist, agreed to meet him for an interview. Apparently she was not aware of his Lotharian reputation. Once he takes her up to a friend's apartment he makes his intentions clear, sort of. At first he tells her that he just wants to see her naked, just to look at her, telling her some boring, lame story about old men needing to look at young bodies. Like I said, he's not much of a seducer. The girl refuses at first and makes to leave, but instead returns and presents herself. He then proceeds to fingerpaint her body, which she finds disturbing, so she calls the whole thing off. She takes a shower - in the aforementioned bathroom - to wash the paint off. And he, of course, goes into the bathroom to watch. And that's how they get trapped. You see, there is something wrong with the bathroom door. Ah, a simple and brilliant plot device!Now maybe you're wondering if the two of them ever stop talking and get around to having sex? I'm not going to tell you. Let's just say that they talk a lot. He talks a lot more than she does, but like I said, none of it is very interesting. He's a lecher, and he's not wise, he's not very funny, he doesn't care about anyone except himself, he's not sexy and he's not seductive. It's unclear to me if the dialogue is meant to sound intellectual or meant to sound pretentious. If the movie is trying to depict a rather pathetic, lecherous old man, it succeeded. But what of the girl? She doesn't say anything interesting either. We never learn what motivated her to undress in the first place. Was she expecting the old lech to procure her a good journalism job at a major newspaper? Did she do it out of pity or compassion for an old man, offering her young body as a gift? Does she have a daddy complex? Who knows? But because neither of the characters said anything interesting, who cares?The best part of the movie, for a lecherous old man like me, was to see the beautiful young woman. But unlike the old man in the movie, I'd like more than that. I didn't really get to know the girl as a person, but maybe she is as shallow as the old man and there isn't much to know.Bottom line: After watching this movie, I needed to take a hot shower, not a cold shower.",2,Cold shower not required,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3489,"['film', 'be', 'intellectual', 'erotic', 'small', 'ways', 'not', 'enough', 'ignite', 'fires', 'mind', 'body', 'premise', 'interesting', 'older', '60-ish', 'famous', 'successful', 'journalist', 'trapped', 'bathroom', 'young', 'beautiful', '30-ish', 'journalist', 'aspirant', 'naked', 'As', 'wonderful', 'may', 'sound', 'least', 'men', 'one', 'be', 'trapped', 'Expecting', 'be', 'stuck', 'least', 'day', 'two', 'pass', 'time', 'talk', 'mostly', 'none', 'talk', 'very', 'interesting', 'old', 'journalist', 'not', 'wise', 'mostly', 'lecher', 'decent', 'enough', 'guy', 'not', 'aggressive', 'very', 'seductive', 'should', 'start', 'feel', 'empathy', 'pity', 'how', 'lonely', 'must', 'be', 'devoting', 'life', 'noble', 'calling', 'journalism', 'keep', 'mind', 'happily', 'married', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'journalism.Let', 'back', 'up', 'bit', 'told', 'one', 'be', 'trapped', 'naked', 'bathroom', 'old', 'man', 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'girl', 'only', 'reason', 'agreed', 'meet', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'what', 'always', 'done', 'lots', 'girls', 'years', 'spite', 'being', 'happily', 'married', 'girl', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'agreed', 'meet', 'interview', 'Apparently', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'Lotharian', 'reputation', 'Once', 'up', 'friend', 'apartment', 'intentions', 'clear', 'sort', 'first', 'just', 'see', 'naked', 'just', 'look', 'telling', 'boring', 'lame', 'story', 'old', 'men', 'needing', 'look', 'young', 'bodies', 'said', 'not', 'much', 'seducer', 'girl', 'first', 'leave', 'instead', 'returns', 'presents', 'then', 'fingerpaint', 'body', 'disturbing', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'shower', 'aforementioned', 'bathroom', 'wash', 'paint', 'off', 'course', 'bathroom', 'watch', 'how', 'get', 'trapped', 'see', 'something', 'wrong', 'bathroom', 'door', 'Ah', 'simple', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'device', 'Now', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'two', 'ever', 'stop', 'talking', 'get', 'having', 'sex', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'talk', 'lot', 'lot', 'more', 'said', 'none', 'very', 'interesting', 'lecher', 'not', 'wise', 'not', 'very', 'funny', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'not', 'sexy', 'not', 'seductive', 'unclear', 'dialogue', 'meant', 'sound', 'intellectual', 'meant', 'sound', 'pretentious', 'movie', 'trying', 'depict', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'lecherous', 'old', 'man', 'succeeded', 'what', 'girl', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'interesting', 'either', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'motivated', 'undress', 'first', 'place', 'Was', 'expecting', 'old', 'lech', 'procure', 'good', 'journalism', 'job', 'major', 'newspaper', 'Did', 'do', 'pity', 'compassion', 'old', 'man', 'offering', 'young', 'body', 'gift', 'have', 'daddy', 'complex', 'Who', 'characters', 'said', 'anything', 'interesting', 'who', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'lecherous', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'see', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'old', 'man', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'girl', 'person', 'maybe', 'as', 'shallow', 'old', 'man', ""n't"", 'much', 'know.Bottom', 'line', 'watching', 'movie', 'needed', 'take', 'hot', 'shower', 'not', 'cold', 'shower']",Madrid 1987
