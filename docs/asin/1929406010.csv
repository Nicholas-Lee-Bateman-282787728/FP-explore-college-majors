195714,A1BATHNY2QAZI2,1929406010,"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime""","[4, 5]","I last saw this French/English animated film in 2000 on VHS.  The copy is good, but I need to buy a new copy.  The storyline follows familiar ground with a twist.  Pinocchio goes into space to battle Monstro, the space-whale who threatens to destroy the earth.  Our hero is helped by Nurtle the space turtle and the power of hypnotism, which Pinocchio thinks he has mastered.  The songs are cute, but forgettable, our wooden friend is now blonde, but Gepetto, the fox and the cat and the good fairy return.  The video is good clean fun and a family treat.  I hope to get my kids to sit down and watch the film with me.

195715,A1REU1B7BLB9NE,1929406010,Primate,"[2, 3]","I was a kid when this movie first hit the theaters. My grandmother took me to see it in the afternoon, and I loved it so much I begged my mother to take me again that night. Since then, I've only seen it once on TV, so when the VHS was available in the '80's, I scooped it up. Now that I've replaced it with the DVD, I'm extremely happy. It's unabridged and complete, unlike some movies Disney has put on DVD. The visuals are beautiful, just as I remember them, and the widescreen feature makes me feel like a kid in the theater again. The sound has no defects and has not been altered, unlike a DVD set I got a few years ago from Rhino. Plus, the menu includes a commentary, the opening toy shop musical sequence without overlaid titles, and a mini space science documentary that preceded the theatrical release which I had completely forgotten about since it's never been shown on TV. The project was created by an executive at Filmation, which made many Saturday-morning cartoons such as Star Trek and Buck Rogers, and a theatrical Snow White sequel in the '90's, and was produced by an animation studio in Belgium. It was originally released by Universal, then Columbia distributed the VHS, so I'm grateful that Image Entertainment was finally able to market such a high-quality recording on DVD. This is one of three animated treasures from my childhood, and I'm very happy to have completed my collection.",5,Pinocchio in Outer Space,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1411,"['was', 'kid', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'grandmother', 'took', 'see', 'afternoon', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'begged', 'mother', 'take', 'again', 'night', 'then', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'TV', 'so', 'when', 'VHS', 'was', 'available', ""'80"", 'scooped', 'up', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'replaced', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'happy', 'unabridged', 'complete', 'movies', 'Disney', 'put', 'DVD', 'visuals', 'are', 'beautiful', 'just', 'remember', 'widescreen', 'feature', 'feel', 'kid', 'theater', 'again', 'sound', 'defects', 'not', 'been', 'altered', 'DVD', 'set', 'got', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Rhino', 'menu', 'commentary', 'opening', 'toy', 'shop', 'musical', 'sequence', 'overlaid', 'titles', 'mini', 'space', 'science', 'documentary', 'preceded', 'theatrical', 'release', 'had', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'never', 'been', 'shown', 'TV', 'project', 'was', 'created', 'executive', 'Filmation', 'made', 'many', 'Saturday-morning', 'cartoons', 'such', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'theatrical', 'Snow', 'White', 'sequel', ""'90"", 'was', 'produced', 'animation', 'studio', 'Belgium', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Universal', 'then', 'Columbia', 'distributed', 'VHS', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'market', 'high-quality', 'recording', 'DVD', 'one', 'three', 'animated', 'treasures', 'childhood', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'completed', 'collection']",N/A

After a few minutes of this kiddie schlock, you'll probably feel like getting blasted yourself._Pinocchio in Outer Space_ does take pains to remain scientifically plausible, by 1960s standards at least -- with one notable exception: The film's antagonist is a jet-propelled space whale named Astro.  Whenever he appears, the film flies giddily off the rails, entering what can only be described as an alternate, psychedelic universe.Director Ray Goossens lifts jokes, character business and entire scenes from the 1940 Disney feature.
