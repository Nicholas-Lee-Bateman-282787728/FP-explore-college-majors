1389009,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00480OCXO,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[3, 3]","This version of the Addams Family seems more in tune with the original Charles Addams comic strip while still including some of the best Addams Family TV Show qualities.  Gomez Addams is short and pudgy a shocking change from the thin athletic John Astin Gomez who in my opinion defined the role.  However all the Addams in the animated version are just as funny and all together creepy as those on the 1960's Addams Family TV show.  the Addams Family animation quality id typical Hanna Barbara fare maybe a step down from Flintstones Quality.  The animators did manage to capture the essential essences of the Addams characters.  Best of all the comedy works between the Characters.  Only thing missing is Gomez is not made to seem as passionately in love with Morticia Addams as was the case on the Addams Family TV show.  I understand this animated version of the Addams Family was designed for Saturday Morning Kiddy time viewing but, I always felt the love shared between Gomez and Morticia was ALWAYS handled in the best taste.  Gomez was always passionately in love with Morticia but never showed it in ways patently vulgar.  I was an autistic very young child when the Addams Family TV show first aired and I was pleased to see a husband and wife love each other so passionately and honestly.I always enjoyed these Addams Family animated stories and remember waiting to watch them on Saturday Mornings.  Because Uncle Fester loved light bulbs as did I he was always special to me.",5,There is nothing like spending time with those crazy Two D Addams!
