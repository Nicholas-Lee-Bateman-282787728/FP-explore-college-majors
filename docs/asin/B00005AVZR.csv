579295,A2R1SKQMT43GT8,B00005AVZR,Tom Tuerff,"[33, 34]","As a nerdy 12-year-old in 1969 who spent too much time listening to music (a habit I hold to this day), I absolutely LOVED this show. However, thinking back, I really didn't appreciate what was going on here; mixing different styles of music to make everybody happy--if you don't like rock, hang on a minute, here comes Buck Owens! Don't like country? Here's some soul music, etc.While both of these volumes are worth having, Volume 2 takes the cake simply because some of the show lineups are positively bizarre--no more so than the last show, which the cast and crew KNEW would be the last show.Host and comedian David Steinberg had become a good friend of Groucho Marx and invited him to be on the show. Great move. Still ""with it"" at age 74, Steinberg's interview with Groucho in the middle of the show is positively classic. His genuine compliments and good-natured kidding of singer John Sebastian, who is clearly in awe of Groucho, are positively touching.At the end of the show, Steinberg brings Groucho back and Groucho pretty much takes over; so much so that Steinberg finally stops him in mid-""shtick"" and says, ""Uh, Groucho, I have to go home!""Musically, this disc has some neat stuff. Pete Seeger leading a group of kids singing ""Bring 'em Home"" still gets you going, and you want to go start a war just so that you can send boys over there and bring 'em back.Janis Joplin's ""Try"" is great, too, shot in the same studio as the Seeger bit (it appears this show was shot in various locations depending on the audience needed to make the act work.)It would have been nice if they could have licensed the use of the Beatles' video ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"" (Music Scene was the only show that dared to show this video in '69, albeit with the ""Christ"" bleeped out), but alas, it's not here.Interesting to see Lily Tomlin in her pre-Laugh-In days, and it's easy to see why she jumped ship before the show was finished.The MOST interesting thing about these DVDS are the trailers that sold this show. They featured some of the comedians that showed up on the program along with comedians (including Howard Hesseman under a different name) and a band that didn't--The Rolling Stones. Obviously, the Stones were supposed to play a much bigger part in what this show was supposed to be, and somewhere between preview and premiere, that all fell through.Whether you really need more than one version of ""Take a Letter Maria"" is totally up to you, but otherwise this is a great collection.

Hearing it on the radio is okay, but watching some of the performers live caused me to question my affinity for sixties rock and roll.  Obviously, there are some gems on this disc, but overall, it is simplistic, silly, and dreadful.  Most of the truly good artists from the era don't appear, but several of the very popular ones do.  Don't look for the Beatles or the Stones.  One highlight is a great performance by Janis Joplin.
