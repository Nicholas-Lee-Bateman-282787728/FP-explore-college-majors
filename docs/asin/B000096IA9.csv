752644,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000096IA9,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[2, 3]","I hope you weren't planning on seeing anything remotely related to the Marquis de Sade's great work ""Justine"" in this film.  This is practically a completely different story, the most this movie should say is that it's inspired by ""Justine"" not that it IS ""Justine"".  This most certainly is not ""Justine"".  If you want to see ""Justine"" go pick up the French film ""Justine de Sade"" that is far more faithful to the original story.  This ""Justine"" by Franco is a very artistic version and they take a lot of artistic license, to the point where they completely change the ending and have a ""happily ever after"" version.  I think Sade would consider this an insult.I have no illusions that filming a De Sade film in the 60's would prove to be quite difficult in terms of censorship, heck it was even more of a problem for the author himself... as we all know of his prison sentence for it.  So, in some ways, I'm not surprised they took a lot out, but to change such drastic amounts of the story... I don't know, I'm just not sold on it.  A few of the more memorable moments are certainly there, like the band of thugs with Dubois after the prison break, Justine being taken in by the guy that wanted to kill his aunt (though it's his wife in this film) and the monks at the monastery.  However, this is very much a softly erotic film and barely touches on the atrocities De Sade talked about (thought probably quite explicit by that times standards).  I don't mind that they took out the brutality all that much, but my problem was the script was so far off base that I just couldn't buy into the changes.  Like there's this painter that Justine runs into and he is then her rescuer later in the film, as well as love interest.  ""Justine"" by De Sade doesn't have any of this and it leaves me wondering how they thought working in this random character wouldn't be very obvious.  It's as if they were trying to take something that is purely debauched and trying to make the audience feel that virtue will triumph.  Anyone who has read De Sade, truly, knows that his writings don't work that way!The one additional concept that I sort of liked was showing De Sade in prison, played by Klaus Kinski, and having visions that apparently influenced him to write ""Justine.""  I thought it was a nifty inclusion, but I don't like the execution that much.  The audience views this as a man in prison going insane and being tormented by his dark visions.  Based on what I've read of Sade's history, it didn't really work that way.  De Sade was making bold statements against society and religious oppression in the most lascivious way he could think of.  Sort of an ""F you!"" to the establishment that had locked him away.  The way the scenes with Sade pan out in this film makes me feel that we're supposed to sympathize and feel bad for Sade, because he actually looks as if he regrets what he sees and the tortures he writes about.  If that was truly the case he would've stopped with ""120 Days of Sodom"" instead of writing a vast amount of other tales along similar lines.The quality of acting is a bit better than the 1970's version I recommended above and I do agree that Romina Power made a very beautiful Justine.  Now for those begging to know, there is a decent amount of nudity in this.  Nowhere to the degree of ""Justine de Sade"", but enough to entertain the perverse, though bear in mind this film is far more artistic.  I think they played up the fact that Sade was genuinely into theater and they upped that factor a ton.  Jack Palance played a superb Father Antonin, for how he is portrayed in the film, considering he was drunk all the time.  It did give a very maniacal feel.Unfortunately they had to deviate drastically from the original story to make this.  Not even ""Justine de Sade"" has detailed footage of the perversions Sade wrote about, but it has a great deal more than in here.  It also stays true to the Sadean philosophy and story in general!  I feel that Franco's ""Justine"" deviates from Sade's philosophical concepts greatly.  Luckily in terms of directing Franco did do a great job in this department, if only the writer he was working with stayed true to Sade...  One thing that is worth watching after the movie is the twenty minute interview with Franco, I found that very interesting and excellent.  Take it or leave it, if you're a Franco fan in general, you might find merit in this, but if you're like me and a fan of Sade you will be sorely disappointed... possibly insulted even.  I have never seen a film change a story so much.

752645,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000096IA9,Jeffrey Leach,"[54, 58]","Jesus ""Jess"" Franco is a director that's sort of a secret amongst serious horror film fans. If you're the type of casual fan of the genre who thinks that ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Halloween,"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" are the best films the horror industry ever made, you have never heard of Jess Franco. If you think the ""Leprechaun"" franchise constitutes the apogee of the horror genre, you have never heard of Jess Franco. If you think collecting Wes Craven and John Carpenter films are as far as you need to go to balance out your DVD collection, you have never heard of Jess Franco. I don't mean to give the impression that Franco is the best directorial talent ever seen in the field, because he definitely isn't, but I have found that knowledge about some of this man's films is one of the best ways to distinguish the novices from the veterans. His most highly regarded--at least in some quarters--film remains ""Vampyros Lesbos,"" a fascinating take on the age-old vampire legend. Then there is Franco's take on the Marquis de Sade's Justine, which doesn't exactly classify as a horror film as much as it does your typical Eurosleaze trash. Read on...""Justine"" (let's just call it that instead of putting de Sade's name in front of it; I'm feeling lazy tonight) stars Romina Power as the titular character, a young, nave waif cast out into the decadent world of 18th century France. It all starts when Justine and her dissolute sister Juliette (Maria Rohm) must fend for themselves after being thrown out of an orphanage. The two head straight for Paris and a local harridan hotel where Juliette fits right in as the main attraction. Justine doesn't make the cut, however, and heads out into the world to find her own niche. What follows is a series of slightly bawdy and often boring romps involving all levels of French society. Justine first obtains employment at a small inn thanks to the grizzled owner Du Harpin (Akim Tamiroff!) only to find herself back on the street after rebuffing the overtures of a seedy nobleman. She then ends up in prison where she meets a tough, streetwise goon by the name of Madame Dusbois (Mercedes McCambridge!!) who has a date with the executioner she's planning on skipping. In between the woman's enormously hammy cackling, we learn that she needs Justine's help to escape her fate. They get away, and Justine falls in briefly with Dusbois's gang of ugly French thugs.All is not lost, however, as Justine manages to escape from these vagabonds only to fall into a dismal situation involving the Marquise de Bressac (Slyva Koseina) and her good for nothing hubby. A murder plot and a lot of inherited wealth leads to a situation in which Justine decides to do the ""right"" thing by spilling the beans to the clueless Marquise. Oops. Hubby still gets what he wants but learns in the process that Justine's big mouth might have ruined his plans. Result? A big 'M' (for murderess) branded on Justine's chest in what is probably the film's best sleazy scene. What follows is rather tame by comparison, although I should mention none other than Jack Palance shows up as Antonin, the head loony of some crazed sect of debauched nut jobs. The film screeches to a halt as Justine, her morality in tatters and on her last leg emotionally and physically, somehow manages to find a personal savior who could care less about her soiled reputation. At least I think that's what happened. Oh, I almost forgot: none other than Klaus Kinski turns up as the Marquis de Sade himself, but doesn't do much except pace about in a prison cell and write down Justine's various adventures.""Justine"" is one of Franco's better efforts even though it ultimately disappoints in the sleaze department. The budget is bigger, the stars are recognizable and surprising to see in a Jess Franco film, and the musical score sounds wonderful. What went wrong? A lot. Considering the Marquis de Sade is one of history's most lecherous individuals, the movie is strictly for the milk and cookies crowd. Sure, a few whippings and some gratuitous nudity pop up from time to time, but such scenes are generally uninspired and tame compared to the stuff you'll experience in the Marquis's writings. Even more alarming are the performances. Akim Tamiroff in a Jess Franco film? Wow! Quite a drop from ""Touch of Evil"" to this, wouldn't you say? Mercedes McCambridge also should have known better; she's awful and grating in her part. As for Jack Palance, well, if you've seen ""The Shape of Things to Come"" you have a good idea of how far Jackie will go to prop up his faltering career. He lurches and screeches through his part jacked up on wine (according to the interview with Franco on the disc) and generally embarrasses himself at every opportunity. Still, despite all its flaws, I liked ""Justine"" for the mere fact that it's a quite watchable bad movie. I love bad movies.Extras on the disc include the aforementioned interview with Franco, one of the better ones I've seen, in which he discusses working with Kinski (they got along) to dealing with Palance's penchant for drink to his extreme dislike of Romina Power. A trailer, poster and still galleries, and a Franco bio also find their way into the supplements section. If you're looking for a truly disturbing and sleazy cinematic adaptation of de Sade, I recommend Pasolini's ""Salo.""

Franco made plenty of costume dramas such as this, but unless I'm mistaken, this the one of his few literary adaptations. While ""Venus in Furs"" is a classic by the notorious Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the film really takes off in a different direction and Franco brings enough fresh ideas that the film works.I suppose it was inevitable that Franco would, at some point, try to adapt The Marquise de Sade. Since Pasolini already gave us the definitive vision of ""Salo"" and since ""Juliette"" is waaay too long for a film, I suppose that leaves ""Justine"" as the only available Sade work. As long as the film or the director has something interesting to bring to the project, I'm not one to get bothered by a loose adaptation. Unfortunately, Franco changes only what will make it convenient for him and the essence of Sade's work is lost.The whole point of ""Justine"" is that she stands by her morals and propriety, never wavering, and finds nothing but cruelty and pain. Franco imposes masochistic pleasure on her, thus making the whole story meaningless. It's like Moby Dick, but instead of hunting a whale, Captain Ahab decides to just enjoy sailing around the ocean.If you're familiar with Sade, you'll find this film frustrating. If you don't know Sade, but typically enjoy Franco's work, I'm sure you'll agree that this is not one of his strongest efforts. I wouldn't fault him too much - the guy made so many films that they can't all be gems.

752648,A1F5OOEFKR1K3,B000096IA9,T. Lee,"[0, 0]","If you are a Jesus Franco, you know what you are getting yourself into. Jesus Franco is not such guys like Federico Fellini or Ingmar Bergman, but rather more of a B-movie filmmaker. He makes cheesy B-films but very entertaining at the same time. I'm a huge fan of those genre, and I was really interested when I found out that he directed a film about one of my favorite writers, Marquis de Sade.I went in with the intention of it being over-the-top and ridiculously funny, and I was pretty much right. The biggest thing that disappointed me, though, was that Klaus Kinski, who plays Marquis de Sade, barely has any screen time. He only appears for about 10-20 minutes through out the whole film, if not less. He is just supposed to be the ""narrator"" but even then he barely narrates anything. This film is revolved around the main character, Justine(which was one of his books' title). You follow her around from being a girl of faith to entering the world of prostitution and going into all sorts of mess. I won't go too much into detail but this is more of a sleazy and decent adaptation of Marquis de Sade's work. I only gave this a five start because it doesn't get enough attention but if it did and was given a proper rating, I'd give it about 3.This film is NOT a biopic NOR even a serious take on his book. It's not a comedy but it sure is not a dead serious film with in-depth meanings. It's a B-movie, and I enjoy it for what it is. It was entertaining to see Jesus Franco do a semi-adaptation on Marquis de Sade, except in a B-movie style. Enjoyable film for B-movie fans. This is NOT a serious film about Marquis de Sade nor is there accuracy. But I do love the ridiculousness of the film.
