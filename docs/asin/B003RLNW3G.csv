1361228,A2QYV7LL3OCXJ,B003RLNW3G,R Helen,"[0, 0]","In terms of the difficulty and the quality of the workout, this volume is the best of his five ""Sweatin'"" videos. I really am sweatin' at the end of it. I think the song choice is better and the dancing is stronger. It is just an all around great video. It is typical Richard Simmons and we get to see some of the old timers from the first videos and how they've progressed. It would be perfect if there were some floor and strength training, but as a dance video I would highly recommend it. I usually choose it when I want a slightly tougher workout. Lots of fun and worth taking the time to learn the moves.",5,The best Richard Simmons workout ever!,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,610,"['terms', 'difficulty', 'quality', 'workout', 'volume', 'best', 'five', 'Sweatin', 'videos', 'really', 'am', 'sweatin', 'end', 'think', 'song', 'choice', 'better', 'dancing', 'stronger', 'just', 'around', 'great', 'video', 'typical', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'timers', 'first', 'videos', 'how', ""'ve"", 'progressed', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'were', 'floor', 'strength', 'training', 'dance', 'video', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'usually', 'choose', 'when', 'want', 'slightly', 'tougher', 'workout', 'Lots', 'fun', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'learn', 'moves']",N/A
1361229,AH18JCRUKGUQP,B003RLNW3G,SuperReader,"[0, 1]","I like the first Sweatin' and wanted to try the others. So far, the original is the only one I like. This one is the worst so far.First of all, it has that ridiculous skit at the beginning warning against making copies of the movies. It's stupid, you can't skip it, and it goes on forever.The exercises themselves aren't any good. Richard doesn't spend enough time on the moves that are actually beneficial and way too much time on the ""filler"" moves. He changes too much and too fast, with NO warning that he is changing moves.As always, the background is filled with people dressed for a 1980's party instead of working out.",1,Just say no.,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,626,"['like', 'first', 'Sweatin', 'wanted', 'try', 'others', 'So', 'far', 'original', 'only', 'one', 'like', 'one', 'worst', 'so', 'far.First', 'ridiculous', 'skit', 'beginning', 'warning', 'making', 'copies', 'movies', 'stupid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'forever.The', 'exercises', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'Richard', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'moves', 'are', 'actually', 'beneficial', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'filler', 'moves', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'NO', 'warning', 'changing', 'moves.As', 'always', 'background', 'filled', 'people', 'dressed', '1980', 'party', 'instead', 'working', 'out']",N/A
