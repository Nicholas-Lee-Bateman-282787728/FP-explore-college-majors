1269415,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B002IC1ESU,Douglas M,"[4, 4]","The main interest of ""Breakfast for Two"" is that it provides the dramatic Barbara Stanwyck with a light comedy role which she handles with typical Stanwyck professionalism. That means she is pleasant and competent but not in the league of such contemporaries as Carole Lombard. Stanwyck herself said she was not a natural comedienne and only as good as the script and here the script is merely adequate. The plot is a very trivial farce about Stanwyck's attempts to reign in playboy Herbert Marshall. A lot of the comedy is physical with the obvious use of a double for Marshall, who in fact wore a prosthesis from a World War 1 injury. Eric Blore is on hand as Marshall's butler and does his thing with his usual aplomb. You'll either find him very funny or loathe him. The sets are typical RKO all white art deco, like the best of the Astaire Rogers films.The film has been released in the very expensive Warners Archive collection which means it is unrestored, has no extras and is very expensive.",3,Pleasant assembly line comedy,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1000,"['main', 'interest', 'Breakfast', 'Two', 'dramatic', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'light', 'comedy', 'role', 'typical', 'Stanwyck', 'professionalism', 'pleasant', 'competent', 'not', 'league', 'such', 'contemporaries', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Stanwyck', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'natural', 'comedienne', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'script', 'here', 'script', 'merely', 'adequate', 'plot', 'very', 'trivial', 'farce', 'Stanwyck', 'attempts', 'reign', 'playboy', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'lot', 'comedy', 'physical', 'obvious', 'use', 'double', 'Marshall', 'who', 'fact', 'prosthesis', 'World', 'War', '1', 'injury', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'hand', 'Marshall', 'butler', 'thing', 'usual', 'aplomb', ""'ll"", 'either', 'find', 'very', 'funny', 'loathe', 'sets', 'are', 'typical', 'RKO', 'white', 'art', 'deco', 'best', 'Astaire', 'Rogers', 'films.The', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'very', 'expensive', 'Warners', 'Archive', 'collection', 'unrestored', 'extras', 'very', 'expensive']",N/A
1269416,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B002IC1ESU,J. Olsen,"[4, 4]","Barbara Stanwyck had some great comedy roles in her time, but this was not one of her best. It is entertaining, nonetheless. Following a fashionable party one evening Valentine Ransome (Stanwyck) goes ""pub crawling"" with a man she just met there, played by Herbert Marshall. He is Jonathan Blair, of the Blair Steamship Lines. His playboy lifestyle is exceeding his income and leaving his company without a skipper, as it sinks into ruin. Valentine sees his potential and sets out to save him from himself, and for herself, by buying up controlling stock in his company and appointing him vice president. She is joined in her scheme by Blair's faithful valet, played by Eric Blore. Jonathan Blair will have none of it and determines to marry his girlfriend, though he doesn't really love her. Twice he tries to go through with the ceremony, but is thwarted each time by some outrageous antics from Miss Ransome and his own valet. I loved the dog Peewee, the boxing scene, the nervous little minister trying valiantly to perform a marriage, and Marshall chasing Stanwyck across a slippery floor after he has discovered their plot and turned the tables.The movie is presented in Full Screen 4x3,  1.33:1. This is part of the Warner Brothers Archive Collection, which means it has no special features, and is for ""play only"" devices, not player/recorders. The picture quality is sharp, but not clean. The sound is acceptable but not as clear as others I have from this collection. If you really like the stars, this will be fun to own, but it is not one of the best for either of the stars. That being said, I do enjoy it and am happy to own it.",4,"Lightweight Comedy--Fun, but not outstanding",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1642,"['Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'had', 'great', 'comedy', 'roles', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'Following', 'fashionable', 'party', 'one', 'evening', 'Valentine', 'Ransome', 'Stanwyck', 'pub', 'crawling', 'man', 'just', 'met', 'there', 'played', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'Jonathan', 'Blair', 'Blair', 'Steamship', 'Lines', 'playboy', 'lifestyle', 'exceeding', 'income', 'leaving', 'company', 'skipper', 'ruin', 'Valentine', 'potential', 'out', 'save', 'buying', 'up', 'controlling', 'stock', 'company', 'appointing', 'vice', 'president', 'joined', 'scheme', 'Blair', 'faithful', 'valet', 'played', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'Jonathan', 'Blair', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'marry', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'Twice', 'go', 'ceremony', 'thwarted', 'time', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'Miss', 'Ransome', 'own', 'valet', 'loved', 'dog', 'Peewee', 'boxing', 'scene', 'nervous', 'little', 'minister', 'trying', 'valiantly', 'perform', 'marriage', 'Marshall', 'chasing', 'Stanwyck', 'slippery', 'floor', 'discovered', 'plot', 'turned', 'tables.The', 'movie', 'presented', 'Full', 'Screen', '4x3', '1.33:1', 'part', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'special', 'features', 'play', 'only', 'devices', 'not', 'player/recorders', 'picture', 'quality', 'sharp', 'not', 'clean', 'sound', 'acceptable', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'others', 'have', 'collection', 'really', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'own', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'stars', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'enjoy', 'am', 'happy', 'own']",N/A
1269417,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B002IC1ESU,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","For many years I avoided Barbara Stanwyck simply based off one performance. And that incredibly poor judgment meant that I deprived myself of so many wonderful films.Mentioned in previous reviews that I'm now completely and totally enamored of her early romantic comedy work. And except for one large caveat, this is another terrific winner in that category. That caveat being her co-star, British actor Herbert Marshall. In another very similar movie, 'If You Could Only Cook', he essentially sank what could have been a romcom classic, simply by being miscast.This is the exact same situation.I don't fault Marshall per se. Not unlike today, during the 30's there was quite a bit of Anglophile infatuation, and he was often put into roles which weren't meant to be played by a stiff upper lip gentleman. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but role appropriateness has to recognized in the same way I can't ever see Sylvester Stallone playing Hamlet or Michael Cera portraying a Navy SEAL. Not less talented, just inappropriate.In 'Two' he portrays playboy Jonathan Blair, titular head of a global shipping company, but in name only. He leaves the actual day to day operations to the board of directors and shows up once a year to collect his annual payout. His life is about leisurely pursuits - chasing women, carousing the clubs, and having a good time. And his most recent nightly excursion and adventures has netted him quite the catch: Ms. Valentine Ransome, recent transplant from Texas.Unbeknownst to Jonathan, she's the daughter to one of the largest black gold fortunes in the world. An additional fact he's unaware of: The women of the Lone Star state are like their men - cut to the chase and sharpened to a point. She's found her man. One night and Val has fallen in love. Jonathan's spirit, his comic sense and inner confidence literally sweeps her off her feet. There isn't going to be another for her, and all she has to do is land her catch.Two things stand in her way. First, Jonathan's current girlfriend is a talentless, gold-digging, wannabe actress - she's in the relationship for the money and the money alone. Unfortunately, he hasn't a clue such creatures exist. Second, the company his family founded has for years been sliding down the path toward insolvency. The board of directors is now looking to sell so that they can divest themselves of their stock - basically allowing the sharks to come in and tear apart the company for the parts.Having ignored the very foundation of who he is, as a businessman and man, Jonathan finally realizes what's at stake. Not just economic, but the peril to his very sense of self, of family pride and honor. His very essence is in danger of being lost because he let himself be distracted from the very aspect which anchored his soul - the pride of Blair Shipping.Seeing ""her man"" broken and humbled to despair, Val is determined more than ever to put the fire back into his belly; to revive and rebuild that spirit she fell in love with the first night they met. She's going to reignite that spark - even if it means she has to become the focus of his hate.Barbara once again showcases her incredible blend of cool simmering sexuality and coy playful kitten, with just a drop of sinister manipulation. My favorite recipe for women.For fans of Stanwyck - this is extremely enjoyable. For everyone else - neatly amusing and fun.Movie Note: If the sound of razor blades being scratched across plate glass hurts, moderate or turn off the audio during the hilarious first wedding scene.",4,Another Missy Feast,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,3553,"['many', 'years', 'avoided', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'simply', 'based', 'off', 'one', 'performance', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'judgment', 'meant', 'deprived', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'films.Mentioned', 'previous', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'now', 'completely', 'totally', 'enamored', 'early', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'work', 'one', 'large', 'caveat', 'terrific', 'winner', 'category', 'caveat', 'being', 'co-star', 'British', 'actor', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'very', 'similar', 'movie', 'Could', 'Only', 'Cook', 'essentially', 'sank', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'romcom', 'classic', 'simply', 'being', 'miscast.This', 'exact', 'same', 'situation.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Marshall', 'se', 'Not', 'today', '30', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'Anglophile', 'infatuation', 'was', 'often', 'put', 'roles', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'played', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'gentleman', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'role', 'appropriateness', 'recognized', 'same', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'playing', 'Hamlet', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'portraying', 'Navy', 'SEAL', 'Not', 'less', 'talented', 'just', 'inappropriate.In', ""'Two"", 'playboy', 'Jonathan', 'Blair', 'titular', 'head', 'global', 'shipping', 'company', 'name', 'only', 'actual', 'day', 'day', 'operations', 'board', 'directors', 'up', 'once', 'year', 'collect', 'annual', 'payout', 'life', 'leisurely', 'pursuits', 'chasing', 'women', 'carousing', 'clubs', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'most', 'recent', 'nightly', 'excursion', 'netted', 'quite', 'catch', 'Ms.', 'Valentine', 'Ransome', 'recent', 'transplant', 'Texas.Unbeknownst', 'Jonathan', 'daughter', 'one', 'largest', 'black', 'gold', 'fortunes', 'world', 'additional', 'fact', 'unaware', 'women', 'Lone', 'Star', 'state', 'are', 'men', 'cut', 'chase', 'sharpened', 'point', 'found', 'man', 'One', 'night', 'Val', 'fallen', 'love', 'Jonathan', 'spirit', 'comic', 'sense', 'inner', 'confidence', 'literally', 'off', 'feet', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'do', 'land', 'catch.Two', 'things', 'stand', 'way', 'First', 'Jonathan', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'talentless', 'gold-digging', 'wannabe', 'actress', 'relationship', 'money', 'money', 'alone', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'clue', 'such', 'creatures', 'exist', 'Second', 'company', 'family', 'founded', 'years', 'been', 'sliding', 'down', 'path', 'insolvency', 'board', 'directors', 'now', 'looking', 'sell', 'so', 'can', 'divest', 'stock', 'basically', 'allowing', 'sharks', 'come', 'tear', 'apart', 'company', 'parts.Having', 'ignored', 'very', 'foundation', 'who', 'businessman', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'finally', 'what', 'stake', 'Not', 'just', 'economic', 'peril', 'very', 'sense', 'self', 'family', 'pride', 'honor', 'very', 'essence', 'danger', 'being', 'lost', 'let', 'be', 'distracted', 'very', 'aspect', 'anchored', 'soul', 'pride', 'Blair', 'Shipping.Seeing', 'man', 'broken', 'humbled', 'despair', 'Val', 'determined', 'more', 'ever', 'put', 'fire', 'back', 'belly', 'revive', 'rebuild', 'spirit', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'night', 'met', 'going', 'reignite', 'spark', 'even', 'become', 'focus', 'hate.Barbara', 'once', 'again', 'incredible', 'blend', 'cool', 'simmering', 'sexuality', 'coy', 'playful', 'kitten', 'just', 'drop', 'sinister', 'manipulation', 'favorite', 'recipe', 'women.For', 'fans', 'Stanwyck', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'everyone', 'else', 'neatly', 'amusing', 'fun.Movie', 'Note', 'sound', 'razor', 'blades', 'being', 'scratched', 'plate', 'glass', 'moderate', 'turn', 'off', 'audio', 'hilarious', 'first', 'wedding', 'scene']",N/A
