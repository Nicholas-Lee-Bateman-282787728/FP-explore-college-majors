On this spinoff of the Emmy-winning The Cosby Show,Denise Huxtable(Lisa Bonet) is away at Hillman College(in the real world,it's located in Atlanta). We don't know what she actually majored and/or minored in. Great support from Jasmine Guy and Sinbad. A DIFFERENT WORLD premiered on September 24,1987 on NBC,the same date TCS's Season 4 premiered. Filling Bonet's shoes on TCS is Geoffrey Owens,whose character Elvin Tibidaux married Denise's sister Sondra,portrayed by Sabrina LeBeauf. However,Bonet appeared on TCS during seasons 4 and 5 on a recurring basis. Even other TCS cast members guest-starred on various episodes this season. Sinbad guest-starred in a TCS Season 3 episode as a car salesman who sells Dr. Cliff Huxtable(Cosby) a new car.

905495,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B0009HBPEO,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 2]","First off, I would like to say the only reason I purchased A Different World was because I heard Lisa Bonet (Denise) was on the show. So I don't know much about the history of the show. In season three of the Cosby Show, Denise leaves for Hillman College and is gone from season four of the Cosby Show. A Different World originally was centered on Denise's experiences at Hillman College but after season one Lisa Bonet had become pregnant so she was dropped out of the show. A Different World also did what the Cosby Show didn't. They frequently addressed issues about race and equal rights, which Cosby Show writers avoided. Now I've seen a lot of criticism for season one, so I was surprised at how high it was in the ratings. It was number two, just behind the Cosby Show in the Nielsen ratings.Denise also shares her room with two other girls; Twenty-six year old Jaleesa Vinson Taylor (Dawnn Lewis) and a hyper Maggie Lauten. (Marisa Tomei) Denise also has to live close by to Whitney Gilbert (Jasmine Guy) a spoiled girl in the same dorm. Another college student is Dwayne Wayne, (Kareem Hardison) a very smart math student who also flirts a lot with not much success.Many people have said the show got better after Denise left, but I think the problem was not in Denise but in the stories for the episodes. I mean, one episode is all about Maggie looking for an egg, she's supposed to care for an egg as if it were a child for a class experiment about parenthood. Also, I would smile at jokes during each episode, but there were no laugh out loud moments. And that's what a sitcom is supposed to do. I enjoyed guest appearences from the Huxtable family but besides that, I guess I'm just not a big fan of the show. (I do think it's a good show though, just not my type)The DVD packaging was impressive for season one. It's similar to season one of the Cosby Show but the episodes are unedited. There also is a nice pamphlet with a letter from Debbie Allen, and it includes an episode guide. I would have listed the descriptions from the pamphlet below, but they are huge and they spoil certain episodes, so here are my episode descriptions.Reconcilable Differences - Airdate: 9/24/1987 - Denise takes up residence in Hillman college, and immediately clashes with her roommate Jaleesa Vinson. She decides to switch roommates and she ends up with the snobbish girl Whitley Gilbert. Denise has to decide with whom she will be roommates with, Jaleesa or Whitley.Pilot - Airdate: 10/1/1987 - Denise is unable to pay her dorm fee, and she doesn't want to ask her Dad (Cliff) for help.Porky De Bergerac - Jaleesa is elected dorm monitor and decides to impose strict penalties for slovenly behavior. So she decides anyone who makes a mess will have to wear a pig nose for the entire day. When Denise forgets to clean up she is forced to wear the pig nose and unfortunately her date is coming by.Those Who Can't...Tutor - Airdate: 10/22/1987 - Denise is going to flunk in math so Dwayne Wayne decides to help her. Unfortunately they study so long that they stay past dorm curfew. So Dwayne has to find a way to leave the dorm without being caught.Rudy and the Snow Queen - Airdate: 11/5/1987 - Rudy Huxtable visits Denise and she becomes fast friends with Whitley, and she starts spending all her time with Whitley instead of Denise during the visit. And Denise is not happy about it.Sometimes You Get the Bear, Sometimes the Bear Gets You - Airdate: 11/19/1987 -Denise, Jaleesa, and Maggie want to become the first women ever to take the head of the other team's mascot costume, (A tradition always done by the men) but there not the only ones aiming at getting the costume.If Chosen, I May Not Run - Airdate: 12/3/1987 - Denise decides to join Hillman college's track team.Romancing Mr. Stone - Airdate: 12/10/1987 - Denise has a crush on the new geology teacher Mr. Stone.The Gift of the Magi - Airdate: 12/17/1987 - Whitley and her father have planned a holiday in Switzerland, just the two of them. But Whitley's surprised that she won't be the only one coming along.Does He or Doesn't He? - Airdate: 1/7/1988 - The women at Gilbert Hall bet that Dwayne couldn't handle it if a woman actually responded to his lame pick-up lines.Advise and Descent - Airdate: 1/14/1988 - Denise volunteers as a school counselor during finals week, but she neglects her own work until the very last minute.The Prime of Miss Lettie Bostic - Airdate: 1/21/1988 - Gilbert Hall gets a new dorm director, Lettie Bostic. At first she seems very interesting but when the women at Gilbert Hall realize she's very strict, they want her strict rules and her gone.Wild Child - 2/4/1988 - Denise becomes friends with Cougar Barnett but doesn't realize she's hiding something from her.Dr. Cupid - Airdate: 2/11/1988 - Dwayne gets his own campus radio program and he uses his radio program to get a date for Valentine's Day.The Show Must Go On - Airdate: 2/18/1988 - Denise and Whitley get roles Maggie's play, and they both fall for the leading man Rick.Mr. Hillman - Airdate: 2/25/1988 - Denis is tired of sexual stereotypes on campus, so she enters Dwayne in the Miss Hillman contest.Speech Therapy - Airdate: 3/10/1988 - Jaleesa has written a great speech, but she has stage fright, so Maggie and Denise try to help her.Clair's Last Stand - Airdate: 3/24/1988 - Clair visits Denise but soon finds out about Denise's bad grades. Clair thinks Denise needs to get a job to help pay for her education and make her realize she needs to work harder.If Only For One Night - Airdate: 4/29/1988 - Denise decides to finally go on a date with Dwayne Wayne.Come Back, Little Eggby - Airdate: 5/5/1988 - Maggie's psychology class experiment is to learn about parenthood by caring for an egg as if it were a child. Unfortunately Maggie loses the egg and has to find it.My Dinner With Theo - Airdate: 7/7/1988 - Theo comes for a visit with Denise and she is looking forward to having some alone time with Theo but it seems that Theo is a big hit with the Hillman crowd and she is disappointed she's not getting to spend more time with her younger brother.The bonus disc is good as well. There is an unaired episode entitled ""Homie, Don't Ya Know Me?"" There also is an interesting documentary by E! Entertainment, a blooper reel and a Cosby Show trailer.Some people were glad Denise left, some weren't, some love season one, some people hate it. I'm right in between that line. It's good but not great, but I think it's still much better than most new sitcoms so I'd suggest buying a copy to see how you like it.",3,A Different World Season One,1277683200,"06 28,

905497,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0009HBPEO,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","Perhaps this is one of the few shows that ran sucessfully for a considerable length of time after the departure of its star.Originally built around Cosby Kid, Lisa Bonet's character, Denise Huxtable, the show stayed afloat for five more seasons after Bonet left, thanks largely to the prestige of its parent show as well as the writing and directing talents of Bill Cosby, Debbie Allen, and some of the show's stars.The first season found Denise struggling with college life at the fictional Hillman College in Virginia, forging relationships with fellow students, Jaleesa Vinson (Dawnn Lewis, who helped compose the show's theme song)a divorcee in her mid-twenties,Army brat Maggie Lauten(Marisa Tomei),the upper-crust scene stealer, Whitley Gilbert(Jasmine Guy,whom I recently had the pleasure of watching in a live stage performance),Whitley's silly young lackey, Millie(Marie Alise Recasner), the intially goofy, but ultimately daring and romantic math genius, Dwayne Wayne(Kadeem Hardison), who made flip-top sunglasses a fashion statement, and his lackey, slickster Ron Johnson(Darryl M. Bell), the illustrious Gilbert Hall House Mother, Lettie Bostic(Mary Alice), dorm manager Stevie Rallen(Loretta Devine),Glynn Turman's tough-as-nails math teacher, Col. Bradford Taylor, and cafeteria manager Vernon Gaines, (Lou Myers).The episodes ranged from plainly amusing to downright side-splitting, as the characters developed and the dynamics of the show shifted during the six years it was on the air. Old characters were replaced with new as Maggie, Stevie,Millie and Denise left, and we were introduced to Cree Summer's Southwestern hippie chick, Freddie Brooks,  Sinbad's Coach Walter Oakes, and Charnele Brown's aspiring doctor, Kimberly Reese.The series was a showcase for African American talent, including appearances by Gary Dourdan as activist, Shazza Zulu, Joe Morton's Senator Byron Douglas,  and  Dominic Hoffman's diplomat-in-training Julian Day, who each play a key role in Whitley's life, Diahann Carroll as Whitley's socialite mother, Marion,Patti LaBelle as Dwayne's mother, Adele, Alisa Guise Dickens, as Dwayne's one-time love interest,  Kinu Owens, who was of partial Japanese descent, Debbie Allen's Doctor Langhorne, Robert Guillaume's  Dean Winston, Roscoe Lee Browne's Dr. Barnabus Foster, Jada Pinkett-Smith's Lena James,Tisha Campbell-Martin as the AIDS victim, Josie Webb,Whoopi Goldberg as an English professor, Ajai Sanders as student Gina Deveraux,Abner Mariri as South African student, Kobie, the Ethiopian Entertainer, Senait as Ron's sister, Blair Underwood as a friend of Dwayne's slated to serve in the Persian Gulf war, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson himself, to name a few. Andrew Lowrey and Anita Morris as Freddie's mother and cousin gave a nod to her mixed-raced background.As homage was paid the the range and beauty of those of the African diaspora,many viewers saw the lives of blacks in all their complexities, and not just in the negative stereotypes portrayed in the media. Many who saw this series, as well as ""The Cosby Show"" itself, were inspired to improve their quality of life through higher education, and still many others may have been introduced to various facets of African and African American history that schools have often failed to teach.Nearly two decades after its final taping, it's still a magnificent, beautiful, and intelligent comedy to watch.

The 4 DVD box set includes 22 episodes from the shows first season and one bonus episode from a later season.A Different World was created as a spin off series for second to oldest Cosby Show daughter Denise Huxtable portrayed by actress Lisa Bonet. The shwo chronicled her life at a ficticious Historically Black College named Hillman.A lot of A Different World fans and critics judge the shows first season pretty harshly. Season one, like many television series, was a time of trial and error. As the show would progress it would deal with more serious topics and the writing improved, even still season one was enjoyable.The DVD box set includes a composition like booklet titled A Different World-Season One Big Laughs On Campus. This booklet is an episode guide and also includes trivia and random facts about the season.Season One primarily dealt with Lisa Bonet (Denise), and her two roommates Maggie (Marisa Tomei) and Jaleesa (Dawnn Lewis). Denise was away from home for the first time. Her roommate Jaleesa was twenty six and divorced and Maggie was a white girl at an all black college (although no one really made too much of a mention about this.) Acclaimed actress Loretta Devine was the first dorm mother Stevie. She had a small son and was replaced midseason by Mary Alice who took over the dorm mother role as Lettie.It's a really great season as we are introduced to Whitley. Whitley's voice seems especially high pitched during this season. As the show continued through the years Whitley and Dwayne would become the stars of the show.Season one was enjoyable but the show would really heat up and become Must See TV in later seasons. Producers of the DVD have provided fans with a taste of what's to come by including the episode ""Homie Don't Ya Know Me,"" from the shows 6th season. The show includes a guest appearance from slain rapper Tupac Shakur. In this episode Leena (Jada Pinkett Smith) is visited on campus by her hometown friend (Monica Calhoun). Her friend happens to bring along Leena's ex-boyfriend Piccollo (Tupac Shakur). Piccollo is set on trying to get Leena back and tries his best to punk her current beau (Bumper Robinson). The two men eventually get into a physical confrontation regarding Leena who not only has to deal with this drama but who finds herself torn between her friends from Baltimore and her friends from Hillman. This episode has run in syndication but never aired during the shows NBC run. This episode can be found on disc 4 with the bonus materials.Also included on Disc 4 is a E! Entertainment special titled ""A Different World: I Was A Network TV Star."" Show regulars Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Darryl Bell, Dawnn Lewis and several cast members who joined the show later in it's run appear in this featurette. The cast members and producer Debbie Allen sit around and reminisce about the show--and dish about all of the big stars who appeared on A Different World. It's a great short feature. Disc 4 also includes bloopers.The show would change in Season 2 with characters Denise and Maggie gone from the show and several new characters introduced including Freddy (Cree Summer). Hopefully, season two will arrive on DVD soon.",5,Review of A Different World Season One Box Set,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,3270,"['Different', 'World', 'Season', 'One', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'very', 'first', 'time', '4', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'bonus', 'episode', 'later', 'season.A', 'Different', 'World', 'was', 'created', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'second', 'oldest', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'daughter', 'Denise', 'Huxtable', 'portrayed', 'actress', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'shwo', 'chronicled', 'life', 'ficticious', 'Historically', 'Black', 'College', 'named', 'Hillman.A', 'lot', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'fans', 'critics', 'judge', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'pretty', 'harshly', 'Season', 'one', 'many', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'time', 'trial', 'error', 'show', 'would', 'progress', 'would', 'deal', 'more', 'serious', 'topics', 'writing', 'improved', 'even', 'still', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'enjoyable.The', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'composition', 'booklet', 'titled', 'Different', 'World-Season', 'One', 'Big', 'Laughs', 'Campus', 'booklet', 'episode', 'guide', 'also', 'trivia', 'random', 'facts', 'season.Season', 'One', 'primarily', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Denise', 'two', 'roommates', 'Maggie', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Jaleesa', 'Dawnn', 'Lewis', 'Denise', 'was', 'away', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'roommate', 'Jaleesa', 'was', 'twenty', 'six', 'divorced', 'Maggie', 'was', 'white', 'girl', 'black', 'college', 'one', 'really', 'made', 'too', 'much', 'mention', 'Acclaimed', 'actress', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'was', 'first', 'dorm', 'mother', 'Stevie', 'had', 'small', 'son', 'was', 'replaced', 'midseason', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'dorm', 'mother', 'role', 'Lettie.It', 'really', 'great', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'Whitley', 'Whitley', 'voice', 'especially', 'high', 'pitched', 'season', 'show', 'continued', 'years', 'Whitley', 'Dwayne', 'would', 'become', 'stars', 'show.Season', 'one', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'would', 'really', 'heat', 'up', 'become', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'later', 'seasons', 'Producers', 'DVD', 'have', 'provided', 'fans', 'taste', 'what', 'come', 'including', 'episode', 'Homie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ya', 'Know', 'Me', 'shows', '6th', 'season', 'show', 'guest', 'appearance', 'slain', 'rapper', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'episode', 'Leena', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'visited', 'campus', 'hometown', 'friend', 'Monica', 'Calhoun', 'friend', 'bring', 'along', 'Leena', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Piccollo', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Piccollo', 'set', 'trying', 'get', 'Leena', 'back', 'best', 'punk', 'current', 'beau', 'Bumper', 'Robinson', 'two', 'men', 'eventually', 'get', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'regarding', 'Leena', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'drama', 'who', 'torn', 'friends', 'Baltimore', 'friends', 'Hillman', 'episode', 'run', 'syndication', 'never', 'aired', 'shows', 'NBC', 'run', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'disc', '4', 'bonus', 'materials.Also', 'included', 'Disc', '4', 'E', 'Entertainment', 'special', 'titled', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'Was', 'Network', 'TV', 'Star', 'Show', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'Darryl', 'Bell', 'Dawnn', 'Lewis', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'joined', 'show', 'later', 'run', 'appear', 'featurette', 'cast', 'members', 'producer', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'sit', 'around', 'reminisce', 'show', 'dish', 'big', 'stars', 'who', 'appeared', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'great', 'short', 'feature', 'Disc', '4', 'also', 'bloopers.The', 'show', 'would', 'change', 'Season', '2', 'characters', 'Denise', 'Maggie', 'gone', 'show', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'including', 'Freddy', 'Cree', 'Summer', 'Hopefully', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'soon']",A Different World - Season 1

905502,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B0009HBPEO,Edward Aycock,"[4, 8]","Despite being number 2 in the ratings for its debut season, ""A Different World"" had a lot of weak spots.  Lisa Bonet wasn't strong enough of an actress to carry a show on her own, the characters were inconsistent and the storylines were mediocre and not especially funny.  I think the episodes about a rubber pig's nose and babysitting eggs were some of the lowest points of the season.That said, there are some good things about the first season, namely the introduction of the characters of Jaleesa, Whitley, Dwayne Wayne, Ron and Walter who would develop more in later seasons and it's undeniably fun to see a pre-Oscar Marisa Tomei (who knew?) desperately trying to be anything but the token white girl.  The show only really got going when Debbie Allen (Phylicia Rashad's sister) took over as the producer in the second season and Charnele Brown as Kim and my eternal favorite, the radiant Cree Summer as Freddie, joined the cast; I look forward to these future releases.Perhaps sensing that the first season alone wouldn't grab buyers, the fourth disc has extras that could have waited until further season releases but are nevertheless very good.  There is a ""I Was a Network Star"" featurette that reunites many cast members in 2005; notably, there is a segment where the actors who were part of season one soundly dismiss it as then-producer Anne Beatts attempts to do more ""Square Pegs""-style scripts.  There's also a blooper reel that encompasses several seasons and a ""lost episode"" starring Tupac Shakur from the lukewarm final season that should have stayed lost.",3,"Not that hot, but good extras elevate the set",1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1576,"['being', 'number', '2', 'ratings', 'debut', 'season', 'Different', 'World', 'had', 'lot', 'weak', 'spots', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'actress', 'carry', 'show', 'own', 'characters', 'were', 'inconsistent', 'storylines', 'were', 'mediocre', 'not', 'especially', 'funny', 'think', 'episodes', 'rubber', 'pig', 'nose', 'babysitting', 'eggs', 'were', 'lowest', 'points', 'season.That', 'said', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'first', 'season', 'namely', 'introduction', 'characters', 'Jaleesa', 'Whitley', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'Ron', 'Walter', 'who', 'would', 'develop', 'more', 'later', 'seasons', 'undeniably', 'fun', 'see', 'pre-Oscar', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'knew', 'desperately', 'trying', 'be', 'anything', 'token', 'white', 'girl', 'show', 'only', 'really', 'got', 'going', 'when', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'sister', 'took', 'over', 'producer', 'second', 'season', 'Charnele', 'Brown', 'Kim', 'eternal', 'favorite', 'radiant', 'Cree', 'Summer', 'Freddie', 'joined', 'cast', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'releases.Perhaps', 'sensing', 'first', 'season', 'alone', 'would', ""n't"", 'grab', 'buyers', 'fourth', 'disc', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'waited', 'further', 'season', 'releases', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'good', 'Was', 'Network', 'Star', 'featurette', 'many', 'cast', 'members', '2005', 'notably', 'segment', 'where', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'soundly', 'then-producer', 'Anne', 'Beatts', 'attempts', 'do', 'more', 'Square', 'Pegs', '-style', 'scripts', 'also', 'blooper', 'reel', 'several', 'seasons', 'lost', 'episode', 'starring', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'lukewarm', 'final', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'lost']",A Different World - Season 1
905503,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B0009HBPEO,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[2, 2]","Sure, this first season of A Different World may be lacking in various areas.  As in, you've got Denise (Lisa Bonet) being depicted as this young woman with all the potential in the world who does almost nothing to further her ccareer.  And, you've got Marissa Tomei fretting over the loss of an eggby and the size of her body buffer zone.  But, this writer still enjoys the memories and the presence of the both of them.Okay, maybe the series improved after the first season and the departure of Lisa & Marissa.  But, the real helper was the arrival of Debbie Allen.  She probably could've improved the Denise and Maggie characters in the confines of the script, if either of them had decided to stick around.Anyway, it's still great to witness the way that Dwayne, Whitley, Jalessa, Ron, Millie, Stevie and Lettie's characters all began.  And, the antics they all got into were all very cute and memorable.  [As in Dwayne saying to a pignosed Denise, ""Whattaya say, we get out of here and go dig for truffles?""  Personally, I quite enjoy watching that.  And, Lisa actually looks real cute in that nose.  Then, there's her Porky reference at the end of the episode.]Also, I got a major kick out of the use of ""Seven More Days"" by Terence Trent D'Arby in the 12th episode, ""Advise and Desent.""  Watching that episode as many times as I did - along with the rest of the set - is what led me to purchasing my own copy of the first record by TTD (or Sananda).10-24-11: Here's a trivial tidbit.  Partway through the season, a new character appeared named Lettie Bostick.  During the Season 3 finale of The Cosby Show, ""Hillman,"" a new college president was appointed, played by Gloria Foster.  Ms. Foster would later portray The Oracle in the first 2 volumes of the Matrix trilogy.  Following Ms. Foster's passing, the role would be assumed by Mary Alice (who'd played Lettie on this show).",5,"Very Silly but Still, Very Enjoyable.",1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1886,"['Sure', 'first', 'season', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'may', 'be', 'lacking', 'various', 'areas', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Denise', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'being', 'depicted', 'young', 'woman', 'potential', 'world', 'who', 'almost', 'nothing', 'further', 'ccareer', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'fretting', 'loss', 'eggby', 'size', 'body', 'buffer', 'zone', 'writer', 'still', 'memories', 'presence', 'them.Okay', 'maybe', 'series', 'improved', 'first', 'season', 'departure', 'Lisa', 'Marissa', 'real', 'helper', 'was', 'arrival', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'probably', 'could', ""'ve"", 'improved', 'Denise', 'Maggie', 'characters', 'confines', 'script', 'had', 'decided', 'stick', 'around.Anyway', 'still', 'great', 'witness', 'way', 'Dwayne', 'Whitley', 'Jalessa', 'Ron', 'Millie', 'Stevie', 'Lettie', 'characters', 'began', 'antics', 'got', 'were', 'very', 'cute', 'memorable', '[', 'Dwayne', 'saying', 'pignosed', 'Denise', 'Whattaya', 'say', 'get', 'here', 'go', 'dig', 'truffles', 'Personally', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Lisa', 'actually', 'real', 'cute', 'nose', 'Then', 'Porky', 'reference', 'end', 'episode', ']', 'Also', 'got', 'major', 'kick', 'use', 'Seven', 'More', 'Days', 'Terence', 'Trent', ""D'Arby"", '12th', 'episode', 'Advise', 'Desent', 'Watching', 'episode', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'rest', 'set', 'what', 'led', 'purchasing', 'own', 'copy', 'first', 'record', 'TTD', 'Sananda', '.10-24-11', 'Here', 'trivial', 'tidbit', 'Partway', 'season', 'new', 'character', 'appeared', 'named', 'Lettie', 'Bostick', 'Season', '3', 'finale', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Hillman', 'new', 'college', 'president', 'was', 'appointed', 'played', 'Gloria', 'Foster', 'Ms.', 'Foster', 'would', 'later', 'portray', 'Oracle', 'first', '2', 'volumes', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'Following', 'Ms.', 'Foster', 'passing', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'assumed', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'who', ""'d"", 'played', 'Lettie', 'show']",A Different World - Season 1

FOR STARTERS...WHY PEOPLE CRITIZED NEGATIVELY THIS FIRST SEASON...BECAUSE OF LISA BONET'S CHARACTER DENISE HUXTABLE.I'VE SEEN HER IN THE COSBY SHOW & IN A DIFFERENT WORLD SEASON 1 & IT IS NOT THAT FUNNY BUT NORMALLY FUNNY WHICH YOU WILL BE BORED & IN MY OPINION THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE HATE THIS FIRST SEASON IT IS BECAUSE LISA BONET WORE OUT HER DENISE HUXTABLE CHARACTER.

905507,ATAO781X1B6SY,B0009HBPEO,John J. Martinez,"[138, 176]","(I'm glad to hear that the DVD of Season one is coming out, but before you gloss over this review, please read on...)I had made it a point of watching it EVERY DAY on the Oxygen channel and my local station here in Chicago, and the episodes have been aired season to season from one to six chronologically as well! I was addicted to it, and I even sneak-watched it at work. However, whenever I watched it, I saw Lisa Bonet on the screen struggling to be the star of a sitcom in which the entire future of the show sat on her shoulders, and it hurt to see knowing what a dismal future she eventually laid for herself.We all know that this show was supposed to be a star vehicle of sorts for her, but look what she did - she kinda RUINED the first season... here's why.If I'm going to keep this review real on ANY level, one thing has to be said, once and for all - Lisa Bonet was (and still is, in my opinion) a bland actress with mediocre talent. Cosby made her a star because he saw something in her at age 9 or 10 on his show, but as she grew she unraveled herself by thinking she was somehow better than the limiting prospects of television (she has said this in subsequent interviews), then she decided to choose more 'daring' but crappy outside projects - does the film ANGEL HEART sound familiar???Although her lines were well written by the original writers of The Cosby Show, definitely featuring situations in a culturally diverse Hillman College (with roommates to boot), she herself as a character failed miserably and I did not shed a tear when she left the show.And let's be honest about one other thing - very few of the episodes are worth remembering - can you really remember one all the way through? The only one I can remember is the season finale, when Lisa finally goes out on a date with Dwayne before she 'goes home' to drop out later. It's funny, but it sets up a potential thing between him and Whitley, even though the show ends with Lisa kissing him and dancing with him under the stars.You also have to remember, she was still a part of the Cosby universe, so during Season One EVERYBODY from the Cosby show visited her, and one at a time just to milk the fame effect just enough to carry us 22 minutes plus commercials. Theo with his crazy weekend, Rudy and pop, her grandfather with the whole bear-stealing thing, and yes, ol Dad Bill wanders about for a few at the beginning.Ratings? Yes. Was it really worth watching for the QUALITY of the writing and the development? NO. I say again, NO.By the end of the season there was a change needed, and desperately, even though the show was coming in at the top 5 ONLY BECAUSE OF IT FOLLOWING COSBY. When Bonet learned she and Lenny Kravitz were going to have a child, she walked away - she WALKED AWAY from a top 5 show to be a wife and mother, which is fine down at the local office, but from a MAJOR TV SHOW that was built around you???This resulted in a severe shake-up, and now who would be the 'star' of the show? (Lisa would return to Cosby in a more background role.) Well, in my opinion, this was the main ingredient of change needed to make season two grow incredibly by the wonderful additions of Charnele Brown as Kim, Cree Summer as Winnie, Glynn Turman as Col. Taylor, Darryl M. Bell as Ron Johnson and comedian Sinbad. This rounded out the ensemble of already future stars Jasmine Guy, Dawnn Lewis and Kadeem Hardison.Marisa Tomei and other minor characters were simply dropped, and Hillman suddenly went from being a culturally integrated college to an almost predominately black populated one, as it was probably intended to be. No loss there, but you can see the subtle shift from diversity to one of almost inclusion, which is fine, because I think Cosby's original goal was to bring the black experience to America on a higher level (no pimps or gangbangers here!) and to feature a (almost) totally black cast - and to his credit, it worked wonderfully!You have to know Season One was awful - it really wasn't all that funny!!! The biggest key to the show's survival was the loss of Lisa - who was probably relieved to be walking away anyway - and when the producers hired director/choreographer DEBBIE ALLEN to SAVE THE SHOW from its lack of real ""star"" power, she then used scripts by writers who could realistically flesh out and bring to life the real trials of college for black people during the 90's with a great deal of intelligence and humor.Sorry, I digress... this is Season One we're supposed to be talking about.I don't know if the any of the DVDs of any of the seasons will include the recent June 21, 2005 E! Channel retrospective of A Different World which brought back a few of the main characters, but it would be nice for them to get everyone back to do a commentary of sorts on the disc and let them talk about their experiences on the show, etc. THAT would be worth the price of the disc for the first Season for me.I love this show, and although I watch it almost every day, I can't get myself to like the first Season, because it looks like ""Cosby's A Different World featuring my daughter Lisa Bonet"" instead of just a stand alone show. I'll be waiting for the second season DVD a lot more than this one. Sorry if you're offended in any way, but look at for what it is.Thanks for reading!",3,A GREAT show but a SO-SO first season... admit it!,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,5305,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'hear',

905508,A3UXDKQONZIBZN,B0009HBPEO,"Kelli N. ""snoops71""","[3, 4]","I am obviously in the minority here, which is fine with me, but I like the first season of ""A Different World"" the best. I always have. Yes, the latter seasons were good. Some serious and relevant issues were addressed, including drinking, date rape, racism, and HIV. However, I still think Debbie Allen made a big mistake getting rid of Marisa Tomei (Maggie Lauten). I can imagine all of the storylines which could have been written for her, as a white student at a predominantly African-American college. The upside of it all was Marisa went on to have an Academy-award winning career, with Ms. Allen having been in the audience the night she won for ""My Cousin Vinny"". Now, that revenge was SWEET... Did you notice Freddie was actually a clone of Maggie? She was just black. They even had the same hair color- red.In regards to Lisa Bonet, I thought she added a charm to the show, and was the perfect fit for Dwayne Wayne. She was a much better fit for him than Whitley. It took some time to get used to that pairing. I loved the rapport and chemistry of Denise, Maggie, and Jaleesa. I adored Dwayne, liked Ron, and enjoyed watching Whitley, a modern-day version of Scarlett O' Hara. I thought Ron and Millie were cute together. In case anyone remembers, ""A Different World"" won the People's Choice Award that year for best new comedy. I still recall Lisa giving the acceptance speech, thanking God, and giving a shoutout to her hubby, Lenny Kravitz.I was a junior in high school when ""A Different World"" made its debut, and we all loved it from the jump. Every Friday at school, we would talk about what happened the night before. There was a simplicity and overall innocence that year. It was fun to watch.That is why I am glad season one has been released on DVD, along with the extra features. It is so heartwarming and nostalgic to see these episodes again, one by one. Watching Whitley slap Dwayne at the pit when he wouldn't clear up rumors they had been fooling around in her dorm room, Jaleesa, Denise and Maggie singing and dancing to ""Rockin' Robin"", the initial hostility towards Lettie when she replaced Stevie in the dorm, Dwayne and Denise eventually going on a date, and sharing a kiss at the end... And yes, Denise wearing the pig nose, and Maggie losing her eggby, ""Artie"".Many people prefer the first season of ""Charlie's Angels"" over the ones which followed. Just like in the case of Farrah Fawcett, there was something very special about Lisa Bonet. That reminds me, in the opening credits, Denise, Jaleesa, Maggie, and Dwayne are seen washing a vintage orange and white car. During the ending credits, they are shown jamming on the same car.Who's car was that???",5,Season One- Still My Favorite,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,2687,"['am', 'obviously', 'minority', 'here', 'fine', 'like', 'first', 'season', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'best', 'always', 'have', 'Yes', 'latter', 'seasons', 'were', 'good', 'serious', 'relevant', 'issues', 'were', 'addressed', 'including', 'drinking', 'date', 'rape', 'racism', 'HIV', 'However', 'still', 'think', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'getting', 'rid', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Maggie', 'Lauten', 'can', 'imagine', 'storylines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'white', 'student', 'predominantly', 'African-American', 'college', 'upside', 'was', 'Marisa', 'went', 'have', 'Academy-award', 'winning', 'career', 'Ms.', 'Allen', 'having', 'been', 'audience', 'night', 'won', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'Now', 'revenge', 'was', 'SWEET', 'Did', 'notice', 'Freddie', 'was', 'actually', 'clone', 'Maggie', 'was', 'just', 'black', 'even', 'had', 'same', 'hair', 'color-', 'red.In', 'regards', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'thought', 'added', 'charm', 'show', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'fit', 'Whitley', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'pairing', 'loved', 'rapport', 'chemistry', 'Denise', 'Maggie', 'Jaleesa', 'adored', 'Dwayne', 'liked', 'Ron', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Whitley', 'modern-day', 'version', 'Scarlett', 'O', 'Hara', 'thought', 'Ron', 'Millie', 'were', 'cute', 'together', 'case', 'anyone', 'remembers', 'Different', 'World', 'won', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award', 'year', 'best', 'new', 'comedy', 'still', 'recall', 'Lisa', 'giving', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'thanking', 'God', 'giving', 'shoutout', 'hubby', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz.I', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'Different', 'World', 'made', 'debut', 'loved', 'jump', 'Friday', 'school', 'would', 'talk', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'before', 'was', 'simplicity', 'overall', 'innocence', 'year', 'was', 'fun', 'watch.That', 'why', 'am', 'glad', 'season', 'one', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'so', 'heartwarming', 'nostalgic', 'see', 'episodes', 'again', 'one', 'one', 'Watching', 'Whitley', 'slap', 'Dwayne', 'pit', 'when', 'would', ""n't"", 'clear', 'up', 'rumors', 'had', 'been', 'fooling', 'around', 'dorm', 'room', 'Jaleesa', 'Denise', 'Maggie', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Rockin', 'Robin', 'initial', 'hostility', 'towards', 'Lettie', 'when', 'replaced', 'Stevie', 'dorm', 'Dwayne', 'Denise', 'eventually', 'going', 'date', 'sharing', 'kiss', 'end', 'yes', 'Denise', 'wearing', 'pig', 'nose', 'Maggie', 'losing', 'eggby', 'Artie', '.Many', 'people', 'prefer', 'first', 'season', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'ones', 'followed', 'Just', 'case', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'opening', 'credits', 'Denise', 'Jaleesa', 'Maggie', 'Dwayne', 'are', 'seen', 'washing', 'vintage', 'orange', 'white', 'car', 'ending', 'credits', 'are', 'shown', 'jamming', 'same', 'car.Who', 'car', 'was']",A Different World - Season 1

A bonus Season 6 episode is included ""Homie Don't Ya Know Me"" which features Tupac.Season 1 was a work in progress. Lisa Bonet was as others have said, an average to mediocore actress. Her performances were soo bland. Scenes that should've been good were just okay. Her co-stars made efforts. Marisa Tomei & Dawnn Lewis did well. But some of the scenes where the 3 of them were all together Bonet made the scene fall flat. It seemed like Bonet just kinda drifted in & out of each episode with no real effort.Some things I didn't get:1) Why Maggie had to room with Jalissa & Denise. Whitley didn't have a roommate so that didn't make sense that they made a room with 3 people sharing.2)What the heck happened to Stevie & how she just up & disappeared like that.3) What Stevie's son was doing living with her in the dorms anyway. How did he go to school/daycare? That didn't seem like a proper living arrangement.4) Where Claire was everytime Denise called home.But overall this show is okay. It's watchable. Some laugh moments.

When watching Season 1, I was kinda bored.  None of the episodes were really all that interesting and some of them ended a little odd.

The rest were boring.  It's a shame that the show didn't get interesting until after Lisa Bonet left, because she really was an interesting character.  Oh!

A Different World was one of the few positive black shows that displayed young people doing something positive with their lives.  It's wonderful to tune into the show and see young black people going to college and meeting the challenges of college life.  In fact watching this show really made me want to go to college, and it's one of the reasons my younger sister did attend Hampton University.  I really feel this show made a huge impact on a log of young black men and women, and their decision to go to college.The cast consisted of girl hungry Dwayne Wayne, enterprising Rod, older student Jaleesea Vinson and dorm director Stevie Ralleh, Sinbad as Walter Oaks.  Lisa Bonet rounded out the cast as Denise Huxtable.  The season 1 set includes 22 episdoes and a bonus episode that never aired originally on NBC, but will air sometimes in syndication.  The episode with Jada Pinkett, and Tupac.  That one episode alone is worth buying the set!!!It was obvious the show was going through changes during it's first season.  For example adding Marisa Tomei who played Maggie as the white young lady who would also be Denise and Jaleesa's roommate.  Loretta Devine was the first Dorm Director, and then without explanation she was gone before season 1 was finished and replaced with Mary Alice who would take over.How many people caught on that Keenan Ivory Wayans,  Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans (of In Living Color) were guest stars on Season 1?The season of the show starts with Denise wanting to change roommates after meeting Jaleesa.  She is begging Jaleesa to move back into her original room after having to survive a night of spoiled Whitley's crickets radio.  Another episode explores financial responsibility when Denise has to find a job in order to pay hers and Jaleesa's room fees, but her being too proud to ask for the money from her parents.Another episode deals with Denise getting a D in calculus and studies with Dwayne Wayne, but when he is caught leaving Whitley's room after curfew rumors spread that they had something going on.Another episode deals with Maggie wanting to stay in school, even though he wants her to drop out and marry her.  When Rudy visits during Rudy and the Snow Queen she is so taken with Whitley, that Denise actually feels jealous.  One of my favorite lines comes from Cliff ""You keep her, and send her back when she gets a degree.""When Denise's grandfather comes to visit he still is in the school spirit and wants to steal the opposing schools mascot not knowing that Denise, Maggie and Jaleesa want to be the first women to steal the mascot.The girls have a huge crush on the geology professor played by David Alan Grier  (In Living Color), and when he pays special attention to her, she takes things the wrong way.  Another episode we see Whitley dealing with her parents getting a divorce.  We find out that Whitely eats when she is depressed.In Does he or Doesn't he, someone pretends to come on to Dwayne Wayne to prove a point because of his sorry pick up lines.  ""Rumor has it that the Biology department has built the ultimate woman and you must be the proto type.""Another episode deals with sexism, when Dwayne decides to run for Miss Hillman competition.  When he is being cat called he feels like a piece of meat and realizes that's how he treats the women on the campus.  In Speeach Therapy we find out that Jaleesa who is an excellent student is terrified of public speaking, and does not want to do a speech in front of the class.My favorite episodesPilotPorky De ReversalThose who can't TutorRudy and the Snow queenSometimes you get the BearDoes he or doesn't heRomancing Mr. StoneThe Show must go onThe first season Daryll Bell is not a regular cast member, but he is in a few episodes.  He becomes a regular in season 2.  I simply love this show, and I'm looking forward to the other seasons being released.  I want to own all the seasons, because even though season 1 was good, the show got 10 times better when Season 2 started, and it was funnier as well.Season 1 is what got the show going, and even though a lot of people did not appreciate the first season, I enjoyed it.  I'm happy to have the show as a part of my DVD collection.My final rating for Season 1 is 3 1/2.  The extras are great with the bloopers, and the reunion of the cast and their discussion of the show.",3,Yes I own and enjoyed Season 1,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,4472,"[""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'people', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1', 'show', 'watch', 'certain', 'lot', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'Different', 'World', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'positive', 'black', 'shows', 'displayed', 'young', 'people', 'doing', 'something', 'positive', 'lives', 'wonderful', 'tune', 'show', 'see', 'young', 'black', 'people', 'going', 'college', 'meeting', 'challenges', 'college', 'life', 'fact', 'watching', 'show', 'really', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'college', 'one', 'reasons', 'younger', 'sister', 'did', 'attend', 'Hampton', 'University', 'really', 'feel', 'show', 'made', 'huge', 'impact', 'log', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'women', 'decision', 'go', 'college.The', 'cast', 'consisted', 'girl', 'hungry', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'enterprising', 'Rod', 'older', 'student', 'Jaleesea', 'Vinson', 'dorm', 'director', 'Stevie', 'Ralleh', 'Sinbad', 'Walter', 'Oaks', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'rounded', 'out', 'cast', 'Denise', 'Huxtable', 'season', '1', 'set', '22', 'episdoes', 'bonus', 'episode', 'never', 'aired', 'originally', 'NBC', 'will', 'air', 'sometimes', 'syndication', 'episode', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Tupac', 'one', 'episode', 'alone', 'worth', 'buying', 'set', 'was', 'obvious', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'changes', 'first', 'season', 'example', 'adding', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'played', 'Maggie', 'white', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'Denise', 'Jaleesa', 'roommate', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'was', 'first', 'Dorm', 'Director', 'then', 'explanation', 'was', 'gone', 'before', 'season', '1', 'was', 'finished', 'replaced', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'over.How', 'many', 'people', 'caught', 'Keenan', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'Kim', 'Wayans', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Living', 'Color', 'were', 'guest', 'stars', 'Season', '1', 'season', 'show', 'Denise', 'wanting', 'change', 'roommates', 'meeting', 'Jaleesa', 'begging', 'Jaleesa', 'move', 'back', 'original', 'room', 'having', 'survive', 'night', 'spoiled', 'Whitley', 'crickets', 'radio', 'episode', 'financial', 'responsibility', 'when', 'Denise', 'find', 'job', 'order', 'pay', 'hers', 'Jaleesa', 'room', 'fees', 'being', 'too', 'proud', 'ask', 'money', 'parents.Another', 'episode', 'deals', 'Denise', 'getting', 'D', 'calculus', 'studies', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'when', 'caught', 'leaving', 'Whitley', 'room', 'curfew', 'rumors', 'spread', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'episode', 'deals', 'Maggie', 'wanting', 'stay', 'school', 'even', 'drop', 'out', 'marry', 'When', 'Rudy', 'Rudy', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'so', 'taken', 'Whitley', 'Denise', 'actually', 'jealous', 'One', 'favorite', 'lines', 'Cliff', 'keep', 'send', 'back', 'when', 'degree', 'When', 'Denise', 'grandfather', 'visit', 'still', 'school', 'spirit', 'steal', 'opposing', 'schools', 'mascot', 'not', 'knowing', 'Denise', 'Maggie', 'Jaleesa', 'want', 'be', 'first', 'women', 'steal', 'mascot.The', 'girls', 'have', 'huge', 'crush', 'geology', 'professor', 'played', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Living', 'Color', 'when', 'special', 'attention', 'things', 'wrong', 'way', 'episode', 'see', 'Whitley', 'dealing', 'parents', 'getting', 'divorce', 'find', 'out', 'Whitely', 'when', 'depressed.In', 'Does', ""n't"", 'someone', 'pretends', 'come', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'prove', 'point', 'sorry', 'pick', 'up', 'lines', 'Rumor', 'Biology', 'department', 'built', 'ultimate', 'woman', 'must', 'be', 'proto', 'type', 'episode', 'deals', 'sexism', 'when', 'Dwayne', 'run', 'Miss', 'Hillman', 'competition', 'When', 'being', 'cat', 'called', 'piece', 'meat', 'how', 'women', 'campus', 'Speeach', 'Therapy', 'find', 'out', 'Jaleesa', 'who', 'excellent', 'student', 'terrified', 'public', 'speaking', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'speech', 'front', 'class.My', 'favorite', 'episodesPilotPorky', 'De', 'ReversalThose', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'TutorRudy', 'Snow', 'get', 'BearDoes', ""n't"", 'heRomancing', 'Mr.', 'StoneThe', 'Show', 'must', 'go', 'onThe', 'first', 'season', 'Daryll', 'Bell', 'not', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'few', 'episodes', 'regular', 'season', '2', 'simply', 'love', 'show', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'other', 'seasons', 'being', 'released', 'want', 'own', 'seasons', 'even', 'season', '1', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'got', '10', 'times', 'better', 'when', 'Season', '2', 'started', 'was', 'funnier', 'well.Season', '1', 'what', 'got', 'show', 'going', 'even', 'lot', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'first', 'season', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'show', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection.My', 'final', 'rating', 'Season', '1', '3', '1/2', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'bloopers', 'reunion', 'cast', 'discussion', 'show']",A Different World - Season 1

The main reason why I gave this dvd 2 stars is because Deniese butchered the season (she wasnt funny like she was on the Cosby Show).  Jalessa was too uptight (she'll get funnier on season 2) and Whitley and Ron (not shown enough)was not that funny for this season, but will be hilarious by season 2.
