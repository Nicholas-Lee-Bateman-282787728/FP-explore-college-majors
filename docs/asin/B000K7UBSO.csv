1031020,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000K7UBSO,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 5]","`Crank' is a frenetic, cutting-edge ride through the streets of Los Angeles.  Starring Jason Statham (remember him as the villain in `Cellular'?)  as Chev Chelios, we have a novel plot that fuels an adrenaline adventure that at first seems to find any excuse to revel in sex and violence.  The editing (courtesy Brian Burda) of this remarkable romp is simply superb.  And, although not a comedy, the biggest laughs easily outdo the best jokes in movies like 'There's Something About Mary'.  (There's one scene when Chev hijacks a taxi and the radio is playing a hip-hop version of country`s ""Achy Breaky Heart"".  Despite all the mess, they certainly pay attention to details!)  State-of-the-art filmmaking, even if it borrows a few past tricks, 'Crank' seldom stops being clever.The movie starts blurry with snap jump images, simulating Chev waking up in some kind of stupor.  He finds a DVD with a familiar curse and puts it into the player.  Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo)  a fellow gang member appears and scathingly pronounces Chev's death sentence:  He has been drugged with a poison that will stop his heart if he's not pumped with adrenaline every moment of his remaining life.  From here we go through (literally!) every corner of town knocking down caf&eacute;s and plowing through shopping malls.  Just when the movie seems to be too much, they start parodying themselves--or at least the whole bloody genre.  Chev seems to have no friends, and a girlfriend, Eve (Amy Smart) and a personal physician (Dwight Yoakam-for Pete's sake!) who are both notorious for returning phone calls.  Until he reaches them he goes on a rampage, hording energy drinks at convenience stores and epinephrine from a local hospital.Much of `Crank' is gratuitous, but even without the innovative plot, they would still at least have an impressive style.  I may object to petty thievery and a protagonist who doesn't care whom he kills to save his own life, but we're not supposed to take it all so seriously, afterall.  Sort of like a comic book version of 'Kill Bill,'  or `Crash' without redemption, `Crank' juices up the formula of gangster movies.",3,Don't Stop or You'll Drop,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2136,"['Crank', 'frenetic', 'cutting-edge', 'ride', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Starring', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'remember', 'villain', 'Cellular', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'have', 'novel', 'plot', 'adrenaline', 'adventure', 'first', 'find', 'excuse', 'revel', 'sex', 'violence', 'editing', 'courtesy', 'Brian', 'Burda', 'remarkable', 'romp', 'simply', 'superb', 'not', 'comedy', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'easily', 'best', 'jokes', 'movies', 'Something', 'Mary', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Chev', 'taxi', 'radio', 'playing', 'hip-hop', 'version', 'country', 's', 'Achy', 'Breaky', 'Heart', 'mess', 'certainly', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'State-of-the-art', 'filmmaking', 'even', 'few', 'past', 'tricks', 'seldom', 'stops', 'being', 'clever.The', 'movie', 'blurry', 'snap', 'jump', 'images', 'simulating', 'Chev', 'waking', 'up', 'kind', 'stupor', 'DVD', 'familiar', 'curse', 'player', 'Verona', 'Jose', 'Pablo', 'Cantillo', 'fellow', 'gang', 'member', 'scathingly', 'pronounces', 'Chev', 'death', 'sentence', 'been', 'drugged', 'poison', 'will', 'stop', 'heart', 'not', 'pumped', 'adrenaline', 'moment', 'remaining', 'life', 'here', 'go', 'literally', 'corner', 'town', 'knocking', 'down', 'caf', 'eacute', 'plowing', 'shopping', 'malls', 'Just', 'when', 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'start', 'parodying', 'least', 'whole', 'bloody', 'genre', 'Chev', 'have', 'friends', 'girlfriend', 'Eve', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'personal', 'physician', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam-for', 'Pete', 'sake', 'who', 'are', 'notorious', 'returning', 'phone', 'calls', 'rampage', 'hording', 'energy', 'drinks', 'convenience', 'stores', 'epinephrine', 'local', 'hospital.Much', 'Crank', 'gratuitous', 'even', 'innovative', 'plot', 'would', 'still', 'least', 'have', 'impressive', 'style', 'may', 'object', 'petty', 'thievery', 'protagonist', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'whom', 'save', 'own', 'life', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'afterall', 'Sort', 'comic', 'book', 'version', ""'Kill"", 'Bill', 'Crash', 'redemption', 'Crank', 'juices', 'formula', 'gangster', 'movies']",N/A
1031021,A22AD8M2SSOFHJ,B000K7UBSO,"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh""","[1, 3]","Generally I was a little skeptical whether I would enjoy this movie. Most of the reviews I have seen comment on the picture quality. For me that is a selling point but not enough for me to spend over $20 on a movie for.From the first minute you realize the pace this movie will be moving at. Obviously this movie is not intended for people who enjoy slow paced story driven movies. Although the story line is very good for an action movie it does not bog down the pace. The movie is very well casted and the acting is actually quite good. Now this movie is not intended for children. As I know that many parents don't mind showing action movies to their children. Their is excessive foul language and nudity. Although this version has a family friendly version I just don't think even toned down it would still be good for children.One thing that makes this movie stand out is the comedey. That's right not only do you get non-stop action but you also get a good dose of comedy. Some of the situational comedy had me laughing out right loud. That is what made go from liking this movie to loving it.Overall this movie is what it intends to be.  Pure action...with a little touch of humor.

But, let's discuss this specific one.The plot: Jason's character is poisoned by some 'bad' guy and he can only stay alive for as long as his adrenaline level is up. If he calms down, he dies. To keep his excitement level up he does all kinds of crazy things such as driving his car through a shopping mall, robbing stores, cutting some bad guy's arm before killing him completely or 'mounting' his girlfriend in... China Town. Then, he dies and the movie ends.The good, relatively speaking: Jason Statham is shown shooting people, driving cars, having sex in public, running. There are funny moments like Jason's smashing some bad guy's face into a public phone while his girlfriend is completely unaware of the dangerous situation or the public sex scene where dozens of people watch and cheer.The bad: not exactly exciting car chases, not A LOT of shooting, only one arm is cut.The confusing: while Jason is supposed to be 'good', it looks like he too is involved with the bad guys. It's not clear why he gets poisoned or why he is not as bad as the other bad guys.Overall: I almost fell asleep while watching this super-charged action movie.

1031025,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000K7UBSO,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","Jason Statham (""The Bank Job,"" ""The Transporter"") further solidifies his status as the new millennium's action hero in ""Crank."" In the film, directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, Statham plays a hit-man on his way out who is given an hour to live when he is injected by a deadly drug. In order to stay alive, he must keep moving, keeping the heart pumping and adrenaline flowing, which means he engages in many a crazy car chase, inhales pharmaceutical drugs, sky dives without a parachute and even finds time to make love to his dopey girlfriend (Amy Smart) in a scene that needs to be seen to be believed.Without a doubt, ""Crank"" is the definitive action movie for the X-Box and energy-drink generation. It's loud, it's fast and it's insane. Nothing is off-limits in the hour and a half the movie plays out in. Turning off many a critic, but no doubt stimulating the senses of its intended audience, ""Crank"" is a brilliantly directed, tightly paced film that exceeds any and all expectations. The action is not as crazy as you would expect, in fact, it's crazier, and just when you find yourself thinking: ""They wouldn't do that, would they?"" they in fact, do. As first time feature film directors, Neveldine and Taylor handle the action with natural ease, going for the jugular with each and every scene. The editing is fast and hyper, feeling a lot like a music video at times, but is appropriate for the material at hand. Fact is, this isn't meant to be an intelligent (although it's not dumb) or profound (but it is profoundly fun) film.The story is simple, straight and to the point. You get all major plot-points within ten minutes at the beginning of the film, and from there on out, it's non-stop action and insanity. Truth be told, ""Crank"" is just as much a video game experience as it is a movie, and you'll even find several subtle references to old-school gaming that help set the tone. While the film is admittedly over-the-top and afflicted with A.D.D., what you see is what you get, and those who want a high-voltage action film that never lets up and is never afraid to push the limits of good taste will find ""Crank"" a satisfying fix.",4,The Crank Job,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,2172,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'Bank', 'Job', 'Transporter', 'further', 'solidifies', 'status', 'new', 'millennium', 'action', 'hero', 'Crank', 'film', 'directed', 'team', 'Mark', 'Neveldine', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'Statham', 'hit-man', 'way', 'who', 'given', 'hour', 'live', 'when', 'injected', 'deadly', 'drug', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'must', 'keep', 'moving', 'keeping', 'heart', 'pumping', 'adrenaline', 'flowing', 'many', 'crazy', 'car', 'chase', 'pharmaceutical', 'drugs', 'sky', 'dives', 'parachute', 'even', 'finds', 'time', 'make', 'love', 'dopey', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'scene', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'doubt', 'Crank', 'definitive', 'action', 'movie', 'X-Box', 'energy-drink', 'generation', 'loud', 'fast', 'insane', 'Nothing', 'off-limits', 'hour', 'half', 'movie', 'out', 'Turning', 'off', 'many', 'critic', 'doubt', 'stimulating', 'senses', 'intended', 'audience', 'Crank', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'tightly', 'paced', 'film', 'expectations', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'crazy', 'would', 'expect', 'fact', 'crazier', 'just', 'when', 'find', 'thinking', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'would', 'fact', 'do', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'film', 'directors', 'Neveldine', 'Taylor', 'handle', 'action', 'natural', 'ease', 'going', 'jugular', 'scene', 'editing', 'fast', 'hyper', 'feeling', 'lot', 'music', 'video', 'times', 'appropriate', 'material', 'hand', 'Fact', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'intelligent', 'not', 'dumb', 'profound', 'profoundly', 'fun', 'film.The', 'story', 'simple', 'straight', 'point', 'get', 'major', 'plot-points', 'ten', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'film', 'there', 'out', 'non-stop', 'action', 'insanity', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Crank', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'experience', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'even', 'find', 'several', 'subtle', 'references', 'old-school', 'gaming', 'help', 'set', 'tone', 'film', 'admittedly', 'over-the-top', 'afflicted', 'A.D.D.', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'who', 'want', 'high-voltage', 'action', 'film', 'never', 'up', 'never', 'afraid', 'push', 'limits', 'good', 'taste', 'will', 'find', 'Crank', 'satisfying', 'fix']",N/A

1031034,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000K7UBSO,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[5, 10]","After seeing the trailer for Crank my first thoughts about this movie was that its just going to be one of those throwaway, brainless action-flicks that wasn't good enough to be a summer blockbuster. It has all the ingredients to qualify as one. First-time writer/directors whose only work beforehand are commercials using MTV-style editing. A barely there story that seem to be fill in the quiet parts between action sequences. It even stars UK import Jason Statham whose past action-movies were entertaining but nothing to write home about. On a lark, and not having anything else to do, I went to watch this latest Statham action-movie. My initial assumptions from just seeing the trailer was completely dispelled and I was blown away at just how thrilling, exciting, and funny Crank ended up being.One thing I must point out is how this movie has confirmed Jason Statham in my eyes as the current action-star of the last couple years. A favorite of Brit action-auteur director Guy Ritchie, Statham has gradually built himself a decent list of action-movies that take good advantage of Statham's old-school sense of machismo and smirking confidence reminiscent of the such past macho actors like Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and Steve McQueen just to name a few. Statham is thick in body, but none too muscular and his wry, British sardonic personality mixes well with his many different action-movie personas. In Crank he pretty much steals and holds the ludicrous and unique different plot from spiralling out into camp and MST3K territory. Even though Statham will never be considered an acting giant, his performance as the hitman Chev Chelios racing against time to avenge his inevitable death is very well done. Crank starts with a bang and doesn't let up. Like the actions and behavior of its main character, this film seems to be racing towards the end and not caring to slow down and give the audience a chance to take a breather. He literally wills this film to be nothing but crazily entertaining.Many have called the idea for Crank as another derivative of the mid-90's action-movie Speed. I'd be the first to say that they're really not off the mark by much. Instead of a bus wired to explode if it dips below a predetermined speed, Crank puts the same premise and uses a human body instead. The human in question is one Statham's Chelios whose botching of a contract hit lands him in abit of hot water with the underworld bosses who hired him to do the job. Ambushed and knocked unconscious, Chelios soon wakes up to realize that something is definitely wrong with him. Abit of villain grandstanding from the employer he disappointed, Chelios quickly finds out that he has been injected with an exotic cocktail of chemicals which would kill him by inhibiting his body's ability to produce adrenaline. He learns from a colleague that he will need to keep his adrenaline pumping constantly to remain among the living and must do so by any means necessary. Whether he accomplishes this through extreme physical activities, drugs, and energy drinks Chelios must do them all in order to buy himself enough time to tie up lose ends in his life and to find the employers who have killed him. That is pretty much Crank's story in a nutshell.Crank doesn't take much of the film's early minutes to explain some backstory on Chelios other than him being a professional hitman. Instead writers/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor use the entire running time of the movie to gradually give glimpses into what kind of a person Chev Chelios is. With their use of handheld digital cameras and kinetic-style editing and camero shots, Neveldine and Taylor takes the premise of Crank and lets the audience ride along not just as passive viewers but almost like active participants. The in the now look of the film with some shots angled so that they're almost in first-person or over the shoulder views doesn't look as gimmicky as it sounds. One film this year that compares to Crank in terms of unique filmmaking for an action-movie it would be Running Scared that was released earlier this year. Both take the action-flick conventions and dare to rise above it either through a dark fairytale style that was Running Scared or the manic, darkly amoral humor that gives Crank such an exhilirating sense of pacing.The one thing that people will remember most about this movie is the many action sequences that happen throughout the film. With their decision to use handheld digital cameras, Crank's action sequences take on an almost hyperkinetic look to them. Again this film shares some similarities with Running Scared with how its action sequences are shot with such inventive use of angles and framing not to mention in-your-face violence. Crank has less of the surreal quality of Running Scared and more of a live newscast. In fact, at times I felt as if I was watching a news crew vainly chasing after Statham's character as he paints the Los Angeles with non-stop adrenaline-pumping violence and activities. Whether its him getting into an outnumbered free-for-all brawl with a certain inner-city gang or having a very impromptu, unexpected and thoroughly indecent display of public affection with dozens in witness, Crank's amoral and sense of active nihilism makes this film a most politically incorrect one. There's a scene involving a taxi driver that was wrong on so many levels yet it invoked some of the biggest laughs and reactions from myelf and the audience around me.The violence comes hard and fast and unlike Statham's past couple of Transporter flicks, there's nary a martial art choreographed fight scene to be seen. No, Chelios is an action-flick character who attacks and fights with sudden directness and brutality with as little movements required as possible. Chelios doesn't need kung fu or karate moves to take out an opponent when a a well-placed kick, punch, elbow, etc...is all that's needed to put a man down. Crank's action sequences also had no CGI used (something I learned prior to seeing the film) with Statham doing most of his stunts. This wouldn't be too much of a big deal until one factors in the fact that one of the action pieces takes place in a helicopter flying a thousand or so feet above the street of LA. Statham must have quite a steely pair if there's truth behind him doing that helicopter fight with no greenscreen CG trickery or wire-fu assistance used.Outside of Statham the rest of the cast took to their roles with a relish and had fun with them. And as with every action-flicks the hero will need a foil to motivate him. Statham's Chelios has his opposite number in Verano played with thuggish calculation by Jose Pablo Castillo. Then there's Doc Dwight Yoakam as Doc Miles. Chelios' acquiantance whose knowledge of all things chemical borders on the absurd but in Crank makes it work. But the other performer who stood out outside of Jason Statham has to be Amy Smart as Chelios' ditzy but well-meaning girlfriend, Eve. She plays this character to the hilt and seem to be having a ball while doing so. Her outdoor scene of PDA with Statham and a follow-up scene during a car chase shows me that Ms. Smart was pretty game about going all the way with how to protray her character.I won't mention too many more details on what actually happens in the film since I think its best to see it for oneself. Words can't really describe the sheer insanity and fun mayhem this movie puts up on the big-screen. The story may not be too original and it's lead may not be the best actor out there, but what Statham lacks in acting proficiency he more than makes up for sheer charisma and old-school machismo that's way too rare in action-flick actors nowadays. Crank is more than your run-of-the-mill action movie. The creativity shown by writer/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor gives Crank a unique look and their attempts to try new techniques succeeds more than it fails. But in the end this film lives and dies on the shoulders of Jason Statham who I must say is the action-hero of this new generation of actors. For those who enjoyed Running Scared earlier this year they won't be disappointed by Crank. This flick is one hell of a ride.",4,"Drugs, sex, adrenaline makes Crank one hell of a ride",1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,8202,"['seeing', 'trailer', 'Crank', 'first', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'was',

Jason Stratham is fun to watch even if the rest of the film feels a little flimsy [especially if you watch a more serious crime film like the Departed either before or after you see this].

1031047,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000K7UBSO,Boss Fan,"[52, 57]","Say this for ""Crank,"" it definitely isn't boring.  And it is certainly original and audacious.  It is also ridiculous and will not hold up under any scrutiny.  I, however, dismiss all logical criticisms of this movie, and any like it, with a wave of the hand.  This movie exists solely to pop, rock and shock the audience.  It is fake, over the top, ridiculous and outrageous.  And that is precisely why it is one of the freshest, funniest and best pure action flicks in a long while.  Sure there are more studied and complex action thrillers out there, but this is the most fun, junk-action pic this side of ""Road House"" and its cult action ilk.  Not just a dumb campfest though, mind you; oh it's certainly none too brainy, but it has aspirations to shock and thrill beyond just having a bunch of guys shoot at each other or crash cars into things.  There is a lot of that here, but the scenarios that spawn such things have to be seen to be believed.  Ditto this movie.  Everything here is taken to another level.  Logical restrictions be damned.  And the movie, and audience, is better for it.There is, of course, already a movie called ""Speed,"" and a terrific one at that; but had the title not been taken, this film would personify truth in advertising had it been able to use it.  In a plot similar to the Keaue Reeves VS the bus classic, hitman and all around bad-a*s (we know this because he grimaces and talks in one of those threatening whispers ala Clint Eastwood and Steven Seagal) Jason Statham is injected with a virus known as ""The Beijing Cocktail"" that will explode his heart if its rate drops too low.  You can only imagine all the different things he uses to keep his heart rate consistently above average:  from waffle irons to nasal inhalers, deliberators to public sex, surfing atop motorcycles to jumping out of windows, the movie takes the `everything but the kitchen sink approach' and exploits the full potential of this outlandish premise, right up to its climax, which manages to feel truly bizarre, even for a movie in which you thought you've seen everything that could possibly come off as bizarre already.  Yep, it just keeps on pushing those genre conventions.Statham is good in a role that basically requires him to play the transporter again, although he loses his cool far more often in this film and spews far more expletives.  However, if one were to imagine the Transporter's reaction to being injected with this type of poison, this is pretty much how we would expect his reaction, and the film, to play out.  Amy Smart is good too in a minimalist role.  Strong, stylish direction helps.  If you're movie is essentially a cartoon already, cartoonish staging of the action is pretty much a key to making it work.  The film is in on its own joke, which is a good thing.  Rather than sell any of this as plausible, everyone involved simply goes with it.As much as I dug this film, it admittedly won't be everyone's cup of tea.  However, if you are someone who complains that action movies have become too generic, here's a big present for you.""Crank"" is often laugh-out-loud funny, jaw-on-the-floor audacious, and also manages to wring suspense out of its many close calls, and it never forgets to throw in a surprise here and there to keep things spicy.Sounds like a five-star action pic to me.(This DVD includes a feature called ""family friendly audio"" which, according to the description on the back of the DVD jacket, allows the viewer to ""enjoy the film without the usual expletives.""  This might be a great feature for a romantic comedy or a drama of some educational value that you may want the kids to see and just wish there were a few unnecessary expletives blurted out, but on this movie this feature is as ridiculously amusing as the film itself.  Yeah, block out the swear words for the kids, but let them see all the sex, nudity, and violence.  There is no way to make a movie like this family friendly (and it should not be - that is one of its main allures).  If you are a parent and all you care about is that your child does not hear some foul language, but the rest of the stuff they are going to see in films like this is okay, then you seriously have your priorities screwed up.  So, I'm not sure why this feature is here.  It just stuck me as so ridiculously odd and pointless I had to point it out (I'm sure others who see this will be thinking the same).  But it's one more sign that in everything right down to the film's DVD technical features, ""Crank"" is an absurd, hilarious action classic.)",5,One Helluva Wild Ride - Buckle Up!,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,4557,"['Say', 'Crank', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'boring', 'certainly', 'original', 'audacious', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'will', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'however', 'dismiss', 'logical', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'wave', 'hand', 'movie', 'solely', 'pop', 'rock', 'shock', 'audience', 'fake', 'top', 'ridiculous', 'outrageous', 'precisely', 'why', 'one', 'freshest', 'funniest', 'best', 'pure', 'action', 'flicks', 'long', 'while', 'Sure', 'are', 'more', 'studied', 'complex', 'action', 'thrillers', 'there', 'most', 'fun', 'junk-action', 'pic', 'side', 'Road', 'House', 'cult', 'action', 'ilk', 'Not', 'just', 'dumb', 'campfest', 'mind', 'oh', 'certainly', 'none', 'too', 'brainy', 'aspirations', 'shock', 'thrill', 'just', 'having', 'bunch', 'guys', 'shoot', 'other', 'crash', 'cars', 'things', 'lot', 'here', 'scenarios', 'spawn', 'such', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Ditto', 'movie', 'Everything', 'here', 'taken', 'level', 'Logical', 'restrictions', 'be', 'damned', 'movie', 'audience', 'better', 'course', 'already', 'movie', 'called', 'Speed', 'terrific', 'one', 'had', 'title', 'not', 'been', 'taken', 'film', 'would', 'personify', 'truth', 'advertising', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'use', 'plot', 'similar', 'Keaue', 'Reeves', 'VS', 'bus', 'classic', 'hitman', 'bad-a*s', 'know', 'talks', 'one', 'threatening', 'whispers', 'ala', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'injected', 'virus', 'known', 'Beijing', 'Cocktail', 'will', 'explode', 'heart', 'rate', 'drops', 'too', 'low', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'different', 'things', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'consistently', 'average', 'waffle', 'irons', 'nasal', 'inhalers', 'deliberators', 'public', 'sex', 'surfing', 'atop', 'motorcycles', 'jumping', 'windows', 'movie', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'approach', 'full', 'potential', 'outlandish', 'premise', 'right', 'up', 'climax', 'feel', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'even', 'movie', 'thought', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'come', 'off', 'bizarre', 'already', 'Yep', 'just', 'pushing', 'genre', 'conventions.Statham', 'good', 'role', 'basically', 'play', 'transporter', 'again', 'cool', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'film', 'spews', 'far', 'more', 'expletives', 'However', 'one', 'were', 'imagine', 'Transporter', 'reaction', 'being', 'injected', 'type', 'poison', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'would', 'expect', 'reaction', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'good', 'too', 'minimalist', 'role', 'Strong', 'stylish', 'direction', ""'re"", 'movie', 'essentially', 'cartoon', 'already', 'cartoonish', 'staging', 'action', 'pretty', 'much', 'key', 'making', 'work', 'film', 'own', 'joke', 'good', 'thing', 'Rather', 'sell', 'plausible', 'everyone', 'involved', 'simply', 'it.As', 'much', 'dug', 'film', 'admittedly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'However', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'generic', 'here', 'big', 'present', 'Crank', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'jaw-on-the-floor', 'audacious', 'also', 'wring', 'suspense', 'many', 'close', 'calls', 'never', 'throw', 'surprise', 'here', 'there', 'keep', 'things', 'five-star', 'action', 'pic', 'DVD', 'feature', 'called', 'family', 'friendly', 'audio', 'according', 'description', 'back', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'viewer', 'enjoy', 'film', 'usual', 'expletives', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'feature', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'drama', 'educational', 'value', 'may', 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'expletives', 'blurted', 'out', 'movie', 'feature', 'ridiculously', 'amusing', 'film', 'Yeah', 'block', 'out', 'swear', 'words', 'kids', 'let', 'see', 'sex', 'nudity', 'violence', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'main', 'allures', 'are', 'parent', 'care', 'child', 'not', 'hear', 'foul', 'language', 'rest', 'stuff', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'films', 'okay', 'then', 'seriously', 'have', 'priorities', 'screwed', 'up', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'feature', 'here', 'just', 'stuck', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'odd', 'pointless', 'had', 'point', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'same', 'one', 'more', 'sign', 'everything', 'right', 'down', 'film', 'DVD', 'technical', 'features', 'Crank', 'absurd', 'hilarious', 'action', 'classic']",N/A

Some new stuff like the car on the escalator was interesting, as was watching a hero tear around town with/without a motorcycle dressed only in an open-back hospital gown. I liked the action, don't even mind a bunch of gangsters (including their guards) failing to notice a rival group standing there with various armaments waiting to gun them all down.Plot: Hero has been injected with a poison designed to kill him within the hour. It doesn't explain how a hitman, used to the dangers of his life is taken out so easily. Anyway, he finds out accidently that keeping the adrinalin going somehow staves off the effects of the drug. He spends about 98% of the film tearing around town, finding ways to keep his heart pounding, and trying to get to his doctor (played surprisingly well by Dwight Yokem -- who'd a thought it?).The major flaw here is attitude toward women and it is appalling. Apparently this was indeed made for manly men. You know the type: women are only good for one thing, by golly, and until we need 'em, we'll just stash 'em in a big glass bowl..??  Amy Smart's big scene was in the public sex catagory and I don't know how she felt doing the scene, but I cringed. A pretty girl, decent actress, and THIS is the best the script could do for her?

Not satified with dragging her all over town in his efforts to keep the adrenaline flowing, he stops in the middle of Chinatown, in front of men, women, and children and insists on the humilation and degradation of public sex. Worse still -- and who would have thought that possible -- she eventually gets into it! (YEECH!!) I guess getting shot at, beating up thugs, and watching your friends die just wasn't doing the trick.

1031053,A2AVH5HXH2TYWA,B000K7UBSO,CADJewellerySkills,"[1, 1]","(Warning: mild spoilers, but none of this should come as any surprise.)It's not every day you have fans of low-brow, almost grindhouse action movies and esoteric art geeks both sitting together and enjoying the same movie. I would argue that not only is this movie an insanely over-the-top ultraviolent romp, it's a brilliant addition to post-modernist cinema.Within the first three minutes of the movie, the plot violently shifts into 5th gear. Our hero Chev Chelios (Jason Statham with a psychotic and desperate look in his eyes) quickly learns he must keep his adrenaline up to prevent the poison in his system from stopping his heart. This leads to one set piece after another of increasing absurdity-- snorting lines of coke off the floor of a public toilet, driving a car up an escalator, and violent headbanging to ""Achy Breaky Heart"" to name a few. And that's just the first twenty minutes!The fact the movie manages to stay in overdrive literally all the way to the last shot (It's no spoiler alert to tell you he dies, as the blurb on the sequel says ""He died, but he got better"".) is a testament to the many good qualities about this movie, such as consistent and effective pacing, Statham's commanding screen presence, and the delightfully twisted imagination the film-makers bring to Chev's increasingly implausible choices of action to stay alive.This is where the post-modernist touches come in. Past a certain point in the movie (around half-way in), the suspension of disbelief is pushed to such a tenuous point that we start to wonder if the director is poking fun at the Hollywood stereotype of the invincible hero. Let's face it: If we're watching Jason Statham standing on a motorcycle moving at 60+ mph in a hospital gown while he has a massive adrenaline-shot-induced erection, all while Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin"" is blasting on the soundtrack, the director must be laughing.All these increasingly surreal set pieces are balanced rather well by Statham's ability to act the part. Moreso than even ""Snatch"", I'd hold up this movie as evidence that Statham is well-suited to take over as successor to Michael Caine's original British badass.On a side note, Amy Smart holds her own remarkably well as the ordinary girlfriend who chose the wrong guy, and learns to adapt as the madness escalates.

1031074,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000K7UBSO,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[7, 9]","'Crank' is much different than most action movies. It actually has a plot, and although the plot is not explained throughout the movie and never gets any deeper than, say, a large boat in a swimming pool, it is still very different. It is also unexpectedly hilarious. There are many moments throughout the movie where something will happen that's either grotesquely violent or mildly tragic, and then something funny will happen to completely make you forget that, and focus you on something else. There's another odd element in the movie. Efren Ramirez, who was last seen in the Mormom comedy 'Napoleon Dynamite' plays a drag queen who does his part in dispatching some bad guys. Right now, this may sound like some crazy, run-of-the-mill action movie, and it isn't. 'Crank' is non-stop action. I don't remember when it slowed down. The movie goes like this: car chase, plot setup, foot chase, shootout, car chase, motorcycle chase, shootout, sex scene, stripper scene, car chase, stripper scene, shootout, helicopter fight.'Crank' is unashamedly violent and politically incorrect. It relishes the violence it depicts, showing characters getting their fingers and backs of their heads blown off in slow motion. This is a movie that will become a cult classic just because of how daring it is. There's constant drug use, constant graphic violence, and some of the most gratuitous language I've ever heard in a movie. It was constant language, and constant violence. Not to mention the sex. The mere fact that this movie can get away with a public sex scene, as well as about a dozen nude women, shows that the MPAA must be softening. Perhaps it's because the violence is not to be taken seriously. In one scene, a guy shoots another guy using his index finger and thumb posed in a gun position. The same goes for the sex. During a car chase, which I always find is the perfect time for sex, the woman stops midway, saying 'Oh please. Why should I keep going? So you can fall asleep like always? Drive the [...] car!'The plot is established early on, and is rather novel for an action movie. Hit man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) has been injected with a ""Beijing Cocktail"", says his doctor, Doc Miles (Dwight Yokam). It's a mixture of alot of drugs, which, on their own, are not deadly, but put together, Chev has around an hour to live. Unless, as he finds out, he keeps his adrenaline going. So, Chev evades the police, takes on a gang, snorts cocaine, gets blasted with a life support machine, crashes a motorcycle, and gets high off nasal spray to stay alive long enough to kill Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who injected him with the poison, and Verona wants to find Chev because Chev is responsible for his brothers death.With 'Crank', we might have the second coming of the gritty, violent 1980's action movie. The movie (which is supposed to be a video game, not a real story) is peppered with little eccentricities. A character will be talking to another on the phone while running down a hall, and on one of the walls we see the image of what the person on the other end of the line is doing. It's done so (on walls, mirrors, dashboards, and TV's) so that most people will miss it unless they make a habit of noticing strange things in movies. It would be nice to see Jason Statham do movies other than action movies. True, he did 'Snatch', and while that wasn't necessarily an action movie, there was a whole lot of killing in it. He needs to do something like 'Hollywoodland' or 'The Weatherman'. It's quite obvious that he would be great in something like that, but he needs to depart from shoot 'em up movies first.'Crank' is a great, very original movie. It's a relief to see that in this day of watered down PG-13 horror movies, that there are still some movies that break the barrier of good taste and just do what they want. Because of that, 'Crank' succeeds in exciting it's viewers, and perhaps reigniting the action genre.84 minutesRated R for continuous strong, graphic violence, pervasive language and drug use, nudity, and sexuality.",5,An Interesting Concept,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,4056,"[""'Crank"", 'much', 'different', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'actually', 'plot', 'plot', 'not', 'explained', 'movie', 'never', 'deeper', 'say', 'large', 'boat', 'swimming', 'pool', 'still', 'very', 'different', 'also', 'unexpectedly', 'hilarious', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'grotesquely', 'violent', 'mildly', 'tragic', 'then', 'something', 'funny', 'will', 'happen', 'completely', 'make', 'forget', 'focus', 'something', 'else', 'odd', 'element', 'movie', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'Mormom', 'comedy', ""'Napoleon"", 'Dynamite', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'part', 'dispatching', 'bad', 'guys', 'Right', 'now', 'may', 'sound', 'crazy', 'run-of-the-mill', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", ""'Crank"", 'non-stop', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'slowed', 'down', 'movie', 'car', 'chase', 'plot', 'setup', 'foot', 'chase', 'shootout', 'car', 'chase', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'shootout', 'sex', 'scene', 'stripper', 'scene', 'car', 'chase', 'stripper', 'scene', 'shootout', 'helicopter', 'fight', 'unashamedly', 'violent', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'violence', 'showing', 'characters', 'getting', 'fingers', 'backs', 'heads', 'blown', 'off', 'slow', 'motion', 'movie', 'will', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'just', 'how', 'daring', 'constant', 'drug', 'use', 'constant', 'graphic', 'violence', 'most', 'gratuitous', 'language', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'constant', 'language', 'constant', 'violence', 'Not', 'mention', 'sex', 'mere', 'fact', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'public', 'sex', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'dozen', 'nude', 'women', 'MPAA', 'must', 'be', 'softening', 'Perhaps', 'violence', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'one', 'scene', 'guy', 'guy', 'using', 'index', 'finger', 'thumb', 'posed', 'gun', 'position', 'same', 'sex', 'car', 'chase', 'always', 'find', 'perfect', 'time', 'sex', 'woman', 'midway', 'saying', ""'Oh"", 'please', 'Why', 'should', 'keep', 'going', 'can', 'fall', 'asleep', 'always', 'Drive', '[', ']', 'car', ""'The"", 'plot', 'established', 'early', 'rather', 'novel', 'action', 'movie', 'Hit', 'man', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'been', 'injected', 'Beijing', 'Cocktail', 'doctor', 'Doc', 'Miles', 'Dwight', 'Yokam', 'mixture', 'alot', 'drugs', 'own', 'are', 'not', 'deadly', 'put', 'together', 'Chev', 'around', 'hour', 'live', 'Unless', 'out', 'adrenaline', 'going', 'So', 'Chev', 'police', 'gang', 'snorts', 'cocaine', 'blasted', 'life', 'support', 'machine', 'motorcycle', 'high', 'nasal', 'spray', 'stay', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'kill', 'Verona', 'Jose', 'Pablo', 'Cantillo', 'who', 'injected', 'poison', 'Verona', 'find', 'Chev', 'Chev', 'responsible', 'brothers', 'death.With', ""'Crank"", 'might', 'have', 'second', 'coming', 'gritty', 'violent', '1980', 'action', 'movie', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'real', 'story', 'peppered', 'little', 'eccentricities', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'phone', 'running', 'down', 'hall', 'one', 'walls', 'see', 'image', 'what', 'person', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'doing', 'done', 'so', 'walls', 'mirrors', 'dashboards', 'TV', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'miss', 'make', 'habit', 'noticing', 'strange', 'things', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'do', 'movies', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'True', 'did', ""'Snatch"", 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'killing', 'do', 'something', ""'Hollywoodland"", ""'The"", 'Weatherman', 'quite', 'obvious', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'something', 'depart', 'shoot', 'up', 'movies', 'first', ""'Crank"", 'great', 'very', 'original', 'movie', 'relief', 'see', 'day', 'watered', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'movies', 'break', 'barrier', 'good', 'taste', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'exciting', 'viewers', 'perhaps', 'reigniting', 'action', 'genre.84', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'continuous', 'strong', 'graphic', 'violence', 'pervasive', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'nudity', 'sexuality']",N/A

My husband had seen reviews, but all I knew was that it had Jason Statham in it--which is an excellent selling point.From the very beginning, it was a bit ""artsy."" Quick cuts, odd camera angles, speeding up, slowing down. Sometimes this works, sometimes it's just annoying. This time, it worked.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is an assassin, and his rival has injected him with a poison. The only thing keeping him alive is keeping his heart rate up--Chev figures this out on his own, by the way, which I liked, and it was confirmed later by his doc friend.So he's on a quest to 1) save himself, if possible, 2) protect his girlfriend, and 3) get back at the rival who's killing him.It's fast-moving, extremely violent, and surprisingly funny in spots. The... (I need to learn some film vocabulary--maybe take a beginning film class or something to learn the words for various effects) cinematic effects kept the tension high, and showed visually how the character was feeling.In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. It was loaded with pop songs from a variety of musical genres and eras, and every single song fit its scene perfectly. I know music is supposed to be a part of a film, to help evoke moods, but this soundtrack was practically a character in itself.And of course, you have Jason Statham, who's perfect in the role--cold-blooded killer, patient and sweet with his girlfriend (Amy Smart, who was nicely subtle as a woman whose boyfriend has just told her he's an assassin--she wasn't the bimbo I'd have expected, nor did she steal her scenes).It's kind of like... Kill Bill meets Speed. Stylized violence, comic effects, and non-stop action. The premise is a little hard to swallow, but I didn't have any time to dwell on it before I got yanked into the action.One thing it's not, is for kids. Way too much violence.

1031078,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000K7UBSO,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[4, 4]","Though Crank comes off as just a decently made B-movie, you have to give credit for the creativity of this film.  Jason Statham is the star, and if you enjoyed his role in the Transporter films you shouldn't have too much trouble appreciating his performance here.  However, don't expect any martial arts action, nor the level of action in either of the Transporter films.  But what keeps Crank interesting aside from Statham's performance is the fast-pacing of the film, the creative style of directing, and the unique style of humor.Chev Chelios has been poisoned with some Chinese stuff, at the very start of the film.  For the remaining 85 minutes of viewing time, Chelios has to figure out how to stay alive to get revenge on the guy who poisoned him and to say goodbye to his girl (Amy Smart).  The movie feels even shorter because 9/10 of it is fast-paced, extreme adrenaline, and the directing aids this quite well.  We get the feeling of running with Statham down the streets or the halls of a hospital.  And as Statham downs more and more red bulls and whatever else weird stuff to keep his heart rate up, the directing gives us the feeling of being seriously tripped out like the character.  Sometimes the picture gets blurry, the soudtrack suddenly changes to an unexpected tune, or random subtitles appear on the screen that don't always make sense.  At the same time, it adds a bit of humor to the film, though some people may take the movie too seriously with all its vulgar language etc to find anything amusing about it.Unfortunately the excitement ends with Statham's character and the fast-paced directing.  There is practically no story, no character depth, weak dialouge, and very average acting.  Crank is basically a movie that serves best as a buddy flick, and certainly a great choice for a late night film that will keep you from falling asleep.

From cocaine sniffing, to high speed car chases, to some more extreme activities that I won't spoil and which have to be seen to be believed, Chelios is prepared to do anything in order to stay alive long enough to save his drug addled girlfriend (Amy Smart) and exact revenge on his would-be killer.""Crank"" borrows heavily on ""Speed"" and ""D.O.A"", but takes these stories one step further.

1031089,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000K7UBSO,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[5, 6]","I wanted to like this movie.  I really did, and I've been debating with myself since I've seen it whether I should give this two or three stars.  I really just thought this was okay, but overall I'll probably never really want to watch this again.  If something really has no re-watch value for me, does it really deserve that extra star?  The answer to my decision should be obvious by now and I'll go into a little more detail why.First things first, I have to say I did enjoy the underlying story line and the concept behind why Statham's character had to keep his adrenaline pumping.  Basically Statham is playing a hitman and a rival gang or group of some kind wasn't pleased with his last hit.  So they snuck into his house and injected him with something and the only way to prolong it is to keep his heart rate up.  Naturally Statham isn't going to sit and die peacefully.  He's going to get revenge and that revenge has to happen sooner than later before he actually dies.  Frankly, as kind of goofy as that all sounds, I liked it.  Cool premise to setup an over the top action packed movie.  I wouldn't expect much character depth based on the stories premise, but I really wasn't expecting a whole lot, so it succeeded in that.  Frankly if you want to watch this movie you want to see action.  If not, then you probably shouldn't bother with it.  As in other Statham films it does have a bit of comedic value added in.  The comic relief comes in with his girlfriend who doesn't really know he's a hitman.  So amidst his antics of trying to protect her, because for some reason all the henchmen know they're going out, he also has to make it look like he's not a hired killer at the same time.So, doesn't sound too bad of a film for that action junkie in all of us.  The problem I really had is that the story line is really rather loosely put together.  There's a lot of ""intrigue"" between groups that could have happened and been developed, but since Statham could die at any moment they kind of skip over this fact and move the film right along.  It's fast paced and action packed, and for this film that means a lot of details get left untold.  I can accept a lot of these misgivings for the premise of the film, but it's still annoying with no real background to the character, you're just thrust into this situation.  There are tidbits here and there, but not enough to answer all the questions.  The other problem was that this is basically the same as the Transporter.  The format, the pace, Statham's acting/character.  All pretty much the same concepts!  The way they pretty much cut and pasted the concepts was kind of annoying, plus I actually thought Transporter 2 had a better story and that movie was totally absurd, but it was fun.  This movie was also fun, but it wasn't the same kind.  It felt like they were trying to outdo even the absurd action and concepts that show up in Transporter 2 and I just felt that was a little unnecessary, so it was like ""lets replace story with more action, people like action.""  Actually, people like a good story blended with action.  This could have been a really cool story, but it didn't hold together for me in the end.  Frankly if you want absurd action with Statham kicking the crap out of people I'd recommend Transporter 2, the first Transporter really wasn't very good and the two story lines have almost nothing to do with each other.  That's all I've got on this movie, worth seeing once I suppose, but hopefully now you know what to expect.",2,Another outrageous action flick starring Statham,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,3515,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""'ve"", 'been', 'debating', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'should', 'give', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'really', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'overall', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'something', 'really', 're-watch', 'value', 'really', 'deserve', 'extra', 'star', 'answer', 'decision', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'why.First', 'things', 'first', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'enjoy', 'underlying', 'story', 'line', 'concept', 'why', 'Statham', 'character', 'had', 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'Basically', 'Statham', 'playing', 'hitman', 'rival', 'gang', 'group', 'kind', 'was', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'last', 'hit', 'snuck', 'house', 'injected', 'something', 'only', 'way', 'prolong', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Naturally', 'Statham', ""n't"", 'going', 'sit', 'die', 'peacefully', 'going', 'get', 'revenge', 'revenge', 'happen', 'sooner', 'later', 'actually', 'Frankly', 'kind', 'goofy', 'sounds', 'liked', 'Cool', 'premise', 'setup', 'top', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'character', 'depth', 'based', 'stories', 'premise', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'succeeded', 'Frankly', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'action', 'not', 'then', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'other', 'Statham', 'films', 'have', 'bit', 'comedic', 'value', 'added', 'comic', 'relief', 'girlfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'hitman', 'amidst', 'antics', 'trying', 'protect', 'reason', 'henchmen', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'out', 'also', 'make', 'look', 'not', 'hired', 'killer', 'same', 'time.So', ""n't"", 'sound', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'action', 'junkie', 'problem', 'really', 'had', 'story', 'line', 'really', 'rather', 'loosely', 'put', 'together', 'lot', 'intrigue', 'groups', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'been', 'developed', 'Statham', 'could', 'die', 'moment', 'kind', 'skip', 'fact', 'move', 'film', 'right', 'along', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'lot', 'details', 'get', 'left', 'untold', 'can', 'accept', 'lot', 'misgivings', 'premise', 'film', 'still', 'annoying', 'real', 'background', 'character', ""'re"", 'just', 'thrust', 'situation', 'are', 'tidbits', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'enough', 'answer', 'questions', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'basically', 'same', 'Transporter', 'format', 'pace', 'Statham', 'acting/character', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'concepts', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'cut', 'pasted', 'concepts', 'was', 'kind', 'annoying', 'actually', 'thought', 'Transporter', '2', 'had', 'better', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'absurd', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'kind', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'outdo', 'even', 'absurd', 'action', 'concepts', 'show', 'up', 'Transporter', '2', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'lets', 'replace', 'story', 'more', 'action', 'people', 'action', 'Actually', 'people', 'good', 'story', 'blended', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'end', 'Frankly', 'want', 'absurd', 'action', 'Statham', 'kicking', 'crap', 'people', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Transporter', '2', 'first', 'Transporter', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'suppose', 'hopefully', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'expect']",N/A

Definitely not a film for the squeamish or the easily offended by potty mouth dialog, CRANK delivers its own brand of breakneck action and very funny comedic outtakes into a platform for the likes of Jason Statham, so well remembered for his role in Transporter/s, and a cast that gives him fine support.Chev Chelios (Statham, in fine fettle but oddly keeping his shirt on to for once cover his physique...) is a contract killer who has just snuffed a man the local drug dealers in LA are not happy about: relationships between LA and Hong Kong have been strained. As a result one peppy bodybuilder hunk named Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) injects him with an adrenaline-blocking drug that gives Chev only an hour to live.  And thus starts the action: Chev must find medication or an antidote within the hour or he will die.  Chev informs his girlfriend Eve (gifted comedienne Amy Smart) of his crisis but Eve is so ditzy she doesn't comprehend, leaving very little brain cell action to help Chev.  The story is a bit shallow but that really doesn't get in the way when the purpose of the movie is to see just how violent and how many kills and disasters can be created before the final bizarre ending.Statham and Smart make a great team, giving some of the best humor imaginable in a story that is basically humorless.  Good casting here. But also the actors who portray the ancillary parts - Cantillo as the embodiment of buff evil, Efren Ramirez as Chev's reliable ally, Dwight Yoakam as his disjointed doctor, Carlos Sanz as the head bad guy, Reno Wilson, Edi Gathegi - are finely directed by this team of Neveldine and Taylor, making sure that there is just enough parody and gag lines to keep our minds active during the barrage of mayhem.

1031095,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000K7UBSO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","SPOILERS galore, my friends.Okay, so CRANK seems to be one of those polarizing flicks; either people love it or loathe it. Not to offend the haters, but I'm firmly in the former group: I love this movie. I saw CRANK on its opening day, the noon matinee screening, and, apparently, the premise was canny enough that it drew in a nice crowd, even for so early a showing. Most of that crowd got the movie. I have to say that CRANK lived up to my expectations, which were sparked weeks before by the very cool trailer. Now, CRANK is one of those films that gratifies the short-attention-spanned MTV generation (like yours truly). It's full of quick cuts, dizzying camera zooms and pans shot from all kinds of angles. It goes at its own quirky speed and pace, so it might confuse and discombobulate those expecting your generic action formula. But, having said that, even the older folks seemed to be enjoying and laughing in all the right spots.The plot now: Jason Statham energetically plays Chev Chelios, a hitman who sometimes does jobs for the local crime syndicate. On one such gig, he finds that he's unable to ice his assignment, instead letting the vic get away unmarked. Chev wakes up the next morning, groggy and not feeling too well. It seems that a venomous local hood by name of Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) had snuck into his residence and drugged him with a lethal Chinese cocktail, from which there is no antidote. However, Chev learns that he could possibly extend his life span by a bit thru consistently maintaining his adrenalin at a high level. Since Chev isn't the type of cat to go slink to a corner, he straightaway proceeds to get his vengeance on as he simultaneously strives to keep his girlfriend safe from West Coast thuggery and hardheadedly find a cure. And with that, let the nuttiness unfold.So this was a frenetic film. With its off the wall sensibilities and off-kilter and insidious sense of humor, I could see why some folks won't be able to get on board. It's really not your typical actioner, done with a staid A-B-C mindset; it flies in the face of what's expected and that tends to put off folks. I actually expected Statham to service the fight scenes with his martial arts, but he eschews that, instead relying on the ol' reliable: the meat and potatoes use of his brawn and his firearms.Did I mention the dark, snarky comedy? Much of it lies in Chev's frantic endeavors to keep his heart pumping hard: whether it's purposely instigating a brawl with some gangbangers, headbangin' to ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" hitting himself up with resuscitation paddles, or even sniffin' da illegals. There's even that well-heralded public show of affection in Chinatown (to me, the funniest scene in the flick). Not to mention, the sequence with Chev invading the streets clad merely in his hospital gown. And those poor birds...Jason Statham has been steadily coming on to American action cinema. In recent years, his resume has included TRANSPORTER, TRANSPORTER 2, THE ITALIAN JOB, and CELLULAR. He's become the new name brand of in-your-face, no-nonsense action. He presents a burly physical presence which makes him perfect for his arse-kicking roles. Even though he was Handsome Rob in THE ITALIAN JOB, he's not what you'd call your classically handsome dude. What makes him so appealing when he plays these types of characters, whether it's a good guy or a villain, is that display of unmitigated, sullen intensity coupled with a quiet hostility. When he gets that look on his face, you just know you don't want to eff with him. Here, he amps up that intensity even further as he reaches new heights of berserk fury. Add him to that current list of action stars (Daniel Craig and even Vin Diesel and the Rock) who can decently emote whilst kicking villainous booty.In my eyes, Amy Smart can do no wrong. Amy portrays Chev's girlfriend Eve with a charming carefree ditziness. There was a chance that the aforementioned Chinatown scene would've come off as awkward and uncomfortable, but Amy is so naturally there in the moment that the audience willigly goes along. Not to mention, she and Statham have very nice chemistry as her butterfly quirkiness is juxtaposed against his laconic magnetism. Jose Pablo Cantillo plays the main baddie Verona with nice virulence, while Efren Ramirez might startle and possibly even discomfit his fans as he strays quite a ways from his quasi-iconic Pedro role. Meanwhile, Dwight Yoakam discards his sexy country singer persona, content to play a maverick doctor with a freak fetish.Bonus features include the nifty ""Crank'd Out Mode"" - wherein the viewer can experience behind-the-scenes footage, making-of insights, interviews with the cast and crew, running commentary, etc, while the movie's playing; ""Crank: Family Friendly Audio"" - an option wherein the viewer can watch the film without the cuss words; and the banging music video ""Adrenalina"" by David Rolas.Like I said, CRANK isn't for everyone. It's weird and off the wall as hell. There are sequences that are guaranteed to shock a certain percentage of the movie-watching populace. But, for those who enjoy wallowing in dark, devil-may-care humor and a relentless, high octane pace, full of frowned-upon activities, well, go get your CRANK on. It's almost as good as base jumping.",5,"""My name is Chev Chelios, and today's the day that I die.""",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,5303,"['SPOILERS', 'galore', 'friends.Okay', 'so', 'CRANK', 'be',

It really is no more than a video game in which the viewer briefly inhabits the body of Chev Chelios as he frantically tries to fight the effects of a lethal drug to get to the nasty prick who injected him with it.  Along the way, we get a whirlwind tour of LA.You can see where Neveldine and Taylor drew on everything from the classicD.O.A.to the latest Grindhouse flicks in their attempt to create a high-adrenaline film.  Jason Statham seemed like the obvious choice but his squeaky voice almost brings the movie down from the start.  However, Statham rises to the occasion showing off his kinetic form.  Unfortunately, He seems bound to an all too tight script that only allows him to break free at a few chosen moments, like the scene in the hospital when he is hoping to score a hit of epinephrine.The villains are drawn from racial stereotypes, as you would expect from Vice City, with Chev and his good doctor (amicably played by Dwight Yoakam) as the only white boys in the mix.  Chev himself is a hitman, but has told his all too sweet girlfriend (Amy Smart) that he's giving all that up to be with her, if only he can get the antidote to the ""Beijing cocktail"" he has been given.  Smartly, Eve isn't buying it at first, but soon gets with the action and is all too willing to accommodate Chev in his ever growing need for an adrenaline fix, including sex in the busy streets of Chinatown.The movie pretty much defies all logic, but obviously Nevaldine and Taylor weren't trying to connect the dots here, just moving from point A to point B in as fast a speed as they could.

Despite points where I would either drastically change a scene or just leave it the hell out, there are some fun moments, such as when Statham tries to evade police by racing his car through a mall and making it up an escalator in it, and when he runs through a hospital desperate for an adrenaline hit.Honestly, I found Statham's performance in Crank to be possibly one of his best. He continues his career with a lack of versatility the genre of movies he tends to be cast in, with the exception of the romantic comedy London, but his character is unlike any of the other generally wooden, raspy-voiced, earthily cynical characters he's played since his first role. Lock, Stock, Snatch, the Transporter films, and even Cellular showcase him in practically identical roles. In Crank, which involves gangsters, shootouts and other high-over-the-top action sequences, and a character's fatal deadline, themes that you can find in each of the films previously mentioned, he is shown in a role as an aggressive, hasty, impulsive, and highly temperamental person. I mean, when has Statham ever raised his voice or conveyed emotion in any of his films? Here, he does, and that makes it a much more likable role than if it were played by most other action stars.The film has great momentum and everything mentioned above, but depreciates greatly from the introduction of Amy Smart's token girlfriend character. She plays her role to the fullest, but the Lambourghini ride pace of the movie is severed when her screen time starts. There's also a nonsensical and completely out-of-place sequence where Statham coerces her into having sex with her, impulsively, amidst a large crowd to keep his decreasing heart rate from plundering and thus letting the poison he's been given finally worn out. That scene was a turn off to me, frankly. It and a few other scenes at around this point in the movie. In the Laws and Doctrines of the Race Against Time Movie, it states that you may not slow down. Even when the plot must take expository time, you do it in a clever way where we are still gripping our chair arms.Crank is not a work of art by any standard, but it doesn't follow formula and it keeps you entertained.",3,Jason Statham just never stops,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2637,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'husband', 'heavily', 'enjoyed', 'course', 'B', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'serious', 'not', 'critic', 'movie', 'movie', 'people', 'simple', 'plot', 'great', 'heart-pumping', 'action', 'Crank', 'superficially', 'appealing', 'opening', 'titles', 'glass-shattering', 'rock', 'music', 'once', 'movie', 'going', 'obvious', 'entry', 'race-against-', 'time', 'category', 'movies', 'points', 'where', 'would', 'either', 'drastically', 'change', 'scene', 'just', 'leave', 'hell', 'out', 'are', 'fun', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Statham', 'evade', 'police', 'racing', 'car', 'mall', 'making', 'up', 'escalator', 'when', 'hospital', 'desperate', 'adrenaline', 'hit.Honestly', 'found', 'Statham', 'performance', 'Crank', 'be', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'lack', 'versatility', 'genre', 'movies', 'be', 'cast', 'exception', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'London', 'character', 'other', 'generally', 'wooden', 'raspy-voiced', 'earthily', 'cynical', 'characters', 'played', 'first', 'role', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Snatch', 'Transporter', 'films', 'even', 'Cellular', 'showcase', 'practically', 'identical', 'roles', 'Crank', 'gangsters', 'shootouts', 'other', 'high-over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'character', 'fatal', 'deadline', 'themes', 'can', 'find', 'films', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'shown', 'role', 'aggressive', 'hasty', 'impulsive', 'highly', 'temperamental', 'person', 'mean', 'when', 'Statham', 'ever', 'raised', 'voice', 'conveyed', 'emotion', 'films', 'Here', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'role', 'were', 'played', 'most', 'other', 'action', 'stars.The', 'film', 'great', 'momentum', 'everything', 'mentioned', 'greatly', 'introduction', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'token', 'girlfriend', 'character', 'role', 'fullest', 'Lambourghini', 'ride', 'pace', 'movie', 'severed', 'when', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'nonsensical', 'completely', 'out-of-place', 'sequence', 'where', 'Statham', 'having', 'sex', 'impulsively', 'large', 'crowd', 'keep', 'decreasing', 'heart', 'rate', 'plundering', 'thus', 'letting', 'poison', 'been', 'given', 'finally', 'worn', 'out', 'scene', 'was', 'turn', 'off', 'frankly', 'few', 'other', 'scenes', 'point', 'movie', 'Laws', 'Doctrines', 'Race', 'Against', 'Time', 'Movie', 'may', 'not', 'slow', 'down', 'Even', 'when', 'plot', 'must', 'take', 'expository', 'time', 'do', 'clever', 'way', 'where', 'are', 'still', 'gripping', 'chair', 'arms.Crank', 'not', 'work', 'art', 'standard', ""n't"", 'follow', 'formula', 'entertained']",N/A

Like most Americans of my generation, TV and movies have inured me to images of violence and depravity, but ""Crank"" (and similar movies like ""The Punisher"") managed to overcome that insensitivity and simply nauseated me. It's not necessarily the subject matter; many other movies have just as much violence, sex, drug use, etc. without being so offensive. The difference is that those movies use the depiction of evil to develop a plot or character and that the demarcation line between good and evil is usually clearly understood. ""Macbeth"" is full of murder, but we know that he is an evil character and we see him get his comeuppance. Dirty Harry blasts bad guys but we know that he is doing so in pursuit of law and justice. William Wallace may slice off enemies' heads in battle but we see that he is fighting for freedom against tyranny. The difference with ""Crank"" is that this movie has no moral compass whatsoever. Its protagonist is just as evil and depraved as the people he's fighting. It throws violence and perversion in our faces ad nauseam solely to titillate the reptilian mind with violence and perversion, which is why I call it porn. Its ethic is nihilism and its view of humanity is purely animalistic. I give it 2 stars simply for its technical slickness.

That said, Amy Smart is very attractive, and who knows if that was a stand in when we got to see some of her anatomy, but the glimpse albeit a short one added to the overall viewing of the DVD release.  Of course you will need to forget what is possible and what is not possible as far as surviving horrific drugs, car chases, and gunplay, but that is what you expect when you sit down for this ride.  Basically a hit man for the underworld gets revenge and then some, and has a lovely young blonde girlfriend who is willing to have sex in public in Chinatown.  Obviously there is a sequel, ""Crank 2, High Voltage.""  Rating the first release for delivering what it promised, I'll give it 4 stars.  Dwight Yoakam stars as ""Doc"" and Valarie Rae Miller would have made my day if she was among the gratuitous eye candy that shared their assets.  In the hoodlum's lair there were a few ladies who were open minded with their upper goodies, and this too seemed appropriate to this film.

1031119,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000K7UBSO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","""Crank"" came out in 2006, got little press, and was seen by few people. This sucks, since it was one of the coolest action films of the year. Jason Statham (a great actor) plays Chev Chelios, a hit man that kills a mob boss. The next morning, he wakes up to find that an enemy of his named Verona has injected him with ""Chinese stuff"" that makes Chev feels like he's dying. According to a tape Verona has left, he is. Wanting to kill Verona before he bites the big one, Chev goes looking for him and discovers along the way that he can stay alive by keeping his adrenaline going.  To do this, he does everything you can think of. There wasn't a single moment in this movie where I was thinking, ""just do this!"" (Except, I figured he could hop on a rollercoaster), he pretty much does everything. This includes drinking Energy drinks, doing cocaine, running from cops, beating up a jubilee of black guys (yes their race was relevant to the situations), bangs his girlfriend on a busy Chinatown street, and manages to do all this while talking on his cellphone to various people like his doctor (Dwight Yoakam). As he's racing to kill Verona and, hopefully, find an antidote he also finds himself rushing to save his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart, who gets hotter in every movie...Or it could just be getting accustomed to her). While the fact that Eve doesn't know that Chev is a hitman seemed a little cliche to me, it didn't take away from how much I liked this movie. The movie has a premise that bears similarity to ""Speed"" (I've never seen it, but the synopsis sounds similar), but that doesn't matter...It's an extremely original, fast paced, and fun film to watch. Statham is a great actor (he proved that further in the 2006 drama ""London"" which got some of the worst reviews of the year and I loved it) and he works very well in actions. He combines the perfect amount of tough-guy bravado and is able to handle the comedic relief without it sounding forced. He reminds me of a young Bruce Willis. As Chev, he's perfect. The movie really surprised me though. Watching it, despite how much I enjoyed it, I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen and it didn't. The ending doesn't take the typical road of this kind of movie, nor did it take the weak way out. It's completely implausible, but is filmed in a way to hint that it's a fantasy. I'm a moviegoer that is able to look past a movie's cliches and implausabilities and enjoy it. If you look at my reviews (there's a lot of them, because I have no life), most of them are 4 and 5 star reviews.

1031120,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B000K7UBSO,- Kasia S.,"[26, 59]","I am all for action movies, adrenaline pumped stunts and combat is something I enjoy but this movie was not in my taste at all. I was surprised really, it appeared to be a fast paced action movie but instead the music was incredibly loud and very bad, some of the scenes were filmed with really annoying shaking filmed over cartoon like filters and the actor didn't really win my sympathy. He tried too hard to be cool with his raspy voice but really left me feeling like I was watching a juvenile cartoon show for people who get distracted buy some trash thrown at their feet.Basic plot revolves around Chev waking up with bad dizzy vision in his apartment staggering to his tv and watching a dvd left by his nemesis Verona. He is informed of a nasty concoction that was injected into his body which will kill him if his heart rate doesn't stay elevated. So this is the gist of the story, Chev gets up and runs out trying to do pretty much anything to keep his adrenaline pumping so he can get to Verona and punish him. He is told throughout the movie that there is no antidote yet he spends his precious time trying to kill as many people are possible. Call me crazy but if I was on my death bed I don't think revenge would be my top priority. He stops by and chats up his girlfriend who at least seems to finally get on his side and believe his story but not until the movie is almost over. The chase scenes were interesting but there were simply too many and I felt my eyes glaring at the clock to see how much longer this movie was going ot take than on the action. Also there was a rather distasteful scene involving him and his girl doing it in front of oh, about hundred people and children on the street. If that wasn't a warning that it's time to change the channel than I don't know what was. I'm no prude but I found this to be ridiculous, over the top and plainly disgusting with nothing erotic about it whatsoever.  I did finish watching the movie only to be really disappointed by the ending; the only emotion I was left with was a waste of an afternoon and a strong need to kick something.Non stop action requires more than velocity and muscles, it needs some brains mixed in with the brawn and this was flat and truthfully pretty boring. I can't find one interesting thing about the movie other than it trying to sell itself and make money with no real meat and juice dripping out of the script.- Kasia S.",1,Left me rather cranky...,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,2422,"['am', 'action', 'movies', 'adrenaline', 'pumped', 'stunts', 'combat', 'something', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'taste', 'was', 'surprised', 'really', 'appeared', 'be', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'movie', 'instead', 'music', 'was', 'incredibly', 'loud', 'very', 'bad', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'really', 'annoying', 'shaking', 'filmed', 'cartoon', 'filters', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'win', 'sympathy', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'raspy', 'voice', 'really', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'juvenile', 'cartoon', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'distracted', 'buy', 'trash', 'thrown', 'feet.Basic', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Chev', 'waking', 'up', 'bad', 'dizzy', 'vision', 'apartment', 'staggering', 'tv', 'watching', 'dvd', 'left', 'nemesis', 'Verona', 'informed', 'nasty', 'concoction', 'was', 'injected', 'body', 'will', 'kill', 'heart', 'rate', ""n't"", 'stay', 'elevated', 'gist', 'story', 'Chev', 'up', 'out', 'trying', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'can', 'get', 'Verona', 'punish', 'told', 'movie', 'antidote', 'yet', 'precious', 'time', 'trying', 'kill', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'possible', 'Call', 'crazy', 'was', 'death', 'bed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'revenge', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'priority', 'chats', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'least', 'finally', 'get', 'side', 'believe', 'story', 'not', 'movie', 'almost', 'chase', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'felt', 'eyes', 'glaring', 'clock', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'ot', 'take', 'action', 'Also', 'was', 'rather', 'distasteful', 'scene', 'involving', 'girl', 'doing', 'front', 'oh', 'about', 'hundred', 'people', 'children', 'street', 'was', ""n't"", 'warning', 'time', 'change', 'channel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', ""'m"", 'prude', 'found', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'plainly', 'disgusting', 'nothing', 'erotic', 'did', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'only', 'be', 'really', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'only', 'emotion', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'waste', 'afternoon', 'strong', 'need', 'kick', 'something.Non', 'stop', 'action', 'more', 'velocity', 'muscles', 'brains', 'mixed', 'brawn', 'was', 'flat', 'truthfully', 'pretty', 'boring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'other', 'trying', 'sell', 'make', 'money', 'real', 'meat', 'juice', 'dripping', 'script.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

This movie doesn't have much dialogue and a very simplistic story. Instead it focuses on delivering literally non-stop action through the entire movie with almost no stopping.The movie starts with Chev Chelios, your main character, watching a videotape revealing that he has been with injected with something and is going to die. In a fit of rage he begins his reign of terror. From that point on he begins his search for the men who poisoned him with what would become know through the movie as the Chinese ****. After a call to his doctor, Chev learns that the only way to slow his death is to keep his adrenaline flowing. If he slows down for anything he will begin to get dizzy and his vision will become distorted.The movie is amazing to watch. There are tons of gunfights, fighting, and car chases in this movie. When I say it's non-stop action, it really is. The movie stays different enough to keep it entertaining. You won't be watching fight scene after fight scene. Maybe you'll see him snort drugs off of the floor or have sex with his girlfriend on the side of the street. Anything he can do to keep his adrenaline up will work for him.The movie has a pretty simple story. There aren't many twists and turns. The way the story is done is well done with the combination of action and the fact that Chev is crazy and it is very humorous. I loved the way the ending was done.The extras are done in a very interesting way. It's called Cranked Out mode. You play through the movie with commentary and the movie will stop to show extras. This is a cool idea and keeps up the fast-paced idea of the movie.If you are a fan of action films then you have to pick this one up.

Swanson,"[4, 5]","4.5 starsCrank is classic because it simultaneously mocks and glories in action flick cliches, and then takes them all the way home.It opens with intensity and never lets up; I can think of few movies that have so little slack. 90 minutes is plenty for most shooters, and the editors keep it tight and fast all the way through.There are some truly unique moments here---the backwards subtitles are a first, I believe---that highlight that this is a MOVIE! It never takes itself too seriously, and that's where it succeeds. There's technique and attitude to spare; this directing team will make some great films in years to come, I'm betting.There's plenty of shooting but the violence is rather comic in context, and never grates on me like most gun porn does after an hour or so. Statham is perfect; he's the hoodlum James Bond and plays it to the hilt here. He's becoming a master at juxtaposing action and humor, and is due to be the next Bruce Willis, but with more edge and less cheese.The other highlight is Jose Cantillo, who is excellent as the villain (one of them...not many good guys here!). This is one of the best villain portrayals I've seen in years; he and Statham have crackling energy as adversaries, and Cantillo's very real nastiness plays well in such a goofy movie.Visually wild and unrelentingly intense, Crank is one of the most entertaining shoot 'em ups of the last decade, mainly because it understands what it's supposed to be: a stylish thriller with tongue always in cheek.{Edit: 5/14/10. Just watched the blu-ray and it looks very fine indeed, no doubt due to this movie being shot in HD digital. The image is super crisp and just makes this hilariously goofy movie that much more intense. The extras are good as well, lots of new ones with plenty of interviews with writers/directors Neveldine/Taylor. After seeing how Statham did almost all his own stunts I was evne more impressed, ditto for Taylor's amazing camera work on rollerblades. Risky stuff that paid off well in the film. The commentary is visual in-screen during the movie and is quite interesting. All in all, an excellent BD package.If you liked this at all, check it out on blu-ray.

However, this movie was just a mess. There are certain parts of it that are just way over the top. First of all, I wanna know who's idea was it to put in the movie that Chevy and his girlfriend put on a live sex show in the middle of the street with an audience watching as a means to keep the adrenaline rush? Because whomever decided that would be a good idea to put in the movie should be fired immediately. That was horrible and unrealistic at the same time. I was like..what the hell? I guess the sick thing is she was enjoying it as he was ripping her clothes off in front of a crowd and she's not the one who needed the adrenaline rush. The other sick thing is that the people were actually watching this and getting off on it, and on top of that it made the news. Secondly, Chevy and this same chick are running from the bad guys, and this chick stops in the middle and says ""I forgot to take my birth control pills"" what the hell? Thirdly, I still don't understand what was the point behind having these women in huge bubbles on the roof of the building. Fourth, he runs around the whole movie trying to keep his adrenaline up so his heart wouldn't stop beating when that wasn't what killed him. Chevy did a 50 million feet swan dive out of the sky and still had time to call his girlfriend and leave a message on her answering machine while he's falling to his death.

Her amazing lack of understanding to what's happening around her makes the violence comic as in the sequence where she drops her purse while Chev dispatches numerous assailants without her being aware.  The scene downtown where he flips up her skirt and has back door relations before a busload of ogling Japanese schoolgirls is hysterical, even if it is quintessentially poor taste.  Dwight Yoakam gives a nice supporting performance as Doc Miles who keeps coaching Chev on how to stay alive.  Directors Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor keep the thrills moving a mile a second.

Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hit man who one day wakes up and realises that he was injected with ""Beijing Coctail"", a deadly poison which is very quickly killing him - in fact he has minutes to live! There remains however one chance for him to survive - as long as he manages to keep his adrenaline level very high, the poisoning doesn't progress and therefore he may have a chance to find an antidote. But if he let's his adrenaline level drop to a regular level, he is dead meat...What follows is 90 minutes of a tough guy running through the city, frequently in a hospital gown, with a raging erection poorly hidden from the public view. During this time the guy will get into an incredible number of fights and incidents, will kill numerous people (but all of them bad guys), will frighten countless women, snort coke, pilfer hospital supplies, cause vehicle accidents, commit robberies, start fires, abuse a defibrilator, horribly insult ethnic and sexual minorities, have VERY public sex with Amy Smart, hold surrealistic phone conversations with his doctor, confront Triads, LAPD, black gangs, Latino gangs, Japanese tourists, etc., all to the appropriately fast paced rhytm of an AMAZING soundtrack!WARNING: the kind of humour displayed in this film will probably mostly appeal to men... Also, the amount of verbal obscenities is such that some DVD players may not support it...)))I am the first to admit that this whole film is in fact just a surrealistic exercise in accelerated nonsense - but GOSH, DID I HAVE GOOD TIME WATCHING IT!

As in the Transporter movies, he has the ability to knock people down and keep them down with a few well aimed kicks. So many ""action"" movies these days are filled with CGI, or the action hero is so old, that out of shot, he's leaning heavily on his zimmer frame. (Of course I'm not gonna name names here.)Crank is probably an unbelievable plot, with a guy getting injected with something that will slow down his heart rate and eventually stop it, unless he keeps his adrenaline up. (Leading to some very interesting scenes of actually seeing his heart inside his body beating fast or slow. Not literally his heart mind you.) So leads to a very fast paced movie, R-rated, which means Jason Statham can swear as much as he likes, without people fainting at the merest hint of the F word. How exactly does Chev Chelios (a name which I cannot take seriously, never mind pronouce) keep his adrenaline pumping? Beat up a few bad guys, take cocaine, take some other random drug from a random taxi driver, run around streets like a madman, drive through a shopping mall, and most importantly, get it on with his girlfriend (Amy Smart) - right in the middle of a street. And strangely enough, in front of a bus full of Japanese girls. Be prepared for that scene, you might be a bit hot & flustered afterwards. Go Jason Go!However, the film did start to run out of steam towards the end, and I did get a bit bored. But only right towards the end. It's pretty fast paced, but I felt the run up towards the ending could have been done better. And I hated the ending. I was actually disappointed and I do believe my jaw dropped. Am I seeing things through rose tinted glasses, cos I actually wanted a happy ending for this film? But as my boyfriend did say, ""Well, it's hardly like in Titanic, Jack resurfaces and says that he was just a bit chilly."" Yeah thanks for that babes.I was quite happy to see Amy Smart finally pulling away and settling into more adult films, unlike some her past movies (Road Trip, Butterfly Effect, Varsity Blues). Lets hope she stays successful with this, as few actresses who start off in more teeny, crude jokes movies can make the transition.Crank is a film I will probably get on DVD when it comes out, as I can't wait to see it again.

Statham has a swagger like no other, and the bull-necked stride he uses to catch up to his prey in his TRANSPORTER movies is awesome.However, CRANK just didn't deliver.  It, like its protagonist, had an erratic heart rhythm.  At times the movie sailed for short bursts, then it collapsed under its own weight.Statham stars as Chev Chelios, a hitman who's been injected with a Chinese poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops to a resting beat.  He has to find ways to stay amped up throughout the movie or die (as if having a death threat hanging over his head wouldn't automatically do that).With that premise, Statham kills, crashes, attacks, and confronts everything and everyone that gets in his way as he struggles to keep his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) out of harm's way and get his pound of flesh in revenge.  The action lags a little from time to time despite the pressure and push of the situation, and it's far too easy to get confused over who's who and what's going on.The movie was written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, both of whom have a mass of credits in the film business in stunts, photography, acting, and special effects.  They definitely knew the audience they were going for, and they went for the throat.I just didn't buy into Statham's character even though I was predisposed to like him.  The character was too thin and there wasn't anything to root for.  I didn't feel like I ever got to know him.  Everyone else around him were cardboard cutouts.Stunt-heavy, the didn't quite come together in that area either.  I missed Statham's martial arts, not that he does them in every movie, but we were left with endless gunfights and violent action that was more brutal than choreographed.Even when the plot came together at the end, impossibilities stack on each other to the breaking point.  There was no way everything could have gone down the way the movie showed it.  The final confrontation at the end would have been impossible to pull off without some of Chelios's enemies knowing what was coming.In the end, CRANK is a decent watch for a guy's night out.  It comes with a ""family-friendly"" version on the disc, but the overall story isn't family friendly by any stretch of the imagination, and it's too watered down for action fans.",3,Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,2450,"['love', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'movies', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'flair', 'did', 'Statham', 'swagger', 'other', 'bull-necked', 'stride', 'catch', 'up', 'prey', 'TRANSPORTER', 'movies', 'awesome.However', 'CRANK', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'protagonist', 'had', 'erratic', 'heart', 'rhythm', 'times', 'movie', 'sailed', 'short', 'bursts', 'then', 'collapsed', 'own', 'weight.Statham', 'stars', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'hitman', 'who', 'been', 'injected', 'Chinese', 'poison', 'will', 'kill', 'heart', 'rate', 'drops', 'resting', 'beat', 'find', 'ways', 'stay', 'amped', 'up', 'movie', 'die', 'having', 'death', 'threat', 'hanging', 'head', 'would', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'do', '.With', 'premise', 'Statham', 'crashes', 'attacks', 'confronts', 'everything', 'everyone', 'way', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'Eve', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'harm', 'way', 'get', 'pound', 'flesh', 'revenge', 'action', 'little', 'time', 'time', 'pressure', 'push', 'situation', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'get', 'confused', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Neveldine', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'whom', 'have', 'mass', 'credits', 'film', 'business', 'stunts', 'photography', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'definitely', 'knew', 'audience', 'were', 'going', 'went', 'throat.I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Statham', 'character', 'even', 'was', 'predisposed', 'like', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'thin', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'root', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ever', 'got', 'know', 'Everyone', 'else', 'were', 'cardboard', 'cutouts.Stunt-heavy', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'together', 'area', 'either', 'missed', 'Statham', 'martial', 'arts', 'not', 'movie', 'were', 'left', 'endless', 'gunfights', 'violent', 'action', 'was', 'more', 'brutal', 'choreographed.Even', 'when', 'plot', 'came', 'together', 'end', 'impossibilities', 'stack', 'other', 'breaking', 'point', 'was', 'way', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'way', 'movie', 'showed', 'final', 'confrontation', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'pull', 'off', 'Chelios', 'enemies', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'coming.In', 'end', 'CRANK', 'decent', 'watch', 'guy', 'night', 'out', 'family-friendly', 'version', 'disc', 'overall', 'story', ""n't"", 'family', 'friendly', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'too', 'watered', 'down', 'action', 'fans']",N/A

Like its doomed hero, the movie is pumped with adrenaline and just when it seems to slow down, it shifts into overdrive and delivers ample exemplary action scenes.The story follows a hitman who is given a ""Beijing Cocktail"" after he doesn't follow his latest assignment and decides to retire.  This cocktail is going to kill him; his only hope it to keep moving, keep his adrenaline going so that he won't die.  It's all pretty hopeless for our antihero but he does do his best to keep both himself and the audience pumped up and ready to go.What makes this movie work is the deadpan but straight on performance from British actor Jason Statham (TRANSPORTER movies, CELLULAR).

1031147,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000K7UBSO,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 6]","Definition of the word ""crank"": [KRANGK]:1) An unbalanced person who is overzealous in the advocacy of a private cause. Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hitman charged by West Coast Crime Syndicate boss Carlito (Carlos Sanz) with assassinating a rival gang leader, Don Kim (Keone Young). In a fit of revenge, Chelios' rival Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) injects him with a ""Beijing Cocktail"" while he's sleeping.  Verona really, really hates Chelios - the kind of hate that goes beyond simply murdering his foe. The Cocktail will kill Chelios in one hour if he doesn't keep his adrenaline up. As the movie cheerfully explains, there are three ways to keep said adrenaline up: fear, rage, and sex. So Chelios sets out to destroy the man who destroyed him, buying himself just a little more time through a series of increasingly reckless attempts to keep his adrenaline up.2) A nasal decongestant used illicitly for its euphoric effects. The most obvious, and the first tactic Chelios resorts to, is drugs.  He snorts them. He injects them.  He snorts them again, all under the orders of his Mafia doc.  This may be the first action movie that has a pro-drug message: Hey, at least it's keeping your heart rate up!3) To increase the volume of an electronic device. Crank is loud.  Big, dumb and loud, filled with kicking beats, whip cuts, video game flashes, surreal moments reminiscent of Naked Lunch (Chelios is, after all, under the influence of a great many drugs). Sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on over all the swearing and the explosions.  Statham awesome martial arts talents are completely wasted here, with a few punches and a neck-break or two.  Even his reputation as a driver is underplayed, although perhaps smashing a car through a mall and landing it on an escalator counts.What's not quite as cool is the homophobia, misogyny, and racism on full display.  Chelios' flamboyantly gay contact Kaylo (Efren Ramirez) doesn't know how to fight even when he tries to help and then gets tortured, all the while being spat on with homophobic slurs.  Chelios' girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) who never picks up her cell phone because she doesn't have one, hangs around her apartment all day stoned out of her mind, and stupidly believes Chelios' claim that he's a video game programmer. Throughout the escalating attacks that Chelios tries to keep from her, Eve blathers on about shopping and her nails and her clothes.  When Chelios sexually assaults her (remember that third way to keep his adrenaline up?), Eve gives in. Then they rut in the street before an alternately horrified/curious crowd of Asians.  Because apparently it's not as squicky if you do it in front of people of a different race who don't speak the same language as you.4) To turn and twist; zigzag. Chelios carves a murderous path towards his foe.  In the process he picks fights with thugs, robs a convenience store, and hijacks a hospital.  But there's a twist, you see: Chelios never KILLED the Tong leader!  See?  Chelios is actually a nice guy!  Shouldn't we forgive him for all the killing and the attempted rape?Instead of sharing this plot twist at the very last moment, it telegraphs the whole scene much too early.  We already know Kim is alive well before the ""twist"" happens.  Which concludes, thankfully, with Chelios grappling Verona as they plunge to their deaths from a helicopter.4) Bogus; false; phony. But the movie's not over yet.  Oh no, not yet.  Instead of splattering like a bloody pancake batter when he hits, Chelios BOUNCES off a car, landing in front of the camera, nostrils still flaring, eyes still blinking, as his heart beats once more.And that's when we know this is a joke.  If it wasn't clear, the credits concludes with a badly pixilated video game sequence of Chelios shooting bad guys, picking up power-ups, and his digitized beating heart.  So all those drugs Chelios took?  Power ups. All those bad guys Chelios killed?  Points.  That time limit on his heart?  That was the time limit on the video game.Chelios bounced off the car because the movie is a commentary about what a video game in real life might look like.  Or rather, what a certain style of video game might look like.  Except nowadays, even Grand Theft Auto has more pathos and plot than this tripe.Crank earns an additional star for the irony.  But that doesn't make it a good movie.",2,"Misogynistic, homophobic, racist, violent, dumb, and loud (spoilers)",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,4382,"['Definition', 'word', 'crank', '[', 'KRANGK', ']', ':1', 'unbalanced', 'person', 'who', 'overzealous', 'advocacy', 'private', 'cause', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'hitman', 'charged', 'West', 'Coast', 'Crime', 'Syndicate', 'boss', 'Carlito', 'Carlos', 'Sanz', 'assassinating', 'rival', 'gang', 'leader', 'Don', 'Kim', 'Keone', 'Young', 'fit', 'revenge', 'Chelios', 'rival', 'Ricky', 'Verona', 'Jose', 'Pablo', 'Cantillo', 'Beijing', 'Cocktail', 'sleeping', 'Verona', 'really', 'really', 'Chelios', 'kind', 'hate', 'simply', 'murdering', 'foe', 'Cocktail', 'will', 'kill', 'Chelios', 'one', 'hour', ""n't"", 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'up', 'movie', 'cheerfully', 'are', 'three', 'ways', 'keep', 'said', 'adrenaline', 'fear', 'rage', 'sex', 'Chelios', 'sets', 'out', 'destroy', 'man', 'who', 'destroyed', 'buying', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'series', 'increasingly', 'reckless', 'attempts', 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'up.2', 'nasal', 'decongestant', 'used', 'illicitly', 'euphoric', 'effects', 'most', 'obvious', 'first', 'tactic', 'Chelios', 'resorts', 'drugs', 'again', 'orders', 'Mafia', 'doc', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'action', 'movie', 'pro-drug', 'message', 'Hey', 'least', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rate', '3', 'increase', 'volume', 'electronic', 'device', 'Crank', 'loud', 'Big', 'dumb', 'loud', 'filled', 'kicking', 'beats', 'whip', 'cuts', 'video', 'game', 'flashes', 'surreal', 'moments', 'reminiscent', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Chelios', 'influence', 'great', 'many', 'drugs', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'swearing', 'explosions', 'Statham', 'awesome', 'martial', 'arts', 'talents', 'are', 'completely', 'wasted', 'here', 'few', 'punches', 'neck-break', 'two', 'Even', 'reputation', 'driver', 'underplayed', 'perhaps', 'smashing', 'car', 'mall', 'landing', 'escalator', 'counts.What', 'not', 'quite', 'cool', 'homophobia', 'misogyny', 'racism', 'full', 'display', 'Chelios', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'contact', 'Kaylo', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'fight', 'even', 'when', 'help', 'then', 'tortured', 'while', 'being', 'spat', 'homophobic', 'slurs', 'Chelios', 'girlfriend', 'Eve', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'cell', 'phone', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'apartment', 'day', 'stoned', 'mind', 'stupidly', 'Chelios', 'claim', 'video', 'game', 'programmer', 'escalating', 'attacks', 'Chelios', 'keep', 'Eve', 'blathers', 'shopping', 'nails', 'clothes', 'When', 'Chelios', 'sexually', 'remember', 'third', 'way', 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'up', 'Eve', 'Then', 'rut', 'street', 'alternately', 'horrified/curious', 'crowd', 'Asians', 'apparently', 'not', 'squicky', 'do', 'front', 'people', 'different', 'race', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'you.4', 'turn', 'twist', 'zigzag', 'Chelios', 'murderous', 'path', 'foe', 'process', 'fights', 'thugs', 'robs', 'convenience', 'store', 'hospital', 'twist', 'see', 'Chelios', 'never', 'KILLED', 'Tong', 'leader', 'See', 'Chelios', 'actually', 'nice', 'guy', 'Should', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'killing', 'attempted', 'rape', 'Instead', 'sharing', 'plot', 'twist', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'telegraphs', 'whole', 'scene', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'already', 'know', 'Kim', 'alive', 'well', 'twist', 'happens', 'Which', 'thankfully', 'Chelios', 'grappling', 'Verona', 'plunge', 'deaths', 'helicopter.4', 'Bogus', 'false', 'phony', 'movie', 'not', 'yet', 'Oh', 'not', 'yet', 'Instead', 'splattering', 'bloody', 'pancake', 'batter', 'when', 'Chelios', 'BOUNCES', 'off', 'car', 'landing', 'front', 'camera', 'nostrils', 'still', 'flaring', 'eyes', 'still', 'blinking', 'heart', 'once', 'more.And', 'when', 'know', 'joke', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'credits', 'badly', 'pixilated', 'video', 'game', 'sequence', 'Chelios', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'picking', 'up', 'power-ups', 'digitized', 'beating', 'heart', 'drugs', 'Chelios', 'took', 'Power', 'ups', 'bad', 'guys', 'Chelios', 'killed', 'Points', 'time', 'limit', 'heart', 'was', 'time', 'limit', 'video', 'game.Chelios', 'bounced', 'car', 'movie', 'commentary', 'what', 'video', 'game', 'real', 'life', 'might', 'look', 'rather', 'what', 'certain', 'style', 'video', 'game', 'might', 'look', 'Except', 'nowadays', 'even', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'more', 'pathos', 'plot', 'tripe.Crank', 'additional', 'star', 'irony', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

You watch CRANK for--1. Jason Statham, in or out of a car, mostly in, mostly fighting, mostly scowling and being ridiculously testosterony.2. To see what loony thing they can do with a car, a crash, a gun, a knife, or whatever other lethal implement is at hand3. To watch bad guys get it4. To hear kicking music while human beings run around like mad for who knows what purpose most of the timeIn those terms, CRANK does its job. It's high energy. It's got funny bits--the ending is actually a morbid hoot. The camera makes you dizzy now and then. It's got loud, driving music. It's got fights. It's got a very strange bit with a car and an escalator. (I assumed the escalator bit was coming. I had not guessed the details of the how.)Jason Statham does action well. He's got the physique and the angular bone structure and the ""I'm trouble"" look in the eyes down pat. He's quite a hunk in a rough and laconic way. So, okay, if you dig Jason, you're more than half-way to enjoying CRANK.Ultimately, though, it's dumb and absurb and, when it comes to how women fare in the film, really insulting. There's not even a competently villainous, brainy woman in there. No, apparently, the double X-ers are only good for sitting around topless or wanting to be banged in public. I dunno. Maybe the director/writers spend a lot of time watching hip-hop videos, cause that's the way females come across in this film--decorative and underdressed and mostly with nothing to say. Bimbos without a plan.While you're watching this, you may be both jazzed at the fast pace and annoyed (I was) at the portrayal of women. When it's done, it really came down to just a bit of  forgettable adrenaline on film (okay, a lot of adrenaline on film), that wouldn't have worked AT ALL without the presence of Statham and that guy who playeed Verona (who reminded me of Cuba Gooding in a way).If you don't expect much other than action, noise, and Statham's he-man with a glint in his eye and his hands on the wheel or on the gun performance, and if you can overlook its treatment of women as mere T&A;, you can have some fun with it.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 4]","I've always considered Jason Statham more along the lines of being the next big action hero than say, Vin Diesel, but as the above Amazon review states, he's better at being the anti-hero.  Because two Transporter films weren't enough already, Statham plays a hitman named Chev Chelios (love that name) in Crank.  He's been given a ""Beijing Cocktail""; meaning he's been poisoned and the only way to keep the virus from killing him quicker is to keep his adrenaline up.  This means doing all sorts of insane things, whether it be driving at high speeds, shooting, or getting naughty in public with his girlfriend (Amy Smart in a hapless role).  What sets Crank apart is it's ultra violent, over the top action sequences which must be seen to be believed.  Not to mention the equally over the top, campy performances from everyone involved; all of which help make Crank a bona-fide guilty pleasure that's so bad it's enjoyable.  Statham himself is equally enjoyable as he scowls his way through the film in a role that just seems to suit him oh so well.

The only way he can stay alive is if he keeps himself full of adreneline.  This is done by drinking energy drinks, receiving epinephrine, and just living life very fast.  His character's hope before death is to find the people who did this to him.  Let's get this out of the way: the plot isn't really important to the filmmakers.  It's merrily a vehicle for them to shoot this rather stylistic film.  They even admit to that in the DVD commentary.Crank is short on plot, and with the exception of Statham, who is just all too cool an action star now, the acting isn't really that great either.  What makes this film fun to watch is its pure style.  Without sounding like an ad for the film, it is a pure adreneline ride.  Beyond that, however, the film makers have some very inspired sequences including an odd scene involving subtitles.  The action sequences are fun, even if their outlandish.But don't expect a masterpiece.  This is eye candy.  What makes the movie special though isn't a series of ""gee whiz"" special effects.

Crank is about a hit man named Chev Chelios (Jason Statham of Transporter 1 and 2), who messes up one of his jobs and lets the guy get away. The next morning when he wakes up he realizes he has been drugged. While Chev was sleeping, one of the town thugs named Ricky Verona had injected him with a lethal Chinese drug called the Beijing Cocktail which will kill him in one hour. Chev now is fighting for his life, and must be constantly moving by keeping his adrenalin pumping or his heart will stop and he will die. Crank is a movie that is way over the top at times and even sometimes just plain silly, but it keeps your attention and entertains you the entire time. Many people have criticized this movie for being too over the top, fake, ridiculous and outrageous. I agree with them but to a point.  This movie is one action packed thrill ride with a crazy sense of humor. Crank has so much blood and violence at times that you find yourself just grossing out at all the blood and hacking off of body parts. On the other hand the humor and action are what give a great balance to this movie, and I mean some crazy humor. If you like action packed movies with non stop action and in the tradition of Running Scared and Kill Bill check out Crank.DVD Special Features:CRANK'D OUT MODE!

It is movie that is virtually devoid of any of the more intangible qualities we look for when we go to a movie:  coherent plot, logical characters, the ability to guess how much time is passing, etc.It tells the story of a hitman named Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) who has apparently run afoul of a local (Los Angeles) crime syndicate and has been injected with a drug that will kill him by destroying his heart.  In order to delay his inevitable demise, Chev must keep himself on the run and adrenalized all the time.  He decides to use the few high-strung hours he has left to exact revenge for his own murder.  Along the way, he will visit with his girlfriend (Amy Smart) and also seek a cure.  But mostly, he will do outrageous things to keep his heart going.It's a silly, simple premise...yet CRANK renders it almost incoherent.  And the incoherence feels like the POINT of the film.  There is NO buildup...it starts almost immediately with Chelois in dire straits...and never quits.  The film appears to be edited by a madman, and to have been filmed by an insane person with a love for constantly changing film stock, exposures, and color saturation.  No one is allowed (nor asked) to create a believable character.  We ""sympathize"" with Chelois, not because he's a good person, but because we're forced to spend every instant of the movie with him...often in great close up.  He causes a great deal of death and mayhem on his quest, often to innocent bystanders.  As he catches up with various ""bad"" guys, he dispatches them with relish...but never stops to take a breath.  CRANK is mayhem caught on screen.It's not exactly a great movie...as you may have guessed.  But by golly, it accomplishes its mission.  There is never a moment when you doubt that everyone involved doesn't know EXACTLY what kind of film they're making.  The whole thing is designed to get YOUR heart racing in a crazy delirium.  It simply moves all the time.  Loud music, crazy camera angles, sped up film, sweaty faces.  Everything designed to put you in Chelois' shoes.  And this crazy mash-up actually works...and works well.Statham, while not exactly called upon to act, is nearly perfect here.  He looks angry and strong and he also looks like the 20 Red Bulls he has guzzled really have strung him out.  He feels like his heart is about to explode out of his chest.  His shaved head, stubble, casual dress and terse manner all make for a unique hero...a hero who is utterly unbelievable and yet somehow so relatable.  Amy Smart is equally ridiculous as the girlfriend.  She's a sweet and empty-headed blonde...and you know there is NO way her path would ever have crossed with Chelois.  The two of them have a very public, mildly graphic and totally hilarious and implausible sex scene.  (Something to do with keeping Chev's adrenaline pumping!)  Dwight Yoakum plays the world's sleaziest doctor...and all the other minor characters are completely stereotypes...but that's good, because we don't care about their characters...nor do we have TIME.  This film is on speed, and we're simply whisked along for the ride.CRANK has NO redeeming social value, and it darn proud of it.  It has virtually no moments that are credible in the real world.  But it has a crazy style that has never been equaled for its sweaty, drug-fueled intensity.  All this hard work is in the service of a reprehensible plot (if you take time to think about it)...but there is simply no denying the craftsmanship.  It's a film that never pauses to take a breath.  If what I've described sounds like fun to you...then it probably will be.  Just enter at your own risk.

Borrowing story, plot line, dialogue, logic from graphic novels, the writers/ directors do little to try to ground the film in reality. And it works, providing an adrenaline rush much like that required of hitman Chev Chelios (Statham) to stay alive.Chelios (Statham) wakes up one morning and finds a DVD sitting on his television labeled with a message that gets his attention. He can't figure out why he feels like he has been drugged, but watching the DVD, he learns that Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), a rival, knocked him out the previous night, and injected a synthetic Chinese drug into his veins. The drug will slowly cause his heart to stop and he will die. He learns that Verona has done this because Chelios killed a Chinese businessman and gangster, at the request of his boss, Carlito (Carlos Sanz). Chelios also learns that he might be able to prolong his life if he keeps the adrenaline pumping through his veins. Fear, pain, sex can all help. He sets out to exact revenge on Verona and frequently has to stop and provide his heart with a form of stimulation, in order to keep going. Eventually, he reaches Eve (Amy Smart), his drugged out girlfriend who has been sleeping for the last hour and saves her just as Verona's men are about to kill her. Will Chelios be able to exact revenge? Will his doctor, Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), a seedy practitioner who probably has no license, make it back from Vegas to help his stay alive?Written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, ""Crank"" is the latest in a line of action vehicles starring Jason Statham, the tall Brit who first came to our attention in the films of Guy Ritchie. Since then, he has appeared in supporting roles in many films, but also manages the occasional starring role. These films all have one thing in common; there is little basis in reality. In ""The Transporter"" films, created by Luc Besson, Statham plays a sort of bodyguard who transports valuable cargo. In each film, his cargo is stolen and he has to get it back, leading to some amazing, yet over the top car chases and action sequences. Now, in ""Crank"", he plays a resourceful assassin living in Los Angeles. One morning, he wakes up and finds out that a rival has essentially murdered him, but he only has a certain amount of time to live. Naturally, he isn't going to sit around, he is going to exact revenge. So he rushes to his car and speeds away, looking for Verona. As he drives, his vision begins to blur, his heart begins to beat a little strangely (which we can watch, because the filmmakers have helpfully provided close ups of many details throughout, both relevant and not so relevant) and he starts to crash into vehicles and eventually drives into a shopping mall causing panic.""Crank"" isn't the type of film requiring actors, at least to act. The actors play characters, but they rarely exhibit more than one facial expression or emotion. Statham's character never does anything but grimace. Smart's character shows the most range, from drugged out to barely conscious, but her character only appears for a brief period, late in the film. Everyone else is somehow related to gangs or crime, so they all appear tough and ornery, snarling or frowning throughout.""Crank"" is the type of film that you go to hoping for some impressive action sequences and the film delivers. Really, anything else would just get in the way. And it is also the type of film that you expect to take these same sequences to an extreme. Anything else would be a disappointment. So, when Chelios drives his car into a mall, it is sort of humorous, because he is talking to someone on his cell phone and when they ask where he is, he replies ""I'm just at the mall"". But just driving through the mall isn't going to cut it. The sequence has to end in a neat and unusual way. And it does providing laughter.At one point, Chelios steals a motorcycle from a cop. But merely driving the motorcycle through the streets wouldn't cut it. He has to wear a hospital gown and ride the motorcycle standing on the seat, his butt showing through the crack in the robe. Don't ask. It wouldn't make sense if you did. The filmmakers play fast and loose with logic creating a fun, fast paced story.""Crank"" is also a product of the `kitchen sink' school of filmmaking. They throw in everything, whether it makes sense or not, hoping for something to stick. Chelios learns from his doctor that he needs a drug called Epinephrine, to counteract the effects of the drug the gangster gave him. As they talk, the word appears on the screen. Throughout, as Chelios announces he has to find someone, the screen shows a Google map and zeroes in on this persons location. At key points, we watch Chelios heart beat. We even get to see the heart beat of a pigeon. Not sure why. Does it matter?There is also a lot of humor in the film. Considering the outlandish nature of the story and the acting, this isn't surprising, but the filmmakers take this to another level all together. Remember I said that Chelios needs to provide his heart with adrenaline and a number of things provide this? One of those things is sex, so when he feels his heart slowing down and realizes his girlfriend (Smart) is with him; he knows what he has to do. It doesn't matter that he is in the middle of a busy street in Chinatown.""Crank"" is rated R and for good reason. The film is filled with language, nudity (both female and male) and violence. I probably just sold some tickets to the film. But it happens in such a cartoonish universe that no one can really take any of it seriously. At one point, Chelios visits his boss, Carlito, at his penthouse. Naturally, Carlito is going to have a bunch of beautiful young women sitting around the pool topless. But because we expect these types of things to happen, and they do, the filmmakers have added small twists to each of these scenarios. When Carlito decides to take a swim, he is surprised to find Chelios at the other end of the pool, underwater, waiting for him.""Crank"" is not a great film; I can't help but think what Luc Besson, the king of these silly action films, might have brought, but it is an entertaining film, which will clearly appeal to the male population, giving them an adrenaline boost and making them feel a little more like a man, for a few hours.",3,"3 1/2 - Great, over the top action in a comic book setting",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,6515,"['Crank', 'newest', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'starring',

1031184,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000K7UBSO,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Chev Chelios is arguably Jason Statham's best known character and Crank is arguably his best known film, but it is far from his best film. Chev Chelios (Statham) is a gun for hire, who will work for anyone who can pay him. One day he wakes up in a daze and finds a video in which a former employer tells him, that he poisoned him with a rare adrenaline inhibitor, which will kill him in a few hours. Chelios goes out seeking revenge, but must keep his adrenaline pumping, in order to slow the poison down. It's a strange story, but as usual, Statham is terrific, playing his most extreme character. Chelios is a crazy man who goes to extremes, however that's all this film has to offer. Non-stop action can sometimes be fun, but when it's the same thing repeating over and over again for 90 minutes, even the biggest action fan gets tired of it. Statham is paired with Amy Smart who starred in my favorite movie of all-time, The Butterfly Effect, and surprisingly she was terrible! She plays Chelios's girlfriend, a girl who is as dumb as dirt and who follows this crazy man blindly through the city on his hunt for revenge. Crank has some humor and a terrific leading man, but unfortunately, there isn't much of story. Besides Statham's well known one-liners and his ridiculous moves, there is really nothing to see here. Crank is one of those films that starts out strong and then just never goes anywhere. Having seen a lot of Statham's movies lately, I was hoping his best known film would be his most exciting, but it wasn't. It's the same scene repeated many times over, and I was tired of it after a half hour.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1617,"['Chev', 'Chelios', 'arguably', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'best', 'known', 'character', 'Crank', 'arguably', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Statham', 'gun', 'hire', 'who', 'will', 'work', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'One', 'day', 'up', 'daze', 'video', 'former', 'employer', 'poisoned', 'rare', 'adrenaline', 'inhibitor', 'will', 'kill', 'few', 'hours', 'Chelios', 'out', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'must', 'keep', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'order', 'slow', 'poison', 'down', 'strange', 'story', 'usual', 'Statham', 'terrific', 'playing', 'most', 'extreme', 'character', 'Chelios', 'crazy', 'man', 'who', 'extremes', 'however', 'film', 'offer', 'Non-stop', 'action', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'fun', 'when', 'same', 'thing', 'repeating', 'over', 'again', '90', 'minutes', 'even', 'biggest', 'action', 'fan', 'tired', 'Statham', 'paired', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'starred', 'favorite', 'movie', 'all-time', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'terrible', 'Chelios', 'girlfriend', 'girl', 'who', 'as', 'dumb', 'dirt', 'who', 'crazy', 'man', 'blindly', 'city', 'hunt', 'revenge', 'Crank', 'humor', 'terrific', 'leading', 'man', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'Statham', 'well', 'known', 'one-liners', 'ridiculous', 'moves', 'really', 'nothing', 'see', 'here', 'Crank', 'one', 'films', 'out', 'strong', 'then', 'just', 'never', 'anywhere', 'Having', 'seen', 'lot', 'Statham', 'movies', 'lately', 'was', 'hoping', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'exciting', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'scene', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'tired', 'half', 'hour']",N/A

Jason Statham plays a professional killer Chev Chelios, who is injected with a lethal dose of poison. To stay alive, he must keep his increased adrenaline flow by doing whatever excites his body and mind - guns, car chases, etc. and headbanging in a taxi if he really needs it.The film's opening five minutes tell Chev (and us) who really poisoned him, so the thin story of ""Crank"" does not have big surprises. That itself is not a bad thing, but still the weak script and unmemorable supports (except Dwight Yoakam's droll doctor) cannot be ignored even though Jason Statham's considerable charisma that made him internationally famous with ""Transporter"" remains mostly intact throughout.And if you're looking for the well-choreographed actions of ""Transporter,"" please remember this. The actions here are done with frantic pace, shot sometimes with slanted HD camera, so it's more like watching someone else's video games. Though lots of bullets fly over the hero's head, the film is not as thrilling as it should be, perhaps because of the lack of better choreography and skillful editing. Also, Amy Smart (""Road Trip"" ""The Butterfly Effect"") appears as Chev's girlfriend, but the film does not seem to know how to incorporate her character into the story, and the film's brief `love scene' is not something that would advance her career.All in all ""Crank"" is an entertaining film with mindless fun.

1031197,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000K7UBSO,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 7]","In my time on this Earth I've seen lots of action movies of pretty much every stripe, but none have been as flat-out bizarre and jokey as Crank, and few have even come close.  Written and directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (which is apparently comprised of a drug-addled escaped mental patient and an 11-year-old video-game addict with ADD), and starring Jason Statham as a much less upright version of the guy he played in the Transporter movies, Crank is a roller-coaster ride of nearly nonstop action and twisted humor, with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek from beginning to end.  Reliant on an almost stream-of-consciousness flow of imagery including frequent shots of its protagonist's eratically-beating heart and random, inexplicable subtitles of dialogue spoken in English, the movie's manic direction only enhances its anything-goes mentality.  This is the sort of movie that will have even the most jaded action-flick viewer avidly watching just to see what sort of twisted happening will come next.The plot, to the extent that one actually exists, centers around the improbably named Chev Chelios (Statham), an LA hitman who wakes up one morning to find that a rival has poisoned him in his sleep with some ""synthetic Chinese s***"" that will stop his flow of adrenalin until he's no more.  Naturally, this news throws Chev's life into a state of heavy disarray, forcing him to spend the rest of the movie motoring around the city trying to exact revenge on his malefactor and save the life of his attractive but less-than-brilliant girlfriend (Amy Smart, delivering a performance that's either excellent or terrible, I can't decide which).  Along the way, pretty much every taboo of the Parents Television Council crowd is indulged in recklessly--be it drug use, sex, casual racism, nudity, or gratuitously graphic violence--making Crank one of the most enjoyably offensive movies to come out since Trey Parker and Matt Stone so memorably brought South Park to the big screen almost a decade ago.I doubt rather strongly that anything depicted in this movie would ever actually happen, but then that's beside the point: it's really just an excuse for a series of outrageous set pieces indulging in (you guessed it) drug use, sex, casual racism, nudity, and gratuitiously graphic violence.  Fortunately, the filmmakers weren't short of inspiration for this movie, at least not when it comes to assaulting the audience with unforgettably ridiculous and frequently tasteless imagery.  To give away specifics would be to ruin the enjoyment, but suffice to say several scenes from this movie have remained seared into my retinas since my initial viewing a few weeks ago, and the same will likely be the case for you.  So, to sum up, while Crank is in no way anything even resembling a cinematic masterpiece, a certain corner of the film-viewing public (a corner which apparently includes this reviewer) will certainly find its ultra-politically incorrect, taste-and-coherence-be-damned approach amusing, if not much else.",3,Whoa...,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,3054,"['time', 'Earth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'action', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'stripe', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'flat-out', 'bizarre', 'jokey', 'Crank', 'few', 'have', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Written', 'directed', 'team', 'Mark', 'Neveldine', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'apparently', 'comprised', 'drug-addled', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', '11-year-old', 'video-game', 'addict', 'ADD', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'much', 'less', 'upright', 'version', 'guy', 'played', 'Transporter', 'movies', 'Crank', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'nearly', 'nonstop', 'action', 'twisted', 'humor', 'tongue', 'planted', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'beginning', 'end', 'Reliant', 'almost', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'flow', 'imagery', 'including', 'frequent', 'shots', 'protagonist', 'eratically-beating', 'heart', 'random', 'inexplicable', 'subtitles', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'English', 'movie', 'manic', 'direction', 'only', 'anything-goes', 'mentality', 'sort', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'action-flick', 'viewer', 'avidly', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'sort', 'twisted', 'happening', 'will', 'come', 'next.The', 'plot', 'extent', 'one', 'actually', 'centers', 'improbably', 'named', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Statham', 'LA', 'hitman', 'who', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'rival', 'poisoned', 'sleep', 'synthetic', 'Chinese', 's***', 'will', 'stop', 'flow', 'adrenalin', 'more', 'Naturally', 'news', 'Chev', 'life', 'state', 'heavy', 'disarray', 'forcing', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'motoring', 'city', 'trying', 'exact', 'revenge', 'malefactor', 'save', 'life', 'attractive', 'less-than-brilliant', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'delivering', 'performance', 'excellent', 'terrible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'taboo', 'Parents', 'Television', 'Council', 'crowd', 'indulged', 'recklessly', 'be', 'drug', 'use', 'sex', 'casual', 'racism', 'nudity', 'gratuitously', 'graphic', 'violence', 'making', 'Crank', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyably', 'offensive', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'so', 'memorably', 'brought', 'South', 'Park', 'big', 'screen', 'almost', 'decade', 'ago.I', 'doubt', 'rather', 'strongly', 'anything', 'depicted', 'movie', 'would', 'ever', 'actually', 'happen', 'then', 'beside', 'point', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'series', 'outrageous', 'set', 'pieces', 'indulging', 'guessed', 'drug', 'use', 'sex', 'casual', 'racism', 'nudity', 'gratuitiously', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Fortunately', 'filmmakers', 'were', ""n't"", 'short', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'when', 'assaulting', 'audience', 'unforgettably', 'ridiculous', 'frequently', 'tasteless', 'imagery', 'give', 'away', 'specifics', 'would', 'be', 'ruin', 'enjoyment', 'suffice', 'say', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'remained', 'seared', 'retinas', 'initial', 'viewing', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'same', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'case', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'Crank', 'way', 'anything', 'even', 'resembling', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'certain', 'corner', 'film-viewing', 'public', 'corner', 'apparently', 'reviewer', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'ultra-politically', 'incorrect', 'taste-and-coherence-be-damned', 'approach', 'amusing', 'not', 'much', 'else']",N/A
