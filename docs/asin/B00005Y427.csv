Much of the content is based on personal emotions involved and his relationship with Christine Hoyos, his long standing leading lady now being replaced in this production, is part of the issue. I watched a young Gades at work in Madrid in 1964 and was curious to see how he had progressed and changed.  Paco de Lucia and Gades  reprogrammed the Flamenco rythyms within the opera's score and generally, this is about how the entire dynamic production came  to be staged with an authentic FLAMENCO content.  If you are new to Flamenco it might be better to buy the full stage production first.

688699,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005Y427,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 2]","CARMEN is best known as an 1875 opera by Georges Bizet loosely based on a book by Prosper Merimee.  The title character is a beautiful but shallow and promiscuous woman who discards lover after lover.  When she attempts to discard Jose, who has sacrificed much for her and genuinely loves her, he goes into a jealous rage and stabs her to death.  The opera was originally considered an unpleasant story about unpleasant people, and critics and public alike shrugged it aside.  About twenty-five years later CARMEN was reassessed, and it is now generally regarded as one of the great operas of its era.Starring and choreographed by Antonio Gades and directed and filmed by Carlos Saura, this 1983 film translates the story into the highly stylized dance form of Spanish Flamenco--but it does so in a rather unexpected way.  Like the 1981 BLOOD WEDDING, also created by Gades and Saura, the film seems to begin as a documentary in which Gades searches for a dancer to play the title role in his new Flaminco ballet version of CARMEN.  As the film progresses it transforms into an unexpected story of a dance company whose lives and relations begin to mirror the ballet of CARMEN they are preparing.  The story alternates between rehearsals and real life until the two become deliberately confused.  At the film's conclusion it is impossible to know which is which.The dance portions of the film are nothing short of spectacular.  Unfortunately, one cannot say the same for the ""real life"" portions of the film, which are overstated, over-long, and quite often unimaginative.  At one hour and forty-five minutes, CARMEN feels very long, and the film's conclusion lacks the spectacular drama one expects from the story.  At its best it is a brilliant bit of film making, but its flaws tend to undercut its assets.  Recommended, but this mixture of documentary, dance, and art film is uneven indeed.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Reginald Garrard, Amazon Reviewer",4,Beautiful but Over-Long and Uneven,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1960,"['CARMEN', 'best', 'known', '1875', 'opera', 'Georges', 'Bizet', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'Prosper', 'Merimee', 'title', 'character', 'beautiful', 'shallow', 'promiscuous', 'woman', 'who', 'lover', 'lover', 'When', 'discard', 'Jose', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'much', 'genuinely', 'jealous', 'rage', 'stabs', 'death', 'opera', 'was', 'originally', 'considered', 'unpleasant', 'story', 'unpleasant', 'people', 'critics', 'public', 'alike', 'shrugged', 'aside', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'CARMEN', 'was', 'reassessed', 'now', 'generally', 'regarded', 'one', 'great', 'operas', 'era.Starring', 'choreographed', 'Antonio', 'Gades', 'directed', 'filmed', 'Carlos', 'Saura', '1983', 'film', 'story', 'highly', 'stylized', 'dance', 'form', 'Spanish', 'Flamenco', 'so', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'way', '1981', 'BLOOD', 'WEDDING', 'also', 'created', 'Gades', 'Saura', 'film', 'begin', 'documentary', 'Gades', 'searches', 'dancer', 'play', 'title', 'role', 'new', 'Flaminco', 'ballet', 'version', 'CARMEN', 'film', 'unexpected', 'story', 'dance', 'company', 'lives', 'relations', 'begin', 'mirror', 'ballet', 'CARMEN', 'are', 'preparing', 'story', 'rehearsals', 'real', 'life', 'two', 'become', 'deliberately', 'confused', 'film', 'conclusion', 'impossible', 'know', 'which.The', 'dance', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'real', 'life', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'overstated', 'over-long', 'quite', 'often', 'unimaginative', 'one', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'CARMEN', 'very', 'long', 'film', 'conclusion', 'spectacular', 'drama', 'one', 'story', 'best', 'brilliant', 'bit', 'film', 'making', 'flaws', 'tend', 'undercut', 'assets', 'Recommended', 'mixture', 'documentary', 'dance', 'art', 'film', 'uneven', 'indeed.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerIn', 'Memory', 'Reginald', 'Garrard', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Carmen

688701,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00005Y427,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","I saw this when it came out and its images have always lived in my imagination.  There is a seasoned choreographer of flamenco, looking for the perfect ""carmen"" in his adaptation of the classic opera into dance theatre.  At the start, it is all about what is needed for the production, opening a view into how it is organized by creative professionals.  Then, as a Carmen is apparently chosen, the personalities and rivalries of the artists emerge, pitting their ambitions and disappointments against one another, which is also part of the creative process that the choreographer is managing:  he must encourage, sanction, nurture, and even simply throw the dice as the ensemble begins to coalesce into unified team.  Finally, as the art intertwines with the lives of the performers, the choreographer loses control - or gives it up, with purpose - of the situation, all adding into the quality of the performance in spite of the personal chaos that threatens him and others.  It becomes impossible to tell what is real and what is projected emotion into the art, even the violent ending.What amazes me is that the film works so well and is completely believable - it successfully avoids the danger of becoming preposterous and cheap melodrama.  I think this is in large part because the quality of the dancing is wonderful, indeed it continually swept me into its magic all of its own, regardless of the limits of the actors.Warmly recommended.  The idea of a story around an artistic production may not be new, but this is executed to perfection.Note:  it is a pity this is not available for region 1.

688702,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00005Y427,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 3]","This is one of my all-time favorite films.  The color and dancing are spectacular but I think he most interesting and intelligent aspect of he  film is the confusion of reality with unreality; life with an opera. The film, which starts on a concrete level becomes more and more surreal as Gades slips into a form of madness--a madness, perhaps, fated by the Gods.He is obsessed with finding the perfect Carmen and...to their mutual destruction...he finds her.  Reality and the opera become increasingly intertwined until Gades distorted reality becomes more powerful than life itself.  In parallel with Bizet's Carmen, Gades falls inexplicably and helplessly in love with he faithless Carmen.  I won't write more.  You really need to see it yourself.There's only one scene I disapprove of.  Gades dances a dance that, ""changed my life and taught me about dance.""  The whole episode is an insider thing and should have been left on the cutting floor.One scene I especially enjoyed is the tobacco factory.  ""There are good and bad girls in this factory,""  The women sing.  They choose sides and go into an aggressive dance routine that must be seen to be believed.  It ends when an enraged Carmen produces a knife and slashes the throat of a rival--a rival in the opera and a rival in ""real"" life.  It's sudden and shocking.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,Arriba!!,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,1426,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'color', 'dancing', 'are', 'spectacular', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'aspect', 'film', 'confusion', 'reality', 'unreality', 'life', 'opera', 'film', 'concrete', 'level', 'more', 'more', 'surreal', 'Gades', 'form', 'madness', 'madness', 'perhaps', 'fated', 'Gods.He', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'perfect', 'Carmen', 'mutual', 'destruction', 'Reality', 'opera', 'become', 'increasingly', 'intertwined', 'Gades', 'distorted', 'reality', 'becomes', 'more', 'powerful', 'life', 'parallel', 'Bizet', 'Carmen', 'Gades', 'inexplicably', 'helplessly', 'love', 'faithless', 'Carmen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'more', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'disapprove', 'Gades', 'dance', 'changed', 'life', 'taught', 'dance', 'whole', 'episode', 'insider', 'thing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'floor.One', 'scene', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'tobacco', 'factory', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'girls', 'factory', 'women', 'sing', 'choose', 'sides', 'go', 'aggressive', 'dance', 'routine', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'when', 'enraged', 'Carmen', 'knife', 'throat', 'rival', 'rival', 'opera', 'rival', 'real', 'life', 'sudden', 'shocking.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",Carmen
