Confined to a medium consisting of almost pure cheeze, Carpenter directed a decent thriller called SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME. TV director, Liegh Micheals (Lauren Hutton) is ""stalked"" by a creep w/ a telescope and surveillance equipment. This guy is serious about his obsession, even bugging Liegh's apartment and controlling her electricity! Liegh has tried moving, changing her number to an unlisted one, etc., but nothing works. Now, with the help of her friend Sophie (Adrienne Barbeau of The Fog, Creepshow) and her new boyfriend (David Birney), Liegh sets out to catch the bothersome freak. With some obvious (and frequent) nods to REAR WINDOW and a strong, gutsy female lead, SWM is not typical tele-junk. I enjoyed Liegh's courage and her ""I'm not gonna put up with this"" attitude. Especially when she begins taking it right to her tormentor's home turf! Check it out...

1092144,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000TUDBFC,Dave. K,"[14, 17]","Someone's Watching Me is sort of the forgotten movie of John Carpenter's career. Someone's Watching Me aired back on November 29th of 1978, which was almost a month after Carpenter's career took off with the horror classic Halloween.Originally John Carpenter wrote the movie as theatrical film, but Warner Brothers decided to make it a TV movie. In my opinion I think that was the right move. Even though this movie aired after Halloween it was actually filmed prior.I have to admit I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but I don't think it would have worked as well as a theatrical film. You can clearly though see flashes of the brilliance Carpenter would show through out his career. Despite his reputation as a filmmaker who uses violence, Carpenter aims more for suspense and tension. This is a TV movie so the violence will obviously be lacking, which in some ways I think is a plus. Carpenter had to create a certain amount of tension and suspense and rely on that to make up for the lack of violence.John Carpenter has stated many times his love of Alfred Hitchcock and here he pays homage to the master of suspense with a movie clearly inspired by Rear Window. The screenplay by John Carpenter is well-written though there are some cheesy moments in the script. The structure of the script I don't think really works well as a theatrical film. Had it been a feature I'm sure there would have been changes made though.As I stated Someone's Watching Me is one of the forgotten movies in John Carpenter's career; while watching this flick you can see the potential John Carpenter had and in my opinion very much lived up to. Like I brought up earlier despite coming out after Halloween, this was shot prior to it and Carpenter really grew as a filmmaker in that short period of time. While not every single moment of the film works great, Carpenter was learning his craft and does a wonderful job.Despite being a TV movie Carpenter makes up for everything and does a solid job at creating suspense and tension through out. One of my favorite things about the movie is the phone calls. While they can be a bit creepy at times they start off as more annoying than anything. The caller isn't really saying anything that could get him in much trouble and he's actually sending gifts, which prompts Lauren Hutton's character to say something along the lines of what do I tell the police he's sending me gifts?There are a couple of creepy moments in the phone calls, but it's not really about that. It's more on the fact this guy knows her every move and that is why it gets creepy.  The 2nd half of the movie really picks up with the suspense and delivers on that area more than a lot of theatrical movies. One of the very best scenes is when Lauren Hutton's character is in the callers' house and Adrienne Barbeau is in Hutton's house. I don't wanna spoil the scene, but it was a classic John Carpenter moment.The cast delivers mostly solid performances with Lauren Hutton in the lead. Adrienne Barbeau and Charles Cyphers have supporting roles and both would work with Carpenter a couple of times.Overall Someone's Watching Me is a solid suspense/thriller early in John Carpenter's career and the potential was shown and he lived up to that. Don't expect much violence keep in mind this is a TV movie so there is only so far Carpenter can go, but like I said he makes up for that is suspense and tension.Someone's Watching Me may not be one of the best movies Carpenter has ever made, but it's a very solid one and can stand proud in his body of work. Due to the fact this movie for the longest time was not available on VHS or DVD it's rarely seen. Hopefully now with the DVD release from Warner Brothers more Carpenter fans will seek out this forgotten classic.Little bit of trivia, this movie is the first time John Carpenter and Adrienne Barbeau worked together and this is the movie in, which they first met and would later get married.",4,The forgotten John Carpenter film,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,3941,"['Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'sort', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'career', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'aired', 'back', 'November', '29th', '1978', 'was', 'almost', 'month', 'Carpenter', 'career', 'took', 'off', 'horror', 'classic', 'Halloween.Originally', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'wrote', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'decided', 'make', 'TV', 'movie', 'opinion', 'think', 'was', 'right', 'move', 'Even', 'movie', 'aired', 'Halloween', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'prior.I', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'theatrical', 'film', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'Carpenter', 'would', 'show', 'out', 'career', 'reputation', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'violence', 'Carpenter', 'more', 'suspense', 'tension', 'TV', 'movie', 'violence', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'lacking', 'ways', 'think', 'plus', 'Carpenter', 'had', 'create', 'certain', 'amount', 'tension', 'suspense', 'rely', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'violence.John', 'Carpenter', 'stated', 'many', 'times', 'love', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'here', 'homage', 'master', 'suspense', 'movie', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Rear', 'Window', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'well-written', 'are', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'script', 'structure', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'well', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Had', 'been', 'feature', ""'m"", 'sure', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'changes', 'made', 'though.As', 'stated', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'one', 'forgotten', 'movies', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'career', 'watching', 'flick', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'had', 'opinion', 'very', 'much', 'lived', 'up', 'brought', 'up', 'earlier', 'coming', 'out', 'Halloween', 'was', 'shot', 'prior', 'Carpenter', 'really', 'grew', 'filmmaker', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'great', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'learning', 'craft', 'wonderful', 'job.Despite', 'being', 'TV', 'movie', 'Carpenter', 'up', 'everything', 'solid', 'job', 'creating', 'suspense', 'tension', 'out', 'One', 'favorite', 'things', 'movie', 'phone', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'creepy', 'times', 'start', 'off', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'caller', ""n't"", 'really', 'saying', 'anything', 'could', 'get', 'much', 'trouble', 'actually', 'sending', 'gifts', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'character', 'say', 'something', 'lines', 'what', 'do', 'tell', 'police', 'sending', 'gifts', 'are', 'couple', 'creepy', 'moments', 'phone', 'not', 'really', 'more', 'fact', 'guy', 'move', 'why', 'creepy', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'suspense', 'delivers', 'area', 'more', 'lot', 'theatrical', 'movies', 'One', 'very', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'character', 'callers', 'house', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'Hutton', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'scene', 'was', 'classic', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'moment.The', 'cast', 'delivers', 'mostly', 'solid', 'performances', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'lead', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'Charles', 'Cyphers', 'have', 'supporting', 'roles', 'would', 'work', 'Carpenter', 'couple', 'times.Overall', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'solid', 'suspense/thriller', 'early', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'career', 'potential', 'was', 'shown', 'lived', 'up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'violence', 'keep', 'mind', 'TV', 'movie', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'Carpenter', 'can', 'go', 'said', 'up', 'suspense', 'tension.Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'Carpenter', 'ever', 'made', 'very', 'solid', 'one', 'can', 'stand', 'proud', 'body', 'work', 'Due', 'fact', 'movie', 'longest', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Hopefully', 'now', 'DVD', 'release', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'more', 'Carpenter', 'fans', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'forgotten', 'classic.Little', 'bit', 'trivia', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'worked', 'together', 'movie', 'first', 'met', 'would', 'later', 'get', 'married']",Someone's Watching Me

1092147,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000TUDBFC,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 9]","John Carpenter's ""Someone's Watching Me"" is a pretty boring and uneventful made-for-TV movie about a woman living in a high-rise apartment who is being terrorized by a man who continuously calls and harasses her.  Indeed, this is nothing unique although this movie was made in 1978, so let's give it a break from that standpoint.  However, ""Someone's Watching Me"" is a very boring movie notwithstanding a seemingly good plot.  When I bought this movie, I was wondering why I had never heard of it being that the great John Carpenter wrote and directed it.  Now, that I've seen it, I can understand why.In all fairness, the first thing that should be said about ""Someone's Watching Me"" is that it really is not a horror movie AT ALL!  The DVD cover and the ""Twisted Terror"" emblem all make this look like a horror movie, but do not be fooled like I was.  This movie is supposed to be a suspense thriller, but the problem is that ""Someone's Watching Me"" is devoid of any thrills and has very little suspense.  The only real suspense that is in this movie inheres in the identity of the killer, and that is about all that kept me awake.  ""Someone's Watching Me"" clumps together an endless series of boring scenes one after the other of a rather obnoxious woman played adequately by Lauren Hutton being harassed by uneventful phone calls and strange gifts from some psycho.Do not get me wrong about the plot as it seems like a good one for a horror movie, and the situation itself is a frightening one and that carries some weight, but this idea, situation and the plot itself are so poorly developed that the potential elements of horror are largely ineffective.  The bottom line is that Carpenter, for whatever reason, clearly did not do enough with this movie to make it interesting and compelling to the viewer.  Perhaps this is because ""Someone's Watching Me"" is a made-for-TV movie, but I've seen plenty of made-for-TV movies that are more thrilling, suspenseful, compelling and interesting than this one.The acting is good in ""Someone's Watching Me"" as the savvy Carpenter fan will notice Charles Cyphers (Halloween and The Fog) and Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog), both Carpenter favorites, in this movie along with Lauren Hutton.  Carpenter mistakenly assumes that the situation itself will carry this movie without much action causing a build-up in tension in the audience, but Carpenter does not do enough with the action in the movie itself to accomplish this goald.  The result is a movie that really struggles to develop the tension build-up in the audience.  Also, noticeably absent is Carpenter's characteristic score which Carpenter used so effectively in his truly great movies like ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" which was so adept at adding to the mood and theme of his great films.Unfortunately, ""Someone's Watching Me"" leaves a lot to be desired as a movie of any genre.  Even as a mystery or suspense movie, ""Someone's Watching Me"" does not have what it takes to create suspense and build tension in the audience.  There really is no escalating action that the audience can get into.  The result is a lackluster suspense-thriller with very little in the way of suspense and nothing in the way of thrills.  1.5 STARS for the idea and plot which I like, but this just goes to show you that you have to be able to execute the concept and develop the situation, and Carpenter clearly fails to get this done in ""Someone's Watching Me"", and this is most obviously why many of us have never heard of this movie.  John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors which is why I purchased this movie, but I would warn the serious horror movie fan or really anyone for that matter to stay away from this movie because you will be disappointed.  Quite frankly, almost any mystery movie on the Lifetime Movie Network would be a better viewing experience than this one.",1,"1.5 STARS: ""Someone's Boring Me""",1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,3865,"['John', 'Carpenter', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'pretty', 'boring', 'uneventful', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'woman', 'living', 'high-rise', 'apartment', 'who', 'being', 'terrorized', 'man', 'who', 'continuously', 'Indeed', 'nothing', 'unique', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1978', 'let', 'give', 'break', 'standpoint', 'However', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'very', 'boring', 'movie', 'notwithstanding', 'seemingly', 'good', 'plot', 'When', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'being', 'great', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'understand', 'why.In', 'fairness', 'first', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'really', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'AT', 'ALL', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Twisted', 'Terror', 'make', 'look', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'was', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'problem', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'devoid', 'thrills', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'only', 'real', 'suspense', 'movie', 'identity', 'killer', 'kept', 'awake', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'together', 'endless', 'series', 'boring', 'scenes', 'one', 'other', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'woman', 'played', 'adequately', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'being', 'harassed', 'uneventful', 'phone', 'calls', 'strange', 'gifts', 'psycho.Do', 'not', 'get', 'wrong', 'plot', 'good', 'one', 'horror', 'movie', 'situation', 'frightening', 'one', 'weight', 'idea', 'situation', 'plot', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'potential', 'elements', 'horror', 'are', 'largely', 'ineffective', 'bottom', 'line', 'Carpenter', 'reason', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'viewer', 'Perhaps', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'one.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'savvy', 'Carpenter', 'fan', 'will', 'notice', 'Charles', 'Cyphers', 'Halloween', 'Fog', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'Fog', 'Carpenter', 'favorites', 'movie', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'Carpenter', 'mistakenly', 'situation', 'will', 'carry', 'movie', 'much', 'action', 'causing', 'build-up', 'tension', 'audience', 'Carpenter', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'action', 'movie', 'accomplish', 'goald', 'result', 'movie', 'really', 'develop', 'tension', 'build-up', 'audience', 'Also', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'Carpenter', 'characteristic', 'score', 'Carpenter', 'used', 'so', 'effectively', 'truly', 'great', 'movies', 'Halloween', 'Thing', 'was', 'so', 'adept', 'adding', 'mood', 'theme', 'great', 'films.Unfortunately', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'movie', 'genre', 'Even', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'movie', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'not', 'have', 'what', 'create', 'suspense', 'build', 'tension', 'audience', 'really', 'escalating', 'action', 'audience', 'can', 'get', 'result', 'lackluster', 'suspense-thriller', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'suspense', 'nothing', 'way', 'thrills', '1.5', 'STARS', 'idea', 'plot', 'like', 'just', 'show', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'execute', 'concept', 'develop', 'situation', 'Carpenter', 'clearly', 'get', 'done', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', 'most', 'obviously', 'why', 'many', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'why', 'purchased', 'movie', 'would', 'warn', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'really', 'anyone', 'matter', 'stay', 'away', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'almost', 'mystery', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'viewing', 'experience', 'one']",Someone's Watching Me

1092149,AJCTGKPXYG8DY,B000TUDBFC,James Seger,"[2, 4]","I was so excited to see the 'forgotten' John Carpenter film finally getting a DVD release. He's one of my favorite directors. Unfortunately this is one of his weakest films and probably my least favorite.It's not all bad and has some genuinely tense moments, but they are few and far between. I'm not sure if John Carpenter just wasn't feeling it with this one or if it was due to the constraints of it being a T.V. movie with the constant breaks required for commercials. Whatever it is, the film is a series of peaks and valleys. The pace is off. You just don't get enough of a feeling of building tension. It's funny, because this film was preceded byAssault on Precinct 13andHalloweenand followed byThe Fogand all are excellent, suspenseful films.In this movie there are a number of good scenes. The bits with the laundry room, the park at night, the penthouse, the search of a house and the last fifteen minutes are great. But in between there are plenty of dull spots.The music was kind of irritating. I wish John Carpenter had gotten to score this one like he does most of his movies. But he didn't and the music is here seems like a swipe of better music from other suspense movies and at times was just inappropriate for the scene. The best part musically was a scene where Leigh is opening a strange package that was synched to Vivaldi's 'Winter'. That part was very well done, but also pointed out how bad the rest of the music was.Also, Lauren Hutton just didn't seem right for the part. She's a good actress and the part was written well, but the two didn't seem to connect.One highlight of the movie is Adrienne Barbeau. She is terrific in her part. It's easy to see why J.C. used her in his future movies (well, aside from their marriage). I wish she were in the movie more.Also, I applaud him for writing in a positive lesbian character. It must have been scandalous for a T.V. movie from 1978. She wasn't stereotypical, never made any 'sinister' passes at our heroine and also wasn't portrayed as the 'magical gay character'.

1092150,A2I5XLUCBTKQE4,B000TUDBFC,Kolchak the Night Stalker,"[3, 4]","""Someone's Watching Me"" was a really pleasant surprise. I've watched all the Carpenter films over the years and am a huge fan of his but by no means a Carpenter expert. I hate to admit that I never heard of this little made-for-TV movie and was thrilled to see it was on DVD.  My wife and I watched it late at night and we really enjoyed it. It is definitely not completely cut out of the usual Carpenter mold with the awesome synthesizer music and the usual mainstay actors that he re-uses, or the gore and shock value.  It is mostly a building of a feeling of terror and mystery.  There is the constant wondering WHO the stalker is? Carpenter nicely has the main character Leigh meet several men in the movie whom you believe could be the stalker/killer.  But you never really know?Charles Cyphers is in this flick and Adrienne Barbeau, both mainstays of Carpenter's films. Cyphers has been in a heap of his movies over the years playing mostly cops or bosses.  Barbeau, Carpenter's now ex-wife, plays, of all things, a lesbian! Pretty bold for 1978! LOL  Lauren Hutton, of whom I'm not really a fan, does a solid job and excels in making Leigh a quirky but likeable, strong lead female character.I thought there were some great tense moments and they were genuinely a little scary.  No blood and guts, no Michael Myers moments, but the buildup and tension, plot, dialogue, and ending were satisfying.If you're considering buying this, DO IT. It's fun for a Friday night spook thriller to watch with your lady. Break out the popcorn and watch it. It's worth the fourteen or fifteen clams and I guarantee in a few years you'll want to watch it again. It's not Carpenter's best, but it's a keeper for sure.

1092154,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B000TUDBFC,The Piper at the Gates,"[1, 4]","Being a fan of John Carpenter, I'm familiar with most of his work. However, I recently saw this film for sale in the mall, and I had never heard of it before. So I decided to buy it. After doing some research, I realized why this film is somewhat obscure. It was a made-for-TV movie written just before Halloween. And up until a couple of years ago, it wasn't available on DVD. After viewing it for the first time, there's really not much I have to say about it. It's a combination of ""When a Stranger Calls"" (for those like me, who saw that one before this one) and ""Rear Window"",the Alfred Hitchcock classic. And its easy to see the influence that Hitchcock has on some of Carpenter's early work. However, this is a made-for-TV film, so there is hardly any violence or language in this one. In some ways, I think this hurts the film, because I do find that the film is a bit un-eventful and bland for the most part. And though the ending is somewhat climatic I suppose, it just doesn't really do much for me. All in all, this is a decent little movie, definitely worth viewing a few times, and probably worth owning as well, especially if you're a Carpenter fan.

1092155,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000TUDBFC,trebe,"[1, 2]","Just prior to shooting Halloween (1979), what would become his breakout film, John Carpenter worked on the made for TV movie Someone's Watching Me (1978), which he both wrote and directed.  The film featured fashion model turned actress Lauren Hutton, as a TV producer being terrorized by an unknown stalker.  With virtually no violence until the end, the film spends most of its time trying to ratchet up the pressure, and building the level of suspense and frustration.  The effort is moderately successful, but the film moves at a very slow pace.  The perpetrator turns out to be someone completely unknown, which somewhat lessens the film's impact.A new arrival to Los Angeles, TV producer Leigh Michaels (Hutton) has just taken a luxury unit in the Arkum Tower, a high rise apartment building, and found a job at a local TV station.  Trying to settle in, she has no idea that someone has bugged her apartment, as she begins to receive crank phone calls, and the lights in her apartment mysteriously dim down.Leigh makes friends with Sophie (Adrienne Barbeau), a coworker at the station, and also begins a relationship with college professor Paul Winkless (David Birney).  She receives a letter from a company purporting to give away gifts, and a free vacation trip to a mysterious location.  A telescope arrives as a gift, and as the taunting calls continue, it becomes apparent that someone is watching her inside the apartment.  Leigh also finds notes stuck to her door, which leads to her doing some investigating.  Utilizing the telescope, Sophie and Leigh scan the surrounding buildings and spot a man with a telescope.  Finally able to get some assistance from the police, their efforts lead to a suspect with a suspicious past.  The man is driven out of town, but when Leigh spots another man using a telescope, her problems aren't over yet.The story nicely builds up the pressure, as Leigh continues to be tormented by a twisted unknown weirdo.  There is a sense of frustration, first because things develop so slowly, and then because the police totally ignore proper procedure, when Leigh witnesses a crime.  With Paul's help, Leigh gets on the trail of the only man in the entire city of Los Angeles who could be responsible.  After such an interminable wait, the final confrontation in Leigh's apartment, a brief flash of clich&eacute;d violence, is a bit of a letdown, as it is not staged or executed very well, and Carpenter makes a completely obscure character the villain.Lauren Hutton's acting performance is pretty good, except perhaps in some of the action scenes.  John Carpenter met his future wife Adrienne Barbeau making this film, and they would collaborate several more times, including The Fog (1980), and Escape From New York (1981).  Barbeau is very good, and the reliable David Birney also delivers a solid performance.With its provocative subject matter, sense of mystery, and attractive stars, it's easy to understand why Carpenter's tale of suspense was solid entertainment for the small screen at the time, though today it may seem rather tame.  Intended to fit into a two hour block, the story seems longer than it needs to be, and drags at times, but is still a decent enough watch for a TV thriller.",3,a slow burn that may be rewarding for those who wait it out...,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,3240,"['Just', 'prior', 'shooting', 'Halloween', '1979', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'breakout', 'film', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'worked', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Someone', 'Watching', 'Me', '1978', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'featured', 'fashion', 'model', 'turned', 'actress', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'TV', 'producer', 'being', 'terrorized', 'unknown', 'stalker', 'virtually', 'violence', 'end', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'ratchet', 'up', 'pressure', 'building', 'level', 'suspense', 'frustration', 'effort', 'moderately', 'successful', 'film', 'moves', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'perpetrator', 'out', 'be', 'someone', 'completely', 'unknown', 'somewhat', 'film', 'impact.A', 'new', 'arrival', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'TV', 'producer', 'Leigh', 'Michaels', 'Hutton', 'just', 'taken', 'luxury', 'unit', 'Arkum', 'Tower', 'high', 'rise', 'apartment', 'building', 'found', 'job', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'Trying', 'settle', 'idea', 'someone', 'bugged', 'apartment', 'receive', 'crank', 'phone', 'calls', 'lights', 'apartment', 'mysteriously', 'dim', 'down.Leigh', 'friends', 'Sophie', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'coworker', 'station', 'also', 'relationship', 'college', 'professor', 'Paul', 'Winkless', 'David', 'Birney', 'letter', 'company', 'purporting', 'give', 'away', 'gifts', 'free', 'vacation', 'trip', 'mysterious', 'location', 'telescope', 'gift', 'taunting', 'continue', 'apparent', 'someone', 'watching', 'apartment', 'Leigh', 'also', 'notes', 'stuck', 'door', 'doing', 'investigating', 'Utilizing', 'telescope', 'Sophie', 'Leigh', 'scan', 'surrounding', 'buildings', 'spot', 'man', 'telescope', 'Finally', 'able', 'get', 'assistance', 'police', 'efforts', 'lead', 'suspect', 'suspicious', 'past', 'man', 'driven', 'town', 'when', 'Leigh', 'man', 'using', 'telescope', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'yet.The', 'story', 'nicely', 'up', 'pressure', 'Leigh', 'be', 'tormented', 'twisted', 'unknown', 'weirdo', 'sense', 'frustration', 'first', 'things', 'develop', 'so', 'slowly', 'then', 'police', 'totally', 'ignore', 'proper', 'procedure', 'when', 'Leigh', 'crime', 'Paul', 'help', 'Leigh', 'trail', 'only', 'man', 'entire', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'responsible', 'such', 'interminable', 'wait', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Leigh', 'apartment', 'brief', 'flash', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'violence', 'bit', 'letdown', 'not', 'staged', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'Carpenter', 'completely', 'obscure', 'character', 'villain.Lauren', 'Hutton', 'acting', 'performance', 'pretty', 'good', 'perhaps', 'action', 'scenes', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'met', 'future', 'wife', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'collaborate', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'including', 'Fog', '1980', 'Escape', 'From', 'New', 'York', '1981', 'Barbeau', 'very', 'good', 'reliable', 'David', 'Birney', 'also', 'solid', 'performance.With', 'provocative', 'subject', 'matter', 'sense', 'mystery', 'attractive', 'stars', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Carpenter', 'tale', 'suspense', 'was', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'small', 'screen', 'time', 'today', 'may', 'seem', 'rather', 'tame', 'Intended', 'fit', 'two', 'hour', 'block', 'story', 'longer', 'be', 'drags', 'times', 'still', 'decent', 'enough', 'watch', 'TV', 'thriller']",Someone's Watching Me
