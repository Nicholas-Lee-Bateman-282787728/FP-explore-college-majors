For me, It was funny as in smirk funny, but not really LOL funny.  For some people, this will be a riot.  For others, a stale shaggy dog story.  I'm a little in the middle.On the surface this is In the Mouth of Madness meets Army of Darkness.  I don't think it's as threatening a premise as the former or as charming as the latter, but it does burn 90 minutes with some occasionally creative touches.  Maybe this is more Evil Dead meets Buffy.  Is it SAW meets Blade? Or is it Event Horizon meets Big Brother?  All of the above.  That's the whole point.  The ""monster's ball"" of mayhem sequence is probably the most riotous fun of Cabin in the Woods, but the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up.  The ending especially is pretty flat.  The rest of the film builds so much to it and it feels like Goddard and Whedon forgot that in referencing so much other mateiral, they really need to write something good of their own. The whole thing feels as disposable as a Big Mac container. There was a better last 2 or 3 minutes instead of what/who they threw up there before the credits roll.  Or they ran out of money, which is a possibility.You could do worse, but I've already heard this joke a few times and it was better told and more entertaining when Kevin Williamson called it Scream.",3,Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before...,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1418,"['SPOILER', 'FREE', 'mostly', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'movie', 'who', 'success', 'largely', 'how', 'much', 'pretend', 'core', 'joke', 'funny', 'was', 'funny', 'smirk', 'funny', 'not', 'really', 'LOL', 'funny', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'riot', 'others', 'stale', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'story', ""'m"", 'little', 'middle.On', 'surface', 'Mouth', 'Madness', 'meets', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'threatening', 'premise', 'former', 'as', 'charming', 'latter', 'burn', '90', 'minutes', 'occasionally', 'creative', 'touches', 'Maybe', 'more', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'meets', 'Buffy', 'SAW', 'Blade', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Big', 'Brother', 'above', 'whole', 'point', 'monster', 'ball', 'mayhem', 'sequence', 'probably', 'most', 'riotous', 'fun', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'rest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'up', 'ending', 'especially', 'pretty', 'flat', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Goddard', 'Whedon', 'forgot', 'referencing', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'mateiral', 'really', 'need', 'write', 'something', 'good', 'own', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'as', 'disposable', 'Big', 'Mac', 'container', 'was', 'better', 'last', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'instead', 'what/who', 'threw', 'up', 'there', 'credits', 'roll', 'ran', 'money', 'possibility.You', 'could', 'do', 'worse', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'joke', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'better', 'told', 'more', 'entertaining', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'called', 'Scream']",N/A

Joss Whedon pulls together an excellent cast, including some some Buffy The Vampire Slayer alumni, plus Chris Hemsworth (SWEET), and takes the horror movie formula and simultaneously wallops it, turns it upside down while loving it and laughing at it--all the while delivering tension and a GOOD SCARE.

1552142,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B008G33O0G,amerdale876,"[2, 5]","Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series,Angel: Complete Series,Firefly - The Complete Series,Dollhouse: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2,Marvel's The Avengers) is a true master of his craft. And even though I knew Drew Goddard had prior writing experience with TV greats (and some of my favorites such as ""Buffy,"" ""Angel,""Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box), andLost: The Complete Collection), I still was not sure what to think of him as a director and co-writer of a major film (even though he wrote the impressiveCloverfield). After viewing this masterpiece, I can say he does extremely well! This film's release had been delayed a bit (originally set for Feb. 2010, then Jan. 2011), but it was very much worth the wait! I can truly say that ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a fresh, innovative, fun, scary take on the horror film. It was also nice -- almost comforting, like a warm blanket -- to see former Whedonverse actors like Amy Acker (""Angel,"" ""Dollhouse""), Fran Kranz (""Dollhouse""), and Tom Lenk (""Buffy"") in the fold. Nobody can mix action, horror, suspense, and humor like Whedon, and this film proves it. All of the actors performances are spot-on and even though their characters are all stereotypical cliches, that ultimately serves the film's plot for reasons I cannot say without spoiling anything. My favorite moment in the film is near the end -- again, I don't want to say too much -- and it is every horror movie fan's DREAM. But, more on that later. There are many aspects to Whedon and Goddard's ""Cabin"" than most would think. The best thing about this movie is that in a genre (horror) that is second to predictability (following romantic comedies), ""The Cabin in the Woods"" delivers a fresh approach to horror; and the result is one fun, impressive movie that you want to see again and again. Now comes the part of the review where if you have not seen the film and want to see it, you cannot - and should not - read anymore.SPOILERS BEGINThe best thing about this film was its double meaning. First, one could argue that the ""evil gods"" that ""the company"" is attempting to appease are us, the audience. After all, who goes to see horror films despite the clich&eacute; of stereotypical characters (the jock, the slut, the intellectual, the fool, the virgin) tossed into the meat grinder? Who expects or hopes to see a little nudity and/or sex in a horror film, along with massive blood and gore? That would be the audience. It made me wonder if the two company workers (Richard Jenkins & Bradley Whitford) were working for us rather than some director. Second, the film makes the statement that we have to face up to all of the decisions we make in life. When the five decide to continue to their cabin despite the creepy old man's warning, and when Dana (Kristen Connolly) continues to read the Latin despite Marty's protests (as well as the protests of the audience), they have to face the harsh consequences.Another aspect to the plot could be the argument of utilitarianism. For those who don't know the term, utilitarianism is ""a theory that the aim of action should be the largest possible balance of pleasure over pain or the greatest happiness of the greatest number"" (Merriam-Webster), or, basically, in this case, the philosophy that the saving of billions of lives are worth the sacrifice or one or even five. Whedon and Goddard make it known in their film that utilitarianism is wrong. With the outcome of the film being what it is, they appear to make the remark that one life does not hold any less weight than 6-7 billion lives. However, there is one misnomer with this statement. To loosely reference the stoner fool Marty's words, what if the world - and its inhabitants - have become too advanced and too corrupt for its own damn good? It's a good question and a good statement to throw out there in a horror movie. But don't think this is some existential borefest. Like I previously stated, Whedon (along with Goddard) is a master of his craft and he knows exactly how to properly balance the horror with the laughs, the philosophical metaphor with the fun, and all without any pretentiousness.Now, onto my one small, teensy-weensy, itty-bitty criticism of the film and that is not showing the hawk getting zapped by the invisible electro-wall ... especially in the movie trailer. It leaves no ""wow"" factor for the audience when it inevitably comes up again later in the film. It's the only change I would have made to this movie. As for my absolute favorite part, as I mentioned earlier, it is when Dana opens all of the doors to release many, many horrible things upon the company. After that distinct sound of multiple synchronous ""ding""s from the elevator doors, I immediately thought to myself for a millisecond, ""Wow. Whedon has outdone himself. This is gonna be great!"" And then with the security guard whispering an expletive, the doors open and all hell breaks loose! Like I said, it's a moment that all horror fans and aficionados will love!SPOILERS ENDThis is definitely the best horror film I've seen in a LONG time! The film makes fun of the horror genre while also delivering to the audience what they so love about horror films. In the school of horror/slasher/zombie/suspense/headgame/conspiracy films, and the fans/students who so adore them, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a mandatory course!",5,"Horror, suspense, humor, action?

1552153,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B008G33O0G,Anthony Hand,"[5, 30]","Joss Whedon's sarky, tongue-in-cheek, ""post Modern"", ""meta-horror"" is the latest cut-n-paste effort that has Whedonites wetting themselves in the usual frenzied way. Not only that, but it's received generally favorable reviews from other areas too and currently holds around 90% positive on Rotten Tomatoes.I have to say, I find the former tiresome and no less obvious from the Whedonites, but the fact that other critics are writing glowing words about it, makes the latter part nothing short of astonishing. Astonishing, because 'Cabin in the Woods' is nowhere near as smart as Whedon, or his irritating acolytes, thinks it is.Although it's directed by Whedon protege, Drew Goddard, Whedon himself has taken his cue from 'Scream' and simply nicked an existing idea, tinkered with it, claimed it as his own, packaged it for his usual audience and marketed it as a revelation in film. A comedy-horror (my most hated genre after the rom-com) that'll have horror fans quivering in their boots and change the face of the genre for years to come.Unfortunately though, the film fails on both fronts. It isn't that funny and the horror elements are diluted badly by the attempts at comedy. Each angle is neutered by the other. But the worst thing about 'Cabin in the Woods' is that it's all been done before. The film's central reference, in a film whose raison d'etre is to function as a reference game for genre fans, is Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' and that film did everything better and with better comedy (even though I personally think it's vastly overrated too).The problem with Whedon's approach (to nearly everything he does), is that the nudge-nudge-wink-wink ""did you see what I did there?"" attitude that he infuses into the picture, becomes tiresome very quickly. The endless references to films, that in the main are vastly superior, just gets old. Everything from 'Friday the 13th', to 'Hellraiser', to 'IT', 'The Strangers', 'The Shining', 'Night of the Living Dead' and a whole host of others are mentioned in brief passing. Many of which will go flying over many peoples heads, I'm sure. The viewer needs to be a fan of horror films in order to get 'Cabin in the Woods', without which the film may come across as yet another silly slasher flick.It's not all completely bad though. In the film's final third, everything goes haywire and there's some fun to be had trying to spot the different monsters that mangle the screen (and the people), but it's too little, too late and by the time the film is over, it's long since outstayed its welcome.",2,Tumble down shack posing as premium priced property,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2555,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'sarky', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'post', 'Modern', 'meta-horror', 'latest', 'cut-n-paste', 'effort', 'wetting', 'usual', 'frenzied', 'way', 'Not', 'only', 'received', 'generally', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'other', 'areas', 'too', 'currently', 'around', '90', '%', 'positive', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes.I', 'have', 'say', 'find', 'former', 'tiresome', 'less', 'obvious', 'Whedonites', 'fact', 'other', 'critics', 'are', 'writing', 'glowing', 'words', 'latter', 'part', 'nothing', 'short', 'astonishing', 'Astonishing', ""'Cabin"", 'Woods', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'smart', 'Whedon', 'irritating', 'acolytes', 'directed', 'Whedon', 'protege', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Whedon', 'taken', 'cue', ""'Scream"", 'simply', 'nicked', 'existing', 'idea', 'tinkered', 'claimed', 'own', 'packaged', 'usual', 'audience', 'marketed', 'revelation', 'film', 'comedy-horror', 'most', 'hated', 'genre', 'rom-com', ""'ll"", 'have', 'horror', 'fans', 'quivering', 'boots', 'change', 'face', 'genre', 'years', 'come.Unfortunately', 'film', 'fronts', ""n't"", 'funny', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'diluted', 'badly', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'angle', 'neutered', 'other', 'worst', 'thing', ""'Cabin"", 'Woods', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'film', 'central', 'reference', 'film', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'function', 'reference', 'game', 'genre', 'fans', 'Sam', 'Raimi', ""'The"", 'Evil', 'Dead', 'film', 'did', 'everything', 'better', 'better', 'comedy', 'even', 'personally', 'think', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'too', '.The', 'problem', 'Whedon', 'approach', 'nearly', 'everything', 'nudge-nudge-wink-wink', 'did', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'there', 'attitude', 'picture', 'tiresome', 'very', 'quickly', 'endless', 'references', 'films', 'main', 'are', 'vastly', 'superior', 'just', 'old', 'Everything', '13th', ""'Hellraiser"", ""'IT"", ""'The"", 'Strangers', 'Shining', ""'Night"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'whole', 'host', 'others', 'are', 'mentioned', 'brief', 'passing', 'Many', 'will', 'go', 'flying', 'over', 'many', 'peoples', 'heads', ""'m"", 'sure', 'viewer', 'be', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'order', 'get', ""'Cabin"", 'Woods', 'film', 'may', 'come', 'yet', 'silly', 'slasher', 'flick.It', 'not', 'completely', 'bad', 'film', 'final', 'third', 'everything', 'haywire', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'trying', 'spot', 'different', 'monsters', 'mangle', 'screen', 'people', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'time', 'film', 'long', 'outstayed', 'welcome']",N/A

1552157,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B008G33O0G,Armando N. Roman,"[4, 4]","The title of my review says it all. The less you know about Cabin in the Woods going into it, the more surprised you're going to be. Simply put, if you're a fan of horror movies, ignore reading up on anything about it, and take a risk by going into it with no expectations. That's how I watched the movie, and I can tell you with 100% honesty that Cabin in the Woods is one of the best movies I've watched in the last couple of years. I can see why it was so hard to market, and why it sat on the shelf for as long as it did (check out how Chris Hemsworth looks here, not long before he starred in Thor). This section of my review right here is going to get the main things out of the way, with the next paragraph being my usual format with the plot summary. But please, just stop reading and watch it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5, since I did just say it's one of the best movies I've seen in a while, is because despite all the new things the film does, it takes a standard way out towards the end and starts to become just another horror movie. As weird as it sounds to praise something that goes this way, it still works, and I was only let down that they didn't keep the original pace up all the way through. That and some not-even-good-for-the-year-it-came-out CG are the two things holding it back. Even then, I enjoyed watching Cabin in the Woods and didn't want it to end, and I even wanted a couple of sequels given the variety of ways things could have gone.Alright, if you HAVE to know about the plot (man, I warned you)...Cabin in the Woods starts out with two men in a big business who are part of something big. They set up scenarios all over the world that are essentially what you see in horror movies. In Japan, a school for girls is haunted by a ghost in the class room, and they have cameras set up to show the whole thing. It turns out that these guys are part of something even bigger, and these situations are going on for a reason, though we don't find out what it is until much later. One of their main ""shows"" involves 5 college kids who go off to a cabin in the woods for a weekend in order to kick back and get off the grid, so to speak. You have the virgin, the jock, the...*ahem* cheerleader-type, the geek and the stoner. The funny thing is, all of these guys are friends and get along perfectly, not showing any signs of those labels until they get to the cabin. The jock dude isn't even a ""bro"" type- he's a great student! When they make it to the cabin, the guys back at the corporation get the gears going. They control a lot of elements about the scenario, but it's still up to the kids to decide on what to do. Different types of gases are used to change how their decision-making, voices will echo with advice on what to do next, and a trap door to the cellar opens up unexpectedly when the kids are all just kicking back in the living room. Of course they go down to inspect, and find a treasure trove of oddities. A puzzle sphere of sorts, a music box, an old diary, masks, a conch shell...the list goes on. Each of the kids is about to do something with what they pick up, but it's a special phrase in the diary that gets read out loud and activates which terror comes to the cabin- an undead family.As soon as the undead family is announced, and one of the two main guys in the company expresses his disappointment because he really wanted to see a mermaid kill the kids, that should tell you about the tone of the movie. Think of how From Dusk Till Dawn was two movies in one- the first half being crime and the second half being horror. Well, here it's horror mixed with comedy, with most of the comedy coming from the guys pulling off what's essentially their own horror movie. I loved it when the film would switch over to the workers in their lab, taking bets on what was going to happen next. When we see the list of all the monsters that could have been let loose, it brings to mind a whole bunch of ideas on what could have happened. Cabin in the Woods could almost be a kind of Choose Your Own Adventure movie, with even more potential for sequels if they showed the footage from other places int the world like that Japanese classroom. When the kids start to get killed off, it's kind of sad for once, because these aren't just plain dumb kids. We can see that for the most part, there's no way out of this trap, and they're helpless. And yet we cut over to the guys partying about how they're winning the bets, and it's easy to forget about the victims because this cast here is so damn likable!Honestly, I don't want to say much more about the movie. Horror films don't do a whole lot for me for various reasons (mainly because I saw two huge ones as a kid and nothing since then has scared me even in the slightest). Cabin in the Woods isn't scary at all, but instead just a very interesting film to watch play out. Very rarely do I go back and watch movies after I've seen them the first time. This is one of the exceptions where I'd gladly sit down with people who haven't seen it before and watch it again with them.",4,Don't read any reviews- just watch the movie.,1370736000,"06 9,

You have all the trappings of the classic scary flick here as the movie unfolds: stereotypical college kids, creepy and surly gas station hick, and so on.

There were a total of six people in the movie theater.  I told myself that it was probably because most people saw it opening weekend.  However, after sitting through it, I think maybe word of mouth has slowed its progress.  Despite the number of 5 star reviews the film has received here on Amazon, and the 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, this may be the most overrated film ever.  Recently, there was an article in Vanity Fair by James Wolcott in which he lamented the dearth of quality movies and the lowered expectations of many filmgoers (presumably including film critics, themselves) and praised the high quality of television's current offerings.  ""Cabin in the Woods"", in my opinion, only reinforces his argument.  Produced and co-written by Josh Whedon, ""Cabin"" is no ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", by any stretch of the imagination.  More a combination of ""Evil Dead"", ""Resident Evil"", and ""Doctor Strangelove"" (without the first and third film's imagination), ""Cabin in the Woods"" tips its hat too early, whispering its little secret to us without completely spilling the beans, although many will have it figured out long before the ending, which feels cribbed from the ending of another film written by Drew Goddard, ""Cabin""s co-writer and director. The writers have obviously also harvested some of the more esoteric internet conspiracy websites to gather some of their material.With the exceptions of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as two project managers, the actors are neither better nor worse than any others in movies of this genre.  Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"", ""The Avengers"") is the college jock who leads his small group to the titular cabin in the woods that allegedly belongs to his cousin. Enroute to the cabin, the group stops at a rundown gas station attended by the requisite nutjob--think the nutty alcoholic in the original ""Friday the 13th"" film--who drops ominous hints at what awaits them. Ignoring all this, the kids aren't at the cabin long before all sorts of horrors begin to unfold.  But, as the film basically shouts from the beginning, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.  Neither is it as surprising, innovative, or as interesting as it is given credit for being (it's really a lazy man's movie that combines scenes from other movies and adds a little twist in order to appear to be more clever than it is).  And, finally, the cinematography is often murky and the CGI effects aren't that impressive, either.In fact, if you've ever played a video game, this movie is basically the same type of experience, only much less fun.  At least that's how it felt to me.I give ""Cabin in the Woods"" a star for its sometimes fleeting, loopy humor (particularly in the performances of Jenkins and Whitford), and a star for the fact that it somewhat resists the temptation to get overly grotesque. Otherwise, there's not much else to recommend it over a rerun of ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"", which are free and about a hundred times more entertaining.",2,A Video Game in Sheep's Clothing,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,3066,"['went', 'see', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'second', 'weekend', 'release', 'were', 'total', 'six', 'people', 'movie', 'theater', 'told', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'people', 'saw', 'opening', 'weekend', 'However', 'sitting', 'think', 'maybe', 'word', 'mouth', 'slowed', 'progress', 'number', '5', 'star', 'film', 'received', 'here', 'Amazon', '92', '%', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'overrated', 'film', 'ever', 'Recently', 'was', 'article', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'James', 'Wolcott', 'lamented', 'dearth', 'quality', 'movies', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'many', 'filmgoers', 'presumably', 'including', 'film', 'critics', 'praised', 'high', 'quality', 'television', 'current', 'offerings', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'opinion', 'only', 'argument', 'Produced', 'co-written', 'Josh', 'Whedon', 'Cabin', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'More', 'combination', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Doctor', 'Strangelove', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'imagination', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'hat', 'too', 'early', 'whispering', 'little', 'secret', 'completely', 'spilling', 'beans', 'many', 'will', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'long', 'ending', 'cribbed', 'ending', 'film', 'written', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Cabin', 's', 'co-writer', 'director', 'writers', 'have', 'obviously', 'also', 'harvested', 'more', 'esoteric', 'internet', 'conspiracy', 'gather', 'material.With', 'exceptions', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'two', 'project', 'managers', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'worse', 'others', 'movies', 'genre', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'Avengers', 'college', 'jock', 'who', 'small', 'group', 'titular', 'cabin', 'woods', 'allegedly', 'cousin', 'Enroute', 'cabin', 'group', 'rundown', 'gas', 'station', 'attended', 'requisite', 'nutjob', 'think', 'nutty', 'alcoholic', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'who', 'drops', 'ominous', 'hints', 'what', 'Ignoring', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'cabin', 'long', 'sorts', 'horrors', 'begin', 'unfold', 'film', 'basically', 'beginning', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'THINK', 'IT', 'IS', 'surprising', 'innovative', 'as', 'interesting', 'given', 'credit', 'being', 'really', 'lazy', 'man', 'movie', 'combines', 'scenes', 'other', 'movies', 'little', 'twist', 'order', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'clever', 'finally', 'cinematography', 'often', 'murky', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'either.In', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'basically', 'same', 'type', 'experience', 'only', 'much', 'less', 'fun', 'least', 'how', 'felt', 'me.I', 'give', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'star', 'sometimes', 'fleeting', 'loopy', 'humor', 'particularly', 'performances', 'Jenkins', 'Whitford', 'star', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'temptation', 'get', 'overly', 'grotesque', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'recommend', 'over', 'rerun', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'are', 'free', 'hundred', 'times', 'more', 'entertaining']",N/A

With a number like that, and with a horror movie, it really must be good.""  Boy, was I wrong.I haven't read A.O. Scott's review yet - I will after writing this review - but I was happy to see that he panned it.  I don't know why yet but I will soon.  But for me, perhaps one of the biggest problems that I had with it:  expectations management.  It is such a bummer when you believe that a film - particularly in the horror genre - is going to be really good and it isn't.  But it starts out with real promise.  For example, there are a couple of really cute gals (O.K. more than that) and you think, ""Cool!  They're gonna get it!""  But the satire that is used - with an odd religious undertone - just seems to fall flat to me, and I found it neither profound nor funny.Now, a film such as this is difficult to review without giving things away.  So what I will do is the following:  give you a list of movies that it has ""borrowed"" from - at least ones that I have seen - and let you be the judge.

It's a smart horror film that isn't ashamed of it's somewhat satiric take, paying homage to the cheese of the genre as much as the scares and frights. While I doubt anyone will be so terrified as to lock their door at night after viewing this film, there will be moments and lines that will stick with you even if you aren't a fan of gore, nudity, and things that go bump in the night.The largest on screen element that bears applause is the acting.  They aren't trying to fit some pre determined role (literally) and, traversing between the worlds outside and inside the cabin develops in their changes as much as plot and jump scares.  The close runner up is masterful craftsmanship which the film is made.  Giving the type of classic jump scares in a modern context, acknowledging as many predecessors as they could (heavy on Rami, but watch out.  You might get your soul torn apart).  It is the best answer American Films have made in response to Shaun of the Dead as being outweighly funny, but having a few legitimate scares thrown in with superb writing, direction, cinematography, and acting at a level beyond most B horror, but nevertheless derived from the genre there in.Now comes the reason for three stars.  This time around, I agree with one of major criticism of this film: it could have done so much more.  I realize this is like saying, &#34;I wasn't suspecting it to be so big, but I wish you could have done more with it.&#34;  But it's true: as fresh as the movie feels, the extent at which it could have been explore seemed to be sacrificed in the name of keeping it 90 minutes.  In particular, the scale of tension which the movie works at seems to get strained at the three quarter mark.  At it's core, the argument is one of scale and proportion, which is why I'm leaving any margin of error up to personal choice.

An idyllic weekend away turns in to a terrible nightmare for five friends when rampaging monsters attack their remote cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, the mysterious members of a secretive organization watch from their secure command post to ensure that no one gets out alive.Here we find that the standards of the Slasher genre are being deconstructed and played out with loving homage and a tremendous amount of self-referential humor. Dana and her friends form the five teen stereotypes that would be expected in a film of this kind... At least, their observers are counting on this considering that the fate of the world may hang in the balance. Whedon's sharp wit makes for a number of wildly entertaining exchanges between the characters, even if their clever quips take away from the natural flow of dialog. As the group enters the cabin basement, we learn that it is up to them to choose their fate by selecting one of many accursed items, each of which are linked to some terrifying creature from ancient lore. And so, they fall under attack by... zombies? Of the limitless possibilities that could have been chosen, we are stuck watching another dull zombie movie?! Luckily, all hell breaks loose towards the end, and we get to see all of the creatures that are hidden deep beneath the cabin. Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, and the other unfortunate college kids are fine enough in their respective roles, but the real fun comes from Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as Sitterson and Hadley, the two quirky men behind the controls. Many of the best moments come from their crazy antics, like when the different departments bet on which monsters will dismember the unsuspecting teens first.THE CABIN IN THE WOODS puts an exciting new twist on many of the tired old cliches, and despite requiring a few minor adjustments to improve upon an otherwise perfect premise, it may yet prove to become a modern classic in the genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews: The Cabin in the Woods,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2061,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'reteam', 'bring', '2011', 'smash-hit', 'THE', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'idyllic', 'weekend', 'away', 'terrible', 'nightmare', 'five', 'friends', 'when', 'rampaging', 'monsters', 'attack', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Meanwhile', 'mysterious', 'members', 'secretive', 'organization', 'watch', 'secure', 'command', 'post', 'ensure', 'one', 'out', 'alive.Here', 'find', 'standards', 'Slasher', 'genre', 'are', 'being', 'deconstructed', 'played', 'out', 'loving', 'homage', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'self-referential', 'humor', 'Dana', 'friends', 'form', 'five', 'teen', 'stereotypes', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'kind', 'least', 'observers', 'are', 'counting', 'considering', 'fate', 'world', 'may', 'hang', 'balance', 'Whedon', 'sharp', 'wit', 'number', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'exchanges', 'characters', 'even', 'clever', 'quips', 'take', 'away', 'natural', 'flow', 'dialog', 'group', 'cabin', 'basement', 'learn', 'choose', 'fate', 'selecting', 'one', 'many', 'accursed', 'items', 'are', 'linked', 'terrifying', 'creature', 'ancient', 'lore', 'so', 'fall', 'attack', 'zombies', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'are', 'stuck', 'watching', 'dull', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Luckily', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'end', 'get', 'see', 'creatures', 'are', 'hidden', 'deep', 'beneath', 'cabin', 'Kristen', 'Connolly', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'fine', 'enough', 'respective', 'roles', 'real', 'fun', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Sitterson', 'Hadley', 'two', 'quirky', 'men', 'controls', 'Many', 'best', 'moments', 'come', 'crazy', 'antics', 'when', 'different', 'departments', 'bet', 'monsters', 'will', 'dismember', 'unsuspecting', 'teens', 'first.THE', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'exciting', 'new', 'twist', 'many', 'tired', 'old', 'cliches', 'requiring', 'few', 'minor', 'adjustments', 'improve', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'premise', 'may', 'yet', 'prove', 'become', 'modern', 'classic', 'genre.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1552219,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008G33O0G,Chris Kennison,"[0, 2]","""Cabin in the Woods"" had a delayed release. It was filmed and produced in 2009. Usually, that is the markings of a movie that has tested poorly or doesn't have a lot of potential. Such is not the case with this movie. The reason for the delay are many but one was the casting of Chris Hemsworth who had a much bigger movie released called ""Thor"" and they didn't want ""Cabin"" to be overshadowed.There is much to be said about ""Cabin in the Woods"", a movie that was written by Joss Whedon who has written a variety of things in his career, including ""Toy Story"" ""Alien: Resurrection"" and most notably the cult television hits, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" & ""Firefly"". Knowing that Whedon penned ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" must be noted upon viewing ""Cabin in the Woods"" because it makes perfect sense. ""Cabin"" is ""Buffy"" on steroids and without the television rating system.Part of the movie's appeal is the mystery of it and so I am not going to linger upon the details of the film for long. If you choose to view this movie, and I highly recommend it, know going in that it is like nothing you've ever seen in the horror genre before. We've seen kids get in a Winnebago and head into the middle of the wilderness to a remote cabin before, dozens of times. From that point, the creator's put together one of the most creative horror movies I've ever seen.""Cabin in the Woods"" will slowly grow on you with quick witted writing, perfectly placed humor that had me laughing out loud and the same shocks and scares that you expect from such a movie. As the science fiction/horror/comedy rotisserie unfolds you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, especially the slam bam out of this world finale that will leave you caught between chuckling and gasping. One thing is for sure with ""Cabin in the Woods"", horror movies have been given an ultimatum.

1552220,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B008G33O0G,Christian R. Unger,"[0, 0]","Many horror flicks are self aware, be that the character that knows what is going to happen, because that's what would have to happen if this were a horror flick, while no one believes him (that's in this movie). Or how the victims of the horror movie have to make the choice to experience the horror by taking positive actions to initiate and potentially pursue the other-worldly events (also in here). Or the realisation that all it takes to escape the horror would be to do ""something"" but fundamentally that is impossible (again, it's here).And although many horror movies that double as a comedy realise these things about themselves, none do it like The Cabin in the Woods.As you can probably guess from the cover / poster, this movie is about a world, not unlike a Rubik's cube, where actions unlock and enable other actions or paths. And just like a Rubik's cube, IF you don't know how it works things will quickly go to complete entropy. And that's what a horror movie experience is like for the victims, but this film goes deeper. Rather than this being an un-/super-natural horror, this is all controlled by humans. In fact, when you start watching the film, first time, you'll wonder what this could possibly have to do with anything, but that becomes apparent quite quickly.Effectively there are two stories being told, which are intertwined, and you sort of realise there is a third facet that is never actually addressed, namely how the setting was ever established. In some ways this would make a terrific movie in its own right and with any luck we will get to see that some day. Anyway, there is little one can say about this film without giving a lot away, so just accept this: two stories, intertwined and in the end one. Things will fall into place, and although where things are going become very apparent very quickly, this will take you for a ride.So, story: intriguing and out there. Characters: acting surprisingly good, though a bit shallow, with characters being archetypes and thus not being established any deeper, for some of the characters that works fine, for others typecasting and association will do the rest, though overall a bit more depth would have been good. Setting is good, cinematography/direction is at times a bit confused with the style being more akin to a TV show, than a big screen production, which isn't surprising as this is Drew Goddard's first gig as director. Some of the CG looks very cheap, though by that point you'll likely be howling with laughter, though it does grate especially combined with the other TV like looks.If you go into this movie with high expectations you will be disappointed. Even though it is different and quirky, this is aimed at a comic book audience, so if you like Joss Whedon's other work (Buffy, Avengers, even Toy Story) you will likely guess where this is going before they arrive at the titular cabin. But that isn't why you watch his stuff, you do it for the interesting take on what he's doing, and unless you are overloaded on his stuff already, you will likely enjoy it. If you don't know his stuff, or what to expect, and you like horror flicks, you probably will enjoy this. Some reviewers have said that this was one of the best things in 2012, and although I tend to agree, don't approach it with that expectation. It is one of the best things in a specific genre, namely introverted/self-aware horror comedy, which isn't a broad field. That said, it is probably one of the best things in that field for a few years.",4,"Differentiates itself by being a horror movie about horror movies, without talking about other horror movies",1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,3514,"['Many', 'horror', 'flicks', 'are', 'aware', 'be', 'character', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happen', 'were', 'horror', 'flick', 'one', 'movie', 'how', 'victims', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'experience', 'horror', 'taking', 'positive', 'actions', 'initiate', 'potentially', 'pursue', 'other-worldly', 'events', 'also', 'here', 'realisation', 'escape', 'horror', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'something', 'fundamentally', 'impossible', 'again', 'here', '.And', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'double', 'comedy', 'realise', 'things', 'none', 'do', 'Cabin', 'Woods.As', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'cover', '/', 'poster', 'movie', 'world', 'not', 'Rubik', 'cube', 'where', 'actions', 'unlock', 'enable', 'other', 'actions', 'paths', 'just', 'Rubik', 'cube', 'IF', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'things', 'will', 'quickly', 'go', 'complete', 'entropy', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'experience', 'victims', 'film', 'deeper', 'Rather', 'being', 'un-/super-natural', 'horror', 'controlled', 'humans', 'fact', 'when', 'start', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'apparent', 'quite', 'quickly.Effectively', 'are', 'two', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'are', 'intertwined', 'sort', 'realise', 'third', 'facet', 'never', 'actually', 'addressed', 'namely', 'how', 'setting', 'was', 'ever', 'established', 'ways', 'would', 'make', 'terrific', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'luck', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'day', 'Anyway', 'little', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'giving', 'lot', 'away', 'so', 'just', 'accept', 'two', 'stories', 'intertwined', 'end', 'one', 'Things', 'will', 'fall', 'place', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'become', 'very', 'apparent', 'very', 'quickly', 'will', 'take', 'ride.So', 'story', 'intriguing', 'there', 'Characters', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'bit', 'shallow', 'characters', 'being', 'archetypes', 'thus', 'not', 'being', 'established', 'deeper', 'characters', 'fine', 'others', 'typecasting', 'association', 'will', 'do', 'rest', 'overall', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Setting', 'good', 'cinematography/direction', 'times', 'bit', 'confused', 'style', 'being', 'more', 'akin', 'TV', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'production', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'first', 'gig', 'director', 'CG', 'very', 'cheap', 'though', 'point', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'howling', 'laughter', 'grate', 'especially', 'combined', 'other', 'TV', 'looks.If', 'go', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Even', 'different', 'quirky', 'aimed', 'comic', 'book', 'audience', 'so', 'like', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'other', 'work', 'Buffy', 'Avengers', 'even', 'Toy', 'Story', 'will', 'likely', 'guess', 'where', 'going', 'arrive', 'titular', 'cabin', ""n't"", 'why', 'watch', 'stuff', 'do', 'interesting', 'take', 'what', 'doing', 'are', 'overloaded', 'stuff', 'already', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stuff', 'what', 'expect', 'like', 'horror', 'flicks', 'probably', 'will', 'enjoy', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'things', '2012', 'tend', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'expectation', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'specific', 'genre', 'namely', 'introverted/self-aware', 'horror', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'broad', 'field', 'said', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'field', 'few', 'years']",N/A

Chances are if you're a fan of Joss Whedon (probably best commercially known for TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" although he also wrote the movie version), you didn't and wouldn't hesitate to see ""Cabin in the Woods.""  I loved it!  But I will say, if you're not at least a fan of and familiar with the first ""Scream"" movie, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie much.  It's very well-done...probably one of the most clever takes on the movie-within-a-movie trope that I've ever seen.  It offers a great balance of humor and gore and never loses site of what it's trying to do -- entertain.  But it's largely trying to entertain horror movie fans who have a solid knoweldge of the genre.  This should not be the first horror movie you've ever seen, or even the second.To very basically describe the plot, five college students who fit the stereotypes of teenagers we find in pretty much every horror movie starring teenagers head off to spend the weekend in a cabin in the woods.  It's supposed to be cliche because the movie is an allegory -- not a satire (that would be ""Scary Movie"").  Nor does it as straight-forwardly deconstruct horror movies the way ""Scream"" does.  ""Cabin in the Woods"" makes its point by putting the five kids in the middle of an annual ritual sacrifice, perpetrated by an underground global organization the goal of which is to appease some very ancient, sadistic gods.  (Or perhaps perpetrated by the movie industry to entertain some twisted theatre-goers?)The organization's staff watches the sacrifice from a substation that looks like a NASA control room and although the kids involved have ""free will,"" their actions are also manipulated by the staff making them do dumb thinks we make fun of every horror movie character for doing -- like splitting up when it's obviously best to stay together.  The kids get to choose their own adventure in terms of how they die, based on common horror movie deaths by common horror movie monsters.  They are unaware of what's going on until it's too late...or is it?""Cabin in the Woods"" sports some twists and turns and is certainly never boring in terms of the pacing and action.

The film gracefully walks the line between tongue-in-cheek and legitimate horror so incredibly well; I was still thinking about it after I'd gotten home from the theater; how the filmmakers managed to pull it all off in such a short amount of time and yet so smoothly is something of a mystery to me.The film literally showcases every type of horror film (and masterfully pays homage to quite a few specific horror films). The genre builds from a Deliverance / Wrong Turn theme and quickly shifts to something reminiscent of the Evil Dead series, complete with a self-opening hatch leading to the inevitable basement. It hovers over this sub genre for a while, and then evolves into homages to films like the Cube, The Mist, Hellraiser, various ghost, monster, and zombie movies, and eventually caps it all off with Lovecraftian Cthulhu mythos.The film rips apart every horror movie you've ever loved, stitches them all back together lovingly (albeit sarcastically at times), and what you get is one heck of an entertaining movie. If you were to have a horror movie night, or even a full-blown festival, this is the movie you'd want to play last. I'm not saying that it's any kind of ""pinnacle"" of horror movies.

After reading that he was involved in this movie, described as a twist on the classic horror genre, I was interested enough to pre-order this without reading any reviews.  I was hoping that he had brought some of the inventiveness and interesting characters he displayed in Firefly/Serenity to this effort, and I was interested to see what he came up with.  Alas, my hopes were not realized and I am sorry that I bought the DVD vs. pay-per-view.  I watched it all the way through but I am not sure I will ever watch it again.  It definitely is a new twist on the genre, but the cutting back and forth between the two scenarios is a bit jarring, and with less time for each, it means that the characters in both are not as fully developed or sympathetic.  And I didn't find the underlying secret to be that shocking, scary or compelling.

1552246,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B008G33O0G,CryWolf854,"[3, 4]","The title of my review pretty much sums the movie up.  If your familiar with Whedon's tv series, you'll pretty much find a little bit of everything, including a few familiar tv faces.Basically the premise is Firefly-Meets-Buffy/Angel-Whille-Stuck-In-An-Episode-of-Dollhouse.  Five college pals (including Chris Hemsworth; The Avengers, Snow White and the Huntsman) take a weekend trek to a remote cabin in the woods (hence the title) while, unbeknownst to them, they are the pawns in some elaborate underground society built on trying to keep the Gods happy.  In order to keep the balance, a select group (our heros) must be killed in a specific order.  There's The Virgin, The Jock, The Burnout, The Slut, and The Brain/Token Minority.As a whole, the movie is ok.  There isn't much really to root for.  As a group, our heroes are fine in their roles.  I'm not a big fan of Hemsworth but here he is beginning to show some talent.  Far and away, the best of the group is Fran Kranz (the Burnout).  He's basically us.  While everyone else goes off and does whatever they're programmed to do, he's the one saying ""You want us to do what?  Are you crazy?""  It also helps that he provides the comedic relief.My only gripe is whenever we cut to the underground lab.  Here the pacing just comes to an abrupt halt.  I don't know about the rest of you but seeing old men in suits trying to ""get jiggy with it"" is not funny.  It's sad actually.  At least once our survivors get inside the lair in the third act that the payoff is worth it.  And as for the ending, it's refreshing to see the writers take a non-Hollywood style ending.  Is it the best way to bring the movie to a close?  Not necessarily as proven by a number of other reviewers opinions but it worked for me.

1552247,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008G33O0G,C. Sawin,"[99, 115]","If you read my Juan of the Dead review, then you probably not only have an idea of how much I love horror films but also how much I thrive for originality and creativity in the genre. Something unique is so hard to come by anymore. It's as if Hollywood is afraid of taking risks. They'd rather remake something well-known to try and capitalize on a well-known name or franchise than go forward with something completely fresh and new because it might bomb. It makes sense on one hand, but for somebody who sees one hundred films a year or more it becomes kind of tiresome. You begin to make the most with what you have in front of you. If only a horror film could come along and be clever, original, pay homage, and offer something new for horror. That's exactly what you get with The Cabin in the Woods.Curt (Chris Hemsworth) plans on taking his girlfriend Jules (Anna Hutchison) and his friends to his cousin's cabin. There's the new recruit to the football team Holden (Jesse Williams), the paranoid stoner Marty (Fran Kranz), and Jules friend Dana (Kristen Connolly) who is kind of on the fence of whether or not she'll enjoy herself on the trip. Everything seems to be progressing in typical horror movie fashion even up to the cellar door slamming open in the middle of their festivities. But something more sinister is going on; something that will put the lives of these five friends on the line.The Cabin in the Woods is a horror film that is incredibly special. If you're a fan of anything by Joss Whedon and/or Drew Goddard, then you should have a small idea of what you're in for. The entire film can be spoiled in as little as one sentence or even a few words, so don't let anyone spoil it for you. The humor is sharp witted much like most of Whedon's work. The Marty character is especially hilarious. The film is so aware of the horror films it borrows from and pays tribute to and it makes fun of that fact whenever it starts to go down a similar path. It's kind of like the concept of Scream only smarter.It's when the college students make their way down into the cellar is when things get legendary; a bold word to use perhaps but the film earns it on more than one occasion. That's all you're getting out of me as far as the storyline is concerned. This is one instance of mindblowing that deserves every opportunity to surprise and excite you. The score is just as extravagant as the film, as well. When it first begins, it's subtle and creepy. It's slow rising and a lot like what you'd expect a horror movie score to be. As things pick up though, the score becomes more triumphant and blaring. Everything is so loud and screams to be seen and heard on the best sound and video devices you can get your hands on.The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II are the films you'll hear this compared to the most, but there were shades of Friday the 13th in there as well. The blood and gore deliver in spades, especially in the final act. You practically feel like buckets of blood have been dumped directly into your lap by the time Trent Reznor is screaming at you during the ending credits. But let's talk about that final act for a moment. You have an idea of where the film is going leading up to that point. The Cabin in the Woods is telling this story from two different angles and you think you have everything figured out. But then that one scene happens. If you've seen the film, you know exactly what I'm talking about; where everything hits the fan. My jaw was on the floor and I had goosebumps all over my body. This is why I go to the movies. This is why I love horror; to experience something like this.The Cabin in the Woods doesn't reinvent the horror genre, but it does completely manipulate it in a way that is just so freaking spectacular that you won't know what to do with yourself. If this was the last horror movie to ever grace the silver screen I would be completely content with that. The full-length horror movie era can begin with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1920 and end with The Cabin in the Woods in 2012, as far as I'm concerned.

Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched and monitored...and very soon, they are about to be plunged into a nightmare beyond all imagination.Here's the thing about THE CABIN IN THE WOODS: it's a horror movie.  Not a horror/comedy, but a straight-up horror movie with a sense of humor (in the same sense that writer Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS was a superhero movie with a sense of humor).  And yet, it manages to rewrite the very underpinnings of the horror genre, making it a parody of sorts.  The smart script and solid direction (courtesy of CLOVERFIELD director Drew Goddard) are both entertaining, thoughtful, and full of references to all sorts of horror cliches (hence the generic title); and yes, it's just a damn good horror film in and of itself, scary and gory and all-around fun.Of course, this wouldn't be possible without the cast.  The five leads are great; supporting actors Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, and Amy Acker are also fantastic, providing much of the dark humor (and it IS dark).  There's also a great cameo I shan't reveal.  In fact, you'll probably find this whole review very lacking in plot description.  Why is that?  Because to say any more would be to ruin the fun.

Combine that with an ever more terrible selection of good horror films, leaves me yearning for something, anything interesting.Expectations and realitiesCabin in the woods was NOT what i expected, i didn't read the synopsis, i just went off the genre and general word of mouth. I was pleasantly surprised it took an unconventional approach and while i can't really see it as a pure to goodness horror movie, it has some good elements of horror, rolled in with a nice helping of mythological mystery and a cherry of well done comedy.GoreA note about gore: i usually hate it, and gore to me is not horror in the slightest. In this film while there is gore, it isn't over the top and isn't harped on or focused on or used in any way to just make the audience squeal/cringe. Most of it is just a part of whats happening and fits in stylistically and that's it. I like that.QuipOh and half the time you'll be yelling at hemmsworth to just use his damn thor hammer and finish it.Attention spanThis is not a movie to have playing in the background, you need to pay attention, or else you'll miss small but important information, or some hilarious little comedic shtick.How long does it feel?It moves along very well, i never got bored or found myself waiting for the next thing to happen, it's a well written script in that aspect that it hits the proper points at the right times.SEMI-but-NOT-totally-SPOILERSSo what i gathered before watching this, was that it was a bunch of kids that go into a cabin in the woods and get killed somehow. it's the somehow that defines and separates this flick from a lot of the boiler plate horrors out there. Theres 2 more layers of dynamic on top of that, the first characters you're introduced to are the ones controlling all the bad stuff going on, and you'll get to find out their reasons for doing so. I feel like i should be turned off with everything going on in this film, but it actually pieces and works together quite well, which is usually the sign of a good script.Overall, i found it a good watch, it doesn't set out to get awards, but then, what comedy or horror ever does? It's here to entertain and give you something a bit different than the conventional crap that's out there.",4,"It's a horror? It's a comedy? it's a mystery?

But with the upcoming release of The Avengers, Written and Directed by Joss Whedon who co-scripted Cabin with its Director Drew Goddard, and the bankability of Thor/Avengers/Cabin actor Chris Hemsworth, Cabin in the Woods has been finally released.And I'm glad it was because CITW is a Horror/Comedy masterpiece that I would easily put aside anything that came out during Horror's glory days in the 1980's when we got classics like Return of the Living Dead (my favorite movie), Creepshow, An American Werewolf in London, Evil Dead 2 etc...Now, a lot of people have been mentioning Scream (1996) in comparison to CITW because both movies act as a post-modern meta exploration of the Horror genre while also delivering the prerequisite scares, blood and boobies. But Cabin is soo much more as it doesn't simply have the characters be aware that they are in a Horror movie scenario and comment on it (which was Screams only innovation despite the fact that it had been done before in, for instance, Return to Horror High (1987) and many other movies including Wes Craven's own New Nightmare) and instead uses the archetypical characters (The Jock, Stoner, Nerd, Virgin and Slut) to tie the story into something more mythological which gives the movie greater resonance.Then there's also the fact that CITW keeps building and building towards and epic crescendo with one twist and turn after another and not in some stupid M. Night Shamalamadingdong way as what Cabin gives us is mysteries and revelations followed by satisfying answers and an ending that isn't simply designed to lead into a sequel unlike so much of the mindless franchised garbage of the last decade or so (Final Destination, Saw, Underworld, Resident Evil).Cabin in the Woods is a GREAT movie that should be seen by any self-respecting Horror fan and will be a day one Blu-ray purchase for me. It's the best Horror movie I've seen since American Psycho back in 2000 and the first movie to leave me buzzing from seeing it since Fight Club blew the back of my head off in 1999.",5,As good as anything that came out in the 1980's!

All the hype - elevating one's expectations - doesn't help either.I was entertained by this movie, but never really scared or intrigued. I'm not sure that the film's split personality does it much service. We're Joss-tossed between some really good monster visuals, and silliness reminiscent of a TV sitcom. There are some moments of really good satire: the evil toothless owner of a rural gas station, warning our traveling teens not to head into the woods. Another vignette rips into Japanese schoolgirl supernatural, capturing the cliche perfectly. On the other hand, moments of ghoulish horror didn't quite jell for me. Our hapless characters (well, most of them) are dispatched in efficient fashion, but I can't say I cared enough about them to really bat an eye. Actor Fran Kranz's portrayal of an eccentric stoner grated on my nerves after awhile. It was not a matter of acting craft, but more the fact that he was merely reworking his crazy immature eccentric mode as Topher Brink in 'Dollhouse'.

In the late 90's, West Craven reinvigorated the horror genre with ""Scream,"" by combining sly self-awareness and humor with genuine scares. Not since ""Scream"" has a mainstream film come along and reinvented the horror genre like ""The Cabin in the Woods"".The film begins with two opposing and intertwined storylines. One is the oldest clich&eacute; in the world - 5 attractive college students decide to head off to a cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun, sex, and substance abuse. It's a surprise to no one that terror, bloodletting, and death await them. But there's another storyline happening; where a group of corporate drones are watching the youngsters on TV screens, anticipating their actions as if they're producers making a reality show. If that were the case, then the film would hardly be fresh and original. Tying reality TV to horror has been done many times in recent years. So what, exactly, is really going on with the workers watching the kids, and why does their fate alternately amuse, entertain, and terrify them?To give anything else away would be a crime, because the best thing about this film is its unpredictability. If you think you know what's coming ... you don't. Lots of films and television shows try so hard to shock, titillate, or surprise their audience that the tactics just come across as empty and manipulative, but ""The Cabin in the Woods"" has genuinely new, fresh ideas that it executes expertly.I will give one thing away ... the ending of this film offers no possibility for a sequel.

Simultaneous storylines lead the viewers towards the ultimate showdown.  One half of this movie is brightly lit and glibly handled; the other half is an aching clich&eacute; drowned in darkness (literally, couldn't see much of anything).  Neither half of the movie actually meshed into a cohesive story.  There were moments that were quite effective, yes, but too many times everything fell flat, weighed down by a concept that didn't allow much wiggle room.  The inherent problem with a one gimmick premise lies with whether or not the viewer will want to see it again, knowing the punch line.  It didn't help that co-writer/director Drew Godard made the claim that they wanted to pay homage to slasher films.  A homage only works if you plan to replicate or elevate the genre in question.  This movie did neither.  The slasher part of the film was half hearted, the jazzed-up-joke-part wasn't fully realized; in the end, it all came down to a single sentence explanation that was more loopy than clever.  Only the mayhem sequence was truly spectacular and intriguing, unfortunately, it didn't last long.My greatest complaint is with Drew Godard's idiot choice of filming the slasher half of this movie in almost total darkness and wimping-out with the killing sequences, most done out of the sightline.  The fact that he did this on purpose is even more bewildering.  For example, he boasted that he filled the cellar to capacity with a multitude of items necessary to the story, but then he obliterated any sight of them by filming the sequence in darkness making the entire sequence null and void.  The five characters could have all been looking at cans of beans for all it mattered.Bad choices are just that.",3,"""We need a scenario adjustment.""",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1960,"['Bragging', ""'ve"", 'written', 'something', 'three', 'days', 'then', 'filming', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'way', 'position', 'when', 'three-day', 'product', 'scrutiny.The', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'overly', 'cute', 'attempt', 'invigorate', 'aging', 'genre', 'Simultaneous', 'storylines', 'lead', 'viewers', 'towards', 'ultimate', 'showdown', 'One', 'half', 'movie', 'brightly', 'lit', 'glibly', 'handled', 'other', 'half', 'aching', 'clich', 'eacute', 'drowned', 'darkness', 'literally', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'anything', 'half', 'movie', 'actually', 'meshed', 'cohesive', 'story', 'were', 'moments', 'were', 'quite', 'effective', 'yes', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'everything', 'fell', 'flat', 'weighed', 'down', 'concept', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'wiggle', 'room', 'inherent', 'problem', 'one', 'gimmick', 'premise', 'not', 'viewer', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'knowing', 'punch', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'co-writer/director', 'Drew', 'Godard', 'made', 'claim', 'wanted', 'pay', 'homage', 'slasher', 'films', 'homage', 'only', 'plan', 'replicate', 'elevate', 'genre', 'question', 'movie', 'did', 'neither', 'slasher', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'half', 'hearted', 'jazzed-up-joke-part', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'end', 'came', 'down', 'single', 'sentence', 'explanation', 'was', 'more', 'loopy', 'clever', 'Only', 'mayhem', 'sequence', 'was', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'intriguing', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long.My', 'greatest', 'complaint', 'Drew', 'Godard', 'idiot', 'choice', 'filming', 'slasher', 'half', 'movie', 'almost', 'total', 'darkness', 'wimping-out', 'killing', 'sequences', 'most', 'done', 'sightline', 'fact', 'did', 'purpose', 'even', 'more', 'bewildering', 'example', 'boasted', 'filled', 'cellar', 'capacity', 'multitude', 'items', 'necessary', 'story', 'then', 'obliterated', 'sight', 'filming', 'sequence', 'darkness', 'making', 'entire', 'sequence', 'null', 'void', 'five', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'cans', 'beans', 'mattered.Bad', 'choices', 'are', 'just']",N/A

There is a hulking athlete on an academic scholarship named Curt (Chris Hemsworth) who is dating the pretty co-ed, Jules (Anna Hutchison), a newly minted (or dyed) blonde. His cousin recently purchased a vacation home and he invited him to enjoy the weekend there. His friends are Marty (Fran Kranz), a joking marijuana enthusiast, Dana (Kristen Connolly), the cute but courageous girl-next-door, and Holden (Jesse Williams), Curt's fellow student-athlete.They joke around, pack up a RV and hit the road until they make a pit stop at a decrepit gas station. As Curt goes to fill up the RV with gas, it become clear that this is eerie territory. The gas station is falling apart on the outside, but the inside is filled with filth, dead animal pelts and other freaky Leatherface-esque paraphernalia as well as a creepy hick of a proprietor (Tim de Zarn). There is a brief stand-off between the friends and this judgmental creep, but he gives them directions and they head off with a newly fueled RV. The gang makes it to the cabin in the woods, but there are a few oddities that might be a harbinger for things to come. Particularly scary is a painting of what appears to be gray-skinned frontiersmen and their hounds ripping apart an unlucky goat for food or, perhaps, sacrifice. Still, they have fun swimming during the day and dancing to music at night but the fun ends when they stumble upon the evil and supernatural threats in the cabin's basement. Over the course of the night, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods  and persevere hell on Earth.The script by Joss Whedon is original, sharp, funny, entertaining and  ambitious. The film is well-produced featuring great special effects and make-up as well as direction from first time director, and co-writer of the film, Drew Goddard. The acting is top notch across the board, but Hutchison, Connolly and Kranz stand out in particular as they add some flair, vulnerability and humor to their characters. Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins are excellent in the thankless supporting roles of hard-working, smart aleck bureaucrats who make one heck of a duo. Richard Jenkins has an amazing ability to switch from jolly, middle-class white collar stiff to outraged and concerned neurotic in a millisecond, and Bradley Whitford beautifully effuses subtle shifts in attitude using facial and body language while also portraying the cool, wise ass to a tee. There is a scene where Jenkins' character mocks Whitford's bet on a prediction and his reaction is priceless, which is on top of great dialogue by Whedon and Goddard. Brian White and Amy Acker are also both superb in supporting roles as bureaucrats in different departments within a government agency. At around ninety minutes of film, there could have been some more exposition or scenes, but it is still nothing short of excellent.The Cabin in the Woods combines the original media (horror), dark humor, satire and even meta fiction.  You can sense the meta and satirical aspects of the film as similar in spirit to the TV shows Tales from the Crypt and South Park.

He has always given very layered and complex stories and we always love the characters because they break all the stereotypes. Surely, this must be a mistake. He would do not so simple a thing.Yep. He did it. And it was a LOT more than we ever bargained for.In this dual-arced story we see not only a typical horror film, but the reason why we have typical horror film. And that might be too obtuse a line to use, but I really want to do this review sans-spoilers. We've got zombies, we've got werewolves, we've got unicorns, we've got tentacles, we've got giant snakes, we've got dastardly robots, all pitted against five stereotypes that don't fit the stereotypes. It's a wonderful symphony of chaos and destruction. Oh, and we've got Sigourney Weaver, too. And that's always a plus!So, why should you watch something like this? Because it explains the past 20 years of bad horror cinema. Because Joss does NOT know how to tell simple stories and we love him for that. In the end, we watch the film because we love the past 20 years of bad horror cinema.Oh, and there are some bonus features too.

The premise starts off as obvious, 5 teenagers out for a weekend in the woods.  The ""eye in the sky"" part lets you know something ominous is going to occur.  Just how ominous you really are not sure until about the last 20 minutes.  So for most of the film, it is a typical teen horror movie (with all the teens being in their 20s or 30s), slowly they begin to perish in awful situations, which may or may not have been created by our ""eye in the sky"".  Then the story line takes a turn, and what you thought was, is no longer.  All hell breaks loose and there is sheer pandamonium as two of our teens are still alive (although should not be).  What comes from this is a great plot twist, some of our childhood horrors and a cameo by a great actress who is at the head of it all.  This is a must see/must be movie.

It begins in an unusual way; within a laboratory where a group of scientists are preparing for the arrival of the ""target."" Then it proceeds as one would have originally expected in this genre: a group of young adults, in this case college-age students, are going away for a wild weekend of sex, drugs, and partying before everything falls apart in a somewhat predictable fashion.I didn't hate the approach but I didn't really love it either. It felt like a cross between TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (group goes to mysterious house and gets butchered) and SAW (in terms of the outsider controlling aspects of the disaster) that while original did take some of the scare out of it. By the time the scientists are celebrating I found myself asking, ""What the heck is all this?"" I did want to know where it was all going to end up and found the conclusion very surprising.While I suggest this movie is a cross between TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (the original) and SAW, the reason I would consider those films to be classics in horror and this not is that the back and forth between the puppets and the puppeteers didn't feel genuine. I wasn't jumping out of my seat, my heart didn't race, and I wasn't really disturbed by what I had just seen when it was all over. (Perhaps because it didn't seem real.) And if the goal was to make it feel artificial so as to turn it into a comedy, that didn't quite work either.The bottom line is that if you are looking for a modestly thrilling semi-horror, semi-mystery, semi-parody movie with good-enough acting and special effects, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is worth renting for a rainy evening.",3,"Creative but Missed the ""Target""",1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,1765,"['review', '3.5', '5.0', 'stars', 'contains', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'THE', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'unusual', 'way', 'laboratory', 'where', 'group', 'scientists', 'are', 'preparing', 'arrival', 'target', 'Then', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'originally', 'expected', 'genre', 'group', 'young', 'adults', 'case', 'college-age', 'students', 'are', 'going', 'away', 'wild', 'weekend', 'sex', 'drugs', 'partying', 'everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'fashion.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'approach', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'either', 'felt', 'cross', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'group', 'mysterious', 'house', 'butchered', 'SAW', 'terms', 'outsider', 'controlling', 'aspects', 'disaster', 'original', 'did', 'take', 'scare', 'time', 'scientists', 'are', 'celebrating', 'found', 'asking', 'What', 'heck', 'did', 'want', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'found', 'conclusion', 'very', 'surprising.While', 'suggest', 'movie', 'cross', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'original', 'SAW', 'reason', 'would', 'consider', 'films', 'be', 'classics', 'horror', 'not', 'back', 'forth', 'puppets', 'puppeteers', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'genuine', 'was', ""n't"", 'jumping', 'seat', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'race', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'disturbed', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'goal', 'was', 'make', 'feel', 'artificial', 'so', 'turn', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'either.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'looking', 'modestly', 'thrilling', 'semi-horror', 'semi-mystery', 'semi-parody', 'movie', 'good-enough', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'THE', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'worth', 'renting', 'rainy', 'evening']",N/A

Until my friends told me I had to see it and that all is not what it seems and this really isn't your run of the mill kids go out to some cabin and get killed kinda movie.  I mean, I dislike slasher movies.  They are so predictible.  That was one thing this movie was not, and I loved it for that as much as for the far more witty than ususal horror movie dialogue.I won't give away the surprise...but this movie starts with the typical plot device of 5 dumb kids go off to some rundown old cabin in the middle of a dark spooky woods.  Each one represents the normal assortment of dumb kids that you tend to see in such movies--the handsome jock, the smart nerdy guy, the sexy cheerleader kind of girl, the smart guy with a heart of gold, and the shy ""virgin.""  We all know these people, even if the names and actors change from movie to movie.  We know the handsome jock goes with the sexy cheerleader and that the good guy and the shy virgin may or may not end up together, while the smart nerdy guy figures out what is going on long before anyone else does, but no one listens to him.Of course, there is also the crazy old guy they run into along the way who warns them Not To Go There...which, of course, they ignore.  After all, what can some crazy old guy know?  Plus the physical star of the piece, the haunted cabin with its dark secrets and scary decor.  Accordingly, our group sets up shop in this cabin and make the mistake of going down into the basement which, in this case, is filled with all sorts of strange weird junk that looks like it came out of thousands of other horror movies, plus a few we've never even thought of.  It was like stepping into a horror movie collection to end all horror movie collections.Of course, danger and death and blood ensues.  The five kids are forced to fight off scary monsters and, along the way, the real plot of the movie unfolds itself...one far more terrifying than any old spooky cabin in the woods.

1552361,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B008G33O0G,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[3, 5]","This is not only a brilliant horror film, but also a brilliant deconstruction of horror films.  If you're a fan of the horror genre, you absolutely have to see it.  It's scary, suspenseful, and sexy; but it's also funny, clever, and self-aware.  It's a fresh new take on a genre that was starting to get rather stale.  Written by geek icons Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, produced by Whedon, and directed by Goddard, this film takes all of the standard tropes you'd expect to find in a modern, blood-soaked horror movie, shines a spotlight on them, and gives them a fresh new interpretation that somehow manages to be both subversive and celebratory at the same time.  Here, subtext becomes text, as Goddard and Whedon pull back the curtain and allow us to see what's really going on behind the scenes of the typical slasher film, letting us in on the secret of why all of these movies seem to follow the same basic plot.  Some things in this movie will feel very familiar to anyone who has seen any of the popular horror films of the past few decades, especially the ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchises and their derivatives.  But everything else in this movie is so original, so unexpected, and so unlike anything we've ever seen before in a slasher film that it transcends the genre and redefines what a horror movie is capable of being.  This is not merely a horror film.  It's a subtle commentary on the very nature of horror films.  It is a loving critique of the genre, as well as a satirical homage to it.  It's not a parody like the ""Scary Movie"" franchise; though it does often blur the line between the grotesque and the absurd.  This is an actual horror thriller that is just as suspenseful, just as violent, and just as gory as any other slasher film.  But there's a lot more to it than that.  As you'd expect from Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard -- who first worked together on Whedon's cult classic TV series, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" -- this movie manages to find the dark humor in the midst of all the horror; and it celebrates the aesthetics of the macabre.  More importantly (at least from the perspective of geeks like me) this movie has an intellectual depth to it that you just don't find in the typical slasher film.  If you're not a geek, you can thoroughly enjoy this movie simply for its edge-of-your-seat thrills, its laugh-out-loud jokes, and its eye-candy cast (personally, I liked the redhead; but, then again, I always like the redhead).  But geeks will also appreciate the clever subtext that Goddard and Whedon have built into this film.  There's definitely a lot going on underneath the surface.  If you're a fan of horror movies, you really owe it to yourself to watch this.  And you'll definitely want to watch it more than once in order to make sure you catch all of the subtle details that are easy to miss the first time around.I think you'll also enjoy the bonus materials included on this disc.  I certainly had a big grin on my face the entire time I was watching the mini documentary on the making of the film, and the featurettes on monster design and special effects.  It's fun to see how all this stuff gets done.  The audio commentary by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard is also a lot of fun to listen to.  Overall, the special features complement the movie quite nicely.  I was quite pleased with them.I can't guarantee that you'll love this movie as much as I do, because your tastes may be very different from mine.  But if what I've written here has piqued your curiosity about this film, then you really need to check it out and decide for yourself whether or not you like it.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 7]","- a disembodied voice: ""Forgive us and let us get it over with.""Once in a blue moon, some brilliant so-and-so elevates a horror film beyond the limitations and schlockiness of its genre. The last time I saw a horror flick that had this much awesome sauce on it, it was Wes Craven's SCREAM. And, seeing as THE CABIN IN THE WOODS was birthed from the fiendish minds of Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, you are in for some clever creep-outs.I promise, no spoilers. The plot initially trots out that creaky premise: a group of college students go to a remote cabin for fun and frolic, and then cue horrific shenanigans. These youths are drawn out of stock archetypes (the good girl, the promiscuous girl, the jock, the brain, and the school cut-up). Except that one of the film's neat conceits is that most of these kids actually defy their stereotypes (the jock is himself a brain; the p0t-smoking clown is the most sensible). Folks who've worked with Whedon in past projects pop up. There is a surprise guest or two. I refuse to go into detail about them two lab geeks (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) what opens the film, except that they immediately compel you to wonder what in heck they're doing in this story. Part of the fun is in seeing the two separate threads converge.Surely, at some point in your theater-venturing life, you've yelled at the screen over some film character's questionable move. Odds are, you've done this most during a horror flick. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS submits an explanation for all those dumb choices made by past victims in horror cinema. And, yes, there's something going on here that smacks some of meta storytelling. Don't be too surprised when the narrative strays off the beaten path. But, first, you'll get the clich&eacute;d menacing local (naturally, he welcomes the kids with ominous remarks) and there's a dusty diary (parts of which passages are worryingly in Latin), and other familiar horror tropes. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS would like to make you feel at home before it pulls the rug out from under you. When that cellar door bursts open... there's no going back.One concern is that the novelty and inventiveness and the sheer smarts that went into the film may actually overwhelm (or is it undermine?) the jump-out-of-your-seat moments. But there are enough good scares here, I think. And because Joss Whedon wrote this in part, I tried not to get too invested in any one character. We recognize the diabolical delight Whedon takes in priming us into rooting for his characters before he kills them off brutally. Except, it turns out, I couldn't NOT pull for some of the characters, because they're actually played with some wit and verve by the actors. Will history teach us nothing? Whedon lulls you. He's a luller.I don't know that THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is quite the game changer other folks are claiming it to be. It's original and creative and whip smart. It's spooky and funny (them lab geeks provide plenty of tongue-in-cheek dialogue, and I suppose we're meant to draw a correlation between their callous responses and the movie audience's own jadedness). For horror fans, there are insane homages galore. The film's third act absolutely blew my mind, and it absolutely sucks that I can't even talk about it for fear of ruining it for you. Whedon and Goddard have managed to tweak the fright genre, even as they've simultaneously, lovingly crammed in so many horror tropes.

One thing I will say after having watched through this entire movie was that it most definitely had Joss Whedon written all over it.  For those of you who are familiar with Joss Whedon's past works, especially Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly/Serenity, you will know what I'm talking about.  Firstly, just simply the sense of both humor and irony throughout it...that's definitely Joss Whedon.  Furthermore, all of the creatures & whatnot toward the end of the movie...only Joss could come up with so many interesting and unique types of creatures.  Furthermore, for those that are familiar with Reavers from Firefly/Serenity, he even through some of them in the mix.  Haha, gotta love it.  That being said though, I don't want to spoil too much of the movie, because it's been said and it's true...the less you know going into the movie, the more you'll enjoy it.From many positive reviews I'd seen here online and that I'd heard from my brother in law, and just simply the fact that Joss Whedon's name was on this, I bought it up without hesitation.  I am a long time Joss Whedon fan, as is one of my buddies that watched this with me, and we both very much enjoyed it, plus another friend of mine and my wife had sat down and watched it too, and they liked it as well.  My one friend isn't even big into horror and he loved this.  This is only sort of a horror movie, but I really don't want to say anymore than that though...you just need to watch it for yourselves.  I'm a big fan of zombie movies/shows, and I think this is one of only few other sorta horror type movies that I have liked about as well as many of the zombie movies/shows that I love.  Just as an FYI for those of you sensitive to it, there is some heavy gore in parts, so you might want to avoid this, but for those of you like me who aren't phased by this and perhaps even enjoy gore fests, definitely give this movie a watch straight away if you haven't already!  Don't read into stuff too much about it before you watch, because then you'll enjoy it more.

For an American film audience culture that has by now endured the irony-heavy Scream franchise and the gloomily unironic spate of ""torture porn"" from auteurs like Eli Roth and others, can there truly be any genuine shocks in horror anymore? ""Cabin in the Woods"" film attempts to answer that question with a wink and a nod.In the 1980s modern classic ""Fright Night"", Roddy MacDowall's hammy veteran of vampire films makes a self-aware observation that informs the proceedings of ""Cabin"":  ""Nobody wants to see vampire killers... or vampires (anymore)... Apparently all they want to see are demented madmen running around in ski-masks, hacking up young virgins.""""Cabin"" features five college-aged protagonists, each fitting a certain stock clich&eacute; to be found in assorted horror films: the jock/de facto leader (Chris Hemsworth ), the dumb blonde (Anna Hutchison), the nerd/token minority (Jesse Williams), the druggie (Fran Kranz) and the nice girl (Kristin Connolly.) The (slight) twist is, not all of the characters inhabit these roles from the get-go, but are manipulated into them.A creepy gas station attendant (is there any other kind?) gives an oblique warning (to the students and the audience) as the quintet heads up to the titular cabin for a weekend of unsupervised fun. Before the film is over, threads from Deliverance, Friday the 13th, Ju-On/The Grudge and more are touched on in various depths. The ""Saw"" films, which are already on their seventh (or is that VIIth?) installment, are also clipped for some thematic DNA.The film was co-written by Joss Whedon (""Marvel's The Avengers"") and directed by Drew Goddard--the latter of whom wrote and/or directed several episodes of Whedon's ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" TV series as well as the conspiracy-heavy TV drama Lost. Both collaborators bring a satirical sensibility to this horror entry. Cabin reveals its core conceit in its opening scenes (though less-knowing viewers may be hard-pressed to connect the dots early on), and so perhaps the film has less bite (pun intended) than it would have were it to wait until later. Still, the twists, when they happen, are more intriguing than draining, especially by the climax, which manages to be nihilistic and liberating at the same time.""Cabin"" functions as a witty indictment and an apology of sorts for the clich&eacute;s of contemporary horror cinema and the slasher subgenre in particular.

Horror fans will enjoy the nods to classic movies that occur in almost every scene but anyone watching it cold will probably wonder what all the critical acclaim was about.The film starts at some mysterious government facility looking to do something fairly evil things at a remote location involving some teenagers. Our main characters are extremely wooden, one-dimensional school kids (who all look like 30) and quickly establish their character types in single scenes (nerd, jock, innocent, etc.) The dialog is so purely driven by exposition that I can't decide whether Joss Whedon is making a brilliant reference to the genre or just got bored trying to set up our zombie bait.Every single horror motif is shoe-horned into the first half from the harbinger (""Don't go to the house, you'll die!"") to the 'sex means death' routine that guarantees getting naked will result in a bloody, untimely demise. Meanwhile the evil organization behind the cabin is manipulating events for reasons that don't get explained until later on.*** Potential spoilers ahead ***I enjoyed the film but found the choice of monster was banal, especially given the variety of creatures available once the main plot device is exposed. I've seen enough zombies in the last five years to be completely done with them (and clearly none of the cast ever watched the Walking Dead since they're pretty bad at killing them off). The last 20 minutes starts to get increasingly ludicrous and becomes a splatter-fest with pretty bad CGI and minimum suspense. There's a token appearance at the end by Sigourney Weaver who has to reel off some bad lines of dialog - it's a waste of a great actress.*** End spoilers ***Overall, CITW is an enjoyable, fun film for horror fans but not particularly cohesive.

1552394,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008G33O0G,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[15, 22]","EDIT: I'm enjoying getting to know the cross-section of the people who loved this film and the people who hated it here on Amazon. A lot of the positive reviews are well-written with proper spelling and punctuation. The one-star/two-star reviews are mostly ""LOL THIS movie TOTALLY RETARD"". Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?Onto the film though. It is almost impossible to talk about how unbelievably awesome THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is without spoiling it. There's so much that goes on within the film that is incredibly important to how special, unique and flat-out brilliant the concept of this film is that to write a review of it without giving those parts away, so I won't even try. And there are enough reviews that go into non-spoiler territory about the specifics, so mostly I write this to share my thoughts.Sadly, because of the seeming disconnect between the critical raves for this film and the target audience for this film, this film was something of a box-office failure (it really underperformed), but I can practially guarantee that this film will have the most rabid cult horror following since the EVIL DEAD films.This is where marketing a film poorly can make or break a film based on how it's presented. Watching the commercials and trailers, it focuses strictly on the horror elements that the film is, at least in part, thumbing its nose at. When the walls of the mystery break down further and further as the remaining characters go further down the rabbit hole, this becomes less of a horror film and more of a forced examination of the tropes of the entire horror genre. Marketing the film this way, on the more gore and sex aspects of the film, will get casual horror fans in the door, but with a CinemaScore of C (D+ amongst females) and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93% at the time of its release in March 2012 (as of right now, in October of 2012, it's fallen to a 91%...), there seems to be a massive difference in what true fans of the genre who tend to look at things with a more critical eye and casual moviegoers are seeing in this film. This was also indicitive of myself and my wife seeing the film. I loved it; my wife, someone who casually enjoys Whedon's work and is more of a casual moviegoer, did not love it.It's very rare to see this kind of disconnect. Usually with genre films, if the critics enjoy it, most moviegoers will enjoy it too. However it's Roger Ebert who stated it best in his review, calling this film ""a fanboy's final exam"". That is very true of THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. While this is a film that is meant to entertain all, it is much more aimed at the moviegoers who are fed up with the horror genre and the constant recycling of films, whether they are the endless parade of sequels, witless retcons, and a slew of American remakes of Japanese Horror films (which this film HILARIOUSLY satirizes in a small but important subplot).It's also important to realize that this film was originally made back in 2009, and was in pre-production when many of the horror films coming out were of the so-called ""torture porn"" sub-genre as well as sequels to remakes and sequels to Americanized remakes, but it's remarkable how timely this film still is. Many of the trappings of modern horror cinema have extended to the current market to the point of unintentional parody, and now, we have them with the ""benefit"" of 3D, which unless the film is shot in 3D, looks terrible by all accounts when it's post-converted, and is a trend that I am very surprised that hasn't died out yet. So with all of this going on, there was a lot for horror fans like Whedon and Goddard to hate.EDIT: I realized that I haven't talked too much about the technical and artisan-style prowess of the filmmakers. Joss Whedon is a one-of-a-kind. There's a reason that people refer to his style of dialogue as ""Joss-Speak"". It's incredibly witty and whip-smart. He's absolutely not a lowest-common-denominator writer. The idea of these kids, who are all intelligent despite how the events in the film conspire to make them into cliches, having all of this wit is a little hyper-realistic, and that's part of the nature of Joss-Speak. It's like David Mamet, and no, I'm not comparing the two as artists, but the nature of their dialogue requires a certain ear. Most people who find this film's dialogue awful are not familiar with Whedon as a creative force, and it can be a little grating if you're hearing it for the first time. Drew Goddard is from the Whedon School if you will, being weaned on shows like BUFFY and ANGEL, and then moving on to shows like LOST and films like CLOVERFIELD. As a co-writer, you can tell that these two have a rhythm that compliment each other. Goddard is also a surprisingly good director. He knows more than enough on how he needed to construct this film in order to get the maximum impact, whether for the scarier or the funnier or the more human moments. The creature effects are largely loving tributes to many great creatures of the history of horror. Many of them are surprisingly done practically as opposed to using primarily CGI (with a few obvious exceptions). And for those of you who have seen it, I just have one word for you: Unicorn.It's important to understand that I am personally not a fanboy of horror films. I love a great horror film that transcends the genre. I love Carpenter's THE THING, Cronenberg's THE FLY, Landis's AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (and THE EXORCIST III), Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and so on. For me, the last great horror films I saw were Frank Darabont's THE MIST (2007) and Tomas Alfredson's LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2009). Before that, it was Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT in 2006. That's three really great horror films in the course of four years (unless you consider CLOVERFIELD a horror film, which I don't). After that came a whole lotta nothin'; at least until THE CABIN IN THE WOODS.The film that this is getting the most comparison to is Wes Craven's SCREAM and that franchise. It's mainly for two reasons: First is because of the cleverness and wit of the horror tale told within, and second is because of how 'meta' both of these films are. I know that 'meta' is a term that gets thrown around quite a bit in genre entertainment right now, and is as easily applicable to this film as well as the films of the SCREAM franchise. These are films where the horror doesn't just stay within the film, but the films are about horror films as well. SCREAM ushered in, for at least a while, a great metatextual discussion about the tropes of the slasher sub-genre and the idea of the sequel. While the conversation continued throughout the third and fourth films, the quality decreased once the third film hit. Both THE CABIN IN THE WOODS and the SCREAM franchise clearly love the horror genre but both felt that things had continued for too long in the same direction and something so new had to come along. SCREAM came along right at the right time, and you could feel its influence in so many other horror films that came after. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, judging by its lack of opening weekend success and its failure to generate the positive word-of-mouth it would've needed to compete with films like THE HUNGER GAMES due to false expectations, will likely not have the same cultural impact amongst the audience and the studios as SCREAM did, and there are a few reasons for this, but the main reason is that this film's only real fault is being too ambitious.While I don't think that's actually a fault, it's currently a reason of another big disconnect between great filmmaking and great box-office. Most people would rather have a double cheeseburger than try a new restaurant, and sometimes that's fine. I like a good double cheeseburger too. The problem, though, is just being satisfied with the same recycled fast-food entertainment over and over, because the market does dictate what things we see and read and consume. Too often, some of the most talented voices in the creative world are silenced before they're every really exposed, and it has more to do with the mass market not being ready for it yet or that people are threatened by the idea of something truly smart. I think films like EVIL DEAD 2 are films that challenge the expectations of the audience watching it and there are those that are in on it, and those that aren't. If EVIL DEAD 2 hadn't gained the following it got on home video, there never would have been ARMY OF DARKNESS five years later, which for a sequel to EVIL DEAD 2, was a pretty successful film. SCREAM is a different animal altogether because it was a great film and it made a lot of money, and by all reason, it shouldn't have. It was more of a confluence of events that made it the blockbuster it was. I'd be very interested to see how this film might have fared back during its original intended release in 2009, because, while not doomed to obscurity, it quickly faded due to the One-Two Punch of THE HUNGER GAMES and Joss Whedon's other brilliant film, THE AVENGERS, hit theaters.During and after the film, I was buzzing with energy and felt something akin to cinematic bliss. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the song playing over the end credits is Nine Inch Nails' ""Last"", which is the most creative and appropriate use of a NIN song in a film ever (and that includes songs that Trent wrote for films and SE7EN). I knew I had just seen a film that was probably the most entertaining and most invigorating film I had seen in quite some time, and at the same time, I knew that like myself and my wife, it would be polarizing amongst audiences. But what Whedon and Goddard do with this film is frame a debate amongst horror fans, and it's the most exciting debate to have: Do you hope that something different will come along that will try and test your preconceptions about the horror genre, or are you satisfied with the way things are?Many people who come into this film blind, expecting a horror film and are genre fans who are looking for the cinematic equivalent of a quickie (""Give me some boobs, some creative kills and some decent jump scares and I'm good for the night."") are going to be either furious or perplexed. I've found that the people who are supporting this film are more of the ""I Love Film"" club, because understanding the power Cinema has, you're just falling in love with how effortlessly this film shatters everything you think it would be and instead takes you into a world where anything can, and does happen.",5,Easily The Most Polarizing Horror Film in Years.

Why you get ""Cabin in the Woods,"" of course!Yes, yesterday I went to see ""Cabin in the Woods,"" with fully great expectations! I mean, many critics were going GA GA over this film. The movie trailer it's self promised a inventive variation on ""Night of the Living Dead"" & ""The Evil Dead."" Well, did it meet my expectations??? Yes, but not, YES!!! I knew going in to the movie that I was going to get a combination of those two films, & sure enough, I did, right down to the Zombies trying to force their way in to the house (btw, these Zombies had more on their minds than eating brains, an ample amout of torture was on their menu! A nod to films like ""Hostel.""), & the cellar trap door opening all by it's self, ala' ""The Evil Dead,"" with all sorts of goodies to rummage through down there! I knew by watching the trailer, that there was some sort of human intervention pulling the strings to this whole affair, but just not how it all configured, & I won't tell you either. I will tell you, this film is both a homage, & poke-age, right in the ribs, to all the films I mentioned.The first 3/4's of the movie is a very good, though not great, rotted Zombie tongue in cheek tribute to ""Night of the Living Dead"" & ""The Evil Dead,"" while ""The Truman Show"" pulled all the strings. The script was funny (Gotta love the Pothead!), the direction sharp, the editing on cue, the makeup was excellent, & the special effects & cinematography made for an atmospheric romp, but not a thrill ride. It was not until the last fourth of the movie, that ""Waxwork"" came in & weaved it's spell over my old horror movie loving heart, that ""Cabin in the Woods"" became not just a very good film, but a classic film! All I have to say is, someone let all the monsters out of the zoo, & rampage was the theme of the day! Here the make up & special effects are outstanding, & there was rhyme & reason to all this chaos, but again, I'm not telling.In the end, ""Cabin in the Woods"" was saved from an enjoyable, but eventually forgettable film, to one that all true horror addicts will love, & will want on their blu-ray players. It's just to bad the first 3/4's of the film were not as maniacal as the last fourth. We would've had at minimum, a minor masterpiece in the horror genre, but horror fans rejoice!

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[1, 1]","The Cabin in the Woods, directed by Drew Goddard, tells the story of five college students headed out to a remote cabin for spring break. Like most slasher/horror films, these teens begin to exhibit the standard clich&eacute;s. But this is all a ruse; deep below the earth, a facility monitored and controlled by a secret organization watches the five from all angles, subjecting them to whatever horrors are released. Will these students survive long enough to uncover the mystery?Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon (creator of Firefly and Dollhouse) crafted a true horror gem with &#34;Cabin,&#34; taking all the horror movie clich&eacute;s and turning them on their heads. Goddard's direction really helps to create the foreboding and eerie atmosphere that is filled with terror, and laughs? That's right. Laughs, and a lot of them. Joss Whedon brings his creative genius with dry, witty humor to the big screen. And while the humor is absolutely hysterical (I died laughing a few times), the scares are there too. The script was cinematic gold. The characters were perfectly written, nothing ever felt rushed or cut-down, and it played out with such skill and admiration for a genre that had become crap, with what Whedon calls &#34;torture porn&#34; (aka, the Saw franchise, the Hostel films, etc.). The Cabin in the Woods is filled with gory violence and kills, too, but at least the film itself has a complex story and intelligent characters. The visual effects, surprisingly, were and still are top-notch for a low-budget film, combining CG and practical effects. The musical score by David Julyan (The Prestige, Insomnia) was superb, and the acting was great, especially Fran Kranz and Richard Jenkins, with Jenkins playing one of the engineers within The Facility.The Cabin in the Woods is easily one of the best horror films of all time not for re-inventing the slasher or what scares it had, but for the mind-bending and thoughtful story that was a homage to H.P. Lovecraft and all great horror films, their creatures and abominations. On a final note: Beware, movie-goer, for your understanding of Unicorns is wrong.5/5 Stars*****",5,"Both Disturbing and Hilarious, and Then Thought-Provoking",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,2137,"['Cabin', 'Woods', 'directed', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'story', 'five', 'college', 'students', 'headed', 'out', 'remote', 'cabin', 'spring', 'break', 'most', 'slasher/horror', 'films', 'teens', 'begin', 'exhibit', 'standard', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ruse', 'deep', 'earth', 'facility', 'monitored', 'controlled', 'secret', 'organization', 'five', 'angles', 'subjecting', 'whatever', 'horrors', 'are', 'released', 'Will', 'students', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'Firefly', 'Dollhouse', 'crafted', 'true', 'horror', 'gem', '34', 'Cabin', '34', 'taking', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'turning', 'heads', 'Goddard', 'direction', 'really', 'create', 'foreboding', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'filled', 'terror', 'right', 'Laughs', 'lot', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creative', 'genius', 'dry', 'witty', 'humor', 'big', 'screen', 'humor', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'died', 'laughing', 'few', 'times', 'scares', 'are', 'there', 'too', 'script', 'was', 'cinematic', 'gold', 'characters', 'were', 'perfectly', 'written', 'nothing', 'ever', 'felt', 'rushed', 'cut-down', 'played', 'out', 'such', 'skill', 'admiration', 'genre', 'had', 'become', 'crap', 'what', 'Whedon', '34', 'torture', 'porn', '34', 'aka', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'Hostel', 'films', 'etc.', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'filled', 'gory', 'violence', 'kills', 'too', 'least', 'film', 'complex', 'story', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'visual', 'effects', 'surprisingly', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'top-notch', 'low-budget', 'film', 'combining', 'CG', 'practical', 'effects', 'musical', 'score', 'David', 'Julyan', 'Prestige', 'Insomnia', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Jenkins', 'playing', 'one', 'engineers', 'Facility.The', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'not', 're-inventing', 'slasher', 'what', 'had', 'mind-bending', 'thoughtful', 'story', 'was', 'homage', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'great', 'horror', 'films', 'creatures', 'abominations', 'final', 'note', 'Beware', 'movie-goer', 'understanding', 'Unicorns', 'wrong.5/5', 'Stars*****']",N/A

I have seen it twice at the movie theaters and could easily see it a third time.  This movie plays upon conventional horror movie stereotypes and also subtley delivers a political message at the same time.  I won't be spoiling much, since what I'm about to point out comes near the beginning of the movie.One of the chief protagonists, Marty, while being driven to a cabin in the woods with his friends, mentions about people putting computer chips in children's heads and that as a result of things like these, society needs to collapse.  We're all just too afraid to let it.  He is of course making a remark about our own increasingly depraved and decaying culture.  This remark is easily overlooked the first time you hear it, but it ultimately serves a major basisfor another observation of Marty's towards the very end of the movie.Some critics have hated the last half hour and especially the last few minutes.  I loved them though as the hellstorm of the last half hour was handled quite well for a horror movie keep in mind and the final few moments force the viewer to question who they should have been rooting for.  The main protagonists are suddenly quite selfish with the scientists being rather underappreciated as unsung heroes.  At the same time though, remember what Marty said in the beginning and also at the end.  After all, the scientists  are extremely similar to the average viewer who goes to see a horror movie.

1552437,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B008G33O0G,John Milton,"[4, 5]","It's widely acknowledged that films within the horror genre can be incredibly formulaic and easily slotted into one of the sub-genres of horror; be it vampire, werewolf, slasher, zombie, you get the idea. So, as I settled in to watch The Cabin in the Woods, I thought from the trailer that I knew what I was letting myself in for. However, this film far surpassed my expectations.The film starts off in typical horror style with a group of friends setting out for a weekend getaway off the beaten track but if you've watched the trailer, you know that this certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill fright flick.Starring Kristen Connolly (The Happening), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, Snow White and The Huntsman, Star Trek), Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz (Donnie Darko, The Village) and Jesse Williams, the film conforms to the genre norm of having a hot young cast up front to do the running around, drinking, fornicating, screaming and dying horribly; while being ably supported by Richard Jenkins (Let Me In, Wolf), Bradley Whitford (Scent of a Woman, Billy Madison) and Amy Acker (Angel, Catch Me If You Can). Oh, and there's a lovely little cameo near the end that I defy you not to smile at!The events revolving around the cabin are monitored, guided and controlled akin to some dark version of The Truman Show; and if that's where things stopped, The Cabin in the Woods would be a solid horror film worthy of merit. However, there's a far more sinister hand at work behind the scenes than merely providing murderous reality entertainment and it is the parallel plotline of the puppetmasters at work behind the scenes that really starts to set The Cabin in the Woods apart from the rest of the pack.As always, I appreciated the practical effects involved in The Cabin in the Woods but on a critical note, there was a considerable amount of CGI. In my opinion, the CG effects were only used where necessary in all but a few scenes.The Cabin in the Woods is the brainchild of Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon. The two have collaborated for years together on the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Angel TV series; a fact which shines through here. The wise-ass humour, characters and general feel of proceedings all seems very familiar stylistically but I would suggest that this is no bad thing.For some, horror films are now all about how grotesque the next torture scene is or how diabolical the situation the hapless protagonists find themselves in. That's very much not the case with The Cabin in the Woods. This film, to my mind, is a veritable love letter to the genre and there's more than one nod to various films; the titular cabin and its set-up are a little reminiscent of The Evil Dead to name one. Additionally, I could not help but feel that the film was acting as a bit of a mirror, showing the viewer how desensitised to horror they had become by having the characters demonstrate this on-screen and on that note, I will say no more about the plot and its intricacies, for fear of robbing the movie of its true potential.I've tried hard to think of another horror movie that has been so incisive within the genre and all I can think of is Wes Craven's Scream; taking the stereotypical cast of a teen slasher flick and throwing an entirely novel element into the mix, creating a heady brew and some strong horror entertainment indeed.",5,Horror entertainment with wide-appeal,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3343,"['widely', 'acknowledged', 'films', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'formulaic', 'easily', 'slotted', 'one', 'sub-genres', 'horror', 'be', 'werewolf', 'slasher', 'zombie', 'get', 'idea', 'So', 'settled', 'watch', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'thought', 'trailer', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'letting', 'However', 'film', 'far', 'surpassed', 'expectations.The', 'film', 'typical', 'horror', 'style', 'group', 'friends', 'setting', 'out', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'beaten', 'track', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'trailer', 'know', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'run-of-the-mill', 'fright', 'flick.Starring', 'Kristen', 'Connolly', 'Happening', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Anna', 'Hutchison', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Village', 'Jesse', 'Williams', 'film', 'conforms', 'genre', 'norm', 'having', 'hot', 'young', 'cast', 'up', 'front', 'do', 'running', 'around', 'drinking', 'fornicating', 'screaming', 'dying', 'horribly', 'being', 'ably', 'supported', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Let', 'Me', 'Wolf', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Angel', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Oh', 'lovely', 'little', 'cameo', 'end', 'defy', 'not', 'smile', 'events', 'revolving', 'cabin', 'are', 'monitored', 'guided', 'controlled', 'akin', 'dark', 'version', 'Truman', 'Show', 'where', 'things', 'stopped', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'horror', 'film', 'worthy', 'merit', 'However', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'hand', 'work', 'scenes', 'merely', 'providing', 'murderous', 'reality', 'entertainment', 'parallel', 'plotline', 'puppetmasters', 'work', 'scenes', 'really', 'set', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'apart', 'rest', 'pack.As', 'always', 'appreciated', 'practical', 'effects', 'involved', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'critical', 'note', 'was', 'considerable', 'amount', 'CGI', 'opinion', 'CG', 'effects', 'were', 'only', 'used', 'where', 'necessary', 'few', 'scenes.The', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'brainchild', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'two', 'have', 'collaborated', 'years', 'together', 'likes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'TV', 'series', 'fact', 'here', 'wise-ass', 'humour', 'characters', 'general', 'feel', 'proceedings', 'very', 'familiar', 'stylistically', 'would', 'suggest', 'bad', 'thing.For', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'now', 'how', 'grotesque', 'next', 'torture', 'scene', 'how', 'diabolical', 'situation', 'hapless', 'protagonists', 'find', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'case', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'film', 'mind', 'veritable', 'love', 'letter', 'genre', 'more', 'one', 'nod', 'various', 'films', 'titular', 'cabin', 'set-up', 'are', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'name', 'one', 'Additionally', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'bit', 'mirror', 'showing', 'viewer', 'how', 'desensitised', 'horror', 'had', 'become', 'having', 'characters', 'demonstrate', 'on-screen', 'note', 'will', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'plot', 'intricacies', 'fear', 'robbing', 'movie', 'true', 'potential.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'hard', 'think', 'horror', 'movie', 'been', 'so', 'incisive', 'genre', 'can', 'think', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Scream', 'taking', 'stereotypical', 'cast', 'teen', 'slasher', 'flick', 'throwing', 'entirely', 'novel', 'element', 'mix', 'creating', 'heady', 'brew', 'strong', 'horror', 'entertainment', 'indeed']",N/A

The Cabin in the Woods is a creative and original horror film that effectively blends some dark humor and satirizes the genre.The story is unique and entertaining; the concept is executed perfectly. It starts off by introducing the college students and the secret organization. The technicians are hilarious, while the students are very generic, and this is obviously on purpose; we have the jock, the bimbo, the stoner, etc. basically the characters you'd expect from a film based on a cabin in the woods. We also have scenes that poke fun at the genre, like the stop at the mysterious, abandoned-like gas station. It's not a pure-breed horror film, but it balances the jokes and scares very well. My favorite part of the film was the final sequence when the monsters are loose in the facility; we see nightmarish creatures causing havoc like killer clowns, werewolves, zombies, and a pinhead style creature but with saws instead of pins (sawhead, maybe?). This final sequence was exhilarating and frightening at the same time and beautifully shot. The actual ending was also amazing and broke the formula we've seen hundreds of times. The acting was great, the special effects were great, the music was amazing, and the story was thoroughly entertaining.Overall, The Cabin in the Woods is a unique horror film that effectively blends some humor; it moves at a very fast pace and is a very entertaining film. I highly recommend this film, if you're not a big fan of horror-comedy movies then I recommend a rental.The Cabin in the Woods has strong violence and gore, and some nudity.

Once at the cabin there's music, partying, then a bump from the cellar that causes them to go investigate and from there the trip turns deadly as they begin experiencing plenty of horrifying things.All of this sounds like your basic horror fare, but in this movie its played for laughs mostly as all of the things going on in and around the general vicinity of the cabin are controlled by a team of people in a bunker type TV studio where the employees even take bets on what cliche the people in the cabin will do next. Its of course very cheesy in its presentation but thanks to Joss Whedon (Creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and director of ""The Avengers"") who helped write this, a lot of what goes on his fresh and the concept while goofy is fun to see unfold.The cast includes Chris Hemsworth (""Thor""), the beautiful Kristen Connonlly (""The Bay""), Richard Jenkins (""Let Me In"") and others mos of which are the cardboard cut out horror cliches characters.

Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were frightening.  Well, that were meant to be.  I never jumped or got scared at all.  What I got was a story that told me a lot while at the same time leaving me wishing I could see more.  I do not want to give anything away.  So I will only say that some people go to a cabin.  Once there the choices they make may determine their fate.  If the fate it not met, worse thing may be in their future.  VERY interesting.  I think it would make a cool anime or comic.  There was one part with nudity.  Not much at all.  There was some language as well.  It really didn't have as much gore as I thought.  There was one part that was gory.  But like a lot of the things that happen in this movie, I found myself laughing.  Not because it was stupid.  Just the way things happened.  If you are going to see this movie because you want to see horror or gore, you better chose a different movie, but if you want to see an interesting idea with a bit of death, this is a movie that you will enjoy.Something else I would like to add.  There are movies like Saw that lay on the gore.  Making people die in far to exaggerated ways.  This movie didn't really do that.

This movie cleverly legitimatizes it.This movie would actually get a 4.5 in my books, it has just about everything to be entertaining in one way or another.The comedy is dark but spot on and clever in execution.The story attempts to be plausible (for the situation) I have to tip my hat to that.The action (yes action) is exciting and well executed with unexpected results.The because of all of the above horror is over shadowed. I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be and I think this is because the pacing was so fast. It took this movie more into the action genre then horror. Hence the 4/5.I loved the verity of creepy monsters in the movie. It put a danger scale on the each of the monsters which was much appreciated and really added to the tension.However I HATED some of the CGI on some of the monsters ... it just made em look cartoonish and really brought me out of the atmosphere. To be honest they didn't even need to show the full bodies if they where going to use CGI, quick flashes and blood splatters would have sufficed.All in all it was a fun ride and I hope to see more movies like this.If they refine it a little more they can add a whole new dimension to the horror movie genre.",4,Fun Fun Fun and a bit stupid.,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,2014,"['Hey', 'guys', 'let', 'grab', 'even-ish', 'number', 'attractive', 'young', 'adults', 'go', 'party', 'weekend', 'isolated', 'country', 'cabin', '*yawn', 'seen', 'it*Hey', 'guys', 'let', 'explore', 'mysteriously', 'creepy', 'cabin', '*yawn', 'seen', 'it*Hey', 'guys', 'creepy', 'things', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'cabin', '*yawn', 'seen', 'it*Hadley', '[', 'sighs', 'freaking', 'zombies', 'Remember', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'throw', 'girl', 'volcano', '*Wait', 'WTF', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', '*Hadley', 'am', 'never', 'gon', 'see', 'merman', 'Ever.Sitterson', 'Dude', 'be', 'thankful', 'things', 'are', 'terrifying', 'cleanup', 'nightmare', 'Out', 'Loud', '*This', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'jab', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'justification', 'brilliant', '.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'group', 'young', 'adults', 'have', 'die', 'when', 'visit', 'scary', 'situation', 'old', 'cabin', 'scary', 'mansion', 'old', 'factory', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'it.This', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'get', '4.5', 'books', 'just', 'about', 'everything', 'be', 'entertaining', 'one', 'way', 'another.The', 'comedy', 'dark', 'spot', 'clever', 'execution.The', 'story', 'attempts', 'be', 'plausible', 'situation', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'that.The', 'action', 'yes', 'action', 'exciting', 'well', 'executed', 'unexpected', 'results.The', 'above', 'horror', 'shadowed', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'scared', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'think', 'pacing', 'was', 'so', 'fast', 'took', 'movie', 'more', 'action', 'genre', 'then', 'horror', 'Hence', '4/5.I', 'loved', 'verity', 'creepy', 'monsters', 'movie', 'put', 'danger', 'scale', 'monsters', 'was', 'much', 'appreciated', 'really', 'added', 'tension.However', 'HATED', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'just', 'made', 'em', 'look', 'cartoonish', 'really', 'brought', 'atmosphere', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'show', 'full', 'bodies', 'where', 'going', 'use', 'CGI', 'quick', 'flashes', 'blood', 'splatters', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed.All', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'this.If', 'refine', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre']",N/A

I didn't even read blurb on the back of the case. (if I had, I probably never would have watched it. Maybe. Chris Hemsworth, ya know?) I admit, I thought I was getting a horror movie. Instead, it was mostly a snooze fest. Sometimes you can throw a bunch of tropes into a film and twist them to be awesome (ie, Tucker and Dale vs Evil). Other times you end up with a lame trope-filled movie. Snappy dialogue and a great cast doesn't save this movie. I don't know where it is supposed to take place, but I'm guessing West Virginia.**********Spoilers***********Ok, first we have the Scooby Gang: Fred, Daphne, Thelma, Shaggy, and Scooby Doo, in an RV, going on a trip. Seriously, all hawt guy Chris Hemsworth needs is a purple ascot. Daphne is played by just-dyed-her-hair-blonde (lol) Anna Hutchison, Thelma by Kristen Connolly, Shaggy by Fran Kranz, and Scooby by Jesse Williams. (It did not escape my notice the only dark skinned guy in the group has the role of the dog. Just sayin.) These complete idiots (they are drugged somehow to become this way) are predictably killed one-by-one in yawn inducing fashion. Along the way to a ""vacation"" cabin, they stop by a dilapidated gas station, where they are (kinda) warned off by an old man who is later used for lolz and never seen again. The Mystery Machine drives through a tunnel next to a vertigo-inducing ravine, finally arriving so there can be some bikini shots and thought-provoking (not) oddities revealed. It's downhill from there. (while I guessed there would be zombies, I missed that they would be redneck cultist zombies.)I was caught off guard when the villain is finally revealed (sort of) at the end. I admit I didn't see that one coming.The over-the-top betting on outcomes, yelling at a screen ""Lemme see the boobies"" etc, was WAY too much disregard for fellow human beings.  Why do the bad guys fail? Because they are unprofessional morons. Even Fred (Buffy reference, lol), played by Amy Acker, couldn't pull these guys from the brink. Her role appeared to exist to be ridiculed by the village idiots. Because she's female, I assume. Or maybe she was an intern? who knows. I think the film showed way too much of the other side. Sometimes less really is more. (did anyone else feel sorry for ""Pinhead""? He looked so sad, like his puppy had just died, and he really, REALLY, needed a hug.)I thought this movie just tried too hard to be... something. It failed miserably. I think it would have done much better if the villains had been thwarted at every turn by the genius-level college kids who have defied their stereotypes. (ie, bad guy says to other bad guy ""What the hell do you mean they're going to college to be doctors and economics experts? I told you to find some idiots!) I mean, who sees the outcome of ""all the victims live""? OK, so they would have died at the end, but still.One star for the ending& the sheer blasphemy of the film, one star for having Chris Hemsworth in the cast.

I suspected from the trailers that it wasn't your usual slice 'em and dice 'em horror flick, so I got it and watched it - twice.For me, what made the difference was the story. It actually had one. And it was quite ingenious as well. There were a few holes in it, like how did they really get this cabin in the first place, but when a story is good, I can always suspend belief. The entertainment industry as a whole, often forces us to suspend belief in many movies and shows. If I start telling the story here, I will give away too much of the treats this movie dishes out from the beginning. Let me just say, it is horror, so if blood and gore is not your thing, you probably won't like this one. But, if you aren't put off by it, there are juicy rewards at the end of this movie that separates it from the rest of the mindless horror flicks out there.I recommend this with the caveat that you aren't squeamish and easily frightened. It is that rare horror movie that is actually entertaining, with a good story overall. It won't win awards, but it is surprisingly satisfying for a genre loaded with bad movies. I really liked it. Good cast, smart script, decent acting, and worth paying for if you are in the mood for an hour and a half or so of escapism entertainment. Great popcorn movie with friends!

The entire first half you think they totally ripped off the Evil Dead, and then it turns everything ""horror"" on its head. I loved the set up of the architypes. The Whore (Anna Hutchison) The Athlete (Chris Hemsworth) The Scholar (Jesse Williams) The Fool (Fran Kranz) and The Virgin (Kristen Connolly), but when we first meet them we learn that Jules (Hutchison) isn't all that whore-like and Curt (Hemsworth) is at college on an ACADEMIC scholarship and that Dana (Connolly) isn't even a virgin. It's all about how society wouuld conceptualize them. The acting is brilliant, Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins are hilarious and Whedon favorite Amy Acker brings a sense of reality while acting opposite those two. Hemsworth and Hutchison have a real down to earth chemistry about them and Williams brings warmth and light to a role that could have easily been overshadowed. But the real star of this is the hilariously high and perfectly disheveled Fran Kranz as Marty. He's a cross between Scooby and Shaggy. He's so funny and yet so loyal to this group of friends even though it's clear he is the fifth wheel. Every scene he's in he manages to steal. Real bright future for him ahead.All in all this typical, non typical ""horror"" film will leave you with the biggest sense of WTF?

1552477,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008G33O0G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 21]","With geek god Joss Whedon (creator of TV's Buffy and Firefly among other fan favorites) on board, it's fair to say that the expectations for ""The Cabin in the Woods"" were quite high for enthusiasts of the horror genre. Here he shares a writing credit with the film's director Drew Goddard and the result is one of the year's more entertaining experiments. I truly think that this is a film that will suffer due to those that are willing to discuss too many of the plot points in advance, so I'll be brief in my actual descriptions. I will say this, though, the less you know about the movie--the more fun you can have. In my opinion, even the advertising campaign and trailers hint at too much. You know from the start that this isn't your typical fright fest. Instead, what is served plays up and skewers every horror movie cliche imaginable. It is both hip and witty, as well as smarter than it has any right to be. It twists movie conventions around in clever new ways and makes something that seems remarkably fresh and different. And if you're a fan of horror movies, this is simply fun, fun, fun.Of course, we all know the genre of movies that involve a cabin in the woods (or other appropriately desolate place). Let's get a car full of kids, strand them, and then start picking them off in increasingly creative ways. At the start, that's exactly the scenario that ""The Cabin in the Woods"" sets up. We meet five standard character archetypes for these type of films: the jock (Chris Hemsworth), the stoner (Fran Kranz), the good girl (Kristen Connolly), the vixen (Anna Hutchison) , and the scholar (Jesse Williams). After a brief bit of character introduction, we're off to the woods. As they settle in, each rises to their individual stereotype. First there's drunken revelry, then there's the discovery of a very spooky basement, and then mayhem ensues. What's going on and can anyone survive? If you've seen the trailers, however, (and if not, this is also included as the first scenes in the movie) you know that there is something more complex at work behind the scenes. But that's all you get from me. Let's just say that the film turns into a post-modern game as much as a traditional horror endeavor.The film really works on several levels. It's funny without being overly precious. It always knowingly involves the audience in its sense of gamesmanship. The fact that we have more information than the characters (but not everything, of course) makes us complicit in an enjoyable voyeuristic experience. And yet, there are plenty of scares and surprises in store. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" has relatively moderate goals, it just wants to put on a good show. The ending pushes quite far and is deliriously over-the-top. It may not stand up to much intellectual scrutiny, but I didn't care. I was just along for the ride. This may not necessarily be considered among the ""best"" movies of the year, but it is easily one of the more entertaining ones. And in that way, Whedon and Goddard have honored horror movie fans everywhere. For sheer entertainment, about 4 1/2 stars.

1552487,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B008G33O0G,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[20, 30]","I went into ""Cabin in the Woods"" with zero expectations. I tried to stay as far away from the hype machine as possible. I avoided all trailers and tv spots, I didn't read a single review, and I didn't watch a single interview with any of the cast or crew. I wanted this movie going experience to be as ""pure"" as possible. All I knew going in was that it was written by Joss Whedon (creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and it featured a college aged cast trapped in a cabin...in the woods. Seriously, that's all I knew going into the film. I didn't want to know the twists and the turns. I know what expectations can do to a person and I know especially what it can do to a horror fan. So into the movie I went with a clear head ready for a new tale of terror. Let the carnage begin!""Cabin in the Woods"" begins with five college students driving out for a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. Among the group we have the beautiful and slightly ""impure"" Dana (Kristen Connolly) along with her attractive hunky jock boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth). We have the plain but pretty Jules (Anna Hutchison) who is being set up for a date with book smart boy-next-door Holden (Jesse Williams). Along as the fifth wheel is the punchline stoner Marty (Fran Kranz). That's all I'm going to tell you. Giving away what happens before or after this event will most likely hinder your enjoyment of the movie. All I can say is that some will die, some may live, and there is plenty of blood to be sprayed all around.If there is one thing that has to be said for ""Cabin in the Woods"" it is that it has a ton of ambition. Far more so than any other horror movie I've seen in years. The ""twist"" (which I refuse to give away even though many, many trailers and reviews have) is very clever and ingenious in concept. Like other ""meta"" horror movies, I enjoyed the references ""Cabin in the Woods"" made to past horror movies (particularly those in the slasher genre). However, that is where my love for the movie both began and ended. I thought this movie was a bit of a mess with no real follow through and an ending that was just lazy screenwriting. I appreciated the concept behind this movie (which, again, I don't want to give too much away so I am being deliberately vague) but found the execution lacking. I also hated pretty much all of the characters and the ""comic"" relief felt flat to me. I couldn't wait for the ""stoner"" character to die and the less said about that, the better.I can understand and appreciate why people love this horror movie. It's something different. It isn't PG-13 and it isn't a remake. Nonetheless, I was left quite cold. This film attempts to be a clever horror-comedy packed with meta self awareness. Clever it is. Funny or scary? Not so much. This film is being billed as ""Scream"" for the next generation. That it is not. ""Scream"", for all its meta self awareness was both scary and funny as hell. Everything and everyone associated with this picture appear to either be trying far too hard or not enough, I'm not exactly sure which. I know I am in the minority here so if you have a desire to see this film by all means go out there and enjoy the hell out of it. I wanted to and didn't. I appreciate it when any horror movie gets recognition and acclaim. I love to see horror movies that make people fall in love with genre again.

1552490,AV4645DYR9KUL,B008G33O0G,Kyle N.,"[0, 0]","Only Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon could make a movie like this. Written by both and directed by Drew Goddard, this movie defies all expectations in its satire of slasher films and torture porn. In what is described as an attempt to ""revitalize"" the genre, Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard create a brilliant satire of that very same genre, one that can truly be appreciated by anyone (but especially horror fans), albeit a not very scary one.The movie follows four college-aged students who decided to take a weekend trip to a cabin to get away. Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly) is the protagonist here (although even her role is looked at in a very satirical way, as is every character), joined by the jock Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth), his girlfriend Jules Louden (Anna Hutchinson), the stoner Marty Mikalski, and the intelligent and nice guy Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams). The casts is also rounded out by the workers who seem to be pulling the strings (their existence is no spoiler, as their role is seen and heavily implied from the beginning of the film, but for those who don't know much, I will avoid spilling as much as I can), the technicians Gary Stitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford), the security guard Daniel Truman (Brian White), and the chemical technician Wendy Lin (Amy Acker).The plot of the movie takes some interesting turns throughout the movie as the purpose of the cabin is explained. Without saying anything, this movie has a wholly unique and meta premise that brings the satire in full force. There's a reason that only these two writers could make a movie like this, it's full of their unique brand of storytelling and complete love and understanding of horror films. The movie is consistently brilliant in its satire: the five characters are built to be obvious stereotypes of horror movie characters (in fact, the movie references them itself: the Athlete, the Whore, the Fool, the Scholar, and the Virgin) while at the same time playing with the truth in these stereotypes, characters who make smart decisions are then influenced to make dumb ones (the trailer highlights on of the best moments in reference to the concept of splitting up), and many more moments truly show an understanding of the various tropes that exist in these films. Nothing escapes this movie's intelligent and affectionate satire of the genre, and it goes a long way towards enjoying the movie. This alone is why this movie is highly recommended to anyone who loves horror films and anyone who also berates them for their lack of intelligence and originality. Both groups will find this movie to speak to them perfectly.Only, a few problems still exist in the film, albeit small ones that won't detract too much from the experience. The film will really only appeal to the aforementioned groups. Casual fans and anyone just looking for a scare will be wholly disappointed. Despite this movie's obvious love for horror films, it just isn't that scary. The slasher moments don't last a lot of the film, and the scares here are few and far between. The movie focuses much more on parodying the genre than it does actually being a part of the genre. This film will also not amaze anyone with its acting. Not to say the acting isn't good, but it just doesn't stand out too much. The actors and really aren't given a whole lot of chance to stretch their skills anyways, since the movie's focus is so strongly on its writing (which is not necessarily a bad thing, since it is the film's biggest strength).Overall, this is not necessarily a pinnacle of the slasher film genre, and most likely not one to ""revitalize"" it as the Goddard and Whedon may have hoped. However, this is still an extremely smart film that will be enjoyed by anyone who can appreciate the affection satire. This movie parodies and makes fun of all of the typical tropes of horror films so brilliantly without losing the obvious love it has for them. Still, it will mostly only be enjoyed for that, as the movie is not particularly scary or thrilling otherwise.",4,A brilliantly plotted but not very scary horror film.,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,4055,"['Only', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'Written', 'directed', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'movie', 'expectations', 'satire', 'slasher', 'films', 'torture', 'porn', 'what', 'described', 'attempt', 'revitalize', 'genre', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'create', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'very', 'same', 'genre', 'one', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'especially', 'horror', 'fans', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'one.The', 'movie', 'four', 'college-aged', 'students', 'who', 'decided', 'take', 'weekend', 'trip', 'cabin', 'get', 'away', 'Dana', 'Polk', 'Kristen', 'Connolly', 'protagonist', 'here', 'even', 'role', 'looked', 'very', 'satirical', 'way', 'character', 'joined', 'jock', 'Curt', 'Vaughan', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'girlfriend', 'Jules', 'Louden', 'Anna', 'Hutchinson', 'stoner', 'Marty', 'Mikalski', 'intelligent', 'nice', 'guy', 'Holden', 'McCrea', 'Jesse', 'Williams', 'casts', 'also', 'rounded', 'out', 'workers', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'pulling', 'strings', 'existence', 'spoiler', 'role', 'seen', 'heavily', 'implied', 'beginning', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'will', 'avoid', 'spilling', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'technicians', 'Gary', 'Stitterson', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Steve', 'Hadley', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'security', 'guard', 'Daniel', 'Truman', 'Brian', 'White', 'chemical', 'technician', 'Wendy', 'Lin', 'Amy', 'Acker', '.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'interesting', 'movie', 'purpose', 'cabin', 'explained', 'saying', 'anything', 'movie', 'wholly', 'unique', 'meta', 'premise', 'satire', 'full', 'force', 'reason', 'only', 'two', 'writers', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'full', 'unique', 'brand', 'storytelling', 'complete', 'love', 'understanding', 'horror', 'films', 'movie', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'five', 'characters', 'are', 'built', 'be', 'obvious', 'stereotypes', 'horror', 'movie', 'characters', 'fact', 'movie', 'Athlete', 'Whore', 'Fool', 'Scholar', 'Virgin', 'same', 'time', 'playing', 'truth', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'smart', 'decisions', 'are', 'then', 'influenced', 'make', 'dumb', 'ones', 'trailer', 'highlights', 'best', 'moments', 'reference', 'concept', 'splitting', 'up', 'many', 'more', 'moments', 'truly', 'show', 'understanding', 'various', 'tropes', 'exist', 'films', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'affectionate', 'satire', 'genre', 'long', 'way', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'alone', 'why', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'films', 'anyone', 'who', 'also', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'originality', 'groups', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'speak', 'perfectly.Only', 'few', 'problems', 'still', 'exist', 'film', 'small', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'experience', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'only', 'appeal', 'aforementioned', 'groups', 'Casual', 'fans', 'anyone', 'just', 'looking', 'scare', 'will', 'be', 'wholly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'obvious', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'slasher', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'lot', 'film', 'scares', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'parodying', 'genre', 'actually', 'being', 'part', 'genre', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'not', 'amaze', 'anyone', 'acting', 'Not', 'say', 'acting', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'actors', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'whole', 'lot', 'chance', 'stretch', 'skills', 'anyways', 'movie', 'focus', 'so', 'strongly', 'writing', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'biggest', 'strength', '.Overall', 'not', 'necessarily', 'pinnacle', 'slasher', 'film', 'genre', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'one', 'revitalize', 'Goddard', 'Whedon', 'may', 'have', 'hoped', 'However', 'still', 'extremely', 'smart', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'affection', 'satire', 'movie', 'parodies', 'fun', 'typical', 'tropes', 'horror', 'films', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'losing', 'obvious', 'love', 'Still', 'will', 'mostly', 'only', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'thrilling', 'otherwise']",N/A

1552505,AX9C10JD538D9,B008G33O0G,Liviania,"[2, 3]","I wanted to see The Cabin in the Woods back when it was in theaters.  But every time I went to the movies during that time period I was with someone else.  And they never wanted to see a horror movie, either because horror was too scary or because they considered it a dumb and predictable genre.  (And let's face it, I'm not about to accuse slasher films of being smart.  Their feelings were not invalid.)  But The Cabin in the Woods is not a horror film.  There's about 45 minutes of a slasher film in it, but it isn't really scary and I don't think it's meant to be.  It's mostly a horror parody, with a pinch of satire thrown in for flavor.The Cabin in the Woods is the product of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Drew Goddard (Cloverfield).  They both wrote the script and Goddard directed.  I can definitely see Whedon's mark on the story, so if you don't like his style, The Cabin in the Woods probably won't work for you.  I am totally unfamiliar with Goddard, but this film was a great first impression.  There's one scene, where a character goes out into the woods and looks over his shoulder, because it is a little creepy outside.  The audience can see the monster weaving in and out of the shadows, but the character just misses her.  It's beautifully framed.  And I can say that for several scenes in this movie - the way things move in and out of frame is very well done.One thing The Cabin in the Woods does very well is that it doesn't fight the cast's charisma.  In too many horror films you just don't care if everyone dies or if anyone escapes the monster.  Chris Hemsworth is the movie's only big name (though he wasn't when the movie was filmed), and anyone whose seen Thor and The Avengers knows he's a pretty jovial presence.  He's the alpha male of the group and a football player, but he's also shown to be smart, both well read and a good problem solver.  After all, the boxes horror movies put people into are ridiculous.  The Cabin in the Woods shatters those stereotypes.  At the same time, it offers a reason for them.The Cabin in the Woods pokes behind the scenes of horror movies, teasing out totally ridiculous reasons for why horror characters act the way they do.  One of the pleasures of The Cabin in the Woods is how it flings the silly, the mundane, and the brutal together.  I know lots of people who were disappointed by the third act and others who thought it was brilliant.  I veer towards brilliant.  It's slower paced than the rest of the movie, but it's different and exciting.  I think most people don't like it because it's where the film totally leaves traditional American horror behind.And, that's about as much as I can say without giving anything away.  Now, I actually think some of the ""spoiler"" arguments around this movie are dumb.  It would be just as fun if you know what's coming.  But at the same time, there's a pleasure in keeping mum.  I'll leave it at this: it's a fun movie and I've been enjoying thinking through the layers.My final word is to those who don't like gore.  The Cabin in the Woods is definitely not torture porn, and while there's quite a bit of gore, most of it is shot in a discretionary way.  If you don't like any blood, this isn't the film for you.  But there are no over-the-top gross gore scenes, in my opinion.",5,Clever and funny,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,3309,"['wanted', 'see', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'time', 'went', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'never', 'wanted', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'either', 'horror', 'was', 'too', 'scary', 'considered', 'dumb', 'predictable', 'genre', 'let', 'face', ""'m"", 'not', 'accuse', 'slasher', 'films', 'being', 'smart', 'feelings', 'were', 'not', 'invalid', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'not', 'horror', 'film', '45', 'minutes', 'slasher', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'mostly', 'horror', 'parody', 'pinch', 'satire', 'thrown', 'flavor.The', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'product', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Cloverfield', 'wrote', 'script', 'Goddard', 'directed', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'Whedon', 'mark', 'story', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'style', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'am', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'Goddard', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'impression', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'out', 'woods', 'over', 'shoulder', 'little', 'creepy', 'outside', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'monster', 'weaving', 'shadows', 'character', 'just', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'can', 'say', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'way', 'things', 'move', 'frame', 'very', 'well', 'done.One', 'thing', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'fight', 'cast', 'charisma', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'everyone', 'anyone', 'monster', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'movie', 'only', 'big', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'anyone', 'seen', 'Thor', 'Avengers', 'pretty', 'jovial', 'presence', 'alpha', 'male', 'group', 'football', 'player', 'also', 'shown', 'be', 'smart', 'well', 'read', 'good', 'problem', 'solver', 'boxes', 'horror', 'movies', 'put', 'people', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'shatters', 'stereotypes', 'same', 'time', 'reason', 'them.The', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'pokes', 'scenes', 'horror', 'movies', 'teasing', 'out', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'reasons', 'why', 'horror', 'characters', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'One', 'pleasures', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'how', 'silly', 'mundane', 'brutal', 'together', 'know', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'third', 'act', 'others', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'veer', 'towards', 'brilliant', 'slower', 'paced', 'rest', 'movie', 'different', 'exciting', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'where', 'film', 'totally', 'traditional', 'American', 'horror', 'behind.And', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Now', 'actually', 'think', 'spoiler', 'arguments', 'movie', 'are', 'dumb', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'fun', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'same', 'time', 'pleasure', 'keeping', 'mum', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'fun', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'thinking', 'layers.My', 'final', 'word', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gore', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'definitely', 'not', 'torture', 'porn', 'quite', 'bit', 'gore', 'most', 'shot', 'discretionary', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'blood', ""n't"", 'film', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'gross', 'gore', 'scenes', 'opinion']",N/A

With that said:I would suggest watching the film twice and keeping an open mind. There are a lot of things that are done purposefully that will bug the hell out of some people. However, it is all done for a reason. Personally, I enjoyed the film the first time, but then I really found an appreciation for how well it was put together the second time that I watched it.Also, bear in mind that that there are a lot of people that watch a movie and leave halfway through, talk a lot, or just simply don't like certain types of movies. If you have trouble paying attention during a film then you will probably miss some of the things that make this movie so enjoyable (another reason to watch it twice). I would suggest plodding through the movie - even if you don't enjoy the first half. Remember, there has to be some reason why us Amazonian idiots like it so much.I would like to end this review by stating that I really enjoyed this movie (I only gave this 4 stars because I figured that people would be more likely to read one of the 20 4 star reviews than one of the 80+ 5 star reviews). I'm not a Joss Whedon follower, and am not saying that you need to see this film because I am in love with an infallible director. Hell, he's human and can make bad movies, too. I'm just writing this review because I feel like a lot of people have some strange expectations for this film and give up on it too early, or just dislike it because it's not meeting the hype (I think this ruins movies more than anything else). If nothing else, I would suggest renting it on Red Box.",4,an enjoyable cinematic experience,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1830,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'suggest', 'read', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'just', 'watch', 'will', 'get', 'best', 'experience', 'have', 'expectations', 'fact', 'bunch', 'weirdos', 'amazon', 'somehow', 'loved', 'others', 'hated', 'said', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'film', 'twice', 'keeping', 'open', 'mind', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'purposefully', 'will', 'bug', 'hell', 'people', 'However', 'done', 'reason', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'really', 'found', 'appreciation', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'it.Also', 'bear', 'mind', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'leave', 'halfway', 'talk', 'lot', 'just', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'certain', 'types', 'movies', 'have', 'trouble', 'paying', 'attention', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'miss', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'reason', 'watch', 'twice', 'would', 'suggest', 'plodding', 'movie', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'first', 'half', 'Remember', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'Amazonian', 'idiots', 'so', 'much.I', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'review', 'stating', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'figured', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'read', 'one', '20', '4', 'star', 'reviews', 'one', '80+', '5', 'star', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'follower', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'am', 'love', 'infallible', 'director', 'Hell', 'human', 'can', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'too', ""'m"", 'just', 'writing', 'review', 'feel', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'strange', 'expectations', 'film', 'give', 'up', 'too', 'early', 'just', 'dislike', 'not', 'meeting', 'hype', 'think', 'movies', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'suggest', 'renting', 'Red', 'Box']",N/A

Instead, it's a very smart parody of one, made both to wink at and make fun of the horror movie audiences that have evolved over the years. Don't think it's mean-spirited, either. The film is a helluva a lot of fun, and even though the ending is very obviously thumbing its nose at the audience, it would've completely cheapened the whole movie if it had ended in any other way.I shouldn't really be talking about the ending. I don't want to give anything away, after all. Although, with this film, talking about nearly any part of it is giving something very important away. Instead, I'll focus on the two elements that the movie poster, the trailer, and even the title provide.The set-up is common and obvious, in a nothing-up-my-sleeves sort of way. A stoner, jock, nerd (barely qualifies), slut, and virgin (also barely qualifies) go on a weekend trip to a spooky cabin in the woods. This premise is pretty basic, and really the only element that changes is what horror awaits them. At the same time that these young victims are placed in a typical horror movie setting, they are being watched by people who are in a far less typical horror movie setting.The metaphors for the audience are hard to miss. Viewers of the film are turned into characters within the film, and the end result is a film that gratifies an audience's less unique horror movie needs while also turning the whole thing into a brilliant analysis of itself, an analysis that's hilarious on-screen, but which also stuck with me for days after I'd watched the film. The power of a horror film is to take a specific moment and magnify the mortality of it so that viewers can't help but sympathize; it's about taking one person's fear of death and making it everyone's. This fact is the basis for this film's entire set up as well as its snarky, all-hell-breaks-loose ending.The point being that you will laugh far more than you will scream or shudder.

1552535,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008G33O0G,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","If you hate to have surprises ruined then by all means stop reading now. The only way to offer a discussion or review of the movie CABIN IN THE WOODS is to reveal the first of many surprises the film has to offer. It's not a major one and yes most people will gather what's going on before the first 30 minutes is passed but just in case you hate ALL surprises exposed then stop now.For the rest of you this is one movie that will keep you guessing until the last frame hits the screen. And it's not a film that fits comfortably into one single genre. While for the most part I'd consider it a horror film there are elements of science fiction here as well. Suffice to say that with the amount of gore and carnage involved it will most likely be considered a horror film. But unlike most horror films coming out today, this film is completely original while offering a nod or two to the films that came before it.Five college age students are set for a weekend getaway at a cabin in the woods. Curt's (Chris Hemsworth) relatives have bought this place and he and his girlfriend Jules (Anna Hutchinson) are going up with her best friend Dana (Kristin Connelly), Curt's new team mate Holden (Jesse Williams) and their stoner friend Marty (Fran Kranz). Packed up in the RV, they head towards the wilderness with no idea what they will soon encounter.Already we're tossed into familiar territory. It only becomes more so when they stop for gas to be confronted by a seemingly crazed attendant who gives them directions to their destination while telling them it's a bad place to go. You might think you know where the film is going here but trust me, you don't.While all of this plays out we're also seeing the story of what appears to be a high security, high tech location with plenty of lab coat, suit clad officials discussing some project going on. It's not long before we realize that the project is the kids heading to the cabin where this group is prepping to direct them towards what will be the last night of their lives. Why would this group do this and what are they talking about when they discuss the same thing happening in various locations around the world? Well I won't give you that much info here.The group gets to the cabin and things are set in motion early on. While they play a game of truth or dare, the basement doorway blows open and they investigate. What they find is a basement filled with all sorts of curious items from a fortune telling machine to a jewelry box to a diary that Dana begins to read from. Unfortunately these items are the methods of death that these teens are unknowingly choosing from. Back at the lab the boys in research are making bets on which they choose. Once Dana reads from the diary, redneck zombie killers are let lose to deal with the teens.Still you have to wonder what's going on. Why is this technical group putting these kids through this? What reason could they have for killing them off one by one? What is the end result from all the carnage? That's where the originality comes into play and it's something you have to watch the film to find out. While I'll let you know something is going on, I won't give away the films major secret.Everything is above par here which makes it even more compelling to watch. The acting is believable, the writing is superb and the direction well played. Particular kudos go to Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, neither known as horror film stars, who turn in truly hilarious and chilling performances. Nods to classic horror films are seen throughout, everything from EVIL DEAD to HELLRAISER and more. Part of the fun is during the third act recognizing every horror film paid tribute to here.The concept that is revealed at the heart of it all is the most original thing going on here. This is no ordinary horror film. While it may appear the movie is a get kids in the woods and kill them movie there is more going on here. The depth of what is going on is more important than even the viewers realize until the end. If you like movies that surprise you, that keep you guessing and that never give up their surprise until near the end, you'll love this movie. If not, trust me, it might give you a few chills before it ends.",4,A TRIBUTE THAT'S ORIGINAL,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,4229,"['hate', 'have', 'surprises', 'ruined', 'then', 'means', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'only', 'way', 'offer', 'discussion', 'review', 'movie', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'reveal', 'first', 'many', 'surprises', 'film', 'offer', 'not', 'major', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'gather', 'what', 'going', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'passed', 'just', 'case', 'hate', 'surprises', 'exposed', 'then', 'stop', 'rest', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'last', 'frame', 'screen', 'not', 'film', 'comfortably', 'one', 'single', 'genre', 'most', 'part', ""'d"", 'consider', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Suffice', 'say', 'amount', 'gore', 'carnage', 'involved', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'considered', 'horror', 'film', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'film', 'completely', 'original', 'offering', 'nod', 'two', 'films', 'came', 'it.Five', 'college', 'age', 'students', 'are', 'set', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Curt', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'relatives', 'have', 'bought', 'place', 'girlfriend', 'Jules', 'Anna', 'Hutchinson', 'are', 'going', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'Dana', 'Kristin', 'Connelly', 'Curt', 'new', 'team', 'mate', 'Holden', 'Jesse', 'Williams', 'stoner', 'friend', 'Marty', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Packed', 'up', 'RV', 'head', 'wilderness', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'soon', 'encounter.Already', ""'re"", 'tossed', 'familiar', 'territory', 'only', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'stop', 'gas', 'be', 'confronted', 'seemingly', 'crazed', 'attendant', 'who', 'directions', 'destination', 'telling', 'bad', 'place', 'go', 'might', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'here', 'trust', ""don't.While"", 'out', ""'re"", 'also', 'seeing', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'high', 'security', 'high', 'tech', 'location', 'plenty', 'lab', 'coat', 'suit', 'clad', 'officials', 'discussing', 'project', 'going', 'not', 'long', 'realize', 'project', 'kids', 'heading', 'cabin', 'where', 'group', 'prepping', 'direct', 'towards', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'night', 'lives', 'Why', 'would', 'group', 'do', 'are', 'talking', 'when', 'discuss', 'same', 'thing', 'happening', 'various', 'locations', 'world', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'here.The', 'group', 'cabin', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'early', 'play', 'game', 'truth', 'dare', 'basement', 'doorway', 'open', 'investigate', 'What', 'find', 'basement', 'filled', 'sorts', 'curious', 'items', 'fortune', 'telling', 'machine', 'jewelry', 'box', 'diary', 'Dana', 'read', 'Unfortunately', 'items', 'are', 'methods', 'death', 'teens', 'are', 'unknowingly', 'choosing', 'Back', 'lab', 'boys', 'research', 'are', 'making', 'bets', 'choose', 'Once', 'Dana', 'reads', 'diary', 'redneck', 'zombie', 'killers', 'are', 'let', 'lose', 'deal', 'teens.Still', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'Why', 'technical', 'group', 'putting', 'kids', 'What', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'killing', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'What', 'end', 'result', 'carnage', 'where', 'originality', 'play', 'something', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'something', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'films', 'major', 'secret.Everything', 'par', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'watch', 'acting', 'believable', 'writing', 'superb', 'direction', 'well', 'played', 'Particular', 'kudos', 'go', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'neither', 'known', 'horror', 'film', 'stars', 'who', 'turn', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'chilling', 'performances', 'Nods', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'seen', 'everything', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'HELLRAISER', 'more', 'Part', 'fun', 'third', 'act', 'recognizing', 'horror', 'film', 'paid', 'tribute', 'here.The', 'concept', 'revealed', 'heart', 'most', 'original', 'thing', 'going', 'here', 'ordinary', 'horror', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'movie', 'get', 'kids', 'woods', 'kill', 'movie', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'depth', 'what', 'going', 'more', 'important', 'even', 'viewers', 'realize', 'end', 'like', 'movies', 'surprise', 'keep', 'guessing', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'surprise', 'end', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'trust', 'might', 'give', 'few', 'chills']",N/A

The Delta Green mailing list was buzzing about The Cabin in the Woods without managing to spoil the details, so I knew I had to see it.  Now I'm sharing that gift with you: GO SEE IT.  Go see it right now.Still on the fence?  Let me do my best to convince you. The Cabin in the Woods is the next evolution of Scream, elevating the winking genre horror conventions to a new level by tacitly acknowledging that everyone knows what will happen.  The film kicks off immediately with a pair of working schlubs, Richard Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) going to work in a secure underground facility.  SPOILER IN THE WOOD: They are, we discover, just cogs in the wheel of a greater horror. The humor is that they could easily be employees in any white-collar workplace, joking about their day, grumbling about the ""man downstairs,"" and alternating between confident professionalism and bored malaise.  In its own way, their soul-grinding day-to-day jobs are just as horrifying as the action above ground.Stumbling into this is our quintet of horror victims: Curt the Jock (Chris Hemsworth), Jules the Slut (Anna Hutchinson), Holden the Nerd (Jesse Williams), Marty the Stoner (Fran Kranz), and Dana the ""virginal"" Final Girl (Kristen Connolly). They are off to vacation in the wooden cabin of Curt's cousin - Evil Dead fans will immediately realize they've come home.The film flips back and forth between these two worlds, and in a lot of ways it is a contrast between generations.  Where Scream was so consciously self-aware of its tropes that every character was aware of their stupidity, these victims are blithely manipulated - perhaps willingly - into dangerous circumstances.  The unseen older folks invent the technology, monitor their every move, and push levers that influence destinies.  The younger folks joke around, get high, and get naked.  In other words, reality television.If Cabin in the Woods stopped there, it would be a hiply ironic but relatively niche film in the vein of Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon and Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.  Instead, it takes the genre tropes as gospel (literally) and constructs an entire framework of worker bees dedicated to the sole purpose of rationalizing horror movies, all for the enjoyment of their ""audience."" It's only when that fourth wall begins to break down, when the survivors start bumping up against the illusion of horror, that Cabin in the Woods turn into a meta-commentary on the nature of our own carefully constructed worlds.In the end, the film asks: How far are you willing to go to defend the world you live in? Cabin in the Woods pulls no punches in answering that question differently for each generation.

1552558,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B008G33O0G,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 6]","This is one of those horror movies that because it gets a theatrical release, and it stars stupid known modern day players, automatically it drew attention from fans of Greys Anatomy and Buffy, not to mention a bunch of girls who would flock to anything with Thor in it. It's a recipe to suck in audience members who don't usually go to see horror films. I can't see horror buffs finding much in this movie at all. So, here is a real review not based at all on whom was in it and giving it undeserving 5 stars, or even 4, no this review will tell it how it is.First off, the plot of the thing is confusing for the most part. It is never really made quite clear what the heck is happening until the very end, and even when explained it ends horribly, writing wise.So, a group of kids go to spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods. Only they discover something in the basement that triggers off a family of zombies to come and get them. This is happening while a group of people are televising it and betting on who will be the monster unleashed to hunt them down. This idea reminded me of what John Cleese and his rich friends where doing in Rat Race. Only the betting seemed to stop after that, and no one was betting on who would be killed next etc... which would have been more interesting than these boring characters trying to run a show... but never explaining exactly who the viewers are? Ritual smitual... explain yourselves.Next up is the teens chosen. One is the ho, one is a virgin, one is a jock, the other a honer student, and of coarse, the dumb dope smoker. None of these characters had any depth or charisma. You don't care if they die or not, so there is no survivor or hero to root for, you just KNOW who it will be. The two women play oppisote characters, yet, both boring. The guys, same thing, and the stoner is the worst of them all. He talks like my grandmother, and just comes out with one liners to try to add humor to the film. Unfortunately the half a millisecond I laughed, I had to stop and cringe when he just kept talking and putting me off this guy being a credible actor. Did they pay him to do this role? I hope not.Once the SHOW has begun, dumb ideas happen, and things not explained or left unanswered occured... like the director has said, ""Who cares, audiences will swallow and old BS these days, who cares if it makes sense"". There are useless characters introduced with no pay off as to why they where even shown in the first place. Perhaps this movie thought it was tackling typical horror movie situations and trying to make fun of it, but if it doesn't pay off, then you have failed miserably.The kill scenes are for the most part stupid and ridicules. The end result made me wonder if one of the actors was getting out of hand about something on set, so they quickly rushed his death scene to get rid of him as fast as possible that day. He is no favorite actor of mine, but he was the biggest name of the movie, and they kill him off that way? Lame.Two things I hated about the ending. One, the very end of the film. If you end a movie with the end of the world in supposed present day, no one walks away. sure, we know it's fiction, but we walk outside and the Earth is still intact the same way it was before we went in. Why think an audience would be satisfied with an ending like that? It may be fiction, but make something plausible for god sakes.The second complaint about the ending. I wont mention what actor it is and spoil it, but she must have a contract with Hollywood stating she will only do a movie if she shows up in the 3rd or final act of a film. I was shaking my head in disbelief that she would do this, AGAIN. At least in the other movie she was in when she did it, it was homage to a previous film she did, and she had some funny lines to make fun of that older movie... but this one here... there was no point, and I would have cut that scene out as it was pretty much useless. They could have gotten anyone to say those lines, and it still would have been as unsatisfying. No one brings a new character into play in the 3rd or final act, however, it did work in that other movie, but here, what god awful stupid, STUPID idea that was.By the end you have been explained to that every horror situation is chosen, and the virgin escapes or dies by fate. It would have been a better ending to have had the stoner be the virgin. But no, it was just a terrible way to end a movie. It tried to be clever by saying every horror movie/situation that has happened, this is why, but it failed to develop anything else around it, making it hard to just sit back with some popcorn and suspend belief. This movie instead insults your intelligence and expects you to just go with it. Sorry, couldn't do it. Too much made no sense, there was no explanations to so many things, and it tried too hard to poke fun at horror movies, while not realizing it fell into the exact same position of bad horror movies.Josh Weeldon or whatever his name is should just stick to trying to revamp his Buffy series, and the other one should take the name of his series he made and put a GET at the front of it. The rest of the actors should hang there heads in shame for making a movie like this and thinking it would be great.Overall; rent it before you even think about buying it. See it first, heck, even wait for it to be on TV. But say I didn't warn you if you go buy 100's of 5 star reviews written by those who do not go to see horror movies, and are just rating it on their infatuations with certain actors. Think of it this was, what if Justin Beiber played Rocky? As bad as it sounds, his fans would flock, and it was gross millions. But is it a good movie?

1552561,A2EENVGNDH8N9G,B008G33O0G,Mike,"[0, 0]","Warning: Major Plot spoilers******Last night we watched 'The Cabin in the Woods'.  From the title and brief description I read,  I was expecting the usual type horror story. The kind with partying college or high school kids isolated from the rest of civilization doing stupid things and a monster killing them off one by one. Just like in so many other films before.  Instead this one had an interesting twist to it.The party bound college kids in this film were actually being set up by some sort of secret organization that periodically sacrificed young people to various type of horrors zombies, ghosts, werewolves, giant bats and so in.  The human sacrifices were needed in order to keep some giant Lovecraftian type creatures from taking over the world.  It's similar to the way virgins had once been sacrificed in ancient cultures to appease their gods like being thrown into a volcano or stabbed on an altar.  Now the young were being sacrificed in a different way and certain types were needed like a studious one, a virgin, an athlete, a buffoon, a promiscuous girl and so on.  Also they were being watched by TV cameras without their knowledge.  They were even drugged in order to affect their actions and ways were set up to prevent their escape.  A few of the assigned victims decided not to give in so easily to the zombies killers sent to destroy them.  Instead they turn the tables on the organization that is using them as sacrifices.  The organization itself was an interesting setup. They almost seemed like any other group of white collar corporate co-workers,  even taking bets on what type of horror the victims would inadvertently pick to destroy themselves.  The way others might bet on the outcome of a weekly pro football game.  When it looked like all was going as planned they seemed to be having a typical office type party to celebrate another success.  They cared little for the lives of the people they had set up.  They viewed it as something necessary for the survival of humanity and were used to it. This added side plot to the movie made all the difference to me, making it refreshingly different instead of the usual formula.As many of you know, I don't care for gore fests or that kind of film.  I did like this movie and the sort that take you off guard, it was not overly gory and was different for a change.  It also had an appropriate final scene.I give it a 3 out of 5 rating.",3,A refreshingly different take on a tired old horror formula,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2420,"['Warning', 'Major', 'Plot', 'spoilers******Last', 'night', 'watched', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'title', 'brief', 'description', 'read', 'was', 'expecting', 'usual', 'type', 'horror', 'story', 'kind', 'partying', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'isolated', 'rest', 'civilization', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'monster', 'killing', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'Just', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Instead', 'one', 'had', 'interesting', 'twist', 'it.The', 'party', 'college', 'kids', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'sort', 'secret', 'organization', 'periodically', 'sacrificed', 'young', 'people', 'various', 'type', 'horrors', 'zombies', 'ghosts', 'werewolves', 'giant', 'bats', 'so', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'were', 'needed', 'order', 'keep', 'giant', 'Lovecraftian', 'type', 'creatures', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'similar', 'way', 'virgins', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'appease', 'gods', 'being', 'thrown', 'volcano', 'stabbed', 'altar', 'Now', 'young', 'were', 'being', 'sacrificed', 'different', 'way', 'certain', 'types', 'were', 'needed', 'studious', 'one', 'virgin', 'athlete', 'buffoon', 'promiscuous', 'girl', 'so', 'Also', 'were', 'being', 'watched', 'TV', 'cameras', 'knowledge', 'were', 'even', 'drugged', 'order', 'affect', 'actions', 'ways', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'prevent', 'escape', 'few', 'assigned', 'victims', 'decided', 'not', 'give', 'so', 'easily', 'zombies', 'killers', 'sent', 'destroy', 'Instead', 'turn', 'tables', 'organization', 'using', 'sacrifices', 'organization', 'was', 'interesting', 'setup', 'almost', 'seemed', 'other', 'group', 'white', 'collar', 'corporate', 'co-workers', 'even', 'taking', 'bets', 'what', 'type', 'horror', 'victims', 'would', 'inadvertently', 'pick', 'destroy', 'way', 'others', 'might', 'bet', 'outcome', 'weekly', 'pro', 'football', 'game', 'When', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'planned', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'typical', 'office', 'type', 'party', 'celebrate', 'success', 'cared', 'little', 'lives', 'people', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'viewed', 'something', 'necessary', 'survival', 'humanity', 'were', 'used', 'added', 'side', 'plot', 'movie', 'made', 'difference', 'making', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'instead', 'usual', 'formula.As', 'many', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'gore', 'fests', 'kind', 'film', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'sort', 'take', 'off', 'guard', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'gory', 'was', 'different', 'change', 'also', 'had', 'appropriate', 'final', 'scene.I', 'give', '3', '5', 'rating']",N/A

This review is for the disc I purchased.This transfer is a great test of your tv's Blac levels. Since the movie predominantly takes place at night, the backgrounds often times get lost in the dark, at least on my tv. Or particularly, when some ""baddies"" are outsde at night, its extremely difficult to see the features on their faces. The colors are ok but do not pop like Transformers or District 9. But it is absolutely a pleasure to watch this film on Blu-ray anyway.I found the sound to be pretty well done, with lots of good bass when needed and it becomes quite stellar toward the end.Final word. Not as crisp as fans would hope for. When studios have cult hits like this one on their hands, they really need to do the transfer justice for the fans. Wait to pay $20 or less if you are looking to buy. Delayed gratification :)I did want to make a comment about the film itself. If you are a serious, die-hard horror fan, you probably won't like this movie. You don't realize it, but you enjoy predictability. And you also don't usually enjoy using your brain during such movies. This has been my experience with several people. They all happened to be girls in their very early 20s who went in thinking that it was going to be just like every other horror movie, and when it wasn't they all said they thought it was stupid. I asked one girl why she thought it was ""retarded"" and she said it was because she feels like all the movies she loved before, have been ruined. I find this so interesting. People's old perceptions are shattered so they respond with anger and resentment. Child-like response.

First off, this isn't typicaly horror so much as a parody on horror films. There are several tongue-in-cheek remarks and there are several efforts to turn the horror genre on its head.Does it work? Sometimes it does and other times not so much. The ending felt a bit abrupt to me but with what they attempted I can only fault them partially. It's a fun movie that makes you feel the creators are sitting next to you in the theater and whispering their brilliance in your ear. Overall, it plays on the usual stereotypes and then proceeds to give you something entirely different which is mainly going to be satisfying to people who have seen a lot of different horror pictures.Is it scary? Not so much for horror film fans. I would say it's more along the lines of intense so I'm thinking slasher flick which turns into something else which might be termed as horror humor piece reminiscent of ""Shaun of the Dead"". Expect gore and some of the other elements.Starring a number of people: Anna Hutchinson, Bradley Wedford, Chris Hemsworth and Richard Jenkins. And you should recognize a voice in the latter part of the film but see below in the spoiler section if you can't wait. Note that this is the first time I have noticed Fran Kranz who is now on my radar.People who enjoyed ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" are likely to enjoy this picture as well.The budget for this piece was $30M and it made a bit over $65M at the Box Office.

I've heard some say that Sigourney Weaver is the voice of movies comparing the Ancient Ones to the movie audiences (keep them zoned out so that they keep going to movies). I am not sure if I entirely agree but one could draw that symbolism if they're so inclined and it's nice that there is a subtext happening or maybe happening.The idea that a high tech company is keeping evil things at by with gory sacrifices based on archetypes was an interesting idea. I think they spent too much time on the humor and ""look at how clever we are"" to make this more than a ""B"" grade picture. If they had developed some of the ideas more and played with the nuances it would have been higher.The ending in itself made sense.

It's packed full of humor and knowingly crafted homages to pretty much every horror movie ever made. It's much, much, much longer on humor than it is on scares, but there are definitely some fun bump in the night moments.  However, see this because you love horror and are interested in laughing at and with the genre.  Do not see this if you are expecting Saw 19 or Paranormal 12.  Do not go for the gore or the pure thrills. Go for the fun.  There is an exuberance for movies built into the this flick that you don't get often. It was crafted with love; love of horror tropes and love of the audiences that enjoy them.And don't worry about spoilers. The biggest problem this movie had was the marketing's obsessive concern about spoilers.  There is really nothing to spoil when it comes to plot, as the biggest reveal comes in the first two minutes.  Everything else that you may want to be blind about going in simply relates to the characters and the jokes.  If they would have let more of the cat out of the bag in the marketing, I suspect this film would have been a much bigger hit.  As it was, the commercials made it seem like a twisty new version of whatever gorefest you may have loved in the past, and I think that killed it.  People went in expecting Saw 92, and instead they got something much funnier and more reflective on the genre as a whole.Anyway, just see this damn movie.  Buy this damn movie.

1552575,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B008G33O0G,Moviedude,"[0, 0]","It's hard to talk about this movie without spoilers in any meaningful way, so spoilers ahead. You've been warned.In Cabin in the woods, a group of young people are duped into heading to a beachfront condo. Psyche, they go to a cabin in the woods. A creepy old man warns them not to and everything. The whole situation is pretty formulaic horror. Yet we see that the woodland is in fact a controlled and observed environment, one that is lorded over by a huge bunker full of technicians who proceed to drug, trap, and trick their victims into a series of contrived-yet awfully familiar-horror movie situations. The guests, we eventually learn, are sacrifices to elder gods who demand that archetypical figures (specifically those seen in horror movies) be executed for their placation. As the main characters are stalked by zombies, the technicians are similarly imperiled- other offices around the world have been attempting similar sacrifices and all have failed (we see a variety of scenes of devastation being fled by helicopter and a room of Japanese schoolgirls entrapping a wrathful ghost). At the final hour the two surviving victims of the American horror movie scenario descend beneath the cabin to the bunker where they release a hoard of monsters (all shoutouts to horror film creature standbys) into the bunker, killing everyone. As the dark gods rise from the underworld the survivors opine that ""giant evil gods"" would have been a fun way to spend a weekend.A lot of reviewers seem to have taken Cabin in the Woods at face value as a horror film. These viewers are idiots. Cabin is simply and clearly a movie about Hollywood- the victims of a horror film as interchangeable cartoons who here are chemically coerced into behaving, like all horror characters, as no real human being would. The technicians who orchestrate the slaughter are filmmakers, painfully self-aware of what they do (at one point the technicians bet on which eldritch abomination the victims will be killed by) yet slavishly dedicated to it. Yet at the climax the ""filmmakers"" are destroyed by their own creations- just as, perhaps, Hollywood horror is undone by its over-dependance on predictable threats. The idea of horror as a literal human sacrifice is also a pretty good dig at the rash of watch-people-die-horribly torture porn that has so become the norm in horror films of late.The film is also a masterful shoutout to horror classics of the past. Almost every monster we see is a clear reference to a film or video game (even the storage device that holds them is a clear reference to The Cube) and the other nation's failed sacrifices are all pretty clear call-outs to horror classics (including what appears to be a happy ending to The Thing). And in a few places it's actually scary, although that is neither its main focus or its goal.PROS:-Funny, well shot, and smarter than a film student's thesis-Good effects considering it's low profile-Awesome, monster-rich payoffCONS:-Not actually a very effective horror movie-Very little characterization (although this is by design)-Will be largely meaningless to someone unfamiliar with horror moviesTHINGS TO WATCH FOR:-This film contains a couple visual references to Firefly, and to Left 4 Dead (the result of a failed deal between MGM and Valve)-The director of the technicians may be familiar to horror fans",5,A scathing and hilarious indictment of the horror genre,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,3356,"['hard', 'talk', 'movie', 'spoilers', 'meaningful', 'way', 'spoilers', 'ahead', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned.In', 'Cabin', 'woods', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'duped', 'heading', 'beachfront', 'condo', 'Psyche', 'go', 'cabin', 'woods', 'creepy', 'old', 'man', 'not', 'everything', 'whole', 'situation', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'horror', 'see', 'woodland', 'fact', 'controlled', 'observed', 'environment', 'one', 'lorded', 'huge', 'bunker', 'full', 'technicians', 'who', 'proceed', 'drug', 'trap', 'trick', 'victims', 'series', 'contrived-yet', 'awfully', 'familiar-horror', 'movie', 'situations', 'guests', 'eventually', 'learn', 'are', 'sacrifices', 'elder', 'gods', 'who', 'demand', 'archetypical', 'figures', 'specifically', 'seen', 'horror', 'movies', 'be', 'executed', 'placation', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'stalked', 'zombies', 'technicians', 'are', 'similarly', 'imperiled-', 'other', 'offices', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'attempting', 'similar', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'failed', 'see', 'variety', 'scenes', 'devastation', 'being', 'fled', 'helicopter', 'room', 'Japanese', 'schoolgirls', 'entrapping', 'wrathful', 'ghost', 'final', 'hour', 'two', 'surviving', 'victims', 'American', 'horror', 'movie', 'scenario', 'descend', 'cabin', 'bunker', 'where', 'release', 'hoard', 'monsters', 'shoutouts', 'horror', 'film', 'creature', 'standbys', 'bunker', 'killing', 'everyone', 'dark', 'gods', 'rise', 'underworld', 'survivors', 'opine', 'giant', 'evil', 'gods', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'weekend.A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'face', 'value', 'horror', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'idiots', 'Cabin', 'simply', 'clearly', 'movie', 'Hollywood-', 'victims', 'horror', 'film', 'interchangeable', 'cartoons', 'who', 'here', 'are', 'chemically', 'coerced', 'behaving', 'horror', 'characters', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'technicians', 'who', 'orchestrate', 'slaughter', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'painfully', 'self-aware', 'what', 'do', 'one', 'point', 'technicians', 'bet', 'eldritch', 'abomination', 'victims', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'yet', 'slavishly', 'dedicated', 'climax', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'destroyed', 'own', 'creations-', 'just', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'undone', 'over-dependance', 'predictable', 'threats', 'idea', 'horror', 'literal', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'dig', 'rash', 'watch-people-die-horribly', 'torture', 'porn', 'so', 'become', 'norm', 'horror', 'films', 'late.The', 'film', 'also', 'masterful', 'shoutout', 'horror', 'classics', 'past', 'monster', 'see', 'clear', 'reference', 'film', 'video', 'game', 'even', 'storage', 'device', 'clear', 'reference', 'Cube', 'other', 'nation', 'failed', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'pretty', 'clear', 'call-outs', 'horror', 'classics', 'including', 'what', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Thing', 'few', 'places', 'actually', 'scary', 'main', 'focus', 'goal.PROS', '-Funny', 'well', 'shot', 'smarter', 'film', 'student', 'thesis-Good', 'effects', 'considering', 'low', 'profile-Awesome', 'monster-rich', 'payoffCONS', '-Not', 'actually', 'very', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie-Very', 'little', 'characterization', 'design', '-Will', 'be', 'largely', 'meaningless', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'horror', 'moviesTHINGS', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'FOR', '-This', 'film', 'couple', 'visual', 'references', 'Firefly', 'Left', '4', 'Dead', 'result', 'failed', 'deal', 'MGM', 'Valve', '-The', 'director', 'technicians', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'horror', 'fans']",N/A

It is campy and quirky - what I like to call ""fun horror"" (ala ""Scream,"" ""Drag Me to Hell"" or ""Trick 'r Treat"").  And it definitely has its fair share of grit and gore to compliment its tongue in cheek attitude.The story involves a group of partying college kids and a separate, seemingly unrelated team of scientists who are embarking on an experiment. All we know for certain is that the college kids are the unsuspecting experimental guinea pigs. The movie unfolds slowly, and like its main characters, the audience never really knows what's going on.Spoilers do no favors for a film like this, so the plot synopsis ends there. Don't read too many reviews prior to seeing this movie: The less you know about it, the more enjoyable the experience will be.The audience is provided little bits of information throughout the course of the film.  Whenever the plot reveals a new twist, it also introduces new questions. The audience, just like the characters in the movie, are guided through a macabre yet fascinating story that continues to expand into something bigger. The final 25 minutes of the the movie will answer most questions, leave a few unresolved, and spill plenty of blood in the process.Watching ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" I was reminded of certain horror films I grew up watching that were completely mind-boggling and unique... films that today are considered cult classics, such as: ""Phantasm,"" ""Re-Animator,"" and particularly the ""Evil Dead"" movies. They all had a campy charm to them, and the audience had absolutely no idea what was going on or what was going to happen next. This is what makes CITW such a delight to watch- it takes the most typical horror cliches, complete with the stereotypical group of college kids(the jock, slut, stoner, bookworm and virgin) and manages to create the most original horror movie I've seen in years.While it's never a ""terrifying"" movie by any stretch, it achieves a respectable level of creepiness throughout. It's a snarky ride that defies traditional horror convention - and for that reason probably won't find its target with mainstream audiences (they will be the ""haters""). However, if you're a fanboy (or fangirl) of those campy cult classics that take you on a ride into the unknown (ala ""Phantasm"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Re-Animator"" and a dash of ""13 Ghosts"" thrown in for good measure), you will probably want to add this to your collection.",4,Most Original Horror Movie I've Seen In Years,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2550,"['Cabin', 'Woods', 'terrific', 'horror', 'film', 'breaks', 'free', 'mainstream', 'trend', 'paranormal', 'home', 'videos', 'pathetic', 'PG-13', 'remakes', 'campy', 'quirky', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'fun', 'horror', 'Scream', 'Drag', 'Me', 'Hell', 'Trick', 'r', 'Treat', 'definitely', 'fair', 'share', 'grit', 'gore', 'compliment', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'attitude.The', 'story', 'group', 'partying', 'college', 'kids', 'separate', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'team', 'scientists', 'who', 'are', 'embarking', 'experiment', 'know', 'certain', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'unsuspecting', 'experimental', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'movie', 'slowly', 'main', 'characters', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'going', 'on.Spoilers', 'do', 'favors', 'film', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'too', 'many', 'reviews', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'less', 'know', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'will', 'be.The', 'audience', 'provided', 'little', 'bits', 'information', 'course', 'film', 'Whenever', 'plot', 'new', 'twist', 'also', 'new', 'questions', 'audience', 'just', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'guided', 'macabre', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'story', 'expand', 'something', 'bigger', 'final', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'will', 'answer', 'most', 'questions', 'leave', 'few', 'unresolved', 'spill', 'plenty', 'blood', 'process.Watching', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'was', 'reminded', 'certain', 'horror', 'films', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'were', 'completely', 'mind-boggling', 'unique', 'films', 'today', 'are', 'considered', 'cult', 'classics', 'such', 'Phantasm', 'Re-Animator', 'particularly', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', 'had', 'campy', 'charm', 'audience', 'had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'what', 'CITW', 'delight', 'watch-', 'most', 'typical', 'horror', 'cliches', 'complete', 'stereotypical', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'jock', 'slut', 'stoner', 'bookworm', 'virgin', 'create', 'most', 'original', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.While', 'never', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'stretch', 'respectable', 'level', 'creepiness', 'snarky', 'ride', 'traditional', 'horror', 'convention', 'reason', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'target', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'haters', 'However', ""'re"", 'fanboy', 'fangirl', 'campy', 'cult', 'classics', 'take', 'ride', 'unknown', 'Phantasm', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Re-Animator', 'dash', '13', 'Ghosts', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

You can see nods to various horror films from across the years, including Hellraiser (which surprised me, as Hellraiser seems, in my own experience, to be so often overlooked and a bit obscure to many people, but definitely a part of any real horror film buff's collection).Now if you go into it expecting it to be a serious horror film, you might be disappointed (unless you're like my family--we went into Evil Dead II thinking it was a serious horror film, and after our initial confusion wore off and we realized it was more of a comedy/parody, we dove right in!)  I think that might be where it's been running into problems, but the ""creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" printed on the cover of the DVD itself should have been a dead giveaway to most people who would be inclined to even consider it.

But I will say, when I saw this in the theater (paying the long buck for it), I was swayed by the reviewers who said it was a twisty and twisted homage to all the horror cliches we've all grown up with.  And Joss Whedon knows how to make good material--so I was expecting another ""Buffy-ized"" snark fest.Wow, was I disappointed. . . but for a couple big reasons: A.)I didn't care a whit about the characters &lt;caveat to come>; B.) It was, for me, gratuitously bloody and ugly with an attitude that said, ""Gore is wooooo scary"" (SCTV Count Floyd voice inserted here).To explain (A.): I KNOW we're not supposed to care about these characters.  They are cartoons, and they are supposed to be; that's why this is an homage.  Of course they're stereotypes: that's what's being parodied, for gosh sakes! I hated the Stoner--but come on, how many times do we need to laugh at a psychotropically configured moron (Jeff Spicoli, is this your kid?)before the stereotypes become stereotypes of themselves? I love homages, but not when they bring nothing new to the table with their characters.I suppose some folks who don't mind the constant barrage of doltish characters spouting the F-bomb (Note to filmmakers: If you want to appear ""edgy"" and on the cusp of ""hip,"" watch *The Big Lebowski* which uses profanity to further characterization and mood)--and you don't mind last-minute ""Time to up the violence quotient since we're running long and we don't want to alienate short-attention-span audiences with dialogue"" sequences--you may enjoy this film.But, Joss, where were your characteristic wit and joy that made us love *Buffy* and *Angel* and *Serenity*?

PLOT SPOILERI found the difference in move between the puppet masters in the high tech facility and the kids in the horror set-up to be unnecessarily contrasting. The tech guys seemed inexplicably insensitive and inappropriately high spirited and did not seem sinister enough for what they were putting the kids through. I found it only watchable.This did not make much sense to me until a comment in the special features. One guy said that he had grown up in Los Alamos and the high tech folks were basically like the people that he had grown up with. They were just ordinary goof-off at the office types but they were highly motivated to develop weapons that had the potential to kill hundreds of millions and end civilization. So yes the tech types engineering the suffering of the kids were like that -- hurray the bombs work, the missiles work, etc.They were totally into the cause. The cause of course was continuing into modern times the tradition of sacrifice to the evil gods to keep them placated and to keep them from running amok and destroying humanity. Very neat idea in my opinion. Once I realized the sociological concept behind the way the film was done and the festive spirits of the guys in the high tech control center, it all made sense and worked well. In retrospect this was the essence of the film. Doing wicked things can be just a job that can be done enthusiastically if one believes that their cause is justified. Probably a lot of nazis felt this way. They were trained to.The film does not press this and so I had to figure it out.I would not call this a horror film and I can see why a lot of horror fans were disappointed at the ""dilution"" of genre themes. Even ""horror film with a twist"" is misleading. I am not sure how one should label it.By the way, the special features were sort of personal and light and not to my tastes.

They didn't do so, and neither will this, but I do believe it is and always will be the best example as to how horror movies are so repetitive!(This Review Does Contains Spoilers)Plot: Five friends head out to a cabin in the woods to basically get drunk, laid, and stoned just to have a fun time to get away from the world, But Some of the More Sinister Parts of the World has Followed Them There, An underground facility located under the cabin has access to what goes on above. Sure the teens get to make their own decisions but if it doesn't appease the bosses needs then they enhance as much as they can.... Now the five teens are being picked off one by one until the remaining survivors realize that they are being punished, for being young, being themselves, being at..... The Cabin in the Woods!Review: I saw this opening night, when I saw this movie I was surprised at how many laughs and jumps there were, I haven't seen that many since Rob Zombies Version of the First Halloween (Which got an applaud by everyone, but sadly this one didn't) This movie deserves all kind of praise, there are two ways you can look at this film and still enjoy and love the hell out of it. One way is to look at it for what it is a horror comedy/parody.... It is a damn good one at that, you except it to have only zombies, but it gets better than that. Or you could look at it as if it were just another horror movie and not to think to hard about it, even if everything seems recycled it still is done in the best way.... If you've already seen the movie then it would be okay just to look at it as a straight up, unoriginal horror movie only if you know that it is a amazing horror comedy/parody! All in all, you can't go wrong with this flick, hell, it turns from a zombie movie into an all out creature/slasher fest all with the simple press of a button!Acting: Even though I knew something bad (such as death) was going to happen I wanted it not to happen and to let it happen. The characters (even the some-what villains) are extremely enjoyable and not to mention likable! When one died you were either cheering are awing (I was cheering and awing at the scene with merman) It was done perfectly. There is not just one main character, all five could be considered that including some others, and even after they're gone you still miss their dialogue, the acting was Mint!Gore: Last fifteen minutes or so are gore filled featuring dismemberment, disembowelment, decapitation, impalement, peeps get shredded, eaten, crushed, stabbed and so much more, before the last fifteen minutes we get an off-screen decapitation, a knife in the throat, back, and hand with some blood! It was defiantly worth the last fifteen minutes!Bottom Line: Is The Best Horror Comedy of 2012, Yes! It has so much entertainment and it's pacing is great, I was already and hour in and it felt like only half an hour, I think it had gone as far as it could've with it's one hour and thirty five minutes mark without being to epic, when the ending hit, if it continued it would've turned into a clash of the titans/300 mix of action and horror rather than what it was, so it stopped when it truly should've! It is perfectly done and for that it is going to be put up on a well deserved pedestal!Rated R for strong bloody horror violence and gore, language, drug use, and some sexuality/nudityIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5",5,"The Movie that ""Scary Movie"" should've Been, A Real Genre Stopper",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,3747,"['Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'ultimately', 'supposed', 'finish', 'Horror', 'Genre', 'pointing', 'out', 'clich', 'eacute', 'bad', 'decisions', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'done', 'today', 'alas', 'even', 'movies', 'were', 'superb', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'neither', 'will', 'do', 'believe', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'example', 'how', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'repetitive', 'Review', 'Does', 'Contains', 'Spoilers', 'Plot', 'Five', 'friends', 'head', 'out', 'cabin', 'woods', 'basically', 'get', 'drunk', 'laid', 'stoned', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'get', 'away', 'world', 'More', 'Sinister', 'Parts', 'World', 'Followed', 'Them', 'underground', 'facility', 'located', 'cabin', 'access', 'what', 'Sure', 'teens', 'get', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', ""n't"", 'appease', 'bosses', 'needs', 'then', 'enhance', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Now', 'five', 'teens', 'are', 'being', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'realize', 'are', 'being', 'punished', 'being', 'young', 'being', 'being', '..', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Review', 'saw', 'opening', 'night', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'laughs', 'jumps', 'were', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Rob', 'Zombies', 'Version', 'First', 'Halloween', 'Which', 'got', 'applaud', 'everyone', 'sadly', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'kind', 'praise', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'can', 'look', 'film', 'still', 'enjoy', 'love', 'hell', 'One', 'way', 'look', 'what', 'horror', 'comedy/parody', 'damn', 'good', 'one', 'except', 'have', 'only', 'zombies', 'better', 'could', 'look', 'were', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'think', 'hard', 'even', 'everything', 'recycled', 'still', 'done', 'best', 'way', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'just', 'look', 'straight', 'up', 'unoriginal', 'horror', 'movie', 'only', 'know', 'amazing', 'horror', 'comedy/parody', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'flick', 'hell', 'zombie', 'movie', 'out', 'creature/slasher', 'fest', 'simple', 'press', 'button', 'Acting', 'Even', 'knew', 'something', 'bad', 'such', 'death', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'wanted', 'not', 'happen', 'let', 'happen', 'characters', 'even', 'some-what', 'villains', 'are', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'mention', 'likable', 'When', 'one', 'died', 'were', 'either', 'cheering', 'are', 'awing', 'was', 'cheering', 'awing', 'scene', 'merman', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'five', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'including', 'others', 'even', ""'re"", 'gone', 'still', 'miss', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'was', 'Mint', 'Gore', 'Last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'gore', 'filled', 'featuring', 'dismemberment', 'disembowelment', 'decapitation', 'impalement', 'peeps', 'get', 'shredded', 'eaten', 'crushed', 'stabbed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'get', 'off-screen', 'decapitation', 'knife', 'throat', 'back', 'hand', 'blood', 'was', 'defiantly', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Best', 'Horror', 'Comedy', '2012', 'Yes', 'so', 'much', 'entertainment', 'pacing', 'great', 'was', 'already', 'hour', 'felt', 'only', 'hour', 'think', 'had', 'gone', 'as', 'far', 'could', ""'ve"", 'one', 'hour', 'thirty', 'five', 'minutes', 'mark', 'being', 'epic', 'when', 'ending', 'hit', 'continued', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'clash', 'titans/300', 'mix', 'action', 'horror', 'rather', 'what', 'was', 'stopped', 'when', 'truly', 'should', ""'ve"", 'perfectly', 'done', 'going', 'be', 'put', 'up', 'well', 'deserved', 'pedestal', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'bloody', 'horror', 'violence', 'gore', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'sexuality/nudityIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '10For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '5']",N/A

While the beginning was a little confusing due to the switches between the group of protagonists and the corporate people, it turned out to be quite an interesting movie where survival seemed to be almost impossible, but achieveable thanks to chance circumstances.The film surprisingly did a good job shifting and developing both groups of focus during the movie (minus the first few minutes) and I felt the comedy aspect of the film managed to fit with the horror resonably well. The deaths, were slightly stupid but, as the movie reveals, cliche deaths/moments are actually needed in this movies plot. I don't want to give anything more away so you can get as much as possible from this movie.I do have three problems however, one is that a security guy for the corporate people appears to be lead up to have a major impact on the story (I feel it isn't much of a SPOILER to tell you he doesn't). Also the last couple of minutes of the movie had the main characters speak a little to softly for me. I had replay every couple sentances to figure what they said as I already had the volume up a good ways. Finally I wish more of the people's thoughts could've been revealed during the movie, however since there is a novalization of this movie, that issue may not be a big deal.I do recommend this movie if you want to see a different kind of horror movie that is less about a supernatural being and is more about the people.",4,Interesting,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1506,"['People', 'were', 'right', 'when', 'told', 'not', 'movie', 'expect', 'be', 'beginning', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'due', 'switches', 'group', 'protagonists', 'corporate', 'people', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'movie', 'where', 'survival', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'achieveable', 'thanks', 'chance', 'circumstances.The', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'shifting', 'developing', 'groups', 'focus', 'movie', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'felt', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'film', 'managed', 'fit', 'horror', 'resonably', 'well', 'deaths', 'were', 'slightly', 'stupid', 'movie', 'reveals', 'cliche', 'deaths/moments', 'are', 'actually', 'needed', 'movies', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'more', 'away', 'can', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'movie.I', 'do', 'have', 'three', 'problems', 'however', 'one', 'security', 'guy', 'corporate', 'people', 'be', 'lead', 'up', 'have', 'major', 'impact', 'story', 'feel', ""n't"", 'much', 'SPOILER', 'tell', ""n't"", 'Also', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie', 'had', 'main', 'characters', 'speak', 'little', 'softly', 'had', 'replay', 'couple', 'sentances', 'figure', 'what', 'said', 'already', 'had', 'volume', 'up', 'good', 'ways', 'Finally', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'thoughts', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'revealed', 'movie', 'however', 'novalization', 'movie', 'issue', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'deal.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'different', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'less', 'supernatural', 'being', 'more', 'people']",N/A

1552676,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B008G33O0G,Robert Badgley,"[0, 4]","Did I actually watch Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods(released Mar/12),or was it something that just had the same name? I glance at other reviews here and elsewhere,along with the build up hype and have to wonder what the glowing words used like ""brilliant"",""fun"",""twisted"",""wonderful"",and on and on,are doing associated with a run of the mill horror flick with a run of the mill twist like this one?This is a straight up horror movie,played seriously by its acting characters and with a theme,superficially at least,reminiscent of Evil Dead.The story(spoiler alert)involves a group of five teenagers who plan a trip to a remote cabin in the woods.Along the way they make a brief stop at a run down old gas station whose attendant is less than hospitable.Once at the cabin they discover one room with a two way mirror and then make a walkabout in the basement,whose trapped door had conveniently flown open enticing them down there in the first place.They discover an old diary and one girl(there are two)starts to read a passage,at the end of which,is a bit in latin.One guy,a stoner,says not to read it but of course she does and that starts the proverbial ball rolling.Keeping in the Evil Dead theme(Bruce Campbell would be proud),the dead family from the diary comes out of the ground in the woods and heads towards the house(wouldn't a Wal-Mart have been better?...just asking).One couple has already left the cabin to make out in the woods and one of them becomes the first fatality.The undead invade the cabin and the stoner becomes trapped,while the remaining three flee in the RV they came in.They reach an impasse when a tunnel caves in,then one of them tries to jump a gap in the ravine,on a motorcycle(conveniently attached to the RV for just such an emergency)to go for help.However,just before he lands on the other side he plows into an unseen force field,killing him instantly.We saw this same force field as the five drove in originally and a bird hit it and disintegrated.The remaining two head back in the RV and the male driver gets his along the way.The RV crashes and sinks into a nearby lake and she escapes only to be stalked again on a dock.Just as she's about to become shish kabob#4,the stoner suddenly shows up and helps to dispatch her tormentor.They flee into the woods to a man made hole and door in the ground that the stoner had discovered before he met up with her(doesn't every petrified stoner have the where with all to search for man made openings in the ground,in pitch darkness,while fleeing a family of Freddie Kruegers?).Now before I go further there is an entire backdrop and parallel story happening.This entire scenario,getting the kids up to the cabin and everything scary wise,is being manipulated by people in a control room,dressed in white garb,far away.These folks have sophisticated monitoring equipment and they deliberately place and set up each scenario so the people,in this case the kids,get to chose their own fate.For instance,instead of the diary the girl found and read from,one guy was about to blow on a conch shell,and another was playing with a round gadget,both of which would have taken the scenario in a different direction.The people in the control room even take bets amongst each other as to what scenario the participants will choose.In fact this is a globally run concern,as there are monitors with on going scenarios in Brazil,Japan and Sweden.When someone gets killed a switch is pulled and blood comes streaming down and into a likeness of that individual.What's behind it?Let's go back to the kids.The kids are in the man made hole under which the stoner has found an opening to an elevator.The girl and the stoner decide their only hope is down,and away they go.In their descent they see a menagerie of monsters,each in their own cubicle(the elevator is made of clear plexiglass sides).In fact their elevator is just a small part of a bigger gigantic holding area.They finally reach bottom and get out,when suddenly a voice comes over the loudspeaker explaining that their entire plight has been part of a bigger plan,for those that the voice and the control room folks serve.Armed para-militants are dispatched to retrieve the couple who hide in a bullet proof booth,filled with switches.The girl flips all the switches which unleashes the entire menagerie of monsters.The monsters quickly dispatch the gunmen,and eventually when one of the monsters comes crashing into their booth,they have to flee.While the monsters are running all through the complex and killing those that originally controlled them,the two kids end up in a round room where they are confronted by the originator of the disembodied voice they heard just off the elevators.It is in the form of actress Sigourney Weaver,who is the controller of the complex and who explains that they have set things up all to appease giant ancient evil ones who live far below.If they do not do so to their satisfaction,they will rise again to take over the earth.The two struggle with Sigourney and when a werewolf attacks the girl it becomes Sigourney and the stoner.Just as it looks as if Sigourney is going to win,one of the people that attacked them at the cabin drops in and dispatches her.The stoner kicks both over the open edge of the room.The stoner then shoots the werewolf and he slinks away.The film ends as both sit there,the sun comes up and a giant hand reaches out of the ground from below the earth.I guess it is shift change time for the Earth.It is certainly a different approach to the horror/Sci-Fi genre of films,I will give Mr Wheadon that.When the kids leave their apartment building to go to the cabin we spot a man on the roof with an ear plug saying to someone,somewhere,that they had left,so from there we start guessing as to what it is,or who it is that he represents.Then we see the bird killed in the force field and know something weird is up.As the Evil Dead-like scenario plays out with the kids,we go back and forth between them and the control area,which reveals more and more of its raison d'etre.Of course the end puts all the pieces of the puzzle together.But I don't find anything astonishingly brilliant or even new here,and I certainly do NOT find anything funny in this film.It's entire dynamic is a back handed homage to a myriad of horror flicks and monsters,but other than that there is nothing the least surprising here.In fact one might even say the film itself is a kind of Frankenstein monster;common parts from here,common parts from there and all stitched together to create one entity.From all the hype I was expecting greater things but saw far,far less.I like some of Whedon's work(Firefly),and dislike others(Buffy the Vampire Slayer),but I must admit I was rooting for him in this one but,sorry Mr Whedon you hit the ball but only made it to second base.It was a good try though.Oh yes,for all of the five minutes Sigourney is on screen,she gets FIRST mention and separate credit,as the end credits roll.Now that's star power.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary and five featurettes.All in all a fair to middling horror flick,with kids in a cabin and all doing their Evil Dead impersonations.The special""twist"" is it is all controlled,and who the controllers are working for...whoopee.No surprises,nothing new...nothing to see here.2 1/2-3 stars.",3,Did I watch the same

1552677,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B008G33O0G,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Cabin in the Woods (Drew Goddard, 2011)In 1990, when I first saw Joel Schumacher's Flatliners--to this day the last Joel Schumacher film I actually enjoyed--I came up with a rule of thumb that has served me well in the intervening two decades and change to explain how the normally-loathsome Julia Roberts didn't make he hate her character in that movie: every awful actor gets one good role. I have since found ample evidence that this is the case, from Kevin Costner being not ridiculous in A Perfect World to Jesse Eisenberg wowing me in Zombieland to Albert Brooks not making me want to punch him in the face in Taxi Driver. It never occurred to me that this also might be the case for folks behind the camera, but let me be the first to give credit where credit is due: for the first time, I have encountered a project touched by the vile, vile hand of Joss Whedon  that officially does not suck big green donkey [censored for Amazon consumption]. I KNOW, RIGHT? No one was more surprised than I was. Now, I grant you, some of the Joss Whedon characteristics are still very much in evidence--the movie doesn't resist the temptation to go too far to get the joke nearly as much as it should, some of its minor characters should have come pre-packaged with red shirts, while others exist solely as plot-point advancements, the story adds needless complexity far too often--but in general, this is actually... fun.Plot: if you've seen any half-dozen random horror films, the beginning of this is going to sound familiar. Well, actually, the movie isn't going to let you get anywhere ""familiar"" to kick itself off; it's going to let you in on at least part of the fun from the opening scene. You know from the get-go that the titular cabin and its soon-to-be young-and-beautiful inhabitants are not the usual slasher-flick fare. But yet here we are, with the (monitored) cabin and the young-and-beautifuls in question. There's Dana (Revolutionary Road's Kristen Connolly), who's coming off a nasty breakup, and her best friend Jules (Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior's Anna Hutchison in her first big-screen appearance), who is determined to snap Dana out of her funk. There's Jules' boyfriend Curt (Thor's Chris Hemsworth), the stereotypical jock boyfriend, and his best friend Holden (Brooklyn's Finest's Jesse Williams), with whom Jules and Curt are trying to fix Dana up as part of that save-your-best-pal-from-depression plan. And then there's Shaggy--excuse me, Marty  (Donnie Darko's Fran Kranz), the resident stoner and the guy about whom you ask yourself in every horror movie you have ever seen, ""what the hell is this person doing with this group of people? He totally doesn't fit!"" This is a bog-standard horror setup......but, like Wes Craven did with Scream in 1996 (but done here about a dozen times better), Whedon and co-writer Drew Goddard (J. J. Abrams' right-hand man, the writer on both Lost and Cloverfield), who also takes to the director's chair for the first time, are intimately familiar with the horror tropes, and are going to lampoon them to full effect here. We already know this situation is Not Right(TM), and it is Not Right in the kind of way that put me in mind of the slick, underrated little thriller My Little Eye from a decade before--but Cabin in the Woods goes in an entirely different, often funny, direction. There is a segment about three-quarters of the way through the film where its quest to keep ramping up the funny threatens to derail it, and it comes very, very close for a while there, especially in the climax--but then comes the denouement, with a great, great cameo (that I had managed to avoid hearing about, so I won't spoil it for you, either) and a scene that manages to tie everything back together and come up with an ending that manages to be completely satisfying, and I gotta say I'm giving this movie as many points for that save as I am for anything else. (And then you top it off by putting Nine Inch Nails' best song ever as your end title theme? Yes.) I didn't expect to like this movie nearly as much as I did. It's a blast. It's actually convinced me that I may actually have to watch something else Whedon does in the future. (But not the Shakespeare adaptation. I'm not open-minded enough for that yet...) *** ",4,This isn't meant to last.

1552698,A1R6E48W5J42Z,B008G33O0G,"Sargentrock ""I love stuff!  and this place ha...","[5, 8]","First a slight word of warning, I am a Joss Whedon fanboy all the way-- and this movie only strengthens that.The next paragraph will be spoiler-free, every part after that read at your own risk!From the very start this movie is not what you think it is.  If not for the trailers already spoiling a tiny bit I would have been completely surprised by the somewhat strange and mundane opening (immediately after the opening credits but before the title screen).  Who these people are and what they're doing is the ultimate plot of the film, and unless someone has told you something about this movie already it's a pretty safe bet that you'll never guess what's really going on.  Even better than that, though, is the dissection of the horror genre that follows.  The same things that always happen in horror movies happen in this movie as well--there's a jock, a stoner, a brain a slut and a good girl just like every other horror movie ever.  But are they really those people?  From the start you get the idea that maybe they're not, and the reasons they end up acting the way they do are the heart of the movies' plot.  It's original, genuinely disturbing at a few parts, funny, and engrossing.  If you haven't seen it I would recommend seeing it as soon as you can, before someone ruins it--the less you know about this movie going into it the better.  ""Let's get this party started"" indeed...If you haven't seen it you should probably stop reading here...SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!....I loved what this movie became--I think I would have genuinely been let-down if the ending hadn't happened the way it did.  Don't get me wrong, parts of this movie were ultimately silly (why do they have a ""system purge"" button?  Because of course they do!), but I loved the deeper subtext hinted at in this movie:  the security guard being our conscience (should we really be watching and, on some level, enjoying this?), Sigourney Weaver acting as the Executive Producer and the controllers acting as Director and Producer while everyone else is the ""crew"" all to bring the Elder Gods (us) the entertainment they crave to keep them from ""rising up"" (i.e. stop going to movies). There are so many funny, little moments in this as well--the Harbinger on the phone (and, in a throwaway moment, basically tells us ""the fool"" is going to derail the entire thing); the awesomeness of the white board (I so want to know who...or what...Kevin is and what he would have done); the great moment with Marty and the bong, and really most of Marty's moments are pretty great.The blu ray presentation is pretty good (although there are a lot of trailers on this disc) and the supplementals are better than the average supplementals.  The making-of not being just a ""rah rah everyone's great"" but a real, honest-to-goodness documentary about how they made the movie that is interesting to watch.  I haven't watched it with the commentary on yet but will pretty soon, as I've heard that's pretty great as well.  The sound is epic--particularly during the system purge with bullets flying and monsters screaming and people screaming and blood splattering--you really feel like you're in the middle of it (but in a good way).Highly recommended all the way around.",4,Turns the genre on it's ear!,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,3227,"['First', 'slight', 'word', 'warning', 'am', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fanboy', 'way', 'movie', 'only', 'that.The', 'next', 'paragraph', 'will', 'be', 'spoiler-free', 'part', 'read', 'own', 'risk', 'very', 'start', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'not', 'trailers', 'already', 'spoiling', 'tiny', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'surprised', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'mundane', 'opening', 'immediately', 'opening', 'credits', 'title', 'screen', 'Who', 'people', 'are', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'ultimate', 'plot', 'film', 'someone', 'told', 'something', 'movie', 'already', 'pretty', 'safe', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'never', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Even', 'better', 'though', 'dissection', 'horror', 'genre', 'same', 'things', 'always', 'happen', 'horror', 'movies', 'happen', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'jock', 'stoner', 'brain', 'slut', 'good', 'girl', 'just', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'are', 'really', 'people', 'start', 'get', 'idea', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'not', 'reasons', 'end', 'up', 'acting', 'way', 'do', 'are', 'heart', 'movies', 'plot', 'original', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'few', 'parts', 'funny', 'engrossing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'someone', 'less', 'know', 'movie', 'going', 'better', 'Let', 'get', 'party', 'started', 'indeed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'should', 'probably', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'loved', 'what', 'movie', 'became', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'genuinely', 'been', 'let-down', 'ending', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'way', 'did', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'ultimately', 'silly', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'system', 'purge', 'button', 'course', 'do', 'loved', 'deeper', 'subtext', 'hinted', 'movie', 'security', 'guard', 'being', 'conscience', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'watching', 'level', 'enjoying', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'acting', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'controllers', 'acting', 'Director', 'Producer', 'everyone', 'else', 'crew', 'bring', 'Elder', 'Gods', 'entertainment', 'crave', 'keep', 'rising', 'up', 'i.e', 'stop', 'going', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'little', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'Harbinger', 'phone', 'throwaway', 'moment', 'basically', 'fool', 'going', 'derail', 'entire', 'thing', 'awesomeness', 'white', 'board', 'so', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'Kevin', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'moment', 'Marty', 'bong', 'really', 'most', 'Marty', 'moments', 'are', 'pretty', 'great.The', 'blu', 'ray', 'presentation', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'lot', 'trailers', 'disc', 'supplementals', 'are', 'better', 'average', 'supplementals', 'making-of', 'not', 'being', 'just', 'rah', 'rah', 'everyone', 'great', 'real', 'honest-to-goodness', 'documentary', 'how', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'commentary', 'yet', 'will', 'pretty', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'pretty', 'great', 'well', 'sound', 'epic', 'particularly', 'system', 'purge', 'bullets', 'flying', 'monsters', 'screaming', 'people', 'screaming', 'blood', 'splattering', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'middle', 'good', 'way', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'way']",N/A

It never attempts to originally play itself off as your typical teen slasher flick liked The Evil Dead or Friday the 13th. Cabin in the Woods is highly original, highly creative, and highly entertaining. The very first scenes focus on what appear to be workers in a typical office or corporation of some sort, and it is filled with the typical office type humor you might expect from a film like Office Space or Dilbert, but it quickly becomes clear that something far more sinister and mysterious is at work, and the five young college kids who are planning to go to a &#34;cabin in the woods&#34; for an afternoon of fun and excitement, as is the typical horror movie setup, end up getting far more bloody and brutal than even the audience, both in the film and in the &#34;office&#34;, expect.As the film progresses the five stereotypical characters, portrayed by Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, and Jesse Williams, slowly realize that something is very wrong in their little cabin in the woods, but it isn't until the end that they realize the danger is far greater than they could have ever imagined. In addition to being a dark satire on slasher flicks and &#34;torture porn&#34;, the film, if you really think about it, is actually far more disturbing than it is funny. It takes a good, hard, nihilistic look at our messed up world and offers hints or explanations on how it got that way, going far back to the ancient times when our ancestors sacrificed their fellow men and women to vengeful, murderous gods. The very gods whose dark presence continues to spread misery and suffering in our world to this very day through various religions and cults.It's a very thought-provoking and intelligent movie that has fun playing with your expectations about who will live and who will die, and as such has a very strong air of unpredictability, something which is very refreshing to see. I can't tell you how many times I could tell who was going to live and who was going to die long before it happened in movies like Wrong Turn and Sleepaway Camp. This was a real treat indeed, it succeeded at being funny, it succeeded at being scary, it just succeeded overall. At first I was bummed about having the stereotypical characters you always see in these types of films, but towards the end when I realized that they were that way for a reason, that automatically turned my opinion of this film from great, to fantastic. A well deserved 5 stars. The ending was awesome too, totally didn't expect that.",5,Thank You Drew Goddard and Josh Whedon,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2638,"['Cabin', 'Woods', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'comedy/horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'originally', 'play', 'off', 'typical', 'teen', 'slasher', 'flick', 'liked', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Friday', '13th', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'highly', 'original', 'highly', 'creative', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'focus', 'appear', 'be', 'workers', 'typical', 'office', 'corporation', 'sort', 'filled', 'typical', 'office', 'type', 'humor', 'might', 'expect', 'film', 'Office', 'Space', 'Dilbert', 'quickly', 'clear', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'mysterious', 'work', 'five', 'young', 'college', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'go', '34', 'cabin', 'woods', '34', 'afternoon', 'fun', 'excitement', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'setup', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'far', 'more', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'even', 'audience', 'film', '34', 'office', '34', 'film', 'five', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Kristen', 'Connolly', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Anna', 'Hutchison', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Jesse', 'Williams', 'slowly', 'realize', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'little', 'cabin', 'woods', ""n't"", 'end', 'realize', 'danger', 'far', 'greater', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'addition', 'being', 'dark', 'satire', 'slasher', 'flicks', '34', 'torture', 'porn', '34', 'film', 'really', 'think', 'actually', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'funny', 'good', 'hard', 'nihilistic', 'look', 'messed', 'up', 'world', 'hints', 'explanations', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'going', 'far', 'back', 'ancient', 'times', 'when', 'ancestors', 'sacrificed', 'fellow', 'men', 'women', 'vengeful', 'murderous', 'gods', 'very', 'gods', 'dark', 'presence', 'spread', 'misery', 'suffering', 'world', 'very', 'day', 'various', 'religions', 'cults.It', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'fun', 'playing', 'expectations', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'such', 'very', 'strong', 'air', 'unpredictability', 'something', 'very', 'refreshing', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'live', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'long', 'happened', 'movies', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'indeed', 'succeeded', 'being', 'funny', 'succeeded', 'being', 'scary', 'just', 'succeeded', 'overall', 'first', 'was', 'bummed', 'having', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'always', 'see', 'types', 'films', 'end', 'when', 'realized', 'were', 'way', 'reason', 'automatically', 'turned', 'opinion', 'film', 'great', 'fantastic', 'well', 'deserved', '5', 'stars', 'ending', 'was', 'awesome', 'too', 'totally', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect']",N/A

And indeed, just like Evil Dead 2, the kids provide a satirical at times take on what happens when you inadvertently release some mean boogymen into their retreat.Man, this would have been a cool video game! In fact, according to a 9/23/2012 Joystick article, there was almost a Cabin in the Woods download pack forLeft 4 Dead 2. Unfortunately, when MGM went bankrupt it not only delayed the movie from a 2011 release to a 2012 release, it also quashed the video game downloadable content. Although, according to the article, that did not prevent Cabin Director Drew Goddard from giving viewers a glimpse of some L4D monsters in the movie. But the L4D monsters are only a couple in a plethora of nasties that include an array of horrors from the more classic zombies, werewolves and other more familiar nightmarish figures to some unique, very video game-esque supernatural beings/entities.So what's with all these monsters? Where do they come from? Why are they here? Well that's the interesting, unpredictable twist part of the movie that revealing in a review would be a major spoiler. It's all eventually explained in the movie to an extent, but where the monsters came from is still a tad bit unclear at the movie's conclusion.I was thoroughly entertained by Cabin in the Woods. Horror fans should not pass on this. It's not so much scary as it is fun and cool to watch.",4,That's a Spooky Looking Place...Let's Go In!,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1718,"['Full', 'stereotypical', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'set-ups', 'situations', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'taken', 'predictable', 'made', 'unpredictable', 'Five', 'young', 'friends', 'head', 'out', 'weekend', 'fun', 'know', 'are', 'trouble', 'when', 'pull', 'up', 'little', 'vacation', 'spot', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'cabin', 'fromEvil', 'Dead', '2', 'indeed', 'just', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'kids', 'provide', 'satirical', 'times', 'take', 'what', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'release', 'mean', 'boogymen', 'retreat.Man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'video', 'game', 'fact', 'according', '9/23/2012', 'Joystick', 'article', 'was', 'almost', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'download', 'pack', 'forLeft', '4', 'Dead', '2', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'MGM', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'not', 'only', 'movie', '2011', 'release', '2012', 'release', 'also', 'quashed', 'video', 'game', 'downloadable', 'content', 'according', 'article', 'did', 'not', 'prevent', 'Cabin', 'Director', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'giving', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'L4D', 'monsters', 'movie', 'L4D', 'monsters', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'plethora', 'nasties', 'include', 'array', 'horrors', 'more', 'classic', 'zombies', 'werewolves', 'other', 'more', 'familiar', 'nightmarish', 'figures', 'unique', 'very', 'video', 'game-esque', 'supernatural', 'beings/entities.So', 'what', 'monsters', 'Where', 'do', 'come', 'Why', 'are', 'here', 'Well', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', 'twist', 'part', 'movie', 'revealing', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'spoiler', 'eventually', 'explained', 'movie', 'extent', 'where', 'monsters', 'came', 'still', 'tad', 'bit', 'unclear', 'movie', 'conclusion.I', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Horror', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'pass', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'scary', 'fun', 'cool', 'watch']",N/A

As you may have heard, it has funny moments that satirize the horror movie genre, but never at the expense of the actual horror.  Make no mistake - this movie is not a straight parody, nor is it a farce.  Rather, it credits the viewer with a certain awareness of the conventions of the horror genre, acknowledges them, then delivers some real horror that seems fresh and real.  That's a tricky tightrope to walk, but the producers, directors and cast of this movie pull it off in spades.  This is a movie that rewards repeated viewings.

I've watched it once and haven't had a desire to see it again, so that should say a lot right there.

I do so only because I think Joss Whedon is a genuine talent and, a few years back, was something of a wunderkind. He made some great television, and I looked forward to watching him develop his talents. But his two recent efforts, this film and Avengers, have been unworthy vehicles. He seems to have realized this himself, because they're crafted in a half-hearted way that seems almost apologetic - or maybe I just think an apology is warranted and I'm seeing things that aren't there. Either way, where is the Joss Whedon who had so much promise? A few witty quips (and there are VERY few in this movie) do not a good film make.I understand that this was intended as a send up of horror movie tropes, but that has been done frequently in recent years, and this movie has nothing fresh to add.

The two have also worked together previously on the television shows ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"".I liked this film because I am a fan of actors Richard Jenkins and Bradly Whitford, and it was fun for me seeing them act together. They both steal the show in my view. Jenkins plays the part of a man named Gary Sitterson and Whitford plays the part of a man named Steve Hadley. The two are co-workers and both appear to be typical business men. Each man is very comical, but serious when they need to be, and given what they do for a living, a sense of humor is an important thing for the men to have.""The Cabin in the Woods"" is about five college students who go to a remote cabin for a weekend get-away. Their names are Dana Polk, Holden McCrea, Marty Mikalski, Jules Louden, and Curt Vaughan. Upon arriving at their destination, the five young adults soon discover that this party is not going to be what they expected.....However - The film is also not what we the audience expect it to be either.....It turns out that the students are being video taped by agents for the government. The technicians, Sitterson and Hadley, watch the group of youths from various monitors in their control panel and are able to create the environment the group are in and give them mind-altering drugs to control them into following a procedure. The drugs gradually reduce the group's judgment and perception, and also increase their sexual stimulation. In time, Sitterson and Hadley figuratively fatten the young people up for the kill and essentially coerce them to ""pick their poison"". i.e. Pick which type of monster(s) is going to hunt them and kill them.I rather not type more about the plot because I feel the less you know about this film, the better.Another reason why I enjoy this film is because I am intrigued by conspiracy theories. i.e. Area 51, the Illuminati, the New World Order, etc. In all honesty, I don't think there are any government cover-up's, however I keep an open-mind and it is an entertaining and interesting idea and this film essentially explores that topic.In my opinion, the characters of Sitterson and Hadley are clearly apart of or associated with the U.S. government and what they are doing is one of the government's underground projects. Sitterson and Hadley are not the only ones apart of this group - There is an entire staff of adults of all ages, races and genders who work from within this building that assist Sitterson and Hadley - From maintenance workers, to security guards, and more. Just regular people who you could pass on the street and not give two thoughts about. The interesting part is - All these folks seem like harmless and decent people. It's very interesting watching these people interact like regular people given where they are and what they do. In fact, watching all the employees of this place is almost slightly like watching a light-hearted comedy about a bunch of employees in their offices just working and joking together like every other Average Joe and Average Jane out there.However, I suspect if places like Area 51 for example have Aliens inside them, and/or Area 51 is a place for the government to meet up to discuss things like creating a new world order, or time travel testing is conducted out there, etc, I see no reason why the human employees of Area 51 on their break-time wouldn't not only have discussions about whatever is going on in their personal lives, but would also have a sense of humor because they are still human as anyone, and what they are apart of would be pure horror for some people, and for me personally, if I worked there, it would take getting use to, so being able to joke around, flirt with female co-workers, and just talk about what my weekend plans are with co-workers would be desperately needed to keep me sane.What makes a horror film entertaining to me is if the villain or villains are well-acted by the performer(s) and can convince the audiences that their character's really believe the evil things they are doing is righteous. I also like it if the villain or villains even appear likable despite their violent ways. It makes the film more realistic. In real life, no one thinks they are doing evil and feel their actions are totally justifiable and that is what we are treated to in ""The Cabin in the Woods"".I enjoy this film because it's scary, thought-provoking, funny, entertaining, and like a hybrid of several horror films in one. The two biggest being a slasher film and torture porn.The reason why I watched this film is because I am entertained by some horror movies. I feel watching them is similar to riding a roller coaster. i.e. There's something appealing about being scared, but knowing you are not in any danger.I also enjoy underdog stories because I can relate to them, and most horror films are underdog stories. i.e. You have a character facing a challenge where the odds are highly stacked against them, and it's fun cheering them on, hoping they can overcome.Finally, I am a fan of horror films because I am intrigued by human nature and feel horror films sometimes explore the dark side of human nature, thus horror films can serve as good educational tools which in turn can improve lives because it can teach you lessons on how to behave in life for example and help you make better choices.One of tag lines for this film is ""You think you know the story"". Going into this film, I thought I had a good idea of what the film was about, but the tag-line was proven to be correct, and I was in for a surprise. I figured the film would be another typical horror film that takes place in the woods, and it was, but there is a twist to it. Before I saw this movie, I knew nothing about it. I never even saw the trailer. I discovered the film thanks to various advertisements for it on the Internet which lead me to watching it. Me knowing nothing about the film increased the entertainment for me.I watched this film on blu-ray on my HDTV with surround sound and the screen was very clear, the sounds were perfect, and made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action, the lighting was perfect, and the movements of the cameras were good as well. The pacing of the film was perfect. The film is not too long, but it's not too short either. The character development of all the main characters was done well and you get to see them all react to all kinds of different and crazy situations. I enjoyed the film's soundtrack as well. The action was wonderful. The ending action sequence reminded me of the ending action sequence in ""Titanic"" because there is total chaos at the end. It's great.Those who enjoy scary movies should check the film out. I think people who are looking for fun, roller-coaster-like entertainment would enjoy this film a lot. I also think people who believe in conspiracy theories, as well as those who are anti-big government would like the film too.The blu-ray includes plenty of special features that go into great detail in the making of this film.I highly recommend ""The Cabin in the Woods"" to horror fans everywhere.",5,The tag-line is right.,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,7757,"['Cabin', 'Woods', '2012', 'horror',

And &#8220;Cabin In The Woods&#8221; showed such promise and delivered way over the expectation register.Nevertheless, without giving the movie a way the writers and directors gave a very unique perspective on the presentation of this movie. Yes, the movie started with the 5 or 6 teens going to a cabin in the woods and they ran into the crazy old man with some quirky warning about the dangers which lied ahead. But, the direction the movie took after this was unexpected.I watched it 3 times.

1552768,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B008G33O0G,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[8, 14]","For more than two years now, horror movie fans and loyal followers of Joss Whedon have spoken of the legendary horror film, The Cabin in the Woods. Well, to be honest it was legendary without ever seeing the light of day, and unfortunately for the Whedon geeks out there it didn't look like we'd find out what all the fuss was about. Why were people throwing out phrases like ""game changer"" and calling it the next Scream? For once the clamor was dead on right. The Cabin the Woods is the new standard bearer for the horror movie genre. Period.That's not hyperbole. Joss Whedon and director Drew Goddard have taken every one of the cliches we've come to expect from horror and given them enough unique twist, all the while winking and rubbing our expectations right in our faces. There are so many surprises that are both hilarious flat out bonkers that it's crucial not to spoil anything, and it goes far beyond the simple mystery of whoever the antagonist is like in Wes Craven's Scream films. In fact, we know right from the start who is beyond all of the mayhem. The big mystery is why, and the answer comes at the end of one of the craziest final acts you'll ever see. There's a unicorn involved. That's all that can, and should be, said about it.Even the simplicity of the title serves to lower your defenses. In the beginning we're introduced to the archetypes we've come to look for: there's the slutty blond bombshell, Julie(Anna Hutchinson); the paranoid stoner, Marty(Fran Kranz); the brainiac, Holden(Jesse Williams); the ""virgin"", Dana(Kristin Connolly); and an unknown Chris Hemsworth as Curt, the token jock. The plot is hilariously familiar, with the boozing, horny friends heading off to a cabin in the thick of the woods near a corn pone mountain town. Recipe for disaster? Of course it is, and it isn't long before strange family heirlooms are disturbed, ominous journals are read, and things start going bump in the night.Yet that's just a small piece of the puzzle, as we learn early on that somebody else is pulling the strings, namely a shadowy government organization led by two fairly average joes played by veteran character actors, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. That's not spoiling anything major, so don't fret. This portion of the film is played up mostly for comedic effect, as they run some sort of game orchestrating every terrible thing that befalls the clueless youngsters. The vibe feels like an extended episode of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with laughter used to lighten the genuine life and death stakes.Goddard and Whedon's script keeps you completely off balance, a rarity for any genre but horror movies in particular. It's so smart and cleverly aimed at our own perceived notions of where the story should go, that it's easy to overlook that some of the performances are actually quite good. The banter between Jenkins and Whitford, including a running gag involving the latter's love of a particular classic movie monster, make up the bulk of the movie's biggest laughs.Analyzing horror films has become old hat now, with that little sub-genre falling into self parody. Scream 4 is a prime example of what happens when the satire fails to evolve. Whedon is too smart to let that happen here, so hopefully we won't be seeing any The Cabin the Woods sequels. Don't let anybody spoil your experience, so get your tickets to the film early before the biggest shocks(including one awesome cameo!) get ruined!",4,Puts most other horror movies to shame,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3462,"['more', 'two', 'years', 'now', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'loyal', 'followers', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'have', 'spoken', 'legendary', 'horror', 'film', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'legendary', 'ever', 'seeing', 'light', 'day', 'unfortunately', 'Whedon', 'out', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', ""'d"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'Why', 'were', 'people', 'throwing', 'out', 'phrases', 'game', 'changer', 'calling', 'next', 'Scream', 'once', 'clamor', 'was', 'dead', 'right', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'new', 'standard', 'bearer', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'Period.That', 'not', 'hyperbole', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'director', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'have', 'taken', 'one', 'cliches', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'horror', 'given', 'enough', 'unique', 'twist', 'while', 'winking', 'rubbing', 'expectations', 'right', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'surprises', 'are', 'hilarious', 'flat', 'bonkers', 'crucial', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'far', 'simple', 'mystery', 'whoever', 'antagonist', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Scream', 'films', 'fact', 'know', 'right', 'start', 'who', 'mayhem', 'big', 'mystery', 'why', 'answer', 'end', 'one', 'craziest', 'final', 'acts', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'unicorn', 'involved', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'it.Even', 'simplicity', 'title', 'lower', 'defenses', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'archetypes', ""'ve"", 'come', 'look', 'slutty', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'Julie', 'Anna', 'Hutchinson', 'paranoid', 'stoner', 'Marty', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'brainiac', 'Holden', 'Jesse', 'Williams', 'virgin', 'Dana', 'Kristin', 'Connolly', 'unknown', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Curt', 'token', 'jock', 'plot', 'hilariously', 'familiar', 'boozing', 'horny', 'friends', 'heading', 'off', 'cabin', 'thick', 'woods', 'corn', 'pone', 'mountain', 'town', 'Recipe', 'disaster', 'course', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'strange', 'family', 'heirlooms', 'are', 'disturbed', 'ominous', 'journals', 'are', 'read', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'bump', 'night.Yet', 'just', 'small', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'learn', 'early', 'somebody', 'else', 'pulling', 'strings', 'namely', 'shadowy', 'government', 'organization', 'led', 'two', 'fairly', 'average', 'joes', 'played', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'major', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'portion', 'film', 'played', 'up', 'mostly', 'comedic', 'effect', 'run', 'sort', 'game', 'orchestrating', 'terrible', 'thing', 'clueless', 'youngsters', 'vibe', 'feels', 'extended', 'episode', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'laughter', 'used', 'lighten', 'genuine', 'life', 'death', 'stakes.Goddard', 'Whedon', 'script', 'completely', 'balance', 'rarity', 'genre', 'horror', 'movies', 'particular', 'so', 'smart', 'cleverly', 'aimed', 'own', 'perceived', 'notions', 'where', 'story', 'should', 'go', 'easy', 'overlook', 'performances', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'banter', 'Jenkins', 'Whitford', 'including', 'running', 'gag', 'involving', 'latter', 'love', 'particular', 'classic', 'movie', 'monster', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'movie', 'biggest', 'laughs.Analyzing', 'horror', 'films', 'become', 'old', 'hat', 'now', 'little', 'sub-genre', 'falling', 'self', 'parody', 'Scream', '4', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'satire', 'evolve', 'Whedon', 'too', 'smart', 'let', 'happen', 'here', 'so', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'sequels', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'spoil', 'experience', 'so', 'get', 'tickets', 'film', 'early', 'biggest', 'shocks', 'including', 'one', 'awesome', 'cameo', 'get', 'ruined']",N/A

What if your job depended on that very stupidity? Better yet, what if the world as we knew it depended on that stupidity?Five college students, Dana (played by Kristen Connolly), Curt (played by Thor himself Chris Hemsworth), Jules (played by Anna Hutchison), Marty (played by Fran Kranz) and Holden (played by Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams) are all packed and ready for some much needed rest and relaxation in a remote cabin in the woods (I know, the title was no help in predicting that). Separately, two men in a corporate facility whose nature is not fully explained are gearing up for a series of operations taking place worldwide and one happening domestically that determines the future of their employment. While en route to their secluded cabin, our college students stop for gas and are more than moderately spooked by the station attendant who tells them that tragedies have befallen more than one of the previous owners. Still they press on and the attendant, Mordecai (played by Tim de Zarn) relays that to the two men in the corporate facility (played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) while they laugh at the man's ghoulish demeanor which he maintains long after the collegians depart.There's a good deal more to this story, but to reveal any more would give away too much. What I can tell you is that I enjoyed this movie immensely. The relatively unknown cast members serve their purpose and the more accomplished professionals, namely Whitford, Jenkins, and a largely unseen Sigourney Weaver add an entirely different dimension to a film that might otherwise be cookie-cutter from its inception.

Beneath this familiar horror template there is another story going on, about which you will learn by the end of ""Cabin in the Woods,"" directed by Drew Goddard (his debut as director), who is also the writer of ""Cloverfield."" His debut film is pretty fun, but if you ask me if I want to watch it again, the answer is no.Like the POV-style monster flick, ""Cabin in the Woods"" is based on two or more incongruous ideas put together in a straightforward way. On one level it is a standard horror movie. On another it is a kind of conspiracy theory, which is pretty good, but nothing new. There is more to come, which will certainly make you speechless, either you are impressed with it, or you just find it too silly.After all, the ending could be anything. The problem of ""Cabin in the Woods"" is despite occasional humor and scare, the film is not as smart as it thinks it is. The whole setting is elaborate, but each segment is often predictable. The film shows its hand far too soon, signposting what will happen next (the flying bird scene, for instance).The acting is surprisingly good, with five principal young actors Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz and Jesse Williams, and two veterans Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford.

1552779,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B008G33O0G,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 5]","The ""plot"" of THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is a classic clich&eacute; of horror films: a group of five friends travels to a cabin in the woods out in the middle of nowhere that is supposedly owned by a cousin of one of the friends. There's a jock, a slutty girl, a scholar, a stoner, and an innocent. The trip to the cabin is really spooky complete with a run-down gas station where the group stops for a fill-up and to make sure their directions to the cabin are correct. Once they get to the cabin in the woods, it's even creepier. However, from the opening sequence the audience already knows this isn't a typical horror movie because these five friends are under surveillance and everything about their trip seems predetermined. One can't really say more than that without giving important plot twists away.THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is unlike any horror movie I have seen before. There's a lot of humor in the film that reminds one of the horror films of Sam Raimi (the EVIL DEAD movies, and DRAG ME TO HELL). Also, from the beginning I was reminded of the John Ritter movie, STAY TUNED. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS has elements from these films, yet it is something completely different. It starts out following many of the clich&eacute;s of the horror genre and then manipulates those clich&eacute;s into something different. Then, when you think you've got things figured out, it takes that idea and manipulates it again, changing it into something completely different.The movie has broad appeal. There's tons of gore for those who like to see blood and guts. There's a flash of female nudity for the horny males. There's the secret mind game that seems to be going on for those who enjoy the mystery and suspense that often accompanies a horror story. There's the occasional cheap scare where something jumps up or pops out of nowhere. All of those elements are in THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. However, all of those elements are carefully manipulated to fit into the grand scheme of the movie that's a carefully constructed critique of the horror genre in general.Though THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years, it's not a movie that will appeal to everyone.

Very funny - intentionally.

So, I invested an hour and a half on this film. I didn't know it was a slasher flick -my girlfriend rented it (shame on me for not checking, eh?) What did I get out of it? Some chuckles but not much more. The problem with this movie is, after the stupidity keeps on coming, it gets old and predictable. Even unpredictability becomes predictable and old. Understand? The absurdities from start to finish left this viewer not really caring at all. In fact, I was bored half way through and almost turned it off-wish I had. Don't get me wrong, I love a good parody,. but slashing up teenagers (or old actors- supposed to be young) and the violence for the sake of Joss saying ""look, how blood loving our violent society is"" does not help stop the spread of violence itself.The last 20 minutes of the film could have been written by a 10 year old, and have been equally believable to what Joss came up with. Don't look for any great philosophical point or moral to this flick-or logic/explanations; how did they capture all those monsters? Does society really allow killing teenagers for a hidden god?I wish Joss would have made the villain the people who profit from slasher flicks, like himself or Hollywood.Or maybe made the pot-geek the virgin who kills the girl instead and saves-nothing. But hey, the ending made no sense so it is all a joke. You can watch other similar films that make a mockery of slasher films, too.Oh, one more thing this film does have on it's side: because it is mocking horror flicks, it cannot be criticized for anything poorly done-at all. The defense is ""well, don't slasher flicks have bad acting?"" or ""don't slasher flicks have stupid endings?"" on and on. Don't start criticizing this films every mistake, cause most are probably intentional.But then again...oh, and many reviewers say the ending was unpredictable, I wasn't shocked or surprised. Very formulated through the end. Yes, I guessed the geek wasn't really dead and would return, on and on.So would YOU like it? Well, did you like Scary Movie? and Hunger Games? Like to see blood and people slaughtered? Go for it. But, not much scary stuff because Joss intentionally cuts back to control room for some tired, worn jokes/gimmicks. So, a good film for a short 1 1/2 hour joke. I don't think the film could have been any longer.I think the reviewers who enjoyed this movie are young. And I say that because they love anything that is sarcastic and breaks the norm, even if it is not well done or conceived. Hey, I was young once too! Our DNA dictates we break from the clan.

Read below:Audiences often don't like films that shift genres, play with the conventions of the genre incorporating elements of multiple ""types"" of films or change the rules of the game while the movie is being watched. ""Cabin in The Woods"" does all three and whether or not you'll enjoy it largely will be determined by your enjoyment of films that do that very thing such asEvil Dead 2 (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]orScream [Blu-ray]. In fact, if you enjoyed Whedon's seriesBuffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete SeriesorSupernatural: The Complete Seventh Season [Blu-ray] then you'll probably enjoy this film.SPOILERS:With ""Cabin in the Woods"" Drew Goddard (a former writer on ""Lost"", ""Buffy"" and ""Cloverfield) and Joss Whedon turn the horror conventions of the slasher flick on its head combining elements of H. P. Lovecraft, ""The Truman Show"" and ""Scream"" creating a sort of ""meta"" horror movie. Since the film also has elements of satire I wouldn't go into ""Cabin in the Woods"" expecting a straight horror experience as the film plays with the expectations of the genre as well. Those looking for a slasher film that will scare them scene after scene would do well to steer clear of this ""Cabin"". If you enjoyed ""Buff The Vampire Slayer"", you'll enjoy ""Cabin"". If you didn't, you probably won't enjoy this.A quintet of college kids head up to a deserted cabin that was recently purchased by the cousin of Curt(played by Chris Hemsworth ofThor (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)). He drags along his girlfriend (Anna Hutchinson), teammate (Jessie Williams), Anna's roommate (Kristin Connolly) and their stoner friend Marty (Fran Kurtz)  and As the creepiness builds we discover that they are being watched, manipulated prior to being attacked and picked off by the resurrected corpses of the former inhabitants. Those in the control room (the Richard Jenkins ofThe Visitor [Blu-ray]who inhabits the banality of evil in his role here and Bradley Whitford ofThe West Wing: The Complete Series Collection) who are observing and guiding the fate of these four insuring they'll die horribly to prevent something evil from being released. Imagine ""Evil Dead II"" with a bit more satire and you'll have a sense of the feel of ""Cabin in the Woods"" is like.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray for ""Cabin in the Woods"" is a bit disappointing. While it accurately represents what was seen in theaters, the lack of contrast unfortunately makes the darker sequences in the film a bit too murky. Yes, it represents the films that Whedon and Goddard are satirizing look like but I expected a slightly sharper presentation. The rest of the film looks pretty good but given that some of the key sequences occur at night, I would have liked slightly better resolution.The audio, on the other hand, is a knock out 5.1 lossless presentation. Dialogue is never overwhelmed by the various sound effects or the marvelous score by David JulyanThe Descent (Original Unrated Cut) [Blu-ray],The Prestige [Blu-ray]).The special features are quite solid and include a commentary track by Goddard and Whedon. We get a number of featurettes that are quite good ""We Are Not Who We Are"" about the making of the movie; ""An Army of Nightmares"" focuses on the animatronic/make up effects; ""Primal Terror"" focuses on the visual effects. We also get ""The Secret Secret Stash"" about Marty's pot stash. ""Hi, My Name Is Joss and I'll Be Your Guide"" features Whedon giving a guided tour of the sets for the show. We also get the ""Wondercon Q & A"" after the screening of the film. We also have ""It's Not What You Think"" a ""Bonusview"" special feature allowing you to see interviews and behind-the-scenes footage while watching the movie.Will ""The Cabin in The Woods"" be for everyone? No. I feel it's a clver mixture of satire and horror and enjoyed it quite a bit. Your mileage may vary though depending on your taste.",4,"""Ok, I'm drawing a line in the ******* sand.

The special effects are really well done and the acting is really good, but at no point in the movie we believe the plot (because there is no real plot). And the end while totally predictable is totally out of control.The ""plot"": five friends go to spend a week end in a cabin in the woods next to their college campus; they discover in the basement a journal that has one sentence in Latin; the ""virgin"" reads it and then all hell breaks loose; they do not realize until the end that everything is orchestrated by a corporation that competes globally. They finally make it inside the headquarters and release all the creatures that kill all the employees.The best line comes from Sigourney Weaver that unfortunately we only see for 2 minutes at the end of the movie. While she is introducing the five stereotypes of any horror movies (the athlete, the hooker, the geek, the drug addict, and the virgin) she looks at the ""virgin"", and the ""virgin"" goes: me a virgin?

The comedy was really dry with a few hahas but, mostly huhs. The premise was sexy college kids going out to the woods to party instead, they were mostly nerdy kids with little sexiness & very limited drug use (sex & drugs are the reason they're supposed to die). The scene in the beginning with the alleged virgin in her underwear that did show her southern details a little & the one sex scene in the woods with a little top-free action was the limit of the sexiness in this film (movies like this should be chock full of T&A!! Especially in these progressive times). I really didn't like the fact that they only sent one monster type after the kids. A wild night of survival would've been a lot better than wham bam everybody's dead except this one person. Also, having them killing to keep some gods from destroying the Earth seemed kind of stupid. They should've been doing it to fulfill some sick individuals fantasy instead. It did have a lot of blood but, no real memorable deaths. It had jokes but, very few laughs. It also had nudity but, it lasted less than two minutes. This movie just lacked excitement all together. I'm really surprised Chris Hemsworth agreed to do this film as it really knocked him down a peg in my book.
