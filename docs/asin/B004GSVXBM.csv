1407213,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B004GSVXBM,Amazon Customer,"[7, 11]","As the movie description indicates, this is a ""psychological thriller,"" but it is more.  In short, the film tells the story of an unmarried couple that has car issues, and ends up spending the night in a dodgy, way off the beaten path hotel, only to find the lead male subject to a set of bizarre encounters.  Interestingly, there is a story that runs parallel to the unmarried couple, but it intersects with the unmarried couple in a few very curious ways.  While the film was very good throughout (good acting, good camera work/production values), I kept asking myself I wonder how they will tie all these seemingly different parts together.  And it wasn't until almost the very end that the underlying real concept came through.  Perhaps embarrassingly, I have to say that the real concept caught me a bit off guard.  The official movie reference to ""psychological thriller"" led me to think the film was somewhat tritely working toward a recreation of many other good films (e.g., Identity), but this ended up not being the case at all.  This is not to imply that the twist is unlike anything you've seen, but its good enough to give you a few minutes of pondering the situation and connecting all the threads into a cohesive whole.  Again, irrespective of the underlying concept, the movie was enjoyable to watch - the acting was good, the production values high and the artistic value spot on.  I'm not sure whether this is a frequent watch type of movie, so I highly encourage the reader to consider a rental before buying.  However, it doesn't have to sit in your DVD player every day to merit a four star designation.

But if you like slow-burning psychological thrillers in the vein of Twilight Zone episodes, Beneath the Dark is worth a watch.The movie follows a young couple who make a road trip, and find themselves taking a detour at a quiet motel out in the desert.  As other mysterious characters begin to reveal themselves, the dark truths hidden in one of the pair's past is revealed.I didn't expect much from this movie, considering it went straight to video.  But it was actually shot well, with a surprisingly good score.  Josh Stewart (from The Collector) offers a decent performance as Paul, boyfriend to the character played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler (Meadow Soprano).  I was also happy with the acting job by Chris Browning (Book of Eli, Let Me In), cast as the unusual motel clerk.There are only two downsides to this film.  The first is that you really have to hang in there until the last 20-30 minutes, as the story plods along.  It does help build up the mystery of what's happening to the main characters, but some people may lose interest halfway through.  The other con is that the film borrows a few elements from other movies.  Mentioning their names would spoil Beneath the Dark's twist, so I'll simply leave it at that.One thing that's for sure, the end has one element involving photos that I haven't seen in other movies.  I had to watch the final minutes of the film a second time to really understand it, and that helped make it a great ending.

This roadside rest stop proves to be a strange and surreal place with an unsettling mix of travelers, who force the couple to discover a hidden secret.Yeah, I took that plot summary from wikipedia. Sue me. I didn't feel like writing a different one. Nevertheless, I liked this movie more than any other movie I've seen in years. The pacing has been described as sluggish. I agree. But I was never bored watching this film. Not once. Still, I totally understand how many other people could be bored watching this film. The cinematography was good though.The performances were also good. The actors were deep into their roles. I've never seen any of them before this movie. I guess not having a big name star helps me identify with the movie more. Paul, the main character truly spoke to me: his feelings of loneliness and trying to run away from something in his past. This is something in his past he felt no control over, but at the same time he felt he had complete control over it. That doesn't make sense if you haven't seen the movie. The event in his past that changed his life could have been avoided if he had stood up and said, ""No, I'm not going to let this happen,"" and walked away. But he didn't do that. Although I didn't committ a sin as bad as Paul's, I've made some mistakes I could have easily have avoided. I'm sure everyone has. However, Paul's past comes back to haunt him when he realizes his sins had bad consequences for others. His sins also has a bad consequence with Adrienne, the girl he loves.This movie did speak to me. My life is pretty directionless. I feel like Paul. I feel like I'm driving down an endless highway through that's both serene and bleak at the same time. I feel as if my goal is over the horizon. But when will I get there? Will I know what to do when I get there? If so, will I make the right choices? I don't want to forget the past. But I'm not sure how I can reconcile the past.Looks like I'm rambling now. Still, I truly enjoyed every minute of this movie. I would call this more of a psychological drama than a thriller. There isn't any edge of your seat suspense here. There aren't any heroes or villains here. So I'm not sure if I recommend this movie. All I know is I loved this film.If you walk away with one thing from my review then get this: stop rating movies based on the opinions of others. Many times people will watch a movie that's critically acclaimed, feel the movie was okay at best, but rate it 4 or 5 stars simply because they don't want to go against the opinions of others. La Dolce Vita and Casablanca only got a ""meh"" from me. But I've rated those movies 4 or 5 stars because everyone else rated it good so I felt I should rate it good. No more. I'll rate a movie based on my opinion. If I think Battlefield Earth deserves 5-stars and American Beauty deserves 1-star, that's how I'll rate it. No more of this bandwagon, can't think for myself junk. And I advise people to rate a movie based on how much you like it. That's all. Forget what everyone else thinks of it. I gave this 5-stars because it is one of the few movies I've watched that truly felt relevant to my life. It's a psychological drama paced slowly. If you feel skeptical about buying it then rent it for cheap first. I rented this for 50 cents first. Then I spent 5 bucks to buy it.",5,I loved this movie,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3463,"['Plot', 'Driving', 'wedding', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mojave', 'desert', 'Paul', 'Adrienne', 'pull', 'off', 'highway', 'Roy', 'Motel', 'Cafe', 'roadside', 'rest', 'stop', 'be', 'strange', 'surreal', 'place', 'unsettling', 'mix', 'travelers', 'who', 'force', 'couple', 'discover', 'hidden', 'secret.Yeah', 'took', 'plot', 'summary', 'wikipedia', 'Sue', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'writing', 'different', 'one', 'Nevertheless', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'pacing', 'been', 'described', 'sluggish', 'agree', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'Not', 'once', 'Still', 'totally', 'understand', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'good', 'though.The', 'performances', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'deep', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'guess', 'not', 'having', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'identify', 'movie', 'more', 'Paul', 'main', 'character', 'truly', 'spoke', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'trying', 'run', 'away', 'something', 'past', 'something', 'past', 'felt', 'control', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'had', 'complete', 'control', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'event', 'past', 'changed', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'had', 'stood', 'up', 'said', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'let', 'happen', 'walked', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'committ', 'sin', 'as', 'bad', 'Paul', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mistakes', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'have', 'avoided', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'However', 'Paul', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'when', 'sins', 'had', 'bad', 'consequences', 'others', 'sins', 'also', 'bad', 'consequence', 'Adrienne', 'girl', 'movie', 'did', 'speak', 'life', 'pretty', 'directionless', 'feel', 'Paul', 'feel', ""'m"", 'driving', 'down', 'endless', 'highway', 'serene', 'bleak', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'goal', 'horizon', 'when', 'will', 'get', 'there', 'Will', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'so', 'will', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'past', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'can', 'reconcile', 'past.Looks', ""'m"", 'rambling', 'now', 'Still', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'movie', 'would', 'call', 'more', 'psychological', 'drama', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'villains', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'recommend', 'movie', 'know', 'loved', 'film.If', 'walk', 'away', 'one', 'thing', 'review', 'then', 'get', 'stop', 'rating', 'movies', 'based', 'opinions', 'others', 'Many', 'times', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'best', 'rate', '4', '5', 'stars', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'opinions', 'others', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'Casablanca', 'only', 'got', 'meh', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'movies', '4', '5', 'stars', 'everyone', 'else', 'rated', 'good', 'so', 'felt', 'should', 'rate', 'good', 'more', ""'ll"", 'rate', 'movie', 'based', 'opinion', 'think', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', '5-stars', 'American', 'Beauty', '1-star', 'how', ""'ll"", 'rate', 'more', 'bandwagon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'junk', 'advise', 'people', 'rate', 'movie', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'Forget', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'thinks', 'gave', '5-stars', 'one', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'truly', 'felt', 'relevant', 'life', 'psychological', 'drama', 'paced', 'slowly', 'feel', 'skeptical', 'buying', 'then', 'rent', 'cheap', 'first', 'rented', '50', 'cents', 'first', 'Then', 'spent', '5', 'bucks', 'buy']",N/A
1407218,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B004GSVXBM,John Milton,"[0, 1]","Beneath the Dark is a 2010 movie starring Josh Stewart (The Collector, Jekyll, The Haunting of Molly Hartley) and Jamie Lynn Sigler (Dark Ride, Campfire Stories; and probably best known as the daughter of Mob Boss Tony in The Sopranos) as a couple taking a road trip to Los Angeles to get to a friend's wedding.I started watching it and thought to myself that it was going to play out like Vacancy, Psycho or Identity but much like the synopsis provided on the DVD, this movie was incredibly blunt and revealed the nature of the plot far too early in the storyline, resulting ultimately in destroying what could have been a very satisfying little flick. All of the actors involved played their parts competently and I was particularly impressed with the performance of Afemo Omilami (The Reaping) who was suitably ominous as `The Man'. The location used was suitably desolate and enhanced the bleak atmosphere created by Feehan for the proceedings.In my opinion, the major flaw and the reason for the downfall of what could have been a decent movie was the script.There is an overwhelming feeling of deja vu with this movie; simply because this has all been seen and done before to greater effect. Beneath the Dark plays out like an extended sub-par episode of The Twilight Zone and used plot devices thst have been seen so many times before that they have now become genre cliches.The big ""twist"" comes as no real surprise and is telegraphed from an early stage due to the plot/ script development which admittedly, had a few nice geeky references thrown in. With a little more subtlety, this could have been a decent flick. Although Feehan's script left a lot to be desired, his examination of human guilt and punishment for past sins was quite good but overall, wasn't enough to save the movie for me. Perhaps I am being unfair and just had too high expectations of the film after watching the trailer but I would recommend catching Identity instead for a superior film in a similar vein.",3,A flawed film that ought to have been so much better,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1991,"['Dark', '2010', 'movie', 'starring', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'Collector', 'Jekyll', 'Haunting', 'Molly', 'Hartley', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'Campfire', 'Stories', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'daughter', 'Mob', 'Boss', 'Tony', 'Sopranos', 'couple', 'taking', 'road', 'trip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'get', 'friend', 'wedding.I', 'started', 'watching', 'thought', 'myself', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'Vacancy', 'Psycho', 'Identity', 'much', 'synopsis', 'provided', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'blunt', 'revealed', 'nature', 'plot', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'storyline', 'resulting', 'ultimately', 'destroying', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'satisfying', 'little', 'flick', 'actors', 'involved', 'played', 'parts', 'competently', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'performance', 'Afemo', 'Omilami', 'Reaping', 'who', 'was', 'suitably', 'ominous', 'Man', 'location', 'used', 'was', 'suitably', 'desolate', 'enhanced', 'bleak', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'Feehan', 'proceedings.In', 'opinion', 'major', 'flaw', 'reason', 'downfall', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'movie', 'was', 'script.There', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'deja', 'vu', 'movie', 'simply', 'been', 'seen', 'done', 'greater', 'effect', 'Dark', 'out', 'extended', 'sub-par', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'used', 'plot', 'devices', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'genre', 'cliches.The', 'big', 'twist', 'real', 'surprise', 'telegraphed', 'early', 'stage', 'due', 'plot/', 'script', 'development', 'admittedly', 'had', 'few', 'nice', 'geeky', 'references', 'thrown', 'little', 'more', 'subtlety', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'flick', 'Feehan', 'script', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'examination', 'human', 'guilt', 'punishment', 'past', 'sins', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'unfair', 'just', 'had', 'too', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'watching', 'trailer', 'would', 'recommend', 'catching', 'Identity', 'instead', 'superior', 'film', 'similar', 'vein']",N/A
1407219,A39AZT0WDM8AC9,B004GSVXBM,KEVIN BRIAN,"[1, 2]","Very interesting little film that would probably appeal to people looking for some 'meat' to their horror movies.Matter of fact, it isn't a horror movie at all! It's a character study set around a mysterious motel during one dark night.I watched it on 'Showtime Beyond' last night and went into it thinking that it was going to be another 'road trip from hell' movie where a couple come up against a bunch of psychos and have to fight for their lives. Like in 'Vacancy'.After about the half hour mark, I suddenly realized that this was going to be a whole different beast. The movie reminded me of a strange play (there is lots of talking,very little violence) that one might see in a small community theater that likes to take on bold and daring projects.As the movie 'whispers' along, we are introduced to several characters that hardly ever, cross paths, until the final act, where it all sort of makes sense in a 'Twilight Zone'kinda way.To be honest, I was slighty bored here and there, but every time I thought about going off and making a grilled cheese sandwich, or something like that, the 'strange, hypnotic' power of the film kept me from doing so. I really wanted to know where the heck (!) all this was going, and how the scattered characters would all come together.Especially when their individual stories started to cross in very, very odd ways. For example, there's this bit concerning a frustrated woman, wearing a purple jacket, while cheating on her man at the local dive. Later, this same jacket (!) shows up in a room closet at a motel where a couple, who has no relations to her whatsoever, is sleeping.I'll be honest, I sort of figured out the mystery from the get go, because it's been done to death. (In a matter of speaking. Hint. Hint.) But even knowing the outcome, their were more subplots going on, all tied together in a spider's web, that still kept things interesting.The actors are awesome. You can clearly tell that they really put their heart into this film, and had a clear understanding of what was going on. The couple that arrive at the motel are the key players. The young woman is terrific. The guy is a fine actor but rather strange looking, at least to me. But his odd appearance sort of mixed well with the moody atmosphere. I guess.There were some scenes that also made me slightly cringe. Like, the scene where a mall security guard,removes a pair of girl's panties from a rack, and then goes into one of the dressing rooms to masterbate. Can we say, awkward. Especially when he is caught on the mall's video cam and has to face to boss.Then there's the group rape scene, which is very tense and, well, pretty sad. These moments 'touched' me more than they should of, I guess because the movie is so low-budget, that they felt raw and disturbing.I didn't care much for the black man who kept popping up with warnings and words of wisdom throughout the film. I felt him to be cliche and boring. And, of course, at the end, he explains all to a key character, filling in the gaps for the audience. He is bascially the Tony Todd character in 'The Final Destination' films, warning the people of their fates to come. Only this guy, in my opinion, is as dull as dishwater.At the end, there are big choices to be made, miracles to unfold, pictures of past players framed on a wall, and a guy walking off down a long road leading to somewhere.It all sort of makes sense and, even after the movie was well over, and I was finally making my grilled cheese sandwich, I was still connecting some of the dots in my head.

1407222,A2DECXC7Y496GV,B004GSVXBM,Phillip Tomasso III,"[0, 0]","So, this morning I watched the 2010 Chad Feehan as writer / director film, Beneath the Dark. The synopsis sounded good, but I tried it mostly because Jamie-Lynn Sigler beneath(Sopranos, Guys With Kids) was in it. The film also stars, Josh Stewart, who has been in a number of good films and TV shows as well.Okay. The basic idea is that Paul (Stewart) and Adrienne (Sigler) are headed to a wedding. A guy from Paul&#8217;s college frat is tying the knot. Growing weary on the way, and a little frisky, Paul runs the vehicle of the road. It&#8217;s decided they will not push it and land a hotel room for the night.The Roy Hotel is run by Frank (Chris Browning). He&#8217;s a step-and-a-half above Anthony Perkins on a creepy-meter, and the hotel is slightly more modern than the Bates Motel. Once tucked away in a room, Adrienne is still frisky (and while there is no nudity, it is quite hot), only Paul has too much on his mind and cannot perform. Frustrated he heads to the connected diner for coffee where he meets a Man (Afemo Omilami) who claims to be the Son of God.The Man certainly knows a lot about Paul, and Paul&#8217;s soiled past, and aside from conversation, he tries to have Paul answer some simple questions . . . What Do You Believe In?I can&#8217;t forget Frank&#8217;s wife, Sandy (Angela Featherstone). She is not a happy woman. Sandy stalks the bars looking for company. Isn&#8217;t hard for her to find what she wants. Not bra-less in a thin white tank-top. She shows up here and there. (And is quite sensual in a barfly kind of way). Seems her sole (or soul) purpose is to torment the loser-ness of her husband.There is always homemade cherry pie and fresh coffee. There is a jukebox&#8211;while outdated with its selection&#8211;that is always ready to play.Beneath the Dark is nothing new. Sadly, I knew the end of the story at the very beginning of the movie. There have been a flood of &#8220;identical&#8221; big-screen and direct to DVD films with the same ending over the last four years. I could name them. But if you see one &#8212; then I have ruined the ending for the rest. I hate that. Hate it. Because the story was as solid as the acting. Both I enjoyed. The dialogue was crisp enough. The filming was simple but effective.If I were to assume you saw none of the other films with the same ending &#8212; then this is an excellent movie. If not, then this is a mediocre film. Since the Beneath the Dark is from 2010 &#8212; and we are on the cusp of 2014, I am going to assume the ladder and for that, give the movie 3 out of 5 Stars.Zombie AuthorPhillip Tomasso[...]",3,Netflix Movie Review: Beneath The Dark,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2604,"['So', 'morning', 'watched', '2010', 'Chad', 'Feehan', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'film', 'Dark', 'synopsis', 'sounded', 'good', 'tried', 'mostly', 'Jamie-Lynn', 'Sigler', 'beneath', 'Sopranos', 'Guys', 'Kids', 'was', 'film', 'also', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'who', 'been', 'number', 'good', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'well.Okay', 'basic', 'idea', 'Paul', 'Stewart', 'Adrienne', 'Sigler', 'are', 'headed', 'wedding', 'guy', 'Paul', '8217', 'college', 'frat', 'tying', 'knot', 'Growing', 'weary', 'way', 'little', 'frisky', 'Paul', 'vehicle', 'road', '8217', 'decided', 'will', 'not', 'push', 'land', 'hotel', 'room', 'night.The', 'Roy', 'Hotel', 'run', 'Frank', 'Chris', 'Browning', '8217', 's', 'step-and-a-half', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'creepy-meter', 'hotel', 'slightly', 'more', 'modern', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'Once', 'tucked', 'away', 'room', 'Adrienne', 'still', 'frisky', 'nudity', 'quite', 'hot', 'only', 'Paul', 'too', 'much', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'Frustrated', 'connected', 'diner', 'coffee', 'where', 'Man', 'Afemo', 'Omilami', 'who', 'be', 'Son', 'God.The', 'Man', 'certainly', 'lot', 'Paul', 'Paul', '8217', 'soiled', 'past', 'aside', 'conversation', 'have', 'Paul', 'answer', 'simple', 'questions', 'What', 'Do', 'Believe', 'can', '8217', 'forget', 'Frank', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Sandy', 'Angela', 'Featherstone', 'not', 'happy', 'woman', 'Sandy', 'bars', 'looking', 'company', 'Isn', '8217', 'hard', 'find', 'what', 'Not', 'bra-less', 'thin', 'white', 'tank-top', 'here', 'there', 'quite', 'sensual', 'barfly', 'kind', 'way', 'sole', 'soul', 'purpose', 'torment', 'loser-ness', 'husband.There', 'always', 'homemade', 'cherry', 'pie', 'fresh', 'coffee', 'jukebox', '8211', 'outdated', 'selection', '8211', 'always', 'ready', 'play.Beneath', 'Dark', 'nothing', 'new', 'Sadly', 'knew', 'end', 'story', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'flood', '8220', 'identical', '8221', 'big-screen', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'same', 'ending', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'could', 'name', 'see', 'one', '8212', 'then', 'have', 'ruined', 'ending', 'rest', 'hate', 'Hate', 'story', 'was', 'as', 'solid', 'acting', 'enjoyed', 'dialogue', 'was', 'crisp', 'enough', 'filming', 'was', 'simple', 'effective.If', 'were', 'assume', 'saw', 'none', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'ending', '8212', 'then', 'excellent', 'movie', 'not', 'then', 'mediocre', 'film', 'Beneath', 'Dark', '2010', '8212', 'are', 'cusp', '2014', 'am', 'going', 'assume', 'ladder', 'give', 'movie', '3', '5', 'Stars.Zombie', 'AuthorPhillip', 'Tomasso', '[', ']']",N/A
