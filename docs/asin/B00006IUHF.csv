For instance, WWI is three glimpses, none of which involve battles or anything as vulgar as that.You have a lot of talk, which is believed by the characters and by the filmmaker to be profound and insightful, but which is merely stupid.You have people who are able to manufacture misery out of thin air.  Even when they're living in an idyllic Swiss villa with no need to work, they manage to be miserable.You have the work of a factory lovingly portrayed with many, many glimpses.It is sad that people have been made to regard such posturing as art, and even sadder that some people take such sick observations about life seriously.  The only profound remark in the entire film is that love is what matters.  True, it is; but this film does not illustrate that.  Still less does it make the audience feel that.",2,Take a long look at the critical reviews before you buy,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,1173,"['What', 'when', 'Europeans', 'apply', 'methods', 'closet', 'drama', 'make', 'epic', 'have', 'usual', 'main', 'characters', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'sight', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'get', 'know', 'better.You', 'have', 'action', 'whatever', 'screen', 'entire', '165', 'minutes', 'not', 'three', 'hours', '.You', 'have', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'rather', 'scenes', 'instance', 'WWI', 'three', 'glimpses', 'none', 'involve', 'battles', 'anything', 'as', 'vulgar', 'that.You', 'have', 'lot', 'talk', 'believed', 'characters', 'filmmaker', 'be', 'profound', 'insightful', 'merely', 'stupid.You', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'manufacture', 'misery', 'thin', 'air', 'Even', 'when', ""'re"", 'living', 'idyllic', 'Swiss', 'villa', 'need', 'work', 'manage', 'be', 'miserable.You', 'have', 'work', 'factory', 'lovingly', 'portrayed', 'many', 'many', 'glimpses.It', 'sad', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'regard', 'such', 'posturing', 'art', 'even', 'sadder', 'people', 'take', 'such', 'sick', 'observations', 'life', 'seriously', 'only', 'profound', 'remark', 'entire', 'film', 'love', 'what', 'matters', 'True', 'film', 'not', 'illustrate', 'Still', 'less', 'make', 'audience', 'feel']",Les Destinees
717145,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00006IUHF,Doug Anderson,"[0, 0]","In the first shot of the film, Protestant minister Jean Barnery (Charles Berling) is leading a funeral procession. The year is 1900 and one of the great patriarchs of one of the great manufacturing families/dynasties has died and the entire village dressed in black has turned out to mourn his passing. Assayas frames the shot to look like Gustave Courbet's famous painting of a mid-19th century funeral procession. Although this film will deal with the changing fortunes of two families (one a cognac manufacturer, the other a porcelain manufacturer), this shot and this film is less about history, and its various disruptions and continuities, than it is about Jean and the ascetic devotions that provide the substance and sustenance of his life. At the graveside he tells his congregation that everything in this world will disappoint and that we must live this life in preparation for the next. Though Jean will leave the church, he'll never entirely abandon this ascetic philosophy.The film, based on a famous novel by Jacques Chardonne (an aristocrat who later favored collaboration with Nazi Germany --although this fact does not feature in this film), is divided into three one-hour sub-sections, each sub-section covers a ten-year span of time and centers around Jean's dominant devotion(s) of that particular period. The first section focuses on Jean's (largely successful) attempt to distance himself from the worldly concerns of his wealthy family of porcelian manufacturers, his largely unsuccesful devotion to the church, and his on-again off-again devotion to his first wife Nathalie (Isabelle Huppert) and daughter Aline (Mia Hansen-Love). The second sub-section focuses on Jean's (mostly unsuccesful) attempts to flee the world of responsibility (business and family ties) and find happiness far from the madding crowd in the Swiss mountains with his second wife Pauline (Emmanuella Beart). And the third sub-section focuses on Jean's decision to return to the world of business and family responsibility and his (partially successful) attempts to save the family's porcelain business in Limoges.The first sub-section is the least satisfying section of the film as too many characters are introduced with very little attempt to explain their relationships. Of course part of the pleasure of watching an historical epic is figuring out who is who and how they will figure in the over-all story, but Assayas, who has made his reputation on small films that focus on only a handful of intimates over a relatively short period of time, seems out of his element here and really uninterested in painting a rich panorama of intersecting lives/destinies. However, once we accept that Jean is the only character that Assayas really cares about and his the only destiny that we are being asked to contemplate, we adjust our expectations and spend far less time caring about the rest of the players. Assayas certainly seems more interested in the particulars of cognac and porcelain production than in the particularities of any of his supporting players.How much patience you have for this epic (that is really not an epic but one man's coming-of-age disguised as an epic's coming-of-age), will depend on how interesting you are in Jean's perpetual un-happiness and inability to find any satisfaction from any of his changing devotions (religion, love, family, porcelain). The only other character who peaks our interest is Jean's first wife Nathalie (Isabelle Hupert) who we find to be even more obsessive and demanding and perpetually unhappy than her ex-husband. Unlike Nathalie (whose singleminded devotion to an ideal is frightening even to Jean), Jean does undergo a kind of third-act/death bed conversion, but instead of suddenly finding religion, he finds that life is meaningless without love. Of course this revelation only comes after years of being utterly incapable of loving anyone or finding any joy in life (with the sole exception of one brief Bergman-esque moment beneath a cherry tree).Assayas (born in 1955) was not exactly a young man when he made Les Destinees (2000) but he was a man who had only made a few features at this point in his career, most notably Irma Vep (1996) and Late August/Early September (1998) which are both films about artistic identity. My guess is that he made Les Destinees as a way of figuring out his own artistic identity/destiny (and perhaps as a way of identifying and overcoming his own faults). Certainly we can read the films interest in quality goods as a way for Assayas to examine his own interest in quality films and what it takes (and what one must sacrifice) to maintain an almost ascetic devotion to quality in an age with fewer and fewer connoisseurs who appreciate quality. Jean's ascetic devotion to quality never seems life-affirming until the very end at which time he seems filled with a kind of life-affirming understanding and forgiveness (of his own and other people's faults) that his earlier self would never have allowed. And this seems to be the revelation that Assayas found in this material: that we can be several selves throughout our lives and that when we look back on our previous selves we may not even recognize those earlier selves. Luckily for Jean, he saves his best self for last. Like Jean, Assayas is at his best when he merges his love of tradition/craft with his love of life-affirming youth and innocence. The merging of these traits is most evident in his masterpiece Summer Hours (2008) and, to a lesser extent, in his latest film, Something in the Air (2012).Assayas just doesn't seem comfortable with the historical epic. He does not spend enough time creating a rich tapestry of characters that the genre requires and he never sufficently develops or foregrounds the importance of the historical material (ie the working class's changing attitude toward their aristocratic lords). So for most filmmgoers this is a three star film at best. But for Assayas fans the film has added interest as many of his familiar themes--identity, rapidly changing social conditions (as well as radical shifts in personal perspective), devotion to a craft--- gain new valence here, hence my four star rating.",4,An Attempt at Historical Epic that plays more like an Artistic Coming-of-Age,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,6197,"['first', 'shot', 'film',

In the case of the film ""Les Destinees,"" the beginning is in 1900, and the end arrives three decades later. In the middle is the meat of this film, and this includes:A scandalous divorceAn idyllic soujourn in SwitzerlandThe First World WarThe fortunes of a porcelain producing familyThe inside of a swinging Parisian nightclub circa 1930A religious conversionAn adulterous affairThe stock market crash of the 1920sThe production of several lines of porcelainCherry pickingAnd I have probably missed a few things...Now while this DVD may last three hours, there is enough material in this film to make a mini-series. This is a sumptuous epic--gorgeous sets, marvellous scenery, wonderful costumes--but somehow or another all these lovely trappings just left me cold. It was like consuming a beautiful but hollow cake--perfect icing, but nothing underneath. The story was just too involved to condense adequately and meaningfully into three hours. There were many scenes that added nothing at all to the main thread of the story--the enduring nature of love. Many of the scenes could have been very comfortably cut from the film--at absolutely no loss to the plot. What was the trip to America all about? It added nothing--except, I suppose, it helped qualify ""Les Destinees"" as an epic, and the bar scene with all the wild young ones, and the religious conversion. Chop, chop chop--all worthless.Charles Berling was excellent as the minister who dumps the church, but Emmanuelle Beart as his wife, Pauline was too wooden and pouty for my tastes. She trounced around the sets like a little girl. She looks good, but the acting....Now I am going to add here that I usually LOVE French films, and consume a regular diet of foreign films. This was a disappointment. If I rate ""Les Destinees"" against other French films, I would probably give it two stars, but if I match it against most of the tripe out there, it starts to look better, so for this reason, I am giving it three stars.
