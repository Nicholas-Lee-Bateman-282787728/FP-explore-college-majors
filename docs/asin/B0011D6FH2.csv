1130993,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0011D6FH2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Since 1999, ""Naruto"" created by Masashi Kishimoto (""Karakuri"") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.For the anime series, since 2002, ""Naruto"" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes.  The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities.  The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need.  But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities.  For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions.  He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older.  Of course, there is so much involved in the ""Naruto"" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series.""Naruto"", the first series ended with the young ninja leaving to train with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years.Here we are now with ""Naruto Shippuden"" (Naruto: Hurrican Chronicles), a sequel to the ""Naruto"" series which began a month after the first series ended in Feb. 2007 and as of Feb. 25, 2010, ""Naruto Shippuden"" aired its 149th episode in Japan.  The series has been streaming through [...] a week after its airing in Japan with English subtitles but for fans who have wanted the English dub, the series began airing on Disney's XD channel.  The series has been released in individual volumes (with a total of four episodes) courtesy of Shonen Jump Home Video ala Viz Media and also as complete season box sets.In the sequel, Naruto arrives after his training and now he's a little older, taller but still is the same naive and energetic kid that he was when he left.  Many things have changed since Naruto has left.  Sasuke is still gone.  Sakura has been training under current Hokage Lady Tsunade, while in the sand village, Gaara has succeeded his father as Sunagakure's Kazekage (the leader of the village).This time the threat to the ninja clans are the Akatsuki, a criminal organization which includes powerful ninjas who defected from their villages and a group which include Sasuke's brother Itachi.  At this current time, not much is known of what the Akatsuki are planning but the ninja clans are all under alert trying to figure out what their next move will be.Here is a brief spoilerless summary of the first four episodes.EPISODE 1 - Homecoming - Naruto arrives after his two and half year training with Jiraiya and learns of how things have changed a bit in the village.EPISODE 2 - The Akatsuki Makes Its Move - The criminal organization Akatsuki makes its move against the Sand Ninja.  Meanwhile, Naruto and Sakura must go against their sensei Kakashi in redoing one of their earlier test trials.EPISODE 3 - The Results of Training - Kakashi learns how far Sakura and Naruto have become.  Meanwhile, a traitor is revealed from the Sand Village.EPISODE 4 - The Jinchuriki of the Sand - The conclusion to Naruto and Sakura's test.  Meanwhile, Gaara takes on Akatsuki's Deidara.VIDEO & AUDIO:One thing I noticed when it came to ""Naruto"" is that the series has had its share of well-animated and well-painted artistic backgrounds but then for some of the filler episodes, has had a decrease in quality.  Fortunately, ""Naruto Shippuden"" looks very solid.  I really like how the characters look much older and the emotions on the character's faces to the action that takes place in the Leaf and Sand Village is pretty cool.  For the most part, with the four episodes that I've watched, Studio Pierrot has done a pretty solid job with ""Naruto Shippuden"".As for the audio, audio is pretty much Stereo Bilingual (Japanese and English).  Similar to a series like ""Dragon Ball Z"", with ""Naruto"", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series.  It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.  But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.  Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Naruto Shippuden"" doesn't come with any special features but trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:What a wonderful start for ""Naruto Shippuden"".  So, many fans who have been watching the anime series since its release back in 2002 have grown with this series and watched every episode continuously for so many years and now, here we are with the sequel that is full of action and for the most part, seeing how these characters progressed as a ninja and also have grown older in terms of the way they look.  As usual, there is a lot of action but there is a lot of humor in the series and to see him and Sakura together especially taking on Kakashi-sensei was so hilarious.These uncut episodes do include the commercial bumpers in the beginning and end and also includes the short animated sequence which features the characters in super-deformed format or features a character teaching the viewer something about their village or special ability.Overall, ""Naruto Shippuden"" is a great anime series and this first volume is definitely a great start for the sequel.  But if you are planning to watch the series from beginning to end, you may want to purchase the DVD box set 1 which contains the first 13 episodes, special features and a limited edition version of the complete season which comes with a mini ninja Naruto and an exclusive art card.",5,"What a fun, action-packed series ""Naruto Shippuden"" has turned out to be!",1268179200,"03 10,

Though it doesn't advance the main story much, actually it's a bit difficult to try and place this story within the series, but it is soon forgiven for the action is awesome (especially good if you're a fan of Rock Lee)and it heightens the devices the series tends to use sparingly (CGI effects).I won't trouble you by spoiling the story, it's bland and easily understood, aaaaaaaand the execution of the story is one that you've seen before in many other Naruto movies.  In fact, if anyone can tell me a Naruto movie that advances the main story, please let me know, I haven't seen them all and I'm starting to see an awkward pattern that could turn me off to the movies, but my fandom menace won't let me stop buying them.All in all, for those of you who are buying the volumes individually, treat this as an optional supplement to tide you over until the next volume is released.  For those of you who are still waiting patiently to get your first hit of Shippuden in full in January, then you won't even notice this movie and probably buy it for kicks.  For those of you who like to watch Rock Lee do his thing again (including his drunken fist) then cop this in full confidence.The villains in this movie are creative, but that's a bar that the series set for itself and at this point we expect no less, so really it's nothing truly outstanding from the series' standards.  The CGI used in this is considerable but does skim the boundary of gratuitous (sure it saves money, but do we really NEED it? it doesn't necessarily communicate with the animated characters well, but this movie manages to keep you from saying anything negative about it while it's going)So all I have to say is that I wasn't disappointed in buying this, I got action at a time length comparable to a volume of the series and I got to see my favorite characters from the Naruto universe thwart yet another threat to the world...but as long as the regions that encompass the Naruto main story are left untouched, then I wouldn't mind seeing the rest of the world plunge into an oblivion of weaponized chakra...",3,The only way to accept filler from this series!,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2289,"['first', 'film', 'series', 'good', 'offering', 'considering', 'technically', 'filler', 'tell', 'truth', 'filler', 'good', 'production', 'value', 'alright', 'casual', 'fan', ""n't"", 'advance', 'main', 'story', 'much', 'actually', 'bit', 'difficult', 'try', 'place', 'story', 'series', 'soon', 'forgiven', 'action', 'awesome', 'especially', 'good', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Rock', 'Lee', 'devices', 'series', 'use', 'sparingly', 'CGI', 'effects', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'spoiling', 'story', 'bland', 'easily', 'understood', 'aaaaaaaand', 'execution', 'story', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'Naruto', 'movies', 'fact', 'anyone', 'can', 'tell', 'Naruto', 'movie', 'main', 'story', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'starting', 'see', 'awkward', 'pattern', 'could', 'turn', 'movies', 'fandom', 'menace', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'buying', 'them.All', 'who', 'are', 'buying', 'volumes', 'individually', 'treat', 'optional', 'supplement', 'tide', 'next', 'volume', 'released', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'get', 'first', 'hit', 'Shippuden', 'full', 'January', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'movie', 'probably', 'buy', 'kicks', 'who', 'watch', 'Rock', 'Lee', 'do', 'thing', 'again', 'including', 'drunken', 'fist', 'then', 'cop', 'full', 'confidence.The', 'villains', 'movie', 'are', 'creative', 'bar', 'series', 'set', 'point', 'expect', 'less', 'really', 'nothing', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'series', 'standards', 'CGI', 'used', 'considerable', 'skim', 'boundary', 'gratuitous', 'sure', 'money', 'do', 'really', 'NEED', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'communicate', 'animated', 'characters', 'well', 'movie', 'keep', 'saying', 'anything', 'negative', 'going', 'all', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'buying', 'got', 'action', 'time', 'length', 'comparable', 'volume', 'series', 'got', 'see', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Naruto', 'universe', 'thwart', 'yet', 'threat', 'world', 'as', 'long', 'regions', 'encompass', 'Naruto', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'left', 'untouched', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'rest', 'world', 'plunge', 'oblivion', 'weaponized', 'chakra']",Movie-Naruto Shippuden

The major jist of the movie is that the team of Naruto, Sakura, Rock Lee, and Neji are sent on a mission to protect a young priestess from another country to stop a group of unknown rogues from reawakening an ancient evil and it's demonic ghost army, the young priestess named Shion not only has the power to reseal the spirit but has the foresight to predict another persons death which has ostracized her from most people who fear and shun her a situation which Naruto is all to familiar with with his own curse of containing the nine-tailed fox demon spirit within him.  The movie will show throughout the film the change as the young priestess changes from stoic to more open with her feelings with the help of Naruto who she has predicted will die but is amazed to see that not only does he reject the prediction but announces to save and protect her and finish the mission as well as defy this supposed fate of his.  The animation is very well done and the cast for the voice actors/actresses is right on the money the extras aren't the greatest but many like myself I feel don;t really bother with those to much any way, so for all us Naruto fans waiting for the star of the next saga of the series here's a great dvd to try out as we wait and for any anime fan try checking out the trailer online or watch the series online it might just make a fan of you for the series...",4,A Decent Naruto Movie But Nothing To Spectacular,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1724,"['finally', 'getting', 'Naruto', 'box', 'sets', 'now', ""'m"", 'just', 'waiting', 'Shippuden', 'box', 'sets', 'come', 'was', 'kind', 'surprised', 'already', 'released', 'first', 'Shippuden', 'movie', 'already', 'now', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'movie', 'feel', 'nice', 'add', 'rest', 'Naruto', 'movie', 'set', 'not', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'either', 'major', 'jist', 'movie', 'team', 'Naruto', 'Sakura', 'Rock', 'Lee', 'Neji', 'are', 'sent', 'mission', 'protect', 'young', 'priestess', 'country', 'stop', 'group', 'unknown', 'rogues', 'reawakening', 'ancient', 'evil', 'demonic', 'ghost', 'army', 'young', 'priestess', 'named', 'Shion', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'reseal', 'spirit', 'foresight', 'predict', 'persons', 'death', 'ostracized', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'fear', 'shun', 'situation', 'Naruto', 'familiar', 'own', 'curse', 'containing', 'nine-tailed', 'fox', 'demon', 'spirit', 'movie', 'will', 'show', 'film', 'change', 'young', 'priestess', 'changes', 'stoic', 'more', 'open', 'feelings', 'help', 'Naruto', 'who', 'predicted', 'will', 'die', 'amazed', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'reject', 'prediction', 'announces', 'save', 'protect', 'finish', 'mission', 'as', 'well', 'defy', 'supposed', 'fate', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'cast', 'voice', 'actors/actresses', 'right', 'money', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'many', 'feel', 'don', 'really', 'bother', 'much', 'way', 'Naruto', 'fans', 'waiting', 'star', 'next', 'saga', 'series', 'here', 'great', 'dvd', 'try', 'out', 'wait', 'anime', 'fan', 'try', 'checking', 'out', 'trailer', 'online', 'watch', 'series', 'online', 'might', 'just', 'make', 'fan', 'series']",Movie-Naruto Shippuden

The movie does a great job at capitilizing upon the fact that Naruto just returned to the Hidden Leaf Village and has not gone out on many missions nor has he seen everyone just yet.  In fact in this movie when he teams up with Neji, Lee, and Sakura, the writers make it appear that this is Naruto's first time encountering Neji and Lee since his arrival.  Generally speaking, the movie focuses on this team's mission of protecting a very important person and leading her to the designated destination. With evil afoot, they must use multiple tricks in their ninja handbooks to ensure success of their mission.I loved it, and although most of them do not use any new jutsu since the first season of Naruto (possibly Lee uses more of the gates of opening than was seen during his fight against Gaara during the Chunin exams), it is memorable to sit back and listen to the jutsu (and nearly say word for word what the character says).  I was also intrigued by the medical ninjutsu of the enemies.The movie excels in being a great film for fans and some newcomers since it is light on the background material and easy on the narrative.  I loved the incorporation of multiple 3D effects such as 3D environments and planes/enemies.  It looked well put together and actually flowed with the 2D imagery.  Music was also on key with the Naruto Shippuden theme appearing in the usual places and some ""made for the movie"" tunes pumping us up for the events.For the DVD, my version seemed to lack the option for subtitles, and only included the English audio, no special features, nor subtitles.  Cover art to the DVD is amazing with both the design on the disc, as well as the design of the cover.  This is definitely a must buy for Naruto fans, even with the lack of special features (seemed the only movie that VIZ has made that has had numerous features was the first Bleach Movie).",5,A Nice Entry for the First Shippuden Moive,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,1994,"['Naruto', 'Shippuden-', 'Movie', 'great', 'experience', 'first', 'entry', 'movie', 'set', 'Shippuden', 'storyline', 'period', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'capitilizing', 'fact', 'Naruto', 'just', 'returned', 'Hidden', 'Leaf', 'Village', 'not', 'gone', 'out', 'many', 'missions', 'seen', 'everyone', 'just', 'yet', 'fact', 'movie', 'when', 'up', 'Neji', 'Lee', 'Sakura', 'writers', 'make', 'appear', 'Naruto', 'first', 'time', 'encountering', 'Neji', 'Lee', 'arrival', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'movie', 'team', 'mission', 'protecting', 'very', 'important', 'person', 'leading', 'designated', 'destination', 'evil', 'afoot', 'must', 'use', 'multiple', 'tricks', 'ninja', 'handbooks', 'ensure', 'success', 'mission.I', 'loved', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'new', 'jutsu', 'first', 'season', 'Naruto', 'possibly', 'Lee', 'more', 'gates', 'opening', 'was', 'seen', 'fight', 'Gaara', 'Chunin', 'exams', 'memorable', 'sit', 'back', 'listen', 'jutsu', 'nearly', 'say', 'word', 'word', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'medical', 'ninjutsu', 'enemies.The', 'movie', 'excels', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'light', 'background', 'material', 'easy', 'narrative', 'loved', 'incorporation', 'multiple', '3D', 'effects', 'such', '3D', 'environments', 'planes/enemies', 'looked', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'actually', 'flowed', '2D', 'imagery', 'Music', 'was', 'also', 'key', 'Naruto', 'Shippuden', 'theme', 'appearing', 'usual', 'places', 'made', 'movie', 'tunes', 'pumping', 'events.For', 'DVD', 'version', 'seemed', 'lack', 'option', 'subtitles', 'only', 'included', 'English', 'audio', 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'Cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'design', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'design', 'cover', 'definitely', 'must', 'buy', 'Naruto', 'fans', 'even', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'seemed', 'only', 'movie', 'VIZ', 'made', 'had', 'numerous', 'features', 'was', 'first', 'Bleach', 'Movie']",Movie-Naruto Shippuden
