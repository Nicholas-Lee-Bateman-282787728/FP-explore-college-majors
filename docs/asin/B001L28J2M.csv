Her doctor (Janeane Garofalo) gives her the truth about life and tumors3. Her boss gives her the axe4. Her boyfriend needs space5. After brief contemplation of death, she decides to live a little6. She rents a spacious loft on a short term lease, and proceeds to fill it with everything her heart desires, including an axe (a Fender Stratocaster 1963, if you want to be specific)7. She gets special deliveries from the parcel guy and the delivery girl.8. Life goes on.Most of the good stuff in this movie can be seen in the trailer, which if made a little longer might actually have been better than the movie itself.  Great trailer that!Normally this isn't the kind of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch, but the thing that holds your attention is the transformation of the down-trodden young woman of the first few scenes into this sensuous guitar-wielding free spirit, achieved purely through a total disregard for consequences.Unrealistic situations almost overpower this movie, but it's still a lot better than I expected, largely due to a haunting (and offbeat) performance by Burrows.Recommended for those with the urge for something a little different.

She stole the whole show. A very decent and neat performence by the British actress. Isaach de Bankole is brilliant as well, his interactions with Saffron results in a good chemistry between them. Paz Le Huerta delivers a good performence as well. The film invites many perspectives from people. You can like it, hate it, its totally upto your perspective. The most importent thing is, the film is quite genuine, you can feel the situations, you can sense Saffron's feelings, her emotions.

1212885,A3FXT4UPI30K7S,B001L28J2M,"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author""","[5, 8]","The opening scenes of THE GUITAR set a mood of near total collapse of one woman's entire support system, as she loses her job, her boyfriend, and her dream of a long life in a sudden and devastating fell swoop of massive misfortune. Taking this rather shocking series of events as a catalyst for pursuing moth-balled dreams and childhood fantasies, our heroine, Melody Wilder, begins a brand new life for herself which is completely free from all the burdens and pressures and drudgery of her past.Without divulging the heart of the story, so as to refrain from spoiling the film for those who wish to savor its full sensual experience, our heroine begins an inner and outer journey to overcome all manner of prior self restrictions and limitations. Some of these restrictions and limitations are evident in matters of social rules and expectations, and others are less outwardly visible, as they comprise the very fabric of Melody's mind and heart.This movie is highly recommended to everyone who has ever felt hemmed in by life's duties, responsibilities and rules... and is an homage to free spirits everywhere who march to the beat of their own drummers.I love the dreamy, surreal cinematography in this film, and the casting of each of the key acting roles.

1212886,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001L28J2M,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","If it weren't for the director, Amy Redford's famous father, Robert Redford, this film probably would have never seen the light of day (the Sundance, Robert Redford's film festival, nomination makes sense now). It's unfortunate that directing talent isn't genetic. Clint Eastwood's daughter is another second generation that proves the ruleRails & Ties : Widescreen Edition.Shot in 21 days, using some really poor filmstock for the low light scenes, and is horribly predictable. The first 30 minutes of the film shows some really creative flim making. An hour and a half, in English with no subtitles.A woman finds out she has inoperable terminal cancer and has 2 months to live. What does she do, how does she live out the rest of her days? This is the central question to The Guitar. No this is not a sad reflective crying type film, Melody has an epiphany and changes her whole life; she has fun. Not the kind of fun most might think, but an introspective nearly alone type fun. A vegetarian, she decides to eat meat! The viewer is supposed to believe that she has taught herself to play the guitar.The good of this film. Saffron Burrows and Paz de la Huerta are very comfortable with being naked, and they both have beautiful bodies. All very much in keeping with the film and the theme of changing her life; not in a salacious manner.The opening 30 minutes. The director uses music subtly to reinforce, but not bludgeon, the action in the film. The walk down a New York street, is choreographed almost perfectly. The discussion with Jeneane Garofalo, her doctor, close up view of her speaking, mouth moving, sound turned way down. The lighting in these scenes. The nearly perfect editing. After Melody finds out she will die, the low angle shots are perfection, they look like she is being carried away on a guerney to die. The tracking shot at her work, from way down low, reinforces the death theme. The boss that tells her she's fired. The shots all of a sudden start to raise higher - she's relieved in a way from this death sentance in her work. Melody's decent to her apartment, shot from above, like lowering into the earth. A level shot at the bathtub when she looks at the razor blade, but then flashes back to her childhood and the red guitar. And she decides to move to a loft. She buys the loft, and orders the Vera Wang ""womb"" bed. Symbolizes her rebirth.At this point the film gets totally lost and no longer maintains the near perfection of editing, sound, and shot angles (which should be progressing to higher shots, but now bounce around between high and low for no reason). The lighting is way off, there are many scenes now using really bad grainy film stock that was underexposed, cut in with perfectly exposed film, not the least bit grainy. Sound no longer follows or is reinforces the action, it begins to blugeon the viewer.The critical moment for this reviewer was when Roscoe, the delivery man, shows up at her apartment and they have intercourse. He's a married man, there was no legitimate creative reason why that had to happen. The editing, the camera placement, the words, sound, and music, all conspire against the director at this point. The film has now become simply a standard melodrama. Especially when Cookie, a single female pizza delivery person, also has intercourse with Melody. The point is perfectly made with Cookie, and could have forgone the Roscoe problem. There is a hokey transition back to Roscoe - seen in black shadow cast by the moon, Melody caresses the head of her Fender guitar. The symbolism is a bit too much, it's way too phallic, and then the next scene is just too predictible. Roscoe shows up and they make love. Then the viewer is treated to a threesome. No, none of this is terribly exciting. There's a bit of irony during this scene, a David Bowie song performed by somebody else is played.The nail in the coffin so to speak was the thread of where Melody learns to play the guitar (get the irony of the name?). Her dreams are of a Fender Stratocaster from her childhood (she doesn't know that, but this reviewer happened to recognize that guitar in the window). She calls a guitar store and orders a good guitar, money doesn't matter, and she's just a beginner. ""A Fender Stratocaster 1963, that sounds good."" And she orders two Marshall amps. The delivery, four stacked amps, two Marshalls, and two unidentifiable amps; and the Fender (oh a gorgeous guitar, sadly in red not Hendrix white). Now there is no reason in the world this person needs 2 amplifiers (one guitar / one amp), and they delivered two extras for fun.Melody then begins to teach herself to play the guitar. She vapidly strums the guitar. As the movie progresses, she's seen badly strumming two chords. Then breaks into bending a note, and playing like a genius, well decent genius. After only a month maybe of playing, she has learned vibrato and bending a note - not likely at all. But then later goes back to playing very poorly. There is no way to believe what this person has done with the guitar. In the last three minutes, what happens is impossible, and not anywhere near credible.The viewer is also treated to Melody's voice fading in and out with no consitency - one moment she speaks in a normal tone, the next she whispers, and then normal again. No it makes no sense really.The director uses slo-motion effects poorly during some of the dream sequences. The one that is supposed to really latch on is the stealing of the guitar scene, the head of the guitar with Fender Stratocaster should be visible and in focus. Sadly the director did not get the shot, and the words are just blurry.Very near the end of the film, Melody recites some deep thought Patti Smith poetry. It actually comes out of nowhere, and is just not effective.The opening 30 minutes take this film from completely forgetable to a study of how a director can drop a brilliant idea.The movie is definately rated R, nudity, language, and sensual situations. There is no violence.The DVD is sad. One bonus feature, the trailer. In fact, if you read this review (not one spoiler was written) and watch the trailer, you've essentially seen the film. THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED. This last bit seems to be a significant faux pas. No film should be released without subtitles. There were two other English sound tracks, but this reviewer could not bring himself to watch this again to figure out what they are.The director needed to take another 21 days to reshoot and get the rest of the film right.",2,"A Good 30 Minute movie, a bad boring movie at 90 minutes",1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,6537,"['were', ""n't"", 'director', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'famous', 'father', 'Robert',

1212887,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001L28J2M,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","""THE GUITAR"" marks the directorial debut of actress Amy Redford and focuses on the character of Melody ""Mel"" Wilder (Saffron Burrows), a woman who has one of the worst days anyone can live.Mel has been laid off from her office job due to downsizing, then when she goes to meet her boyfriend and tell him the bad news, he tells her that he needs his space because she's suffocating him and leaves her.  And what better way to end a crappy day by being told by your doctor that you are going to die from cancer and you have two months to live.For Mel, having been diagnosed with inoperable cancer in her throat and losing everything in her life, she contemplates ending her life but manages to see an ad about a loft being rented out for a very short time.Mel, decides that if she's going to die, she's going to enjoy her last weeks by doing the things that she dreams of.She rents the pretty spacious and beautiful loft, ditches all her clothing (thus living in the loft naked) and with her three credit cards, starts going on a spending rampage.  Ordering a Vera Wang mattress, ordering a genuine leather couch, and so many designer vases, lamps and clothing.  She also decides to change her eating habits by straying away from her vegan life and eating whatever she wants, including expensive meals and putting it all on her credit card.But each time she sleeps, in her dreams we see how Mel, as a young girl has always desired a red electric guitar.  As a child that is passionate about music, her parents never could buy her an electric guitar but she feels that why not do it now.  So, she buys top notch amps, speakers and a classic electric guitar and learns to play it.While she lives this life, she constantly meets her delivery man Roscoe (played by Issach De Bankole) and her pizza delivery girl Cookie (Paz de la Huerta).Roscoe is a married man but somehow is attracted to Mel and the same can be said for Cookie and next thing you know, Mel starts having passionate sex with Roscoe and Cookie, separately and eventually, a M&eacute;nage &agrave; trois.For Mel, living the last weeks of her life and experience the material things, the foods and the company of people that she would have never have had in her life and knowing how it has brought her happiness but somewhat acceptance of her own mortality.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE GUITAR"" is presented in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The film tends to exhibit a lot of grain since there are a lot of low-light, indoor scenes.  But overall, during well-lit scenes, the video is good.Audio is presented in Dolby Surround 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0.  The film is strictly a dialogue film but music, especially when Mel plays the electric guitar really comes out quite well through your front channel speakers.SPECIAL FEATURES:Although it is not mentioned on the DVD and nor is it listed under special features, you can access the optional audio commentary by Director Amy Redford under the setup menu.  Really good commentary and Amy Redford sets up certain scenes from the crowd shots, buildings used, having a closed set due to Saffron's nudity in the film.  Very informative and well-done commentary by Redford.JUDGMENT CALL:""THE GUITAR"" is definitely a enjoyable film and it's quite rare to see a film like this.  Erotic, stylish, fun...  I have to say that Saffron Burrows really brought her A-game in portraying the character of Mel and what she wants to experience in life as she faces mortality.  She did a fantastic job for this role.I have to admit, I was surprised by the amount of nudity and love making in this film.  Having seen Saffron Burrows (TV shows such as ""My Own Worst Enemy"" and ""Boston Legal"") in many roles on television but then to watch her nude on the first half of the film and see how erotic this role was.But as much as the film featured erotic scenes, its the actual cinematography and overall direction from Mel being in this dark place and then being awakened and leaving her old life and belongings and then  just changing her life and living the way she has always wanted for her last two months of life.  There are some memorable imagery from Mel playing the guitar, the candles lit throughout her apartment, Mel throwing her trash out the window and many more memorable scenes.As much as I enjoyed this film, if I had to nitpick on something is the lack of special features on the DVD.  I wish there were interviews with the talent especially with Burrows.  But for those wondering if the message of the film shows that one who is dying should max out their credit cards in order to have this freedom to own things out of one's financial reach, Mel does face trouble because of her spending and has to make difficult decisions at the end of the film.Again, a wonderful performance by Saffron Burrows who did a great job in making this role believable and making the film shine!  This is a rare type of film to see and overall, it was quite entertaining.  Highly recommended!",5,"Enjoyable fascinating and erotic, 'THE GUITAR' is unique.

1212888,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B001L28J2M,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","""The Guitar""(Anchor Bay, 2007)--------------------------------------------ATTN: Spoilersville, if it matters...--------------------------------------------In the same day, a New Yorker named Melodie Wilder (played by Saffron Burroughs) gets fired, gets dumped by her boyfriend and is told she has incurable cancer, and only about a month to live. Being, understandably, a bit bummed out by all this bad news, she opts to drop out from life -- but instead of going to an ashram in the Himalayas, she rents a ginormous, empty loft apartment with a view of the river, picks up the phone and orders everything she possibly can from every catalog imaginable. She has pretty terrible taste (the most expensive of everything!) except for one thing: a red electric guitar just like the one she always wanted as a kid. Although she's cut herself off from humanity, companionship has a way of finding her nonetheless, as she hooks up with the UPS driver and the pizza delivery girl, although her truest companion, predictably, turns out to be the guitar.It's hard to connect with this protagonist -- she's unsympathetic and remote and her retreat into sheer, unfettered materialism plays out like a Restoration Hardware wet dream, even though, obviously, she's headed for a fall, and must learn that the good things in life can't be bought. Anyway, this is a *very* student-film-y film, and although it has interesting touches, there was nothing in it that wasn't utterly predictable, no real surprises for me, even the big twist ending. (Well, except for in the very beginning when the character was told she had esophageal cancer, and I found my own throat tightening uncomfortably, in a sympathy-pain self-suggestion thing, sort of like when men talk about getting kicked in the 'nads... Ugh!  Can't breathe!)  I didn't find the story and the delivery very plausible or convincing, so it never really drew me in, but I suppose it's an okay movie, worth checking out, if you go for on-the-nose art films.",3,What's the worst that could happen...??,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,1996,"['Guitar', 'Anchor', 'Bay', '2007', 'ATTN', 'Spoilersville', 'same', 'day', 'New', 'Yorker', 'named', 'Melodie', 'Wilder', 'played', 'Saffron', 'Burroughs', 'fired', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'told', 'incurable', 'cancer', 'only', 'month', 'live', 'Being', 'understandably', 'bit', 'bummed', 'out', 'bad', 'news', 'drop', 'out', 'life', 'instead', 'going', 'ashram', 'Himalayas', 'ginormous', 'empty', 'loft', 'apartment', 'view', 'river', 'up', 'phone', 'orders', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'catalog', 'imaginable', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'taste', 'most', 'expensive', 'everything', 'one', 'thing', 'red', 'electric', 'guitar', 'just', 'one', 'always', 'wanted', 'kid', 'cut', 'off', 'humanity', 'companionship', 'way', 'finding', 'nonetheless', 'up', 'UPS', 'driver', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'girl', 'truest', 'companion', 'predictably', 'out', 'be', 'guitar.It', 'hard', 'connect', 'protagonist', 'unsympathetic', 'remote', 'retreat', 'sheer', 'unfettered', 'materialism', 'out', 'Restoration', 'Hardware', 'wet', 'dream', 'even', 'obviously', 'headed', 'fall', 'must', 'learn', 'good', 'things', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bought', 'Anyway', '*very*', 'student-film-y', 'film', 'interesting', 'touches', 'was', 'nothing', 'was', ""n't"", 'utterly', 'predictable', 'real', 'surprises', 'even', 'big', 'twist', 'ending', 'Well', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'character', 'was', 'told', 'had', 'esophageal', 'cancer', 'found', 'own', 'throat', 'tightening', 'uncomfortably', 'sympathy-pain', 'self-suggestion', 'thing', 'sort', 'when', 'men', 'talk', 'getting', 'kicked', ""'nads"", 'Ugh', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'delivery', 'very', 'plausible', 'convincing', 'never', 'really', 'drew', 'suppose', 'okay', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'go', 'on-the-nose', 'art', 'films']","Guitar, The"
1212889,AACEZE2YPTJ5D,B001L28J2M,D. Kanigan,"[1, 2]","Supporting the old adage of bad news comes in threes, Melody Wilder learns that she has a terminal illness - - she was then sacked from her job - - followed by being dumped by her boyfriend - - all in the same day.  The film pulls you in wondering what she (or you) would do if you had less than 60 days to live.  Stunned and reeling from the news, Melody comes across a newspaper ad for a spectacular (but empty) penthouse loft overlooking the Hudson River.  She moves in and gorges on the latest styles of furniture and  furnishings and clothes - all ordered from catalogs and delivered - and paid for with credit cards - recognizing she'll never have to account for the charges that are piling up.  Solitude and melancholy fill a number of the early scenes as she comes to grips with her impending death.Saffron Barrows who plays Melody is the star of the film - she can be both engaging and entrancing while saying very little.  The other actors add very little to the film and are a distraction.  I found it quite improbable that Melody would not reach out to family or friends during the entire time - but would connect with the UPS delivery man and a Pizza delivery woman.  While the film opened with considerable promise and is blessed with good cinematography - the plot line and the finish could be described as unsatisfying and contrived.",3,Artsy version of the Bucket List,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,1349,"['Supporting', 'old', 'adage', 'bad', 'news', 'threes', 'Melody', 'Wilder', 'terminal', 'illness', 'was', 'then', 'sacked', 'job', 'followed', 'being', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'same', 'day', 'film', 'pulls', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'had', 'less', '60', 'days', 'live', 'Stunned', 'reeling', 'news', 'Melody', 'newspaper', 'ad', 'spectacular', 'empty', 'penthouse', 'loft', 'overlooking', 'Hudson', 'River', 'gorges', 'latest', 'styles', 'furniture', 'furnishings', 'clothes', 'ordered', 'catalogs', 'delivered', 'paid', 'credit', 'cards', 'recognizing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'account', 'charges', 'are', 'piling', 'up', 'Solitude', 'melancholy', 'fill', 'number', 'early', 'scenes', 'grips', 'impending', 'death.Saffron', 'Barrows', 'who', 'plays', 'Melody', 'star', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'engaging', 'entrancing', 'saying', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'actors', 'add', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'are', 'distraction', 'found', 'quite', 'improbable', 'Melody', 'would', 'not', 'reach', 'family', 'friends', 'entire', 'time', 'would', 'connect', 'UPS', 'delivery', 'man', 'Pizza', 'delivery', 'woman', 'film', 'opened', 'considerable', 'promise', 'blessed', 'good', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'line', 'finish', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'unsatisfying', 'contrived']","Guitar, The"

1212891,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B001L28J2M,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 2]","This is one of the most unique films I've seen in awhile.  It's a somewhat strange tale, and yet hauntingly familiar.  The story centers around Melody (Saffron Burrows).  Melody is an every-day woman, a white collar worker, a plain-Jane with an elegant body.  She can't seem to catch a break (on that issue, it seems that she & I have a lot in common!).  In 1 day she finds out that she is terminally ill, she loses her job & her boyfriend dumps her.All of this leads her to start living an extravagent life.  She rents a loft with a view in New York and uses her credit cards to buy brand new furnishings.  Obviously, she has no worries about ever paying her credit card bills as she doesn't plan to be around more than 8 weeks.  Her confrontation with her own mortality causes her to unleash her Dionysian side!Among the many things she buys via her credit is a red guitar that she dreamed about owning as a little girl.  She finds to her astonishment that she has a real knack for being a musician.  Almost accidentally, new avenues of joy open up to her as she realizes that she is a bi-sexual who enjoys threesomes.  Through it all, the red guitar remains her most faithful companion.This is a film which one does not so much watch as one lives.  We viacariously suffer with Melody and her string of bad luck.  Ironically, when she comes to grip with her own demise, her life ostensibly becomes much more exciting than it was before she was diagnosed w/cancer.  This seems to coincide with Hedigger's motif of ""being-towards-death"" in which one truly treasures what it is to be alive.  When we realize that our tomorrows are limited is when we truly enjoy the fruits of this life.  Or, as Rilke put it, to be alive = to live dangerously.This is a quaint movie, but my gut-feeling is that there are many people out there who are apt to relate to it.  The enigmatic & sometimes subtle Fender Stratocaster soundtrack gives the movie a surreal feeling to it.  This is a film which is at once depressing, sensual and uplifting.

1212892,A264UDLWWRJ7X4,B001L28J2M,D. Summerfield,"[1, 2]","Saffron Burrows is indescribably beautiful.  Her expressive face, gorgeous sharp cheekbones and wide, pensive eyes fill a movie screen.  She is also a wonderful actress -- a woman who can convey joy, heartbreak, puzzlement, love and longing with emotional purity.  I am a fan, and I believe that she will continue to get better and better roles which will meet and stretch her impressive talents.Unfortunately for the terrific Ms. Burrows, she is not doing much more than running through an acting exercise in participating in ""The Guitar,"" a low-budget, independent film which was an entry at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.  I know that some reviewers are raving about the lessons to be learned in this film about the transformative  journey of a young woman who has been told she has only a month or two to live.But the message which was most clearly apparent from this film is that material objects and opulent surroundings can make up for childhood deprivations and a lackluster career.  Then, opines this film, once a person brings all these wonderful expensive objects into their life, love (or at least good sex) and insight will follow.  Not particularly inspiring, and certainly not the lesson one hopes to learn from the impending death of a beautiful young woman.In watching this film, I can understand that a person who was brought up surrounded by wealth and love might think that a person deprived of these things would crave them if death suddenly reared its ugly head.  But for me the film is strangely off-putting, as I followed this young woman's journey through catalog shopping and maxing out her credit cards.  I kept wondering if she was searching for an ultimate meaning for her existence, and if she thought that sleeping on a Vera Wang bed might provide some clue.As the film is called ""The Guitar,"" and the heroine's unfulfilled childhood longing for a red guitar and the lessons to play it are a major plot point, I suppose that the filmmaker is using the heroine's attainment of that goal as a metaphor for purpose in life.  But for me, the journey of this lovely young woman was shallow and ultimately meaningless.",2,Disappointing Sundance Festival Film about Death and Transformation,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,2145,"['Saffron', 'Burrows', 'indescribably', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'face', 'gorgeous', 'sharp', 'cheekbones', 'wide', 'pensive', 'eyes', 'fill', 'movie', 'screen', 'also', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'joy', 'heartbreak', 'puzzlement', 'love', 'longing', 'emotional', 'purity', 'am', 'fan', 'believe', 'will', 'continue', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'roles', 'will', 'meet', 'stretch', 'impressive', 'talents.Unfortunately', 'terrific', 'Ms.', 'Burrows', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'more', 'running', 'acting', 'exercise', 'participating', 'Guitar', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'entry', '2008', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'know', 'reviewers', 'are', 'raving', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'film', 'transformative', 'journey', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'only', 'month', 'two', 'live.But', 'message', 'was', 'most', 'clearly', 'apparent', 'film', 'material', 'objects', 'opulent', 'surroundings', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'childhood', 'deprivations', 'lackluster', 'career', 'Then', 'opines', 'film', 'once', 'person', 'wonderful', 'expensive', 'objects', 'life', 'love', 'least', 'good', 'sex', 'insight', 'will', 'follow', 'Not', 'particularly', 'inspiring', 'certainly', 'not', 'lesson', 'one', 'learn', 'impending', 'death', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman.In', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'surrounded', 'wealth', 'love', 'might', 'think', 'person', 'deprived', 'things', 'would', 'crave', 'death', 'suddenly', 'reared', 'ugly', 'head', 'film', 'strangely', 'off-putting', 'followed', 'young', 'woman', 'journey', 'catalog', 'shopping', 'maxing', 'out', 'credit', 'cards', 'kept', 'wondering', 'was', 'searching', 'ultimate', 'meaning', 'existence', 'thought', 'sleeping', 'Vera', 'Wang', 'bed', 'might', 'provide', 'clue.As', 'film', 'called', 'Guitar', 'heroine', 'unfulfilled', 'childhood', 'longing', 'red', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'play', 'are', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'suppose', 'filmmaker', 'using', 'heroine', 'attainment', 'goal', 'metaphor', 'purpose', 'life', 'journey', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'shallow', 'ultimately', 'meaningless']","Guitar, The"

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 8]","If you found out you were going to die, you'd probably get some of the things you wanted to do out of your system -- which is apparently the point of Saffron Burrows' character in ""The Guitar."" The underrated Burrows does a magnificently nuanced performance in this film, but unfortunately the actual storyline -- complete with random seductions and cold attitudes -- is a sputtering mess.A timid and mousy young woman named Melody (Burrows) has the mother of all bad days -- she loses her job, her boyfriend dumps her (despite her gorgeous looks), and she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing to lose, she leaves her old boring life behind and rents a massive loft, them maxes out her credit cards buying whatever she wants -- food, luxuries, and a red guitar that she's always coveted.Of course, she isn't planning to pay for any of this -- and with no consequences in sight, she also seduces the UPS dude and the pizza girl, both of whom are total strangers. Of course (as all mice do in such movies) Melody becomes a more confident and assured woman in touch with her sexuality and previously unfulfilled desires, but she has a few surprises in store for her that come as quite a shock.I'll give this to director Amy Redford -- she has a style that catches your eye, lush and dreamlike and full of quietly beautiful little moments. ""The Guitar"" steps into roughly the same shoes as other films such as ""My Life Without Me"" and ""My Name is Henry Poole,"" but its intensely art-house flavour and slice-of-life unplot (it's all basically about Melody buying, eating and having sex) sets it apart as being a very different kind of movie.Unfortunately, it's often not a very good movie -- the apparent message is that by spending lots of money you don't intend to repay (kind of sociopathic, no?), you can find happiness, contentment and ""yourself."" Got that? You don't need any kind of enrichment or spiritual balance -- all you need to do is spend vast quantities of money you don't have, and you'll be content. It's like a Cinderella story from the credit card companies.And of course it also conveys that if you don't have to deal with the inevitable consequences of your actions (potential pregnancy, weight gain, debt'n'poverty) you should coldly do whatever you feel like without regard for anyone else -- steal money, sleep with married men, and so on. It might work as a satire of our modern obsessions with money and ""self,"" but unfortunately this movie is dead serious -- and as a result, it's also brimming over with cliches about a woman finding her true self.Moreover, it throws random nudity and plenty of explicit sex into the mix, not because it feels even vaguely natural but because... well, it's nudity and sex. As for the ending? It felt like Amy Redford was desperately trying to avoid either of the obvious endings (either she dies or she lives and has to deal with what she's done), but the one she chose was nothing short of ridiculous.Saffron Burrows is the sole saving grace in this movie -- her quietly expressive face and eyes convey a world of emotion during the story's more delicate scenes. It's unfortunate while her trampled-on character initially is sympathetic, she grows as likable as a boil on your bottom -- she seems to coldly glide through her self-absorbed actions, as if checking different ""wants"" off. And though the red guitar serves as a symbol of the life she's craved, it never becomes prominent enough.""The Guitar"" has a lovely performance by Saffron Burrows, but the rest of the movie is a beautifully filmed clot of  self-absorption and random sex, which is absolved by the obvious adoration of Melody.

Receives a death sentence from her doctor who diagnoses her with a terminal illness, a tumor that is growing in her throat and will ultimately make her lose her voice and die.2. Receives a pink slip from her employer who tells her she is now downsized and gives her a check for a few weeks of severance pay.3. Decides to share her reality with her boyfriend only to hear him say that he has been advised by his mental health counselor to put an end to their relationship because he needs space and distance from her.We feel the subtle sense of despair as she laughs because she is thinking, what else can go wrong?Her doctor advises her to go and put her things in order and that she does, with a vengeance, because she goes home, considers suicide but drops the blade she is about to use and sees an ad for a rather spacious loft which is for rent, but only for a short term lease.We move in with her and experience her loneliness, her despair, her resolve to let go of all that attaches her to this earth. To make us feel her pain she even throws her clothing out the window and lives stark naked for a few days until she decides to transform and thanks to the use of her credit, she buys everything new, clothing, furniture, and her long time dream, an electric guitar she has wanted to own since she was a child.She eats well, ordering great meals each and every night, especially pizza from a local restaurant that is delivered by a young girl who gets taken by her style of life and ends up having a relationship with the heroine of our story. The furniture delivery guy also gets involved with her and her life is so transformed that she forgets time... and loses all stress from daily survival.At some point, her new style of life catches up to her, her credit is finally cut for nonpayment and when she returns to visit her doctor, she discovers that she is no longer ill and the sense of despair created at first now turns into the revival of hope because she is cured, but without a job, with a debt structure and the loss of her new home.But now she is doing what she wants, she has learned to play the electric guitar and the end of the story is that she is now free of stress and doing what she always dreamed...

1212896,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001L28J2M,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 2]","Although The Guitar had good intentions, the message projected seemed a little bit confusing. The producers seemingly want viewers to feel is that you need to live a little to change your whole perception of life, especially in seemingly tragic circumstances, but how they arrive at this is faulty. Melody Wilder (Saffron Burrows), told that she has terminal cancer and only about two months to live, begins a transformation of sorts, but the main question I have is: who was she before?At a pivotal point in The Guitar, Mel's doctor questions her: ""So, what did you change?""  Mel's response is ""Everything."" However, while we can sense and guess who she was before the ""transformation"", this side to her is never really depicted, but rather implied. After viewing the film, the question that seems to be begged is: was she was a better person after getting the news of her terminal cancer, or before? After all, what values and reaffirming attributes can one place on sleeping around with married people and spending money and maxing out credit cards recklessly for furniture, clothes and other material items, which is precisely what Mel does after being told she has two months to live. It might have been helpful to know who she was before all this started.Sure, the vision and flashback to the guitar, (as the movie title implies) is important in her change. The guitar itself might be a symbol of that change, or the goal she had as a child of living life. We are ultimately beaten over the head five or six times with the flashbacks of a young Melanie Wilder seeing a beautiful guitar in a window (once or twice would have sufficed).  Now she can get this guitar, and learns to play,  and she seems to become a more confident, spiritual person who is at one with herself, which is a plus for establishing her character. However, I don't think this along with the spending spree and sex were enough to build much of a story.On the plus side, Saffron Burrows does an excellent job of being Melody Wilder. She seems to bring a solitary, reflective atmosphere to her role, and she was the right person for the role.In the end, however, the film's plot was just too mediocre, and doesn't come across as anything profound.",3,"Saffron Burrows does commendable job, but film...eh.....",1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2223,"['Guitar', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'message', 'projected', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'confusing', 'producers', 'seemingly', 'want', 'viewers', 'feel', 'need', 'live', 'little', 'change', 'whole', 'perception', 'life', 'especially', 'seemingly', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'how', 'arrive', 'faulty', 'Melody', 'Wilder', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'told', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'only', 'about', 'two', 'months', 'live', 'transformation', 'sorts', 'main', 'question', 'have', 'who', 'was', 'pivotal', 'point', 'Guitar', 'Mel', 'doctor', 'questions', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'change', 'Mel', 'response', 'Everything', 'However', 'can', 'sense', 'guess', 'who', 'was', 'transformation', 'side', 'never', 'really', 'depicted', 'rather', 'implied', 'viewing', 'film', 'question', 'be', 'begged', 'was', 'was', 'better', 'person', 'getting', 'news', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'what', 'values', 'reaffirming', 'attributes', 'can', 'one', 'place', 'sleeping', 'around', 'married', 'people', 'spending', 'money', 'maxing', 'out', 'credit', 'cards', 'recklessly', 'furniture', 'clothes', 'other', 'material', 'items', 'precisely', 'what', 'Mel', 'being', 'told', 'two', 'months', 'live', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'started.Sure', 'vision', 'flashback', 'guitar', 'movie', 'title', 'implies', 'important', 'change', 'guitar', 'might', 'be', 'symbol', 'change', 'goal', 'had', 'child', 'living', 'life', 'are', 'ultimately', 'beaten', 'over', 'head', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'Melanie', 'Wilder', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'guitar', 'window', 'once', 'twice', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'guitar', 'play', 'become', 'more', 'confident', 'spiritual', 'person', 'who', 'one', 'plus', 'establishing', 'character', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spending', 'spree', 'sex', 'were', 'enough', 'build', 'much', 'story.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'excellent', 'job', 'being', 'Melody', 'Wilder', 'bring', 'solitary', 'reflective', 'atmosphere', 'role', 'was', 'right', 'person', 'role.In', 'end', 'however', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'mediocre', ""n't"", 'come', 'anything', 'profound']","Guitar, The"

Diagnosed with cancer, fired, and dumped by her spineless, pansy of a boyfriend, her life is in chaos.  After a short bout with depression about her predicament, most notably the two months she has been given to live, Mel decides to go crazy and flip her life upside down.  Eschewing her possessions, it becomes a race against time as she rents a pricy loft downtown and begins a quest to max out every credit card she has with ridiculously pricy and ostentatious purchases - essentially a bucket list for women.Along the way Mel experiments with food, life, sexuality, and most importantly music.  Interspersed with dream-life flashbacks of a young Mel nearly drooling at the site of a red guitar in the window of a music store below her family's apartment, the plot moves toward an association between her spiritual awakening through music.  As she nears her presumed end, it's the music that she savors the most; it's the music and the guitar that she holds on to the longest.The acting from Wilder is superb.  Considering the fact that she carries nearly the entire movie, her troubled expressions and quivering voice exude sorrow.  When the purchases begin, however, her mood begins to change, and her metamorphosis begins.  The concept is also interesting; told from the perspective of someone who is literally dying, it's difficult to comprehend what one would do (tip: Stay far away from me if I'm in this situation.  The results will be more like a horror movie than a drama.)  The biggest problem with the movie is its slow pacing.  It's unbearably boring at times, with extended scenes of Wilder just reading off credit card numbers while on a banana-shaped phone.  As she orders from catalog after catalog, it ends up being a QVC addict's wet dream.  The supporting actors are average at best, if not a bit amateur.  Aside from the incessant shopping spree and the supporting acting, however, is the problem with the lackluster ending.  It's an incomplete resolution or final outcome, and we're shown neither her understanding of the life changing metamorphosis, nor of her true rebirth/second chance at life.Some will love this movie, and I can understand that completely.

1212900,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B001L28J2M,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 1]","""The Guitar"" is a great debut from director Amy Redford.  It stars the beautiful, sensual Saffron Burrows (""Troy"" and ""The Bank Job"") as Melody ""Mel"" Wilder.  Mel is having one of the worst days of her life.  She is diagnosed with inoperable laryngeal cancer, loses her office job, and is kicked to the curb by her flaky boyfriend.  How would you react upon learning you only have two months to live?  Mel completely abandons her old life by moving into an expensive, high rise loft, literally throwing all her clothes out the window, and ordering fashionable clothes and furnishings.  Having lost her boyfriend, she explores sexual relationships that were once viewed as forbidden.  Most importantly, she buys that sleek, red electric guitar that she has always dreamed of possessing ever since she was a little girl.Expecting ""The Guitar"" to be very dark and depressing, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was very emotionally uplifting.  Thanks to the guitar and its music, Mel goes through a wonderful transformation.  In the face of death, she regains her freedom.  She goes from being an uptight office worker in a small cubicle to a musician playing on stage in front of cheering audiences.  ""The Guitar"" gives me hope.  As long as we are alive, there is always hope that tomorrow will be better.Saffron Burrows gives a wonderfully believable performance as the dying Mel.  Isaach de Bankole (""Casino Royale"" and ""The Skeleton Key"") is the black, muscle bound postal delivery man, Roscoe Wasz; Paz De La Huerta (""Choke"" and ""Neal Cassady"") is the cute and sassy pizza delivery girl, Constance ""Cookie"" Clemente.  (Huerta has the most gorgeous lips I have ever seen; they remind me of Kim Bassinger`s).  Roscoe and Cookie are the forbidden fruit that Mel enjoys in some erotic scenes.  Janeane Garofalo (""The Truth about Cats and Dogs"") is Dr. Murray who diagnosed Mel with the laryngeal cancer.""The Guitar"" is recommended viewing for anyone who loves serious dramas that are highly emotional.  This one will make you shed some tears.  It is highly provocative.  After the film is over, you will keep asking yourself, ""What would I do If I was diagnosed with a terminal illness?""  It happens to many people every day.As always, Anchor Bay Entertainment has delivered a superb DVD package for ""The Guitar.""  It has audio commentary from director Amy Redford and a theatrical trailer.  It is also presented in its theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.

The plot unfolds rather quickly and comes to a neat, almost cliched ending.  I thought the acting was really good and the character likable, but the film seemed self-indulgent at times... long moody ambient guitar score pieces and the main character just hanging around her loft nude for a long while before ordering new furniture and clothes.

The central character goes through a transformation when confronting her mortality that anyone who's open to the experience will find incredibly absorbing.  Don't be put off by the talk of going on a spending spree - that is NOT what the film is actually about (its not a validation of wanton materialism) - the buying of material objects is just part of a process that the character, Melody, needs to go through in order to discover what's important. For any connoisseur of the beautiful, talented Saffron Burrows this film is a wonderful gift.  She delivers a deeply felt and brilliant performance that dominates the screen in almost every scene. Its hard to imagine anyone else being able to animate this challenging role the way Ms Burrows has - she performs magic.  There are whole scenes where she is alone on the screen and has no dialogue and sometimes not even any clothes. Its quite primal. Later she explores her sexuality and discovers more of what she's been missing and has a lot of fun, too.  I don't want to give too much away but I will state that the film is much like a parable and has an ending that might startle some - either positively or negatively.

1212904,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B001L28J2M,JO,"[1, 2]","I watched two DVD's yesterday, ""The Guitar,"" directed by New York's Amy Redford, and ""Das Fraulein,"" directed by Swiss filmmaker Andrea Staka, both whose themes deal with a young woman's remaining weeks living with a terminal disease.  In my opinion, the only redeeming qualities of ""The Guitar"" are Bobby Bukowski's incredible skill as Director of Photography and Saffron Burrows, the only ""great"" actor in the film.  Janeane Garofalo's role was very small but appeared as the only other actor who could really deliver a believable performance in a script that might have been better developed with another director at the helm.During the first few minutes, I wondered how I would continue to watch the entire film.  Promising a review, I persisted and not only watched the film, but watched it a second time while listening to the Director's Commentary.  I really tried to abstain from harsh judgement, but it occurred to me that without Bukowski and Burrows, this film would have rated not even a single star from this viewer/reviewer.  By listening to Redford, I realized that she depended upon them to create this otherwise below average film.  She talked about certain deliberate intentions which were totally lost in translation for me and I suspect that I'm not the only one who slapped my forehead at something she considered obvious to which I was oblivious.  For example, as she discussed the ""lack of warm colors"" in an early loft scene, I found myself thinking that brown is a warm color, albeit not as warm as bright yellow or orange.I appreciate that Sundance offers up and coming filmmakers an opportunity to showcase their creations but can't help but wonder if Redford benefitted from nepotism rather than her skill as a director.  I have watched many, many independent films over three decades and don't consider this film as outstanding in any regard.  According to Redford, this was produced on a small budget with a plethora of New York's ""great"" actors (according to Redford's commentary), but I found them each to be unbelievable and some rather laughable.  Perhaps they were overshadowed by Burrows' exciting portrayal of Melody and the obviously more experienced and creative Bukowski.  In any case, the story is interesting even with its predictable outcome, but I would recommend ""Das Fraulein,"" should you be interested in watching a single film about how a young woman approaches life when faced with her own mortality.",3,Bukowski and Burrows Saved The Guitar,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,2449,"['watched', 'two', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'Guitar', 'directed', 'New', 'York', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'Das', 'Fraulein', 'directed', 'Swiss', 'filmmaker', 'Andrea', 'Staka', 'themes', 'deal', 'young', 'woman', 'remaining', 'weeks', 'living', 'terminal', 'disease', 'opinion', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Guitar', 'are', 'Bobby', 'Bukowski', 'incredible', 'skill', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'only', 'great', 'actor', 'film', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'appeared', 'only', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'deliver', 'believable', 'performance', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'director', 'helm.During', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'continue', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'Promising', 'review', 'persisted', 'not', 'only', 'watched', 'film', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'listening', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'really', 'tried', 'abstain', 'harsh', 'judgement', 'occurred', 'Bukowski', 'Burrows', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'not', 'even', 'single', 'star', 'viewer/reviewer', 'listening', 'Redford', 'realized', 'depended', 'upon', 'create', 'otherwise', 'below', 'average', 'film', 'talked', 'about', 'certain', 'deliberate', 'intentions', 'were', 'totally', 'lost', 'translation', 'suspect', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'slapped', 'forehead', 'something', 'considered', 'obvious', 'was', 'oblivious', 'example', 'discussed', 'lack', 'warm', 'colors', 'early', 'loft', 'scene', 'found', 'thinking', 'brown', 'warm', 'color', 'albeit', 'not', 'as', 'warm', 'bright', 'yellow', 'orange.I', 'appreciate', 'Sundance', 'up', 'coming', 'filmmakers', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'creations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Redford', 'benefitted', 'nepotism', 'rather', 'skill', 'director', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'independent', 'films', 'three', 'decades', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'outstanding', 'regard', 'According', 'Redford', 'was', 'produced', 'small', 'budget', 'plethora', 'New', 'York', 'great', 'actors', 'according', 'Redford', 'commentary', 'found', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'rather', 'laughable', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'Burrows', 'exciting', 'portrayal', 'Melody', 'obviously', 'more', 'experienced', 'creative', 'Bukowski', 'case', 'story', 'interesting', 'even', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'would', 'recommend', 'Das', 'Fraulein', 'should', 'be', 'interested', 'watching', 'single', 'film', 'how', 'young', 'woman', 'life', 'when', 'faced', 'own', 'mortality']","Guitar, The"

My husband and I also really enjoy Saffron Burrows, who is the star of this film.  Sadly, the emperor is buck nekkid.THE GUITAR  begins with Janine Garafalo telling Saffron Burrows (Melody) that she has throat cancer and will die in just a few weeks. Minutes later, Melody is fired and minutes after that, her boyfriend tells her he needs to explore his inner child. So Melody leaves her apartment forever, door open, keys on the floor, and rents a huge NYC penthouse loft. She proceeds to fill it with everything she could never afford but that her multitudinous credit cards allow her to have. And so we discover the source of the credit crunch! A good 15 minutes or so are all about her being naked after having thrown her clothes (and trash) out the window. She orders everything under the sun (except clothes) and when it arrives, she's still naked. Still naked when the pizza gets there. Don't worry; she ends up having sex with the married delivery man and the teenage pizza delivery girl. And then she has sex with them together.You could argue that all her sociopathic acts were just her going crazy with the knowledge of her upcoming demise, but the movie didn't really even hint at that. She was coldly calculating about it all.THE GUITAR movie has every, and I do mean every, clich&eacute; you can imagine if you've ever watch Lifetime Television. I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next, and I had to laugh each time I was right, no more so than we get to the ""surprise"" ending that I predicted exactly six minutes into the show. That is seldom a recommendation for a film.What are we to take from this movie? That when we're about to die, all bets are off? Melody even forgoes her vegetarianism and starts ordering meat-lovers pizza.  I suppose we're meant to see how liberating her impending death is, how it frees her from societal constraints such as actually paying for what you buy, not having sex with minors, not having adulterous affairs, and being true to your own beliefs.  Is this meant to uplift us? To help us cope with our own impending deaths? Ack! I hope not!But I'm forgetting something. THE GUITAR. That *is* the name of the movie, after all. We get flashbacks of Melody as a child, with her nose pressed against the glass of a music shop, dreaming about a Red-Ryder B-B gun - er, I mean a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Melody dreams about it every night, but it takes her until about 30 minutes into the film to actually buy one. As with everything else, she has no intention of paying for it. Eventually, she teaches herself to play and ... I can't tell you what happens after that. I can't even tell you what the director, Robert Redford's daughter, says is the point of the movie. That would ruin the ""surprise"" ending.There is a shadow of a descent movie here, and Saffron Burrows does her best with the material she has. If they had actually concentrated on the guitar, and Melody's learning how to play it, *that* would have been interesting. It could have achieved the director's stated goal. But alas, that was not to be.If you actually like movies on Lifetime, then you might really like THE GUITAR. Unfortunately, I'm one who has blocked Lifetime from my on-screen program guide.

From the synopsis on the case, you would think it's your typical tear jerker. And, in some ways, it is a very touching, tear provoking journey. But that's just on the surface.The main character finds out at the beginning of the movie that her life is to end within a month. Later that same day her love interest dumps her without letting her disclose her situation. She then loses her job.These events lead her to become extravagant and hedonistic, figuring her time is limited. She rents a penthouse, runs up her charge cards and meets two very different people who she becomes intimate with.There are no limits at this point in her life, so she accepts what affection comes her way. She also pursues her childhood dream of getting an electric guitar and learning to play. She drops everything known to her and pursues a completely different life.Time moves on and she then loses these two people for different reasons. She suddenly realizes that she has outlived her life expectancy and checks in with the doctor again. To everyone's suprise, she is suddenly free of the cancer that threatened to kill her.Not only that, she is also suddenly homeless and penniless and friendless. In time, she brings her guitar dream to a reality.That is the plot. How it's played out on screen is nothing short of amazing.First, all acting is superb and instantly believeable. Sets, costumes, music, filming are all peak and draw you into this story like you wouldn't believe.What impressed me most was how provocative this is in bringing about the question of 'What would you do if you knew your time was limited?'. Then it takes a sharp about face and dares you to live your dream as if you were dying.... but allows you to live.Quite an impact. Truly questions to behold. It brings to screen the thought of living as though you were dying. Pursue your dreams and make them a reality. And finally, life can throw you numerous curves when you least expect.If I could, I would give this movie 10 stars. Highly recommended to everyone as everything displayed here is an excellent life lesson.But it, keep it, enjoy it. When the world is cold and unforgiving, pull this movie out and watch it again.

Poor Mel Wilder (Saffron Burrow) has one of the worst days of her life when she finds out that has terminal cancer, loses her job and is dumped by her boyfriend.  She goes into a deep state of depression but eventually decides to live out her final two months of life in lavish excellence.  This sounds like a great beginning to a wonderful story.  Instead, it's nothing more than the highlight of a hum-drum film.Mel rents a fancy penthouse, maxes out her credit cards on all sorts of things including fine bedding, gourmet take-out and beautiful clothes.  She also seeks out a red Fender Strat that she's wanted ever since she was a child.  She even goes so far as to fulfill her carnal fantasies, utilizing a delivery man (Issac De Bankole) and a pizza delivery girl (Paz De La Huerta) to achieve her goals.Eventually, a twist is thrown into Mel's life that makes you think that the story is going to get better.  Unfortunately for Mel (and director Amy Redford), the story remains as bland and uneventful as it is from the beginning.Despite giving a decent performance, Saffron Burrows failed to captivate me as Mel.  In fact, the character wasn't that likeable at all.  I really couldn't care less about what happens to her in the end.  Issac De Bankole and Paz De La Huerta are solid in their supporting roles, but don't have enough to work with to really stand out from this dull film.So why three stars?  There are a few highlights in this film.  The beginning is very good, and the relationships that Mel forms in her final days are interesting, but never really fleshed out.  There's also quite a few steamy scenes in this film that I'm sure many viewers will enjoy.  This is basically what saves this film from being a complete waste of time.Arthouse fans will probably eat this up, thinking that they see something in this film that the average viewer can't grasp.  Call me average, but I just don't see any reason to purchase this film.

Saffron Burrows who was great inCircle of Friendsand had her first role in ""In the Name of the Father,"" does her best to stay afloat in the film.  She's particularly interesting as a guitarist thundering next to a wall of amps.  Her character Melody Wilder has about the worst day possible when Dr. Murray played by Janeane Garofalo tells her she has a very short time to live.  She walks out of her apartment with the shirt on her back and rents a lush penthouse.  Running up huge amounts of credit card debt she believes she will die before having to pay back, she begins an affair with the delivery man Roscoe played by Isaach de Bankole.  From the Ivory Coast, de Bankole has starred in the greatGhost Dog - The Way of the Samuraiwith Forrest Whitaker and in ""Casino Royale,"" the James Bond film.  Roscoe's relationship to Melody is one of desire and tenderness.  However, he is married.  Melody also has a relationship with Cookie, the pizza delivery woman.  Cookie is played by Paz de la Herta who was in the filmFierce People.  When Roscoe walks in on the two girls making love, he reacts with a smile and joins them.  Amy Redford directed this for her first feature; and actually does fairly well with it.  My problem is that the material was depressing, the character reacted by drenching herself in opulence with credit card fraud and then has casual sex on top of it.  I found myself continually turning off the film and then forcing myself to sit through another five or ten minutes of it.

Your boss then adds to your good news by firing you.  On top of everything else, what would you do if your boyfriend dumped you?  Melody Wilder, played by Saffron Burrows, initially considers suicide, but she moves past that thought to a completely different thought when she sees an advertisement for a loft apartment.Melody decides to spend her last month living like there is no tomorrow, because for her there would be no tomorrow.  The loft she rents with her severance check is in an empty building, so she has no neighbors to annoy with her new, carefree lifestyle.  What is disturbing is the amount of credit she uses, abuses rather, and as the movie progressed, I wondered how much time was passing because credit card companies will eventually catch up with you, though they are sometimes slow initially.However, this movie is a fantasy and some things you need to ignore to get to the point.Melody keeps having flashbacks to a childhood experience.  She stole a beautiful red Fender guitar, and got into serious trouble because of it.  Melody buys another Fender guitar and learns how to play it.  She also meets some interesting people and has relationships that recall the 1960's.  Even the people she meets are partially a distraction, but even they lead to the point.***Plot spoiler***You have to wonder what the point of this movie is.  There have been other movies made about a dying person living it up, often as a comedy.  Their point was different from this movie (at, least, the ones I have watched have a different point).  What was the point?  Melody's life went off track when she was a little girl.  Stealing the guitar appears to have been a defining moment that changed her life, for the worse.  Was she meant to get a guitar and keep it?  The movie seems to imply that either the act of stealing the guitar or having the guitar taken away put her on a different path than she was supposed to take.  The single act of buying the Fender guitar seems to have been a defining moment that realigned her life.What critics of this movie seem to focus on are things that appear to be implausible.  How did Melody get a bunch of high-limit credit cards?  Were her doctors incompetent?  There are other questions along these lines.  Some of the answers are easy.  As I noted, her building was empty since the owner was selling it, so no neighbors to annoy.  The credit card question is the hardest.  As for spontaneous remission of cancer, there are documented cases.  Sometimes the remission happens in a very short time.  However, all of these criticisms are ignoring the fantasy, which is the real point of the movie.  Are these same people overly critical of ""Peter Pan"" because there are no such things as fairies and how would it be possible they could fly?I also saw some snide remarks regarding nudity, remarks that totally ignored the re-birth symbolism.  Yes, Saffron Burrows is an attractive young woman, as is Paz de la Huerta.  If all you saw was two naked women, you should not be watching movies like ""The Guitar.""  Please, go back to Disney movies or daytime soap operas or whatever floats your boat.  The point of the nudity was initially a rebirth of Melody into a completely new person.  Later, the nudity is representative of her freedom, which the director fully realized by the end of the movie.I enjoyed ""The Guitar"" because it subtly asks who we are and whether we are doing what we ""should"" or could be doing.  Sure, the movie is a fantasy, but for me, it was an enjoyable fantasy.

1212914,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,B001L28J2M,"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike""","[3, 4]","If you haven't already noticed, the reviews for The Guitar are all over the map.  Clearly this isn't a movie for everyone, and I confess that at about 40 minutes into the film I was wondering if it was even for me.  But two days after watching it, I'm still haunted by Saffron Burrows' performance and the incredibly subtle way the story unfolds.Melody Wilder (Burrows) experiences what has to be trifecta of life altering events, all within one morning.  First her doctor (played by Janeane Garofalo) informs her that her ""feeling crappy"" is due to laryngeal cancer, and that she has at best two months to live.  Next, she dazedly reports to her job in a Dilbertarian cubicle silo only to discover that she's being laid off.  Turning to her boyfriend for support, he informs her that they need to break up as he feels ""smothered.""  You can be excused for thinking at this point that you're in for yet another free spending ""max out the credit cards spending spree"" kind of story.  Okay... well that's ""kind"" of what happens, but somehow things progress differently from most ""I may as well enjoy my final days"" thrill rides.Mel leaves her basement apartment (and everything in it) for a huge loft bereft of anything other than a basic kitchen and chucks what little she has out the window.  At this point, a conventional cineplex movie would feature a scene of gratuitous nudity with an overbearing musical score as Mel moves/dances her way through the cavernous empty space.  But to the disappointment of adolescent males everywhere, it's nothing like that.  Naked Mel basically retreats into a fetal position (all the more odd given the overall size of the loft) and just waits.  Reality sets in with the appearance of the phone installer who she allows in thanks to a quick transformation of some window coverings into a full length wrap.From there, Mel basically coexists with the world outside the loft through her new banana-shaped phone, ordering food and furnishings (through the largess of her apparently high credit card limits).  The crown jewel of these purchases is a red Stratocaster electric guitar, similar to the one she had desired as a young girl.  While learning to play the guitar through a DVD, she begins to connect with two individuals, Roscoe (the parcel delivery man) and Cookie (the pizza pie deliverer).  From there, the only remaining part of this minimalist plot that I will share is that the obvious max-out day of reckoning will occur for Mel.  Yet there will be a surprise or two.The plot line is minimal, yet the character development is fascinating to watch thanks to Ms. Burrows (who won't remind you at all of the predatory beauty that she played on Boston Legal).  If my description thus far hasn't given you a clue, just take note.  If your tastes in movies include blazing gun play, explosions, fart jokes and pratfalls... do not... under any circumstances buy/rent/watch The Guitar!But if you have patience, and appreciate a nominal story line with a subtle performance, I highly recommend this.  The Guitar worthy of its Sundance Film Festival status... irrespective of the fact that Amy Redford (you know who's daughter) is the director.",4,"Complicated and Unique, but Recommended",1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,3181,"['have', ""n't"", 'already', 'noticed', 'reviews', 'Guitar', 'are', 'map', 'Clearly', ""n't"", 'movie', 'everyone', 'confess', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'even', 'two', 'days', 'watching', ""'m"", 'still', 'haunted', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'performance', 'incredibly', 'subtle', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds.Melody', 'Wilder', 'Burrows', 'be', 'trifecta', 'life', 'altering', 'events', 'one', 'morning', 'First', 'doctor', 'played', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'feeling', 'crappy', 'due', 'laryngeal', 'cancer', 'best', 'two', 'months', 'live', 'Next', 'dazedly', 'job', 'Dilbertarian', 'cubicle', 'only', 'discover', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'Turning', 'boyfriend', 'support', 'need', 'break', 'up', 'smothered', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'thinking', 'point', ""'re"", 'yet', 'free', 'spending', 'out', 'credit', 'cards', 'spending', 'spree', 'kind', 'story', 'Okay', 'well', 'kind', 'what', 'somehow', 'things', 'progress', 'differently', 'most', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'enjoy', 'final', 'days', 'thrill', 'rides.Mel', 'basement', 'apartment', 'everything', 'huge', 'loft', 'bereft', 'anything', 'other', 'basic', 'kitchen', 'chucks', 'what', 'little', 'out', 'window', 'point', 'conventional', 'cineplex', 'movie', 'would', 'feature', 'scene', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'overbearing', 'musical', 'score', 'Mel', 'way', 'cavernous', 'empty', 'space', 'disappointment', 'adolescent', 'males', 'everywhere', 'nothing', 'Naked', 'Mel', 'basically', 'fetal', 'position', 'more', 'odd', 'given', 'overall', 'size', 'loft', 'just', 'waits', 'Reality', 'appearance', 'phone', 'installer', 'who', 'thanks', 'quick', 'transformation', 'window', 'coverings', 'full', 'length', 'there', 'Mel', 'basically', 'world', 'loft', 'new', 'banana-shaped', 'phone', 'ordering', 'food', 'furnishings', 'largess', 'apparently', 'high', 'credit', 'card', 'limits', 'crown', 'jewel', 'purchases', 'red', 'Stratocaster', 'electric', 'guitar', 'similar', 'one', 'had', 'desired', 'young', 'girl', 'learning', 'play', 'guitar', 'DVD', 'connect', 'two', 'individuals', 'Roscoe', 'parcel', 'delivery', 'man', 'Cookie', 'pizza', 'pie', 'deliverer', 'there', 'only', 'remaining', 'part', 'minimalist', 'plot', 'will', 'share', 'obvious', 'max-out', 'day', 'reckoning', 'will', 'occur', 'Mel', 'will', 'be', 'surprise', 'two.The', 'plot', 'line', 'minimal', 'yet', 'character', 'development', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'thanks', 'Ms.', 'Burrows', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remind', 'predatory', 'beauty', 'played', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'description', 'thus', 'far', ""n't"", 'given', 'clue', 'just', 'take', 'note', 'tastes', 'movies', 'include', 'blazing', 'gun', 'play', 'explosions', 'fart', 'jokes', 'pratfalls', 'do', 'not', 'circumstances', 'buy/rent/watch', 'Guitar', 'have', 'patience', 'appreciate', 'nominal', 'story', 'line', 'subtle', 'performance', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Guitar', 'worthy', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'status', 'irrespective', 'fact', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'know', 'who', 'daughter', 'director']","Guitar, The"

1212916,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B001L28J2M,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","9-6-11 - 4.0 - ""The Guitar"" (2008) - The film opens with a 30 something woman getting some bad news from her doctor (Janeane Garofalo) that she has throat cancer and has one or two months to live.  The doc tells Mel (short for Melody not Melanie as tells people) to go home, get her affairs in order and come back the next day.  Yeah right, take a day and get your affairs in order!  So then Mel goes to her job.  She works in an office in NYC and upon arrival everybody gives her the old back-of-the head stare alerting us that something is up.  She, in fact gets fired or ""downsized"" as her boss tells her in the middle of the office with everyone looking.  Yeah right.  Then she calls her boyfriend on a pay phone (doesn't like cell phones) and arranges a meeting to tell him about her plight.  But before she can get it out, he breaks up with her.  Yeah right.  As you might surmise, I was very put off by this very unreal opening.  Then things get better.  A lot better.  Mel is played by Saffron Burrows who I mostly remember from TV's ""Boston Legal"" and ""The Bank Job."" She gives a strong quietly emotional performance which includes adapting an American accent.  Her initial portrayal of sadness fades quickly into a self realization that she has a short time to live and wants to make the most of it.  We don't know how much money she has but we assume not a lot, but she has a lot of credit cards with some huge credit limits.  She rents out a vacant penthouse loft on a short term lease.  She has nothing with her but the clothes on her back, which she tosses out the window.  She then gets on her brand new complimentary banana phone and starts ordering.  And now I'm really paying attention.  For multiple reasons.  She orders nothing but the best.  Bedding, furniture, vases, lamps, etc.  In one scene she comes out of the shower and realizes she has no towels.  After drying herself off with napkins and paper towels she calls Bed, Bath and Beyond and orders a dozen of their best towels in white and another dozen in silver.  Cracked me up!It is clear that Mel has no family or even close friends, so she strikes up a conversation with the delivery man, an African with a hint of French accent.  After a while, their relationship becomes physical.  There is also a pizza delivery girl who gets close to Mel...real close.  Then all three become entwined.  It is if Mel saw these as cultural taboos and with time becoming short wanted to experience it all.  Mel never leaves the apartment and after a series of childhood recollections of her mooning over an electric guitar, she buys one.  Not just the guitar but several giant amps, reverbs and all the accoutrements that a wannabe rocker would need.  She learns the basics using an instructional video and progressively improves.  When Mel's credit cards begin to max out she realizes she's still alive.  Her voice hasn't gotten worse.  In fact, it's better.  Her doctors are amazed when she returns for tests.  The cancer is gone.  Evidently all this change in her life has dissuaded the cancer cells to hang around.  Yeah right.  The ending is a little too tidy, but I certainly liked it.  This movie is not the depression charged melodrama I was expecting after the first 10 minutes but an uplifting, if calculated trip of fantasy.  Perhaps that was the intent of director Amy Redford.  That is, a fairy tale.  In any case in spite of some writing lapses, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",4,"Despite some writing lapses, an ultimately uplifting film",1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,3449,"['9-6-11', '4.0', 'Guitar', '2008', 'film', '30', 'something', 'woman', 'getting', 'bad', 'news', 'doctor', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'throat', 'cancer', 'one', 'two', 'months', 'live', 'doc', 'Mel', 'short', 'Melody', 'not', 'Melanie', 'tells', 'people', 'go', 'home', 'get', 'affairs', 'order', 'come', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'Yeah', 'right', 'take', 'day', 'get', 'affairs', 'order', 'So', 'then', 'Mel', 'job', 'office', 'NYC', 'arrival', 'everybody', 'old', 'back-of-the', 'head', 'stare', 'alerting', 'something', 'up', 'fact', 'fired', 'downsized', 'boss', 'middle', 'office', 'everyone', 'looking', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Then', 'boyfriend', 'pay', 'phone', ""n't"", 'like', 'cell', 'phones', 'meeting', 'tell', 'plight', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'up', 'Yeah', 'right', 'might', 'surmise', 'was', 'very', 'put', 'off', 'very', 'unreal', 'opening', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'better', 'lot', 'better', 'Mel', 'played', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'who', 'mostly', 'remember', 'TV', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Bank', 'Job', 'strong', 'quietly', 'emotional', 'performance', 'adapting', 'American', 'accent', 'initial', 'portrayal', 'sadness', 'fades', 'quickly', 'self', 'realization', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'make', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'assume', 'not', 'lot', 'lot', 'credit', 'cards', 'huge', 'credit', 'limits', 'out', 'vacant', 'penthouse', 'loft', 'short', 'term', 'lease', 'nothing', 'clothes', 'back', 'out', 'window', 'then', 'brand', 'new', 'complimentary', 'banana', 'phone', 'ordering', 'now', ""'m"", 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'orders', 'nothing', 'best', 'Bedding', 'furniture', 'vases', 'lamps', 'etc', 'one', 'scene', 'shower', 'towels', 'drying', 'off', 'napkins', 'paper', 'towels', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'orders', 'dozen', 'best', 'towels', 'white', 'dozen', 'silver', 'Cracked', 'clear', 'Mel', 'family', 'even', 'close', 'friends', 'up', 'conversation', 'delivery', 'man', 'African', 'hint', 'French', 'accent', 'while', 'relationship', 'physical', 'also', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'girl', 'who', 'close', 'Mel', 'real', 'close', 'Then', 'three', 'become', 'entwined', 'Mel', 'saw', 'cultural', 'taboos', 'time', 'becoming', 'short', 'wanted', 'experience', 'Mel', 'never', 'apartment', 'series', 'childhood', 'recollections', 'mooning', 'electric', 'guitar', 'one', 'Not', 'just', 'guitar', 'several', 'giant', 'amps', 'reverbs', 'accoutrements', 'wannabe', 'rocker', 'would', 'need', 'basics', 'using', 'instructional', 'video', 'progressively', 'improves', 'When', 'Mel', 'credit', 'cards', 'begin', 'max', 'out', 'still', 'alive', 'voice', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'worse', 'fact', 'better', 'doctors', 'are', 'amazed', 'when', 'tests', 'cancer', 'gone', 'Evidently', 'change', 'life', 'dissuaded', 'cancer', 'cells', 'hang', 'around', 'Yeah', 'right', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'tidy', 'certainly', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'depression', 'charged', 'melodrama', 'was', 'expecting', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'uplifting', 'calculated', 'trip', 'fantasy', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intent', 'director', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'fairy', 'tale', 'case', 'spite', 'writing', 'lapses', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed']","Guitar, The"

However, throughout the movie, I just don't feel I got to know her or care about her. Her character did many things, but I didn't feel that I understood her very well, and the other characters were even less memorable to me. Burrows was very expressive, but there just didn't seem like there was enough for her to work with. There weren't many characters, so the few that were there should have served a greater purpose. Some even slipped into slight cliche-type plot development. When I watch a movie like this, I feel like I want to relate to the protagonist character, understand her.

Her whole life basically collapses before her eyes as not only does she find out she has only a couple months to live, She also loses her boyfriend and her job as well and all in the same day. My biggest problem with this film lies in the fact that it basically winds up being a film more about consumerism than a film about a woman confronting the final months of her unsatisfied life.Once she finds out she is dying Melody leaves her crappy apartment and rents a really large and beautiful penthouse. The rest of the film basically takes place in this penthouse as she basically locks herself in and spends the next 2 months charging up her credit cards by buying things for herself and her penthouse. She starts out by buying the most expensive bed that she can find and from there moves on to expensive furniture, clothes, lamps, vases, food and pretty much everything in between. Her final purchase ends up being a guitar and a huge amp setup with which to play it on.Its just incredibly sad and extremely bothersome to me that this woman spends her final 2 months basically being a consumer. The really sad part about this is I actually think there are a lot of people out there that would do the exact same thing. Society has become so consumerist in nature that I really think that what this woman did would be some people's dying wish. Out of all of the things someone could devote their final months of life to, shopping has to be the absolute saddest choice possible. She could have traveled the world, learned to scuba dive, taken a safari, seen the Sistine chapel, sailed the Caribbean, hiked a glacier in Alaska, taken a cruise to the antarctic, or done whatever other things she wanted to do but never got the chance. To choose to lock yourself up in a Penthouse and shop till you drop is just an incredibly sad way to spend your final months and again it really speaks to the role that consumerism plays in society these days. Some people care more about buying items than truly experiencing life.Its not a bad film, in fact I actually enjoyed it. I was just really bothered by the message that this film puts out there. Then again as I said before there are probably a lot of people out there that would do just this sort of thing if something like this happened to them so maybe it makes this film even that much more realistic. She did learn how to play the guitar, which was something she was interested in as a child, so she did fulfill at least one of her dreams. Its still wasn't enough to make it offset the fact that she had basically just wasted the final 2 months of her life shopping.I am not sure if this film was purposely making some kind of statement regarding consumerism or not. I would like to hear from the writer and director regarding their thoughts on this matter. Either way its definitely the prevailing message in this film. I personally despise the level of consumerism we see these days so maybe I am a bit biased however I really cant think of too many people who would not find this woman's decision on how to liver her final months incredibly sad. Our lives are short enough even when we aren't diagnosed with a terminal disease early in life and there are just too many things to do, too many places to see and too many experiences to have to waste our final months shopping.Dont get me wrong, again I actually enjoyed this film and I think that a lot of other people will as well. It is a good film with a great performance by Saffron Burrows. Who knows, maybe this film will ultimately show a lot of people just how unimportant all of the crap we have in our daily lives really is after all, the only purchase that she made that really meant anything was the Guitar as that was more about fulfilling a lifelong wish than it was about just aimlessly buying something. Actually the more I think about it the more I realize that we actually need films like these as they take a very serious issue and put it out there for people to see, confront, and ultimately to discuss. And that is never a bad thing.4 Stars",4,A Great Film with a Somewhat Troubling Message!,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,4187,"['**Spoiler', 'Warning**The', 'Guitar', 'basically', 'film', 'Melody', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'inoperable', 'tumor', 'throat', 'whole', 'life', 'basically', 'eyes', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'couple', 'months', 'live', 'also', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'well', 'same', 'day', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'fact', 'basically', 'up', 'being', 'film', 'more', 'consumerism', 'film', 'woman', 'confronting', 'final', 'months', 'unsatisfied', 'life.Once', 'dying', 'Melody', 'crappy', 'apartment', 'really', 'large', 'beautiful', 'penthouse', 'rest', 'film', 'basically', 'place', 'penthouse', 'basically', 'next', '2', 'months', 'charging', 'up', 'credit', 'cards', 'buying', 'things', 'herself', 'penthouse', 'out', 'buying', 'most', 'expensive', 'bed', 'can', 'find', 'moves', 'expensive', 'furniture', 'clothes', 'lamps', 'vases', 'food', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'final', 'purchase', 'up', 'being', 'guitar', 'huge', 'amp', 'setup', 'play', 'on.Its', 'just', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'extremely', 'bothersome', 'woman', 'final', '2', 'months', 'basically', 'being', 'consumer', 'really', 'sad', 'part', 'actually', 'think', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'Society', 'become', 'so', 'consumerist', 'nature', 'really', 'think', 'what', 'woman', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'dying', 'wish', 'things', 'someone', 'could', 'devote', 'final', 'months', 'life', 'shopping', 'be', 'absolute', 'saddest', 'choice', 'possible', 'could', 'have', 'traveled', 'world', 'learned', 'scuba', 'dive', 'taken', 'safari', 'seen', 'Sistine', 'chapel', 'sailed', 'Caribbean', 'hiked', 'glacier', 'Alaska', 'taken', 'cruise', 'antarctic', 'done', 'other', 'things', 'wanted', 'do', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'choose', 'lock', 'up', 'Penthouse', 'shop', 'till', 'drop', 'just', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'way', 'spend', 'final', 'months', 'again', 'really', 'role', 'consumerism', 'plays', 'society', 'days', 'people', 'care', 'more', 'buying', 'items', 'truly', 'experiencing', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'fact', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'bothered', 'message', 'film', 'out', 'there', 'Then', 'again', 'said', 'are', 'probably', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'sort', 'thing', 'something', 'happened', 'so', 'maybe', 'film', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'did', 'learn', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'interested', 'child', 'did', 'fulfill', 'least', 'one', 'dreams', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'offset', 'fact', 'had', 'basically', 'just', 'wasted', 'final', '2', 'months', 'life', 'shopping.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'was', 'purposely', 'making', 'kind', 'statement', 'regarding', 'consumerism', 'not', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'writer', 'director', 'regarding', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'way', 'definitely', 'prevailing', 'message', 'film', 'personally', 'despise', 'level', 'consumerism', 'see', 'days', 'so', 'maybe', 'am', 'bit', 'biased', 'however', 'really', 'cant', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'woman', 'decision', 'how', 'liver', 'final', 'months', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'lives', 'are', 'short', 'enough', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'disease', 'early', 'life', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'experiences', 'have', 'waste', 'final', 'months', 'shopping.Dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'again', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'think', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'Who', 'maybe', 'film', 'will', 'ultimately', 'show', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'how', 'unimportant', 'crap', 'have', 'daily', 'lives', 'really', 'only', 'purchase', 'made', 'really', 'meant', 'anything', 'was', 'Guitar', 'was', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'lifelong', 'wish', 'was', 'about', 'just', 'aimlessly', 'buying', 'something', 'Actually', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'realize', 'actually', 'need', 'films', 'like', 'take', 'very', 'serious', 'issue', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'people', 'see', 'confront', 'ultimately', 'discuss', 'never', 'bad', 'thing.4', 'Stars']","Guitar, The"

Mel rents an expensive penthouse apartment (with a very short term lease) and goes catalog shopping.  Soon her empty apartment is filled with the finest of furnishings. Her former vegetarian diet is overthrown for lavish take-out food, or actually delivery food in her case as she does not leave the apartment. As her empty apartment fills, so does her life.  She begins affairs with two delivery people and buys her childhood passion, a red guitar.Eventually Mel's life empties out again, but she is left with the greatest posession; knowing what is important to her. Although there are a few things in this movie that seemed unreralistic to me, they involved her playing the guitar. She seemed to learn awfully fast, but more disturbing to me was to see her playing in her apartment with several huge amps but no complaining neighbors.This is the kind of movie that I think needs a couple of viewings before it is fully appreciated.

Doctors are stunned as her cancer seems to have disappeared altogether.Is this meditation about the healing power of music (already seen in ""The Visitor"" film last year)?  Is it a movie about how some people cannot function in so called orderly and ordinary life?  It is only uncertainty from one moment to another that keeps them alive.

(Apparently, she had been ""feeling crappy,"" saw a doctor and was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.  No treatment is offered to slow the progress, or to make her more comfortable.  Just ""take the day to arrange your affairs and then come back to see a counselor.""  Yeah, right.Stunned, Melody makes her way back to her office.  She arrives at her cubicle only to be ""downsized"" by her boss in front of everyone.  He hands her a check for 4 weeks severance, shrugs and walks off.  Yeah, right.Distraught, she calls her ""boyfriend"" who reluctantly agrees to meet with her.  Before she can say anything, he's trotting out believable, original lines like ""I'm feeling trapped.  Not me...my lifeforce""  and ""my therapist thinks I need to get in touch with my inner child.""  So she gets dumped unceremoniously by a guy who only speaks in cliches.  Yeah, right.Melody has nothing in her life, so she contemplates suicide.  By happenstance, she sees a half page ad in the New York Times advertising the gorgeous, beautiful, spacious loft with a river view...but it's only available for two months rental.  So, yeah, right...I guess I'd spend that kind of money advertising to rent a space I only had for two months.  Anyway, Melody leaves everything she has except the clothes on her back, empties her accounts, and proceeds to move into this gorgeous loft (and it IS) and starts to furnish it to her liking using her huge pile of credit cards.Finally, the movie seems to get something right.  If you were all alone and about to die, it might be a VERY viable choice to just max out your credit cards and indulge.  Although I must say that the choices for indulgence that Melody makes aren't the ones I would make...but to each his/her own.  She confines herself entirely to her apartment (in fact, she even tosses her few clothes out the window, and until she gets new ones, struts around quite naked.)Eventually, Melody makes friends with her pizza delivery girl and her UPS man.  In fact, they all become more than friends...although it is nearly impossible to see what draws these people together other than pure hedonism.  But its all scripted in such a way as to make it all an implausible dream.Melody also remembers how as a young girl she yearned to own this lovely red electric guitar...so she finally treats herself, and spends hours on end trying to learn the instrument.  These scenes, though mostly dramatically inert, do generate some emotion...the idea of connecting to music in a way that you almost feel inside your body.Saffron Burrows is Melody, and she does a very nice job.  Were the role mishandled, the movie would have been completely unwatchable.  As it is, Burrows dives deep into her character and we frequently see real emotion on her face.  It's the kind of performance that will make casting directors take note of her skills, and perhaps land her some roles worthy of whatever talent she has.In THE GUITAR, however, the script writer almost utterly lets her down.  The final section of the film is utterly, completely ludicrous in a way that almost made me groan.  Jeanneane Garfalo, as the doctor (in a cameo that is totally jarring) is forced to utter one of the most outrageously stupid medical explanations I've ever heard in a movie.  The movie, when it was all said and done, was mostly just a big slap to my intelligence and to my understanding of how humans really behave.If you want to see Saffron Burrows take a big step as an actress (or want to see this frighteningly skinny actress nude for long stretches), this movie might be for you.

Unfortunately we do not learn whether her second alteration really remedies her spiritual and emotional struggle.  This second metamorphosis is the tougher one, the more vital, and the one with real potential.The opening is brilliant in showing that dreadful day.  Saffron Burrows is magnificent as Melody.  In many scenes she has little dialogue, but her expressions show her feelings with precision.  This movie is loaded with  allegory and unspoken communication.  The Guitar's striking symbolism and marvelously subtle facial expressions and gestures necessitates the full attention of the audience.The middle of the film, where she savors her whims, doesn't settle her dilemma.  The story ends too abruptly.  The ending glosses over her real revival.  What exactly does melody gain from her experience?  How does her life change?  The film is a start for a really great movie.  It is superbly acted and acute in its insight.  However, it misses its own significance.The story would be much better if it lead us through her insights and  rebirth, regardless of the final outcome.  For her experience to be worth telling we must feel the impact of her spiritual and emotional growth.  The film needs to show  her resolution.  Is Melody finally content?  It needs to show her living a new life, adjusting to a new existence.  Has Melody finally found herself?This is a five star story that should be a five star movie.",3,Musical  Metamorphosis?,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2659,"['Guitar', 'was', 'surprise', 'preview', 'said', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'creatively', 'emotionally', 'spiritually.I', 'expected', 'more', 'emphasis', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'impact', 'experience.The', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Melody', 'Wilder', 'having', 'worst', 'day', 'same', 'morning', 'doctor', 'fatal', 'case', 'incurable', 'cancer', 'fired', 'job', 'rejected', 'boyfriend', 'depressed', 'state', 'completely', 'life', 'monetary', 'resources', 'penthouse', 'apartment', 'breathtaking', 'shopping', 'spree.Melody', 'lived', 'very', 'lonely', 'life', 'dull', 'job', 'superficial', 'relationship', 'boy', 'friend', 'was', 'just', 'enduring', 'life', 'little', 'sense', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'Melody', 'dramatically', 'life', 'First', 'savor', 'day', 'attempts', 'enjoy', 'many', 'dreams', 'material', 'objects', 'pretty', 'clothes', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'foods', 'exotic', 'sex.Second', 'living', 'dreams', 'plans', 'not', 'enlightened', 'surprised', 'dissatisfaction', 'short', 'bout', 'depression', 'Living', 'dreams', 'did', 'not', 'solve', 'life', 'issues', 'joy', 'people', 'music', 'Unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'second', 'alteration', 'really', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'second', 'metamorphosis', 'tougher', 'one', 'more', 'vital', 'one', 'real', 'potential.The', 'opening', 'brilliant', 'showing', 'dreadful', 'day', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'magnificent', 'Melody', 'many', 'scenes', 'little', 'dialogue', 'expressions', 'show', 'feelings', 'precision', 'movie', 'loaded', 'allegory', 'unspoken', 'communication', 'Guitar', 'striking', 'symbolism', 'marvelously', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'full', 'attention', 'audience.The', 'middle', 'film', 'where', 'whims', ""n't"", 'settle', 'dilemma', 'story', 'too', 'abruptly', 'ending', 'glosses', 'real', 'revival', 'What', 'exactly', 'melody', 'gain', 'experience', 'How', 'life', 'change', 'film', 'start', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'superbly', 'acted', 'acute', 'insight', 'However', 'own', 'significance.The', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'lead', 'insights', 'rebirth', 'regardless', 'final', 'outcome', 'experience', 'be', 'worth', 'telling', 'must', 'feel', 'impact', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'growth', 'film', 'show', 'resolution', 'Melody', 'finally', 'content', 'show', 'living', 'new', 'life', 'adjusting', 'new', 'existence', 'Has', 'Melody', 'finally', 'found', 'five', 'star', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'movie']","Guitar, The"

You may have seen what Queen Latifah did in Last Holiday or listened to a country song or two, this is a  grittier version of what someone might do especially if they didn't have to worry about being around.  Very interesting as many of us probably have thought of what we would do if we received the same bad news.  As usual there is the twist at the end.  The Guitar is a desire from Melody's childhood where she wanted a red guitar from a nearby music store and finally steals it.  Melody is now dying of cancer and she fulfills her dream.  It was hard to image she would teach herself to play in less than two months but hey this is a movie where fanatsy often times is not reality.  This movie is ""R"" for a reason due to strong sexual content.  The true cancer is in her restricted and this is her journey away from those restrictions.

1212929,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001L28J2M,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 0]","A 2008 Sundance Film Festival selection, ""The Guitar"" is a film that takes us into the unpredictable world of a woman with a terminal illness. Directed by Amy Redford and with a script by Amos Pie, it is a story that dives into the mind of a lonely, grieving cancer patient and her final days--it is a story of frustrations, freedom, disconnection, and awakening.Melody Wilder (Saffron Burrows) is a woman who had just discovered that she only has two months to live--she has been diagnosed with throat cancer. To make things worse, she had just been laid off from her job and before she can confide with her boyfriend about her affliction, he breaks up with her. So what does Melody do? She cleans out her existing bank accounts, and rents a short term loft. Without any fears and inhibitions, Melody makes a carefree life for her last days--maxing out her credit cards, walks around stark naked in her loft, abandons her healthy diet, indulges in exploratory sexual experiences, until finally she learns to play a guitar.Delving into the mind of a cancer victim is a very interesting premise, think ""Last Holiday"" and ""the Bucket List"" but on a much smaller timeline. However, the film does have quite a number of weaknesses. The script feels to display a some of overload of the bleak things that can happen to one person. I mean, it is possible for all these things to happen, but I think it leaned too much on the cruelty of the world, and it feels a little heavy-handed. The direction by Amy Redford does get its message across; it is a forceful approach enough, but it just feels too much of an exhibition that just grabs the viewer, that some may have a slight suspension of disbelief and a leap beyond logic.The way Melody expresses her grief may be a little predictable--buying totally unnecessary things, indulging in foods high in cholesterol and calories, and secluding herself in an enclosed space is believable but the way the following events occur is just too convenient. She develops friendships with a courier delivery man named Roscoe (Isaac De Bankole) and a pizza delivery girl named ""Cookie"" (Paz Dela Huerte), and of course she has sex with both of them. Mel's situation should be more complicated, and the screenplay fails to add complexities to her last few days. It just feels too predictable and what happens in the loft isn't anything new. The film is very simple, and has the ""living the moment"" theme going for it, but it felt too simple for its own good--nothing much happens.For a film like this to succeed, the lead actress has to be very capable. Well, despite the weaknesses of the script, Saffron Burrows manages to draw the best out of what she had while being restrained by the script, but she can`t really fully succeed. I really liked her in ""Deep Blue Sea"" and even in smaller roles such as in ""Troy"", I thought Burrows is an underrated actress. Most parts of the film had little or no dialogue at all, (I thought this was a good approach to the film) and Burrows does manage to express the needed emotions that ranges from fear, desperation and pain, covered up by over-indulgence. The chemistry between Melody, Roscoe and Cookie does serve up the necessary ingredients that kept my interest, its energetic material does put some of its overly done plot elements at ease. ""The Guitar"" does somewhat succeed as a semi-character study of an ill woman, her frail sickly frame and plaintive gestures of sadness does generate sympathy.""The Guitar"" does have missed opportunities in its narrative, it failed to deliver a truly complex character drama and opted to elements which are too predictable for my tastes; it lacked a strong grip on tangibility and realistic inventiveness. Its themes about self-discovery, maturing through disconnection and finding artistic redemption was missing some needed dramatic impact on its narrative. The lively bond between Melody and her new friends brought some sexy scenes of experimentations, and exacerbating chemistry in the screenplay. I thought the acting by Burrows proved to be its main strength as a cancer victim searching for contentment. While the film could have soared a lot, lot higher, I'm happy to say, at least it managed to stay aloft.Recommended with caution, Rent it first [3  - Stars]",3,3 - Stars: Becoming Free and Bold can Lead to Self-Discovery....,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,4281,"['2008', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'selection', 'Guitar', 'film', 'unpredictable', 'world', 'woman', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Directed', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'script', 'Amos', 'Pie', 'story', 'mind', 'lonely', 'grieving', 'cancer', 'patient', 'final', 'days', 'story', 'frustrations', 'freedom', 'disconnection', 'awakening.Melody', 'Wilder', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'discovered', 'only', 'two', 'months', 'live', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'throat', 'cancer', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'laid', 'off', 'job', 'can', 'confide', 'boyfriend', 'affliction', 'up', 'what', 'Melody', 'do', 'out', 'existing', 'bank', 'accounts', 'short', 'term', 'loft', 'fears', 'inhibitions', 'Melody', 'carefree', 'life', 'last', 'days', 'maxing', 'out', 'credit', 'cards', 'walks', 'stark', 'naked', 'loft', 'healthy', 'diet', 'exploratory', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'finally', 'play', 'guitar.Delving', 'mind', 'cancer', 'victim', 'very', 'interesting', 'premise', 'think', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'Bucket', 'List', 'much', 'smaller', 'timeline', 'However', 'film', 'have', 'quite', 'number', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'feels', 'display', 'overload', 'bleak', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'one', 'person', 'mean', 'possible', 'things', 'happen', 'think', 'leaned', 'too', 'much', 'cruelty', 'world', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'get', 'message', 'forceful', 'approach', 'enough', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'much', 'exhibition', 'just', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'slight', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'leap', 'logic.The', 'way', 'Melody', 'grief', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'predictable', 'buying', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'things', 'indulging', 'foods', 'high', 'cholesterol', 'calories', 'secluding', 'enclosed', 'space', 'believable', 'way', 'following', 'events', 'occur', 'just', 'too', 'convenient', 'friendships', 'courier', 'delivery', 'man', 'named', 'Roscoe', 'Isaac', 'De', 'Bankole', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'girl', 'named', 'Cookie', 'Paz', 'Dela', 'Huerte', 'course', 'sex', 'Mel', 'situation', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'complicated', 'screenplay', 'add', 'complexities', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'predictable', 'what', 'loft', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'living', 'moment', 'theme', 'going', 'felt', 'too', 'simple', 'own', 'good', 'nothing', 'much', 'happens.For', 'film', 'succeed', 'lead', 'actress', 'be', 'very', 'capable', 'Well', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'draw', 'best', 'what', 'had', 'being', 'restrained', 'script', 'can', 't', 'really', 'fully', 'succeed', 'really', 'liked', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'even', 'smaller', 'roles', 'such', 'Troy', 'thought', 'Burrows', 'underrated', 'actress', 'Most', 'parts', 'film', 'had', 'little', 'dialogue', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'approach', 'film', 'Burrows', 'manage', 'express', 'needed', 'emotions', 'fear', 'desperation', 'pain', 'covered', 'up', 'over-indulgence', 'chemistry', 'Melody', 'Roscoe', 'Cookie', 'serve', 'up', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'kept', 'interest', 'energetic', 'material', 'put', 'overly', 'done', 'plot', 'elements', 'ease', 'Guitar', 'somewhat', 'succeed', 'semi-character', 'study', 'ill', 'woman', 'frail', 'sickly', 'frame', 'plaintive', 'gestures', 'sadness', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'Guitar', 'have', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'narrative', 'failed', 'deliver', 'truly', 'complex', 'character', 'drama', 'opted', 'elements', 'are', 'too', 'predictable', 'tastes', 'lacked', 'strong', 'grip', 'tangibility', 'realistic', 'inventiveness', 'themes', 'self-discovery', 'maturing', 'disconnection', 'finding', 'artistic', 'redemption', 'was', 'missing', 'needed', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'narrative', 'lively', 'bond', 'Melody', 'new', 'friends', 'brought', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'experimentations', 'exacerbating', 'chemistry', 'screenplay', 'thought', 'acting', 'Burrows', 'proved', 'be', 'main', 'strength', 'cancer', 'victim', 'searching', 'contentment', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'soared', 'lot', 'lot', 'higher', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'least', 'managed', 'stay', 'aloft.Recommended', 'caution', 'Rent', 'first', '3', 'Stars', ']']","Guitar, The"
