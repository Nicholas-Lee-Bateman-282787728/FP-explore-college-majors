Still, for people that are looking for a great action movie, this is the place to look. It always amazes me when Hollywood imports directors and they make terrible movies here (see: John Woo, Tsui Hark, etc) and still manage to make excellent movies in their native countries.  Time and Tide is an excellent example of this, it is stylish, well paced, and easy to watch. The plot surrounds a bartender who gets an undercover lesbian cop pregnant during a one night stand.  Nine months later, she's expecting and he's become a bodyguard to try and raise money for her and his child, even though she wants nothing to do with him.  Also in appearance is a mercenary friend of his and his pregnant girlfriend.  The plot from here on out is sketchy at best, but you never care.  The movie moves forward with such drive and intensity, that you never stop to think about the details. The DVD presentation is crisp and clear, with amazing sound and visuals which really do justice to the use of color.  Tsui Hark's eye is flawless and old-school action fans will appreciate the spare use of camera tricks and CGI which really allow the action to be seen (and you have to wonder in awe at many of the stunts that these guys actually do instead of thinking, &quot;wow, that's some great special effects). The DVD is sparse on extras, but it does include an interesting commentary by the director.  Still, the movie is reason enough to purchase this flick.  Definitely, HK action movie fans and US movie fans that are tired of the barrage of expensive special effects in place of real creativity will love this movie.",5,"All I have to say is, &quot;Wow&quot;",997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,1680,"['Alright', 'not', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'big', 'plot', 'character', 'Still', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'place', 'look', 'always', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'imports', 'directors', 'make', 'terrible', 'movies', 'here', 'see', 'John', 'Woo', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'etc', 'still', 'manage', 'make', 'excellent', 'movies', 'native', 'countries', 'Time', 'Tide', 'excellent', 'example', 'stylish', 'well', 'paced', 'easy', 'watch', 'plot', 'bartender', 'who', 'undercover', 'lesbian', 'cop', 'pregnant', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Nine', 'months', 'later', 'expecting', 'become', 'bodyguard', 'try', 'raise', 'money', 'child', 'even', 'nothing', 'do', 'Also', 'appearance', 'mercenary', 'friend', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'plot', 'here', 'out', 'sketchy', 'best', 'never', 'care', 'movie', 'forward', 'such', 'drive', 'intensity', 'never', 'stop', 'think', 'details', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'crisp', 'clear', 'amazing', 'sound', 'visuals', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'use', 'color', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'eye', 'flawless', 'old-school', 'action', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'spare', 'use', 'camera', 'tricks', 'CGI', 'really', 'allow', 'action', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'wonder', 'awe', 'many', 'stunts', 'guys', 'actually', 'do', 'instead', 'thinking', 'quot', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'extras', 'include', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'director', 'Still', 'movie', 'reason', 'enough', 'purchase', 'flick', 'Definitely', 'HK', 'action', 'movie', 'fans', 'US', 'movie', 'fans', 'are', 'tired', 'barrage', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'place', 'real', 'creativity', 'will', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

There are others who may offer more &quot;art&quot; or more interesting character studies, or even more hyperkinetic action, but Tsui Hark just keeps on coming up with new ways of depicting action, and &quot;Time and Tide&quot; definitely continues the tradition. Unlike many of his other works, though, this film actually has a really good (and coherent!) storyline.&quot;Time and Tide&quot; shows that Tsui Hark is capable of being serious about his characters without compromising the slick visuals that are his trademark. The main character is far more introspective than usual for such a serious action film, and Tsui uses fast cuts, split screens, and other visually interesting techniques to depict the more prosaic scenes just as effectively as he uses them in the action scenes.This is one of those rare films that worked for me both as a hardcore action film and as a story about interesting people.

663497,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00005LK99,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 11]","Time and tide may wait for no man, but Tsui Hark's film certainly doesn't, jettisoning coherence and character in its Leone-lunge to the finish.  'Time and Tide' follows the wearisomely familiar 'North By Northwest' action formula - a cocky, irresponsible and selfish man emotionally matures and learns to think about others, to the point of risking his life.  Just in case we miss the point, there are TWO pregnant women in the film - his struggles to develop feelings, mirror the 'difficulties' in giving birth; the babies are a signal of rebirth for men who are willing to ditch their old (macho) lives and start again.The hero is a 21-year-old barman who picks up a hostile undercover cop, whose girlfriend has just ditched her.  After a drunken one-night-stand, he joins a dodgy security firm to raise enough money to escape to South America to 'forget' her, or, later, when he discovers she's pregnant, for alimony.  Meanwhile, in South America (and I found this part especially difficult to follow), a drug deal and jailbreak have consequences which spill out into Hong Kong.  At a job protecting some industrial magnate, the bodyguards learn that an assassination will be attempted.  The magnate's outcast, pregnant daughter, who married beneath her, is there with her husband, an abbattoir employee who unexpectedly connects the two plots.Hark's best films ('Peking Opera Blues', 'Once Upon A Time In China') are such fun because the action pyrotechnics are rooted in characters we come to care about.  In this film, however, action takes precedence, and characters are left to fend for themselves, which they find more difficult than dodging endless bullets.  Even this wouldn't matter if the action was up to Hark's usual spectacular standard.  But rather than dance, the set-pieces stutter, the irritatingly 'frenetic' camerawork and jittery editing destroy all momentum.  The confusion as to what is going on in any given set-piece leaves the viewer disengaged.  The 'choreography' of movement is disappointingly graceless, under-imagined, even perfunctory. The locations, so evocative and central to Hark's major works, are merely functional backdrops.  The whole thing goes on far too long, and the sentimental subplot attempting to re-orient the lesbian is tasteless.",2,Disappointing and exhausting.,1014940800,"03 1, 2002",2002,2283,"['Time', 'tide', 'may', 'wait', 'man', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'jettisoning', 'coherence', 'character', 'Leone-lunge', 'finish', ""'Time"", 'Tide', 'wearisomely', 'familiar', ""'North"", 'Northwest', 'action', 'formula', 'cocky', 'irresponsible', 'selfish', 'man', 'emotionally', 'think', 'others', 'point', 'risking', 'life', 'Just', 'case', 'miss', 'point', 'are', 'TWO', 'pregnant', 'women', 'film', 'struggles', 'develop', 'feelings', 'mirror', ""'difficulties"", 'giving', 'birth', 'babies', 'are', 'signal', 'rebirth', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'ditch', 'old', 'macho', 'lives', 'start', 'again.The', 'hero', '21-year-old', 'barman', 'who', 'up', 'hostile', 'undercover', 'cop', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'ditched', 'drunken', 'one-night-stand', 'dodgy', 'security', 'firm', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'escape', 'South', 'America', ""'forget"", 'later', 'when', 'pregnant', 'alimony', 'Meanwhile', 'South', 'America', 'found', 'part', 'especially', 'difficult', 'follow', 'drug', 'deal', 'jailbreak', 'have', 'consequences', 'spill', 'out', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'job', 'protecting', 'industrial', 'magnate', 'bodyguards', 'learn', 'assassination', 'will', 'be', 'attempted', 'magnate', 'outcast', 'pregnant', 'daughter', 'who', 'married', 'there', 'husband', 'abbattoir', 'employee', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'two', 'plots.Hark', 'best', 'films', ""'Peking"", 'Opera', 'Blues', 'Time', 'China', 'are', 'such', 'fun', 'action', 'pyrotechnics', 'are', 'rooted', 'characters', 'come', 'care', 'about', 'film', 'however', 'action', 'precedence', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'find', 'more', 'difficult', 'dodging', 'endless', 'bullets', 'Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'action', 'was', 'up', 'Hark', 'usual', 'spectacular', 'standard', 'rather', 'dance', 'set-pieces', 'stutter', 'irritatingly', ""'frenetic"", 'camerawork', 'jittery', 'editing', 'destroy', 'momentum', 'confusion', 'what', 'going', 'given', 'set-piece', 'viewer', 'disengaged', ""'choreography"", 'movement', 'disappointingly', 'graceless', 'under-imagined', 'even', 'perfunctory', 'locations', 'so', 'evocative', 'central', 'Hark', 'major', 'works', 'are', 'merely', 'functional', 'backdrops', 'whole', 'thing', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'sentimental', 'subplot', 'attempting', 're-orient', 'lesbian', 'tasteless']",N/A

663500,A2A7SO6BBYM13F,B00005LK99,Garvinstomp,"[1, 1]","This is one of those movies I absolutely love. . .but I'm not entirely sure why.  I seem to find myself watching it over and over.  When I was in film school we would all get together and watch it, like moths to a flame.  Even the most artistic films snobs would sit silently in awe of this movie.  But I'll try and recall as much as I can.First, from a technical standpoint, this film is brilliant.  Tsui redefines handheld camerawork in this film.  It's not the typical ""shaky"" cam.  It's like a hyper dolly move.  Plus, you have to give mad props to any movie where the camera man jumps out the window and rappels down the side of a building after the actor. . .and holds the shot!! (if you missed it, check the apartment shootout when Wu Bai runs and jumps out the window and ropes down the side-that ain't no crane or jib arm, folks)  The visual style adds a lot to the overall feeling of the movie.Second, the movie just drips with cool.  But it's not a forced cool.  It's just done in such a way that even the simplest actions seem graceful.  Effortless.Third, Anthony Wong and Nicholas Tse are great.  Wu Bai brings his brooding rock star thing to the screen quite nicely, as well.  But Tsui has never had a problem getting solid performances out of any of the people he's worked with  (I don't care what anyone says, I love Knock Off and I'll fight to the death to defend it as a great film).  The interplay and banter between characters is cool.  Nobody gets overly chatty, but it's enough.Fourth, the action, while not as plentiful as other films in the genre, is solid.  Even in his worst films, Tsui knows how to put action to celluloid.  He can do it in his sleep.  This movie is no exception.  People rappelling down the side of an apartment building having a machine gun battle?  What?  Are you serious?  Yeah, he's the man.I know people take umbrage with the plot.  Yeah, the crazy guy and the cockroaches and all the meandering can seem a little weird.  But, like me, just watch it 40+ times and it'll all make perfect sense.  Seriously, though, watch it a few times and you'll get it.  It gets better every time.Most people wouldn't enjoy this film.  In fact, this is really not a mainstream film in any way.  Film people can appreciate the technical specs, and then there are just a select few who will always find themselves mesmerized by it for no apparent reason.  But those looking for another Hard Boiled will be quite disappointed.  All I can recommend is to try it.  You'll either love it or wish you hadn't seen it.  But for those of you that do love it, you'll keep coming back to it, time and time again.  It will call to you while you sleep, eat, work, even when you're making the sweet lovings.

Everyone of my friends told me how good this action flick was and since Eggbert and Older gave it two thumbs up, I decided to give it a try. I was very saddened. The story is very stupid and exaggerated. They even have spanish speaking Asian assasins in this flick(they speak as fluently as any spanish speaker)which makes it even cornier. But like most action movies is not so much about the story it's about the action, and that's what I anticipated. But the action didn't thrill me like it did in such action flicks such as &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; &quot;Face Off&quot; or even &quot;The Black Mask&quot;. Believe me, if you like John Woo or Robert Rodriguez you have seen a lot of ground broken in action, and this movie doesn't even come close to that. Tsui Hark doesn't come close to accomplishing what his former best friend John Woo has done. In this film Tsui Hark recycles the action of films like the lackluster &quot;The Big Hit&quot;, and &quot;Way of the Gun&quot;(except Time and Tide had no blood). Heck, this movie reminded me so much of the atrocious &quot;Big Hit&quot; just with more uninspired action sequences. I continue to ponder how people were so amazed by this movie, I guess they never seen a John Woo flick. But believe me if you are interested in checking out this movie please watch &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; or even &quot;Desperado&quot; instead.

Despite having holes in logic and plot, this is one of those action films that doesn't want to get boggled down in the details.  The story as it is involves a young bartender who happens to have everything going bad for him from the start.  He gets a cop pregnant (who doesn't really like playing with the opposite sex, if you get my meaning) and she immediately hates his guts.  But, he decides to help out by taking a job at a bodyguard agency (run by a loan shark, no less) and happens to gain a friend who's an in-law of one of the clients the agency is protecting.  Everything's going great, until he meets his friend's former associates (as in gun-toting, vicious mercenary type ""associates"") and ends up having to fight to stay alive.  One thing this movie's got in spades is action.  There are sequences in this film that are thoroughly unbelievable (such as a cat-and-mouse game in a tenement building, a brutal robbery during a tropical storm, and a showdown inside a stadium).  It's a film that teeters between romantic comedy and hard-boiled action, and despite seeming to miss a scene or two (watch the trailer on the DVD for evidence) and having a very interesting DVD commentary with director Tsui Hark, ""Time and Tide"" is at least worth a rental for Hong-Kong action buffs.

663508,A10Q9341H2LYX0,B00005LK99,Shan Wickremesinghe,"[1, 1]","Pay attention to this film or it will leave you behind with the intensity and speed it moves at.Tyler (real life Chinese musician Nicholas Tse) plays, who works at a bar when not for a bodyguard firm. Policewoman Ho-ming and her inspector girlfriend have a fight in said bar one night. It leads to Tyler and Ho-ming meeting, drinking a lot in bars at one end of the street and throwing up on traffic at the other end.Waking up the next morning in his apartment in bed together is especially bad news, especially since she has a gun. Fortunately Tyler has the sense to get his pants back on before she then wakes up and threatens to shoot him.  Did they or didn't they is the big question and it is answered in short order when the next scene is captioned ""9 months later"".So, what does this first 6 minutes actually have to do with the rest of the film? Not as much as you'd think despite this being the beginning. The film is not so much about Tyler but his friend Jack (Wu Bai, a Taiwanese musician in real life). He works for a butcher and is married to Jennifer, daughter of a Hong Kong mobster Mr. Hong. He doesn't think much of Jack.Tyler's firm is given the job of protecting Mr. Hong but things get complicated. Some old friends of Jack's turn up from Brazil and ask him to kill someone. In his past life (unknown to everyone else), Jack was part of this team of mercenaries called The Angels. They kill people for a living and ably demonstrated this while in Brazil, just before coming to Hong Kong. Unfortunately for Jack, the target turns out to be his father-in-law. Jack registers his opinion of this idea later by killing his former boss instead and stealing a lot of money from his former compatriots in a daring hit and following escape.The last 45 minutes of the film are some of the best non-stop action you'll ever see as the Angels attempt to ambush Jack at his apartment. Combat spills over to a pitched battle at Kowloon Station and a nearby stadium hosting a rock concert. Two of the main protagonists fight to the death with guns, grenades, fists and feet above the unsuspecting audience while Tyler tries to deliver Jennifer's baby in the basement and avoid being killed at the same time.You have to feel sorry for Tyler, he blunders into things a lot. He tries to do the right thing for Ho-ming and puts money under her door. She wants him to get lost and her dog eats the money. Her girlfriend puts a dent in his skull.  He tries to do his job. He foils the first attempted hit on Mr. Hong (not by the Angels) and narrowly avoids being shot in a fight with the assassin. All he gets in return is hit for leaving his post and threatened with being fired because no-one saw the fight and the assassin escaped. Clearly out of his league, it's a continuing source of amazement that he isn't killed. Later Tyler temporarily foils Jack's escape (then Jack is forced to beat him up to get away). This gets Tyler accused of being in league with him for stealing the money and being locked in the back of a truck until he confesses to being in on it. This is all (bad) news for him and its getting worse all the time.Seeing him then break into Jack's apartment with a sledgehammer in search the stolen money, unaware that it is staked out by a number of heavily armed mercenaries is funny. Watching him burst through doors with a fake gun while a heavily armed man hiding inside and snipers outside decide whether or not to kill him is quite hilarious. Tyler goes on leading a charmed life as people step in front of bullets meant for him and narrowly avoids being blown up thanks to everyday kitchen appliances.The acrobatics are amazing and just within the realm of the possible. The fight in Jack's apartment block is a particular highlight. Human agility is pushed to the limit. The combatants fight, run and scramble from building to building on ropes with no visible break from one motion to the next. Each jump,leap, punch and kick flows without a break from one to the next (but not like Crouching Tiger either - different but equal). Things are enhanced by innovative use of ""Point of thrown object views"" and ""Frozen rotational explosion perspective"" (you'll have to see what I mean) which add to the experience (and no, they're not ripping off The Matrix, which borrowed heavily from Hong Kong cinema in the first place). Even Tyler who spends a lot of time being swatted like a fly has a lot of agility and athleticism, it's just that the numerous people trying to kill him have the edge on him with that score.Tyler settles differences with Ho-ming, Jennifer delivers safely, Jack achieves redemption, the guilty are smited and Tsui Hark receives atonement for Double Team and Knock Off.This film was reviewed in Time magazine (at least the Asia-Pacific region) quite favorably and got a cinema/DVD/video release in Australia.Don't think about why Jack's friends didn't kill Mr. Hong themselves. Also they actually speak Portuguese more than Spanish in Brazil (Some scenes are in English and Spanish as well as Cantonese) . Just suspend disbelief, things just ""are"" in this film.The acting is very good (musicians or not, they do a very good job and I think one of them contributed to the excellent music in this film). This film is close to perfect for an action film and surpassing anything done in the US. I strongly recommend you see this film. Buy it if there's no other way to find it.Hopefully not being remade in the US anytime soon, preferably not at all.",4,"""Time"" waits for no-one.",1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,5495,"['Pay',

He had to let people know he was back, and still at the cutting edge of action cinema.  TIME AND TIDE is a movie that confuses a lot of audiences, due to the unconventional editing approach Tsui took.  In a similar way to Wong Kar Wai, the editing removes most of the 'standard' scenes that drive plots forward, and leaves the incidental details - the looks, the expressions, the visual mood.  You have to dig deep to follow what happens, but claims that the movie has no plot are naive.
