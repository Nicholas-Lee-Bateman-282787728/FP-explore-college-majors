Having not particularly been able to relate to the characters of the first Havocmovie, I found myself at even a bigger loss here. These are lost, lost souls and the characters that are the most redeemable are more lost than everyone else. I'm not sure if the movie was going for a non-judgmental feel or simply didn't know where to take the storyline.",2,unrelatable and somehow off beat,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,414,"['was', 'curious', 'movie', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Having', 'not', 'particularly', 'been', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'first', 'Havocmovie', 'found', 'even', 'bigger', 'loss', 'here', 'are', 'lost', 'lost', 'souls', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'redeemable', 'are', 'more', 'lost', 'everyone', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'non-judgmental', 'feel', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'take', 'storyline']",Normal Adolescent Behavior: Havoc 2

It was basic cable so some language and possibly content was edited a bit.  It was still pretty sexy, so I can't wait to get this version.  The acting is great.  I hadn't heard of Ashton Holmes before, but I really liked him, and Amber Tamblyn is a great actress.I wouldn't be surprised that some teenagers are doing this kind of stuff.  Everyone knows teens are having sex at pretty young ages, so it's not a stretch to think that a group of close friends could be having group sex.  The best part of the movie is the relationship between Sean and Wendy.  I think it's sweet how he wants her to leave her group and be just with him in a ""normal"" relationship.  And they have tons of chemistry in their scenes together.I strongly recommend this movie for people 17 and up.",5,Excellent movie!,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,828,"['saw', 'cable', 'TV', 'month', 'ago', 'loved', 'was', 'basic', 'cable', 'so', 'language', 'possibly', 'content', 'was', 'edited', 'bit', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'version', 'acting', 'great', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'really', 'liked', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'great', 'actress.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'teenagers', 'are', 'doing', 'kind', 'stuff', 'Everyone', 'teens', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'pretty', 'young', 'ages', 'not', 'stretch', 'think', 'group', 'close', 'friends', 'could', 'be', 'having', 'group', 'sex', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'Wendy', 'think', 'sweet', 'how', 'leave', 'group', 'be', 'just', 'normal', 'relationship', 'have', 'tons', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'together.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', '17', 'up']",Normal Adolescent Behavior: Havoc 2
