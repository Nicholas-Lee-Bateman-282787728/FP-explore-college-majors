In fact, even the other 4 or 5 sets with a couple years worth of episodes grouped together are suffering from the same omissions. Some missing episodes include:The Amazing Cosmic Awareness Of Duffy MoonP.J. and the President's SonMe and My Dad's New WifeThe Boy Who Drank Too MuchThe WaveMy Mother and the MonsterBridge Of Adam RushSummer SwitchThese sets are very misleading, allowing the buyer to believe they are getting all of the episodes. In my eyes, just the fact that The Boy Who Drank Too Much isn't included is enough to nix the idea of buying the set (Scott Baio and Lance Kerwin are stellar, believable teens in this excellently written and acted drama) The price they are asking for this set and the other split sets is ridiculous, and for that much money certainly it should be complete and then some.",1,Beware!

Huff ""Color Me Noir""","[1, 1]","The ABC After School Specials were a great treat and as I was just 11 years old when they premiered in 1972 I have seen most of the episodes prior to 1980. This multi award winning show ran for 25 seasons from 1972 to 1997 totaling 154 episodes at roughly 52 mins. each (commercials were shorter in those days) Its a pity that they may never put all of the specials on disc as these may be a little dated in appearance but the messages they convey are still very relevant today. The stories, casting, actors and directors are amazing with future stars as kids (Jodie Foster, Val Kilmer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sarah Jessica Parker among others) the stories were usually very mature (birth, death, bullies, drugs, peer pressure, divorce, etc.) and dealt with the subject matter in a serious manner but from the kids point of view they treated kids like reasonable people and didn't stoop to 'dumbing down' the material or making it 'comical' or fanciful like they do with so many programs today (the Disney treatment) in an effort to make it palatable (For the Adults - Not the Kids) they make the subject seem less important.",5,Blast from the past!!!,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,1121,"['ABC', 'School', 'Specials', 'were', 'great', 'treat', 'was', 'just', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'premiered', '1972', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'prior', '1980', 'multi', 'award', 'winning', 'show', 'ran', '25', 'seasons', '1972', '1997', 'totaling', '154', 'episodes', 'roughly', '52', 'mins', 'commercials', 'were', 'shorter', 'days', 'pity', 'may', 'never', 'put', 'specials', 'disc', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'dated', 'appearance', 'messages', 'convey', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'relevant', 'today', 'stories', 'casting', 'actors', 'directors', 'are', 'amazing', 'future', 'stars', 'kids', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'others', 'stories', 'were', 'usually', 'very', 'mature', 'birth', 'death', 'bullies', 'drugs', 'peer', 'pressure', 'divorce', 'etc', 'subject', 'matter', 'serious', 'manner', 'kids', 'point', 'view', 'treated', 'kids', 'reasonable', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'stoop', ""'dumbing"", 'down', 'material', 'making', ""'comical"", 'fanciful', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'programs', 'today', 'Disney', 'treatment', 'effort', 'make', 'palatable', 'Adults', 'Not', 'Kids', 'make', 'subject', 'seem', 'less', 'important']",After School Specials

The films were ground breaking in their day for dealing with many issues such as abuse,teen pregnancy, drug addition or just feeling like an outsider in school.This set includes 26 highly regarded films from the series, two episodes that are exclusive to this set. The films run around 46 minutes and look fairly clean, but they do look a bit soft and faded. They appear to be uncut and it's nice to see them available on DVD.I had not seen these shows since their original air dates and most of them hold up, but some seem a little dated with a bit of unintentional humor.The most interesting thing about most of these shows is the casting of some young stars that had later fame or were stars from some very popular TV series at the same time.I would have liked to have seen some better treatment to these shows as they look like the transfers are direct from VHS and there are no extras on this set, which is a little disappointing.If you have children, this is an excellent source to use to open discussion about problems they may be experiencing or help them avoid some of these obstacles in their lives.
