1071761,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B000PKG6FS,Ben Wasden,"[2, 2]","Let me begin by stating that Ghoulies IV is a bad movie. Still, it has some goofy and hilarious moments sprinkled throughout that make it okay viewing for the b-movie fan. What disappointed me was that the original Ghoulies were nowhere to be found in Ghoulies IV, other than in flashbacks. Here we have new Ghoulies, and they are actually good guys. And they talk. Also, I wouldn't consider Ghoulies IV a horror movie or even a horror-comedy like the others in the series. It's a cop action-comedy with some supernatural elements. I swear, it's as if director Jim Wynorski hadn't seen any of the other entries in the Ghoulies series, because this one isn't like any of the others at all. And speaking of Wynorski, there isn't any nudity in Ghoulies IV. That must have been a first for him. After seeing Ghoulies IV, I can understand why this was the last in the series. The others were so bad they were good. This one's so bad, it's...just okay.",2,"About As Good As A Movie Called ""Ghoulies IV"" Could Be",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,946,"['Let', 'begin', 'stating', 'Ghoulies', 'IV', 'bad', 'movie', 'Still', 'goofy', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'make', 'okay', 'viewing', 'b-movie', 'fan', 'What', 'disappointed', 'was', 'original', 'Ghoulies', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Ghoulies', 'IV', 'other', 'flashbacks', 'Here', 'have', 'new', 'Ghoulies', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'guys', 'talk', 'Also', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Ghoulies', 'IV', 'horror', 'movie', 'even', 'horror-comedy', 'others', 'series', 'cop', 'action-comedy', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'swear', 'director', 'Jim', 'Wynorski', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'entries', 'Ghoulies', 'series', 'one', ""n't"", 'like', 'others', 'speaking', 'Wynorski', ""n't"", 'nudity', 'Ghoulies', 'IV', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'seeing', 'Ghoulies', 'IV', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'last', 'series', 'others', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'were', 'good', 'one', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'okay']",N/A

1071766,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,B000PKG6FS,The Whatever Dude,"[3, 4]","Sixth (And last) movie in the boxset. Well, looks like I've saved the best one for last. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review for this back in like February, but I decided to do a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty awesome. I know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. This happens to be my favorite one in the series. Yeah, I know the actual Ghoulies don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, onto the movie.The movie centers around Jonathan Graves, the main character from the first movie, being played once again, by Peter Liapis, who is now a cop for the LAPD and has put his past of the occult behind him. During the first part of the movie, we encounter Alexandra (Played by the very hot Stacie Randall) communicating with a demon from beyond named Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry, therefore, unleashing the Ghoulies from the beyond.I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the directing. And the music by Chuck Cirino is funny as well. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the Ghoulies say that there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V.  I still hope that sequel gets made and I especially hope Jim Wynorski returns to direct.",5,Not as bad as it's reputation may suggest.
