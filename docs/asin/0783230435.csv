63189,A1CNLU84K5ZIOZ,0783230435,"Annie Kamp ""Pet Momma""","[5, 7]","As we open to the first scene of the film, based on the novel writen by Erich Maria Remarque, who was a German Veteran of WW1, and directed by lewis Milestone, we see a group of schoolboys, children really, listening to their teacher teling the boys why they must join the Army. Outside we hear the crowds cheering for the departing soldiers leaving for the battlefield. You almost feel the same pride for country weling up inside of each of these boys and almost feel yourself ready to run of to war with them. they march off from schoolwith dreams of themselves as victorious heros. They are sent off to training and become more tightknit in their hatred for their instructor, the towns postman. When they arrive at the front, they see no victory, only hunger, fear and death greet them. They fight and watch as soldiers die next to them,their friends lives ended beforetheir own eyes they kill and in one scene, the films star Lew Ayres, Paul kills another soldier and spends the night in a ditch trying to save him, then seeing him die as he tries to give im water. In one of the last scenes you see Paul, having just that day returned from R&R;, walking along the road back to camp with Kat, Louis Wolheim a gruff looking and wondrful actor, they dive downto miss a bomb. Kat is hit and the not so young Paul says he will carry him back to camp.  Another bomb, we are safe Paul says to Kat as he continues to carry the older soldier back to be bandaged. When they reach the hospital, Paul puts Kt on a stretcher and says he just needs bandaged, Kat is dead. The closing scene was, for me, quite dramatic. Paul, seeing a Butterfly, reaches his hand out to let the Butterfly lit on him, he is shot. Fade to black.You are able to easily see that talkies are still quite new, many of the actors are still accustomed to the 'overacting' from silent filmwork. So many of the movements seem forced and overworked. But it is an amazing anti-war film. Interestingly, Milestone had originally wanted Erich Maria Remarque, the writer, to play the leadrole. After seeing the film go to the Cast & Filmmakers Bios, I was amazed at the many sccomplishments of the films stars. Rightly this film was awarded the Best Film Oscar in 1930. It spoke volumes then that today, especially in recent years, is still heard fresh.",5,Fatal butterflies,1057276800,"07 4, 2003",2003,2310,"['open', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'writen', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'who', 'was', 'German', 'Veteran', 'WW1', 'directed', 'lewis', 'Milestone', 'see', 'group', 'schoolboys', 'children', 'really', 'listening', 'teacher', 'teling', 'boys', 'why', 'must', 'join', 'Army', 'hear', 'crowds', 'cheering', 'departing', 'soldiers', 'leaving', 'battlefield', 'almost', 'feel', 'same', 'pride', 'country', 'weling', 'up', 'inside', 'boys', 'almost', 'feel', 'ready', 'run', 'war', 'march', 'schoolwith', 'dreams', 'victorious', 'heros', 'are', 'sent', 'training', 'become', 'more', 'tightknit', 'hatred', 'instructor', 'towns', 'postman', 'When', 'arrive', 'front', 'see', 'victory', 'only', 'hunger', 'fear', 'death', 'greet', 'fight', 'watch', 'soldiers', 'die', 'next', 'friends', 'ended', 'beforetheir', 'own', 'eyes', 'kill', 'one', 'scene', 'films', 'star', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'Paul', 'soldier', 'night', 'ditch', 'trying', 'save', 'then', 'seeing', 'die', 'give', 'im', 'water', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'see', 'Paul', 'having', 'just', 'day', 'returned', 'R', 'R', 'walking', 'road', 'back', 'camp', 'Kat', 'Louis', 'Wolheim', 'gruff', 'looking', 'wondrful', 'actor', 'dive', 'downto', 'miss', 'bomb', 'Kat', 'hit', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'Paul', 'will', 'carry', 'back', 'camp', 'bomb', 'are', 'safe', 'Paul', 'Kat', 'carry', 'older', 'soldier', 'back', 'be', 'bandaged', 'When', 'reach', 'hospital', 'Paul', 'Kt', 'stretcher', 'just', 'bandaged', 'Kat', 'dead', 'closing', 'scene', 'was', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'Paul', 'seeing', 'Butterfly', 'hand', 'let', 'Butterfly', 'lit', 'shot', 'Fade', 'black.You', 'are', 'able', 'easily', 'see', 'talkies', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'new', 'many', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'accustomed', ""'overacting"", 'silent', 'filmwork', 'So', 'many', 'movements', 'seem', 'forced', 'overworked', 'amazing', 'anti-war', 'film', 'Interestingly', 'Milestone', 'had', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'writer', 'play', 'leadrole', 'seeing', 'film', 'go', 'Cast', 'Filmmakers', 'Bios', 'was', 'amazed', 'many', 'sccomplishments', 'films', 'stars', 'Rightly', 'film', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Film', 'Oscar', '1930', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'then', 'today', 'especially', 'recent', 'years', 'still', 'heard', 'fresh']",N/A

The photography of the shots during All Quiet on the Western Front is unbelievably and visually stunning. Thinking of the scenes, I may consider about discrediting Saving Private Ryan from Best Films list. On the other hand, I truly believe that All Quiet on the Western Front contains nearly every emotion possible, and when I saw the film, I just felt them all. Lewis Ayres (Paul Baumer) and Louis Wolheim (Kat Katczinsky) were excellent, and Lewis Ayres gave one of the best performances ever in screen history. The journey with him was endearing and heartbreaking. How the story behind the film was constructed made me to find All Quiet on the Western Front much more preferable over Grand Illusion. I could understand why the Nazis forced the bonfire of the book All Quiet on the Western Front because of its defeating message that war is useless and trivially pointless. Had the Germans saw the film and took it personal, World War II would have never happened. Sadly, that's not the case. All Quiet on the Western Front carries so much relevance as it does today, and an ounce of it will never be shed off as time wears on. I don't think I can add any more except for the fact that it's just a brilliant, brilliant...absolutely brilliant film.

63191,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,0783230435,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[1, 1]","The country is at war and Paul B&auml;umer (Lew Ayres) is in school. His instructor is proud that he is volunteering to protect his country. He and his classmates are off on an adventure. This adventure will challenge the way they look at life and in the process change our life outlook.On the surface this looks like a pacifist or anti war movie. One may think this has something to do with an enemy's view of war. Also there is a tendency pick the film apart because it is not the book.In reality this story is more of a, don't get over zealous movie. At least don't let some one mesmerize you. It even happened in a contemporary film ""Private Benjamin"" (1980). She was promised the army with the private condos. Again we see the zealous ones in ""Starship Troopers"" (1997) where the movie shows the romantic side of war.As far as the rating it is ridicules to compare a movie that has to pass censors and only has 130 minutes with the book. Naturally the book is going to be more thorough and descriptive. What we can compare it to is the original movie ""Westfront 1918"" (1930) directed by George Wilhelm Pabst (1885-1967) and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1979). Check them all out including the audiocassette of the book.The points are made much clearer in ""Westfront 1918"" even though is shorter it is the 5 star movie. Especially when we return to the schoolroom to see the teacher inspiring the next generation of students to become soldiers. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) however is easier to understand then ""West Front"". You can spend more time in the message and less on the translation from German. In either film the actual down time (between actions) drove me crazy as I remembered the time that we were not fighting or planning something in Viet Nam was when I got antsy. The 1979 movie is a boring TV type movie with ""Johnboy"" Richard Thomas, playing the part of Paul Baumer. The only good part is when he got shot.The film was shot in black and white but is still pretty graphic. It deserves to be seen on a big screen. At one point they also sing ""Watch on the Rein.""""Im Western Nichts Neues"" By Remarque: ""He fell in October 1918, on a day that was so quiet and still on the whole front, that the army report confined itself to the single sentence: All quiet on the western Front.""All Quiet on the Western FrontErich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)",5,In-depth look at war and peoples attitudes.,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2439,"['country', 'war', 'Paul', 'B', 'auml', 'umer', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'school', 'instructor', 'proud', 'volunteering', 'protect', 'country', 'classmates', 'are', 'off', 'adventure', 'adventure', 'will', 'challenge', 'way', 'look', 'life', 'process', 'change', 'life', 'surface', 'pacifist', 'anti', 'war', 'movie', 'One', 'may', 'think', 'something', 'do', 'enemy', 'view', 'war', 'Also', 'tendency', 'film', 'apart', 'not', 'book.In', 'reality', 'story', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'zealous', 'movie', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'one', 'mesmerize', 'even', 'happened', 'contemporary', 'film', 'Private', 'Benjamin', '1980', 'was', 'promised', 'army', 'private', 'condos', 'Again', 'see', 'zealous', 'ones', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '1997', 'where', 'movie', 'romantic', 'side', 'war.As', 'far', 'rating', 'ridicules', 'compare', 'movie', 'pass', 'censors', 'only', '130', 'minutes', 'book', 'Naturally', 'book', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'thorough', 'descriptive', 'What', 'can', 'compare', 'original', 'movie', 'Westfront', '1918', '1930', 'directed', 'George', 'Wilhelm', 'Pabst', '1885-1967', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '1979', 'Check', 'out', 'including', 'audiocassette', 'book.The', 'points', 'are', 'made', 'much', 'clearer', 'Westfront', '1918', 'even', 'shorter', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'Especially', 'when', 'return', 'schoolroom', 'see', 'teacher', 'inspiring', 'next', 'generation', 'students', 'become', 'soldiers', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '1930', 'however', 'easier', 'understand', 'then', 'West', 'Front', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'message', 'less', 'translation', 'German', 'film', 'actual', 'down', 'time', 'actions', 'drove', 'crazy', 'remembered', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'fighting', 'planning', 'something', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'was', 'when', 'got', 'antsy', '1979', 'movie', 'boring', 'TV', 'type', 'movie', 'Johnboy', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'playing', 'part', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'when', 'got', 'shot.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'still', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'point', 'also', 'sing', 'Watch', 'Rein', 'Im', 'Western', 'Nichts', 'Neues', 'Remarque', 'fell', 'October', '1918', 'day', 'was', 'so', 'quiet', 'still', 'whole', 'front', 'army', 'report', 'confined', 'single', 'sentence', 'quiet', 'western', 'Front', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'FrontErich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Bloom', 'Modern', 'Critical', 'Interpretations']",N/A

A group of eager German students enlist for service in World War I, heedless of warnings from their professors and families. These guys are just itching to be heroes, and the army propaganda has promised them that they will be. The cinematic ballet of war scenes is unlike anything cinema had seen before, and the realism of war in this film is completely at odds with the candy-coloured beauty of propaganda films made a decade later.

63195,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,0783230435,Bill Hensler,"[100, 108]","This reviewer give this move 5 stars.  It is actually 10 out of 10.Some people will say the movie's black and white color is distracting.  This the Great War we are watching.  Only the paintings were color.  Color photography was not invented yet.  So it actually enhances the feel of the movie.This movie is a great.  It completely captures what trench warfare was like.  It was a muddy, miserable life with rats and little food.  Somebody was always shooting at you.  That is trench warfare.The basic plot is about a school student, Paul, who is convinced by his school teacher to join and fight with the army in 1915.  The class enlists in mass, goes through training together, and then march off to fight at the Western front.The movie is like chapters in a book.  Most Americans don't understand what old Germany was like.  Old Germany was a land of Christian values.  The Kaiser (translation:  the emperor) was seen as a direct official working under God's blessing.  The family of Germany was the center of society.  All students were good in school or properly learned their jobs.  They obeyed their parents and the Church.  Old Germany was quite highly though of in pre-WWI America.The fact that Paul was in high school (gymnasium)  proves he was an exceptional student.  In Germany the poorly performing students are sent to trade school.  Paul's being in gymnasium proves he is one of the more intellectually advanced students.Yes, this movie is shot in America.  However, the sets look like they were made in old Europe.  There are cobblestone roads, the signs are in German, the writing on the chalk board is in old German script, and the soldiers sing German folk tunes.  The movie is like a time machine to another age.  Even a graveyard looks like a European graveyard, not American.  The technical lenghts this movie goes through is nearly boundless.The shown German basic training was quite realistic.  Why?  An American army unit would band together people from all over the nation.  Strength through diversity and all that.  Germany was much more realistic.  They had training centers in every ""state"".  This had advantages in training because the Germans started with a much more heterogeneous group and later subordinated the unit to a greater good, such as their division.  In America there are racial, regional (like Texas vs New York), and religious problems which never were worked out in WWI or WWII.  Thus Paul and his group are much more worried about their Oberfreiter (sergeant) and conforming to the norms of their assigned army unit than a likewise American unit would be during that time period.  So, Paul's unit training as a cohort is quite correct.And Paul's unit joining the front lines is quite realistic.  They go from being a group of trainees to veterans very fast after being caught in an artillery bombardment.  The wire laying detail is quite correct. When Corporal Katczinsky is smoking his pipe watching the operation that's correct.  Pipes don't have the glow of a cigarette at night time, the walls of the pipe mask the burning.The technical details on this movie are fantastic.  The soldiers actually eat at a real German food kitchen.  The Soldier's equipment is what the Imperial German Army actually wore in the war.  The European villages are quite convincing sets.  The artillery bombardments look so good that out takes of the scenes are used in other war movies.  Take note of this, the German Army in WWI and WWII did not do a very good job of feeding their soldiers.  The German army felt a well fed soldier would not want to fight.  The logic was the famished German soldiers would at least raid the enemies lines for food.  In real life the underfed Germans had to loot the locals.  They were all starving.  This leads up to a very strong scene with some French girls.Another underrated scene is inside of the German Bier Garten (bar).  The sausage, pickles, and snacks the Germans ate was quite accurate.  The posters on the wall are all quite correct for the period.  The German soldiers are all singing a happy German beer drinking song.  I loved this snapshot of old Germany.The friendship between Paul and Katczinsky is quite believable.  Katczinsky is a working man from Eastern Germany.  Paul is a soon-to-be-playwright.  However, these two divergent characters soon develop a strong friendship almost immediately.This movie closely follows the book, but not exactly.  The movie didn't have the time.Now, as a child this reviewer was taught that the Great War, WWI, was not that significant.  Actually, it's the most significant war of the 20th Century.  It is the start of a 20 year period of warfare in Europe, with some minor breaks, that ends with Soviet troops standing in the pulverized rubble of Berlin.Everything is gone by 1945.  The royalty of Europe is destroyed (You think Prince Charles is in the same League as King George?).  The families are shattered by war.  The land is laid waste.  The Christian faith went from over 95% church attendance to less than 10% in less than 60 years:  the wars destroyed the faith in King, Country, and God.  Europe was the pearl of Western Civilization in 1910.  By 1945 millions were dead and Europe was reduced to a minor player in the world stage.The movie is an analog of real life.  The best that Western civilization can offer is destroyed and all that exists in the end is destruction and death.This is a must see movie.  It should be part of every military historians library.",5,One of the first war movies is still one of the best,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,5501,"['reviewer', 'give', 'move', '5', 'stars',

It ranks as one of the classics of all time, and is a stunning display of the horrors of war.  The story is told from an interesting aspect--that of World War I Germany.  It tells of a young group of school boys who, through the efforts of their over-zealous teacher and other 'patriots', are persuaded to enlist in the army.  Once the group gets to the field however, they quickly learn that it is nothing like they imagined.The film is very effective in showing that war is not a solution to any problem.  The main character, Paul (played by Lew Ayres) is especially affected, as he watches his fellow classmates fall to the brutality of conflict.  After he spends a night in a hole with a dying Frenchman (whose mortal wound was inflicted by Paul), he begins to realize that soldiers are just pawns, tools in an intense political campaign.One of the most moving aspects of the film is to see the desensitization of Paul, and his subsequent alienation from those at home.  When Paul is sent home because of an injury, he finds no peace, and, in a state of unrest, yearns to return to the front.  He becomes disgusted with his former teacher, as well as a group of men in a bar, who promote the war and give their opinions of it's outcome, all the while talking of the immense 'sacrifices' they are called upon to make to support it.  Paul, who sees their hypocrisy, yearns to be back among his comrades of the war.This movie is a very effective stand against war.  The message it gives is as potent now as it was over 70 years ago.",5,The definitive war (or anti-war) movie that started it all!,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,1653,"['time', 'see', 'good', 'war', 'movie', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'one', 'aspect', 'was', 'derived', 'film', 'one', 'classics', 'time', 'stunning', 'display', 'horrors', 'war', 'story', 'told', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'World', 'War', 'Germany', 'young', 'group', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'efforts', 'over-zealous', 'teacher', 'other', ""'patriots"", 'are', 'persuaded', 'enlist', 'army', 'group', 'field', 'however', 'quickly', 'learn', 'nothing', 'imagined.The', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'showing', 'war', 'not', 'solution', 'problem', 'main', 'character', 'Paul', 'played', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'especially', 'affected', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'fall', 'brutality', 'conflict', 'night', 'hole', 'dying', 'Frenchman', 'mortal', 'wound', 'was', 'inflicted', 'Paul', 'realize', 'soldiers', 'are', 'just', 'pawns', 'tools', 'intense', 'political', 'campaign.One', 'most', 'moving', 'aspects', 'film', 'see', 'desensitization', 'Paul', 'subsequent', 'alienation', 'home', 'When', 'Paul', 'sent', 'home', 'injury', 'peace', 'state', 'unrest', 'return', 'front', 'disgusted', 'former', 'teacher', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'men', 'bar', 'who', 'promote', 'war', 'give', 'opinions', 'outcome', 'talking', 'immense', ""'sacrifices"", 'are', 'called', 'make', 'support', 'Paul', 'who', 'hypocrisy', 'be', 'back', 'comrades', 'war.This', 'movie', 'very', 'effective', 'stand', 'war', 'message', 'potent', 'now', 'was', '70', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
63197,AO4WFALWQYTW0,0783230435,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[4, 5]","Volunteering in WWI must not have been dissimilar to the views teenagers now have about Hollywood, and its offered excessive lifestyle. As this war rages on, teachers deceive these German teens of the benefits of war, and their innocent visualization of the war is much more grand and eclectic than the blind patriot's vision of success in battle. The instructor's bellowing statements about war send such excitement in these inexperienced teenager's hearts that they suddenly picture themselves in full army gear, riding in a car with the most beautiful of women. Not far from the school, the often snapped at postman, Himmelstoss, reveals that he will be leaving his job for the army-transitioning from this menial job to a sergeant. As these teens amazement of war and its ""luxuries"" increases, the entire class enlists in the army.Their dreams of army life are quickly crushed as postman Himmelstoss, now Sergeant Himmelstoss, enforces strict discipline that puts the army life in perspective for the boys. As they progress to the battlefield and view the hardships, such as hunger, depression, and bombardment, they fully come to grip with the realities of war. As these young men's fate is clearly shown, we view each of their tragedies, the death of a few, the survival of the rest, and the incompatibility of these survivors in relating to their prior environment, friends, and families.All Quiet on The Western Front is the truest form of condemnation of an issue on film. It very cleverly skews its direction away from condemning any nation, and rather admonishes the act of engaging in war. This is a tactic that earlier, and later, films did employ; however, this film's adamancy in establishing its philosophy has been imitated, but never bettered. There is not one single second of the film which it halts its mission of condemning the men behind war. In one particularly effective scene, one soldier wonders how WWI began, and who was responsible for its onset. As this scene progresses, one of the soldiers says that he does not hate the enemy as he has never before met an Englishman or a Russian, and in retrospect they most likely have never before met a German. The Brutality of war is effectively implied in this very scene. The reason soldiers kill is not due to any internal disposition toward violence, but rather because men do more evils to men they are unfamiliar with, especially if they are of another nationality, which they may not be able to relate to, due to the language and cultural barrier. Interestingly, the film even discounts such a view, which it seemed to propose in the first half of the film. After the main character, Paul, finally commits a crime on the battlefield-though cold-blooded war enthusiasts may not regard it as a crime-he pleads to the fallen soldier to stand up, to speak, or at to forgive him. As he searches through the man's pockets, he finds a picture of his wife and child, and pleads that for forgiveness; but, the lifeless corpse lacks the will to respond. Back at the base, the other commanders moralize with Paul, and as expected agree that in war such tenderness toward the enemy will eventually disappear.The film does not even attempt to condemn the savage Himmelstoss whose new found glory has transformed him in to another person. He may be presented as a cruel man who has lost touch with himself and has transformed himself to a lowly authoritarian, but in reality his possibly achievable respect in this new position, in addition to his authority over dozens of young men, has made him oblivious to the true nature of his actions-and the abomination that his actions presents in the young men. Himmelstoss does not escape the wrath of these young men for long, and they eventually do avenge themselves against his senseless superiority which on the battlefield seems frivolous. In these instances, we begin to have sympathy as his need for affirmation becomes clear, and we pity him and our disgust is washed away. The distaste of the film centers on war, as if war was a criminal who could be executed. It wants to chock it, to shame it, to despise its success (at times) in the economic department, and to sentence this abomination to death. The film is intrigued in dealing with war not as a concept, but as a being, one that can be condemned, sentenced, and eventually hung.As Paul temporarily returns home, he sees that the dangers of the battlefield were tolerable compared to the different ideologies of the men of his childhood. Everyone from his father to the old Professor contends that the German's can push into Paris, and conquer them. It shows that not only did they lack the understanding of war back then, but that they still are oblivious to its harm. The sad truth is that men of the battlefield, especially during the two World Wars, are unable to return home because a considerable amount of their memories and friendships-along with their hardships and laughter-occurred on the field, making life difficult to adapt to; especially for these men who left organized society during the early years of their adulthood. The film leaves itself open to some criticism by portraying Germans with an American cast; however, it is not the language or accents that deters in turning this film into the classic it deserves to be. The interest in philosophical dialogue on the nature of war, emotions, honesty, and singular focus makes All Quiet on The Western Front one of the boldest anti-war film in memory.",5,Let us all

Told from the German perspective, it is the harshly realistic account of what life was like in the trenches of WW I. Lew Ayres enlists with the rest of his school class, and one by one they're knocked off until he's the only one left. Just before 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, while sitting in a trench, he sees a butterfly; he reaches out to touch it and is gunned down - all we see is his hand going limp as the movie ends. It's one of the great scenes in screen history.The picture contains many powerful scenes depicting the horrors of war, but perhaps most horrible of all is how dehumanized Ayres becomes, especially in the scene in which he goes home on leave to visit his mother: all his sensibilities have been so shattered that it's like he's visiting another planet.

Coloured posters of the performances are still sticking on a hoarding.  With wide eyes Kropp and I stand in front of it.  We can hardly credit that such things still exist.  A girl in a light summer dress, with a red patent-leather belt about her hips!"" After some more description of this girl, the narrator continues---in these words from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"": ""The girl on the poster is a wonder to us.  We have quite forgotten that there are such things, and even now we hardly believe our eyes.  We have seen nothing like it for years, nothing like it for happiness, beauty and joy.""  In the film, of course, this is replaced by the poster itself; for we get to see it as well.  Which do you think is more effective in conveying the longing of these soldiers, a simple poster of a girl, or the words (as indicated) above?  I don't think there is any question which is more successful.  Some things are better left unseen, even in films, I'd argue.  The scene in the film would have been much more effective if, say, we got the details from one or two of the soldiers, perhaps sitting around having a drink, describing it to the others.  Such would draw us into what they were feeling.  Instead we see a picture for a few moments and then the scene changes & we carry nothing from the scene with us as the film progresses.  This is not the only example of such herein either.  In short, what I am suggesting is that the book is far more effective than this film.  Big surprise, you say---most films in this category are inferior to the lauded books on which they are based.  I'd agree.  I'm just saying that you will not get anywhere near the effect of this book by just watching this film. There ought to be two categories for famous books brought to the screen: those that are complementary, ie., can be either read or seen (or both) without detracting from the work on which it is based, and those that cannot.  ""All Quiet on the Western Front, I'd suggest, falls into the latter category, but at least I'd hope that you'd invest the few hours it takes to read this book first---borrow it from your library, say---before instinctively looking to give me negative feedback simply because I'm not chiming in with a review of this film that, perhaps, simply reinforces your previously held predilections.

This movie was made just 12 years after WW1, so we can watch it today with complete confidence in knowing that it gets things right on the mark, not only technically but emotionally as well. The further we get from historic events, the more apt we are to embellish them with our current perceptions. Not so here. ALL QUIET was made by the generation that remembered the war when it happened, and that first hand awareness is what makes the film so honest and true to life. Filled with indelible imagery, it's still, for me, the greatest war film ever made.This latest Blu-ray/DVD restoration of ALL QUIET from Universal is fantastic, with practically perfect picture and audio quality - especially for an 82 year old film. The only extras worth mentioning is the rarely seen silent version with an original 1930 music and sound effects track, and a beautiful book/disc case illustrated with many posters, lobby cards and stills. A making of documentary and commentary track would've been appropriate for such a landmark film.My one complaint about the book is that it misidentifies two of the actors' photos: Richard Alexander's photo is passed for John Wray, and a photo of an actor who looks like it could be Wray sans the moustache he wears in the film stands in for William Bakewell - it's definitely not Bakewell. This is just plain sloppy research, and it takes a little bit away from making this a totally perfect presentation of an undisputed classic. Of course, none of these oversights prevent me from recommending this edition since it's the fine quality of the film itself that counts.",5,ALWAYS  POWERFUL AND MOVING,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,1742,"['Universal', '1930', 'production', 'ALL', 'QUIET', 'ON', 'THE', 'WESTERN', 'FRONT', 'as', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'harsh', 'realities', 'war', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'just', '12', 'years', 'WW1', 'can', 'watch', 'today', 'complete', 'confidence', 'knowing', 'things', 'right', 'mark', 'not', 'only', 'technically', 'emotionally', 'as', 'well', 'further', 'get', 'historic', 'events', 'more', 'apt', 'are', 'embellish', 'current', 'perceptions', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'QUIET', 'was', 'made', 'generation', 'remembered', 'war', 'when', 'happened', 'first', 'hand', 'awareness', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'honest', 'true', 'life', 'Filled', 'indelible', 'imagery', 'still', 'greatest', 'war', 'film', 'ever', 'made.This', 'latest', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'restoration', 'ALL', 'QUIET', 'Universal', 'fantastic', 'practically', 'perfect', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'especially', '82', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'only', 'extras', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'rarely', 'seen', 'silent', 'version', 'original', '1930', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'track', 'beautiful', 'book/disc', 'case', 'illustrated', 'many', 'posters', 'lobby', 'cards', 'stills', 'making', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'appropriate', 'such', 'landmark', 'film.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'book', 'two', 'actors', 'photos', 'Richard', 'Alexander', 'photo', 'passed', 'John', 'Wray', 'photo', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Wray', 'moustache', 'film', 'William', 'Bakewell', 'definitely', 'not', 'Bakewell', 'just', 'plain', 'sloppy', 'research', 'little', 'bit', 'away', 'making', 'totally', 'perfect', 'presentation', 'undisputed', 'classic', 'course', 'none', 'oversights', 'prevent', 'recommending', 'edition', 'fine', 'quality', 'film']",N/A

The full-flowering of Hollywood, bringing escapist entertainment to a world gripped by the Great Depression.Many great movies were made in the 1930's.The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition),Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition),Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition),The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)were all great films from the late 1930's, which many people have refered to as the best time for cinema.But the early 1930's, though often overlooked by modern audiences, contains such wonderful films asM - 2 Disc Special Edition (Criterion Collection Spine #30), ""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"" and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".This film won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1930. It's well-deserved. The movie plot follows basically the same plot as the novel; centering around a group of young German soldiers going on the grand adventure of war. Whipped into a patriotic frenzy, they enlist, head to the front, and start dropping like flies.The movie beautifully encapsulates the horror of war. The acting (particularly from Lew Ayres in the staring role), writing and directing are all top-notch. Put the film in color, and it could almost be a movie from this era, rather than one that's almost 80 years old.The DVD version of this movie is... well, nothing to write home about. Not too many extras, though the comments from Robert Osborne are welcome. No chapter selection for some odd reason, but otherwise... it's ok.Modern audiences don't really know too much about World War One. It's a largely forgotten war in our national conciousness. As I write this, we're 89 years out from the start of the war. Further, according to Wikipedia's ""Surviving Veterans of World War One"", as of December 8th, 2007 there's only 22 veterans left world-wide. Twenty-two. That's it. Six less than when I originally wrote this review, and almost certainly several more than we'll have by next year. Only three of the veterans left are from the USA.If for no other reason than expanding your knowledge about this horrible, meaningless, stupid war, I strongly recommend this movie.As a side note: if Universal still owns the rights to the novel, they need to be pressured to make a new version of this film in time for the 100th anniversary of the start of the war. Get the young teeny-bopper/teen-idol actors of our era (the Zac Effrons of the world), and let modern audiences see the beauty of youth twisted by war.It's a lesson no one should ever forget.",5,The brutal poetry of war,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,2603,"['Ah', '1930', 'first', 'full', 'decade', 'sound', 'pictures', 'advent', 'Technicolor', 'full-flowering', 'Hollywood', 'bringing', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'world', 'gripped', 'Great', 'Depression.Many', 'great', 'movies', 'were', 'made', ""1930's.The"", 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Four-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'Disney', 'Special', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Three-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'were', 'great', 'films', 'late', '1930', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'refered', 'best', 'time', 'cinema.But', 'early', '1930', 'though', 'often', 'overlooked', 'modern', 'audiences', 'contains', 'such', 'wonderful', 'films', 'asM', '2', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Spine', '30', 'Frankenstein', 'Dracula', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '.This', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '1930', 'well-deserved', 'movie', 'plot', 'basically', 'same', 'plot', 'novel', 'centering', 'group', 'young', 'German', 'soldiers', 'going', 'grand', 'adventure', 'war', 'Whipped', 'patriotic', 'frenzy', 'enlist', 'head', 'front', 'start', 'dropping', 'flies.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'horror', 'war', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'staring', 'role', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Put', 'film', 'color', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'movie', 'era', 'rather', 'one', 'almost', '80', 'years', 'old.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'well', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'extras', 'comments', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'are', 'welcome', 'chapter', 'selection', 'odd', 'reason', 'otherwise', 'ok.Modern', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'war', 'national', 'conciousness', 'write', ""'re"", '89', 'years', 'start', 'war', 'Further', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'Surviving', 'Veterans', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'December', '8th', '2007', 'only', '22', 'veterans', 'left', 'world-wide', 'Twenty-two', 'Six', 'less', 'when', 'originally', 'wrote', 'review', 'almost', 'certainly', 'several', 'more', ""'ll"", 'have', 'next', 'year', 'Only', 'three', 'veterans', 'left', 'are', 'USA.If', 'other', 'reason', 'expanding', 'knowledge', 'horrible', 'meaningless', 'stupid', 'war', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie.As', 'side', 'note', 'Universal', 'still', 'rights', 'novel', 'need', 'be', 'pressured', 'make', 'new', 'version', 'film', 'time', '100th', 'anniversary', 'start', 'war', 'Get', 'young', 'teeny-bopper/teen-idol', 'actors', 'era', 'Zac', 'Effrons', 'world', 'let', 'modern', 'audiences', 'see', 'beauty', 'youth', 'twisted', 'war.It', 'lesson', 'one', 'should', 'ever', 'forget']",N/A

63206,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0783230435,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[32, 37]","For a movie in the 1930's, Lewis Milestone's adaptation of All Quiet On The Western Front, based on Erich Maria Remarque's novel, follows the book reasonably well.  However, rather than starting with the soldiers lining up to get the cook Ginger's stew per the novel (that part comes later), it starts with Paul Baumer's school teacher telling him and his fellow students that they are the light of the Fatherland, the iron men of Germany, the brave heroes who will repulse the enemies when called to do so.  In other words, he's exhorting them to enlist, which they do, pressed into patriotism in what was initially thought to have been a quick war with small losses.From the start, the recruits are eager to get into uniform and to the front, and are puzzled by the behaviour of burned-out experienced soldiers like Tjaden and Kat.  This latter, a large, pleasantly ugly man has a knack for scrounging for food and finding enough for the group, and soon, all the recruits stick with and respect this man, especially after their first bombardment.  When one of the recruits realizes he has wet his trousers, Kat tells him not to worry about it, as it's happened to better men.The stages of attacking, the bombardment, attack, counterattack, and repulse, is presented in graphic detail for that period, with the shots of men dying by artillery shells, being bayoneted, or machine-gunned.  Some recruits go crazy waiting in the bunker during the bombardment, and one of them rushes outside, only to get cut down by bullets.  And the aftermath isn't pretty for some.  Franz Kemmerich ends up in the infirmary and has his leg amputated.  From the grueling experience of phantom limb pain to the realization that one has lost his limb, the greed of some like Muller who wants Franz's nice boots, to the unconcern of the doctors who see Franz's death as another free bed, war is hell.War changes people's perspectives.  Paul fights and stabs a French soldier at close quarters in a foxhole, and he pleads and apologizes to the dying man, telling him that without these uniforms, they could be friends, and promising to write to his wife.  And on leave, Paul is clearly alienated from the older civilians who have no clue that war has burned out his soul, and just keep telling him to give those Frenchies a licking and push on to Paris.  I'd go for Tjaden's solution to war:  get the politicians and generals wearing just their underpants into a big field and fight it out with clubs.  But the discussion of the soldiers yields something still relevant:  manufacturers want a war to sell more arms.The subplot involving the butterflies is new, but the shot of the soldier reaching for the butterfly before being shot by a sniper symbolizes a soldier's whose burned out soul is suddenly heartened as seeing something beautiful, and suddenly thus illuminated within, reaches toward it.All Quiet On The Western Front deservedly went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in the US.  However, Joseph Goebbels' antics in Berlin demonstrates how Germany was in a state of war denial.  The incident at a theatre of the second night showing of the movie involved Goebbels' men starting disturbances and yelling anti-Semitic epithets that resulted in the film's termination after ten minutes.  Goebbels hadn't even seen the film;  he merely wanted to demonstrate Nazi power in Berlin and discredit Albert Grzesinski, Prussia's Interior Minister who was a Social Democrat.  When the film was banned by the Board of Censors because it ""endangered Germany's image abroad"", the headlines of Goebbels' newspaper Der Angriff (German for The Attack) read ""Grzesinski Defeated.""One of the few war films I'll watch due to its pacifist message, denouncing the glorification of war.  The prologue at the movie's beginning, taken from Remarque's book, says it all:  this story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all, an adventure.  For death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.  It will try simply to tell of a generation of men, who even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.",5,A generation of men destroyed by war,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,4143,"['movie', '1930', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'adaptation', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'based', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'novel', 'book', 'reasonably', 'well', 'However', 'rather', 'starting', 'soldiers', 'lining', 'up', 'get', 'cook', 'Ginger', 'stew', 'novel', 'part', 'later', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'school', 'teacher', 'telling', 'fellow', 'students', 'are', 'light', 'Fatherland', 'iron', 'men', 'Germany', 'brave', 'heroes', 'who', 'will', 'repulse', 'enemies', 'when', 'called', 'do', 'so', 'other', 'words', 'exhorting', 'enlist', 'do', 'pressed', 'patriotism', 'what', 'was', 'initially', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'quick', 'war', 'small', 'losses.From', 'start', 'recruits', 'are', 'eager', 'get', 'uniform', 'front', 'are', 'puzzled', 'behaviour', 'burned-out', 'experienced', 'soldiers', 'Tjaden', 'Kat', 'latter', 'large', 'pleasantly', 'ugly', 'man', 'knack', 'scrounging', 'food', 'finding', 'enough', 'group', 'soon', 'recruits', 'stick', 'respect', 'man', 'especially', 'first', 'bombardment', 'When', 'one', 'recruits', 'wet', 'trousers', 'Kat', 'not', 'worry', 'happened', 'better', 'men.The', 'stages', 'attacking', 'bombardment', 'attack', 'counterattack', 'repulse', 'presented', 'graphic', 'detail', 'period', 'shots', 'men', 'dying', 'artillery', 'shells', 'being', 'bayoneted', 'machine-gunned', 'recruits', 'go', 'crazy', 'waiting', 'bunker', 'bombardment', 'one', 'rushes', 'outside', 'only', 'get', 'cut', 'down', 'bullets', 'aftermath', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'Franz', 'Kemmerich', 'up', 'infirmary', 'leg', 'amputated', 'grueling', 'experience', 'phantom', 'limb', 'pain', 'realization', 'one', 'lost', 'limb', 'greed', 'like', 'Muller', 'who', 'Franz', 'nice', 'boots', 'unconcern', 'doctors', 'who', 'see', 'Franz', 'death', 'free', 'bed', 'war', 'hell.War', 'changes', 'people', 'perspectives', 'Paul', 'fights', 'stabs', 'French', 'soldier', 'close', 'quarters', 'foxhole', 'dying', 'man', 'telling', 'uniforms', 'could', 'be', 'friends', 'promising', 'write', 'wife', 'leave', 'Paul', 'clearly', 'alienated', 'older', 'civilians', 'who', 'have', 'clue', 'war', 'burned', 'out', 'soul', 'just', 'keep', 'telling', 'give', 'Frenchies', 'licking', 'push', 'Paris', ""'d"", 'go', 'Tjaden', 'solution', 'war', 'get', 'politicians', 'generals', 'wearing', 'just', 'underpants', 'big', 'field', 'fight', 'out', 'clubs', 'discussion', 'soldiers', 'yields', 'something', 'still', 'relevant', 'manufacturers', 'want', 'war', 'sell', 'more', 'arms.The', 'subplot', 'involving', 'butterflies', 'new', 'shot', 'soldier', 'reaching', 'butterfly', 'being', 'shot', 'sniper', 'soldier', 'burned', 'out', 'soul', 'suddenly', 'heartened', 'seeing', 'something', 'beautiful', 'suddenly', 'thus', 'illuminated', 'it.All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'deservedly', 'went', 'win', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'US', 'However', 'Joseph', 'Goebbels', 'antics', 'Berlin', 'how', 'Germany', 'was', 'state', 'war', 'denial', 'incident', 'theatre', 'second', 'night', 'showing', 'movie', 'involved', 'Goebbels', 'men', 'starting', 'disturbances', 'yelling', 'anti-Semitic', 'epithets', 'resulted', 'film', 'termination', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Goebbels', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'merely', 'wanted', 'demonstrate', 'Nazi', 'power', 'Berlin', 'discredit', 'Albert', 'Grzesinski', 'Prussia', 'Interior', 'Minister', 'who', 'was', 'Social', 'Democrat', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'Board', 'Censors', 'endangered', 'Germany', 'image', 'abroad', 'headlines', 'Goebbels', 'newspaper', 'Der', 'Angriff', 'German', 'Attack', 'read', 'Grzesinski', 'Defeated', 'One', 'few', 'war', 'films', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'due', 'pacifist', 'message', 'denouncing', 'glorification', 'war', 'prologue', 'movie', 'beginning', 'taken', 'Remarque', 'book', 'story', 'accusation', 'confession', 'least', 'adventure', 'death', 'not', 'adventure', 'who', 'stand', 'face', 'face', 'will', 'try', 'simply', 'tell', 'generation', 'men', 'who', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'escaped', 'shells', 'were', 'destroyed', 'war']",N/A

The bright-eyed enthusiasm and esprit de corps of the youthful recruits is relentlessly ground down under the weight of bombardments, starvation, grime, bloodshed and indifference.  As the film's hero, Paul, declares in his famous speech at the film's end, dying for one's country isn't glorious -- ""it's dirty and it's painful.""  Beautifully shot in black and white, this film slowly, mercilessly, artfully rachets up the tension, with battle scenes and psychological dramas that are literally and figuratively gut-wrenching.  This celebrated film, made a decade after the end of the First World War, summed up the disillusioning pall the war cast upon its generation with much the same cathartic power as the movie ""Platoon"" would, more than half a century later.  It's pretty strong stuff, surprisingly so for the time; an early talkie, it suffers soundwise in scenes with dialogue, but is crushingly powerful in its use of battlefield sound effects.

63210,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,0783230435,Dusty,"[1, 2]","I have to confess that I'm just stunned after watching All Quiet on the Western Front for the first time. I was expecting a good, perhaps even a great, war film. What I didn't expect was one of the first talkie films in history making such a profound statement about the sheer horror and pointlessness of war, without appearing naive in terms of filmmaking, in the process.I previously thought that no war film could make a greater impact than the D-Day landing scene in Saving Private Ryan. Now I stand corrected. I am confident that many extras were injured while filming the battle scenes for AQOTWF. Apart from all explosions taking place a fair distance away from actors, and a couple of very effective special effects, this film relied on excruciating physical exertion to make it's point. It didn't look choreographed; it looked like a truly brutal free-for-all that could easily have ended tragically for anyone being filmed. Disbelief was easily suspended; I thought I was watching soldiers, not actors. In fact, until I read other reviews afterwards, I suspected that the director had recruited real World War I veterans to star in this film. They were that convincing. You could see it in their eyes, and their faces.Case in point: watch the soldiers pile into the trenches to the point of suffocation, with bayonettes at the end of each rifle. I just can't imagine that scene being filmed safely, and along with some fantastic sound effects this is what made it seem even more real than Saving Private Ryan, where modern audiences were always aware that the only army Stephen Spielberg had at his disposal was comprised of choreographers, stunt men, make-up artists, special effects experts, doctors, and of course, lawyers.Despite a small amount of overacting, the only ""silliness"" in this film is the montage of exuberant, wild-eyed youths responding to their professor's call to waste their lives. And even then, it only seemed silly because the ludicrous anti-drug film Reefer Madness used a similar technique six years later, to show that pot instantly drives people to insanity. At the time AQOTWF was released, however, this scene probably had a much more serious impact, made even more sobering by the emergence of the Nazis, only a few years later.For such an early film, I was often reminded of Citizen Kane, for all of its attention to detail and inclusion of subtleties. For example, in the beginning, veterans don't even flinch as shells fall around them, while the new recruits immediately descend into hysteria. There was also a surprising degree of sexual innuendo for the day. The story and its impact would have suffered greatly if this had been restricted even further by puritans. In reality, trench soldiers were deprived for months or years, in many ways, and this film demonstrates that fact with authority. Just watch those soldiers make love to the pinup girl on the wall, and feel their loneliness and isolation, despite the camaraderie they shared amongst themselves.I also came away from this with an even greater appreciation for one of my favorite films of all time, Starship Troopers, which clearly borrowed heavily from AQOTWF. As a matter of fact, each film basically tells the same story, with a space age Johnny Rico in ST replacing a Victorian age Paul Baumer in AQOTWF.And although it's not necessary to repeat what so many others have said, I just can't neglect mentioning the unforgettable scene with the German soldier and the dying Allied soldier inside a shell crater. This was one of the most heart-wrenching things I have ever witnessed on film. When I saw the dead soldier's name on his papers, and the photo of his family... my God.... THIS is what a life wasted for the benefit of a handful of powerful people looks like. Suddenly it becomes clear why the Bush Administration prohibited the news media from filming American soldiers who returned home in coffins. After watching the crater scene, I could only ask myself, why did humans ever go to war again after this film was made?Without hesitation I recommend AQOTWF as a magnificent example of what film is capable of accomplishing when it's at its best. Indeed, the only thing that made me feel more grief for the human condition was later learning that AQOTWF is ranked as only the 215th greatest film of all time on the Internet Movie Database, with such vapid classics as Back to the Future (#97), Forrest Gump (#42), and Pulp Fiction (#5) beating it out by a long shot.That's when I realized, once again, why humans still go to war.",5,Absolutely

Being a milestone in Universal's 100 year celebration it called for a major restoration and it has received one. It is amazing what they have been able to do in bringing the image of this early sound masterpiece back to life. It is also thrilling to have the opportunity to view the silent release of this film. The silent version does include a sound track with a music score (there is no music in the sound version besides the titles) and sound effects. While this version could have been shown in theatres not yet wired for sound I think that it was also designed to be shown with the sound track in countries with a language other then English. The title cards would haft to be specific for each countries language but the film would still have the benefit of sounds of war as well as a music track. This print comes from The Library of Congress and is the sole Extra dealing with the film.

True, some of the sound effects are irritating, but there are some action scenes that are unsurpassed even today. Steven Spielberg even said that he was inspired partly by this movie while making ""Saving Private Ryan."" The parts that stand out for me are the over-the-top charges that resulted in massive loss of life, and one scene in particular when an explosion kills a soldier, but when the smoke clears you can see his hands are still gripping the barbed wire. With no body attached to them.So as far as the story goes, it's a pretty clear message: German teacher gives rousing patriotic speech to eager young students, they joyfully toss aside their books and march off to join the German Army to protect the fatherland. Then, when they actually get to the front and see what a colossal waste this war is, as their friends are killed one by one, reality sets in. The film followed one particular soldier, Paul, who gradually becomes more and more disillusioned and bitter with the war. He is horrified at having to kill an enemy soldier up close and in person, and actually tries to nurse him along and prevent him from dying. In the end, Paul is killed in the infamous ""butterfly scene,"" driving home once more the lesson of what a waste this war is.Interesting to note: before the film was banned in Nazi Germany, people were ""discouraged"" from viewing it.

If ever a film makes a strong case for war only as a very last resort, this one certainly ranks very highly indeed.  I had this on standard dvd and both the picture and sound qualities were terrible but I was able to forgive that at the time considering that it was released only 3 years after the very first talkie ""The Jazz Singer"" was released.  And so you can imagine my anticipation when I learned that a remastered version on 1080p Blu ray was going to be released and so I couldn't wait to pop the blu ray disc into my player when I first got this.Overall, this release is a mixed bag for me.  I like the digibook which is something I have always liked about blu rays and helps me to decide to double dip but I don't like the redundant standard dvd which makes the package unnecessarily bulky and is a waste as since I've upgraded to a Blu ray player, why the heck would I want a dvd?  The picture quality is a vast improvement over my previous standard dvd version but the sound quality is extremely noisy with tons of hiss which does distract a lot.  The BD-Live is useless because it really is just a vehicle for the studios to show you trailers of other films and this feature clearly has a lot of potential yet to be exploited.  The silent version of the film is a nice bonus.  Too bad the DTS 2 Channel Mono MA is so hissy during the spoken scenes and is certainly an area to be addressed before the inevitable next release.Still, on the strength of the vastly improved picture quality and the silent film bonus, this is probably the best version of the film that is currently out there.

Released shortly after sound was crawling its way through the art of motion pictures, it threw the whole world on its ear. Later on in the 1930's, Adolf Hitler decreed that the film not be shown in Nazi Germany, due to its &quot;defeatist&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic&quot; view of World War I, which Hitler fought in with some level of distinction. One could say that the dictator's dislike of the film ensures that it is a great film--and it is. Lew Ayres plays a young German man who is highly influenced by a teacher who sings the praises of the German military, which desperately needs young men to fight for &quot;the Fatherland.&quot; He finds out after extensive and grueling drilling by a haughty officer that glory in battle demands a high price. However, once in actual combat, he finds out the reality of war is so much different:it is actually undignified, uninspiring, frightening, and eventually demoralizing. For its time, the movie does a fantastic job of bringing across the horror of World War I, showing with heavy intensity the meat grinder battles in the slit trenches, the guilt that comes with killing your enemy in hand-to-hand combat, realizing he is a human being also; yet also displaying the boredom and fright of the beaten-down boys (who become men way too fast) in between battles. The end is very poignant and I will not play spoiler for those who haven't seen it, but it involves the butterfly you see on the cover of the tape/DVD. I take off points for the sorry condition of some of the scenes; occasionally, the dialogue is hard to hear and the scenes jump a bit. Still, these should not distract the viewer from taking in the message the film offers. I do not agree wholly with the message, but it presents a unique vision of war's cost in the lives of men in their prime.

Black and White movies are a tough sell for the teenagers in my class (as I found out today while airing ""Twelve Angry Men""), because they feel as if they're watching some exhibit in a museum, rather than an interpretation of the literature they have just read.  I know there is a more modern version of ""All Quiet"" starring Richard Thomas (and I actually remember watching it as a high school freshman), but given the choice between the original and the remake, I would opt for this (Lew Ayres) version.It's not that the remake is bad (In fact, it is quiet good);  it's just that the original is a classic, a masterpiece.  The cinematography is excellent.  Many scenes (No Man's Land; Bauer's teacher's recruitment lecture; the raw recruits marching off to the front; the ending) will remain etched into the memory of the viewer.  Just beautifully shot.  Great artistic feel to the movie.The acting is a bit flat by today's standards but that does not draw from the power or impact of the film.

Despite the technical limitations inherent in a film from 1930, this blu ray debut should disappoint no one who does acquire it, however. Both the picture and sound are the best they can be, but it is the supplementary material that really makes this release shine. A rare silent version from the Library of Congress is included, along with the biographical sketches (lead actor, Lew Ayres, was so moved by his filmaking experience that he became a conscientous objector during W.W. II, which damaged his subsequent Hollywood career) and re-release trailer that accompanied its DVD debut. In addition, there are brief documentary pieces from other sources that are unique to this package.

Based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel, the movie follows a group of patriotic German schoolboys as they are urged to enlist in World War I, and shows how their initially idealistic spirits are forever changed by the brutal reality of death and dismemberment, suffering and sorrow.  Beautifully acted by its entire cast (with special kudos going to Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, and Slim Summerville), the film also features some incredible special visual effects (those two detached hands clinging to the barbed wire fence never fail to shock) and some meticulously staged battle scenes that manage to put the viewer into the heart of the action.  Arthur Edeson's cinematography is often truly astonishing in its artistry; his visual choices are impeccable.  Worth a special note is the film's soundtrack; how incredible the terrible sounds of exploding ammunition must have seemed to audiences in 1930, who had first heard Al Jolson speak in 1927's part-talkie, ""The Jazz Singer""!  The very last sound effect in the film, which abruptly and startlingly leads to the close of the movie, is superbly executed and remains an innovative use of sound technology.The Universal DVD release of this film features a great sound transfer: on my six-speaker system, the rumbling explosions, staccato machine guns, and whizzing bullets sounded remarkably nearby.  Sadly, the visual transfer was sorely lacking; the source was plagued by jumps, scratches, lines, and breaks throughout the film, and the contrast was sometimes out-of-balance.  This cinematic masterpiece demands and deserves to be fully restored, and then remastered and rereleased on DVD. (Are you listening, Universal Home Video?)  The DVD extras include production notes; cast and director biographies and filmographies; and a Theatrical Trailer from one of the film's many reissues.  Warts and all, this DVD edition is definitely worth a look - the film's brilliance is such that it shines above and beyond this rather shoddy presentation.___________________________________________________________________________________*** 2011 UPDATE ***:  My original review was based on the first DVD release, which bears a 1999 copyright.  Apparently, the powers that be at Universal WERE listening to those of us that criticized this flawed DVD transfer.  I've recently purchased and watched the 2007 ""Universal Cinema Classics"" remastered version, which features an introduction by film historian and TCM host Robert Osborne, and was gratified to note that the video has been significantly improved.  Cheers to the team at Universal Studios for finally doing justice to this landmark film!

That, I don't agree with.The story is unhealthy.  That's why I'm giving it two stars.There is also a scene in it about sex during wartime.

After languishing for years in a stopgap DVD release that was difficult to hear and had terrible picture quality, this classic anti-war film has been restored by the Library of Congress and digitally remastered. The results are fantastic.Note: This review refers to the new Universal Cinema Classics release (black case with close-up of Lew Ayres), not some of the older releases (bluish monochrome case with a German helmet) which Amazon has seen fit to post this review on.Picture: Huge improvement. The previous release was dull, low-resolution, sometimes blurry, and reproduced lots and lots of distracting scratches and dirt from old reels. Now the picture is crisp, very sharp, and as clean as it has ever been.Sound: Another huge improvement. The 1930-vintage sound effects are still rather clunky and the dialogue is hard to understand once or twice, but overall the restoration is a phenomenal improvement. Very good.There are no special features to speak of, although the DVD does include a later, probably 1940s-era trailer and an introduction from Turner Classic Movies' resident film historian Robert Osborne. The restoration of the sound and image are the big selling points, here.The only negative thing I have to say is pretty trivial--there is no chapter menu. This is only a minor concern, though, and in no way detracts from the quality of the DVD or the film itself.

63233,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,0783230435,J. Richardson,"[0, 2]","I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front because my instructor for my history class informed me that it might be a useful form of research for a paper I had to write. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Still, I sat through the entire two hours and by the end of it I felt kind of conflicted. I've never been big on history, and WWI, to me, is such a generic topic. People look back on history and they usually think of WWI or WWII. That's fine, both are important events in history, but there is more to it than that. However, I'm getting off topic.All Quiet on the Western Front takes place at the beginning of WWI. We start in a German classroom where a school teacher is trying to rile up his class of young boys to join the war. Now, of course, he doesn't directly say ""you should join the war"", but he might as well have. As the movie progresses you follow this group of young men through their experience as a soldier. One by one they start to realize that war isn't all it's cracked up to be and one by one the viewer sees each of them die.For it's time I'm sure All Quiet on the Western Front was revolutionary, but by today's standards it's just ok. The story itself was very well written and kept me engaged throughout majority of the film. However, I do feel that it could've benefited from a shorter running time. There were a few scenes that were kind of boring and I kept checking the time to see if it was almost over. Thankfully, this only happened a handful of times, like three or four, so it didn't completely ruin the experience.The film's main goal was to inform the viewer on the horrors of war and, in this regard, it succeeded. Life as a soldier isn't easy and the writers made sure to constantly remind the viewer of this. Whether it was because of their cramped bunkers, their lack of food, or the frantic warfare, all these soldiers wanted to do was go back home. As the movie progressed you started feeling bad for these characters and even, in some cases, sympathetic.The movie has a pretty wide cast of recurring characters and, for the most part, the actors did a fine job at bringing them to life. Lew Ayres, who played one of the film's key characters Paul Baumer, did a phenomenal job and was definitely the standout of the cast. I look forward to checking out some of his other work. The film also includes performances by Richard Alexander, William Bakewell, and Slim Summerville, among others.Overall Score: 8/10 - As I stated earlier I'm not big on history, but All Quiet on the Western Front made for a pretty entertaining film. The story was well written and you eventually felt something for these characters. Some of the actors obviously outperformed the others, but none of them did such a poor job that it made the film unwatchable. If you're a fan of history, specifically WWI, then I would recommend giving this a go if you have a free evening.",4,8/10 - Good,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2890,"['recently', 'watched', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'instructor', 'history', 'class', 'informed', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'form', 'research', 'paper', 'had', 'write', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'Still', 'sat', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'end', 'felt', 'kind', 'conflicted', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'history', 'WWI', 'such', 'generic', 'topic', 'People', 'look', 'back', 'history', 'usually', 'think', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'fine', 'are', 'important', 'events', 'history', 'more', 'However', ""'m"", 'getting', 'off', 'topic.All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'place', 'beginning', 'WWI', 'start', 'German', 'classroom', 'where', 'school', 'teacher', 'trying', 'rile', 'up', 'class', 'young', 'boys', 'join', 'war', 'Now', 'course', ""n't"", 'directly', 'say', 'should', 'join', 'war', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'movie', 'follow', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'experience', 'soldier', 'One', 'one', 'start', 'realize', 'war', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'one', 'viewer', 'die.For', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'today', 'standards', 'just', 'ok', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'kept', 'engaged', 'majority', 'film', 'However', 'do', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'kind', 'boring', 'kept', 'checking', 'time', 'see', 'was', 'almost', 'Thankfully', 'only', 'happened', 'handful', 'times', 'three', 'four', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ruin', 'experience.The', 'film', 'main', 'goal', 'was', 'inform', 'viewer', 'horrors', 'war', 'regard', 'succeeded', 'Life', 'soldier', ""n't"", 'easy', 'writers', 'made', 'sure', 'constantly', 'remind', 'viewer', 'was', 'cramped', 'bunkers', 'lack', 'food', 'frantic', 'warfare', 'soldiers', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'movie', 'progressed', 'started', 'feeling', 'bad', 'characters', 'even', 'cases', 'sympathetic.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'wide', 'cast', 'recurring', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'film', 'key', 'characters', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'was', 'definitely', 'standout', 'cast', 'look', 'forward', 'checking', 'out', 'other', 'work', 'film', 'also', 'performances', 'Richard', 'Alexander', 'William', 'Bakewell', 'Slim', 'Summerville', 'others.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'stated', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'history', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'made', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'eventually', 'felt', 'something', 'characters', 'actors', 'obviously', 'outperformed', 'others', 'none', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'made', 'film', 'unwatchable', ""'re"", 'fan', 'history', 'specifically', 'WWI', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'go', 'have', 'free', 'evening']",N/A

Bernabo,"[3, 4]","""This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.""One of the things that is surprising about ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is not only that a German anti-war novel about the First World War was made into an Oscar-winning American motion picture, but that it happened so quickly.  ""Im Westen nichts Neues"" by Erich Maria Remarque (who had experienced the war first-hand as a young German soldier) was published in 1928, when it was serialized in the ""Vossische Zeitung,"" appeared in book form the next year in German and numerous other languages, became an immediate best-seller, and was filmed in 1930.  The story of Paul Baumer, an everyman who confronts the horrors of war and comes to the realization that such conflicts are futile.  The novel is also an indictment of any civilization that could allow itself to descend into a war and put its people through one.The idea is a powerful one and as such forgives the shortcomings of this 1930 film, most particularly the performance of Lew Ayers as Paul.  But it is his haunted likeness that looked out from the movie poster and continues to be the dominant image of the film preserved on the DVD case.  The film is faithful to the novel (Maxwell Anderson was one of the scriptwriters) and, more importantly, was given a big budget of $1.25 million by Universal Pictures, who hired 2,000 extras for the battle scenes.  However, unlike the book, which started with Paul in the trenches and had flashbacks, the film proceeds chronologically.We begin with young Paul, a schoolboy who is caught up with his friends in the war fever and who joins the army expecting a grand adventure.  Instead they find brutal discipline, enforced by the sadistic drill sergeant Himmelstoss (John Wray), who used to be the village postmaster.  When they get to the front there is the shock of being shelled, seeing friends die, and learning hard lessons about not risking your life for a corpse.  The showpiece of the film is a battle between the Germans and the French, involving some rather sophisticated camera techniques, which ends with dozens dead and the two armies right back where they started.  Everything else that happens in the film after that point just reinforces that brutal reality.  There is also a powerful montage involving a pair of boots that passes from one dead soldier to the next doomed comrade, a terrifying scene where Paul is trapped with a dying French solider in a shell hole, and an unforgettable epilogue""All Quiet on the Western Front"" won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for Lewis Milestone, working for the first time on a sound feature.  Of the early sound films this remains one of the most watchable, and even the grainy black & white photography lends appropriate pathos.  After all, there is not much difference between this what we see here and the film taken on the actual battlefields of WWI.  But more importantly there was an effort here to make a great film and even though acting in sound films was in its infancy they succeeded.",5,The classic Oscar-winning anti-war film from 1930,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,3127,"['story', 'accusation', 'confession', 'least', 'adventure', 'death', 'not', 'adventure', 'who', 'stand', 'face', 'face', 'One', 'things', 'surprising', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'not', 'only', 'German', 'anti-war', 'novel', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'made', 'Oscar-winning', 'American', 'motion', 'picture', 'happened', 'so', 'quickly', 'Im', 'Westen', 'nichts', 'Neues', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'who', 'had', 'experienced', 'war', 'first-hand', 'young', 'German', 'soldier', 'was', 'published', '1928', 'when', 'was', 'serialized', 'Vossische', 'Zeitung', 'appeared', 'book', 'form', 'next', 'year', 'German', 'numerous', 'other', 'languages', 'became', 'immediate', 'best-seller', 'was', 'filmed', '1930', 'story', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'everyman', 'who', 'horrors', 'war', 'realization', 'such', 'conflicts', 'are', 'futile', 'novel', 'also', 'indictment', 'civilization', 'could', 'allow', 'descend', 'war', 'put', 'people', 'one.The', 'idea', 'powerful', 'one', 'such', 'shortcomings', '1930', 'film', 'most', 'particularly', 'performance', 'Lew', 'Ayers', 'Paul', 'haunted', 'likeness', 'looked', 'out', 'movie', 'poster', 'be', 'dominant', 'image', 'film', 'preserved', 'DVD', 'case', 'film', 'faithful', 'novel', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'was', 'one', 'scriptwriters', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'given', 'big', 'budget', '1.25', 'million', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'who', 'hired', '2,000', 'extras', 'battle', 'scenes', 'However', 'book', 'started', 'Paul', 'trenches', 'had', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'proceeds', 'chronologically.We', 'begin', 'young', 'Paul', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'friends', 'war', 'fever', 'who', 'army', 'expecting', 'grand', 'adventure', 'Instead', 'find', 'brutal', 'discipline', 'enforced', 'sadistic', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'Himmelstoss', 'John', 'Wray', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'village', 'postmaster', 'When', 'get', 'front', 'shock', 'being', 'shelled', 'seeing', 'friends', 'die', 'learning', 'hard', 'lessons', 'not', 'risking', 'life', 'corpse', 'showpiece', 'film', 'battle', 'Germans', 'French', 'involving', 'rather', 'sophisticated', 'camera', 'techniques', 'dozens', 'dead', 'two', 'armies', 'right', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'Everything', 'else', 'film', 'point', 'just', 'reinforces', 'brutal', 'reality', 'also', 'powerful', 'montage', 'involving', 'pair', 'boots', 'one', 'dead', 'soldier', 'next', 'doomed', 'comrade', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'where', 'Paul', 'trapped', 'dying', 'French', 'solider', 'shell', 'hole', 'unforgettable', 'epilogue', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'working', 'first', 'time', 'sound', 'feature', 'early', 'sound', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'watchable', 'even', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'lends', 'appropriate', 'pathos', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'film', 'taken', 'actual', 'battlefields', 'WWI', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'effort', 'here', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'acting', 'sound', 'films', 'was', 'infancy', 'succeeded']",N/A

It was the beginning of the Depression, the use of sound in movies was new, and the feeling in the country was the WW1 had been the war to end all wars.  Now, 71 years later, the black and white film is scratchy, the gestures of the actors are over-exaggerated as if it were a silent film,  and the special effects of the battle scenes seem crude by today's standards.  In spite of all of this, however, this classic film brings its message home loud and clear.This is the story of the young German men who were recruited to serve in the war though tales of glory and patriotism.  What they find is death, fear, hunger and the meaningless slaughter of young men of the same generation who happen to be wearing different uniforms.  In spite of the technical constraints, the film manages to get it all.  We see the hospitals where overworked doctors amputate limbs, we see the men being attacked by rats as well as the enemy, we see the dirt in the trenches and are moved by the hand-to-hand combat which leaves a young German soldier, played by Lew Ayes, confined in a foxhole with a dying French soldier.I understand that the film was banned in Germany until after WW2 and I can certainly understand that it would have been counter to everything that happened next.  Through a historical context, this film was great, and its antiwar message a forerunner others to come.  There's a famous quote from the lips of one of the disheartened and weary soldiers when he says it all. &quot;Take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants and let 'em fight it out with clubs.

It won an Oscar for Best Picture in an era where people were still getting used to talking pictures. The movie presents an epic storyline, beautiful cinematography, and great acting.We begin with a group of young German students who are being exhorted by their teacher to drop their studies and head off into the German army. Soon they give in and join up. They have the ""traditional"" rough basic training, and then think they're destined for the glory of war. They realize quickly that war is anything but glorious. There is barely any food to eat. The shelling continues night and day. They are cold and exhausted. They watch their friends die.This might all seem almost cliche to us in modern times, but for many in 1930 it was the first time it was presented on the big screen, and shown in such detail. The movie was considered amazingly powerful. And even in modern times it has the power to stir emotion. The way the ""water torture"" of bombardment got to the men. The way the sight of food became so intensely moving.The movie is pretty much all about men. The soldiers run into three French women at one point, but the women are only interested in food, and one can guess what the soldiers are interested in. When one of the soldiers goes back home on break, he sees his mother and sister, but it's only briefly, and his primary thought is of getting back to help his friends.What makes the movie even more moving is that it's based on a true story. Erich Maria Remarque wrote a novel about his experiences, and that was then turned into a movie.Highly recommended as a fairly accurate look into what World War I was like, filmed in a time when it was fresh in the minds of those who took part in it.",5,War Movies All Source from This,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2119,"['have', 'countless', 'movies', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'talking', 'how', 'rough', 'wars', 'were', 'how', 'traumatized', 'soldiers', 'were', 'how', 'had', 'challenges', 'reintegrating', 'home', 'lives.They', 'have', 'roots', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'based', 'World', 'War', 'I.Released', '1930', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '54', 'ranking', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'groundbreaking', 'achievement', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'era', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'still', 'getting', 'used', 'talking', 'pictures', 'movie', 'epic', 'storyline', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'acting.We', 'begin', 'group', 'young', 'German', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'exhorted', 'teacher', 'drop', 'studies', 'head', 'off', 'German', 'army', 'Soon', 'give', 'join', 'up', 'have', 'traditional', 'rough', 'basic', 'training', 'then', 'think', ""'re"", 'destined', 'glory', 'war', 'realize', 'quickly', 'war', 'anything', 'glorious', 'barely', 'food', 'eat', 'shelling', 'night', 'day', 'are', 'cold', 'exhausted', 'watch', 'friends', 'die.This', 'might', 'seem', 'almost', 'cliche', 'modern', 'times', 'many', '1930', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'presented', 'big', 'screen', 'shown', 'such', 'detail', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'even', 'modern', 'times', 'power', 'stir', 'emotion', 'way', 'water', 'torture', 'bombardment', 'got', 'men', 'way', 'sight', 'food', 'became', 'so', 'intensely', 'moving.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'men', 'soldiers', 'run', 'three', 'French', 'women', 'one', 'point', 'women', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'food', 'one', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'soldiers', 'are', 'interested', 'When', 'one', 'soldiers', 'back', 'home', 'break', 'mother', 'sister', 'only', 'briefly', 'primary', 'thought', 'getting', 'back', 'help', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'wrote', 'novel', 'experiences', 'was', 'then', 'turned', 'movie.Highly', 'recommended', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'look', 'what', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'filmed', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'fresh', 'minds', 'who', 'took', 'part']",N/A
63241,A1FNW6H983I87V,0783230435,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[0, 0]","Based on the best selling novel of the same title by Erich Maria Remarque, it is based on his personal experience during WWI. But it is a story for all time, all nations and all wars. Just a reminder, that though the U.S. entered the war late, we still lost 120,000 soldiers in the waning months of the war. The film begins with German soldiers marching triumphantly through a German city with dozens of young women running up to hug and kiss the young men. As the camera pans back you see that you are looking through the windows of a university classroom out onto the streets. The older professor lecturing to the all male class begins to talk of patriotism and giving one's life for the Fatherland. Before long, the entire class (except one who reluctantly joins in later) is shouting and singing patriotic slogans and songs. They all march down to enlist thinking among other things that this will be a great way to avoid class for awhile, that this is just a matter of having some fun and picking up where they left off down the road. The first rude awakening is reporting to their quarters and discovering their CO is the postman in their area who has just been called up. Thinking he's there for fun, also, they quickly learn he's as mean and tough as any CO. It goes downhill from there as they go through basic training and are assigned to that earthly version of hell called trench warfare. Long periods of boredom in a bunker followed by intense bursts of violent combat and dealing with the injuries and psychological wounds incurred. The movie is not about WHY they went to war, it is simply showing the incredible horror of war and when it is waged that the lives of those involved are forever changed. It is said that some countries would prohibit the showing of this when they were preparing for war because of the impact it made on people's thinking about war. A classic.

63242,A129YBX5BVNW2,0783230435,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[6, 7]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie-making centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" gatefold card-wrap packaging and in some cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.1930's ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and age hasn't diminished its anti-war punch one jot. If anything this incredible new restoration finally gives this black and white masterpiece the care and attention it so thoroughly deserves.US released 14 February 2012 (13 February in the UK) - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582882773). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 40-page booklet contained within. The book has a two-page preamble by American film historian and chronicler Howard Maltin followed by biog pages on Lewis Milestone the Director - whose other credits include ""The Front Page"" 1931, ""Of Mice And Men"" 1939, ""Ocean's Eleven"" 1960 and ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" 1962. Each of the principal actors is featured accompanied by a classy black and white photo. Unknown at the time - Lew Ayers played the disillusioned German soldier Paul Baumer - a burly and gruff Lewis Wolheim played Sergeant Katczinsky who fathers it over the rookie platoon - and wizened-up Arnold Lucy played the rabid almost Nazi-like teacher Kantorek - who whips the young idealists of his 'beloved class' into patriotic 'Fatherland' frenzy with a mixture of bullied-guilt and sly wording. There are some 'Not In Picture' stills from deleted scenes, pages of press clippings and telegrams... It's a visual feast and Universal are to be praised for it. But the real fireworks comes in the glorious new print...Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. First up is the picture quality - when you see what it did look like before (covered in lines and scratches) - the new print is little short of miraculous. Lines, tears, blocking, flickering and rips in the negative - have all been repaired. Women buying flowers to throw at the troops marching through city streets at the beginning - the recruits exiting a train at the front when the town gets shelled - Katczinsky stealing a pig carcass at night in the rain - it all looks amazing. It isn't perfect by any means - there are occasional scuffs and grain - but mostly the depictions of war are so authentic and the print so clean - that it feels like you're eavesdropping on actual historical footage. And the sound is expertly woven in too - hiss gone, crackle - the voices now expressive and clear. Then you also notice the complete lack of music - which adds an almost eerie and maniacal feel to many of the scenes - especially in the trenches and bunkers where the soldiers are slowly losing it after days of shelling and starvation. An exemplary job done.Unfortunately - after the copious amount of quality extras on ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (which sent that release into the stratosphere - see separate review) the extras here are frankly a major let down. The 'Introduction' by Robert Osborne turns out to be barely two and half minutes long - but it's followed by The Library of Congress 'Silent Version' of the film (with word cards replacing the dialogue) which does at least show you how bad the original print was. The two 'Universal' features are very interesting (and indeed informative) - but as generic titles to the series, they'll be on all releases and don't advance this one. What was needed here was a dedicated 'Making Of' - and it's a very real let down not having it...The movie itself has entered into folklore - based on the 1929 novel ""Im Westen Nichts Neues"" by Erich Remarque - he was a German World War One veteran who joined the Rhineland front in 1914 (his book's prologue printed on screen at the beginning of the movie titles this review). The adapted screenplay involved as many as 8 experienced writers including Maxwell Anderson and George Abbott. The huge production utilized the fearless skill of Arthur Edeson as principal cameraman and cost 1.5 million dollars to make - a staggering amount of money for the time.Some scenes are seared into the memory - the transformation from youthful exuberance to terror as the new arrivals dig trenches and cut their hands on barbed wire to the muzzle flashes of artillery in the distance - the machine guns panning left to right as they mow down soldier after soldier in No Man's Land on yet another pointless assault - Baumer trapped in a bomb crater haunted by the look of the young boy he's just killed.Being so old though, it's not without problems. With talkies only beginning - it has to be said that some of the acting is seriously hammy - a throw back to silent films where over exaggeration was the way to get noticed. But it doesn't stop the set pieces from being unnerving. We get the training 'before' they went to war where the men are brutalized (""Full Metal Jacket"" really fleshed this out). On the other side of the coin we get the brief moments of elation and humanity - an officer lets the famished men have two rations of food instead of one despite a cook's clumsy protests - laughing, flirting and swimming with the local farm girls in the moonlight. To get authenticity they even brought in a German drill Sergeant who put 50 extras through their paces - callisthenics, marching, drill, discharging and maintaining arms - just as it would have been in the Hell Hole of the trenches. It was money well spent - ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" wowed audiences and critics alike and won Universal their 1st Academy Award for Best Picture in 1930. Director Lewis Milestone also received the Academy Award and there were nominations in two other categories - Cinematography and Writing. Its anti-war message has been a subject of scholarly debate ever since.""All Quiet On The Western Front"" and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" are amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - and they're superbly done. It's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.To sum up - despite the lack of a documentary on the making of the film - this is an absolutely first-class release because the money's been spent on what matters - bettering and preserving the print for posterity. It won't be everyone's idea of a nice afternoon in - but that was of course the point - and ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" has proved its point very well for over 80-years.

There are some people that can get pushed away from a great film because some form of political activism gets shoved into it. Needless to say, &#65533;All Quiet on the Western Front&#65533; is an anti-war film. But the war involved is the First World War. By any standards WWI was the most senseless and brutal of the great wars. However, people will too often turn to this movie as an argument against any war. In fact, that may be true, I never did read the book, but don&#65533;t be turned away because of any of that.This movie is awesome. For a film from the early era of sound, it is epic. We learn to care about the characters, we see the evolution of young men in war, and we see the brutality and senseless death that was WWI. It&#65533;s very entertaining and thought provoking.Also, when you watch any movie based on a book, you really should suspend your knowledge of the book, and try to judge the median for what it is. Maybe you have read the book, and love every passage, big deal. Don&#65533;t nitpick. A lot of people can get caught up in some of that.This movie will be always an important one.

63244,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0783230435,Martin Asiner,"[9, 11]","It is surprising that there are as few classic anti-war movies as there are.  ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is one of them.  What is even more surprising is that is was filmed in 1929 when Hollywood was just making the switch from silent to talking films.  Director Lewis Milestone adapted the novel by Erich Maria Remarque and lost none of the power of the ghastly images on the printed page.  What he filmed has not been topped in the seven decades since then.  You will not find any reference to war that has glory attached to it, except perhaps to denigrate glory as a Hollywood adjunct to celluloid combat.  There is no call, John Wayne or Stallone-like, to present killing as a means to an end.  Here, mass killing and the horror of trench warfare strip away the illusion that war somehow glorifies those who are caught up in it.  At the start of the movie, Lew Ayres is German college student Baumer, who one day while in class, gets suckered into the maw of war by his college teacher who regales his class with stirring tales of heroism set amidst some equally stirring martial music.  Student Baumer quickly becomes Private Baumer.  At their training depot, Baumer and his comrades still think war is simply another side of life.  Their collective view of war is not unlike the view that Henry Fleming had at the start of Crane's THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE.  Baumer soon finds out that with the first shots of war, the reality mugs the image.  What director Milestone succeeds in doing has never been equalled.  These new German recruits open the film as happy, confident and goodlooking.  Quickly, they learn that war devolves them into blundering atavisms.  Not only do they act ignobly and irrationally under stress, but they seem to get uglier as the picture progresses.  This ugliness is not simply the result of missing a few baths or shaves, but almost as if they were subject to a regression that swoops tham back to their primeval ancestors.  The effect on the audience is startling as it is forced to acknowledge that war destroys both the inner and outer man.Ayres, of course, carries the movie as he alone seems to maintain his precious sense that his humanity cannot be frittered away even if his sanity might.  The technology of the time, while quite crude by today's standards, is still stunningly effective in assaulting the eyes and ears of the audience in a crunching cacophany of disorienting images.  There is a series of montages of French soldiers attacking entrenched German trenches and getting slaughtered by massed machine gun fire, and then incredibly enough, the Germans counterattack to meet the same fate.  By the time the armistice is announced, the ""all quiet"" of the title, both Baumer, his comrades, and the audience have been stripped of their flimsy illusions that war has some end other than its cessation.  ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT serves to remind each new generation that the maw of war will gobble up warm bodies even more rapaciously than it will those illusions that led those bodies into that maw in the first place.",5,"Remarque's ""All Quiet"": The Stripping Away of Illusion",1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,3075,"['surprising', 'are', 'few', 'classic', 'anti-war', 'movies', 'are', 'ALL', 'QUIET', 'ON', 'THE', 'WESTERN', 'FRONT', 'one', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'was', 'filmed', '1929', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'just', 'making', 'switch', 'silent', 'talking', 'films', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'lost', 'none', 'power', 'ghastly', 'printed', 'page', 'What', 'filmed', 'not', 'been', 'topped', 'seven', 'decades', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'reference', 'war', 'glory', 'attached', 'perhaps', 'denigrate', 'glory', 'Hollywood', 'adjunct', 'celluloid', 'combat', 'call', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Stallone-like', 'present', 'killing', 'means', 'end', 'Here', 'mass', 'killing', 'horror', 'trench', 'warfare', 'away', 'illusion', 'war', 'somehow', 'glorifies', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'start', 'movie', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'German', 'college', 'student', 'Baumer', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'class', 'suckered', 'maw', 'war', 'college', 'teacher', 'who', 'class', 'stirring', 'tales', 'heroism', 'set', 'amidst', 'equally', 'stirring', 'martial', 'music', 'Student', 'Baumer', 'quickly', 'Private', 'Baumer', 'training', 'depot', 'Baumer', 'comrades', 'still', 'think', 'war', 'simply', 'side', 'life', 'collective', 'view', 'war', 'not', 'view', 'Henry', 'Fleming', 'had', 'start', 'Crane', 'THE', 'RED', 'BADGE', 'OF', 'COURAGE', 'Baumer', 'soon', 'out', 'first', 'shots', 'war', 'reality', 'image', 'What', 'director', 'Milestone', 'doing', 'never', 'been', 'equalled', 'new', 'German', 'recruits', 'open', 'film', 'happy', 'confident', 'goodlooking', 'Quickly', 'learn', 'war', 'blundering', 'atavisms', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'act', 'ignobly', 'irrationally', 'stress', 'seem', 'get', 'uglier', 'picture', 'ugliness', 'not', 'simply', 'result', 'missing', 'few', 'baths', 'shaves', 'almost', 'were', 'subject', 'regression', 'back', 'primeval', 'ancestors', 'effect', 'audience', 'startling', 'forced', 'acknowledge', 'war', 'inner', 'outer', 'man.Ayres', 'course', 'movie', 'alone', 'maintain', 'precious', 'sense', 'humanity', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'frittered', 'away', 'even', 'sanity', 'might', 'technology', 'time', 'quite', 'crude', 'today', 'standards', 'still', 'stunningly', 'effective', 'assaulting', 'eyes', 'ears', 'audience', 'crunching', 'cacophany', 'disorienting', 'images', 'series', 'montages', 'French', 'soldiers', 'attacking', 'entrenched', 'German', 'trenches', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'massed', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'then', 'incredibly', 'enough', 'Germans', 'counterattack', 'meet', 'same', 'fate', 'time', 'armistice', 'announced', 'quiet', 'title', 'Baumer', 'comrades', 'audience', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'flimsy', 'illusions', 'war', 'end', 'other', 'cessation', 'QUIET', 'ON', 'THE', 'WESTERN', 'FRONT', 'remind', 'new', 'generation', 'maw', 'war', 'will', 'gobble', 'up', 'warm', 'bodies', 'even', 'more', 'rapaciously', 'will', 'illusions', 'led', 'bodies', 'maw', 'first', 'place']",N/A
63245,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0783230435,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 2]","All Quiet On The Western Front won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1930 and it deserved to win. This movie is far and away the best ""early talkie"" I've ever seen. The plot moves along at a good pace and the action scenes could not have been better planned or filmed. We see the horrors of war and the film sends the clear message that war is very bad to say the least.When the action starts, we see German Professor Kantorek (Arnold Lucy) telling his class that it is an honor to fight; and he adds that there will be glory for them if they join the German army and fight in World War One. As he does this, troops marching off to war parade in front of the school as if war was all about impressing the young ladies. Practically the whole class of young men signs up to fight--and that's where the real action begins.Another reviewer commented that this was a 1930s version of ""Saving Private Ryan;"" and they are right. The battle scenes that inevitably follow show the horrors of war with rampant death and destruction of cemeteries, villages and countryside. We see the very young men soon finding out that war is not some easy little game; they also learn just how fast they can die--and how they must kill without mercy if they are immediately confronted by an enemy soldier.In particular, we see much of the action through the eyes of a young German soldier named Paul B&auml;umer (Lew Ayres). Paul begs a French soldier for forgiveness after he mortally wounds him but it's too late--the soldier has died. Paul promises the dead soldier that he'll help his widowed wife and daughter; but that may be hard for Paul to actually do given the circumstances. We see war buddies breaking up in tears during their first ""bombardment;"" and they must kill huge colonies of rats infesting their bunkers which are barely holding back flying shrapnel and flying dirt as the bombs hit.Not all of the other characters are developed to the same degree as Paul; but one that is would be Kat Katczinsky (Louis Wolheim). On the surface, Kat seems to have a pretty tough hide but deeper down he's an amiable fellow who really wants the war to be over just as much as Paul does. We also get to know Franz Kemmerich (Ben Alexander) who suffers the fate of having his leg amputated after an injury, much to the horror of Paul and the other young men from their school. Another interesting character is Himmelstoss the mailman (John Wray) who becomes ridiculously obsessed with his ""authority"" as a Sergeant who is actually petrified of war and who eventually gets told by a soldier not to cry about ""a scratch"" that he gets. In addition, look for a good performance by Beryl Mercer who plays Paul's mother Mrs. B&auml;umer.The DVD doesn't come with many extras; we get an introduction by Robert Osbourne and there are subtitles. However, the movie is so well done and so well restored that I can overlook this.All Quiet On The Western Front sent home the message that war is full of horrors, death and destruction. We see soldiers on all sides trying desperately just to stay alive and of course there is no respect for one's fellow human being. I highly recommend this film; it would be quite a fine addition to your DVD collection.",5,an excellent film that tells the truth about war,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,3215,"['Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '1930', 'deserved', 'win', 'movie', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'early', 'talkie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'planned', 'filmed', 'see', 'horrors', 'war', 'film', 'clear', 'message', 'war', 'very', 'bad', 'say', 'least.When', 'action', 'see', 'German', 'Professor', 'Kantorek', 'Arnold', 'Lucy', 'telling', 'class', 'honor', 'fight', 'will', 'be', 'glory', 'join', 'German', 'army', 'fight', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'marching', 'off', 'war', 'parade', 'front', 'school', 'war', 'was', 'impressing', 'young', 'ladies', 'Practically', 'whole', 'class', 'young', 'men', 'signs', 'up', 'fight', 'where', 'real', 'action', 'begins.Another', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'was', '1930s', 'version', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'are', 'right', 'battle', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'show', 'horrors', 'war', 'rampant', 'death', 'destruction', 'cemeteries', 'villages', 'countryside', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'men', 'soon', 'finding', 'out', 'war', 'not', 'easy', 'little', 'game', 'also', 'learn', 'just', 'how', 'fast', 'can', 'die', 'how', 'must', 'kill', 'mercy', 'are', 'immediately', 'confronted', 'enemy', 'soldier.In', 'particular', 'see', 'much', 'action', 'eyes', 'young', 'German', 'soldier', 'named', 'Paul', 'B', 'auml', 'umer', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'Paul', 'French', 'soldier', 'forgiveness', 'mortally', 'too', 'late', 'soldier', 'died', 'Paul', 'dead', 'soldier', ""'ll"", 'help', 'widowed', 'wife', 'daughter', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'Paul', 'actually', 'do', 'given', 'circumstances', 'see', 'war', 'buddies', 'breaking', 'up', 'tears', 'first', 'bombardment', 'must', 'kill', 'huge', 'colonies', 'rats', 'infesting', 'bunkers', 'are', 'barely', 'holding', 'back', 'flying', 'shrapnel', 'flying', 'dirt', 'bombs', 'hit.Not', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'same', 'degree', 'Paul', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Kat', 'Katczinsky', 'Louis', 'Wolheim', 'surface', 'Kat', 'have', 'pretty', 'tough', 'hide', 'deeper', 'amiable', 'fellow', 'who', 'really', 'war', 'be', 'over', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Paul', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'Franz', 'Kemmerich', 'Ben', 'Alexander', 'who', 'fate', 'having', 'leg', 'amputated', 'injury', 'much', 'horror', 'Paul', 'other', 'young', 'men', 'school', 'interesting', 'character', 'Himmelstoss', 'mailman', 'John', 'Wray', 'who', 'ridiculously', 'obsessed', 'authority', 'Sergeant', 'who', 'actually', 'petrified', 'war', 'who', 'eventually', 'told', 'soldier', 'not', 'cry', 'scratch', 'addition', 'look', 'good', 'performance', 'Beryl', 'Mercer', 'who', 'Paul', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'B', 'auml', 'umer.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'many', 'extras', 'get', 'introduction', 'Robert', 'Osbourne', 'are', 'subtitles', 'However', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'restored', 'can', 'overlook', 'this.All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'sent', 'home', 'message', 'war', 'full', 'horrors', 'death', 'destruction', 'see', 'soldiers', 'sides', 'trying', 'desperately', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'course', 'respect', 'one', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'fine', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

The ""war to end all wars"" was particularly horrifying in that it became a war of assembly-line production--a race for more troops, more bullets, more guns, more artillery, more destruction and death. Entire armies were raised, trained, and then maneuvered into senseless anhiilation and for what--a few meters of muddy, shell-pocked terrain. This was truly one of the most grotesque and stupid conflicts of all time and this movie captures it. During the major battlescene, there is something automatic, assembly-line like the way the waves of hapless French soldiers move forward over shellholes, into the mouth of a German artillery barrage, then mercilessly cut down by German machine gun fire. Then the trenches are stormed, the German defenders bayoneted in rows, clubbed to death, hand-to-hand combat with trench shovels, fists and gun butts. The Germans flee, regroup, launch their own human wave assault, are shot down in swathes by machine guns, take the trenches back. In the end, the landscape of trenches is filled with dead bodies, destruction and carnage, yet nothing has been achieved, just death and killing. It goes on again, until everybody is finally killed.

So I went down and rented it before ordering on Amazon and was amazed at the quality of the print Universal used. The cover states that the print is from 35mm print. Wouldn't think they could do much with the picture and grain from past home video versions. I own the 2007 DVD release (the brown cover) and thought the print was somewhat clean, but grain was terribly high and distracting. This new blu ray fixes that problem. The picture is nice and detailed for this old movie. There are only a few scenes that show print damage that Universal couldn't fix, but all in all this is a great restoration on Universal's part (for this movie being so old). Of course the picture is pillar boxed (1.33) and not widescreen (for all the widescreen fanatics) and presented in its original aspect ratio. There are special features on this two disc set (the second disc being DVD of the film), but the BEST special feature is the SILENT version of All Quiet on the Western Front. Yes, I said silent. The same movie with no talking, and more music. The original talkie is short on music, so this was a different way of watching this classic. The movie, transfer, and special features are worth the five stars, but what blows me away is the book type of case the discs come housed in. This is very cool with a great introduction by Leonard Maltin and the pages include a bio of the actors along with shots/stills of deleted scenes along with posters, ect. Very nice indeed for this classic. Too bad it didn't come with the original book that the film was based upon. After viewing this film, it makes me want to read the book. I never really appreciated the film like I do now. The 2007 DVD just didn't do it for me, the distractions in the transfer took me 'out of the picture'. This is one fine restoration that Universal did and I just ordered mine from Amazon. Can't wait to watch this classic again!

Milestone's deployment of camera motion,  choreography of the battle scenes, and the sharp, gritty look, as well as  the well-spent budget create an emotional force that carries the picture  with smashing success through many of it's rough spots. Indeed, the grammar  of his film-making  seems to contain an expressionism perfectly augmenting  the story's spirit; and moments achieve a stunning texture that haunt the  mind (take the opening scene in the classroom; or the final shot as the  boys look right into our souls).

All Quiet on the Western Front is just such a movie. The story of a young German soldier (Lew Ayres) who enlists in the army at the beginning of World War I, only to confront the brutality and horror of trench warfare, remains to this day one of the greatest fictional portrayals of combat ever filmed and one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made.

There are many powerful scenes, like boys going mad in the trenches, the sickening experience of the boys' first battle, and Paul killing a man up close.Because this film was made at the beginning of the ""golden age of Hollywood,"" viewers might expect it to be highly sentimental and preachy.

A passionate portrayal of the horror of war, which for the first time depicted the &quot;hun&quot; as simply a simply a scared boy, this movie can be actually divided into four distinct parts.  The first details the enlistment of the young recruits; the second, their arrival on the front; the third - the various incidents of war; and, finally, the hero Paul Baumer's return home and his hastened retreat back to the front and his death.  The film is faithful to the Remarque novel and this was the first sound film to use a giant mobile crane which was most effective -  particularly for filming the realistically staged battle sequences.  It was actually 31  year-old Cukor who rehearsed the actors and established a neutrality ot their accents which is of inestimable value in putting across the production's emotional message.  Louis Wolheim is splendid as the brusque yet sympathetic Katczinsky while Raymond Griffith is memorable as the French soldier killed by Baumer.  ZaSu Pitts (!) was originally cast as Baumer's mother but preview audiences snickered at the very sight of her (her performance in GREED proved she was an excellent serious actress); unfortunately, the role was given to the whiney, saccharine Beryl Mercer.

Universal said that this was one of the 13 classic films that they were going to restore. The restoration of this film is absolutely stunning. This is particularly because of the really bad flicker problems that this film had. Now universal has technology that can balance out the amount of color and light in each frame which solves the problem with a picture so amazing for a film so old.

63277,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,0783230435,T.M. Reader,"[1, 1]","This is a 1930 film production, faithfully based on Eric Marie Remarque's WWI novel by the same title.  Considering the infancy of talkie film making when this was created, it is an absolutely remarkable piece.  Many of the battle scene techniques have been recycled to this day.I read the novel 3 or 4 years ago, and had forgotten that it was told from the German viewpoint (such is the universality of the war experience).  The story is critical of war - though I personally believe that at times it becomes a necessity, when greedy/evil people want to force their will onto other nations.  Still, the film powerfully makes the point regarding comfortable old men fighting armchair battles, while teenagers die in the mud.  The WWI trench warfare battlefields were a particularly grim environment.  I thought this was one area in which the movie, though making a gallant effort, could not convey the reality as well as the book does.Filmed only a decade after WWI, this movie has huge historical value.  Aside from the moral implications, it is a rare glimpse into the homes, hospitals, streets, and battlefields of almost a century ago.A very important historical piece that is worth the time.",5,An Historical Icon,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,1196,"['1930', 'film', 'production', 'faithfully', 'based', 'Eric', 'Marie', 'Remarque', 'WWI', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Considering', 'infancy', 'talkie', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'was', 'created', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'Many', 'battle', 'scene', 'techniques', 'have', 'been', 'recycled', 'day.I', 'read', 'novel', '3', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'forgotten', 'was', 'told', 'German', 'viewpoint', 'such', 'universality', 'war', 'experience', 'story', 'critical', 'war', 'personally', 'believe', 'times', 'necessity', 'when', 'greedy/evil', 'people', 'want', 'force', 'will', 'onto', 'other', 'nations', 'Still', 'film', 'powerfully', 'point', 'regarding', 'comfortable', 'old', 'men', 'fighting', 'armchair', 'battles', 'teenagers', 'die', 'mud', 'WWI', 'trench', 'warfare', 'battlefields', 'were', 'particularly', 'grim', 'environment', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'area', 'movie', 'making', 'gallant', 'effort', 'could', 'not', 'convey', 'reality', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'does.Filmed', 'only', 'decade', 'WWI', 'movie', 'huge', 'historical', 'value', 'Aside', 'moral', 'implications', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'homes', 'hospitals', 'streets', 'battlefields', 'almost', 'century', 'ago.A', 'very', 'important', 'historical', 'piece', 'time']",N/A
63278,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0783230435,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","There's a reason that Lewis Milestone's All Quiet On the Western Front is still the best remembered of all the many films about the horrors of the First World War despite rarely being revived on television: it really IS a great and often very moving film that plants itself firmly in the memory. While WW1 movies had been gradually moving into darker territory as the silent era came to an end, perhaps only J'Accuse had dealt with the bitter disillusionment so many felt at the time quite so graphically. In that, All Quiet was aided at the time by having its lost generation on the losing side - British, French and American films would deal with the horrors of trench life but would still regard them as a price worth paying for victory. It would not be until the 1960s that futility on both sides would become the cinematic norm.Filmed on a truly epic scale with a striking visual fluidity that was still unusual for an early talkie thanks to Arthur Edeson's pioneering cinematography, after the initial establishing scenes there's no real story, simply a succession of incidents as its group of schoolboy recruits are gradually killed off. As impressive as these incidents are, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective if the characters didn't convince, and the film is anchored by a superb lead performance from Lew Ayres as the idealistic young schoolboy who gradually becomes a shell of his former self, with excellent support from Louis Wolheim as the old soldier who takes him and his friends under his wing. Wisely replacing the flashback structure of Erich Maria Remarque's book with a chronological narrative, rather than introducing the characters as the cynical survivors they become, the film gradually shows their idealism worn away. While the attack and counter-attack sequences are still incredibly vivid, breathtakingly edited and surprisingly violent - in one memorable shot an explosion leaves only a pair of severed hands clinging to barbed wire - the real horror almost seems to be the way the characters adapt to their dehumanising conditions at the front to such an extent that they no longer fit in at home when they do get leave. It becomes impossible to imagine a life after the war so completely have they been consumed by it.Ironically the film's most famous scene is nowhere to be found in the novel. Remarque never describes the final death: his body is simply discovered, appearing to be at peace. Milestone opted for something more explicitly powerful, but not without much trial and error. After at least seven scripted versions had been rejected, another ending of Paul hallucinating of French and German troops marching into the same grave and crying out in anguish before being shot by a sniper had been filmed but satisfied no-one - the studio wanted a happy ending (Milestone jokingly suggested having the Germans win!) while Milestone hated the rushes: it was cinematographer Karl Freund who suggested that the ending should be `as simple as a butterfly.' Hastily shot by Freund with Milestone's own hand standing in for Ayres, the iconic scene would become one of cinema's most enduring moments. Yet perhaps even more moving is the film's closing shot of the boys marching up the line to death, their faces superimposed over their graves as they look back at the camera and the audience without life and without hope. It still packs an incredible emotional punch more than three-quarters of a century later.It's a shame there isn't a documentary to accompany the film on DVD, as the film's history is fascinating (Andrew Kelly's book Filming All Quiet On the Western Front gives an excellent account). Numerous scenes were reshot with different cast members - ZaSu Pitts' scenes as Paul's mother were reshot with Beryl Mercer because Pitts had just had a comedy on release and the studio were afraid audiences would laugh when they saw her - while the film was exhibited in both sound and silent versions. Future directors Fred Zinnemann and Robert Parrish were extras in the film while an uncredited George Cukor was the film's dialogue coach. The film was banned in several countries in Europe before WW2 (New Zealand was the first country to ban it, on the bizarre grounds that it was `not entertainment' and therefore `unsuitable for public exhibition'!) and attacked by McCarthy as Communist propaganda after it when he included the Russian-born Milestone in his list of the 19 most `dangerous' subversives in the film industry.The film's German premiere was disrupted by the Nazis, who even released mice in the theatre and organized several days of riots that successfully got the film banned in Germany to `preserve public order.' Over the subsequent years music was added to some scenes and the film was heavily cut with each reissue, even turned into an anti-Nazi pro-war propaganda film in 1939 by the judicious deletion of certain scenes and the addition of newsreel footage of Nazi rallies and book-burnings. Yet ironically the film's restoration was largely based on the longest surviving print, which had been found in Joseph Goebbels private collection - while he publicly attacked the film, he genuinely admired its artistry. The version here is still missing a few minutes of footage, some of which has been subsequently restored to 35mm prints, but it's still well worth picking up.",5,Still the benchmark for WW1 films -

Outside, a group of soldiers are parading down the street to cheering crowds and parading music. Filled with images of the glory and honor of serving in the war, the boys decide to enlist. After their military training, they arrive at the front where they learn all there is for them is hunger, fear and death. They fight rats as well as the enemy and they watch the slaughter of soldiers from both sides and even kill some of them. In one moving moment, Paul kills a French soldier and stays in a blast crater with the dying soldier, asking for forgiveness.Among one of the other powerful scenes is when Paul goes on leave and returns to his town. There, he visits his former teacher, who is giving another lecture to another group of students about why they should join the army. When asked to talk about the war, Paul says &#65533;We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed. Sometimes we are-That&#65533;s all&#65533;. He is booed at by the boys who see him as a coward. Meanwhile, when he talks with a group of old-timers, he is told to push on to Paris. After fighting for too long, he fells that the only place he is conformable at is at the front. When he returns back to his unit, he finds that only a few remain and most of those are recruits who were once like him: Boys who found the front to be different from what they thought it would be.It is obvious that this movie was made in 1930. &#65533;Talkies&#65533; had been around for only a few years, so silent-era acting was still widely present. The special effects in the film are also not as realistic as today. The scenes are filmed in black and white with scratches visible in some scenes.

The DVD version talks about the original book written by Erich Maria Remarque and some of what went on the set and features biographies of the cast members and director Lewis Milestone.",4,&quot;You'll get to go home before I do&quot;,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,1425,"['more', 'realistic', 'view', 'war', 'instead', 'War', 'Hero', 'type', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'watching', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'quot', 'As', 'always', 'book', 'better', 'quot', 'someone', 'name', 'Claire', 'complained', 'sound', 'fact', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Claire', 'let', 'alone', 'would', 'care', 'believe', 'was', '1st', 'movie', 'sound', 'entire', 'picture', 'subtitles', 'original', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Western', 'Front', 'even', 'featured', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'vocals', 'dialouge', 'was', 'subtitles', 'Not', 'only', 'war', 'scenes', 'used', 'revolving', 'crane', 'introduced', 'new', 'form', 'cinematography', 'Cinema', 'professor', 'showed', 'class', 'when', 'discussing', 'beginning', 'sound', 'era', 'movies', 'Lew', 'Aires', 'who', 'was', '22', 'filming', 'Western', 'Front', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'side', 'Germany', 'movie', 'teacher', 'over-enthusiastically', 'exhorts', 'students', 'fight', 'country', 'Paul', 'enlists', 'enthusiastically', 'serve', 'battle', 'However', 'seeing', 'many', 'comrades', 'die', 'battle', 'killing', 'quot', 'quot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Paul', 'change', 'heart', 'DVD', 'version', 'talks', 'original', 'book', 'written', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'what', 'went', 'set', 'features', 'biographies', 'cast', 'members', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone']",N/A

I am going to address just one aspect of this brilliant film... the special effects......Having been in two wars, I know what real explosions look like.  I know that grenades do not throw men thirty feet into the air... when you throw one into a bamboo hut it does not look like a 55 gallon drum of gasoline was just detonated...Take... say... a 60 mm mortar round... the explosion is mostly explosive and dirt... only the briefest glimpse of flame......But some hack special effects types started using insane amounts of gasoline... then directors decided that they liked it and forced good special effects men to go for larger and larger amounts of gasoline......But All Quiet on the Western Front... does not prostitute itself that way.  Many of the special effects crew had been in the trenches and knew exactly what it looked like... If you know what to look for you can spot effects from a French 75 up to a major seige gun... and no gasoline......The greatest special effect is during the French charge almost to the lip of the German trenches... and the German siege guns (battleship type weapons and larger) lay down a ""barrage"" (original meaning... barrier) between the trenches and the charging infantry....While some license is taken... guns that heavy never deliberately targeted within a hundred meters of friendly lines... the effect is staggering... Up to that moment the charging troops are throwing their bodies against metal... chopped down in endless rows by machine guns... torn asunder and made part of the soil by artillery...  But the explosions from the ""heavies"" between the French and the Germans... are gigantic... they tower over the battlefield like nothing from the hand of man... but rather more like titanic explosions delivered from the sky by iron gods...  Mere flesh... no matter how insanely brave... has to draw the line there......These days when I see the sloppy special effects work demanded by directors... I want to lock them in a room with a copy of that scene and not let them out until they understand just how much they have been shoving drek on us....",5,Puts other special effects to shame,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,2154,"['.Rather', 'repeat', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'am', 'going', 'address', 'just', 'one', 'aspect', 'brilliant', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'Having', 'been', 'two', 'wars', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'explosions', 'look', 'know', 'grenades', 'do', 'not', 'throw', 'men', 'thirty', 'feet', 'air', 'when', 'throw', 'one', 'bamboo', 'hut', 'not', 'look', '55', 'gallon', 'drum', 'gasoline', 'was', 'just', 'detonated', 'Take', 'say', '60', 'mm', 'mortar', 'round', 'explosion', 'mostly', 'explosive', 'dirt', 'only', 'briefest', 'glimpse', 'flame', 'hack', 'special', 'effects', 'types', 'started', 'using', 'insane', 'amounts', 'gasoline', 'then', 'directors', 'decided', 'liked', 'forced', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'men', 'go', 'larger', 'larger', 'amounts', 'gasoline', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'not', 'prostitute', 'way', 'Many', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'had', 'been', 'trenches', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'looked', 'know', 'what', 'look', 'can', 'spot', 'effects', 'French', '75', 'up', 'major', 'seige', 'gun', 'gasoline', 'greatest', 'special', 'effect', 'French', 'charge', 'almost', 'lip', 'German', 'trenches', 'German', 'siege', 'guns', 'battleship', 'type', 'weapons', 'larger', 'lay', 'down', 'barrage', 'original', 'meaning', 'barrier', 'trenches', 'charging', 'infantry', 'license', 'taken', 'heavy', 'never', 'deliberately', 'targeted', 'hundred', 'meters', 'friendly', 'lines', 'effect', 'staggering', 'Up', 'moment', 'charging', 'troops', 'are', 'throwing', 'bodies', 'metal', 'chopped', 'down', 'endless', 'rows', 'machine', 'guns', 'torn', 'asunder', 'made', 'part', 'soil', 'artillery', 'explosions', 'heavies', 'French', 'Germans', 'are', 'gigantic', 'tower', 'battlefield', 'nothing', 'hand', 'man', 'rather', 'more', 'titanic', 'explosions', 'delivered', 'sky', 'iron', 'gods', 'Mere', 'flesh', 'matter', 'how', 'insanely', 'brave', 'draw', 'line', 'days', 'when', 'see', 'sloppy', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'demanded', 'directors', 'want', 'lock', 'room', 'copy', 'scene', 'not', 'let', 'out', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'been', 'shoving', 'drek']",N/A
