For the rest of us it is just a sad joke. The main character is so petrified of catching HIV that he literally comes across as a paranoid schizophrenic! This film is nothing but stereotype after stereotype. Nathan Lane appears as a priest who tries to molest Jeffrey and then lets him in on the secret that ""God is found in a Barbra Steisand album.""

The film, from 1995,  is based on Paul Rudnick's off-Broadway comedy of a few years earlier.  The  movie is full of humor, love and pain as Jeffrey struggles with his love  for &quot;the man of his dreams&quot;, who happens to be HIV-positive.  The  movie deals with the issue in a pretty straight-forward way (pardon the  pun).  One of my favorite scenes features Jeffrey dancing alone in his  apartment to the song &quot;Helpless&quot; - very intense!  Like  &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, I wish I could have seen this in live  theater.  If you liked &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, you will enjoy this  movie - the primary difference?  &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; was set in  a time BEFORE the AIDS crisis.

152950,AB9WCN34TY8CV,0792845269,Charles Sutherland,"[3, 4]","I love this film.  It is a great snapshot of life in the gay 80s and 90s, at the height of the AIDS crisis, dealing with the impact of the disease on the lives of the urban gay men.  The main character is Jeffrey (played by Steven Weber, better known from ""Wings""), who has decided that it is just too much work and risk to fall in love at such at time; eventually he even decides to leave New York to move back to Wisconsin or some other remote place where he won't be tempted.  However, he continues to be tempted, particularly by a bartender Steve (played by Michael T. Weiss, the ""Pretender""),  who unfortunately has HIV.Patrick Stewart steals the show as the interior decorate (I mean designer) Sterling, whose flamboyant gestures and over-the-top gay-ness are really something, especially during the game show scene, when his campy answers dominate the game.The ending of the film is a bit ambiguous, and of course the AIDS crisis is in many ways not over, despite the development of longer-lasting drugs and the lack of newspaper headlines.  People living with the disease continues, but it need not be a hopeless situation, and that's really what this play turned film is all about.  The occasional appearance of people like Nathan Lane (as a gay priest looking for a quickie) or the Mother Theresa character add flavor and further campiness, but perhaps the best cameo goes to Sigourney Weaver, as the pop-pscyhologist guru Debra, who has pat answers and snappy lines for solving all of life's problems.The DVD doesn't have much by way of extras, but it does have a film trailer, and of course the film comes off in much better form than on video tape.",5,Fabulous!

152951,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,0792845269,Dave Beards,"[3, 4]","Jeffrey follows a very predictable plot - a 'thirtysomething' gay man is jaded and confused by dating and sex in an era of HIV and emotional distancing.  He meets a wonderful guy who is HIV positive and becomes scared and runs away. We then see him work through his issues to eventually become reunited with HIV positive guy. Hhhmmm, certainly sounds like a terrible Hollywood cookie-cutter plot so far.....But what makes this movie special is the low budget nature and the use of 'arthouse' style tricks. Yes, every conceivable trick is employed here - artsy fade outs, character narrative (including direct to camera whilst other actors are frozen), dream sequences and an almost cartoonish quality to the performances. So if you're like me and adore the forementioned arthouse style of film making, this movie is a must see!Whilst the overall plot may indeed be predictable, the journey to the end is filled with many wonderful moments. We have over the top characters providing hilarious comedy which is contrasted nicely to unexpected moments of raw emotion leading to an emotional rollercoaster of a movie.Two actors particularly stand out in this movie. Michael T Weiss (from TV's The Pretender and Days of Our Lives ) excels as the HIV positive gay man who thinks he has found someone special in Jeffrey. He really delves deep into the character to deliver a wonderful three dimensional performance of a gay man who is looking for love. Patrick Stewart (well known for his role in Star Trek) plays a flamboyant, over the top, quick witted older gay man to perfection here. Just when you think his role is completely 1 dimensional, we also see a more human side to him.A special mention must also be made of the numerous cameos made by well know Hollywood actors throughout the movie. Most of their apprearances may be brief, but they all sink their teeth into their respective roles to give us something extra special. Though I won't spoil it for you and tell you who they are....The predictable plot not withstanding, this movie is a very enjoyable journey through the struggles of gay men during an era of HIV and emotional distancing. The 'arthouse' gimmickry employed may not be appreciated by those who are used the standard Hollywood fare, but for those of us who enjoy thought and experimentation in our movies, Jeffrey will leave you with that wonderful 'goosebump' feeling.....",4,Highly enjoyable arthouse film with many special moments..,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2394,"['Jeffrey', 'very', 'predictable', 'plot', ""'thirtysomething"", 'gay', 'man', 'jaded', 'confused', 'dating', 'sex', 'era', 'HIV', 'emotional', 'distancing', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'who', 'HIV', 'positive', 'scared', 'away', 'then', 'see', 'work', 'issues', 'eventually', 'become', 'reunited', 'HIV', 'positive', 'guy', 'Hhhmmm', 'certainly', 'terrible', 'Hollywood', 'cookie-cutter', 'plot', 'far', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'low', 'budget', 'nature', 'use', ""'arthouse"", 'style', 'tricks', 'Yes', 'conceivable', 'trick', 'employed', 'here', 'artsy', 'fade', 'outs', 'character', 'narrative', 'including', 'direct', 'camera', 'whilst', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'frozen', 'dream', 'sequences', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'quality', 'performances', 'So', ""'re"", 'adore', 'forementioned', 'arthouse', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'Whilst', 'overall', 'plot', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'predictable', 'journey', 'end', 'filled', 'many', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'have', 'top', 'characters', 'providing', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'contrasted', 'nicely', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'raw', 'emotion', 'leading', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'movie.Two', 'actors', 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'Michael', 'T', 'Weiss', 'TV', 'Pretender', 'Days', 'Lives', 'excels', 'HIV', 'positive', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'someone', 'special', 'Jeffrey', 'really', 'deep', 'character', 'deliver', 'wonderful', 'three', 'dimensional', 'performance', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'looking', 'love', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'well', 'known', 'role', 'Star', 'Trek', 'flamboyant', 'top', 'quick', 'witted', 'older', 'gay', 'man', 'perfection', 'here', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'role', 'completely', '1', 'dimensional', 'also', 'see', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'him.A', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'made', 'well', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'movie', 'Most', 'apprearances', 'may', 'be', 'brief', 'sink', 'teeth', 'respective', 'roles', 'give', 'something', 'extra', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'tell', 'who', 'are', '.The', 'predictable', 'plot', 'not', 'withstanding', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'journey', 'struggles', 'gay', 'men', 'era', 'HIV', 'emotional', 'distancing', ""'arthouse"", 'gimmickry', 'employed', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'who', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'experimentation', 'movies', 'Jeffrey', 'will', 'leave', 'wonderful', ""'goosebump"", 'feeling', '..']",N/A
152952,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,0792845269,David Bonesteel,"[1, 5]","A gay man (Stephen Webber) swears off love because he is afraid of AIDS despite a powerful attraction to a man (Michael T. Weiss) he meets at his health club.  ""Jeffrey"" started out as a play and it shows: characters make speeches directly to the camera and it is filled with generally amusing little vignettes that probably work well in a theater revue but don't build a cohesive film narrative.  The characters seem to be delivering monologues to each other rather than having conversations.All of this can be overcome if the writing is good enough (as it often is), but the central character of Jeffrey is more problematic.  He spends the whole movie running from relationships and inadvertently treating his would-be boyfriend rather shabbily, and I think we are meant to identify with him, but he is surrounded by much wiser, more emotionally healthy characters who implore him to do the right thing.  As a result, I was just exasperated with Jeffrey's whiny self-centeredness and unconvinced by his conversion at the end.  The entire cast does a great job.  It's a hoot to see Patrick Stewart as a flamboyant gay man, but he doesn't just play it for laughs; his Sterling comes through as the most sharply defined personality in the film.",3,"Well intentioned, but too whiny",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1243,"['gay', 'man', 'Stephen', 'Webber', 'love', 'afraid', 'AIDS', 'powerful', 'attraction', 'man', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'health', 'club', 'Jeffrey', 'started', 'out', 'play', 'characters', 'make', 'speeches', 'directly', 'camera', 'filled', 'generally', 'amusing', 'little', 'vignettes', 'probably', 'work', 'well', 'theater', 'revue', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'cohesive', 'film', 'narrative', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'delivering', 'monologues', 'other', 'rather', 'having', 'conversations.All', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'writing', 'good', 'enough', 'often', 'central', 'character', 'Jeffrey', 'more', 'problematic', 'whole', 'movie', 'running', 'relationships', 'inadvertently', 'treating', 'would-be', 'boyfriend', 'rather', 'shabbily', 'think', 'are', 'meant', 'identify', 'surrounded', 'much', 'wiser', 'more', 'emotionally', 'healthy', 'characters', 'who', 'implore', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'result', 'was', 'just', 'exasperated', 'Jeffrey', 'whiny', 'self-centeredness', 'unconvinced', 'conversion', 'end', 'entire', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'hoot', 'see', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'man', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'Sterling', 'most', 'sharply', 'defined', 'personality', 'film']",N/A
152953,A342YAXL116N5A,0792845269,Dennis!,"[33, 45]","I saw this movie and enjoyed it immensely the first time.  It was funny, I liked Patrick Stewart's over-the-top performance, and hey, the leads aren't bad to look at.  But then the more I thought about this movie the more I came away from it with problems about the way gay men are portrayed in this film.My primary discontent with this movie is Jeffrey's conception of ""love.""  Jeffrey swears off of dating just because he's afraid of the potential consequences of sex -- as if love and sex are so absolutely intertwined that one really cannot exist without the other.  Jeffrey basically says ""why bother to meet new people if I know I will be refusing to have sex with them?""  There's no hint of him even considering that there may be more to men than rock-hard abs and what's between their legs.Then he meets up with this hot guy at the gym.  The sexual tension between the two is palpable, but because of Jeffrey's new resolution, he's determined to head it off at the pass.  But he can't... because his new friend is *just so hot.*  Heck, they kiss within five minutes of meeting each other.What does that say about gay men?  Jeffrey's pledge is broken not because he's met a *great* guy, it's broken because he's met a *hot* guy.  This just further reinforces that notion that men need nothing but the sexual appeal to sustain a ""relationship.""Indeed, very little of this movie shows us anything about the two main characters actually learning anything about the other's personality or character or values or morals or anything.  All they seem to know about each other is that they are sexually attracted to each other.So, yes, it's a fun movie to watch.  Its initial appeal is amusing.

He neglected to mention it's a film about a gay waiter learning about commitment and life in the age of Aids. It stars Steven Weber and Patrick Stewart. Well, I would watch Stewart read the phone book, and I've always liked Weber ever since ""Wings"".This film is hilarious, poignant, and triumphant all at the same time. Stewart, as a waspish interior decorator with snappy observations, is perfection. Weber holds his own as Jeffrey, a more-or-less straight-acting young gay man looking for love on what had become the sexual minefield of the '90's. He vows abstinence, but then he meets Michael T. Weiss, a masculine bartender for catered events, who has Aids. How their relationship, and how the subplot of Stewart and his lover, who has Aids, play out, caroms from wry to heart-tugging to very witty to sad to uplift. All the performances are first class, and there are also many cameos that add to the humor.Profound observations might be made about living and surviving in what some have called ""the gay holocaust"", but I think this film uses the device of high contrast to great effectiveness. Tell a somewhat frothy story set in what we know to be a milieu of tragedy. We feel the pain of what Aids has done to so many: gays and straights indiscriminately, but we are left with an ultimately positive and fulfilling experience.Anyone can enjoy this film, gay, straight or somewhere between.

I actually think to have seen it two times and liked both time. It was also one of the first movie I bought in videotape and probably in my old videotape boxes there is still my copy.Thinking at that movie in these days, I realized how much my perspective is changed: I loved Jeffrey, but had always the idea that it was a sad movie; one of the character has AIDS and almost 15 years ago, at least in Italy, having AIDS was the same as having a terminal illness there was no chance to survive. So, I always thought that Jeffrey couldn't be in any way an Happily Ever After.

Safe sex is portrayed as the not so fun variety of sex and through the eyes of Jeffery, it seems so pointless. Then he meets someone who turns out to have HIV and despite that major calamity, sparks fly. Of course Jeffery manages to come off as cold and shallow at times, but anyone watching this has probably done something similar in their time. ""Jeffery"" is a top notch movie and features some pretty interesting 'cameo's'. Sigourney Weaver does a veery funny bit as an inspirational speaker who tries to tackle Jefferies issue. The cater waiter scene is just fabulously coreographed and it is one of the funniest, and possibly sexiest, scenes in the movie. And then there is Patrick Stewart who is just hilarious as he plays over the top. You can tell he, as well as the rest of the cast, are having a blast with this movie.

The work seems very contrived and the acting in the film is mostly too brittle and archly overdone (even on the part of Sigourney Weaver, a genuine Hollywood star, in a minor part), not really amounting to much above amateur level, to overcome that impression.I suspect that a really good way to carry over ""Jeffrey"" the play to the medium of cinema would to make a film musical of it; one does not expect naturalism in a movie musical and if the actors were not strong dramatically, the music, if it were at all good, would make one ignore such a fault more readily.That said, the story of Jeffrey, a gay man who contemplates giving up sex (till a man with AIDS, of all people, at last makes him change his mind, albeit after much reluctance) is a viable enough subject for an entertaining film, one with a greater amount of sheer fantasy and some defter whimsy than this one displays, to overcome the limitations of such a ""take"" as this one on the original play from which the film was devised.

I saw the play when it was off Broadway.  I didn't like it then.  I didn't like it years later, and I don't like this movie, which is somewhat faithful to the play.I don't think that the director, the actors, the producers, or the studio can be blamed for my dislike of this film.  It just isn't my cup of tea.Now, I've seen and loved many films of this genre, especially Longtime Companion and Parting Glances.  I've loved plays from this genre too.  My problem with this play is that it comes off a bit too light and whimsical and less like a play than a series of vignettes clipped together with Scotch tape and staples.With the exception of The Sum of Us, I don't know of any film of the genre in which the actors speak directly to the audience.  It bothered me in The Sum of Us, though not to distraction, and it bothers me here to a large degree.Emotions are over the top and so is the acting.  As a comedy, this is great stuff, I suppose, if you are a member of Act Up.  I don't subscribe to this kind of humor.  It's not offensive.  It just ISN'T!  Seeing a crowd of people who do not know the lead character chase him down the street asking him why he won't go on a date with a man with HIV is just a bit too Bye Bye Birdie when you're dealing with a serious subject  - even if it is a comedy.I don't know.

Living in NYC, Jeffrey makes the unusual decision to become celibate due to his fear of contracting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  The gay couple of Sterling (Patrick Stewart) and Darius (Bryan Batt) befriend Jeffrey and introduce him to a single guy named Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), but Jeffrey is afraid to get involved with Steve because Steve has HIV.  Along the way, an assortment of different people attempt to help Jeffrey, including the psychologist Debra Moorhouse (Sigourney Weaver), Mother Teresa (Irma St. Paule), his father (Peter Maloney), his mother (Debra Monk) and Father Dan (Nathan Lane).  Other interesting characters include Acolyte (Kathy Najimy), Mrs. Marcangelo (Olympia Dukakis) and her son Angelique (Gregory Jbara).The two best performances in the film were those of Patrick Stewart and Nathan Lane.  Also very good were those of Bryan Batt, Michael T. Weiss and Olympia Dukakis.  Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy and Gregory Jbara were also very entertaining.

Jeffrey's quest to avoid intimacy because of his fear of falling in love with someone who is going to die (aren't we all going to die though?) comes across as a series of Jeffrey-Learns-an-Important-Lesson vignettes, punctuated by a cameo celebrity appearance.Never does the story take a hard and serious look at the lives of gay men, let alone gay men living in the age of HIV/AIDS.

Unfortunately, it went almost  unnoticed by everyone but a few stray critics and some hardcore Trekkies who were able to withstand the traumatization of witnessing Jean-Luc Picard running around behaving like a  flaming queen. (One can easily imagine Patrick Stewart imitating Alan Rickman's immortal one-liner from Galaxy Quest: ""I played Richard III..."")Jeffrey is a love story gone horribly awry in the best of ways. A young gay man named Jeffrey (Steven Weber,  probably best-known for taking on the role of Jack Torrance in the recent miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining), obsessed with the spread of HIV, swears off sex,  much to the horror of his best friend Sterling (Stewart). Needless to say, as soon as he decides this, he meets Mr. Right, a chap named Steven (Michael T. Weiss before his  Pretender days). As we go through boy-meets-boy, boy-loses-boy, boy-gets-boy-into-pickle, boy-gets-pickle-into-boy, we're treated to a number of sideshows in Jeffrey  and Steve's fantasy lives (some of which are positively horrific; Jeffrey's imagining of how a phone conversation with his parents might go is the kind of thing recurring nightmares  are made of), a twisted self-help guru (Sigourney Weaver) who tries to get Jeffrey over his fear of intimacy, some sidebars with Sterling and Sterling's AIDS-infected lover  (the deliciously funny Bryan Batt), and various other pratfalls. The end result is hysterical in all the right places.What struck the few people who noticed the film back in 1995 was the transplanting of the typical Hollywood  slapstick-romance-forties-comedy framework onto a gay relationship; these days that's common enough we can forget about that angle. Today we look at it and are astounded  at the number of bit players in this film who have gone on to stardom; Stewart and Weaver were the only really big names in the cast at the time, but since then Weiss,  Camryn Manheim, Kathy Najimy, Ethan Phillips, and a host of others have all become recognizable faces. Either the casting director was a genius or the movie was simply a  secretarial pool from which every major Hollywood agent has since drawn. Either way, it's a great film to play spot-the future-star with, in addition to its many other fine  qualities.Very, very highly recommended in every way, shape, and form. **** ",5,An underrated classic in the making!,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,2442,"['Jeffrey', 'Christopher', 'Ashley', '1995', 'What', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'releases', '1995', 'Unfortunately', 'went', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'everyone', 'few', 'stray', 'critics', 'hardcore', 'Trekkies', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'withstand', 'traumatization', 'witnessing', 'Jean-Luc', 'Picard', 'running', 'around', 'behaving', 'flaming', 'queen', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'imitating', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'immortal', 'one-liner', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'played', 'Richard', 'III', 'Jeffrey', 'love', 'story', 'gone', 'horribly', 'awry', 'best', 'ways', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'named', 'Jeffrey', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'probably', 'best-known', 'taking', 'role', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'recent', 'miniseries', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Shining', 'obsessed', 'spread', 'HIV', 'sex', 'much', 'horror', 'best', 'friend', 'Sterling', 'Stewart', 'Needless', 'say', 'as', 'soon', 'Mr', 'Right', 'chap', 'named', 'Steven', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'Pretender', 'days', 'go', 'boy-meets-boy', 'boy-loses-boy', 'boy-gets-boy-into-pickle', 'boy-gets-pickle-into-boy', ""'re"", 'treated', 'number', 'sideshows', 'Jeffrey', 'Steve', 'fantasy', 'lives', 'are', 'positively', 'horrific', 'Jeffrey', 'imagining', 'how', 'phone', 'conversation', 'parents', 'might', 'go', 'kind', 'thing', 'recurring', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'twisted', 'self-help', 'guru', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'who', 'get', 'Jeffrey', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'sidebars', 'Sterling', 'Sterling', 'AIDS-infected', 'lover', 'deliciously', 'funny', 'Bryan', 'Batt', 'various', 'other', 'pratfalls', 'end', 'result', 'hysterical', 'right', 'struck', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'noticed', 'film', 'back', '1995', 'was', 'transplanting', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'slapstick-romance-forties-comedy', 'framework', 'gay', 'relationship', 'days', 'common', 'can', 'forget', 'angle', 'Today', 'look', 'are', 'astounded', 'number', 'bit', 'players', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'stardom', 'Stewart', 'were', 'only', 'really', 'big', 'names', 'cast', 'time', 'then', 'Weiss', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'host', 'others', 'have', 'become', 'recognizable', 'casting', 'director', 'was', 'genius', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'secretarial', 'pool', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'drawn', 'way', 'great', 'film', 'play', 'spot-the', 'future-star', 'addition', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'qualities.Very', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'way', 'shape', 'form', '****']",N/A

Weber, though appealing, seems awfully whiney.  I realize his character's indecision about life is what drives the story- but it also drove this viewer crazy.  Writer Paul Rudnick has some great lines and there are some good performances- but this film often feels strained. A somewhat enjoyable film, but it could've been better.",3,Jeffrey Seems Dated,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,435,"['saw', 'flick', 'originally', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'watched', 'again', 'DVD', 'rental', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Weber', 'appealing', 'awfully', 'whiney', 'realize', 'character', 'indecision', 'life', 'what', 'story-', 'also', 'drove', 'viewer', 'crazy', 'Writer', 'Paul', 'Rudnick', 'great', 'lines', 'are', 'good', 'performances-', 'film', 'often', 'strained', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better']",N/A
152986,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,0792845269,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""Jeffrey"" has always been one of my favorite romantic gay comedy/dramas. Its story is simple: it's about a man in his early thirties who decides to stay celibate because of the AIDS crisis. However, things change for him when he falls in love with a stud at a gym. Things are going great until the gum gym guy tells him that he is HIV positive. The movie is really about how two different gay men with different HIV statuses can have a healthy, normal life together. ""Jeffrey"" is widely considered the first movie to explore how an HIV positive man can have a beautiful relationship with an HIV negative man. The script is strong and the performances are flawless. Patrick Stewart also plays an older gay man whose lover dies of AIDS. A truely touching story of romance, fun, and undying friendship. Steven Weber, from TV's ""Wings"" and Michael T. Weiss from ""Days of Our Lives"" play the leads in the film. The DVD is a barebones edition, but it comes in widescreen and the trailer is included. Sigourney Weaver has a cameo as a mouthy public speaker.
