260053,A1BQOT47Q2I1TX,630165076X,Jim C.,"[1, 1]","Bruce Weber&#8217;s documentary on jazz artist Chet Baker was nominated for an Academy Award.  And for good reason.  Weber&#8217;s gift for gorgeous black and white photography made him famous.  Weber found the perfect subject in Baker, a remarkably photogenic figure.  The  film is lovely to behold.  You could turn off the sound and just watch the images.Through archival footage, we sample Baker&#8217;s early career, a television appearance, a jazz festival gig, a couple commercial films.  Sprinkled throughout are spot-on reminiscences from fellow trumpeter Jack Sheldon, acclaimed photographer William Claxton, a past lover, and others.  The film&#8217;s true poignancy lies in the contemporary footage of Baker, as he plays, sings, and almost sleep-walks through life.The music is still lovely, the selections well-chosen (and available on a CD).  That Baker was serious about his music is clear. His singing always was an acquired taste, and by now his voice was as ravaged as his cratered face.  This makes it particularly haunting.In fact, the whole film is haunting and nostalgic.  Every shot, every sequence, is there for a reason.  The result is an unforgettable impressionistic portrait that rings true.  This is a really terrific film made by another artist, Bruce Weber, who knew exactly what he was doing.",5,"Evocative, haunting, impressionist portrait of iconic artist",1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,1323,"['Bruce', 'Weber', '8217', 's', 'documentary', 'jazz', 'artist', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'good', 'reason', 'Weber', '8217', 'gift', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'made', 'famous', 'Weber', 'found', 'perfect', 'subject', 'Baker', 'remarkably', 'photogenic', 'figure', 'film', 'lovely', 'behold', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'just', 'watch', 'images.Through', 'archival', 'footage', 'sample', 'Baker', '8217', 'early', 'career', 'television', 'appearance', 'jazz', 'festival', 'gig', 'couple', 'commercial', 'films', 'Sprinkled', 'are', 'spot-on', 'reminiscences', 'fellow', 'trumpeter', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'acclaimed', 'photographer', 'William', 'Claxton', 'past', 'lover', 'others', 'film', '8217', 'true', 'poignancy', 'contemporary', 'footage', 'Baker', 'sings', 'almost', 'sleep-walks', 'life.The', 'music', 'still', 'lovely', 'selections', 'well-chosen', 'available', 'CD', 'Baker', 'was', 'serious', 'music', 'clear', 'singing', 'always', 'was', 'acquired', 'taste', 'now', 'voice', 'was', 'as', 'ravaged', 'cratered', 'face', 'particularly', 'haunting.In', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'haunting', 'nostalgic', 'shot', 'sequence', 'there', 'reason', 'result', 'unforgettable', 'impressionistic', 'portrait', 'true', 'really', 'terrific', 'film', 'made', 'artist', 'Bruce', 'Weber', 'who', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing']",N/A

He never kicked dope and was fairly unapologetic about it. Moved all over the place in Europe(where he became something akin to a God in jazz fan circles - especially in Italy). In and out of jail - you name it, he did it.Of course, he had all the traits of a junkie - manipulative, selfish, focused on his habit to the exclusion of almost everything else....almost. He continued making great music, to one extent or other, up until the day he fell to his death from a hotel window. This film catches up with him near the end and contains great interviews with Baker himself, many of his former cronies, friends, lovers.It's shot in beautiful black and white and is really a stunning, unusual bio-pic of an amazingly interesting (but more to the point - talented) guy. Look close and you will see young Chris Isaak and Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.Also, there is a great book about Baker, titled Deep In A Dream (James Gavin).",5,Let's Get Lost...,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,1577,"['great', 'film', 'recapping', 'life', 'end', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'trumpet', 'great', 'Chet', 'Baker.If', 'are', 'reading', 'probably', 'know', 'basics', 'rapid', 'rise', 'jazz', 'stardom', 'early', 'fifties', 'natural', 'talent', 'taught', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'music', 'records', 'landmark', 'versions', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Thrill', 'Gone', 'Funny', 'Valentine', 'name', 'few', 'truly', 'unique', 'somewhat', 'androgenous', 'vocal', 'style', 'haunting', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'then', 'lifelong', 'drug', 'addiction', 'outliving', 'virtually', 'cohorts', 'who', 'traveled', 'same', 'road', 'time', 'only', 'legend', 'never', 'kicked', 'dope', 'was', 'fairly', 'unapologetic', 'Moved', 'place', 'Europe', 'where', 'became', 'something', 'akin', 'God', 'jazz', 'fan', 'especially', 'Italy', 'jail', 'name', 'did', 'it.Of', 'course', 'had', 'traits', 'junkie', 'manipulative', 'selfish', 'focused', 'habit', 'exclusion', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', '.almost', 'continued', 'making', 'great', 'music', 'one', 'extent', 'other', 'up', 'day', 'fell', 'death', 'hotel', 'window', 'film', 'up', 'end', 'great', 'interviews', 'Baker', 'many', 'former', 'cronies', 'friends', 'lovers.It', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'really', 'stunning', 'unusual', 'bio-pic', 'amazingly', 'interesting', 'more', 'point', 'talented', 'guy', 'Look', 'close', 'will', 'see', 'young', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'Flea', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers.Also', 'great', 'book', 'Baker', 'titled', 'Deep', 'A', 'Dream', 'James', 'Gavin']",N/A
260056,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,630165076X,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[0, 0]","There are some music performances and discussions in this video, but it's mainly one set of personal views by and about Chet. A better source for discussions about his music, abilities as a musician and contributions to jazz is Jeroen de Valk'sChet Baker: His Life and Music. That book remains focused on the important elements of Chet, and avoids - as much as possible - the less savory details of his personal life.This video, however, is a glimpse mainly at Chet the person, and details and interview snippets that probably should have been edited out are included in their sordid glory. On the one hand, this is an exercise in voyeurism, but on the other, it gives an honest - actually, brutally frank - picture of aspects of Chet's life. Is it valuable, or even relevant? From an historical perspective I personally believe it will be in time. I mean, who would not want the same frank biography on, say, Buddy Bolden?Another way to view this film is as an inspirational story. I am sure folks who have seen it or are familiar with Chet's life will think I am senile, but consider that despite his life being a trainwreck of his own making, he managed to remain an active and important musician to the end of his life. And he was active and in demand in Europe according to Jeroen de Valk's well-researched book cited above. Moreover, a little less than two years before this film was shot (and Chet's death) we have a video record of Chet as a very competent musician and vocalist inCHET BAKER LIVE AT RONNIE SCOTT'S. So, drug addictions and loose living notwithstanding, the fact that he managed to still make great music in spite of it all is inspiring. Even more so when you factor in his account of having his teeth knocked out - an event that should have ended his career permanently - and he was back playing within six months. So, yes, there is a theme of inspiration in the film (although I am sure it was not intended.)As a Chet Baker fan and as a musician I am thankful that Bruce Weber had the foresight to make this documentary. At the present it's only a cautionary tale, but, perhaps, in the future some of the information may reveal even more about Chet and what it takes to be a musician who made a difference.

Director Bruce Weber's background in still photography translates well to the cool yet lucid look of this grainy black and white film.  I really had little interest in Chet Baker before seeing LET'S GET LOST, but became a huge fan after seeing it.  I went out to one of my favorite music stores and purchased literally every title of his work I could find.  Baker had a very smooth (but not sentimental) and uniquely luminous west coast sound that no one has since duplicated.  This film puts his music and his somewhat tragic life in a historical and artistic context that's both fascinating and heartbreaking.  I saw it only once in 1988, when it was released on a very limited basis in art houses around the country.  But I never forgot it.

If a reviewer purchased the DVD that won't play in the USA (my copy does), this is not the place to complain about such an oversight.  With minimal live footage and virtually no budget, Bruce Weber has produced a cinematic portrait that captures the late and early Chet Baker, or the aging body that retained the purposeless, unguided, foggy and even clueless mind and temperament of a confused and conflicted, impressionable young teenager.  Chet simply went where the music led him, living wholly in the present moment--and with his ""natural"" gifts he, much like a narcissistic child, usually ""got his way""--whether it was musical gigs at a time when Dylan, disco and fusion were the ""in"" thing, or protective and adoring women (each woman friend interviewed in the film insists that Chet ""loved her"" best), or drugs enabling him to ""get lost"" from workaday problems.As fascinating as Chet's life, character and personality were, his music was capable of standing the test of time.  The interview with Jack Sheldon--one of the most underrated, distinctive and identifiable trumpet voices on the scene for the past 50 years--testifies to ""Chetty's"" musicianship.  The accomplished Sheldon, while talking about Chet, sounds like he's in complete awe of Baker's ""superior"" musicianship.Weber may have been short on live footage of Chet Baker (it's practically criminal that no where is there any video of Hank Mobley, one of the most inventive and recorded tenor players of all time), but he makes up for this lack with still photographs which, when juxtaposed, tell the story of Chet's decline--one moment a young Elvis-like face with perfect skin and complexion; the next, a leathery, wrinkled visage that should be enough to scare anyone away from narcotics if not the former ""jazz life"" itself.But Weber retains admiration for Chet regardless of his rapid aging and deterioration, or his problem with elocution following the loss of his teeth.  Far from another sensational, decadent biopic, ""Let's Get Lost"" is a fascinating, informative ""portrait of the artist as a young, then suddenly old, man.""  Although the outer surfaces captured by film show us a weathered face, Weber allows us to enter the psyche of the artist.  It's there that we discover the eternal child of the creative artist who, ever youthful and strangely innocent, simply followed the music wherever it would take him.  In an age of calculating ""careerists,"" or performers who are also their own producers and self-promoters, Chet comes across as as one of a kind, or the last of a breed.  Chet is more famous now than when I caught him in a small club in the 1980s.  He followed his muse, and in the end she took him further than all of those subsequent artist-performers who put, above all else, the lure of the money.Weber doesn't try to enhance Chet's image, yet after seeing this film, you will no doubt wish to pick up copies of both the young and the old Chet Baker--and both as a trumpet player and a vocalist.Chet;Best of Chet Baker Sings;Let's Get Lost.",5,"A testimony to the craft of a creative, resourceful director working without a budget",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,3139,"['complaints', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'content', 'little', 'gem', 'indie', 'film', 'reviewer', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'USA', 'copy', 'not', 'place', 'complain', 'oversight', 'minimal', 'live', 'footage', 'virtually', 'budget', 'Bruce', 'Weber', 'produced', 'cinematic', 'portrait', 'late', 'early', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'aging', 'body', 'retained', 'purposeless', 'unguided', 'foggy', 'even', 'clueless', 'mind', 'temperament', 'confused', 'conflicted', 'impressionable', 'young', 'teenager', 'Chet', 'simply', 'went', 'where', 'music', 'led', 'living', 'wholly', 'present', 'moment', 'natural', 'gifts', 'much', 'narcissistic', 'child', 'usually', 'got', 'way', 'was', 'musical', 'gigs', 'time', 'when', 'Dylan', 'disco', 'fusion', 'were', 'thing', 'protective', 'adoring', 'women', 'woman', 'friend', 'interviewed', 'film', 'Chet', 'loved', 'best', 'drugs', 'enabling', 'get', 'lost', 'workaday', 'problems.As', 'fascinating', 'Chet', 'life', 'character', 'personality', 'were', 'music', 'was', 'capable', 'standing', 'test', 'time', 'interview', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'distinctive', 'identifiable', 'trumpet', 'voices', 'scene', 'past', '50', 'years', 'Chetty', 'musicianship', 'accomplished', 'Sheldon', 'talking', 'Chet', 'complete', 'awe', 'Baker', 'superior', 'musicianship.Weber', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'short', 'live', 'footage', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'practically', 'criminal', 'where', 'there', 'video', 'Hank', 'Mobley', 'one', 'most', 'inventive', 'recorded', 'tenor', 'players', 'time', 'up', 'lack', 'still', 'photographs', 'when', 'juxtaposed', 'tell', 'story', 'Chet', 'decline', 'one', 'moment', 'young', 'Elvis-like', 'face', 'perfect', 'skin', 'complexion', 'next', 'leathery', 'wrinkled', 'visage', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'scare', 'anyone', 'away', 'narcotics', 'not', 'former', 'jazz', 'life', 'itself.But', 'Weber', 'admiration', 'Chet', 'regardless', 'rapid', 'aging', 'deterioration', 'problem', 'elocution', 'following', 'loss', 'teeth', 'Far', 'sensational', 'decadent', 'biopic', 'Let', 'Get', 'Lost', 'fascinating', 'informative', 'portrait', 'artist', 'young', 'then', 'suddenly', 'old', 'man', 'outer', 'surfaces', 'captured', 'film', 'show', 'weathered', 'face', 'Weber', 'enter', 'psyche', 'artist', 'there', 'discover', 'eternal', 'child', 'creative', 'artist', 'who', 'ever', 'youthful', 'strangely', 'innocent', 'simply', 'followed', 'music', 'wherever', 'would', 'take', 'age', 'calculating', 'careerists', 'performers', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'own', 'producers', 'self-promoters', 'Chet', 'across', 'one', 'kind', 'last', 'breed', 'Chet', 'more', 'famous', 'now', 'when', 'caught', 'small', 'club', '1980s', 'followed', 'muse', 'end', 'took', 'further', 'subsequent', 'artist-performers', 'who', 'put', 'else', 'lure', 'money.Weber', ""n't"", 'try', 'enhance', 'Chet', 'image', 'yet', 'seeing', 'film', 'will', 'doubt', 'wish', 'pick', 'up', 'copies', 'young', 'old', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'trumpet', 'player', 'vocalist.Chet', 'Best', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'Sings', 'Let', 'Get', 'Lost']",N/A

Shot in the late 1980s, the film follows Baker's life from his childhood to his late 50s. The portrait that emerges is one of a great musician, but not a great human being.By the late 1980s, Baker was living a drifter's life in Europe; he had no permanent address and he had dissipated after years of drug abuse. One of the frustrating aspects of Let's Get Lost is that Baker is rarely coherent enough to comment intelligently on his life. Most of the insight comes from Baker's friends and family.The portrait painted by Baker's loved ones is not pretty. They describe Baker as a self-absorbed user who cares little about the needs of others. Let's Get Lost includes video of Baker taken during a trip to Los Angeles; he is surrounded by fawning celebrities (Chris Isaak and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) who joke with Baker about his drug habit.Bruce Weber's black-and-white film is beautiful and it is easy to see. The audio is not great; Baker's music sounds excellent, but the conversations between Baker and his friends are difficult to hear. My wife and I watched the film with subtitles and we needed them to grasp what people were saying.It seems sadly logical that Baker died soon after the filming of Let's Get Lost. The film will make viewers appreciate Baker's greatness as a musician; it also makes a subtler point about the ravages of drugs and poor decisions.

As with other region 2 DVD's I own, this is a minor hassle for viewing video's that may never show up in region 1.  Interested buyers need to be cognizant of that.  Get a special DVD player that will play all region disks, as others have recommended, or be prepared to reconfigure your computer's DVD deck to play these disks.  Please don't knock this fine documentary just because of this gross oversight.Now for the film.  It is in black and white, which fits very well with the subject matter.  50's jazz legacy, slightly more naive times, represented in an intimate style, we're just young and foolish trying to have a good time.  The sound is great, Chet plays and sings, obviously older and worn out, but the heart is still there.  I really never knew much about the man until I saw this film.  The interviews with his family members, people he worked with, the old photos, newspaper clippings, sensationalized drug busts, all of it revealing the man himself.  Not a pretty picture, parts of the movie are too prurient for my taste, vitriolic former admirers and so on, but I still recommend it.  This is good glimpse into Chet's life if your new to him.
