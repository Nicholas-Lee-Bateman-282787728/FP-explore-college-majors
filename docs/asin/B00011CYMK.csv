Dot was a faithful and dutiful wife & mother of two, then comes the shock of her life when her husband comes home and tells her that he leaving her, I was floored. Then she found out what happened, why & for how long... she hit the war path after that and rightly so. She sought justice from both parties and got it. Park Overall nailed this character. Kudos to the real Dot Hutelmyer and others who have sought justice for a broken marriage, rather than suffer in silence.",5,I love Park Overall!!!,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,541,"['love', 'movie', 'storyline', 'was', 'well', 'scripted', 'portrayed', 'Dot', 'was', 'faithful', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'mother', 'two', 'then', 'shock', 'life', 'when', 'husband', 'home', 'leaving', 'was', 'floored', 'Then', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'how', 'long', 'hit', 'war', 'path', 'rightly', 'so', 'sought', 'justice', 'parties', 'got', 'Park', 'Overall', 'nailed', 'character', 'Kudos', 'real', 'Dot', 'Hutelmyer', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'sought', 'justice', 'broken', 'marriage', 'rather', 'suffer', 'silence']",The Price of a Broken Heart

790430,APEF45BBSR1IC,B00011CYMK,Karen Schlueter,"[12, 13]","This movie was about a law called ""Alienation Of Affection"" which shows how to get even with mistresses and philanderers who deliberately break up other peoples marriages. In this case, it was about a secretary named [Lynne Cox], and an insurance salesman named [Joe Hutelmyer], who ended up having an alleged affair for three years. At the insurance company where they worked, all their co-workers found out, and Joe's wife, Dot found out through info of a [P.I.] (suggested by a friend of Dot's), and also from the co-workers. So, as a result, [Joe and Lynne] were thrown out of the company. Dot then sued Joe for divorce. She still wanted to get even with Lynne, so she heard about a law called ""Alienation Of Affection"", and sued Lynne for that, and prevailed. She became an instant celebrity receiving phone calls for interveiws on talk and news shows. Eventually in the end, she and Joe agreed to share custody of their two boys, and she also worked with her lawyer on helping other people whose marriages were ruined in the same way.This law is very helpful in getting even with mistresses and philanderers who ruin other peoples lives.",4,The Alienation Of Affection Law Versus Homewreckers,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1143,"['movie', 'was', 'law', 'called', 'Alienation', 'Affection', 'how', 'get', 'even', 'mistresses', 'philanderers', 'who', 'deliberately', 'break', 'up', 'other', 'peoples', 'marriages', 'case', 'was', 'secretary', 'named', '[', 'Lynne', 'Cox', ']', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'named', '[', 'Joe', 'Hutelmyer', ']', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'alleged', 'affair', 'three', 'years', 'insurance', 'company', 'where', 'worked', 'co-workers', 'found', 'Joe', 'wife', 'Dot', 'found', 'out', 'info', '[', 'P.I', ']', 'suggested', 'friend', 'Dot', 'also', 'co-workers', 'So', 'result', '[', 'Joe', 'Lynne', ']', 'were', 'thrown', 'company', 'Dot', 'then', 'sued', 'Joe', 'divorce', 'still', 'wanted', 'get', 'even', 'Lynne', 'heard', 'law', 'called', 'Alienation', 'Affection', 'sued', 'Lynne', 'prevailed', 'became', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'receiving', 'phone', 'calls', 'interveiws', 'talk', 'news', 'shows', 'Eventually', 'end', 'Joe', 'agreed', 'share', 'custody', 'two', 'boys', 'also', 'worked', 'lawyer', 'helping', 'other', 'people', 'marriages', 'were', 'ruined', 'same', 'way.This', 'law', 'very', 'helpful', 'getting', 'even', 'mistresses', 'philanderers', 'who', 'ruin', 'other', 'peoples', 'lives']",The Price of a Broken Heart
