977810,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000ER5NSS,A Customer,"[24, 24]","Light, impressionistic and ethereal, the Australian film Somersault steadily grows on the viewer. Very much reminiscent of this maverick and new wave genre of Australian movie making, in Somersault meaning comes from the very modest and a lot happens when very little is being said. It's where a teenage girl sets off on a sexual and moral coming-of-age odyssey that resonates with remarkable truth and purity.The lovely sixteen-yea-old Heidi (Abbie Cornish) is a bit of a femme fatale. She knows men are attracted to her and she realizes pretty early on that she can probably get whatever she wants from them. After getting caught making out with her Mum's hunky young boyfriend, this lonely and wraithlike girl drifts up to Jindabyne in the Australian Alps of New South Wales.Constantly yearning for male attention, her striking blond looks make her an easy target for the young, vacationing boys - they don't hesitate to take advantage of her. She's also a bit of a party girl and thinks nothing of getting drunk and stoned at the local hangouts. As she tries to find employment - she eventually gets a job working the counter in a service station - she catches the eye of Joe (a terrific Sam Worthington), the son of wealthy landowners.Joe is handsome and likeable enough, although he's very uptight and remains non-committal. At first, he appears to be in it for thrill of sleeping with an underage girl, but his initial hesitancy masks a deep-seated self-loathing, and certain confusion over his sexuality. As much as Heidi needs him, Joe's just too insecure to return her feelings.Of course, this is a world of entrenched snobbery where the sons and daughters of the wealthy landowners look down on working class girls like Heidi. At only sixteen Heidi gradually discovers that her whorish behaviour and limited employment prospects condemn her to the bottom rungs of this picturesque Jindabyne's social ladder. Even the maternal motel owner Irene (a fabulous Lynette Curran) who takes Heidi under her wing, has her patience tried by the unruly and irresponsible girl.Somersault with its arty, indistinct photography and it's otherworldly atmosphere, is very much a portrait of two troubled souls searching for love and respect, but director Cate Shortland is talented enough to show that there isn't an easy way out for this couple. As Heidi drifts through life, keeping a diary and looking at the world almost through a childlike sensibility, Shortland is totally adept at delicately capturing Heidi's lovelorn world.Alternating between glacial, pastel landscapes and burnt-ochre interiors, Summersault is a disturbing portrait of a young girl somewhat at a loss and Cornish's astonishingly empathic performance always stays directly connected to Heidi's troubled soul. Her desire actually seems to protect her from the consequences of some very dire situations. Worthington is also terrific as Joe, with his need to connect with Heidi and his somewhat opaque sexual ambivalence constantly keeping us guessing.Summersault is an accomplished film, another gritty and edgy slice of Australian life - although the film is at times brutal to watch. Heidi's very presence in this small resort town often seems to make adults uncomfortable and boys cruel. There is a definite sense that there is nothing Heidi can do to escape her looks, class and circumstances.

977811,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000ER5NSS,Artist & Author,"[11, 14]","At its core, this is a very intense and uniquely perceptive psychological drama.  Some would consider it to be a coming-of-age movie because it deals with a teen and sexuality; but I think that is far to shallow analysis.  Indeed, this is not a movie about sexual awakening, or even about a girl trying to use sex to get what she wants.  Notwithstanding what some 'feminists' seem to believe, there is an innate need, a yearning within every normal girl for male attention.  But, it goes much further than that; it is not simply for male attention, but for unselfish, loving male attention that says, 'I love you for the unique, feminine, person you are.'  It is a yearning for mature male ratification of a girl's social person, her intellectual person, her spiritual person as well as for her female physical person.  This whole movie is about Heidi's longing for that kind of love.It is too easy to say that when Heidi started to kiss her mother's boyfriend that it was somehow due to her sex drive.  The way we see Heidi as the movie progresses, we see that she really has the emotional maturity of about a nine to ten-year old.  Over and over, when she is by herself, we see her fascinated by things that would more interest a grade schooler than a sixteen-year-old; spraying the hose at the gas station window out of frustration is certainly more childish than even adolescent.  So, when she is with her chronological age-mates she has to act a part that she is emotionally to unable to handle.  She knows that well-adjusted adolescents her age are starting to learn to express their sexual love.  Emotionally, she is still a preadolescent, so she is unable to recognize the mature sexual signals.  Therefore, when her mother's boyfriend shows her the slightest attention, she makes a grave emotional error by responding sexually.A mature man, instead of responding sexually, might have given her a fatherly hug and told her that she was very special, pointing out some of her traits that he saw to be that of a developing fine young lady.  When he didn't respond in the way she really needed, and when her mother freaked out, instead of being a positive event it turned into an emotionally damaging event that left Heidi both bewildered and with a further loss of self-esteem.  Not knowing how to handle the situation, and with no adults in her life who could nudge her toward maturation, she could only think to run away.So, throughout the movie, she responds to negative situations in ways that make her situation worse, lowering her self esteem even more.  The lower her self esteem becomes, the needier a person she becomes.  To Joe's credit (her perceived boyfriend), as he began to see more into the 'inner Heidi' the more he seemed to realize her emotional immaturity so he became less interested in her sexually as he began to care about her.  Also undoubtedly involved, was his own insecurity about dealing with such serious emotional immaturity.  Finally, during the pivotal scene with Irene, Heidi's mature landlord, she finds someone who recognizes her emotional immaturity and insecurity.  Irene's first action is to help Heidi start to deal with her insecurity - by facing up to what she has done by calling her mother.My DVD library consists of more than 2,000 DVDs dealing in some way with children and teens, and I cannot think of any of them that surpasses this movie it is perception and presentation of an emotionally hurting teen.  Abbie Cornish's depiction of such a girl is masterful beyond her years.  Not only is she profoundly believable, the story itself is more than just plausible.  You feel as if you are seeing an actual event.For those who are concerned about such things, there is a bit of coarse language.  However, it is infrequent and just enough to give flavor to the ranching lifestyle.  There are several instances where Heidi's breast are seen, and a couple of scenes where she is totally naked, but curled up to preserve her modesty.  For a few moments she is seen naked outdoors at night from the rear.  One of the young men trying to take advantage of her when she was drunk is seen naked momentarily.  I am grading this movie down a half a rating (so it should be 4-1/2 stars if I could in this forum) because there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for there to be a gayscene, even if it lasts just a couple of seconds.  It would have been far better to use that time showing Joe asking some knowing, mature person how he should behave toward Heidi's problems.With these caveats in mind, I don't think you can find a more true and believable psychological drama.  In fact, it would be interesting to show this movie to child and teen psychology students and to listen to their discussion.  Lacking that opportunity, I'd say to just watch the movie, enjoy it; but don't neglect to also think about girls you might know who are emotionally immature, like Heidi...",5,Is there a Better Psychological Drama on DVD Today?,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,4914,"['core', 'very', 'intense', 'uniquely', 'perceptive', 'psychological', 'drama', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'think', 'far', 'shallow', 'analysis', 'Indeed', 'not', 'movie', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'even', 'girl', 'trying', 'use', 'sex', 'get', 'what', 'Notwithstanding', 'what', ""'feminists"", 'seem', 'believe', 'innate', 'need', 'yearning', 'normal', 'girl', 'male', 'attention', 'much', 'further', 'not', 'simply', 'male', 'attention', 'unselfish', 'loving', 'male', 'attention', 'love', 'unique', 'feminine', 'person', 'are', 'yearning', 'mature', 'male', 'ratification', 'girl', 'social', 'person', 'intellectual', 'person', 'spiritual', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'female', 'physical', 'person', 'whole', 'movie', 'Heidi', 'longing', 'kind', 'love.It', 'too', 'easy', 'say', 'when', 'Heidi', 'started', 'kiss', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'somehow', 'due', 'sex', 'drive', 'way', 'see', 'Heidi', 'movie', 'see', 'really', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'nine', 'ten-year', 'old', 'over', 'when', 'see', 'fascinated', 'things', 'would', 'more', 'interest', 'grade', 'schooler', 'sixteen-year-old', 'spraying', 'hose', 'gas', 'station', 'frustration', 'certainly', 'more', 'childish', 'even', 'adolescent', 'So', 'when', 'chronological', 'age-mates', 'act', 'part', 'emotionally', 'unable', 'handle', 'well-adjusted', 'adolescents', 'age', 'are', 'starting', 'learn', 'express', 'sexual', 'love', 'Emotionally', 'still', 'preadolescent', 'unable', 'recognize', 'mature', 'sexual', 'signals', 'Therefore', 'when', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'slightest', 'attention', 'grave', 'emotional', 'error', 'responding', 'sexually.A', 'mature', 'man', 'instead', 'responding', 'sexually', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'fatherly', 'hug', 'told', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'pointing', 'out', 'traits', 'saw', 'be', 'developing', 'fine', 'young', 'lady', 'When', 'did', ""n't"", 'respond', 'way', 'really', 'needed', 'when', 'mother', 'freaked', 'out', 'instead', 'being', 'positive', 'event', 'turned', 'emotionally', 'damaging', 'event', 'left', 'Heidi', 'bewildered', 'further', 'loss', 'self-esteem', 'Not', 'knowing', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'adults', 'life', 'who', 'could', 'nudge', 'maturation', 'could', 'only', 'think', 'run', 'away.So', 'movie', 'negative', 'situations', 'ways', 'make', 'situation', 'worse', 'lowering', 'self', 'esteem', 'even', 'more', 'lower', 'self', 'esteem', 'needier', 'person', 'Joe', 'credit', 'perceived', 'boyfriend', 'began', 'see', 'more', ""'inner"", 'Heidi', 'more', 'seemed', 'realize', 'emotional', 'immaturity', 'so', 'became', 'less', 'interested', 'sexually', 'began', 'care', 'Also', 'undoubtedly', 'involved', 'was', 'own', 'insecurity', 'dealing', 'such', 'serious', 'emotional', 'immaturity', 'Finally', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Irene', 'Heidi', 'mature', 'landlord', 'someone', 'who', 'emotional', 'immaturity', 'insecurity', 'Irene', 'first', 'action', 'help', 'Heidi', 'start', 'deal', 'insecurity', 'facing', 'up', 'what', 'done', 'calling', 'mother.My', 'DVD', 'library', 'more', '2,000', 'DVDs', 'dealing', 'way', 'children', 'teens', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'perception', 'presentation', 'emotionally', 'hurting', 'teen', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'depiction', 'such', 'girl', 'masterful', 'years', 'Not', 'only', 'profoundly', 'believable', 'story', 'more', 'just', 'plausible', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'actual', 'event.For', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'such', 'things', 'bit', 'coarse', 'language', 'However', 'infrequent', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'flavor', 'ranching', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'several', 'instances', 'where', 'Heidi', 'breast', 'are', 'seen', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'totally', 'naked', 'curled', 'up', 'preserve', 'modesty', 'few', 'moments', 'seen', 'naked', 'outdoors', 'night', 'rear', 'One', 'young', 'men', 'trying', 'take', 'advantage', 'when', 'was', 'drunk', 'seen', 'naked', 'momentarily', 'am', 'grading', 'movie', 'down', 'half', 'rating', 'should', 'be', '4-1/2', 'stars', 'could', 'forum', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'be', 'gayscene', 'even', 'just', 'couple', 'seconds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'use', 'time', 'showing', 'Joe', 'asking', 'knowing', 'mature', 'person', 'how', 'should', 'behave', 'Heidi', 'problems.With', 'caveats', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'true', 'believable', 'psychological', 'drama', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'show', 'movie', 'child', 'teen', 'psychology', 'students', 'listen', 'discussion', 'Lacking', 'opportunity', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'also', 'think', 'girls', 'might', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'Heidi']",Somersault [Region 4]

I caught it on the Sundance channel.It's about a teenage girl who gets into a big argument with her mother and ends up running away from home.In that town where she runs away to she ends up being sort of like 'the girl from the wrong side of the tracks' for awhile.  At such a young age this can be very harmful.This movie reminds us that with personal relationships everyone has issues going on.  Besides the teenage runaway her main boyfriend has some deep issues going on.  Her mother has some problems.  The lady who gives her a room to stay in has some major problems.  Etc..She had some problems along the way but fortunately enough good things happened that everything turned out sort of ok.  It's a more or less positive story but with a somewhat inconclusive ending.  We can at least assume that this girl will look back on her adventure with some happy memories and learning experiences.We know in real life that when a young girl runs away from home by herself many things can happen.

I didn't see any compelling reason why it should during an invitation-only pre-screen.Blonde teenager Heidi (Abbie Cornish) lives in Canberra with her single Mom, Nicole (Olivia Pigeot). In the first of several bad choices, Heidi makes a clumsy attempt to seduce her mother's tattooed boyfriend (Damien De Montemas) - an attempt that's in the first stage of success (because men are sexual pigs) when Nicole walks in. Mom, of course freaks out, driving Heidi to run away by boarding a bus to an Australian winter playground, a dreary place with little play in evidence except a lot of boorish young people getting drunk, only marginal snow, and no shrimps on the barbie.Afraid of loneliness, Heidi begins looking for love in all the wrong places, and eventually forms a fitful relationship with Joe (Sam Worthington), a young man who herds cattle on his emotionally distant father's ranch. Joe, while outwardly the coolest guy in town, is apparently also undergoing a sexual identity crisis of his own. (For a brief moment, I thought we might veer off into a Down Under version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, but, mercifully, the director/writer careened back onto the main road just in time.) Meanwhile, Heidi gets a job clerking in a gas station mini-mart and rents an untenanted flat from a local woman - unoccupied because the woman's son is off in prison.The acting performances are competent enough; the characters are refreshingly everyday real rather than glamorous. SOMERSAULT isn't a bad film, but it struck me as one that might have been considered edgy when produced by Hollywood twenty years ago. Now, it's not worth the ten bucks you'll pay to see it on the American Big Screen. Yes, by the end, Heidi has begun to discover the differences between love, sex, and friendship and is making the transition to street smart Grown-Up, but I just left the theater with a shrug thinking, ""OK, so?""",3,Do you know where your teenage daughter is?,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,2014,"['SOMERSAULT', '2004', 'Australian', 'production', 'won', 'several', 'Aussie', 'Oscars', 'now', 'appear', 'LA', 'art', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'compelling', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'invitation-only', 'pre-screen.Blonde', 'teenager', 'Heidi', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Canberra', 'single', 'Mom', 'Nicole', 'Olivia', 'Pigeot', 'first', 'several', 'bad', 'choices', 'Heidi', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'mother', 'tattooed', 'boyfriend', 'Damien', 'De', 'Montemas', 'attempt', 'first', 'stage', 'success', 'men', 'are', 'sexual', 'pigs', 'when', 'Nicole', 'Mom', 'course', 'freaks', 'out', 'driving', 'Heidi', 'run', 'away', 'boarding', 'bus', 'Australian', 'winter', 'playground', 'dreary', 'place', 'little', 'play', 'evidence', 'lot', 'boorish', 'young', 'people', 'getting', 'drunk', 'only', 'marginal', 'snow', 'shrimps', 'barbie.Afraid', 'loneliness', 'Heidi', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'eventually', 'fitful', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'cattle', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'ranch', 'Joe', 'outwardly', 'coolest', 'guy', 'town', 'apparently', 'also', 'undergoing', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', 'own', 'brief', 'moment', 'thought', 'might', 'veer', 'off', 'Down', 'version', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'mercifully', 'director/writer', 'careened', 'back', 'main', 'road', 'just', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Heidi', 'job', 'clerking', 'gas', 'station', 'mini-mart', 'untenanted', 'flat', 'local', 'woman', 'unoccupied', 'woman', 'son', 'off', 'prison.The', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'competent', 'enough', 'characters', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'everyday', 'real', 'rather', 'glamorous', 'SOMERSAULT', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'struck', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'edgy', 'when', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'not', 'worth', 'ten', 'bucks', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'see', 'American', 'Big', 'Screen', 'Yes', 'end', 'Heidi', 'begun', 'discover', 'differences', 'love', 'sex', 'friendship', 'making', 'transition', 'street', 'smart', 'Grown-Up', 'just', 'left', 'theater', 'shrug', 'thinking', 'OK', 'so']",Somersault [Region 4]

Lonely and struggling to deal with new feelings, she makes a pass at her mother's tattooed boyfriend.  He of course reciprocates, but they are caught by her mother (Olivia Pigeot)), who totally freaks.  Rejected by her mother, a shattered Heidi runs away from home.  Because she is willing to trade her body for a place to stay and transportation, things are not looking promising for Heidi.  Then she has a bit of lucky, because she crosses the path of Joe (Sam Worthington), the son of a farmer, who is drawn to the nymph but is not interested in taking advantage of her.So when she gets in his pickup he takes her to this ski resort town, which is not in the off-season, and there she tries to make a life for herself.  Joe puts her up for the night in a motel run by Irene (Lynette Curran), who is willing to let Heidi stay in the flat behind the place that her son used to stay in as long as she pays rent and does not cause trouble.  Heidi scours the town for a job at gets one working behind the counter at the BP station.  She is way too needy for Joe, who has his own problems, but he sees her from time to time until she asks him if he is her boyfriend.  He does not respond well to pressure and perhaps he is put off by her trashy background.  In fact, that seems to be what most of the people in this town think about her, which is brought home in a scene that is representative of the tenor of this film.At several key moments in ""Somersault,"" the film does exactly that.  You think you know what is about to happen when Heidi is being given a ride and the guy suddenly turns off the road to show her something; but the expected does not happen.  You think that Heidi is forming the nucleus of a new family, but that is not what is happening here either.  What should have been a friendship with Bianca (Hollie Andrew) at the BP, is quickly denied her.  Even when we get to the pivotal moment where a depressed and despondent Heidi decides to become the person that apparently everybody think she is, things do not pan out as we would think either.  It is this ability to surprise me time and time again that fully justifies rounding up on this 2004 film.This is a heartfelt and painful movie, because Heidi is living on the edge, and obviously mistaken sex for love.  We have trouble thinking she is still a little girl, but we never believe she has become a woman.  In her favor is the fact that she is trying to make an honest go of it out on her own.  I was expecting her to start stealing things, but she does not, although she scavenges left over food at the motel.  In fact, one of the signature aspects of her character is that she eats whatever she can at every opportunity.  Heidi is so emotionally numb that that what stands out are the two moments where she loses it.  The first comes when she learns of a cruel lie that adds insult to injury and forces a primal scream of rage out of her.  The other is when she finally breaks and confesses to another person as to what has happened to her, and in that honest moment finds the lifeline she so desperately needs.""Somersault"" is the first feature film by writer-director Cate Shortland, who had previously made a trio of short films.  There are some artistic flourishes throughout the film and a strategic reduction in the color palate, but primarily Shortland has her cinematographer Robert Humphreys go with a hand held camera to create a sense of intimacy with the characters.  The results are quite successful.  ""Somersault"" won 13 Australian Film Institute awards out of 15 nominations (the previous record for wins was 8), with the two it did not win being because it had multiple nominees in the supporting actor and actress categories.  Obviously there is a lot of pressure on Shortland for her new film, which I should think they are eagerly anticipating in Australia, but she appears to be biding her time.

977821,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B000ER5NSS,Margaux Paschke,"[21, 21]","This movie resonated deeply with me as it will with most females but that's not to say that men cannot enjoy it as well.  It's one of those films that both sexes will like but will view it differently.  It's a haunting film about a 16 year old girl coming to terms with her sexuality and finding her way in life.We first met Heidi as her mom's boyfriend sends her into the local bar to get her.  Her mom is annoyed when Heidi shows up (a younger version of herself) as she apparently enjoys the company of fellow male patrons more then staying at home.  Abby is annoyed at her mom for the way she acts with other men.  Typical mother/daughter relations when the daughter starts to become a woman.  But Heidi's first attempts at feminine wiles are inappropriate and have dire consequences.  She's devastated by her own actions as well as her mother's reaction and decides to run away.  Abby goes to a resort town where she thinks she can get a job from a guy she met.  He had given her his card and told her to call if she was ever in the area but of course, he did not really mean it and I felt for her when she made this call.  She is stuck in a town with no place to stay and she does the only thing she knows works (me thinks her mom has not been the best role model), let a man have sex with you in exchange for drinks, a place to stay - fill in the blank really.  Heidi is in that very awkward stage between childhood and becoming a woman.  The actress (Abby Cornish) plays her with amazing skill, her whole body language tells the story.  Heidi soon hooks up with Joe (Sam Worthington) who also wants to ""sleep"" with her but she mistakes his backhanded kindness for love and calls every number in the town's phone book until she tracks him down.  He ignores her.  When they run into each other by accident and Joe does not acknowledge her, Heidi's face tells of immense heartbreak that only a teenager in love can experience.  Of course, they end up back in bed but this quasi-relationship is doomed from the start.  Heidi is devastated by the breakup and becomes even more self-destructive and goes back to trolling bars with disturbing consequences.  Joe, of course, walks in at the worst point and things turn nasty.  At this point, Heidi has no self worth and runs after Joe stark naked to no avail.  Her behavior once again has consequences and she is kicked out of her flat.  Heidi becomes spiteful to the one person who showed her true kindness.  She is at a turning point in her life, she can continue her spiral downward or take responsibility for her actions.  This time her walk around town is not filled with childlike curiosity but a more mature introspection.  She returns to thank the woman who helped her before breaking down in tears and telling her the truth of things.  Heidi's mother is called and arranges to come and bring her back home.  The next time she runs into Joe, Heidi handles it with dignity.  She has grown up.  When we see her mother take her back home, there is hope for the future.The scenes are shot beautifully with great usage of the landscape around them.  The performances were magnificent in their honesty.  This film spoke to the core of my emotions.  It did not require a box of Kleenex although it did leave deep sadness in its wake, a kind of mourning for innocence lost as we reach adulthood and the embarassment over the things we have done as we make our way.",5,coming of age movie from a female perspective,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,3414,"['movie', 'resonated', 'deeply', 'will', 'most', 'females', 'not', 'say', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'films', 'sexes', 'will', 'like', 'will', 'view', 'differently', 'haunting', 'film', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'finding', 'way', 'life.We', 'first', 'met', 'Heidi', 'mom', 'boyfriend', 'local', 'bar', 'get', 'mom', 'annoyed', 'when', 'Heidi', 'up', 'younger', 'version', 'herself', 'apparently', 'company', 'fellow', 'male', 'patrons', 'more', 'then', 'staying', 'home', 'Abby', 'annoyed', 'mom', 'way', 'other', 'men', 'Typical', 'mother/daughter', 'relations', 'when', 'daughter', 'become', 'woman', 'Heidi', 'first', 'attempts', 'feminine', 'wiles', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'have', 'dire', 'consequences', 'devastated', 'own', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'reaction', 'run', 'away', 'Abby', 'resort', 'town', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'job', 'guy', 'met', 'had', 'given', 'card', 'told', 'call', 'was', 'ever', 'area', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'mean', 'felt', 'when', 'made', 'call', 'stuck', 'town', 'place', 'stay', 'only', 'thing', 'works', 'mom', 'not', 'been', 'best', 'role', 'model', 'let', 'man', 'have', 'sex', 'exchange', 'drinks', 'place', 'stay', 'fill', 'blank', 'really', 'Heidi', 'very', 'awkward', 'stage', 'childhood', 'becoming', 'woman', 'actress', 'Abby', 'Cornish', 'amazing', 'skill', 'whole', 'body', 'language', 'story', 'Heidi', 'soon', 'up', 'Joe', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'who', 'also', 'sleep', 'backhanded', 'kindness', 'love', 'number', 'town', 'phone', 'book', 'down', 'When', 'run', 'other', 'accident', 'Joe', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'Heidi', 'face', 'tells', 'immense', 'heartbreak', 'only', 'teenager', 'love', 'can', 'experience', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'back', 'bed', 'quasi-relationship', 'doomed', 'start', 'Heidi', 'devastated', 'breakup', 'even', 'more', 'self-destructive', 'back', 'trolling', 'bars', 'disturbing', 'consequences', 'Joe', 'course', 'walks', 'worst', 'point', 'things', 'turn', 'nasty', 'point', 'Heidi', 'self', 'worth', 'runs', 'Joe', 'stark', 'naked', 'avail', 'behavior', 'once', 'again', 'consequences', 'kicked', 'flat', 'Heidi', 'spiteful', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'showed', 'true', 'kindness', 'turning', 'point', 'life', 'can', 'continue', 'spiral', 'downward', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'time', 'walk', 'town', 'not', 'filled', 'childlike', 'curiosity', 'more', 'mature', 'introspection', 'thank', 'woman', 'who', 'helped', 'breaking', 'down', 'tears', 'telling', 'truth', 'things', 'Heidi', 'mother', 'called', 'arranges', 'come', 'bring', 'back', 'home', 'next', 'time', 'Joe', 'Heidi', 'dignity', 'grown', 'up', 'When', 'see', 'mother', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'hope', 'future.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'great', 'usage', 'landscape', 'performances', 'were', 'magnificent', 'honesty', 'film', 'spoke', 'core', 'emotions', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'did', 'leave', 'deep', 'sadness', 'wake', 'kind', 'mourning', 'innocence', 'lost', 'reach', 'adulthood', 'embarassment', 'things', 'have', 'done', 'make', 'way']",Somersault [Region 4]
977822,A2ZDK3V1OAUB1G,B000ER5NSS,Narizdura La Carretera,"[4, 4]","A very good film about a sensitive subject. I was in a relationship with a person like Heidi's character in the film once, who came out of similar circumstances. Only it didn't have a happy ending like this film. The director/writer wants to make it a coming of age story but a person like Heidi has a personality disorder, close to borderline personality one might guess, and probably based on someone the director knows.You don't grow out of this sort of personality so easily. It's touched on when the boyfriend finds her in her apt with two boys and she claims she did it because she felt neglected. The way she comes back at him when he suggests she has a problem is typical of this personality (and she was right of course, that he had a problem too). This sort of Lolita relationship doesn't take place in a vacuum. In reality it would take two people a long time to get over this, and most likely the girl would continue acting out for many years to come, perhaps into her late 20s or until she sought therapy.So four stars for a very poignant portrayal of a kind of personality that goes beyond the norm, and of entanglements that occur when another sort of personality comes along. One star off for the pseudo-happy ending, where she goes home to her mother and it appears everything will be OK, which rings false.Fiction takes license with these things but the director seems to be striving for emotional realism. In real life the same patterns would most likely be re-enacted again and again over many years.Still this is a film well worth watching, esp for anyone who knows someone like Heidi.

977823,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B000ER5NSS,One More Option,"[4, 4]","This is a sharp film.  As I interpet it, it is a film about people who are out of place.  Each character has neither found what they are looking for nor decided what they are pursuing.  It's a wonderful and familiar journey to watch.The lead character, Heidi (played seamlessly by the actress Abbie Cornish), is a young person in search mode.  She's not sure what she wants, but she is moved by her desires.  Like me, she collects imagery.  She carries with her a scrapbook of fragments of napkins, magazine pictures, written ideas, greeting cards, and other things torn from her travels.  She carries them with her throughout her life to remember where she has been.  The images may not give her clarity and they may not help her determine where she's going to next, but they help her not forget the beauty she glimpsed in memorable moments that have disappeared.Heidi starts the movie by being caught making out with her mother's boyfriend.  This leads her to leave home and to begin looking for work and a place to live on her own.  Prematurely, she has to define her world, her work, and her social structures on her own, with very little exposure to or knowledge of the complexities of those important matters.This film is interested in intelligently exploring, watching, and capturing developing sensory drives and cognitive interpretations.  The film has been controversial because of it's candid sexual situations.  But the controversy is misplaced.  The sexual content is real and necessary for the high degree of intellectual investigation into the multi-layered honest stories.In one scene, Heidi finds a storage room with a stranger's abandoned family photo albums and memorabilia.  Like Heidi, we don't know any of the people. The images have no associative meaning to us.  Yet we can sympathize with the human activity of carefully and painstakingly saving images, objects and ideas from our pasts.  The scene asks the viewer:  What do we keep?  How do we arrange it?  What memories do we take care to frame?As Heidi asks in the film, the film is an exploration of this question:""What do you do if you like someone?""And what do we do with objects that have emotional content for us personally?What do we see?  What do we feel?  What do we taste, hear, and smell?  How do they all combine into intoxicating cocktails?The cinematography regularly asks the question:  What is out of focus?  What is clear?In a world with so many non-sensory and invisible rules, how do we weigh those rules against clear and compellingly pleasant sensations?The movie also asks, ""What does it mean to say, 'I love you.' ""  Why is it that so many people hesitate to say those words?  What do the words mean?  What do those words limit?  What do those words define?In one scene, Heidi does something intentionally to hurt herself.  As with anyone who hurts themself, we don't know all the reasons why, but we can probably infer some of the reasons fairly accurately.  And we are sometimes defined by how we respond to those incidents.This movie is great.  It's worth full attention and consideration.  It's worth repeat viewings.Toward the end of the film, as Heidi's failures cascade, she takes a walk and glimpses her friend's younger brother, a boy with Asberger's Syndrome, a dysfunction that inhibits empathy - the ability to read and relate to others' visual and verbal emotional signals.

The male is equally confused about his sexuality, aware that Heidi harbours even greater neediness than himself, albeit with less potentially damaging outcomes. The interpay with the child who has Aspergers syndrome echoes much of Heidi's behaviour. Her resort to what appears a very adolescent diary and her enacment in front of the mirror will disturb as it elucidates. Her curiosity about the lad, and a flash of her observing him on a trampoline suggest her realization of this.Congratulations to the team that accomplished this masterful and moving story.I reckon it's tackled an extremley urgent issue with sensitive aplomb.",4,Head over Heels with Heidi,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,826,"['Very', 'tough', 'little', 'film', 'totally', 'believable', 'performance', 'Cornish', 'Heidi', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'confusion', 'sex', 'love', 'damaging', 'prevalent', 'feature', 'contemporary', 'life', 'male', 'equally', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'aware', 'Heidi', 'harbours', 'even', 'greater', 'neediness', 'less', 'potentially', 'damaging', 'outcomes', 'interpay', 'child', 'who', 'Aspergers', 'syndrome', 'echoes', 'much', 'Heidi', 'behaviour', 'resort', 'what', 'very', 'adolescent', 'diary', 'enacment', 'front', 'mirror', 'will', 'disturb', 'curiosity', 'lad', 'flash', 'observing', 'trampoline', 'suggest', 'realization', 'this.Congratulations', 'team', 'accomplished', 'masterful', 'moving', 'story.I', 'tackled', 'extremley', 'urgent', 'issue', 'sensitive', 'aplomb']",Somersault [Region 4]

It's about a young woman whose budding sexuality gets her in trouble (she sleeps with her mother's boyfriend) so she runs away from home to a resort commuinty high in the mountains somewhere in Austraila.  There she meets a young man she develops a fancy for, but he is dealing with issues of his own.  This was a magnificent film that deserved far more theatrical atttention than it got.  Film Festival crowds loved it!  I talked to programmers of film festivals who raved about it.  But, for some reason theatrical distributors gave it only nominal attention.

977827,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000ER5NSS,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[6, 8]","This is a downbeat film that threatens often to turn into tragedy, as a runaway teenager, with the ironically innocent name of Heidi, looks unsuccessfully for a place in the world and in other people's hearts. Loneliness, in fact, seems to prevail as characters reach ineffectually toward each other, often coming away empty-handed.Shot in winter in the mountains of New South Wales, where local ski resorts provide a tourist economy and a flood of young people looking for fun and casual encounters, the film brings Heidi together with a local boy who has troubles enough of his own and is running away from them with hard drinking. While he eventually rebuffs her overtures of affection, a new friendship with a convenience store co-worker is soured by the girl's father, and a motel manager whose son is doing time rents her a room but proves there are limits to her generosity.Beautifully filmed, with an effort to capure images of ice, cold nights, snow and fog to represent the isolation of its characters, this movie is a harsh story of the heart's hunger for love and acceptance. As such, it is an adult treatment of that subject and while there is a kind of resolution at the end, the dark undertones of a tragedy averted dominate the final images.
