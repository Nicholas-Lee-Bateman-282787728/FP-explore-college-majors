1422837,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B004OA684O,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[6, 18]","""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" both have strengths and weaknesses.""Gettysburg"" is a mostly good movie with the sort of epic scope we thought we would never see again after the death of David Lean.  It's the kind of movie we thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make.  It's also rousing.  Is there a boy reared in the south who did not sit in the theater actually believing this time Pickett's charge would break through?One weakness of the movie is Martin Sheen's miserable performance as Robert E. Lee.  The novel's author Michael Shaara describes Lee as under the weather during the battle.  May be.  Sheen's Lee seems to be suffering from Alzheimer's.  He's waffling, indecisive, ineffective, far from the commander Lee actually was.  And he was not suffering from mental problems.  After the war he went on to Washington College (now Washington and Lee) and was one of the chief figures in healing the rejoined United States after the war.  Southern accents are difficult in the best of times for non-southerners (the Brits do it best).  Sheen, from Ohio, hasn't a clue.  His performance nearly kills an otherwise good movie and I cannot watch ""Gettysburg"" again because of it.Another flaw is that Michael Shaara's novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975, was based on the best scholarship on the battle available at the time.  Since then, new scholarship has revised our understanding of strategic decisions made by the participants.  These new ideas probably should have been incorporated into the film.  Since when has Hollywood cared about fidelity to a novel, anyway?""Gettysburg"" also leans too heavily in favor of Longstreet who, more than anyone, is a central player in this game.  That bit of historical revisionism did make it in the film but I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinions.The otherwise fine cast pulls the movie through to the finish line, particularly Jeff Daniels as the Yank Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and the Reb General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, very affecting in his final film role;  every actor who was once a star should have such an exit).""Gods and Generals"" has almost diametrically opposed strengths and weaknesses.  One thing is does right is cast Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee.  Duvall's Lee is the heart of this film. And a game cast does its best playing soldier.  What ""God"" lacks that ""Gettysburg"" had is focus.  It tries to do too much with one movie, following the war from just after the outbreak of hostilities when Lee was offered command of the defense of Washington (April 18, 1861) until the death of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville -- just a few months before Gettysburg.  That's a lot of information for one movie.I had hoped the extended version of ""Gods"" would keep the movie from feeling so jumpy and forced, but it only adds more boring stuff to what's there already.In both movies, keep an eye peeled for James Patrick Stuart from ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"" as artillery commander and post-war scribe Porter Alexander;  and in ""Gods"" watch for William Sanderson -- Larry, brother of Darryl in ""Newhart"" -- as Confederate General A. P. Hill.A third installment, about the end of the war, was planned, but it was shelved when ""Gods"" tanked at the box office.  It's just as well.",2,IT'S TOO BAD WE CAN'T MIX AND MATCH,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,3280,"['Gettysburg', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Gettysburg', 'mostly', 'good', 'movie', 'sort', 'epic', 'scope', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'death', 'David', 'Lean', 'kind', 'movie', 'thought', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'make', 'also', 'rousing', 'there', 'boy', 'reared', 'south', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'theater', 'actually', 'believing', 'time', 'Pickett', 'charge', 'would', 'break', 'One', 'weakness', 'movie', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'miserable', 'performance', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'novel', 'author', 'Michael', 'Shaara', 'Lee', 'weather', 'battle', 'May', 'be', 'Sheen', 'Lee', 'be', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'waffling', 'indecisive', 'ineffective', 'far', 'commander', 'Lee', 'actually', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'suffering', 'mental', 'problems', 'war', 'went', 'Washington', 'College', 'now', 'Washington', 'Lee', 'was', 'one', 'chief', 'figures', 'healing', 'rejoined', 'United', 'States', 'war', 'Southern', 'accents', 'are', 'difficult', 'best', 'times', 'non-southerners', 'Brits', 'do', 'best', 'Sheen', 'Ohio', ""n't"", 'clue', 'performance', 'nearly', 'otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'Gettysburg', 'again', 'it.Another', 'flaw', 'Michael', 'Shaara', 'novel', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1975', 'was', 'based', 'best', 'scholarship', 'battle', 'available', 'time', 'then', 'new', 'scholarship', 'revised', 'understanding', 'strategic', 'decisions', 'made', 'participants', 'new', 'ideas', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'incorporated', 'film', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'cared', 'fidelity', 'novel', 'anyway', 'Gettysburg', 'also', 'too', 'heavily', 'favor', 'Longstreet', 'who', 'more', 'anyone', 'central', 'player', 'game', 'bit', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'suppose', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'opinions.The', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'cast', 'movie', 'finish', 'line', 'particularly', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Yank', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'Reb', 'General', 'Lewis', 'Armistead', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'very', 'affecting', 'final', 'film', 'role', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'star', 'should', 'have', 'exit', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'almost', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'One', 'thing', 'right', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Duvall', 'Lee', 'heart', 'film', 'game', 'cast', 'best', 'playing', 'soldier', 'What', 'God', 'Gettysburg', 'had', 'focus', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'movie', 'following', 'war', 'just', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'when', 'Lee', 'was', 'offered', 'command', 'defense', 'Washington', 'April', '18', '1861', 'death', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Chancellorsville', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'Gettysburg', 'lot', 'information', 'one', 'movie.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'extended', 'version', 'Gods', 'would', 'keep', 'movie', 'feeling', 'so', 'jumpy', 'forced', 'only', 'more', 'boring', 'stuff', 'what', 'already.In', 'movies', 'keep', 'eye', 'peeled', 'James', 'Patrick', 'Stuart', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'Controls', 'Universe', 'artillery', 'commander', 'post-war', 'scribe', 'Porter', 'Alexander', 'Gods', 'watch', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'Larry', 'brother', 'Darryl', 'Newhart', 'Confederate', 'General', 'A.', 'P.', 'Hill.A', 'third', 'installment', 'end', 'war', 'was', 'planned', 'was', 'shelved', 'when', 'Gods', 'tanked', 'box', 'office', 'just', 'as', 'well']",Gettysburg / Gods and Generals

1422842,A3P98J5DZ00A75,B004OA684O,"Ken Roberts ""social historian""","[35, 41]","When I saw that Warner Bros. was finally going to release Gods & Generals and Gettysburg in the director's cut format I was elated beyond belief. These two movies are at the top of my list of Civil War movies. Yes, I know about some of the inaccuracies - it's unfortunate that most (if not all) historical movies have their faults - but I still really love these two movies up and beyond all others of their genre.Being as anxious as I was, I did not want to wait until July for the box set and ended up purchasing both as individuals upon their release in May. Now, before I get into the actual reviews of the movies themselves I would like to review the packaging. The individual release packaging was one of the best I have seen for any movie. Not only does one receive the extended director's cut of both movies but a full booklet with each set! These booklets include notes from Ron Maxwell himself, information about the battles, the actors and the historical figures they portray, and loads of photos. There is also plenty of Civil War facts and figures including a time line.I was like a kid at Christmas...better yet, these sets were released two days after my birthday - what a gift!Let's jump up a couple of months and I'm at the local department store and I see the Box Set of both movies. By purchasing this set I would also receive (besides the movies themselves) a commemorative bronze Lincoln coin, a 40 page photo booklet of Civil War artifacts and correspondence, a 32 page booklet from Time magazine's new book on the Civil War, and even a two-sided historical map. Okay, being the Gettysburg and Gods & Generals fan that I am. I went home and found it even cheaper on Amazon, so I shelled out the bucks (a good discount, I might add, so re-buying the movies wasn't too terribly wasteful) for the set. I figured I can give the extra movies away as a gift.I have to admit I was slightly disappointed. Not necessarily in the items that came with the box set itself, but with the disc packaging: the awesome booklets that were in my May releases were nowhere to be found. Instead, the packagings of both movies were in simple average Blu Ray plastic boxes. I would have thought, without question, that the very same packaging from May would have been included in this collector's box set. I must say I am now glad I purchased the movies individually instead of only waiting for the box. To me, as a collector, it was well worth the money (especially at the discounted pricing). But, because of WB chinsing on the packaging for the box, I gave this set 4 instead of 5 stars.So, now I am going to give away the box set discs and just slide in the booklet versions (I had to remove the cardboard insert from the box - no big deal) and I will have the ultimate Gods & Generals and Gettysburg Box Set!Now for the movies:GODS & GENERALS:Gods and Generals does a very good job at depicting the earlier battles of the Civil War. Although it's always leaned heavily toward the southern point of view in its original form, this new director's cut has been divided into chapters and totally re-edited to fit in the extra hours worth of scenes, some of which include involving President Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, more of the Chamberlains, and, especially for fans of battles, Antietam. It now gives a more balanced perspective of North and South. Because the entire movie has been re-edited in this way I don't believe I could watch the original theatrical release again. Yes, all the scenes are there - intact - but the entire movie is so much less choppy and so much more cohesive (it would have been nice to show the picnicking civilians at Manassas - oh well...).A couple of my favorite parts of the newly restored scenes includes the showing of camp life in a union camp, including teaching the new recruits the way to load and fire a gun, and the meeting of Joshua and Fannie Chamberlain with actor Booth.Pay close attention to the other actor who is with Booth toward the end of the movie...Gods & Generals has much more drama than most battle-oriented films, but that just gives the viewer a much more well-rounded feeling of life during the early 1860's.GETTYSBURG:Except for a few exceptions (why are there always exceptions?) Gettysburg is another MOSTLY historically correct film. I feel the biggest reason for this is due to the fact that re-enactors have played such a prominent role in the making of both of these films, making sure that they're as historically correct as the producers would allow, right down to the buttons on the uniforms worn by the fighting men (yes, yes, I KNOW about the facial hair, but those aren't re-enactors! Blame the costume/make up people on that!). And the battle scenes are as realistic as can possibly be done. When you watch the men during Pickett's charge and see the anguished look on the general's face during the aftermath, one gets the feeling of actually witnessing the carnage that took place.And the Little Round Top scene will get your heart beating just as it must have beat in the men who were there. Truly gripping.Another very long but engulfing movie filled with battles and tactics, this truly brings the viewer into the horrific time of early July 1863.Both movies help to bring the people of the Civil War alive - the men on both sides who fought in this war are no longer just old sepia-toned pictures in a history book, or silly 1950's b-movie style characters, but real men who fought and died horrible deaths. I wish more historical epics would use re-enactors in the movie making process (The Conspirator did!). They truly help bring the past to life.Jeff Shaara, author of the original book on which Gods & Generals is based, stated in an interview (from the Gods and Generals magazine), ""Hollywood has a dismal record of portraying history. Historical films have one purpose - to make money - and it seems they have two means of realizing that. One, tell a story the studio thinks the audience wants to see, and thus tilt the story to whatever political correctness is in vogue. The second purpose is to allow one particular big time actor the chance to do 'cool things' on the screen. Though many of these films are entertaining, the one thing missing is any responsibility to give the audience the truth about the event being portrayed.""It's unfortunate that too many people take Hollywood historical movies as fact and the majority of movie watchers usually do not get a good part of the truth. Gods & Generals and Gettysburg are different - they do a better job than most at accuracy. Do not let the length scare you off. From beginning to end, I was held to my seat, greatly anticipating the next scene of both films.I highly recommend purchasing both movies - whether through the box set or individually - and spending a weekend (and it will take an entire weekend!) in the early 1860's.By the way, I would absolutely love to see a movie showing what the civilians of the town of Gettysburg had to endure during that summer - and even into November for Lincoln's visit - of 1863. Many folks do not realize what they went through during (and for months after) the battle. Every bit as exciting as the battle itself!One more thing, if you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and(A) take a trip to Gettysburg to see for yourself the awesome battlefields and still-intact town. And it's within an hour from Antietam, an hour and a half from Harper's Ferry, and just a few hours from most other east coast battle fields. It would be a vacation steeped in history.(B) Go to a Civil re-enactment and see for yourself the excitement of battle.Thank you to all involved for bringing our history to life accurately!",4,Great

How so many truly bright men on both sides failed to stop the whole thing...Lee has since been surmised as maybe having some mini strokes and was sleep deprived at this point.

This newer version has more life to it and is certainly more cohesive.We see more sides to Stonewall Jackson. He's less of the ""Santa Claus-like"" character some labeled him as in the theatrical release. Perhaps just as important is that his character doesn't dominate this version as it did in the original.

1422850,A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6,B004OA684O,"Scott Anderson ""Sharpsburg""","[21, 26]","I'm taking a leap in faith or as some would say, going out on a limb to give this review.  Before my life became absorbed with War, History, Cooking and Family I enjoyed casual reading on the Civil War and read Killer Angels in fits and spurts before Gettysburg hit the big screen. I worked my way through college earning a BA in History and an MA in Social Sciences, and ended up studying the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam.I then moved to Shepherdstown WV, the very doorstep to Antietam National Battlefield.  In doing so I finished my masters degree by completing my thesis on ""Afternoon at Lower Bridge"", focusing on the tactics and strategy that took place at the Lower Bridge, now known as Burnside Bridge.  I came to realize that there were a lot of different perspectives, viewpoints and theories on what took place, and the only thing we know today is that the battle took place on that hallowed ground.  Everything else is up for speculation, including the thoughts of the commanders, soldiers and even more so the historians that later transposed the early words of those that fought the battles.With that being said these movies are interpretations of what took place on the battlefields 150 years ago.  True, we know who fought on what side, but other than that, we really don't know exactly what took place.  Suffice to say Battlefield Historians, Park Rangers, Noted Historians and Tour Guides that have spent years studying the war and they are the ones we need to go to for exact information.With that being said I really enjoyed the 1 hr addition to Gods and Generals, and loved seeing the theatrical release of Gettysburg last week at the Gettysburg Visitor Center hosted by Ron Maxwell.  The extended version of Gettysburg has an additional 17 minutes and it was nice to here Ron's words as to why they produced the movie.  It was also shocking to see that at least 20 in the audience had never seen the movie and this was their first time.Gods and Generals really filled out with addition of cutting room floor video such as the John Wilkes Booth subplot, Antietam battle scenes and reworking the entire movie to flow better.  It really gives you a wonderful cinematographic representation of what took place leading up to Gettysburg, and you need to take it in with a grain of salt.  If you want exacting science then take the time to walk the fields and read into what the soldiers said and ask park rangers to explain what took place.  Remember this movie was historically based but there is always room for artistic licensing and movie drama to make a good picture.Gettysburg is pretty much the way it was when it came out with snippets here and there added in and I've not had the complete opportunity to fully watch the extended version from start to finish.  When I get the chance I'll spend some time watching Gettysburg uninterrupted and come back to give a final accounting as to the extended version.The Limited Collectors Edition with Sesquicentennial coin, booklets of Civil War information and nice storage box make a nice movie package.  I recommend this package to anyone interested in a well research theatrical version of the Civil War.  My apologies to anyone I may have offended, but as my good friend Ed Bearss told me, ""...movies get people to the battlefield to walk the grounds to see and understand what happened and to talk to the rangers about what took place.""One last point to make - The Blu-ray version at the Gettysburg Visitor Center is selling for $130.00 and the DVD version is selling for $100.00.

1422851,A8ZZW9PL112AI,B004OA684O,S. Craig,"[3, 4]","Just when I thought nothing more could be done to Gettysburg to improve or add to it, the 150th Commemorative edition is released and I am drawn to it again like a moth to a flame. Ron Maxwell's fifteen year odyssey to bring the movie to life and onto the big screen was finally realised once Ted Turner agreed to bankroll the film.  It's easy to see that this film is a labor of love for Maxwell and at four and a half hours long when first released, who would have thought that the addition of another 17 minutes of compelling footage would contribute any further benefit to the movie or possibly make it flow any better - but it does!As for the Gettysburg prequel, I remember when God's and General's was first released and the confusion of many members of the audience who did not have a strong grasp of American Civil War history - their movie experience was totally lost on the cutting room floor.  Now, with the release of the Director's cut the movie finally has order and a structure that can be followed without being an ACW Historian. The first observation to hit me was that the structure that was missing from God's and General's before was now in place. How? Well it seems to me that the film has now been divided into five distinct parts: Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Moss Neck, and finally Chancellorsville. This definitely allows the film to actually guide its Audience through the first three years of the war. The structure is so complete that each section, like acts from a play, provides the mental map of events that was missing from the original film, which is an essential addition when you consider the complexity of the characters, story and the length of this film.In the new cut, Antietam is an incredible experience. There is also the appearance of John Wilkes Booth into the movie, which provides an interesting insight into the actor(and assassin to be) during the early years of the war. However, be aware that there is not just the addition of new scenes, but the reduction and removal of others. Some scenes have actually been either shortened, or removed and to give you a hint of what isn't there so much anymore, don't expect to sit through the constant preaching and praying that was in the original theatrical release.",5,"Finally, what we have all been waiting for!",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2264,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'nothing', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'Gettysburg', 'improve', 'add', '150th', 'Commemorative', 'edition', 'released', 'am', 'drawn', 'again', 'moth', 'flame', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'fifteen', 'year', 'odyssey', 'bring', 'movie', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'finally', 'realised', 'once', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'agreed', 'bankroll', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'film', 'labor', 'love', 'Maxwell', 'four', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'addition', '17', 'minutes', 'compelling', 'footage', 'would', 'contribute', 'further', 'benefit', 'movie', 'possibly', 'make', 'flow', 'better', 'Gettysburg', 'prequel', 'remember', 'when', 'God', 'General', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'confusion', 'many', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'strong', 'grasp', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'totally', 'lost', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Now', 'release', 'Director', 'cut', 'movie', 'finally', 'order', 'structure', 'can', 'be', 'followed', 'being', 'ACW', 'Historian', 'first', 'observation', 'hit', 'was', 'structure', 'was', 'missing', 'God', 'General', 'before', 'was', 'now', 'place', 'How', 'Well', 'film', 'now', 'been', 'divided', 'five', 'distinct', 'parts', 'Manassas', 'Antietam', 'Fredericksburg', 'Moss', 'Neck', 'finally', 'Chancellorsville', 'definitely', 'film', 'actually', 'guide', 'Audience', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'war', 'structure', 'so', 'complete', 'section', 'acts', 'play', 'mental', 'map', 'events', 'was', 'missing', 'original', 'film', 'essential', 'addition', 'when', 'consider', 'complexity', 'characters', 'story', 'length', 'new', 'cut', 'Antietam', 'incredible', 'experience', 'also', 'appearance', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'movie', 'interesting', 'insight', 'actor', 'assassin', 'be', 'early', 'years', 'war', 'However', 'be', 'aware', 'not', 'just', 'addition', 'new', 'scenes', 'reduction', 'removal', 'others', 'scenes', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'shortened', 'removed', 'give', 'hint', 'what', ""n't"", 'there', 'so', 'much', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sit', 'constant', 'preaching', 'praying', 'was', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release']",Gettysburg / Gods and Generals

Rice Jr.,"[6, 7]","Gettysburg / Gods and Generals (Limited Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]When I opened this Limited Collector's Edition packaging of ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" extended director cuts of these two films, plus the additional ""keepsakes"", I immediately got the impression that these movies were coming packaged in a cigar box, though I missed the distinctive tobacco smell of a cigar box. :-) Of the ""keepsakes"", I felt that the most valuable was that of the National Geographic map of Civil War battlefields, that locates not only the major battles, but also minor skirmishes throughout the major theaters of the Civil War. I shall come back to this map often. Now, on to the movies. I will first review the Blu-ray release of ""Gettysburg"", then ""Gods and Generals"":Gettysburg: WHAT MASTER WAS USED FOR THE BD TRANSFER?An excellent film is hampered in its Director's Cut release by what appears to be a multi-generational master and not the original film master. Contrast is too great in shadows and some bright areas are too brilliant. If technicians doing high definition transfers don't use the original film master, BD will bring out what defects there are in the master used. The BD transfer does bring out fine details, such as battle flags and the crude weave in the cloth used for Confederate officer uniforms.One scene was added to the Director's Cut with Lee addressing General Ewell and his officers as to why Cemetery Ridge wasn't taken, which was important. If anything, it needed to be with the original release. The addition of the other scenes missing from the original release don't really add to the overall pace of the action.This film has held a special place in my heart ever since it came out, and I'm sorry that my father predeceased its production and release. I'm sure he would have greatly enjoyed it, as he was an avid Civil War historian, as I am. Additionally, I'm sorry that a better quality master was not used for the BD transfer; we can only hope that a better transfer will happen some day.Gods and Generals: NEW EXTENDED DIRECTOR'S CUT IMPROVES COHERENCY OF AN IMPORTANT CIVIL WAR FILMWith the additional hour of cut scenes from the theatrical release reinstated into this extended director's cut, it was good that Executive Producer Ted Turner and Producer Ronald Maxwell agreed to divide this very long film into five distinct segments to allow the average moviegoer not all that knowledgeable in Civil War history to take it in in chapters, as if he/she were reading a novel. That is the major plus for this edition, and was done similarly for the three days of their earlier film, ""Gettysburg"". The other was the reinstatement of the Antietam portion of the film. Plus, the reinstatement of previously cut camp life scenes helped add to the human interest side of the characters.But I feel that there are still problems with the film. The majority of my comments are based on my earlier reading of Jeff Sharra's novel of the same name, upon which the movie is based, plus some other elements unique to the film itself:1) I don't know why it was decided to insert a subplot involving John Wilkes Booth. Booth had no involvement whatsoever in the original novel, and his scenes as a noncombatant were a distraction and I felt they detracted somewhat from the flow and effect of the action.2) The novel had greater involvement of Union General Winfield Scott Hancock. As with the theatrical release, Hancock is still relegated to a minor role in the extended director's cut, though a couple scenes involving him were reinstated in the Fredericksburg segment. The novel had him more involved in the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, which unfortunately was apparently not scripted for the movie at all. Greater involvement of Hancock along with that of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain would likely have balanced out the film toward a more neutral stance instead of being heavily-balanced toward that of Lee and Jackson, possibly helping to improve its performance at the box office during its theatrical run.3) There was a situation where I felt there was questionable film editing. The Moss Neck segment included scenes post-battle from Fredericksburg that should have remained with the Fredericksburg segment. Moss Neck should have started properly at the point with the Christmas Day celebration of the Southern generals and women.Quality of the BD video transfer and audio were excellent, with notable improvement to the audio from that of the previous BD theatrical cut release.",4,INTERESTING PACKING OF TWO CLASSIC CIVIL WAR FILMS,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,4513,"['Gettysburg', '/', 'Gods',
