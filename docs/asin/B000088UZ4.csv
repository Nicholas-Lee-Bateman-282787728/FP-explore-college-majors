735201,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000088UZ4,Andy Orrock,"[12, 16]","First of all, if you made it here, congratulations!  This movie is hard to find.  Released in Spain as ""Segunda Piel"" and in the UK/US as ""Second Skin,"" amazon.com has filed it oddly under ""Secondskin.""  The only way to get here was to hop over to amazon's imdb.com affiliate, put in Javier Bardem's name, find ""Segunda Piel,"" then use the link there to hop back over to amazon.Phew.Anyway, this movie is a real treat, up until the last 10 minutes or so.  Bardem plays a gay man again (albeit, *quite* different than his superb playing of Reinaldo Arenas in ""Before Night Falls""), this time falling for married man Jordi Molla.As good as I expected Bardem to be, Molla is even better.  He's a confused soul.  He's got anguish all over his face and in every little nuanced action (the self-conscious, repetitious patting down of his hair is but one perfect touch).Bardem and Molla go further here in the portrayal of the physical aspects of their relationship than you could ever expect two equivalent American stars to go.  These are two of Spain's leading actors.  As a good exercise, try to picture Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in these scenes.  Wouldn't happen.The ending is a copout though.  Very disappointing.  There had to be a better way to end it than the cheap exit taken by the filmmakers.  Still though, it can't spoil two fearless performances by Bardem and Molla.",4,Bardem: fearless; Molla: even better; the ending: a copout,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,1373,"['First', 'all', 'made', 'here', 'congratulations', 'movie', 'hard', 'find', 'Released', 'Spain', 'Segunda', 'Piel', 'UK/US', 'Second', 'Skin', 'amazon.com', 'filed', 'oddly', 'Secondskin', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'here', 'was', 'hop', 'amazon', 'imdb.com', 'affiliate', 'put', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'name', 'find', 'Segunda', 'Piel', 'then', 'use', 'link', 'there', 'hop', 'back', 'amazon.Phew.Anyway', 'movie', 'real', 'treat', 'up', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'Bardem', 'gay', 'man', 'again', 'albeit', '*quite*', 'different', 'superb', 'playing', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'Night', 'Falls', 'time', 'falling', 'married', 'man', 'Jordi', 'Molla.As', 'good', 'expected', 'Bardem', 'be', 'Molla', 'even', 'better', 'confused', 'soul', 'got', 'anguish', 'face', 'little', 'nuanced', 'action', 'self-conscious', 'repetitious', 'patting', 'hair', 'one', 'perfect', 'touch', '.Bardem', 'Molla', 'go', 'further', 'here', 'portrayal', 'physical', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'could', 'ever', 'expect', 'two', 'equivalent', 'American', 'stars', 'go', 'are', 'two', 'Spain', 'leading', 'actors', 'good', 'exercise', 'try', 'picture', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'scenes', 'Would', ""n't"", 'happen.The', 'ending', 'copout', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'had', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'end', 'cheap', 'exit', 'taken', 'filmmakers', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'two', 'fearless', 'performances', 'Bardem', 'Molla']",N/A

735203,AO4A961ZKHJPL,B000088UZ4,"Enrique Torres ""Rico""","[4, 54]","This movie came across to me much  like a telenovela(soap opera), full of drippy melodrama and a musical score that was way over the top. If you are reading these customer reviews you  probably already have the gist of the plot. Elena and Al are married with one child and Al is having an affair with Diego. If there is a twist from the telenovela formula it is that Diego and Al are both men. I got this movie because I like Javier Bardem as an actor and knew nothing of the storyline,otherwise I may have chosen to pass. I'm far from a prude but I must admit this was a most uncomfortable movie to watch. I think I would have died if one of my sons or their friends had come in and seen me watching this movie; nothing could explain what was going on the screen. It is from my perspective not one to watch with your children by any means, unless of course you are far more liberal than me. I asked my wife if she wanted to see it and she read the synopsis and said, &quot;no, I've seen enough gay movies.&quot; Up to this point I was unaware of what I was in for!  When the &quot;hot steamy&quot; scenes came on I wanted to crawl under my couch least someone walk in. It made me feel terribly uncomfortable. Two  naked men writhing about like snakes, intertangled in each others embrace and kissing, leaving not much for the  imagination was too much for me. As I thought about what they were doing I felt a bit disgusted. I had never seen something like that and hope never to again. I just would like to warn other like minded people, who are open to gays but don't necessarily want to see their lifestyle that this movie pushes the envelope. The movie carries on with the dillema faced by the three people involved and eventually things get tragically resolved. Very good acting, especially Javier Bardem but for the most part but the characters and storyline was lacking in substance. I cannot say it was an enjoyable movie but rather a curious bit of filmmaking pushing an agenda. Get the movie if you like but be forwarned of the nudity and gay &quot;lovemaking&quot; scenes or if you are so inclined get it because of those scenes.

735204,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000088UZ4,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[11, 18]","I really had looked forward to this movie. Having seen Javier Burdem in ""Before Night Falls"" I was thrilled that he was appearing in another (supposedly) intense ""gay-themed"" film. He is truly a gifted actor! After viewing ""Second Skin"" I'm afraid that I was very disappointed. Javier Burdem, as wonderful and gorgeous as he is, could not, for me, save this movie from being merely a melodrama. To me, at best, it was on the level of a very slim ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" Sunday night family presentation.  ...The acting, by all three of the actors, is superb; however, to me, the characters were not developed enough to make them believable or, at least, interesting. I just could not buy Javier as Diego being so wimpy that he allowed Jordi Molla, as Alberto to ""use"" him as he did--Give me a break, Diego, as played by Javier, is a gorgeous hunk of a man PLUS a successful medical doctor, for god's sake!! I know that love can make you be a complete idiot, but Javier's character was impossible for me to comprehend. We, the audience, needed to be given some clue as to why Diego acted so irrationally having no backbone, of any sort, when it came to Alberto (was it low self-esteem, was he abused as a child or was he just stupid?) No hint is given as to why he played a ""door-mat"" for Alberto allowing him to treat him very badly--Alberto disappears for weeks at a time without Diego being able to contact him; when they finally go away together for one of Diego's Medical Conventions all Alberto does is try to prove that he really, really isn't gay by flirting with Diego's good female friend then getting mad and spending the night away from the hotel where they are staying and acting all [mad], the next day, when Diego tries to find out ""what is the matter"" and to offer some comfort. We, the audience, need to have some small clue as to why Diego would allow this mistreatment without losing his temper and beating him to a pulp or at least calling him a few bad names.The character of Alberto, as played by Jordi Molla, is a complete puzzle to me. Due to a lack of any depth, in the movie, I just got the feeling  that he was a man that simply ""wanted his cake and eat it too"". (a nice cozy ""safe"" family life and a hot, sexy boyfriend on the side--...) All he could state was that he loved his wife, kid AND Diego. Worse of all, when one gets the feeling, in the move, that there was a slim possibility that finally Alberto might get his act together and make a decision as to his life and/or future--him or her??(his wife, with the only pair of balls in the movie, had kicked him out and of course he went to live with Diego after much groveling from Diego.) and after Alberto starts hysterically sobbing that he just CAN'T live with a sexy, gorgeous, sweet, kind, smart and successful man that so happens to love him madly--in other words, he just could not live as a gay man (PLEASE!) the movie kills him off and it ends with the overused ""wife and the husband's boyfriend become best friends"" movie ending....",2,Disappointed,1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,3025,"['really', 'had', 'looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'Having', 'seen', 'Javier', 'Burdem', 'Night', 'Falls', 'was', 'thrilled', 'was', 'appearing', 'supposedly', 'intense', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'viewing', 'Second', 'Skin', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Javier', 'Burdem', 'wonderful', 'gorgeous', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'merely', 'melodrama', 'best', 'was', 'level', 'very', 'slim', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'Sunday', 'night', 'family', 'presentation', 'acting', 'three', 'actors', 'superb', 'however', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'make', 'believable', 'least', 'interesting', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'buy', 'Javier', 'Diego', 'being', 'so', 'wimpy', 'allowed', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'Alberto', 'use', 'did', 'Give', 'break', 'Diego', 'played', 'Javier', 'gorgeous', 'hunk', 'man', 'successful', 'medical', 'doctor', 'god', 'sake', 'know', 'love', 'can', 'make', 'be', 'complete', 'idiot', 'Javier', 'character', 'was', 'impossible', 'comprehend', 'audience', 'needed', 'be', 'given', 'clue', 'why', 'Diego', 'acted', 'so', 'irrationally', 'having', 'backbone', 'sort', 'when', 'came', 'Alberto', 'was', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'was', 'abused', 'child', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'hint', 'given', 'why', 'played', 'door-mat', 'Alberto', 'allowing', 'treat', 'very', 'badly', 'Alberto', 'weeks', 'time', 'Diego', 'being', 'able', 'contact', 'when', 'finally', 'go', 'away', 'together', 'one', 'Diego', 'Medical', 'Conventions', 'Alberto', 'try', 'prove', 'really', 'really', ""n't"", 'gay', 'flirting', 'Diego', 'good', 'female', 'friend', 'then', 'getting', 'mad', 'spending', 'night', 'away', 'hotel', 'where', 'are', 'staying', 'acting', '[', 'mad', ']', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'Diego', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'matter', 'offer', 'comfort', 'audience', 'need', 'have', 'small', 'clue', 'why', 'Diego', 'would', 'allow', 'mistreatment', 'losing', 'temper', 'beating', 'pulp', 'least', 'calling', 'few', 'bad', 'names.The', 'character', 'Alberto', 'played', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'complete', 'puzzle', 'Due', 'lack', 'depth', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'man', 'simply', 'wanted', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'nice', 'cozy', 'safe', 'family', 'life', 'hot', 'sexy', 'boyfriend', 'side', 'could', 'state', 'was', 'loved', 'wife', 'kid', 'AND', 'Diego', 'Worse', 'when', 'one', 'feeling', 'move', 'was', 'slim', 'possibility', 'finally', 'Alberto', 'might', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'make', 'decision', 'life', 'future', 'wife', 'only', 'pair', 'balls', 'movie', 'had', 'kicked', 'course', 'went', 'live', 'Diego', 'much', 'groveling', 'Diego', 'Alberto', 'hysterically', 'sobbing', 'just', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'live', 'sexy', 'gorgeous', 'sweet', 'kind', 'smart', 'successful', 'man', 'so', 'love', 'madly', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'live', 'gay', 'man', 'PLEASE', 'movie', 'off', 'overused', 'wife', 'husband', 'boyfriend', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'movie', 'ending']",N/A

He has assembled a cast of some of the finest actors on the screen today and manages to present a wholly credible story of a gender crisis love triangle.Javier Bardem is inimitable as a sensitively wrought gay surgeon in love with a bisexual man (again, in a brilliant performance by Jordi Molla) who is married to a wise if fragile woman (sensitively acted by Ariadna Gil).  Bardem's best friend is a fellow surgeon (the wondrous Cecilia Roth) who helps him through the highs and lows of his love affair with a man who is conflicted to the extreme.

Meanwhile, he has a wife at home. Their child finds a receipt, but the wife notices a receipt from a hotel. The wife never finds out who it is or really pinpoints that he is having an affair at all.

735207,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000088UZ4,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","After viewing this the other day I find it intriguing. This film consist of an married couple and a male lover, only this time it's not the wife but the husband who's cheating with another man. Some of the scenes made me cringed a speck. Though, it is a bit TV plot based on a true story, and it has rarely been seen on cinema, doesn't necessarily mean that it cannot be done. In fact, the quality that makes this particular movie a good piece of art is that it portrayed as a good archetype of a modern life situation that happen to occur more often than one could suspect.The husband's unwillingness and incapableness to find his true nature, constantly lying to his wife and his lover, has driven those last characters to despair in understanding and helping the man they love but who they don't know. The wife never suspected that her lack of involvement in their relationship could endanger her marriage at the point of seeing her husband seeking for an affair. As for the gay lover, the fact that his present companion has afraid to be seen in public with him, like two lovers rather than two friends, hurts him badly because he accepts his own nature. The intriguing excuses of Alberto, the husband, makes them reacting towards him trying to solve the puzzle that he consists, when the easy way out of the situation is right near them (like when the wife cannot enjoy being with another man when she has the opportunity or the lover won't accept his female colleague to help getting over him). Three persons portrayed in their interior (the opening credits with the x-rays is one of the most beautiful openings I've seen lately) with their emotions thickening as the film passes.The players of this movie are excellent, particularly Ariadna Gil, the wife. What disappointed me were the last fifteen minutes in which seems that the writer and director of this movie were replaced by others who didn't know what was done before, leaving the ending so pathetic and inconclusive.I had read that this film has caused a lot of controversy in Spain. It is establishing a trend in Spanish films exploiting gay themes by casting some of the country's most popular male stars as lovers to lure viewers, therefore appealing to voyeurism. This ""gayploitation"" has been going on for over a decade in Spanish cinema. In fact, it's hard to name an established Spanish actor who hasn't appeared in at least one gay role. However, in most cases, these roles or their sexuality have been secondary. Whether this film is voyeuristic or not is certainly up to the viewer to decide.

In the end, all that trying might not prove to be enough. But would even finding the ""love of his life"" (Javier Bardem's Diego) prove enough?  He'd thought....hoped....it would. After all, it is this man whom he's told in so many words:  ""I think this time with you has been the best in my life.""Yet, can someone truly successfully live a double life?  Alberto is faced with answering this quandary upon Elena's discovery of his outside-their-marriage activities.  In seeking the answer, will he find his feelings for Elena prove the greater or will he find their life together has been based on only what was expected of him (expectations......expectations, meeting them can tear you apart)?  To compound his conflict, at the near conclusion of everything, when Diego says: ""you have to start over......,"" you can plainly see the realization in Jordi Molla's oh-so-expressive eyes and face (this man is so beautiful), that his quandary has just been pushed beyond the level of human endurance.FINAL RESTATEMENT: In the end, then, we can see we have been given the study of a man raised and pushed into being something he isn't. It's the story of oh, so many out there. Some are able to break the mold, others not---the strength of commitments (to spouse, to children, family) being too great. Or perhaps that's the excuse used for staying within the mold. But in the hearts and minds of those who do stay, the longings---those yearnings for ""the other""---are there.......always there.......and they hurt. Alberto might be able to break from the mold, but to what point?  Only viewing this film, dear reader, will provide you the answer.(A word of warning to those possibly offended by scenes of male love-making.  In the ""Unrated' version, they are intense)PS---Many aspects of this Spanish film pre-sage ones in America's later released ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005).  Was Ennis's conflict any more soul-wrenching than Alberto's?  Yes, Ennis is much the simpler man, but over and above that, when it comes to the love of your life, does it really matter where in this world you find that love (out-of-the-way ranch town or bustling city.......lofty urban areas or soaring mountains)?****",5,A MAN TORN IN TWO...........(or: J&J Burn Up the Screen),1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2729,"['****', 'Torn', 'life', 'society', 'one', 'live', 'life', 'one', 'live', '..', 'How', 'utterly', 'devastating', 'lead', 'character', 'Alberto', 'face', 'realization', 'everything', 'done', 'life', 'carrying', 'family', 'work', 'tradition', 'courting', 'marrying', 'parenting', 'NOT', 'who', 'really', 'third', 'generation', 'grandfather', 'father', 'airport', 'operations', 'worker', 'husband', '/', 'father', 'are', 'roles', 'life', 'have', 'been', ""'expected"", ""'"", 'roles', 'truly', 'tried', 'give', 'best', 'end', 'trying', 'might', 'not', 'prove', 'be', 'enough', 'would', 'even', 'finding', 'love', 'life', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Diego', 'prove', 'enough', ""'d"", 'thought', '.it', 'would', 'man', 'whom', 'told', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'think', 'time', 'been', 'best', 'life', 'Yet', 'can', 'someone', 'truly', 'successfully', 'live', 'double', 'life', 'Alberto', 'faced', 'answering', 'quandary', 'Elena', 'discovery', 'outside-their-marriage', 'activities', 'seeking', 'answer', 'will', 'find', 'feelings', 'Elena', 'prove', 'greater', 'will', 'find', 'life', 'together', 'been', 'based', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'expectations', 'expectations', 'meeting', 'can', 'tear', 'apart', 'compound', 'conflict', 'near', 'conclusion', 'everything', 'when', 'Diego', 'have', 'start', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'realization', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'oh-so-expressive', 'eyes', 'face', 'man', 'so', 'beautiful', 'quandary', 'just', 'been', 'pushed', 'level', 'human', 'endurance.FINAL', 'RESTATEMENT', 'end', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'study', 'man', 'raised', 'pushed', 'being', 'something', ""n't"", 'story', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'are', 'able', 'break', 'mold', 'others', 'not', '-the', 'strength', 'commitments', 'spouse', 'children', 'family', 'being', 'too', 'great', 'perhaps', 'excuse', 'used', 'staying', 'mold', 'hearts', 'minds', 'who', 'do', 'stay', 'longings', '-those', 'yearnings', 'other', '-are', '.and', 'hurt', 'Alberto', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'break', 'mold', 'what', 'point', 'Only', 'viewing', 'film', 'dear', 'reader', 'will', 'provide', 'answer', 'word', 'warning', 'possibly', 'offended', 'scenes', 'male', 'love-making', 'Unrated', 'version', 'are', 'intense', 'PS', '-Many', 'aspects', 'Spanish', 'film', 'pre-sage', 'ones', 'America', 'later', 'released', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '2005', 'Was', 'Ennis', 'conflict', 'more', 'soul-wrenching', 'Alberto', 'Yes', 'Ennis', 'much', 'simpler', 'man', 'when', 'love', 'life', 'really', 'matter', 'where', 'world', 'find', 'love', 'out-of-the-way', 'ranch', 'town', 'bustling', 'city', '.lofty', 'urban', 'areas', 'soaring', 'mountains', '****']",N/A

To be fair, U.S. films would not show the sympathetic scenes of gay male intimacy seen in this Spanish release.

The characters all have such depth that you can live through their emotions through each one of the scenes. The movie is about Alberto (Molla) (No somos nadie), a married man who struggles with his homosexuality. Molla plays perfectly his role as the tortured man unable to deal with his homosexuality. His lies become a torture to him and, although his may want to be with his family, he continues his affair with Diego. His inability to follow the social norm is eating him inside and Alberto, although you may despise him for the cheating and the lying, makes you feel sorry for him at times. Molla truly carries this film.Diego, his lover, does not know that Alberto is married and has a son, and in his desire to be with Alberto puts his career on the line. Bardem is simply phenomenal in this role; he is both genuine and compelling. Gil, who play Elena, is the dutiful wife who tries to come to terms with her husband's infidelity and homosexuality and rebels when she can no longer tolerate what is happening.Gil (Lagrimas Negras: Black Tears) is amazing in her performance as the wife who tries to forgive her husband but is unable to. She lashes out, she rebels, she suffers and she tries to come to terms with the choices she makes.Cecilia Roth (All About My Mother), an amazing actress, is merely fluff in this movie. She is given a secondary role who's only purpose is to relegate to the audience that Alberto is not a trustworthy man and that Diego is putting his career on the line. This is truly a pity because that was a waste of her talent.I gave this film 3 stars because, although the character development is amazing, the plot seems to hurried and forced. The movie fell flat at times and the only thing carrying it forward were the amazing performances.For those of you that want this info: This is not a movie for children, it has several steamy sex scenes (excellently made), both gay and straight.",3,Watch the movie for the AMAZING performances,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2002,"['Adriadna', 'Gil', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'are', 'simply', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'characters', 'have', 'such', 'depth', 'can', 'live', 'emotions', 'one', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Alberto', 'Molla', 'No', 'somos', 'nadie', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'homosexuality', 'Molla', 'perfectly', 'role', 'tortured', 'man', 'unable', 'deal', 'homosexuality', 'become', 'torture', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'family', 'affair', 'Diego', 'inability', 'follow', 'social', 'norm', 'eating', 'inside', 'Alberto', 'may', 'despise', 'cheating', 'lying', 'feel', 'sorry', 'times', 'Molla', 'truly', 'film.Diego', 'lover', 'not', 'know', 'Alberto', 'married', 'son', 'desire', 'be', 'Alberto', 'career', 'line', 'Bardem', 'simply', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'genuine', 'compelling', 'Gil', 'who', 'play', 'Elena', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'homosexuality', 'rebels', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'tolerate', 'what', 'happening.Gil', 'Lagrimas', 'Negras', 'Black', 'Tears', 'amazing', 'performance', 'wife', 'who', 'forgive', 'husband', 'unable', 'out', 'suffers', 'come', 'terms', 'choices', 'makes.Cecilia', 'Roth', 'My', 'Mother', 'amazing', 'actress', 'merely', 'fluff', 'movie', 'given', 'secondary', 'role', 'who', 'only', 'purpose', 'relegate', 'audience', 'Alberto', 'not', 'trustworthy', 'man', 'Diego', 'putting', 'career', 'line', 'truly', 'pity', 'was', 'waste', 'talent.I', 'gave', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'because', 'character', 'development', 'amazing', 'plot', 'hurried', 'forced', 'movie', 'fell', 'flat', 'times', 'only', 'thing', 'carrying', 'were', 'amazing', 'performances.For', 'want', 'info', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'several', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'excellently', 'made', 'gay', 'straight']",N/A

It tugs at your emotions throughout and you cant help but feel sorry for each of the three main characters, even the son, who has only a minor part. Though the movie's colouring is bright and locations and people are all beautiful, this cannot distract from the fact that no good can surely come from this relationship, a feeling of pending doom and underlying hysteria is always there.
