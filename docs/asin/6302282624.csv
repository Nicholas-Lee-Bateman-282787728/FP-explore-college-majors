Harmer,"[2, 2]","This movie's dialogue is the best, which is why I designated it &quot;Most Quotable Movie Ever.&quot;  None of the characters comes off as flat and wooden; they put their hearts into everything they say.  Sue Ellen and Kenny's lines really sound like ones teenagers would utter.  Also, Rose, Sue Ellen's boss, is a great actress.  She looks and acts exactly like a benevolent supervisor.  She really holds it together well.I deducted one star b/c when Sue Ellen got her job, the movie's focus seemed to veer off the more pressing issue: that the babysitter was dead and these kids were on their own.  The focus seemed to be on Sue Ellen as an ersatz career woman, and at times I forgot the other issue.  However, the two matters are tied together nicely at the end when the mother unexpectedly arrives home.The fashions and time period in which the movie was set were a nostalgic and amusing trip back through time for me.  Though it was 1991, and 80's fashion was supposedly dead, you can see it flaunted in Sue Ellen and her friends just as if the decade had never turned over.  Also, the head-banging proclivities of Kenny and his friends were poignant because 1991 was the year of hair music's last gasp: Both music and fashion were on the verge of tremedous and tumultuous change when this movie debuted, and Sue Ellen and Kenny were paying homage, probably unwittingly, to the old regime.  I wondered, as I observed them, if Kenny would have become a Nirvana fan and if Sue Ellen would have exchanged her big earrings, stretch pants, and frosty lipstick for flannel.",4,Most quotable movie ever!,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,1572,"['movie', 'dialogue', 'best', 'why', 'designated', 'quot', 'Most', 'Quotable', 'Movie', 'Ever.', 'quot', 'None', 'characters', 'off', 'flat', 'wooden', 'put', 'hearts', 'everything', 'say', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Kenny', 'lines', 'really', 'sound', 'ones', 'teenagers', 'would', 'utter', 'Also', 'Rose', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'boss', 'great', 'actress', 'exactly', 'benevolent', 'supervisor', 'really', 'together', 'well.I', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'b/c', 'when', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'got', 'job', 'movie', 'focus', 'seemed', 'veer', 'off', 'more', 'pressing', 'issue', 'babysitter', 'was', 'dead', 'kids', 'were', 'own', 'focus', 'seemed', 'be', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'ersatz', 'career', 'woman', 'times', 'forgot', 'other', 'issue', 'However', 'two', 'matters', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'nicely', 'end', 'when', 'mother', 'unexpectedly', 'home.The', 'fashions', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'were', 'nostalgic', 'amusing', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'was', '1991', '80', 'fashion', 'was', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'can', 'see', 'flaunted', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'friends', 'just', 'decade', 'had', 'never', 'turned', 'over', 'Also', 'head-banging', 'proclivities', 'Kenny', 'friends', 'were', 'poignant', '1991', 'was', 'year', 'hair', 'music', 'last', 'gasp', 'music', 'fashion', 'were', 'verge', 'tremedous', 'tumultuous', 'change', 'when', 'movie', 'debuted', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Kenny', 'were', 'paying', 'homage', 'probably', 'unwittingly', 'old', 'regime', 'wondered', 'observed', 'Kenny', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'Nirvana', 'fan', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'would', 'have', 'exchanged', 'big', 'earrings', 'stretch', 'pants', 'frosty', 'lipstick', 'flannel']",N/A

305688,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6302282624,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 3]","This movie is often seen as a teen movie when in fact it's not only highly intelligent but also nicely satirical and comic.  The plot has Mom going away for two months and leaving her five children, headed by Sue 'Swell 'Ellen (Applegate), in the charge of a babysitter.  However, when the babysitter dies they accidently bury all their housekeeping money with her, so Swell goes off to get a high-paid job in the fashion industry.As the lead, Applegate has a winning mixture of sweetness and assertiveness.  She manages to perfectly balance the humour alongside her role as a stressed teenager who realises that being an adult isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Joanna Cassidy as her boss is an absolute riot, with some really classic lines, and the rest of the kids are good too.  Anyone who is a fan of 'The X-Files' will notice David Duchovany as an office clerk, which he plays with a wonderfully smarmy attitude.The movie does well to subvert the teen genre with a 17 year-old that tries to pass herself off as being 27, rather than the other way round.  What first looks like a straighforward comedy manages to be a lot more.  The fish-out-of-water scenario at work rapidly transforms into a realisation of how restricting an adult life can be.  This is best shown in a great little marital spoof between Swell and her older brother Kenny, as he shouts at her for being home late and she screams back that she's the one that provides the money.  Plus, the cute little romance between Swell and a local kid who sells burgers is shown as a little window of fun for Swell rather than an obligatory sideline.  Swell's final speech that she's not ready to be an adult will strike a chord with several, and it's yet more credit to Applegate that she pulls off the more emotional side of her character so well.There's plenty to recommend here, especially if you like knowing little sweeps at high school movies, fashion sense of the day and hierarchy within the workplace.",4,Neat little dark comedy,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,1971,"['movie', 'often', 'seen', 'teen', 'movie', 'when', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'also', 'nicely', 'satirical', 'comic', 'plot', 'Mom', 'going', 'away', 'two', 'months', 'leaving', 'five', 'children', 'headed', 'Sue', ""'Swell"", ""'Ellen"", 'Applegate', 'charge', 'babysitter', 'However', 'when', 'babysitter', 'accidently', 'bury', 'housekeeping', 'money', 'so', 'Swell', 'off', 'get', 'high-paid', 'job', 'fashion', 'lead', 'Applegate', 'winning', 'mixture', 'sweetness', 'assertiveness', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'humour', 'role', 'stressed', 'teenager', 'who', 'being', 'adult', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'boss', 'absolute', 'riot', 'really', 'classic', 'lines', 'rest', 'kids', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', ""'The"", 'X-Files', 'will', 'notice', 'David', 'Duchovany', 'office', 'clerk', 'wonderfully', 'smarmy', 'attitude.The', 'movie', 'well', 'subvert', 'teen', 'genre', '17', 'year-old', 'pass', 'off', 'being', '27', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'round', 'What', 'first', 'straighforward', 'comedy', 'manages', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'fish-out-of-water', 'scenario', 'work', 'rapidly', 'realisation', 'how', 'restricting', 'adult', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'shown', 'great', 'little', 'marital', 'spoof', 'Swell', 'older', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'being', 'home', 'late', 'screams', 'back', 'one', 'money', 'cute', 'little', 'romance', 'Swell', 'local', 'kid', 'who', 'burgers', 'shown', 'little', 'window', 'fun', 'Swell', 'rather', 'obligatory', 'sideline', 'Swell', 'final', 'speech', 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'adult', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'several', 'yet', 'more', 'credit', 'Applegate', 'more', 'emotional', 'side', 'character', 'well.There', 'plenty', 'recommend', 'here', 'especially', 'like', 'knowing', 'little', 'sweeps', 'high', 'school', 'movies', 'fashion', 'sense', 'day', 'hierarchy', 'workplace']",N/A

305690,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,6302282624,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 8]","I am not usually a fan of Ms. Applegate's work, and was leery when this movie came out, but I actually wound up liking it a lot.When the babysitter dies, a young (formerly spoiled) teen girl grows up and climbs her way up the career ladder. Armed with an imaginary resume (and great clothes), she rescues an ailing apparel company and even manages to keep her siblings from killing each other. But be warned, this is not oscar-grade material.We never do see Sue Ellen going down to personnel to fill out forms--even after Rose Lindsey personally does hire her on?? She does not present the company with any personal identification of any kind?? I have no idea how on earth this teen actually even got paid--unless this was when paychecks could still legally be mailed home/hand delivered to a person's office desk.John Getz adds a litle spice as ""Gus"" the office sleaze--who has no idea that he's actually skirt-chasiing a 17 year old. Even though she did not initially know how to operate a fax, Sue Ellen did recognize the looser who approached her.Despite plot holes and a too rapid chain of events (this film will never join any good ""classic videos"" collection) that make everything too convent, this is a good movie for generation X. Younger audiences especially accustomed to extensive background checks (ala social meda...etc) are going to have a very hard time swallowing the pre-internet resume, where people actually just turned in a hard copy resume--and their background was not actually given a careful lookover.It still excellently captures the tense emotions many young people feel in their first ""real world"" job while showing that the people well entrenched in this world are not exactly as smart as they would like to appear. And other people such as stoner Kenny are VERY smart if only given the right opportunity to realize their hidden talents.  This remains a viable and timeless message which does translate well into subsequent generations.",3,Unexpectedly good.,981072000,"02 2, 2001",2001,1965,"['am', 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Applegate', 'work', 'was', 'leery', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'actually', 'wound', 'up', 'liking', 'babysitter', 'young', 'formerly', 'spoiled', 'teen', 'girl', 'up', 'climbs', 'way', 'career', 'ladder', 'Armed', 'imaginary', 'resume', 'great', 'clothes', 'ailing', 'apparel', 'company', 'even', 'manages', 'keep', 'siblings', 'killing', 'other', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'oscar-grade', 'material.We', 'never', 'do', 'see', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'going', 'down', 'personnel', 'fill', 'out', 'forms', 'even', 'Rose', 'Lindsey', 'personally', 'hire', 'not', 'present', 'company', 'personal', 'identification', 'kind', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'earth', 'teen', 'actually', 'even', 'got', 'paid', 'was', 'when', 'paychecks', 'could', 'still', 'legally', 'be', 'mailed', 'home/hand', 'delivered', 'person', 'office', 'desk.John', 'Getz', 'litle', 'spice', 'Gus', 'office', 'sleaze', 'who', 'idea', 'actually', 'skirt-chasiing', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'initially', 'know', 'how', 'operate', 'fax', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'did', 'recognize', 'looser', 'who', 'approached', 'her.Despite', 'plot', 'holes', 'too', 'rapid', 'chain', 'events', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'join', 'good', 'classic', 'videos', 'collection', 'make', 'everything', 'too', 'convent', 'good', 'movie', 'generation', 'X', 'Younger', 'audiences', 'especially', 'accustomed', 'extensive', 'background', 'checks', 'ala', 'social', 'meda', 'etc', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'pre-internet', 'resume', 'where', 'people', 'actually', 'just', 'turned', 'hard', 'copy', 'resume', 'background', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'given', 'careful', 'lookover.It', 'still', 'excellently', 'tense', 'emotions', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'feel', 'first', 'real', 'world', 'job', 'showing', 'people', 'well', 'entrenched', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'as', 'smart', 'would', 'like', 'appear', 'other', 'people', 'such', 'stoner', 'Kenny', 'are', 'VERY', 'smart', 'only', 'given', 'right', 'opportunity', 'realize', 'hidden', 'talents', 'viable', 'timeless', 'message', 'translate', 'well', 'subsequent', 'generations']",N/A
