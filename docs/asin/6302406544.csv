A package drops into a river where an air-boat retrieves it. A helicopter flies over this boat and retrieves the package, then drops it on land. A van drives by to pick it up, only to throw it off a bridge where it is picked up by waiting men. Military soldiers arrest Barry Seal at a foreign airport and put him in jail. Seal meets another pilot from Louisiana and gets information from him. Back in Baton Rouge he talks to his wife Debbie. Next he is in Miami talking about a flying job for $3,000 a trip (this is 1977). Seal's cover job is buying and selling airplanes in foreign countries. The Louisiana State Police follow him. In 1983 he lands in Fort Lauderdale Miami and is arrested by the DEA. Somebody squealed, he is facing 60 years in prison. Can he get help? Only if he turns informant.Seal goes to Washington for help at the ""Drug Task Force"" to make a deal. He goes to Miami to meet Donaldson. There is conflict with the DEA agents over Seal's knowledge. He wants a lot and will give a lot. At a lounge Seal meets Lido and gets a job for tonight. He lands near Medellin Columbia. The numbers on his airplane are changed. The pilot and co-pilot meet a very rich man and his partners. This rich man blames the CIA for a political assassination. Their drug operation must be moved to Nicaragua, they work with the Sandinistas. They will need a big airplane to transport fifteen tons of drugs. Seal talks to Donaldson from a public telephone. Back in the USA seal is in court to be sentenced to ten years. Where is the DEA? Seal thought about his past actions and repents. The DEA agents just do their job. Seal flies to Columbia to pick up a heavy load. The plane crashes on take-off! It is quickly unloaded before it burns and explodes.There is a replacement plane. They land in Nicaragua. The CIA wants pictures of Nicaraguan officials with the drug load. They promise to intercede with Seal's judge. Bundles are loaded into Seal's big airplane. The pictures are sent to Washington DC. Ollie North wants these pictures released to the public. A US General talks about drugs from Nicaragua! Seal wants to make another run to get information. [Believable?] No co-pilot this trip. The DEA agents await his return. ""All is well"" says the radio. Seal returns home. His wife is worried, Seal tells her the truth about his job, but she doesn't believe him! Newspapers print the story about a drug informant. Was Seal double-crossed? The drug dealers put out a reward on Seal, dead or alive. Seal continues to work undercover in Las Vegas. A foreign premier was convicted. The judge reduces Seal's sentence to time served due to his work as an informant.But in Louisiana the judge sentences Seal to stay at a public place. Another double-cross to allow his assassination? The IRS shows up at his home to collect $29 million in back taxes! The DEA was told to stay away from court. ""Open season""? Dave brings more bad news about the death of his co-pilot. ""He flew into a mountain."" [Sabotage?] A small boat crosses a river at night. Later his man gets into a white car. He uses a machine gun on Seal. [Termination with extreme prejudice?] ""Nobody from the DEA is allowed at the funeral."" [To avoid identification of undercover agents.] President Reagan denounces the Nicaraguan regime for drug smuggling! [But we know what really happened. Attorney-General Meese was a good friend of Reagan since he was Governor. After unlaundered drug money was found in Meese's personal checking account he had to resign. This was blamed on Barry Seal.] Read ""Compromised"" by Terry K.

I took it out the other day and put it in and watched it again. I must say that it seems dated now. I would like to see them remake Barry Seals story now. Hopper is ok but he pretty much is 'Dennis Hopper' with a fake accent. The movie is still good and informative but it just seems like and early 80's movie.

310557,A1O60Q7LBN4MQ,6302406544,Wendy Schroeder,"[5, 5]","It starred the great actor Dennis Hopper as Berry Seal, a DEA informant. He was hoping to get no time in jail if he helped the government in their pathetic ""war on drugs"" (liberals and conservatives can agree it's been a complete failure). Hopper's portrayal of Seal gives me the impression that the informant was a brash adventurer who smuggled drugs just as much for the thrill as for the money. When caught, he didn't turn on his partners in crime but did help get evidence about the drug smugglers in South America. He did risk his life and he should have got what the government promised. What he got was doubled-crossed.Seal was far from an upstanding citizen but his treatment by our government is reprehensible.",4,"If you like a good real life story, you will enjoy this film",1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,719,"['starred', 'great', 'actor', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Berry', 'Seal', 'DEA', 'informant', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'time', 'jail', 'helped', 'government', 'pathetic', 'war', 'drugs', 'liberals', 'conservatives', 'can', 'agree', 'been', 'complete', 'failure', 'Hopper', 'portrayal', 'Seal', 'impression', 'informant', 'was', 'brash', 'adventurer', 'who', 'smuggled', 'drugs', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'thrill', 'money', 'When', 'caught', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'partners', 'crime', 'did', 'help', 'get', 'evidence', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'South', 'America', 'did', 'risk', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'what', 'government', 'promised', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'doubled-crossed.Seal', 'was', 'far', 'upstanding', 'citizen', 'treatment', 'government', 'reprehensible']",Double Crossed VHS
