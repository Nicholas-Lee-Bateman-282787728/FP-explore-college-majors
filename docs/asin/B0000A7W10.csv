This DVD is very political and reflects Dennis's transition to the right side of the political spectrum. I do not make a practice of looking out for leftists regarding any matter, but, the fact is, should one despise George W. Bush and the Republican Party they will not like this performance. Here in Chicago, Dennis is brilliant, sharp, irreverent, and everything one wants a comedian to be, but--if ""NeoCon"" is your favorite curse--you will give The Raw Feed a low rating.Furthermore, Black on White from the late eighties was one of the most inspiring, hilarious hours of comedy in history, but we should not compare late Dennis to early Dennis.

Rubendall,"[14, 38]","There was a time, around 1993 or so, when Dennis Miller went on one of his toughest-ever stand-up rants against Dan Quayle and his utter lack of fitness to be Vice President of the United States.  It was a crude, scathing, dead on critique of the ignorant, arrogant little rich boy who dodged Vietnam through his rich daddy's connections and somehow still became a political player.Flash forward ten years.  Quayle's dumber doppleganger is now President and lies the country into an unwinnable war and Miller inexplicably can't suck up to him enough.  All I can say is, what the heck happened?  Miller was never a liberal (he voted for Perot in 1992), and once upon a time he could be counted on to rip into hypocracy of any political stripe with his sharp rhetorical jabs.Sadly, however, he has sold out to the establishment just when we needed him the most.",1,VERY Disappointing,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,859,"['was', 'time', '1993', 'so', 'when', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'went', 'one', 'toughest-ever', 'stand-up', 'rants', 'Dan', 'Quayle', 'utter', 'lack', 'fitness', 'be', 'Vice', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'crude', 'scathing', 'dead', 'critique', 'ignorant', 'arrogant', 'little', 'rich', 'boy', 'who', 'dodged', 'Vietnam', 'rich', 'daddy', 'connections', 'somehow', 'still', 'became', 'political', 'player.Flash', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'Quayle', 'dumber', 'doppleganger', 'now', 'President', 'country', 'unwinnable', 'war', 'Miller', 'inexplicably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'suck', 'up', 'enough', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'heck', 'happened', 'Miller', 'was', 'never', 'liberal', 'voted', 'Perot', '1992', 'once', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'counted', 'rip', 'hypocracy', 'political', 'stripe', 'sharp', 'rhetorical', 'jabs.Sadly', 'however', 'sold', 'out', 'establishment', 'just', 'when', 'needed', 'most']",Dennis Miller - The Raw Feed

Dennis Miller, in an astonishingly desperate attempt to revive a somewhat flagging career, now fancies himself as a comic in the vein of the brilliant Lenny Bruce or Mort Sahl. Though, and equally as sadly, a stand-up comedian whose asperations seem to far outdistance his somewhat limited talents. And after being subjected to "" Raw Feed "" I've come to the conclusion that this is a performer whose fifteen minutes of fame have decidedly come to an end.Swaggering out on stage to, not one mind you, but 'TWO'  ovations ( before Mr. Miller had even utterted a single syllable! ) tells me that this Chicago audience was more then just simply enamored with this entertainers less then remarkable talents. And with laughter that seemed almost Pavlovian in nature one would think that the audience had been 'packed' with friends or relatives of Dennis Miller's thereby awarding him with gracious applause and laughter that was bestowed upon this entertainer. All by virtue of simply showing up for work! Well, I will say that whomever 'primped' this audience beforehand certainly deserved their very own HBO special.Regarding Mr. Miller's monologues it becomes painfully obvious that as a stand-up comic he commits the ultimate 'sin' when performing his craft. Simply put... Dennis Miller is painfully "" not very funny! "" Its one thing to be pretentious and aspire to 'say something' in your routine but its simply something far worse when you sacrifice any real humour in hopes of being relevant and ascerbic. Dennis comes across, for the most part, as an odd mixture of Bill O'Reilly's pomposity and CNN's in-house crumudgeon Jack Cafferty! Taking his cue from the far-Right Mr. Miller's not-so-unique observations concerning the Middle East, the French ( who Dennis seems to truly loathe! ), the upcoming war with Iraq, Saddam Hussein and finally the old stand-by religion grow increasingly tiresome and ultimately I found myself weary of a routine that centered around this comedians almost pathological need to prove himself as an entertainer who was intellectual enough to speak of current events. Although the more he spoke of todays issues, sadly, the more he proved himself who seemed clueless as to showing any intellectual acumen, much less understanding of todays complex problems.  Of course through out his monologue Dennis Miller constantly tries to drop references to popular culture icons. All done in a cheap attempt to show how incredibly savvy and 'hip' he misguidedly believes he is. Add to this unfortunate mixture a seemingly endless amount of cockiness and sarcasm that permeates his 'routine' and it makes for one truly bizarre evening.Ultimately, I found many of Mr. Miller's remarks/observations to be remarkably harsh and unfeeling... with little true humour to be found. But if your idea of real knee-slapping humour is your local morning radio 'shock-jock' then Dennis Miller is certainly your man! Its truly sad to see a performer whose resume includes working on "" SNL "" and one who had his very own HBO program resort to this contrived and truly desperate self-styled aggrandizement. Very uncomfortable indeed! Well, in an obvious attempt to find his audience I suggest that Mr. Miller look no further then his local chapter of the RNC! No doubt many of those on the far-Right will be amused by this performers endless 'witticisms' and less then sterling thoughts on todays current events.

761833,A18OBUSMXVE8R0,B0000A7W10,J. Guild,"[3, 5]","What a delightful hour with someone who can be argued as one of the best Humorists/Satirists around today.This DVD was recorded at Miller's performance in Chicago in 2003,and is a joy to listen to today,and loses none of its punch with the passage of the past 5 years. If there ever is a good test of great humor,it has to be time. One of America's greatest humorists has to be Mark Twain and that holds true for him;and I feel Miller's humor is similar, and will likewise be long lasting. As someone who loves history and politics:I would love to see Miller do a show on past politicians such as Harding,Kennedy,Nixon,Carter,Johnson,Truman Lincoln,Grant,Hitler Mao,Stalin,Churchill, and any number of others.To really enjoy political humor one must put their political party prejudices aside to see the real humor--and Miller can do that.I don't think it makes any difference which party wins the upcoming election or any other;Miller's style and insight will find plenty of humor to feed on and entertain us.I really wait for and enjoy Miller these days on Fox News. O'Reilly,who is never lost for words,is frequently left speechless,when Miller comes up with his take on things.If you listen to Miller,and just wish you could hear more from him,this DVD will be right down your alley. Though my many years in the Army,Engineering School,and ""misspent youth"" in Pool Halls have hardened my ears to rough language;I would prefer that Miller avoided it.Many stand-up comics today feel they have to sprinkle it through their humor,but I feel it shows a lack of ability;and Miller does,not need it as a crutch. The great comics in the past avoided it,and their humor was better for it.Miller is definately a thinking man's comic and his mind takes a subject and works at it as would an artist, and is a master at crafting humor out of it. When you watch him,and you must watch his eyes and expressions;you just know he is loading up a thought that when he comes out with it,is really going to be good,original,funny and above all else --to the point.If you enjoy Miller,you'll love this DVD.",5,"""This is not an easy time for humorists because the government is far funnier than we are.""

He reminded me of Michael Moore. As a liberal, I find Michael Moore a complete embarassment: vulgar, polemical, and utterly incapable of properly understanding the opposing team. This is Dennis Miller. In what must be an homage to the spaghetti western, he portrays conservatives as the champions of justice and the fonts of widsom (white hats), and liberals as drooling, weak-kneed morons (black hats). Not particularly funny, nor even all that original. It's not that I'm offended, it's just that if someone is so intelligent, he would realize that there is plenty to lampoon on both sides of the political aisle.Yet even when he's not discussing politics, Miller just isn't particularly entertaining. His jokes are almost too byzantine. He does, on occasion, raise some interesting points, but his delivery is so long-winded that it kills the laugh. Exempli Gratia: Dennis Miller, who is so incogitably loquacious and prolix that his droleries become not risible but rather irksomely drudging, is unmitigatingly a pontificating and supercilious jerk. So Dennis went to college; that doesn't make him de facto funny.Another weakness: much of his material is as hackneyed as the slips-on-banana or pie-in-the-face gags. Maybe I'm wrong, but jokes about the French and Catholics just aren't funny anymore--even with Miller's verbal window dressing.To be fair, there are a few--a FEW--moments of genuine humor, and, in some inexplicable way I'm glad he's out there.

He is also unafraid to get into uncomfortable areas where most comedians fear to tread due to guaranteed politically-correct criticism. I find it interesting that the people who give this a one star review claim it's because Miller is a shill for the far right. Actually, he's not. He is essentially a libertarian (look at what he says about gay rights for a clear illustration of this) who believes in the defense of the United States, and doesn't mind stepping on toes in the process of defending his beliefs. I am sure the people who gave this one star think that Al Franken (Miller's personal friend, but politically his nemesis) is an utterly brilliant, totally unbiased comedian of great depth and insight. Please. I happen to think that Franken is also a very funny guy, and has as much right to espouse his own beliefs as Dennis Miller. The point is this: Dennis Miller has the right to his own viewpoints, too.If you are totally close-minded to all but the far left wing, this DVD will undoubtedly offend you. If, on the other hand, you think it is refreshing to see a comedian take a logical (if politically incorrect) stand in the post-9/11 world (with bonus points for a pointedly hilarious anti-French monologue), this is the best DVD money can buy.
