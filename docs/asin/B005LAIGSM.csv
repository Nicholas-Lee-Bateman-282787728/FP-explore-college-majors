1465593,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIGSM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'm torn here.  The movie itself is a boatload of clich&eacute;s and corny moments that add up to one gigantic `gush' of romantic goo, but there is something genuine and likable about the film regardless of its apparent obviousness.  From the very first frame, McAdams and Tatum go WAY out of their way to create this depiction of puppy love at its most puppy like.  They make goo-goo eyes at one another and cuddle and act all cute and love-like and it made me want to roll my eyes because, well, it's just not realistic.  You let it go for a scene or two and then Tatum starts writing messages with food and you realize that this film is just NOT going to give it a rest.And then, it kind of does.The film is `inspired' by a true story, and I'd love to know how much of it is true since it really does turn into `The Notebook' after a while and I'm wondering how many liberties were taken in order to recreate McAdams most famed role.Leo and Paige are deep in love, married and carefree, when they are in a car accident and Paige suffers from brain trauma and wakes up not remembering her life past Law School.  Sadly, she didn't meet Leo until long after Law School, and so she's back in college (in her head), in love with another man and deeply attached to her parents, whom she actually hasn't spoken to in five years but cannot remember why she ever stopped.  Her parents swoop in and try to convince her to leave her husband and come live with them.  Leo is adamant that she resume her life with him, but her life is such a contrast to everything that she remembers that it makes things extremely difficult for the both of them, and her parent's looming influence is weighing heavily on Paige's eventual decisions.So, like I said, this opens with a rushing gush of laughably corny romantic notions, but once Paige leaves the hospital there is a break from the overly pushy lovey-dovey stuff and we get into the heart of this story; the real love.  We see Leo fighting to remind his wife of why she loved him in the first place and we see him struggle to break free of the opinions of many around him who seem to feel that Paige will never remember him.  Tatum is a force here, and really understands the depths of `love' his character is feeling, not to mention the frustrations and despair he feels.  The visual ideas that cover some of the scenes are a bit much (director Sucsy's decisions can make the film overly sappy in many moments) but Tatum sells everything with a realism that betrays the film's overall flow.  McAdams is less effective, and she stumbles in places, but she turns in a nice performance.I have issue with some of the plot points.  Paige's parents and their depiction is rather evil and I just can't fathom a family actually treating their daughter's marriage and the son-in-law they don't even know with such contempt.  They are childish and selfish and heartless and when you eventually find out why Paige stopped talking to them it winds up being a far less offence than the one they are currently guilty of.  Couple that with the overt corniness of the film's core romantic moments and you have a film that leaves me seriously divided.I'm like right down the middle, because this film does have merit even if it doesn't really deserve it.",3,This puppy is a tad too cute for its own good...,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,3274,"[""'m"", 'torn', 'here', 'movie', 'boatload', 'clich', 'eacute', 'corny', 'moments', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'gigantic', 'gush', 'romantic', 'goo', 'something', 'genuine', 'likable', 'film', 'regardless', 'apparent', 'obviousness', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'McAdams', 'Tatum', 'go', 'WAY', 'way', 'create', 'depiction', 'puppy', 'love', 'most', 'puppy', 'make', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'one', 'cuddle', 'act', 'cute', 'love-like', 'made', 'want', 'roll', 'eyes', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'realistic', 'let', 'go', 'scene', 'two', 'then', 'Tatum', 'writing', 'messages', 'food', 'realize', 'film', 'just', 'NOT', 'going', 'give', 'rest.And', 'then', 'kind', 'does.The', 'film', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'really', 'turn', 'Notebook', 'while', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'how', 'many', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'order', 'recreate', 'McAdams', 'most', 'famed', 'role.Leo', 'Paige', 'are', 'deep', 'love', 'married', 'carefree', 'when', 'are', 'car', 'accident', 'Paige', 'suffers', 'brain', 'trauma', 'wakes', 'up', 'not', 'remembering', 'life', 'Law', 'School', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'Leo', 'long', 'Law', 'School', 'so', 'back', 'college', 'head', 'love', 'man', 'deeply', 'attached', 'parents', 'whom', 'actually', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'five', 'years', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'why', 'ever', 'stopped', 'parents', 'swoop', 'try', 'convince', 'leave', 'husband', 'come', 'live', 'Leo', 'adamant', 'resume', 'life', 'life', 'such', 'contrast', 'everything', 'things', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'parent', 'looming', 'influence', 'weighing', 'heavily', 'Paige', 'eventual', 'decisions.So', 'said', 'rushing', 'gush', 'laughably', 'corny', 'romantic', 'notions', 'once', 'Paige', 'hospital', 'break', 'overly', 'pushy', 'lovey-dovey', 'stuff', 'get', 'heart', 'story', 'real', 'love', 'see', 'Leo', 'fighting', 'remind', 'wife', 'why', 'loved', 'first', 'place', 'see', 'struggle', 'break', 'free', 'opinions', 'many', 'who', 'seem', 'feel', 'Paige', 'will', 'never', 'remember', 'Tatum', 'force', 'here', 'really', 'depths', 'love', 'character', 'feeling', 'not', 'mention', 'frustrations', 'despair', 'visual', 'ideas', 'cover', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'director', 'Sucsy', 'decisions', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'overly', 'sappy', 'many', 'moments', 'Tatum', 'everything', 'realism', 'film', 'overall', 'flow', 'McAdams', 'less', 'effective', 'places', 'nice', 'performance.I', 'have', 'issue', 'plot', 'points', 'Paige', 'parents', 'depiction', 'rather', 'evil', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'family', 'actually', 'treating', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'son-in-law', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'such', 'contempt', 'are', 'childish', 'selfish', 'heartless', 'when', 'eventually', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Paige', 'stopped', 'talking', 'up', 'being', 'far', 'less', 'offence', 'one', 'are', 'currently', 'guilty', 'Couple', 'overt', 'corniness', 'film', 'core', 'romantic', 'moments', 'have', 'film', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'right', 'middle', 'film', 'have', 'merit', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve']",The Vow

1465600,A1N3F1KNLXYQZA,B005LAIGSM,Birder Girl,"[0, 1]","In The Notebook, an old couple are struggling with her dementia which has erased her memory of their passionate love story. Her devoted husband attempts to rekindle the spark with a diary she wrote describing their young love.  In flashbacks, we see Rachel McAdams playing the older woman as a young, fiery girl who is an artist, and  defies her rich, brittle mother's desires for her to attend college and marry into wealth and prestige.  Instead, she gives herself to a local poor boy, Ryan Gosling,  until they are separated by distance and parental conniving. She forgets her heart's wishes and  decides her parents' plans for her are best after all, including an engagement to a rich suitor and abandoning her art . Her lover, Ryan, meanwhile, never forgets , and plots and plans how he will be able to re-ignite their love one day by renovating a derelict house into a fabulous showplace as a monument to the lovemaking they performed there.  Gosling's smoldering passion is palpable and when you compare him to Channing Tatum's similar role in The Vow, Channing comes off looking like an amateur.  He is all hunk and no acting ability.  In The Vow, Rachel McAdams recycles her role from The Notebook, as a defiant daughter with lying, brittle parents who reclaim her from her husband after a brain injury erases her memory of their love, her art, and her parents conniving. Blah, blah, blah.In The Vow, however, she loses her memory while still young and tries to remember how she got married to Channing by reading her wedding vows, written on a napkin.  An old boyfriend actually looks better to her. Also, she is not quite sure what to do with that discarded pile of clay she was once molding into something meaningful when she gave up law school to to find herself as an artist.The Vow is like that discarded clay.  Everyone forgot what to do with it. The Vow's premise had promise but the execution is so flat.  Bad dialogue.  Wooden acting by Channing Tatum, bare bum and all.  Rachel McAdams who was luminous in The Notebook, faked every emotion in The Vow and just came off shrill.

1465612,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIGSM,Chris Kennison,"[1, 3]","Surprisingly enough, there is much to be said about ""The Vow"", the latest movie from writer Abby Kohn (Valentines Day & Never Been Kissed) and it isn't bad. Is the screenplay outstanding? No. It isn't. In fact, it's pretty typical romantic movie fair. Despite the fact that the movie starts and ends with a note that says it is based on actual events and shows a picture of the couple that inspired the movie, the movie could have very easily fallen into soap opera lala-land. It doesn't though, for many reasons.First off, a quick explanation of the film and why it could have been, but wasn't, silly. The movie starts off with Leo, played by Channing Tatum (Dear John, Step Up) and Paige, played by Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Morning Glory), leaving a movie theatre, smiling and enjoying a beautiful snowy night and they are obviously very much in love. Little do they know, they are about to walk into a situation that will change their lives forever. Moments later, they are both wheeled into an emergency room and Leo's injuries are far less severe than Paige's. When Paige recovers or awakes, days later, she has no memory of Leo or the fact that they are married and truly in love. This is where it could have been very soap opera, but instead, the movie is very real. We experience the dilemmas that both characters are facing and the director and writer handle it capably.What truly makes ""The Vow"" a movie that will stand the test of time though, is the chemistry between McAdams and Tatum. The two of them are fantastic at portraying the unique bond that they have. Their relationship is truly unique and as the movie flashes back to their life and shows how they met, how they courted, how they got married and you know that they belong together. This isn't scripting. This is acting, because as the coin flips, both actors take that very same love they feel for each other and become strangers with different personalities.I'm not sure that the movie could have been written any differently, but the story is a little bit clich&eacute;' and done before, but hasn't it all by now. What truly makes ""The Vow"" a standout film is the performances by Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. They prove that they are both stars to be recognized with in Hollywood and that they both know how to take an audience and shape them like putty in their hands. I think McAdams was always good at that and Tatum is getting better.",4,GREAT CHEMISTRY but who wouldn't with Rachel McAdams,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2426,"['Surprisingly', 'enough', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'Vow', 'latest', 'movie', 'writer', 'Abby', 'Kohn', 'Valentines', 'Day', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', ""n't"", 'bad', 'screenplay', 'outstanding', 'No', ""n't"", 'fact', 'pretty', 'typical', 'romantic', 'movie', 'fair', 'fact', 'movie', 'note', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'picture', 'couple', 'inspired', 'movie', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'fallen', 'soap', 'lala-land', ""n't"", 'though', 'many', 'reasons.First', 'off', 'quick', 'explanation', 'film', 'why', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', ""n't"", 'silly', 'movie', 'Leo', 'played', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Dear', 'John', 'Step', 'Up', 'Paige', 'played', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Notebook', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'leaving', 'movie', 'theatre', 'smiling', 'enjoying', 'beautiful', 'snowy', 'night', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'walk', 'situation', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'Moments', 'later', 'are', 'wheeled', 'emergency', 'room', 'Leo', 'injuries', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'severe', 'Paige', 'When', 'Paige', 'recovers', 'awakes', 'days', 'later', 'memory', 'Leo', 'fact', 'are', 'married', 'truly', 'love', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'soap', 'opera', 'instead', 'movie', 'very', 'real', 'experience', 'dilemmas', 'characters', 'are', 'facing', 'director', 'writer', 'handle', 'truly', 'Vow', 'movie', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'chemistry', 'McAdams', 'Tatum', 'two', 'are', 'fantastic', 'portraying', 'unique', 'bond', 'have', 'relationship', 'truly', 'unique', 'movie', 'back', 'life', 'how', 'met', 'how', 'courted', 'how', 'got', 'married', 'know', 'belong', 'together', ""n't"", 'scripting', 'acting', 'coin', 'flips', 'actors', 'take', 'very', 'same', 'feel', 'other', 'become', 'strangers', 'different', 'personalities.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'differently', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'done', 'before', ""n't"", 'now', 'What', 'truly', 'Vow', 'standout', 'film', 'performances', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'prove', 'are', 'stars', 'be', 'recognized', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'how', 'take', 'audience', 'shape', 'putty', 'hands', 'think', 'McAdams', 'was', 'always', 'good', 'Tatum', 'getting', 'better']",The Vow

1465617,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIGSM,C. Sawin,"[20, 41]","There's a review on IMDb of The Vow that says the romance movie ""keeps its distance from clich&eacute;s and cheesiness,"" and it just made me wonder just what in the hell this person saw that I didn't. The Vow is the story of Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), a married couple that is very much in love. One evening, they get into a terrible car accident and Paige loses her recent memory meaning she doesn't remember the love of her life or their relationship. She basically still has a thing for her ex-fianc&eacute; Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and doesn't understand why she doesn't have her family in her life. Leo does everything in his power to try and remind Paige of the love they once shared, but Paige is showing no signs of recovery.The one good thing The Vow has going for it is that there is decent chemistry between Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. There's at least a mild connection between the two and the scenes when they're alone are perhaps the most powerful this romance has to offer. That isn't saying much though since a good portion of their on-screen time together is devoted to them looking longingly at one another, laughing endlessly, or acting like Beaky Buzzard from Looney Tunes. Then when they do open their mouth, the most inane excuse of flattery comes oozing from their lips. You'll debate on punching yourself in the face in hopes of knocking yourself out to prevent seeing the rest of this monstrosity.Why is it that every time there's a movie like this revolving around a brain injury NOBODY knows anything about it? They all play ignorant or gullible and basically have no clue as to what they have to deal with. You'd think that they would've seen the dozen or so romance films they borrowed from before actually setting out and ripping them off. Rachel McAdams has pretty much been trying to make The Notebook again ever since 2004. There have been some exceptions like Red Eye, Wedding Crashers, and Sherlock Holmes, but everything in between has been along the same lines. It's as if The Vow recycles every Rachel McAdams movie you've ever seen and tries to combine them with the concept from The Lookout or Vanilla Sky, but it feels so regurgitated and so familiar that it comes off feeling like it heavily borrowed from The Number 23 which is the furthest thing from a compliment any movie could ask for. Is there honestly much of a difference between The Vow and The Time Traveler's Wife?In the meantime, you'll be groaning over every decision Paige makes after the accident. It's not as if Channing Tatum isn't to blame as well as his words and actions are just as mushy as the ones Rachel McAdams makes, but it's the way Paige saying she has to make decisions for herself only to wind right back where she started is what makes the entire concept, the actor's performances, and the entire movie totally and completely pointless. Channing Tatum plays guitar in one sequence that'll just make you hope and pray he doesn't break into song. Just because you have brain damage doesn't mean you have to be stupid. Is that a concept that's so hard to grasp? Leave it to a movie labeling itself as a romance being capable of triggering feelings of disgust, frustration, and hatred for fictional characters you probably haven't ever felt this strongly before.The Vow IS extremely clich&eacute; and cheesy. Emotions are forced, sappy scenes go on way too long, and the movie is nothing but a string of stupid decisions. The Vow illustrates that nothing stands in the way of fate and even if you had the chance to do things over again that you'd follow the exact same path even if it wasn't your intention. This point is idiotic. Given the opportunity, why would you want an important event in your life to go down exactly the same way? The entire movie comes off as a complete waste of time. The Vow is the prime example of regression, moving backwards in life, or perhaps standing still for entirely too long. The Vow is typical and forcefully romantic trite that will make you wish you get into a car accident on the way home in hopes of getting your own form of brain damage to keep you from remembering this God awful excuse of a movie.",1,Downright atrocious,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,4189,"['review', 'IMDb', 'Vow', 'romance', 'movie', 'distance', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cheesiness', 'just', 'made', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'hell', 'person', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'Vow', 'story', 'Leo', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Paige', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'married', 'couple', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'One', 'evening', 'get', 'terrible', 'car', 'accident', 'Paige', 'recent', 'memory', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'remember', 'love', 'life', 'relationship', 'basically', 'still', 'thing', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'Jeremy', 'Scott', 'Speedman', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'life', 'Leo', 'everything', 'power', 'try', 'remind', 'Paige', 'love', 'once', 'shared', 'Paige', 'showing', 'signs', 'recovery.The', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'Vow', 'going', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'least', 'mild', 'connection', 'two', 'scenes', 'when', ""'re"", 'alone', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'romance', 'offer', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'good', 'portion', 'on-screen', 'time', 'together', 'devoted', 'looking', 'longingly', 'one', 'laughing', 'endlessly', 'acting', 'Beaky', 'Buzzard', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'Then', 'when', 'do', 'open', 'mouth', 'most', 'inane', 'excuse', 'flattery', 'oozing', 'lips', ""'ll"", 'debate', 'punching', 'face', 'hopes', 'knocking', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'rest', 'monstrosity.Why', 'time', 'movie', 'revolving', 'around', 'brain', 'injury', 'NOBODY', 'anything', 'play', 'ignorant', 'gullible', 'basically', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'have', 'deal', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'so', 'romance', 'films', 'borrowed', 'actually', 'setting', 'out', 'ripping', 'off', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'Notebook', 'again', 'ever', '2004', 'have', 'been', 'exceptions', 'Red', 'Eye', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'everything', 'been', 'same', 'lines', 'Vow', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'tries', 'combine', 'concept', 'Lookout', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'so', 'regurgitated', 'so', 'familiar', 'off', 'feeling', 'heavily', 'borrowed', 'Number', '23', 'furthest', 'thing', 'compliment', 'movie', 'could', 'ask', 'there', 'honestly', 'much', 'difference', 'Vow', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'meantime', ""'ll"", 'be', 'groaning', 'decision', 'Paige', 'accident', 'not', 'Channing', 'Tatum', ""n't"", 'blame', 'as', 'well', 'words', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'mushy', 'ones', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'way', 'Paige', 'saying', 'make', 'decisions', 'only', 'wind', 'right', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'what', 'entire', 'concept', 'actor', 'performances', 'entire', 'movie', 'totally', 'completely', 'pointless', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'plays', 'guitar', 'one', 'sequence', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'hope', 'pray', ""n't"", 'break', 'song', 'Just', 'have', 'brain', 'damage', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'be', 'stupid', 'concept', 'so', 'hard', 'grasp', 'Leave', 'movie', 'labeling', 'romance', 'being', 'capable', 'triggering', 'feelings', 'disgust', 'frustration', 'hatred', 'fictional', 'characters', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'felt', 'strongly', 'before.The', 'Vow', 'IS', 'extremely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cheesy', 'Emotions', 'are', 'forced', 'sappy', 'scenes', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'nothing', 'string', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'Vow', 'nothing', 'stands', 'way', 'fate', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'things', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'follow', 'exact', 'same', 'path', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'intention', 'point', 'idiotic', 'Given', 'opportunity', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'important', 'event', 'life', 'go', 'down', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'entire', 'movie', 'off', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Vow', 'prime', 'example', 'regression', 'moving', 'backwards', 'life', 'perhaps', 'standing', 'still', 'entirely', 'too', 'long', 'Vow', 'typical', 'forcefully', 'romantic', 'trite', 'will', 'make', 'wish', 'get', 'car', 'accident', 'way', 'home', 'hopes', 'getting', 'own', 'form', 'brain', 'damage', 'keep', 'remembering', 'God', 'awful', 'excuse', 'movie']",The Vow

I would have expected the movie to be heavy on the emotional pain of the events that follow such a traumatic event and its recovery but instead we get more of a sweet love story that glosses over most of the hard parts.Before the accident, Paige was married to Leo for a few years, was a vegetarian, was a thriving artist and was estranged from her parents.  After the accident, Paige's memory basically rebooted itself to a time years earlier where she was engaged to a different man, ate meat, wanted to be a lawyer and still spoke to her parents leaving her husband completely out of the picture.Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum play the leads here and both do a good job with the material they were given to work with.  The story follows them as they try to be a couple but since Paige is a totally different person things just don't gel the way a married couple should gel.SPOILER ALERT: If you're expecting a big dramatic moment when the world resets itself and Paige realizes everything she once was and had, you don't get it here.

He was truly the perfect gentleman. He even learned to love the cat. Great for a superficial story but not a great movie.

It would have starred Troy Donahue and either Connie Stevens or Suzanne Pleshette with plenty of picture-postcard scenes as they decide should they or shouldn't they.  Granted, this film goes well past that question but still ponders the enduring power of love against the odds of amnesia, overbearing parents, a snarky ex-boyfriend, and a bohemian lifestyle that still seems quite comfortable. Credited to no less than three writers - Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims - and directed by Michael Sucsy, the story is based on the true experiences of a devoutly Christian couple who amazingly went through the trials depicted here, and even though the religious element could have brought an intriguing angle to a more audacious filmmaker, it's removed in this version to broaden its audience appeal. It also makes the whole venture feel more manufactured and ultimately generic.Paige and Leo are an attractive pair of kindred artistic soulmates who fall desperately in love. Everything is beyond euphoric for them until a snowstorm forces a truck to skid uncontrollably and sends Paige headlong through their front windshield right after she unbuckles her seatbelt to smooch Leo. Paige later awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks he's her doctor. It turns out the collision has erased the last five years of her memory. She doesn't remember not only meeting and marrying Leo but also leaving law school to become an avant-garde sculptor and vegetarian. We find out she has completely forgotten her estrangement from her status-conscious parents who want to see her reunite with Jeremy, the businessman fianc&eacute;e she had dumped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer. Consequently, she starts to revert back to her earlier self, and it is apparently up to Leo to reignite the chemistry that brought them together in the first place. If the set-up wasn't based on reality, there could have been the makings of an interesting psychological thriller or even a dark comedy, but the whole story is played straight-up for maximum tissue usage.Although I am beginning to appreciate his comic skills elsewhere (21 Jump Street), the lunkish Channing Tatum has to work overtime to come across as anything more than this generation's Troy Donahue as the tortured Leo, but the by-the-numbers script, especially his psycho-babble voiceover, works heavily against him. Rachel McAdams showed early promise inMean Girls, but with few exceptions, her career has lately been a series of romantically hazy heroines caught in soul-searching dilemmas (The Notebook,The Time Traveler's Wife). Her Paige whether in before or after modes is no exception to this increasingly tired pattern. The normally likeable Scott Speedman is relegated to the cardboard role of resentful suitor as Jeremy, while Sam Neill is all greed and bluster as Paige's father. A surgically altered Jessica Lange barely registers except for one late scene with McAdams that finally moves the plot toward its inevitable resolution. Life-changing accidents have figured prominently for as long as cinema has been around fromMagnificent ObsessiontoWhile You Were Sleeping, but previous executions better reflected their times or at least situations that feel more realistic than the true-life story here.",2,"Relentlessly Old-Fashioned ""Date Movie"" Can't Escape Its Soapy Sensibilities",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,3637,"['movie', 'was', 'made', '1950', 'trust', 'many', 'character', 'sensibilities', 'melodramatic', 'plot', 'feel', 'period', 'then', 'old-fashioned', '2012', 'romantic', 'drama', 'would', 'be', 'marketed', 'date', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'drive-in', 'try', 'figure', 'out', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'third', 'base', 'date', 'would', 'have', 'starred', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'either', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'plenty', 'picture-postcard', 'scenes', 'decide', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'Granted', 'film', 'well', 'question', 'still', 'enduring', 'power', 'love', 'odds', 'amnesia', 'overbearing', 'parents', 'snarky', 'ex-boyfriend', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'still', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'Credited', 'less', 'three', 'writers', 'Abby', 'Kohn', 'Marc', 'Silverstein', 'Jason', 'Katims', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Sucsy', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'experiences', 'devoutly', 'Christian', 'couple', 'who', 'amazingly', 'went', 'trials', 'depicted', 'here', 'even', 'religious', 'element', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'intriguing', 'angle', 'more', 'audacious', 'filmmaker', 'removed', 'version', 'broaden', 'audience', 'appeal', 'also', 'whole', 'venture', 'feel', 'more', 'manufactured', 'ultimately', 'generic.Paige', 'Leo', 'are', 'attractive', 'pair', 'kindred', 'artistic', 'soulmates', 'who', 'fall', 'desperately', 'love', 'Everything', 'euphoric', 'snowstorm', 'truck', 'skid', 'uncontrollably', 'Paige', 'headlong', 'front', 'windshield', 'right', 'seatbelt', 'smooch', 'Leo', 'Paige', 'later', 'coma', 'see', 'Leo', 'bedside', 'doctor', 'out', 'collision', 'erased', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'memory', ""n't"", 'remember', 'not', 'only', 'meeting', 'marrying', 'Leo', 'also', 'leaving', 'law', 'school', 'become', 'avant-garde', 'sculptor', 'vegetarian', 'find', 'out', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'estrangement', 'status-conscious', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'reunite', 'Jeremy', 'businessman', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'had', 'dumped', 'even', 'meeting', 'Leo', 'struggling', 'music', 'producer', 'Consequently', 'revert', 'back', 'earlier', 'self', 'apparently', 'up', 'Leo', 'reignite', 'chemistry', 'brought', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'set-up', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'reality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'makings', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'even', 'dark', 'comedy', 'whole', 'story', 'played', 'straight-up', 'maximum', 'tissue', 'am', 'beginning', 'appreciate', 'comic', 'skills', 'elsewhere', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'lunkish', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'work', 'overtime', 'come', 'anything', 'more', 'generation', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'tortured', 'Leo', 'by-the-numbers', 'script', 'especially', 'psycho-babble', 'voiceover', 'heavily', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'showed', 'early', 'promise', 'inMean', 'Girls', 'few', 'exceptions', 'career', 'lately', 'been', 'series', 'romantically', 'hazy', 'heroines', 'caught', 'soul-searching', 'dilemmas', 'Notebook', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'Paige', 'modes', 'exception', 'increasingly', 'tired', 'pattern', 'normally', 'likeable', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'relegated', 'cardboard', 'role', 'resentful', 'suitor', 'Jeremy', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'greed', 'bluster', 'Paige', 'father', 'surgically', 'altered', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'barely', 'one', 'late', 'scene', 'McAdams', 'finally', 'plot', 'inevitable', 'resolution', 'Life-changing', 'accidents', 'have', 'figured', 'prominently', 'as', 'long', 'cinema', 'been', 'fromMagnificent', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'previous', 'executions', 'better', 'reflected', 'times', 'least', 'situations', 'feel', 'more', 'realistic', 'true-life', 'story', 'here']",The Vow
1465632,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIGSM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","THE VOW (2012, 105 minutes) is a somewhat saccharine, immaturely told story (a true story) about a young Chicago couple involved in a car wreck. Though the husband Leo (Channing Tatum) seems fine after a blur that represents a time span impossible to determine, his wife Paige (Rachel McAdams) loses all memory of the last five years. Therefore all knowledge of her husband is erased, because they have been together for just under five years.The film rushes through this in a clumsy way that I felt was too confusing to serve the storyline. Her estranged parents (Sam Neill, Jessica Lange) suddenly appear, and it is interesting to see the constricted reactions all around - it is obvious another trauma besides Paige's head injury is lurking in her mind. The trouble is the director, who cannot seem to unfold a story properly. A skilled director could have made some big money shots on that sort of drama, but it doesn't happen here.Leo is absolutely hostile toward Paige's parents, they are far too eager to take her home with them and leave Leo behind in the dust, it is all extremely weird and then the director leaves the viewer hanging. In fact, I had a very hard time telling if Leo knew Paige's parents at all or not. It seems he did not know them at all, nor they him, and we do ultimately discover what occurred. Five years earlier, Paige left her home and family for the city; roughly a year after that, she married Leo.To be frank, this is not a bad attempt at an old-fashioned family film, something reminiscent of the 1950s and I fully appreciate that. It centers around a tragedy that raises some interesting moral dilemmas, raises issues that appear to want to remain buried but will not remain so. As I sat watching, I thought how horrible it must still be for this family, since the wife still hasn't regained her memory to this day. The trouble is this subject matter deserves more mature treatment, a better development instead of the endless arguing between this man whose wife does not recognize who he is anymore. This comes off as a cheap Hallmark film.Again, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Excellent as it is, I do not know why Tatum's acting/narration of the story is criticized. But this story needed something more than the puerile approach it takes. There is silly up-tempo rock, what I always call ""whiny college music"", and much of the film strikes me as a music video. It is insulting to the intelligence. This film seems to miss some vital points: love cannot be demanded, memories can't be forced and life will go on following its own course, not ours.Yet the director fails everyone. How on earth can someone make a movie about something, then not really address it at all throughout the entire film?The true problem here - aside from the dreadful catastrophe of Rachel McAdams' acting - is the fact that Tatum fails to establish any chemistry. Tatum is essentially raw as an actor, comes across as goofy and unintelligent. He requires a good director's guidance, which of course he fails to receive here, and it is that failure that tends to turn off certain viewers. In truth, Tatum is incredibly loveable, intelligent and is gaining in skill, worked his butt off for a film that in truth does not deserve him.Tatum will never get far doing films like this. Matt Damon suffered much the same as Tatum does, until he began to acquire a few lines of wisdom in his face. I notice that now I find Damon delightful - I used to deplore him as one of the dumbest, lousiest actors ever. Moral? Everyone deserves a chance.Even Rachel frickin' McAdams.This movie shows what a truly bad director can do to storylines and actors. Sam Neill, who is a modern treasure, often gets shunted into dumb side-lined roles, and if he gets no good direction he sort of flails around like an amateur. That is what happens in this film - what a waste. Jessica Lange holds it together because I know she's totally used to rotten directors and unfairly ""cameo-ized"" roles (that's my term, don't steal it). I can only add that this kind of effort at filmmaking is what sinks a lot of worthy careers before they start.All in all I can only say you might like this film. I was interested enough to watch it all the way through, unbearable as certain moments were, because I wanted to see what happened in the end. And that has to be some sort of weak endorsement for the inherent value of a movie. Though it drained Channing Tatum of any signs of life, pushed the revolting Rachel McAdams on the viewer (wow, I can imagine the stunning Scarlet Johansson in this), tortured poor Sam Neill, shoved Jessica Lange into the trunk of the cinematic car and ruined the telling of a marvelous true story, it still has ... something.It has the force of truth. What I think is missing here is simple: this should have been a Jewish couple.

THE VOW for all intents and purposes seems and sound and looks like a Nicholas Sparks recipe film, but the fact that is NOT by Sparks should alert the audience that there may be more here than expected.  Based on a true story, rendered by Stuart Sender and Jason Katims and adapted for the screen by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, knowing that the concept is based on reality helps ground the film. Director Michael Sucsy (Grey Gardens) manages to keep this overly long film centered and allows each of the characters to become developed as people rather than clones.Leo Channing Tatum in his most sensitive role to date) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a couple who just got married. After an accident, Paige is left unconscious, and when she awakes she doesn't remember Leo. Her physician (Wendy Crewson) reassures her that her memory will likely return if she resumes a normal life. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange), whom she hasn't since she and Leo got together, come and visit her - a rather strange situation since Paige has not had contact with her parents since she left law school (we later find out why the personal motivations) and moved to the city (Chicago) to pursue a career as a sculptor. For some reason Paige remembers her parents and her old friends (including a sister (Jessica McNamee)  with whom she broke ties five years ago, ditto an ex-boyfriend (Scott Speedman, remembered for his brilliant performance in 'The 24th Day') she abandoned. Leo and Paige's new family (Joey Klein, Joe Cobden and Shannon Barnett) want to bring her home with them but her parents demand she return to their expensive home to prepare for Paige's sisters wedding to a nice guy (Dillon Casey). She goes with Leo but when she doesn't recognize anything, she goes to her parents. When Paige returns to her parents she is puzzled as to why she left five years ago. Meanwhile Leo tries to win her back by courting her again. Secrets are uncovered and though Paige never regains her memory, her life does indeed change.Though the film does indeed drag a bit at times and could have used a better editor, the actors bring this unusual story to life.

1465644,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B005LAIGSM,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[82, 95]","""The Vow"" 2012 is a romantic drama with some comedic moments thrown in. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum play a young married couple whose lives take a tragic fate when they suffer a car accident.McAdams's character, Paige, isn't horribly disfigured or anything like that, but she suffers brain trauma which has blocked all memory of Tatum's character Leo.Leo tries to get regain her memory by trying to have her fall in love with him again.That's the movie. These romantic dramas get manufactured every year, and I have seen hundreds of them. However, I really liked the movie.It's true that these types of movies aren't original, but that doesn't bother me too much as long as the product is good. Like I said, I liked it primarily because Rachel and Channing were very good in the leads.It's true that perhaps the ""brain trauma"" aspect of the plot could have been worked a bit more, I mean Paige remembers a lot of things that you wouldn't expect someone whose had brain trauma to remember, so this part of the movie could come out as implausible to some people.However, most people who have enjoyed the film don't care about that. This is a love story first and foremost, so it's more about seeing the characters going through the motions and trying to get those magic feelings for each other againThe performances are excellent. Channing and Rachel have great chemistry. The acting is never forced and the characters are believable.Once we learn about Paige's past, we kind of understand why it's hard for her to remember Leo or at least not embrace it: Part of her life has been burdened by her overbearing father (played by Sam Neil) who doesn't quite respect her decisions, an ex-boyfriend Jeremy (Scott Speedman) who can't quite let her go, and other personal issues.Rachel McAdams plays her character well. She is pretty, nice personality, but a little unsure of herself.Tatum is good as the guy next door whose willing to put up with a lot all in the name of love. In fact, small parts of the movie are actually narrated by Leo as he tries to tell the audience what love really is. It's a nice addition to make the movie stand out a bit more from just being another movie. I liked his discussion of ""moments of impact"" in the filmAll in all it's just a nice romantic movie. Some might find some issues with the science part of the movie or say it's predictable, but it's a movie that you see to make you laugh and feel good at the end.",5,Nice romantic movie,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2447,"['Vow', '2012', 'romantic', 'drama', 'comedic', 'moments', 'thrown', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'play', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'lives', 'take', 'tragic', 'fate', 'when', 'suffer', 'car', 'accident.McAdams', 'character', 'Paige', ""n't"", 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'anything', 'brain', 'trauma', 'blocked', 'memory', 'Tatum', 'character', 'Leo.Leo', 'get', 'regain', 'memory', 'trying', 'have', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'get', 'manufactured', 'year', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'However', 'really', 'liked', 'movie.It', 'true', 'types', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'original', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'as', 'long', 'product', 'good', 'said', 'liked', 'primarily', 'Rachel', 'Channing', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'leads.It', 'true', 'perhaps', 'brain', 'trauma', 'aspect', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'bit', 'more', 'mean', 'Paige', 'lot', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'someone', 'had', 'brain', 'trauma', 'remember', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'come', 'out', 'implausible', 'people.However', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'love', 'story', 'first', 'foremost', 'more', 'seeing', 'characters', 'going', 'motions', 'trying', 'get', 'magic', 'feelings', 'other', 'againThe', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Channing', 'Rachel', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'never', 'forced', 'characters', 'are', 'believable.Once', 'learn', 'Paige', 'past', 'kind', 'understand', 'why', 'hard', 'remember', 'Leo', 'least', 'not', 'embrace', 'Part', 'life', 'been', 'burdened', 'overbearing', 'father', 'played', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'respect', 'decisions', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'let', 'go', 'other', 'personal', 'issues.Rachel', 'McAdams', 'character', 'well', 'pretty', 'nice', 'personality', 'little', 'unsure', 'herself.Tatum', 'good', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'lot', 'name', 'love', 'fact', 'small', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'actually', 'narrated', 'Leo', 'tell', 'audience', 'what', 'really', 'nice', 'addition', 'make', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'movie', 'liked', 'discussion', 'moments', 'impact', 'filmAll', 'just', 'nice', 'romantic', 'movie', 'might', 'find', 'issues', 'science', 'part', 'movie', 'say', 'predictable', 'movie', 'see', 'make', 'laugh', 'feel', 'good', 'end']",The Vow

1465647,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGSM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[47, 63]","You probably won't ever see Channing Tatum ferociously chewing the scenery, but you must give him props for earnestness. In THE VOW he handles the voiceover narration, and you could feel him trying. But when he launches into his clunky theory on ""moments of impact,"" it's hard for me to buy it as credible insight. Maybe I'm biased. Probably I've pigeonholed Channing Tatum. Perhaps I was expecting him to bust an ill dance move or join a fight club. Me, I liked this film okay. And for the film's starry-eyed target audience, no amount of dis will sway them. Still, somewhere, even the staff writers at Hallmark are rolling their eyes.In wintry Chicago, Leo (Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a young married couple still very much in love with each other. After all, they wrote their wedding vows on the menus of their favorite restaurant, and that right there probably qualifies what they have as some sort of legendary love affair. But then a runaway truck smashes into their car, and there's Paige catapulting thru the windshield. Leo, who had his seatbelt on, is relatively fine. When Paige awakens from her coma, she discovers that she's suffering from selective amnesia. She can't remember the last five years of her life. She can't imagine being this in demand sculptor and living in the city and married to Leo, this sudden stranger.I'm sure them womenfolk are swooning all over Channing Tatum (who also bares his behind in one scene, so, uh, yay). Tatum is rendered ridiculously sympathetic by his romantic gestures and by virtue of what he's put thru by the amnesiac Paige. Leo remains the sweet devoted spouse, desperately striving to win his estranged wife all over again. But it's tough, really tough. Once a free-spirited creature, Paige now seems like an entirely different person. One of Leo and Paige's mutual friends voices our concern: ""I'm just worried if she doesn't remember you, how's she supposed to remember she's in love with you?"" Somewhere, Nicholas Sparks is kicking himself for not thinking up this plot.Not that Paige is purposely mean or thoughtless. She's experiencing her own bits of turmoil. And, me, what I found really interesting are those moments which focus on Paige and the scary stuff she's going thru. Rachel McAdams is quite good at conveying that sense of desolation and confusion and helplessness one must feel when stricken with deep memory loss.From Paige's perspective, it's like this: She's never had a falling out with her rich, conservative parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). She's still in law school and engaged to her old sweetheart Jeremy (Scott Speedman). Today, Paige can't comprehend what would compel her to move to the city or give up law study or not be on speaking terms with her parents. What made her break up with Jeremy? I remember getting mad at myself in the theater for getting suckered in by these concerns. But I found myself wanting to know what made Paige turn her back on her old life five years ago.Watching the love of your life just slip away from you, no matter how hard you try to hold on - what's a more irresistible premise, especially on Valentine's Day? Channing Tatum's got a long road to go before he achieves real actor status. He still tends to be stiff and awkward. Except that, for this film, his awkwardness works in his favor. It makes him even more of an underdog, especially when pitted against the urbane Speedman and those old acting hands Sam Neill and Jesicca Lange. It's a shame, by the way, that Jessica Lange only gets that one scene in which to strut her stuff.There are romantic beats in THE VOW that, for all their predictability and heavyhandedness, are still worth waiting for. And that's because McAdams and Tatum do create some sparks in their scenes together. Despite her newfound attraction to Jeremy, Paige gradually, cautiously becomes open to Leo's advances. She remarks: ""I married him. It must've been for some reason."" This then leads to probably my favorite sequence, which is their ""first date."" Since I'm a manly man, I won't swoon or have vapors. But I liked that sequence.THE VOW is based on the real-life story of Kim and Krickitt Carpenter. Apparently, Krickitt never did recover from her amnesia, and yet they're happily married with two kids. Not that I'm saying that's what happens in this movie. In fact, surprisingly, THE VOW veers away from giving us a grand romantic gesture in the finale. I like that the resolution unfolds unexpectedly and messily and almost in anticlimactic fashion. But the way the last 20 or so minutes unfold feels more believable. I was glad there wasn't a mad dash thru the airport or a dramatic ""Stop the Wedding!"" moment at the twelfth hour. The clich&eacute; police are overtaxed as it is.",3,"""...to agree or disagree on red velvet cake...""",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,4757,"['probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'ferociously', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'must', 'give', 'props', 'earnestness', 'VOW', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'could', 'feel', 'trying', 'when', 'clunky', 'theory', 'moments', 'impact', 'hard', 'buy', 'credible', 'insight', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'biased', 'Probably', ""'ve"", 'pigeonholed', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'expecting', 'bust', 'ill', 'dance', 'move', 'join', 'fight', 'club', 'Me', 'liked', 'film', 'okay', 'film', 'starry-eyed', 'target', 'audience', 'amount', 'dis', 'will', 'sway', 'Still', 'somewhere', 'even', 'staff', 'writers', 'Hallmark', 'are', 'rolling', 'eyes.In', 'wintry', 'Chicago', 'Leo', 'Tatum', 'Paige', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'are', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'wrote', 'wedding', 'vows', 'menus', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'right', 'probably', 'qualifies', 'what', 'have', 'sort', 'legendary', 'love', 'affair', 'then', 'runaway', 'truck', 'smashes', 'car', 'Paige', 'catapulting', 'windshield', 'Leo', 'who', 'had', 'seatbelt', 'relatively', 'fine', 'When', 'Paige', 'coma', 'suffering', 'selective', 'amnesia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'being', 'demand', 'sculptor', 'living', 'city', 'married', 'Leo', 'sudden', 'stranger.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'swooning', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'also', 'behind', 'one', 'scene', 'so', 'uh', 'yay', 'Tatum', 'rendered', 'ridiculously', 'sympathetic', 'romantic', 'gestures', 'virtue', 'what', 'put', 'thru', 'amnesiac', 'Paige', 'Leo', 'sweet', 'devoted', 'spouse', 'desperately', 'striving', 'win', 'estranged', 'wife', 'over', 'again', 'tough', 'really', 'tough', 'Once', 'free-spirited', 'creature', 'Paige', 'now', 'entirely', 'different', 'person', 'One', 'Leo', 'Paige', 'mutual', 'friends', 'voices', 'concern', ""'m"", 'just', 'worried', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'supposed', 'remember', 'love', 'Somewhere', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'kicking', 'not', 'thinking', 'up', 'plot.Not', 'Paige', 'purposely', 'mean', 'thoughtless', 'experiencing', 'own', 'bits', 'turmoil', 'what', 'found', 'really', 'interesting', 'are', 'moments', 'focus', 'Paige', 'scary', 'stuff', 'going', 'thru', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'quite', 'good', 'conveying', 'sense', 'desolation', 'confusion', 'helplessness', 'one', 'must', 'feel', 'when', 'stricken', 'deep', 'memory', 'Paige', 'perspective', 'never', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'rich', 'conservative', 'parents', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'still', 'law', 'school', 'engaged', 'old', 'sweetheart', 'Jeremy', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Today', 'Paige', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'what', 'would', 'compel', 'move', 'city', 'give', 'up', 'law', 'study', 'not', 'be', 'speaking', 'terms', 'parents', 'What', 'made', 'break', 'up', 'Jeremy', 'remember', 'getting', 'mad', 'theater', 'getting', 'suckered', 'concerns', 'found', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'Paige', 'turn', 'back', 'old', 'life', 'five', 'years', 'ago.Watching', 'love', 'life', 'just', 'slip', 'away', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'hold', 'what', 'more', 'irresistible', 'premise', 'especially', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'got', 'long', 'road', 'go', 'real', 'actor', 'status', 'still', 'be', 'stiff', 'awkward', 'film', 'awkwardness', 'favor', 'even', 'more', 'underdog', 'especially', 'when', 'pitted', 'urbane', 'Speedman', 'old', 'acting', 'hands', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Jesicca', 'Lange', 'shame', 'way', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'strut', 'stuff.There', 'are', 'romantic', 'beats', 'THE', 'VOW', 'predictability', 'heavyhandedness', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'waiting', 'McAdams', 'Tatum', 'do', 'create', 'sparks', 'scenes', 'together', 'newfound', 'attraction', 'Jeremy', 'Paige', 'gradually', 'cautiously', 'open', 'Leo', 'advances', 'remarks', 'married', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reason', 'then', 'probably', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'first', 'date', ""'m"", 'manly', 'man', 'wo', ""n't"", 'swoon', 'have', 'vapors', 'liked', 'sequence.THE', 'VOW', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Kim', 'Krickitt', 'Carpenter', 'Apparently', 'Krickitt', 'never', 'did', 'recover', 'amnesia', 'yet', ""'re"", 'happily', 'married', 'two', 'kids', 'Not', ""'m"", 'saying', 'what', 'movie', 'fact', 'surprisingly', 'THE', 'VOW', 'veers', 'away', 'giving', 'grand', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'finale', 'like', 'resolution', 'unexpectedly', 'messily', 'almost', 'anticlimactic', 'fashion', 'way', 'last', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'unfold', 'feels', 'more', 'believable', 'was', 'glad', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'mad', 'dash', 'thru', 'airport', 'dramatic', 'Stop', 'Wedding', 'moment', 'twelfth', 'hour', 'clich', 'eacute', 'police', 'are', 'overtaxed']",The Vow

It is an interesting concept. A desperately in love couple is split apart after a tragic accident erases the past 5 years of the memory of the wife. Her husband is now a complete stranger. Her feelings are now with the ex-finance she dumped years ago. Time has stood still and everything that has happened in the past 5 years is no longer part of her memory or reality. Her family is back in her life as there is no memory of the rift that caused her to break all contact with them.THE VOW certainly has good intentions even though something is lost along the way. Rachel McAdams as Paige is lovely as always and Channing Tatum provides the beefcake. They both try but the chemistry between them is not so strong. It is interesting to follow Paige's journey into a life she does not remember and her looking at pictures and videos that must seem totally alien. The story could have delved deeper into this journey.Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are in the supporting roles of Paige's parents. It was sad to see how time has not been good to the lovely Jessica Lange who looks so much older than her ""husband"" Sam Neill. Paige returns to her parents' home since there is no memory of why she left and broke all contact with them and including her sister. She even broke contact with her sister apparently for no reason. When we learn the reason for the rift, it is anti-climatic. Is that all? That is the reason she left her family and broke all contact? It seems like the author could have found a more compelling reason.At the end there is a brief reference to the couple who inspired this story.

They meet by accident in a city office building and the chemistry is immediate.  They are made for each other and soon after they get married.  The romance continues until a tragic auto accident.Their parked car is slammed into from behind by a massive truck that injures both of them but she is thrown through the windshield and endures massive brain trauma. She is kept in a coma to help her recover from brain swelling and injuries.  Leo lovingly stays by her side throughout the ordeal.  When she is finally awoken she remembers everything about her life from 5 years ago but nothing about her career, her art schooling or her love and marriage to Leo....This is a classic love story that is tragically broken while at its peak by the accident.  Leo fights to regain Paige's love and to keep her meddling parents from taking over her second chance at life.  Paige forgets why she left her parents' home, left law school and she still loves her old boyfriend but doesn't know her loving husband and all the friends of the last 5 years.This is a well written story line based on true events.  It is sad, sweet and brings back the meaning of your wedding vows that you committed for life.  It will make you smile and it will make you sad.  I like the fact that the two main protagonists seem to have real chemistry together and for me it made the movie.The movie received poor reviews from the critics but it did well at the box office and it is well worth seeing.

Channing Tatum's character is always actively attacking the problem so he has a range of emotion and plot points to navigate. McAdams has to be completely reactive for most of the film and spends all her time in confusion, frustration, discomfort, trepidation, and aggravation - none of which makes her character particularly engaging or appealing and all of which look pretty much the same on the screen.Yes, it makes her real. You squirm and fidget and get frustrated yourself while watching her - just like Tatum's character does - and that's exactly the effect the film wants to achieve. It deserves applause for achieving it in large part. But that realistic touch is a hard sell in a film marketed as romantic fluff. Right or wrong, it's not what most audiences want to feel while watching it.It's funny reading reviews here by people who complain how selfish she is because she is frequently upset and isn't cheerfully embracing all the wonderful things her husband is trying to do for her.

So the biggest surprise this week is a romance that is unbelievable and yet based on reality. Not only that but the movie is touching, romantic and draws you in. That movie is THE VOW.Channing Tatum and Rachael McAdams play Leo and Paige, a young couple deeply in love on their way home from a night out in winter. Stopped at a stop sign, their car is rear ended by a sliding snow plow, sending Paige through the window to suffer severe brain damage. Kept in a coma to decrease the severity of her injury when she wakes she has no recollection of the accident but worse still no idea who Leo is. It's as if the last 5 years of her life have disappeared.Hoping that time heals all wounds, Leo stays with her even though she recoils from him, a complete stranger in her mind. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) show and try to encourage her to leave the hospital and go with them. Leo convinces her that the best hope she has of recovering her memory is to return to the life they had. She agrees for now with the idea that should things not work out she'll return to her parent's home.Its slow going as the couple Leo tries to convince the woman he desperately loves that she loves him in return. The Paige from before she and Leo met is a completely different person from who he thought he knew. For some reason she left her home and friends to come to the city, but we never know why. The couple goes back and forth, trying to bring back their life together but eventually Paige's parents convince her to come home.Helping her sister plan her wedding and still trying to find herself, Paige meets up with her ex-fianc&eacute; (Scott Speedman). Her parents try to convince her that she still wants to go to law school even though she was an artist while with Leo. An old friend is shunned but others are brought back into the fold. And as Leo watches, hoping against all odds to reunite with this woman, she slowly begins to distance herself from him for her old self.This romance involves not two young lovers meeting for the first time but two lovers who met and fell in love only to lose all memory of that. The only hope is for them to once more come together replacing those old memories with new ones. And the suspense of the film lies in that idea, of whether or not they can come together once more of will Paige slide back into the past that is all she remembers now. And what about that terrible secret that no one seems to want to talk about that forced her out so long ago?The movie is supposed to be based on an actual couple that went through this trauma and after watching the film many will want to make a point of reading the book based on their life to find out just what is and isn't a part of their story. In the meantime this movie offers a completely entertaining night that won't bore you and actually won't make you break down and cry either, no matter how it sounds. This is a movie where you won't find yourself checking the clock to see just how much is left. It moves along at a steady pace and draws you into the story in steps.The acting is amazing. Never once did I find myself wondering if I was watching actors or real people and that says something. The gift of a true actor is to make you believe they are the people they are portraying. McAdams and Tatum both do that to great effect here.  With the roles he chose early on many would have thought Tatum was nothing more than a muscle bound action star but he displays a depth of emotion here that is necessary for this story to be taken seriously. McAdams shows the frustration and fear in the character of Paige that makes her part of the story come alive as well.Toss aside trying to place this film in the category of chick flick. It's a truly entertaining film from start to finish that will leave you waiting to find out if they get back together or not. This is a movie not only worth renting but worth adding to your collection as well.",5,NEVER FORGET...,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,4065,"['are', 'sappy', 'romance', 'films', 'galore', 'being', 'released', 'theaters', 'days', 'have', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'stories', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'week', 'romance', 'unbelievable', 'yet', 'based', 'reality', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'touching', 'romantic', 'movie', 'THE', 'VOW.Channing', 'Tatum', 'Rachael', 'McAdams', 'play', 'Leo', 'Paige', 'young', 'couple', 'deeply', 'love', 'way', 'home', 'night', 'out', 'winter', 'Stopped', 'stop', 'sign', 'car', 'rear', 'ended', 'sliding', 'snow', 'plow', 'sending', 'Paige', 'window', 'suffer', 'severe', 'brain', 'damage', 'Kept', 'coma', 'decrease', 'severity', 'injury', 'when', 'recollection', 'accident', 'worse', 'still', 'idea', 'who', 'Leo', 'last', '5', 'years', 'life', 'have', 'disappeared.Hoping', 'time', 'heals', 'wounds', 'Leo', 'even', 'complete', 'stranger', 'mind', 'parents', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'show', 'try', 'encourage', 'leave', 'hospital', 'go', 'Leo', 'best', 'hope', 'recovering', 'memory', 'return', 'life', 'had', 'now', 'idea', 'should', 'things', 'not', 'work', 'out', ""'ll"", 'return', 'parent', 'home.Its', 'slow', 'going', 'couple', 'Leo', 'convince', 'woman', 'desperately', 'return', 'Paige', 'Leo', 'met', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'who', 'thought', 'knew', 'reason', 'left', 'home', 'friends', 'come', 'city', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'couple', 'back', 'forth', 'trying', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'together', 'eventually', 'Paige', 'parents', 'convince', 'come', 'home.Helping', 'sister', 'plan', 'wedding', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'Paige', 'up', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'parents', 'try', 'convince', 'still', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'even', 'was', 'artist', 'Leo', 'old', 'friend', 'shunned', 'others', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'fold', 'Leo', 'watches', 'hoping', 'odds', 'reunite', 'woman', 'slowly', 'distance', 'old', 'self.This', 'romance', 'not', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'meeting', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'only', 'lose', 'memory', 'only', 'hope', 'once', 'more', 'come', 'together', 'replacing', 'old', 'memories', 'new', 'ones', 'suspense', 'film', 'idea', 'not', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'once', 'more', 'will', 'Paige', 'slide', 'back', 'past', 'remembers', 'now', 'what', 'terrible', 'secret', 'one', 'want', 'talk', 'forced', 'out', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'actual', 'couple', 'went', 'trauma', 'watching', 'film', 'many', 'will', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'reading', 'book', 'based', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', ""n't"", 'part', 'story', 'meantime', 'movie', 'completely', 'entertaining', 'night', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'actually', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'break', 'down', 'cry', 'either', 'matter', 'how', 'movie', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'checking', 'clock', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'left', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'draws', 'story', 'steps.The', 'acting', 'amazing', 'Never', 'once', 'did', 'find', 'wondering', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'real', 'people', 'something', 'gift', 'true', 'actor', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'portraying', 'McAdams', 'Tatum', 'do', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'roles', 'chose', 'early', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Tatum', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'muscle', 'action', 'star', 'depth', 'emotion', 'here', 'necessary', 'story', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'McAdams', 'frustration', 'fear', 'character', 'Paige', 'part', 'story', 'come', 'alive', 'well.Toss', 'trying', 'place', 'film', 'category', 'chick', 'flick', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'leave', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'worth', 'renting', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'as', 'well']",The Vow

Certainly the leads are attractive enough.  Paige (Rachel Mc Adams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are the perfect young couple.  She's a budding artist with a very cool studio any artist would die for.  He's a self-employed recording engineer who never goes to work.Together they live in an eclectic apartment in a groovy Chicago neighborhood.  The one where The ""L"" glows in a beautiful light blue and quietly passes overhead.  It's winter in Chicago.  The one where the billowy white snow beautifully drifts down, lightly covering the ground.  The one where it's cold, but with no wind, so heavy coats and hats aren't needed.  Well, except for one ugly hat Leo wears to enhance his cool factor.  Paige and Leo are so in love that early in the movie they have to stop at a slick intersection, unbuckle and make out.Little did they suspect the city would have a snow plow out trying to keep the streets clear.  Little did they suspect the driver of said snow plow would be unable to stop before ""plowing"" into the rear of their Volvo.  With Paige's head now through the windshield, she is taken to the hospital and put into an induced coma.  Once she is allowed to wake up, she forgets everything from the point of her decision to leave law school and become a sculpturess.  She doesn't remember Leo or her new friends.  Leo frets and fawns over Paige but nothing is helping.She eventually goes back to her parent's (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) mansion in a wooded suburban section of Chicagoland.  She runs into her old boyfriend (Scott Speedman) and almost goes back to law school.  Almost that is until she stumbles upon why she uprooted her life the first time.  The actors do what they can with this simpleton script.  In one scene, Paige rolls up the car windows just so she can enjoy one of Leo's farts.  Puleeze!  I'm not against romantic films or romantic comedies.  In fact, I like them.  At least those that don't overdose me with saccharine.The Blu ray disc looks and sounds great unlike the movie.

The movie is based on a true story about a married couple who get in a car accident and the wife loses her memory. It practically starts off with the accident but then shows some flashbacks of them together and how totally in love they were. Channing Tatum played an adoring husband who is so in love with his wife and is willing to do anything to get her memory back. I thought Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams made a cute couple and just watching how cute they were together just made me think of how much I love and appreciate all my husband does for me and just makes you think of how sometimes you just take things and time for granted.

In a freak winter accident, Paige flies through the windshield of a car and wakes from a coma with the past five years of her life completely forgotten due to amnesia. She has no idea how her life has changed so dramatically from the time that she remembers, and she has no recollection of her love for Leo. Though discouraged by Paige's family and friends, Leo is determined to remind his wife how and why she fell in love with him.I thought the chemistry between the two central characters was great.

I seen a lot of chick flicks before and this one isn't as good as the others.The story line is pretty good. Leo and Pagie gets into a car accident and Leo is fine, but Pagie has lost her memory. But, she only lost her memory up till a certain point in her life. She doesn't remember Leo, who is her husband. What she does remember is that she just about to go to Law School and she was with her old BF at the time. Pagie gives a shot to live with Leo and not with her parents, which she original wanted to do. But, after Leo convinced her and her parents that it's the better choice to come live with him because she could get her memory back that way. So, Pagie goes lives with Leo. Leo shows Pagie how she was when he was with her and that doesn't go too well. She ends up acting like her old pass self, which Leo has never met. To Leo, this is like a whole different person.Now Leo wants to give this old Pagie a shot. He believes that if he could make the old Pagie fall in love with him, maybe the Pagie he knew will come back out. This doesn't go exactly how he wanted and they end divorced afterwards. They both then try to live their own lives without each other.Eventually, Pagie starts to realized how come she changed so much from the old Pagie that Leo knew. She realized that she hated her parants and that she hated her old BF too. Pagie decides to leave her old life behind and build yet another new life. Leo doesn't knows this and continue on living without her and doing his own thing.This is the kicker. Now, somehow, since this is a love story movie, these two meet each other at the end of the movie again. They decided to give it another shot. Pagie never got her memory back, but still gives hope that it will all work out at the end.I believe this movie had all the right pieces to be a great movie, it just wasn't executed well enough to make me want to give it a higher rating.

Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams deliver the goods, I don't care what anyone says.  Their characters (Leo and Paige) are utterly believable throughout the movie, and Scott Speedman as Jeremy the ex-fiancee, Jessica Lange as Paige's mother, and Sam Neill as Paige's father definitely add to the story with their convicing characters.  I've seen all the tepid reviews and I'm not sure I get what the problem is.  This is a wonderful story of a man holding true to his vow of life long love, who is also mature enough to sacrifice for the happiness of the woman he loves.  It is also a story of hope, patience, and incredible love.  My only wish is that the ending had given us a bit more, because you are really rooting for Leo, hoping Paige will either remember or will just fall in love with him again, and it would have been great to have a little more to hang your heart on than the last scene (I will not give it away more than that).
