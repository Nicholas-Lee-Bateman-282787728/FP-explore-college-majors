Jacoby,"[0, 2]","As a die-hard Anglophile, I expect a lot from my Britcom (particularly when the BBC deems it good/popular enough to transcribe it onto a Region 1 DVD).  These are pretty good, but not necessarily amazingly clever or packed with laugh-out-loud moments.  The acting is usually excellent, particularly the voiceovers (and watch out for a young David Tennant--dreamy!).  The material, while entertaining, just never really takes off for me.  It might be down to the format; maybe the mockumentary has been exhausted as a form of comedy.",3,Definitely some good bits,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,532,"['die-hard', 'Anglophile', 'expect', 'lot', 'Britcom', 'particularly', 'when', 'BBC', 'good/popular', 'enough', 'transcribe', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'necessarily', 'amazingly', 'clever', 'packed', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'acting', 'usually', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'voiceovers', 'watch', 'out', 'young', 'David', 'Tennant', 'dreamy', 'material', 'entertaining', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'off', 'might', 'be', 'down', 'format', 'maybe', 'mockumentary', 'been', 'exhausted', 'form', 'comedy']",People Like Us: The Complete Series

The first episode, I quickly realize it was not real.  Having seen (and loved) the original ""Office"" I found this to be similar, but just not good enough to compare.  As the other episodes came on, I became more used to it and enjoyed it more. Some were good, others didn't really make it.  All it all, it was okay.  The best one by far, was the one with Bill Nighy.  He was totally convincing as a real person.  I thought some spoofs in some of the episodes were a little over the top and not very good.  For me, this would have been something I probably should have just rented... were that possible.

1259042,A2ZJO23IC9QAPT,B002AS460U,Karen511,"[1, 1]","If you happen to be lucky enough to catch the very funny Brit mockumentary &#34;Twenty-Twelve&#34;, which aired right before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London (the premise of the fictional series being about a rather inept and clueless Olympic Planning Committee, trying to get London ready for the Olympics; Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham on &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;, got to show his comedy chops by playing the bumbling but likable head of the planning committee), this series was done by the same creator (who also used some of the same actors from this series for &#34;Twenty Twelve&#34;, like David Tennant, etc.) and is even funnier; the premise is that a fictional (and mostly unseen) &#34;documentarian&#34; by the great silly name of Roy Mallard is going around profiling individuals in different professions & walks of life: a cop, a real estate agent, a reverend, an actor (played by David Tennant), a mid-life crisis photographer (played by the great Bill Nighy, in my favorite episode of the series), etc., etc.; and in the fine &#34;Office&#34;/Christopher Guest-ian tradition of the best mockumentaries, of course most of the people that he interviews & follows around are hopelessly inept and/or bumbling at their particular chosen fields, but nonetheless still charming and irresistibly likable in their earnest attempts to live up to life's expectations.  This is British humor at its best-- dry, subtle & quirky, and worth watching for all the clever little touches that don't have to bash you over the head the way some more heavy-handed comedies do in order to make you laugh.  Especially funny is the way that Roy Mallard himself, who although mostly behind the camera, somehow always manages to get involved in his subject's lives in amusingly awkward ways, which is a joke in itself, since if you know anything about documentary-making, one of the &#34;rules&#34; is that you're NOT supposed to get involved but stay detached & &#34;pretend you're not there&#34;, so you supposedly don't &#34;influence&#34; the subjects in any way; and yet the joke of it is that Roy Mallard is clearly just as bumbling, awkward, and ineffectual as the people he's putting on camera.  Funny writing (especially Mallard's ineptly-written, awkwardly-worded voice-overs) and funny performances.
