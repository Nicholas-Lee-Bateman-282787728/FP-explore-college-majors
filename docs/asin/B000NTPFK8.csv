Containing some big laughs and some skillful scenes, the movie, nevertheless, should stick to its hand and often folds on focus.  The plot is developed alright, but unlike other venues that come to mind, 'Crank' (Fun), 'The Departed' (Twisty and Entertaining), 'Running Scared' (Awesomely Wild) and 'Pulp Fiction' (Clever) or 'Inside Man' (Intelligent), it isn't nearly as satisfying.  By the time one gets near the end of the hit and miss entertainment, the show becomes serious with history that seems tacked on and bluffs the audience.The story is familiar:  Everyone from hired hitmen (and women) to the F.B.I. have a stake on getting ""Buddy 'Aces' Israel Vegas,"" (Jeremy Piven).  If the movie weren't a comic book take on real life, you'd swear all of Gotham City had a jailbreak.  Neo-Nazi's, a torturing mobster, a Russian caretaker, and Vegas hotel security men are all but a few of the unsavory figures trying to get ""...Israel..."".The acting is intense and a cut above.  Alicia Keys is irresistible as tart-talking hit woman, Georgia Sykes.  Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia give urgency for their F.B.I. roles, and Ben Affleck and Matthew Fox break out in ways unseen before.  Writer/director Joe Carnahan's performance is mixed.  As a director he has aces up his sleeve, but as a writer he delivers a mixed hand.  When it's not funny, we find a morbid ventriloquist act done with a corpse, an on-going prostitute brawl, and keys placed on blown off finger stubs.  For all of the funny scenes that do work and a script that does connect, there are tiresome moments that are bloody, but not much else.  For those who look to gangster movies as staple venues, 'Smokin' Aces' should be seen at least once; for those who expect more, wait for a better hand.",2,Overly Stacked Deck,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,1860,"['Unnecessarily', 'intricate', 'sometimes', 'fun', ""'Smokin"", 'Aces', 'uneven', ""'Kill"", 'Bill', 'Shorty', 'Containing', 'big', 'laughs', 'skillful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'nevertheless', 'should', 'stick', 'hand', 'often', 'folds', 'focus', 'plot', 'developed', 'alright', 'other', 'venues', 'come', 'mind', ""'Crank"", 'Fun', 'Departed', 'Twisty', 'Entertaining', ""'Running"", 'Scared', 'Awesomely', 'Wild', 'Fiction', 'Clever', ""'Inside"", 'Man', 'Intelligent', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'satisfying', 'time', 'one', 'end', 'hit', 'miss', 'entertainment', 'show', 'serious', 'history', 'tacked', 'bluffs', 'audience.The', 'story', 'familiar', 'Everyone', 'hired', 'hitmen', 'women', 'F.B.I', 'have', 'stake', 'getting', 'Buddy', ""'Aces"", 'Israel', 'Vegas', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'comic', 'book', 'take', 'real', 'life', ""'d"", 'swear', 'Gotham', 'City', 'had', 'jailbreak', 'Neo-Nazi', 'torturing', 'mobster', 'Russian', 'caretaker', 'Vegas', 'hotel', 'security', 'men', 'are', 'few', 'unsavory', 'figures', 'trying', 'get', 'Israel', 'acting', 'intense', 'cut', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'irresistible', 'tart-talking', 'hit', 'woman', 'Georgia', 'Sykes', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'give', 'urgency', 'F.B.I', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'break', 'out', 'ways', 'unseen', 'before', 'Writer/director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'performance', 'mixed', 'director', 'aces', 'up', 'sleeve', 'writer', 'mixed', 'hand', 'When', 'not', 'funny', 'find', 'morbid', 'ventriloquist', 'act', 'done', 'corpse', 'on-going', 'prostitute', 'brawl', 'keys', 'placed', 'blown', 'off', 'finger', 'stubs', 'funny', 'scenes', 'do', 'work', 'script', 'connect', 'are', 'tiresome', 'moments', 'are', 'bloody', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'who', 'look', 'gangster', 'movies', 'staple', 'venues', ""'Smokin"", 'Aces', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'who', 'expect', 'more', 'wait', 'better', 'hand']",N/A

Friends recommended this to me, and needless to say, they're not my friends anymore.  What a complete mess of a film!This movie rips off so many other movies that it doesn't even know what to do with itself.  So many characters and sub- plots are introduced, that by the twenty minute mark, you're wondering just what it is you're supposed to be focused on. What's important? Who's the main character?  Who am I rooting for?  What the f is going on?!?If a film could benefit from meds, Smokin' Aces is in bad need of Ritalin.  It's hard to say what the movie is ""about,"" since it doesn't seem to be at all concerned with one character more than the next.  The endless, rapid fire cuts and frenetic editing echo a manic and incomprehensible script. This ship has no captain.  And after an hour and 45 minutes, the viewer feels left at sea.Smokin' Aces is a horrible mess of a movie. It switches back and forth between melodrama and inane action sequences, wastes its talent, and wastes your time.  If you're looking for a good caper or gangster movie, look under any other rock you find.It desperately wants to be The Usual Suspects meets Pulp Fiction, but ends up being an unintentional mockery of the genre.

1060370,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B000NTPFK8,alex bushman,"[4, 9]","Joe Carnahan can't be scolded for wanting to make what sounds like a fun idea on paper, after all, the genre he works in is almost expressly for fun and he earns bonus points for including actual human insight at times. He did that in his previous movie, ""Narc"", and he does it again in ""Smokin Aces"" although he does it in a different way. In this film he gives certain characters defining moments and you can feel their life passing before their eyes. He may have given every single character one, but I don't believe every character deserved them, so I didn't consider them defining. What you can scold him for is making a film where those moments are the things that matter the least and at the end nothing of real value has been put in place of that. In lamens terms: this is an unsatisying movie and an action thriller without a payoff.  It doesn't provide a resolution because it wasn't really telling a story to begin with which is where things really turn sour. The scenario is this: a Vegas crime boss wants to off Buddy ""Aces"" Israel because the magician wants to become a mafioso himself. He places a million dollar price tag on his head and many people come after him while Israel stands protected in the suite of a hotel waiting for his agent to make him a deal for testimony to get out of crimes. Jeremy Piven brings a very knowing sense of weariness to the role that is heartbreaking and sad, but nothing is done with his character in the story. Ben Affleck truly makes things start out on a solid narrative foot when he sets up the hit, but Carnahan ruins that (see the movie and find out how).  What happens afterward are a series of subplots given equal space to breath when they should have been cut. Jason Bateman has such a small role and yet he's so interesting to watch unlike others, like Tarajii Henson, who has the most painful performance I've ever had to witness.  She's horrendous, terribly written, and callowly performed. The same is true of Alicia Keys role, although more likable, she's certainly just as useless and fails to provide the kind of weight, or charm that's  be needed. There are characters and subplots in this movie that feel like they're leftovers from another movie and have no place being here: the ritalyn kid and the social worker, the countless hookers, Common's role (even though he is good), the other guy who cleans up the hookers mess, and a number of the monologues by characters are unneccessary.  Why was Matthew Fox chosen for the Hotel security role? I don't know, to maintain surprise  in a movie that lost it in the first 15 minutes. Andy Garcia was a terrible choice for the role of Directing the FBI. As for Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta, only Liotta has the chops to make his role interesting, even though he does nothing. Reynolds is particularly terrible, which is disheartening because I could see him doing a good job if he had been given the chance with a story that gave him something to truly be angry about and kill for. As such, the conclusion is a cop out.Technically, the movie is entertaining on the bargain basement Hollywood level because it feautures neat camerawork and effects.  Carnahan also uses his static tremor sound effect again, as he did in Narc. The problem with using it again is, after you've used it once before, it becomes a standard tool and not something that you're using for the personality of the work. That's a criticism that could be made about Hollywood in general nowadays, that certain genres favor technical freakouts over story content, in this case that just happens to be true, to bad effect. Before I go, I cannot forget the work of the leader of the Tremor brothers, who's the only character in the entire film that's consistently engaging and it's too bad he's stuck in this mess that left me slightly entertained, more disappointed, and definitely perplexed.  If anything, I believe you'll find it interesting so you see it.",2,A terrible film that's the result of a botched attempt.,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,3939,"['Joe', 'Carnahan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'scolded', 'wanting', 'make', 'what', 'fun', 'idea', 'paper', 'genre', 'almost', 'expressly', 'fun', 'bonus', 'points', 'including', 'actual', 'human', 'insight', 'times', 'did', 'previous', 'movie', 'Narc', 'again', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'different', 'way', 'film', 'certain', 'characters', 'defining', 'moments', 'can', 'feel', 'life', 'passing', 'eyes', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'single', 'character', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'character', 'deserved', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'defining', 'What', 'can', 'scold', 'making', 'film', 'where', 'moments', 'are', 'things', 'matter', 'least', 'end', 'nothing', 'real', 'value', 'been', 'put', 'place', 'lamens', 'terms', 'unsatisying', 'movie', 'action', 'thriller', 'payoff', ""n't"", 'provide', 'resolution', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'telling', 'story', 'begin', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'turn', 'sour', 'scenario', 'Vegas', 'crime', 'boss', 'off', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'magician', 'become', 'mafioso', 'million', 'dollar', 'price', 'tag', 'head', 'many', 'people', 'come', 'Israel', 'protected', 'suite', 'hotel', 'waiting', 'agent', 'make', 'deal', 'testimony', 'get', 'crimes', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'very', 'knowing', 'sense', 'weariness', 'role', 'heartbreaking', 'sad', 'nothing', 'done', 'character', 'story', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'truly', 'things', 'start', 'out', 'solid', 'narrative', 'foot', 'when', 'up', 'hit', 'Carnahan', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'What', 'afterward', 'are', 'series', 'subplots', 'given', 'equal', 'space', 'breath', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'small', 'role', 'yet', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', 'others', 'Tarajii', 'Henson', 'who', 'most', 'painful', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'witness', 'horrendous', 'terribly', 'written', 'callowly', 'performed', 'same', 'true', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'role', 'more', 'likable', 'certainly', 'just', 'useless', 'provide', 'kind', 'weight', 'charm', 'be', 'needed', 'are', 'characters', 'subplots', 'movie', 'feel', ""'re"", 'leftovers', 'movie', 'have', 'place', 'being', 'here', 'ritalyn', 'kid', 'social', 'worker', 'countless', 'hookers', 'Common', 'role', 'even', 'good', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'hookers', 'mess', 'number', 'monologues', 'characters', 'are', 'unneccessary', 'Why', 'was', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'chosen', 'Hotel', 'security', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maintain', 'surprise', 'movie', 'lost', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'was', 'terrible', 'choice', 'role', 'Directing', 'FBI', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'only', 'Liotta', 'chops', 'make', 'role', 'interesting', 'even', 'nothing', 'Reynolds', 'particularly', 'terrible', 'disheartening', 'could', 'see', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'story', 'gave', 'something', 'truly', 'be', 'angry', 'kill', 'such', 'conclusion', 'cop', 'out.Technically', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'bargain', 'basement', 'Hollywood', 'level', 'neat', 'camerawork', 'effects', 'Carnahan', 'also', 'static', 'tremor', 'sound', 'effect', 'again', 'did', 'Narc', 'problem', 'using', 'again', ""'ve"", 'used', 'once', 'standard', 'tool', 'not', 'something', ""'re"", 'using', 'personality', 'work', 'criticism', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'general', 'nowadays', 'certain', 'genres', 'favor', 'technical', 'freakouts', 'story', 'content', 'case', 'just', 'be', 'true', 'bad', 'effect', 'go', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'work', 'leader', 'Tremor', 'brothers', 'who', 'only', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'consistently', 'engaging', 'too', 'bad', 'stuck', 'mess', 'left', 'slightly', 'entertained', 'more', 'disappointed', 'definitely', 'perplexed', 'anything', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting', 'so', 'see']",N/A

The writing was superb, the visuals were mesmerizing and the nods to other genre movies made watching them over and over again fresh and fun.This movie did not have a well written script and it showed.

Maybe it has some funny segments (such as the kung fu fighter striking near a guys face, and another segment involving a guy playing with a dead guys face) but overall, these funny segments just make it harder to take the action parts seriously, and it wasn't good enough of a movie overall to take seriously in the first place.

Sexy ladies, blood splatter, guns a-blazing, and action sequences galore.But it's also much more than that. Jeremy Piven isn't really known as a lead actor. His drug-addled yet funny portrayal inGrosse Pointe Blank(beside lead actor John Cusack) cemented him as a powerfully funny if somewhat despicable character, and this is something he uses to great advantage in SMOKIN' ACES.The story is that of Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Piven), a Vegas magician turned mobster who's out to get as much recognition and cash as he can and be damned the consequences. But when a hit is put out on him -- and he learns of it -- Buddy turns to the Feds for a deal; he plans to tell all of what he knows regarding mob business in Nevada before someone rips his heart out (both figuratively and literally).Enter agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta,Wild Hogs), two G-men assigned to protect Buddy and take him out of his Lake Tahoe safe-haven and into protective custody.In the meantime, the contract on Buddy's life has gotten great notice by those in the rub-out business (the price tag on Buddy's head is $1 million). A trio of demented and toothless brothers with a penchant for bloody ends, a master of disguise, two sexy ladies with some powerful guns, and even an unfortunate bounty hunter (played by Ben Affleck,Hollywoodland) get involved to no good ends.Eventually the deal with Buddy falls through, and the FBI renigs on its offer of protection, leaving Buddy wide-open to his newfound enemies. Unbeknownst to our two G-men, they come into Buddy's hotel with some hitmen (and women) in front and behind them. Blood is sure to fly, and it does with little remorse and plenty of abandon.The big question is why did the FBI pull out its offer of protection. Old FBI plans and super-duper secret undercover cases come boiling back and threaten to spill over onto everyone's lap, especially onto Messner's who has to deal with the death of someone close to him and the possibility of corruption from within the very department he's dedicated his life to.It is Jeremy Piven's who carries a large part of Smokin' Aces. His sexually depraved and drug sniffing personae was spot-on and made watchers both love and loathe him in the same breath.

YesSmokin' Aces is the second most appropriately violent movie, next to Clockwork Orange. Written and Directed by Joe Carnahan, Smokin' Aces is the complicated story of a second-rate magician with a large bounty apparently on his head for selling out his crime lord friends to the FBI. The cast is great, Jeremy Piven, Andy Garcia and the brutally sexy Alicia Keys - who by the way has some great legs (I did not know this). It is an entertaining movie you will think in some respects was directed by Quenten Tarantino - but wasn't. It falls just short of Resservoir Dogs and Fight Club in terms of script and direction, but fits perfectly next to those movies on your shelf, if organized by Genre and then quality. Maybe you go alpha, I don't know, my system is kind of random ... like this post.As for the HD quality - It looks like this film was made for an HD picture. The shots were great and when necessary, large in scope. Jeremy Piven's character gets put through the wringer in this movie and the close-ups of his face truly revealed how stressed this character was. Adding to the effect was the detail that HD allows. I cannot see this deatil in an SD format. Similarly, Alicia Keys' thighs looked really good in HD - rawr. Ultimately, Being a bloodbath, this movie needed the details that a high resolution picture allows. At certain times my wife had to turn her head away from the carnage. I have never seen her do that before, and I doubt an SD picture would have the same effect. Ultimately, this was one of the best non-effects based HD DVDs I think I have ever seen. That said, as I watch more and more HD DVD, I find myself looking for effects based movies. Regardless, this picture is great - thank goodness its a Universal HD DVD.As for the audio: spot on as our friends across the pond would say. Seriously spot on. Crime dramas can be very effectively mastered in HD audio, like Smokin' Aces and Miami Vice. The audio mix added to the environment and was very well mastered.Amazingly, this HD DVD had a very cool menu animation and employed U-Control. U-Control is Universal's use of HDi to display extra film information in a Picture-in-Picture format - a feature that is lacking on Pre-Profile 2.0 Blu-ray players. So far the implementation has been spotty. I can, however, attest that the U-Control feature in this HD DVD is awesome, providing information otherwise found by using IMDB and the `internets'. After experiencing this U-control HD DVD, I re-watched Miami Vice paying special attention to the U-Control features. It really is a new movie experience; one exclusive to HD DVD.Enjoy.",4,Smokin' Hot,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2652,"['Sum', 'Smokin', 'HotShould', 'Buy', 'YesSmokin', 'Aces', 'second', 'most', 'appropriately', 'violent', 'movie', 'next', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'complicated', 'story', 'second-rate', 'magician', 'large', 'bounty', 'apparently', 'head', 'selling', 'out', 'crime', 'lord', 'FBI', 'cast', 'great', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'brutally', 'sexy', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'who', 'way', 'great', 'legs', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'think', 'respects', 'was', 'directed', 'Quenten', 'Tarantino', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'short', 'Resservoir', 'Dogs', 'Fight', 'Club', 'terms', 'script', 'direction', 'perfectly', 'next', 'movies', 'shelf', 'organized', 'Genre', 'then', 'quality', 'Maybe', 'go', 'alpha', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'system', 'kind', 'random', 'post.As', 'HD', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'HD', 'picture', 'shots', 'were', 'great', 'when', 'necessary', 'large', 'scope', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'character', 'put', 'wringer', 'movie', 'close-ups', 'face', 'truly', 'revealed', 'how', 'stressed', 'character', 'was', 'Adding', 'effect', 'was', 'detail', 'HD', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'deatil', 'SD', 'format', 'Similarly', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'thighs', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'HD', 'rawr', 'Ultimately', 'Being', 'bloodbath', 'movie', 'needed', 'details', 'high', 'resolution', 'picture', 'certain', 'times', 'wife', 'had', 'turn', 'head', 'away', 'carnage', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'doubt', 'SD', 'picture', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'non-effects', 'based', 'HD', 'DVDs', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'watch', 'more', 'more', 'HD', 'DVD', 'find', 'looking', 'effects', 'based', 'movies', 'Regardless', 'picture', 'great', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Universal', 'HD', 'DVD.As', 'audio', 'spot', 'friends', 'pond', 'would', 'say', 'Seriously', 'spot', 'Crime', 'dramas', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'effectively', 'mastered', 'HD', 'audio', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'audio', 'mix', 'added', 'environment', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'mastered.Amazingly', 'HD', 'DVD', 'had', 'very', 'cool', 'menu', 'animation', 'employed', 'U-Control', 'U-Control', 'Universal', 'use', 'HDi', 'display', 'extra', 'film', 'information', 'Picture-in-Picture', 'format', 'feature', 'lacking', 'Pre-Profile', '2.0', 'Blu-ray', 'players', 'So', 'far', 'implementation', 'been', 'spotty', 'can', 'however', 'attest', 'U-Control', 'feature', 'HD', 'DVD', 'awesome', 'providing', 'information', 'otherwise', 'found', 'using', 'IMDB', 'internets', 'experiencing', 'U-control', 'HD', 'DVD', 're-watched', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'paying', 'special', 'attention', 'U-Control', 'features', 'really', 'new', 'movie', 'experience', 'one', 'exclusive', 'HD', 'DVD.Enjoy']",N/A
1060395,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000NTPFK8,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Too often I see a film that just simply tries too hard. It's as if the filmmakers meant for the film to be historic and gripping and touching and in the end it just turns out completely laughable. I found it funny the filmmakers of Hostel used the film as a political statement about Americans backpacking through Europe and the dangers that can happen when it's just basically half lame-softcore movie/snuff film. Armageddon wanted to be a big rousing epic but it was just bad period. Smokin' Aces is a film directed by guys intended mainly for guys: it's got swears, tons of characters, action and drugs and you walk in expecting that, you'll find that's what you get, for better or worse.Jeremy Piven plays Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a Las Vegas magician/showman who is a wannabe looking to get into the Mob world. When he gets a little bit too popular and divides the mob family and is willing to testify against them, a hit is put out on him with the added incentive that the boss Primo Sparazza wants his heart and whoever gets him will get one million dollars. This leaves FBI Agents Messner and Carruthers (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta) having to bring Israel into protective custody since Israel's held up in the penthouse suite of a hotel. Of course that million dollars is tempting, catching the attention of several assassins including female duo Georgia and Sharice (Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson), Soot (Tommy Flanagan) and a trio of guys hired by a lawyer (Ben Affleck, Peter Berg, Martin Henderson, Justin Bateman).It's quite an impressive cast and there's a couple of standouts including Reynolds, Piven and Bateman as a hilarious oddball of a lawyer. And yes I said Alicia Keys and she actually does a pretty good job. Doubt anyone would give her an acting job but when you consider a lot of musicians doing bad acting jobs with only the rarity happening (Bjork in Dancer in the Dark). Some characters are just strange to a gangsta wannabe who's all of 12 and a cameo by Lost's Michael Fox is too short.As for the other characters, they're not really all that gripping since we either don't spend enough time with them or they're just not that interesting to begin with.If there is a fault, it's that the film presents itself in a way as being a kind of energetic Reservoir Dogs or a more better version of Running Scared. The thing is the film's very dialogue-heavy and despite the on-screen character introductions, it's hard to keep track of what everyone's name is and hope somebody mentions it so they can remind me. There's a climactic shootout akin to the one in True Romance (oddly another Tarentino-written film) that feels disappointingly short and should've had more to the scene. It's not a bad film but it's one of those films where there's usually a great film buried underneath.Let's face it: critics hated this but that's beside the point. There will probably be someone who just absolutely loves it, someone who hates it and me who thought despite its flaws, it was kinda...fun.",4,Does exactly what it wants to be,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3007,"['Too', 'often', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'simply', 'too', 'hard', 'filmmakers', 'meant', 'film', 'be', 'historic', 'gripping', 'touching', 'end', 'just', 'out', 'completely', 'laughable', 'found', 'filmmakers', 'Hostel', 'used', 'film', 'political', 'statement', 'Americans', 'backpacking', 'Europe', 'dangers', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'just', 'basically', 'half', 'lame-softcore', 'movie/snuff', 'film', 'Armageddon', 'wanted', 'be', 'big', 'rousing', 'epic', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'period', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'film', 'directed', 'guys', 'intended', 'mainly', 'guys', 'got', 'swears', 'tons', 'characters', 'action', 'drugs', 'walk', 'expecting', ""'ll"", 'find', 'what', 'get', 'better', 'worse.Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'magician/showman', 'who', 'wannabe', 'looking', 'get', 'Mob', 'world', 'When', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'popular', 'mob', 'family', 'willing', 'testify', 'hit', 'put', 'out', 'added', 'incentive', 'boss', 'Primo', 'Sparazza', 'heart', 'will', 'get', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'FBI', 'Agents', 'Messner', 'Carruthers', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'having', 'bring', 'Israel', 'protective', 'custody', 'Israel', 'held', 'up', 'penthouse', 'suite', 'hotel', 'course', 'million', 'dollars', 'tempting', 'catching', 'attention', 'several', 'assassins', 'including', 'female', 'duo', 'Georgia', 'Sharice', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'Soot', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', 'trio', 'guys', 'hired', 'lawyer', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'Justin', 'Bateman', '.It', 'impressive', 'cast', 'couple', 'standouts', 'including', 'Reynolds', 'Piven', 'Bateman', 'hilarious', 'oddball', 'lawyer', 'yes', 'said', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'give', 'acting', 'job', 'when', 'consider', 'lot', 'musicians', 'doing', 'bad', 'acting', 'jobs', 'only', 'rarity', 'happening', 'Bjork', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'strange', 'gangsta', 'wannabe', 'who', '12', 'cameo', 'Lost', 'Michael', 'Fox', 'too', 'short.As', 'other', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'gripping', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'begin', 'with.If', 'fault', 'film', 'way', 'being', 'kind', 'energetic', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'more', 'better', 'version', 'Running', 'Scared', 'thing', 'film', 'very', 'dialogue-heavy', 'on-screen', 'character', 'introductions', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'everyone', 'name', 'hope', 'somebody', 'mentions', 'can', 'remind', 'climactic', 'shootout', 'akin', 'one', 'True', 'Romance', 'oddly', 'Tarentino-written', 'film', 'disappointingly', 'short', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'scene', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'usually', 'great', 'film', 'buried', 'underneath.Let', 'face', 'critics', 'hated', 'beside', 'point', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'absolutely', 'someone', 'who', 'who', 'thought', 'flaws', 'was', 'kinda', 'fun']",N/A

You will find virtually no character development. The actors all did their best, but they had very little to work with. I wonder how many viewers cared about what happened to Buddy Israel, portrayed by Jeremy Pivin. Israel was a star Vegas illusionist. (Surprisingly, there's very little about his performance skills here.) Israel has close ties to the mob, and took part in mob capers. He knows a lot, and is willing to inform on his mob associates to evade prosecution himself. The FBI offers him protection in exchange for his testimony that will apparently deal a mortal blow to organized crime, or something like that.There's a million dollar contract out. Motley crews of assassins make their way to Lake Tahoe, where Israel holes up.  Of course, similar tales have been told on the big screen with great skill. But the only strong thing I saw about this was the cinematography: the shots stayed in focus as the story line got more and more blurry. I had no empathy for any of the characters. The good guys were flat; the bad guys seemed to be amoral cartoon figures. The victims seemed to just be hapless, in the wrong place at the wrong time.

There is so much intense and unpredictable violence, I found it both mind-numbing and, at times, quite annoying. I had to frequently look away from the numerous brain splattering scenes because I find them disturbing - not cathartic, like most filmgoers do. This is a picture that relishes so much violent sudden death - there comes a point when you want to yell out to the filmmakers: ""enough all ready!""But aside from the rivers of blood, what I found most troubling about this movie is when two of the  genuinely decent characters - one an FBI agent, the other a bounty hunter - commits cold blooded murder out of  revenge. One with great sorrow, the other because he feels like a sucker.  When the good guys commit murder the message to the audience is that murder for revenge's sake is justifiable. Life is cheap. I find that quite troubling.Also the ending of the movie makes absolutely no sense, which is never a good sign! Why would the FBI Agent essentially throw his life away? At least he's a trained professional! Did it ever cross his mind to pick-up the phone and call someone in the Justice Department for help, like the Attorney General; or simply contact a large city newspaper, like the New York Times? His hopelessness is truly pathetic and ridiculous!Is there anyone in this movie who is not absolutely crazy or foolhardy?

1060406,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000NTPFK8,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[3, 7]","The preview for 'Smokin' Aces' was so kinetic and filled with energy that it almost convinced you that if you didn't see the movie, you would most likely be shunned by society. And that techno tempo was pretty cool, too. That is why it pains me so much to say that the movie is suprisingly mediocre. It got four stars only for the acting, which everyone does great with, even Ryan Reynolds. The action is two star level, and the story is...well, the plot is literally explained to you in the opening scene. For such a violent movie, it sure skimps in the second half. With the introduction of a huge sniper rifle, you expect some kind of, I don't know, moral obligation to show someone getting shot. Like, devote screentime to it. Instead, all we see is arcs of slashing blood and people being tossed through the air like rag dolls. The maximum amount of destruction we get from that scene is exploding windows.The action is very dissapointing. The preview looked insane, to the point of tiresome, but 'Smokin' Aces' never delivers. The final big shootout is boring. A bunch of cops shooting randomly around a room, while they are picked off one by one by an unseen sniper is not interesting. At all. There is no action scene in this movie where people fire back and forth at each other, except for one, very short one, and therefore a lot of the movie is people shooting at people they can't see that are hidden somewhere. A scene with a chainsaw isn't even as bloody as it could have been. Although director-writer Joe Carnahan relishes shots of people getting their stomachs sliced open, it is suprisingly gore free. There is one great scene, in an elevator, where two people all but obliterate each other. It's the best sequence in the movie, and it clocks in at just thirty seconds.The movie also has serious tonal issues. It starts as a somber FBI movie, then becomes a comedy, with Ben Affleck setting up the backstory of Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, the man on which a hit has been ordered, which brings a slew of assassins to his Tahoe penthouse. Then, it takes a turn for the gruesome. In an unneeded few scenes, we watch as a man bites the tips of his fingers off, as a man fries another mans testicles off, and as a man blowtorches a guys eye out of his head. Then we're back at comedy, with a hilarious scene with Jeremy Piven (as Israel, channeling, as best he can, his Ari Gold character from 'Entourage.') And then, after so many promising scenes, the movie becomes a confusing, convoluted action movie, with one bit of violence following the other, as if a competition has begun, with each scene of misogynistic, often unrelenting, but boring, violence saying to one another ""I can outdo you.""As i said before, the acting is the best thing in the movie. Piven is great as Israel, and although he never evokes pity, he makes you want to slap him out of it. Piven has a long scene in the middle of the movie with rapper Common, who plays his bodyguard. The scene is good, but feels like it's in a different movie. Perhaps a druggie redemption story movie. Ray Liotta, as FBI Agent Carruthers, and Ryan Reynolds, as FBI Agent Messner, are both very good. They have a kind of weird father-son bond, even though most of their scenes are not together. Reynolds, it seems, may have finally departed from the ""dick in the mashed potatoes"" humor of his previous movies (that's right, 'Waiting...', I just called you out.) He has done some good stuff, like 'Just Friends', which was actually pretty damn funny, but he has done his share of crap as well. In his role here, Reynolds takes control and commands the screen with an almost frightening presence. Andy Garcia appears in a cameo, as the FBI boss of Carruthers and Messner, but in his scenes his acting is stilted and his accent flip flops like Liam Neeson trying to do an American accent. Alisha Keys is alright as an assassin, but Taraji Henson is better as her lesbian partner, even though she spends a huge section of the movie in a hotel room with a gun.Another unfortuate downside to 'Smokin' Aces' is the fact that it leaves so many plot points left open. Characters, literally, no joke, walk into a crowd and are not seen again. Another character is cut off midsentance and not seen again. Another character may or may not be dead. The movie spends an innapropriate amount of time on a plot point seemingly not related to the main plot, seemingly just to create a twist ending. The movie was good without a twisty, convoluted ending. But this day in age, when everyone in a movie needs to be two people, and the killer also has to be the main character, Carnahan decided at the last minute that this movie needed a suprise ending. I say ""last minute"" because the twist is so tacked on that if I was to nail a 2X4 to my rear end, it would be less tacked on than the ending. This is one of those movies where the real secret occurs to a character through a montage of scenes that make no sense. A character eating some cereal, a guy with a chainsaw, a guy getting shot in the face. According to Ryan Reynolds, that spells scam. As not to give away the ending, I won't go any further, but I will say that the twist is so incredibly tacked on that Carnahan actually has nowhere to go afterwards. The movie just ends.Despite what I have said, this is a good movie. Style over substance is not always good, but in this case it works. Watching FBI agents getting flung around a hotel room like rag dolls has never been so entertaining, and watching a neo-Nazi slice a guy open with a chainsaw has never seemed so light. While Carnahan's stylization never reaches the level of stylization that it wants to (one of 'Snatch' or any Guy Ritchie movie really), it still works. In the words of ""Beanie"" (the actor who introduced our screening) the movie has speeds. It starts slow, speeds up, slows down, and goes hyper speed. While it never felt slow in the beginning, the fast part in the middle he refers to is literally fast. The camera slides all over the place, taking in nothing but the dialogue in the background. It drags in the middle, and while the climax feels like something greater is coming, after we leave the screening, it does in fact feel like ""hyper speed.""Now, do keep in mind, I saw an advance screening of this movie, so some of the loose ends may be cleared up, but I saw it on Tuesday January 23, three days before it came out in theaters, so don't expect too many drastic changes. For the most part, people in the theater were suprised it ended so soon. At nearly two hours, the movie zooms by like barely an hour an a half, and I swear to God it took me a week to convince myself they hadn't skipped a reel. In terms of an action movie, there isn't much action. This is a character comedy, a dark one, with a shootout at the end to wrap it all up. In all honesty, no joke (I clocked it) the 'Miami Vice' remake had more action.Director: Joe CarnahanWriter: Joe CarnahanStarring: Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman, Common, Taraji Henson, Alisha Keys, Ray

I feel much better.Other than that, I had an absolute blast watching director Joe Carnahan's gruesome shoot-'em-up, SMOKIN' ACES.  This flick puts an extra shade into dark comedy; I found myself laughing one moment, then cringing at over-the-top violence and gore the next.  Yet in a movie that doesn't, not for one second, take itself seriously, over-the-top is a good thing.  This bizarro race of professional killers to be the first to rub out an informant--and claim a hefty paycheck--delivers action with an exclamation point.  It's fast-paced and fun to watch, a rollercoaster ride without all the dizziness.With the exception of Reynolds, the ensemble cast is hard core entertaining.  Ben Affleck's role as a bail bondsman trying to get in on the action is surprisingly small; Chris Pine as the front man of three very degenerate brothers is hilarious; Alicia Keys is smokin' hot.  Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia are solid; Jason Bateman in a very small (but interesting) role is hysterical.  Yet Jeremy Piven, the Las Vegas entertainer turned FBI informant, steals the show.  With a grand legion of personal issues, augmented by the realization he could be killed at any moment, Piven's character devolves into meltdown mode in a manner that is fascinating to watch.SMOKIN' ACES is brutal and gory and disturbing; it's not for your aunt who does needlework on Wednesdays.

You would think that, to attract a cast like that, the script must be pretty damn good, wouldn't you?. However, it isn't. In fact, ""Smoking Aces"" has one of the worst scripts that I have ever seen.The film opens with 17 and a half minutes of exposition (that is, 17 and a half minutes of people sitting around and explaining who the different characters are and what they are doing), which put my father to sleep and just left me confused, and then follows it with another 90 minutes of incoherent rubbish. Some of the action sequences are well done and interesting to watch, but they are more or less randomly inserted in the film. In many cases, I couldn't even understand what the characters were saying and I found myself drawn to Ryan Reynolds's character, simply because he was one of the few comprehensible actors in the entire film. I could excuse much of this in a piece of direct-to-DVD rubbish, but in a film that got an international cinema release, it is unforgivable, and I wonder how Joe Carnaghan (the writer and director) managed to convince so many top actors to appear in this mess.After watching this film, I swore that I would never watch another Joe Carnaghan film ever again.

Writer/Director Joe Carnahan has style and the film's similarity to the many other cop/mob caper movies is evident, but Carnahan like to blitz the eye of the viewer with so much visual information (multiple tracks, quick scene flashes, unexplained flashbacks, etc) that when coupled with a soundtrack that is burdened with overlapping voices and very loud 'music' makes the story confusing.The last remnant of the Mafia lies in Las Vegas, and the FBI, various gangs, and detectives are out to either court the supposed willing informer, lounge comedian Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven), or kill him before he squeals his apparent vital information.  Israel is hiding out in Tahoe in a penthouse papered with drugs, prostitutes, bodyguards,  and pursing him are hired assassins, cops, FBI agents, and competing mobs.  In the course of the film nearly everyone gets shot, tortured, killed, or maimed and the blood and set destruction are a primary ingredients.  The large cast includes Ben Affleck (in a very quick role), Ryan Reynolds (who is actually the star), Andy Garcia, Jason Bateman, Alicia Keys, Ray Liotta, Peter Berg, Martin Henderson, Davenia McFadden, Loretta Wyman, Nestor Carbonell, Joel Edgerton and a host of others who parade by or die so quickly that their character names are difficult to remember.The script has moments of crude comedy, a lot of toilet talk, and an ending that tries to make the entire ride meaningful.  It is worth a watch for the pyrotechnics of camera and sound work (and if the viewer has a high tolerance for violence), but renting it first to test your taste is advisable.

Only Tarantino fans will know the difference.""Smokin' Aces"" is the story of Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) who is a popular Las Vegas card magician, but unfortunately gets involved with the mafia. However, with his newfound talent--especially outside the center stage--he becomes a major problem for this fearful organization.Meanwhile, two FBI agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta) are staking the house of mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). They listen to his telephone conversation and find out that Sparazza has put out a one-million dollar reward on Israel's life. Now, the whole thing turns into a mad rat race between the mafia (their retro assassins), FBI (their agents), and the lawyer (with his bondsmen) who will do everything within their means to track down Israel first.

Now, the whole thing turns into a mad rat race between the mafia (their retro assassins), FBI (their agents), and the lawyer (with his bondsmen) who will do everything within their means to track down Israel first. Who will get Israel first?When we looked at the cast and saw actors such as Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta, and even Ben Affleck, we expected this movie to be along the lines of Las Vegas Ocean's eleven (George Clooney, Brad Pitt), and Ocean Twelve (Julia Roberts, George Clooney). Here we have another movie with a lot of star power, but probably no punch. We were quite surprised because this movie delivered the goods.""Smokin' Aces"" made us believe that we were watching another Tarantino (over use of talkative dialog, over the top action scenes, and characters), and Tony Scott (his use of flashy cinematography), and because of these elements the movie moves along quite nicely. What we liked the most about this film were the assassins who were very colorful and fun to watch--almost like watching ""Get Smart"" villains and wrestlers from the 80's--they were silly yet entertaining. Another high point of the film is how well acted it was--especially Jeremy Piven who gave us a good performance.What we disliked about the film was the lack of a strong story and character development. We should have seen more background information on Israel who is the main character. Carnahan could have used more flashbacks to develop his complex personality--much like Tarantino did in his ""Kill Bill"" movies.Originality is a low point in this film. We are so tired and probably most of the world is when it comes mimicking other directors. Carnahan would have probably been better off if he stayed with the themes of his earlier movies like Blood, Guts, Bullets, and Octane and Narc.The Verdict:Fans of ""over the top"" Action films like ""Smokin' Aces"" are not going to care much about character development--neither the irrelevant ""twist"" at the end.

1060417,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000NTPFK8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Oh, Tarantino, what have you wrought? Ever sincePulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)crime cinema has never been quite the same. PULP FICTION was so clever and dynamic and just so plain cool that, of course, it was bound to garner imitators and pretenders, all striving for that same flavor. Some of these are even pretty nifty (Snatch (Special Edition),Get Shorty (Two-Disc Special Edition),Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (Locked 'N Loaded Director's Cut), etc.). And then there's a film like SMOKIN' ACES, which doesn't boast the same quality of nift.For decades the FBI had been gradually whittling down the Mafia. This time the agency has a chance to take out a prominent capo. This, thanks to Vegas illusionist Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven, of ENTOURAGE), a key witness willing to roll over on his mob connections. But word of this can't help but get out, and, so, the vengeful mob ends up putting a million dollar contract on Aces (with the added caveat that Aces's heart be delivered as proof of the deed). Aces and his entourage are secretly holed up at a penthouse in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, a ritzy place which soon gets overrun by an assortment of contract killers, bounty hunters, and just plain scuzzbucket lowlifes. And, somewhere in this, a mysterious Swede fits into the puzzle. Trying desperately to stay on top of it all are two FBI agents (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta). They end up not doing a good job.Actually, I'm a bit torn with this one. On one hand SMOKIN' ACES is not that good of a movie. On the other hand, it's stylish and does exude a certain cool vibe. Plus, we get to see several lower-tiered movie stars riffing and taking it easy in this ensemble cast. Jeremy Piven is very good as Aces Israel, love him or hate him. I thought Aces, poor tortured soul that he is, was an overbearing jerk, but that's just proof in the pudding regarding Piven's performance, which might not be endearing but will draw a reaction from you. In a roster of ne'er-do-wells, there are only two people I rooted for: Ryan Reynold's FBI guy and Alicia Keys's sexy assassin. But, then again, I pretty much root for Reynolds in every film he's in, and SMOKIN' ACES is worth watching just for the chance to ogle Keys strolling around in hooker boots. There's also a brief but standout scene with Jason Bateman as a weird, drunk lawyer. The action sequences, once the film gets around to 'em, are wild and frenetic, with the suspense factor kicking in as, with these kinds of films, you never really know who's gonna make it out alive. So, these are the movie's good points.I did say that SMOKIN' ACES exudes style and a cool vibe. But the thing is, sooner or later (and probably sooner), it'll hit the viewer that there's not much substance beneath the splash and glitter. Turns out, it really is all just smoke and mirrors. One wonders how much more effective SMOKIN' ACES would've been if done as a short film. As it is, it feels too drawn out. Much of the film is plodding in pace as it focuses on introducing and then tracking the preparations and movements of the various degenerates out to collect the murder sweepstakes. In the final half hour or so, all the players finally converge and clash in a series of amped-up firefights. And, yup, the ensuing bloodbaths and gunplays are worth watching. But the film is then even further sabotaged by the weak resolution. And the characters I was rooting for...well, they could've done more. Instead the end credits elicit an empty ""Is that it?"" sensation. I really hate that sensation.More negatives? As in PULP FICTION there are moments here when the characters indulge in seemingly throwaway, off-the-cuff dialogue. Only here it isn't as well done, not as memorable or catchy. I could almost feel the beads of trying-too-hard sweating off the screen. There's a twist near the end of the flick which isn't as clever or as slick as the writer seems to think it is. For a ""gotcha"" moment, all it did was make me shrug. Another quibble has to do with Alicia Keys. I'm glad she tried her hand at acting and she's definitely got ""it."" She plays a contract killer here, and I wish she'd gone into action more. In particular I wish she'd taken on the crazy Tremor brothers (her pointing a gun at the head neo-Nazi doesn't count). Her character is one instance where the actuality doesn't live up to the hype. And, finally, I really, really hated that annoying kid with the boner.A bit torn on this one and flippin' a coin. In the end, I say there's enough curious bits in SMOKIN' ACES to make it worth watching once, despite its flaws. There are some redeeming stuff here, as with the performances of Piven, Alicia Keys, Ryan Reynolds, and Jason Bateman. Also, I got a kick out of Andy Garcia's Southern boy Foghorn Leghorn accent. And for some reason I couldn't stop giggling when Ben Affleck's bail bondsman toppled over.",3,Five words  -  Alicia Keys in hooker boots,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,4885,"['Oh', 'Tarantino',

1060420,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B000NTPFK8,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","Ahh Smokin' Aces, one of those movies that objectively isn't good but still entertaining enough for me to watch each year since it came out. The story isn't as deep/complex as it pretends to be (especially within the last 10 minutes of squeezed in plot), but it still keeps you hooked with it's fast pacing and multiple POVs.Basically the story is a Vegas magician Buddy Israel (illusions, Michael) is marked by a wide assortment of killers who all converge in the hotel he's staying at trying to reach him. Most of them are hired assassins with various methods of attack, from the neo-nazi tremor brothers who'll shoot up an entire diner to kill one target to the low-profile Lazlo Soot who is a master of disguise. While all this chaos is going on the FBI is trying to protect Buddy from the mercenaries.Despite taking itself seriously near the end, the film doesn't for most of the film, making Smokin' Aces a wild live-action cartoon featuring characters simply doing what they do. The film aims for one simple goal: fun, and it has that in spades. I mean with a story like this, where you throw a ton of colorful assassins in a blender, how can it not be? This movie is also overflowing with style, nearly every shot is lushly saturated and shot at interesting angles. Basically to sum up what I really admire about this film is that while flawed, it's always doing it's darnedest to keep you entertained.Also what's uncommon about this film is when the killers start running into each other and chaos ensues, it all takes about 10 minutes in real time, but the movie shows different perspectives of the action stretching it out. This was a nice way of showing where all of the pieces are in the middle of the chaos.

1060423,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000NTPFK8,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","Writer/director Joe Carnahan takes a note from Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott in Smokin' Aces, a gleefully violent, nihilistic, sexist romp. Carnahan isn't trying to say anything, he just wants to make a slammin' guy flick with lots of shooting and explosions. To this effect, the plot is secondary; all that matters is this elaborate situation he sets up where an army of bounty hunters all descend upon Lake Tahoe to try to get the bounty on Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven,). The action moves quickly enough that Smokin' Aces seems enjoyable during the viewing, but afterwards people realize how empty is actually is. Smokin' Aces, sadly, is also predictable. Carnahan (Narc) has his own little twist up his sleeve, but for some strange reason, gives most of it away in a few flashbacks that reveal too much. There is little time for character development of any sort. What he does do is a quick montage at the beginning bringing everybody up to speed with Israel's situation, with the different groups of bounty hunters preparing for the job.The characters are indeed diverse and over the top, starting with: Ben Affleck as a bail bondsman, his two friends who are ex-cops, Bateman as a sleazy lawyer, Georgia Sykes (Keys) and Sharrice Watters (Henson),  as the two femme fatals, three insane Nazi like guys known as The Tremors, a torturer who doesn't torture anyone in the film, a man who changes identity and masks, Buddy Piven Israel and his crew, Reynolds( Richard Messner)  and Liotta (Donald Carruthers)  as the two FBI agents and their superior Garcia. Seems like a lot of people and it is, but you won't get confused as to who's who at any point. Piven plays his usual fast talking dirt bag character, only this time he has a few card tricks to flash the audience.If I were to cut out some characters, the film could do without the kid and his granny, along with Israel's manager/lawyer. Instead give that screen time to more action. There I said it; the film could use a little bit more action. It does showcase enough violence to please the usual film goer, but I couldn't help but want a little bit more by the time the film was over.  Aside from that, everyone in the film does a good job with their characters and it was nice to spot those familiar faces in the cast, such as Matthew Fox from ""Lost fame"" and the one hit-man who people will recognize from ""Suddenly Susan."" While the comedy doesn't really last throughout the entire film, it's Bateman who steals the comedy with his sleazy lawyer role. He delivers every line with comedy gold. Common impressed me with his role as Piven's right hand man and I'm hoping he continues on with that direction. Reynolds is the real standout in the entire cast and works well with Liotta. Smokin' Aces is a haphazard attempt to cash in on a genre that comes and goes in popularity. Whenever Quentin Tarantino redefines it, it's popular. Otherwise, it was close to damaged goods. It's just a shame that a talent like Carnahan had to fall under its spell, only to dish out to something mildly entertaining but I still give this director an E for Effort.",3,"[3.5]--""You want a piece of me?

Basically what we have here is an empty, hollow flim with a miniscule plot.Really though,Smokin' Aces is a huge rip off of other films that were made long ago,and done 100 times better such as Resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock and two Smoking Barels and Snatch to name a few. None of the characters were interesting in the least bit and I was astonished that Ray Liotta, Ryan Renolds, Ben Affleck and Alisha Keys(I think that's who it was?) agreed to do this film.If I were them(if we could switch identities for a day) I would have fired my agent for even offering this piece of gragage to me.

The story line comes off as a backdrop for the multitude of good and great performances.Taraji Henson delivers a character role that deserves an award. As Sharice Watters, a hit-woman, she belts out dialogue with panache, worth the DVD viewing time, alone. I was reminded of Mercedes Ruell, as Anne Napolitano, in The Fisher King; a role that won Ms. Ruell an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1991. It would make sense to me that Ms. Henson would be nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in her 2008 role of Queenie, in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This woman can act!Not all the characters fit the bill: Ryan Reynolds, as Richard Messner, FBI agent, is more of a bumbling, likable guy that is given too many lines and too much camera time. He doesn't stand a chance letting it rip with Andy Garcia.The list of quirky and over-the-top characters goes on. It's bloody violent, and lots of everything that would be consider ""over-the-top"".

1060429,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000NTPFK8,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","Here is a movie that I thought looked really good from the moment I saw the first trailer. It featured an all-star cast ranging from younger stars Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, and Jeremy Piven to veterans Ray Liotta, Andy Garcia, and Alex Rocco, which together should create plenty of interesting scenes, plus some really impressive action set pieces, and what appeared to be a really engaging story this should make for a really good movie. Throw in a critically acclaimed director, Joe Carnahan (""Narc"") and ""Smokin' Aces"" becomes what should definitely be a movie to see, but in the end could this ensemble movie meet the high expectations that I had set for it?""Smokin' Aces"" begins with a mob hit being placed on the head of Las Vegas illusionist/mob entertainer/recently turned FBI rat, Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven). Responding to this extremely high-profile hit is a melting pot of deadly talent that includes a team of bail bondsmen (led by Ben Affleck), an attractive femme fatale (Alicia Keys), a torturous sadist, and a trio of savage brothers who live to kill. As these various hit men (and women) converge on Las Vegas, unbeknownst to them is them is the fact that the FBI is trying to seal their deal with Buddy who is still waffling on whether or not to completely become an informant. To fully convince him, and to try to save his life are two agents (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta) who have been ordered by their boss (Andy Garcia) to do whatever it takes to ensure that Buddy doesn't fall into harms way before making the deal.So, with all my expectations regarding this movie, could ""Smokin' Aces"" live up to what I hoped for? Well, sadly it couldn't. Now, you might be thinking that I set my standards for this movie too high and so I was destined to be disappointed, maybe so. But I've had some time to think about this movie since watching it, and I've come to the conclusion that even if I hadn't been so excited to see it, I still would have been disappointed in it. The movie just flat out does not deliver the goods, plain and simple.The story is intriguing enough, and though it was fairly simple, I thought it worked to this film's advantage due to the amount of characters that were receiving so much screen time. However, the mix of humor and drama didn't feel smooth, I personally would have preferred less humor, and some of it may not have been so intentional, but to me the humor went a little too far into stupidity at times to not be noticed. Thus, taking away from the seriousness of the overall story. The worst offenders regarding the stupid humor were the trio of brothers, these guys were supposed to be scary, but instead they came off as being imbeciles and at times almost incestual which was a pointless, and gross character trait. Adding to the problems that took away from the story was the fact that by 3/4 of the way through the movie I began to really not care what happened to any of the characters, most were became highly unlikable (not that there were too many of them to root for anyways), and some of the plot points began to not make as much sense and became pointless or clich&eacute;, making the story seem excessive for such a simple premise, so when all was said and done the movie basically crumbled under its own weight.What did work fairly well for this movie, and these are the only parts that did, were the acting and the gunplay. Pretty much the entire cast of talented actors deliver very strong, sometimes intense performances that would normally make for a great movie; however, the story didn't serve them as well as they served it. The action sequences were all very impressive to watch, sometimes a little too crowded, and therefore confusing as to who was shooting whom, but nonetheless they were fun. But the majority of the action doesn't occur until the final act of the movie, and by then I was just wanting to see how it all ended, and wasn't really caring too much for the characters. But, it was also during this final conflict that the movie began to crumble, because the chaos of the action was too jumbled and the characters became a little too clich&eacute;d. So even when the movie was doing what it did best, it was still failing to me. All of this served as a definite sign that this movie could not live up to anything more than what it truly was, a Direct-to-DVD movie filled with A-list Hollywood talent that allowed it to hit theaters rather than be doomed to the bargain bin.""Smokin' Aces"" is rated R for violence, language, drug use, and sexuality/nudity.",2,"Nobody Walks Away Clean, or Entertained...",1186099200,"08 3,

I put the DVD in my DVD player one Friday night and I sat back and started the film. I am guessing if you are reading this review you at least know the plot of Smokin' Aces so I am not going into detail on the plot because I suck at it anyway.Cast: The cast is extremely good, Having Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta play detectives who are to protect Jeremy Piven, Ben Affleck does a good job as well as Pete Berg. Chris Pine before Star Trek fame is in this as one of the insane Tremor Brothers, Jason Bateman has a small role in it but brings in some decent comic relief, The rapper Common does a surprisingly decent job as well as Alicia Keys. Andy Garcia also gives in a good performance but the standouts are Ryan Reynolds and Jeremy Piven.Now as I passed the first hour of Smokin' Aces, I was disappointed about how it was more of a comedy than an serious action flick. Then the second hour came along, That's when I started to love the film. See, I wasn't expecting a comedy film in the first hour which brought my disappointment not because I don't like comedy in action flicks but I wasn't expecting it. The second hour is also a lot more action packed with the multiple showdowns at the hotel starting to happen. The acting really improves in the second hour as well, Jeremy Piven brings a lot more drama to his role which was extremely good to the character. Ryan Reynolds brings well deserved frustration to his role as he is fighting off the multiple assassins. The action is great in the entire film with multiple shootouts and Leatherface-like actions bringing many deaths.The Ending: Now the ending pissed a lot of people off about Smokin' Aces, I personally loved the ending even though it could have ended better. I am going to end this topic now so I don't give away spoilers.Overall: I loved Smokin' Aces but it is not a perfect film, I think hardcore action fans will appreciate it and Ryan Reynolds fans should really like his role(I thought it was his best movie role).

Was Keys supposed to go in and seduce somebody--Jeremy Piven I guess?  If so, she just seemed like an airhead.  The whole plot with those two, and the woman who procured them, could have been dropped with ease, though the film did gain something from seeing two beautiful black women act like old pros at assassination.  (Though like I say, they prove singularly incompetent at it, so perhaps it wasn't a great victory for black positivity.)  Why not get Pam Grier in the film, if you're tipping your hat to her.  Don't get these wannabes, get the real thing!  (Though again, Alicia Keys shows some surprising talent as an actress and the other woman, the one I recognize from HUSTLE AND FLOW, knows how to steal every scene she's in, though she fails with the howitzer.)Director Carnahan has learned from Tarantino, De Palma, Coppola, and much of the film seems like he's mashing together THE GODFATHER II with De Palm's SNAKE EYES and even RAISING CAIN.  The multiple narratives interstice with ease and in fact provide a lot of the fun of the film, though maybe they detract from whatever serious points the writer's trying to make.

Carnahan does a good job of directing the violence and mayhem, his camera really captures every bullet hit and knife thrust, and he juggles a large cast really well while keeping the story moving along at a brisk pace. It was great fun seeing all the good and bad guys put through their paces in the intricate storyline as they converge on the hotel in Tahoe where Jeremy Piven's character Buddy awaits in a clueless coked-up haze.***Major Spoilers Ahead***The final act starts well in a hail of bullets as all the opposing parties square off, but at the 90 minute mark the film goes completely off track. Rather than contain the finale to a bloody denouement at the hotel, for some reason the script has numerous characters scatter after the initial shootouts/stabbings/chainsawings etc. I was particularly galled that two of the most vicious killers are not killed, one walks away scot free! Another appears to be ready to make his escape from a stretcher where his blade has been hidden up his sleeve. And Alicia Key's hit woman character gets carried off by another minor character, wounded but alive. Where was my cathartic release here? Where was the payback?!! The writers don't seem to care, as these dangling plot threads are ignored in favor of introducing an asinine twist ending that makes little sense.In his commentary on the DVD, even Carnahan mentions that people thought the movie should have ended at the hotel. He should have listened to them. If they weren't going to tell us what happened to the killers, they should have just stopped it there and not ruined it with a talky, convoluted monologue from Andy Garcia, playing the FBI head. And the final moment with Ryan Reynold's pulling the plug on Buddy and Sparazza at the hospital is ludicrous and out of character for him. I was left simply shaking my head. This film could have and should have been better, were it not for the final 15 minutes.

Some people here are being negative because of it's unrealistic story and plot holes, what movie does not have those?? Uh HELLO, this is an ACTION movie and should be judged as such, especially with a title like ""Smoking Aces"". I judge movies on their merits in their category, I don't put action movies up against a Drama, Romance etc. Most of the assassins were pretty interesting but of course they were not investigated in any depth. I was a little disappointed in Alicia Keys and partners characters, using the stereo-typical ""Black Slang"" and using the ""N"" word thru-out the movie, but they redeemed themselves somewhat by having the best action sequences of the film. Keys partner is a chick with a 50cal sniper rifle, and she brings the HEAT by absolutely shredding some FBI agents in the next building. There were a couple of glaring Assassin and Police mistakes, like when Keys partner goes to another room for a better line-of-site shot and leaves the door open behind her, just in time for the FBI to come and shoot her in the back. (I'm pretty sure Assassins cover their back, that's Assassin 101) Also the highly trained FBI agents know they are taking fire from a monster sniper rifle from another building, yet they stand up and respond with mere pistols, and a SHOTGUN?? Do you know what the spread is on buckshot?? If your not standing right in front of a person, all that shot just spreads out, just dumb. Common and his typical diatribe was unnecessary, to say the least but at least some Black people survived. Anyway, the story was not bad but the action was some of the best gunfight scenes I have witnessed in awhile. Absolutely kinetic. You can tell the directors were trying to copy the standard of Asian action movie gunfights, and they come close but Asian flicks of even 20 years ago (See John Woo) are still some of the greatest gun battles ever committed to celluloid.

I personally Love this movie, Its a very intense storylined action film. It goes in detail about most of the assassains, you get to know the FBI Agents Portrayed by Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta. The Cast was great each excelled at his/her role, no weak links. Jeremy Piven is the character that the movie sorrounds, hes a cocaine addicted vegas showman who gets in a bad entanglement with the mob. I highly recommened this film to anyone who likes a great action movie with a solid storyline. At the time it played in theatres It was one of the best action films id seen in many years. Ray Liotta makes a strong showing in this film although in my view nothing will touch the role he played in Goodfellas, the chemistry in that movie along with the story was to good to be topped by anything hell ever do which is why its pointless for people to compare other roles to that movie, Goodfellas was a dipalma masterpeice it had Liotta, Dinero and Pescis terrific chemistry words of advice when seeing Liotta and Pesci is not to compare their other roles to that movie. Dinero possibly can be compared due to the fact hes had so many great roles that go with that style movie. But again id highly recommened this movie to any fan of hard hitting action drama films. When it comes to blu ray or dvd this film all the way through and around is better on Blu Ray the superior picture and sound helps miles and miles with the movie and its style to see the full effect and extent.

1060445,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000NTPFK8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 4]","Joe Carnahan, who wrote and directed the phenomenal character-piece, ""Narc,"" has decided to stop being so serious.  ""Smokin' Aces"" has ""Narc""s dizzying allure, mercurial dialogue, giddy violence and copious drug use, but this time Carnahan isn't trying to do anything other than get a few cinematic kicks out of much, much more than a few seriously talented character actors (and actresses).The story revolves around a washed-up Las Vegas performer who tried his hand at playing the professional mobster and was a bit too good at it.  Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (played with careless flair by Jeremy Piven) ends up dividing an entire mob family and drawing the scrutiny of the FBI.  Cards he can play with; fire, he cannot.  He decides to turn state's evidence, putting him at the top of the hit list of every low life, opportunist, and deviant scumbag that the mob can get in touch with.Aces holes himself up (not so secretly) in the sun-drenched penthouse suite of the Nomad hotel in Vegas, playing out his last days like a man who has been told the exact moment he's going to die.  Prostitutes lay scattered about his digs like so much half-clothed detritus.  Drugs take the place of food and water.  He flaunts his failures with every line, moves between rooms perpetually fiddling with a deck of cards, executing half-tricks and fumbles.  He is your classic Man On The Edge, and along come several Bad Guys with the motivation and the skill to push him right over it.  If they don't end up pushing each other over in the process, that is.Carnahan's script and his filming are the most gorgeous kind of trash.  This is eye-candy in almost every sense of the word -- beautiful, liquid garbage.  My momma always told me not to eat too much candy or I'd get sick.  This movie may not have been what she was talking about, but the theory applies.  The dialogue slides from mouth to mouth like its own character, a jaunty mixture of tongue-in-cheek, self-conscious-cleverness, and some kind of wanna-be slang.  Carnahan's attempts to weave homemade idioms into the mixture of old school cop lingo and hit man toss offs may not always work, but its sure as hell a lot of fun.  And so is the rest of the film.In fact, I was tempted to give this movie 5 stars, if for no other reason that it almost -- almost -- delivers exactly what it promises: fun.  Chameleon-esque bounty hunters (Flanagan), sexy black widows (Keys and Henson), brute force anarchists (Pine, Durand, and Sterling), mookish bail bondsmen (Affleck), wild cards, and black suits descend on the Nomad on the same fatal day.  The result is a collision with a dozen points of origin, and the moment of impact is loud, it's sustained, and it's big.  Like I said, it's trash.  A firey, brilliant, dizzying ball of spinning refuse.The only problems are when the movie stops spinning long enough to do a little unnecessary musing.  Piven, if this makes any sense, gives his role almost too much pathos.  Yes, it's a time of crisis for Aces, but the meat of the movie is in the crisis itself, and not in the man who inspired it.  Too much is made of Aces' struggle with the cards he's dealt for himself.  The film seems to be afraid of its own momentum, and at the points where it starts to hit a breakneck speed, we are suddenly treated to overlong moments of Aces weeping introspectively over his out-of-control life, as if any audience would ever be compelled to sympathize with this man.No.  You're bound to be more interested in the clever chemistry between ex-cops Deeks (Berg) and Elmore (Henderson) or between still-cops Carruthers (Liotta) and Messner (Reynolds).  Even the fringe men make for more entrancing viewing (Fox is perfect in his brief stint as Bill, Bateman is excellent in his far-too-small role as Rip Reed, and Common turns out a masterfully underplayed performance as Aces' right-hand-man, Sir Ivy).  The hitmen are all out for Aces' heart (literally), and the film occasionally tries to fill that heart with mawkish affectation.  They are the only real parts where this masterfully molded trash actually starts to stink a little.  (Well, that and the bizarre segments with the annoying one-eyed Ritalin addict and his grandmother; what the heck were THOSE all about?)The film is otherwise pretty nimble; it ducks and dodges enough to make its central mystery as interesting as the characters that populate it.  The final reveal, though (much of its stylism borrowed heavily from ""The Usual Suspects""), is a tad drawn-out, if not necessary.  It is the final ace up this movie's sleeve.  We are treated to a macabre mosaic of electric characters, vicious violence, and barely contained chaos, and the final moment is one of deep, restrained emotion.  In other hands, it could easily have been a sour twist on a super-sweet candy liquor.  Reynolds (who has come a loooooong way since his Van Wilder and ""Waiting..."" days) does a stunning job with it, however.  For most of the film we are encouraged to contemplate Aces' deteriorating soul; it turns out the real heart of the film beats in Reynolds' Messner.Come for the smoke and mirrors, stay for the glitz and fire, expect some sleight-of-hand, speedy stage patter, and misdirection, and smirk knowingly at the few stabs at sincerity.

There's so much going on and so much information being delivered at the beginning, that it made it difficult for me to catch it all the first time around.  For better or worse, it's one of those movies that requires thorough attention and the understanding that every little piece of dialog is significant.  To its credit, every second of Smokin' Aces is necessary and not one second is wasted.  There is no drag to the story at all... which is also its problem if you're a casual viewer.  Let your mind wander for more than a few seconds and you're wondering what you missed.  Beyond that, the best parts of this movie are found in subtleties that can be appreciated only after repeated viewings, which is what makes it worth owning.  Even the minor characters are interesting and memorable, and every scene offers layers of personality and character that reveal themselves only when the sometimes overwhelming (and magnificently directed) violence is set aside.  My only real criticism is that the twist at the end feels rather anti-climactic and overdue.  I'm not sure it could have been done any other way, but it was a noticeable distraction (although the final scene made up for most of it).",4,"Lots of smoke, plenty of fire(power)...",1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,1317,"['Seriously', 'had', 'watch', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'three', 'times', 'get', 'rhythm', 'pick', 'up', 'critical', 'details', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'being', 'delivered', 'beginning', 'made', 'difficult', 'catch', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'better', 'worse', 'one', 'movies', 'thorough', 'attention', 'understanding', 'little', 'piece', 'dialog', 'significant', 'credit', 'second', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'necessary', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'wasted', 'drag', 'story', 'also', 'problem', ""'re"", 'casual', 'viewer', 'Let', 'mind', 'wander', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'what', 'missed', 'Beyond', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'found', 'subtleties', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'only', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'what', 'worth', 'owning', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'memorable', 'scene', 'layers', 'personality', 'character', 'reveal', 'only', 'when', 'sometimes', 'overwhelming', 'magnificently', 'directed', 'violence', 'set', 'aside', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'twist', 'end', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'overdue', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'noticeable', 'distraction', 'final', 'scene', 'made', 'up', 'most']",N/A

1060449,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B000NTPFK8,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[4, 5]","Maybe I just LOVE the grittiness and despair in this movie. I think it was in the same genre of Tarantino....or Pulp Fiction, Sin City, or Kill Bill. And like those movies, you are either going to love it or hate it. I for one, loved this movie! The story is simple, Buddy Isreal is a magician/mob informant who has finally outlived his usefulness. Whether the result of his growing drug addiction, addiction to the ""fast life"", or his ""big"" mouth, the mob boss wants him dead, and has placed a price on his head of $1 million dollars. Now comes the introduction of several bounty hunters who want Buddy and want him bad. The bounty hunters in themselves are entertaining, and make up a lot of the movie. They include: an ex-police officer (Ben Affleck)and two of his closest friends; the sexy Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and her partner (who appears to be in love with her); and a freakish group of brothers (who are clearly unstable).  But while the bounty hunters fight each other to locate the target (Isreal), a ""chameleon"" killer (we think)is hot on Isreal's trail. The question becomes who will reach him first?Meanwhile, the FBI, headed by Andy Garcia wants the information that Buddy has to offer about the Mob organization that they have been trying to bring down for years, and a secret that they are trying to protect. Assigned to locating and bring Isreal in are Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds, who are absolutely fabulous is their roles.Surrounded by a ""hip hop"" gangsta and a Russian ""track suit wearing"" bodyguard, Buddy tries to ""play"" his cards close to the chest, stay alive and keep partying while he is doing it. Finding that Buddy has made their lives expendable as well, we wonder who will stand up and protect Buddy in the end, because it seems that the odds are high that someone will ""Smoke Isreal"", but who will it be?What I found to be the most compelling about the story was the underlying struggle of the young agent to understand the difference between what is ""right from wrong"" AND ""good and evil"".  Sometimes things aren't what they seem, and the decisions that are made aren't as easy as we would think.The only question I have is why is this movie marketed like Ben Affleck has a large role in the movie? I do think that Affleck showed that he is a talented actor (I don't think I have enjoyed any of his recent movies with exception of this one), but he definately did not ""carry"" the movie. There were a ton of exceptionally, talented actors. I was extremely pleased and surprised by the performance of hip hop singer ""Common"". Although I have never been a lover of his music, I thought that he added another dimension to the role that he played. I thought that he and Alicia Keys were both absolutely brilliant!  So maybe I just like these kind of movies, and think that some of the other reviewers were kind of hard, but I definately think that Smokin' Aces deserves or warrants a 5.",5,"I won't be popular for my review, but here goes....I loved this movie!",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2921,"['Maybe', 'just', 'LOVE', 'grittiness', 'despair', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'same', 'genre', 'Tarantino', '.or', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Sin', 'City', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'movies', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'one', 'loved', 'movie', 'story', 'simple', 'Buddy', 'Isreal', 'magician/mob', 'informant', 'who', 'finally', 'outlived', 'usefulness', 'result', 'growing', 'drug', 'addiction', 'addiction', 'fast', 'life', 'big', 'mouth', 'mob', 'boss', 'dead', 'placed', 'price', 'head', '1', 'million', 'dollars', 'Now', 'introduction', 'several', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'who', 'want', 'Buddy', 'want', 'bad', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'are', 'entertaining', 'make', 'up', 'lot', 'movie', 'include', 'ex-police', 'officer', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'sexy', 'Georgia', 'Sykes', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'partner', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'freakish', 'group', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'unstable', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'fight', 'other', 'locate', 'target', 'Isreal', 'chameleon', 'killer', 'think', 'hot', 'Isreal', 'trail', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'reach', 'first', 'Meanwhile', 'FBI', 'headed', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'information', 'Buddy', 'offer', 'Mob', 'organization', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'years', 'secret', 'are', 'trying', 'protect', 'Assigned', 'locating', 'bring', 'Isreal', 'are', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'roles.Surrounded', 'hip', 'hop', 'gangsta', 'Russian', 'track', 'suit', 'wearing', 'bodyguard', 'Buddy', 'play', 'cards', 'close', 'chest', 'stay', 'alive', 'keep', 'partying', 'doing', 'Finding', 'Buddy', 'made', 'lives', 'expendable', 'as', 'well', 'wonder', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'protect', 'Buddy', 'end', 'odds', 'are', 'high', 'someone', 'will', 'Smoke', 'Isreal', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'What', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'story', 'was', 'underlying', 'struggle', 'young', 'agent', 'understand', 'difference', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'good', 'evil', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'would', 'think.The', 'only', 'question', 'have', 'why', 'movie', 'marketed', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'large', 'role', 'movie', 'do', 'think', 'Affleck', 'showed', 'talented', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'movies', 'exception', 'one', 'definately', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'movie', 'were', 'ton', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'actors', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'surprised', 'performance', 'hip', 'hop', 'singer', 'Common', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'lover', 'music', 'thought', 'added', 'dimension', 'role', 'played', 'thought', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'were', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'maybe', 'just', 'kind', 'movies', 'think', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'kind', 'hard', 'definately', 'think', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'deserves', 'warrants', '5']",N/A
1060450,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000NTPFK8,Mike Zimmerman,"[1, 2]","Former magician Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) recently became part of a mafia empire run by Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). However, things didn't turn out so well, and now he's reduced to a desperate junkie who has agreed to turn state evidence against the boss. So Sparazza fights back by offering up a reward for Israel's heart. This catches the attention of the FBI's finest (Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta, Ryan Reynolds), bail bondsmen (Ben Affleck, Martin Henderson, Peter Berg), wisecracking contract killers (Taraji P. Henson, Alicia Keys), and neo-Nazis (Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, Maury Sterling). The race is on to determine the outcome.For ""Smokin' Aces"", director Joe Carnahan switches from the William Friedkinesque police suspenser (""Narc"") to a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie/Tony Scott mixture of action, comedy, drama, and suspense. It's a very risky effort. A similar situation involved director Ron Sheldon, who followed the gritty ""Dark Blue&lt;"" with a mixed bag of an action-comedy, ""Hollywood Homicide.""Of course, that film was a lighthearted action-comedy in the veins of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Rush Hour."" With ""Aces,"" Carnahan takes his patented crime drama techniques (and star Ray Liotta) and has placed them inside a more mainstream, bigger-budgeted film (complete with camera panes, computer generated special effects, and all that jargon). What we have is a crime thriller that sparks with zest, spunk, wit, and some unlikely great performances. Yes, the wait was worth it.""Aces"" starts off with Red Bull already guzzled. Carnahan introduces the characters within quick-paced transitions between speeches which give you the feeling that the next individual said what the other one said. A little off-putting, but it doesn't ruin the narrative.Like ""Narc"", Carnahan includes plenty of off-putting violence. It's amped up more this time. The Tremors use the most dangerous of weapons known to man (including two swords and a chainsaw), and Waters mans a machine gun with scoping features to blow away the competition in the other building. This may all sound like the over-the-top rampage that would drain a movie's energy away, a flaw that killed films like ""Running Scared"" and ""3000 Miles to Graceland."" But Carnahan has the giddiness of the young boy that goes nuts in front of Hollis Ellmore, and directs the action sequences with smooth camera cuts, giving the movie the suspense it needs.For the movie's sense of humor, it's a doozy. My favorite moments included Jason Bateman's shyster lawyer figure who wears female lingerie, the bipolar banter between the female assassins (Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson crack some funny lines that ellicit some worthy smiles), and Jeremy Piven's handling of raucous situations (including stopping a fight between prostitutes). Then there are some off-putting ones, one which include a kid who gets a boner while performing karate chops in front of Hollis Ellmore. Carnahan must have a sick and twisted sense of humor to think that this scene would have a positive effect on audiences. Sorry, but I'm not a sucker.I was also surprised by the movie's other supporting cast. Ryan Reynolds, mostly making a career by playing man childs (especially in the underrated ""Just Friends""), takes the route to gritty crime drama, and comes out with a slam-bang performance. Along with great chemistry with Ray Liotta (the sort of rapport that the ""Miami Vice"" movie could've used), Reynolds shows off a frustrated side at the end of the film when he is determined to know why Sparozza needs the heart transplant. Just watching him act next to character actor Andy Garcia is joyous, making me wonder what he'll be able to accomplish next.Sadly, ""Aces"" finale is another failed attempt at ending the film with a head-spinning twist a la ""Usual Suspects"" that is determined to tickle the ivories of viewer brains. Whether it was the shoddy speakers in the theater or not is beyond me, but the film confounds things with why Israel was imperative to Sparazza (as said, Reynolds' dramatic chops make up for this little complaint), hidden agendas, and corrupt cops. With all the rampage going on, the last thing Carnahan should do is end what began with a bang with a wimper.The movie, overall, still remains a friggin' entertaining experience. With many of today's films that wish to get too dirty for no reason (""Running Scared"", a volitale thriller, features a scene that hints that a couple are child molesters - not a good scene for a film that fires on all cyllinders when focusing on the main plot at hand), it's good to see a director to at least put more effort into something like ""Aces.""",4,"""You see exactly and only what I

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[8, 11]","I'm a big fan of gangster genre--in many ways, it seems to be one of the last vestiges of quirky character investigation left in the world of movies and media.  The popularity and intrigue generated byThe Sopranos, for example, shows you how much gangsters capture people's interests.  And why?  Maybe because they're such extraordinary personalities, characters that are dealing with the essential questions of survival and betrayal and life and death.But nix that idea for this movie--this movie is a wannabe in gangster genre, but only seems to know the images but nothing of the substance.  Wanting to soak up the cult elitism of Tarantino added to the flair of something likeSnatch, this movie tries to set up a host of nasty but somehow interesting characters, as well as a little secret to try to drive the film by.The set-up--simple.  Buddy Israel, a Vegas magician turned mob boss, is turning informant, and so a million-dollar bounty has been put on his head, which catches the interest of a hitman who is also a master of disguise, as well as a pair of female gangstas, a trio of Nazi brothers, and a mysterious figure known as only The Swede (which is apprently a nickname that was never used in the hole history of the mob).  But there is a stir in the FBI head office, and though three agents (including Ray Liotta) have already headed off to Israel's penthouse to protect the man.Of course, there are other characters and turns, but they all feel a little flat during the movie, for there is little sense of character investigation and more a barrage of eccentricities with little sense of the logic behind them, and the pay-off towards the end is nothing of the sort, leading to a finale that is little more than improbable to any sense of logic.  Rather than deal with the emotions of love, hatred and devotion, this movie merely mentions them to try to spice up its characters, but they are never really issues in the plot.  Israel is clearly bothered by his impending move, but the reason for it is totally obfuscated until maybe the end, but even then it's not so clear.  There might be a hint of romance between the two female killers, but again this is there just to make them a little more quirky rather than truly interesting characters.Overall, a disappointment.

Instead, it's a bloody fun ride with a nice cast that doesn't mind getting their hands dirty.  Jeremy Piven, better known as Ari from Entourage, plays burned out Vegas magician Buddy ""Aces"" Israel.  He messed with the mob for too long, and now he's looking to cook up a deal with the feds to save his own skin, but not before a million dollar bounty is put on his head, which prompts every kind of hitman imaginable to make a run at him.  This includes a trio of neo-Nazi rednecks, a bail bondsman (Ben Affleck) and his partners (Martin Henderson and Peter Berg), an super hot hit-woman (Alicia Keys), a master of disguise (Tommy Flannigan), and the two FBI Agents (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta) trying to beat everybody to the punch.  This all concludes in an over the top, ultraviolent showdown that will leave you with your head shaking.  While there are times the film reaches too far and has a somewhat convoluted plot, Smokin' Aces is a fun treat while it lasts regardless.  The rest of the cast, which includes Andy Garcia, Common, Matthew Fox, and Jason Bateman in a brief, but oh so memorable role as a cross dressing, sleeze ball lawyer, is pretty good too.

It's also riddled with some of the most gruesomely graphic - and surprisingly sadistic - violence this side of the ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" franchises.Jeremy Piven and Ryan Reynolds are, more or less, the leads in the film, but the movie is crowded with such familiar faces as Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Alex Rocco, and an almost unrecognizable Michael Fox (""Lost"") in supporting roles.There's plenty for action film aficionados to sink their teeth into in ""Smokin' Aces,"" but it's the overall mean-spiritedness that spoils the fun of this one.",2,a tone of viciousness undercuts the fun,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,1425,"['**1/2Joe', 'Carnahan', 's', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Tarantino-esque', 'crime', 'drama', 'cast', 'characters', 'almost', 'as', 'extensive', 'one', 'War', 'Peace', 'catalyst', 'story', 'Vegas', 'magician', 'named', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'who', 'being', 'targeted', 'assassination', 'turning', 'state', 'evidence', 'mob', 'plot', 'advances', 'vast', 'assortment', 'professional', 'killers', 'FBI', 'agents', 'determined', 'get', 'hands', 'target', 'converge', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'hotel', 'where', 'Israel', 'staying.With', 'absurdly', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'smart-alecky', 'sense', 'humor', 'broad', 'narrative', 'canvas', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'clearly', 'patterned', 'granddaddy', 'postmodern', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Shot', 'what', 'be', 'ugly', 'yellow', 'filter', 'movie', 'certain', 'energy', 'style', 'punctuated', 'clever', 'scene', 'transitions', 'occasionally', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'also', 'riddled', 'most', 'gruesomely', 'graphic', 'surprisingly', 'sadistic', 'violence', 'side', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'franchises.Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'leads', 'film', 'movie', 'crowded', 'such', 'familiar', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Michael', 'Fox', 'Lost', 'supporting', 'plenty', 'action', 'film', 'aficionados', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'overall', 'mean-spiritedness', 'fun', 'one']",N/A

1060468,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000NTPFK8,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 15]","""Smokin Aces"" is a bloody nightmare of guns, drugs, mobsters and death. The plot, epic in nature, weaves together, oh, 467 storylines, all of which revolve a Vegas magician who's about to roll over on the mob. The mob wants him dead. Maybe.This snitch, Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, is one of the more annoying characters in recent movie history. And Jeremy Piven, the actor who plays him, delivers the kind of incoherent performance a 12-year-old might give after 48 hours in front of a Wii.In one scene, Buddy, high on cocaine, looks at a single contact lens that has fallen out his eye. It's blue. Buddy's natural eye color is that of a wilted green bean. So he covers the bean eye with his palm and looks in the mirror. He cries. He covers the blue eye. Cries again. Later, he considers killing himself. He opens his mouth. Closes it. Stares into space.Piven stretches the limit of tolerance about far as it can go. On two different occasions, he regards a skylight as if it were God. He shuffles playing cards until they spin out of his hands and flutter to the floor. He snorts drugs. He stares at his cell phone. Flutters some more cards. Stares into space. Cries. Passes out.That's the kind of movie ""Smokin Aces"" is: In the midst of its random chaos, it takes the time to be pretentious. It splatters brain juice all over the wall, but it's still smug enough for inane reflections and spurts of random integrity. This is why a bearded Ryan Reynolds roils with phony rage as he screams ""MEDACCK!"" That's ""medic"" in English.Writer-director Joe Carnahan makes us wade through 90 minutes of Neo-Nazis, chainsaws, hacked-off fingers, cliched gunfights, naked prostitutes, some guy named ""Slut"" and Jason Bateman wearing a bra. But he also wants this to be a dirge about the darkest interiors of man. A blood opera. That's a lot of arrogance for an exploitation flick.For about 15 minutes, ""Smokin Aces"" has some juice. Four groups of contract killers are out to kill Buddy, who hides in the penthouse of a Lake Tahoe hotel. Two FBI agents (Reynolds and Ray Liotta) are supposed to protect him. Ben Affleck plays a bail bondsman. Bateman is a lawyer whose purpose I never figured out. Andy Garcia inexplicably tries on a southern accent as the Deputy Director of the FBI.Then the plot kicks in, and the movie falls apart. Carnahan kills off the interesting characters and isolates the leftovers in elevator shafts.  We spend the most time with two hitwomen (Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson) who converse in a banal hip-hop code borrowed from the ""Bad Boys"" franchise. And, of course, we enjoy the distinct pleasure of Buddy's company.",1,An early frontrunner for next year's Razzies,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2626,"['Smokin', 'Aces', 'bloody', 'nightmare', 'guns', 'drugs', 'mobsters', 'death', 'plot', 'epic', 'nature', 'together', 'oh', '467', 'storylines', 'revolve', 'Vegas', 'magician', 'who', 'roll', 'over', 'mob', 'mob', 'dead', 'Maybe.This', 'snitch', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'characters', 'recent', 'movie', 'history', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'actor', 'who', 'kind', 'incoherent', 'performance', '12-year-old', 'might', 'give', '48', 'hours', 'front', 'Wii.In', 'one', 'scene', 'Buddy', 'high', 'cocaine', 'single', 'contact', 'fallen', 'out', 'eye', 'blue', 'Buddy', 'natural', 'eye', 'color', 'wilted', 'green', 'bean', 'bean', 'eye', 'palm', 'mirror', 'blue', 'eye', 'Cries', 'again', 'Later', 'killing', 'mouth', 'space.Piven', 'stretches', 'limit', 'tolerance', 'about', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'two', 'different', 'occasions', 'skylight', 'were', 'God', 'playing', 'cards', 'spin', 'hands', 'flutter', 'floor', 'drugs', 'cell', 'phone', 'more', 'cards', 'Stares', 'space', 'Cries', 'out.That', 'kind', 'movie', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'midst', 'random', 'chaos', 'time', 'be', 'pretentious', 'brain', 'juice', 'wall', 'still', 'smug', 'enough', 'inane', 'reflections', 'spurts', 'random', 'integrity', 'why', 'bearded', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'phony', 'rage', 'MEDACCK', 'medic', 'English.Writer-director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'wade', '90', 'minutes', 'Neo-Nazis', 'chainsaws', 'hacked-off', 'fingers', 'cliched', 'gunfights', 'naked', 'prostitutes', 'guy', 'named', 'Slut', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'wearing', 'bra', 'also', 'be', 'dirge', 'darkest', 'interiors', 'man', 'blood', 'opera', 'lot', 'arrogance', 'exploitation', 'flick.For', '15', 'minutes', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'juice', 'Four', 'groups', 'contract', 'killers', 'are', 'kill', 'Buddy', 'who', 'penthouse', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'hotel', 'Two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Reynolds', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'are', 'supposed', 'protect', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'Bateman', 'lawyer', 'purpose', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'inexplicably', 'southern', 'accent', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'FBI.Then', 'plot', 'kicks', 'movie', 'apart', 'Carnahan', 'interesting', 'characters', 'leftovers', 'elevator', 'shafts', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'two', 'hitwomen', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'who', 'converse', 'banal', 'hip-hop', 'code', 'borrowed', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'franchise', 'course', 'enjoy', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'Buddy', 'company']",N/A

Well imagine if someone put a million dollars on your head, or more specifically your heart. Well Vegas entertainer turned mobster turned snitch Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) learned in the action packed Smokin' Aces. Well at least he would have known how that felt if he wasn't self-quarantined in a penthouse in Tahoe with more than enough women, drugs, and bodyguards which includes Common.Starting out just as clueless as Israel are the Feds (Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta) that are assigned to bring in the mobster in so he can testify against his former cohorts. It isn't until they get to the hotel that the million dollar mark on Israel has brought out a wide array of hired assassins that have descended on the town hoping to collect the heart of the rat before he is able to tell is story. And what an array of hoodlums they are including a female duo (Alicia Keys, Taraji P. Henson) who come complete with the biggest gun despite being the smallest physically. Then there is a master of disguise that can transform himself into almost anyone and how he does it extremely creepy. Even creepier is the torture expert played by Nestor Carbonell who has a disturbing run-in with Lost co-star Matthew Fox in a wig as bad as the one from his mullet flashbacks.But the grizzliest of the mercenaries are the Tremor Brothers, born of the same mother but all have different dads and even though there are numerous great elevator scenes throughout the movie, their exit out of it ranks the highest as they sport some unconventional weapons for assassins. The neo-Nazi brother also have a run in with a trio of bail bondsman (Ben Affleck, Peter Berg, Martin Henderson) who are hired by a lawyer (Jason Batman) who like to wear things that most men don't to retrieve the mob boss from skipping bail.The action comes quick and frequently with just a few a few soft spots like when the grandmother and her little too excited grandson show up. And you couldn't ask for much better cast than this, you know it is great when Piven is the weak link (he goes overboard a couple times). The big surprise is Keys who more than pulls off the female assassin role (although I'd still rather her stick to music) and Affleck who is much more palatable as a bit player than the leading man role he undeservingly gotten lately. And for a few laughs, check out the bloppers on the DVD to see just how bad of a pool player Affleck is.",4,They're Gonna Pour Boxes of Bullets into Him,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,2576,"['anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'reality', 'television', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'will', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'get', 'hands', 'million', 'dollars', 'Well', 'imagine', 'someone', 'put', 'million', 'dollars', 'head', 'more', 'specifically', 'heart', 'Well', 'Vegas', 'entertainer', 'turned', 'mobster', 'turned', 'snitch', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'learned', 'action', 'packed', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Well', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'self-quarantined', 'penthouse', 'Tahoe', 'more', 'enough', 'women', 'drugs', 'bodyguards', 'Common.Starting', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'clueless', 'Israel', 'are', 'Feds', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'are', 'assigned', 'bring', 'mobster', 'can', 'testify', 'former', 'cohorts', ""n't"", 'get', 'hotel', 'million', 'dollar', 'mark', 'Israel', 'brought', 'out', 'wide', 'array', 'hired', 'assassins', 'have', 'descended', 'town', 'hoping', 'collect', 'heart', 'rat', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'array', 'hoodlums', 'are', 'including', 'female', 'duo', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'who', 'come', 'complete', 'biggest', 'gun', 'being', 'smallest', 'physically', 'Then', 'master', 'disguise', 'can', 'transform', 'almost', 'anyone', 'how', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'Even', 'creepier', 'torture', 'expert', 'played', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'who', 'disturbing', 'run-in', 'Lost', 'co-star', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'wig', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'mullet', 'flashbacks.But', 'grizzliest', 'mercenaries', 'are', 'Tremor', 'Brothers', 'born', 'same', 'mother', 'have', 'different', 'dads', 'even', 'are', 'numerous', 'great', 'elevator', 'scenes', 'movie', 'exit', 'highest', 'sport', 'unconventional', 'weapons', 'assassins', 'neo-Nazi', 'brother', 'also', 'have', 'run', 'trio', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'lawyer', 'Jason', 'Batman', 'who', 'wear', 'things', 'most', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'retrieve', 'mob', 'boss', 'skipping', 'bail.The', 'action', 'quick', 'frequently', 'just', 'few', 'few', 'soft', 'spots', 'when', 'grandmother', 'little', 'too', 'excited', 'grandson', 'show', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'better', 'cast', 'know', 'great', 'when', 'Piven', 'weak', 'link', 'overboard', 'couple', 'times', 'big', 'surprise', 'Keys', 'who', 'more', 'pulls', 'female', 'assassin', 'role', ""'d"", 'still', 'rather', 'stick', 'music', 'Affleck', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'palatable', 'bit', 'player', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'undeservingly', 'lately', 'few', 'laughs', 'check', 'out', 'bloppers', 'DVD', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'pool', 'player', 'Affleck']",N/A

1060471,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000NTPFK8,Sky,"[1, 2]","Smokin' Aces Director Joe Carnahan must have been a fan of the Guy Ritchie films Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). The story flow and cinematography are very similar; I was reminded throughout Smokin' Aces of the two Ritchie films and I even wondered if perhaps Ritchie had a hand in Smokin' Aces....I've confirmed that he did not.Smokin' Aces is a good time. It's a fun story and an enjoyable dark comedy thriller. Jeremy Piven plays a Vegas-star-gone-bad that winds up as the target of some of the supposed best in the business assassins.The thing about Piven these days is that--if you're an Entourage (HBO) fan like I am--it's hard to see Piven as anyone other than Ari Gold. And that's exactly how Piven comes across in Smokin Aces...as a washed up, hit-the-wall Ari Gold. Kind of like when Jason Alexander tries to take a roll in a major motion picture, but all you see no matter what roll he plays is George Costanza. Anyhoo....Smokin' Aces is a bit too far over the top when it comes to ""could-this-really-happen?"" Hey, I have an open mind, and I said the movie was fun, but some of the characters and situations are impossible to take seriously: Firing the equivalent of a bazooka from the window of the umpteenth floor of one hotel to the next hotel without having the cavalry come down on you in seconds? A rogue band of punk rock assassins? Alicia Keys as an assassin?Perhaps the over-the-topness is deliberate, but the movie also tries to be serious; and the seriousness clashes more than it blends well with the over-the-topness.

There are some huge leaps in logic, and some of the actors work better than others; There are times where the film shifts tones to me, almost unsure of which direction to take certain scenes...However, I was pretty much entertained throughout, even rewinding many of the films action scenes several times(always a good sign); To be honest, I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Ryan Reynolds talks about plastic surgery of a mobster to Ray Liotta and says ""Every has-been in Hollywood hasn't had this much surgery."" Liotta has been suspected of having a lot of work done, but denies it. I like the way the scenes blend into each other. For instance, two people will shake hands to seal a deal, this then moves into a scene with two people shaking hands greeting each other. The lawyer trying to act hip was funny. In order to get the million dollar bounty, the hitmen will also eliminate their competition. Buddy is held on a secret hotel floor and everyone knows where it is located.Good action/comedy.

1060478,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000NTPFK8,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[16, 24]","If you took a blender and added parts of ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Kill Bill,"" and ""The Usual Suspects,"" you would come up with ""Smokin' Aces,"" a movie illustrating how an ambitious director copies cinematic style, plots, and characters in an attempt to duplicate the success of earlier movies.The plot of ""Smokin' Aces"" is simple:  Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), a longtime associate of mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin), has agreed to turn state's evidence to save his own skin by testifying that Sparazza has been responsible for over 130 contract murders.  When the mob learns of this betrayal, they put a one-million-dollar bounty on Aces' head.  They don't care who kills him, just as long as the deed is accomplished quickly.  Knowing he is a marked man, Aces has sequestered himself in a heavily guarded Lake Tahoe suite.The potential assassins include partners Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and sniper Sharice Watters (Tarajii Henson); a psychopathic trio of neo-Nazi inbreeds known as the Tremor brothers (Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, Maury Serling); and two international hit men, torture specialist Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell) and master of disguise Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan).Complicating matters, Vegas bail bondsman Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) is hired by attorney ""Rip"" Reed (Jason Bateman) to find the bail-jumping Aces before he gets handed over to the F.B.I.F.B.I. Deputy Director Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia) has dispatched his top agent, Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds), his veteran partner, Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta), and their team to the Tahoe hotel to protect Aces.The film switches around, tracing the convergence of the bevy of assassins on the fortress-like suite, Dupree and his team's plan to ""bring in"" Aces, and the F.B.I. agents' attempt to defend the informant.If you're lost by now, you should be.  The film tosses a huge number of characters out in relatively short order, expecting the viewer to keep track of who's who, who's doing what, and whom to root for.  And that is Problem #1.  Things jump around so quickly that it's hard to identify with anyone, and everyone -- with the exception of the F.B.I. agents -- seems scurrilous, reprehensible or, at best, sleazy.  Aces himself is the vilest character in the picture.  As portrayed by Piven, he is a coked-up martinet barking out orders to his flunkies as practically every hit man and woman worth the name is closing in.  We don't like him.  Should we be in his corner or that of the professional murderers out to off him?What is most disappointing about ""Smokin' Aces"" is the waste of top talent.  The cast is impressive, and many actors turn in fine performances.  Liotta, Bateman, and Keys, in particular, stand out, but in this mess of a movie, their work cannot be fully appreciated.Writer/director Joe Carnahan is obviously a fan of cult action cinema, since he cribs from nearly every successful offbeat action drama of the last ten years.  Every few minutes, the viewer is reminded of a scene or a character or a plot turn in a previous film.  It gets to the point that it becomes more interesting to identify movie references than to get involved with the story at hand.  Carnahan has an obvious appreciation of action movies, but his work in ""Smokin' Aces"" comes off as failed parody.""Smokin' Aces"" is extremely violent, fully meriting its R rating.  But this is the worst kind of violence.  It is exploitative.  Rather than the violence serving the plot, it appears the plot was constructed around set pieces of extreme violence.  As in ""Hamlet,"" there will be a lot of dead bodies at the end.  But there will be little audience sympathy for the deceased.  ""Smokin' Aces"" makes you appreciate all the more those films with violence -- such as ""The Departed"" and ""Blood Diamond"" -- that have substance and allow the viewer to feel something for the characters.This is a short-cut movie, the worst kind.  It makes a mad dash to the action stuff at the expense of characterization, assuming the viewer will be swept along in the film's fast pace.  Don't be fooled.  ""Smokin' Aces"" is pedestrian movie making.",1,Unbelievable BOMB!,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,4116,"['took', 'blender', 'added', 'parts', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'movie', 'illustrating', 'how', 'ambitious', 'director', 'copies', 'cinematic', 'style', 'plots', 'characters', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'success', 'earlier', 'movies.The', 'plot', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'simple', 'Buddy', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'longtime', 'associate', 'mob', 'boss', 'Primo', 'Sparazza', 'Joseph', 'Ruskin', 'agreed', 'turn', 'state', 'evidence', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'testifying', 'Sparazza', 'been', 'responsible', '130', 'contract', 'murders', 'When', 'mob', 'betrayal', 'put', 'one-million-dollar', 'bounty', 'Aces', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'deed', 'accomplished', 'quickly', 'Knowing', 'marked', 'man', 'Aces', 'sequestered', 'heavily', 'guarded', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'potential', 'assassins', 'include', 'partners', 'Georgia', 'Sykes', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'sniper', 'Sharice', 'Watters', 'Tarajii', 'Henson', 'psychopathic', 'trio', 'neo-Nazi', 'inbreeds', 'known', 'Tremor', 'brothers', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Maury', 'Serling', 'two', 'international', 'hit', 'men', 'torture', 'specialist', 'Pasquale', 'Acosta', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'master', 'disguise', 'Lazlo', 'Soot', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', '.Complicating', 'matters', 'Vegas', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'Jack', 'Dupree', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'hired', 'attorney', 'Rip', 'Reed', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'find', 'bail-jumping', 'Aces', 'handed', 'F.B.I.F.B.I', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Locke', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'dispatched', 'top', 'agent', 'Richard', 'Messner', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'veteran', 'partner', 'Donald', 'Carruthers', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'team', 'Tahoe', 'hotel', 'protect', 'Aces.The', 'film', 'switches', 'tracing', 'convergence', 'bevy', 'assassins', 'fortress-like', 'suite', 'Dupree', 'team', 'plan', 'bring', 'Aces', 'F.B.I', 'agents', 'attempt', 'defend', 'informant.If', ""'re"", 'lost', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'huge', 'number', 'characters', 'out', 'relatively', 'short', 'order', 'expecting', 'viewer', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'whom', 'root', 'Problem', '1', 'Things', 'jump', 'around', 'so', 'quickly', 'hard', 'identify', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'exception', 'F.B.I', 'agents', 'scurrilous', 'reprehensible', 'best', 'sleazy', 'Aces', 'vilest', 'character', 'picture', 'portrayed', 'Piven', 'coked-up', 'martinet', 'barking', 'out', 'orders', 'flunkies', 'practically', 'hit', 'man', 'woman', 'name', 'closing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Should', 'be', 'corner', 'professional', 'murderers', 'out', 'What', 'most', 'disappointing', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'waste', 'top', 'talent', 'cast', 'impressive', 'many', 'actors', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'Liotta', 'Bateman', 'Keys', 'particular', 'stand', 'out', 'mess', 'movie', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated.Writer/director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'obviously', 'fan', 'cult', 'action', 'cinema', 'nearly', 'successful', 'offbeat', 'action', 'drama', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'Every', 'few', 'minutes', 'viewer', 'reminded', 'scene', 'character', 'plot', 'turn', 'previous', 'film', 'point', 'more', 'interesting', 'identify', 'movie', 'references', 'get', 'involved', 'story', 'hand', 'Carnahan', 'obvious', 'appreciation', 'action', 'movies', 'work', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'off', 'failed', 'parody', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'extremely', 'violent', 'fully', 'meriting', 'R', 'rating', 'worst', 'kind', 'violence', 'exploitative', 'Rather', 'violence', 'serving', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', 'constructed', 'set', 'pieces', 'extreme', 'violence', 'Hamlet', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'dead', 'bodies', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'deceased', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'appreciate', 'more', 'films', 'violence', 'such', 'Departed', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'have', 'substance', 'allow', 'viewer', 'feel', 'something', 'characters.This', 'short-cut', 'movie', 'worst', 'kind', 'mad', 'dash', 'action', 'stuff', 'expense', 'characterization', 'assuming', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'swept', 'film', 'fast', 'pace', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'pedestrian', 'movie', 'making']",N/A

Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[3, 3]","If you like your violence to be action-coated with a veneer of dark humor to help it go down smoothly, then pick up a six pack and a copy of ""Smokin' Aces."" Maybe you oughta make that two six-packs, since you'll probably feel compelled to watch the film a second time anyway. Then again, maybe the beer is a bad idea, since it may inhibit your ability to comprehend the storyline. Hell, I was sober as a judge, and I found myself hitting rewind at least four times, trying to figure out who was killing whom, and why they were doing it. ""Smokin' Aces"" pulls its audience in so many directions simultaneously that you'll feel as stretched as Gumby at a tractor pull.The plot concerns itself with Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a Vegas magician who gets intimately involved with the mob, but somehow turns state's witness. While he is holed up in a penthouse suite, the `organization' places a highly publicized and highly valuable contract on his head (or more accurately, his heart - the mob boss wants his second most valuable organ removed). As a result, every psychotic, money-hungry lunatic rushes to compete for the prize. While the premise suggests that a sense of humor is essential to the storyline, the plot is actually much more gruesome than I had expected. More than once, I couldn't decide to laugh or wince as the blood sprayed abundantly. Between the flying bullets, plot twists pile up as fast as the body count.As ""Aces"" Israel, Jeremy Piven manages some of the rawest, reddest eyes I have ever seen outside of a medical marijuana center. Ben Affleck and Andy Garcia provide star power, but major props must go to singer-turned-actress Alicia Keys. As if being mentioned as a lust object in a Bob Dylan song weren't enough in 2006, she also manages to own this movie every time her bewigged character appears onscreen.While many movies combine plot twists and blood, few of them resemble the crimson-tainted pretzel of ""Smokin' Aces."" Perhaps if you cross ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" with ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" you'll get some idea of what to expect - lots of dead bodies (more than either of the above, and probably more than both combined), an array of insane characters, a great cast, and a monumentally confusing plot. To add to the confusion, the DVD offers alternate endings and plenty of out-takes - enough to keep you busy while waiting for the beer buzz to wear off.

1060480,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B000NTPFK8,T O'Brien,"[2, 2]","Smokin' Aces is a movie that was advertised as 90 minutes of non-stop action with little plot, but really it's more than that, and the reason I enjoyed the movie.  Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is a Las Vegas showman that has gotten himself into deep.  He has been driven to testify against the Mafia and go into the Witness Protection Program.  Israel is holed up in a penthouse in a Lake Tahoe hotel waiting for his deal to go through, but word gets out that the Mafia members he will testify against have put a $1 million price on his head...and his heart.  So starts a race to get to Israel including the FBI, bail bondsmen, bounty hunters, hired killers and even Buddy's own entourage.  While the movie has its fair share of action, the plot with all its intertwined storylines keeps everything moving.  It twists around enough to keep you wondering exactly what will happen without confusing you.  And the action ain't too shabby either.  With an excellent score from Clint Mansell to back up the action and twisting story that builds up to a good twist ending, Smokin' Aces is well worth a buy, and much better than the advertising that labeled it just as an action movie.The driving force for the movie is obviously its rather large ensemble cast.  Part of the fun is seeing who actually survives, and don't be tricked, writer/director Joe Carnahan wipes characters out with a snap of his finger.  Two of the best parts go to Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta as Messner and Carruthers, FBI agents trying to get to Israel before anyone else does.  Reynolds carries himself well in a dramatic role, and Liotta is excellent in support.  Jeremy Piven is excellent as Israel, but if anything, he's underused.  However, what is there is a very strong performance.  Ben Affleck, Peter Berg and Martin Henderson play Jack Dupree, a bail bondsman, and Pete Deeks and Hollis Elmore, two ex-cops trying to get their hands on Israel as well.  In her first role, singer Alicia Keys turns in a strong performance as a hired killer, Georgia Sykes, with her partner Sharice Watters, played by Taraji Henson.  Just some other names in the cast include Andy Garcia, Jason Bateman in a funny, but brief part, rapper Common, Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, and Maury Sterling as the Tremor brothers, Tommy Flanagan, and Matthew Fox.  Maybe the biggest compliment you can say about the cast is that most of these characters could probably have their own movie, they're that strong overall.The DVD is pretty well put together, although there's already been rumors of a special edition coming out soon.  Just some of the special features include four deleted scenes(several of which could have been left in), a different take of the ending, cast/crew interviews describing the characters and their backgrounds, almost 10 minutes of some really funny outtakes, a 5-minute featurette about the stunts and weaponry handling, two feature-length commentaries, and an 11-minute interview with Carnahan about the making of the movie.  If you enjoyed the movie, you'll like the special features, but be aware there might be more DVD releases to come.  Either way though, Smokin' Aces is a good blend of action and story with a great ensemble cast.

Parker III,"[0, 0]","While there is no doubt that Ryan Reynolds is a funnyman on screen, this is one of the few things he has ever acted in that shows he is very capable of being more than just a funnyman on screen. This movie is an over the top action flick that actually does not go too far considering the absurdity of the story. The supporting cast and their outrageous parts actually fit and they all do a tremendous job. I commend the director, actors, and all involved in keeping this story grounded.

It is a violent, visceral old-school movie about a mob hit on a small-time Vegas hood. The group of killers trying to make the hit and collect the bounty is fascinating. Alicia Keys is mesmerising in a stand-out performance as a hitwoman. Jeremy Piven is terrific as the obnoxious ""Aces"" Israel who is the target of the hit. Great performances from Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia. The twist ending is very cool. Definitely recommended. Innovative cinematography, dark humor and on-target direction.",4,Smokin' Aces Rocks,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,599,"['Give', 'movie', 'try', 'critics', 'trashed', 'much', 'better', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'violent', 'visceral', 'old-school', 'movie', 'mob', 'hit', 'small-time', 'Vegas', 'hood', 'group', 'killers', 'trying', 'make', 'hit', 'collect', 'bounty', 'fascinating', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'mesmerising', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'hitwoman', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'terrific', 'obnoxious', 'Aces', 'Israel', 'who', 'target', 'hit', 'Great', 'performances', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'twist', 'ending', 'very', 'cool', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'Innovative', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'humor', 'on-target', 'direction']",N/A

But this movie is a decent film with a mafia base, but has a great amount of actions and stories going that kept me tuned in.  The fighting/action scenes were some of the best this year. Some of the effects remind me of the transproter movies, or cranked, with some added computer enhancements that were good as well, not overdone.  I don't want to spoil the ending, but it actually was kept pretty well under wraps until the end.  The Plot revolves around Buddy ""Aces"", a vegas magician that is phenominally popular and good at Magic...but not so much at being a mobster. Well, he gets himself into some trouble, and the Feds are after him for information. In other words, he's a marked man, and the tower may crumble if he speeks.  He is trying to cut a deal with the feds, so he holds up at a casino at Lake Tahoe.  At the same time, the big mob boss is putting a ransom out on his head for 1 million dollars, and he want his heart.  The movie revolves around several different hitmen or groups planning on hauling his body back to the boss.  Good movie, pretty violent, but great action.

If in September 2009, you were among the spectators watching or the police battling armor wearing bank robbers in North Hollywood  then you were close.  Other wise my first sentence stands.  Regardless of personal experience this movie has some wonderful and authentic brutality.  Lots and lots of gun play.  Many bleeding body parts through out the picture.
