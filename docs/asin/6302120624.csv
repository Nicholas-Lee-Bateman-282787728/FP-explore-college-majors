296904,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302120624,Acute Observer,"[8, 9]","This story is based on the Scopes Trial, an event concocted to put Dayton Tennessee on the map. You can learn more by reading any book that summarizes this case. [I used the real names for historical accuracy.] Tennessee passed a law that banned the teaching of Darwinian evolution in public schools. Science teacher John Scopes announced he had violated this law as a protest. This test case created a lot of publicity in 1925. The film generally follows the trial, but the real event was more interesting than shown here. This fictionalized drama is for entertainment, not history. Bryan died after the trial ended, he didn't drop dead in court for symbolism!William Jennings Bryan made his reputation by supporting the policies that benefitted the nations farmers and laborers, and for woman suffrage. Bryan was the Democratic candidate in 1896 and 1900 against McKinley. When the corporate press banned him from their newspapers Bryan invented the whistle-stop campaign to speak directly to the people. Clarence Darrow had been a corporate lawyer until he supported labor unions around the time of the 1893 depression. Both had been allies in the past. Bryan came out of retirement to prosecute Scopes. The political question in this trial was whether the people would rule in a democracy or would be subject to the statements of politically controlled scientists. Darwin's slow evolution can never be proven in a laboratory or observed by a scientist. [Louis Agassiz, America's foremost scientist, was not a believer in Darwinian evolution.] Reporter Mencken's talk of ""boobs"" shows his contempt for ordinary people; this may reflect his personality or his corporate employer.This film dramatized the actual court case, and each side is given its innings. There was no question that the law was disobeyed. But should an unjust law be obeyed? The defense's attempt to bring in experts was disallowed by the judge. So Darrow put Bryan on the stand as an expert on the Bible. Bryan's answers showed he did not strictly follow a literal interpretation of the Bible. ""Days"" represented an era of time, not 24 hours. Bryan allowed an individual interpretation of the Bible. [Bryan believed in Prohibition, this did not come from the Bible!]At the end of the day Scopes was found guilty and fined. They appealed the verdict. Scopes got a scholarship to a university. Darrow went on to defend the underdog. Bryan wrote a speech to explain his stand, but died in his sleep. Bryan's wisdom is shown at that protest meeting where he warns against overzealousness. The basic question remains today: should any teacher present their knowledge to students when it goes beyond what the textbook offers? Are ever changing textbooks the final arbiter of truth in history and science? What do you believe in?Bryan won fame from his ""Cross of Gold"" speech. Do you know if the Banking Cartel is manipulating the money supply to slowly impoverish ordinary people?",5,Dramatization of the Scopes Trial,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2947,"['story', 'based', 'Scopes', 'Trial', 'event', 'concocted', 'put', 'Dayton', 'Tennessee', 'map', 'can', 'learn', 'more', 'reading', 'book', 'case', '[', 'used', 'real', 'names', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Tennessee', 'passed', 'law', 'banned', 'teaching', 'Darwinian', 'evolution', 'public', 'schools', 'Science', 'John', 'Scopes', 'announced', 'had', 'violated', 'law', 'protest', 'test', 'case', 'created', 'lot', 'publicity', '1925', 'film', 'generally', 'trial', 'real', 'event', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'shown', 'here', 'fictionalized', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'not', 'history', 'Bryan', 'died', 'trial', 'ended', 'did', ""n't"", 'drop', 'dead', 'court', 'symbolism', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'made', 'reputation', 'supporting', 'policies', 'benefitted', 'nations', 'farmers', 'laborers', 'woman', 'suffrage', 'Bryan', 'was', 'Democratic', 'candidate', '1896', '1900', 'McKinley', 'When', 'corporate', 'press', 'banned', 'newspapers', 'Bryan', 'invented', 'whistle-stop', 'campaign', 'speak', 'directly', 'people', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'had', 'been', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'supported', 'labor', 'unions', 'time', '1893', 'depression', 'had', 'been', 'allies', 'past', 'Bryan', 'came', 'retirement', 'prosecute', 'Scopes', 'political', 'question', 'trial', 'was', 'people', 'would', 'rule', 'democracy', 'would', 'be', 'subject', 'statements', 'politically', 'controlled', 'scientists', 'Darwin', 'slow', 'evolution', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'proven', 'laboratory', 'observed', 'scientist', 'Louis', 'Agassiz', 'America', 'foremost', 'scientist', 'was', 'not', 'believer', 'Darwinian', 'evolution', ']', 'Reporter', 'Mencken', 'talk', 'boobs', 'contempt', 'ordinary', 'people', 'may', 'reflect', 'personality', 'corporate', 'employer.This', 'film', 'dramatized', 'actual', 'court', 'case', 'side', 'given', 'innings', 'was', 'question', 'law', 'was', 'disobeyed', 'should', 'unjust', 'law', 'be', 'obeyed', 'defense', 'attempt', 'bring', 'experts', 'was', 'disallowed', 'judge', 'So', 'Darrow', 'put', 'Bryan', 'stand', 'expert', 'Bible', 'Bryan', 'answers', 'showed', 'did', 'not', 'strictly', 'follow', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'Bible', 'Days', 'represented', 'era', 'time', 'not', '24', 'hours', 'Bryan', 'allowed', 'individual', 'interpretation', 'Bible', '[', 'Bryan', 'believed', 'Prohibition', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'Bible', ']', 'end', 'day', 'Scopes', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'fined', 'appealed', 'verdict', 'Scopes', 'got', 'scholarship', 'university', 'Darrow', 'went', 'defend', 'underdog', 'Bryan', 'wrote', 'speech', 'explain', 'stand', 'died', 'sleep', 'Bryan', 'wisdom', 'shown', 'protest', 'meeting', 'where', 'overzealousness', 'basic', 'question', 'today', 'should', 'teacher', 'present', 'knowledge', 'students', 'when', 'what', 'textbook', 'offers', 'Are', 'ever', 'changing', 'final', 'arbiter', 'truth', 'history', 'science', 'What', 'do', 'believe', 'Bryan', 'won', 'fame', 'Cross', 'Gold', 'speech', 'Do', 'know', 'Banking', 'Cartel', 'manipulating', 'money', 'supply', 'slowly', 'impoverish', 'ordinary', 'people']",N/A

Its set in a courtroom, but for all the justiceand law in the film, it might as well be a courtroom inStalin's russia or Saddam Hussien's Iraq.From beginning to end, the facts in this film are changed tofit the message.  Which is that religion, god and anyonewho isn't at minimum an agnostic or (better) an Atheistis a clown and a fool and probably in need of a re-educationcamp.What you never see in this movie, for example, is the casethat Bryan made in various forums against the social implicationsof Darwinism.  The liberals and agnostics were not simplyconcerned with Darwinism as science, but Darwinism as aphilosophy of life.  In that philosphy, the concept of man andmorality, was replaced by the iron law called ""survival of thefittest"" or as the never-mentioned alternate title ofDarwin's book ""the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life"".  Darwinism was the phiosophical basisof Social Darwinism, Eugenics and many sick ideologies basedon the concept that all human life was a struggle forpreservation of race with no rules.We also don't see agnostic Clarence Darrow rampaging throughthe courtroom demanding that the Bible be removed from thecountroom and that no one should dare to pray in his presence.Kramer makes Darrow into the good rational nice man.  The goodman compared to Bryan the raving irrational lunatic who ideas(as created by Stanley Kramer) are obviously insane.Kramer also has no sense of the irony of the absurdity ofusing a courtroom to decide issues of religious belief andscience.  Its not the place of any court to decide mattersof science.  The court can decide if a law restricting theteaching of a subject is valid in the broad sense, but acourt cannot decide or place a value on a specific subjector announce to the world that evolution is truth.The abusurdity of the case is that any decision in the matterthat touches on the issue of evolution itself pushes thecourt toward an establishment of religion.  If the court rulesone way, it has endosed christianity, if it rules the other,it has made a move against christianity.The core of the film takes all the life and complexities outof Byran.  He is reduced to a pompous demagog who is fedarguments by Stanley Kramer while the real words of the manare forgotten.Meanwhile, real-life drunken moral degenerate adultererSpencer Tracy is played up as the kindly ""good american"" homespun man of the people who is the heart of good sense andreason.  His Darrow is about as far from the real thing asits possible to get.It would have been possible to make a good film about thissubject.  But to do so, the film-maker and writer has torespect both sides of the arguement at a minimum enoughso that both are allowed to make their case.But what Stanley Kramer set out to do was to make a vicious,untrue film where he got to ridicule his enemy (religiouspeople, people in middle america, ministers and anyonewho isn't agnostic or atheist) while the opposing side wasgagged and locked out of the courtroom.",1,Alternate Title: Stanley Kramer vs. God,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3132,"['Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'liberal', 'member', 'hollywood', 'elitewho', 'hated', 'america', 'also', 'hated', 'God', 'was', 'hisanti-God', 'epic', 'set', 'courtroom', 'justiceand', 'law', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'courtroom', 'inStalin', 'russia', 'Saddam', 'Hussien', 'Iraq.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'facts', 'film', 'are', 'changed', 'message', 'Which', 'religion', 'god', 'anyonewho', ""n't"", 'minimum', 'agnostic', 'better', 'Atheistis', 'clown', 'fool', 'probably', 'need', 're-educationcamp.What', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'example', 'casethat', 'Bryan', 'made', 'various', 'forums', 'social', 'implicationsof', 'Darwinism', 'liberals', 'agnostics', 'were', 'not', 'simplyconcerned', 'Darwinism', 'science', 'Darwinism', 'aphilosophy', 'life', 'philosphy', 'concept', 'man', 'andmorality', 'was', 'replaced', 'iron', 'law', 'called', 'survival', 'thefittest', 'never-mentioned', 'alternate', 'title', 'ofDarwin', 'book', 'Preservation', 'Favoured', 'Races', 'Struggle', 'Life', 'Darwinism', 'was', 'phiosophical', 'basisof', 'Social', 'Darwinism', 'Eugenics', 'many', 'sick', 'ideologies', 'basedon', 'concept', 'human', 'life', 'was', 'struggle', 'forpreservation', 'race', 'rules.We', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'agnostic', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'rampaging', 'throughthe', 'courtroom', 'demanding', 'Bible', 'be', 'removed', 'thecountroom', 'one', 'should', 'dare', 'pray', 'presence.Kramer', 'Darrow', 'good', 'rational', 'nice', 'man', 'goodman', 'compared', 'Bryan', 'raving', 'irrational', 'lunatic', 'who', 'ideas', 'created', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'are', 'obviously', 'insane.Kramer', 'also', 'sense', 'irony', 'absurdity', 'ofusing', 'courtroom', 'decide', 'issues', 'religious', 'belief', 'andscience', 'not', 'place', 'court', 'decide', 'mattersof', 'science', 'court', 'can', 'decide', 'law', 'restricting', 'theteaching', 'subject', 'valid', 'broad', 'sense', 'acourt', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'place', 'value', 'specific', 'subjector', 'announce', 'world', 'evolution', 'truth.The', 'abusurdity', 'case', 'decision', 'matterthat', 'issue', 'evolution', 'thecourt', 'establishment', 'religion', 'court', 'rulesone', 'way', 'endosed', 'christianity', 'rules', 'other', 'made', 'move', 'christianity.The', 'core', 'film', 'life', 'complexities', 'outof', 'Byran', 'reduced', 'pompous', 'demagog', 'who', 'fedarguments', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'real', 'words', 'manare', 'forgotten.Meanwhile', 'real-life', 'drunken', 'moral', 'degenerate', 'adultererSpencer', 'Tracy', 'played', 'up', 'kindly', 'good', 'american', 'homespun', 'man', 'people', 'who', 'heart', 'good', 'sense', 'andreason', 'Darrow', 'far', 'real', 'thing', 'asits', 'possible', 'get.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'thissubject', 'do', 'so', 'film-maker', 'writer', 'torespect', 'sides', 'arguement', 'minimum', 'enoughso', 'are', 'allowed', 'make', 'case.But', 'what', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'was', 'make', 'vicious', 'untrue', 'film', 'where', 'got', 'ridicule', 'enemy', 'religiouspeople', 'people', 'middle', 'america', 'ministers', 'anyonewho', ""n't"", 'agnostic', 'atheist', 'opposing', 'side', 'wasgagged', 'locked', 'courtroom']",N/A

Just in case you want to compare the truth, let me quote the Oxford Desk Encyclopedia of World History:""Scopes case (July 1925) The US legal case in which John T. Scopes, a biology teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, was charged with violating state law by teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. The state legislature had enacted (1925) that it was unlawful to teach any doctrine denying the literal truth of the account of the creation as presented in the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible. The judge ruled out any discussion of constitutional legality, and since Scopes clearly had taught Darwin's theory of evolution he was convicted and fined $100. On appeal to the Supreme Court the constitutionality of the state's law was upheld, but Scopes was acquitted on the technicality that he had been 'fined excessively'. The law was repealed in 1967. However, Christian fundamentalists in the USA continue to campaign vigorously for a return to creationist teaching.""In this movie, the names are changed, and certain dramatic elements (such as the defendant's romance with the local preacher's daughter) are involved which cannot be verified as true. But much of what was depicted in this film was true, in spirit if not in detail. The marches and rallies got pretty hostile, as I recall (no, I'm not that old; we learned about it in school, however), as represented in the movie. Also, it was a great commercial boon for the town, as reporters and sightseers poured in for the trial.The main story is the dramatic courtroom battle between Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) for the prosecution and Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) for the defense. In real life, it was William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow. As in the real world, a well-known and cynical reporter (obviously H.L. Mencken) played by Gene Kelly had his newspaper pay for the defense due to the sensational nature of the story. The Bible Belt judge (played by Henry Morgan) did set the fine at $100, as mentioned in the encyclopedia article. Drummond swore to appeal it, as the encyclopedia mentions was done. But I don't think Matthew Harrison Brady's death from the stress of the trial was paralleled by William Jennings Bryan.In any case, it is a story with enough relation to the reality to make it interesting, and the comment by the [British] encyclopedia points out the relevance today: ""Christian fundamentalists in the USA continue to campaign vigorously for a return to creationist teaching.""

Brady said, ""Remember the wisdom of Solomon in the book of Proverbs.

Two great lawyers argued that case: Clarence Darrow for the defense and Wiliam Jennings Bryan for the prosecution.  H.L. Mencken of the Baltimore Evening Sun was the real life E. K. Hornbeck.

It is tricky to keep the differences between this play and the real trial apart in one's mind.  Spencer Tracy (Henry Drummond) and Fredric March (Matthew Harrison Brady) spar over the legality of teaching of evolution in Tennessee. This combination is guaranteed to keep you glued to your seat.  In this movie Scopes, while teaching evolution to a high-school biology class is arrested and placed in jail.Some time the other characters get lost in the shuffle yet one other will show through.

The Scopes trial was a publicity stunt that had a limited effect, and muted participants.9. It demonstrates how ensemble acting reflects a libertarian society to which we can all strive.8. Type-casting and against-type-casting are equally balanced.7. It lifts reasoning up by way of demonstration, i.e., proof.6. The anti-McCarthyism points were not obvious, but are still merited.5. Points of view are shown to be what they are, ever-changing.4. The core issue of the place of religion in science is not lost, but made clear.3. The best and worst in religion and science are scored easily by centering on the people who apply them, their selfishness, and thier selflessness, both shown for effect.2. A rarely seen, important point is made at the end:Atheists can believe in God. It is not that complicated. God does not exist. But I believe in God anyway. Why. Because faith is in essence the human imagination, and the faculty of reason provides enough meat that faith can be the candy. Belief does not have to be reasonable, it is all in your head anyway. That is what faith is, believing in what you know is not so, for comfort, pragmatically. The sinner is ""Without God"". The bible says that we are all ""Seperate from"", or ""Without God."" Atheism means "" Without God."" We are all atheists, believing if we choose, in god, by way of faith, the imagination, because it helps us to get along with each other, rather that obeying more powerful people overtly. Simple.1. Finally, the character of Drummond comes across with a point that must be restated repeatedly:The Bible is a good book, but not the only one. It contains many truths, but it does not need to be true in order to carry those truths.There is so much in this film that provokes great thought, I just cannot ""Praise it enough.""",5,"Ten Reasons to Watch, Learn and Evolve",1068076800,"11 6, 2003",2003,1832,"['10', 'issues', 'history', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'was', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'had', 'limited', 'effect', 'muted', 'participants.9', 'how', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'libertarian', 'society', 'can', 'strive.8', 'Type-casting', 'against-type-casting', 'are', 'equally', 'balanced.7', 'reasoning', 'up', 'way', 'demonstration', 'i.e.', 'proof.6', 'anti-McCarthyism', 'points', 'were', 'not', 'obvious', 'are', 'still', 'merited.5', 'Points', 'view', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'ever-changing.4', 'core', 'issue', 'place', 'religion', 'science', 'not', 'lost', 'made', 'clear.3', 'best', 'worst', 'religion', 'science', 'are', 'scored', 'easily', 'centering', 'people', 'who', 'apply', 'selfishness', 'thier', 'selflessness', 'shown', 'effect.2', 'rarely', 'seen', 'important', 'point', 'made', 'end', 'Atheists', 'can', 'believe', 'God', 'not', 'complicated', 'God', 'not', 'exist', 'believe', 'God', 'anyway', 'Why', 'faith', 'essence', 'human', 'imagination', 'faculty', 'reason', 'enough', 'meat', 'faith', 'can', 'be', 'candy', 'Belief', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'reasonable', 'head', 'anyway', 'what', 'faith', 'believing', 'what', 'know', 'not', 'so', 'comfort', 'pragmatically', 'sinner', 'God', 'bible', 'are', 'Seperate', 'God', 'Atheism', 'God', 'are', 'atheists', 'believing', 'choose', 'god', 'way', 'faith', 'imagination', 'get', 'along', 'other', 'rather', 'obeying', 'more', 'powerful', 'people', 'overtly', 'Simple.1', 'Finally', 'character', 'Drummond', 'point', 'must', 'be', 'restated', 'repeatedly', 'Bible', 'good', 'book', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'truths', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'true', 'order', 'carry', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'great', 'thought', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'Praise', 'enough']",N/A

And they raise the standard to such a high level! Credits must be given to the director Kramer, the cinematographer and the inspiring hymns.Spencer Tracy was fierce, determined as ever. Like Bad Day at Black Rock, he is the lone man fighting for a cause. Here he has the upper hand, judging from his quick response and angle in the court. He plays the lone crusader and the underdog excellently. However, it is Fredrick March that impresses me even more. If you see Dr. Jerkll and Mr. Hyde, The best year of our lives, you will see how much he has changed for this role. If anything is flawed, it will be the make up for the baldness and wrinkles. However, his effort to portray the attorney with insatiable appetite, loud speech and thirst to advance his cause for the fundamental christians is undeniable. It is so un-Federick March! That said, it is a rare gem to see the two two-time Oscar winners, Tracy and March, opposite one another in the court. Another surprise is Gene Kelly. I wish to see more of him in non-dancing roles.What makes the movie so special is that the script is so tightly woven and lines so well-crafted. It is unfortunate there is no subtitles. The movie should be shown in the classrooms for open discussions. Not to say which is right or wrong (for that matter, I do not think anyone can retrieve any new arguments which can change people's mind on christinaity vs evolution), but more to say that a person should believe in something deep, in themselves, rather than blindly follow a person. Even the idea or the person has a flaw found, one can still be themselves and not be lost. This is what convictions and giants are for.

This is an adaption of the (Thomas) Scopes Monkey trial in Tennessee during the 1920s.  Clarence Darrow the best of attorneys from Chicago, chose this case allowing, hopefully, common sense the freedom of speech by educators in classrooms.  It was a sensational trial and Darrow took it pro bono.  The character filling in for Darrow was the portrayal made as brilliant as Darrow taking the name Henry Drummond played by Spencer Tracy, while Williams Jennings Bryant, AKA  Matthew Harrison Brady for the adaptation was profoundly portrayed by the equally great American actor, Frederick March.  Together these two men bring thought and thinking and rationality to its feet.  Gene Kelly, a cynical newsman, reports from the courtroom denying that &#34;Brady&#34; should be held high, his politics stinks and his understanding of the world in which he lived went lacking.  Brady was made into hash by Tracy's Drummond, but through it all he would have defended anyone's right to freedom of speech, indicating that, with Freedom of Speech comes responsibility.  Clearly Stanley Kramer brought a great story and an excellent cast together to add a classic view of why science and religion can live side by side without declaring either correct and the other wrong.  &#34;Science is that which allows us to see and understand the past while planning and expanding upon a future,&#34; &#34;Religion is faith, an important and valued indication that man has the right to believe there may well be something more to the universe.&#34;  Great story, good film.",4,Inherit the Wind,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,1680,"['Classic', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'film', 'Black', 'white', 'work', 'brilliant', 'proportions', 'absent', 'larger', 'more', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'adaption', 'Thomas', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'trial', 'Tennessee', '1920s', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'best', 'attorneys', 'Chicago', 'chose', 'case', 'allowing', 'hopefully', 'common', 'sense', 'freedom', 'speech', 'educators', 'classrooms', 'was', 'sensational', 'trial', 'Darrow', 'took', 'pro', 'bono', 'character', 'filling', 'Darrow', 'was', 'portrayal', 'made', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Darrow', 'taking', 'name', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'played', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Williams', 'Jennings', 'Bryant', 'AKA', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'adaptation', 'was', 'profoundly', 'portrayed', 'equally', 'great', 'American', 'actor', 'Frederick', 'March', 'Together', 'two', 'men', 'bring', 'thought', 'thinking', 'rationality', 'feet', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'cynical', 'newsman', 'reports', 'courtroom', 'denying', '34', 'Brady', '34', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'high', 'politics', 'stinks', 'understanding', 'world', 'lived', 'went', 'lacking', 'Brady', 'was', 'made', 'hash', 'Tracy', 'Drummond', 'would', 'have', 'defended', 'anyone', 'right', 'freedom', 'speech', 'indicating', 'Freedom', 'Speech', 'responsibility', 'Clearly', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'brought', 'great', 'story', 'excellent', 'cast', 'together', 'add', 'classic', 'view', 'why', 'science', 'religion', 'can', 'live', 'side', 'side', 'declaring', 'correct', 'other', 'wrong', '34', 'Science', 'see', 'understand', 'past', 'planning', 'expanding', 'future', '34', '34', 'Religion', 'faith', 'important', 'valued', 'indication', 'man', 'right', 'believe', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'universe.', '34', 'Great', 'story', 'good', 'film']",N/A

Gripping courtroom drama, fierce debates, ugly namecalling and bigotry, and tender human compassion are manifested again and again.  The fabric of &quot;interpretation&quot; is woven into the story, very gently suggesting that in order to grow as a society we must challenge that which is taken for granted, be it Creationism or evolution.

296936,A31YZPP738T2EB,6302120624,"Dustin Dunaway ""Cool Channel Films""","[21, 26]","First, I have to dispel some of the myths about the movie purported not only by reviewers on this site, but mainstream film reviewers and social commentators.1. It's true that a consortium of Dayton (Hillsboro) businessmen hired Scopes (Cates) to 'take the fall' because it would mean a boon to the local economy, but there were also a number of people opposed to the teaching of evolution that thought the trial was a sham and let it be known.  The insults and threats were hurled from both sides.  The film is a dramatization from Cates and Drummond's point of view.  The threats and intimidation are shown to make Cates a sympathetic character and present him in the light of an underdog with the world against him. To quote Matthew Harrison Brady, ""If St. George had killed a dragonfly instead of a dragon, who would remember him?""2. Also, ""...Young Earthism wasn't a factor in the Scopes trial.""Here is the direct transcript from Day 7 of the Scopes trial (Darrow examines Bryan):Q--Have you any idea how old the earth is?A--No.Q--The Book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it?A--I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow.Q--Let's see whether it does; is this the one?A--That is the one, I think.Q--It says B.C. 4004?A--That is Bishop Usher's calculation.Q--That is printed in the Bible you introduced?A--Yes, sir....Q--Would you say that the earth was only 4,000 years old?A--Oh, no; I think it is much older than that.Q--How much?A--I couldn't say.Q--Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that?A--I don't think it is older or not.The point of Darrow's (Drummond's) cross-examination was not whether or not the earth is 6000 or 6,000,000 years old, but to get Bryan (Brady) to admit the possibility that there may be inaccuracies in the Bible (exactly the same thing Scopes did).3. ""In court transcripts, the evolutionists open (openly?) spoke of their racist views..."".  I can't find anything to support or refute this statement.  In fact, the Judge excluded all expert testimony relating to the origin of man and life (both in the film and trial).  If that's the case, then the only racist statements that could be entered would be by Darrow or Scopes or by prosecution witnesses.  Check out Drummond's speech about ""...turning Catholic against Protestant and Protestant against Protestant"".  It's Darrow's speech nearly word for word and shows the feelings of the man.  It's hard to believe that he would have approved of the Third Reich after hearing or reading this.4. ""The evolutionists won the court case.  False.  They lost"".  I have to wonder if the reviewer watched the end of the movie.  SPOILER: Cates and Drummond do lose the case.  Cates is fined $100 and Drummond says that they have no intention of paying and will challenge the ruling.The Final Verdict: Like any movie ""Based on a True Story"",  Inherit the Wind is bound to stir up controversy over whether or not it really happened that way.Stephen King once wrote a review of ""The Amityville Horror"" in which he said that the mere medium of film makes the story fiction and not fact.  That's the case here.  Inherit the Wind is written from a certain point of view (just like this review, and the review before mine, and the review before that) and points of view are just that -- points of view.As for the movie itself, what more can be said?  The non-trial dialogue is crisp and brilliant  (Kelly's line to the woman who offers him a nice, clean place to stay always brings a smile to my face).  March and Tracy are appropriately titanic in the courtroom and low-key in the rest (the porch scene, specifically).  Stanley Kramer's direction is spot-on, getting close-ups at the right time and pulling back to reveal the packed courtroom at others (look for the canted and off-center frames during the prayer meeting).The DVD looks just fine, preserving the aspect ratio is very important to a film like Inherit the Wind which uses the frame to tell a story.  I could have used some extras (comparison of the real life trial and the movie).  The extas are a minor point, though, the film is enough.Inherit the Wind is a brilliant film based on a brilliant play based on a factual trial between two brilliant legal minds.  That is all that I, as a viewer, can ask.",5,Fact or fiction,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,4267,"['First', 'have', 'dispel', 'myths', 'movie', 'purported', 'not', 'only', 'reviewers', 'site', 'mainstream', 'film', 'reviewers', 'social', 'commentators.1', 'true', 'consortium', 'Dayton', 'Hillsboro', 'businessmen', 'hired', 'Scopes', 'Cates', ""'take"", 'fall', 'would', 'mean', 'boon', 'local', 'economy', 'were', 'also', 'number', 'people', 'opposed', 'teaching', 'evolution', 'thought', 'trial', 'was', 'sham', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'insults', 'threats', 'were', 'hurled', 'sides', 'film', 'dramatization', 'Cates', 'Drummond', 'point', 'view', 'threats', 'intimidation', 'are', 'shown', 'make', 'Cates', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'present', 'light', 'underdog', 'world', 'quote', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'St.', 'George', 'had', 'killed', 'dragonfly', 'instead', 'dragon', 'who', 'would', 'remember', '2', 'Also', 'Young', 'Earthism', 'was', ""n't"", 'factor', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'Here', 'direct', 'transcript', 'Day', '7', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'Darrow', 'Bryan', 'Q', 'Have', 'idea', 'how', 'old', 'earth', 'No.Q', 'Book', 'have', 'introduced', 'evidence', 'tells', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mr.', 'Darrow.Q', 'Let', 'see', 'one', 'one', 'think.Q', 'B.C', '4004', 'Bishop', 'Usher', 'calculation.Q', 'printed', 'Bible', 'introduced', 'Yes', 'sir', '.Q', 'say', 'earth', 'was', 'only', '4,000', 'years', 'old', 'Oh', 'think', 'much', 'older', 'that.Q', 'How', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'say.Q', 'Do', 'say', 'Bible', 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'older', 'not.The', 'point', 'Darrow', 'Drummond', 'cross-examination', 'was', 'not', 'not', 'earth', '6000', '6,000,000', 'years', 'old', 'get', 'Bryan', 'Brady', 'admit', 'possibility', 'may', 'be', 'inaccuracies', 'Bible', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'Scopes', 'did', '.3', 'court', 'transcripts', 'evolutionists', 'open', 'openly', 'spoke', 'racist', 'views', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'support', 'refute', 'statement', 'fact', 'Judge', 'excluded', 'expert', 'testimony', 'relating', 'origin', 'man', 'life', 'film', 'trial', 'case', 'then', 'only', 'racist', 'statements', 'could', 'be', 'entered', 'would', 'be', 'Darrow', 'Scopes', 'prosecution', 'witnesses', 'Check', 'out', 'Drummond', 'speech', 'turning', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'Protestant', 'Protestant', 'Darrow', 'speech', 'nearly', 'word', 'word', 'feelings', 'man', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'approved', 'Third', 'Reich', 'hearing', 'reading', 'this.4', 'evolutionists', 'won', 'court', 'case', 'False', 'lost', 'have', 'wonder', 'reviewer', 'watched', 'end', 'movie', 'SPOILER', 'Cates', 'Drummond', 'do', 'lose', 'case', 'Cates', 'fined', '100', 'Drummond', 'have', 'intention', 'paying', 'will', 'challenge', 'ruling.The', 'Final', 'Verdict', 'movie', 'Based', 'True', 'Story', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'bound', 'stir', 'up', 'controversy', 'not', 'really', 'happened', 'way.Stephen', 'King', 'once', 'wrote', 'review', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'said', 'mere', 'medium', 'film', 'story', 'fiction', 'not', 'fact', 'case', 'here', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'written', 'certain', 'point', 'view', 'just', 'review', 'review', 'mine', 'review', 'points', 'view', 'are', 'just', 'points', 'view.As', 'movie', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'non-trial', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'brilliant', 'Kelly', 'line', 'woman', 'who', 'nice', 'clean', 'place', 'stay', 'always', 'smile', 'face', 'March', 'Tracy', 'are', 'appropriately', 'titanic', 'courtroom', 'low-key', 'rest', 'porch', 'scene', 'specifically', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'direction', 'spot-on', 'getting', 'close-ups', 'right', 'time', 'pulling', 'back', 'reveal', 'packed', 'courtroom', 'others', 'look', 'canted', 'off-center', 'frames', 'prayer', 'meeting', '.The', 'DVD', 'just', 'fine', 'preserving', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'frame', 'tell', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'extras', 'comparison', 'real', 'life', 'trial', 'movie', 'extas', 'are', 'minor', 'point', 'film', 'Wind', 'brilliant', 'film', 'based', 'brilliant', 'play', 'based', 'factual', 'trial', 'two', 'brilliant', 'legal', 'minds', 'viewer', 'can', 'ask']",N/A

296938,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,6302120624,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[4, 4]","""Inherit the Wind"" is Stanley Kramer's Oscar-winning, black and white, recreation of the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 in Dayton, TN. This dramatized version pits two American legal collossus' against each other played by two collosal actors of their day--Spencer Tracy and Frederic March playing the characters Henry Drummond and Matthew Brady respectively. The character, Henry Drummond was the real-life, renowned barrister Clarence Darrow, and Matthew Harrison Brady is based upon the  three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Brian, a populist whose oratory was unparalleled in his day. He was also first to conduct a modern campaign for office.The remaining cast of character actors are instantly recognizable from TV shows and movies of the 1950's and early 60's with the exception of Gene Kelly who made a rare dramatic appearance as the Bible-hating journalist, H.L. Mencken. Dick York plays the teacher who is arrested for teaching the theory of Evolution, and Harry Morgan, who was typecast earlier as Detective Bill Gannon and since as Colonel Potter, plays the judge. Claude Aiken, another typecast-as-tough-guy is less believable as a fundamentalist minister who ""troubles his own house.""This is a powerful dramatization of the Scopes Trial that is a tour de force for dialogue, comedy, and sheer performance--yes comedy. Despite the gravity of the trial, it is amusing to hear Henry Drummond wryly suggest that Matthew Harrison Brady not be referred to by his honorary title of colonel. He suggests to the judge, ""Break'im. Make him a private. I have no objection to him being called Private Brady.""  When you watch Henry Drummond examine the prosecutor and witness Matthew Brady, it is nothing short of jolts of juristic electricity. When you hear the words, ""My client wishes to be accorded the same privilege of a sponge; he wishes to THINK,"" you are hearing a script that resonates with emotion against fanaticism.There is dramatic license in every recreation of an actual event, and this movie takes it wherever it can, but it is the kind of license that can make the viewer more curious about the real event. It is also just plain entertainment that never wears thin.The jury is not out on this one. We find in favor of the movie.Review adjourned.P. S. The trial was too much for William Jennings Bryan who had an enormous appetite. His food intake, the heat, the strain, and age caught up with him five days after the trial when he would collapse and die. His days of helping states pass anti-Darwin legislation for education came to an abrupt end.P. P. S. The conviction was overturned but not because the law was judged unconstitutional.

296939,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6302120624,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[6, 8]","Too many have dissected this true classic, loosely based on the Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial in Tennessee back in the 1920s. Spencer Tracy plays a brilliant variation on Clarence Darrow. Therefore, I have only a couple of (I hope) fresh observations:1. This film really breathes life. I wish I had some idea of where and how it was filmed. The thoughtfulness of it is Kurosawa-esque.2. Frederic March as Brady-the-weird-politician is most annoying. Like most politicians, one cannot really get a feel for this man's motives, or decide whether one likes or hates him.3. I wonder how many people realize Frederic March was the first actor to make a huge splash as Dr. Jekyll...and about a decade later, Tracy took a shot at the role too.4. The addition of Gene Kelly as the obnoxious newspaper reporter is most unnecessary and takes away from this film. He makes pathetic attempts at Groucho Marx one-liners in certain parts of the film. Awful. Otherwise he does a great job in this film as the representative of America's true conscience.5. I believe every person in America should watch this film...especially the younger audience who knows nothing about anything. The nasty Christian right-wing in this country is clearly nothing new...kids should see this behavior for themselves, and this film does a grand job. What is most frightening is Tracy's character is so accepting of it, and the young teacher (a nice early performance by Dick Sargent) is himself a (moderate) Bible-thumper.Very pertinent to today is the trial itself: creationism vs. evolution (or, rather, Darwinism, which I always liked better as a term anyway). I'd be willing to bet that the modern Christian right hates this film today as much as they probably did when it was first released.6. I wonder if the death scene of Ole Man Brady is based on a real event during the Scopes trial.Enjoy this masterful, never-to-be-repeated cinematic marvel.",5,Perhaps A Sponge Thinks More Than We,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,1911,"['Too', 'many', 'have', 'dissected', 'true', 'classic', 'loosely', 'based', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'Tennessee', 'back', '1920s', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'brilliant', 'variation', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'Therefore', 'have', 'only', 'couple', 'hope', 'fresh', 'observations:1', 'film', 'really', 'life', 'wish', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'thoughtfulness', 'Kurosawa-esque.2', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Brady-the-weird-politician', 'most', 'annoying', 'most', 'politicians', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'man', 'motives', 'decide', 'one', 'likes', 'hates', 'him.3', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'realize', 'Frederic', 'March', 'was', 'first', 'actor', 'make', 'huge', 'splash', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'decade', 'later', 'Tracy', 'took', 'shot', 'role', 'too.4', 'addition', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'obnoxious', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'away', 'film', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'one-liners', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'Awful', 'Otherwise', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'representative', 'America', 'true', 'conscience.5', 'believe', 'person', 'America', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'especially', 'younger', 'audience', 'who', 'nothing', 'anything', 'nasty', 'Christian', 'right-wing', 'country', 'clearly', 'nothing', 'new', 'kids', 'should', 'see', 'behavior', 'film', 'grand', 'job', 'What', 'most', 'frightening', 'Tracy', 'character', 'so', 'accepting', 'young', 'teacher', 'nice', 'early', 'performance', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'moderate', 'Bible-thumper.Very', 'pertinent', 'today', 'trial', 'creationism', 'vs.', 'evolution', 'rather', 'Darwinism', 'always', 'liked', 'better', 'term', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'modern', 'Christian', 'right', 'film', 'today', 'as', 'much', 'probably', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.6', 'wonder', 'death', 'scene', 'Ole', 'Man', 'Brady', 'based', 'real', 'event', 'Scopes', 'trial.Enjoy', 'masterful', 'never-to-be-repeated', 'cinematic', 'marvel']",N/A

The famous Scopes Monkey Trial took place in Tennessee and was brought to the attention of the world because a teacher was put on trial for teaching Darwinism in the classroom.  It was, back then, against the law to teach anything that would go against the Bible, but biology was becoming more and more accepting towards the theory of evolution across the nation.Inherit the Wind takes the story, changes a few names, and delivers an incredibly dynamic and beautiful movie that is still relevant today as it was back in the 60s.  With juggernaut actors such as Spender Tracy, Fredric March, and Gene Kelly, we cannot help but thing upon glancing at the cover that this will be a good film.  Thankfully, it doesn't disappoint.The language, alone, is enough to melt hearts, make people laugh, and raise eyebrows.  The dialogue is absolutely perfect and you will find yourself in love with E. K. Hammond's character and cheering for Henry Drummond.  The movie focuses on them along with the character of Matthew Harrison Brady as opposed to the teacher who is played by Dick York.  The battle scenes are in the courtroom and just as exciting as if it were a war movie.What's most inspiring about the film is that although it is based on a story that's almost 90 years old and a movie that is 54 years old it is still relevant.  The worry about what is being taught, or not taught, in the classrooms is always a concern and, as a teacher myself, the worry that great minds are being squandered by technology and lack of respect/motivation is a constant complaint throughout many schools today.An enlightening, influential, and sarcastic-laden film worthy of anyone to watch once if not frequently.",5,Perfection of History and Language,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1815,"['famous', 'legal', 'case', '1925', 'put', 'more', 'accessible', 'version', 'textbook', 'rendition', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'famous', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'took', 'place', 'Tennessee', 'was', 'brought', 'attention', 'world', 'teacher', 'was', 'put', 'trial', 'teaching', 'Darwinism', 'classroom', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'law', 'teach', 'anything', 'would', 'go', 'Bible', 'biology', 'was', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'accepting', 'theory', 'evolution', 'nation.Inherit', 'Wind', 'story', 'few', 'names', 'delivers', 'incredibly', 'dynamic', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', 'back', '60s', 'juggernaut', 'actors', 'such', 'Spender', 'Tracy', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'thing', 'glancing', 'cover', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'disappoint.The', 'language', 'alone', 'enough', 'melt', 'hearts', 'make', 'people', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'dialogue', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'will', 'find', 'love', 'E.', 'K.', 'Hammond', 'character', 'cheering', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'movie', 'along', 'character', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'opposed', 'teacher', 'who', 'played', 'Dick', 'York', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'courtroom', 'just', 'as', 'exciting', 'were', 'war', 'movie.What', 'most', 'inspiring', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'almost', '90', 'years', 'old', 'movie', '54', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'relevant', 'worry', 'what', 'being', 'taught', 'not', 'taught', 'classrooms', 'always', 'concern', 'teacher', 'worry', 'great', 'minds', 'are', 'being', 'squandered', 'technology', 'lack', 'respect/motivation', 'constant', 'complaint', 'many', 'schools', 'today.An', 'enlightening', 'influential', 'sarcastic-laden', 'film', 'worthy', 'anyone', 'watch', 'once', 'not', 'frequently']",N/A

296944,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302120624,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 5]","The so-called ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" occurred in 1925 Dayton, Tennessee and was essentially a hoax.The state wanted a test-case to see if a recently enacted law against teaching Dawin's theory would hold up in court. The test was arranged by the American Civil Liberties Union; Scopes, who was actually a coach that taught the occasional science class, agreed to say he had broken the law for the sake of the test; the town cashed in on the media circus; and the legal wrangling was left to Clarence Darrow for the defense and William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution.  Darrow did indeed call Bryan to the witness stand as an expert on the Bible, but their exchange was more friendly than acrimonious, and the next day the judge deemed Bryan's testimony irrelevant and threw it out.  Scopes was convicted and the case was appealed to the state Supreme Court, which threw out the conviction on a technicality and expressed a desire that everyone would shut the hell up and go home.  (One of the state Supreme Court Judges described the case as ""bizarre."")  The case was not retried and ten years later everybody but pop historians had forgotten all about it.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, however, Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Unamerican Activities Committee began a series of witch-hunts for communists in the country, and as their reign of terror intensified the issue of what could and could not be taught in the public schools once more came to the fore.  Playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee--who would also write another great play of the era, AUNTIE MAME--seized on the Scopes Monkey Trial and used it as a model for the battle over freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and what could and should be taught in the classroom.  The result was the play INHERIT THE WIND, and in 1955 when the play debuted there wasn't a person who didn't instantly know it was a metaphor for Senator McCarthy and like-minded individuals. But by the time 1960 rolled around Senator McCarthy and his minions were a thing of the past--and the play was interpreted strictly as a battle between narrow-minded Christians who didn't want Darwin taught and more liberal, perhaps even agnostic or atheist scientists who felt that to ignore Darwin's theories was akin to ignoring algebra or geometery.Certainly this is the case with the 1960 film, which stars two of Hollywood's greatest actors: Spenser Tracy, as Drummond (modeled on Darrow) and Frederich March as Brady (modeled on Bryan.)  The play had taken a lot of liberties with the actual facts of the Scopes trial and the film took even more.  The film opens with school teacher Bert Cates (Dick York), arrested in front of his students--and both he and his fiancee Rachel (Donna Anderson) give fine performances, along with a cast of notables ranging from Henry Morgan to Gene Kelly to Florence Eldridge to Claude Akins.  But the real interest in INHERIT THE WIND is in the confrontation between Drummond and Brady, and it is here that director Stanley Kramer slips up a bit.  The characters of the play are somewhat stark; Kramer's film, however, takes great pains to humanize all of them, and in consequence the play's hard, uncompromising edges are softened.  Both Spencer Tracy and Frederick March, two of the greatest film actors of the 20th Century, play out their confrontation brillantly, but somehow it lacks the straight-to-the-gut punch one expects.As a director, Kramer tends to be somewhat obvious and, by today's standards, a bit clunky--and this is certainly evident in INHERIT THE WIND.

Or better yet, Smithfield vs. Proscuitto. Spencer Tracy is among my very favorite actors, in part because there was always a delightful bit of one-upsmanship to his style. That ability to dominate a scene was rarely more tested than when he matched wits with the wonderfully over-the-top Fredric March. The latter throws grandiose haymakers throughout the film, only to be consistently undercut by Tracy's trademark ""underplaying,"" which was often overplaying in a clever disguise. That may sound illogical, but you have to watch a few of his films to get a sense for how routinely and effectively he did it. He was good at it. Gable wasn't kidding when he called him ""the best we've got.""As for the history on display, well, better to read a book. The script plays loose with the facts, and Kramer pounds his moral points home with a large hammer (as he was wont to do). And there is little to be said for Gene Kelly's rather strident and too-knowingly-cynical turn as a sharp-tongued reporter.

296962,AW3I97UR8NP7T,6302120624,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[7, 8]","This is the second in my ""series"" of films for which I am truly thankful, the problem with that being that it is the first one that most of you will be reading. Such is life. In my first review, which was actually more of a thumbnail appreciation of the original production of THE THING (a film that literally shaped the rest of my life), I mentioned that there was another film that had taught me an important lesson at the age of 12, one that I hope I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Well, INHERIT THE WIND is that film.Directed by Stanley Kramer, INHERIT THE WIND gives us a very fictionalized account of the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial in which a man was tried and convicted for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution in a Tennessee school. Virtually all of the names and locations have been changed as have many of the pertinent facts because this was never intended to be anything more than a work of historical fiction through which the director and the screenwriters expressed their points of view. I do admit as I've looked back on it over the years that it does come down a bit harshly on the anti-evolution Christian segment, but then they were never intended to portray actual people as much as they were meant to represent the generalized sentiment held by a large segment of society at that time and in that place. The pro-evolution forces are not without their warts--Gene Kelly's newspaper reporter is an extremely obnoxious character who supposedly represents H.L. Mencken who covered the actual trial. He's abrasive,crude,and a symbol of everything that's wrong with the so called ""intellectual elite"".As I said earlier this is not a review per se. I merely want to tell you why I am thankful for this particular film. So here goes. At the end of the film Spencer Tracy who has been representing the defendant prepares to leave the courthouse for the last time. He gathers up all of his papers and the copy of Darwin's book he has been using for reference during the trial. Then he spots a copy of the Bible on the table. He picks it up, and holding Darwin's book in one hand and the Bible in the other he seems to  be weighing them against each other as if to see which one is physically heavier. Finally he simply puts them together and walks out of the courthouse with them both. What I took from this scene  and from the film itself was that it was never necessary to completely discard one thing in order to embrace another, and that seemingly disparate ideas could co-exist as long as the mind that held them was willing to contain them both. Creationism vs Evolution, Christianity vs Atheism are like seeing things as black white when everything is really in Technicolor.",5,A Black and White Movie For a Technicolor World,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",2008,2708,"['second', 'series', 'films', 'am', 'truly', 'thankful', 'problem', 'being', 'first', 'one', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'reading', 'Such', 'life', 'first', 'review', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'thumbnail', 'appreciation', 'original', 'production', 'THE', 'THING', 'film', 'literally', 'shaped', 'rest', 'life', 'mentioned', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'taught', 'important', 'lesson', 'age', '12', 'one', 'hope', 'will', 'carry', 'rest', 'life', 'Well', 'INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', 'film.Directed', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', 'very', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'infamous', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'man', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'teaching', 'Darwin', 'theory', 'evolution', 'Tennessee', 'school', 'Virtually', 'names', 'locations', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'have', 'many', 'pertinent', 'facts', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'work', 'historical', 'fiction', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'expressed', 'points', 'view', 'do', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'back', 'years', 'come', 'down', 'bit', 'harshly', 'anti-evolution', 'Christian', 'segment', 'then', 'were', 'never', 'intended', 'portray', 'actual', 'people', 'as', 'much', 'were', 'meant', 'represent', 'generalized', 'sentiment', 'held', 'large', 'segment', 'society', 'time', 'place', 'pro-evolution', 'forces', 'are', 'not', 'warts', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'extremely', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'who', 'supposedly', 'H.L', 'Mencken', 'who', 'covered', 'actual', 'trial', 'abrasive', 'crude', 'symbol', 'everything', 'wrong', 'so', 'called', 'intellectual', 'elite', '.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'not', 'review', 'se', 'merely', 'want', 'tell', 'why', 'am', 'thankful', 'particular', 'film', 'So', 'here', 'end', 'film', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'who', 'been', 'representing', 'defendant', 'leave', 'courthouse', 'last', 'time', 'up', 'papers', 'copy', 'Darwin', 'book', 'been', 'using', 'reference', 'trial', 'Then', 'copy', 'Bible', 'table', 'up', 'holding', 'Darwin', 'book', 'one', 'hand', 'Bible', 'other', 'be', 'weighing', 'other', 'see', 'one', 'physically', 'heavier', 'Finally', 'simply', 'together', 'walks', 'courthouse', 'What', 'took', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'never', 'necessary', 'completely', 'discard', 'one', 'thing', 'order', 'embrace', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'ideas', 'could', 'co-exist', 'as', 'long', 'mind', 'held', 'was', 'willing', 'contain', 'Creationism', 'vs', 'Evolution', 'Christianity', 'vs', 'Atheism', 'are', 'seeing', 'things', 'black', 'white', 'when', 'everything', 'really', 'Technicolor']",N/A
296963,A3JJWHINQVAN5I,6302120624,Karl Spence,"[47, 66]","&quot;So you, Matthew Harrison Brady, through oratory or legislature or whatever, you pass on God's orders to the rest of the world! Well, meet the prophet from Nebraska! Is that the way of things? Is that the WAY of things! ... Supposing Mr. Cates had the influence and the lung power to railroad through the state legislature a law saying only Darwin could be taught in the schools!&quot;That's from the big scene in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;: the showdown between Henry Drummond (the fictional stand-in for Clarence Darrow) and the unfortunate Mr. Brady (William Jennings Bryan) over whether schoolteacher Bert Cates (John Scopes) should be convicted of teaching evolution in violation of state law.Stanley Kramer's classic film was taken by many as true to life until debunked in 1997 by UGA Professor Edward J. Larson's Pulitzer-winning history, &quot;Summer for the Gods.&quot; The film and play on which it was based did much to perpetuate the legend that the 1925 Scopes &quot;monkey trial&quot; in Dayton, Tenn., had exposed Christian fundamentalism as (in Darrow's actual words) a &quot;fool religion&quot; believed in by &quot;bigots and ignoramuses.&quot; But as Dayton residents have long known, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; departs from reality at many points.When it comes to contempt for others, it's hard to top Darrow, who fulminated against the &quot;brainless prejudice of soulless religio-maniacs.&quot; Not even his ACLU associates thought very much of Darrow's conduct in 1925. And in the film, Drummond/Darrow's interrogation of Brady/Bryan is conducted with such fury that it ordinarily would be called a tirade or diatribe. But as delivered by the beloved, curmudgeonly old actor Spencer Tracy, the tirade is transfigured. It's early '60s liberalism in all its glory, not strident or mean but &quot;impassioned.&quot;While humanizing the caustic Darrow, however, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; does a real injury to the real-life &quot;Brady,&quot; William Jennings Bryan.The film shows Brady winning the confidence of the teacher-defendant's sweetheart, then betraying that confidence by putting her on the witness stand, where his bellowing, hectoring examination reduces her to tears. No such thing ever happened in the Dayton trial. The only real-life badgering seen there was Darrow's of Bryan.The film shows Brady as disappointed that the defendant, when found guilty, is fined only $100. In reality, Bryan had advised the Tennessee Legislature against including any penalties in its anti-evolution law. With the Legislature having chosen otherwise, Bryan told the Dayton prosecutors that &quot;I don't think we should insist on more than the minimum fine, and I will let the defendant have the money to pay it if he needs it.&quot;Worse even than this celluloid transformation of the honorable, generous Bryan into the treacherous, vindictive Brady is the fact that the &quot;Wind&quot; playwrights and screenwriters misrepresented Bryan's case against evolution.Unlike many of his fellow fundamentalists, Bryan allowed that the creation might have lasted six epochs rather than six days. What objection did he have, then, against the teaching of evolution? Biographer Robert W. Cherny explains that Bryan disputed &quot;the concept of the survival of the fittest, 'the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak,' referring to it as 'the law of hate.' For Bryan, Christian love was the law by which the human race had progressed and developed.&quot;Professor Cherny writes further that Bryan blamed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; for contributing to the bloodiest war the world had yet seen, through the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's writings (which were in turn influenced by Darwin). Bryan called Nietzsche's stuff &quot;a defense, made in advance, of all the cruelties and atrocities practiced by the militarists of Germany.&quot;Even with the Great War over, Bryan held that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; was driving society &quot;into a life-and-death struggle from which sympathy and the spirit of brotherhood are eliminated. It is transforming the industrial world into a slaughterhouse.&quot;&quot;There is no place in evolution,&quot; Bryan wrote, &quot;for the penitent soul; it knows no such transformation as being born again or having sins forgiven.&quot;Such were his concerns. His fight was with what we all now deplore as &quot;social Darwinism.&quot; But you won't find a hint of that in &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot; So enjoy the movie for its bravura acting, but for the real story, read the book.",3,"Well done myth-making, but mendacious and mean",1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,4590,"['quot', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'oratory', 'legislature', 'whatever', 'pass',

296970,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6302120624,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","Stanley Kramer's ""Inherit the Wind"" seems a bit dated with Ernest Laszlo's Oscar-nominated black & white cinematography.  Frederick March plays Matthew Harrison Brady that is loosely based on William Jennings Bryant.  March won two Oscars, one for ""Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and another for ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946).  While he won the Silver Bear Best Acting Award for ""Inherit the Wind"" from the Berlin International Film Festival, this was not among his 5 Oscar nominations.  His tirades are so over-the-top that he seems almost to act in a different universe from Spencer Tracy's more modern realism.Stanley Kramer used bravado to assemble his cast.  He told Tracy that he had Frederick March & Gene Kelly signed to the picture, then approached Kelly saying he had Tracy & March signed.  Eventually, all did come on board, but it was major salesmanship on Kramer's part that assembled the cast.  Kramer had three Oscar nominations as Best Director for ""The Defiant Ones"" (1958), ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961) & ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967), but never won other than an honorary award.  Pickets went up at movie theatres protesting the ""anti-religious"" slant of this picture.  Kramer's known liberal platform rings loud & clear in this film, made in the year that John F. Kennedy was elected president.Spencer Tracy will be remembered as one of film's best actors from its first century as a medium.  He had an amazing pair of back-to-back awards for Best Actor Oscars for ""Captain's Courageous"" (1937) & ""Boys Town"" (1938).  ""Inherit the Wind"" was among his 9 Oscar nominations, although Burt Lancaster won that year for ""Elmer Gantry.""  Based on Clarence Darrow, Tracy plays Henry Drummond as a cantankerous geezer, but with enough reserve to make the riveting moments real zingers.  March, on the other hand, gets on a high note and seems to stay there, making him seem -- as Kramer probably intended -- like a buffoon.Dick York will be remembered as Darren Stevens on the ""Bewitched"" TV series.  He had been in ""My Sister Eileen"" and had even sustained a back injury while shooting ""They Came to Cordura"" in 1959 that would eventually cause him to leave the ""Bewitched"" series.  ""Inherit the Wind"" is probably his most memorable dramatic role.  John Scopes has been changed to Bertram Cates.  York's youthful looks seem the right fit for a teacher promoting Darwin's theory of evolution.  York would pass away from emphysema 32 years later; but this is probably his best work on film.Donna Anderson plays Bertram's fiancee.  She'd been in Kramer's previous film ""On the Beach"" (1959) about survivors of a nuclear holocaust.  This was the 2nd of the 5 films she would make.  She seems pretty confused about the issue of evolution, but love firmly persuades her to stand by her man.Other performances that shine are Henry Morgan that we also know from the TV shows ""M.A.S.H."" & ""Dragnet.""  Florence Eldridge, who in real life was Mrs. Frederick March, plays his wife here while having very sympathetic eyes for Spencer Tracy.  Claude Aikens plays the staunch Rev. Jeremiah Brown.  And TV's ""3's Company"" regular Norman Fell has a cameo as a radio announcer.  The film did not win any Oscars, although it was nominated for Best Editing & Best Adapted Screenplay.The issues in the film are still relevant today.  I didn't particularly find the film ""anti-religious"" as much as it seemed opposed to fanaticism & intolerance.  Science plays a vital role in debunking religion of much of its superstition, but it does not negate the existence of God as Creator.  Evolution could be as well interpreted as part of the Divine Technique rather than in opposition to religion.  The performances in the film drew me into the picture.

Unfortunately, I was under the impression that it was based on a true incident, and felt somewhat cheated when I found out the real Scopes monkey trial wasn't at all like that.  Scopes wasn't a noble idealist risking martrydom as he's protrayed in the film, he wasn't even that interested in science, he was a sports teacher.  The whole trial was a put-up job,  engineered by the ACLU and the Dayton town fathers, who wanted publicity for the town.  The worst thing about the film is the hatchet job it does on William Jennings Bryan (the Frederick March character) who is portrayed as a self-satisfied bigot.  In fact Bryan was a radical who supported women's suffrage, trade unionism, and the graded income tax.  His main objection to evolution was that he thought the 'survival of the fittest' doctrine justified the oppresion of the weak by the strong.  Finding out all these things somewhat spoilt my enjoyment of the film.  I still think it is a brilliant film, but it is fiction, not history.

Morrison ""amateur_reviewer""","[17, 21]","As previous reviewers have noted, _INHERIT THE WIND_ is a work of fiction that is based on what came to be known as &quot;The Scopes Monkey Trial.&quot;  Also previously noted is the fact that Spencer Tracy, as Henry Drummond, the character adapted from the real life Clarence Darrow, and Frederic March, playing the role of Matthew Harrison Brady, whose character is based on William Jennings Bryan, engage in a carefully choreographed and outstandingly acted &quot;pas de deux&quot; that, to this day, has rarely been matched in any movie.It should be understood that this is a work of fiction, and is not meant to duplicate the facts of the Scopes trial.  That's why the names have been changed -- to allow literary license for dramatic purposes.With this as background, one needs to understand the political climate that prevailed when the play from which the movie was adapted was written.  The play was written in 1950, in the middle of what has come to be known as the &quot;McCarthy Era.&quot;  The anti-Communist hysteria of the time was seen by many as a threat to intellectual freedom.  It was politically dangerous, at that time, to directly take on those threats to freedom of ideas, so the playwrites (Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee) came up with the idea of using the Scopes Trial, which was safely in the past, as a vehicle to express the importance of the constitutional guarantees of such things as freedom of speech.  That the play they wrote in 1950, and its 1960 movie version, were of such dramatic intensity was just icing on the cake.I think that looking at _INHERIT THE WIND_ from the standpoint of historical perspective should do away with some reviewers beliefs that it is some sort of atheistic plot to challenge their belief systems.  Also, repeating myself, I believe that it is important to realize that it is a work of fiction and need not accurately reflect the details of the real trial.It's worth seeing from several perspectives.  As a well acted movie; as one that creates an atmosphere that makes the viewer feel that he is in that hot, humid courtroom; and as one that expresses how important our freedoms really are.",5,A LITTLE BACKGROUND,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2157,"['previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'THE', 'WIND_', 'work', 'fiction', 'based', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'quot', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial.', 'quot', 'Also', 'previously', 'noted', 'fact', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'character', 'adapted', 'real', 'life', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'Frederic', 'March', 'playing', 'role', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'character', 'based', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'engage', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'outstandingly', 'acted', 'quot', 'deux', 'quot', 'day', 'rarely', 'been', 'matched', 'movie.It', 'should', 'be', 'understood', 'work', 'fiction', 'not', 'meant', 'duplicate', 'facts', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'why', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'allow', 'literary', 'license', 'dramatic', 'purposes.With', 'background', 'one', 'understand', 'political', 'climate', 'prevailed', 'when', 'play', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'was', 'written', 'play', 'was', 'written', '1950', 'middle', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'quot', 'McCarthy', 'Era.', 'quot', 'anti-Communist', 'hysteria', 'time', 'was', 'seen', 'many', 'threat', 'intellectual', 'freedom', 'was', 'politically', 'dangerous', 'time', 'directly', 'take', 'threats', 'freedom', 'ideas', 'playwrites', 'Jerome', 'Lawrence', 'Robert', 'Lee', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'using', 'Scopes', 'Trial', 'was', 'safely', 'past', 'vehicle', 'express', 'importance', 'constitutional', 'guarantees', 'such', 'things', 'freedom', 'speech', 'play', 'wrote', '1950', '1960', 'movie', 'version', 'were', 'such', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'was', 'just', 'icing', 'cake.I', 'think', 'looking', 'THE', 'WIND_', 'standpoint', 'historical', 'perspective', 'should', 'do', 'away', 'reviewers', 'beliefs', 'sort', 'atheistic', 'plot', 'challenge', 'belief', 'systems', 'Also', 'repeating', 'believe', 'important', 'realize', 'work', 'fiction', 'need', 'not', 'accurately', 'reflect', 'details', 'real', 'trial.It', 'worth', 'seeing', 'several', 'perspectives', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'one', 'atmosphere', 'viewer', 'feel', 'hot', 'humid', 'courtroom', 'one', 'how', 'important', 'freedoms', 'really', 'are']",N/A

Scopes decided to teach evolution, not to test the constitutionality of the law, but because he felt it the right thing to do. The entire affair of his arrest, his trial, and his conviction are supremely well done in Stanley Kramer's INHERIT THE WIND. The movie takes a few liberties, mostly with names. The original prosecutor was William Jennings Bryan, a stern bible thumper who had once run for President. Bryan, as Matthew Harrison Brady, is played by Frederic March, who imbues his character with a fanaticism that feeds off the majority of those in court attendance. The defender was Clarence Darrow, the liberal, suspender snapping protector of individual rights. Spencer Tracy plays Darrow, as Henry Drummond, a man who wins cases by giving his opponent just enough rope to hang himself. Much of this movie revolves around a heavyweight boxing match in court with one of the boxers getting a home town decision. Tracy and March go face to face, dragging in convoluted arguments, digressions, and morals, mostly from the bible. As the trial goes on, March's Brady becomes increasingly unglued. Tracy's Drummond forces him to admit that God talks to him, telling him what to do. At that point, Brady stands revealed as the self-righteous fanatic that he is, one who will still win the case but lose the respect that he had garnered over a lifetime.Though the movie is shot in black and white and concerns an issue that, surprisingly enough has made a recent comeback, INHERIT THE WIND can never be a dated movie. It is a fine movie, mostly for the superb clashes of the aging titans of cinema, but it is a lasting movie which will resonate for all ages because of the danger that freedom of thought must never be curtailed by legislative fiat. If lawmakers try to deny that freedom of thought merely by writing words on paper that deny others to read other words on other papers, then Tracy's closing warning stands as an eloquent warning to those lawmakers: 'He that disturbs his own house shall inherit the wind.'",5,Inherit the Wind: Theology in Never Dated,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,2239,"['one', 'back', '1922', 'Tennessee', 'probably', 'gave', 'much', 'thought', 'pro-Bible', 'law', 'prohibited', 'teaching', 'evolution', 'public', 'schools', 'one', 'John', 'Scopes', 'who', 'made', 'rare', 'stand', 'age', 'Scopes', 'decided', 'teach', 'evolution', 'not', 'test', 'constitutionality', 'law', 'felt', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'entire', 'affair', 'arrest', 'trial', 'conviction', 'are', 'supremely', 'well', 'done', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', 'movie', 'few', 'liberties', 'mostly', 'names', 'original', 'prosecutor', 'was', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'stern', 'bible', 'thumper', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'run', 'President', 'Bryan', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'played', 'Frederic', 'March', 'who', 'character', 'fanaticism', 'majority', 'court', 'attendance', 'defender', 'was', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'liberal', 'suspender', 'snapping', 'protector', 'individual', 'rights', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Darrow', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'man', 'who', 'cases', 'giving', 'opponent', 'just', 'enough', 'rope', 'hang', 'Much', 'movie', 'around', 'heavyweight', 'boxing', 'match', 'court', 'one', 'boxers', 'getting', 'home', 'town', 'decision', 'Tracy', 'March', 'go', 'face', 'face', 'dragging', 'convoluted', 'arguments', 'digressions', 'morals', 'mostly', 'bible', 'trial', 'March', 'Brady', 'increasingly', 'unglued', 'Tracy', 'Drummond', 'forces', 'admit', 'God', 'talks', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'point', 'Brady', 'revealed', 'self-righteous', 'fanatic', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'still', 'win', 'case', 'lose', 'respect', 'had', 'garnered', 'lifetime.Though', 'movie', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'concerns', 'issue', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'made', 'recent', 'comeback', 'INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'dated', 'movie', 'fine', 'movie', 'mostly', 'superb', 'clashes', 'aging', 'titans', 'cinema', 'lasting', 'movie', 'will', 'resonate', 'ages', 'danger', 'freedom', 'thought', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'curtailed', 'legislative', 'fiat', 'lawmakers', 'try', 'deny', 'freedom', 'thought', 'merely', 'writing', 'words', 'paper', 'others', 'read', 'other', 'words', 'other', 'papers', 'then', 'Tracy', 'closing', 'warning', 'eloquent', 'warning', 'lawmakers', ""'He"", 'disturbs', 'own', 'house', 'shall', 'inherit', 'wind']",N/A

296981,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6302120624,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[2, 2]","INHERIT THE WIND is a highly dramaticized take on the infamous ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" of 1925. As history, it takes dramatic license to a degree that is perhaps irresponsible, slanting the entire affair so far against one side that the audience is never really permitted to make up its own mind; as pure entertainment, however, it is one of the better films you will ever see.INHERIT is ostensibly the story of smalltown schoolteacher Bertram Cates (Dick York), who is arrested for teaching Darwinism in his classroom in violation of Tennessee state law. Cates' arrest comes at the urging of fire-eating preacher Rev. Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins), who is the father of Cates fianc&eacute; Rachel (Donna Anderson), and has intensely personal reasons for wanting Cates clapped in irons. If this sounds a bit like a soap opera, rest assured that the movie is really about the courtroom duel between the prosecutor, a fundamentalist ex-presidential candidate named Matthew Harrison Brady (Frederic March), who believes that the Bible is the Revealed Word of God, and Cates' defense attorney, a cantankerous ACLU lawyer named Henry Drummond (Spenser Tracy), whose only gods are ""science and reason."" Stirring the pot is an almost unbelievably cynical reporter named E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly), who seems to believe in absolutely nothing at all. The stakes may seem minor, but as the trial goes on it's clear that what is at issue here is where the church ends and the state begins, and in a country whose constitution expressly forbids the establishment of a state religion, that's pretty big potatoes.INHERIT was shot in 1960, but because it is a period piece and filmed in B & W, it has a feeling which belongs more to the 40s or early 50s, to wit: intensely dramatic scenes alternate with tension-relieving light comedy, the acting is marvelous, and the dialogue just snaps, with many of the best lines going to Kelly, who gets to say cheeky things like, ""I may be rancid butter, but I'm on your side of the bread"", delivered with an almost Satanic smirk of total mischief. Courtroom dramas are a dime a dozen, but the really good ones stand out because of good chemistry, and you'd be hard-pressed to find better chemistry than that which occurs between the grouchy but devoted Tracy and the pompous but good-hearted March. Both characters sincerely believe they are doing right, a fact which has an element of tragedy to it and heightens the overall drama.Now, I happened to live in York County, Pennsylvania, when, eighty years after the real Monkey Trial, another one (of sorts) took place in nearby Dover, and it never ceases to amaze me how timely this film remains. The war between the secular and the religious, between science and faith, continues to flare up, but this was the decisive battle. It is true that from a factual standpoint this movie has only a slight relation to the what happened- the depiction of the townsfolk as torch-wielding religious fanatics is unfair (they found the trial mainly an opportunity to separate reporters from their money), and the teacher upon whom Cates is based instigated his own arrest at the behest of the ACLU, which, whatever good it may have done, has the ugly habit of using legal technicalities to short-circuit majority rule. Still, taken as pure entertainment, this film is gold, and I highly recommend it.",4,Inherit This Movie,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,3362,"['INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', 'highly', 'dramaticized', 'take', 'infamous', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', '1925', 'history', 'dramatic', 'license', 'degree', 'perhaps', 'irresponsible', 'slanting', 'entire', 'affair', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'side', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'permitted', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'however', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'will', 'ever', 'see.INHERIT', 'ostensibly', 'story', 'smalltown', 'schoolteacher', 'Bertram', 'Cates', 'Dick', 'York', 'who', 'arrested', 'teaching', 'Darwinism', 'classroom', 'violation', 'Tennessee', 'state', 'law', 'Cates', 'arrest', 'urging', 'fire-eating', 'preacher', 'Rev', 'Jeremiah', 'Brown', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'who', 'father', 'Cates', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Rachel', 'Donna', 'Anderson', 'intensely', 'personal', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'Cates', 'clapped', 'irons', 'bit', 'soap', 'opera', 'rest', 'assured', 'movie', 'really', 'courtroom', 'duel', 'prosecutor', 'fundamentalist', 'ex-presidential', 'candidate', 'named', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'Frederic', 'March', 'who', 'Bible', 'Revealed', 'Word', 'God', 'Cates', 'defense', 'attorney', 'cantankerous', 'ACLU', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'Spenser', 'Tracy', 'only', 'gods', 'are', 'science', 'reason', 'Stirring', 'pot', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'cynical', 'reporter', 'named', 'E.K', 'Hornbeck', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'who', 'believe', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'stakes', 'may', 'seem', 'minor', 'trial', 'clear', 'what', 'issue', 'here', 'where', 'church', 'state', 'country', 'constitution', 'expressly', 'establishment', 'state', 'religion', 'pretty', 'big', 'potatoes.INHERIT', 'was', 'shot', '1960', 'period', 'piece', 'filmed', 'B', 'W', 'feeling', 'more', '40s', 'early', '50s', 'wit', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'tension-relieving', 'light', 'comedy', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'dialogue', 'just', 'snaps', 'many', 'best', 'lines', 'going', 'Kelly', 'who', 'say', 'cheeky', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'rancid', 'butter', ""'m"", 'side', 'bread', 'delivered', 'almost', 'Satanic', 'smirk', 'total', 'mischief', 'Courtroom', 'dramas', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'stand', 'out', 'good', 'chemistry', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'better', 'chemistry', 'grouchy', 'devoted', 'Tracy', 'pompous', 'good-hearted', 'March', 'characters', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'fact', 'element', 'tragedy', 'overall', 'drama.Now', 'happened', 'live', 'York', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'when', 'eighty', 'years', 'real', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'one', 'sorts', 'took', 'place', 'nearby', 'Dover', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'timely', 'film', 'war', 'secular', 'religious', 'science', 'faith', 'flare', 'up', 'was', 'decisive', 'battle', 'true', 'factual', 'standpoint', 'movie', 'only', 'slight', 'relation', 'what', 'happened-', 'depiction', 'townsfolk', 'torch-wielding', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'unfair', 'found', 'trial', 'mainly', 'opportunity', 'separate', 'reporters', 'money', 'teacher', 'whom', 'Cates', 'based', 'instigated', 'own', 'arrest', 'behest', 'ACLU', 'good', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'ugly', 'habit', 'using', 'legal', 'technicalities', 'short-circuit', 'majority', 'rule', 'Still', 'taken', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'film', 'gold', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Since christian religions emerged (superstitions attain the religion' status when they have been around a while, or when they have eliminated competition), started the biggest  non-stop mass-murderings (never seen before on this scale and duration) so to impose upon others the name every one gave to their own idea of god.JFK said once that ""you can't reason out what have not been reasoned into"", Konrad Lorenz that ""The missing link between apes and man, it's us"". And yet there is still no indication that the first step, necessary to reach mankind stage, is going to be taken : the ban of ANY religion, since their main purpose is dividing (forgetting that the original roman word 'religare' had 'to unit' as meaning), preventing mind-openness (370 years ago, Galileo escaped burning only by admitting earth was the center of universe and the sun was revolving around it - ""E pur, si muove), and enforcing wherever and whenever they could a state of poverty and ignorance. Unrestrected hate is also part of their basics, love being only used as a word without any substance, so to strenghten their self-righteousness.I can see why brainless bipeds refuse freedom of thought for themselves (or claim absence of thought as a right - small spoiler : ""do you have a hole in your head or your head in a hole?""), but to allow them imposing their shortcomings upon the gullible should be regarded as a crime, and punished by internment in a zoo, where they could meet their cousins, and maybe learn something from them.I found especially interesting the performance of Fredric March, crumbling when realizing he could not face the contradictions between discrepancies in the very crap that molded him and those whose main indoctrination was to disregard and/or fight anything which didn't get full approval from their priests/imams/rabbis, and other shamans or gurus. True men think and adjust their thinking to new information; trained monkeys, pretending to be men because they have a driving license, only believe, and their main belief is they have to avoid any new information. Best ""Good Books"" are from Confucius, Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, even some by Cicero. All of them having a good supply of various gods, all of them reckoned angry gods could mess with human lives, but none of them thought for one second that these gods and their priests had any right to prevent them from thinking by themselves.For God's sake, let's get rid of those ""Old-time religions"", none of them, during 20 centuries, had brought any proof of being anything but evil (and if god did really exist, he's sure as much evil, or wouldn't have allowed any of this crap).",5,It happened in 1925...,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2709,"['movie', 'was', 'made', '1960', 'are', 'now', '2005', 'christian', 'religions', 'emerged', 'superstitions', 'attain', 'religion', 'status', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'when', 'have', 'eliminated', 'competition', 'started', 'biggest', 'non-stop', 'mass-murderings', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'scale', 'duration', 'so', 'impose', 'others', 'name', 'one', 'gave', 'own', 'idea', 'god.JFK', 'said', 'once', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reason', 'out', 'what', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'reasoned', 'Konrad', 'Lorenz', 'missing', 'link', 'apes', 'man', 'yet', 'still', 'indication', 'first', 'step', 'necessary', 'reach', 'mankind', 'stage', 'going', 'be', 'taken', 'ban', 'ANY', 'religion', 'main', 'purpose', 'dividing', 'forgetting', 'original', 'roman', 'word', ""'religare"", 'had', ""'to"", 'unit', 'meaning', 'preventing', 'mind-openness', '370', 'years', 'ago', 'Galileo', 'escaped', 'burning', 'only', 'admitting', 'earth', 'was', 'center', 'universe', 'sun', 'was', 'revolving', 'E', 'pur', 'si', 'muove', 'enforcing', 'wherever', 'whenever', 'could', 'state', 'poverty', 'ignorance', 'Unrestrected', 'hate', 'also', 'part', 'basics', 'love', 'being', 'only', 'used', 'word', 'substance', 'so', 'strenghten', 'self-righteousness.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'brainless', 'bipeds', 'refuse', 'freedom', 'thought', 'claim', 'absence', 'thought', 'right', 'small', 'spoiler', 'do', 'have', 'hole', 'head', 'head', 'hole', 'allow', 'imposing', 'shortcomings', 'gullible', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'crime', 'punished', 'internment', 'zoo', 'where', 'could', 'meet', 'cousins', 'maybe', 'learn', 'something', 'them.I', 'found', 'especially', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Fredric', 'March', 'crumbling', 'when', 'realizing', 'could', 'not', 'face', 'contradictions', 'discrepancies', 'very', 'crap', 'molded', 'main', 'indoctrination', 'was', 'disregard', 'and/or', 'fight', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'approval', 'priests/imams/rabbis', 'other', 'shamans', 'gurus', 'True', 'men', 'think', 'adjust', 'thinking', 'new', 'information', 'trained', 'monkeys', 'pretending', 'be', 'men', 'have', 'driving', 'license', 'only', 'believe', 'main', 'belief', 'have', 'avoid', 'new', 'information', 'Best', 'Good', 'Books', 'are', 'Confucius', 'Socrates', 'Aristotle', 'Plato', 'even', 'Cicero', 'having', 'good', 'supply', 'various', 'gods', 'reckoned', 'angry', 'gods', 'could', 'mess', 'human', 'lives', 'none', 'thought', 'one', 'second', 'gods', 'priests', 'had', 'right', 'prevent', 'thinking', 'themselves.For', 'God', 'sake', 'let', 'get', 'rid', 'Old-time', 'religions', 'none', '20', 'centuries', 'had', 'brought', 'proof', 'being', 'anything', 'evil', 'god', 'did', 'really', 'exist', 'sure', 'much', 'evil', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'allowed', 'crap']",N/A

296996,A1P49YMRCG63GZ,6302120624,Rasih Bensan,"[6, 8]","Even though this movie was made 49 years ago in 1960 its message is still completely relevant today. We see how religious indoctrination and the resulting fanaticism poison human thinking and life. The movie is based on a true story that took place in the beginning of the 20th century in a small town in the USA. The actors' performance is very good and we all have important lessons to learn from the movie.A school teacher teaching Darwin's theory of evolution in a high school in a small town in the USA is arrested and jailed on grounds that he is teaching something that contradicts the statements in the Bible regarding creation and humans' origin. While in prison he is tried in court. His defense is a secular lawyer from Chicago. They are all labelled as atheists by the town's people. The prosecutor is a man brainwashed by Bible's teachings and a three time US presidential candidate. The whole town population is fanatically religious, condemns the teacher, the lawyer and the journalist on the defending side. The lawyer asks very intelligent questions in the court to the prosecutor about the Bible who claims to be an expert on the Bible and a devoted Christian. The lawyer shows the contradictions and the irrational thinking in the prosecutor's answers. Suddenly, it becomes religious dogma that is on trial. The teacher is found guilty of course because we see clearly that the judicial system and the way the court is conducted by the judge and jury are not secular. The verdict of penalty is ridiculous ; only a 100 dollar penalty that dissapoints the plaintiff side. The prosecutor loses all credibility and dies of a heart attack in court.Throughout the 20th century and today this conflict between religious creationists and Intelligent Design proponents on one side  and evolutionists on the other side has been continuing with fervor all over the world. There are many discussion blogs on the internet where creationists and evolutionists argue, sometimes rudely. Schools, government  offices, courtrooms in the USA and in some other countries continue to be battlegrounds of this never ending controversy. One consolation is that nowadays in contrast with the film Inherit the Wind it is often religious dogma that is on trial in courtrooms. Therefore, I recommend that you also watch the NOVA documentary series about evolution especially the ones named  "" Judgement day : Intelligent Design on Trial "" and EVOLUTION : THE  MIND'S BIG BANG and WHAT ABOUT GOD ?  which clearly demonstrate underlying hidden religious motives of Creationists.It is ridiculous to equate the study of  and belief inDarwin's theories with atheism. A person can believe in God and Darwin's theory of evolution simultaneously. He / she does not have to believe the 6 day creation dogma with no scientific basis to be a believer in God. Perhaps God designed evolution the way Darwin described it. Perhaps not. The only way to find out if Darwin was right or wrong is through scientific research. Not by refuting the scientific method and replacing it with some kind of religious dogma. Darwin's theory of evolution does not imply that God had no role in evolution, just that God's role is not the way Creationists, Intelligent Design proponents and the Bible describe it. Moreover, whether we believe in God or not, we should be open minded to arguments put forward by some atheists regarding the non - existence of God.  Richard Dawkins' book titled "" the God Delusion ""  states very strong arguments regarding the non - existence of God and religious perversion in thinking. It is amazing that the human mind which developed so much that it made humans the most intelligent species on Earth can be so conditioned in early childhood that it becomes a self imposed under achiever of its intellectual potential.The mentality that  has been trying to replace Darwin's theory of Evolution with Intelligent Design  since the beginning of the 20th century is the same mentality that refuted Copernicus's  theory and convicted Galileo hundreds of years ago for claiming that it is the Earth that revolves around the sun not the other way around as claimed by the church.I don't know if fundamentalist Christians and fundamentalist Moslems around the world who hate one another so much realize that they are 100 % in agreement on this issue. It is not in just the USA and not just in the Christian world that Darwin gets regularly attacked, Intelligent Design and religious dogma try to seize education. For example just a few weeks ago as I am writing these lines the following things happened in Turkey ; a Moslem country with a secular State : anti- Darwinist Islamist Creationists made a move against Darwin in Turkey ; the monthly magazine of a government sponsored Turkish Scientific Research Organization in Turkey put Darwin's picture on the cover of the March 2009 issue and devoted 16 pages to him in commemoration of Darwin's 200th birth year. Immediately after this, the director of the organization purged the editor from the organization and had Darwin erased from the cover of the magazine. His justification was that the current situation in Turkey was too sensitive to tolerate Darwin on the cover of the magazine. For many days after this event  a strong reaction continued from the secular organizations and press in Turkey and internationally. Some Turkish secular organizations conducted protest demonstrations demanding the resignation of the directors of the government sponsored Scientific Research Organization who they claimed were  Islamist Creationists. The directors backed down and denied they had anything against Darwin. But the editor of the magazine who was purged subsequently claimed that the directors were lying, that she was told that she was fired for putting Darwin's picture  on the cover of the magazine and that she would take the matter to court. Several days later under severe pressure from the Turkish secular community the editor was reinstated.Since March 2009 the secular part of  the academic and other communities in Turkey are active to protect Darwin's credibility. Major universities in Istanbul are organizing exhibitions, documentary movies and inviting worldwide famous evolutionist scientists to lecture in Istanbul. The lectures and movies are free and open to the public. I saw this movie "" Inherit the Wind "" in one of the Istanbul Universities shown as part of these programs.",5,A very good movie about religious fanaticism vs. Darwin's theory of

This sleepy town of Dayton wanted the rest of the nation to notice them, so they reinvented themselves through the 'Monkey Trial'...If Custer hadn't died at the Little Big Horn, would anyone remember him??? So the 'John Scopes' trial that matched creationists against evolutionists was Dayton's 'last stand' I guess. But let's get back to Kramer's film.So what if ""Inherit the Wind"" twists all the facts and is more a work of fiction than fact. If you want to learn more about the 'Monkey Trial', read a textbook. If you want to see Spencer Tracy and Fredric March boxing each other with words, watch Kramer's great film. Gene Kelly is also featured as the sharp-tongued reporter who is sent to cover the 'trial'. And Harry Morgan, Dick York and Claude Akins also give good supporting performances.Don't search for bits of propaganda or stereotypes in this film. You will be sure to find them.

297000,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302120624,Robert Moore,"[77, 85]","After over forty years this remains a truly powerful film, and the secret is not hard to locate:  Spencer Tracy and Fredric March.  These two great actors, both near the end of their respective careers (both would make other films, but it would be the last great performance in March's career and one of the last in Tracy's, though he did go on to excel in both JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG and GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER).  Remove them from the film, and there wouldn't be a whole lot left.  Luckily, they are in it, and between them they manage to chew up scene after scene as they display movie acting at its very finest.The story, of course, is loosely (though not too loosely) based on the Scopes trial, where Clarence Darrow defended John Scopes from charges of having taught the theory of evolution in a public school.  William Jennings Bryan, former US senator, secretary of state, and three-time presidential candidate, argued the case for the prosecution.  Although the real-life trial was covered by a huge press corps, the movie focuses on only one reporter, the fictional E. K. Hornbeck, who is loosely based on H. L. Mencken and played somewhat against type by Gene Kelly (sadly, it would also be Kelly's last major role; unlike his friend and rival Fred Astaire, his career was cut short partly by the demise of the musical and partly by injuries that made dancing harder for him as he aged, but also unlike Astaire he was unable to find quality acting roles as he aged).The film is also served well by an excellent supporting cast.  Harry Morgan, later familiar from M*A*S*H, capably plays the judge in the trial.  Dick York, later the first Darren in BEWITCHED (interestingly, a TV show based on I MARRIED A WITCH, in which Fredric March played the &quot;Darren&quot; equivalent) is a familiar face.  Claude Akens, who guest starred in literally hundreds of television shows from the 1950s through the 1980s, got one of the larger roles of his career as Rev. Jeremiah Brown, like Kelly against type since he usually played cowboys, criminals, or police officers.I have often had mixed feelings about director Stanley Kramer.  While I like several of his movies--especially ON THE BEACH, THE DEFIANT ONES, and this one--I always get the impression that I like them despite his direction.  His films always seem to drift in the action, seem to lack focus, and have a poor pace.  The overall structure of his films seems to be weak.

H L MenckenSpencer Tracy and Fredric March star as personal friends on opposing sides of a legal battle over teaching Darwin's theory of evolution in a Tennessee public school. The original stage play informs the intensely dramatic portrayals of Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan.The title is based on Proverbs 11:29 He that troubleth his own house, shall inherit the wind; and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.The storyline is the State of Tennessee vs Scopes trial July 1925. Mr Scopes was accused of teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. Trial transcripts are available via Google. Newspaper commentary was provided by H L Mencken, portrayed by Gene Kelly in the movie, with daily syndicated summaries published nationwide. Those columns are also available on Google. Mencken coined the phrases ""monkey trial"" and ""bible belt.""Kelly is adept at showing the Mencken journalist not as neutral observer but as ""pot stirrer"" who uses access to private and public venues to craft word pictures for sale. ""Like any other author I have suffered recurrent depressions and despairs. . . ."" and ""When a pedagogue takes his oath of office, he renounces his right to free speech. . . . he becomes a paid propagandist of certain definite doctrines. . . and every time he departs from them deliberately, he deliberately swindles his employers"" to tweak Scopes as paid to say what he was told to say, not to think independently nor inspire children to discover the possible in their futures unknown.Women had only achieved the right to vote in 1920. Notice no women sit on the jury.The movie focuses on conflicting loyalties, beliefs, egos, friendships, habits, losses, hopes revealed in court. The intersecting complexities of each human being, both frailties and kindnesses, intrigue and magnify audience attention. There were no plateaus of boredom in the entire script.The small town courtesies, quietness, support and biases appear without inquiry into their equity toward those who may think differently. In reality the townspeople of Dayton tried to tar and feather H L Mencken, not the accused. The mayor was able to deter them but admitted to the press he wasn't certain he would be present or able to control them if it happened again. Mencken left town before the closing debate.I was disappointed that Dudley Malone's character, member of the defense team, was not well fleshed out. No testimony from defense witnesses is recorded. His plea to admit witnesses for the defense from the transcripts is memorable:There is never a duel with the truth. The truth always wins and we are not afraid of it. The truth is no coward. . . . The truth is imperishable, eternal, and immortal and needs no human agency to support it. We are ready to tell the truth as we understand it and we do not fear all the truth that they can present as facts. We are ready. We are ready. We feel we stand with progress. We feel we stand with science. We feel we stand with intelligence. We feel we stand with fundamental freedom in America. We are not afraid. Where is the fear? We meet it! Where is the fear? We defy it! We ask your honor to admit the evidence as a matter of justice to the defense in this case. July 25 1925 Dayton TN Scopes TrialThought provoking examination of relationships in conflict: two friends Drummond and Brady who find themselves on opposite sides of a philosophical legal debate. Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) respects Brady's great soul and is saddened by his death after the trial. William Jennings Bryan died 5 days after the Scopes trial ended.An engaged couple, one of whom is the accused teacher of evolution, the other is the daughter of the town minister. The minister condemns his own daughter as he condemned a child who used a microscope and later died.Wife Florence Eldridge of the William Jennings Bryan character Brady (Fredric March) admires her spouse's charisma and loves him for his humanity though she recognizes his ego exceeds his discretion. Florence Eldridge and Fredric March were married in real life.Knowledge through education enables freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of thought, freedom from poverty. Countries which sent the US exchange students thought they would scoop up the ingenious creativity of Americans and steal it home. What tagged along as unnoticed baggage was the experience of living in freedom, freedom of speech, thought, expression, preference. And the idea of equity for all people even women, children, people of different religious beliefs or no beliefs, disabled, different color, race or geography sneaked into other countries without notice, until recently.This 1960 DVD is still engaging theater, and intriguing for discussion and contemplation and continuing reading and research.

I am astounded to find how many reviewers have excused its massive deviation from fact under the banner of ""entertainment.""  Has our capacity to evaluate information diminished to the point that we are no longer able to differentiate between simple entertainment and pure propaganda?  When a movie presents a supposedly intellectual argument, and paints EVERY SINGLE MEMBER on one side of that argument as a buffoon maroon, but shows the other side as thoughtful, open-minded, and humanitarian, you can bet the farm that you're being propagandized! A couple of reviewers here have equated the movie with an indictment of the horrors of ""McCarthyism.""  These folks have been twice-bamboozled!  Obviously they don't do any independent research, but ingest whatever gets fed to them.  Go to [...] and click on ""Profiles"" if you want to learn the truth about Joseph McCarthy and ""McCarthyism.""INHERIT THE WIND pretends to portray the famous 1925 Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" with a little dramatic license.  This movie strays SO FAR from the facts that even saying it is ""based on"" the actual event renders that term so elastic as to be meaningless!  John Scopes is renamed Bert Cates (Dick York), Clarence Darrow becomes Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) and Dayton, Tennessee becomes Hillsboro, Tennessee. The playwrights, Jerome Lawrence & Robert Lee, did not alter the names because they thought they could improve on them, but so they could legally reinvent history. The idea was to twist the truth & present it as entertainment ""based on"" a true story, knowing that over time, the drama will become accepted as factual by the masses. And it worked!  Look how many of us grew up thinking that INHERIT THE WIND was an essentially accurate account of the ""Monkey Trial.""All of the Christians (believing in ""Creationism"") in the movie are portrayed as emotionally-overwrought, brain-dead bigots. Paint any other group with such a broad brush and you'll be in court for the rest of your life, but here in Amerika, it's always ""open season"" on Christians.  Hardly sympathetic to both views, in reality, Darrow called Christianity, Bryan's ""fool religion.""Contrary to many opinions posted here, the acting does NOT make INHERIT THE WIND worthy of your time. March & Claude Akins are mere caricatures, but they're not to be blamed as Brady and Rev. Brown were written as cartoon blowhards. Tracy's naturalistic performance is enjoyable as usual, but Tracy was ALWAYS Tracy from film to film; there's nothing new here. Gene Kelly was fine as the cynical, MENSA-donkey newspaper reporter, but it was a simple part to play. The best, most sympathetic performance was actually turned in by Florence Eldridge as Mrs. Sarah Brady.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[7, 11]","Stanley Kramer's ""Inherit the Wind"" brings the creationism versus Darwin's theory of evolution debate to the big screen.  Helping to illuminate the arguments of both sides are two passionate performances by Spencer Tracy and Fredric March.Attorney Henry Drummond (Tracy) arrives in a small town in Tennessee to defend a schoolteacher who has been arrested for teaching the theory of evolution in school.  Opposing him is religious leader Matthew Harrison Brady (March) who has no trouble winning the support of the townspeople.  The ensuing trial between science and religion gains national attention and every tense moment is noted by cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly).While ""Inherit the Wind"" may have a light tone to it, the film still does manage to convey the serious threat Darwin posed to the beliefs of a large number of people.  Tracy and March are excellent but the revelation in the film is Gene Kelly who shines in one of his rare dramatic turns.

297010,A27FN4HAYH2JDI,6302120624,The Professor,"[2, 2]","Inherit the Wind should be viewed by anyone who cares about the art of film acting.  Spencer Tracy's performance is simply stunning, effortless and natural despite the theatrical derivation of the script.  The legal argument may be old news, but the movie's core subject matter (blind faith vs. thoughtful probing) is as relevant as ever and Stanley Kramer's effective direction helps maintain viewer interest for the lengthy 128 minute running time.  The other performances are quite good, with the prominent exception of Gene Kelly.  His uncharacteristic dramatic turn as an opportunistic journalist who speaks in flowery and elevated language fell flat, undercut by his own star persona.  He simply looks like the same Gene Kelly who sings and dances and it's almost impossible to take him seriously as a cutthroat newsman.  Perhaps if his costuming and makeup had been different the result would be better...which brings me to my only other criticism of the film itself.  I'm not certain whether to place the fault with the makeup or the lighting, but Frederic March's clearly visible bald cap and padding often undermines his otherwise convincing performance as Bible-thumping prosecutor Matthew Brady.  That does it for criticism of the film.  The DVD itself, however, must be taken to task for its non-anamorphic widescreen transfer.  This movie deserves better, but see it anyway to marvel at Spencer Tracy's stunning performance and enjoy the film's other sterling qualities.

297011,A4JHEO7H330AF,6302120624,Tom Brody,"[4, 5]","The movie is entertaining from start to finish.  Please note that the transcript of the trial, obtainable from an internet vendor for about $6.00, is also entertaining.  The transcript is entitled, ""The Complete Scopes Trial Transcript.""The movie begins with Leslie Uggams' voice, singing a spiritual.  The film does not devote much time to introducing us to the local color.  It marches us directly into a classroom, where Dick York is shown teaching with an amusing teaching aid--a large poster showing the anatomy of a monkey aside a chart showing an evolutionary tree.(A pleasant surprise, it was, to see Dick York.  He also plays the role of a meek bank clerk in ""A Penny For Your Thoughts,"" a Twilight Zone episode.)The next ten or fifteen minutes discloses the circus-like atmosphere of the townspeople, where the locals march up and down the streets, holding anti-evolution posters.  For example, one reads, ""Don't pin a tail on me.""  This part of the film also shows hawkers and other odd characters, for example, a man with a real monkey, making anti-evolution speech.  The hawker cries out, ""Monkeys really evolved from man!""  The real monkey sits in front of the man's truck, where the side of the truck bears an inscription reading, ""DEVOLUTION . . .""  The monkey sits in front of the sign, so mostly what we read is the term ""DEVO.""(For people who like Devo, and who like Devo's songs (Whip It; Gates of Steel; Through Being Cool), this scene will likely be astonishing.  The scene sets forth the notion that man descended from monkeys, and introduces us to a novel term, ""Devolution.""  Because the monkey is situated partially in front of the word, all we see is the term ""DEVO.""  Is this where Mark Mothersbaugh got the concept for his band Devo?)The movie continues with jury selection, just as in the actual transcript.  Towards the beginning of the film, somebody complains that it is too hot, and asks permission for those in the courtroom TO REMOVE THEIR JACKETS.  However, this part is different in the actual transcript of the trial.  In the transcript, one of the jurors complains about the heat and requests, ""If it ain't out of order, I would like to make the request to take up the matter of some ELECTRIC FANS here.  This heat is fearful."" (fourth day of trial).The movie uses the joke from the transcript about ""why does evolution state that we were derived from old world monkeys?  What's wrong with American monkeys?""  I was glad to see this line in the movie.  The actual comment was, ""The Simiadae then branched off into two great stems, the new world and old world monkeys, and from the latter, at a remote period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe proceeded.  Not even from American monkeys, but from old world monkeys.""  This was Williams Jennings Bryan reading from Darwin and making wisecracks, on the fifth day of transcript.However, another humorous line from the transcript was omitted, namely the remark that ""in evolution man comes from below, from animals in the sea, but in the Bible creation story man comes from above.""  In the transcript, the actual remark was, ""But it does not mean that they did not come up from the lower animals, if this is the only place they could come from, and the Christian believes MAN CAME FROM ABOVE, but the evolutionist believes HE MUST HAVE COME FROM BELOW."" This was a wisecrack by Williams Jennings Bryan made on the fifth day of transcript.Another difference between the film and the transcript is as follows.  In the film, the court refused to allow any expert testimony.  However,  the transcript from the actual trial contains several pages of testimony by professors--experts in geology or biology.  On day 4 of the transcript, Dr.Metcalf of Johns Hopkins provides several pages of expert testimony.  On day 7 of the transcript, the defense attorney reads statements from three experts, namely, Cole of U.Chicago, Mather of Harvard, and Curtis of U.Missouri.  The transcript does, in fact, reveal the issue of excluding expert testimony--the transcript reveals a dispute between William Jennings Bryan and Mr.Scopes' defense attorney on whether expert testomony should be admissible.A common feature of the transcript and the movie, is that William Jennings Bryan was called as a witness, and interviewed as a witness.  This situation is unusual in the annals of litigation, that is, where one of the attorneys is called as a witness.  The film and transcript both disclose that the fine for Mr.Scopes was only $100.Perhaps the most dramatic aspect of the transcript, which was omitted from the movie, is that the jury was out for only NINE MINUTES.Two important themes in the transcript were faithfully presented in the movie.  These two themes were first, the prosecution's complaint that the defense were from far away, e.g., from far off Chicago, Baltimore, or New York; and second, the argument of the defense that Mr.Scopes did not violate the statute, on the basis that the Bible creation story of the SIXTH DAY WAS ONLY A FIGURE OF SPEECH, and that what was the sixth day could be construed as meaning a much longer time.The outdoor marching scenes are strident and stagey, while the courtroom scenes sometimes contain too much ferocious yelling.  Gene (Singing in the Rain) Kelly provides a counterpoint to this.  He is calm throughout the film.One theme set forth by the film, which is absent in the transcript, is the theme of fanaticism.  This sort of theme was on everybody's mind at the time the film was made, that is, in the years following WWII.  In the film, Fundamentalists are the ""fall guy"" and are depicted as brainwashed fanatics.

297012,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,6302120624,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[5, 14]",A lot of people have confused this film with the Scopes Trial. The film is based on a play and is a rather biased view of a histocial event.The Scopes trial was an attempt by civil libaterians to have the local legislation outlawing the teaching of Darwin's theories taught in schools. It was intended that a trial be run and that it be appealed to the US Supreme Court. The authorities in the town in question were eager to cooperate with the civil rights lawyers as it would bring the small town a bit of attention. In real life the taking of the case by Clarence Darrow confused things and led to a monetary penalty which made any appeal impossible. In fact creationists won the battle as the law stayed on the history books for years.The play however is a passionate attack on creationism and the sort of closed mind that was thought to lay behind such an outlook. It is of course highly ironic in many respects. William Jennings Bryan who took over the prosecution was a long time democrat. He was concerned about Darwanism as he thought that Specerist theories of the development of society led to a view that the working and labouring classes could be left on the scrap heap. He thought that Christianity was a better basis for the achievment of a just society.When this play was written those arguments had been forgotten. The play is written in a way to portray Bryan as a bigotted fool and Clarence Darrow as the man of the hour. In fact Darrow was a person who had been associated with reasonably extreme left wing groups.Never the less the film is a masterful piece of propoganda which has the power even today to move people.

No, this ""fiction"" is not an accurate rendering of the real-life Scopes Monkey Trial, but it does capture the spirit of H.L. Mencken's extraordinary dispatches to the Baltimore Sun and I'd guess that was the intention. Mencken is the Hornbeck character played by Gene Kelley but many of his thoughts, and certainly his philosophy, are given to Spencer Tracy's character. That he's made out to be a mere glib and shallow cynic in this movie is more injustice than Christians have ever suffered here. Mencken was passionate about the greatness man was capable of.If any offended party took time to read Mencken's full take on the proceedings they'd find this movie pretty tame...and Mencken was there, as a journalist. His legendary obituary for William Jennings Bryan was the prototype for the scatological one Hunter Thompson wrote for Nixon.Spencer Tracy is excellent but Frederic March is truly astounding. Some reviewers find his performance a bit over-the-top but they are clearly young 'uns who have no recollection of the legend of Bryan, who was over-the-top to begin with. What March managed to do was convey that P.T. Barnum quality while fleshing out the character, giving him depth, and making him believable. People need to understand that some historical characters had tremendous presence.The only problem I have with the film is with the logic of some of the arguments.

297017,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6302120624,William Hare,"[20, 24]","With the issue of evolution versus creationism flaring up anew in current legal battles, Stanley Kramer's 1960 film has retained its timeliness.  This was a period of vigorous activity for Kramer on the message film front as he directed and produced within a four year cycle ""The Defiant Ones,"" a 1958 examination of the race issue in America starring Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, ""On The Beach,"" a controversial film about nuclear war starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner which was released in 1959, followed in turn by the aforementioned ""Inherit The Wind"" one year later and the highly acclaimed ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" in 1961, which focused on personal responsibility of German judges to interpret the law humanely during Hitler's Third Reich.""Inherit The Wind"" was adapted by Kramer to the screen from the hugely successful Broadway stage hit written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee about the Scopes Monkey Trial held in Dayton, Tennessee in 1922.  While the names were changed, with defense lawyer Clarence Darrow becoming Henry Drummond and prosecutor William Jennings Bryan becoming Matthew Harrison Brady, the chief issue of the actual trial pitting creationism and evolution as applied to the classroom remained intact.  Distinguished veteran stars Spencer Tracy and Fredric March perform with astounding brilliance as competing individuals who believed they were standard bearers for important causes governing how civilization would proceed.  March stood foursquare for a Biblical foundation based on old line religious values, which he believed were threatened by free thinkers of the agnostic stripe represented by Tracy, who in turn thought his adversary's ideas antiquated and anti-intellectual.  Gene Kelly emerges in a different type of role from his usual delightful free spirit as highly cynical newspaper columnist E.K. Hornbeck, in actuality H.L. Mencken, like Drummond-Darrow an agnostic free thinker whose newspaper, The Baltimore Sun, put up the money to pay Clarence Darrow's legal fee in the Scopes Trial.Great supporting efforts are provided by Florence Eldridge, March's real life wife, who plays his supportive spouse in the film, by Dick York playing the Scopes role of town high school biology teacher, and Harry Morgan as trial judge.  Donna Anderson, used by Kramer to good advantage as Anthony Perkins' wife in ""On The Beach,"" does a convincing job as wife of York.",5,Equally Timely Forty Years Later,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,2410,"['issue', 'evolution', 'creationism', 'flaring', 'up', 'anew', 'current', 'legal', 'battles', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', '1960', 'film', 'retained', 'timeliness', 'was', 'period', 'vigorous', 'activity', 'Kramer', 'message', 'film', 'front', 'directed', 'produced', 'four', 'year', 'cycle', 'Defiant', 'Ones', '1958', 'examination', 'race', 'issue', 'America', 'starring', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Beach', 'controversial', 'film', 'nuclear', 'war', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'was', 'released', '1959', 'followed', 'turn', 'aforementioned', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', '1961', 'focused', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'German', 'judges', 'interpret', 'law', 'humanely', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'was', 'adapted', 'Kramer', 'screen', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'hit', 'written', 'Jerome', 'Lawrence', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'held', 'Dayton', 'Tennessee', '1922', 'names', 'were', 'changed', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'becoming', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'prosecutor', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'becoming', 'Matthew', 'Harrison', 'Brady', 'chief', 'issue', 'actual', 'trial', 'pitting', 'creationism', 'evolution', 'applied', 'classroom', 'remained', 'intact', 'Distinguished', 'veteran', 'stars', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Fredric', 'March', 'perform', 'astounding', 'brilliance', 'competing', 'individuals', 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'standard', 'bearers', 'important', 'causes', 'governing', 'how', 'civilization', 'would', 'proceed', 'March', 'stood', 'foursquare', 'Biblical', 'foundation', 'based', 'old', 'line', 'religious', 'values', 'believed', 'were', 'threatened', 'free', 'thinkers', 'agnostic', 'stripe', 'represented', 'Tracy', 'who', 'turn', 'thought', 'adversary', 'ideas', 'antiquated', 'anti-intellectual', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'different', 'type', 'role', 'usual', 'delightful', 'free', 'spirit', 'highly', 'cynical', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'E.K', 'Hornbeck', 'actuality', 'H.L', 'Mencken', 'Drummond-Darrow', 'agnostic', 'free', 'thinker', 'newspaper', 'Baltimore', 'Sun', 'put', 'up', 'money', 'pay', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'legal', 'fee', 'Scopes', 'Trial.Great', 'supporting', 'efforts', 'are', 'provided', 'Florence', 'Eldridge', 'March', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'who', 'supportive', 'spouse', 'film', 'Dick', 'York', 'playing', 'Scopes', 'role', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'trial', 'judge', 'Donna', 'Anderson', 'used', 'Kramer', 'good', 'advantage', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'wife', 'Beach', 'convincing', 'job', 'wife', 'York']",N/A

297022,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,6302120624,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[13, 14]","Inherit the Wind is the broad fictional adaptation of the real-life Scopes Monkey Trial in which John Scopes, a football coach who taught evolution in a high school classroom, was put on trial and the city of Dayton, Tennessee was put on the map... and not in a particularly pleasing light.Spencer Tracy and Frederic March turn out tremendously powerful performances as opposing lawyers in the trial, while Gene Kelly stands aloofly by as a flippant reporter for the Boston Globe.What is especially striking about Inherit the Wind is the relevance of the movie (almost 50 years later) to the current political atmosphere. In the 20's the law said that evolution couldn't be taught, and now it's creationism that can't be taught. As Tracy's Henry Drummond says in the film, ""Well, that's evolution for you.""The acting throughout the film is outstanding and it hardly feels like a two hour film, particularly in black and white. The entire film builds momentum until it all comes to a head at the very end with the showdown between Drummond (Tracy) and Brady (March). This is not a film to be missed if you're at all interested in history (although it's a loose adaptation) and the current intelligent design debate.Included on the disc is the original trailer for the film, which features a few clips from the film and then director Stanley Kramer discussing the film and listing awards that it won in festivals. It's interesting to see a trailer this old and compare it to our current trailers.",5,"Strangely, this film may be more relevant today than when it was made",1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,1494,"['Inherit', 'Wind', 'broad', 'fictional', 'adaptation', 'real-life', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'John', 'Scopes', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'taught', 'evolution', 'high', 'school', 'classroom', 'was', 'put', 'trial', 'city', 'Dayton', 'Tennessee', 'was', 'put', 'map', 'not', 'particularly', 'pleasing', 'light.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Frederic', 'March', 'turn', 'out', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'performances', 'opposing', 'lawyers', 'trial', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'aloofly', 'flippant', 'reporter', 'Boston', 'Globe.What', 'especially', 'striking', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'relevance', 'movie', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'later', 'current', 'political', 'atmosphere', '20', 'law', 'said', 'evolution', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'now', 'creationism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'Tracy', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'film', 'Well', 'evolution', 'acting', 'film', 'outstanding', 'hardly', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'particularly', 'black', 'white', 'entire', 'film', 'builds', 'momentum', 'head', 'very', 'end', 'showdown', 'Drummond', 'Tracy', 'Brady', 'March', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'missed', ""'re"", 'interested', 'history', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'current', 'intelligent', 'design', 'debate.Included', 'disc', 'original', 'trailer', 'film', 'few', 'clips', 'film', 'then', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'discussing', 'film', 'listing', 'awards', 'won', 'festivals', 'interesting', 'see', 'trailer', 'old', 'compare', 'current', 'trailers']",N/A
