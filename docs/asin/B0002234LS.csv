This movie had a pretty neat twist but it was pretty easy to figure out, especially after already watching Fightclub. I enjoyed the way Depp drove the movie and it wasn't as jumpy as I thought. I would give the movie a 2.5 stars of 5. I watched it because my dad borrowed it from a friend. It really didn't seem to stand out from other mystery thrillers I've seen. Depp plays a disturbed writer who has a fan come to his lakefront property claiming that Depp had plagiarized his work.

Apparently the rather simple act of divorce, simple at least for most people  if we are to believe the statistics, was enough to throw one famous mystery writer, Mort (played by Johnny Depp), over the edge, way over the edge.Perhaps it was finding his wife, Amy, in bed with another man; although event that traumatic experience can be accounted for since she has charged him with ""statutory neglect"" due to his writing fog mania withdrawal. Perhaps it was spending those ill-advised lonely months up in a secluded cabin where he was left to brood (and sleep) away his life. Perhaps it was just the cigarette withdrawal struggle that more than one of us has had troubles overcoming. In any case dear Mort (played by Depp with his usual odd-ball character pizzazz) has gone over the edge. And plans to do something about it. Nothing good.As if to prove that life is stranger than fiction  Mort makes up a scenario worthy, well, worthy of a Mort Rainey short story. He creates a savage alternative universe in order to get even with his wife, her lover, and anybody else who gets in the way of his godly intervention. And he gets away with it, for now.

This review may be a spoiler to those who have not seen the move.***  I would have given it 4 stars (5 would have been too much considering the real slow build up) were not for the end.  I'm a big fan of horror, and I don't mind when the villain wins once in awhile, given that it's put together just right.  Somehow, though, the end seemed to fall apart.  Here's a few reasons:1) The private detective Mort hired should have sensed something strange about Mort all along; maybe even by questioning his ex and her new lover (hmmm. . . that may have been a good start).2) Although I thought Mort's ex's new lover was a bit of a creep, by the end of the movie I understood why.  He knew Mort was crazy.  So why let her go see Mort by herself?  Furthermore, if he felt something bad was going to happen (which is why he ended up following her there) why not bring a gun or call the police or something?3) Didn't it seem odd that when the wife finally went into Mort's cabin and it was in ruins with the name Shooter scratched all over the place that she chose to go upstairs instead of getting help?4) And that sheriff; obviously he sensed something wrong about Mort, and possibly linked it to the two missing guys.

For one thing, he's a marvalous actor.  His portrayal of the frazzled writer was simply wonderful.

Not because monsters were jumping out every five seconds and people were getting slaughtered, but because of the eerie atmosphere, the building fear and paranoia, and that creepy guy screwing with Depp's mind.Many have also commented on how ""predictable"" the ending was.

Shooter wants things rectified by Rainey and wants what is ""right is right"".From here it is a game of cat and mouse as Rainey promises to obtain proof that his story is genuine and his own so that the evil and enigmatic Shooter will go way and leave him alone.Easier said than done as a chain of complicated matters and violent events plunge and pull Depp's character into the madness created by Shooter. Seems that Shooter has made one stipulation that if Rainey does not follow through with or comply, his refusal will only make matters worse for him and those around him---especially for his wife whom he is going through the painful proceedings of a divorce process. Acts of animal cruelty, bizarre murders (body count starting to rise around central character)with everything pointing towards the menacing and mysterious Shooter...I've never read the Stephen King story on which this film is based on so you won't get any ""love it"" or ""hate it"" comparisons from me between the book and film. There were quite a few obvious clues in the beginning of the film that pretty much gave away the ""surprise"" twist for me.There was a definite sense of predictability.Low and behold the movie's twist and ending is exactly the way I had envisioned it. I have seen this done so many times before in other previous movies using the same surprise premise. Was I disappointed? You bet.The only reason for the 4 stars is the outstanding performances by Depp , Dutton and Turturro!

Dutton's character was a bit underrated and could have used more film time as well as dialogue.Nevertheless, a great performance. Turturro as the mysterious and maniacal ""Shooter"" is an actor that can play such an evil role yet there is always something comedic in nature to his performance that adds that something to his sinister role.For those who have seen the dvd with the alternate ending, THAT is the ending I would have used for true Stephen King style and atmosphere !See Secret Window for a Saturday night at home flick and for the outstanding preformances by Depp, Tururro and Sutton but don't be shocked if you can figure out the twist from early on in the film !",4,Not Much Of A Secret...,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,2721,"['Best', 'selling', 'author', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'being', 'harrassed', ""n't"", 'understatement', 'psychopath', 'John', 'Shooter', 'who', 'Rainey', 'plagiarizing', 'what', 'own', 'story', 'Shooter', 'things', 'rectified', 'Rainey', 'what', 'right', 'right', 'here', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Rainey', 'obtain', 'proof', 'story', 'genuine', 'own', 'so', 'evil', 'enigmatic', 'Shooter', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'leave', 'alone.Easier', 'said', 'done', 'chain', 'complicated', 'matters', 'violent', 'events', 'plunge', 'pull', 'Depp', 'character', 'madness', 'created', 'Shooter', 'Shooter', 'made', 'one', 'stipulation', 'Rainey', 'not', 'follow', 'comply', 'refusal', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', '-especially', 'wife', 'whom', 'going', 'painful', 'proceedings', 'divorce', 'process', 'Acts', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'bizarre', 'murders', 'body', 'count', 'starting', 'rise', 'central', 'character', 'everything', 'pointing', 'menacing', 'mysterious', 'Shooter', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'love', 'hate', 'comparisons', 'book', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'obvious', 'clues', 'beginning', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'gave', 'away', 'surprise', 'twist', 'me.There', 'was', 'definite', 'sense', 'predictability.Low', 'behold', 'movie', 'twist', 'ending', 'exactly', 'way', 'had', 'envisioned', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'other', 'previous', 'movies', 'using', 'same', 'surprise', 'premise', 'Was', 'disappointed', 'bet.The', 'only', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Dutton', 'Turturro', 'Johnny', 'familiar', 'role', 'acting', 'territiory', 'tortured', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'sharp', 'sarcastic', 'right-back-at-ya-buddy', 'wit', 'hard', 'edged', 'cynicism', 'only', 'Depp', 'can', 'do', 'extremely', 'well', 'performances', 'crap.Period.A', 'fine', 'actor', 'never', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'creative', 'wheel', 'spinning', 'head', 'role', 'great', 'verve.Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'underrated', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'film', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue.Nevertheless', 'great', 'performance', 'Turturro', 'mysterious', 'maniacal', 'Shooter', 'actor', 'can', 'play', 'such', 'evil', 'role', 'yet', 'always', 'something', 'comedic', 'nature', 'performance', 'something', 'sinister', 'role.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'dvd', 'alternate', 'ending', 'THAT', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'true', 'Stephen', 'King', 'style', 'atmosphere', 'See', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Saturday', 'night', 'home', 'flick', 'outstanding', 'preformances', 'Depp', 'Tururro', 'Sutton', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'twist', 'early', 'film']",N/A
820913,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0002234LS,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 2]","eThis movie really kept me guessing, and guessing is always fun while you're in a dark movie theater, your eyes becoming more glued to the screen with every frame and your fingers clutching the seat with anxiousness. This movie will certainly do this for you. It's a true blast, and Johnny Depp is amazing as usual. He really has a knack for playing the offbeat character-- perhaps because he himself is offbeat, but in a way that makes you want to see more.Depp stars as Mort, a writer with a severe case of writer's block. He takes long naps, talks to his dog, sits at his computer hoping to write something other than ""bad writing,"" which he won't even bother with. If it's bad, he deletes it. There is no editing. So along comes John Shooter (Turturro) who claims that Mort stole a story of his who leaves behind his manuscript for Mort to look over. Mort is dismissive at first, but soon discovers that Shooter could be more of a problem than what he first thought.Did Mort really steal the story? Nah, and don't worrry-- my mentioning this is not really a spoiler. There's a bit of backstory in this movie with Mort's estranged wife and her new boyfriend and how Mort is coping with the fact that his wife is sleeping with someone other than her husband. I like that this movie is full of mystery, but isn't so twisted that you're not sure what's going on... well, until the end that is.This movie had an ending that I wasn't so thrilled with, and perhaps you may agree with me on it after you actually see the movie because I refuse to give away the twist ending. It's typical. That's all I'll say. (You may disagree-- I'm sure lots of people will like the ending, and I'll bet this is a movie that some people may see more than once, just to catch all those things they might have missed throughout it the first time.)I still give this movie five stars. Not only is Depp fantastic, as he always is, but even though I didn't really like the ending, I was NOT expecting it, and I can truly appreciate that. I love it when it's unexpected, and I'm sure audiences will have their mouths covered in amazement when the final revelation happens.This movie is definitely worth the few dollars to see at the movies. But don't get popcorn. You might not want it as the movie progresses.

Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control. Mort even confronts the boyfriend about it. Their conversation does not fit into the twist near the end of the movie, however. In fact, nothing fits in to the twist.This is a film with a secret, something we understand pretty soon. I will not reveal it, but most people will come up with an idea and find out they are right.

820915,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002234LS,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","Adapting Stephen King into movies has been a risky thing. It's a hit and miss affair, with plenty more misses than hits here lately with the last few film adaptions of his stories and novels. They are still never less than interesting. And so, we have another film adaption of a short story by King, this one from ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"". Writer David Koepp writes the story into a pretty good screenplay, emphasizing on subtle tricks and pacing. Johnny Depp stars in the film as Mort Rainey, A grungy, near divorced author with wild hair who keeps to himself in his rustic old cabin in the woods near a beautiful lake. The opening of the film immediatley fills you in on why Mort has gotten to this stage, and why he is living in this secluded cabin. Trying to knock out another story, Mort is quickly confronted by a Mississippi man named John Shooter(eerily played by John Turturro), who claims that Mort plaigarised his ""Secret Window"" story, and is now out to seek that wrongs be turned into rights. It is quickly obvious that Mr. Shooter is not a well man, and his demeanor quickly turns psychotic and dangerous. Mort swears he wrote his story first, and sets out to prove this fact to Shooter before this strange man causes him, or anyone else, more harm. All at the same time that Mort is going thru an unhappy divorce with his wife Amy(Maria Bello), and her current boyfriend Ted(Timothy Hutton)is sticking his nose in. Charles S. Dutton is along for the ride as a lawyer friend of Mort's who is out to help him with Shooter. Len Cairou also co-stars as the local town sheriff. Isn't there always a local town sheriff in stories like these?. The movie hangs on Depp's every move. Every word. Every action. It's a small cast and it is all basically up to him, because he is in every scene, and a lot of the time it's just him alone. But this is Johnny Depp. It can be garbage, and he will still own every scene. Fortunatley for us, Mort Rainey is an interesting character. Another eccentric in Johnny's long catalogue of eccentric characters that he is a master at. It may not be as big or splashy or memorable as most of his other roles, but Depp infuses enough distinct personality, presence, and tics into Mort, that he is a full fleshed character that carries the entire film from start to finish. Not sure if I liked the hair yet or not. Turturro has always been a great actor, and his portrayal of Shooter is one of immense unease. With this southern drawl, big hat, and laid back ease, his John Shooter is a strange and memorable man. He brings the right balance of meance and humor, without overdoing it. Any time I see Turturro now, I will be seeing and hearing John Shooter. The rest do with what they have. Hutton, who starred in the King film ""The Dark Half"", is pretty much stuck in the ""new boyfriend is a jerk and how can I get rid of him?"" role. He's just fine, but it's a role with little in the way of a rewarding outcome. Maria Bello pretty much has the same fate. She does well with the material, but her role pretty much becomes nothing more than the ex turned damsel in distress. Dutton, who is always a likeable and strong presence, doesn't fare much better, but his being there alone elevates the movie. The film moves along at a pretty slow pace. It's not a slam bang type of a rush thriller. It plays it slowly, and lets it all seep in and build. Some may see the ending coming. Some may not. Some may think it's a disappointing cop out, while others see it as a fitting and interesting end. Whichever way you see it, it pretty much works. I was not necessarily shocked with the outcome, but I definitley didn't expect some of the events that did happen in the finale. It's not a really great movie, just a pretty good one. Not the best Stephen King adaption either, but better than a lot of his movie adaptions of late. But this is Johnny's movie, and he does another fine job that makes the movie better than what it is.",3,"""You Stole My Story....""",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,3963,"['Adapting', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'been', 'risky', 'thing', 'hit', 'miss', 'affair', 'plenty', 'more', 'misses', 'hits', 'here', 'lately', 'last', 'few', 'film', 'adaptions', 'stories', 'novels', 'are', 'still', 'never', 'less', 'interesting', 'so', 'have', 'film', 'adaption', 'short', 'story', 'King', 'one', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Writer', 'David', 'Koepp', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'screenplay', 'emphasizing', 'subtle', 'tricks', 'pacing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'stars', 'film', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'A', 'grungy', 'divorced', 'author', 'wild', 'hair', 'who', 'rustic', 'old', 'cabin', 'woods', 'beautiful', 'lake', 'opening', 'film', 'immediatley', 'fills', 'why', 'Mort', 'gotten', 'stage', 'why', 'living', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'Trying', 'knock', 'out', 'story', 'Mort', 'quickly', 'confronted', 'Mississippi', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Shooter', 'eerily', 'played', 'John', 'Turturro', 'who', 'Mort', 'plaigarised', 'Secret', 'Window', 'story', 'now', 'seek', 'wrongs', 'be', 'turned', 'rights', 'quickly', 'obvious', 'Mr.', 'Shooter', 'not', 'well', 'man', 'demeanor', 'quickly', 'psychotic', 'dangerous', 'Mort', 'wrote', 'story', 'first', 'out', 'prove', 'fact', 'Shooter', 'strange', 'man', 'anyone', 'else', 'more', 'harm', 'same', 'time', 'Mort', 'going', 'unhappy', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Ted', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'sticking', 'nose', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'along', 'ride', 'lawyer', 'friend', 'Mort', 'who', 'out', 'help', 'Shooter', 'Len', 'Cairou', 'also', 'local', 'town', 'sheriff', ""n't"", 'always', 'local', 'town', 'sheriff', 'stories', 'movie', 'hangs', 'Depp', 'move', 'word', 'action', 'small', 'cast', 'basically', 'up', 'scene', 'lot', 'time', 'just', 'alone', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'can', 'be', 'garbage', 'will', 'still', 'own', 'scene', 'Fortunatley', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'interesting', 'character', 'eccentric', 'Johnny', 'long', 'catalogue', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'master', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'splashy', 'memorable', 'most', 'other', 'roles', 'Depp', 'enough', 'distinct', 'personality', 'presence', 'tics', 'Mort', 'full', 'fleshed', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'Not', 'sure', 'liked', 'hair', 'yet', 'not', 'Turturro', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Shooter', 'one', 'immense', 'unease', 'southern', 'drawl', 'big', 'hat', 'laid', 'back', 'ease', 'John', 'Shooter', 'strange', 'memorable', 'man', 'right', 'balance', 'meance', 'humor', 'overdoing', 'Any', 'time', 'see', 'Turturro', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'John', 'Shooter', 'rest', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'Hutton', 'who', 'starred', 'King', 'film', 'Dark', 'Half', 'pretty', 'much', 'stuck', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'jerk', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'role', 'just', 'fine', 'role', 'little', 'way', 'rewarding', 'outcome', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'fate', 'well', 'material', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'more', 'ex', 'turned', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Dutton', 'who', 'always', 'likeable', 'strong', 'presence', ""n't"", 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'being', 'alone', 'movie', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'pretty', 'slow', 'pace', 'not', 'slam', 'bang', 'type', 'rush', 'thriller', 'slowly', 'seep', 'build', 'may', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'may', 'not', 'may', 'think', 'disappointing', 'cop', 'others', 'see', 'fitting', 'interesting', 'end', 'Whichever', 'way', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'works', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'shocked', 'outcome', 'definitley', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'events', 'did', 'happen', 'finale', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'Not', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaption', 'either', 'better', 'lot', 'movie', 'adaptions', 'late', 'Johnny', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'movie', 'better', 'what']",N/A

820919,A33693RRRFK55Q,B0002234LS,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[4, 5]","OK, so I saw the film last night in the theatre, my boyfriend and I seated amidst a throng of mostly teenage girls and a couple of their boyfriends.  The trailers ran in exactly this order, by genre: chick flick, suspense thriller, chick flick, suspense thriller, chick flick, suspense thriller.  Like clockwork I tell ya.  Now normally if I'm seeing a film and there are as many as three previews targeted at the Britney demo, no matter how they try to buffer it, I run out screaming in a cloud of popcorn and Sour Patch Kids; but in this case I assured myself that Johnny Depp's mere name on the project accounted for all its associations with projects starring Julia Styles and such-like.  I was only there myself because I happened to read the story by Stephen King upon which it's based (by accident, I swear), and I wanted to compare and contrast or something.  I can't say I was very hopeful of it being a masterpiece or necessarily, you know, watchable - I'm a veteran of ""Maximum Overdrive"" - but I had the night to kill so whatever.Anyway, the film starts off right in line with the book, although Mr. Depp naturally cuts more of a bohemian swath than I had pictured for the protagonist, Mort Rainey.  Everything is rushed along for time, but the deal in a nutshell is that erstwhile fiction author Mort just got divorced after finding his wife in bed with a third party, and he now spends most of every day sleeping on the couch in his isolated vacation house on the lake, she having predictably landed their primary residence in town.  He tries to write but can't; he's obviously depressed, still trying to get over the apparent senselessness of his wife's infidelity.  And because he's Johnny Depp, all this is powerful stuff for the teenage girls in the audience, who go crazy over his slovenly, dejected magnetism.  I daresay that's one subtext that wasn't present in the book.  Then, seemingly just to complicate things for Mort at this vulnerable time in his life, some crazy backwoods lunatic from Mississippi (name of John Shooter) shows up at his door and accuses him of ""stealing his story.""  Mort knows he wrote the story in question and that therefore this guy is nuts, but he can't convince the guy of same.  You know where this is going.  Before long the guy starts to terrorize our sexy little reject, slaying his pets and destroying his property and threatening further vengeance until Mort ""sets things right"" by writing a new ending and giving Shooter credit for it.This is one departure from King's short story, in which both men's versions are complete and virtually identical start to finish, and Shooter asks for an entirely new story to be written.  But the major departure is the ending, which I'll have the courtesy not to discuss.  The movie takes it in an entirely different direction, presumably just to give it a little more punch, but I've still heard all the critics complain that it peters out at the end.  And really, it does.  Once you figure out the ""twist,"" which could happen at any point in the film because it is the most commonplace plot twist EVER, you probably just won't care anymore, cuz the film doesn't offer much further.I wasn't necessarily ""disappointed"" with ""Secret Window,"" but I think I mentioned what my expectations were.  It was a little more interesting than it might have been, and all else aside, Johnny Depp did a decent job - I didn't expect the character to dress like that and have that particular hair but it never really seemed at odds with him, even added a certain dimension of mild interest.  (Actually, imagine if they got somebody as infernally boring as Ben Affleck to play Mort - in that event ""Window"" would definitively suck, although it would still draw the same audience.)  I definitely think they could've picked a much more intimidating redneck to play John Shooter; Turturro scares me about as much as Martha Stewart.  I was thinking of DeNiro in ""Cape Fear"" mixed with oh, the Marlboro Man or somebody.  I guess my final verdict would be: see this if you have nothing else to do.  But basically that just means: find something else to do.",3,A Mystery Even to Me.,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,4129,"['OK', 'saw', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'theatre', 'boyfriend', 'seated', 'amidst', 'throng', 'mostly', 'teenage', 'girls', 'couple', 'boyfriends', 'trailers', 'ran', 'exactly', 'order', 'genre', 'chick', 'flick', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'chick', 'flick', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'chick', 'flick', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'clockwork', 'tell', 'ya', 'Now', 'normally', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'film', 'are', 'as', 'many', 'three', 'previews', 'targeted', 'Britney', 'demo', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'buffer', 'run', 'out', 'screaming', 'cloud', 'popcorn', 'Sour', 'Patch', 'Kids', 'case', 'assured', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'mere', 'name', 'project', 'accounted', 'associations', 'projects', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'such-like', 'was', 'only', 'there', 'happened', 'read', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'based', 'accident', 'swear', 'wanted', 'compare', 'contrast', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'very', 'hopeful', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'necessarily', 'know', 'watchable', ""'m"", 'veteran', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'had', 'night', 'kill', 'so', 'whatever.Anyway', 'film', 'off', 'right', 'line', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Depp', 'naturally', 'more', 'bohemian', 'swath', 'had', 'pictured', 'protagonist', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'Everything', 'rushed', 'time', 'deal', 'nutshell', 'erstwhile', 'fiction', 'author', 'Mort', 'just', 'got', 'divorced', 'finding', 'wife', 'bed', 'third', 'party', 'now', 'most', 'day', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'isolated', 'vacation', 'house', 'lake', 'having', 'predictably', 'landed', 'primary', 'residence', 'town', 'write', 'ca', ""n't"", 'obviously', 'depressed', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'apparent', 'senselessness', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'teenage', 'girls', 'audience', 'who', 'go', 'crazy', 'slovenly', 'dejected', 'magnetism', 'daresay', 'one', 'subtext', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'book', 'Then', 'seemingly', 'just', 'complicate', 'things', 'Mort', 'vulnerable', 'time', 'life', 'crazy', 'backwoods', 'lunatic', 'Mississippi', 'name', 'John', 'Shooter', 'up', 'door', 'stealing', 'story', 'Mort', 'wrote', 'story', 'question', 'therefore', 'guy', 'nuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'convince', 'guy', 'same', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'long', 'guy', 'terrorize', 'sexy', 'little', 'reject', 'slaying', 'pets', 'destroying', 'property', 'threatening', 'further', 'vengeance', 'Mort', 'sets', 'things', 'right', 'writing', 'new', 'ending', 'giving', 'Shooter', 'credit', 'it.This', 'one', 'departure', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'men', 'versions', 'are', 'complete', 'virtually', 'identical', 'start', 'finish', 'Shooter', 'entirely', 'new', 'story', 'be', 'written', 'major', 'departure', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'have', 'courtesy', 'not', 'discuss', 'movie', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'presumably', 'just', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'punch', ""'ve"", 'still', 'heard', 'critics', 'complain', 'out', 'end', 'really', 'Once', 'figure', 'out', 'twist', 'could', 'happen', 'point', 'film', 'most', 'commonplace', 'plot', 'twist', 'EVER', 'probably', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'cuz', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'further.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'disappointed', 'Secret', 'Window', 'think', 'mentioned', 'what', 'expectations', 'were', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'else', 'aside', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'character', 'dress', 'have', 'particular', 'hair', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'odds', 'even', 'added', 'certain', 'dimension', 'mild', 'interest', 'Actually', 'imagine', 'got', 'somebody', 'infernally', 'boring', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'play', 'Mort', 'event', 'Window', 'would', 'definitively', 'suck', 'would', 'still', 'draw', 'same', 'audience', 'definitely', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'much', 'more', 'intimidating', 'redneck', 'play', 'John', 'Shooter', 'Turturro', 'as', 'much', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'was', 'thinking', 'DeNiro', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'mixed', 'oh', 'Marlboro', 'Man', 'somebody', 'guess', 'final', 'verdict', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'basically', 'just', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'do']",N/A

Johnny Depp is portraying yet another of his kinky characters. He did some extra good acting in the manifestation scene. Had this movie been considered for the Academy instead of the pirate thing, he just might have won.  Most of the time he went around looking like a frazzled, depressed housewife with that unkempt hair; it appears he had not had a haircut in six months and never combed or brushed it. The glasses did not make him look studious, just unattractive.As a frustrated writer, he has isolated himself in a cabin by a lake in upstate New York. The Fall leaves were gorgeous. This lovely locale could have been right out of Tim O'Brian's IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS. The agitated squirrel in the woods was effective. The dog, on the other hand, was another matter altogether. Poor thing.  The quarry where some of the activity took place looked like one here beside Fort Dickerson filled with putrid water. The writer is allegedly stalked by a nasty Southern man from Mississippi -- sure does talk funny. Ted, however supposedly from Tennessee, did not have a Southern accent, did not sound anything like any of our three sections of the state. East, Middle, West TN. all have different accents. He had none of them.Were these tormentors actual or merely figments of his own imagination? Like in THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, it was hard to tell what was real and not. He was pushed completely around the bend; could it have been caused by the Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey (which explains a lot)?  This was as macabre as Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Tell-tale Heart"" and as scary as CHILDREN OF THE CORN minus the children, but with the corn. He seemed as crazy as his harasser, talking to himself and even answering. Apparently he was facing his own demons.He acted out the 'new' ending to a story he was obsessed with possibly copying it word for word from another author. His belief that the ending is the most important part of a story, as in ALEX AND EMMA; he even talked different and looked like a normal person after the conclusion was accomplished. Though the inhabitants of the town considered him a weirdo.  You are subjected to gross murder, dead dog, burnt down house in Riverdale and an unfaithful wife.

It masquerades itself as a psychological thriller, while in fact it's just another pay check, just another PG-13 thriller. Count the number of times the f-word is mentioned - it's fun to do in those films. And the level of violence, too (even though a dog does get stabbed in the head, as well as three other people, ooohhh....) ""Secret Window"" is a plodding, assured testimonial to all twist-ending-PG-13-star-studded-stuff out there.The plot involves a novelist (Depp in nerdy glasses), who isolates himself in a cabin deep in the woods. He talks to his dog, and the `highlights' include him trying to quit smoking (really, is there subtext in that, or is the director just throwing out another clich&eacute;, and ponders it, like there's no tomorrow?!) A creep called Shooter visit's the novelist one afternoon, claiming the writer stole his story. John Turturro's understated, thickly accented performance feels out of place, as if he walked in from a better film. From that point on, Shooter periodically appears, sinister stuff happening in-between his visits. To unnecessarily complicate the plot a little, Koepp throws in a little history, involving the writer's ex-wife (Maria Bello), who is now married to another eerie and suspicious character (Timothy Hutton, welcome back!)The thrills are half-arsed post-""Sixth Sense"" cliches (opening windows, creepy noises). ""Secret Window"" also wins the award for the most predictable ending. As if Koepp realized that 90% of his audiences will guess the outcome within the first 15 minutes, when they are palpably distracted by unnecessary characters, he added an ending with an obvious homage to King. It involves lots of corn, and basically describes the movie.I was going to give ""Secret window"" a generous two stars, for the film at least sustaining a mood more-or-less effectively with some tricky imagery, and for Depp's performance, which, despite lacking his usual stimulation, manages to hold the film together nevertheless...But no, it's time to stop being generous, and for David Koepp to re-watch ""Apartment Zero"" before attempting another directorial undertaking.",1,What's so Secret?,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,2286,"['Based', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'film', 'around', 'straightforward', 'concept', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'peculiarity', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'script', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'fact', 'just', 'pay', 'check', 'just', 'PG-13', 'thriller', 'Count', 'number', 'times', 'f-word', 'mentioned', 'fun', 'do', 'films', 'level', 'violence', 'too', 'even', 'dog', 'get', 'stabbed', 'head', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'ooohhh', 'Secret', 'Window', 'plodding', 'assured', 'testimonial', 'twist-ending-PG-13-star-studded-stuff', 'out', 'there.The', 'plot', 'novelist', 'Depp', 'nerdy', 'glasses', 'who', 'cabin', 'deep', 'woods', 'dog', 'highlights', 'include', 'trying', 'quit', 'smoking', 'really', 'there', 'subtext', 'director', 'just', 'throwing', 'out', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ponders', 'tomorrow', 'creep', 'called', 'Shooter', 'visit', 'novelist', 'one', 'afternoon', 'claiming', 'writer', 'stole', 'story', 'John', 'Turturro', 'understated', 'thickly', 'accented', 'performance', 'feels', 'place', 'walked', 'better', 'film', 'point', 'Shooter', 'periodically', 'sinister', 'stuff', 'happening', 'in-between', 'visits', 'unnecessarily', 'complicate', 'plot', 'little', 'Koepp', 'little', 'history', 'involving', 'writer', 'ex-wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'now', 'married', 'eerie', 'suspicious', 'character', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'welcome', 'back', 'thrills', 'are', 'half-arsed', 'post-', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'cliches', 'opening', 'windows', 'creepy', 'noises', 'Secret', 'Window', 'also', 'award', 'most', 'predictable', 'ending', 'Koepp', 'realized', '90', '%', 'audiences', 'will', 'guess', 'outcome', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'when', 'are', 'palpably', 'distracted', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'added', 'ending', 'obvious', 'homage', 'King', 'lots', 'corn', 'basically', 'movie.I', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'Secret', 'window', 'generous', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'least', 'sustaining', 'mood', 'more-or-less', 'effectively', 'tricky', 'imagery', 'Depp', 'performance', 'lacking', 'usual', 'stimulation', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'nevertheless', 'time', 'stop', 'being', 'generous', 'David', 'Koepp', 're-watch', 'Apartment', 'Zero', 'attempting', 'directorial', 'undertaking']",N/A

He is in the middle of an ugly divorce with his wife (Bello) and he has terrible writer's block. So he goes to live in the middle of the woods in his cabin...alone...to try and write. Not with the arrival of John Shooter (Tuturro) claiming that Rainey had stolen his story, Mort's life slowly slides out of control.The movie is based upon the Stephen King short story ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" in his ""Four Past Midnight"" collection and does at times have the feel of a Stephen King novel throughout the movie. With a PG-13, the blood and gore level is not as high as some of King's other movie adaptations (""Dreamcatcher"", ""It"", ""The Shining"") but there is not a lot of suspense and I called the twist 40 minutes in.What Worked?Well, the cast is great! Depp, Tuturro, Bello, and Dutton are all great actors and give the best performances they can. Like always, Johnny Depp (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"", ""The Ninth Gate"") is amazing and entertains. He really saves the movie. John Tuturro (""Mr. Deeds"", ""O, Brother Where Art Thou?"") gave a creepy but not that menacing performance was John Shooter. Maria Bello (""Coyote Ugly"", ""The Cooler"") gave an emotionally driven performance as Depp's soon to be ex-wife. And Charles Dutton (""Against the Ropes"", ""Gothika"") was good as well. The cast is the high point of the film.Next I loved the scenery and the music. Since the movie was not all that scary the creepy wilderness scenery and the great score by Phillip Glass (""Taking Lives"", ""The Hours"") really made the movie a little scarier.What didn't work?Well... the movie was extremely predictable! I called the twist not even an hour into the movie! I was very disappointed that I was right! The way the movie looked from the trailer was a suspense filled thrill ride with action and plenty of scares. It was scary until Shooter kept showing up and making threats and then would not do anything! There could have been some freaky chase through the woods, lurking in the shadows type scenes...but there was noting like that. Shooter never jumped out of nowhere or anything, when he showed up he would just talk to Depp character!?The worst part of the movie was the ending! Like I said anyone who likes murder mysteries, horror, thriller movies will be somewhat disappointed because if you know how to watch then correctly you can call this movie from a mile away!

They are dealig with what they THOUGHT the movie was going to be, or should have been, and that's not the point, people.  Deal with what the movie IS.It's a Hitchcockian psychological thriller.  That means that you actually have to think about people's motivations and feelings, and consider them in terms of the larger context.  I'm not giving away any spoilers here, so I can't be too specific, but if you've seen the movie, then you know why Mort can't run away from Shooter (a question one reviewer had, along with wondering why Mort wouldn't have realized the truth right off the bat).  The answer to those two questions ought to be obvious to nayone who actually paid attention.If you haven't seen the movie and are considering getting it, here's what I've got to say: (1) it's NOT a horror movie, and is in no way scary, only a little creepy and morbid, but definitely not scary, so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for; (2) Depp is absolutely brilliant, although that can't come as much of a surprise; (3) the pace is fairly slow, and there is not a great deal that &quot;happens&quot; -- this is a movie composed of lovingly rendered little moments, as opposed to overblown big moments like car chases or fistfights; (4) the DVDs special features are excellent, including a very informative and enlightening commentary track and a solid hours' worth of documentary, and this material should spell out very explicitly the themes and concerns of the filmmakers if you are left wondering by the film what they were; (5) as far as imitation Hitchcock goes, this is pretty good.

820945,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0002234LS,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","I'm not giving anything away by saying the 2004 film ""Secret Window"" has a twist ending. From the opening scenes, with steadfast determination, you know there's going to be a twist ending. There will be no spoilers in this review, suffice to say if you cannot anticipate a twist, you haven't been watching films long. Based on the prolific American institution of a Stephen King story, ""Secret Window"" has interesting ideas. While I have no knowledge of King's inspiration, I suspect every successful writer has a nut on the doorstep claiming their story was stolen.That's exactly what happens in ""Secret Window."" In a nice turn, Johnny Depp plays successful mystery writer Morton Rainey, presently immersed in slothful depression. His wife left him and he spends his days in a remote cabin adorned in a bathrobe. He's working on a book, though appears to be suffering from writer's block. He's unshaven, in need of a haircut and painfully relives the moment he caught his wife in bed with another man. There's a knock at the door and standing before him is John Turturro with a Mississippi accent. If that combination is not terrifying enough, Turturro menacingly states, ""Ya stole ma story."" I love Turturro and think he's one of the finest character actors working today. A New York talent at home in urban roles, his casting as a Bill McKinney hick is the film's first misstep. Perhaps filmmakers were hoping to capture the Preacher Harry Powell vibe ofThe Night of the Hunter, but never for a moment did I believe Turturro's Johnny Shooter was plausible.Shooter begins stalking the reclusive writer, terrorizing his pet and following him to his wife's house in the city. Rainey's wife Amy is played by the lovely Maria Bello, who's now residing in their former home with the new boyfriend (Timothy Hutton) hovering around with great irritation. She's impatiently awaiting Rainey to sign the divorce papers, which he's too busy to do because, well, he's working on that new story. Rainey's more concerned with finding an old issue of a magazine to disprove Shooter's persistent claims of plagiarism. Shooter, usually stepping from behind a tree, sets a deadline for Rainey to find the magazine or he's going to ruin his life.David Koepp directed this film, a good screenplay writer who pennedPanic Room. He also wrote and directed the interestingThe Trigger Effect. Both credits reveal the issues I have with his work. ""Panic Room"" was directed by David Fincher and it's arguably one of his weakest films. But Fincher's gloomy eye, the most talented of his generation, raises the story's so-so level into an unusually atmospheric chiller. ""The Trigger Effect,"" involving an unexplained blackout, completely collapses during its final third as desperate protagonists head for the California hills of white sunshine, with a uniquely sinister atmosphere lost in the rear view mirror. I'm not sure Koepp has the right instinct for such darkness, as his films scream for a demented Hitchcock/Polanski auteur with forlorn demeanor (Psycho (1960),Repulsion). There's barely an inspired shadow in ""Secret Window,"" with the cheery look of a Palmolive TV commercial.Depp's jittery performance also has a comedic edge, inconsistent with the increasingly bleak momentum. To his credit, he does some earnest work as Rainey in what amounts to the only substantial role in the film. Most importantly, if a film is going to have the aforementioned twist, you better fool the viewer until the final curtain. Perhaps the greatest twist in cinematic history was M. Night Shyamalan'sThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series), a brilliant perfect-storm maelstrom of Rod Serling-esque atmosphere.

Johnny Depp's performance as an author of some renown, the cuckold husband in the midst of a sticky divorce, attempting to write again, is a smooth mixture of light comedy, witty one-liners and an experienced sense of the dramatic, rendered with unconscious precision. This popular American actor is at the top of his form because he makes it look so easy.When this picture first hit the big screen, practitioner-critics from around the world agreed that it had the potential to be a very good film, but settled for something much less. The problem, they believed, was an identity problem: it couldn't decide whether to be a dramatic comedy or a serious thriller - it attempted to achieve both and failed on all counts. It was said as well that Depp is the film's only saving grace, and without his name and talent, its box office run should not have lasted more than a few days. I couldn't disagree more. Depp's performance certainly carried the film along, but the overall editing, creative and tight, and the soundtrack by Phillip Glass, reminiscent of old Hitchcock films, provided enough atmospheric suspense to ensure the audience remained riveted from start to finish.Secret Window did not set out to be original, reach any box office records or change the face of filmmaking. It is simply a good story, adapted to the screen for the single purpose to entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously nor did the filmmaker's intend it to be taken as such. Depp appeared to have a good time making the film and a lot of us had a good time watching it, too.

820949,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0002234LS,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 5]","Johnny Depp, outspoken critic of `freedom fries' (`I was ecstatic they re-named 'French Fries' as 'Freedom Fries.' Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots.'), has certainly had long and colorful career, but I'll always remember him a Glen Lutz from his very first film A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).  His popularity seemed to wan a bit, that was until he appeared in the blockbuster hit Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and is set to also appear in the following sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (2007).  Somewhere in there he managed to find time to star in this film, Secret Window (2004), one of four films he appeared in during 2004.  The film, based off a Stephen King story entitled `Secret Window, Secret Garden', was written and directed by David Koepp (Stir of Echoes), and, along with Depp, stars John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), and Maria Bello (Payback).  Also appearing is Timothy Hutton (The Dark Half), Charles S. Dutton (Mimic), and Len Cariou (About Schmidt).Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer who's not only suffering from a mild case of writers block (and usually a wicked case of the bed head), but is also knee deep in divorce proceedings with his estranged wife Amy (Bello).  Seems Mort found Amy in the arms (and bed) of another man named Ted (Hutton), and this prompted their separation (apparently their marriage had been suffering for some time, and Amy's liaison was the point when they decided to call it quits)...but the divorce has yet to be finalized, due to Mort dragging his feet on signing the papers.  In line with the saying that `when it rains, it pours', Mort also finds himself accused of plagiarism by a hillbilly sort named John Shooter (Turturro), who turns out to be more than just your garden variety nut job, as he begins stalking Mort, leaving ominous messages and threatening even worse if Mort doesn't `make things right' (Mort claims to have proof that he didn't steal the story, as it was published in a magazine some years before Shooter claims to have written his).  So not only does Mort have his wife and her somewhat greasy boyfriend to deal with (they're pushing him to sign the papers), but Shooter keeps upping the stakes, presenting Mort with little mementos regarding the ever increasing serious nature of his intent.Without actually giving away the nature of the story, specifically the characters, I will say I've seen similar aspects of this story before.  It's not that I necessarily recognized the elements as they were presented, but about halfway through I sort of knew where we were headed.  The interesting thing is how writer /director Koepp decided to `let the cat' out of the bag, in particular with the slow build up and relatively quiet realization (about three-quarters of the way in), rather than a more sensational revelation near the end (he describes his reasoning for this, and many other choices, in one of the featurettes).  I thought it was a nice twist.  While I did find some of the elements predictable, the film was still fun and entertaining to me based on the performances, scripting, and well thought out direction.  I enjoyed Depp's character a lot, and I thought he did a good job bringing Mort to life, infusing him with all kinds of humanizing mannerisms and an overall realistic tone.  I thought Turturro's character was a little off in the beginning (not the psychological make up of the character himself, but the performance) as his southern drawl distracted me a little bit, but I did get used to it, and given the true nature of the character, it worked (I still think the choice of a different actor for this part may have worked better, but that's neither here nor there).  Maria Bello...I'm not especially particular to blondes (I like them brunettes), but I've always found her pleasing to watch, not only as an actress but also as a hot babe.  I think she did relatively well, even if her role wasn't often as well defined as I thought it should have been, but perhaps this was the intent as we are supposed to focus our attention on Depp's character, and the fact that he was on the short end of the relationship stick.  I thought the direction was very well done, as Koepp certainly knows how to relate a story and get a desired effect from the audience, that audience being myself.  He used a lot of literal interpretations within the film (they not always obvious when first presented) and I was sort of on the fence about this aspect, but then I remembered one of Depp's previous films, The Ninth Gate (1999), by Roman Polanski, and how much trouble I had picking up on the subtle, sometimes completely obscure, concepts presented there, and found myself comfortable in the fact I didn't have to exert my brain as much here as I did there.  I don't mind films with ambiguous stories, open to all kinds of interpretation, but some directors can take it too far, forgoing the audience's enjoyment for the sake of their own, bizarre conceptualizations (in terms of Polanski, I've found I either really like his films like Chinatown, or I'm completely annoyed by them as in The Ninth Gate.The wide screen (2.40:1 aspect ratio) looks really good on this DVD, as the colors are rich and vibrant, along with clear definition between the light and the dark.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is also excellent, and comes through clear.  There are a number of extras on this DVD including three featurettes (From Book to Film, A Look Through It, and Secrets Revealed), Animatics (animated storyboards), a director's commentary, four deleted scenes (two with directors commentary), and a number of previews for other Columbia/Tristar releases.Cookieman108",4,"""I don't respond well to intimidation.

But Depp fans are used to him delivering the goods, aren't they?  Yes would be the correct answer...It is Johnny's little quirks and piffy comments, that one would swear had to be Depp's own toss-ins, which make this movie so easy to love.  When the young woman at the post office tells him he looks pale and he responds, ""thanks"", the dialogue flowed so well it seemed like a camera man had caught the two just having a daily conversation without them knowing they were being filmed; now that's acting.The plot is great.  I didn't have a hard time figuring out where the movie was taking me, but it managed to make a figured-out-early-plot still ride quite nice.  There are a lot of scary parts, a lot of supenseful parts, and some really cool twists in this suspense - thriller.The beginning of the movie grabs you - with Johnny Depp's character being accused of plagiarism by a very strange fellow.

The famous novelist (played effortlessly by Johnny Depp, who earns this wreck its single star) is holed up in his Maine retreat, reeling from his wife's adultery, on the cusp of a brutal divorce, and battling one Grendel of a writer's block.And don't you know, when it rains, it pours: right in the middle of his nap, a furious stranger in a broad-brimmed hat comes rap-rap-rapping at his Chamber Door, accusing the befuddled novelist of ""stealing his story"". Would I sit through this shipwreck of a snorefest again? Quoth John Shooter: ""Nevermore"".I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this flick; it had all of the promising ingredients for a spooky little potboiler. It's based on the Stephen King's novella ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"", which is an intimate and nasty tale of obsession and madness and one of the juiciest in King's ""Four Past Midnight"". It has Johnny Depp, who can charm the camera with a quirky frown, and John Turturro, equally adept at eccentric roles.Director David Koepp made his directorial debut with the stylish ""Stir of Echoes"", while Director of Photography Fred Murphy obviously knows how to wield a camera: he turned out the masterfully moody camera-work in ""Mothman Prophecies"". ""Secret Window"" even has Philip Glass doing the stress-inducing soundtrack.And certainly the movie starts on the right note: we see Johnny Depp hunched in the driver's seat of a car, toboggan pulled down over his maniac locks, scowling face a-twitch, a snowstorm howling outside the car window.All good stuff, made even more tantalizing when we shift forward six months after the intro's wicked little revelation: now we're holed up in a spooky cabin on equally spooky lake, with a devoted dog, tormented writer, disintegrating marriage, and crazy on the doorstep.What's not to love? Nearly everything.If the synopsis I've given you sounds intriguing, then pick up a copy of Stephen King's ""Four Past Midnight"" and read the very creepy story. Unless you're a hardcore Depp fanatic, a masochist, or an insomniac, you'll get no pleasure from this one-way ticket to Dullsville.Koepp gives us no suspense, no tension, no momentum, no scares, certainly no horror. ""Secret Window"" is strictly by the numbers, and twenty minutes into the thing it felt like all hands aboard the project---with the exception of the inventive Depp---had lost interest.The direction is dull, the pace plodding, the camerawork listless and strictly point-and-shoot, and worse still, the film's aimlessness seems to infect the actors.The usually interesting Timothy Hutton's (adulterer Teddy) mystifying inclusion merely serves as a reminder of just how good---relatively speaking---the similarly themed ""The Dark Half"" really was.The charismatic Charles Dutton (Ken Karsch) is wasted in a role (big, bearish, overconfident P.I.)that was stale back in ""Thinner"" and ""Cape Fear"": he goes through the motions and cashes a check. Maria Bello (Amy) does her best work accompanied by a side order of corn. John Turturro (Shooter)lets the hat do the acting.It's not that ""Secret Window"" is a howlingly horrible movie---if Koepp had taken some chances, played with the movie, let Depp's natural charisma percolate through the rest of this mummified corpse of a movie, the thing might have had some quirky cult appeal. No hope for the patient, alas: the film is delivered on the slab smelling of formaldehyde and stinking of rot.That said, at the very least, ""Secret Window"" really made me empathize with poor crazy old John Shooter. Shooter claimed Rainey had stolen his story, he wanted it back, and he was out for blood. Same with me: ""Secret Window"" stole my 90 minutes, I want it back, and I'm out for blood.JSG",1,"All Hat, no Cattle",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,3725,"['Poor', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'famous', 'novelist', 'played', 'effortlessly', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'wreck', 'single', 'star', 'holed', 'up', 'Maine', 'retreat', 'reeling', 'wife', 'adultery', 'cusp', 'brutal', 'divorce', 'battling', 'one', 'Grendel', 'writer', 'block.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'right', 'middle', 'nap', 'furious', 'stranger', 'broad-brimmed', 'hat', 'rap-rap-rapping', 'Chamber', 'Door', 'accusing', 'befuddled', 'novelist', 'stealing', 'story', 'Would', 'sit', 'shipwreck', 'snorefest', 'again', 'Quoth', 'John', 'Shooter', 'Nevermore', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'flick', 'had', 'promising', 'ingredients', 'spooky', 'little', 'potboiler', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'intimate', 'nasty', 'tale', 'obsession', 'madness', 'one', 'juiciest', 'King', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'can', 'charm', 'camera', 'quirky', 'frown', 'John', 'Turturro', 'equally', 'adept', 'eccentric', 'roles.Director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'stylish', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Fred', 'Murphy', 'obviously', 'how', 'wield', 'camera', 'turned', 'out', 'masterfully', 'moody', 'camera-work', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'Secret', 'Window', 'even', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'doing', 'stress-inducing', 'soundtrack.And', 'certainly', 'movie', 'right', 'note', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'hunched', 'driver', 'seat', 'car', 'toboggan', 'pulled', 'down', 'maniac', 'locks', 'scowling', 'face', 'a-twitch', 'snowstorm', 'howling', 'car', 'window.All', 'good', 'stuff', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'tantalizing', 'when', 'shift', 'forward', 'six', 'months', 'intro', 'wicked', 'little', 'revelation', 'now', ""'re"", 'holed', 'up', 'spooky', 'cabin', 'equally', 'spooky', 'lake', 'devoted', 'dog', 'tormented', 'writer', 'disintegrating', 'marriage', 'crazy', 'doorstep.What', 'not', 'love', 'Nearly', 'everything.If', 'synopsis', ""'ve"", 'given', 'sounds', 'intriguing', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'read', 'very', 'creepy', 'story', ""'re"", 'hardcore', 'Depp', 'fanatic', 'masochist', 'insomniac', ""'ll"", 'get', 'pleasure', 'one-way', 'ticket', 'Dullsville.Koepp', 'suspense', 'tension', 'momentum', 'scares', 'certainly', 'horror', 'Secret', 'Window', 'strictly', 'numbers', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'thing', 'felt', 'hands', 'project', '-with', 'exception', 'inventive', 'Depp', '-had', 'lost', 'interest.The', 'direction', 'dull', 'pace', 'plodding', 'camerawork', 'listless', 'strictly', 'point-and-shoot', 'worse', 'still', 'film', 'aimlessness', 'infect', 'actors.The', 'usually', 'interesting', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Teddy', 'mystifying', 'inclusion', 'merely', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'good', '-relatively', 'speaking', '-the', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Dark', 'Half', 'really', 'was.The', 'charismatic', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Ken', 'Karsch', 'wasted', 'role', 'big', 'bearish', 'overconfident', 'P.I', 'was', 'stale', 'back', 'Thinner', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'motions', 'check', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Amy', 'best', 'work', 'accompanied', 'side', 'order', 'corn', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Shooter', 'hat', 'do', 'acting.It', 'not', 'Secret', 'Window', 'howlingly', 'horrible', 'movie', '-if', 'Koepp', 'had', 'taken', 'chances', 'played', 'movie', 'let', 'Depp', 'natural', 'charisma', 'percolate', 'rest', 'mummified', 'corpse', 'movie', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'quirky', 'cult', 'appeal', 'hope', 'patient', 'alas', 'film', 'delivered', 'slab', 'smelling', 'formaldehyde', 'stinking', 'rot.That', 'said', 'very', 'least', 'Secret', 'Window', 'really', 'made', 'empathize', 'poor', 'crazy', 'old', 'John', 'Shooter', 'Shooter', 'claimed', 'Rainey', 'had', 'stolen', 'story', 'wanted', 'back', 'was', 'out', 'blood', 'Same', 'Secret', 'Window', 'stole', '90', 'minutes', 'want', 'back', ""'m"", 'out', 'blood.JSG']",N/A

No this movie (based on the King story) is classic in the sense that so many of the elements of this story have already appeared in other works from the horror maestro. Throughout the movie shades from both `The Shining' and `The Dark Half' abound and ultimately detract from the presentation with a distinct sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and `they did it better in...' pervading the movie.The story centers around a washed up writer Mort Rainey (played by Johnny Depp) consumed in alcohol and depression over a failed marriage and writers block who is shocked by the arrival of a stranger who accuses him of stealing his story (the `Secret Window' of the title). Things get worse for Mort as Shooter becomes increasingly violent and Rainey slips deeper into paranoia and insanity before a shocking climax. Depp does his best with the material he is given and this movie at times comes close to creating some real chilling scenes. John Turturro also turns in a memorable performance as John Shooter and Maria Bello elicits a great deal of sympathy as Morts (soon-to-be) ex-wife Amy, a character wracked with uncertainty about stepping out after the shelter of married life.Supporting performances by Timothy Hutton and Charles Dutton are both admirable, if both the characters they portray are slim on actual characterization and Len Cariou turns in a surprisingly good performance as Sheriff Newsome.Good for fans of the genre and people looking to be mildly entertained, just don't go in expecting to be particularly surprised by anything.",3,Formulaic but diverting suspense thriller,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,1712,"['Secret', 'Window', 'classic', 'Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'sense', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'immortalized', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'revered', 'movie', 'fans', 'pace', 'direction', 'No', 'movie', 'based', 'King', 'story', 'classic', 'sense', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'story', 'have', 'already', 'appeared', 'other', 'works', 'horror', 'maestro', 'movie', 'Shining', 'Dark', 'Half', 'abound', 'ultimately', 'detract', 'presentation', 'distinct', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'did', 'better', 'pervading', 'movie.The', 'story', 'centers', 'washed', 'up', 'writer', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'consumed', 'alcohol', 'depression', 'failed', 'marriage', 'writers', 'block', 'who', 'shocked', 'arrival', 'stranger', 'who', 'stealing', 'story', 'Secret', 'Window', 'title', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'Mort', 'Shooter', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'Rainey', 'deeper', 'paranoia', 'insanity', 'shocking', 'climax', 'Depp', 'best', 'material', 'given', 'movie', 'times', 'close', 'creating', 'real', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'John', 'Turturro', 'also', 'memorable', 'performance', 'John', 'Shooter', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'great', 'deal', 'sympathy', 'Morts', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-wife', 'Amy', 'character', 'wracked', 'uncertainty', 'stepping', 'out', 'shelter', 'married', 'life.Supporting', 'performances', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'are', 'admirable', 'characters', 'portray', 'are', 'slim', 'actual', 'characterization', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Sheriff', 'Newsome.Good', 'fans', 'genre', 'people', 'looking', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'be', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'anything']",N/A

All the brilliant physical brushstrokes, in combination with vivid colors and subtle imagery are present, but you wonder if there's more beneath the surface. Those were my exact thoughts while viewing ""Secret Window"". Upon further in(tro)spection, I noticed that all of the elements which were usually contained within many previously released feature-length horror films are also present here: including an intense plot featuring a main subject (a mystery writer played adaquately by Johnny Depp), a menacing, lurking antagonist (featuring a masterful portrayal by John Turturro), including various other supporting subjects (good turns all nicely done by Dennis Quaid, Maria Bello, Charles S. Dutton and Len Cariou). But, unlike the inquisitive early-period masters listed above, there's very little structural mind-stretching content to be found underneath the film's well-meaning premise. ""SW""'s storyline's lighweight script and often shallow character references suggest the overall theme doesn't want to dangle about merrilly, but just wants to lie still, taking an occasional coffee break in the process. The film's schizophrenic subject matter doesn't help matters much either, and by film's end, one is left to think while scratching his or her head: ""This is IT?!!?"", wondering if spending their hard-earned money on this very average at-best movie was actually worthy of any notable effort. As it turned out, Bubbie's assessment of ""Secret Window"" actually met my expectations, and was right on the money as a whole. For those expecting a Stephen King portrayal chock-full of intensity and all-out insanity, overall, there are a few brief, shining, over-the-top moments contained within, but, when all is said and done, one will consider ""Secret Window"" to be nothing of special importance or significance, for that matter. Also of note, I found out that Bubbie and I have very similar tastes in movies, as per the review display inside the establishment (example: ""50 First Dates"" was given a four out of four cone rating, ""Hidalgo"" a three out of four cones, etc.). However, I tended to disagree on his two cone rating of ""Spartan"", as the plot featured within that stellar motion picture contained more vim and bite than ""Secret Window"", which was given the exact same rating Bubbie had given ""Spartan"", as previously mentioned. Oh, well, we can't agree on everything, can we? I discovered the Bubster has excellent artistic taste in music as well, as Joni Mitchell's ""Court and Spark"" album was playing over the stereo when I convened upon his establishment two days earlier. How about some Neil Diamond the next time I come in to your fine establishment, Bubs? Maybe we can take in a movie over at the 8-plex while we're at it?

Depp agrees to show Shooter proof that he did not steal the story, while Shooter makes it clear that he intends to make Mort's life tough until he obtains the proof.This is just the beginning of the story, the window dressing.  What makes the film excellent is the acting.  Depp is wonderful again as a writer who is dealing with recent tragedy in his life.  Turturro is great as an almost over the top tough, Charles Dutton is a strong supporting friend/lawyer for Mort, and Timothy Hutton is menacing as the boyfriend of Mort's soon to be ex wife.The plot is complex and twists often, but never out of control.  All the time, Depp is great and he really shows his range.  This character requires him to be in control of himself, but just barely.  There is an edge required here based on the situations the character goes through.  Depp pulls it off beautifully.  By the time the credits roll, you will be impressed.

Conflicts rise, animals are killed, people get mangled with screw drivers while others get diced with axes. You get the picture if you have seen a few horror or thriller films. The movie though is more of a guessing game for the first hour or so but in the end lies a twist, dont get to excited because the twist is actually quite common in films nowadays ... but overall all very good acting makes veiwers to believe that the film is actaully better than it is. The story is based on a Stephen King novel. The screenplay is really not hat great same goes for the directing, but overall I found the film to be somewhat convincing and overall pretty good with the ending. Though the ending might be some what confusing, if you were paying attention than you should understand everything just fine. Johnny Depp gets right down within the ""Depp-th's"" of the film and is really convincing. John Turtorro's performance as the bad guy (John Shooter) is also really good.If you are looking for a good horror film than this is not for you, it's PG-13, very low on blood and not at all scary, BUT the film his more than it's share of sheer suspense and is a pretty good, involved thriller.Grade: B-",4,"His secret, hidden from himself...

I haven't read all of King's works -- evidently they constitite a small-town library -- but the ones I've read reveal a mild talent for the Gothic genre. (Interestingly, one of the best, ""Gerald's Game"", has not been filmed, perhaps because its claustrophobic variations on a theme would not appeal to adolescents.) ""Secret Window"" has Johnny Depp as a burned-out author going through an unusually recriminatory divorce. Depp, fresh from playing Captain Queen in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", goes in the opposite direction here: badly in need of strong coffee, hair a rat's nest, tattered bathrobe, thick eyeglasses clamped to his face. Depp takes chances, you gotta give him credit. His character has moved into an upstate New York country house, isolated and in more need of repairs than Depp himself. He's immediately confronted by a strange character out of ""Deliverance"" (John Turturro) accusing the author of plagiarism. Now, in real life, with today's high-tech communications, such a vague accusation could be resolved in hours. But this is not real life, it's Stephen King, so the situation drags on and on, becoming increasingly nasty. Director David Koepp works with the idea that if you're manipulative enough the audience will not notice the incompetence in the plot's construction. And the manipulation is shameless, not to mention predictable. Scene after sloppy scene is just too obvious to be scary. As for the ending: well, I'm not going to give away the secret of ""Secret Window"".

In fact, he is the only reason to see this movie.  This is by no means a bad film, but there's just nothing here that is in the least bit fresh or innovative.  Basically, ""Secret Window"" fails to have that ""special something"" that distinguishes it from the endless line of psychological thrillers Hollywood churns out.  In addition, most movie fans will be able to see the alleged ""twist ending"" coming from a mile away.  If you're looking for a real twist ending or a truly suspenseful thriller, try any of M. Night Shyamalan's three films, if you haven't already.  In the end, ""Secret Window"" was entertaining enough for me and, along with the help of Johnny's steady stream of dry cracks and humorous facial expressions, should keep most audiences interested.Johnny Depp is a true movie star.  He has such a presence onscreen, such an indescribable charm.  You can't help but sit in rapt attention as Johnny putters around his house for an hour with a perennial case of bed head.  His magnetic presence is reminiscent of that of Cary Grant's.  Though the men are obviously polar opposites, they both are hypnotizing onscreen.

He's that kind of actor that can make any movie worth watching. Such is the case with SECRET WINDOW, the latest adaptation of a Stephen King story (I really wish they would stop; only a handful of King movies were really good, anyway . . . . the rest were horrible). Johnny Depp's performance in this movie is absolute dynamite, and I think one of his best. It's even better than his fun-yet-vastly-overrated performance in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN (I mean, he was good, but he got his first Oscar nod for THAT?!) Depp creates a character in SECRET WINDOW that is truly memorable and realistic, capturing both the sorrow and humorous quirks that a reclusive writer probably would have.That said, aside from marvelling at Depp's seemingly endless acting abilities, there's not much to see here. The story is fairly interesting, and might even have been really good, if not for the ending. I mean, I saw this coming half-way through the movie, so I was hardly surprised at all. (Let's just say that anyone who has seen A BEAUTIFUL MIND will easily guess the ending.) I mean, at least they could have made it more scary! I slightly jumped twice, and that was it. Luckily, it's a short movie.Well, in any case, fans of Johnny Depp are definitely going to want to see this flick. After all, thanks to him, the story actually holds your attention.

I mean they followed the book so accurately except for a few switches like the location being New York instead of Maine, and the acting was superb, but why did I not like it? Maybe it could be the fact that I read the book then saw it, or the fact that I knew what was going to happen (which I didn't. The ending was changed too) or maybe it's just me, but it was good for a one time veiwing. It was good enough to follow the book but you'll understand if you see it. I still give it four stars.Mort Rainey (played by the fabulous Johnny Depp) is still wallowing in self-pity after the recent divorce of his wife Amy, after finding out she had had an affair. With his elderly dog Chico, the two are spending what seems a long time up at Morts getaway cabin. But things begin to go wrong once a strange redneck from Mississippi drives up and says to Mort, ""You stole my story"". After numerous tries to tell the Mr. ""John Shooter"" that the story he claims Mort stole was published two years before, all hell breaks loose as it is for sure Mr. Shooter isn't going to take this lying down. It's an authors worst nightmare come true.No way is the acting bad. It seems a little off, but it is still good especially by the impeccable Johnny Depp. The woman who played his wife did a very good job herself too, and of course the guy who played the infamous John Shooter was perfect for the part, you have to admit that. They got all the characters right which I was happy about.As for storywise, the ending was maybe even better than the books ending, I'm not really sure but I know it's only one of those movies that only good once and if you see it again, it's just not as good. Maybe it wasn't even good at all, I don't know. I'd give it three stars except for the fact that they followed alot of things super close to the book so you can't beat that.I'd recommend the book over the movie even though the movie had a lot of the good tension that crawls into your skin a lot of the time. The thing about the book is that you have to imagine it, and it's not being put upon a screen and being imagined for you. When you think about it though, sometimes things like this can happen. Maybe it's not all horror stories. Authors are put under a lot of stress, and you never know if Stephen King sometimes draws his stories from experience thus resulting in his short story Secret Window, Secret Garden. Oh well.

This is one of them and I'd have to give the praise mainly to choosing Johnny Depp to play the main character.Mort Rainey is a semi-famous writer who is going through a nasty divorce from his wife, who has another man in her life.  He retires to a cabin and starts work, only to be interrupted by a man named Shooter, who claims that Mort stole his story.  Mort is already on the edge due to his divorce and this sets him down the garden path of self-destruction.  He stumbles around the cabin in a ratty old bathrobe and with messed up hair half the time (a real plus if you enjoy seeing Johnny Depp looking like he just woke up in the morning after a hard night out) and can't seem to prove to the man that he wrote the story first and can't seem to deal with his wife leaving him for someone else.If just about anyone else had been playing the part of Mort, you would have had much less sympathy for his character...especially near the end of the movie.  As it was, the final scenes created odd feelings in the audience.  I won't give it away, but this dissonance was fascinating since the movie basically gave you everything from Mort's perspective and made you feel what he felt, even if you knew it was wrong.Writers might find this movie even more interesting.  Johnny Depp fans will like, especially since he's in just about scene and does a great understated job of bringing the miserable life of Mort Rainey to reality.  It's not Johnny's best movie by any means, but its oddly and secretly fascinating all the same.",4,Saved by Johnny Depp,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1721,"['First', ""'ve"", 'read', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'opinion', 'Not', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'end', 'up', 'better', 'okay', 'movies', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'do', 'one', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', 'praise', 'mainly', 'choosing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'play', 'main', 'character.Mort', 'Rainey', 'semi-famous', 'writer', 'who', 'going', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'wife', 'who', 'man', 'life', 'cabin', 'work', 'only', 'be', 'interrupted', 'man', 'named', 'Shooter', 'who', 'Mort', 'stole', 'story', 'Mort', 'already', 'edge', 'due', 'divorce', 'down', 'garden', 'path', 'self-destruction', 'cabin', 'ratty', 'old', 'bathrobe', 'messed', 'up', 'hair', 'time', 'real', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'looking', 'just', 'woke', 'up', 'morning', 'hard', 'night', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'prove', 'man', 'wrote', 'story', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deal', 'wife', 'leaving', 'someone', 'else.If', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'part', 'Mort', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'less', 'sympathy', 'character', 'especially', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'final', 'scenes', 'created', 'odd', 'feelings', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'dissonance', 'was', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'basically', 'gave', 'everything', 'Mort', 'perspective', 'made', 'feel', 'what', 'felt', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong.Writers', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'especially', 'just', 'scene', 'great', 'understated', 'job', 'bringing', 'miserable', 'life', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'reality', 'not', 'Johnny', 'best', 'movie', 'means', 'oddly', 'secretly', 'fascinating', 'same']",N/A

While I have nothing against Depp, and actually think he's pretty good value, his emotional range is fairly limited. He does quirky very well, and funny also pretty well. And that's about it. I can't remember the last role he played where he was forced to connect emotionally with another character - he almost invariably plays the loner. I'm quite prepared to be proved wrong about this, as I'm by no means a Depp afficionado. But the films I have seen him in - Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Pirates of the Caribbean, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Blow - pretty much all fit into this category.Having said that, Secret Window does not provide Depp with much of a chance to show his range, as it is about as subtle and enlightening as something neither subtle nor enlightening. Depp plays Mort Rainey, a successful author who has holed up in a cabin in the sleepy town of Tachmore Lake after a bitter separation and ongoing divorce from his wife Amy (played by Maria Bello). One morning he is confronted by a sinister redneck, John Shooter (John Turturro), who accuses Rainey of stealing his story and publishing it under another name - the ""Secret Window"" of the film's title. Rainey attempts to prove that this allegation is untrue, but predictably finds himself unable to do so, as things start to go disastrously wrong. Turturro's performance exudes malice, while Bello is fine as the emotionally confused ex-wife. Depp though, seems miscast. He portrays surface panic adequately, but genuine fear and paranoia are beyond him. However, I'm not sure any lead actor cast in this role could save what is a cliched and obvious thriller that provides very few thrills.

The movie for one is a really good movie with lots of twists, frights, and comic moments. The movie is about writer Mort Rainey, portrayed by Johnny Depp very well, who is living a calm life with his small dog on the outscurts of a small town. His ex wife lives in his real house in the city but they still haven't filed papers for the divorce. Mort is still haunted by peeping in on her and seeing her in bed with an other man. She claims she didn't cheat on him but he thinks otherwise.... Well anyway, everything's going fine for him until John Shooter comes to his house. This man's from Mississipi and is brilliantly portrayed by John Turturro. This small writer claims that Mort has stolen his story who denies it but when Shooter leaves a copy of his story, Mort realizes that they are identical. And then Shooter goes absolutely crazy and things start happening. Bad things. For one, don't get attached to the dog like I did. But, this horror movie with some very comic moments is one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years. Turturro's performance will always be remembered by me as one of the best EVER. You should see it just for that and for his awesome performance. His performance is even better than it was in the Birdcage, which was also great.

Right now, Depp has a monopoly on the male heartthrob market not seen since four Liverpool gents first toured the States. I don't know what it is about Se&ntilde;or Depp, but I do know what I saw.After purchasing my ticket for ""Secret Window,"" I was spellbound to see almost a 3-to-1 female-to-male ratio in attendance. Anyone who has seen the trailer for ""Secret Window"" could tell you this film doesn't exactly belong in the chick-flick category.Jeepers, and I thought Marlon Brando still grasped the flame of desire in the hearts of women at home and abroad. I mean, sure, the innovator of method acting has plumped a little around the midsection since his ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" days, but c'mon.With that aside, ""Secret Window"" tells the story of Mort Rainey (Depp), a recently divorced writer who simply cannot shake the mental image of his former wife (Maria Bello) sleeping in bed with another man (Timothy Hutton). He caught the two red-handed at a seedy motel while he and his wife were still married.At any rate, a Mississippi man, John Shooter, pays the beleaguered Rainey a visit. Shooter insists Rainey robbed him of one of his stories.John Turturro plays the enigmatic Shooter to perfection. In truth, Turturro is a much under-appreciated actor. Whether the part calls for a bug-eyed Hollywood screenwriter in ""Barton Fink,"" or a smug beneficiary to his father's pizza shop in ""Do the Right Thing,"" Turturro consistently delivers.On the second visit by this un-stately stranger with a fully brimmed black cap, Rainey inquires as to when Shooter typed up his identical story. Shooter, without hesitation, says 1997. Rainey seemingly puts an end to the argument when he claims that he, in fact, wrote the story in fall of 1994 and had it published in a magazine in early 1995. ""Not so easy,"" says Shooter in a starkly Southern drawl. ""I wanna see this magazine, if it does exist.""Meanwhile, as Rainey desperately tries to get a copy of the publication, strange things begin to happen. He discovers his dog dead with a screwdriver through its skull. Then he and his ex-wife's house burns to the ground as the target of arson.Here is where I will halt my procession. All I can tell the reader is nothing in this film is what it seems. Personally, I made the mistake of assuming too much.

What if a story were to become true ? Generally the end would have to be changed to make ot more palatable for real life, that is to say more feasible. This shift from imagination to reality is entirely natural for a writer of any kind. The film insists, maybe too much, on the collateral elements of this process : alcohol, tobacco, isolatiion, a divorce or separation, the jealousy that goes along with it, etc. It does not show how the writing process itself produces this attitude. In this case we do not know for sure where the sane and calculating man is and where the limit between the writer and this calculating man is. He definitely is psychotic and cannot accept the world the way it is, so he tries to impose his vision. Are all writers psychotic ? Maybe, except if they are shizophrenic. The film is very good in many ways because we cannot see that limit and it tricks us into believing the unbelieavable, and that is frightening because it reveals something about us : we are all the victims of delusions and of the intrusion of the mental world into the real world, and the real world can trigger the mental world and even trap it into some kind of blind alley where we cannot see anything but our delusion that surges from this real world we do not see any more. It would have been better if the details had been more accurate, if any detail had been effectively connected to the sequence of events. There are too many gratuitous details that cannot be explained. It is amazing that the local police in up-state New York does not call the FBI in after the disappearance of four people connected to a divorce case, which should have made them very suspicious. As for that The Dark Half was a lot more effective, in a completely different line about another author and his imagination. In other words we do not reach the level when our believing can be carried away and captured. We are forced to enjoy the movie instead of getting intellectually trapped into a complete network of facts that cannot fail to enmesh us in a dominating belief in the truth of the story.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,You body-double is inside your mind,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2198,"['One', 'more', 'film', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'One', 'more', 'story', 'writing', 'process', 'writer', 'What', 'story', 'were', 'become', 'true', 'Generally', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'changed', 'make', 'ot', 'more', 'palatable', 'real', 'life', 'say', 'more', 'feasible', 'shift', 'imagination', 'reality', 'entirely', 'natural', 'writer', 'kind', 'film', 'insists', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'collateral', 'elements', 'process', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'isolatiion', 'divorce', 'separation', 'jealousy', 'along', 'etc', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'writing', 'process', 'attitude', 'case', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'sure', 'where', 'sane', 'calculating', 'man', 'where', 'limit', 'writer', 'calculating', 'man', 'definitely', 'psychotic', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'world', 'way', 'so', 'impose', 'vision', 'Are', 'writers', 'psychotic', 'Maybe', 'are', 'shizophrenic', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'limit', 'believing', 'unbelieavable', 'frightening', 'something', 'are', 'victims', 'delusions', 'intrusion', 'mental', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'trigger', 'mental', 'world', 'even', 'trap', 'kind', 'blind', 'alley', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'delusion', 'real', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'details', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'accurate', 'detail', 'had', 'been', 'effectively', 'connected', 'sequence', 'events', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'gratuitous', 'details', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'amazing', 'local', 'police', 'up-state', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'call', 'FBI', 'disappearance', 'four', 'people', 'connected', 'divorce', 'case', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'suspicious', 'Dark', 'Half', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'effective', 'completely', 'different', 'line', 'author', 'imagination', 'other', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'reach', 'level', 'when', 'believing', 'can', 'be', 'carried', 'away', 'captured', 'are', 'forced', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'instead', 'getting', 'intellectually', 'trapped', 'complete', 'network', 'facts', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'enmesh', 'dominating', 'belief', 'truth', 'story.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Mort (Johnny Depp) is a man who lives in a cabin outside of New York, newly seperated from his wife of 10 years. He is confronted by a man who claims that he plagerized his story. Mort tries to prove that it was his story, and not copied from this man named Shooter. A number of bizarre happenings begin to occur. And let's just say, there is a Stephen King twist in there.

Tepid directing, few pop-up thrills to even justify it being a thriller.2.) Obvious, obvious twist. And also nonsensical, as the whole premise of the plagiarism in relation to the &quot;Secret Window&quot; story is rendered irrelevant.3.) One grotesque and infuriatingly violent act performed on an adorable and very hugable doggie. Not shown, but the aftermath is enough. If you're a dog lover, you will be ticked off at this movie.4.) Didn't we see this story before in numerous other Stephen King novels and adaptations(ie, the Shining?) There is one scene towards the end that is a direct rip off of a famous scene in the Shining that was parodied in a famous scene in a Simpsons Halloween special.5.)

King IS one of the most creative forces in the world of literature the world has ever known.  Some of his works are pure genius...others...pure drivel.  As 'Secret Window' began, I became quite convinced this was going to be a real treat.  Well filmed.  Suspenseful.  Well acted.  Unfortunately as the movie continued on, and the REAL reason for our main character (played wonderfully by Depp) and his problems with a redneck psychopath who is convinced his story was stolen become apparent, well I began to have flashbacks of the Lord of the Rings.You may wonder just how in the world I can compare these two movies, huh?  Well its quite simple, actually.  Remember Gollum and his strange split-personality and how he would sometimes talk to himself and work to convince himself that the One Ring was HIS?  The portion of 'Secret Window' where Johnny Depp does the same thing kinda weirded me out, and I have to admit, made me think of Gollum right off the bat (and not just me either, my son said the same thing).  Despite this small similarity, at the point where Depp begins to interrogate himself, the entire feel of the film began to seriously deteriorate.  What WAS a fairly decent suspenseful movie suddenly became a parody of itself and almost crashes and burns.  I found the last scene to be really, really odd.  Sure, I got the whole sinister joke of it, I just found it to be very UN-funny.  Not in poor taste, just not funny.  I also found what many people thought was a very clever plot to be quite the opposite, actually.  All I can say is this: the first part of the movie was very well done.

It's the kind of movie you figure out early and then you wait for the twist that is going to make it all up to you, but no such twist ever comes.

821010,A1TS8A5XM54QDB,B0002234LS,"J. J. Sargent ""jesteratsnetnet""","[1, 2]","While I'm glad I was able to catch the film, I was quite annoyed by the experience of seeing it at the Mall (big surprise). Of the twenty or so other people in the theater for the Saturday night late show, 16 of them were teenyboppers. It might as well have been a packed house, though, with all of the distractions. There were conversations galore (why do people have to carry on melodramatic conversations about dumb high-school romances and bad hair DURING a movie?), and no less than FOUR times did LOUD cell phones ring (different cell phones from different people with different ring tones -- ""Ride of the Valkries"" was only one of them)!!!Still, I enjoyed the flick. It was interesting (though somewhat predictable), and Johnny Depp was a joy to watch, as usual. He looked like he was having fun with the role, and that made it a bit better than it probably would have been. The film was less graphic in the violence than I expected. While it hints at the violence, it doesn't actually show a lot of it -- just bits and pieces. There's some gore, but it's not over-the-top.Of course the film is like a regurgitated The Dark Half. I've never read the original short story here, so I'm not sure how similar the film is to the actual story, but I found it odd that Stephen King would revisit the same territory so obviously similarly. Interestingly, Timothy Hutton was cast in a somewhat major supporting role in Secret Window, and he was the main character in The Dark Half, Thad Beaumont/George Stark.I think, perhaps, the film bordered on boredom (say that three times fast). Depp gave it a little comic relief (i.e. his disheveled appearance, quirky mannerisms, and wild looks every time he catches himself doing something odd) made the character less caricature and more realistic than he probably would have been in the hands of a less-accomplished actor. Depp took a one-dimensional character and blew it full of air (sometimes hot air, but air nonetheless), and he managed to make something interesting out of it.One the other hand, while John Turturo as the mysterious ""Shooter"" was equally interesting, he was less believable and not as threatening as he probably should have been. His quirky demeanor was at times creepy, but he lacked any semblance of villainy and therefore seemed far less menacing than King's similar haunted writer/doppleganger, George Stark. Hence, it seemed as though the film was holding back. It's not in-your-face spooky and it's the subject matter is not sufficiently explored toward it's most disturbing end. Instead, the movie plays a bit like a cross between a made-for-tv USA thriller and an episode of Tales from the Crypt. It's fun to watch, mostly because of Depp, but it's got about as much meat on its bones as exists in a boiling pot of corn on the cob.Gone are the classic King films like Pet Cemetary, Cujo, The Dead Zone, Salem's Lot, Children of the Corn, The Shining, etc... Instead, we're left with shaky and wobbling attempts at thought-provoking cinema from King like the more recent cinematic flop Dreamcatcher, the television monstrosity Rose Red and other mixed-bags of bones like The Langoliers. It seems King's best film adaptations in a long time rest with The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, but perhaps it's fair to say that the strength of those films, like this one, lie less in the script and more in the exceptional thespians who bring the characters to life.I find it difficult to blame King for the film's weaknesses however. I wasn't impressed by David Koepp's screenplay nor his direction. I thought it lacked the umpff of some of his earlier work vis-a-vis Stir of Echoes and The Trigger Effect (both of which he also wrote and directed). Instead, this film was about as exciting and predictable as his Panic Room (which he wrote) -- in other words, it was at times quite flat.I give it two stars. It's good for a matinee or a short wait for the dvd.",2,About as much meat as a boiling pot of corn on the cob...,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,3930,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'annoyed', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Mall', 'big', 'surprise', 'twenty', 'so', 'other', 'people', 'theater', 'Saturday', 'night', 'late', 'show', '16', 'were', 'teenyboppers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'packed', 'house', 'distractions', 'were', 'conversations', 'galore', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'have', 'carry', 'melodramatic', 'conversations', 'dumb', 'high-school', 'romances', 'bad', 'hair', 'movie', 'less', 'FOUR', 'did', 'LOUD', 'cell', 'phones', 'ring', 'different', 'cell', 'phones', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'ring', 'tones', 'Ride', 'Valkries', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'was', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'usual', 'looked', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'role', 'made', 'bit', 'better', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'graphic', 'violence', 'expected', 'violence', ""n't"", 'actually', 'show', 'lot', 'just', 'bits', 'pieces', 'gore', 'not', 'over-the-top.Of', 'course', 'film', 'regurgitated', 'Dark', 'Half', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'similar', 'film', 'actual', 'story', 'found', 'Stephen', 'King', 'would', 'revisit', 'same', 'territory', 'so', 'obviously', 'similarly', 'Interestingly', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'was', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'major', 'supporting', 'role', 'Secret', 'Window', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'Dark', 'Half', 'Thad', 'Beaumont/George', 'Stark.I', 'think', 'perhaps', 'film', 'bordered', 'boredom', 'say', 'three', 'times', 'fast', 'Depp', 'gave', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'i.e', 'disheveled', 'appearance', 'quirky', 'mannerisms', 'wild', 'looks', 'time', 'doing', 'something', 'odd', 'made', 'character', 'caricature', 'more', 'realistic', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hands', 'less-accomplished', 'actor', 'Depp', 'took', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'blew', 'full', 'air', 'sometimes', 'hot', 'air', 'air', 'nonetheless', 'managed', 'make', 'something', 'interesting', 'it.One', 'other', 'hand', 'John', 'Turturo', 'mysterious', 'Shooter', 'was', 'equally', 'interesting', 'was', 'less', 'believable', 'not', 'as', 'threatening', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'quirky', 'demeanor', 'was', 'times', 'creepy', 'lacked', 'semblance', 'villainy', 'therefore', 'seemed', 'far', 'less', 'menacing', 'King', 'similar', 'haunted', 'writer/doppleganger', 'George', 'Stark', 'Hence', 'seemed', 'film', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'spooky', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'explored', 'most', 'disturbing', 'end', 'Instead', 'movie', 'bit', 'cross', 'made-for-tv', 'USA', 'thriller', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'fun', 'watch', 'mostly', 'Depp', 'got', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'meat', 'bones', 'exists', 'boiling', 'pot', 'corn', 'cob.Gone', 'are', 'classic', 'King', 'films', 'Pet', 'Cemetary', 'Cujo', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Shining', 'etc', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', 'shaky', 'wobbling', 'attempts', 'thought-provoking', 'cinema', 'King', 'more', 'recent', 'cinematic', 'flop', 'Dreamcatcher', 'television', 'monstrosity', 'Rose', 'Red', 'other', 'mixed-bags', 'bones', 'Langoliers', 'King', 'best', 'film', 'adaptations', 'long', 'time', 'rest', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'perhaps', 'fair', 'say', 'strength', 'films', 'one', 'less', 'script', 'more', 'exceptional', 'thespians', 'who', 'bring', 'characters', 'life.I', 'find', 'difficult', 'blame', 'King', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'David', 'Koepp', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'thought', 'lacked', 'umpff', 'earlier', 'work', 'vis-a-vis', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Trigger', 'Effect', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Instead', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'exciting', 'predictable', 'Panic', 'Room', 'wrote', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'times', 'quite', 'flat.I', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'good', 'matinee', 'short', 'wait', 'dvd']",N/A

This movie has more of a comedy element thanks to Johnny Depp's little quirks than it does a suspense element. Also, the characters don't seem very developed. They all seem to have dry, dull personalities. The only character in the movie whose personality isn't typical for the kind of person he plays is Johnny Depp. Other than that, you've got the hot-headed boyfriend who feels like Johnny Depp's being too surly about his and Johnny's (soon to be) ex-wife's affair, you have the adultering wife of Johnny Depp who calls him every now and then and tries to make friendly conversation with him, and you've got the detective who doesn't speak more than 7 or 8 sentences per dialogue.

821019,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0002234LS,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 1]","Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.)Depp's performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depp's, cuckolding, bitchy, soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.This is a Stephen King adaption about a writer going over the edge. (If you saw The Dark Half which also starred Timothy Hutton this will definitely feel like familiar ground). The plot is a familiar train wreck. Depp is a writer going through a nasty divorce and suffering from writers block. There is a knock at the door and Turturro is at the door. With a southern drawl and an Amish tailor Turturro claims that Depp stole his story and has to make it right.Ah plagiarism, that old plot twist standby which many a great horror novel is based on. (Or maybe not). Turtorro's character quickly becomes a nasty bit of work as he kills Depp's beloved dog with a screwdriver. (This isn't really a plot spoiler. This is a Steven King adaptation, there are no kids in it to kill and the beloved dog might as well have been dressed in a metaphorical red shirt from the first scene.)This is where the movie officially lost me. Turturro is about as threatening as a Joe Pesci romantic comedy and if his character (named Shooter) killed one of my family members the next time he entered my property he would be renamed shot.But the movie cannot let Depp kill Shooter... cause of a super secret plot twist so lame and so obvious that it's no wonder plagiarism was at the forefront of the writer's mind. To add insult to injury the movie actually feels it needs to drop hints at this shocking plot twist apparently under the assumption a portion of the audience sniffs glue for a living and didn't figure it out within 10 minutes of the opening credits.The only real surprise in the entire film is the strange Children of the Corn references (Turtorro's character seems to be clearly channeling Malachi and the last scene is torn right from that mid-eighties classic.)Perhaps the film is meant to be homage to the fine Children of the Corn series... No greater faint praise could I imagine damning with.",3,Secret Window...

He knows what is truly scary: gutter-dwelling clowns, children, zombie pets, and menacing machines.  Unfortunately, when King's stories make the leap from the page to the screen, they often lose their psychological suspense.  Perhaps it's because the tension of King's stories come from what takes place within the protagonist's mind rather than external forces.Another difficulty is that King can write amazingly tense stories with endings that go flat.  For example, IT was truly scary...creepy clowns...scary sounds coming from the sewer...but it turns out to be a giant spider?  Not so scary.""Secret Window"" is another attempt to bring one of King's novellas to the screen, but it falls flat because it lacks suspense and has a poor ending you can see from a mile away.

821024,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0002234LS,Kaya Savas,"[6, 16]","STORY: I'm starting to think that Stephen King's only motivation for writing now days is so he can cash in on the movie adaptions of his work. The past few movies based on his works have been duds, including this one. Honestly, the only good Stephen King movie was The Shining. In this movie Johnny Depp plays a writer who is having trouble starting his new work of fiction, and to add into the mix he is going through a divorce, which is only there in the plot so the ending can be what it is. One day a tall southern man dressed in black comes by and accuses Mort (Depp) for plagerizing a story of his. The man's name is John Shooter. As the story progresses things start to become more serious with Shooter, and basically that's it for the story until the mildly shocking end. I was mad when I saw the ending (people who know the plot of my script will know why), but don't get me wrong it's a good ending it's just that I thought of it first (Okay, fine, maybe King did publish it before I wrote it down last year). Anyway, the only problem with the ending is that the ""idea"" is good except the effect is a stinker. The audience will ask at the end of the movie ""Okay, now what? Why did I sit through this entire thing?"" There is no reason behind the motive, there is really no message to the movie, and usually psychological thrillers have those. This comes across as a thriller without a brain, no smarts included. The movie also contains no jump out of your seat moments, it does however have two or three scenes that will get the heart pumping a bit, but no jumps. Overall a bad movie with a good out of place ending that leaves the audience saying ""So What?!""ACTING: This is a one man show here. Like Colin Ferrel in Phone Booth. Without Johnny Depp this movie would be a crapstaviganza.  The only thing is that Depp's approach to the role gives some comedic moments to the film, and at some points that changes the tone of the movie, which in the end does not make the story run smoothly. I know why they did it though, because without Depp's comedic charisma this movie would be extremely borring, EXTREMELY!BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a stinker, no doubt about it. The name Stephen King used to hold attention at the movies with such classics as The Shining and Pet Cemetery. Now we have Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on TV and Secret Window in the movies. Icky Poo! The ending is good but can be seen a mile away and is very out of place in a movie like this, David Koepp who penned the screenplay did not do a very good job of building a ""shocker"".

This is however, one of the better adaptations of a King novel.  Nonetheless, it is not unique in its presentation as it carries much similarity with films such as Brian de Palma's Raising Cain (1992) and the more recent Identity (2003).The second opening of the film has suggestive undercurrents to the theme of the film, as it cues the audience into the story.  The audience follows the camera lens in over a lake as it depicts a small rural house toward which the audience smoothly moves.  The audience moves in closer toward the house and in through a window as it finally faces a mirror through which the audience can see the main character sleeping on a coach.  The person sleeping is Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), a successful writer who has escaped his wife and divorce after having discovered her cheating on him six months ago in a local motel.When Mort wakes up from one of his afternoon naps a southern man by the name of John Shooter (John Turturro), demands justice as he insinuates that Mort has stolen his story.  Shooter gives Mort three days to rectify what he has done wrong, as he demands justice.  On the second day, Shooter kills Mort's dog.  Mort contacts the police, but the local police do not seem interested in his case, and in turn, he seeks help from a private agency that he has used in the past.  Nevertheless, the help Mort hired seems to be incapable to providing the help that he requested, as Shooter threatens him once more, this time inside his house, while the deadline draws nearer.David Koepp who wrote the screenplay for Spider-Man (2002) directs Secret Window, which brings a similar suspense that can be experienced in his other film Stir of Echoes (1999).  Johnny Depp as well as John Turturro enhance the cinematic experience through their great performances, as a well performing cast supports their parts.  As the end credit roll before the eyes of the audience they will have experienced a well-made film with the lesson of not trusting what one sees.",3,Plagiarism with a Deadly Deadline - Good Film Experience,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,2063,"['Secret', 'Window', 'horror', 'tale', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'however', 'one', 'better', 'adaptations', 'King', 'novel', 'Nonetheless', 'not', 'unique', 'presentation', 'much', 'similarity', 'films', 'such', 'Brian', 'Palma', 'Raising', 'Cain', '1992', 'more', 'recent', 'Identity', '2003', '.The', 'second', 'opening', 'film', 'suggestive', 'undercurrents', 'theme', 'film', 'audience', 'story', 'audience', 'camera', 'lake', 'small', 'rural', 'house', 'audience', 'smoothly', 'moves', 'audience', 'moves', 'closer', 'house', 'window', 'finally', 'mirror', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'sleeping', 'coach', 'person', 'sleeping', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'escaped', 'wife', 'divorce', 'having', 'discovered', 'cheating', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'local', 'motel.When', 'Mort', 'up', 'one', 'afternoon', 'southern', 'man', 'name', 'John', 'Shooter', 'John', 'Turturro', 'justice', 'Mort', 'stolen', 'story', 'Shooter', 'Mort', 'three', 'days', 'rectify', 'what', 'done', 'wrong', 'justice', 'second', 'day', 'Shooter', 'Mort', 'dog', 'Mort', 'police', 'local', 'police', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'interested', 'case', 'turn', 'help', 'private', 'agency', 'used', 'past', 'Nevertheless', 'help', 'Mort', 'hired', 'be', 'incapable', 'providing', 'help', 'requested', 'Shooter', 'once', 'more', 'time', 'house', 'deadline', 'nearer.David', 'Koepp', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Spider-Man', '2002', 'Secret', 'Window', 'similar', 'suspense', 'can', 'be', 'experienced', 'other', 'film', 'Stir', 'Echoes', '1999', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Turturro', 'enhance', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'great', 'performances', 'well', 'performing', 'cast', 'supports', 'parts', 'end', 'credit', 'roll', 'eyes', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'experienced', 'well-made', 'film', 'lesson', 'not', 'trusting', 'what', 'one']",N/A

Thats not to say that the other actors are bad, they are all good, no one stands out as a total [...] job that says he/she is only in it for the money.  A few points on the movie:First of all this is a horror movie and I was surprised that I was on the edge of my seat.  This is why I contend that PG-13 movies can be just as scary as R rated movies.  The atmosphere is great and I was, like I said, on the edge of my seat.  The biggest thing that helps this movie is the Unknown.  Most R rated movies show you the monster/pysho/math teacher/maniac and take away the element of the unknown(Of course I'm not saying that R rated Horror movies are not scary, I'm just saying that PG-13 movies can be scary too).  In this movie you know the villain is [...] character but you still feel like there is more to it than that and of course there is.Secondly, this movie also has some good parts in the middle of it.  With a lot of these movies with a big twist at the end the middle can get boring and pointless because the ending is really all that matters.  But Johnny Depp once again comes to the rescue and gives us some good humour which adds to rewatchability.And finally the ending is, in my opinion, great.  I loved the direction, I loved the acting, yea the story did get a bit uninvolving, but this is still a very good movie which all should see....",4,"""I'm Sure Eventually that her Death will become a Mystery even to me""",1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,1467,"['Hey', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'can', 'act', 'basically', 'movie', 'back', 'promised', 'land', '4/5', 'star', 'movies', 'not', 'say', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'out', 'total', '[', ']', 'job', 'he/she', 'only', 'money', 'A', 'few', 'points', 'movie', 'First', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'why', 'contend', 'PG-13', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'scary', 'R', 'rated', 'movies', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'was', 'said', 'edge', 'seat', 'biggest', 'thing', 'movie', 'Unknown', 'Most', 'R', 'rated', 'movies', 'show', 'monster/pysho/math', 'teacher/maniac', 'take', 'away', 'element', 'unknown', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'R', 'rated', 'Horror', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'scary', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'PG-13', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'too', 'movie', 'know', 'villain', '[', ']', 'character', 'still', 'feel', 'more', 'course', 'is.Secondly', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'parts', 'middle', 'lot', 'movies', 'big', 'twist', 'end', 'middle', 'can', 'get', 'boring', 'pointless', 'ending', 'really', 'matters', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'once', 'again', 'rescue', 'good', 'humour', 'rewatchability.And', 'finally', 'ending', 'opinion', 'great', 'loved', 'direction', 'loved', 'acting', 'yea', 'story', 'did', 'get', 'bit', 'uninvolving', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'see']",N/A

Bernabo,"[31, 35]","I know that I read &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden,&quot; the Stephen King novella that was the basis for David Koepp's 2004 film, but I had no conscious memory of the story when I sat down to watch the movie.  But either I remembered something deep down inside or it was a mistake to cast Timothy Hutton, who starred in movie version of King's &quot;The Dark Half,&quot; in a supporting role in this film because I quickly got to the point where I was wondering if I was reading the film wrong simply because it seemed so obvious to me what was going on.The main attraction here is Johnny Depp, because he is one actor who can be counted on never to do anything boring and whose flair for eccentricity and his devotion to odd roles is now being taken as a sign of genius.  Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer who is out in the woods in a cabin, starring at a poorly written opening paragraph that is not getting any better.  It soon becomes clear that his writer's block is the result of the fact he is in divorcing proceedings with his wife, Amy (Maria Bello); the opening scene of the film shows us the heart of that trauma.  Struggling to deal with these twin demons Rainey is confronted by the sudden appearance of John Shooter (John Turturro), a forbidding looking figure who accuses the writer of plagiarizing a story and demands he put things to rights.Mort is conflicted about his marriage and has no idea what to do with the blank sheet of paper in his typewriter.  He wants to be definite about having written the story &quot;Secret Window,&quot; but apparently in his deep dark past he plagiarized a story once and given the state he was in when he wrote the story, there just might be something about Shooter's claim.  Clearly Mort is at a crossroads where his future could well be in peril (Come on, this is a Stephen King story; this guy is toast).Depp's performance is captivating.  It has to be, because he has a lot of scenes where it is just him and his blind dog or the mirror on the wall.  But do not neglect the work of screenwriter-director Koepp (&quot;Panic Room&quot;), which you are not really going to be able to appreciate until the second time you watch &quot;Secret Window&quot; (in between watch the featurettes where the director give some key insights into what he was trying to do with the film).

Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors next to Tom Hanks and John Travolta, and this movie did not really get any real reviews except for the fact that it was from the interesting mind of Stephen King.  Johnny Depp is a schizophrenic who is traumatized after finding his wife with another man after she told him that she would never be with anyone else but him.  Johnny Depp (Morton Rainy) wrote a short story called ""Secret Window"" and it was about a guy named Todd Downey who had a wife that was obsessed with a garden she found through a hidden window behind a dresser in their new cabin.  He decides that he was going to kill her and bury her in the garden that she loved more than him.  Mort Rainy starts making up these characters in the movie, like John Shooter who, throughout the movie, accuses Mort of stealing his story.  In the end, Shooter and his inner-self get the best of him and he loses his mind as it was really him who commits these disturbing acts throughout the movie.  Depp ends up killing his wife (Shooter wants him to rewrite the ending he wrecked) and bury's her in the corn garden that he has in the back of his cabin.  Overall, I would give this movie 3 stars if I rated it in the box office.  It was a fresh start after Pirates Of The Carribean to see him with a layed back role as a depressed writer.

Then take John Turturro, one of the best actors in Hollywood today.  Put them together in story adapted from a Stephen King novella.  Have the screenplay written and directed by David Koepp of Spider Man and Panic Room fame.  Have a big budget and shoot the exteriors in Canada and the interiors on a set in Los Angeles.  If you like scary movies, this is a winning combination.Johnny Depp is cast as a writer who is living in what he refers to as a cabin but is, in reality, what many people would consider an ideal rustic vacation home.  It has a secret window which looks out over a garden - hence the title.  He's an unhappy man because he's going through a messy divorce.  He sleeps most of the day and finds it difficult to write.  All of the sudden the doorbell rings.  Standing there is John Turturro, dressed in a black suit with a large brimmed black hat.  In a deep southern accent Turtorro accuses Depp of stealing his story. He even leaves his manuscript, which Depp soon realizes is the exact same story that he published several years before.  Turtorro starts to menace Depp.  It's all very frightening, especially since the atmosphere of the story is planned to have the utmost of tension.As the story unfolded I was completely drawn in, but a small part of me was impatient with the outcome.  Knowing this was originally written by Stephen King gave me a hint of the ending.  The plot thickens as the wife, played by Maria Bello and her boyfriend, played by Timothy Hutton, enter the story.  There's one scary moment after the other with no explanation.  There are several acts of violence, which intensify as the story progresses.  But by the ending, however, I wasn't surprised.  It's not a pleasant ending and left me with a rather hollow feeling.This certainly isn't a ""feel good"" movie and, even though the conclusion is satisfactory, it wasn't a conclusion I wanted.

But with a cast featuring Johnny Depp, John Tuturro and Charles Dutton, I thought this movie would be worth the effort. And it is, as far as the acting concerned, but the acting seriously outweighs the quality of the screenplay, which begins promisingly enough, but fails to deliver much in the way of ongoing suspense. However, there is an uneven tension that recurs in various scenes.Nevertheless, Johnny Depp comes through on screen, as the confused writer suddenly accosted on his front porch by a menacing John Shooter (Tuturro), who claims: ""You stole my story."" Shooter gives Mort Rainey (Depp) a time limit to prove him wrong, before taking action for the injustice. That he does, with a vengeance and when playing menacing, Tuturro is the man. As the story unfolds and the writer drifts in and out of an alcoholic haze, a picture emerges of his broken marriage, unfaithful wife, Maria Bello, and her lover, Timothy Hutton. Mort Rainey slowly unravels as Shooter's deadline approaches, his actions ever more chaotic as bodies mount up around him, proof of authorship slipping through his fingers to the ultimate denouement.As Mort Rainey, Depp captures the screen with his quirky take on the befuddled writer and Tuturro's role is all to brief as the threatening John Shooter. Charles Dutton plays a short but memorable role as a private security guard hired by Rainey and Maria Bello is believable as the faithless wife. Timothy Hutton seems particularly uncomfortable in his role as Bello's lover, anxious to take over Depp's place in her life, but without much depth or interest. In all, Secret Garden is worth watching for those moments of interaction between Depp and Tuturro, not to mention Depp's ongoing dialog with himself, as his character comes to terms with his own subconscious frustration and anger about his broken marriage.

Just the number of films produced from his works is staggering.  And films made from his stories include sublime ones like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and terrifying ones like ""Carrie"" or ""The Shining"". Along the way there have also been a few real stinkers like ""Cujo"", ""Christine"" and ""Children of the Corn"".Secret Window ranks somewhere behind ""Misery"" in the story department, and it's easy to find comparisons between the two.  In both stories the main character is a writer - like King himself - and in both stories the writer finds himself in some remote location where they are threatened by someone who finds fault in their writing.In this movie Johnny Depp's Mort Rainey is the Stephen King surrogate.  We meet his nemesis John Shooter in the first scene, where Mr. Shooter tells Mr. Rainey that he is very unhappy that Mr. Rainey has plagiarized an unpublished manuscript that Shooter has written.  Shooter is played by John Turturro as a menacing man from Mississippi with a broad-brimmed hat.The suspense piles up as the threats from Shooter escalate to violence that no one in the movie thinks is under control.  At many times Rainey behaves with less sense than a teeny-bopper in Friday the 13th part gazillion, then in the final act his behavior is explained, sort of.

This is the only possible explanation for the lousiness of this script.  You know, he goes back to the meeting and the writers are tryina tell him the script is lousy but he's flying so high on Frazee paint fumes that he don't hear a thing.

For one, Secret Window is very well-made; creepy and effective and wonderfully shot. Johnny Depp is superb as always, and is joined by a great cast, which includes the beautiful Maria Bello, John Turturro, Charless Dutton, and Timothy Hutton.The suspense manages to build, slowly and steadily, to a very creepy, but predictable and unsatisfactory conclusion. Some may guess the twist long before the end credits, but even so, it's a chilling denouement and guaranteed to keep you in suspense until the somewhat ambiguous ending.All the performances are solid and the entire film makes an atmospheric use of handsome woodland and lakeside settings. Johnny Depp is an incredibly versatile actor and never disappoints with a performance. John Turturro does a memorable job as the man claiming to be the true author and Timothy Hutton is effective as the man who has stolen the affection of Depp's ex-wife. Mario Bello isn't given much to do but she is perfect as Depp's ex-wife and Charles Dutton never gives a bad performance.

Then there is a truly insidious Southern gentleman (John Turturro) who accuses him of stealing an old short story. As the depressed Mort tries to handle the aggressive nature of the Southerner (he wants `his' story changed) and his ex-wife's fianc&eacute;, strange things start to happen. Houses burn, manuscripts disappear, people are murdered, the Southerner starts baiting Rainey and, of course, someone murders Rainey's dog. Koepp manages to keep things from being too complicated and places one surprise after another in a sequence of scenes that moves at a steadily increasing clip. There are some genuinely suspenseful and tense moments; but the ending is typically Stephen King.

Shooter quickly becomes violent and ominous, and Rainey (Depp) tries to obtain a copy of a magazine in which the story was originally published, which predates Shooter's story by two years. As he tries to get the magazine that will prove his case, his dog is stabbed, his home is burned down, and a private detective he hires is murdered.The one substantive departure from the book involved the supposition that other people could see a ghostlike version of John Shooter, and I don't think the movie suffered for the omission. It must have seemed like an unnecessary extra, given the strong twin plot lines of ongoing divorce and crazed stalker. I liked the balance between the scary stuff and the sadness of the divorce, and there were several very effective scary scenes, in which an unseen killer seems to be lurking just outside the edge of the audience's field of vision. Depp does his usual good job, this time giving us a character who is alternately emotionless and emotional, who want more than anything to wallow in depression by sleeping on the couch. Conversely, I thought that John Turturro stunk it up as John Shooter, a fact partially due to some extremely clunky dialogue that lent artifice to the southern accent. Maria Bello continues to inspire mixed feelings in me; I liked her quite a bit in ""The Cooler,"" but thought she was the weak link in Payback, one of my favorite all-time movies.

Burns,"[1, 3]","After seeing Pirates of the Carribean, I think I would have liked just about anything Depp did that didn't involve him overacting in a bad Keith Richards impersonation (yes, I'm one of the 3 people who despised that movie). So the crackerjack hokeyness of writer/director David Koepp's Stephen King adaptation was a welcome change for the most part. Depp reminded me why he's such a valuable commodity as a star, composer Phillip Glass does an excellent tribute to Bernard Herrmann (redeeming himself for the worst score of the year, Taking Lives), and the whole alone-in-a-lakeside-cottage-with-writer's-block deal is perfect for a popcorn thriller. Secret Window is a blast for its first two-thirds if you get caught up in the trappings of the genre in which it indulges and don't expect much. But even I, who was really enjoying myself, couldn't get over the film's twist ending which simply fails miserably, to put it lightly. (Mild spoilers: if you haven't seen it, stop reading here) Koepp's screenplay and direction expect us to believe two different sides to Depp's character, and when he's played with such likeable nonchalance for most of the movie, his tribute to Nicholson's Jack Torrance just comes off as comical. I guess I could just blame it on the story, &quot;Secret Window,&quot; around which the movie revolves, but that would be letting it off too easily. Someone I know described the end of the film as &quot;annoying,&quot; and I couldn't agree more. Too bad, because it sank a potentially good flick.

I've read a couple, but watching this, I discovered every Stephen King stereotype/cliche is included. The loner eccentric writer, by himself in the middle of nowhere, the strange man - just everything about this film.There's also a very unexpected twist, which not only ruins what was already a mess before the twist hits, but comes so abruptly, that you have to actually pause the film and work out what on earth is going on. The 'twist' has become the most overused solutions in Hollywood in thrillers etc of the past few years, and they're getting worse, and more predictable each time. For me, the twist completely ruined this film.

One day, a stranger knocks at his door and accuses Mort of stealing his short story, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What a strange man...in a Quakerish style hat, with a rich Southern drawl, and cold, clinical eyes. John Turturro is wonderful in this role, bringing an inevitable demonic presence into Depp's tortured life.Although the outcome may be apparent, it doesn't really hit you until the director David Koepp wants it to. Depp's performance is great, including his habit of cracking his jaws whenever things get a little nervous. Maria Bello and Timoth Hutton as his estranged wife and her lover perform adequately, but they are really more plot tools than characters. Charles Dutton, likewise, isn't given a whole lot to do, but his presence is commanding.

Fortunately, I got something out of the deal - Maleficent agreed to see Dawn of the Dead without me even asking her. Did I mention I love my wife?Anyway, I did not love this movie. In an amusing twist, not only did I not enjoy Secret Window, I wasn't paying attention enough to catch onto the plot twist. Maleficent did - in fact, she said she saw the whole plot twist coming a mile away. In my defense, I feel the movie was boring enough such that I wasn't looking that hard for the Plot Twist &trade;.That, and the fact that there were two people in the movie theater who were possibly drunk, definitely movie hopping, and loudly whispering to each other throughout every potentially scary scene.""He's in the closet,"" the female would loudly whisper, ""I just know he's going to jump out and stab her.""""No he's not,"" says the male, ""he's under the bed...""I'm not sure if it's better or worse that they were wrong on EVERY count. Still, it completely distracted me from watching the movie. I seem to have this problem a lot (for more amusing anecdotes, see the throw down after Dawn of the Dead). But I digress.Secret Window is standard Stephen King fare. Good ole' Mr. King is an expert at taking an everyday domestic situation and turning it into a supernatural, awful occurrence. Indeed, the events that take place are awful enough - the supernatural just speeds up the horrible process. And that process is the complete destruction of a human being.The Stephen King Destruction Machine is in full effect in Secret Window. The main character, Mort Rainey (played with a multitude of character tics by the ever-experimenting Depp), is going through a divorce after his wife had a miscarriage. Worse, her caught her in bed with another man, a man she continues to date and who lives in ""their"" house. In fact, Secret Window has all the makings of an episode out of Cops, complete with wife beating, lawsuits, alcohol abuse, and houses being set on fire.Secret Window only bothers with the third and fourth elements, the other two being curiously repressed. Indeed, much of Secret Window is bizarrely out of place. Mort lives in a cabin where there were happier times. In that cabin is a secret window. It's also where he goes to think. Let's call it the ""secret window to his mind.""But Mort's not thinking. He's not writing. He's got the worst case of writer's block ever. Mostly, he sits on the couch and occasionally answers an old phone.Why doesn't Mort have a cell phone? Well, cause that would screw up the plot in about five minutes. Much of the movie feels outdated without explanation for why it doesn't deal with modern plot elements (but Mort's laptop is definitely modern).Secret Window has some beautiful symbolism, symbolism entirely on the part of the director and having very little to do with Mr. King. We flow through a mirror at one point of the film and then out again - that's Very Important. Indeed, if anything, Secret Window ranges from hackneyed to over-the-top-obvious.Without giving away the plot, I can confidently say that Session 9 explored the same human depths of depravity, the same loss of self, the same murder mystery, only it did it much better. Session 9 kicks this movies ass.Ultimately, there's nothing GREAT about this movie, and that's a shame.

Mort denies the accusation, claiming that he wrote the story first and can prove it. But John Shooter is determined to exact revenge.""Secret Window"" is based on Stephen King's story ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"", published in his 1990 collection ""Four Past Midnight"". The story was adapted for the screen and directed by David Koepp. Koepp does an admirable job of manipulating the audience, creating suspense, and surprising us. Johnny Depp is perfect in the role of this slightly eccentric, suddenly spooked writer. John Turturro gives the most memorable performance of the film as the monotone, obsessed, menacing villain. I wouldn't have pictured Turturro in the role of a country bumpkin. It just goes to show the breadth of his talent. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Secret Window"". It looks good. The story is solid and layered. Director David Koepp is creative, clever, and has a great sense of timing.The DVD: Bonus features include four deleted scenes, three featurettes, ""Animatics"", and an audio commentary from director David Koepp. ""From Book to Film"" is a documentary featuring interviews with David Koepp and the film's cast. The first 10 minutes of it basically just recap the film. Then there is some discussion of casting and filming. I wouldn't bother with this one. ""A Look Through It"" is a better documentary. 30 minutes long, David Koepp talks about the decisions he made shooting key sequences in the film, such as the opening hotel sequence and shooting inside the cabin. ""Secrets Revealed"" is a 13-minute documentary discussing the final 15 minutes of the movie. If you're really interested, these last two documentaries are the ones to watch. ""Animatics"" shows what are essentially animated storyboards for four scenes in the film. There is no narration or explanation. I had already heard too much commentary from the director to want to listen to the film's audio commentary, so I can't comment on that except to say that director David Koepp is interesting and well-spoken, so you might want to give the commentary a try if an hour's worth of featurettes haven't satisfied you.

I would say that Depp has made an artform out of looking like the cat dragged him through the hedge backwards. His acting, in contrast, is very good, and he carries the intensity well.John Turturro, whom I always associated mostly with Adam Sandler comedies, comes across as a very freaky John Shooter, who accuses Rainey of stealing his story. Turturro really surprised me with the way that his posture, facial expressions and drawling accent carried a sense of forboding across. And that hat was just a nice touch.Without throwing in spoilers to the plot, I found this film to be excellent in most aspects. Some of the production was a little bit sloppy, (I noticed two mistakes in continuity, one which was with that hat that I loved so much).

Now he lives a life of sloth and occasional unproductive bouts of writing in his cabin in the middle of nowhere... until a mysterious man called Shooter (an excellently ambiguous John Turturro) appears with a grudge to resolve.  Shooter claims Depp stole one of his stories.  Depp's journey to prove he didn't, brings him back into the life of his estranged wife (Mario Bello) and the new man in her life.  Things get gradually weirder, and Depp starts to feel his life unravelling, even as he enlists the help of a bodyguard (Charles Dutton).There's a nicely evoked sense of manufactured reality to the movie entirely in keeping with the tone of the movie.  This is noticeable for example in the use of mirrors.. through which we travel into to find ourselves in the middle of something we thought we were merely seeing a reflection of, or see something we shouldn't be able to see.  It's satisfyingly disquieting, and it's stylistic moments such as these which make the film a minor pleasure.  That, and the rather excellent cast - Depp, Turturro and Bello all characteristically bring unique life to their roles.  A Hitchockian beginning shifts in tone as the movie progresses, and the ending is telegraphed enough to be not much of a surprise to many I would imagine.. however, it's relatively entertaining getting there.  In any case, we're not asked to spend too long on the journey, the movie being edited down to the bones of the story to keep you engaged.

It's Stephen King fair and for some reasons his good thriller writing hasn't always translated consistently to good films. Sure some of them have been the scariest stories to hit the theaters, but others have been real duds. &quot;Secret Window,&quot; falls somewhere between the two. What holds it back is...there's nothing really new here. Take &quot;Dolores Claiborne,&quot; and cross it with &quot;The Shining,&quot; and well...you've got &quot;Secret Window.&quot;Depp puts in an interesting performance (as he most always does)as the central character, a writer that is remote cabin bound while his life is falling apart. John Turturro's character is played with significant quirk, however his homespun backwoods down home &quot;Deliverance&quot; style comes across as one-dimensional and ultimately not believable and worst of all not really frightening. The story line has a few intended surprises but the movie seems to telegraph them.When all is said and done, you will find yourself getting deja vu...you've been here before, you've watched bits and pieces of this movie in other movies.

Is that what you want after investing 90 minutes of your time? Do you really believe in the 21st century that people have this split-personality disorder? It is about as realistic as just throwing a three-eyed alien into the movie and saying that it was the cause of it all.It is true that Secret Window has an excellent premise - an author, going through a divorce, living out in the country, in the middle off writer's block, meets a stranger who claims that he stole his story and then the stranger proceeds to make the writer's life a misery by killing and harming everyone around him... all because the writer stole his story, a story that our protagonist claims he wrote himself. Interesting yes, but the fact that the ending is just so lame makes it all totally worthless, however this movie does have some good points in that the final last scene is not that bad, the dialogue is quite witty throughout and both lead actors - Depp and Turturro are on flying form... but all is marred by a rehash of the stupid ending we got in Identity. How they could do this once in the 21st century is incredible given that some young talented directors can hardly get a greenlight for their next ORIGINAL project.

Other cast members included Charles S. Dutton, John Turturro, Maria Bello and Timothy Hutton.Depp plays Mort Rainey, a famous mystery writer, that is seperated from his beautiful wife.  His wife is anxiously awaiting him to sign the divorce papers since she has obviously taken him to the cleaners and has a new boyfriend too.  The new boyfriend seems just as anxious for Mort to be out of their lives, so that he can enjoy the wife and the money that she will get from the settlement.  Mort must still love his wife and really does not want to let go.  A mystery man shows up at his door claiming that Mort stole his story.  They haggle back and forth about who the true author of the story is.  John Shooter (the mystery man) speaks like a country hick and appears to have supernatural strength.  He wants the ending of the story changed and credit to him for writing it.  Mort seeks out the town's Sheriff and a few other trusted people to help him get rid of John Shooter.  John Shooter begins killing people that can help Mort in any shape or fashion.  He even kills the family dog with a screwdriver.  There even seems to be a tie between Shooter and the wife's boyfriend.  It appears that Shooter wants to frame Mort for all the murders if he does not change the story's ending.  Mort has flash backs that gives the viewer a hint of how to piece together this action packed, suspenful, thrilling puzzle.  I could not predict what was going on until the movie was ready to reveal who the true killer was.  It took a twist that had me on the edge of my seat.

Of course Pirates of the Caribbean gave him ample stage room to run through his entire repertoire, so, by comparison, Secret Window comes up a bit short. They're entirely different genres, Pirates being high camp/adventure and Window being creepy horror, but still, there's room for comparison.Depp, excellently cast against the equally well-cast John Turturro, plays a depressed, recently divorced writer who is surprised one day to be approached in his remote lakeside cabin by a distinctly threatening dude with a hillbilly accent and, tho you don't see it, it's clear the guy maybe used to be an axe murderer. He accuses Depp of plagiarism. As this all began with a Stephen King tale, you know where it's heading: into the realm of other-worldly horror stuff.Not Depp's best work, although given what he had to work with, he does a helluva good job of it.

Like so much of that author's work, it deals, in twisted ways, with potential dilemmas that writers (e.g., King himself) might face. Critics largely panned the film because they felt that it lacked suspense, it was derivative, etc. But that's not really the point. The film is a crisp character study of personality break-down during the dissolution of a marriage. On those terms, it succeeds brilliantly. Johnny Depp, a chameleon of an actor, once again provides the lead with astonishing style, individuality, insight, subtlety, and nuance. The rest of the cast is similarly attuned to the material: John Turturro, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Len Cariou. The director/screenwriter, David Koepp, uses striking images and compelling camera movements. Those who know his ""Stir of Echoes"" (which I found dreary) will find this to be far more elegant and colorful, lighter and inventive.

Now, The Dark Half was taken on by a mighty, mighty director, George Romero, and it failed miserably. David Koepp is a good director (witness Stir of Echoes) and, when he wants to be, a fantastic writer (Bad Influence, the underrated TV series Hack), but let's face it, David Koepp is not on the level of George Romero. So why did anyone think this was going to work?Granted, they assembled one of the finest casts in recent history here-- Johnny Depp, Golden Globe winner and nominated for more Golden Globes, Oscars, and Oranges than you can shake a stick at; Golden Globe nominee and Cannes Best Actor winner John Turturro; Golden Globe nominee Maria Bello; Oscar and Golden Globe winner Timothy Hutton; Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee Charles S. Dutton... I could keep going, but why? You've got a who's-who of underrated Hollywood already. And every one of them turns in a performance as wooden as the trees in Maine. Even Johnny Depp, who in a thirty-film career has never, even in his worst films, played a role that wasn't excellent, is off form here for the first (and perhaps only) time in his career. Depp, who has made a number of otherwise awful films worth watching, however marginally (Sleepy Hollow, The Astronaut's Wife, Don Juan DeMarco), can't save this turkey. The pacing is horrendous, and boredom will set in before ten minutes have passed. I will warn you, it gets no better. This is a thriller completely devoid of thrills, a mystery that's solvable long before the boneheads on the screen work it out.

He receives a visit from a strange man from Mississippi, played believably by Brooklyn-bred John Turturro, who says simply, ""Yew stole mah storay.""

He is in the process of divorcing his wife and lives alone in a isolated cabin near a lake. Depp plays an author, Mort, and the movie starts slowly as he tries to write a story and talks to his dog. A stranger comes to the door claiming that Mort stole his story and Depp dismisses him. The guy keeps popping up and claiming Mort stole his story and violent things start to happen. Mort's dog is found dead, then his old house that his wife lives in is burned down. Mort tries to talk to a sheriff and hires a private investigator but still the mysterios stranger Jake Shooter continues to confront him. The movie doesn't sound special but it is well made with an excellent ending. The actors say on the behind the scenes footage that also comes on the DVD that as they read the script they were completely suprised by the ending. Mort is a very interesting and unusual character. He has become isolated since he and his wife seperated. He has weird dream scenes and is paranoid. He thinks to himself but refers to himself as you.

He looked exactly like a writer- tousled hair, hilariously tattered robe, the works. He worked the part of a lonely writer perfectly. He played this 'lonely writer' who is obviously still tortured about his wife's infidelity and their divorce they are finishing through, and then to add to his problems a guy comes to his door and claims he stole his story. Throughout the entire movie I was kept in suspense, because I honestly didn't know what was going to be the solution of this plot.And yet the solution is where I dropped one star. The ending was a total killer for me. I don't know why, but in the back of my mind I made the assumption that this guy accusing Depp's character of plagirism was a lot more than he turned out to be. I won't ruin the ending for people who haven't seen it, but trust me, the ending is not explosive, not surprising, not anything. It's just a dull 'oh yeah' kind of ending.

821106,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002234LS,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","By about a half hour into ""Secret Window,"" I had pretty much figured out what was really happening and where the story was heading.  That's not usually a good sign when it comes to films of this type, but ""Secret Window"" still manages to be a fairly efficient psycho/stalker thriller, even with its painfully obvious triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip ending.Based on a Stephen King work, the film stars Johnny Depp as a writer named Morton Rainey, a character we may assume is not too far removed in some ways from the author himself.  One day, Rainey is approached by a mysterious stranger from Mississippi (John Turturro) who accuses the writer of having plagiarized one of his stories (published by Rainey under the title ""Secret Window"").  Despite Rainey's protests of innocence in the matter, the man, who calls himself ""Shooter,"" starts making life miserable for the young author, who is already struggling with a messy divorce from the wife (Maria Bello) he caught cheating on him in a nearby motel.Thrillers like ""Secret Window"" always seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to working out their storylines.  Modern audiences have developed such an insatiable appetite for ever more elaborate plot twists and surprise turnabout endings that the writers of these films end up having to compromise narrative plausibility to satisfy the demand.  As a result, like most thrillers these days, ""Secret Window"" starts off well then goes steadily downhill, as the plot elements begin to spin more and more out of control and credibility flies out the window.For a good part of the time, ""Secret Window"" is fun to watch, as Depp tries to figure out what it is that this enigmatic stranger really wants.  Although the red herrings are not always totally effective, they do occasionally divert us off the tried-and-true path along which the story is traveling.  The film is at its best when dealing with the tensions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms.  The actors bring a human dimension to what is, after all, a pretty soulless exercise in audience manipulation.  Turturro has a fun time hamming it up with his cornpone Southern accent, although he still manages to come across as a threatening and menacing figure from time to time.There's a small window hidden behind a piece of furniture that may or may not hold the key to everything, but it is so confusingly handled in the screenplay that the audience is left scratching its head trying to figure out what it all means. Indeed, that is the biggest shortcoming of the movie's final act; besides being silly, implausible and way over-the-top, it doesn't make the connections it needs to in order for us to understand what's really going on.  It's all a game of a thriller, but a game that fails to lay down the rules in a fair enough way so that we in the audience can play along as well.  As a result, we feel very much cheated and had by the time the closing credits come crawling by.  So, if you go into ""Secret Window"" with your eyes open and your credibility meter shut off, you may wind up enjoying the film.",3,"a mixed bag, but a fairly enjoyable thriller",1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,3150,"['half', 'hour', 'Secret', 'Window', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'heading', 'not', 'usually', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'films', 'type', 'Secret', 'Window', 'still', 'be', 'fairly', 'efficient', 'psycho/stalker', 'thriller', 'even', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip', 'ending.Based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'film', 'stars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'writer', 'named', 'Morton', 'Rainey', 'character', 'may', 'assume', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'ways', 'author', 'One', 'day', 'Rainey', 'approached', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'Mississippi', 'John', 'Turturro', 'who', 'writer', 'having', 'plagiarized', 'one', 'stories', 'published', 'Rainey', 'title', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Rainey', 'protests', 'innocence', 'matter', 'man', 'who', 'Shooter', 'making', 'life', 'miserable', 'young', 'author', 'who', 'already', 'struggling', 'messy', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'caught', 'cheating', 'nearby', 'motel.Thrillers', 'Secret', 'Window', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'caught', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'storylines', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'have', 'developed', 'insatiable', 'appetite', 'ever', 'more', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'twists', 'surprise', 'turnabout', 'endings', 'writers', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'compromise', 'narrative', 'plausibility', 'satisfy', 'demand', 'result', 'most', 'thrillers', 'days', 'Secret', 'Window', 'off', 'well', 'then', 'steadily', 'downhill', 'plot', 'elements', 'begin', 'spin', 'more', 'more', 'control', 'credibility', 'flies', 'out', 'window.For', 'good', 'part', 'time', 'Secret', 'Window', 'fun', 'watch', 'Depp', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'enigmatic', 'stranger', 'really', 'red', 'herrings', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'totally', 'effective', 'do', 'occasionally', 'divert', 'off', 'tried-and-true', 'path', 'story', 'traveling', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'dealing', 'tensions', 'Rainey', 'wife', 'Amy', 'current', 'lover', 'Ted', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'actors', 'bring', 'human', 'dimension', 'what', 'pretty', 'soulless', 'exercise', 'audience', 'manipulation', 'Turturro', 'fun', 'time', 'hamming', 'up', 'cornpone', 'Southern', 'accent', 'still', 'come', 'threatening', 'menacing', 'figure', 'time', 'time.There', 'small', 'window', 'hidden', 'piece', 'furniture', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'key', 'everything', 'so', 'confusingly', 'handled', 'screenplay', 'audience', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Indeed', 'biggest', 'shortcoming', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'being', 'silly', 'implausible', 'way', 'over-the-top', ""n't"", 'make', 'connections', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'game', 'thriller', 'game', 'lay', 'down', 'rules', 'fair', 'enough', 'way', 'audience', 'can', 'play', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'result', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'cheated', 'had', 'time', 'closing', 'come', 'crawling', 'So', 'go', 'Secret', 'Window', 'eyes', 'open', 'credibility', 'meter', 'shut', 'off', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'enjoying', 'film']",N/A

Rainey, portrayed excellently by Depp, is a writer struggling through a painful divorce with his wife (Bello) after discovering her cheating on him with another man (Hutton).Retreating to their old , remote lake house in the country, Mort Rainey discovers an unwanted fan- the slightly off-beat and stalker-ish John Shooter (Turturro) who claims unfair plagiarism of his book, with all the same story line but a different ending. After denying this statement, Rainey discovers the true terrors that await from this man and Rainey's own mind.This movie follows the deteriorating mind of a mystery writer who begins to slowly lose his sanity after a painful divorce. Watching Rainey retrace steps and discover his own flaws in his plan that backfires on himself is positively mind-jolting and sends shivers up your spine when you reach the climatic ending.

821110,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0002234LS,Sarah Schenkkan,"[0, 1]","By this point in his career, we as audiences have learned that Johnny Depp always picks the roles, some questionable at first glance, that interest, entertain, and delight us. After such films as ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Benny and Joon"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", his latest project, the at times clumsy ""Secret Window"", showcases his unique sense of humor, characterization and personality in a performance that is the highlight of an otherwise disappointing film.In ""Secret Window"", he stars as Mort Rainey, a neurotic writer struggling to overcome his difficult divorce and put his life back into order. Six months after falling out with his wife Amy (played by Maria Bello), he has holed up in a secluded cabin deep in the woods of Upstate New York, refusing to sign the divorce papers and suffering from a bad case of writer's block. However, one day he encounters John Shooter, a strange man from Mississippi who claims that one of Rainey's well-known stories, ""Secret Window"" (hence, the title) was stolen and plagiarized from him. Shooter even leaves him his manuscript, and Rainey reads it, discovering that it strikes remarkable resemblances to his own story written years before. Although he ignores Shooter's threats at first, Shooter turns out to be much more than he has bargained for, and as his threats turn into violent acts of revenge that grow in severity and meaning, Rainey must figure out how to anticipate and stop him. Not only do tensions rise between Shooter and Rainey, but also between Rainey and Amy's new boyfriend Ted (Timothy Hutton), who also begins to threaten him.As I said before, the highlight of ""Secret Window"" is the performance by Johnny Depp. He completely absorbs the character of Mort Rainey, giving him a new depth, believability, and suprisingly, humor; something pleasant you don't see often in thriller movies. He brings a crowd-pleasing energy, and still manages to inject his signature personality in his role, which alone carries the film. Had Depp not been a part of ""Secret Window"" I think I would have given it a much lower rating. John Turturro, as John Shooter, gives a solid and scary performance, bringing back his familiar accent from ""O, Brother Where Art Thou?"". The rest of the cast is simply mediocre, which does nothing but emphasize the brilliance by Depp.Although Johnny Depp makes a fine effort to save the film, it is not enough, and although ""Secret Window"" delivers an exciting and suspenseful hour and a half, the last and completely unnecessary twenty minutes completely degrade what credibility the script had earned. The twists and frightful gags are somewhat predictable, and although the movie promises to deliver an eye-opening climax, the actual ending leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. In my opinion, the film could have ended twenty minutes earlier, and it would be much more chilling and impressive.Although it provides a few good chilling scenes (enhanced by the eerie soundtrack by Philip Glass), the main reason to see ""Secret Window"" is for the performance by Depp, which, due to his humor and personality keeps this film afloat.",3,"Depp's Talent Is No Secret In ""Window""",1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,3125,"['point', 'career', 'audiences', 'have', 'learned', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'always', 'roles', 'questionable', 'first', 'glance', 'interest', 'entertain', 'delight', 'such', 'films', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Benny', 'Joon', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'latest', 'project', 'times', 'clumsy', 'Secret', 'Window', 'unique', 'sense', 'humor', 'characterization', 'personality', 'performance', 'highlight', 'otherwise', 'disappointing', 'film.In', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'neurotic', 'writer', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'difficult', 'divorce', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'order', 'Six', 'months', 'falling', 'out', 'wife', 'Amy', 'played', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'holed', 'up', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'deep', 'woods', 'Upstate', 'New', 'York', 'refusing', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'suffering', 'bad', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'However', 'one', 'day', 'John', 'Shooter', 'strange', 'man', 'Mississippi', 'who', 'one', 'Rainey', 'well-known', 'stories', 'Secret', 'Window', 'hence', 'title', 'was', 'stolen', 'plagiarized', 'Shooter', 'even', 'manuscript', 'Rainey', 'discovering', 'remarkable', 'resemblances', 'own', 'story', 'written', 'years', 'before', 'Shooter', 'threats', 'first', 'Shooter', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'bargained', 'threats', 'turn', 'violent', 'acts', 'revenge', 'grow', 'severity', 'meaning', 'Rainey', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'anticipate', 'stop', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'tensions', 'rise', 'Shooter', 'Rainey', 'also', 'Rainey', 'Amy', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Ted', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'who', 'also', 'threaten', 'him.As', 'said', 'highlight', 'Secret', 'Window', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'completely', 'absorbs', 'character', 'Mort', 'Rainey', 'giving', 'new', 'depth', 'believability', 'suprisingly', 'humor', 'something', 'pleasant', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'thriller', 'movies', 'crowd-pleasing', 'energy', 'still', 'inject', 'signature', 'personality', 'role', 'alone', 'film', 'Had', 'Depp', 'not', 'been', 'part', 'Secret', 'Window', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'much', 'lower', 'rating', 'John', 'Turturro', 'John', 'Shooter', 'solid', 'scary', 'performance', 'bringing', 'back', 'familiar', 'accent', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'rest', 'cast', 'simply', 'mediocre', 'nothing', 'emphasize', 'brilliance', 'Depp.Although', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fine', 'effort', 'save', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'Secret', 'Window', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'hour', 'half', 'last', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'completely', 'degrade', 'what', 'credibility', 'script', 'had', 'earned', 'twists', 'frightful', 'gags', 'are', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'movie', 'deliver', 'eye-opening', 'climax', 'actual', 'ending', 'audience', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'opinion', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'chilling', 'impressive.Although', 'few', 'good', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'enhanced', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'Secret', 'Window', 'performance', 'Depp', 'due', 'humor', 'personality', 'keeps', 'film', 'afloat']",N/A

Fourteen years later it comes to sighing, whispering life on the screen, portrayed with excellent acting and a very clean script.Johnny Depp has morphed into a truly great actor, talented and versatile, and he brings Mort Rainey's quirky writer's personality into a fully fleshed out character.  Notable also are Timothy Hutton's role as Ted Milner (remember 1981's Taps?), Maria Bello as Amy Rainey, and John TurTurro as John Shooter.  The movie is well filmed, well acted, and (I hate to say it) well directed.Mort Rainey is a writer going through a rather unfriendly divorce from his wife of ten years, Amy.  Alone and bitter in his cabin, he continues to work on his writing when John Shooter shows up on his doorstep, claiming Rainey stole his story.Mort says he can prove the story belongs to him and not Shooter, but while Mort digs around for the magazine which published the story in question years ago, things begin to happen around Shooter.  Mort's dog dies, people begin to die, and his divorce proceedings with Amy continue to get uglier.It seems that Shooter has Mort over a barrel, but perhaps Mort has his own ideas on how to resolve all the problems that plague him lately.Not fast paced or even remarkably cunning in its twists, this is still a very powerful movie with some finger-chewing intensity and even a few chuckles along the way.

821112,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0002234LS,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","David Koepp (""Panic Room"") wrote and directed this horror/thriller flick, an  adaptation of a Stephen King story.  Johnny Depp sinks his teeth into the role of Mort Rainey, a successful author tortured by the memory of discovering his wife's infidelity.Living alone in his gorgeous, rustic lake cabin, Rainey is plodding through the hum-drum writer's life (procrastination intermixed with drinking and breaking vows to stop smoking) when a mysterious stranger shows up at his front door.  John Shooter (John Turturro), who appears to be Mississippi Amish, claims that Rainey stole one of his stories, and he demands a reckoning.  It's clear from Shooter's stony gaze (and Turturro's inherent zaniness) that Rainey faces dire consequences if he does not comply.Is Shooter telling the truth?  Can Rainey bluff his way through, or does he have to hire some muscle (Charles S Dutton)?  And what role does Rainey's soon-to-be ex (Maria Bello) and her lover (Timothy Hutton) play in the whole mix?The Law of Economy of Characters, plus the knowledge that you're watching a Stephen King flick, basically gives away the creepy ending.  So you're left with the performances to keep you interested in the story.  For the most part, it succeeds, and largely due to Depp's willingness to find the  shadiest sides of his own persona.  What could have easily been a paint-by-numbers flick becomes something more interesting.But it must be said that this is neither King's nor Koepp's best work.

Well, I'm glad I did watch it.  King is a student of horror, particularly the American Lit 101 type.  And in ""Secret Window"" you'll see King's ""hat"" tipped  to Poe, Bierce, Hawthorne, not to mention King himself ( ""The Shining""). (And, from a movie-making point of view, don't forget Hitchcock!)  I think one reason that some have not latched onto this film is that it's primarily psychological horror - and one that deals with the double.  Popular expectations, when it comes to King, seems to run toward desire for the outward Boo.  Well, King can do that kind of horror, and do it well, but King himself has said, that (good) horror writers are ones concerned with the psychology of fear.  And as King has aged, and matured as a writer, it's the demons in the head that concern him most.  The movie itself is well acted, with Depp giving a solid performance as Mort Rainey, a quirky, very depressed, writer suffering from writer's block.  But the problems are much deeper on that front, and things simply are not as they appear.  Maria Bello as Rainey's estranged wife Amy, is excellent, nearly stealing the movie, and certainly deepening the tragedy, since her character, as acted, has depth, and is no cutout.  Tim Hutton is simply annoying as the other man, and you have to wonder just what Amy sees in him.  Then again, considering Mort's demons, any man would do.  Turtorro, as John Shooter, is a hoot in an over-the-top performance. What makes this forgivable and understandable is revealed by who really wears the hat.

The problem seems to be the source material: Stephen King's story is probably too slight to justify a feature, and the setup is so well crafted in the ""intelligent thriller"" mode that the climax, when it comes, feels far less clever than it ought to be. Still, it's not without its compensations. David Koepp continues to demonstrate that he can direct as well as write. He provides plenty of Hitchcockian moments of suspense, and the score by Philip Glass evokes precisely the kind of music Bernard Herrmann used to write.

It may be the directing that was at fault, which delivers a film that drags along at points and never makes you jump (this being a thriller supposedly), and also which basically reveals what the ""score"" is from the very opening scenes if you were careful enough to notice. Even if not, most people i know knew what the trick was midway through the film and that can't have been what the director wanted.It might've also been the script-writer. I haven't read the book, but what i saw on the film script-wise, certainly doesnt qualify this as a ""scare-pic"". It never reaches any levels of respectable intensity and it never really grabs you.Nevertheless, the two main protagonists, J.Depp and J.Turturo are absolutely great, both in their own regards. Depp plays his part of a slacker author in a massive writer's block with brio and humor, and Turturo plays the cold-blooded sadist-killer from the south with equal zest and attitude. I, in fact, enjoyed Turturo's part even more than Depp's, and that while being a massive Depp fan.There's been a lot of films like that, coming of Hollywood lately, ""who-dunnits"" with a big twist in the end, and Secret window is definetely one of the least impressive in its category.Aside of the actors' performances, this is a film that's forgettable.

In fact it was another Stephen King movie, done much better, Called, &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.Oddly enough, that movie's star Timothy Hutton is a co-star in this movie. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey, a successful mystery writer who's holed up in his lakeside cabin trying to finish a novel even though his mind is on a messy divorce proceeding with his cheating wife (Maria Bello).One day, a scary cracker (John Turturro, with a ludicrous Mississippi accent) appears on Mort's doorstep claiming the author has word-for-word stolen a story he had written years before and published it in the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.He's innocent, of course, and tries to brush off the man, and even calls the police. But nothing works, and pretty soon the disgruntled amateur is stalking Mort, killing off his friends and making a most unusual demand on his literary talent.Like so many Hollywood thrillers of the past decade, the movie's structure takes you along a certain path and then drops a revelation in the last act that's supposed to raise the hair on the back of your neck and force you to see the story in a whole new light.But Koepp's script and direction is just not clever enough to make the trick work. The audience is way ahead of him on this one. When you add the usual thriller cliches and some graphic abuse of women and dogs to the predictability, it's altogether a bad trip.Depp, who spends most of the movie in a ragged bathrobe and what looks like a blond fright wig, has some enjoyably eccentric moments as the tormented hero.

Whether over-the-top funny in Pirates of the Caribbean and Ed Wood, or more understated like in this film or Edward Scissorhands, Depp adds a balanced believability to the characters he portrays that makes them leap from the screen in full 3-D.  The supporting cast is solid but unspectacular, so it is Depp who really shines here.The film stays very close to the short story in most respects.  After watching the film, I re-read the story (in Stephen King's Four Past Midnight collection) and found large sections of dialogue translated directly into the screenplay.  There are some subtle plot variances between the screenplay and the story, but the influence of King's storyline is very evident in the screenplay.  Ironically, the part that deviates the most from King's story is the ending--(""I want you to fix the ending, Mr. Rainey."")  All things considered, however, this is a very faithful adaptation of a lesser known King work that does not lose the macabre devilishness of King's writing in translation to the screen.The only thing with which I found fault was the initial pacing of the film.  Part of the slow pace is intentional--setting up Mort's slothful state of existence is key to the story--but after 20 minutes or so, it begins to wear a bit thin and the viewer may wind up wondering whether this is really going to go anywhere.  It eventually does go somewhere, but it takes a bit of patience for the plot elements to gel and garner any serious viewer interest.

I have heard the phrase recently on the title of an article about Depp...""a little Depp will do ya"" well, in this case, ""a lotta Depp will do as well and quite well""! I became an instant fan of his and the movie after seeing his work in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"",but, it was this film that made me truly appreciate what a gifted actor Depp truly is and it forced me to go back and rewatch his other work I had seen and watch his work I had not seen. All of which I was never disappointed. Let me just say I loved this movie. I stayed intrigued throughout the entire film and the ending did surprise me unlike some other reviews I have read who seemed disappointed. Don't let the fact that it was only in theaters for 2 or 3 weeks fool you. Its very good. I had not read the book because I really don't care for much of Stephen King's books so maybe that was a plus for me...I don't know. But this movie I take exception to even though I understand there were a few changes. It was ""based"" on the novella though keep in mind. Depp commanded the screen which is good since there were many many scenes with just him or with him and his dog Chico. I was never bored watching him play Mort. He was quirky, strange, an unpredictable and at many times very very humorous. In fact I chuckled and laughed quite often and was thoroughly entertained as well.Isn't that why we usually see a movie? Depp spilled out his lines as if he really was Mort. This could have been a character you didn't like,but, you did like him..you couldn't help yourself. Depp became the character ,which he usually does in all of his films, and you believe him. I was on the edge of my seat many times and trying to figure things out throughout all of it and then was very surprised in the end, and, afterall...""all that really matters is the ending""! I think many will be pleasantly surprised when they view this. Don't go watching this expecting the book on screen there were changes and some have said they were glad there were. Watch this as another intriguing Depp film. I am constantly amazed at how it seems every single character this man plays is different from the last one unlike so many actors who keep playing the same type of role in movie after movie.

I wasn't compelled to see it in the theater and I wasn't enthusiastic about it once the DVD showed up in the house.But then I watched the first fifteen minutes . . . and, well, it got interesting.  As others have noted, Depp's acting is, as usual, superb.  The man is one of the best actors we have at this time.  And the story does pull you in.  The characters are well drawn (as is the case with most King novels) and viewers will want to see what happens to them as the story progresses.However, the story itself and Stephen King's reputation are part of the problem.&quot;Secret Window&quot; was based on a King novella within the larger work &quot;Four Past Midnight.&quot;  For some reason, King's novellas and shorter novels (Stand By Me, Shawshank, The Shining, Carrie) have translated the best to film while his longer works (The Stand, Tommyknockers) are utterly horrible.  Given this track record, &quot;Secret Window&quot; should have been one of the better King movies.  The problem here is that &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot; was never an example of King's better work.  Thus, in a sense, the director has to rescue the movie from the perception of King as the &quot;master of horror.&quot;  When you have the deck stacked against you like that it's hard to come through with the goods.  &quot;Secret Window&quot; is basically a love triangle in which one of the characters goes nuts.  A plausible story, but it's difficult to present a story as routine as this is in a manner that will satisfy the hype.&quot;Secret Window&quot; is a good movie.  It's just not great.  And it's certanly not worthy of all the King hype.  Still, it's worth a look.  Depp's acting is especially worth watching.  And the story, if you're in the mood, is a bit scary at times.As for the DVD, it's also worth a look.  The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the featurette sequences are interesting, more so in fact than most such extras on other DVDs.  Far too often we get DVDs which show us scene after boring scene showing us the technical aspects of how a movie was filmed.  Here we at least get a brief glance at some of the human interest aspects behind the camera. I would have liked to have seen an interview with the author, but that seems to be a rarity amongst all DVDs.  I think that all movies adapted from books should have this extra feature (assuming the author is still alive).",4,"Flawed, but better than expected",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,2432,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'compelled', 'see', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'enthusiastic', 'once', 'DVD', 'showed', 'up', 'house.But', 'then', 'watched', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'well', 'got', 'interesting', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Depp', 'acting', 'usual', 'superb', 'man', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'have', 'time', 'story', 'pull', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'case', 'most', 'King', 'novels', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'story', 'progresses.However', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'reputation', 'are', 'part', 'problem.', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Window', 'quot', 'was', 'based', 'King', 'novella', 'larger', 'work', 'quot', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight.', 'quot', 'reason', 'King', 'novellas', 'shorter', 'novels', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Shawshank', 'Shining', 'Carrie', 'have', 'translated', 'best', 'film', 'longer', 'works', 'Stand', 'Tommyknockers', 'are', 'utterly', 'horrible', 'Given', 'track', 'record', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Window', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'better', 'King', 'movies', 'problem', 'here', 'quot', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'quot', 'was', 'never', 'example', 'King', 'better', 'work', 'Thus', 'sense', 'director', 'rescue', 'movie', 'perception', 'King', 'quot', 'master', 'horror.', 'quot', 'When', 'have', 'deck', 'stacked', 'hard', 'come', 'goods', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Window', 'quot', 'basically', 'love', 'triangle', 'one', 'characters', 'nuts', 'plausible', 'story', 'difficult', 'present', 'story', 'as', 'routine', 'manner', 'will', 'satisfy', 'hype.', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Window', 'quot', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'certanly', 'not', 'worthy', 'King', 'hype', 'Still', 'look', 'Depp', 'acting', 'especially', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', ""'re"", 'mood', 'bit', 'scary', 'times.As', 'DVD', 'also', 'worth', 'look', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'featurette', 'sequences', 'are', 'interesting', 'more', 'so', 'fact', 'most', 'such', 'extras', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'get', 'DVDs', 'show', 'scene', 'boring', 'scene', 'showing', 'technical', 'aspects', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Here', 'least', 'get', 'brief', 'glance', 'human', 'interest', 'aspects', 'camera', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'interview', 'author', 'be', 'rarity', 'DVDs', 'think', 'movies', 'adapted', 'books', 'should', 'have', 'extra', 'feature', 'assuming', 'author', 'still', 'alive']",N/A
821134,A2RMQW7RQ2VI6I,B0002234LS,"Travis R. Wilson ""Travis Rhett Wilson""","[0, 1]","This actually turned out to be a pretty good adaptation of an OK Stephen King tale. One of the better ones I've seen, actually. Johnny Depp plays Morton Rainey, a frustrated writer who is going through a bitter divorce, and has secluded himself in his weekend cabin way out in the boondocks to escape the pain. Both his writing, and his sanity are suffering as a result of this turn of events. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, a mysterious stranger who calls himself John Shooter (played rather well by John Turturro) shows up at his door, pointing an accusing finger, and proclaiming to him ""You stole my story."" Rainey is shocked and flabbergasted and chaos soon ensues.Like I said, this dramatization didn't turn out half-bad. I actually *enjoyed* hearing the actors speak Stephen King's dialogue, for a change. Johnny Depp is on the ball, as always. John Turturro perfectly put forth the subdued menace of John Shooter's character, and the other actors were satisfactory.There were of course the usual script difficulties that had to be worked out. In the book Mort has a pet cat. In the movie it's a dog. I guess it would have been much harder to train a cat to do the things that were required for the story. Also, the ending is different. Usually that sort of thing just pisses me off, but this time I was just struck dumb about it. I guess they picked a better ending, and Depp's character sort of justifies it in his final monologue, but I still haven't been able to decide whether I like it or not. I will say this, though. It wasn't even one tenth as frustrating as the ending I was expecting. As always, I strongly urge anyone who is interested in this flick to read the short story ""Secret Window, Secret Garden,"" from the collection ""Four Past Midnight"" before watching it. I think the impact and the inside jokes in the final scene will have a greater affect on those who do so, like it did with me.",4,Hmm...,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,1929,"['actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation', 'OK', 'Stephen', 'King', 'tale', 'One', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actually', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Morton', 'Rainey', 'frustrated', 'writer', 'who', 'going', 'bitter', 'divorce', 'secluded', 'weekend', 'cabin', 'way', 'boondocks', 'escape', 'pain', 'writing', 'sanity', 'are', 'suffering', 'result', 'turn', 'events', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'John', 'Shooter', 'played', 'rather', 'well', 'John', 'Turturro', 'up', 'door', 'pointing', 'accusing', 'finger', 'proclaiming', 'stole', 'story', 'Rainey', 'shocked', 'flabbergasted', 'chaos', 'soon', 'said', 'dramatization', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'half-bad', 'actually', '*enjoyed*', 'hearing', 'actors', 'speak', 'Stephen', 'King', 'dialogue', 'change', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ball', 'always', 'John', 'Turturro', 'perfectly', 'put', 'forth', 'subdued', 'menace', 'John', 'Shooter', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'satisfactory.There', 'were', 'course', 'usual', 'script', 'difficulties', 'had', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'book', 'Mort', 'pet', 'cat', 'movie', 'dog', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'harder', 'train', 'cat', 'do', 'things', 'were', 'required', 'story', 'Also', 'ending', 'different', 'Usually', 'sort', 'thing', 'just', 'off', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'struck', 'dumb', 'guess', 'picked', 'better', 'ending', 'Depp', 'character', 'sort', 'justifies', 'final', 'monologue', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'decide', 'like', 'not', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'one', 'tenth', 'as', 'frustrating', 'ending', 'was', 'expecting', 'always', 'strongly', 'urge', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'flick', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'collection', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'watching', 'think', 'impact', 'inside', 'jokes', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'greater', 'affect', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'did']",N/A

821136,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002234LS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","Johnny Depp and John Turturro are in the filmed version of Stephen King novella, directed by prolific screenwriter David Koepp ('Panic Room' and many, many others).  The unexpected combination of them delivers to a certain degree -- like 3.5 points out of 5 -- but can never really deceive the eye of the viewers who have seen this type of thriller before.In fact, the greatest part of 'Secret Window' is Johnny Depp's skilled acting as popular writer named Rainey.  One day, while he is living in a remote woodland cabin, trying to write something, a spooky-looking guy with a heavy accent knocks the door, claiming 'You stole my story.'  When this guy, a Mr. Shooter, is played by excellent John Turturro, you know this guy can be very creepy.  And to us avid movie fans, his mannerism is very interesting to see.But things get worse when Rainey doesn't take him seriously, for apparently this creepy guy's intention seems more than you can take care of, acting like a stalker.  And Rainey has another thing to take care of, like the divorce with his  wife (Maria Bello), or still-ongoing enmity with her new boy-friend (Timothy Hutton).  And the private detective (Charles S. Dutton) is not helpful very much.The film tries to make the story more and more intense as it goes on, driving the character of Rainey into the metally confusing zone.  But what is most regrettable is, like I said before, everything looks utterly signposted for the viewers accustomed to this genre.  In the first place, the script lacks the central theme that should attract us -- if someone claims you stole a story, all you should do is easy: call your laywer, or disprove the claim by showing the proof, while Rainey is very, very slow to do this.  Moreover, the ending (which is not pleasant to see, I am afraid) wants to be a big surprise while WE KNOW there's gonna be a big surprise, which means, it is not.  In fact, the opening camera that quietly introduces us to the protagonist lying on the couch (and the camera moves into the reflection of the mirror, and stays in there) is more impressive than the flat ending itself.Still Johnny Depp is an actor not to be missed, and Turturro too, and Depp's quirky performance (with many detailed small actions) is very entertaining in its own way.  Though Philip Glass's name gives 'class' to this Stephen King film, it is Depp who virtually raised the production a few notches higher than other films based on King.Enjoy the film as it is; it's a so-so thriller and nothing but that.

He had seen the movie several weeks before I did and recommended that I see it if I got the chance.  So, when the film came to the local budget cinema, I made a point to watch it.  The film was everything I thought it would be and nothing more.The story itself is pretty average.  Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who is in the process of getting a divorce from his wife.  He loves his wife very much and really doesn't want the divorce, but she has been pressing the matter for sometime. In the meantime, Rainey has moved out of their home and is living in their summer cabin. He's been trying to finish his new book.  Unexpectedly a strange man wearing a wide-brimmed black hat shows up at his door.  The strange man calls himself John Shooter (John Turturro) and claims that Rainey stole a story from him several years ago.  Shooter wants Rainey to correct the mistake by rewriting the ending to the story.  Rainey claims that he wrote his story several years before Shooter wrote his.  Shooter gives Rainey three days to prove it to him and to show that he means business, Shooter kills Rainey's dog late at night. Thus, a game of cat and mouse begins.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't really go anywhere. The suspense doesn't build up in the right way and the ending of the movie leaves the audience longing for something more.The acting in the movie is rather well done, however. Johnny Depp is almost always entertaining to watch and John Tuturro stands his ground well.  Turturro's silent, yet steady prescence serves as the perfect foil to Depp's frantic and exaggerated style.Overall, the film wasn't all that bad and had some good acting, but the plot left something to be desired. SECRET WINDOW reminded me of another movie based upon a Stephen King story: THE DARK HALF.

Marshall,"[1, 3]","Interesting......with a bit of a twist to keep it so!Johnny Depp plays a depressed writer living alone in a cabin while going through a divorce due to his wife's affair. Depp is very convincing as the loner in the wilderness, taking days to sleep and walking about in a tattered robe, while letting his hair go wild. His character is completely likable and throughout the film you somehow hope for a better existence for this down on his luck guy. He crosses paths with a few eerie characters played by John Turturro and Timothy Hutton, both actors effective in their individual roles as well.I was surprised to find out that this film is an adaptation of something Stephen King wrote because usually I find the King books un-complimented by their movie versions. However I found this film to be along the lines of something Hitchcock would have mastered. The story is interesting and the movie moves along most of the time without much effort.

In this case, style triumphs over substance as Koepp and his collaborators invest &quot;Secret Window&quot; with enough visual invention for three movies.The film looks marvelous on DVD. The various featurettes about the making of the movie includes some of the previsualization footage allowing you to see how Koepp's carefully orchestrated direction adds to the tension of the film. We also get to see some of the footage that Depp shot with rehearsal footage, outtakes, and actual footage that was redubbed. Why is that important? Well Depp breaks into impersonation mode doing Brando, DeNiro and a whole host of other actors as he works his way through the character. The commentary track by Koepp is particularly revealing as he discusses why he chose not to go with the alternate ending (it's included as an extra) and some of the visualization choices he made as a director and writer.While &quot;Secret Window&quot; comes across as a tad predictable, the exceptional performances from the entire cast and the directing choices Koepp makes certainly keeps this glimpse into someone else's secret window.

821143,A1BS8YM712C0VJ,B0002234LS,Will Culp,"[1, 1]","Secret Window(2003)If you happen to be one of Stephen King's &quot;Constant Readers&quot;, good adaptations of his novels/short stories come around once in a blue moon. Fans fondly remember movies such as &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, but after that things got more than a little mediocre, with &quot;Pet Semetary&quot; and &quot;The Dark Half&quot; being the only movies watchable. &quot;Secret Window&quot; was brought to the big screen by writer/director David Koepp, and he based his movie on Stephen King's Novella 'Secret Window, Secret Garden', which can be found in the book 'Four Past Midnight'. After Koepp drafted the Screenplay for &quot;Secret Window&quot;, he hired uber-popular actor Johnny Depp as the main character(Mort Rainey), and Timothy Dalton, who starred in 'The Dark Half' movie. So in the world of King-dom, does &quot;Secret Window&quot; stand as a triumphant adaptation, or a miserable failure? Read on to find out...Plot-Mort Rainey is an accomplished novelist working on a brand new novel when an unexpected knock at the door changes his life forever. A man named Jack Shooter(Played by John Turturro) claims that Rainey stole the story he wrote 7 years ago. Rainey is disbelieveing at first, but after reading Shooter's manuscript, he realizes his story and Shooter's are exactly the same, and he can't believe that Shooter is accusing HIM! As Shooter grows more impatient with Rainey's inability to admit that &quot;he stole his story&quot;, Shooter begins wreaking havoc on Rainey's life, first killing his dog, to burning down his ex-wife's house, and finally resorts to murdering to get Rainey's attention. Mort Rainey is soon thrust into his own story, and only the ending can solve his mystery......Acting/Directing/Etc.-&quot;Secret Window&quot; definitely benifits from the cast, as Johnny Depp('The Pirates of the Carribean', 'Edward Scissorhands') and John Turturro('The Green Mile', 'O Brother Where Art Thou?') are both magnificent actors, and fortuneatly the have the most important roles in the film. Johnny Depp, much like his role in 'The Pirates of the Carribean' as Captain Jack Sparrow, seems distracted, sleepy, lazy, and disillusioned, and Depp does a magnificent job playing the washed-up writer. Turturro plays Jack Shooter, the angry writer from Mississippi with an unmistakeable southern drawl, and Turturro does a good job playing the &quot;country hick&quot;, and his accent is believable at the same time. David Koepp does a decent job directing, while I had no problems with it, there wasn't anything that distinguishes &quot;Secret Window&quot; from any other movie in terms of directing. What really hurts 'Secret Window' is how the screenplay seems to drag along, and what little action there is turns out to be a tad mellow and disappointing, and the big &quot;showdown&quot; you might be expecting never happens. For that, &quot;Secret Window&quot;, while being a Horror movie, isn't scary AT ALL, and turns out being much more of a drama with a disturbing ending if you ask me. Unlike critics of &quot;Secret Window&quot; I don't think you will figure out the plot twist unless you have read the books, as it isn't easy to decipher otherwise.Opinion-Overall, &quot;Secret Window&quot; is a good adaptation of the novel, but I feel that the plot just simply drags on in many places, and when the viewer finally gets to the climax, it's nothing special. If you plan on buying &quot;Secret Window&quot; because you want a &quot;scary&quot; movie, I feel you may be more than a little disappointed. In the end, &quot;Secret Window&quot; is worth a rent, but not worth spending more than $10.00's of your hard earned cash.RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF STEPHEN KING, STEPHEN KING MOVIES, AND JOHNNY DEPP. DON'T COME IN EXPECTING A HORROR MOVIE, MORE OF A DRAMA!

However, we have all seen cases where this is not the case.  Thankfully, after the first scene of the film, where Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) opens the door to find John Shooter (John Turturro) drawling his iconic ""you stole mah story"", one can tell that this one was made correctly.For a basic plot summary, ""Secret Window"" sees Rainey, a once-successful writer now struggling with the bottle and loneliness after divorcing wife Amy (Maria Bello), accused of plagiarism by Mr. Shooter, who goes on to torment the people involved in Rainey's life as Rainey himself tries to set the record straight.At its simplest common denominator, this is a great film because King is an incredible storyteller.  This is such a compelling & mysterious tale that one cannot helped but be sucked into the many different angles of the rich plotline.  Kudos must be given to director David Koepp for making sure all those elements are portrayed as well on the screen as they were on the printed page.The acting is also top-notch in this film, with Rainey & Bello having great chemistry as a divorcing couple trying to figure out what the heck is happening to each other.  Turturro, however, almost completely steals the show with his ""Shooter"" performance, creating one of the creepier characters ever to appear on film.Overall, then, ""Secret Window"" is an all-time great movie for fans of mystery & psychological thrillers.
