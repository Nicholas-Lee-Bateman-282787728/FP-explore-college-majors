I will echo an earlier comment by a reviewer who stated he or she had been looking for this film for a long time.  Indeed confirms what I have believed about  love for so long.  Watching this film was an emotional catharsis for me.  Not in a long long time have I been so emotionally involved in a film from  beginning to end.  The acting, directing, SCENERY!-everything works like a  charm.  If you're a romantic like me this is the film for you.  You'll be  watching it over and over again for years to come.

The other one percent is travelogue, and the scenes of Jerusalem, Paris and Dover add to the movie.A number of movies have tackled the love-of-one's-life phenomenon, but the others used some kind of story to try to get the feeling across.  This movie merely talks about it.The lead actress was actively off-putting.  I didn't find her whiney, just not particularly likeable, and certainly not attractive.  In any love story, the audience (or at least half of it) has to fall in love with the female lead.  The other half has to go for the male lead.

She is whiny and annoying, and doesn't have the kind of compelling presence the part requires. But then again, she is director Henry Jaglom's wife, so I guess she was a shoo-in!I liked how the characters had to wrestle with their situation - while their attraction was immediate and undeniable, their loyalty to their existing relationships caused them to wrestle with their consciences and really delve into the importance of love, fate and personal fulfillment.I had not seen Dillane's work before seeing this film, but have since found his acting to be of consistently high caliber.  He does not look like a traditional leading man, but has a magnetic, thoughtful quality that is quite compelling.Deja Vu is an interesting, quirky film, that could have been truly memorable with a different lead actress, some script tightening (hearing the actors exclaim &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; over and over becomes really grating after a while)and editing, but it is still an enjoyable film that is well worth seeing.",4,Dillane makes it all worthwhile,1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1276,"['Deja', 'Vu', 'intriguing', 'film', 'flawed', 'worth', 'seeing', 'chiefly', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'original', 'compelling', 'premise', 'story.Unfortunately', 'lead', 'actress', 'Victoria', 'Foyt', 'brought', 'film', 'down', 'notch', 'eyes', 'whiny', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'compelling', 'presence', 'part', 'then', 'again', 'director', 'Henry', 'Jaglom', 'wife', 'guess', 'was', 'shoo-in', 'liked', 'how', 'characters', 'had', 'wrestle', 'situation', 'attraction', 'was', 'immediate', 'undeniable', 'loyalty', 'existing', 'relationships', 'caused', 'wrestle', 'consciences', 'really', 'delve', 'importance', 'love', 'fate', 'personal', 'fulfillment.I', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Dillane', 'work', 'before', 'seeing', 'film', 'have', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'consistently', 'high', 'caliber', 'not', 'look', 'traditional', 'leading', 'man', 'magnetic', 'thoughtful', 'quality', 'quite', 'compelling.Deja', 'Vu', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'memorable', 'different', 'lead', 'actress', 'script', 'tightening', 'hearing', 'actors', 'exclaim', 'quot', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'quot', 'becomes', 'really', 'grating', 'while', 'editing', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",Deja Vu VHS

But no one here seems to have mentioned and reviewed the special commentary by Henry Jaglom (Director)and Victoria Foyt (star actress) in the DVD. That is worth seeing because it is like having a second, complete film in itself.Clearly, Jaglom and Foyt are very much in love, and to some extent ""Deja Vu"" is about them. At one point, Jaglom tells how he first met Foyt -- on the telephone -- and although each had other commitments and responsibilties, each of them realized the other to be the love of their lives. But most of the commentary was a lovingly executed version of artistic arguing about how the film was made and the concepts in it. I've been a serious film buff for years, yet learned a lot about acting and filmmaking from the commentary.In the middle Henry asks Victoria does she think someone is watching the commentary before having seen the movie. Then he scolds the audience for this and insists they STOP immediately and see the the movie first.Both the movie and commentary are fantastic, great entertainment (and even -- God forbid -- educational). The DVD goes beyond just the film ""Deja Vu"" and is worth buying just for the commentary.",5,WHAT ABOUT THE SPECIAL COMMENTARY?,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,1240,"['many', 'reasons', 'liked', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'many', 'appear', 'other', 'reviews', 'one', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'reviewed', 'special', 'commentary', 'Henry', 'Jaglom', 'Director', 'Victoria', 'Foyt', 'star', 'actress', 'DVD', 'worth', 'seeing', 'having', 'second', 'complete', 'film', 'itself.Clearly', 'Jaglom', 'Foyt', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'extent', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'one', 'point', 'Jaglom', 'how', 'first', 'met', 'Foyt', 'telephone', 'had', 'other', 'commitments', 'responsibilties', 'realized', 'other', 'be', 'love', 'lives', 'most', 'commentary', 'was', 'lovingly', 'executed', 'version', 'artistic', 'arguing', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'concepts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'serious', 'film', 'buff', 'years', 'yet', 'learned', 'lot', 'acting', 'filmmaking', 'commentary.In', 'middle', 'Henry', 'Victoria', 'think', 'someone', 'watching', 'commentary', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'Then', 'audience', 'STOP', 'immediately', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'commentary', 'are', 'fantastic', 'great', 'entertainment', 'even', 'God', 'forbid', 'educational', 'DVD', 'just', 'film', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'commentary']",Deja Vu VHS

514597,ATXL536YX71TR,B00002E240,"KerrLines ""&#34;Movies,Music,Theatre&#34;""","[6, 6]","Film director Henry Jaglom has been hailed by critics as ""the definitive Hollywood filmmaker"".Jaglom and his real-life  actress/wife ,Victoria Foyt, once again team up to bring a startling and originally scripted and crafted screenplay to the screen.Anyone familiar with the Jaglom/Foyt team (LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS) will again recognize the earmarks of their work which always tend towards multiple characters intertwined in almost ""reality-like"" situations and conversations making the viewer one  with the characters as  an invisible third party to the entire scene-cinema verite at it's best.This DEJA VU,filmed in 1998,and not to be confused with three other films bearing the same title,is romantic,magical,mysterious and down right philosophical bordering on the existential!The term DEJA VU simply means ""the feeling that one has experienced something or someone before exactly as it is being presently experienced"".When deja vu is experienced it can startle,baffle and even ""creep you out"",but the fact that it is a phenonenon that is worldwide is undeniable.Jaglom and Foyt's tale of ""deja vu"" takes a far more indepth and more philosophical road than the other films on this phenomenon as it asks the question, ""If two people experience the undeniable 'pulling together' that cause them both feel that they are indelibly linked somehow/someway, then do they act upon it in spite of life choices already made?"" This deliberately paced,well-acted and very intense dialogue-heavy script is a real find for lovers of the ""intimate"" film. This is a film,not so much of action, but of words skillfully set and spoken.Victoria Foyt and Stephen Dillane play the ""haven't we met before"" woman and man,Dana and Sean.The acting is so natural and engaging that the viewer is simply carried along in a very natural drift.The supporting characters played by Vanessa Redgrave,Rachel Kempson (Redgrave's real-life mother),Anna Massey (brilliant!),Noel Harrison and others make for a real two hour treat!.The music choices of Franz Schubert's SERENADE and the nostalgic WW2 love song WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER are constantly interlaced throughout this film which was shot in Paris,London,Los Angeles and Jerusalem.I absolutely refuse to give any plot away,because to do so would destroy the impact and the surprise  that each subtle scene contains.(I hope this entices you!)This film will probably not interest people who want ""action/entertainment"".This is a character study of one of the highest degrees that may well interest patrons of ""live"" theatre.The film poses alot of questions and asks alot of the viewer to think about the choices that we make,have made or maybe should have made. As a person, myself ,who has experienced and acted upon an undeniable ""deja vu"" several years back, I can only say that for me it only confirmed the truth of what Jaglom and Foyt postulate...and I am happy..very happy for having made that decision.

514598,AB4MB7S796GNJ,B00002E240,Larkenfield,"[15, 17]","I love this film and have seen it many times. It has lines in it I've never heard before in any love story, though I've had this wonderful soul-mate experience myself and know the words by heart. It's the language of the soul that's captured here, and I think the characters reflect this soul-mate understanding perfectly, at least in the major love scenes between the lovely Victoria Foyt and the excellent Stephen Dillane. This makes it difficult for me to imagine anyone else in the lead role other than Ms. Foyt.In fact, the movie would never have come into being without her and she deserves ample credit: she wrote it with her husband, who happens to be the love of her life, and vice versa, if their commentary is to be believed in the special features section... The relationship between Foyt and Jaglom was fated, as she was married to someone else at the time she met him, and consequently they both sacrificed everything to be together - and so far, it's worked out personally and creatively for both of them, including their two young and lovely children. Now what other actress could have stepped in and played her role with more insight, conviction and understanding? Keira Knightley? Hmmm.What some viewers lament as her constant ""whining,"" I see as a reflection of the type of woman she is: feminine, vulnerable, emotional, and deeply upset and confused by this sudden turn of events with someone from out of the blue just when her conventional life was about to fall into place with her fiance. She's shaken by this and it comes out in her voice. What's happening to her is beyond her understanding at the time.Speaking as a man, I love Victoria Foyt's maturity, being an older but hardly an old woman, and her classic beauty, and I particularly love her words in her last major love scene with her soul-mate. (I won't spoil the beautiful exchange by revealing it here.) For what I look for in a woman, she has feminine appeal in the way she's in conflict with herself, and she has feminine appeal in her emotionally vulnerability and the way she expresses herself when she surrenders to her lover and decides to give into having a life with him. I like it, I like it, I like it, because she's lived enough to have some depth of feeling, and appreciates it, because it comes later in life, though that's not explicitly stated in the movie. She also knows how to kiss and use her hands to express her emotions, which I love in a woman. I would find it hard to throw a woman of this classic beauty and emotional vulnerabity out of bed should I ever be lucky enough to have this soul-mate experience again.This romantic ""fantasy"" is perhaps my favorite movie about fate, destiny and life's unexpected possibilities - ones that keep you hanging onto life and expecting the next great adventure right around the corner, including non-romantic ones. Whether it's a perfect movie or not is a moot point for me because what movie could ever exactly capture the real thing?... that special something so overpowering in its magnetic attraction between two people that they can only say `yes' to it no matter whatever else is happening in their lives. While it can turn lives upside down, and sometimes ends up being only an illusion, it may be the ultimate act of self-discovery that was part of their life's plan from the beginning, and this movie explores this gossamer line between fantasy and reality.I think the movie may also have another message:  that sometimes you have to say 'no' to someone when you painfully realize that person isn't right for you, and only then is there room for the person you were destined to be with.",5,We should all be so lucky,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3641,"['love', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'love', 'story', ""'ve"", 'had', 'wonderful', 'soul-mate', 'experience', 'know', 'words', 'heart', 'language', 'soul', 'captured', 'here', 'think', 'characters', 'reflect', 'soul-mate', 'understanding', 'perfectly', 'least', 'major', 'love', 'scenes', 'lovely', 'Victoria', 'Foyt', 'excellent', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'lead', 'role', 'other', 'Ms.', 'Foyt.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'being', 'ample', 'credit', 'wrote', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'life', 'vice', 'versa', 'commentary', 'be', 'believed', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'relationship', 'Foyt', 'Jaglom', 'was', 'fated', 'was', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'time', 'met', 'consequently', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'be', 'together', 'so', 'far', 'worked', 'out', 'personally', 'creatively', 'including', 'two', 'young', 'lovely', 'children', 'Now', 'what', 'other', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'stepped', 'played', 'role', 'more', 'insight', 'conviction', 'understanding', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Hmmm.What', 'viewers', 'lament', 'constant', 'whining', 'see', 'reflection', 'type', 'woman', 'feminine', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'deeply', 'upset', 'confused', 'sudden', 'turn', 'events', 'someone', 'blue', 'just', 'when', 'conventional', 'life', 'was', 'fall', 'place', 'fiance', 'shaken', 'out', 'voice', 'What', 'happening', 'understanding', 'time.Speaking', 'man', 'love', 'Victoria', 'Foyt', 'maturity', 'being', 'older', 'hardly', 'old', 'woman', 'classic', 'beauty', 'particularly', 'love', 'words', 'last', 'major', 'love', 'scene', 'soul-mate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'beautiful', 'exchange', 'revealing', 'here', 'what', 'look', 'woman', 'feminine', 'appeal', 'way', 'conflict', 'herself', 'feminine', 'appeal', 'emotionally', 'vulnerability', 'way', 'when', 'lover', 'decides', 'give', 'having', 'life', 'like', 'like', 'lived', 'enough', 'have', 'depth', 'feeling', 'later', 'life', 'not', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'kiss', 'use', 'hands', 'express', 'emotions', 'love', 'woman', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'throw', 'woman', 'classic', 'beauty', 'emotional', 'vulnerabity', 'bed', 'should', 'ever', 'be', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'soul-mate', 'experience', 'again.This', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'movie', 'fate', 'destiny', 'life', 'unexpected', 'possibilities', 'ones', 'keep', 'hanging', 'life', 'expecting', 'next', 'great', 'adventure', 'right', 'corner', 'including', 'non-romantic', 'ones', 'perfect', 'movie', 'not', 'moot', 'point', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'exactly', 'capture', 'real', 'thing', 'special', 'something', 'so', 'overpowering', 'magnetic', 'attraction', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'yes', 'matter', 'else', 'happening', 'lives', 'can', 'turn', 'lives', 'upside', 'down', 'sometimes', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'illusion', 'may', 'be', 'ultimate', 'act', 'self-discovery', 'was', 'part', 'life', 'plan', 'beginning', 'movie', 'gossamer', 'line', 'fantasy', 'reality.I', 'think', 'movie', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'message', 'sometimes', 'have', 'say', ""'no"", 'someone', 'when', 'painfully', 'realize', 'person', ""n't"", 'right', 'only', 'then', 'there', 'room', 'person', 'were', 'destined', 'be']",Deja Vu VHS

514602,A3I81NDLJKJ7E5,B00002E240,Roger O. Thornhill,"[2, 2]","Other reviewers have said very well why this is so superb and so rare, but there are a couple of points they didn't seem to touch on. (Spoiler alerts.) One is that the main couple would never have met if that earlier couple hadn't made the ""wrong"" decision and then had children -- a strange thought. It's as if fate had to miss its mark in order to hit a better one a generation later; or maybe the moral is that that which we can resist can't quite be fate? The other weird point is that I don't buy part of the plotline and yet I love this movie unreservedly (and while watching it I'm completely in love with Victoria Foyt, unlike some of the reviewers whose tastes leave me stupified). I can't really buy that the woman whom Victoria encounters at the beginning has been dead for years, or that a ghost can give a lovely pin to a real person, who can then lose it and get it back. But I guess, because we invest in these scenes before we know the whole truth, somehow by the time we realize what we've accepted, it's okay?Anyway, I think Ms Foyt's performance is mesmerizing and amazingly believable, and that she is a rock star in looks and charisma. I find Mr Dillane's performance a tad too mild, though charming, and he seems not quite to match the sexual dimension that Ms Foyt projects... but these are minor quibbles. The scene where they run into each other outside the London house and are appalled to learn of each other's attachments is played partly for laughs but is so natural, so human, that it is one of my favorite scenes in all the movies. I also like that the movie pulls no punches and dodges no issues: we get to see both people go through the awful business of breaking up and trying to explain to their mates: the messiness of human life is not understated. The slight hint that the two dumped spouses might be good together is another hilariously ironic touch (are they starting to flirt?).This is a gem, one of the best studies ever of the meaning of compatibility (along with Kissing a Fool), and don't let anyone tell you different.",5,twists of fate,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,2064,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'so', 'superb', 'so', 'rare', 'are', 'couple', 'points', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'touch', 'Spoiler', 'alerts', 'One', 'main', 'couple', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'met', 'earlier', 'couple', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'wrong', 'decision', 'then', 'had', 'children', 'strange', 'thought', 'fate', 'had', 'miss', 'mark', 'order', 'hit', 'better', 'one', 'generation', 'later', 'maybe', 'moral', 'can', 'resist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'be', 'fate', 'other', 'weird', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'part', 'plotline', 'yet', 'love', 'movie', 'unreservedly', 'watching', ""'m"", 'completely', 'love', 'Victoria', 'Foyt', 'reviewers', 'tastes', 'leave', 'stupified', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'woman', 'whom', 'Victoria', 'beginning', 'been', 'dead', 'years', 'ghost', 'can', 'give', 'lovely', 'pin', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'then', 'lose', 'get', 'back', 'guess', 'invest', 'scenes', 'know', 'whole', 'truth', 'somehow', 'time', 'realize', 'what', ""'ve"", 'accepted', 'okay', 'Anyway', 'think', 'Ms', 'Foyt', 'performance', 'mesmerizing', 'amazingly', 'believable', 'rock', 'star', 'looks', 'charisma', 'find', 'Mr', 'Dillane', 'performance', 'tad', 'too', 'mild', 'charming', 'not', 'quite', 'match', 'sexual', 'dimension', 'Ms', 'Foyt', 'projects', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'scene', 'where', 'run', 'other', 'London', 'house', 'are', 'appalled', 'learn', 'other', 'attachments', 'played', 'partly', 'laughs', 'so', 'natural', 'so', 'human', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movies', 'also', 'movie', 'punches', 'issues', 'get', 'see', 'people', 'go', 'awful', 'business', 'breaking', 'up', 'trying', 'explain', 'mates', 'messiness', 'human', 'life', 'not', 'understated', 'slight', 'hint', 'two', 'dumped', 'spouses', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'together', 'hilariously', 'ironic', 'touch', 'are', 'starting', 'flirt', '.This', 'gem', 'one', 'best', 'studies', 'ever', 'meaning', 'compatibility', 'Kissing', 'Fool', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'different']",Deja Vu VHS

Is love merely a product of genetic attraction or blind chance? Jaglom accepts the idea of ""soul mate"" as a premise, indulges in a little mysticism, effectively utilizes an old standard (The White Cliffs of Dover) dripping with nostalgia, and in the process delivers a film that will be revered by those who are believers and reviled by those who remain skeptics. ""Paris? How cliche!"" or ""Paris because it had to be!""  Dana and Sean are soulmates but Dana is engaged to Alex and Sean married to Claire. Both relationships could be described as happily content,  but once Dana and Sean discover each other, being content suddenly seems empty. And so they are confronted with a dilemma: seize the day or turn away. In the film Citizen Kane, a reporter searching for the significance of ""Rosebud"" to a man that had everything is told thus: ""One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since, that I haven't thought of that girl."" And this coming from an old man! Jaglom asks the question, ""What if that girl was that boy's soulmate?""
