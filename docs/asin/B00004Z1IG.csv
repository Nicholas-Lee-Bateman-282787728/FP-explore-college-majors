(1964), Viewed: 1/14, Rate: 71/14: The most striking aspect of Seven Up! is how well spoken the 7 year olds were. They sound so much better than any ordinary kid in high school. Of course, my low rating for the film is attributed to a couple of factors. First, the filmmakers do not disclose what methodologies were used to pick the children nor the type of random sampling. Is this really a representation of the children of Britain? I'm not told of it. Second, the things the children say come fairly predictable. It's a bit boring to listen to. The behaviors are also predictable as well, but it's amusing that they were allowed to fight like that back then. However, I like the camera work, and it's very avant-garde. All in all, Seven Up! is the beginning of my journey into the Up Series, and I am looking forward to it.7 Plus Seven (1970), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 46/14: Three salient points come to my mind while watching 7 Plus Seven: how depressed they look, how full of themselves they sound, and how some of them refuse to look directly towards the camera. I was once 14, but I was never any of that nor did I see the behaviors in my peers. So, it must be England after all? At least Apted does the smart thing: constantly remind the audience who's who when retrospectively comparing the children's faces at age 7. All in all, hopefully it gets better in the next installment.21 Up (1977), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 36/14: 21 Up is more of the same as 7 Plus Seven: lots of repeated footage, mundane interviews, and dearth of profound insights. Among the interviewees, I found Bruce Balden's to be the most bizarre and the most awkward of them all. When Symon was asked for his strengths and weaknesses, I wish that he responded point blank, ""Well, I am dumb."" Meanwhile, I suspect a few of the others possess drug problems which will probably be a revelation in the later installments. Because a great many of them have poor diets, their skin appearance and hair look real bad and/or have lost the luster. The real criticism I have about the Up Series is that the audience only gets to see a snapshot of the interviewees' frames of mind at that particular time, but there is zero explanation of why or how they came as who they are throughout the seven years. If one knows, he can thoroughly understand the shaping. Another criticism of them is that I, just like the last installment, have no clue what the hell the interviewees are talking about. The three preppy boys are quite full of themselves and ride on a parade of conceit. Their vocabulary is extremely limited and repeatedly littered with ""sort of,"" ""quite,"" ""really,"" and ""anyway."" Finally, notice how each installment ends with ""Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man. This has been a glimpse of Britain's future."" I am going to paraphrase this as ""Give me a happy child until he is seven and I will give you the depressed (or f***ed up) man. This has been a glimpse of Britain's bleak future."" I honestly think all of that have a lot to do with living in England.21 Up (1984), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 96/14: 28 Up is a dramatic improvement over the last two installments. It's refreshing to see how much most of them have grown up and fully matured. However, the three snotty prep boys are still full of themselves. Not much to my surprise, two of them (oh come on, John...I wanted to hear your superior pearls of flaunty wisdom about a wealth of topics) have refused to appear for the show. Probably I identify with Neil the most and understand his lack of motivation in life; to me, it's due to his over-analysis about life when in fact he is an intelligent person and is highly capable of success if he can put his mind to it. That's why, in contrast, Tony, Symon, and Paul were able to lead fulfilling lives because they didn't think too much on a daily basis. During the interview with Symon, I was annoyed with the interviewer's prodding through questions because it was getting clear that he found Symon's perspective of life disappointing. The joint interview with the three women, who look considerably aged by at least fifteen years, is a bit strange to listen to; I wonder if there is a hidden, subtle message being conveyed across or maybe they want to explicitly say, ""Our lives suck."" What's nice about this installment, for a change, is that instead of lots of repeated footage, there are old footage that were previously unseen.35 Up (1991), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 36/14: Oh, how tired I am of the repeated footage that is, I might say, overwhelming. To use Symon's words, my mind is going dead. Already, I can safely say that I've memorized each of the participants' quotes when they were 7, 14, 21, and 28. If I hear ""greens"" one more time, I'll go crazy. Ah, John...how nice: he decided to be the shameless humanitarian by appearing on 35 Up after spurning the chance to show his smug face in the last installment, so he can bring attention to the plight of Bulgaria. Hence, is this a ploy for John to be given a lordship or be knighted by the Queen? As for everybody else, save for Neil, they have nicely immersed into plastic, mundane, and positively boring lifestyles. At this point, I feel ready to give up on the show because there is really nothing much to learn about anymore.42 Up (1998), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Well, there is absolutely nothing new going on with most of the participants. The big reason why is that everybody is very reserved about themselves and doesn't see the need to reveal anything much, apart from the bland gist, to the public. But at least, good going for Bruce and Neil. They really did turn out well. Bruce is truly a role model and an example for all. Of course, as expected, John is too good of an aristocrat to appear in this installment. I truly treasure his quiet arrogance. Andrew finally shows his true colors, has come to a full circle, and is what I thought he was from the get go. All in all, 42 Up is a real waste of my time.49 Up (2005), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Once again, nothing new. Everybody is going through the motions, staying guarded as usual, and have become full-fledged stiffs. The interview with Jackie, a name I hadn't bothered knowing until now, is awkward to listen to. John comes back and is still the same seven year old twit. Suzy is one of the few that I haven't bothered commenting in the past reviews because I knew nothing was going to be different about her; in fact, her interview should be limited to 30 seconds since what's there to talk about? The strangest thing happened in this installment is that she got a bit more animated than usual about how she had these hurt feelings stirred up based on her past. Well, all I can say is, ""What?"" I watched each of the installments: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and now 49. And she was monotonously the same in every single one of them; in other words, we don't know anything at all about her except she was born into money, has a husband named Rupert, and has three children. All in all, 49 Up bored me to tears.56 Up (2012), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Again, the same as usual. After surviving 8 installments of the Up Series, I consider the experiment a failure. Sure, the concept is nice and should have worked out well, but the execution of it is incredibly poor. The time invested into this series is also incredible; this is literally 49 years in the making and continuing. Why did it fail? Because Michael Apted as the interviewer is the epitome of this. He doesn't ask the right questions, doesn't present a complete portrayal of the participants, and doesn't know how to interview properly. After 49 years, I honestly don't know these people. Why did I continue with the installments despite the negatives? It's the changes of their facial expressions which I found the most interesting. All in all, I don't care about the show anymore.",1,Irrelevant.,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,8035,"['***Note***', 'are', 'desperate', 'search', 'English', 'subtitles', 'whole', 'Up', 'Series', 'can',

He has been back to interview them every seven years.  The subjects are 42 years old in this film.This is perhaps the most fascinating and poignant documentary series I have ever seen and am likely to see.  As you watch this film and see the drama of lives unfold well into middle age, you can't help but to be in awe.  This film forces you to ponder on your own life and ask yourself questions.  What have we been put on this earth for and what is the true meaning of life?Without giving away the whole film, I will say that a few changes have taken place in peoples lives and most of them have progressed rather nicely since 35 Up. One of the subjects got divorced but is happily remarried at 42.  Another subject was actually caught being unfaithful but was forgiven and is still married to the same person.  One of the subjects finally gets married at the age of 42, but has concerns about trying to start a family so late.  Some of the subjects who've been married for a long time talk about how hard marriage is.  Other subjects who have teenagers talk about how difficult they can be.  None of the subjects was incarcerated and none of them died yet.  I hate to break it to the Neil fans, but he is not doing anything all that big dispite the rumors.  Although he is still on welfare, he has managed to find some stability in his life and is keeping himself busy.

560864,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00004Z1IG,Westley,"[0, 0]","Michael Apted continues the superb ""7 Up"" series with this 1998 entry, featuring the ""kids"" now aged 42 years.  For those not familiar with the series, in 1964 the documentary team interviewed a set of 7 year old U.K. children; every 7 years, the participants are re-interviewed, and we get to see them age before our eyes.  The basic theme is based on the Jesuit motto, ""Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man.""  The children were from a variety of backgrounds, with the intent of examining how issues of class affected their options and choices over the years.I've watched the five prior documentaries, and it's amazing to see how the participants change or, in some cases, don't change over time.  As the participants enter middle age, most have married, some have divorced, and most have children.  They vary widely in terms of satisfaction with their lives and careers.  My opinions of the participants also changed with each entry; for example, working class Tony's ""hustle"" in early entries of the series was admirable to me, but by middle age, it seemed like boastfulness and led him to make some life mistakes.  On the other hand, spoiled Suzy becomes more likeable over time as she settles into being a mother and even starts to give back to her community.  (However, I admire all of the interviewees for being willing to open up their lives.)  Finally, there are a couple of unexpected events that happen, and Apted expertly edits the documentary to take full advantage of these twists.  Overall, ""42 Up"" is probably my favorite in the series, although it is sometimes the saddest and most bittersweet.Obviously, all documentaries are edited and tell their stories from a particular viewpoint.  Apted's focus on issues of class and choices sometimes annoys the participants.  However, overall, the series and ""42 Up"" specifically seem pretty even-handed.  If you haven't seen the earlier entries, you really could jump in here, as Apted includes enough material from earlier interviews for viewers to get the general idea of what each participant's life has been like.  However, to get the full impact, watch each of the earlier entries; the series is a bit repetitive at times, but well worth the time investment.",5,Into their 40s,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,2248,"['Michael', 'Apted', 'superb', '7', 'Up', 'series', '1998', 'entry', 'featuring', 'kids', 'now', '42', 'years', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', '1964', 'documentary', 'team', 'interviewed', 'set', '7', 'year', 'old', 'U.K.', 'children', '7', 'years', 'participants', 'are', 're-interviewed', 'get', 'see', 'age', 'eyes', 'basic', 'theme', 'based', 'Jesuit', 'motto', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'give', 'man', 'children', 'were', 'variety', 'backgrounds', 'intent', 'examining', 'how', 'issues', 'class', 'affected', 'options', 'choices', 'years.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'five', 'prior', 'documentaries', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'participants', 'change', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'time', 'participants', 'enter', 'middle', 'age', 'most', 'have', 'married', 'have', 'divorced', 'most', 'have', 'children', 'vary', 'widely', 'terms', 'satisfaction', 'lives', 'careers', 'opinions', 'participants', 'also', 'changed', 'entry', 'example', 'working', 'class', 'Tony', 'hustle', 'early', 'entries', 'series', 'was', 'admirable', 'middle', 'age', 'seemed', 'boastfulness', 'led', 'make', 'life', 'mistakes', 'other', 'hand', 'spoiled', 'Suzy', 'more', 'likeable', 'over', 'time', 'being', 'mother', 'even', 'starts', 'give', 'back', 'community', 'However', 'admire', 'interviewees', 'being', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'lives', 'Finally', 'are', 'couple', 'unexpected', 'events', 'happen', 'Apted', 'expertly', 'documentary', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'twists', 'Overall', '42', 'Up', 'probably', 'favorite', 'series', 'sometimes', 'saddest', 'most', 'bittersweet.Obviously', 'documentaries', 'are', 'edited', 'tell', 'stories', 'particular', 'viewpoint', 'Apted', 'focus', 'issues', 'class', 'choices', 'sometimes', 'participants', 'However', 'overall', 'series', '42', 'Up', 'specifically', 'seem', 'pretty', 'even-handed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'earlier', 'entries', 'really', 'could', 'jump', 'here', 'Apted', 'enough', 'material', 'earlier', 'interviews', 'viewers', 'get', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'participant', 'life', 'been', 'However', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'watch', 'earlier', 'entries', 'series', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'times', 'well', 'time', 'investment']",N/A
