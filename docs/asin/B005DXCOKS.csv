Reed ""roadrunner""","[7, 7]","It's probably safe to assume that anyone watching this BBC import miniseries has already seen -- and liked -- the classic ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" BBC's producers wisely recognized that the middle book of the series, ""The Honorable Schoolboy,"" wasn't going to translate to the screen, so they went straight from the first story of the trilogy to the last. Comparisons between Smiley and Tinker Tailor are inescapable and it speaks well of the sequel that it is a worthy successor to the original.""Smiley's People"" maintains some of the main strengths of the original: Le Carre's taut characterization and plotting; excellent scripting, casting, and behind-the-camera work; and, most of all, Sir Alec Guinness's magnificent portrayal of the brilliant but profoundly flawed Cold Warrior George Smiley.In some respects, this series follows the arc of the first one: George Smiley again is in a rather unhappy and not-entirely-voluntary retirement, having been removed once again following his brief return as head of the Circus. And, like the original story, he is called back in to take on a delicate errand for the Circus. The premise of this one is a little different -- he's brought in officially, by the current head of the Circus, rather than being somewhat offline, sponsored out-of-channels by ""Lacon and the Minister."" And the errand initially seems somewhat trivial: cleaning up the somewhat disorderly murder of a long-ago Circus informant. Obviously, the story quickly builds into something much deeper.The plot probably isn't quite as compelling as the original, but then, ""Tinker Tailor"" was one of the best miniseries ever. This one takes a little longer to develop and some of the ""visits"" Smiley makes in his investigation (the obligatory visit to former research chief Connie, for example) seem more like sentimental visits than necessary parts of the investigation. The cast of ""characters"" Smiley encounters also seems a lot more miscellaneous than in the former show and some of the subplots (the Russian woman in Paris, for example) aren't that compelling.But it's a great yarn and a very satisfying ending to George Smiley's Cold War.I missed the steady presence of Peter Guillam in this series. The replacement character was far weaker and seemed much less ""Guillam-ish"" (the original Peter seemed a little more like a soccer thug who went to college, while the new Guillam seemed more like a croquet player). But he didn't appear until the very end and didn't really matter to the story.This loss is more than made up for by the greatly enhanced role for Toby Esterhaze, one of the great character roles I've ever seen.It's a great Cold War spy yarn and a very satisfying end to this saga.",5,"Not quite as good as ""Tinker, Tailor,"" but still outstanding",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,2715,"['probably', 'safe', 'assume', 'anyone', 'watching', 'BBC', 'import', 'miniseries', 'already', 'seen', 'liked', 'classic', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'BBC', 'producers', 'wisely', 'recognized', 'middle', 'book', 'series', 'Honorable', 'Schoolboy', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'translate', 'screen', 'went', 'straight', 'first', 'story', 'trilogy', 'last', 'Comparisons', 'Smiley', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'are', 'inescapable', 'well', 'sequel', 'worthy', 'successor', 'original', 'Smiley', 'People', 'main', 'strengths', 'original', 'Le', 'Carre', 'taut', 'characterization', 'plotting', 'excellent', 'scripting', 'casting', 'behind-the-camera', 'work', 'most', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'magnificent', 'portrayal', 'brilliant', 'profoundly', 'flawed', 'Cold', 'Warrior', 'George', 'Smiley.In', 'respects', 'series', 'arc', 'first', 'one', 'George', 'Smiley', 'again', 'rather', 'unhappy', 'not-entirely-voluntary', 'retirement', 'having', 'been', 'removed', 'once', 'again', 'following', 'brief', 'return', 'head', 'Circus', 'original', 'story', 'called', 'back', 'take', 'delicate', 'errand', 'Circus', 'premise', 'one', 'little', 'different', 'brought', 'officially', 'current', 'head', 'Circus', 'rather', 'being', 'somewhat', 'offline', 'sponsored', 'out-of-channels', 'Lacon', 'Minister', 'errand', 'initially', 'somewhat', 'trivial', 'cleaning', 'up', 'somewhat', 'disorderly', 'murder', 'long-ago', 'Circus', 'informant', 'Obviously', 'story', 'quickly', 'something', 'much', 'deeper.The', 'plot', 'probably', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'compelling', 'original', 'then', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'one', 'little', 'longer', 'develop', 'visits', 'Smiley', 'investigation', 'obligatory', 'visit', 'former', 'research', 'chief', 'Connie', 'example', 'seem', 'more', 'sentimental', 'visits', 'necessary', 'parts', 'investigation', 'cast', 'characters', 'Smiley', 'encounters', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'miscellaneous', 'former', 'show', 'subplots', 'Russian', 'woman', 'Paris', 'example', 'are', ""n't"", 'compelling.But', 'great', 'yarn', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'George', 'Smiley', 'Cold', 'War.I', 'missed', 'steady', 'presence', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'series', 'replacement', 'character', 'was', 'far', 'weaker', 'seemed', 'much', 'less', 'Guillam-ish', 'original', 'Peter', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'soccer', 'thug', 'who', 'went', 'college', 'new', 'Guillam', 'seemed', 'more', 'croquet', 'player', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'very', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'story.This', 'loss', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'role', 'Toby', 'Esterhaze', 'one', 'great', 'character', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.It', 'great', 'Cold', 'War', 'spy', 'yarn', 'very', 'satisfying', 'end', 'saga']",N/A

He gave up on the character.The rest of the cast also deserves the highest praise. I particularly enjoyed Bernard Hepton (Toby). Beryl Reid made a more believable Connie than in the book.I saw the BBC version of Tinker, Tailor a few years ago. Last year I saw the movie with Gary Oldman and I thought that Oldman had an edge.

1456306,A3GJS1MZAIRP8L,B005DXCOKS,Y. Saavedra,"[0, 0]","It has been a long time since I have found such an enjoyable, rich, exquisitely complex story. Enjoyable in the fact that so much truth is expressed in the sorrow, insanity, paranoia and broken lives caused by insane, dominating leaders in any country.This story cannot be fully enjoyed unless one knows some of the important details of the book, which I have not read. Since many of the characters have more than one name and there are many important hidden meanings, one would miss too much of the depth of the characters, the history and the period.I would highly recommend one either read the book or a wiki synopsis then watch. The majority of the characters, if not all have so many layers. It also tells a story of an incredibly insane time - life in Stalin's Russia. With all the spying, invasion of privacy etc., people had to go through incredibly elaborate methods to communicate important information to each other.It's a story told from the point of view of a retired British spy named George Smiley and his journey in honoring the murder of a longtime Russian double agent, General Vladimir. Vladimir was attempting to get information to George about flushing out longtime enemy, KGB spymaster, Karla.It is such a richer story telling of the spy world than what is usually shown. Though lightly expressed, it does show the sorrows, paranoia, and insanity. Not to justify the need for spying as there are too many grotesque similarities in today's political world.There are so many incredible performances from many supporting actors, many who had just a few lines, a few scenes, but offer powerful and memorable performances: Otto Leipzig as Vladik Sheybal; Paul Herzberg as Villem Craven; Curd Jargens as General Vladimir. Each actors' performance moved the story ahead in powerful ways. Then there is Bill Paterson who plays the ""new"" cocky, rude, bad mannered, ""know it all"" spy, Lauder Strickland, I was repulsed. Bernard Hepton played Toby Esterhase in an enjoyable and enthusiastic way; Mario Adorf played Claus Kretzschmar brilliantly, warmly and sympathetically, though I hated the biased line written for him demeaning unions as the cause for Britain's monetary downfall. Joe Praml carried over his small role from Tinker Tailor brilliantly, keeping a strong presence in a role that had few lines and Jacques Maury played Sergei warmly.Spoiler alert: After all this build up about K.A.R.L.A., the ending was much more disappointing and anti-climatic then Tinker Tailor. It landed like a 20 ton lead balloon. After all the murders K.A.R.L.A. carried out on the Brit's and American spies from his moles, especially, the huge, long betrayal of Bill Hayden, when George gets K.A.R.L.A. to defect, promising that Brit taxpayers will pay for his daughter's hospitalization and care as well as his ~ as long as he cooperates with his interrogators, George arrives at the rendezvous point two hours early, because they ""owe it to"" K.A.R.L.A. and ""no one else is on his side."" W-H-A-T???? Did George suddenly forget the 300-400 or more spies K.A.R.L.A. had tortured and killed, often participating in the activities? Then K.A.R.L.A. finally crosses and George has to be strongly encouraged by Peter (wonderfully played by Michael Byrne) to look. W-H-A-T???? Then K.A.R.L.A. and George gaze into each others' eyes and K.A.R.L.A. drops the cigarette lighter, which George doesn't pick up. It's supposed to communicate some important insight, but the ending misses hugely and disappointingly. It still is well worth watching again and again for all the wonderful performances by the above mentioned supporting cast.There are a few big inconsistencies in the story, example, after George and Peter rescue Mrs. Ostrakova and are at Peter's flat in France, George exposes some secrets to Peter and then, worrying about Peter's place being bugged, says, ""How long since you've had the ferrets in?"" then writes KIROV's name on a piece of paper, not very discreet with all the other ""secret"" information he just gave away.Also, in Tinker Tailor, George had no children, but in Smiley's People, when talking to Mrs. Ostrakova, he says he has one daughter.I wonder how much of George Smiley's character is based on LeCarre's idea of himself while a spy. So many lines are written and said in Tinker Tailor and Smiley's People to over-emphasize how brilliant, well respected and important George is.",5,An exquisite portrayal once you've read the book or a synopsis,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,4401,"['been', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'rich', 'exquisitely', 'complex', 'story', 'Enjoyable', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'truth', 'expressed', 'sorrow', 'insanity', 'paranoia', 'broken', 'lives', 'caused', 'insane', 'dominating', 'leaders', 'country.This', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'important', 'details', 'book', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'name', 'are', 'many', 'important', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'one', 'would', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'characters', 'history', 'period.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'wiki', 'synopsis', 'then', 'watch', 'majority', 'characters', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'also', 'story', 'incredibly', 'insane', 'time', 'life', 'Stalin', 'Russia', 'spying', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'etc.', 'people', 'had', 'go', 'incredibly', 'elaborate', 'methods', 'communicate', 'important', 'information', 'other.It', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'retired', 'British', 'spy', 'named', 'George', 'Smiley', 'journey', 'honoring', 'murder', 'longtime', 'Russian', 'double', 'agent', 'General', 'Vladimir', 'Vladimir', 'was', 'attempting', 'get', 'information', 'George', 'flushing', 'out', 'longtime', 'enemy', 'KGB', 'spymaster', 'Karla.It', 'such', 'richer', 'story', 'telling', 'spy', 'world', 'what', 'usually', 'shown', 'Though', 'lightly', 'expressed', 'show', 'sorrows', 'paranoia', 'insanity', 'Not', 'justify', 'need', 'spying', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'grotesque', 'similarities', 'today', 'political', 'world.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'incredible', 'performances', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'few', 'lines', 'few', 'scenes', 'offer', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Otto', 'Leipzig', 'Vladik', 'Sheybal', 'Paul', 'Herzberg', 'Villem', 'Craven', 'Curd', 'Jargens', 'General', 'Vladimir', 'actors', 'performance', 'moved', 'story', 'ahead', 'powerful', 'ways', 'Then', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'who', 'new', 'cocky', 'rude', 'bad', 'mannered', 'know', 'spy', 'Lauder', 'Strickland', 'was', 'repulsed', 'Bernard', 'Hepton', 'played', 'Toby', 'Esterhase', 'enjoyable', 'enthusiastic', 'way', 'Mario', 'Adorf', 'played', 'Claus', 'Kretzschmar', 'brilliantly', 'warmly', 'sympathetically', 'hated', 'biased', 'line', 'written', 'demeaning', 'unions', 'cause', 'Britain', 'monetary', 'downfall', 'Joe', 'Praml', 'carried', 'small', 'role', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'brilliantly', 'keeping', 'strong', 'presence', 'role', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'Jacques', 'Maury', 'played', 'Sergei', 'warmly.Spoiler', 'alert', 'build', 'up', 'about', 'K.A.R.L.A.', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'disappointing', 'anti-climatic', 'then', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'landed', '20', 'ton', 'lead', 'balloon', 'murders', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'carried', 'out', 'Brit', 'American', 'spies', 'moles', 'especially', 'huge', 'long', 'betrayal', 'Bill', 'Hayden', 'when', 'George', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'defect', 'promising', 'Brit', 'taxpayers', 'will', 'pay', 'daughter', 'hospitalization', 'care', 'as', 'well', '~', 'as', 'long', 'interrogators', 'George', 'rendezvous', 'point', 'two', 'hours', 'early', 'owe', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'one', 'else', 'side', 'W-H-A-T', 'Did', 'George', 'suddenly', 'forget', '300-400', 'more', 'spies', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'had', 'tortured', 'killed', 'often', 'participating', 'activities', 'Then', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'finally', 'George', 'be', 'strongly', 'encouraged', 'Peter', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Michael', 'Byrne', 'look', 'W-H-A-T', 'Then', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'George', 'gaze', 'others', 'eyes', 'K.A.R.L.A', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'George', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'supposed', 'communicate', 'important', 'insight', 'ending', 'misses', 'hugely', 'disappointingly', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'above', 'mentioned', 'supporting', 'cast.There', 'are', 'few', 'big', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'example', 'George', 'Peter', 'rescue', 'Mrs.', 'Ostrakova', 'are', 'Peter', 'flat', 'France', 'George', 'secrets', 'Peter', 'then', 'worrying', 'Peter', 'place', 'being', 'bugged', 'How', 'long', ""'ve"", 'had', 'ferrets', 'then', 'KIROV', 'name', 'piece', 'paper', 'not', 'very', 'discreet', 'other', 'secret', 'information', 'just', 'gave', 'away.Also', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'George', 'had', 'children', 'Smiley', 'People', 'when', 'talking', 'Mrs.', 'Ostrakova', 'one', 'daughter.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'George', 'Smiley', 'character', 'based', 'LeCarre', 'idea', 'spy', 'So', 'many', 'lines', 'are', 'written', 'said', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Smiley', 'People', 'over-emphasize', 'how', 'brilliant', 'well', 'respected', 'important', 'George']",N/A
