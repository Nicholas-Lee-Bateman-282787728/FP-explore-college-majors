Such titles are: Goodfellas, Bugsy, The Godfather Part III, Miller's Crossing, Mobsters, and Billy Bathgate. Although Bugsy and Mobsters are much more putridly awful, Billy Bathgate is right behind them. It contains some of the worst acting pieces. In fact, everybody in the cast is woefully miscast. Dustin Hoffman doesn't strike me as a gangster, Nicole Kidman (awful as always) lets her vagina do the acting, Loren Dean is hopeless, Steve Buscemi needs a tan, Bruce Willis misses his hair, and Steven Hill belongs only in Law and Order. The story is pathetic and not worth watching. When the film ends, I am left with, ""That's it?"" At least it has a nice cinematography which made my sitting bearable.

307610,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,6302320429,C McGhee,"[0, 0]","This is the Dutch Schultz story as seen by Billy Bathgate a wanna be gangster. A surprisingly good tale lifted up by its cast & written screen play. Look for Bruce Willis in a great supporting role at the start of the movie.Dustin Hoffman turns in another stellar performance as Dutch Schultz. He is approaching his unforeseen fall from grace & it's this Dutch that Billie Bathgate's illusions of gang life are measured by & eventually shattered by. Loren Dean as Billy plays his part perfectly sometimes naive, sometimes streetwise. Dutch's girl friend is played by the ever beautiful Nicole Kidman who is married but tells Billy in relation to her being with Dutch ""No, I'm not his gal. He's my gangster."" She plays it that way too & gets a 5 star & you know why for.When the law comes after Dutch with ""Tax"" charges he is momentarily able to defend himself but as other charges are filed he decides to remove the attorney's causing all the problems right up to the U. S. attorney that started it all. Dutch's superiors which he don't recognize as his superior's no more have to reign in their mad dog & do so.This movie is always told through the eyes of Billie & his gangland tutor played by Steven Hill of Law & Order fame, just one fine acting job. Some claim Hoffman is so powerful here he overshadows the rest of the cast but I think that's shallow-sighted. Dutch Schultz was a overpowering man & only those that were able to subjugate themselves in his presence survived for long. That makes the other portrayals dead accurate & earns those actors & actresses their own deserved praise for this show.I see 4 1/2 stars for this movie.",4,Gangland falls,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1642,"['Dutch', 'Schultz', 'story', 'seen', 'Billy', 'Bathgate', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'gangster', 'A', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'tale', 'lifted', 'up', 'cast', 'written', 'screen', 'play', 'Look', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'start', 'movie.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'approaching', 'unforeseen', 'fall', 'grace', 'Dutch', 'Billie', 'Bathgate', 'illusions', 'gang', 'life', 'are', 'measured', 'eventually', 'shattered', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'Billy', 'part', 'perfectly', 'sometimes', 'naive', 'sometimes', 'streetwise', 'Dutch', 'girl', 'friend', 'played', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'married', 'tells', 'Billy', 'relation', 'being', 'Dutch', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'gal', 'gangster', 'way', 'too', '5', 'star', 'know', 'why', 'for.When', 'law', 'Dutch', 'Tax', 'charges', 'momentarily', 'able', 'defend', 'other', 'charges', 'are', 'filed', 'remove', 'attorney', 'causing', 'problems', 'right', 'up', 'U.', 'S.', 'attorney', 'started', 'Dutch', 'superiors', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'superior', 'more', 'have', 'reign', 'mad', 'dog', 'do', 'so.This', 'movie', 'always', 'told', 'eyes', 'Billie', 'gangland', 'tutor', 'played', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Law', 'Order', 'fame', 'just', 'one', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'claim', 'Hoffman', 'so', 'powerful', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'think', 'shallow-sighted', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'was', 'overpowering', 'man', 'only', 'were', 'able', 'subjugate', 'presence', 'survived', 'long', 'other', 'portrayals', 'dead', 'accurate', 'earns', 'actors', 'own', 'deserved', 'praise', 'show.I', 'see', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'movie']",Billy Bathgate VHS
307611,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302320429,C. O. DeRiemer,"[11, 14]","Based on IMDb, I'm evidently one of the few people, critics or public, who likes this movie. It's got some flaws, but on balance I think it tells an intriguing story, has a great look and features some first class performances. It also, admitedly, comes to a slow walk in the last third of the movie and only barely recovers.Billy Bathgate (Loren Dean) is a young kid, not quite a punk, who is ambitious and wants to make money. The easiest way is to become a gangster, and he figures out a way to be noticed by Dutch Schultz (Dustin Hoffman). The movie is told from Billy's perspective, but it's dominated by Schultz's cunning, violence and loss of power. Dutch Schultz controls the numbers racket, liquor and gambling. He has judges in his pocket with bribes. He has never had anything pinned on him, but now he's facing a tax evasion rap. He moves upstate to find a friendly jury. Although he beats the rap, the prosecutors won't stop coming at him. And more and more of his fellow sharks are circling closer as they realize that one way or another Schultz is becoming history. When he loses the confidence of Lucky Lucciano, his career comes to a violent halt. Billy survives, barely.Hoffman, in my view, gives a fine performance of a cunning, uneducated, suspicious and violent gangster. Schultz's way of dealing with a problem is to eliminate it as directly as possible. He's unpredictable; he may pat your face one minute and put a bullet through your open mouth the next. Steven Hill as Otto Berman, Schultz' long time operations manager and money man, gives an outstanding performance. Berman is getting a little old and tired, but he remains loyal to Schultz. Make no mistake; he's just as much a crook as Schultz. He develops a liking for Billy that saves Billy's life. Others who come up with compelling turns are Stanley Tucci as Luciano, as fascinating and calculating as a snake; Steve Buscemi as one of Schultz' hoods who does what he's told, Nicole Kidman as a society dame who seems to love the rough stuff and the danger and who gets in beyond her depth; Timothy Jerome as Dixie Davis, Schultz' slimy, dishonest and betraying lawyer, Bruce Willis as Bo Weinberg, Schultz's second-in-command, who makes the mistake of looking out for his own interests. Loren Dean does an okay job, in my view, as Billy. He's not a compelling actor, but neither is the character. Billy is an observer for the most part.It's the last part of the movie that's problematic. A good deal of time is spent rather humorlessly in a small town in upstate New York as Schultz and Berman go about trying to buy their way into the town's -- and the potential jury members' -- good graces. There's a bit of bracing violence, but too much exposition. And then the extended sequence in Saratoga with Kidman and Dean, and the growing danger to Kidman, kicks in...and it just seems long.On balance, though, I can watch this movie with pleasure...probably because of the style, the story line and Steven Hill's performance. There are no extras. The DVD picture looks just fine to me.",4,"A Big, Expansive, Violent Gangster Story",1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,3066,"['Based', 'IMDb', ""'m"", 'evidently', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'critics', 'public', 'who', 'movie', 'got', 'flaws', 'balance', 'think', 'intriguing', 'story', 'great', 'look', 'first', 'class', 'performances', 'also', 'admitedly', 'slow', 'walk', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'only', 'barely', 'recovers.Billy', 'Bathgate', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'young', 'kid', 'not', 'quite', 'punk', 'who', 'ambitious', 'make', 'money', 'easiest', 'way', 'become', 'gangster', 'out', 'way', 'be', 'noticed', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'movie', 'told', 'Billy', 'perspective', 'dominated', 'Schultz', 'cunning', 'violence', 'loss', 'power', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'numbers', 'racket', 'liquor', 'gambling', 'judges', 'pocket', 'bribes', 'never', 'had', 'anything', 'pinned', 'now', 'facing', 'tax', 'evasion', 'rap', 'upstate', 'find', 'friendly', 'jury', 'rap', 'prosecutors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'coming', 'more', 'more', 'fellow', 'sharks', 'are', 'circling', 'closer', 'realize', 'one', 'way', 'Schultz', 'becoming', 'history', 'When', 'confidence', 'Lucky', 'Lucciano', 'career', 'violent', 'halt', 'Billy', 'barely.Hoffman', 'view', 'fine', 'performance', 'cunning', 'uneducated', 'suspicious', 'violent', 'gangster', 'Schultz', 'way', 'dealing', 'problem', 'eliminate', 'as', 'directly', 'possible', 'unpredictable', 'may', 'pat', 'face', 'one', 'minute', 'put', 'bullet', 'open', 'mouth', 'next', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Otto', 'Berman', 'Schultz', 'long', 'time', 'operations', 'manager', 'money', 'man', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Berman', 'getting', 'little', 'old', 'tired', 'loyal', 'Schultz', 'Make', 'mistake', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'crook', 'Schultz', 'liking', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'life', 'Others', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'compelling', 'turns', 'are', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Luciano', 'fascinating', 'calculating', 'snake', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'one', 'Schultz', 'hoods', 'who', 'what', 'told', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'society', 'dame', 'who', 'love', 'rough', 'stuff', 'danger', 'who', 'depth', 'Timothy', 'Jerome', 'Dixie', 'Davis', 'Schultz', 'slimy', 'dishonest', 'betraying', 'lawyer', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Bo', 'Weinberg', 'Schultz', 'second-in-command', 'who', 'mistake', 'looking', 'out', 'own', 'interests', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'okay', 'job', 'view', 'Billy', 'not', 'compelling', 'actor', 'character', 'Billy', 'observer', 'most', 'part.It', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'problematic', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'spent', 'rather', 'humorlessly', 'small', 'town', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'Schultz', 'Berman', 'go', 'trying', 'buy', 'way', 'town', 'potential', 'jury', 'members', 'good', 'graces', 'bit', 'bracing', 'violence', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'then', 'extended', 'sequence', 'Saratoga', 'Kidman', 'Dean', 'growing', 'danger', 'Kidman', 'just', 'long.On', 'balance', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'pleasure', 'probably', 'style', 'story', 'line', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'performance', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'picture', 'just', 'fine']",Billy Bathgate VHS

Probably in this case, he was more attracted to Kidman than the business, and who could blame him?Dean was a complete no-name at the time and is a fine actor. Hoffman plays the crude Schultz and Kidman is his immoral wife. For some people, this film is remembered for quick full frontal nudity shots of Kidman. The most interesting person in the film, I thought, was Schultz' lawyer/confident Otto Berman, played by Steven Hill.

He kills, by hand if necessary, all those who would stand eventually in his way. A kid, a teenager, gets involved in this trip and he is shown as not understanding at all the why and the how of the crime business. He asks too many questions. He looks too much, and he even has some feeling for the rich woman who is buying herself a gangster gigolo who of course refuses the part. The poor boy will try to save the woman, who is married to a gay man, a very civil arrangement. So, he will be lucky to get out of the place just in time but to face the big boss in New York, and yet he will manage to escape. Amazing because unbelievable.

307619,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,6302320429,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[6, 7]","Before I give my review I just want to point out that the Plot Summaries on this website are inaccurate.  It is not about Billy Bathgate hooking up with a fledgling Dutch Schultz, and it is not about Billy Bathgate becoming Dutch Schultz's right hand man.  Schultz was already a superstar, a very wealthy man, when Billy met him, and Billy never became anything close to Dutch's right hand man.With all the movies available that are weak for one reason or another, it was a pleasure to find this one.  I suspected that it would be good when I saw that Dustin Hoffman was the star, and it was also a plus that Bruce Willis was a co-star.  Willis is listed as having a cameo appearance, but it's much more than that.The movie is about the Jewish Mafia in New York City in the 1930s.  Hoffman is Dutch Schultz (A pseudonym for a Jewish mobster) and Willis is the gangster Moe Weinberg, who worked with Schultz.In this story Schultz is the head of the Jewish Mafia but he is losing his grip as the FBI prosecutes him for tax evasion and mobsters Moe Weinberg and Lucky Luciano turn against him, believing that he's losing his touch and needs to be gotten rid of, that he has become more trouble than he's worth.Billy Bathgate is a kid from the Bronx who is thrilled to be noticed by wealthy Mr Schultz during the Depression.  Billy is hired by him.Very early in the film it appears that Moe Weinberg is about to be executed by Schultz for betrayal, and that Moe's girlfriend Mrs Drew Preston (Nicole Kidman) is of interest to Schultz.  Dutch makes her a proposition, testing her love for Moe.  Moe cares for Mrs Preston more than she does for him, but the one she really takes a liking to is Billy Bathgate.  She seems to like Billy even more than she likes her own husband.  Yes, she's married, though she is playing around with all these mobsters.  Her husband is probably gay, tolerating her absence, yet remaining fond of her and protective of her.  He is a rich man.The movie has us worrying first over Moe Weinberg, whether he will be executed by Schultz.  Then it has us involved in Dutch Schultz's court case for tax evasion, perhaps rooting for Dutch, perhaps not.  Then it has us concerned about whether Dutch is going to murder Mrs Preston.  Finally it has us worried whether Billy will get out alive or will be killed by either Dutch Schultz or Lucky Luciano.

307620,A152C8GYY25HAH,6302320429,Matthew Horner,"[23, 25]","""Billy Bathgate"" had the misfortune to be released the year after ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese's great gangster film which revived interest in the genre. True, ""Billy Bathgate"" is also about gangsters, but if you know the works of its director, Robert Benton, and those of Scorsese, you know they are not similar directors at all. While both men are fascinated by interesting characters, Benton is more intellectual and less visceral. Even in his most famous early screenplay, ""Bonnie and Clyde"", the characters spend a surprising amount of time sitting around and talking prior to the movie's infamous and violent climax. So, ""Billy Bathgate"" does not provide as much action or as many gut level situations as a typical gangster film. What is has is great atmosphere, a literate script by Tom Stoppard, brilliant cinematography by Nestor Almendros, and some interesting performances.Billy [Loren Dean] is a bright kid growing up in New York in the 1930s. The son of impoverished immigrants, he is getting most of his education in the streets. In his neighborhood, the heroes are gangsters like Dutch Shultz [Dustin Hoffman] and his men because they represent a way to climb out of poverty and to earn respect. One day Billy catches Shultz's eye and is soon working for him. The kid's not violent but he witnesses many acts of violence. These obviously unnerve him, but the lure of a fast buck is strong. Things get complicated when he is put in charge of looking after a rich society dame [Nicole Kidman], who has a sham marriage to a gay but powerful New Yorker. She gets her kicks by dating gangsters. She's in terrible danger because of something she saw, but she doesn't seem to be aware of it, though Billy is. He's also aware that she's the most beautiful and desirable woman he's ever met.I thought the movie was interesting and well done. I can see why others might find it too slow and talky. It has an elegance and a dignity that is somewhat at odds with its subject matter, but I found this contradiction fascinating. I also enjoyed watching Ms. Kidman in a role that predates both her American stardom and her years as Mrs. Tom Cruise. No one at the time was aware of the phenomenon she would later become, but looking at her from a decade's distance, all the signs are plainly there.",4,"Over looked, underrated Robert Benton period film",1025827200,"07 5, 2002",2002,2291,"['Billy', 'Bathgate', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'Goodfellas', 'Scorsese', 'great', 'gangster', 'film', 'revived', 'interest', 'genre', 'True', 'Billy', 'Bathgate', 'also', 'gangsters', 'know', 'works', 'director', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'Scorsese', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'similar', 'directors', 'men', 'are', 'fascinated', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Benton', 'more', 'intellectual', 'less', 'visceral', 'Even', 'most', 'famous', 'early', 'screenplay', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'characters', 'spend', 'surprising', 'amount', 'time', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'prior', 'movie', 'infamous', 'violent', 'climax', 'So', 'Billy', 'Bathgate', 'not', 'provide', 'much', 'action', 'many', 'gut', 'level', 'situations', 'typical', 'gangster', 'film', 'What', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'literate', 'script', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'interesting', 'performances.Billy', '[', 'Loren', 'Dean', ']', 'bright', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', '1930s', 'son', 'impoverished', 'immigrants', 'getting', 'most', 'education', 'streets', 'neighborhood', 'heroes', 'are', 'gangsters', 'Dutch', 'Shultz', '[', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', ']', 'men', 'represent', 'way', 'climb', 'poverty', 'earn', 'respect', 'One', 'day', 'Billy', 'Shultz', 'eye', 'soon', 'working', 'kid', 'not', 'violent', 'many', 'acts', 'violence', 'obviously', 'unnerve', 'lure', 'fast', 'buck', 'strong', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'put', 'charge', 'looking', 'rich', 'society', 'dame', '[', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', ']', 'who', 'sham', 'marriage', 'gay', 'powerful', 'New', 'Yorker', 'kicks', 'dating', 'gangsters', 'terrible', 'danger', 'something', 'saw', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'aware', 'Billy', 'also', 'aware', 'most', 'beautiful', 'desirable', 'woman', 'ever', 'met.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'too', 'slow', 'talky', 'elegance', 'dignity', 'somewhat', 'odds', 'subject', 'matter', 'found', 'contradiction', 'fascinating', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'role', 'American', 'stardom', 'years', 'Mrs.', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'aware', 'phenomenon', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'looking', 'decade', 'distance', 'signs', 'are', 'plainly', 'there']",Billy Bathgate VHS

He is Shultz's go-fer and does the little, menial tasks Shultz tells him to do and as he rises through the ranks, he becomes one of Shultz's trusted confidants. Dustin Hoffman put on a believable and solid performance as Dutch Shultz, the Mob boss who controls a $20 million empire and is paranoid and short-tempered because everything around him is about to collapse. His closest confidant Bo Weinberg (Bruce Willis) is stabbing him in the back by offering a slice of the Shultz pie to rival gangs because Shultz is on trial for income tax evasion. ""Lucky"" Lucciano, a rival ganglord, is waiting in the wings ready to pick up whatever pieces is left of the Shultz empire. And Shultz's trustworthy enforcer Julie Martin has stolen $50,000 from Shultz. Shultz is short tempered, hostile and paranoid, as well as he should be.The problem with this movie is despite the solid performances by an all star cast which includes Nicole Kidman, Dustin Hoffman, Bruce Willis, and Stanley Tucci, this movie was average. Billy Bathgate can not distinguish itself as a Gangster Classic in the mafia movie genre. It's mediocre and for a mafia film to be mediocre when there are such classics as The Godfather parts I and II, Mean Streets, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Miller's Crossing, Goodfellas, and Casino, is totally unacceptable. This is a 'C' movie. There is no unique storyline, dialogue, or characters. It feels so flat and listless as though the characters and storyline are going through the motions.

The audiencerelives the experience of that impoverished working class boy of Irish descent, who evolves intoa grown man, from both his career experience in that underground organization and hisintimate relationship with the character played by Nicole Kidman.This movie has the feel of a museum of sorts, such is its glossy psychological presentation, obviouslychosen to as to underline its entertainment value, at the same time as the story doesn't shy away (inthe rarer moments), from revealing the insidious personality of Dutch Schultz, and the underbellyof his organization, (encompassing gambling, booze, night club, protection rackets, etc)The music and filming is okay, the recreation of the time and space of the 1930's, isexcellent, while the full frontal nudity of Kidman on 3 occasions, doesn't seem to add muchto the movie or story, perhaps quite the opposite; the first, occurring in front of a mirror, thenext when she's diving into a water fall, and the last, when she's exiting the water. Perhapsthe Director insisted on the scenes, to underline Loren Dean growing into adulthood and its profoundsignificance.The social values of the time, and imperfection of the legal system is plain, as a significantnumber of judges, peace officers are keen in accepting envelopes filled with cash and gifts, inexchange for special favors protecting the Schultz organization. The strategy of asking fora court hearing to be done in a rural town vs. NYC, is explained, as the education level of out ofcity citizens is a lot lower, their neglected poverty simple to alleviate through cash gifts, in return for laterfavors as jurors, and the mass media being very local in each town, as citizens aren'toffered news articles from out of state very much, limiting their worldly perspective. In thewords of Hoffman: ""Those in Upstate NY (Onandaga) are decent people, unlike those in city.""The script spends time reliving Schultz's last years, the decline of thatorganization, as his original methods in maintaining power become a lot less effective in face ofa changing world, as new, equally lethal rivals appear on the scene, in the form of theSicilians keen in overtaking the Schultz territory and accompanying underground activities.As with Capone, the IRS has very strong Federal powers against those evading taxes, and ultimately,this leads to the demise of that gang leader. despite following his Consiglieri's advise to the letter.Bruce Willis is given a short role, but important one nonetheless, eventually payingthe price for a double cross, through cement boots, swimming with the fishes.Paradoxically, Schultz runs out of money, as a result of rubbing out one of his caporegimes whoboasted exorting $2 million per year from NYC restaurant owners on reputation only,because he admitted skimming $50 k as commissions.
