It is not only hysterical, but very informative as well.  Zane is able to blend knowledge and humor into a perfectly delightful must watch weekly television show~! Seriously, this is without a doubt the most engaging show on television.  In Three Sheets, Belgium, Zane goes to a few local bars, drinks a few drinks,  meets a crazy American who believes he is the true ""beer hunter"", hangs with the monks and finishes with a chocolatier.  The only thing better than having Three Sheets, Belgium, on your television is owning all 4 seasons of Three Sheets!  Watch the show...It's a good show..really!",5,Zane in Belgium is the BEST,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,708,"['Three', 'Sheets', 'Zane', 'Lampry', 'Belgium..AWESOME', 'Three', 'Sheets', 'far', 'best', 'drinking', 'show', 'television', 'not', 'only', 'hysterical', 'very', 'informative', 'well', 'Zane', 'able', 'blend', 'knowledge', 'humor', 'perfectly', 'delightful', 'must', 'watch', 'weekly', 'television', 'show~', 'Seriously', 'doubt', 'most', 'engaging', 'show', 'television', 'Three', 'Sheets', 'Belgium', 'Zane', 'few', 'local', 'bars', 'few', 'drinks', 'crazy', 'American', 'who', 'true', 'beer', 'hunter', 'hangs', 'monks', 'finishes', 'chocolatier', 'only', 'thing', 'better', 'having', 'Three', 'Sheets', 'Belgium', 'television', 'owning', '4', 'seasons', 'Three', 'Sheets', 'Watch', 'show', 'good', 'show..really']",Three Sheets

Plus the fact that I don't know if FLN is playing the older 3 sheets, this may be the only way to get to see them.The SHOW is great and entertaining so that outweighs the non-widescreen IMHO, so I would go for it.
