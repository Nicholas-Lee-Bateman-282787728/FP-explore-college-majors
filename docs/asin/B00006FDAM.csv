713064,A3W0MOMMWTWUVO,B00006FDAM,Jake Basset,"[1, 3]","I originally saw this movie as a kid, and hadn't seen it since the 70's. So, I bought it when I saw it up for grabs on ebay. As an adult I have to say that it is really sad that they didn't just make it a train movie! I am a train and hobo buff and this had the making of a great train movie. Tim Conway is funny enough, but why did they side-track this movie by introducing a dog kidnapping in the middle? This, in my opinion, gutted the movie. It was supposed to be a movie about a bungling oaf, who has to make it as a hobo in order to get his new found inheritence. Instead, they just throw in a couple of railroad scenes, and the whole movie is really about Tim Conway getting wrapped up in a dog-kidnapping scheme, and how he gets away from the bad guys. I was disappointed. I believe that they must have ran into a snag, either with getting cooperation from various railroads in the 70's, or had technical difficulties, and were forced to change the plot. I can only imagine how great this movie could have been, if they were able to actually make a real hobo movie out of it. The dog is pretty good, and obviously well trained. If you want to see a good train movie about hobo's, get emporer of the north.",3,Could have been a great movie if....,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1213,"['originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'kid', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '70', 'bought', 'when', 'saw', 'up', 'grabs', 'ebay', 'adult', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'train', 'movie', 'am', 'train', 'hobo', 'buff', 'had', 'making', 'great', 'train', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'funny', 'enough', 'why', 'did', 'side-track', 'movie', 'introducing', 'dog', 'kidnapping', 'middle', 'opinion', 'gutted', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'bungling', 'oaf', 'who', 'make', 'hobo', 'order', 'get', 'new', 'found', 'inheritence', 'Instead', 'just', 'throw', 'couple', 'railroad', 'scenes', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'getting', 'wrapped', 'up', 'dog-kidnapping', 'scheme', 'how', 'away', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'disappointed', 'believe', 'must', 'have', 'ran', 'snag', 'either', 'getting', 'cooperation', 'various', 'railroads', '70', 'had', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'were', 'forced', 'change', 'plot', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'able', 'actually', 'make', 'real', 'hobo', 'movie', 'dog', 'pretty', 'good', 'obviously', 'well', 'trained', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'train', 'movie', 'hobo', 'get', 'emporer', 'north']",The Billion Dollar Hobo
