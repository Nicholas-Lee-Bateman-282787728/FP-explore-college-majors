1151769,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00164KYTG,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","Step Brothers / B001G5T6GW*Spoilers*I really lovedTalladega Nights, but I wasn't sure how much I would like Step Brothers. There is always the threat that the premise will get old, after all, how long can two grown men pretending to be over-grown children be funny? The answer is, pretty long, apparently.Step Brothers is, in my opinion, a perfect example of what a good supporting cast can do for a movie. The lead actors do what they need to, and do it well, but the result simply would not be as funny as it is without the supporting cast provided. Gags are handled with a light touch and the movie resists giving in to obvious running gags for their own sake. Witness the ""poorly trained seeing eye dog"" scene which is quite amusing in its own right, but is even more appreciated because it is one joke, not a running gag that drags through the entire movie. Or witness the ""sleep walking"" scene which is amusing, but has more value as a single plot device - it compels the parents towards the decision that the boys simply must move out.Mother and Father here are superb, particularly the Mother, as she struggles with her love for her sons (including her step-son) and tries to balance out which behavior (Tough and firm? Gentle and understanding?) will bring the most good in each situation. And the Obnoxious Brother is fantastic, with the ""car sing-along"" scene comic genius, a study into this repressed, over-achieving world. Each supporting cast member completely buys into the ridiculous premise of the movie, making it believable and giving the movie a tension that otherwise would be lacking.My only real complaint is that the movie felt that it didn't know how to wind down gracefully. The over-the-top ending is silly in that it validates the bad behavior of the ""boys"" all this time, but it recognizes that it is silly in that there is just no good way to end the movie at this point, outside the obvious ""learn to grow up"" ending which is unsatisfying for other reasons. Still, the movie is very enjoyable and silly, even if it isn't Talledega Nights material.This movie has closed captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",4,Surprisingly Humorous,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,2147,"['Step', 'Brothers', '/', 'B001G5T6GW*Spoilers*I', 'really', 'lovedTalladega', 'Nights', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'always', 'threat', 'premise', 'will', 'get', 'old', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'two', 'grown', 'men', 'pretending', 'be', 'over-grown', 'children', 'be', 'funny', 'answer', 'pretty', 'long', 'apparently.Step', 'Brothers', 'opinion', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'well', 'result', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'supporting', 'cast', 'provided', 'Gags', 'are', 'handled', 'light', 'touch', 'movie', 'giving', 'obvious', 'running', 'gags', 'own', 'sake', 'Witness', 'poorly', 'trained', 'seeing', 'eye', 'dog', 'scene', 'quite', 'amusing', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'more', 'appreciated', 'one', 'joke', 'not', 'running', 'gag', 'entire', 'movie', 'witness', 'sleep', 'walking', 'scene', 'amusing', 'more', 'value', 'single', 'plot', 'device', 'parents', 'decision', 'boys', 'simply', 'must', 'move', 'out.Mother', 'Father', 'here', 'are', 'superb', 'particularly', 'Mother', 'love', 'sons', 'including', 'step-son', 'tries', 'balance', 'out', 'behavior', 'Tough', 'firm', 'Gentle', 'understanding', 'will', 'bring', 'most', 'good', 'situation', 'Obnoxious', 'Brother', 'fantastic', 'car', 'sing-along', 'scene', 'comic', 'genius', 'study', 'repressed', 'over-achieving', 'world', 'supporting', 'cast', 'member', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'movie', 'making', 'believable', 'giving', 'movie', 'tension', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'lacking.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'movie', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'wind', 'down', 'gracefully', 'over-the-top', 'ending', 'silly', 'bad', 'behavior', 'boys', 'time', 'silly', 'just', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'point', 'obvious', 'learn', 'grow', 'up', 'ending', 'unsatisfying', 'other', 'reasons', 'Still', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'silly', 'even', ""n't"", 'Talledega', 'Nights', 'material.This', 'movie', 'closed', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Step Brothers

1151772,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00164KYTG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Three stars may seem too high or too low depending on your personal feelings on this film, but for me it seems just about right.  The movie is about as stupid as the day is long, but in its defense, for the audience that it is targeting, it also proves to be about as funny as the day is long too.  This is not a date movie, nor is it a movie for most women (you can add children and seniors and very strict, easily offended individuals to that list too).  What it is, is a movie for males, ages 18-35 (ish) who want to embrace their inner child.Quite frankly, this is a movie about two overgrown children, and what guy (in that age bracket) doesn't wish they could just be a child from time to time?Brennan is 39, Dale is 40.  Both live with their parent (Brennan with his mother, Dale with his father) and both are completely dependant and obnoxiously immature.  They are thirteen year olds really.  When Brennan and Dale are forced to live with one another (when their parents get hitched) there is immediate resentment (and a lot of fighting) but when Dale proves himself to Brennan by standing up to Brennan's equally obnoxious yet financially successful brother Derek, the two become the best of friends.""Quick, on the count of three name you're favorite dinosaur.""When their parents force them to be responsible, they find it hard, but when their actions cause pain to the ones they love the most they find that inside their bodies lies a grownup waiting to come out.This could have easily been a forgettable mess, but the cast is to in tune with the film (and they all know this is above and beyond ridiculous, so they play to that weakness and make it a strength) that it becomes an uproarious experience, even if you're rolling your eyes at the films universal stupidity.  Will Ferrell is always able to make me laugh, even when his films are less than brilliant, and here he does it again.  Like in `Talladega Nights' though, he is easily upstaged by John C. Reilly who once again dominates this film.  They work great together though, and honestly, any other two actors in these roles wouldn't have worked; at all.  The supporting cast is also great, especially Richard Jenkins (he is on a role) and Mary Steenburgen.  Adam Scott is the perfect example of the worst person you could possibly become, and Kathryn Hahn captures the comedic side to, well, being married to the worst human you could ever marry.Yes, the film is above and beyond offensive.  It has jokes about any and everything perverted and gross and it manages to fill it's dialog with the same four letter word quite frequently, but if that is something that rubs you wrong than maybe you shouldn't even be reading this review.  Know that with all that offence comes a boat load of laughs (HA, boats...and hoes) and those laughs help you forget just how stupid this movie really is.I'll watch it again.",3,How could a movie this stupid be this funny?,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2880,"['Three', 'stars', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'high', 'too', 'low', 'depending', 'personal', 'feelings', 'film', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'movie', 'as', 'stupid', 'day', 'long', 'defense', 'audience', 'targeting', 'also', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'funny', 'day', 'long', 'too', 'not', 'date', 'movie', 'movie', 'most', 'women', 'can', 'add', 'children', 'seniors', 'very', 'strict', 'easily', 'offended', 'individuals', 'list', 'too', 'What', 'movie', 'males', '18-35', 'ish', 'who', 'want', 'embrace', 'inner', 'child.Quite', 'frankly', 'movie', 'two', 'overgrown', 'children', 'what', 'guy', 'age', 'bracket', ""n't"", 'wish', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'child', 'time', 'time', 'Brennan', '39', 'Dale', '40', 'live', 'parent', 'Brennan', 'mother', 'Dale', 'father', 'are', 'completely', 'dependant', 'obnoxiously', 'immature', 'are', 'thirteen', 'year', 'olds', 'really', 'When', 'Brennan', 'Dale', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'one', 'when', 'parents', 'get', 'hitched', 'immediate', 'resentment', 'lot', 'fighting', 'when', 'Dale', 'Brennan', 'standing', 'up', 'Brennan', 'equally', 'obnoxious', 'yet', 'financially', 'successful', 'brother', 'Derek', 'two', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Quick', 'count', 'three', 'name', ""'re"", 'favorite', 'dinosaur', 'When', 'parents', 'force', 'be', 'responsible', 'find', 'hard', 'when', 'actions', 'cause', 'pain', 'ones', 'love', 'most', 'find', 'inside', 'bodies', 'grownup', 'waiting', 'come', 'out.This', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'forgettable', 'mess', 'cast', 'tune', 'film', 'know', 'above', 'ridiculous', 'play', 'weakness', 'make', 'strength', 'uproarious', 'experience', 'even', ""'re"", 'rolling', 'eyes', 'films', 'universal', 'stupidity', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'always', 'able', 'make', 'even', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'less', 'brilliant', 'here', 'again', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'though', 'easily', 'upstaged', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'work', 'great', 'together', 'honestly', 'other', 'two', 'actors', 'roles', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'role', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'perfect', 'example', 'worst', 'person', 'could', 'possibly', 'become', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'comedic', 'side', 'well', 'being', 'married', 'worst', 'human', 'could', 'ever', 'marry.Yes', 'film', 'offensive', 'jokes', 'everything', 'perverted', 'gross', 'fill', 'dialog', 'same', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'quite', 'frequently', 'something', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'reading', 'review', 'Know', 'offence', 'boat', 'load', 'laughs', 'HA', 'boats', 'hoes', 'laughs', 'help', 'forget', 'just', 'how', 'stupid', 'movie', 'really', 'is.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again']",Step Brothers

It was funny the first three times you see his schtick but has become old and tired by now. Step Brothers is just another attempt at going after the ""Let's-go-watch-crude-humor"" crowd, only this time it mostly falls flat! Seriously, I would love to see Ferrell try to do something different, maybe stretch himself a little but that seems to be asking too much.Step Brothers is a story of two middle-age men (boys?, man-childs?), each living with their single parent. When their parents marry each other they are thrown together as, well, step brothers. Forced to live in the same bedroom they at first hate each other until they figure out that basically they are exactly alike. To me, the best and funniest parts were when they were trying to get rid of the other.The film has many problems. There is no real storyline, just a series of site gags and comedy sketches. Most of the funniest scenes (except the most crude examples) have already been shown in the previews and commercials, which leaves you watching mostly second tier jokes that miss the mark. While Ferrell and Reilly play off each other well you end up with a feeling that you've seen it all before. Are there funny moments. Absolutely! And a few surprises as well. But overall, not a very good film.If you are a huge Will Ferrell fan, you will probably like this. If you are into very crude humor, then by all means, go see it.

1151784,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00164KYTG,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 5]","Does anyone remember when comedies were actually funny? When actors made us laugh with witty dialogue instead of four-letter words? When constant references to genitalia and sex were reserved for late-night standup routines? When the sight of adults beating up children was considered offensive? Far be it from me to want to sound like a curmudgeon, but for God's sake, comedic filmmakers aren't even trying anymore. I'm saying all this because I've now seen ""Step Brothers,"" a film so desperate for a laugh that it resorts to bottom-of-the-barrel shock gags, not the least of which is Will Ferrell rubbing his testicles all over a drum set. He stars in this film along with John C. Reilly, a talented actor whose credits for ""Chicago,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" and ""Gangs of New York"" make me believe he's so much better than this.The plot: Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (Reilly) are unemployed forty-year-olds still living at home. One magical day, Brennan's mother, Nancy (Mary Steenburgen), and Dale's father, Robert (Richard Jenkins), fall in love, and it isn't long before they decide to tie the knot. This means that Nancy and Brennan have to move in with Robert and Dale. While the newlyweds are very much in love, the children (and that is the right term for them) absolutely hate each other. Their fighting eventually escalates to the point of Robert giving an ultimatum: If neither one of them finds a job by the end of the month, they will be kicked out of the house. Why he was never this firm with his own son much earlier in his life, I have no idea. I can say the same thing about Nancy, a woman whose compassion, support, and love for her son makes an inability to say no perfectly obvious.Screenwriters Ferrell and Adam McKay (who also directed the film) seem to believe that this idea is funny by default, seeing as slacker characters are stereotypically put into the teen to twenty-something age range. So they must have thought: If young spoiled brats can make audiences laugh, why not middle-aged spoiled brats? Sorry guys, but it doesn't work that way. Forty-year-old jobless losers are best suited for serious dramas about lonely souls who haven't learned to grow up. It's terrible material for immature comedies. There's absolutely nothing funny about grown men wearing tuxedos to job interviews, just as there's nothing funny about telling the interviewers to shut up because they're sounding stupid. Were this a complex character study, I might have felt sorry for them. I also might have rooted for them, because heaven knows they needed someone in their corner.But ""Step Brothers"" isn't constructed like that. Social crippled people are just jokes to the filmmakers, with any degree of truth stripped away for the sake of cheap laughter. When Brennan and Dale suddenly become best friends, we discover things about them that make them look even stupider. They both have a tendency to sleepwalk, and that's when they do even stranger things than when they're awake. They both think Velocaraptors are the greatest dinosaurs. They both believe that nailing a full-sized twin bed atop another full-sized twin bed is the way to make functioning bunk beds. Oh, and we also learn that Brennan was once a talented singer, but he lost his confidence at age seventeen during a humiliating high school performance. He and Dale soon make plans to start their own music business, and this involves making a music video on Robert's beloved yacht.Speaking of Robert, he quickly begins to resent not only his son and stepson, but also his wife, who he (correctly) believes is enabling their horrible behavior. What's worse, he's taken a liking to Nancy's other son, a highly successful jerk named Derek (Adam Scott). He uses Brennan as a verbal punching bag at every opportunity and delights in seeing him fail at everything he tries. Naturally, he was one of the key players in Brennan's high school humiliation, as all brothers are in movies like this. This character creates quite a bit of conflict, which, I know, was the point. But still, was there really no other way to portray him as uncaring and mean-spirited? Was it necessary for him to force his wife and kids to sing ""Sweet Child of Mine,"" then berate his incredibly unhappy wife, Alice (Katheryn Hahn), for her soft voice? On the same token, was it necessary for Alice to constantly throw herself at Dale, begging for sex?Despite my harsh words, despite my heavy complaining, I'm well aware that many people are going to find ""Step Brothers"" funny. It's more than well suited for its late teens, early twenties target audience, which will undoubtedly ignore this review altogether. Clearly, this movie was not made for me. Still, I can't help but wonder how it can appeal to anyone. Why do movie like this always generate a following? Where is the humor in forty-year-old men behaving like four-year-old boys? There's a point at which Robert puts Brennan and Dale into therapy, and that makes perfect sense because men like this need all the psychological help they can get. They need Rorschach tests and word association games and expensive medications. What they don't need is an excuse to be immature, which in this case is the appalling screenplay. ""Step Bothers"" is a film that gives brotherly love a bad name. Heck, it gives the entire concept of family a bad name.",2,We Aren't Fam-i-ly,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,5375,"['Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'when', 'comedies', 'were', 'actually', 'funny',

Secondly, if you're not a Will Ferrell fan, you're probably not going to like this.  This is one of those comedies that's stupidly funny, much like the comedy classic 'The Jerk' starring Steve Martin.  If you're not a fan of silly, crude and offensive humor then avoid this film at all costs, but if you've seen Will and John's previous efforts and enjoyed them, then you will most surely love this one, as it is without a doubt the best film they've made together, and I would go so far as saying that it's Will Ferrell's best yet.Many people seeing this movie are apparently unaware that it is Rated R for sexual content, language and profanity, so be warned if this is not in tune with your sensibilities, and you definitely do not want your kids watching this, it is for grown ups only.  There is one scene in particular involving a drumset that may be a bit much for for the more reserved audience members.This movie had me in tears of uncontrollable laughter numerous times throughout, and that is quite rare for a comedy to accomplish, so I have to give it my highest recommendation.  My friends who watched it with me were laughing just as hard and we all agreed that we had to buy it once it came out on DVD.Yes it is sophomoric, yes much of it is in poor taste, but sometimes one just has to let loose, and what's what this movie achieves, it's a great opportunity to just kick back, relax and enjoy life through two goofy guys who act like little kids.It's more than that though, as the film progresses they learn their lessons that they can't be so irresponsible forever, much like in Judd Apatow's other films, so without giving away too much, they do what they need to and redeem themselves in the process, so despite its silliness, it's not an entirely pointless movie.'Step Brothers' is a fun ride which reminds us to not lose the kid inside of us all and to not take life too seriously, and anyone with a funnybone that's itching to be scratched should buy this film, you won't regret it.",5,Hilarious From Start To Finish!,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,2135,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Secondly', ""'re"", 'not', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fan', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'one', 'comedies', 'stupidly', 'funny', 'much', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Jerk', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Martin', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'silly', 'crude', 'offensive', 'humor', 'then', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Will', 'John', 'previous', 'efforts', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'surely', 'love', 'one', 'doubt', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'made', 'together', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'saying', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'best', 'yet.Many', 'people', 'seeing', 'movie', 'are', 'apparently', 'unaware', 'Rated', 'R', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'profanity', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'tune', 'sensibilities', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'kids', 'watching', 'grown', 'ups', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'involving', 'drumset', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'more', 'reserved', 'audience', 'members.This', 'movie', 'had', 'tears', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter', 'numerous', 'times', 'quite', 'rare', 'comedy', 'accomplish', 'have', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'friends', 'who', 'watched', 'were', 'laughing', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'agreed', 'had', 'buy', 'came', 'out', 'DVD.Yes', 'sophomoric', 'yes', 'much', 'poor', 'taste', 'sometimes', 'one', 'just', 'let', 'loose', 'what', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'opportunity', 'just', 'kick', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'life', 'two', 'goofy', 'guys', 'who', 'act', 'little', 'kids.It', 'more', 'though', 'film', 'learn', 'lessons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'irresponsible', 'forever', 'much', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'other', 'films', 'so', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'what', 'need', 'redeem', 'process', 'so', 'silliness', 'not', 'entirely', 'pointless', 'movie', 'Brothers', 'fun', 'ride', 'not', 'lose', 'kid', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'too', 'seriously', 'anyone', 'funnybone', 'itching', 'be', 'scratched', 'should', 'buy', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Step Brothers

There are some appalling moments of crude humor, so be warned, and though many of the jokes have been used before, Farrell's whiny childlike persona is less annoying when playing off the deadpan, unpredictable Reilly (who is a very good actor). Other talented members of the supporting cast (Steenburgen) give this film much more credibility than most comedies, and if nothing else, it makes for an evening of laughs.

The film is about two guys who become step-brothers at the age of mid-30s to their 40s. The kicker is they still live with their parents. Now, on the surface, that alone is a pretty good plot for a movie staring two great guys who do the best of idiot films. However, the writing for situations is just poor.The movie starts off pretty strong, and even parts in the middle keep you interested, but the ending is just plain stupid. That's not to say just the end of the movie, but it goes from a good laugh out loud comedy to sometime in the middle and on being a ""when is this over?"" movie. Even during the film, one of the problems comes from the language. It felt really forced in to make the movie feel more 'adult' or raunchy. There's some instances that the language just seems thrown in to remind you you're not watching a PG-13 movie.I'm really not sure why this movie received such praise for it's crudeness. I expected some jokes to make me squirm a little, but it's really not there. It's no different, aside from a few jokes here and there, from any other Ferrell or Reilly film.As for the Blu-ray quality, it is a very good transfer and it's loaded with special features.

1151808,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00164KYTG,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[5, 7]","Honestly, I think I just watched my favorite Will Ferrell movie. In fact, I'm sure of it.Once again (after the somewhat successful Talladega Nights) director Adam McKay and actors Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have made one of the funniest films I've seen in years. Ferrell and Reilly play two 40 year old men that never, ever left the house due to their single enabling parents who meet, marry, and move the entire clan in together. At first the two men are quite humorously confrontational, but thanks to their similar immaturity and downright stupidity find a common bond and cause chaos in their parents' newly married lives. But soon they're faced with either growing up or getting out. They are just downright hilarious in these roles, and the cast of supporting characters, including Ferrell's younger more successful real-life brother and his sex-starved wife, really brings this movie to a great flow and the humor ranges from chuckles to gasping for air.To be honest though, if you're over twenty-five and still live with your parents, this film might make you uncomfortable, and it should. This might be your future. But for those of us that are in the 40-ish range, watching these two you can't help but to laugh at and with them. The disc itself has alot of special features too like a hilarious gag-reel, documentary (great for learning about the process of on-set ad-libbing), and a line-o-rama reel of all the choices of one liners that didn't make the cut (and 90% are actually worthy). Now my review here is for the R-rated version, but I can only imagine how much farther this movie could go in vulgarity. In fact, at times the ""F"" word was used more than any other word in a scene, not to mention some of those clever sight-gags. To put it mildly, even in the R version, you'll never look at another drumkit the same way again.Highly recommended to those who've already grown up to see the reason why you did in the first place.

Personally, I like his brand of humor and his gags and facial expressions and over-the-top manners are usually right on the mark. However, Step Brothers is such a hapless, lame form of comedy, going to the most juvenile desperations and gimmicks to get laughs, that it becomes tiresome and forgettable after awhile. We have basically Will Ferrell and John C. Reiley as two forty-year old men who live at home together and are forced to step brothers when their mom and dad get together and marry. This does sound like a funny premise, right? And, for awhile, there are moments when this is a funny movie. But, after about twenty minutes of the film it is clear which direction this film is taking, as the potty jokes, overuse of profanity, crudeness, and general stupidity surface. I don't mind some crudeness or even profanity it is well-timed, but, in Step Brothers, they hit you over the head with it so much that it loses its effect. I'm not asking for a lot of cleverness, but you might think they could have put together a better effort. It must be nice to write a script as lazily put together as this, and have your two stars act like jackasses for two hours, and get paid. The movie seems to run as if it is all improvisation, because much of it is mindless, mistimed or awkward. Then, they throw in the fake Hollywood happier ever after ending to top it all off.Don't get me wrong. There are a few laughs, and I suppose Will Ferrell is good enough for a rental. But, this film might have been better served being a skit on Saturday Night Live, because two hours is way too long.

It's going to be a ton of juvenile antics, hilarious ad-libbing, and a comedic duo in Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly just delivering nonsensical humor from beginning to end.  Brendan (Ferrell) and Dale (Reilly) are 40-year old men without jobs.  They have no prospects.  They have no love life.  They possess nothing that the average adult covets.  What the two do have, however, is a child-like desire to have fun, to live life to the fullest, and the ability to eschew adulthood at all costs.  When their parents marry one another there is initial step-sibling resentment, but they quickly become best friends.  From there, they rely on great lines, superb gags, a good deal of vulgarity, and the wackiness their fans have grown to enjoy to deliver the hilarity.  That's the gist of this movie.  It's exactly what I expected and I laughed, HARD.For those who didn't enjoy this movie and didn't find it funny, I'd suggest you ""lost your dinosaur.""  Towards the end of the movie, Dale's father Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins) delivers a speech about his inability to go back in time and pretend being a T-Rex, something he so desperately wanted as a child.  The message is the very meaning of this movie and in large part Ferrell and Reilly's comedic oeuvre (because they're artists).  Essentially, it's about attempting to be free-spirited, having fun, enjoying everything, and maintaining the youthful belief that absolutely anything is possible as long as you truly believe and try your hardest.  It's about letting go of inhibitions.  It's about taking chances without worries.  It's about ignoring the reasons why a movie is not plausible, why a plot-device is weak, or why Back to the Future just ""doesn't make sense"".  Sit back, shut up, and enjoy as a child would (with the obvious difference that you'll enjoy adult humor).  After all, ignorance is bliss.  Enjoy the pirates, the tree house, theHulk Smash Hands, the bunk beds, and the karate gear.  It's alright to laugh, be silly, and act capriciously.  The very actions invigorate.  Enjoy life.

Step Brothers, while among the better of those offerings, is still merely decent for the most part, but does have some classic bits.Both Will and John are very funny at moments here, but it's (some) hit and (mostly) miss. Ferrell, McKay, Apatow and co. seem to have a few pat formulas and are milking them to death these days. They still enjoy using the f-word for shock value, and while I enjoy a well-placed f-bomb there are more here than are needed, just as there are more truly adolescent jokes than needed. If the movie's for kids, keep the fart jokes etc and dump the swearing. If it's for adults, the opposite (though a good fart joke is also fun for adults...a good one, that is). Yet featuring both in great supply just makes movies like this feel too unfocused and haphazard. That said, there are a bunch of laughs and I really enjoyed parts of this film.Still, Ferrell can do a whole lot better than this, and I wish he would.

For the most part I try to hold my composure and have poise. Typically when a man in the room laughs at bare balls on our television screen I will roll my eyes. But this movie may have changed that. I was a teenager when it came out and went to watch it with my family. All I can remember is how hysterically loud my father and brother laughed throughout the entire film. My family is one of those families that gets in a movie theatre and angers all of the other families with their obnoxiously loud laughter. But during this movie everyone was laughing, so we fit right in. Even my mother, who refuses to even use a public bathroom (everything repulses her), was laughing at this film. It had parts where we were literally choking on our popcorn.A few years later and I'm now buying this film for my boyfriend for his birthday (shhh, he doesn't know it yet). He hasn't seen it, but shares an uncanning resemblence to my father in the 'what's funny' department- so I'm assuming he'll be peeing himself by the time this is over. And I'm dieing in anticipation to watch it again. It's one of my favorite feel-good movies. If you have a teenage son or a husband who resembles a teenage son- this is an awesome gift. It's hysterical, crude, filled with manly humour, and yet somehow hilarious even from a woman's perspective. I'm literally laughing just thinking about this movie. I'm not kidding- I'm laughing aloud right now. And my boyfriend just asked 'Why?'. And I just told him 'You'll see.'. Because he'll see.

1151858,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00164KYTG,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Will Ferrell is an interesting comedic actor. When he appeared on SNL I thought he was one of the best things on it. When he left, his movies inspired laughter. But then something happened. Each character he played in a movie seemed to be the same one with little or no differentiation from the past one. In short order, I began to avoid Ferrell films.The he did STRANGER THAN FICTION and showed that he had some acting chops. TALLADEGA NIGHTS was more of the same though it was funny and BLADES OF GLORY showed that he did have talent. Now we have STEPBROTHERS and Ferrell has made me believe that as with Adam Sandler, the one note character may have more life in him than I thought.The story of STEPBROTHERS revolves around two grown step-siblings who are so mentally undeveloped it's sad in a way. Ferrell is 39 year old Brennan Huff whose mother Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen) has just met and married Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins). Doback has a son named Dale (John C. Reilly) who is 40. What's the catch? Both sons still live with their parents.No, I don't mean they live under the same roof, though they do. Both ""boys"" still live at home and depend on their parents to take care of them. Neither has a job nor seems to be looking for one. Both are interested in juvenile things, not as collectors or such, but as involved participants. Both seem to be stuck in that pre-teen world where cursing comes unnaturally and often and their interests revolve solely around themselves.The two face off as Brennan and his mother move in with Dale and his father. They take an immediate dislike to one another as step siblings do now having to share their parent with someone else. Dale suggests that Nancy is hot for him and his dad and Brennan threatens to punch Dale in his sleep.The back and forth battle rages until Brennan's brother shows up. Derek (Adam Scott) is a snobbish, self praising jerk who likes to do nothing more than make life terrible for older brother Brennan. With a new target in Dale, he starts in. A punch in the nose turns the battling step-siblings into best friends.Even though the pair now find they have more in common than they thought, their dad has decided that its time for them to leave the nest. Giving them one month to find jobs or their out on their own, they struggle against the idea, eventually coming up with one of their own that fails. The step parents don't see eye to eye on how to handle it and a split occurs.Forced to find a new place to live, the duo fight once more only to start the next day growing up. Each one takes on a real life job. Each one moves up in their positions. Until a chance encounter gives them the opportunity to make amends for all involved.So where are the laughs in all of this? Mostly in the hijinks and insults hurled back and forth between the two. The situations between them are hilarious. And the sad thing in writing about this is that to fill you in on particulars would do nothing more than to ruin the comedy you see first hand. Trust me when I say the film is hilarious. Offensive? Sure. Crude? Certainly. But anyone who's seen a Ferrell film won't find it so.Having tired of Ferrell's one note character I wasn't looking forward to an enjoyable evening watching this film. I will say I was pleasantly surprised to discover this was one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. It's one that I know I'll come back to time and again when I need a laugh.

Adam Scott plays the younger, more successful Huff brother, Derek, while Kathryn Hahn plays as his wife Alice, who's somehow more attracted to 40-year-old loser Dale over her well-established husband.  Adam McKay directed it, and Jimmy Miller and Judd Apatow produced it.Now, the humor in the movie is pretty dumb, but the story takes the right turns for what should be in a comedy movie.  Ferrel and Reilly's characters are often portrayed as dumb, but they can be shown to grow when pushed.  There were a lot of subtle moments in the dialogue where it felt ridiculous yet human at the same time, so it's good to pay attention to everything.  From start to finish everything is pretty over the top and leaves you with the lesson learned is that you can be yourself when the chores are done.I say its worth picking up for people interested in movies as well as fans of Frat Pack style of comedy and worth renting for the casual movie fan.",4,Dumb humor that's downright hilarious,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,1477,"['Will', 'Ferrel', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'star', 'film', 'Brennan', 'Huff', 'Dale', 'Doback', 'two', 'late', '30/early', '40-year-olds', 'who', 'are', 'developmentally', 'challenged', 'either', ""'re"", 'spoiled', 'coddled', 'combination', 'two', 'Common', 'sense', 'typically', 'most', 'situations', 'anyone', 'above', 'average', 'intelligence', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'easily', 'fun', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'play', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Robert', 'Doback', 'Nancy', 'Huff', 'star-crossed', 'yet', 'crass', 'parents', 'who', 'met', 'make', 'union', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'younger', 'more', 'successful', 'Huff', 'brother', 'Derek', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'wife', 'Alice', 'who', 'somehow', 'more', 'attracted', '40-year-old', 'loser', 'Dale', 'well-established', 'husband', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'directed', 'Jimmy', 'Miller', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'produced', 'it.Now', 'humor', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'story', 'right', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Ferrel', 'Reilly', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'portrayed', 'dumb', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'grow', 'when', 'pushed', 'were', 'lot', 'subtle', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'where', 'felt', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'human', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'pay', 'attention', 'everything', 'start', 'finish', 'everything', 'pretty', 'top', 'lesson', 'learned', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'chores', 'are', 'done.I', 'say', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'people', 'interested', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'Frat', 'Pack', 'style', 'comedy', 'worth', 'renting', 'casual', 'movie', 'fan']",Step Brothers

It isn't long before they're at war with each other and driving their parents crazy, and things get even worse when they become best buds. While predictable in its story, Step Brothers relies solely on the comedic talents of Ferrell and Reilly, who once again make a great comedic team.

Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, and Adam Sandler used to be this way, now its the turn of the likes of Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, and Will Ferrel.  Starting of with Blades of Glory, and now continuuing with Step Brothers, Will Ferrel has helped make crude comedy mainstream.  This movie is about two middle-aged men who have not grown up, each living in their parent's house.  When their parent's meet and marry, they end up as stepbrothers and proceed to first fight each other, and then become best friends.  This is not the first Hollywood movie about two individuals who suddenly become stepbrothers or stepsisters; but this is certainly the most disgusting movie of this topic.  Whether its a close-up of Ferrel's testicles, or Reilly farting during a job interview, this movie is beyond ridiculous.  There are many funny scenes during this movie, but some are just beyond believable, and makes the audience wonder what type of parents would raise such people.  And this criticism is why I give this movie 3/5 stars, great comedies are great because you don't see the laughs coming until its too late.

Whereas shockingly crude movies like 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN or SUPERBAD have the power to make our jaws drop at their crassness...they also showed us people who actually felt convincing and were actually, occasionally, touching.  Look for no such depth in STEP BROTHERS.It tells the story of two single 60-somethings (Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen) meeting, getting married and living together.  Unfortunately, each also has a 40 year old son who has never managed to move out on his own.  Thus, these two overgrown children are forced to live together...and the results make for hilarity (sometimes).This is actually a pretty good premise.  We've all seen those adult ""kids"" who still live at home so they can save on rent, have home cookin', etc.  But usually we see those types also working and having goals (like saving up for a down payment on a home in order to move out.)  Reilly and Farrell have barely held jobs in their lives, currently have none, and they also have no ambitions other than vague notions of ""show biz,"" perhaps.As the squabbling of the two becomes worse and worse, the exasperated parents finally draw the line, giving the kids just one month to get jobs and move out.  And faced with a goal...things only get worse and worse from there.  I won't spoil any more of the ""plot"" for you...I'm sure you'll thank me for that!There are moments of genuine humor to be found.  Farrell has a younger brother who is successful beyond anything Farrell can imagine...but he's also the most unmitigated jerk.  Seeing him gives you a tiny glimpse into why Farrell might be so stunted.  There scenes have a squirmy quality underneath the cheap shots.  I also found the idea that Reilly's character is continuously taunted by some playground bullies to be amusing.But mostly it's yelling and cursing and insulting, followed by wrestling and bashing on the head with objects.  At one point (and it IS funny), one of the two is actually buried alive by the other.Reilly and Farrell have limitless energy, but I yearn for the days when Reilly did great work like in MAGNOLIA, and when Farrell actually tried something pitched a more thoughtful level, like STRANGER THAN FICTION.  But I know the paychecks are pretty hefty for these guys...so we seem to be stuck forever with the slightly crazy man-child that is Farrell, and the slightly idiotic man-child that is Reilly.  While I can appreciate a good poop joke or genital joke...just because you mention one of those two things in a line of dialogue doesn't make it a ""good"" joke.  These two guys need to try harder.  The rest of the cast tries gamely enough, and Steenburgen is always a welcome presence.  Richard Jenkins, whom I love, is just a little off-kilter in this.  He's not quite comfortable spouting dialogue that no human would actually say...you can tell the actor in him was lost.By all means, if you're in the mood to turn off the brain and laugh, STEP BROTHERS will do okay.  But the more I think about the film, the less I remember and the less there is to admire.",3,Crude and stupid...but sometimes very funny too.,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,3728,"['recent', 'run', 'Will', 'Farrell', '/', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'films', 'together', 'separate', 'including', 'TALLEDEGA', 'NIGHTS', 'WALK', 'HARD', 'SEMI-PRO', 'BLADES', 'OF', 'GLORY', 'etc', 'STEP', 'BROTHERS', 'most', 'foul-mouthed', 'crude', 'base', 'childish', 'bunch', 'also', 'frequently', 'one', 'funniest.If', 'just', 'want', 'laugh', 'be', 'outraged', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'okay', 'wont', 'feel', 'good', 'morning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'crude', 'obvious', 'humor', 'humor', 'often', 'simply', 'Farrell', 'Reilly', 'trading', 'most', 'obscene', 'threats', 'comments', 'other', 'substance', 'here', 'NO', 'WIT', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'recognizable', 'human', 'beings', 'Whereas', 'shockingly', 'crude', 'movies', '40', 'YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'SUPERBAD', 'have', 'power', 'make', 'jaws', 'drop', 'crassness', 'also', 'showed', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'felt', 'convincing', 'were', 'actually', 'occasionally', 'touching', 'Look', 'such', 'depth', 'STEP', 'BROTHERS.It', 'story', 'two', 'single', '60-somethings', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'meeting', 'getting', 'married', 'living', 'together', 'Unfortunately', 'also', '40', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'never', 'managed', 'move', 'out', 'own', 'Thus', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'together', 'results', 'make', 'hilarity', 'sometimes', '.This', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kids', 'who', 'still', 'live', 'home', 'can', 'save', 'rent', 'have', 'home', 'cookin', 'etc', 'usually', 'see', 'types', 'also', 'working', 'having', 'goals', 'saving', 'up', 'down', 'payment', 'home', 'order', 'move', 'out', 'Reilly', 'Farrell', 'have', 'barely', 'held', 'jobs', 'lives', 'currently', 'have', 'none', 'also', 'have', 'ambitions', 'other', 'vague', 'notions', 'show', 'biz', 'squabbling', 'two', 'becomes', 'worse', 'worse', 'exasperated', 'parents', 'finally', 'draw', 'line', 'giving', 'kids', 'just', 'one', 'month', 'get', 'jobs', 'move', 'out', 'faced', 'goal', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'more', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'thank', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'Farrell', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'successful', 'anything', 'Farrell', 'can', 'imagine', 'also', 'most', 'unmitigated', 'jerk', 'Seeing', 'tiny', 'glimpse', 'why', 'Farrell', 'might', 'be', 'so', 'stunted', 'scenes', 'have', 'squirmy', 'quality', 'cheap', 'shots', 'also', 'found', 'idea', 'Reilly', 'character', 'continuously', 'taunted', 'playground', 'bullies', 'be', 'amusing.But', 'mostly', 'yelling', 'cursing', 'insulting', 'followed', 'wrestling', 'bashing', 'head', 'objects', 'one', 'point', 'IS', 'funny', 'one', 'two', 'actually', 'buried', 'alive', 'other.Reilly', 'Farrell', 'have', 'limitless', 'energy', 'yearn', 'days', 'when', 'Reilly', 'did', 'great', 'work', 'MAGNOLIA', 'when', 'Farrell', 'actually', 'tried', 'something', 'pitched', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'level', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'know', 'paychecks', 'are', 'pretty', 'hefty', 'guys', 'so', 'seem', 'be', 'stuck', 'forever', 'slightly', 'crazy', 'man-child', 'Farrell', 'slightly', 'idiotic', 'man-child', 'Reilly', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'poop', 'joke', 'genital', 'joke', 'just', 'mention', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'line', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'joke', 'two', 'guys', 'need', 'try', 'harder', 'rest', 'cast', 'gamely', 'enough', 'Steenburgen', 'always', 'welcome', 'presence', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'whom', 'love', 'just', 'little', 'off-kilter', 'not', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'spouting', 'dialogue', 'human', 'would', 'actually', 'say', 'can', 'tell', 'actor', 'was', 'lost.By', 'means', ""'re"", 'mood', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'laugh', 'STEP', 'BROTHERS', 'will', 'do', 'okay', 'more', 'think', 'film', 'less', 'remember', 'less', 'admire']",Step Brothers

Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play two developmentally stunted forty-year-olds who still live at home, have apparently never held down a decent job, and possess the emotional maturity of a couple of temperamentally-challenged pre-teens.  When their respective parents get married, Brennan and Dale are suddenly thrust into the role of bedroom-sharing stepbrothers.  It's hate-at-first-sight for the two until Brennan's overbearing and obnoxious brother, Derek (Adam Scott), arrives on the scene, giving the boys an enemy whom they can both finally unite against in common cause.Co-written by Ferrell and Adam McKay and directed by McKay, ""Step Brothers"" is one of those high-concept comedies that runs through its limited bag of tricks in the first five to ten minutes or so, then just keeps repeating itself over and over again for the remaining hour-and-a-half.  Ferrell and Reilly perform their umpteenth variation on the superannuated-adolescent shtick, while Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins struggle hard to maintain some semblance of dignity in the role of the parents.  As with any hit-and-miss comedy, there are a few good laughs to be found in what is otherwise a pretty arid desert of obvious slapstick, flat-footed one-liners and envelope-pushing raunch.If ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"" proved anything last year, it's that crude humor can be both sophisticated and palatable if left to the right hands.

They have no intentions to change their station in life, but they are resentful of each other until they realize just how much they have in common. Chaos ensues as the two team up to make everyone's life impossible.It is always fun to see a movie that was obviously made by people who enjoyed making it. I have no doubt that there were as many laughs behind the scenes as this movie provokes. Thankfully, this movie was rated R and let the boys do some things they would have otherwise been restricted from. Most notable is all of the swearing that is peppered in to punctuate funny moments.

1151898,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00164KYTG,Steve,"[21, 47]","I have generally enjoyed the mindless movies of Judd Apatow, but Step Brothers is simply horrible and nearly unwatchable. It reminds me of a bad SNL routine, those ones that simply linger on and on and on without merciless end. The kind The Simpsons skewered when Krusty was the guest host and they did the Giant Ear Family, ""Ugh! And this goes on for another seventeen minutes!""My dislike has nothing at all to do with the crudeness, the excessive swearing, or even the nut sack on the drum kit component. But unless those things are in the context of a movie with likeable characters, a decent plot, and WAY less annoyance, the overload only works as exacerbation and not amusement. The only two characters who weren't completely loathsome were the two main female roles, played by Mary Steenburgen as Brennan's mother, and Kathryn Hahn as the sister-in-law to that same character. Steenburgen almost pulls off the mother who can't see the destruction in her enabling over-protection and Hahn steals the show as the self-hating, ego punching bag for her horrible husband and their devil children.One of the reviewers said that he forced his wife and sister to watch the whole movie with him just to see if it got better. Two of my kids, both teens, watched it with me and were equally tortured and begging me to terminate the relentless stupidity. As I watched this I keep thinking that it was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen because it made no sense, wasn't funny, and seemed more like a shotgun approach to movie making than anything remotely resembling a fully developed idea. Throw in the completely predictable, and in this case, wildly unhelpful Apatow locker room humor, and you have a bizarre and painful exercise in movie watching. You'd think that with the amount of money being made, they'd try a bit harder. I hope it is simple laziness and not a demonstration of contempt for the audience. I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes next from this clearly self-satisfied group.One thing that I will recommend is the gag reel, which had us laughing until we had tears in our eyes.

You laugh, but then you look around to see if someone noticed, as you don't think you should be laughing.The humor is this film is crude, rude, and even disgusting at times, but it is still funny.  Farrell and Reilly work very well together.  The premise of 40 something's still living at home with enabling parents and aimlessly going through life is totally ludicrous, but that is the point as it is in most Farrell films.

The sons behave as we might expect youngsters in the[...] range would, with a few adult concepts thrown in along the way.  It works fairly humorously during the first part of the film, as there is friction between the would be brothers, and continues to work fairly well even as both boys find they have things in common and actually could be brothers to each other.  Where it falls somewhat flat is when things get just a bit too bad for the boys and their parents in the later portion of the film.  What was funny becomes mostly silly or tragic and just not as funny as it was before, especially in later viewings when you you've seen it all before and don't find yourself laughing as easily.I originally went into viewing this film with low expectations and found myself enjoying the film quite nicely.  Watching the second time, with my expectations not properly lowered, it wasn't as funny as during the first viewing and leaves me lowering the rating from a fairly optimistic 4 stars back to a bit more realistic 3 stars.Will Ferrell fans, or fans of Apatow's films, would probably enjoy this film.  Certainly Ferrell and John C. Reilly have great chemistry and are at ease playing off of each other and sharing time on the screen.  They seem to make the best of a concept that would make a decent short film, but in stretching it to feature length the story seems to get weaker by the end, at least it seems that way after multiple viewings which leaves this more in the 'rent it' category, rather than being 'buy it' level.",3,Seems to flatten as it goes,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2088,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'comedy', 'couple', 'times', 'now', 'once', 'once', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'times', ""'ve"", 'also', 'noticed', 'did', 'spouse', 'seemed', 'lose', 'edge', 'appeal', 'second', 'half.The', 'concept', 'film', 'two', 'sons', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'comfort', 'parents', 'home', 'even', 'middle', 'age', 'are', 'crammed', 'together', 'become', 'step', 'brothers', 'mother', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'get', 'together', 'raised', 'notch', 'having', 'sons', 'live', 'together', 'same', 'room', 'dad', 'house', 'sons', 'behave', 'might', 'expect', 'youngsters', '[', ']', 'range', 'would', 'few', 'adult', 'concepts', 'thrown', 'way', 'fairly', 'humorously', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'friction', 'would', 'be', 'brothers', 'work', 'fairly', 'well', 'even', 'boys', 'find', 'have', 'things', 'common', 'actually', 'could', 'be', 'brothers', 'other', 'Where', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'bad', 'boys', 'parents', 'later', 'portion', 'film', 'What', 'was', 'funny', 'becomes', 'mostly', 'silly', 'tragic', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'before', 'especially', 'later', 'viewings', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'laughing', 'easily.I', 'originally', 'went', 'viewing', 'film', 'low', 'expectations', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Watching', 'second', 'time', 'expectations', 'not', 'properly', 'lowered', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'viewing', 'lowering', 'rating', 'fairly', 'optimistic', '4', 'stars', 'back', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', '3', 'stars.Will', 'Ferrell', 'fans', 'fans', 'Apatow', 'films', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Certainly', 'Ferrell', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'are', 'ease', 'playing', 'other', 'sharing', 'time', 'screen', 'seem', 'make', 'best', 'concept', 'would', 'make', 'decent', 'short', 'film', 'stretching', 'feature', 'story', 'get', 'weaker', 'end', 'least', 'way', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'more', ""'rent"", 'category', 'rather', 'being', ""'buy"", 'level']",Step Brothers

1151907,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00164KYTG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 5]","Okay, so I'm done with Will Ferrell films. The next time I go to see anything with Ferrell attached it will have to have some amazing buzz going for it. The actor/ writer has banked on the success of a few early films for too long. After the one two punch of ""Old School"" and ""Elf"", Ferrell's stardom was cemented and he made ""Anchorman"" with Adam McKay, a buddy of his. Since then, the two have made a series of films, which are basically the same, the premise changing slightly.  Every time, he plays some variation of a man/child, someone who is so full of themselves, they can't help but clash with the rest of the people around them, the normal people, and the laughter and hilarity begin. And you do laugh. For about twenty minutes. As soon as the premise of each film is set-up, the jokes become increasingly scattershot, sophomoric, dumb, repetitive and ill conceived. ""Step Brothers"" is the latest example of this problem.Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (John C. Reilly) are each approaching 40 and more than a little put out their single parents are remarrying. Brennan's mom, Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) moves in with Dale's dad, Robert (Richard Jenkins). Because both of their adult children live with them, Brennan moves in as well and has to share a room with Dale. Both guys have never matured past adolescence, so they begin strutting around trying to outdo one another, making the other cry, the like. Nancy and Robert have plans to save money for a few years, finish the refurbishments on his yacht, then retire and sail the world together. But Brennan's younger brother, Derek (Adam Scott) and his wife and kids pay a visit. Robert immediately falls for Derek's line and agrees to let Derek try to sell their house, making them enough money to retire right away. Nancy is a little alarmed, because Brennan and Dale have nowhere to go, but Robert promises to take care of that. In the meantime, Brennan and Dale realize they have a lot in common and become best friends. Their first goal is to thwart the sale of the house and give Derek trouble. Robert sets up some interviews for Brennan and Dale and when these fail, they decide to set-up their own company, using Brennan's long silent singing skills as the leaping point to make millions.Directed by Adam McKay and co-written by McKay and Ferrell, ""Step Brothers"" has an amusing premise, like all of Will Ferrell's films. But once the premise is set-up, there isn't anywhere else to go. When there isn't anywhere for the story to go, new places and ideas for us to see, the rest of the film simply becomes an exercise in showing more and more situations, trying to get us to laugh at the same things.It is pretty well known that once you have a huge hit or two under your belt, you can pretty much write your own ticket in Hollywood and make whatever films you want to make. Studios will jump into bed with you no matter how crazy the idea. Director and producer Judd Apatow is a recent example of this. After the success of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"", he can pretty much make whatever he wants. And he has flexed this muscle, producing a series of films featuring his friends in starring roles, or putting his name on other comedies. Unfortunately, the quality of these offerings has varied greatly and his name doesn't mean what it once did to me. I was going to pretty much every film he ""produced"" and bought tickets for ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which was very funny, and ""Drillbit Taylor"", which wasn't. Apatow is one of the producers on ""Step Brothers"" and he runs a real danger of becoming exactly what all the critics were hailing him as the savior of, the lackluster, dumb comedies so prevalent in our multiplexes. His comedies were hailed as the second coming and now his name simply means you should take a closer look. ""Pineapple Express"" will be a real test for him, to see if he can produce a film with the same quality as a film he also directs. ""Express"" stars Seth Rogen and James Franco (ex- ""Freaks and Geeks"" alumni) as two potheads who try to elude gangsters and crooked cops and is directed by David Gordon Green. Green is not exactly known for comedy work, he directed ""George Washington"", ""All The Pretty Girls"" and ""Undertow"", but it could make for an interesting film. See? There I go again, trying to be hopeful about another Apatow film.All of Ferrell's films have interesting and unusual premises, ideas so bizarre they make you laugh when you simply think about them. Two male figure skaters, former rivals, must teams up and compete in the pairs competition to win gold. An egotistical newscaster, in the 70s, has to bring the various crazies at his station together to save everyone's jobs when he feels threatened by his new female co-anchor. And ""Step Brothers"" is no exception. The simple idea of two 40-year-old man-children moving in with their parents, sharing a room, is funny. And for about twenty minutes, you may find yourself laughing.Ferrell has played this type of character before as well, so you might expect him to have mastered the role by this point, recognizing the problems inherent with the character. In each of his recent films, he plays an egotistical blowhard or someone who hasn't fully matured or both. The main comic premise is that each of these characters has to adapt or overcome some obstacle in order to survive. The problem is that none of them really change. They stay the same, getting in the same problems, one after another, doing the same things, saving the learning bit until the very end. Because Ferrell's characters never change how can we create a bond with them? In ""Step Brothers"", this moment of change happens very late and seems more artificial than normal and tacked on somehow.John C. Reilly is good as Dale, the stepbrother who has to deal with Brennan when he moves into his house. As the 'child' who has established roots in the house, he is in charge and sets the rules because he has the homecourt advantage. Brennan's lips quiver and he starts crying when Dale becomes too pushy. These small bits are funny. For a few moments. At the same time, each of these guys is an adult, so they are also more mature in their immaturity. There is a funny scene between Dale and his dad, after they have breakfast the morning Nancy and Brenna  are due to arrive. Dale is trying to figure out all of the ways the new living arrangements can give him power over his new brother. And tries to convince his father that Nancy might come on to him.Eventually, the two stepbrothers realize they have a lot in common and begin to play in wild abandon, much like twelve year olds might, which is fitting since this is clearly the intended audience. It is fun to watch them run upstairs, read ""Playboy"" instead of comic books, play silly word games and decide they should build bunk beds.Then the film comes crashing down.Mary Steenburgen plays Nancy, Brennan's mother, and she is fine. But at some point in the film, I expected her to set her foot down, much like her husband does. Instead, she wants to coddle her sons, providing them with a place to live until they are ready. The problem is, they will never be ready unless they are forced to move out. So very quickly you just want to slap Nancy and tell her to snap out of it.Richard Jenkins is better as Robert, Dale's dad. You will probably recognize Jenkins from ""Six Feet Under"" (he played the dead patriarch of the family who would frequently pop up to provide advice to his children or widowed wife) and he recently had a very good lead role in ""The Visitor"", a small independent film that has really caught on with the public. In ""Step Brothers"", he brings a certain goofy charm to the role of Robert. When Derek arrives on the scene, he becomes almost smitten with Nancy's younger son, clearly impressed with everything the young man has accomplished, gushing over him, waiting on baited breath for his next word. And Robert recognizes that his sons are screw ups and need a push out the door.""Step Brothers"" is like all other Will Farrell films; an interesting, unusual, funny premise in search of stronger laughs, better acting and higher production values. ""Step Brothers"" is, ultimately, the type of film you will catch on basic cable, watch for a few minutes and then give up on it. When it is on again, you will probably catch a few other minutes and en give up on it because the phone is ringing. You might catch a laugh or two; you might even end up watching the whole film. But it won't command your attention and it doesn't have a right to.",2,"Same 'Ol, Same 'Ol from Will Ferrell",1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,8576,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'done', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'films',

Perhaps they starred together in this movie after the success of 'Taladega Nights'. But while 'Taladega' is one of the great movies, 'Step Brothers' is so-so. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Ferrell's college slap-stick, you'll probably be wondering how many times saying the f-word is a joke - not to set a moralistic precedent, but just saying that word constantly is hardly a joke in itself - when done for the thousandth time.The behaviour of the two 'step brothers' Dale (Reilly) and Brennan (Ferrell) is more than childish, it's so over the top it stops being funny and starts being absurd.Not that there isn't anything to like about this film, there is. Heaps of the jokes are funny, and even if some of the other characters are bland, Brennan's younger brother Derek adds a bit of spice to the mix. A bit. But more often than not you're left wondering 'why is a 40-year old man acting like a two year old'?

1151910,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00164KYTG,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 2]","Movie - 4.0While I'm only giving the movie itself a 4, I'd like it to be known that this film has a lot of replay value. The juvenile antics that have always made Ferrell such an entertaining actor to me really shine in this one and is probably my 2nd favorite of his films (Stranger than Fiction being #1). The chemistry between him and John C. Reilly is particularly fun to watch. Yes, the comedy is pretty high on the raunch-meter at times, but what did you expect with a screenplay co-written by Ferrell? On top of the wackiness that is Step Brothers, I'll go out on a limb and say I also enjoyed what little essence of a story it had as well. The whole ""don't lose your dinosaur"" metaphor has a very subtle, yet highly effective meaning to me of ""not letting go of what drives you."" I'm sure a lot us have heard the same kind of positive thinking message in other forms, but I think we can sometimes forget that it's alright to let that kid inside of us try to reach for that seemingly impossible goal, such as our version of Dr. Doback's dinosaur or the step brothers' Prestige Worldwide entertainment company. I'd almost go as far to say the end was heartwarming. But alas, this wasn't supposed to be an inspirational movie. It's just a comedy. Or, is it? Oh, and big props to the John Woo dual-spin kick w/ doves shot at the end.Video - 4.5Being a comedy, people may often make the mistake of having very low expectations for a film of this caliber. Though surprisingly enough, the transfer is pretty clean. Colors and flesh tones look very natural and offer a vibrant presentation. Black levels, while not deep, reflect the nature of the film and its somewhat ""rich"" color palette while also helping to compliment a lot of the props. Contrast is well-balanced for the most part, and there's only a little bit of film grain here and there, but oddly enough, very few instances of noise. Image detail in particular is quite sharp highlighting a number of features from the fine curly lines of Ferrell and Reilly's hair to the uh, fine hairs and spots on Ferrell's scrotum (I sure hope that was a fake he used). This probably won't be the first thing that comes to mind when wanting to showcase a Blu-ray setup, but for what the film is, it looks excellent.Audio - 4.5Again, this a comedy, so there's not going to be a whole lot of surround usage. There is, however, quite a bit of musical immersion. The soundtrack subtleties prove to be very well-coordinated in this Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track, and I blame the special feature on disc 2 for exposing this. A good deal of effort was put into the film's musical score, and after watching the film and listening to the music again, it actually fits very well with the overall tone and presentation of the movie's ""story"" material. High and low ends are covered for what few sound effects there are, but again, it works well with the score. And you especially can't leave out ""Ice, Ice Baby"" playing in the background. Not that it's a great representation of the musical genre, but I mean who would've ever thought they'd hear that song again, and in TrueHD, of all things? Dialogue is especially crisp from the center channel, though. I could just ""feel"" the spit splashing on my face as Dale and Brennan were cursing up a storm. The only downfalls to this track, obviously, are the limited usage of sound effects and next to no LFEs outside some of the music and a couple of whooshing effects.Extras - 4.5Here, we get a full single-layer 25GB disc of extras. The making of stuff was good, goofy, and often comical. But of special note are the ""Interview"" segments, of which most were left on the cutting room floor, unfortunately. I won't spoil them for you, but a large majority of them are highly entertaining. Then, of course, is the musical score featurette I mentioned earlier that gives an oddly informative look at how the film was scored, which I think is weird. Composition for a drama or war epic, sure that'd be interesting to hear about, but a raunchy comedy? It just strikes me as odd that I'd be so enamored. It's pretty cool at first, but then devolves into a couple of guys sitting around and playing guitars. The effort, however, is commendable and very unsuspecting for a movie like this.Overall - 4.5It really just comes down to whether or not you're a Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly fan. The overall performances of these two is a fun little romp, if you don't mind a lot of raunchy humor. I also want to commend Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins for letting themselves go on this one and just enjoying the silliness that is Step Brothers. With excellent A/V quality and a great set of extras, I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking to add some diversity to their comedy collection.",5,Step Brothers (Blu-ray),1233273600,"01 30,

It has the ingredients to be very funny:  Will Farrell and John Riley are 40 year olds who still live with their single parents.  Once the parents hook up and get hitched, they're step brothers.  Just typing that has more comedic value than this feature film and what I wrote out wasn't very funny.You start with the script.  I believe I saw that Farrell actually had a hand in the screenplay and that is simply embarrassing.  This is the kind of garbage that could ruin a career in most cases, but when you look at the above names in the initial paragraph, these are the people who can really dig on people licking dried dog poop and a woman going #1 in a urinal in the mens bathroom.  Oh, you want more?  There's no toilet paper, so Will gets up, puts his rear end in the sink and uses a bath mat to wipe off?Unless you're a really lame 8 year old, I can't possibly understand what type of brain power someone must have to think anything is remotely entertaining about it.This is an actual scenario in this movie:  Farrell plays Riley's drums.  Riley gets mad and bashes Farrell in skull with cymbal.  Farrell acts like he's dead.  Riley drags Farrell outside and digs a grave.  Farrell gets up after Riley is in dug grave and hits Riley in head with shovel.  Farrell buries Riley alive.  Riley pops hand out of grave in backyard and crawls out of 7' of dirt.  Expletives proceed.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.  This is genius!!It does have a rare quality in which you're astonished at just how horrendous it is that you have to keep watching to see how much dumber it gets....and BINGO!!!  it succeeds.  I made my wife and her sister stay in the room when they begged for me to turn it off because I promised there's no possible way it could have a running time over an hour and thirty five minutes.  I think I was right even though it does seem like you're watching a 'Lonesome Dove' length mini-series.Your brain will hurt badly.  These guys run around and just group bad words together in a juvenile way.  I guess because it's Will Farrell and he says it, it's funny.  It's not at all.  The parents are even worse as they just sit around and scratch their heads, bewildered that their 40 year old kids are so goofy.I really appreciate Amazon.com and this forum because they don't have to publish these negative ads about a product they'rr selling, but I'm giving the best community service possible, here.

After Brennan&#8217;s mom and Dale&#8217;s dad get married the two men meet for the first time. At first, there was hatred between the two, but after a Dale&#8217;s courageous act against the one they call Derek, things start to turn around for the two stepbrothers and they become best friends. However, their friendship wreaks havoc among their family and Dale&#8217;s dad forces them to apply for jobs and become responsible.Will Ferrell and John Reilly&#8217;s performances with each other were great. This movie had high expectations after the two performed together in Talladega Nights, and it exceeded those expectations. Another interesting fact about the movie is most of it was unscripted, which is amazing that they could come up with the rich material that they did.The most endearing quality of Step Brothers is that it does not try to be anything it isn't. It is a movie with two funny actors doing and saying ridiculous things. There were some materials that may go a little over the top, but that&#8217;s what makes it unique. For example, the fight scene that took place outside. Dale and Brennan got into a fight and by the time Robert (their dad) got home Brennan was using a bicycle and Dale was using a baseball bat as weapons. Things like that make this movie great and such an easier movie to quote as well.I recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a good laugh.&#8220;Shaken, Not Stirred&#8221; Rating: 8.5/10Read more reviews at Bond's Movie Reviews on Facebook",5,Very funny movie,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1602,"['Dale', 'Doback', 'John', 'Reilly', 'Brennan', 'Huff', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'Brennan', '8217', 'mom', 'Dale', '8217', 'dad', 'get', 'married', 'two', 'men', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'was', 'hatred', 'two', 'Dale', '8217', 'courageous', 'act', 'one', 'call', 'Derek', 'things', 'start', 'turn', 'around', 'two', 'stepbrothers', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'However', 'friendship', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'family', 'Dale', '8217', 'dad', 'forces', 'apply', 'jobs', 'become', 'responsible.Will', 'Ferrell', 'John', 'Reilly', '8217', 'performances', 'other', 'were', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'two', 'performed', 'together', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'interesting', 'fact', 'movie', 'most', 'was', 'unscripted', 'amazing', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'rich', 'material', 'did.The', 'most', 'endearing', 'quality', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'anything', ""n't"", 'movie', 'two', 'funny', 'actors', 'doing', 'saying', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'were', 'materials', 'may', 'go', 'little', 'top', '8217', 's', 'what', 'unique', 'example', 'fight', 'scene', 'took', 'place', 'outside', 'Dale', 'Brennan', 'got', 'fight', 'time', 'Robert', 'dad', 'got', 'home', 'Brennan', 'was', 'using', 'bicycle', 'Dale', 'was', 'using', 'baseball', 'bat', 'weapons', 'Things', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'such', 'easier', 'movie', 'quote', 'well.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'good', 'laugh.', '8220', 'Shaken', 'Not', 'Stirred', '8221', 'Rating', '8.5/10Read', 'more', 'reviews', 'Bond', 'Movie', 'Reviews', 'Facebook']",Step Brothers
1151915,AWRGM17GTMND8,B00164KYTG,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[5, 6]","Step Brothers takes the most hysterical route possible.  I never really care for Will Ferrell before this, but he instantly became the funniest guy on earth while watching the first 10 minutes of this film.  I still haven't seen the duo's previous film, but man are they a match made in heaven!  Just when all of us youths thought comedies were predictable and unimpressive, Step Brothers comes out and changes the game completely.  I'll compare it to other recent hilarious films like Judd Apatow's and company, but this by far is the most fun out of all of them.  A perfectly pitched comedy, that literally couldn't be funnier.Now since I displayed my passion for the movie, I'll que you in on the special features of the blu-ray.  Top-notch my friend.  Sony makes great blu-rays unlike Universal, and loads them up with significant segments and tolerable menus.  Out of all the comedy blu-rays I own, this one had one of the best blu-ray set-ups.  Other notable Blu-ray comedies that utilize blu-ray well would include The Hangover, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Pineapple Express.  We want to see unique menus with accessable special features.  Distributors should take notice of this blu-ray and develop their own movies similarily to the way this one was made.There are a lot of movies I like but few I am in love with.  I am in love with Step Brothers, and I could watch it over and over and over again.  It's my favorite comedy, and I'm confident it will be yours.  It impresses you with amazing improvisation and it knows excatly what you want as the audience, something that few comedies can really achieve.  Step Brothers is surely a cult movie that will last throughout years and years.
