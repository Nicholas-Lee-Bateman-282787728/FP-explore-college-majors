558772,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00004Y9PW,Ace-of-Stars,"[3, 3]","*The only complaint arising from reviewers of ''Phantom Quest Corps.'' (''Yuugen Kaisha'') regards the number of episodes provided. I know very little about this series, but it appears somewhat obvious it was intended to be an on-going anime series -- perhaps even with potential plans to release it for American audiences. For some odd reason, however, it would seem that it just never caught on sufficiently enough to inspire a continuation of the series, which is really sad, because it is an excellent and imaginative series which really holds its own against many of its contemporaries!The theme of the series is relatively simple: A red-headed, Enka singing, karaoke addicted, hard drinking 'Party Girl' (not exactly your kids' best role model) who also happens to be an independent businesswoman who chases and, when necessary, extinguishes troublemaking ghosts and goblins and the like, tries to find enough work to turn a profit -- which is rare, considering her habits of partying and compulsive shopping. (Her company is sort of like a ''Kagura'' that hunts more than ''phantom cats'' and without all the big guns and loud explosions.)The stories try not to take themselves too seriously, and the humor is often witty. Some of the most side-splitting moments involve Ayaka's (the main character) morning wake-up ritual, as her young business associate, Mamoru, tries to find more inventive and effective ways to wake up the sleepy-headed brawn of the operation. There is also a little bit of a subplot hinting at a developing mutual romantic interest between Ayaka and a ''U-Division'' detective named Karino.Despite the fact that the stories are often rather hokie, they actually catch and hold your attention and, in the end, have you literally begging for more. On top of all of that, the animation itself is just awsome. It's a piece of history that's worth having.

It's a shame, but Phantom Quest Corp will undoubtedly get passed up for a few reasons. First, the name (which is a literal Japanese translation) simply sounds dumb. Secondly, the price point it was released at makes it appear to be a b-grade title, which it certainly isn't.The set of stories that comprise Phantom Quest Corp are funny, whimsical and can withstand multiple viewings even if they are rather episodic. What complements the stories well are the great extra (omake) material and the animation. PQC's animation is crisp and detailed OAV quality work, not that cheap television-grade stuff. The quality and style of the work more or less gives this series its distinctive irreverent flavor.My only complaint is that, to the best of my knowledge, they never made any more PQC episodes.

Perfect Collection DVD is an incredible buy.  While the storylines may not necessarily be believable, the main feature (split across four episodes) is definitely entertaining, incredibly funny, and has incredible voice-acting in both Japanese AND English.  This latter point is not to be overlooked, as most English dubs of Japanese animation (or of virtually any other media) are extremely pathetic at best, but the English-language voice acting perfectly fits both the individual characters and the overall tone of the series.The special features are impressive for such a low-cost DVD.  Along with the traditional interactive menus and language and subtitle options, an image gallery is provided, along with credit-less opening and closing credits (with lyrics and opening explanatory text in Japanese).  The ""Hidden Frames"" section shows English-language translations of characters' profiles (shown in the feature in Japanese on Mamoru's computer screen) and of various signs seen in the series; this is not nearly as novel as the Information Capsules in the Akira DVD, but the translations are definitely well-done.Unfortunately, the DVD version of the series is missing something I appreciated from my (worn-out) videotape version.

The four relatively self-contained OAV's each revolve around a supernatural mystery that must be solved. The appeal is largely in the characters, the story itself is pleasantly understated. One thing I miss on this DVD are video cultural notes that appeared on the VHS tapes explaining things like ""Natto de Cocoa"" v.s. ""Natto"" and ""Cocoa"" which is a mistake Mr. Karino makes. That sort of subtle humor makes the show so enjoyable, it's too bad if any of it is lost. Great effort was put in to translate many instances of written Japanese, including the employee profiles that fly by the screen to quickly to read but are viewable in the extras. It gives us the opportunity to wonder why a gigolo among others are employed by Phantom Quest, and is a nice touch. A small image gallery and a text-less opening sequence round off the extras.

For an older anime, the animation was quite good. It's about a young woman who is basically a kickbutt paranormal investigator who does jobs for money. It's witty, funny and has quite a few good moments. I wouldn't say it's a must have anime, but is definitely worth the money I paid.

The stories represent the comedy/horror genre rather well.This DVD is a good value, and worth picking up.  &quot;Phantom Quest Corp&quot; may not be the crown jewel of your anime collection, but it is a good thing to pop in around Halloween when you need a chuckle.
