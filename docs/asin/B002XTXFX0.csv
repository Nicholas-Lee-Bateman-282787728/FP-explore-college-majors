I liked the original, and couldn't wait to see how they had developed it for today's audience... I was sorely disappointed.  I didn't feel as though they ever really developed the characters like they did in the original.  It was as though we got snap shots of each, but before we could find out about them, the story had moved on to someone else.  I didn't even remember most of the students names when I left the theatre.  So much for ""Baby remember my name.""  For a prestigious arts school, they were seriously lacking in talent.  The singing was definitely sub par.  They sounded like children.  There was absolutely no warmth to their voices.  Although I'm sure that a couple of them could make it in something like High School Musical, where they don't seem to like trained singers.  The male lead singer sounded like an early teen, wannabe pop star, whose voice hadn't changed yet.  Can he sing out of falsetto? The one girl who was singing with the band was the best singer they had, but she didn't make me say ""Wow!""  The dancing was alright, but nothing special.  They didn't put in any really good choreography, or even any of the really awesome tricks that seem so prevalent in most dance movies.  The acting students weren't memorable enough for me to know what to say about them.  All in all, a sad attempt at remaking a classic.

1298699,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002XTXFX0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","When I saw the trailer for `Fame' I was instantly hooked.  I really wanted to see it.  It was around the time I was indulging in `So You Think You Can Dance' and anticipating everything `gLee' and so I was really caught up in the whole glitzy glam idea of `Fame'.No, I have not seen the original film.The film centers around a bunch of aspiring students attending the New York Arts Academy.  They all want some form of fame, and are reaching out to become the best at what they can be.  The film is told in a series of minor stories that all interconnect mainly because they all take place in the same school.  Sometimes this structure can be awkward since it doesn't give us long enough to connect with each story before shifting focus.  The film is littered with clich&eacute;s and predictable plot lines, all of which we've seen many times before, and the structure of the film is not really all that, well, structured (it really feels like you're watching a music video in parts), but like I mention in my title, this film is far from boring.Is it just me, or would this film have worked better as a television series, like a darker, more serious companion piece to `gLee'?As far as the singing and dancing and all that is concerned, it works pretty well.  Some students (err, actors) have more noticeable talent than others, and some have yet a better understanding of their characters.  The adult actors are a mixed bag for me.  Bebe Neuwirth is best in show, end of discussion.  Her cutting remarks and that last ""you just won't make it"" speech were expertly delivered and emotionally gutting.  Debbie Allen (thankfully) doesn't do much here.  Niether does Kelsey Grammer.  Charles S. Dutton is pretty great in his scenes, especially when he is baiting Collins Pennie (who plays Malik).  Megan Mullally confuses me.  I LOVED her on `Will and Grace'.  I felt she was hilarious.  Here, she goes for dramatic and doesn't really deliver.  I got this strange feeling while watching her that I was watching a `Yaz' commercial, especially at the karaoke bar and she is telling all her students why she teaches.  It felt so forcefully staged.The kids range from awkward (Asher Book) to engaging (Collins Pennie) and then somewhere in between (Kherington Payne, of `So You Think You Can Dance' fame, who really should have had more scenes).For me, one letdown was the script.  There is no originality here.  Every storyline is borrowed from something else.  Every parent is discouraging, whether they are pushing their child to do one thing and one thing only, stripping them of a social life of any brand of `fun', or they are trying to browbeat their child into understanding that `life is hard and fame is nonsense'.  The situations are all too familiar.  You have the girl with the big voice and the father who won't let her use it; the kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants a different life (as a rapper); the girl who takes things so serious she can't relax; the kid who tries to take advantage of the nave girls trust; the girl who's bored with dance so she rebels against her parents strict rules and dates the `bad boy'; the kid who is taken for all his fathers money by a sleazy production studio.  It's all here, and we've seen it all before.  I really wish that a little more effort had been given to breathing fresh air into this genre.That said; the film is still pretty enjoyable.  In fact, I'd watch it again.  I think that validates a C+, right?",3,The opposite of boring...,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,3470,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Fame', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'time', 'was', 'indulging', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'anticipating', 'everything', 'gLee', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'caught', 'up', 'whole', 'glitzy', 'glam', 'idea', ""Fame'.No"", 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'film.The', 'film', 'centers', 'bunch', 'aspiring', 'students', 'attending', 'New', 'York', 'Arts', 'Academy', 'want', 'form', 'fame', 'are', 'reaching', 'out', 'become', 'best', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'told', 'series', 'minor', 'stories', 'interconnect', 'mainly', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'school', 'Sometimes', 'structure', 'can', 'be', 'awkward', ""n't"", 'give', 'long', 'enough', 'connect', 'story', 'shifting', 'focus', 'film', 'littered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'plot', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'structure', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'well', 'structured', 'really', ""'re"", 'watching', 'music', 'video', 'parts', 'mention', 'title', 'film', 'far', 'boring.Is', 'just', 'would', 'film', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'television', 'series', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'companion', 'piece', 'gLee', 'As', 'far', 'singing', 'dancing', 'concerned', 'pretty', 'well', 'students', 'err', 'actors', 'have', 'more', 'noticeable', 'talent', 'others', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'characters', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'best', 'show', 'end', 'discussion', 'cutting', 'remarks', 'last', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'speech', 'were', 'expertly', 'delivered', 'emotionally', 'gutting', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'here', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'pretty', 'great', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'baiting', 'Collins', 'Pennie', 'who', 'Malik', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'LOVED', 'Will', 'Grace', 'felt', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Here', 'dramatic', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver', 'got', 'strange', 'feeling', 'watching', 'was', 'watching', 'Yaz', 'commercial', 'especially', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'telling', 'students', 'why', 'felt', 'so', 'forcefully', 'staged.The', 'kids', 'range', 'awkward', 'Asher', 'Book', 'engaging', 'Collins', 'Pennie', 'then', 'somewhere', 'Kherington', 'Payne', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'fame', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'scenes', '.For', 'one', 'letdown', 'was', 'script', 'originality', 'here', 'storyline', 'borrowed', 'something', 'else', 'parent', 'discouraging', 'are', 'pushing', 'child', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'stripping', 'social', 'life', 'brand', 'fun', 'are', 'trying', 'browbeat', 'child', 'understanding', 'life', 'hard', 'fame', 'nonsense', 'situations', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'have', 'girl', 'big', 'voice', 'father', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'use', 'kid', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'different', 'life', 'rapper', 'girl', 'who', 'things', 'so', 'serious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relax', 'kid', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'nave', 'girls', 'trust', 'girl', 'who', 'bored', 'dance', 'parents', 'strict', 'rules', 'bad', 'boy', 'kid', 'who', 'taken', 'fathers', 'money', 'sleazy', 'production', 'studio', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'wish', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'breathing', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre.That', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'fact', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'think', 'C+', 'right']",N/A
1298700,A1EVD37ULFNOKU,B002XTXFX0,"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector""","[1, 2]","A lot of people on this review compare to the original or make references to the original, I however will not, for I have not seen the original. I went into this movie straight from watching the trailer to sitting in the theater. Now with that out of the way...I am tossed between a 2 star and 3 star rating. I can't say I didn't like at it at all, but I can't exactly say it was just ok. I thought for a 2 hour movie, it showed very little. The dancing and singing were minimal, the character development was non-existent, and I got more out of the trailer than anything.This is a 2 hour movie that depicts (well tries to depict) 4 years in an arts school with about 7 kids. Imagine Harry Potter years 1-4 in a 2 hour movie with twice as many main characters. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! This movie should have been a TV series (as others have suggested) with possible time for story and character development. If TV was out, then it should have been a single year, giving us enough time to enjoy the characters and really understand their hardships. Or it could simply be just 1 or 2 kids' story and have the others shadow them. I think the writers just gave up. They needed a skeleton script to move the movie forward the 4 years, and that's what the director used, a relentlessly drawn out skeleton script, no meat whatsoever.None of these characters I actually cared about, except the bad dancer kid, which was probably the most developed story. The female dancer literally went from not having a boyfriend to having a boyfriend back to not again in 5 scenes, and I wish I could say that the movie gave me surprises, but it was clear that that was going to happen. The actress's problem was solved in the first Sister Act Movie in about 2 seconds (thanks to Whoopi Goldberg), and the singer's problem was taken straight out of Sister Act 2 (Lauren Hill's Character Story), but again was straightened out within a couple weeks (Sister Act 2's movie time) and not 3-4 years (Fame's time). The film students lacked interest (which is a disappointment because that is my area), they should have been removed from the movie all together. The musicians could remain just as they were, 2nd fiddles to the dancer and singer story lines. The male actor probably had the second most developed story, which in Fame terms says a lot.Why 2 stars and not 1. Based on that last Paragraph you may be wondering. The teachers were better characters than the students, so thumbs up from them. I would still like to see a Dangerous Minds type movie made from Megan Mullaly's and Charles S. Dutton's characters. The dance scene I am skewed with because I love Sam Sparro's ""Black and Gold"" song, which is what they danced to. The rendition of the Fame song was great; I listened to that many times before seeing the movie, which consequently made me stop listening to the song. That's about it.Review in a nutshell: Too Many Characters, Not Enough Time but Too Much TIMESPAN, Relentlessly Drawn Out Skeleton Script, Great Teachers, Fame Song Catchy. 2.5 stars",2,"Never saw the original, This one No Meat Whatsoever!",1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,3040,"['lot', 'people', 'review', 'compare', 'original', 'make', 'references', 'original', 'however', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'went', 'movie', 'straight', 'watching', 'trailer', 'sitting', 'theater', 'Now', 'way', 'am', 'tossed', '2', 'star', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'thought', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'showed', 'very', 'little', 'dancing', 'singing', 'were', 'minimal', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'non-existent', 'got', 'more', 'trailer', 'anything.This', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'well', 'depict', '4', 'years', 'arts', 'school', '7', 'kids', 'Imagine', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'years', '1-4', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'twice', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'THINKING', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'series', 'others', 'have', 'suggested', 'possible', 'time', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'TV', 'was', 'out', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'single', 'year', 'giving', 'enough', 'time', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'really', 'understand', 'hardships', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'just', '1', '2', 'kids', 'story', 'have', 'others', 'shadow', 'think', 'writers', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'needed', 'skeleton', 'script', 'move', 'movie', 'forward', '4', 'years', 'what', 'director', 'used', 'relentlessly', 'drawn', 'out', 'skeleton', 'script', 'meat', 'whatsoever.None', 'characters', 'actually', 'cared', 'bad', 'dancer', 'kid', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'developed', 'story', 'female', 'dancer', 'literally', 'went', 'not', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'not', 'again', '5', 'scenes', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'gave', 'surprises', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'actress', 'problem', 'was', 'solved', 'first', 'Sister', 'Act', 'Movie', 'about', '2', 'seconds', 'thanks', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'singer', 'problem', 'was', 'taken', 'straight', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'Lauren', 'Hill', 'Character', 'Story', 'again', 'was', 'straightened', 'out', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'movie', 'time', 'not', '3-4', 'years', 'Fame', 'time', 'film', 'students', 'lacked', 'interest', 'disappointment', 'area', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'movie', 'together', 'musicians', 'could', 'remain', 'just', 'were', '2nd', 'fiddles', 'dancer', 'singer', 'story', 'lines', 'male', 'actor', 'probably', 'had', 'second', 'most', 'developed', 'story', 'Fame', 'terms', 'lot.Why', '2', 'stars', 'not', '1', 'Based', 'last', 'Paragraph', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'teachers', 'were', 'better', 'characters', 'students', 'so', 'thumbs', 'up', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'see', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'type', 'movie', 'made', 'Megan', 'Mullaly', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'characters', 'dance', 'scene', 'am', 'skewed', 'love', 'Sam', 'Sparro', 'Black', 'Gold', 'song', 'what', 'danced', 'rendition', 'Fame', 'song', 'was', 'great', 'listened', 'many', 'times', 'seeing', 'movie', 'consequently', 'made', 'stop', 'listening', 'song', 'about', 'it.Review', 'nutshell', 'Too', 'Many', 'Characters', 'Not', 'Enough', 'Time', 'Too', 'Much', 'TIMESPAN', 'Relentlessly', 'Drawn', 'Out', 'Skeleton', 'Script', 'Great', 'Teachers', 'Fame', 'Song', 'Catchy', '2.5', 'stars']",N/A

The dancing is still incredible, and the characters still hunger for success; you see dreams get crushed, hopes get dashed, and the young hopefuls press on in spite of it.  My favorite number from the film has to be the choreography based on ""Black and Gold"" by Sam Sparro (a little ironic, considering what the subject matter is actually talking about--a man's spiritual beliefs).

1298702,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002XTXFX0,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","2009's ""Fame"" is a decent enough spectacle, but as a story, it seriously disappoints. Unlike the original 1980 film directed by Alan Parker, there's no sense of maturity, no sense of development, and worst of all, no sense of reality--this is essentially an alternate version of ""High School Musical,"" with a plot so whitewashed and characters so clich&eacute; they seem to have been transplanted from an after-school special. One wonders: How closely did director Kevin Tancharoen and writer Allison Burnett study the original film? Did they intend to leave out any degree of substance when recycling specific scenes and ideas? If there's one thing they should have picked up on, it's the fact that Parker's film was not sending a prefabricated message about following your dreams no matter what.They also should have noticed that it didn't try to gloss over unfortunate situations. Consider the scene in which Coco, played by Irene Cara, tearfully strips naked for a sleazy director; shame and [...] weigh heavy, but so does the fact that she's willing to experience both in the hopes of becoming famous. Now compare this to a scene in the new film: Seventeen-year-old Jenny Garrison (Kay Panabaker) is in the trailer of a former boyfriend who's now a working actor, and she haughtily leaves before he has the chance to seduce her on his couch. One of these scenes has genuine emotional power. The other plays like a visual how-to manual for warding off lustful teenage boys. I half expected someone to step into frame, freeze the action, and ask the audience, ""What do you think Jenny should do right now? Should she a) call for help, b) run away, or c) try to talk it out?""The premise is a documentation of four years in the lives of students at the New York City High School of Performing Arts (many look old enough to have graduated college, but never mind). I've already mentioned Jenny, who overloads herself with acting and singing lessons yet lacks the heart and soul both require. This is in direct opposition to her crush, the highly moral Marco (Asher Book), an easy-going young man who doesn't have to try very hard to be a gifted singer. We also meet Denise (Naturi Naughton), who wants to be more than a classical pianist in spite of her controlling father (Julius Tennon) and passive mother (April Grace). Denise secretly provides the vocals for a hip hop group led by Malik (Collins Pennie), a hardened young man who attends P.A. against the wishes of his hard-working, tough-talking mother (Michael Hyatt). And then there's the outgoing Neil (Paul Iacono), an aspiring filmmaker who needs his father to finance his student project.The faculty is headed by Principal Angela Simms (Debbie Allen, paying homage to her role in the 1980 film). There's the stern ballet instructor, Ms. Kraft (Bebe Neuwirth), the scholarly piano teacher, Mr. Cranston (Kelsey Grammer), the fun loving voice teacher, Ms. Rowan (Megan Mullally), and Mr. Dowd (Charles S. Dutton), the acting teacher who believes in his craft so strongly, he doesn't shy away from overly personal exercises like making his student share a painful memory. Each character appears fleetingly and only as a personification of life's lessons. Ms. Kraft, for example, exists primarily as a reminder that passion doesn't always go hand in hand with talent. Ms. Rowan reminds us that, even with talent, dreams sometimes don't come true. Mr. Dowd reminds us that we can only get through life by breaking down walls and allowing ourselves to feel.Part of the problem with this film is that 107 minutes is hardly enough time to cover four years of high school, especially with this many characters. By the end, there isn't the sense that we've gotten to know anyone, certainly not at a level deeper than them wanting to be famous. Then again, most of them are broadly drawn and hardly relatable. Even the way they resolve personal issues lack credibility, and this definitely includes the inevitable confrontation scene between Denise and her parents; the outcome is so grossly implausible, it took a great deal of effort to stop myself from throwing something at the screen.I will give this movie credit for making each production number look and sound really good. The updated cafeteria scene, in which the students spontaneously break into song and dance, is a successful blend of imagery, music, and editing. It works so well that I wish it had gone on longer. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for the final production, seen at the graduation ceremony; what we see is a performance so elaborately designed, so heavily choreographed, and so professionally lit that it's impossible to believe a high school could afford staging it. It doesn't help that the song they sing reiterates the sterile and hopelessly overused message of believing in yourself. Herein lies the great failure of ""Fame"": It's flashy and shallow. If there's any film that doesn't deserve the lyrics, ""I'm gonna live forever, / I'm gonna learn how to fly,"" it's this one.",3,"Isn't Gonna Live Forever, Will Never Learn How to Fly",1253923200,"09

But I betcha that flick was more fun to sit thru than this sack of yawns remake. Irene Cara can rest easy; she's got nothing to worry about. Whatever sense of soul and spirit and joy this new version might have had is relentlessly hammered down by the godawful and choppy screenplay, the listless pace, and the... well, just the sheer underwhelming flavor of it all.The venue is still the very demanding New York City High School of Performing Arts, and there's Debbie Allen still spitting dialogue that could either motivate and inspire a freshman or shatter him to pieces. We're treated to a new class, but a less interesting class. This FAME tracks a core group of students from auditions to graduation, and watching this film, it really did feel like four years had gone by.The students - they're no one you haven't seen before. The tightly-wound theater major (Kay Panabaker, cute but bland), the angry slam poet (Collins Pennie), the dancer who has trouble making the grade except that he tries so damn hard you think he'd catch a break (Paul McGill, and, no, he doesn't), the geeky filmmaker (Paul Iacono), and a few other young actors wearing stereotype hats. Of all the kids, Naturi Naughton stands out the most. She plays Denise, a reserved but gifted classical pianist whose own pipes may be better than her ivory ticklings. Denise's snooty parents are pushing her towards a career in classical music, except that Denise has a secret hankering to belt out songs couched in rhythm and blues and soul and hip hop. Her powerful rendition of ""Out Here on My Own"" serves as one of the very few showstoppers this movie rolls out.That the casting folks decided to have a supporting cast of established veteran actors is a good thing. Familiar old hats like Kelsey Grammer, Charles S. Dutton, Megan Mullally, and Bebe Neuwirth keep the ship afloat. They all turn in excellent performances. One of the most honest scenes in the film features Bebe Neuwirth's dance instructor informing one of her students that he just didn't have the dancing chops to make a career of it. Bebe somehow comes off as brutally upfront and yet caring. Megan Mullally, the voice instructor, turns in the other showstopping number when she karaokes to a Rodgers & Hart standard ""You Took Advantage of Me."" Mullally has got a remarkable and distinctive voice, and hers is perhaps my second favorite musical performance here (and, no, my favorite number isn't by Naturi Naughton). I also liked this movie's messy version of the original cafeteria number.The editing, the uninvolving narrative itself, the teens' earnest but ultimately blah acting... it all boils down to a film that doesn't develop its characters which in turn doesn't pull in the viewer. When you're more interested in the teachers than the featured kids, something has gone all wonky. There's a jarring scattershot element. With four years to cover, the narrative tends to skip ahead scene to scene but without investing quality writing in those scenes. It just feels all over the place, disjointed. And maybe the biggest snafu is the lack of enough showstopping numbers. The big climactic graduation number is all kinds of suck. Even STEP UP 3, with its lame storyline, at least had those dynamic dance routines to redeem itself. What does it say when this FAME's best musical number languishes in the DVD's special features? Check out the FAME National Talent Search Finalists. The winner(s) of that performs ""Out Here on My Own,"" and it is the shiznit.

Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Obviously everybody who has fond, let alone fantastic, memories of the original ""Fame"" is less than pleased, if not bitterly disappointed, by this 2009 rmake.  Actually, the term ""remake"" troubles me in this case because if we have the same place and the same general situation, but different plots and different characters, which does not qualify in my mind as being a remake.  But even if you never saw the original, I doubt that you will find this version to be inspiring, especially if you have been a fan of ""Glee.""  The place is still the High School for the Performing Arts in New York City, and the five-fold division is still the auditions and then the freshman through senior years.  This time around the familiar faces are teachers Charles S. Dutton (acting), Megan Mullally (singing), Bebe Neuwirth (dancing), and Kelsey Grammer (music), with Debbie Allen back again from the original movie upgraded now to principal.  But the adults never get to do much besides spew aphorisms while the youngsters sing, dance and play their way through high school.We get bits and pieces of the lives and talents of these kids, but with one exception, not enough to be inspired to actually root for them.  There are some commonalities between these characters and those in the original movies, but the goal in Allison Burnett's screenplay is to offer vague echoes and shadows of what Christopher Gore came up with back in 1980.  Only when kids burst into song does this movie start to come alive, which is why, in the final analysis, I think that if the songs in this movie were collected as music videoes that might be worth another star in rating.  That makes even more sense when you consider the director, Kevin Tancharoen is a former dancer who has been directing things on TV like ""Britney Spears Live from Miami,"" ""Dancelife,"" and ""The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll.""  I like the music scenes on their own terms, but few of them managed to help propel either the story or the characters along.  A prime example of this would be ""This is My Life,"" which is the song where all of the kids jam in the lunchroom.  Perfectly enjoyable little number, but besides showing the kids are talented and like to perform together, it means nothing for the story.  To be far, I could make the same comment about ""Hot Lunch"" in the original, but the difference is there were a whole bunch of better songs in the original.It is not surprising that the one young member of the cast who stands out way above the rest is Naturi Naughton as Denise.  Essentially she has the Irene Cara role, although what that really means is she sings the two Oscar nominated songs Cara sang, the title song and ""Out Here on My Own.""  The character of Denise is a talented concert pianist, but it turns out she is an even better hip-hop singer, which is not something her daddy is going to want to hear, so basically Denise is living out ""The Jazz Singer,"" if you are old school, and ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,"" is you are new wave.  Naughton also has an advantage in that she is well into her career, having played Little Inez in ""Hairspray"" on Broadway, been one third of the trio3lLW, and having played Lil' Kim in ""Notorious.""  If they had just made a movie about Naughton's character without trying to pass it off as a ""Fame"" remake, that might have worked way better than this film.  So, Naughton's fans might be among the few that would would want to see this version of ""Fame"" more than once.  I am not sure that I ever will, but I do know that I will never own it the way I do the original.",3,"Even if you do not love the original, this ""remake"" fails to earn a passing grade",1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,3596,"['Obviously', 'everybody', 'who', 'fond', 'let', 'alone', 'fantastic', 'memories', 'original', 'Fame', 'less', 'pleased', 'not', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', '2009', 'rmake', 'Actually', 'term', 'remake', 'troubles', 'case', 'have', 'same', 'place', 'same', 'general', 'situation', 'different', 'plots', 'different', 'characters', 'not', 'qualify', 'mind', 'being', 'remake', 'even', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'doubt', 'will', 'find', 'version', 'be', 'inspiring', 'especially', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Glee', 'place', 'still', 'High', 'School', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'five-fold', 'division', 'still', 'auditions', 'then', 'freshman', 'senior', 'years', 'time', 'familiar', 'are', 'teachers', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'acting', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'singing', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'dancing', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'music', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'back', 'again', 'original', 'movie', 'upgraded', 'now', 'principal', 'adults', 'never', 'get', 'do', 'much', 'spew', 'aphorisms', 'youngsters', 'sing', 'dance', 'play', 'way', 'high', 'school.We', 'get', 'bits', 'pieces', 'lives', 'talents', 'kids', 'one', 'exception', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'inspired', 'actually', 'root', 'are', 'commonalities', 'characters', 'original', 'movies', 'goal', 'Allison', 'Burnett', 'screenplay', 'offer', 'vague', 'echoes', 'shadows', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Gore', 'came', 'up', 'back', '1980', 'Only', 'when', 'kids', 'burst', 'song', 'movie', 'start', 'come', 'alive', 'why', 'final', 'analysis', 'think', 'songs', 'movie', 'were', 'collected', 'music', 'videoes', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'star', 'rating', 'even', 'more', 'sense', 'when', 'consider', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Tancharoen', 'former', 'dancer', 'who', 'been', 'directing', 'things', 'TV', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Live', 'Miami', 'Dancelife', 'Pussycat', 'Dolls', 'Present', 'Search', 'Next', 'Doll', 'like', 'music', 'scenes', 'own', 'terms', 'few', 'managed', 'help', 'propel', 'story', 'characters', 'along', 'prime', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'My', 'Life', 'song', 'where', 'kids', 'jam', 'lunchroom', 'Perfectly', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'number', 'showing', 'kids', 'are', 'talented', 'perform', 'together', 'nothing', 'story', 'be', 'far', 'could', 'make', 'same', 'comment', 'Hot', 'Lunch', 'original', 'difference', 'were', 'whole', 'bunch', 'better', 'songs', 'original.It', 'not', 'surprising', 'one', 'young', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'out', 'way', 'rest', 'Naturi', 'Naughton', 'Denise', 'Essentially', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'role', 'what', 'really', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'songs', 'Cara', 'sang', 'title', 'song', 'Out', 'Here', 'My', 'Own', 'character', 'Denise', 'talented', 'concert', 'pianist', 'out', 'even', 'better', 'hip-hop', 'singer', 'not', 'something', 'daddy', 'going', 'want', 'hear', 'basically', 'Denise', 'living', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'are', 'old', 'school', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'Back', 'Habit', 'are', 'new', 'wave', 'Naughton', 'also', 'advantage', 'well', 'career', 'having', 'played', 'Little', 'Inez', 'Hairspray', 'Broadway', 'been', 'one', 'third', 'trio3lLW', 'having', 'played', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'Notorious', 'had', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'Naughton', 'character', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'Fame', 'remake', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'way', 'better', 'film', 'So', 'Naughton', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'would', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'version', 'Fame', 'more', 'once', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'will', 'do', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'own', 'way', 'do', 'original']",N/A

I would love to see it fleshed out as a TV series and get some real developement in characters and plot.Unfortuntely it fell into that unsasifactory category where you saw most of the best dancing\singing parts on the theatrical teasers so you are left with virtually no WOW factors sitting and watching it in the theatre.I was expecting more dancing and singing in the movie as a whole, but found that aspect to be disappointingly skimpy, with few actual ""full"" musical numbers.I do not think they fleshed out any defining plot and came across aimless.  I do not think they developed any one set of characters enough to hook you into any of the many moments they crammed into one film.  They also Cliched too much in this movie.  The Characters, the ""hardships"" the hook-ups most of which felt forced to fit a formula for the movie, the struggles.  No one character carried any full personality, they all seemed cliched and safe.  Part of that I feel, is because they  made it an ensemble cast but  made that core ensemble too large to get any real screen time to feel attached to anyone.I feel like there was soooooo much potential here that was just left undeveloped and instead I was shown an ""outline"" of what could be a great TV series.At time I felt confused as to if they were trying to make it feel like the same time as the origional Fame instead of completely updating it to be a modern twist, but caught todays conviences and clothing style..I LOVED who they picked to be teachers and wanted more from them..

FAME has been an inspiration to several generations of young performers. many of whom populate the boards of Broadway and Regional Theatre, not to mention teaching in performing arts schools, music and drama classes all over the world.  I loved the original movie and, for the most part, the TV program that followed it.  They were full of talent, gritty, sometimes sleazy, and hugely insightful.  The new movie is somewhat less that that.  Although FAME is full of talent, (specifically Naturi Naughton,  and Collins Pennier), the grit of living in New York, all hut cleaned-up white collar sho-biz sleaze, and most of the insight is missing.  I got the impression that a lot of magic was left in the editing room.Several of the relationships were incomplete, like the gay boy, the asian actress (the charming Anna Maria Perez del Tagle) and the fabulous blonde dancer (Kherington Payne from SYTYCD), who only had 2 brief scenes.  The only slightly more developed characters were Jenny (Kay Panabaker) who actually aged from a freshman to a senior, and to a lesser degree, Marco, the best male singer in the group (Asher Brooks).  The big vocal discovery, Denise (Naturi Naughton) had lots of singing but little growth.  If she is as good an actress as she is a singer, a star had been born.The teachers were treated as cameos and virtually ignored, maybe because that are all accomplished actors and the audience knows them already. Debbie Allen, who was an anchor of the original FAME, was virtually invisible. However it was good to see the acting teacher (Charles S. Dutton) giving good advice to his students as opposed to the hateful Simon Cowell on ""American Idol"" who delights in belittling performers.  Megan Mullally who sings quite well was a sweet surprise. I wanted to know more about all the characters some of whom were introduced and then abandoned until the somewhat disappointing graduation scene.  I can't wait for the Director's Cut.All that being said, FAME is still an inspiration and is worth the price and the time.  It is fun from the first note to the last leap and I recommend it highly.  Everybody in it is a treat to watch.  It reminded me of picking my daughter up from OCHSA (Orange County High School of the Arts--the PA of the OC).You might still be hungry for more when you come out of the theatre, so do yourself a favor and rent the original FAME after you see this one--but not before.",4,FAME lite,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2560,"['Having', 'spent', 'better', 'part', 'last', '30', 'years', 'Arts', 'Education', 'have', 'disclose', 'am', 'not', 'impartial', 'viewer', 'film', 'FAME', 'been', 'inspiration', 'several', 'generations', 'young', 'performers', 'many', 'whom', 'populate', 'boards', 'Broadway', 'Regional', 'Theatre', 'not', 'mention', 'teaching', 'performing', 'arts', 'schools', 'music', 'drama', 'classes', 'world', 'loved', 'original', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'TV', 'program', 'followed', 'were', 'full', 'talent', 'gritty', 'sometimes', 'sleazy', 'hugely', 'insightful', 'new', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'less', 'FAME', 'full', 'talent', 'specifically', 'Naturi', 'Naughton', 'Collins', 'Pennier', 'grit', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'hut', 'cleaned-up', 'white', 'collar', 'sho-biz', 'sleaze', 'most', 'insight', 'missing', 'got', 'impression', 'lot', 'magic', 'was', 'left', 'editing', 'room.Several', 'relationships', 'were', 'incomplete', 'gay', 'boy', 'asian', 'actress', 'charming', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Perez', 'del', 'Tagle', 'fabulous', 'blonde', 'dancer', 'Kherington', 'Payne', 'SYTYCD', 'who', 'only', 'had', '2', 'brief', 'scenes', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'developed', 'characters', 'were', 'Jenny', 'Kay', 'Panabaker', 'who', 'actually', 'aged', 'freshman', 'senior', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Marco', 'best', 'male', 'singer', 'group', 'Asher', 'Brooks', 'big', 'vocal', 'discovery', 'Denise', 'Naturi', 'Naughton', 'had', 'lots', 'singing', 'little', 'growth', 'as', 'good', 'actress', 'singer', 'star', 'had', 'been', 'born.The', 'teachers', 'were', 'treated', 'cameos', 'virtually', 'ignored', 'maybe', 'are', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'audience', 'already', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'who', 'was', 'anchor', 'original', 'FAME', 'was', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'However', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'acting', 'teacher', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'giving', 'good', 'advice', 'students', 'opposed', 'hateful', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'American', 'Idol', 'who', 'delights', 'belittling', 'performers', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'who', 'quite', 'well', 'was', 'sweet', 'surprise', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'whom', 'were', 'introduced', 'then', 'abandoned', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'graduation', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Director', 'Cut.All', 'being', 'said', 'FAME', 'still', 'inspiration', 'price', 'time', 'fun', 'first', 'note', 'last', 'leap', 'recommend', 'highly', 'Everybody', 'treat', 'watch', 'reminded', 'picking', 'daughter', 'up', 'OCHSA', 'Orange', 'County', 'High', 'School', 'Arts', 'PA', 'OC', '.You', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'hungry', 'more', 'when', 'come', 'theatre', 'so', 'do', 'favor', 'rent', 'original', 'FAME', 'see', 'one', 'not', 'before']",N/A
