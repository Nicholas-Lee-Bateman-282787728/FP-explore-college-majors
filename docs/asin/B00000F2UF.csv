496948,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B00000F2UF,AbeStreet,"[2, 4]","This movie came and went relatively quickly at the theaters. I was skeptical to watch it. I finally rented this film and what a treat. I am a big fan of WWII films. As far as POW films go this was on par with STALAG 17 and THE GREAT ESCAPE. The camp seemed have the same layout as the two movies I mentioned above but the buildings seemed to be worn down and more in line with what a prison camp would be like. I've spent time in Norway. It seems that you are always in the shadow of some mountain and it creates a dark depressing atmosphere. I thought the way the director captured the dark winter was just right.I'm not a big fan of Colin Farrell but thought he did a fine job as did all the actors. Bruce Willis has worked hard to shed his action image and it has paid off. For a movie just over 2 hours I think it does quite well to include a murder mystery, racial confrontations, prison escape and a courtroom drama. This film is well worth a view! I may try and get the book the film is based on and read it.The DVD offers good special features.  A decent commentary with an actor, director and production staff member, trailers and a documentary.  All in all this is a good film that received good attention from the DVD producers.",4,Unexpectedly Good WWII POW film!!,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,1239,"['movie', 'came', 'went', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'theaters', 'was', 'skeptical', 'watch', 'finally', 'rented', 'film', 'what', 'treat', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'WWII', 'films', 'As', 'far', 'POW', 'films', 'go', 'was', 'par', 'STALAG', '17', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', 'camp', 'seemed', 'have', 'same', 'layout', 'two', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'buildings', 'seemed', 'be', 'worn', 'down', 'more', 'line', 'what', 'prison', 'camp', 'would', 'be', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'time', 'Norway', 'are', 'always', 'shadow', 'mountain', 'dark', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'thought', 'way', 'director', 'captured', 'dark', 'winter', 'was', 'just', 'right.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'worked', 'hard', 'shed', 'action', 'image', 'paid', 'off', 'movie', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'think', 'quite', 'well', 'include', 'murder', 'mystery', 'racial', 'confrontations', 'prison', 'escape', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'film', 'well', 'view', 'may', 'try', 'get', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'read', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'decent', 'commentary', 'actor', 'director', 'production', 'staff', 'member', 'trailers', 'documentary', 'good', 'film', 'received', 'good', 'attention', 'DVD', 'producers']",Hart's War

It's more or less a remake of The Great Escape (1963), but instead of the comic Escape (a la Hogan's Heroes), Hart's War takes on a more serious, dramatic element (which isn't to belittle the Nazi POW comedy, I personally liked Great Escape more). There are well done performances by Willis and Farrell--very low key--but the truly great performance in this film is Marcel Iures as the Nazi camp commandant. He manages to keep from being a cliche and humanizing what would normally be portrayed as a 'monster.' You even find yourself liking the man.

496951,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00000F2UF,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 10]","Welcome to a new style of reviews.  For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring.  Today marks a day of change.  I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing.  Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans - but for me, it is still all about the cinema.War, really people, what is it good for?Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film ""Hart's War"", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his ""luxury"" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.Did I hint towards ""The Great Escape"" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes ""Hart's War"" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, ""You can't handle the truth"", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.How bland.""Hart's War"" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, ""oh brother!"".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved ""Fallen"" so very much.  ""Hart's War"" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?To my reply ... absolutely nothing.I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give ""Hart's War"" a(wait for it ...)BLAH!",2,Wet Willis' for everyone!,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,4070,"['Welcome', 'new', 'style', 'reviews', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'career', 'comments', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'lengthy', 'verbose', 'times', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Today', 'day', 'change', 'am', 'finding', 'less', 'time', 'energy', 'dedication', 'cause', 'am', 'changing', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'fall', 'wayside', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'fans', 'still', 'cinema.War', 'really', 'people', 'what', 'good', 'Apparently', 'involved', 'creation', 'film', 'Hart', 'War', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'need', 'say', 'again', 'be', 'short', 'sweet', 'pretty-boy', 'Farrell', 'caught', 'Nazi', 'dirty', 'secret', 'somehow', 'put', 'posh-of-the-posh', 'POW', 'containment', 'camps', 'side', 'Germany', 'brutality', 'murder', 'starvation', 'just', 'simple', 'catered', 'meals', 'freedom', 'other', 'Willis', 'Colonel', 'somehow', 'was', 'captured', 'named', 'base', 'luxury', 'suite', 'best', 'friends', 'Nazi', 'commander', 'time', 'planning', 'big', 'escape.Did', 'hint', 'towards', 'Great', 'Escape', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'same', 'thoughts', 'film', 'What', 'Hart', 'War', 'bit', 'more', 'random', 'typical', 'war', 'film', 'bigotry', 'hatred', 'racism', 'not', 'Nazis', 'American', 'soldiers', 'form', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'One', 'time', 'racism', 'dirty', 'head', 'people', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'second', 'time', 'melodramatic', 'off-the-beaten-path', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'assortment', 'regular', 'films', 'nothing', 'new', 'anything', 'interest', 'Continually', 'wait', 'Howard', 'Willis', 'shout', 'cult-like', 'phrase', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'truth', 'nearly', 'when', 'Willis', 'wild', 'card', 'course', 'war', 'forever.How', 'bland', 'Hart', 'War', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'maybe', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'Instead', 'sticking', 'war', 'story', 'are', 'bludgeoned', 'story', 'racism', 'story', 'respect', 'story', 'lies', 'jumbled', 'story', 'escape', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'handle', 'characters', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'dimensional', 'film', 'Willis', 'Willis', 'have', 'seen', 'work', 'decade', 'have', 'seen', 'character', 'film', 'Farrell', 'shaved', 'pretty-boy', 'film', 'continually', 'denouncing', 'authenticity', 'was', 'already', 'faulted', 'fact', 'seemed', 'nobody', 'was', 'anyone', 'camp', 'think', 'what', 'struck', 'odd', 'layout', 'camp', 'Why', 'were', 'Russians', 'treated', 'worse', 'Americans', 'Did', 'not', 'have', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'own', 'Questions', 'questions', 'continue', 'pile', 'think', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'then', 'world', 'final', 'act', 'giving', 'reason', 'yell', 'oh', 'brother', 'ending', 'lacks', 'consistency', 'are', 'left', 'resolutions', 'finale', 'moment', 'Zen', 'perfect', 'Willis', 'nay-slayers', 'there', 'rest', 'are', 'left', 'symbolic', 'ending', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'women', 'rest', 'demanding', 'money', 'back.This', 'film', 'contained', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'very', 'little', 'answers', 'bigger', 'underlining', 'questions', 'was', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'boasted', 'big', 'names', 'bigger', 'downfalls', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'plummeted', 'everything', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'think', 'throw', 'film', 'believe', 'had', 'potential', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'control', 'momentum', 'strange', 'loved', 'Fallen', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'Hart', 'War', 'did', 'start', 'strong', 'eyes', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'snow', 'scene', 'fell', 'face', 'Earth', 'end', 'first', 'hour.So', 'again', 'friends', 'must', 'ask', 'what', 'war', 'good', 'reply', 'absolutely', 'nothing.I', 'can', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'friends', 'family', 'Poor', 'acting', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'unresolved', 'ending', 'give', 'Hart', 'War', 'wait', 'BLAH']",Hart's War
496952,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000F2UF,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","For a film that, for the most part actually works, there are just too many flaws here to regard it as a good film.  The acting is convincing, especially from Willis and Farrell, and the overall feel of the film is intriguing (for the most part), but the lack of logical plotting and human depth leave the film feeling cold, distant; stagnant.The film centers around a POW camp where a young black pilot is accused of murdering a fellow prisoner.  A young law-student lieutenant shares the camp, and thus attempts to exonerate the man he believes innocent.  He then, obviously, uncovers the truth.First of all, do not come into this expecting an action film.  Just because the word `War' is in the title does not mean that this is going to be `Saving Private Ryan'.  The opening sequence has its fair share of excitement, but the `War' being spoken of in the film title is an internal war, a struggle for justice that Lieutenant Hart strives to attain.  So, if you are disappointed with the films `flow' then you should reevaluate your expectations of this particular film.With that out of the way, for me this is a mixed bag.  I had a hard time swallowing a lot of the plot developments and the way that the characters themselves are developed.  A lot of the personality switches didn't make sense to me, especially not in the `extremes' with which a lot of the characters were painted.  There was a lack of balance used in developing the characters from the inside out.  That said, the acting was a saving grace because you had actors who really attempted to dig a little deeper and bring a shred of credibility to their implausible characters.But even some good acting couldn't elevate the films emotional stagnancy, which is a shame because that is the most important aspect of a film (unless the artistic viewpoint requires an emotional detachment).  With a film like `Hart's War', one needs to become a part of the action, part of the story and I just didn't feel like that was happening with this film.  It didn't connect in the way I wanted it to.The film becomes forgettable.",3,The film feels slightly stagnant...,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,2083,"['film', 'most', 'part', 'actually', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'here', 'regard', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'convincing', 'especially', 'Willis', 'Farrell', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'intriguing', 'most', 'part', 'lack', 'logical', 'plotting', 'human', 'depth', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'cold', 'distant', 'film', 'centers', 'POW', 'camp', 'where', 'young', 'black', 'pilot', 'accused', 'murdering', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'young', 'law-student', 'lieutenant', 'shares', 'camp', 'thus', 'attempts', 'exonerate', 'man', 'innocent', 'then', 'obviously', 'truth.First', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'expecting', 'action', 'film', 'Just', 'word', 'War', 'title', 'not', 'mean', 'going', 'be', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'opening', 'sequence', 'fair', 'share', 'excitement', 'War', 'being', 'spoken', 'film', 'title', 'internal', 'war', 'struggle', 'justice', 'Lieutenant', 'Hart', 'attain', 'So', 'are', 'disappointed', 'films', 'flow', 'then', 'should', 'reevaluate', 'expectations', 'particular', 'film.With', 'way', 'mixed', 'bag', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'lot', 'plot', 'developments', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'lot', 'personality', 'switches', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'especially', 'not', 'extremes', 'lot', 'characters', 'were', 'painted', 'was', 'lack', 'balance', 'used', 'developing', 'characters', 'inside', 'out', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'had', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'attempted', 'dig', 'little', 'deeper', 'bring', 'shred', 'credibility', 'implausible', 'characters.But', 'even', 'good', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'films', 'emotional', 'stagnancy', 'shame', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'film', 'artistic', 'viewpoint', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'film', 'Hart', 'War', 'one', 'become', 'part', 'action', 'part', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'happening', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'way', 'wanted', 'film', 'becomes', 'forgettable']",Hart's War

Willis' character may have seemed one dimensional to some but his role required someone who was stern and dead serious (he was not suppose to be likeable and gung ho as in his Die Hard films... Willis is older and wiser now). And the real character twist was the Nazi comandant of the POW camp who seemed a little laxed in character and not befitting of the stereo typical film Nazi.

For me the problems with the plot here really strain the credibility of everything else, and although I liked the performance of all concerned, I found myself impatient at points because it all seemed far too contrived. Having said this, the acting is uniformly good, and I found that to be the one redeeming feature of the film.Colin Farrell is especially good here, and acting out the title role lends credibility and verve to the film. Likewise, Marcel Lures does a good job convincing us he is indeed an evil and manipulative Camp Commander. Bruce Willis is also terrific as the by-the-book West Point graduate and Prisoner Commander who must decide whether or not to intercede to save Hart from his existential situation. Given his willingness to let one man die for the good of many, the choice he must make is by no means a foregone conclusion.The action sequences are extremely well choreographed and photographed, and while the plot reels from happenstance to happenstance all too conveniently to be believed, the film is entertaining and intriguing in bringing up social issues one does not ordinarily think about in terms of the Second World War. While this isn't intended as a serious drama, it is a good action flick that will keep you entertained if you don't allow the potboiler plot to get in the way.

Prisoners get shot, blood flies everywhere, planes from above shoot the people below in graphic fashion, a generic looking explosion, establishing the main characters... but then the film gradually morphs into Law & Order: the Movie.I can't recall the last time I seen a plot fall completely on its behind like this one did. Bruce Willis as one of the main characters or not, this movie stinks thanks entirely to the plotline.Why focus on the real, interesting events that took place during World War II when we can have some kind of melodramatic courtroom scene dragging out for the entire length of the film? Why focus on the real-life cruelty imposed by the Germans in a war that actually happened when instead we can be treated to a storyline that deals with skin color, prosecution and an unbelievable, makeshift jury system that the Germans themselves actually seemed to enjoy (because they sat around and watched it take place the entire time)?Was any of this supposed to be believable?  I don't get it.  Did the Germans really admire the American jury system and thought it was legitimate and fair, and *that* was the idea behind making this movie?

The people who adapted the novel obviously know nothing of World War II prison camps in the Third Reich. Each branch of the armed forces had its own prison camp.  In 'Hart's War,' only flyers were held in the pow camp, no infantry or navy. What I enjoyed about the book was the character development among the prisoners and the Germans which led to a very realistic conclusion, which unfortunately, was completely lacking in the movie. The characters were changed; the incidents were changed; and the development of the plot was changed, so much, the movie does not resemble the novel. The exchange between Farrel and Howard is critical to the story line, and it is completely lacking in the movie, so much, that the movie makes no sense. Even turning the Commandant of the pow camp into a sadistic German is laughable: it did not happen in pow camps. The Commandants were usually retired or disabled German officers of the branch that held the prisoners, and they respected their prisoners. The SS were used in concentration camps.  The pathos was gone entirely from the novel in this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie a turkey, and even that is too high.  The movie makes no sense; to fully understand the movie one must read the book--this will lead the reader to the conclusion that the movie is a horrible mishmash of nonsense.

HART'S WAR suffers from some of the worst marketing in cinematic history.  Bruce Willis, as POW Commander Colonel William McNamara, is a second tier character in this film.  This is not a Bruce Willis ""action"" flick--although his character has a seminal moment as the movie comes to its heart-pounding conclusion.  HART'S WAR is the story of Lieutenant Thomas Hart (one of Colin Farrell's finest roles, in my opine), a law student picked by Col. McNamara to defend an African-American officer (Terrence Howard) on court martial for the murder of a racist Sergeant (Cole Hauser).  The court martial takes place in a German POW camp, and is carefully supervised by camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  And be on the lookout for a bit part played by a very young Sam Worthington.  The young Lt. Hart initially thinks the court martial is a kangaroo court, with McNamara pulling all the strings.  But could all of this be a ruse for something more significant for the entire camp--and the war effort?  And is McNamara willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for his men?  These are resounding questions that are emphatically answered in this dramatic thriller.Farrell and Howard are outstanding as defender and defendant facing what appears to be overwhelming obstacles based on entirely circumstantial evidence.  And every time they score points with the jury, McNamara throws another roadblock in their way.  If you like courtroom drama, augmented by exceptional acting, HART'S WAR is definitely for you. Again, Willis is a secondary character, but he also gives a solid performance as a stubborn, apparently single-minded, commander.  The film does take a while to get going, but once the court martial is in place, with the interactions of all the major players, HART'S WAR is an exhilarating thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.--D.

Mostly well acted, pretty well scripted, and within the realm of what most of us, who were not in prisoner of war camps, can accept as real, I think this will involve people for whom war films are not anathema.

Not only is it NOT the Bruce Willis you're expecting, but also this movie presents an outstanding international ensemble cast set with a background of the end of World War II. However, it is much more than ""just another"" WWII movie, because it deals with issues of racism in the mid-20th century, questions assumptions about that nature of veterans of the German Army, and will leave you wondering (hopefully) about how much you DON'T know about this crucial period in our nations history. A large percentage of our population doesn't even remember the Cold War, yet this film is set in a time when the USSR was our ally, and as brilliantly focused in the film, the United States PURPORTED not to distinguish between Blacks, Russians, or person's of other ""ethnicity."" While some Germans tried to solve the problem of multiple identities by creating one super-identity, the Aryan or Uebermensch. Great cast, highly authentic costuming, set in winter and you feel it (despite some fake snow), superb sountrack reinforces the story which has several surprising twists and turns!

496973,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00000F2UF,"""flickjunkie""","[7, 7]","It is hard to imagine a more contrived story than this WWII POW film.  There are just so many unrealistic plot elements that the story loses all credibility.  Director Gregory Hoblit, (""Frequency"", ""Primal Fear"") has delivered good dramatic films in the past, but this one simply loses its grip on reality.  While the production values are excellent, Hoblit doesn't seem to notice or care that plot and the behavior of his characters range from inconsistent to implausible.Take Colonel Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  The workup on him shows him to be evil, intolerant, cruel and autocratic and those are his nicer qualities.  Then suddenly, for no reason we can discern, he develops a soft spot for Lt. Hart (Colin Farrell).  This is a conniving, manipulative, hard hearted creature and just because he went to the same college as Hart, he becomes his avuncular advisor and benefactor.  Let's get real here.Yes, and I am sure they are going to send a lieutenant assigned to headquarters and privileged to strategic information, who has never been in combat, to shuttle another officer to the front lines so he can get captured and spill his guts to the enemy.  That detail would have been given to a non commissioned officer with no exposure to such intelligence.The one bright spot in this film is the acting of Colin Farrell.  Farrell combines rugged good looks and excellent dramatic skills to bring this film whatever shred of credibility it has.  He manages to make his character believable, despite the unbelievable nature of everything that is going on around him.  Bruce Willis gets top billing in this film, but doesn't log 20% of the screen time that Farrell commands.  Willis plays the hard shelled West Point officer well, although his switch from heartless malevolence to heroic nobility is just a bit too abrupt to accept.Everything about this film stretches credulity.  By the end of the film, my eye sockets were sore from all the eye rolling.  I rated it a 5/10.

496975,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00000F2UF,Get What We Give,"[0, 0]","Hart's War isn't unwatchable, but it isn't good either.Why Bruce Willis is the primary actor listed in the credits speaks more to his declining fame than his role in this film (typically an actor who receives top billing does so for a reduction in salary).Midway through this WWII potboiler, I expected to hear the theme music from ""Hogan's Heros"" and have the actors visages flash up on the screen. Hogan's Heros was a comedic take on a serious and excellent film: Stalag 17. Hart's War incorporates aspects of Stalag 17 and then adds in parts of To Kill A Mockingbird for good measure. Based on a book, I suppose I'm also critiquing that novel's content as well.So what's my critique? How could I not like a film (and book) that are so politcally relevant and emotionally draining as a story of white and black prejudice set against an even greater evil of Naziism? Oh, puleese!I thought I was going to see a fair to good WWII drama, but then I was duped by the filmmakers into a racism drama that typically casts the poor put upon black man in a role that he can do nothing but become a hero as a result of circumstances put upon him. Don't get me wrong - black men have been dealt a poor hand for a long time, but this film doesn't cover new territory and it doesn't tell a story that is unique: it feels stale and overcooked. The black character at the heart of this story could have just as well been cast and written as an American Indian, a Jew, a homosexual, or any other minority group and it would have worked as effectively.If it seems that I am a bit ticked off - you'd be right. I don't have a problem with the role of prejudice being identified and played on in a film, but it doesn't have to be handled in some a heavy and ham-handed way as Hart's War lays it out.Our narrator is apparently some sort of saint (but he is also a bit of a coward in that he gives up U.S. secrets for his own safety - a plot point which dies on the vine in lieu of the racist subject matter) because he's the only white man in the entire prison camp who isn't a racist.The characters in this film are sketches - two dimensional sketches. They are either good or they are bad. No one has multi-layered personalities. The camp bigot is not only a bigot but he is a traitor! The captain is not only a hardcase, but he has ulterior motives that may be bigotry and probably include selling out the camp saint in addition to the black man. The narrator (saint), though he committed treasonous acts, is to be completely forgiven because he is in support of the camp's only black resident. People are not all bad and people are not all good. There are many a murderer out there who are extremely good to their mothers, but who would gun you down without thinking twice.Surprisingly, the Nazis don't come off as hideously evil as the typical Hollywood film would portray them. The Commandant of the camp is intelligent and suspicious, and even a bit self-serving, but that would be expected in war. The Nazis are actually cast more believable than any of the Americans.I would love to see Hollywood address racism with more subtly than this. I think it is a point that deserves attention, but I think that we have also moved beyond the point when it has to be shoved down our throats as Hart's War does.Photograhed beautifully, and yet not unlike Stalag 17 and Hogan's Heros (it's always winter in these prison camp shows - you know Germany is actually quite beautiful in the summer - you'd think that such a contrast might sometime be brought out in these war pictures), Hart's War is sadly a poor rehash of material previously covered in Stalag 17 and To Kill A Mockingbird.",1,Hart's War: a Poor Man's Stalag 17,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,3663,"['Hart', 'War', ""n't"", 'unwatchable', ""n't"", 'good', 'either.Why', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'primary', 'actor', 'listed', 'credits', 'more', 'declining', 'fame', 'role', 'film', 'typically', 'actor', 'who', 'top', 'billing', 'so', 'reduction', 'salary', '.Midway', 'WWII', 'potboiler', 'expected', 'hear', 'theme', 'music', 'Hogan', 'Heros', 'have', 'actors', 'visages', 'flash', 'up', 'screen', 'Hogan', 'Heros', 'was', 'comedic', 'take', 'serious', 'excellent', 'film', 'Stalag', '17', 'Hart', 'War', 'aspects', 'Stalag', '17', 'then', 'parts', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'good', 'measure', 'Based', 'book', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'also', 'critiquing', 'novel', 'content', 'well.So', 'what', 'critique', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'film', 'book', 'are', 'so', 'politcally', 'relevant', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'story', 'white', 'black', 'prejudice', 'set', 'even', 'greater', 'evil', 'Naziism', 'Oh', 'puleese', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'fair', 'good', 'WWII', 'drama', 'then', 'was', 'duped', 'filmmakers', 'racism', 'drama', 'typically', 'poor', 'put', 'black', 'man', 'role', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'become', 'hero', 'result', 'circumstances', 'put', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'black', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'poor', 'hand', 'long', 'time', 'film', ""n't"", 'cover', 'new', 'territory', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'unique', 'stale', 'overcooked', 'black', 'character', 'heart', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'cast', 'written', 'American', 'Indian', 'Jew', 'homosexual', 'other', 'minority', 'group', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'effectively.If', 'am', 'bit', 'ticked', 'off', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'role', 'prejudice', 'being', 'identified', 'played', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'handled', 'heavy', 'ham-handed', 'way', 'Hart', 'War', 'out.Our', 'narrator', 'apparently', 'sort', 'saint', 'also', 'bit', 'coward', 'up', 'U.S.', 'secrets', 'own', 'safety', 'plot', 'point', 'vine', 'lieu', 'racist', 'subject', 'matter', 'only', 'white', 'man', 'entire', 'prison', 'camp', 'who', ""n't"", 'racist.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'sketches', 'two', 'dimensional', 'sketches', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'bad', 'one', 'multi-layered', 'personalities', 'camp', 'bigot', 'not', 'only', 'bigot', 'traitor', 'captain', 'not', 'only', 'hardcase', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'may', 'be', 'bigotry', 'probably', 'include', 'selling', 'out', 'camp', 'saint', 'addition', 'black', 'man', 'narrator', 'saint', 'committed', 'treasonous', 'acts', 'be', 'completely', 'forgiven', 'support', 'camp', 'only', 'black', 'resident', 'People', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'murderer', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'mothers', 'who', 'would', 'gun', 'down', 'thinking', 'twice.Surprisingly', 'Nazis', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'hideously', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'would', 'portray', 'Commandant', 'camp', 'intelligent', 'suspicious', 'even', 'bit', 'self-serving', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'war', 'Nazis', 'are', 'actually', 'cast', 'more', 'believable', 'Americans.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'address', 'racism', 'more', 'subtly', 'think', 'point', 'attention', 'think', 'have', 'also', 'moved', 'point', 'when', 'be', 'shoved', 'down', 'throats', 'Hart', 'War', 'does.Photograhed', 'beautifully', 'yet', 'not', 'Stalag', '17', 'Hogan', 'Heros', 'always', 'winter', 'prison', 'camp', 'know', 'Germany', 'actually', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'summer', ""'d"", 'think', 'contrast', 'might', 'sometime', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'war', 'pictures', 'Hart', 'War', 'sadly', 'poor', 'rehash', 'material', 'previously', 'covered', 'Stalag', '17', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird']",Hart's War

But the more the movie progressed the better it got because each character was incredibly multi-faceted and thought-provoking. Colin Farrell plays Lieutenant Hart, a former law student who now has to use what little schooling he received  to defend Lieutenant Scott (Terrence Howard), a pilot who is being forced to be the patsy in a military murder trail. This is the first movie I have ever seen with Colin Farrell and I was very impressed with him because his emotions run the gamut of everything from enraged to terrified to shocked with such percision and complexity. As usual Bruce Willis (as Colonel McNamara) was perfect. Although the part is considerly smaller compared to Colin Farrell, Bruce sort of walked away with this movie because he is really the most memorable. What that man can accomplish with his eyes few men can do with their entire bodies. And every word out of his mouth was so real and dramatic that I probably would have thought that I was watching a period documentary (if only I hadn't recognized my very favorite actor). ""Hart's War"" includes several subplots which all have intricate meanings and all thread into the ultimate story. It's very character-driven (there's not a lot of overt violence).

I didn't because Hollywood's approach to stories with racial themes is usually so politically correct as to insult the viewer's intelligence (which is demonstrated by my buying the DVD, rather than paying $5.00 for the matinee ticket?). This is a well made movie with an excellent cast. The interaction between the German POW Camp staff and the prisoners is excellent - taut and dramatic. The racial bias of the white enlisted men vs. the black Air Force officers is also realistic, and because it is not sanitized, it comes across very well. Good films are ""good"", because they draw the viewer into the story; one becomes a viewer, through the camera, of the plot, and often loses the sense of ""watching a movie"". Older films have less of this characteristic, I think, because stylized camera and acting techniques of that time detract from the viewer becoming totally immersed in watching believeable action. This movie brings the viewer into contact with characters and plot from the outset, and never lets go. Bruce Willis has come a long way from the ""Die Hard"" days, and is more convincing because of his matured talent. The rest of the cast perform very well.

496988,A1Q0UFY6YKH3V,B00000F2UF,Jon Eric Davidson,"[2, 3]","""Hart's War"" was, in my opinion, plagued by its own promotion; thus its brief run in theaters.  Through the trailers and other advertising, it seemed as though the studio couldn't decide whether to market it as ""The Great Escape"" for a new generation, or whether it was to be ""A Few Good Men"" set in World War II.  Those expecting it to be in either category will be sorely disappointed.  ""Hart's War"" turned out to be an interesting character drama that, while incorporating some parts of similar movies that have preceded it, proved to stand out as a unique film in the genre.The basic plot involves Hart, a rear-echelon staff aide, winding up in a POW camp after an unfortunate errand gets him captured by the Germans.  There he meets Colonel MacNamara, who doesn't trust Hart, fearing that Hart spilled secrets during his interrogation.  Enter a downed Tuskegee airman, later accused of murder.  MacNamara, trying to cover for his escape and sabotage plan, convinces the stalag commandant to hold a court-martial, at which Hart will defend the airman as a means of keeping him out of MacNamara's plan and distracting the Germans while they carry it out.The story plods along in a lot of places, and nothing very dynamic occurs until the climax and surprise ending to the movie.  In that respect, it would merit a low rating.  However, it is the climax and surprise ending that save the movie and highlight the uniqueness that separates this movie from its predecessors.  But, most importantly, it is the characters which drive this drama.Colin Farrell is rather plain in the lead role of Hart.  If anything, he annoyed me in that he came off as a wimp and someone to despise, until a brief stand of courage at the end salvages his role somewhat.  Perhaps this was the intent of Mr. Farrell's role, but all in all, nothing really distinguishes him, and the outstanding roles of the supporting cast make his rather forgettable.Bruce Willis, billed as the marquee name in this movie, plays Colonel MacNamara.  However, the marquee billing is deceptive, as Mr. Willis plays much more of a supporting role.  But, he has a track record of being able to step out or share the spotlight and creates memorable, subdued supporting characters.  This is what he accomplishes here, portraying a man from a legendary military family who wrestles with the personal demons of being captured before he can have his moments of valor.  His brooding adds to the edge and command of his role, making the viewer believe he is truly the leader of the POW's interred at the camp.But perhaps the best role in this movie - and one of the remarkable roles in any movie in recent years - goes to Marcel Iures, who portrays the German stalag commandant.  I was utterly fascinated by the depth, complexity, and quiet brilliance of this character.  The commandant is a world-weary man, burdened by the loss of family and friends in years of war, and knowing that he is on the losing side of this conflict.  However, in the face of all this, he attempts to maintain some order and discipline in the camp - accentuated by the occasional flash of evil - while at the same time balancing a system of respect and equity for the Allied officers (MacNamara and the other POW's).  He allows the court-martial in the guise of fairness, though behind the scenes, he attempts to rig the trial to his favor.  He lashes out with cruelty, yet fights emotions of sorrow and extraordinary remorse in an act he performs near the end of the movie.  Mr. Iures elegantly and quietly carries off this complex role in a way I believe no one else could have.  As I noted, I found his to be one of the most remarkable roles on film in recent years; a pity that more people did not - or will not - witness it.All in all, I give ""Hart's War"" a four-star rating for the outstanding roles portrayed by Mr. Willis and Mr. Iures, and for a different twist on the prisoner-of-war camp genre.  The story does move rather slowly and predictably, which prevents me from rating it with a full five stars.  The main draw for all audiences, though, is to see a couple of fine acting performances.",4,"Characters and a unique twist drive this ""sleeper"" movie",1041292800,"12 31, 2002",2002,4132,"['Hart', 'War', 'was', 'opinion', 'plagued', 'own', 'promotion', 'thus', 'brief', 'run', 'theaters', 'trailers', 'other', 'advertising', 'seemed', 'studio', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'market', 'Great', 'Escape', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'be', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'expecting', 'be', 'category', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Hart', 'War', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'interesting', 'character', 'drama', 'incorporating', 'parts', 'similar', 'movies', 'have', 'preceded', 'proved', 'stand', 'out', 'unique', 'film', 'genre.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Hart', 'rear-echelon', 'staff', 'aide', 'winding', 'up', 'POW', 'camp', 'unfortunate', 'errand', 'captured', 'Germans', 'Colonel', 'MacNamara', 'who', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Hart', 'fearing', 'Hart', 'spilled', 'secrets', 'interrogation', 'Enter', 'downed', 'Tuskegee', 'airman', 'later', 'accused', 'murder', 'MacNamara', 'trying', 'cover', 'escape', 'sabotage', 'plan', 'stalag', 'commandant', 'hold', 'court-martial', 'Hart', 'will', 'defend', 'airman', 'means', 'keeping', 'MacNamara', 'plan', 'distracting', 'Germans', 'carry', 'out.The', 'story', 'plods', 'lot', 'places', 'nothing', 'very', 'dynamic', 'occurs', 'climax', 'surprise', 'ending', 'movie', 'respect', 'would', 'merit', 'low', 'rating', 'However', 'climax', 'surprise', 'ending', 'save', 'movie', 'highlight', 'uniqueness', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'most', 'importantly', 'characters', 'drive', 'drama.Colin', 'Farrell', 'rather', 'plain', 'lead', 'role', 'Hart', 'anything', 'annoyed', 'came', 'off', 'wimp', 'someone', 'despise', 'brief', 'stand', 'courage', 'end', 'role', 'somewhat', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intent', 'Mr.', 'Farrell', 'role', 'nothing', 'really', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'rather', 'forgettable.Bruce', 'Willis', 'billed', 'marquee', 'name', 'movie', 'Colonel', 'MacNamara', 'However', 'marquee', 'billing', 'deceptive', 'Mr.', 'Willis', 'much', 'more', 'supporting', 'role', 'track', 'record', 'being', 'able', 'step', 'out', 'share', 'spotlight', 'memorable', 'subdued', 'supporting', 'characters', 'what', 'here', 'portraying', 'man', 'legendary', 'military', 'family', 'who', 'personal', 'demons', 'being', 'captured', 'can', 'have', 'moments', 'valor', 'brooding', 'edge', 'command', 'role', 'making', 'viewer', 'believe', 'truly', 'leader', 'POW', 'interred', 'camp.But', 'perhaps', 'best', 'role', 'movie', 'one', 'remarkable', 'roles', 'movie', 'recent', 'years', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'who', 'German', 'stalag', 'commandant', 'was', 'utterly', 'fascinated', 'depth', 'complexity', 'quiet', 'brilliance', 'character', 'commandant', 'world-weary', 'man', 'burdened', 'loss', 'family', 'friends', 'years', 'war', 'knowing', 'losing', 'side', 'conflict', 'However', 'face', 'maintain', 'order', 'discipline', 'camp', 'accentuated', 'occasional', 'flash', 'evil', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'balancing', 'system', 'respect', 'equity', 'Allied', 'officers', 'MacNamara', 'other', 'POW', 'court-martial', 'guise', 'fairness', 'scenes', 'rig', 'trial', 'favor', 'out', 'cruelty', 'yet', 'fights', 'emotions', 'sorrow', 'extraordinary', 'remorse', 'act', 'end', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Iures', 'elegantly', 'quietly', 'complex', 'role', 'way', 'believe', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'noted', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'roles', 'film', 'recent', 'years', 'pity', 'more', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'witness', 'it.All', 'give', 'Hart', 'War', 'four-star', 'rating', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'portrayed', 'Mr.', 'Willis', 'Mr.', 'Iures', 'different', 'twist', 'prisoner-of-war', 'camp', 'genre', 'story', 'move', 'rather', 'slowly', 'predictably', 'rating', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'main', 'draw', 'audiences', 'see', 'couple', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances']",Hart's War

However, the primary character is arguably Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell), recently captured and interrogated before being deposited in the prison. Under relatively mild coercion by his Wehrmacht captors, Hart had pinpointed a crucial U.S. Army supply dump that was subsequently captured by the Germans during the 1944 Ardennes offensive, so Tommy's self-esteem is at low ebb. In any case, on the basis of Hart's two years of law school, McNamara assigns him to defend Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terence Howard), a Negro fighter pilot recently arrived in the camp and now to be courtmartialed for the murder of a fellow POW, the racist Staff Sgt. Bedford (Cole Hauser).HART'S WAR the movie is part murder mystery and part courtroom drama. What it definitely isn't, as otherwise implied by its pre-release previews, is a Bruce Willis action flick. Perhaps that's why the film swiftly disappeared from the Big Screen - it was a bit more intelligent than the trailer-targeted audiences could bear.While Willis plays second fiddle to Farrell, the most intriguing character is that of the German camp commandant, Col. Visser (Marcel Iures), a world-wise veteran wounded in the Great War now engaged in a battle of wills with the no-nonsense  West Pointer McNamara. Is the help in case preparation Visser gives young Hart simply because both attended the same American university, or does it stem from a more hidden agenda? And what are those Russian POWs up to at that shoe factory next door? Also effective is Terrence Howard as Scott. At one point in the trial, he describes the freedoms German POWs, who were interned in the Deep South, enjoyed that were denied to the uniformed Tuskegee airmen in training, such as sitting in the front row of theaters or eating at certain diners. His speech is a pointed reminder of the virulent racism that once characterized America's military forces until only relatively recently.I enjoyed HART'S WAR the movie because it was a reasonably faithful adaptation of the excellent novel, and all the characters were well-played, particularly the fascinating Visser.",4,Shortchanged by its trailers,1031961600,"09 14, 2002",2002,2379,"['HART', 'WAR', 'movie', 'more', 'resemblance', 'HART', ""'S"", 'WAR', 'book', 'own', 'trailers.The', 'ostensible', 'leading', 'role', 'film', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Colonel', 'William', 'McNamara', 'ranking', 'American', 'officer', 'German', 'stalag', 'Allied', 'prisoners', 'towards', 'end', 'WWII', 'However', 'primary', 'character', 'arguably', 'Lt.', 'Tommy', 'Hart', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'recently', 'captured', 'interrogated', 'being', 'deposited', 'prison', 'relatively', 'mild', 'coercion', 'Wehrmacht', 'captors', 'Hart', 'had', 'pinpointed', 'crucial', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'supply', 'dump', 'was', 'subsequently', 'captured', 'Germans', '1944', 'Ardennes', 'offensive', 'Tommy', 'self-esteem', 'low', 'ebb', 'case', 'basis', 'Hart', 'two', 'years', 'law', 'school', 'McNamara', 'defend', 'Lt.', 'Lincoln', 'Scott', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Negro', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'recently', 'arrived', 'camp', 'now', 'be', 'courtmartialed', 'murder', 'fellow', 'POW', 'racist', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Bedford', 'Cole', 'Hauser', '.HART', 'WAR', 'movie', 'part', 'murder', 'mystery', 'part', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'What', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'implied', 'pre-release', 'previews', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'action', 'flick', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'film', 'swiftly', 'disappeared', 'Big', 'Screen', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'intelligent', 'trailer-targeted', 'audiences', 'could', 'bear.While', 'Willis', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Farrell', 'most', 'intriguing', 'character', 'German', 'camp', 'commandant', 'Col.', 'Visser', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'world-wise', 'veteran', 'wounded', 'Great', 'War', 'now', 'battle', 'wills', 'no-nonsense', 'West', 'Pointer', 'McNamara', 'help', 'case', 'preparation', 'Visser', 'young', 'Hart', 'simply', 'attended', 'same', 'American', 'university', 'stem', 'more', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'are', 'Russian', 'POWs', 'up', 'shoe', 'factory', 'next', 'door', 'Also', 'effective', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Scott', 'one', 'point', 'trial', 'freedoms', 'German', 'POWs', 'who', 'were', 'interned', 'Deep', 'South', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'denied', 'uniformed', 'Tuskegee', 'airmen', 'training', 'such', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'theaters', 'eating', 'certain', 'diners', 'speech', 'pointed', 'reminder', 'virulent', 'racism', 'once', 'characterized', 'America', 'military', 'forces', 'only', 'relatively', 'recently.I', 'enjoyed', 'HART', 'WAR', 'movie', 'was', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'novel', 'characters', 'were', 'well-played', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'Visser']",Hart's War

If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.

When a couple of African-American pilots arrive to the camp there seems to be some obvious racism expressed towards the African-Americans.

I almost did that and changed my mind at the last minute, which was good because the trailer spoils 90% of the movie.  I probably enjoyed the film more than I would have otherwise because I did not know what was up.  It has been a while since I have seen a trailer do such a gross disservice to a film.It will suprrise a lot of viewers that Bruce Willis is not the title character in ""Hart's War.""  Willis plays Col. William McNamara, commanding officer of the American Troops at German Stalag VI A.  Colin Farrell is Lt. Thomas Hart and who he is and how he came to be at this place is one of the first major pieces in the puzzle of what is happening in this film.  But then a pair of black Air Corps pilots, Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) and Lt. Lamar Archer (Vicellous Shannon) enter the camp to a hostile reception from their fellow Americans.  Meanwhile, the camp's Russian prisoners are doing forced labor at a bomb factory that the Allies think only makes shoes.What we know about World War II films set in P.O.W. camps is that there is supposed to be an escape (e.g., ""The Great Escape,"" ""Von Ryan's Express"").  What we do not expect is a court martial, but that becomes the event that starts to bring all the sub-plots together in this film (unless, of course, you made the mistake of watching that trailer).  However, having created some momentum towards the conclusion it has carefully constructed, the film throws it away at the end, and not to some greater good.  If this had happened after I had seen the trailer I would have been motivated to really trash this film because it would have been the proverbial adding insult to injury.Willis's face was used to sell this film but Col. McNamara is really a substantial supporting role.  This is primarily Colin Farrell's film and he has as much conflict with the characters of Lt. Scott and the Nazi commandant Col. Visser (Marcel Iures) as he does McNamara.  I can not speak to John Katzenbach's novel, beyond the disparaging comments directed at it by Stephen King in his book on writing, but the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George certainly wants to comment on racism.  But the points that are made are more from the perspective of the black pilots and the Nazi commandant than the bigoted white soldiers.",4,If you want to enjoy this film at all IGNORE THE TRAILER,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,2360,"['WARNING', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'trailer', 'Hart', 'War', 'watch', 'film', 'almost', 'did', 'changed', 'mind', 'last', 'minute', 'was', 'good', 'trailer', '90', '%', 'movie', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'do', 'gross', 'disservice', 'film.It', 'will', 'suprrise', 'lot', 'viewers', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'not', 'title', 'character', 'Hart', 'War', 'Willis', 'Col.', 'William', 'McNamara', 'commanding', 'officer', 'American', 'Troops', 'German', 'Stalag', 'VI', 'A.', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Lt.', 'Thomas', 'Hart', 'who', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'place', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'then', 'pair', 'black', 'Air', 'Corps', 'pilots', 'Lt.', 'Lincoln', 'Scott', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Lt.', 'Lamar', 'Archer', 'Vicellous', 'Shannon', 'enter', 'camp', 'hostile', 'reception', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'Meanwhile', 'camp', 'Russian', 'prisoners', 'are', 'doing', 'forced', 'labor', 'bomb', 'factory', 'Allies', 'think', 'only', 'know', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', 'set', 'P.O.W', 'camps', 'supposed', 'be', 'escape', 'e.g.', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Von', 'Ryan', 'Express', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'court', 'martial', 'event', 'bring', 'sub-plots', 'together', 'film', 'course', 'made', 'mistake', 'watching', 'trailer', 'However', 'having', 'created', 'momentum', 'conclusion', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'film', 'away', 'end', 'not', 'greater', 'good', 'had', 'happened', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'motivated', 'really', 'trash', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proverbial', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury.Willis', 'face', 'was', 'used', 'sell', 'film', 'Col.', 'McNamara', 'really', 'substantial', 'supporting', 'role', 'primarily', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'conflict', 'characters', 'Lt.', 'Scott', 'Nazi', 'commandant', 'Col.', 'Visser', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'McNamara', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'John', 'Katzenbach', 'novel', 'disparaging', 'comments', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Terry', 'George', 'certainly', 'comment', 'racism', 'points', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'more', 'perspective', 'black', 'pilots', 'Nazi', 'commandant', 'bigoted', 'white', 'soldiers']",Hart's War

This is a movie with only men, so if you are looking for romance there is none. This is set in a Stalig Camp, I guess this is a camp based in Germany for POW's. They get better amenities than the Jewish although there soup is filled with maggots. One fellow has a good way of looking at, at least its protein. The story has an underlying plot going on that is hidden from our eyes until the end. Only McNamara and several other men know whats happening. Our main character, Hart, is unaware like the audience. Hart had a conflict over the way he surrended to questioning when he was caught and was reliving this over at the Stalig Camp when he is asked to defend a black Lietenent POW, who has been accused of murdering a fellow white officer. This white officer had a hand in getting his friend who was also a black Lietenent POW in trouble with the Germans, which prompted a firing squad.The movie again has surprises in it and is intelligent. I like the way the Nazi Captain was portrayed. Very different, a melodramatic man, with a kind of thoughtful demeanor. This was really not so much about the Nazi's as it was about how the irony was really appalling, here we are fighting to stop genocide and treating our own fellow Americans as if they were lesser than, in this movie it was the African Americans. It makes a good point, one that I really didn't realize. I had no idea that the blacks were treated as if they were just fill ins, and deserved no respect, even if they were officers. The hypocrisy is just so visible, its a wonder people stayed in denial.The drawback is the movies ending, it was clever but it didn't let the movie stay true to form. The black officer should have walked away the hero, he didn't have a chance. Hart had an agenda, he wanted to take the slot, because of his internal conflict, mainly guilt. McNamara took it because he was supposed to he was the captain, therefore his que. But the Black Officer whose name I can't remember, should have been the hero, he should have been the one we mourned, let us feel our anger. The movie starts out letting us feel the anger but than as always whoever the star is, in this case Willis, he steps out of the smoke and grit and takes the hero slot. This is frustrating.

I mean the unsuspecting average Joe goes into a theater to watch a WWII flick and he figures its gonna be about Americans fighting Nazis.  Next thing you know he's finding out the history books have lied to him.  WWII is really about black and white Americans fighting eachother, with the urbane, literate Nazis acting as referees; that is when they're not occupied tossing off the odd urbane remark.  ""Ahh, you've read Herr Mark Twain, but he iss vonderful, ya?""  This line of dialog just about sums it up.  Why?  Well, in the first place, Mark Twain is NOT wonderful.  He is an enormously overrated American writer who'se stuff is so condescendingly folksy and toweringly boring that I suspect everybody claiming to like Mark Twain is a liar or a philistine or both.  But the point is that this Mark Twain crack is thrown in like you'd throw in a reference to Shakespeare - the most overrated writer of all time.  You know, like ""You've read Shakespeare?

It is as if this is not meant to be the opinion of the character but a plain and simple fact we all can agree on - so completely as to treat this fact as part of the scenery, like the barbed wire and the barracks.

In other words the movie is a subversive piece of revisionism wherein the Nazis are civilized background to the savagery of American black and white race hatred.  In other words, the real monsters in WWII were not the Nazis, but us.  Next thing you know we're gonna be sitting still for a WWII picture where the Nazis are the good guys and the Americans are the villians.

It switches courses several times, going from a battlefield adventure to a tense story of racism in the military during WWII to a court-martial drama to, finally, a POW escape thriller. The movie successfully navigates these changes until the climax, where it detours into rah rah patriotism by turning one of its villains into a hero. This allows for a feel good ending, but it lessens the impact of the themes it developed earlier.Lt. Thomas Hart [Colin Farrell] is the son of a US senator. He's assigned to a desk job at the European front, but  winds up instead being captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp in Belgium. There, Col. William McNamara [Bruce Willis], the vindictive, prejudiced leader of the American prisoners, tells him there is no room in the officers' barracks. Hart is forced to bunk with the enlisted men. Later, he is joined there by two other officers. It's easy to see why they were sent there. They are black. When one of them is accused of murdering a white soldier, McNamara demands a court-martial. Hart, who isn't a lawyer, is told to defend the man. Hart is both terrified and angered by the assignment. What he can not know is that there is a method to McNamara's madness.Bruce Willis gives his usual excellent performance, but it is Colin Farrell who is most impressive. The young actor seems destined for stardom. Also great is Terrance Howard as the accused.Despite its faults, I found ""Hart's War' to be the best of several war movies released recently.",4,"Works as drama, not as a thriller or action/advanture",1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,1568,"['most', 'part', 'Hart', 'War', 'gripping', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'going', 'battlefield', 'adventure', 'tense', 'story', 'racism', 'military', 'WWII', 'court-martial', 'drama', 'finally', 'POW', 'escape', 'thriller', 'movie', 'successfully', 'changes', 'climax', 'where', 'rah', 'rah', 'patriotism', 'turning', 'one', 'villains', 'hero', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'impact', 'themes', 'developed', 'earlier.Lt', 'Thomas', 'Hart', '[', 'Colin', 'Farrell', ']', 'son', 'US', 'senator', 'assigned', 'desk', 'job', 'European', 'front', 'up', 'instead', 'being', 'captured', 'Germans', 'sent', 'POW', 'camp', 'Belgium', 'Col.', 'William', 'McNamara', '[', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ']', 'vindictive', 'prejudiced', 'leader', 'American', 'prisoners', 'room', 'officers', 'barracks', 'Hart', 'forced', 'bunk', 'enlisted', 'men', 'Later', 'joined', 'there', 'two', 'other', 'officers', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'sent', 'there', 'are', 'black', 'When', 'one', 'accused', 'murdering', 'white', 'soldier', 'McNamara', 'court-martial', 'Hart', 'who', ""n't"", 'lawyer', 'told', 'defend', 'man', 'Hart', 'terrified', 'angered', 'assignment', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'method', 'McNamara', 'madness.Bruce', 'Willis', 'usual', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'most', 'impressive', 'young', 'actor', 'destined', 'stardom', 'Also', 'great', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'accused.Despite', 'faults', 'found', 'Hart', 'War', 'be', 'best', 'several', 'war', 'movies', 'released', 'recently']",Hart's War
497003,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,B00000F2UF,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[0, 0]","""Hart's War"" (2002) is strange film. It is intended as a ""POW camp"" movie and at the same time tries to be ""original"" or ""out of the mould"".The story plot is as follows: young Lieutenant Hart is captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge and submitted to harassment by his captors.After this shocking experience, which he barely survives, he is sent to a POW camp.At the camp the senior-ranking American officer, Col. McNamara, does not allow Lt. Hart a place in the officer's barracks and send him to be the only officer in a NCO's barrack.Soon after this, to make things worst, two Afro-American pilots arrives to the site and Col. McNamara decides to lodge them in Hart's barracks. In a time when racial segregation was still in force at the USA armed forces, this almost creates havoc, which Hart barely avoids. Still racial hatred takes its toll: one of the pilots is framed & summarily executed. Racist Staff Sgt.  Bedford, suspected as the framer, is murdered and obviously the surviving pilot is accused of murder.Col. McNamara asks for and obtains, from German camp commander, authorization to have a court-martial and designs Lt. Hart as the pilot's defender.From here on no more details of the plot should be disclosed.There are some improbable situations, IMHO the most blatant one is when the German commander accept being call as witness by the defense.Nevertheless the movie is interesting and quite original.Bruce Willis as Col. McNamara is impeccable. Colin Farrell as Lt. Hart is very convincing & compromised with the character. Cole Hauser as Staff Sgt. Bedford is in the line of one of those cynical hardboiled characters that often appears in this kind of movies.Alar Kivilo's photography is over par delivering beautiful; yet full of gore, battlefield images. Also the camp scenes are visually great.It is a good POW's film, not as gorgeous as ""The Great Escape"" (1963) or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957), but deserves to be seen by any war film fan!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,"This is an implausible story, yet leads to an engaging movie.",1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,2013,"['Hart', 'War', '2002', 'strange', 'film', 'intended', 'POW', 'camp', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'tries', 'be', 'original', 'mould', '.The', 'story', 'plot', 'young', 'Lieutenant', 'Hart', 'captured', 'Germans', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'submitted', 'harassment', 'captors.After', 'shocking', 'experience', 'barely', 'sent', 'POW', 'camp.At', 'camp', 'senior-ranking', 'American', 'officer', 'Col.', 'McNamara', 'not', 'allow', 'Lt.', 'Hart', 'place', 'officer', 'barracks', 'send', 'be', 'only', 'officer', 'NCO', 'barrack.Soon', 'make', 'things', 'worst', 'two', 'Afro-American', 'pilots', 'site', 'Col.', 'McNamara', 'lodge', 'Hart', 'barracks', 'time', 'when', 'racial', 'segregation', 'was', 'still', 'force', 'USA', 'armed', 'forces', 'almost', 'havoc', 'Hart', 'barely', 'avoids', 'Still', 'racial', 'hatred', 'toll', 'one', 'pilots', 'framed', 'summarily', 'executed', 'Racist', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Bedford', 'suspected', 'framer', 'murdered', 'obviously', 'surviving', 'pilot', 'accused', 'murder.Col', 'McNamara', 'obtains', 'German', 'camp', 'commander', 'authorization', 'have', 'court-martial', 'Lt.', 'Hart', 'pilot', 'defender.From', 'here', 'more', 'details', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'improbable', 'situations', 'IMHO', 'most', 'blatant', 'one', 'when', 'German', 'commander', 'being', 'call', 'witness', 'defense.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'interesting', 'quite', 'original.Bruce', 'Willis', 'Col.', 'McNamara', 'impeccable', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Lt.', 'Hart', 'very', 'convincing', 'compromised', 'character', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Bedford', 'line', 'one', 'cynical', 'hardboiled', 'characters', 'often', 'kind', 'movies.Alar', 'Kivilo', 'photography', 'par', 'delivering', 'beautiful', 'full', 'gore', 'battlefield', 'images', 'Also', 'camp', 'scenes', 'are', 'visually', 'great.It', 'good', 'POW', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'Great', 'Escape', '1963', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', '1957', 'be', 'seen', 'war', 'film', 'fan', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",Hart's War

In the few years since he burst on the scene in TIGERLAND, he has given us marvelous performances in films such as MINORITY REPORT, PHONE BOOTH, and THE RECRUIT.  In HART'S WAR, it is heart and fierce performance that drives this well executed film.  Director Gregory Hoblit (Fallen, Frequency) has orchestrated a tense, inspiring and suspenseful look at men in war.  Bruce Willis also stars as Colonel McNamara, a man whose intense desire to be at war obscures his humanity and morality.  Terence Howard as Lt. Scott, accused of murdering a bigoted soldier, is also brilliant in his uncompromising performance.  Howard never overdoes the prejudice he faces, and is truly moving in his speech about the German POWs treatment in Alabama as compared to African-Americans.  Marcel Iuries as the German commandant gives a multi-layered performance of a man driven to exert his power and yet commiserate on the agonies of war.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Jaeger (Fisk) and Cole Hauser (Brendon) are perfect.  The cinematography, music and editing are likewise top notch, and HART'S WAR provides us a searing, heartbreaking look at the power of honor and justice.

497006,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00000F2UF,"""mobby_uk""","[1, 2]","First of all, I wanted to see Hart's War, because it is one of the few WWII revival films that came out recently, a fresh return to a genre that produced many classics and great entertainment.Having said that, I had no other idea about what the film was about,nor had I read the book, and my ignorance my greatly rewarded by discovering a powerful movie that remained with me long after the credit rolled. This is what I sometimes enjoy most about watching films, having to discover them all by myself, reading no reviews beforehand, and knowing little about it.I will not go on a lot about the plot, since it has been well written about by other reviewers, save to say it is a film about a German POW camp towards the end of the war.The politics, racism, survival instinct that exist among the prisoners go hand in hand with honor,integrity and incredible courage. I am surprised to see that many have compared the film to The Great Escape, something I did not quite see. Yes, there is an escape attempt, and a daring operation, but it not by far the core of the plot! The film is more about these human values that are put under incredible pressure, where some will succumb, some will passively resist, while just a few will abide by an unwavering sense of honor, and duty and face the consequences with dignity.And it is not about war itself, though what little action we see, (the raid on the train station for example,) are very well directed and edited.The movie is first and foremost about acting and excellent actors! Colin Farrell adds lots of vulnerablity to his role, and gives his best performance to date, Bruce Willis sinks his teeth into the meatiest, most three dimensional role he had had for a while, Marcel Iures plays to perfection the German POW commander with a sense of civility of an educated man at times, and the ruthlessness of a Nazi officer at others.But, in my opinion the revelation of the film is Terence Howard!!What a brilliant actor and what a performance! subdued yet full of depth, reflecting the invisible heroes of WWII, the African-Americans who fought bravely for their country, facing impossible odds from everyone!The last ten minutes of the film ,which I will not reveal since it has many shocking twists, are very powerful! I just kept looking, transfixed to the screen, with all my senses glued to the events that unfolded before me.This is by far Gregory Hoblit,(Frequency, Fallen, Primal Fear) best film to date, one that if you give it a chance,forget Great Escape for a minute, and watch it with some kind of ignorance, then it will surely reward you with a movie experience rarely seen these days.",5,Powerful Movie!,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2648,"['First', 'wanted', 'see', 'Hart', 'War', 'one', 'few', 'WWII', 'revival', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'recently', 'fresh', 'return', 'genre', 'produced', 'many', 'classics', 'great', 'entertainment.Having', 'said', 'had', 'other', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'ignorance', 'greatly', 'rewarded', 'discovering', 'powerful', 'movie', 'remained', 'long', 'credit', 'rolled', 'what', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'most', 'watching', 'films', 'having', 'discover', 'reading', 'reviews', 'beforehand', 'knowing', 'little', 'it.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'lot', 'plot', 'been', 'well', 'written', 'about', 'other', 'reviewers', 'save', 'say', 'film', 'German', 'POW', 'camp', 'end', 'war.The', 'politics', 'racism', 'survival', 'instinct', 'exist', 'prisoners', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'honor', 'integrity', 'incredible', 'courage', 'am', 'surprised', 'see', 'many', 'have', 'compared', 'film', 'Great', 'Escape', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'see', 'Yes', 'escape', 'attempt', 'daring', 'operation', 'not', 'far', 'core', 'plot', 'film', 'more', 'human', 'values', 'are', 'put', 'incredible', 'pressure', 'where', 'will', 'succumb', 'will', 'passively', 'resist', 'just', 'few', 'will', 'abide', 'unwavering', 'sense', 'honor', 'duty', 'face', 'consequences', 'dignity.And', 'not', 'war', 'what', 'little', 'action', 'see', 'raid', 'train', 'station', 'example', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'edited.The', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'acting', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'lots', 'vulnerablity', 'role', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'teeth', 'meatiest', 'most', 'three', 'dimensional', 'role', 'had', 'had', 'while', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'perfection', 'German', 'POW', 'commander', 'sense', 'civility', 'educated', 'man', 'times', 'ruthlessness', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'others.But', 'opinion', 'revelation', 'film', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'What', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'what', 'performance', 'subdued', 'yet', 'full', 'depth', 'reflecting', 'invisible', 'heroes', 'WWII', 'African-Americans', 'who', 'fought', 'bravely', 'country', 'facing', 'impossible', 'odds', 'everyone', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'many', 'shocking', 'twists', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'just', 'kept', 'looking', 'transfixed', 'screen', 'senses', 'glued', 'events', 'unfolded', 'me.This', 'far', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'Frequency', 'Fallen', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'one', 'give', 'chance', 'forget', 'Great', 'Escape', 'minute', 'watch', 'kind', 'ignorance', 'then', 'will', 'surely', 'reward', 'movie', 'experience', 'rarely', 'seen', 'days']",Hart's War

The story moved well with good, three dimensional, characters.  I was excited when it was announced that the rights for the movie were sold.I was somewhat apprehensive when it was announced that Bruce Willis was starring in the movie.  This is not to say that I don't like Willis, just that there wasn't any character appropriate for him in the book...  When I saw the trailer for the movie I was totally turned off by all the explosions.  It appeared that a tight courtroom thriller was turned into ""Die Hard"".  The trailer turned me off and I never went to see the film in the theatre.I finally saw the movie this past week and I discovered that my apprehensions and refusal to see the movie in the theatre was right.""Hart's war"" is not a terrible movie - it's not great with good visuals and a comparatively weak plot (probably three stars).  The problem is that the movie states that it ""is based on"" a great book and virtually none of the story was passed from the book to the film.  Somewhere in the adaptation, Hart's character is no longer a drafted law student, there is suddenly _two_ black airmen (the book only has one) and the movie's story is more about hurting the German war effort - not about finding a murderer.

I thought Id brought home a good even great one after the stunning 'Battle of the Bulge' jeep-scene and chase in the opening sequence. Tense little scene, beautifully-filmed, this was the highlight of the film in the first 10 minutes in terms of convincing atmosphere, I really believed I was in this jeep stopped by German infiltrators dressed as Yanky MPs in the Battle of the Bulge, this sort of thing in very general terms was happening then.And for further credit, the experienced-guy whos 'on the ball' and 'gets wise' to these 'Krauts',  spots the heavily-camouflaged German weapons-pit in the snowy tree-line ( eyes sideways while nervously chewing cigar, looked right.) and makes a sudden brave move on these American-speaking German  Kommandos doesnt kick-asse or even make it, is actually killed outright immediately, as the odds would generally guarantee.The other guy roars off in a sequence recalling James Caan's jeep-rally in 'A Bridge Too Far' but after looking like he might make it, the jeep crashes to a wheel-spinning engine-revving halt in a hole . Bravo.Thats a cut! Top war action-scene, frankly.The old  'For you zee war iss ofer, Schweinehund!'  trick.Fair-enough.We have a fair but routine POW convened criminal trial, with some PC overtones, good-guy German Kommandant( there were bad Germans , like Anton Diffring in this war, and jolly-decent Germans, to allow for the fact Germans  became good when the Russians simultaneously became bad in 1945. All the bad Germans like Anton Diffring we either hanged or shot, or employed at the CIA or NASA, so we definateley only had good ones around from then on-oh yeah, a lot of the good Germans like Rommel and Canaris were also disposed-of  by the bad Germans)more PC overtones with falsely-accused good black- man by racist bad white-man (Cole Hauser, who steals the film, perhaps, I like this actor, seen him around, always good value)BruCe Willis just walks through being Bruce Willis,  and on balance we are travelling solidly but routinely, and then comes the preposterous 'Hogans Heroes' without the laughs , ending. This ending should not have been attempted without Sergeant Schultz, Colonel Klink or at least, Major Hochstedder. Prisoners mass-escape and blow up sinister grenade or ammunition-factory next-door on the way out, 'changing the course of the war'Oh, dear.One previous-reviewer asked 'did anything like this ever happen in the war?' NO, it did not, Nothing remotely like it.  Prisoners occasionally escaped, they did not blow up German plants on the way home, and even if the had, this is weeks after the Battle of the Bulge where the main character is captured, the war was within 5 months of conclusion at the end of this battle, and the destruction of one ammo or grenade factory BY ANYBODY was not deciding the war at any point in the war, let alone January 1945.

497009,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00000F2UF,Patrick L. Randall,"[3, 4]","In early 2002, movie audiences were still getting acquainted Irish newcomer Colin Farrell.  On the same token, they were also quite familiar with Bruce Willis' acting credentials.  Putting the two of them together in a racially charged World War II drama would seem an unlikely mixture.  Farrell was already establish his bad boy credentials in Hollywood and Bruce Willis, despite a recent renaissance with films like ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", was still being remembered mostly as `Mr. Joe Actionhero' from movies like ""Die Hard"".  As strange as this combination would seem, actors and story, the resulting ""Hart's War"" turns out to be surprisingly good film.""Hart's War"" is set in the waning months of World War II.  While the Allied forces are locked in the struggle of their lives in the Battle of the Bulge, Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) remains comfortably behind the lines at headquarters, courtesy of strings pulled by his father, a United States Senator.  However, one day Hart volunteers to drive an infantry captain back to the front lines and ends up a prisoner when his jeep is ambushed by Germans posing as Allied MPs.  After a few days of interrogation, he is sent to a German P.O.W. camp where he is promptly billeted to bunk with the enlisted men because he was less than truthful with Colonel McNamara (Willis), the ranking U.S. P.O.W. about the information he gave up under interrogation.  The routine seems to be setting in as the Hart prepares to spend the rest of the war in captivity.  That is, until a few new prisoners are added to the U.S. contingent, two black pilots from the Tuskegee Airmen.  Needless to say, in the still segregated U.S. Army, this does not sit well with many of the soldiers; especially a racist sergeant in Hart's barracks named Bedford (Cole Hauser).  Bedford conspires to get one of the pilots executed on a trumped up charge and not long afterwards, Bedford ends up murdered, seemingly by the other pilot as revenge.  Instead of ordering an immediate for execution of the second pilot, the camp Commandant (Marcel Iures) agrees to let McNamara form a military tribunal to try the case, with Hart, a law student, defending the pilot, Lt. Scott (Terrence Howard).  Of course, there is more to this trial than just trying to see justice served.  McNamara wants to buy time for an important plan while the German staff is distracted by the proceedings, and the entire tribunal is merely a pawn in this plan.""Hart's War"" owes a large debt to great World War II prison movie such as ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"".  Certainly, many elements are borrowed from these films.  However, it's the addition of the racism angle that sets this film apart.  While some will see this as a forced-upon-the-audience message, it actually fits quite well when one looks at the overall arc of the story.  ""Hart's War"" is not meant to be a referendum on racism in the U.S. Army in that era.  It simply uses that issue as a way to distract all the characters from the true mission of McNamara's (while also still managing to make a point about racism).  Willis, in his role as McNamara, continues to bring the demeanor of quiet, dignified fury about him that he first put into use in ""Sixth Sense"".  It's a strong performance, matched Farrell's nuance effort as the nave (but learning) Tom Hart.  Marcel Iures as the conflicted, manipulative commandant is also a treat to watch.  While ""Hart's War"" won't ever been in the upper pantheon of great war films like ""Patton"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", it is a still solid, compelling entertainment and certainly worth a watch.",4,Compelling World War II Drama,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,3611,"['early', '2002', 'movie', 'audiences', 'were', 'still', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'Irish', 'newcomer', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'same', 'token', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'acting', 'credentials', 'Putting', 'two', 'together', 'racially', 'charged', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'drama', 'would', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'mixture', 'Farrell', 'was', 'already', 'establish', 'bad', 'boy', 'credentials', 'Hollywood', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'recent', 'renaissance', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'remembered', 'mostly', 'Mr.', 'Joe', 'Actionhero', 'movies', 'Die', 'Hard', 'As', 'strange', 'combination', 'would', 'seem', 'actors', 'story', 'resulting', 'Hart', 'War', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'Hart', 'War', 'set', 'waning', 'months', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Allied', 'forces', 'are', 'locked', 'struggle', 'lives', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Lieutenant', 'Thomas', 'Hart', 'Farrell', 'comfortably', 'lines', 'headquarters', 'courtesy', 'strings', 'pulled', 'father', 'United', 'States', 'Senator', 'However', 'one', 'day', 'Hart', 'volunteers', 'drive', 'infantry', 'captain', 'back', 'front', 'lines', 'up', 'prisoner', 'when', 'jeep', 'ambushed', 'Germans', 'posing', 'Allied', 'MPs', 'few', 'days', 'interrogation', 'sent', 'German', 'P.O.W', 'camp', 'where', 'promptly', 'billeted', 'bunk', 'enlisted', 'men', 'was', 'less', 'truthful', 'Colonel', 'McNamara', 'Willis', 'ranking', 'U.S.', 'P.O.W', 'information', 'gave', 'up', 'interrogation', 'routine', 'be', 'setting', 'Hart', 'spend', 'rest', 'war', 'captivity', 'few', 'new', 'prisoners', 'are', 'added', 'U.S.', 'contingent', 'two', 'black', 'pilots', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'Needless', 'say', 'still', 'segregated', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'many', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'racist', 'sergeant', 'Hart', 'barracks', 'named', 'Bedford', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Bedford', 'get', 'one', 'pilots', 'executed', 'trumped', 'up', 'charge', 'not', 'long', 'afterwards', 'Bedford', 'up', 'murdered', 'seemingly', 'other', 'pilot', 'revenge', 'Instead', 'ordering', 'immediate', 'execution', 'second', 'pilot', 'camp', 'Commandant', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'let', 'McNamara', 'form', 'military', 'tribunal', 'try', 'case', 'Hart', 'law', 'student', 'defending', 'pilot', 'Lt.', 'Scott', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'course', 'more', 'trial', 'just', 'trying', 'see', 'justice', 'served', 'McNamara', 'buy', 'time', 'important', 'plan', 'German', 'staff', 'distracted', 'proceedings', 'entire', 'tribunal', 'merely', 'pawn', 'plan', 'Hart', 'War', 'large', 'debt', 'great', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'prison', 'movie', 'such', 'Stalag', '17', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Certainly', 'many', 'elements', 'are', 'borrowed', 'films', 'However', 'addition', 'racism', 'film', 'apart', 'will', 'see', 'forced-upon-the-audience', 'message', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'when', 'one', 'overall', 'arc', 'story', 'Hart', 'War', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'referendum', 'racism', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'era', 'simply', 'issue', 'way', 'distract', 'characters', 'true', 'mission', 'McNamara', 'also', 'still', 'managing', 'make', 'point', 'racism', 'Willis', 'role', 'McNamara', 'bring', 'demeanor', 'quiet', 'dignified', 'fury', 'first', 'put', 'use', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'strong', 'performance', 'matched', 'Farrell', 'nuance', 'effort', 'nave', 'learning', 'Tom', 'Hart', 'Marcel', 'conflicted', 'manipulative', 'commandant', 'also', 'treat', 'watch', 'Hart', 'War', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'been', 'upper', 'pantheon', 'great', 'war', 'films', 'Patton', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'still', 'solid', 'compelling', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'watch']",Hart's War

Two of the POWs are Tuskegee airmen, both of whom are the target of racist bigotry...especially from one fellow POW, a vindictive Sgt Bedford, who plants a weapon under one of their beds and then informs on him. After he is shot by a firing squad, Sgt Bedford is murdered and the prime suspect is the remaining Tuskegee airman, because of his revenge motive. Instead of summary execution, the senior-ranking American officer, Col McNamara, convinces the camp commandant, Col Visser, to convene a courts martial to try the airman. Lt Hart, by virtue of the fact he was attending law school before the war, is appointed defense lawyer. Hart learns who really killed Sgt Bedford from Col McNamara, and why. If he reveals the information he has learned it will put numerous lives in jeopardy. What will he do? That will set the stage for what is an excellent War movie. If you are intrigued so far, queue it up and see how it plays out...I think you may be surprised by the final outcome. Colin Farrell is Lt Hart and he delivers an exceptional performance; as does Terrence Howard, as the black airman on trial. They are both upstaged though by Bruce Willis as Col McNamara, in one of his finest performances; and by the acclaimed Romanian actor, Marcel Iures, as the camp commandant, Col Visser. Visser is on the one hand a typical sadistic Nazi; but on the other hand, a sympathetic character...Iures, absolutely nails the characterization. Cole Hauser likewise nails the bigoted Sgt Bedford.

I hardly ever rate anything 5 stars (I have probably only rated 3-4 movies 5 stars), so a 3 is worth seeing to me, but this movie is not on the same level as a movie like ""Star Wars"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", or ""Prince of Tides"".Anyway, this is a good movie.  The SLOW start to this movie really detracts from the good story.  The makers of the movie should have spent more time developing the two main characters, and less time with trivial scenes that do not add much to the story. There is a weak attempt to throw in some action at the beginning, and I cannot figure out the significance to the story.Also, do not expect this movie to be an action movie.  This movie is really more like a courtroom drama, set in a german POW camp during WW II. The marketing of this movie was more along the lines of an action movie, which was a mistake.On a technical note, I found that the DVD dialogue is a little too quiet in comparison to the background noise and soundtrack, etc.  Many scenes it is really difficult to hear what the characters are saying, and the fact that some of them speak with german accents makes it even harder to hear correctly.  I had to turn up the volume very loundly to hear what they were saying.  At first, I thought it was just me, then I watched it again with my wife and mother and they also had trouble hearing the dialogue.All in all, if yiou can make it through a slow start, the story is rewarding and entertaining.

Portraying the commandant of Stalag VI, Marcel Iures steals the show from Bruce Willis , the nominal star of this unusual ""war"" movie.I was not sure of what to expect from this DVD other than most Bruce Willis roles are of a tough guy with some depth. The co-star , Colin Farrell , comes across as a real wimp-dimp little rich boy sent to war , inadvertantly captured in the Battle of the Bulge , interrogated , broken , and sent off to a stalag to sit out the remainder of the war.In the prison camp ,Col. McNamara , portrayed by Willis , shunts Lt. Hart , portrayed by Farrell , to the enlisted men's barracks instead of quartering him properly as an officer. Shortly thereafter , two Tuskeegee airmen (black pilots)who have been shot down are also sent to the enlisted barracks with Hart. A highly predictible racial scene ensues--an execution takes place-- and another racially inspired ""setup"" finds Lt. Hart as a defense counsel for the surviving black pilot.Through all these antics we observe Col. Visser (Marcel Iures) attempting to maintain order and discipline in the camp with an iron hand.

Buffington,"[1, 2]","""Hart's War"" features decent performances by Bruce Willis and Colin Farell in a somewhat convoluted story set in a German POW camp late in the war.  Lt. Hart is a Senator's son who has managed to get soft duty for most of the war.  Suddenly he finds himself captured, tortured, and in a POW camp.  When black American fighter pilots are brought to the camp, they face prejudice and a trumped-up court-martial in which the inexperienced Hart is appointed defense counsel.  This all sounds straightforward, but in reality there is a convoluted sub-plot that I will not give away in this review.  There is an interesting angle of fraternization with the German camp command that I found somewhat unrealistic, but who can say?Overall, this is a workmanlike POW film.

The end result is that it loses itself and the viewer. While impressively produced with accurate equipment, the film suffers from a basic reality check:  Allied prisoners were not this well treated by 1945.  Having spoken with someone who was in a German POW camp as a GI in late 1944 his description of the conditions were a lot worse than what's shown here.  In fact he found this movie to be dead wrong in that regard.  If the conditions shown were a year earlier he could have beleived it, but by 1944-45 the Germans were running out of everything and had scant resources to spare for allied POWs.  Conditions were therefor a lot worse than shown here.  The whole barrack room lawyer court case and racial bit shown is another Hollywood ploy for political correctness in today's movies.  God, will we ever be rid of this deadening influence which spoils so many films today.  Even Blacks must be getting tired of this by now.

497020,AZQ4FW0OW5VF4,B00000F2UF,"Ronald B. Fetty, Jr.","[2, 3]","I thought the movie had a great plot.  The Bruce Willis role of being in charge of a POW camp in Germany.  To sacifice a black American Airman for the good of an escape plot is abhorrid.  The thing is I'm sure this could have some historical merit.  Collin's role is quite good as he launches his investigation into the war crime.  It brought up racial bigotry in a way not told too often.  We talk of the atrocities of Nazi Germany, but we do the same things here --- even today.  I did not think Collin's role should have pointed out the area where Allied men were after being captured before arriving at the POW Camp.  Being a fan of Mr. Linus Roache, (great British thespian) was not pleased he had such a small role in this film either.  He deserves better from US films.  Other than the fiction of the '60s comedy Hogan's Heroes, I really doubt that things in a POW Camp in Germany, or anywhere are really that calm.  If your a fan of Bruce Willis, or Collin Ferrell this would be for you.  As for me being a fan of Linus Roache it left flatter than old soda.

497027,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00000F2UF,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[30, 32]","I finally got around to watching this movie last night (after buying it for $4 on DVD a few weeks ago) and I can say I was very pleasantly surprised by it after reading so many negative reviews.The Problem: This film was mareketed poorly - the trailers give an accurate idea of the content, but they give you the wrong impression as to the tone.  Because Bruce Willis is in it, they chose to make it out to contain tons of action and heroic combat!  They also chose to make it appear to be a Bruce Willis vehicle.  Let me tell you, if you are renting or buying it for either of the above reasons, you will hate it!  The ""combat action"" scenes are sparse (two scenes) and extremely short (though very exciting when they do occur.  And Bruce Willis is really a supporting actor to Farrel - in fact, of the major characters, he probably has less screen time than anyone else, and is rarely seen outside of Farrel's perspective.(Also, Americans seem to reject the idea that Nazis in an interrment camp could have had a shred of civility.  Perhaps this film gave them a little too much credit - but I think that even as evil as they were, not all Nazis were inhuman brutes.)The Good: So, the first thing you need to do is lay aside your expectation of a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or GUNS OF NAVARONNE type movie.  This is a drama!  And it is a very good one.  There are several layers to this story - one is that of Lt. Hart's (Colin Farrel) need for redemption after an early failure in the film.  His assignment to defend the falsely accused marine gives him that chance.  The main story is the trial of a marine who asserts he was framed for the murder of a fellow marine in the stockade.  Farrel quickly learns that the cards are stacked against him as the presiding officer McNamara (Willis) seemse bent on a guilty verdict.  This sets up some very tense confrontations between the two.Adding a second layer to this drama is the apparently misunderstood character of the commanding Nazi officer Werner Visser.  Visser represents an aging officer who has wound up in a remote post and seems to have accepted this lesser role.  (Someone commented below that his ""nice guy"" attitude would not get him far in the German Army - ahem, well, I think that's the point - that's why he's watching over a camp rather than storming the frontlines!) He is a foil to Willis's McNamara, who wants nothing more than to get back to the war.  The confusion as to why Visser suddenly wants to help Hart is that people perceive this as Visser suddenly becoming the nice Nazi.  Well, anyone paying attention can see that Visser is ONLY motivated by getting back at McNamara.  Hart is a convenient tool to do so - but there is not fondness for Hart from Visser, as you will see by the film's end.The third layer is that of the racist motivation behind the original crime.  Two of the confined officers are African-American, and they are portrayed in a very heroic light here - but the white enlisted men are very prejudiced to their presence (this is the 40s, remember).  This gives ample opportunity to see racism as it truly is - these are fine outstanding officers, but their contributions are ignored by those who only see the color of their skin.  Someone said below that the film portrayed the African-American soldiers as Spineless and hapless - I don't know what movie he saw, I think the film COMBATED this misconception!Combining these three threads takes a skillful director, and Hoblit shows himself up to the task.  The film never loses momentum, but switches nicely between the various threads.  The writing is crisp, the cinematography is appropriately drab and dreary in its own beautiful way (love the light beams coming through the barrack windows) and the few actions scenes keep the excitement level high.  All told, this is an excellent movie, and one I am proud to own - it's a shame more people will miss out on it because of the critics who didn't get it.The Bad: That is not to say it is the perfect film.  I did have a difficult time following alot of what was going on for the first hour, but near the end, when a plot twist was introduced, much of these scenes made more sense.  Also, some of the dialogue was either poorly recorded, or poorly delivered.  But, my main gripe was covered above about the misleading marketing of this film.The Summation: Think of it as a combination of THE GREAT ESCAPE, A FEW GOOD MEN, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - with the final sum being just a few notches below each of these titles, and you'll get an idea of what you're in for . . . give it a chance!",4,Compelling Drama sabotaged by Marketing Campaign that tried to make it an Action movie!,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,4586,"['finally', 'got', 'watching', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'buying', '4', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews.The', 'Problem', 'film', 'was', 'mareketed', 'poorly', 'trailers', 'give', 'accurate', 'idea', 'content', 'give', 'wrong', 'impression', 'tone', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'chose', 'make', 'out', 'contain', 'tons', 'action', 'heroic', 'combat', 'also', 'chose', 'make', 'appear', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'vehicle', 'Let', 'tell', 'are', 'renting', 'buying', 'above', 'reasons', 'will', 'hate', 'combat', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'sparse', 'two', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'short', 'very', 'exciting', 'when', 'do', 'occur', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'really', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Farrel', 'fact', 'major', 'characters', 'probably', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'anyone', 'else', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Farrel', 'perspective', 'Also', 'Americans', 'seem', 'reject', 'idea', 'Nazis', 'interrment', 'camp', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'shred', 'civility', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'gave', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'think', 'that', 'even', 'as', 'evil', 'were', 'not', 'Nazis', 'were', 'inhuman', 'brutes', 'Good', 'So', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'do', 'lay', 'aside', 'expectation', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'GUNS', 'OF', 'NAVARONNE', 'type', 'movie', 'drama', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'are', 'several', 'layers', 'story', 'one', 'Lt.', 'Hart', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'need', 'redemption', 'early', 'failure', 'film', 'assignment', 'defend', 'falsely', 'accused', 'marine', 'chance', 'main', 'story', 'trial', 'marine', 'who', 'was', 'framed', 'murder', 'fellow', 'marine', 'stockade', 'Farrel', 'quickly', 'cards', 'are', 'stacked', 'presiding', 'officer', 'McNamara', 'Willis', 'seemse', 'bent', 'guilty', 'verdict', 'up', 'very', 'tense', 'confrontations', 'two.Adding', 'second', 'layer', 'drama', 'apparently', 'misunderstood', 'character', 'commanding', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'Werner', 'Visser', 'Visser', 'aging', 'officer', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'remote', 'post', 'have', 'accepted', 'lesser', 'role', 'Someone', 'commented', 'nice', 'guy', 'attitude', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'far', 'German', 'Army', 'ahem', 'well', 'think', 'point', 'why', 'watching', 'over', 'camp', 'rather', 'storming', 'frontlines', 'foil', 'Willis', 'McNamara', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'get', 'back', 'war', 'confusion', 'why', 'Visser', 'suddenly', 'help', 'Hart', 'people', 'perceive', 'Visser', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'nice', 'Nazi', 'Well', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'can', 'see', 'Visser', 'ONLY', 'motivated', 'getting', 'back', 'McNamara', 'Hart', 'convenient', 'tool', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'fondness', 'Hart', 'Visser', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'end.The', 'third', 'layer', 'racist', 'motivation', 'original', 'crime', 'Two', 'confined', 'officers', 'are', 'African-American', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'heroic', 'light', 'here', 'white', 'enlisted', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'prejudiced', 'presence', '40s', 'remember', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'see', 'racism', 'are', 'fine', 'outstanding', 'officers', 'contributions', 'are', 'ignored', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'color', 'skin', 'Someone', 'said', 'film', 'portrayed', 'African-American', 'soldiers', 'Spineless', 'hapless', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'saw', 'think', 'film', 'COMBATED', 'misconception', 'Combining', 'three', 'threads', 'skillful', 'director', 'Hoblit', 'task', 'film', 'never', 'momentum', 'nicely', 'various', 'threads', 'writing', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'appropriately', 'drab', 'dreary', 'own', 'beautiful', 'way', 'love', 'light', 'beams', 'coming', 'barrack', 'few', 'actions', 'scenes', 'keep', 'excitement', 'level', 'high', 'told', 'excellent', 'movie', 'one', 'am', 'proud', 'own', 'shame', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'critics', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.The', 'Bad', 'not', 'say', 'perfect', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'following', 'alot', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'first', 'hour', 'end', 'when', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'introduced', 'much', 'scenes', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Also', 'dialogue', 'was', 'either', 'poorly', 'recorded', 'poorly', 'delivered', 'main', 'gripe', 'was', 'covered', 'misleading', 'marketing', 'film.The', 'Summation', 'Think', 'combination', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', 'A', 'FEW', 'GOOD', 'MEN', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'final', 'sum', 'being', 'just', 'few', 'notches', 'titles', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'give', 'chance']",Hart's War

This film isn't ""The Great Escape"" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.

As far as depicting life in a POW camp, ""Hart's War"" is pretty much on par with ""Hogan's Heroes"".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway?4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in ""Hart's War"", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic.5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous.6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid.7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't.8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, ""Hart's War"" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes.9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of ""Die Hard"" over and over and over again is tiring.10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are ""The Tuskeegee Airmen"" and ""Stalag 17"".  Hopefully in a few years, ""Hart's War"" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill.",1,Awful!,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,3247,"['Saw', 'Hart', 'War', 'other', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'invest', 'money', 'time', 'film', 'as', 'awful', 'one', 'film', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'yanked', 'circulation', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'Here', 'are', 'ten', 'reasons', 'why:1', 'film', ""n't"", 'Great', 'Escape', 'even', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'otherwise', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""n't"", 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Even', 'Willis', 'received', 'top', 'billing', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'vehicle.2', 'vast', 'majority', 'target', 'audience', '18-34', 'year', 'old', 'moviegoing', 'males', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'happened', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'much', 'less', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Hart', 'War', 'may', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'film', 'POW', 'camp', 'War', '1812', 'Anything', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Rock', 'would', 'be', 'bound', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets.3', 'As', 'far', 'depicting', 'life', 'POW', 'camp', 'Hart', 'War', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'Germans', 'are', 'nice', 'guys', 'guns', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'much', 'everyone', 'away', 'just', 'anything', 'Where', 'did', 'GI', 'get', 'cigarettes', 'anyway', '4', 'Stalag', 'Luft', 'comandant', 'weight', 'sauerkraut', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'killed', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'look', 'depicted', 'Hart', 'War', 'camp', 'commandant', 'portrayed', 'Marcel', 'Lures', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'maintaining', 'sort', 'status', 'officer', 'German', 'Army', 'collection', 'American', 'jazz/blues', 'records', 'cute', 'writer', 'invention', 'nothing', 'do', 'reality', 'situation', 'type', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'charge', 'German', 'POW', 'camps', 'reality', 'Marcel', 'Lures', 'character', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'type', 'nazi', 'camp', 'pink', 'triangle', 'sewn', 'front', 'tunic.5', 'storyline', 'not', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'trials', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'POW', 'camps', 'one', 'good', 'example', 'being', 'POW', 'who', 'were', 'tried', 'hung', 'Andersonville', 'However', 'whole', 'idea', 'camp', 'commandant', 'would', 'actively', 'participate', 'such', 'trial', 'sort', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'type', 'advocate', 'ludicrous.6', 'idea', 'trial', 'group', 'POW', 'who', 'escape', 'go', 'secret', 'mission', 'destroy', 'nearby', 'munitions', 'factory', 'insulting', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happen', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'bravery', 'poor', 'souls', 'only', 'act', 'heroism', 'was', 'survive', 'internment', 'harsh', 'sometimes', 'brutal', 'conditions', 'German', 'army', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'stupid.7', 'saw', 'film', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'maybe', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Beyond', 'being', 'sheer', 'Hollywood', 'political', 'correctness', 'Hart', 'War', 'seriously', 'many', 'more', 'important', 'aspects', 'internment', 'real', 'focus', 'life', 'such', 'Stalag', 'most', 'POW', 'was', 'just', 'day', 'day', 'survival', 'Also', 'soldiers', 'who', 'served', 'armed', 'forces', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'African', 'Americans', 'were', ""n't"", 'spineless', 'hapless', 'dopes.9', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'variations', 'Die', 'Hard', 'over', 'again', 'tiring.10', 'Better', 'films', 'same', 'sort', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'Stalag', '17', 'Hopefully', 'few', 'years', 'Hart', 'War', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'rotting', 'landfill']",Hart's War
497031,A1E0RPGCXS4L2G,B00000F2UF,TheHighlander,"[2, 4]","I didn't notice much advertisement or hype about this movie when it was in the theaters.  And after viewing it I'm not sure why.  I have read many criticism's on the movie and while some may be valid, no movie is perfect.The movie opens with LT. Hart, a rear echelon support staff soldier being captured in an ambush and being shipped to the hard reality of a prison camp.  This is quite a shock for the young LT.  At the prison camp he meets the Colonel (Bruce Willis) who is the ranking officer and somewhat of an enigma to the LT. throughout the movie.The young LT. has to prove himself to his new subordinates, his new superiors and to himself.  It is a bit of a ""coming of age"" type of movie if you look close enough.With turns at every corner this movie keeps you guessing until the very end.  It is full of surprises and the back-drop is stark and gives a great feel for what winter in a prison camp must have been like.  The stark reality of where they are keeps creeping in but is never really fully explored by the director.This is a good prison camp movie.  Not many bombs and guns for a war movie but it is still a good movie in time.  With a nod toward Stalag 17 and The Great Escape it makes its point.  Duty, honor, sacrifice and racism are themes of this movie.There seems to be a lot of fence walking on this movie but I enjoyed it very much.

497033,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00000F2UF,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Hart's War"" is about a lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who has to defend a falsely accused black pilot in a German POW camp (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs.This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"", albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of ""Hogan's Heroes: The Komplete Series, Kommandant's Kollection"" but without the comedy.The film isn't about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the court room drama. Some have complained that no facist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial. The commandant allows it (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's action-packed and ultimately quite moving.The film runs 125 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic.FINAL WORD: Although it failed at the box office in 2002, ""Hart's War"" is a very good WWII POW camp movie, in some ways great.GRADE: B+ or A-",4,"Like ""Hogan's Heroes"" but serious and quasi-realistic",1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1644,"['Hart', 'War', 'lieutenant', 'background', 'law', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'defend', 'falsely', 'accused', 'black', 'pilot', 'German', 'POW', 'camp', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'German', 'commandant', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'tough-as-nails', 'American', 'colonel', 'POWs.This', 'obviously', 'not', 'conventional', 'WWII', 'flick', 'out', 'great', 'war', 'action', 'more', 'common', 'films', 'Stalag', '17', 'Great', 'Escape', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'craft', 'title', 'blurb', 'points', 'out', 'reminiscent', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'Komplete', 'Series', 'Kommandant', 'Kollection', 'comedy.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'about', 'survival', 'POW', 'camp', 'rather', 'tensions', 'prisoners', 'court', 'room', 'drama', 'have', 'complained', 'facist', 'camp', 'colonel', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'allow', 'trial', 'commandant', '1', 'entertainment', '2', 'witness', 'understand', 'American', 'way', '3', 'knew', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'soon', 'wanted', 'have', 'Allie', 'favor', '4', 'mixture', 'above', 'Keep', 'mind', 'commandant', 'went', 'school', 'US', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'was', 'enamored', 'American', 'lifestyle', 'had', 'fondness', 'jazz', ""'m"", 'sure', 'entertainment', 'was', 'huge', 'factor', 'POW', 'camp', 'life', 'just', 'boring', 'captors', 'captives', 'time.The', 'climax', 'telegraphs', 'war', 'MOVIE', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'action-packed', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'moving.The', 'film', '125', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Czech', 'Republic.FINAL', 'WORD', 'failed', 'box', 'office', '2002', 'Hart', 'War', 'very', 'good', 'WWII', 'POW', 'camp', 'movie', 'ways', 'great.GRADE', 'B+', 'A-']",Hart's War
