It is perfect for Family Movie Nights! And as the series goes along, the bossy character(s) soften and get more loveable.  It does have it's share of smart mouthed kids ~ no cussing, but just a ""Know-it-all"" attitude which may concern some parents. But, over all the series is wonderful and PEACEFUL... truely one to not miss.",5,Road To Avonlea: A Family Favorite,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,423,"['Road', 'Avonlea', 'one', 'safest', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'possibly', 'watch', '~', 'especially', 'days', 'perfect', 'Family', 'Movie', 'Nights', 'series', 'along', 'bossy', 'character', 'soften', 'get', 'more', 'loveable', 'have', 'share', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'kids', '~', 'cussing', 'just', 'Know-it-all', 'attitude', 'may', 'concern', 'parents', 'series', 'wonderful', 'PEACEFUL', 'truely', 'one', 'not', 'miss']",N/A

I then remembered my Grandma watching a show called Avonlea when I was a kid, I never sat down and watched it with her...but after seeing the Anne movies I had to give them a try. When I saw how much they were I decided to rent some first. We rented season 1 and 2 and my kids (2, 4, and 6) and I loved them! Since we had recently seen 1 and 2 we decided to by season 3 first. Loved it too! So, much that we have already bought season 4! The one thing I would say about this season from a Christian perspective is that there were a couple episodes I wont show my young children until they are older. The episodes ""Vows of Silence"" (about judgement day, and not really and accurate biblical view of it) and ""After the Honeymoon"" (A temptress women after a married man). Some episodes in this series the children are quite naughty, but it makes for good discussions with my children afterwards. You can get these straight from the Sullivan Movies for $42.00 so don't pay more than that on Amazon...for instance today's price on Amazon is $50.00. Sometimes Amazon's price is good...sometimes not.

Comeaux ""AudioBook Fan Extraordinaire""","[0, 0]","The episode ""When she was bad, she was horrid"" features the amazing acting talents of Sarah Polley, playing two parts, the sweet Sara Stanley, and the pick-pocket Jo Pitts. The young actress goes much deeper than some crude behavior and language. She walks, talks, even looks different in the two roles. Watch her face, and observer her, and you'll be impressed.Of course, the rest of the episodes are classic, warm, Avonlea that we all love.

812745,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,B0001Q4D1K,Reliable Reviews Too,"[4, 4]","Charming children and adults get into fun predicaments. If you liked ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""Anne of Green Gables""; you should like this. Seasons 1-6 are excellent.Beautiful scenery, farm, horses, period costumes, with women in pretty dresses, period sets, realistic characters, likeable characters, lively pace, and inviting activities, take you to a nicer place.Christopher Reeve, from the movie ""Superman"", guest-stars in a melodrama, mysterious but lively episode ""A Dark and Stormy Night"" (Writer-Hart Hanson). Another good episode is where Sarah and Felicity babysit their little nephew who is a little terror; the ""Friends & Relations"" episode. Usually an episode is able to focus on just a few of the characters with depth; but in this unique episode, many of the characters interact, at a lively pace. Very creative that the writer (Heather Conkie) was able to involve everyone with depth (and I wonder if it was planned or just happened with the plot). The episode ""Vows of Silence"" has a scene that is very funny, and another quietly funny/charming scene (Writer-Hart Hanson).Mr. Sullivan spared no expense to create warm and humorous escapades.This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $5113 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode.

It is based in &#34;Avonlea&#34; the home of Anne of Green Gables, and Mrs. Rachel Lynde, one of my favorite characters is often featured.

Miss Hetty is rearing her niece played by Sarah Polley, who pals around with the King children.  Also featured is Miss King and Alec's sister, Olivia who is a newspaper woman.

Every episode provides something new to ponder and reflect on, and there's always an enlightening message at the end. Season 3 also happens to be one of the best seasons in the series (there are seven of them in all) and the episodes are:The Ties that Bind - explores both Hetty and Olivia's feelings as Olivia's marriage to Jasper looms on the horizon.But When She Was Bad...She was Horrid (Parts 1 & 2) - Sara Stanley, Hetty's niece is frustrated by what she perceives as her aunt controlling her life and runs away. A double stands in for her with predictably hilarious results.Felix and Blackie - Felix's entrepreneurial adventure with his horse Blackie.Another Point of View - I found this particularly interesting because of my educational background. Hetty resigns from her teaching post and is perturbed to find her replacement, Prof.Dimple using unconventional methods in his teaching.Aunt Janet Rebels - Aunt Janet puts her own marriage at risk by fighting for women's right to vote.A Dark and Stormy Night - Gus Pike finds employment at the White Sands hotel and gets involved in some mysterious activities.Friends and Relations - a fun episode where Sara and Felicity take charge of their naughty cousin Lucky as the adults pursue their own interests.Vows of Silence - Felicity finds herself in a pickle when she loses her mother's family heirloom which she took without Janet's permission.After the Honeymoon - Olivia tries to overcome her own fears to support her husband's work which involves research on bats.High Society - Felicity employs duplicity when she is offered a chance at winning a prestigious scholarship to a renowned ladies college.The Calamitous Courting of Hetty King - the romantic misadventures of Aunt Hetty.Old Friends, Old Wounds - death of a well-liked inhabitant in the town.The Road to Avonlea series is a beloved series which is sure to lift your spirits.
