195498,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,1892309165,Amanda Richards,"[30, 34]","What's great about Baby Shakespeare?1. The children singing the ABC song (twice)2. The format for teaching 12 words: train, flower, apple, cat, grass, frog, leaf, snow, tree, cow, butterfly, moon.  They say the word, then show the word on screen, then say it again, then show a picture of it.  The way they start with a rough sketch and morph into the real thing is also quite interesting.3. Music by Beethoven4. The poems have something to do with the words being taught.5. Lots of cool and colorful toys - the Baby Einstein series really loves toys with figures that climb stairs.6. Each segment starts with the click of a camera, so you know you're moving on to the next word.What's not so great about Baby Shakespeare?1. The actual theatre piece is only 28 minutes long.  The 101 minutes on the jacket includes a concert and poetry recital.  (This is video folks, not an audio cd)2. Some of the toys are in the wrong places. The ""cat"" segment has footage of a worm in an apple, the ""cow"" segment has a train.3. The poems are way above the level of the intended audience.  Couldn't they have found children's poems?I rated this 4 stars because my son loves it, especially the ABC song segments.  I have to wonder though, how poems by Nash, Kinnell, Yeats, Frost and Wordsworth, among others, relate to a monkey with cymbals, and a flatulence joke among cows.Kids from 1 year old will love the kidstuff, older folk will appreciate the poems, and try to remember the rest of the familiar ones.",4,For kids from 1 to 92?,1062892800,"09 7, 2003",2003,1494,"['What', 'great', 'Baby', 'Shakespeare', '1', 'children', 'singing', 'ABC', 'song', 'twice', '2', 'format', 'teaching', '12', 'words', 'train', 'flower', 'apple', 'cat', 'grass', 'frog', 'leaf', 'snow', 'tree', 'cow', 'butterfly', 'moon', 'say', 'word', 'then', 'show', 'word', 'screen', 'then', 'say', 'again', 'then', 'show', 'picture', 'way', 'start', 'rough', 'sketch', 'morph', 'real', 'thing', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting.3', 'Music', 'Beethoven4', 'poems', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'words', 'being', 'taught.5', 'Lots', 'cool', 'colorful', 'toys', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'series', 'really', 'toys', 'figures', 'climb', 'stairs.6', 'segment', 'click', 'camera', 'know', ""'re"", 'moving', 'next', 'word.What', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'Baby', 'Shakespeare', '1', 'actual', 'theatre', 'piece', 'only', '28', 'minutes', 'long', '101', 'minutes', 'jacket', 'concert', 'poetry', 'recital', 'video', 'folks', 'not', 'audio', 'cd', '2', 'toys', 'are', 'wrong', 'places', 'cat', 'segment', 'footage', 'worm', 'apple', 'cow', 'segment', 'train.3', 'poems', 'are', 'way', 'level', 'intended', 'audience', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'children', 'poems', 'rated', '4', 'stars', 'son', 'especially', 'ABC', 'song', 'segments', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'poems', 'Nash', 'Kinnell', 'Yeats', 'Frost', 'Wordsworth', 'others', 'relate', 'monkey', 'cymbals', 'flatulence', 'joke', 'cows.Kids', '1', 'year', 'old', 'will', 'love', 'kidstuff', 'older', 'folk', 'will', 'appreciate', 'poems', 'try', 'remember', 'rest', 'familiar', 'ones']",Baby Shakespeare

It is for a little older child, but it has poetry, more interesting toys to watch, drawings that turn into real objects (like a train, a cow, a flower, etc) and children singing their ABC's.  It also uses more hand puppets and has little funny skits that are adorable.My two year old son loves all of the Baby Einstein videos, but he asks for this one by name.  My only criticism is that all the children in the video are girls.

195501,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,1892309165,Joshua Koppel,"[10, 11]","This was once my daughter's favorite video.  Now it is fast becoming a favorite of my son's.  It is called Baby Shakespeare but there are only a few lines of his used.  This is similar to Baby Mozart with its footage of toys in motion and classical music, but this one has added poetry to the mix.The video is broken into segments.  Each segment begins with an opening curtain, a toy camera, and a word.  The word is shown and a poem about the word is used.  The poems are really not for children (especially the snow poem which is probably above many adult heads).  There is then plenty of footage of toys in motion.  The segments vary in length (Cat is really short).  The segments then end with a closing curtain.The credits attribute the music to Beethoven but there are at least two pieces using Mozart.  This one also uses more in the way of puppets, especially Bard the dragon (he's on the cover of the box).As a lover of classical music, I find this video far less annoying after numerous repetitions than many other children's videos.  Just remember to turn this one off before the ending credits.  After the sleepy final segment (Moon) hopefully lulls your child to sleep, the credits jump in with a rousing Ode to Joy.",5,"Puppets, Poetry, and Playthings",1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,1229,"['was', 'once', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'video', 'Now', 'fast', 'becoming', 'favorite', 'son', 'called', 'Baby', 'Shakespeare', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'used', 'similar', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'footage', 'toys', 'motion', 'classical', 'music', 'one', 'added', 'poetry', 'mix.The', 'video', 'broken', 'segments', 'segment', 'opening', 'curtain', 'toy', 'camera', 'word', 'word', 'shown', 'poem', 'word', 'used', 'poems', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'children', 'especially', 'snow', 'poem', 'probably', 'many', 'adult', 'heads', 'then', 'plenty', 'footage', 'toys', 'motion', 'segments', 'vary', 'length', 'Cat', 'really', 'short', 'segments', 'then', 'end', 'closing', 'curtain.The', 'credits', 'attribute', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'pieces', 'using', 'Mozart', 'one', 'also', 'more', 'way', 'puppets', 'especially', 'Bard', 'dragon', 'cover', 'box', 'lover', 'classical', 'music', 'find', 'video', 'far', 'less', 'annoying', 'numerous', 'repetitions', 'many', 'other', 'children', 'videos', 'Just', 'remember', 'turn', 'one', 'off', 'ending', 'credits', 'sleepy', 'final', 'segment', 'Moon', 'hopefully', 'child', 'sleep', 'credits', 'jump', 'rousing', 'Ode', 'Joy']",Baby Shakespeare

Just hearing the start of the music and seeing the little pull toy catepillar crawl across the screen is enough to get my little one jumping up and down and excited to see HIS movie !!

195503,A1RAK16OATTV99,1892309165,"M. Gross ""Mom of 2 Kids & 2 Labs""","[3, 3]","My 2 year old absolutely loves this video!  She asks for it by calling it the &quot;Dragon&quot; video and she loves the main character, Bard.  It is full of goofy toddler fun and jokes and she laughs through it every time, and anticipates the parts she thinks are funniest.  She says, &quot;Look, look mommy!&quot; and then eagerly watches for my reaction as she is cracking up at the snow falling on Bard's head, or some other silliness.  We have a video player and screen in our car, and the player has a headset so we don't have to hear the videos.  This video makes her laugh in her car seat, just like in the minivan ads and her sweet laughter makes us so happy, especially on long trips!  She would watch this video over and over if we'd let her.  Also, my version came with the music CD and not the book.  I always play her music when she plays inside and I was surprised that she knew the music apart from the video when she heard it; she told me it was the Dragon music and was very happy to hear it.  I have an 8 month old who likes watching this video with his sister, but I think he gets more of a kick out of watching and hearing his sister's enjoyment than the tv.  I highly recommend this video!  I have the Baby Einstein too, but the reaction from this one was by far better than most of her other videos.",5,Helpless giggles and more!,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,1322,"['2', 'year', 'old', 'absolutely', 'video', 'calling', 'quot', 'Dragon', 'quot', 'video', 'main', 'character', 'Bard', 'full', 'goofy', 'toddler', 'fun', 'jokes', 'time', 'parts', 'thinks', 'are', 'funniest', 'quot', 'Look', 'look', 'mommy', 'quot', 'then', 'eagerly', 'watches', 'reaction', 'cracking', 'up', 'snow', 'falling', 'Bard', 'head', 'other', 'silliness', 'have', 'video', 'player', 'screen', 'car', 'player', 'headset', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hear', 'videos', 'video', 'laugh', 'car', 'seat', 'just', 'minivan', 'ads', 'sweet', 'laughter', 'so', 'happy', 'especially', 'long', 'trips', 'would', 'watch', 'video', ""'d"", 'let', 'Also', 'version', 'came', 'music', 'CD', 'not', 'book', 'always', 'play', 'music', 'when', 'inside', 'was', 'surprised', 'knew', 'music', 'apart', 'video', 'when', 'heard', 'told', 'was', 'Dragon', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'hear', 'have', '8', 'month', 'old', 'who', 'watching', 'video', 'sister', 'think', 'more', 'kick', 'watching', 'hearing', 'sister', 'enjoyment', 'tv', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'have', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'too', 'reaction', 'one', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'videos']",Baby Shakespeare
195504,ALWKZ81HDSCC1,1892309165,Stefanie  N,"[10, 10]","I'd bet that a lot of would-be buyers are scared off by the title, wondering if their 1-year old is quite ready for King Lear.  Actually the  readings are derived from a variety of poets most of whom employ crisp  imagery and generally easy-to-grasp similes that make one (parents and  older kids) see things in a new way.  The pacing of this video is perhaps  more leisurely than Baby Mozart, more contemplative.  There are still the  usual group of puppets and toys however as well as some semi-violent  slapstick that some parents might find objectionable ( I did not).  Initially our 16-month old was bothered by the photographic sequences of  real-life snow, flora and fauna, preferring the video sequences of toys  against blank backdrops.  However, the video does a wonderful job of  creating transitions between drawings of real world objects and  photographs.  The first gradually morphs into the second.  Now he is very  enthusiastic about the video as a whole.  I would recommend this video as a  followup to Baby Mozart and Baby Bach (the latter of which is good, but I  would agree that it is the weakest of the group.)",4,Perhaps  a different title (would smell as sweet)?,968716800,"09 12, 2000",2000,1132,"[""'d"", 'bet', 'lot', 'would-be', 'buyers', 'are', 'scared', 'off', 'title', 'wondering', '1-year', 'old', 'quite', 'ready', 'King', 'Lear', 'Actually', 'readings', 'are', 'derived', 'variety', 'poets', 'most', 'whom', 'employ', 'crisp', 'imagery', 'generally', 'easy-to-grasp', 'similes', 'make', 'one', 'parents', 'older', 'kids', 'see', 'things', 'new', 'way', 'pacing', 'video', 'perhaps', 'more', 'leisurely', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'more', 'contemplative', 'are', 'still', 'usual', 'group', 'puppets', 'however', 'as', 'well', 'semi-violent', 'slapstick', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'objectionable', 'did', 'not', 'Initially', '16-month', 'old', 'was', 'bothered', 'photographic', 'sequences', 'real-life', 'snow', 'flora', 'fauna', 'preferring', 'video', 'sequences', 'toys', 'blank', 'backdrops', 'However', 'video', 'wonderful', 'job', 'creating', 'transitions', 'drawings', 'real', 'world', 'objects', 'photographs', 'first', 'gradually', 'morphs', 'second', 'Now', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'video', 'whole', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'followup', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'Baby', 'Bach', 'latter', 'good', 'would', 'agree', 'weakest', 'group']",Baby Shakespeare
