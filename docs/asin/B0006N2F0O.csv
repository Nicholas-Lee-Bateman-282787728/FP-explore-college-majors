871493,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0006N2F0O,andy8047,"[4, 6]","Will Smith,originally known to the public as The Fresh Prince enjoyed success as a rap music artist. He was at least nominated for a Grammy for his 1988 hit,PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. On this NBC sitcom,Smith made his acting debut as himself. ""In west Philadelphia,born and raised,on the playground where I spent most of my days."",is a sample lyric from the theme written and performed by Smith. Smith is ordered by his parents to move to Bel Air,California to live with his aunt and uncle. Some kind of trouble led to this. TFPOBA premiered in the fall of 1990,gradually bringing down the ratings of another hit sitcom of NBC's,The Cosby Show. Smith's increasing notoriety led to a movie career. His film debut was in the Warner Bros. comedy,MADE IN AMERICA starring Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson. By the way,TFPOBA gradually brought Danson's sitcom Cheers' ratings down also. After The Cosby Show ended its eight-year run in 1992 and Cheers ended its eleven-year run the following year,TFPOBA retained its position in the Nielsen Top 10. The 1995-96 season would be the last for TFPOBA. After MADE IN AMERICA,Smith starred in films such as MEN IN BLACK,MEN IN BLACK 2,BAD BOY and ALI. Also after the run of TFPOBA,Smith took Jada Pinkett to be his lawfully wedded wife.

Young Will, fresh from the Streets of ""West Philadelphia born & raised"", arrives at the Banks mansion, where his guardians are Uncle Phil & Aunt Vivian. Will was sent to Bel-Air by his mother for lessons in learning & love, as well as some straightening out. Cousins Ashley & Carlton are also here to help Will along his new life path of learning, as is evidenced in this first season. As we can see right off the bat, Will has trouble blending into his new surroundings at first in ""The Fresh Prince Project"". Will tends to get on everyone's nerves (including Geoffrey, the Bankses butler - played by Joseph Marcell) with his unique brand of mayhem, which has the Banks household up in arms. Will's streetwise humor doesn't sit too well with Uncle Phil (played by James Avery) when he encourages Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) to ditch the violin & take up the drums in ""Bang The Drum, Ashley"". Will's old friend from the 'hood doesn't score any points with Phil either in ""Homeboy, Sweet Homeboy"" - starring Don Cheadle as Ice Tray, who Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) takes an instant liking to. A day at the mall is an adventurous one, as Will & Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) vie for the affections of a cute young lady, while Phil & Vivian do some shopping, especially Aunt Viv with her talent for singing! This is a two-part episode titled ""Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect"". Will joins the basketball team at school, which has Carlton feeling envious of Will's athletic talent in ""Courting Disaster"". The holidays are a special time in Bel-Air, as Will's mother (Vernee Watson-Johnson) arrives in Bel-Air for a visit, only to find Will's Bel-Air lifestyle has left him spoiled, so Vy has Will & the rest of the children cooking Thanksgiving dinner - with disastrous results! Ashley tells Will she's never had a real Christmas, so Will pulls all the stops in ""Deck The Halls"". When Will goes all out, he REALLY goes all-out in this hilarious episode! Will suggests a Black History class be taught at Bel-Air Academy, but has second thoughts when Vivian instructs the class & gives Will & Carlton extra assignments over the other students. Will makes a bet with Carlton that Carlton cannot last more than a day in Jazz's (DJ Jazzy Jeff) Compton neighborhood, but to Will & Jazz's amazement, it turns out Carlton has no trouble adjusting! As you can see, there are plenty of great episodes, as well as laughs, of which there are plenty to go around in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete First Season"".

Not only was Will great, but the whole Banks family was composed of amazing actors, particularly James Avery and Alfonso Ribiero. It's great to see the strides that they all, not just Will, made as actors as the show kept going. Their acting was a little shaky in the first few episodes.This first season contains many of my favorite episodes, I'm just glad that it finally came to DVD and was just $23. The DVD's are a little dissappointing. There is only one trace of bonus features, on the last disc, and each episode was not divided into scenes. The main menu is the exact same for each disc.

I had forgotten how hilarious it was!  We find a young youth by the name of Will Smith unceremoniously removed from his home in southern Philadelphia by his mother who is concerned for his well being.  He is ousted from his friends, his culture, his way of life, to be thrown into the upper percentile of Bel-Air living.  His aunt, Vivian Banks, has agreed to take him under her care to see that he gets a good education and stays out of trouble.  Together with her family they attempt to welcome Will into their home, most likely with the expectation that they will be similar to them or grow to be similar to them.  This is far from the case.  What ensues is a hilarious commentary on racial culture, family, beliefs, identity, and about the white supremest society that had ""Black Power"" society turning to face the opposition.The actors that comprise the family are a simply perfect fit for one another and work well to produce such a fantastic comedy.  They have multi-layered personalities that entice and intrigue us into relating to them and the issues that are presented in stark relief of a humorous background.  Often the show borderlines on pure slapstick, but more often than that it balances precariously on the edge of racial inequalities and a healthy dose of laughter.  To balance the slapstick there are also times where a seriousness prevails over the entire show that either forces us to learn life lessons or to try and teach and instruct on how the United States regards African American citizens.A purely laugh-out-loud comedy that is still relevant, despite the early 90s clothing style, to today!",5,Clash of Culture,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,1769,"['Seeing', 'how', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'found', 'hold', 'youth', 'interest', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'hilarious', 'was', 'find', 'young', 'youth', 'name', 'Will', 'Smith', 'unceremoniously', 'removed', 'home', 'southern', 'Philadelphia', 'mother', 'who', 'concerned', 'well', 'being', 'ousted', 'friends', 'culture', 'way', 'life', 'be', 'thrown', 'upper', 'percentile', 'Bel-Air', 'living', 'aunt', 'Vivian', 'Banks', 'agreed', 'take', 'care', 'see', 'good', 'education', 'trouble', 'Together', 'family', 'attempt', 'welcome', 'Will', 'home', 'most', 'likely', 'expectation', 'will', 'be', 'similar', 'grow', 'be', 'similar', 'far', 'case', 'What', 'hilarious', 'commentary', 'racial', 'culture', 'family', 'beliefs', 'identity', 'white', 'supremest', 'society', 'had', 'Black', 'Power', 'society', 'turning', 'face', 'opposition.The', 'actors', 'comprise', 'family', 'are', 'simply', 'perfect', 'fit', 'one', 'work', 'well', 'produce', 'fantastic', 'comedy', 'have', 'multi-layered', 'personalities', 'entice', 'intrigue', 'relating', 'issues', 'are', 'presented', 'stark', 'relief', 'humorous', 'background', 'show', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'more', 'often', 'precariously', 'edge', 'racial', 'inequalities', 'healthy', 'dose', 'laughter', 'balance', 'slapstick', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'where', 'seriousness', 'entire', 'show', 'forces', 'learn', 'life', 'lessons', 'try', 'teach', 'instruct', 'how', 'United', 'States', 'regards', 'African', 'American', 'citizens.A', 'purely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'still', 'relevant', 'early', '90s', 'clothing', 'style', 'today']",N/A

I was still in middle school while new episodes were still airing. And surprisingly enough, the show has held up remarkably well over the years. I still found myself laughing, much to my surprise, at the little antics and mannerisms of all of the characters. Yes there is a lot of corny humor, yes there is a laugh track in the background, but this is still undeniably the show that made Will Smith and with good reason. This is vintage Will Smith at his absolute best. Yet, he doesn't completely steal the show as all of the side characters have depth as well. Uncle Phil, Carlton, the once innocent Ashley, ditzy Hillary, and the serious but snide butler Geoffrey. They're just as funny as you remember them the first time around.This is good, clean, family humor and there are even a few moral lessons to be learned here and there. The innocence of this show is something that stands out compared to all of the other ""darker"" shows which permeate television screens these days. This is the very light hearted first season (of six) of the Fresh Prince, and although the show does get a bit more serious later on, it never escalates to the point where the show becomes unsuitable for young children. The show, as well all know of course, is comedic in nature.Yes, there is a lot of nostalgia associated with this show for me personally, as well as probably many others who have purchased this set. But I can honestly say that this is a show I would appreciate on merit alone if I had not spent all those years growing up with show. For Fresh Prince fans, it goes without saying buy this. And for everyone else who may have missed out on this show the first time around, I think you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.

Many of the themes in the first season were about Will (Will Smith/Fresh Prince) adjusting to life with the upper class and breaking down stereotypes of lower class blacks to his sheltered and ignorant cousins Hillary, Carlton and Ashley.  In turn, they showed him that just because you're rich and educated doesn't mean that you're not ""black"".  The show, though not one of the best, had a lot of intriguing social concepts that it sought to explore and did so with good humour.  Later on as it progressed (and they changed Vivians, what was up with that?

Now, let's get jiggy with this review.The first season of many TV shows often shows the series in development--with certain aspects needing tweaking, characters in progress, etc.  Not in this case!  Right from the get-go, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air reveals what it's all about: wit, positivity, sass, education, family values; you name it, the show's got it!  The pilot episode is the best episode in the season, IMO.  All the characters/actors get to shine equally, and as a viewer, you get a real feel for who they are and what they're all about.  You also get to see and hear the complete music video for the show's theme song--as composed and performed by Will Smith himself.  After the first few episodes in the season/series, the theme song and video would be edited to just over a minute--cutting out the second-, and part of the third verse and introduction.  Still great though!Anyway, Season 1 of The Fresh Prince really focuses on character-actor Will Smith's transition from Philadelphia to California.  While that theme reigned throughout much of the series, Season 1 is all about cultural elements from both geographic areas--and how Will adjusts to one while maintaining the other.  He even schools his family and friends on what life is like on the rough streets--brilliantly, I might add!  His presence at Bel-Air Prep. Academy alongside his cousin Carlton (played by Alfonso Ribeiro) makes for an absolute comedic blast!  Plus, this is the season where Janet Hubert-Whitten (the first actress who played Will's Aunt Vivian Banks, from Season 1-Season 3, before politics unfortunately got in the way and she was let go of her role) gets to bask in the sunlight of her talent as an actress.  For some reason, the writers toned down her character a little bit in Seasons 2 and 3.  But in Season 1, she is raw, hot, and on fire as she delivers one feisty, well-recited, lesson-learned line after another!  You can even get a glimpse into her natural singing talents in episodes like ""The Ethnic Tip""--when she becomes a long-term sub for Will and Carlton's history teacher for Black History Month, and gives her son and nephew a taste of what hard work for something you believe in truly brings.  That's another favorite episode of mine.Other greats include ""Talking Turkey""--when Will's mother, Vy, flies into Bel-Air from Philly for Thanksgiving, and turns the entire Banks household upside down with her opposite (obviously better) work ethic and values for the kids.  EVERY parent should see that episode WITH their children!  When finished watching all episodes, definitely tune into the bonus features.  You'll get great, in-depth interviews from the writers and producers on the development and expansion of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as firsthand eyewitnesses from actors James Avery (Uncle Phil), Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey the Butler), Tatyana M. Ali (Ashley Banks), and Karen Parsons (Hillary Banks).  Plus, you'll learn about the background of the hilarious Jazz (played by DJ Jazzy Jeff, Will Smith's musical sidekick on the show, and in real life prior to its creation) and his routine tosses out of the house by Uncle Phil.  LOL!!!All in all, Season 1 proves that Will Smith, the supporting cast, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as a complete TV show are worth more money than gold!

Watching these classic episodes is like reliving my childhood due to the fact that the reruns played on network television (and now cable) were only syndicated versions (meaning that they cut down at least 2 minutes of original scenes from the NBC airings).  The DVD set contains episodes from the original NBC airings plus they show the full length theme song for the first few episodes.  The first episode is really a overnight rags to riches story with some very important values to go along with it.  Unlike the 3rd season and beyond, the first and second season does'nt contain much (or any at all) conscientiousness or political issues that would plague the series in the future.  As the episodes progress, it contains some message oriented subjects yet it remins carefree, family oriented, funny at the same time (simular to The Cosby Show).Will Smith's carefree attitude puts some light in the Banks household and his Aunt Vivian (occasionally) and kid cousin Ashely are the only household members to accept them.  Will's other cousins Cartlon Banks is your average preppy, pompous ""kiss-butt"" and Hilary Banks is your average airheaded, shopping-crazied, spoiled brat, however their odd personalites add some substance to the show that balanaces Will's personality.  Uncle Phillip Banks is a successful lawyer, yet aggrevated uncle that tends to be the ""butt"" of Will's jokes as well as Geoffrey's, the humorless English butler, in upcoming seasons (in thanks to Will's influence).  He accepts his nephew more like a son in the upcoming seasons.  Supporting chartacter, Jazz (DJ Jazzy Jeff) is a extra dose of the series' comedy relief of which adds on to Uncle Phil's aggrevation (leading to the continious gag of throwing him out the Banks' mansion).Moving on to the episodes, If I'm forced to pick my top five it would be ""72 Hours, It Had To Be You, Bang The Drum Ashley, Knowledge Is Power, and Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect.""  There is not one episode in this season I would have to call mediocre except for Lucky Charm - predictable story on how one of Philip's legal partners randomly uses Will as a good luck charm for his own financial gain.  I called this episode mediocre mainly because it reminds me of a lame episode from season 5 of which Philip's friend tries to get Will to deliver a questionable briefcase after showering him (and his cousins) with gifts.  Other than that, there are really no complaints and its fair to say that the first season is more than a warm up!

After years of success in the music industry, Will Smith diversifies by starring in his own sitcom. The result: episode after episode of hilarity.For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, allow me to fill you in. Will Smith is a high schooler from West Philly, whose mother sends him out to Bel Air to live with his uncle and aunt. Being from a rough background, Will's new posh surroundings don't always allow for a smooth transition period. Therein lies the hilarity.The jokes about Uncle Phil's weight, Carlton's ""lack of blackness"" and Geoffrey's dead-pan dry humour remains ""fresh"" (pardon the pun) after all these years. Will Smith is a natural right from episode one, and through the first season we see growth in his acting skills.Besides being unbelievably funny, the show often has strong statements to make about racism, honesty, social class struggles, and more. But don't worry, not an episode will go by where you don't find yourself laughing out loud.Extra features are limited to one short featurette about the show's birth. While it is definitely an interesting bonus, it would have been nice if there had been a little more ""stuff"".

871534,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0006N2F0O,Twiddles42,"[11, 21]","It's not just that Fresh Prince is one of the funniest-ever shows that's also one of the few to retain its quality and, well, freshness; it's also been given great treatment from Warner Bros, a company that proves that it is okay to release a TV series using the highest means possible while still charging a decent price - one comparable to many sitcoms given less than half the treatment.  I applaud any company that keeps the consumer in mind, and Warner Bros has done so for many series inb many genres.The ""Fresh Prince"" series was well written, well cast, well acted.  It's got cast chemistry, great jokes, one-liners, and gags, charming when it needs to be, rounded viewpoints when Phil and Will spar off (and not always followed by a jibe from Will), and Joseph Marcell's top notch deadpan wit only sweetens the pot.  Definitely a show to be seen.This series proved that Will Smith could be big in Hollywood, though it's ironic to note that his only post-Fresh job that's as memorable or worth remembering is ""Enemy of the State"" (where Will proves he's a terrific dramatic actor as well; a movie I'd readily recommend...)Fresh Prince fans will love the show's treatment on DVD; from high quality visuals and sound to the bonus material.  Newbies will enjoy the 'freshness' and optimistic production (even with the occasional wobbly set, big deal) that ensured its success as an instant ratings hit.  This show appeals to all and it's easy to understand why.But I rather preferred ""Fresh Prince"" When Janet Hubert-Whitten played Aunt Vivian; her replacement Daphne Maxwell-Reid didn't fit in nearly as well.  Janet's leaving was due to 'creative differences' between herself and Will Smith.  And to prove how Will Smith really didn't have what it took to become executive producer, the first episode with the new Viv has Jazz saying ""there's something different about you!' (regarding Viv mk II) and Will turns to look at the camera.  (it's also been said that Janet was pregnant and was fired for that; but Aunt Viv was pregnant in season 3.  Why not just write it in as her having another child, with Will making another award winning jibe?  So I don't buy the idea that it was a conflict between 'biology' and 'balance sheet'.)

I have loved the show for many years often watching repeats constantly aired on TV. I never could work out how I found the jokes so funny even though I could virtually recite every line. It's one of those rare programs that never loses its appeal.It's a show that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself and rarely takes itself seriously. Having said that, there is usually a moral at the end of every story and this is drilled into the audience. That's the only time it even remotely takes itself seriously.The actors appear to be having great fun playing their characters and every character has their place in the show adding to the comedy. Will and Carlton are my personal favourites but they only would be half as funny without the rest of the family to gel the whole thing together.There are also a number of cameo roles littered throughout the first season ranging from Quincey Jones to Queen Latifah and even Evander Holyfield.There is little in the way of extras here. The only extra you get is a brief 10 or 15 minute look back at the first series featuring comments from some of the actors (though Will Smith is absent among others). What you do get is 25 brilliant episodes of arguably the best comedy of the 90s all spread onto 5 discs.So thats the first of the 6 seasons brought to DVD. I for one hope they bring out the rest of the seasons as I'll be sure to snap them up the first chance I get. Fresh Prince of Bel Air is a show that can easily be watched over and over again. I would recommend this to anyone with a sense of humour. And if you dont have a sense a humour?
