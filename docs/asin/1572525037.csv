Salama,"[0, 0]","I have seen most of Eric Rohmer's films, but it took me a while to see this elegant movie from 1982, perhaps because it has the critical reputation of being one of his weaker efforts. Sabine (Rohmer regular Beatrice Romand, in a fine performance that makes us empathize with an immature and not very sympathetic character) is a young woman, tired of her relationship with a married man. She breaks up with him and decides it's time to marry. Not to anyone in particular, she just thinks its time to find someone that is good enough and settle with him and marry. In one party, she meets Edmond, a thirty-something lawyer (Andre Dussolier, a character actor from many French movies), a serious and handsome man who is a cousin to her best friend. She approaches him, he is polite to her but seems uninterested in her advances. But she interprets this as him playing hard to get, so in the following days she would step up her advances, to the point where she starts acting in an increasingly erratic manner. Not much more than this happens in the film, until towards the end we learn of the result of her pursuit of Edmond.What some reviewers objected to in this film was that her behavior was unrealistic, but I don't feel that way (I certainly have known women of this type, though of course movies tend to exaggerate behaviors). ""No man can resist me"", Sabine boasts when Edmond politely rejects her advances. She has the arrogance some beautiful women have when they are young and pretty (since beauty fades and tends to do it faster than expected, women like this are in for some reality check when they age).So, summing up, while this might not be among Rohmer's very best, it is certainly well done, and above his average.",5,Fine example of a Rohmer film,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1728,"['have', 'seen', 'most', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'took', 'while', 'see', 'elegant', 'movie', '1982', 'perhaps', 'critical', 'reputation', 'being', 'one', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'Sabine', 'Rohmer', 'regular', 'Beatrice', 'Romand', 'fine', 'performance', 'empathize', 'immature', 'not', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'young', 'woman', 'tired', 'relationship', 'married', 'man', 'up', 'time', 'marry', 'Not', 'anyone', 'particular', 'just', 'thinks', 'time', 'find', 'someone', 'good', 'enough', 'settle', 'marry', 'one', 'party', 'Edmond', 'thirty-something', 'lawyer', 'Andre', 'Dussolier', 'character', 'actor', 'many', 'French', 'movies', 'serious', 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'cousin', 'best', 'friend', 'polite', 'uninterested', 'advances', 'playing', 'hard', 'get', 'so', 'following', 'days', 'would', 'step', 'up', 'advances', 'point', 'where', 'acting', 'increasingly', 'erratic', 'manner', 'Not', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'end', 'learn', 'result', 'pursuit', 'Edmond.What', 'reviewers', 'objected', 'film', 'was', 'behavior', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'certainly', 'have', 'known', 'women', 'type', 'course', 'movies', 'tend', 'exaggerate', 'behaviors', 'man', 'can', 'resist', 'Sabine', 'when', 'Edmond', 'politely', 'advances', 'arrogance', 'beautiful', 'women', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'pretty', 'beauty', 'fades', 'tends', 'do', 'faster', 'expected', 'women', 'are', 'reality', 'check', 'when', 'age', '.So', 'summing', 'up', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'Rohmer', 'very', 'best', 'certainly', 'well', 'done', 'average']",N/A

She throws herself body and soul into his conquest, leaving her old boy friend in the dust. To say she is single minded in pursuit of this Parisian lawyer is a vast understatement. Virtually everyone will find themselves thanking the powers that be that they are not the Parisian lawyer.  I am sure most men dread finding themselves in this quandary. The natural reaction is to think of her as a fruitcake and to have very little sympathy for her, especially if you are a man.  Then she does something that makes this movie extraordinary.  She laughs at herself.  She sees the utter ludicrousness of what she is doing and just laughs at herself. This may seem like a simple thing but I can't think of another film which has done something so spectacular.  This after all is what separates the ordinary person who wants to fall in love, get married, have a family, and grow old together from a crazed stalker.  Almost every other film maker would have chosen to make this a crazed stalker film.  But Eric Rohmer instead gave us a nuanced, complex view of ordinary people who often make fools of themselves over their personal lives.  Yet most of them have developed senses of humor as part of their adaptation skills so they can dust themselves off and go on.

187647,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,1572525037,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","Eric Rohmer's main subject in his filmmaking is a relatively narrow one in the sense that he tends to focus nearly always on young, middle or upper-middle class French people caught in the travails of finding or losing love; though there are obviously infinite variations on such a subject, still it's not hard to talk about a ""typical"" Rohmer film in a way that wouldn't have the same meaning if referring to his contemporaries Godard or Rivette, for example.  I suspect that most viewers identify with his great theme and appreciate his way with it - or don't - and it would seem that for most, Rohmer's films more than almost any director's are going to be consistently of the same quality.  The differences, then, lie in how much one cares about or is interested in the particular protagonists, and how well thought-out the storylines are.  LE BEAU MARIAGE, for me, approaches brilliance.As always, it's a fairly simple story given complexity by it's main character's actions and our gradually deeper understanding of her personality.  She is Sabine (B&eacute;atrice Romand), a 25-year-old art student also working in a small antique store to pay the bills, who is in the habit of dating married men, and at the beginning of the film she breaks up with her latest conquest Simon (F&eacute;odor Atkine), an artist with a studio-cum-hideaway in Paris.  He irritates her by taking a phone call from his wife while they are making love, and while we identify with her annoyance, she seems to lash out pretty hard right away - an impulse, agressive side is soon revealed.  Back in her mother's house in Le Mans, she soon takes her impulsiveness further, telling her best friend Clarisse (Arielle Dombasle) that she's getting married (without yet having an idea to whom), and then latching onto Clarisse's decade-older cousin Edmond (Andr&eacute; Dussollier) who fulfills her requirement of having a good job and living in Paris.  He seems to like her too, at first, but it's not hard to imagine that her pushiness might have consequences that she doesn't expect, especially after she takes him to buy an antique piece of porcelain that her boss was hoping to acquire ...This is a beautifully put together story of a headstrong young woman, a type we've all known (or been) probably, whether male or female:  often soliciting advice, but usually ignoring it, rushing into things that she doesn't really understand, grabbing at straws while ignoring the fact that the haystack is falling away from her.  Numerous members of her family and friends let her know early on that choosing to get married just for the sake of getting married isn't of much value - it's fascinating to notice that this modern ""liberated"" young woman, willing to push herself forward sexually, confident in her seductive powers, is yet so old-fashioned as to want a man to take care of her, and to go to church to pray for it.  There are many such ironic moments in the film, and Rohmer and Romand wisely make Sabine irritating enough that we are amused when she falls flat - but human and endearing enough at the same time that we want her to learn, not to be punished or truly hurt.The cast is exemplary here; Romand is, as I said, both charming and winsome, and irritating and pushy - I think she may be one of the most well fleshed-out of all of Rohmer's female protagonists.  Dombasle's pale, ethereal beauty and softer disposition offer nice contrasts to her best friend's fire, and as different as they are it's not hard to really see how they could be friends; and Dussollier manages the difficult task of being an obviously wrong object of desire who goes from sympathetic to spineless to exasperated, all in the same short and brilliant climactic scene.  The secondary cast are all fine as well, all more or less tolerant and patient with Sabine - until they can't be anymore, which happens for almost all of them.  I liked this on the whole a bit more thanFull Moon in Parisfrom a couple of years later with which it shares many strong similarities; it's also a little bit more visually interesting, with a wider range of locations and sets.All in all, this is one of my favorite Rohmer films at this point.  I have the VHS; it's apparently OP in all formats in the USA at this time, which is a shame.  Hopefully Criterion - or someone - will put together a set of all the ""Comedies and Proverbs"" before too long.

Sabine (Beatrice Romand) is tired of being used and treaded on lightly by her married boyfriend, so after dumping him, she decides she is going to get married.  As she explains to her artist friend Clarisse (Arielle Dombasle) she is going to get herself a husband without bedding him first and that's that.  She hasn't any prospects, but Clarisse deliberately tries to push her and her cousin Edmond (Andre' Dussollier), who is a lawyer, together at a sister's wedding.From the beginning, it is very clear that he isn't interested as he just runs out after a phone call.  Clarisse insists she has recognized love at first sight and, though Sabine is cool about it, she single-mindedly and relentlessly begins to persue him, determined to make him her husband ""whether he likes it or not!""One can admire Sabine on the one hand for fearlessly going after what she wants, having decided to up her scruples and better things for herself.  On the other hand, one gets annoyed at her  childlike tantrum-throwing behavior, particularly at her birthday party when he shows up late.  I actually felt sorry for him as she wouldn't stop calling his office, then eventually showed up there for a one-on-one in which he informs her he's written her a letter.  I also took her side as he spewed off the same old excuse in subtitles:  ""It's not you, it's me.""  A man  who avoids you and sends you a letter is pointedly telling you that it's you, and saying that it's him is a paltry attempt to be kind.I do like how she is able to pick herself up and start all over again, realizing her mistake, and I love the humorous ray of hope at the end, which I won't give away.  Sabine is a typical young woman learning all about herself and relating to others around her, and Clarisse is her eternally optimistic, romantic best friend.  Their relationship and Sabine's with her family say much about her personality and attitude.  This is a meaningful, yet fun and enjoyable movie that teaches important lessons about your will and others' being complete opposites.

Of course, Clarisse's apparent freedom is illusory and she sees her marriage for what it truly is, an unnecessary stricture imposed on her by society, or rather the bourgeois stratum of society to which she so evidently belongs. Sabine does not see the limitations of Clarisse's existence, she sees only the perceived benefits of being a kept woman. Her ideas of marriage are as muddled and absurdly childish as her views on feminism, so the learning curve she subjects herself to as she goes after her idea of connubial bliss will inevitably be a steep and painful one.She is introduced to Clarisse's cousin Edmond(Andre Dussolier),a lawyer,who she meets at an engagement party,who thinking nothing of the meeting doesn't return her calls.She arranges to sell him a vase for his mother through a customer. It becomes all too evident to Edmund that Sabine is behaving like a predator with he as the prey,he has no intention of being any woman's targeted catch.Her idea of marriage is not predicated on love or even compatibility.Edmond's needs have not been taken into account.Funny, touching and beautifully acted, Le Beau Mariage is acutely exact both psychologically and socially, not least in the way the troubled heroine shuttles between the busy highways of Paris and the ancient cobbled streets of Le Mans, with the different settings ironically reflecting the paradox that this paragon of women's lib chooses to see liberation as means to allowing her to live like a Victorian lady of leisure. But, as we see from the film's ending, the experience was well worthwhile. I liked the 3 main performances,for Rohmer's refusal to mock the heroine's goals and to leave hope,the emphasis on movement through travel or conversation,the colour scheme of the film,the lightness of touchon serious subjects.Best seen as part of the part of the series Comedies and Proverbs.",4,The rational pursuit of love,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2791,"['2nd', 'series', 'films', 'called', 'Comedies', 'Proverbs', 'tendency', 'build', 'castles', 'air.Sabine', 'Beatrice', 'Romand', 'had', 'affairs', 'married', 'men', 'resolved', 'much', 'surprise', 'mother', 'ex-lovers', 'married', 'artist', 'friend', 'Clarisse', 'Arielle', 'Dombastle', 'who', 'amused', 'first', 'yet', 'becomes', 'hermatchmaker', 'choose', 'husband.She', 'art', 'history', 'student', 'who', 'Le', 'Mans', 'mother', 'sister', 'travels', 'Paris', 'study', 'masters', 'degree', 'also', 'antique', 'shop.She', 'combination', 'impulse', 'reasonableness', 'being', 'conventionally', 'pretty.The', 'centre', 'movie', 'contrast', 'Sabine', 'Clarisse', 'whereby', 'Sabine', 'folly', 'exposed', 'Sabine', 'Clarisse', 'acme', 'womanhood', 'happily', 'married', 'wealthy', 'man', 'able', 'indulge', 'artistic', 'interests', 'freed', 'burden', 'having', 'earn', 'own', 'wage', 'supplement', 'household', 'income', 'course', 'Clarisse', 'apparent', 'freedom', 'illusory', 'marriage', 'what', 'truly', 'unnecessary', 'stricture', 'imposed', 'society', 'rather', 'bourgeois', 'stratum', 'society', 'so', 'evidently', 'belongs', 'Sabine', 'not', 'see', 'limitations', 'Clarisse', 'existence', 'only', 'perceived', 'benefits', 'being', 'kept', 'woman', 'ideas', 'marriage', 'are', 'muddled', 'absurdly', 'childish', 'views', 'feminism', 'learning', 'curve', 'idea', 'connubial', 'bliss', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'steep', 'painful', 'one.She', 'introduced', 'Clarisse', 'cousin', 'Edmond', 'Andre', 'Dussolier', 'lawyer', 'who', 'engagement', 'party', 'who', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'meeting', ""n't"", 'return', 'calls.She', 'sell', 'vase', 'mother', 'customer', 'all', 'too', 'evident', 'Edmund', 'Sabine', 'behaving', 'predator', 'prey', 'intention', 'being', 'woman', 'targeted', 'catch.Her', 'idea', 'marriage', 'not', 'predicated', 'love', 'even', 'compatibility.Edmond', 'needs', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'taken', 'account.Funny', 'touching', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Le', 'Beau', 'Mariage', 'acutely', 'exact', 'psychologically', 'socially', 'not', 'least', 'way', 'troubled', 'heroine', 'shuttles', 'busy', 'highways', 'Paris', 'ancient', 'cobbled', 'streets', 'Le', 'Mans', 'different', 'settings', 'ironically', 'reflecting', 'paradox', 'paragon', 'women', 'lib', 'see', 'liberation', 'means', 'allowing', 'live', 'Victorian', 'lady', 'leisure', 'see', 'film', 'ending', 'experience', 'was', 'well', 'worthwhile', 'liked', '3', 'main', 'performances', 'Rohmer', 'refusal', 'mock', 'heroine', 'goals', 'leave', 'hope', 'emphasis', 'movement', 'travel', 'conversation', 'colour', 'scheme', 'film', 'lightness', 'touchon', 'serious', 'subjects.Best', 'seen', 'part', 'part', 'series', 'Comedies', 'Proverbs']",N/A
