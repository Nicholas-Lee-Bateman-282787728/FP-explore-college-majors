It takes a combined effort to make something this terrible, to waste the talents of such luminaries as Trevor Howard, Peter Cushing, John Rhys-Davies, and Sean Connery, all in one sitting.  In this regard, they did a bang-up job, sparing no expense (one assumes the expenses, or expectations, weren't too high to begin with).I guess this falls into the category of Sword & Sorcery for genre sake.  It starts with a challenge (some would say threat) from a Green Knight (Sean Connery) that Gawain (Miles O'Keeffe) accepts then quickly segues into another fight with a Black Knight who guards a city to nowhere.  Let's just cut to the chase and say there was a lot of running and fighting and running and more fighting (it was pretty disorganized).  You might even call this a road picture because it certainly wasn't much of a buddy flick (Gawain having lost his sidekick/servant early on in favor of a distressful damsel with one very big ring).  There's also a riddle I forgot instantly, a witch and a hag who stole Maleficent's headpiece, Sean Connery all a splendor in green and sparkles, some warring factions, Peter Cushing as a sage on the sidelines, a red Muppet-like frog, a horny prince (also a toad).  Think of it as a live action Fractured Fairytale and your head won't explode while you're trying to figure it all out.  Did I mention the unicorn?  At least there was a jolly tone throughout and the story fairly zipped along....it didn't make much sense but at least they were quick about it!  I especially liked the rack humor.

The high point of the movie comes early, when the mysterious Green Knight (essayed by Sean Connery)barges into King Arthur's court and offers a bizarre behading challenge to the astonished Knights of the Round Table.  Only the young Gawain (played by Miles O'Keefe) will accept the challenge and strikes off the Green Knight's head.  But to Gawain's amazement the Green Knight picks up his head and puts it back on, and Gawain is honor-bound to offer his own throat to the challenger's axe.  The Green Knight gives Gawain a year to prepare and a riddle to solve, however,and for the rest of the movie we follow Gawain's adventures in love & war as he struggles to interpret the riddle and prepare for the final showdown with the Green Knight.Unfortunately, most of the movie is unremarkable, to say the least.  O'Keefe is an acceptable Gawain and you couldn't ask for a better actor to play the Green Knight than Connery, but the lackluster script and direction, combined with what must have been a sorry budget, doom their efforts and those of everyone else involved in the film.  Sets and costumes are adequate, but the plot is convoluted and rather boring and not at all faithful to the great source poem.  Indeed, much of the plot is apparently inspired by the tale of Gawain's cousin, Yvain, instead. The climax makes little sense and betrays the original tale, while the ending is supposed to be melancholy but just disappoints like so much of the rest of this film.
