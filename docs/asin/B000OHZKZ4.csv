1064174,AMVMGYU0BDLVW,B000OHZKZ4,"Acetaminophen ""Relief""","[6, 9]","This season is, sadly to say, the worst yet.  In a downhill pattern from season to season, Monk has gotten worse and worse.Reasons for believing this:  The character Monk is no longer funny or even that amusing.  Instead, the character gets more and more depressing.  I realize OCD is not ""funny"", but this show was meant to be somewhat comical.Another character who has been getting worse is lieutenant Disher(?).  He's become too moronic to be believable as a cop, let alone a lieutenant.  I realize cops aren't the brightest, but this is pushing the envelope.Thirdly, the fact that Monk (or anybody else on the show) has never found his wife's killer is getting old.  There's no reason to keep this going.  Make a two-episode show out of it.  Do whatever, but just end this.  Monk will still be Monk and maybe this would be a turn in the right direction (i.e. from depressing back to comical, with every now and then, a sad moment in the show).The show Psych seems to be taking Monk's place and the show Monk will soon be weeded out unless something changes in the writing.",2,Downhill,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,1076,"['season', 'sadly', 'say', 'worst', 'yet', 'downhill', 'pattern', 'season', 'season', 'Monk', 'gotten', 'worse', 'worse.Reasons', 'believing', 'character', 'Monk', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'even', 'amusing', 'Instead', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'depressing', 'realize', 'OCD', 'not', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'comical.Another', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'getting', 'worse', 'lieutenant', 'Disher', 'become', 'too', 'moronic', 'be', 'believable', 'cop', 'let', 'alone', 'lieutenant', 'realize', 'cops', 'are', ""n't"", 'brightest', 'pushing', 'envelope.Thirdly', 'fact', 'Monk', 'anybody', 'else', 'show', 'never', 'found', 'wife', 'killer', 'getting', 'old', 'reason', 'keep', 'going', 'Make', 'two-episode', 'show', 'Do', 'whatever', 'just', 'end', 'Monk', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'Monk', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'turn', 'right', 'direction', 'i.e', 'depressing', 'back', 'comical', 'now', 'then', 'sad', 'moment', 'show', 'show', 'Psych', 'be', 'taking', 'Monk', 'place', 'show', 'Monk', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'weeded', 'out', 'something', 'changes', 'writing']",Monk: Season Five

With few more seasons with this kind of quality, will surely drive away all of the Monk fans.Selling price of this product should be something like below $10 with free shipping!!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[119, 124]","Most cult TV dies pretty quickly, but Adrian Monk has been charming viewers with his quirky detecting for five seasons now. The fifth season occasionally crosses the line into cartoonishness, but overall it's still an entertaining, amusing little detective show... with the world's only OCD detective.In the opening episode, a movie is going to be made about Monk's (Tony Shalhoub) life and amazing abilities, with well-known actor David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci) as Monk. But Ruskin turns out to be the world's best method actor, as he observes Monk doing his detective work -- and starts to acquire Monk's OCD and personality. Sometimes acting can be TOO good.But Monk's problems don't cease when he's paralyzed by a garbage strike, and the strike leader is murdered. Other cases include a mysterious electrocution in a gym shower, being blinded by a murderer, a stint as a private eye, a college reunion, a disastrous rock concert, a leper, posing as a butler, a radio host whose wife died while he was on the air, and he competes against technology to find a serial killer.On the personal front, Monk gets reacquainted with his father, who left the family when he was a child, and he also tries to deal with Dr. Kroger's early retirement, by solving the crime that prompted him to leave. And he helps Randy (Jason Gray-Stanford ) out when the latter inherits a farm -- and a mysterious death.The fifth season does sag a little in the middle -- the retirement and rocker episodes have Monk's OCD becoming almost cartoonishly comic. But most of the rest of the episodes are quite good, with the typical unsolvable cases, unbreakable alibis, and inexplicable phobias from poor Monk.Writingwise, there's nothing to complain about -- solid writing, solid plots full of difficult mysteries, and Monk undergoing lots of stress as he tries to deal with his many phobias. The dialogue is top-notch (""There's never hope. I wish I drank. Is it wonderful?""), and the writers allow all the regular characters to shine now and again, including Randy and Stottlemeyer (who have a kind of big-brother/little-brother vibe).Tony Shalhoub is just amazing here, as Monk tries to navigate the dangers of a dirty, random world. He's absolutely hilarious when poor Monk has to square dance, feed chickens, and single-handedly tries to clean up San Francisco. But he also gives us some truly beautiful moments, such as when we see Monk watching his wedding video, quietly crying.Traylor Howard continues to give a solid performance as Monk's assistant, while Ted Levine and Gray-Stanford round off the regular cast as the kindly Stottlemeyer and naive Randy. Alice Cooper has a fun cameo, and Tucci is absolutely great as a Monk-impersonator. And Sean Astin gives a glorious performance as a murderous, spoiled rich brat.The fifth season of ""Monk"" has a few episodes that are lacking, but most of them are still excellent, suspenseful little mysteries. Definitely worth seeing.",4,Monkish galore,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2954,"['Most', 'cult', 'TV', 'dies', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'been', 'charming', 'viewers', 'quirky', 'detecting', 'five', 'seasons', 'now', 'fifth', 'season', 'occasionally', 'line', 'cartoonishness', 'overall', 'still', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'little', 'detective', 'show', 'world', 'only', 'OCD', 'detective.In', 'opening', 'episode', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'life', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'well-known', 'actor', 'David', 'Ruskin', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Monk', 'Ruskin', 'out', 'be', 'world', 'best', 'method', 'actor', 'Monk', 'doing', 'detective', 'work', 'acquire', 'Monk', 'OCD', 'personality', 'Sometimes', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'TOO', 'good.But', 'Monk', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'cease', 'when', 'paralyzed', 'garbage', 'strike', 'strike', 'leader', 'murdered', 'Other', 'cases', 'include', 'mysterious', 'electrocution', 'gym', 'shower', 'being', 'blinded', 'murderer', 'stint', 'private', 'eye', 'college', 'reunion', 'disastrous', 'rock', 'concert', 'leper', 'posing', 'butler', 'radio', 'host', 'wife', 'died', 'was', 'air', 'technology', 'find', 'serial', 'killer.On', 'personal', 'front', 'Monk', 'reacquainted', 'father', 'who', 'left', 'family', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'also', 'deal', 'Dr.', 'Kroger', 'early', 'retirement', 'solving', 'crime', 'prompted', 'leave', 'Randy', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'out', 'when', 'latter', 'farm', 'mysterious', 'death.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'sag', 'little', 'middle', 'retirement', 'rocker', 'episodes', 'have', 'Monk', 'OCD', 'becoming', 'almost', 'cartoonishly', 'comic', 'most', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'typical', 'unsolvable', 'cases', 'unbreakable', 'alibis', 'inexplicable', 'phobias', 'poor', 'Monk.Writingwise', 'nothing', 'complain', 'about', 'solid', 'writing', 'solid', 'plots', 'full', 'difficult', 'mysteries', 'Monk', 'undergoing', 'lots', 'stress', 'deal', 'many', 'phobias', 'dialogue', 'top-notch', 'never', 'hope', 'wish', 'drank', 'wonderful', 'writers', 'allow', 'regular', 'characters', 'shine', 'now', 'again', 'including', 'Randy', 'Stottlemeyer', 'who', 'have', 'kind', 'big-brother/little-brother', 'vibe', '.Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'just', 'amazing', 'here', 'Monk', 'navigate', 'dangers', 'dirty', 'random', 'world', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'when', 'poor', 'Monk', 'square', 'dance', 'feed', 'chickens', 'single-handedly', 'tries', 'clean', 'up', 'San', 'Francisco', 'also', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'see', 'Monk', 'watching', 'wedding', 'video', 'quietly', 'Howard', 'give', 'solid', 'performance', 'Monk', 'assistant', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Gray-Stanford', 'round', 'off', 'regular', 'cast', 'kindly', 'Stottlemeyer', 'naive', 'Randy', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'fun', 'cameo', 'Tucci', 'absolutely', 'great', 'Monk-impersonator', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'glorious', 'performance', 'murderous', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Monk', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'lacking', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'excellent', 'suspenseful', 'little', 'mysteries', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Monk: Season Five

1064195,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000OHZKZ4,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 2]","Recovering from surgery recently,  I found myself watching episode after episode of MONK, a show I had long heard about but had yet to see.  I don't subscribe to cable, but a  friend loaned me Season 5, so that was my first exposure to the series.  I had long been curious about the show ands wondered how a series about a detective with OCD could be handled with any degree of sensitivity at all.  It seemed like you'd have to either have to wantonly play the disability up for cheap laughs OR you'd have to be so PC about OCD that it would appear to be little more than a personality quirk.Well, the real answer was neither, of course.  For the most part,  the writers, directors--and certainly the actors--have pulled off this delicate feat by making the title character so likeable and human--and  so downright brilliant--that you can't help but love and admire the guy.  He's as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes even as he exceeds that  character in terms of sheer neurosis.So MONK would seem to be as original and as entertaining as almost anything else currently  on TV (although, admittedly,  I'm guessing there since I don't really watch very much at all).  What I do garner from reading the other reviews posted here, however, is that  Season 5 may be the season where the show ""jumped the shark"" (or at least  approached the dorsal fin).  And I can guess why that is.  There were a number of intriguing episodes (""Mr. Monk and the Leper"" with its film noir feel;  ""Mr Monk and the Actor"" featured a great turn by Stanley Tucci;  ""Mr. Monk Meets His Dad"" was an interesting change of pace, with  a solid Dan Hedaya guesting as the elder Monk).  Lots of wonderful moments to convince even a neophyte (and somewhat skeptical) viewer like me that this was a witty and stylish series.But I could also see some weaknesses here and there.  ""Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion""  was a series entry that  showed up some of its potential weaknesses.  The episode's premise was certainly intriguing,  and almost any episode that focuses on Monk's devotion to his deceased wife Trudy is going to give Tony Shalhoub a chance to dig a little deeper into his quirky character.  But the story was convoluted to the point of being almost baroque.  To solve it,  Monk had to display abilities that went beyond the keenly insightful and into the nearly psychic.  (And isn't that another show entirely? One whose pilot is included in this package?)  ""Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert"" seemed a somewhat strained attempt at presenting Monk as even more of a fish out of water than usual.  Had the resolution also not been a strain (of credibility),  all this might have been forgivable, but as it was,  the episode had an ""air"" of desperation about it.But by and large, this viewer was won over.  If seasons one through four are actually better than I'd have to say that this series seems to have had a pretty decent run.  I can't wait to start catching up.  As for the future,  well,  I did invite myself over to a friend's house to catch some of the current season's episodes, and yes,  it could well be that that shark has been jumped (and it must have been terrifying for poor Adrian).

I have been a fan of Monk since the beginning. I loved seasons 1& 2. Season 3 was pretty good as well, but not as good as the previous two. Season 4 started to fall off. My wife and I though there were at least 6 or 7 throw away episodes. Also the show got considerably sillier. Season 5 has done it for me. I just tinished the last episode and I am officially over ""Monk"". The writing on this show has gone so downhill it's not even funny. It has become a silly almost farcical satire. It was not this silly in the first two seasons I'm sorry. It had humor, yes but it was fresh and the storylines took center stage and Monk was an interesting Character. Season five consisted of recycled plots, recycled jokes and every character has become more of a caricature. Stottlemeyer and Disher have become especially absurd when they could have been explored more as charaters. Really sad. Monk was a nice gimmick for a while and great writing could have kept it afloat. However this has not been the case whatsoever. The writing has become abysmal.

I think it's her background, and a good bit of personality. Like Monk, she has lost a spouse tragically, which enables her to empathize with him a bit more whenever the subject of Trudy, his deceased wife, comes up. I hope she stays with him for a long time.I was glad to see Ted Levine's character, Captain Stottlemeyer, move on after his wife left him in the previous season.

This season finds Monk facing new issues in the same old way.When the city garbage workers go on strike, it's up to Monk to solve a murder to get everything cleaned up.  His assistant Natalie (Traylor Howard) convinces Monk to strike out on his own and open a private eye business.  Monk's 25 year class reunion at Berkley involves a painful stroll down memory lane and the murder of a nurse.  When Captain Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) son skips school to attend a rock concert, Monk finds a dead man in an outhouse.  And in a ""Wings"" reunion, Steven Weber plays a shock jock that may have killed his wife.  He just has the perfect alibi; he was on the air at the time.This season featured two episodes at aired during the hiatus between parts of the season.  In the first, Monk finally meets his dad, a trucker who needs Monk's help to solve a murder.  The second is very interesting.  ""Mr. Monk and the Leper"" was originally shown in black and white and color.  It's a very noirish tale, and the black and white color scheme really adds to the episode.  Both versions, including their original introductions are included in the set.As always, this season provided many fun character moments and some hilarious situations.  At times, the characters can become cartoonish.  This felt especially true near the beginning of the season.  But the actors do a great job of keeping things believable and human.Since the set has both the black and white and color versions of the one episode, there are 17 episodes in this four disc set.  Extras include an audio commentary (a first for the series) on the black and white version of ""Mr. Monk and the Leper.""  Disc four contains some hilarious ""webisodes"" that premiered on line.  I know I've seen at least one used as a promo on TV, however.  Finally, there's the pilot of ""Psych,"" a similar comedic mystery.Monk isn't for everyone.

Either the humor has become predictable over time, or the timing of the scripts has gone off.  The stories seem to take too much effort at trying to be funny, setting up situations for Monk's quirks instead of letting them happen from the normal flow of the story.  Re-viewing seasons 1 to 4 points towards the season 5 scripts as the problem. And the mysteries are so far fetched that it is useless to play along with the detective work.

So when Monk season 5 was released I immediately set out to purchase it and trust me, you will not be disappointed with this season. Season five comes on 4 disks and 16 episodes, including:Mr. Monk and the Actor:A famous actor plays Monk in a movie about the obsessive compulsive detective. However, the more he spends time with Monk, the more Natalie grows concerned about how the actor's behavior takes a weird turn. He also gets too involved in a murder case Monk is currently trying to solve.Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike:When a union boss' death threatens to prolong a city-wide garbage strike in San Francisco, it's up to Monk to help end the strike by determining whether the boss' death was suicide or murder. It also is very funny to see Monk try to clean up the city by himself.Mr. Monk and the Big Game:Julie and her friends hire Monk to look into the suspicious death of their basketball coach. Monk isnt too sure and soon realizes the case may have one twist even he wouldnt have seen coming.Mr. Monk Cant See and Thing:Mr. Monk looses his eyesight after a bizarre altercation with a murder suspect in a fire station. Determined not to let it disable him, he continues on to solve the case.Mr. Monk, Private Eye:When Natalie convinces Monk to go into business as a private eye, his first case is a small fender bender that leads to a far more dangerous investigation that involves plenty of twists.Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion:Monk attends his college reunion and uncovers a complex murder plot against one of his former classmates. Pretty cool episode in my opinion.Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink:When Dr. Kroger retires after his cleaning lady is killed in his own office, it's up to Monk to solve the case and get Dr. Kroger back to work as soon as possible, or Monk may not make it.Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert:Monk goes to a rock concert to look for Captain Stottlemeyer's son and finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation.Mr. Monk Meets his Dad:One of my favorite episodes in this season. When Monk's truck driving father rolls into town at Christmastime, Monk joins him on the road, where they stumble across a mystery that even Monk may not be able to solve.Mr. Monk and the Leper:A missing millionaire suffering from leprosy comes out of hiding to hire Monk, who soon finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation as well as realizing different stories may have one common, mysterious, factor.Mr. Monk Makes a Friend:An easy going guy named Hal bumps into Monk at a grocery store, and the two become fast friends. For the first time in his life, Monk appears to have a buddy. However Hal may not be all that he appears to be...Mr. Monk is at Your Service:When Natalie suspects foul play in the deaths of her parents' wealthy neighbors, Monk goes undercover as a butler to investigateMr. Monk is on the Air:In one of the better episodes Monk goes toe to toe with a popular radio shock jock who is suspected of killing his wife.Mr. Monk Visits a Farm:When Lt. Disher inherits a farm from an uncle who committed suicide, he decides to quit the police force and start a new life in the country. But Disher soon suspects that his uncle was murdered, so Monk joins him on the farm to investigate.Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy:When a dangerous criminal named the ""Six Way Killer"" strikes in San Francisco, Monk has to match his detective skills against the flashy forensic technology of a federal agent as they both pursue the murderer.Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital:Monk goes to the hospital with a bloody nose, but when a doctor in the hospital turns up dead, Monk joins the murder investigation, and soon his own life is in grave danger.This is definately worth your money. Adrian Monk is awesome to watch and some of the episodes are really very clever and all are completely original.
