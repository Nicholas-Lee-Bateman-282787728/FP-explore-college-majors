332983,A39VT91VD5N5ZZ,6302765269,Doug - Haydn Fan,"[10, 10]","Unlike the relatively recent Splash, which jump-started the career of a young TV star Tom Hanks into the ranks of movie superstardom, Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid goes about the Mermaid story from the opposite side of the romantic spectrum. Furthermore, it does so with more sophistication and a greater sense of discernment into what lies behind the allure of such a mythical creature as a mermaid - (Hint, it's not non-stop coupling atop the refrigerator.) In this early version, the aging Mr. Peabody's sense of youth slipping away forever becomes so strong that he actually comes to believe in his mermaid, when we and everyone else are left to wonder just what it is he thinks he has discovered. Despite a serious illness during the shooting, paralleling the script's opening, Powell carries off this thespian slight-of-hand with practiced aplomb, and by the time the movie ends we realize we, like the mermaid, have also been caught and intriqued.The excellent cast never overdoes the fantasy, and the graceful whimsy carries through without a hitch. Ms. Blyth, who played Joan Crawford's daughter in Mildred Pierce just two years previously, and was nominated for an Academy award as best supporting actress, conveys a totally different female persona here, capturing to a remarkable degree the perfect balance of naiviete and coquetry - if only actresses today might underplay their roles with such quietude and disarming ease.Hopefully this will be released on DVD, along with a restored version of those other two fine films Powell made late in his career, Life With Father, and The Senator Was Indiscreet.",5,William Powell's Touching Portrayal of Age,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,1615,"['relatively', 'recent', 'Splash', 'jump-started', 'career', 'young', 'TV', 'star', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'ranks', 'movie', 'superstardom', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'Mermaid', 'Mermaid', 'story', 'opposite', 'side', 'romantic', 'spectrum', 'Furthermore', 'so', 'more', 'sophistication', 'greater', 'sense', 'discernment', 'what', 'allure', 'such', 'mythical', 'creature', 'mermaid', 'Hint', 'not', 'non-stop', 'coupling', 'refrigerator', 'early', 'version', 'aging', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'sense', 'youth', 'slipping', 'away', 'forever', 'so', 'strong', 'actually', 'believe', 'mermaid', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'discovered', 'serious', 'illness', 'shooting', 'paralleling', 'script', 'opening', 'Powell', 'thespian', 'slight-of-hand', 'practiced', 'aplomb', 'time', 'movie', 'realize', 'mermaid', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'caught', 'intriqued.The', 'excellent', 'cast', 'never', 'fantasy', 'graceful', 'whimsy', 'hitch', 'Ms.', 'Blyth', 'who', 'played', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'daughter', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'conveys', 'totally', 'different', 'female', 'persona', 'here', 'capturing', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'perfect', 'balance', 'naiviete', 'coquetry', 'only', 'actresses', 'today', 'might', 'underplay', 'roles', 'such', 'quietude', 'disarming', 'ease.Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'restored', 'version', 'other', 'two', 'fine', 'films', 'Powell', 'made', 'late', 'career', 'Life', 'Father', 'Senator', 'Was', 'Indiscreet']",N/A

He has put aside his witty, comedic genius to portray a gentle, sensitive and serious man confused and frightened by the advent of old age.And we see a very young Ann Blythe, whose career blossomed, then was cut short when she retired upon marrying to raise a family. She has no dialogue (mermaids cannot talk, although they sing very well), yet she is a master of facial expressions, tender, naive emotions and even cries at the drop of a hat albeit underneath the sea. She is perfect for the part.The film is about their relationship, with a secondary theme about Powell's wife (excellently protrayed by Irene Hervey), who is attracted to a local while on vacation and is experiencing temptations involved in long marriages (and perhaps her own trepidations about leaving middle age behind).Mermaids have fascinated me since reading Hans Christian Andersen. And whimsy honestly portrayed is delightful. This is a gentle, tender and dear movie. There are some good laughs in it, and the outcome is more lifelike than ideal. Did she really exist, or was she a hallucination?

332992,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,6302765269,Michael J. Mazza,"[65, 65]","I had fond memories of seeing ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid"" on TV when I was a kid, and I think I enjoyed the film even more when I recently watched the home video version. A classic black-and-white film, it has a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson and is directed by Irving Pichel. The film stars William Powell as Arthur Peabody, a married man who is experiencing great anxiety over his impending 50th birthday. He and Mrs. Peabody (a wonderful performance by Irene Hervey) take a vacation to St. Hilda's, a Caribbean island under British rule. But the story quickly takes a turn into the fantastic when Mr. P discovers a beautiful mermaid (Ann Blyth).Although the film is certainly appropriate for a family audience, it does have a deliciously ""naughty"" feel; it's full of drinking, extramarital flirting, and smoking (two memorable sight gags involve the last of those vices). But that probably just reflects the times when the film was made.The production values and performances are first rate. Powell has a marvelously sympathetic ""everyman"" quality as Peabody, and Hervey brings a nice mixture of sweetness and fire to her role as the exasperated wife. Blyth nearly steals the film as the enchanting mermaid. She is mischievous and childlike, but with an alluring sexuality bubbling beneath the innocent surface. Her chemistry with Powell is delightful and touching.The film is full of some great visual images; there is some particularly memorable underwater photography.

332995,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302765269,Only-A-Child,"[10, 10]","When you sift through old Hollywood material you are occasionally surprised to see expressionistic style films that were once passed off as realism to audiences that otherwise would have ignored the effort. ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid"" (1948) is a particularly noteworthy example. 1948 was the year of film mermaids as it also featured Glynis Johns in ""Miranda"", a comedy much closer to ""Splash"" (1984) in style and tone. ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid"" is a much darker film, with a mute mermaid (wonderfully played by a perfectly cast Ann Blyth), the manifestation of the protagonist's mid-life crisis fueled imagination.The hope that William Powell's ""Thin Man"" popularity would translate into a box office bonanza led to his unfortunate casting as the title character. Powell's actual performance is fine as is Irving Pichel's acting for the camera direction, but Powell brings way too much baggage with him to effectively sell this complex character. And the problem is exacerbated by a screenplay deviating from the source novel to create a ""Thin Man"" tone for much of the film. Imagine 30 minutes of Nick, Nora, and Asta renting a vacation villa on a Caribbean beach; with the standard light comedy and mildly eccentric supporting cast. Suddenly Nick hears the song of a mermaid and trips out on his personal ""Peter Pan"" exploration of the mysteries of middle age male discontent. While both styles work fine on their own, their lack of unity makes the film far less powerful than it might otherwise have been (insert source novel here).The 5' 2"" Blyth was 19 when this was filmed while Powell was 56 and in poor health, which made him look a bit older and made their scenes together even more surreal. In the source novel: ""Peabody baited and put out his line ... Close to the boat his quarry struggled weakly and succumbed. He pulled it in.... It was incredible but there it was, his catch, from the waist up, was a woman! Her little b.... ts were pointed and rosy tipped. On a small scale, she was maturely voluptuous!"" The little mermaid revives when Peabody brings her back to the villa. She is mute and enjoys kissing him. He names her Lenore (Min in the book) and keeps her in a fish-pool beside his villa. Misunderstandings result when he tries to keep Lenore hidden from his wife. The island police believe that he has murdered someone after he returns Lenore to the sea.The comedy in the source novel came mostly from its satire of the tendency of mid-life crisis men to seek out unspoiled girls half their age (behavioral traits that once had significant genetic and evolutionary advantages) and land them. Some of this satire is in the film but one has to look hard to see it. Unlike the Jones' novel, the film is book-ended by Peabody's visit to his hometown psychiatrist, with his mermaid story told as a flashback story. And the film goes out with Peabody giving Lenore's comb to his wife, signifying that his crisis has passed, he has surrendered and is moving on with his life. The book's ending is less tidy.Oddly, just two years after this expressionistic effort Pichel would direct ""Destination Moon"", perhaps the most extreme example of Hollywood realism. You would be hard pressed to find a director who can boast effective examples of two such contrasting film styles.The underwater scenes were filmed at Weeki Wachee Springs Florida, now a state park. There has been a roadside attraction mermaid show there since the mid-1940's; in which mermaids perform synchronized ballet moves underwater while breathing through air hoses hidden in the scenery (like the film's undersea castle). These are still being held so stop by if you are ever in the area, it is an especially fun attraction if you have seen this film.Then again, what do I know?
