The movie is flawed in small parts, but I don't feel that that makes it any less enjoyable, just marks points that could be improved. Basically, BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD drips atmosphere, and sinks you into its world of shadows and blood. It's actually more of a mystery story than a horror story, and gels both genres together well.

I suppose I just should have gone with my instincts and put BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD back on the shelf. But, I got hooked on the box copy - it looked kinda indie, the quotes were promising, and the art was gruesome enough - I thought it might be a big make-up FX film. Instead it is a low budget movie. The acting is very good and the story gets more and more dramatic and some scenes are really good. It's not a bad movie, but as far as horror movies go I was fairly impressed by BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD and would certainly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in horror movies, though it's probably a bit too violent and morbid for some tastes.",3,"I like the nightlife, baby.",1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,765,"['vampire', 'movie', 'rule', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'OK', 'Hammer', 'Draculas', ""'re"", 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'suppose', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'instincts', 'put', 'BROTHERHOOD', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'back', 'shelf', 'got', 'hooked', 'box', 'copy', 'looked', 'kinda', 'indie', 'quotes', 'were', 'promising', 'art', 'was', 'gruesome', 'enough', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'big', 'make-up', 'FX', 'film', 'Instead', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'movies', 'go', 'was', 'fairly', 'impressed', 'BROTHERHOOD', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'passing', 'interest', 'horror', 'movies', 'probably', 'bit', 'too', 'violent', 'morbid', 'tastes']",Brotherhood Of Blood

Visit the rottentomatoes website if you want to know the truth: this film is a stinker. I laughed out loud when our band of ""heroes"" decides to torture a wimpy, overweight vampire...by pulling out his fangs! So I laughed once. Mostly, this confused, incoherent, low-budget trash elicits yawns and ultimately disgust, when you realize that you've been taken.

The first viewing asks questions that are answered in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here.

1178454,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001D262JM,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 9]","With Sam Raimi's production company Ghost House teaming up with Lion's Gate and releasing a series of what seem to be fairly decent horror films to DVD, expectations were a little bit high for me with Brotherhood of Blood, especially considering a number of good things said about this flick.  Well, sadly, Brotherhood of Blood ends up coming off as a sadly lame vampire flick with its fatal flaw being it's own production values and ultra-hammy acting.  Victoria Pratt (Mutant X, Cleopatra 2525) stars as a captured vampire hunter looking to take out a guy who is well on his way to becoming an uber-vamp.  Or something.  Such things as plot and storyline get lost in the haze, as Brotherhood of Blood ends up being more confusing and non-sensical than anything else.  Genre greats and Devil's Rejects co-stars Ken Foree (who looks like he's dressed up in a pirate outfit) and Sid Haig are here, and both ham it up as much as they can with their ridiculously bad plastic vampire fangs in tow.  Still, there is a little bit to admire with Brotherhood of Blood, as co-writers/directors Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer at least try to inject somekind of life into a tired and worn genre.  All in all, Brotherhood of Blood is worth a look if you're a vampire fanatic, but for everyone else, it proves surprisingly lame.

The cover art reminded me of From Dusk til Dawn and I figured with these horror icons in the film that it couldn't be that bad.I was unfortunately unpleasantly surprised.  This is not shot on film but on Digital Video, that's not always bad if it's done right.The story revolves around a vampire group that is trying to fight very evil forces from the past.  The story slowly comes together throughout the 80 minute running time with lots of flashbacks.  The majority of the main story is told through paintings and dialogue, there is nothing really seen in live action due to the low budget of this production.Pro's:Ok ActingGood Audio (except for when the actors have to talk through overly large incisors, I mean these things are the size of pool chalk that you use for pool sticks)Ok StoryCon's:Poor cameraworkAmateur Special Effects (can't even call them effects really, I mean orange blood?)3 sets total throughout the movieOpen ended endingPicture Quality was obviously not film, fuzzy in some placesThis reminded me of Dark Shadows but slower and less action in it.  People literally just stand around and talk.  There are no bats and the only time we really see a special effect it's towards the end when we see a vampire dissolve in a CGI stoked fire.This is not the worst thing I've ever seen but it's very hard to recommend except for the vampire collectors that just have to have every vampire flick.View at your own risk but my copy is going back to the store where I found it.",2,Brotherhood of Shadows,1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,1607,"['First', 'want', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'was', 'attracted', 'flick', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'were', 'cover', 'art', 'reminded', 'From', 'Dusk', 'til', 'Dawn', 'figured', 'horror', 'icons', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad.I', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'unpleasantly', 'surprised', 'not', 'shot', 'film', 'Digital', 'Video', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'done', 'right.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'vampire', 'group', 'trying', 'fight', 'very', 'evil', 'forces', 'past', 'story', 'slowly', 'together', '80', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'majority', 'main', 'story', 'told', 'paintings', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'really', 'seen', 'live', 'action', 'due', 'low', 'budget', 'production.Pro', 'Ok', 'ActingGood', 'Audio', 'when', 'actors', 'have', 'talk', 'overly', 'large', 'incisors', 'mean', 'things', 'are', 'size', 'pool', 'chalk', 'use', 'pool', 'sticks', 'Ok', 'StoryCon', 'Poor', 'cameraworkAmateur', 'Special', 'Effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'effects', 'really', 'mean', 'orange', 'blood', '3', 'sets', 'total', 'movieOpen', 'ended', 'endingPicture', 'Quality', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'film', 'fuzzy', 'placesThis', 'reminded', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'slower', 'less', 'action', 'People', 'literally', 'just', 'stand', 'around', 'talk', 'are', 'bats', 'only', 'time', 'really', 'see', 'special', 'effect', 'end', 'when', 'see', 'vampire', 'dissolve', 'CGI', 'stoked', 'fire.This', 'not', 'worst', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'hard', 'recommend', 'vampire', 'collectors', 'just', 'have', 'have', 'vampire', 'flick.View', 'own', 'risk', 'copy', 'going', 'back', 'store', 'where', 'found']",Brotherhood Of Blood
