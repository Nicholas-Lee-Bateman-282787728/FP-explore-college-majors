Although there are only 13 episodes plus threee features, it is undeniably the funniest, witttiest and best written sitcom since ""Frasier."" No surprise that the writers were ""Frasier"" alums. The writers' strike killed the show and by the time the strike ended, Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton went on to other shows,Grammer in the sort-lived ""Hank"" and Heaton in another mega hit, ""The Middle."" It is a travesty that this did not have time to blossom. The writing, acting and pacing is crisp and of the highest caliber.

It's made all the more funny because they 'can't stand each other' although you know that deep down, they'd jump at the chance to be together and rekindle what took place years back.The best episode (in my opinion) is A Night Of Possibilities where the staff car pool to work (Fred Ward driving is hillarious) and Chuck wants to dine by himself and see where the night takes him, yet Ryan wants to join him.I really love this new sitcom.

Any fan of Cheers or Frasier (or a workplace sit com like News Radio) will want this. The Chuck Darling character, played by Kelsey Grammer, is no Frasier Crane, but more like a warped mirror version him; there are hints of Sam Malone. Patricia Heaton is excellent in a role where she is not primarily a wife/mom; fans of Everyone Loves Ray or The Middle might want to pick this up.Oddly, the 3rd and final disk has a different menu system, and it seems that the 3 episodes it contains fall elsewhere in the story line.I think that there was a lot of gas in the tank to fuel future story-lines despite the fact the initial I-am-your-father arc had some closure. Given that Mr Grammer went on to the less successful Hank, it is disappointing that this show was canceled. I will watch it again. There are some decent extras on the 3rd DVD, with many of the cast, including Mr Grammer providing remarks in a 'making-of' featurette.",5,Coulda been a contender,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,1281,"['Instantly', 'funny', 'blend', 'characters', 'jelled', 'right', 'away', 'chemistry', 'was', 'great', 'Three', 'episodes', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'heck', 'fire', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'canceled', 'Maybe', 'tailed', 'off', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'midway', 'was', 'IMHO', 'unfortunate', 'cast', 'change', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'show', 'picked', 'up', 'finished', 'strong', 'fan', 'Cheers', 'Frasier', 'workplace', 'sit', 'com', 'News', 'Radio', 'will', 'want', 'Chuck', 'Darling', 'character', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'more', 'warped', 'mirror', 'version', 'are', 'hints', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'excellent', 'role', 'where', 'not', 'primarily', 'wife/mom', 'fans', 'Everyone', 'Loves', 'Ray', 'Middle', 'might', 'want', 'pick', 'up.Oddly', '3rd', 'final', 'disk', 'different', 'menu', 'system', '3', 'episodes', 'fall', 'elsewhere', 'story', 'line.I', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'gas', 'tank', 'fuel', 'future', 'story-lines', 'fact', 'initial', 'I-am-your-father', 'arc', 'had', 'closure', 'Given', 'Mr', 'Grammer', 'went', 'less', 'successful', 'Hank', 'disappointing', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'are', 'decent', 'extras', '3rd', 'DVD', 'many', 'cast', 'including', 'Mr', 'Grammer', 'providing', 'remarks', ""'making-of"", 'featurette']",Back to You - Season 1

It seems all the smart comedy and intelligent shows they cancel, and they keep the stupid ones on instead. Patrica Heaton was much better in this than she was in Everyone Loves Raymond, and Kelcey Grammer was amazing in this. The chemistry between the two was top notch. Fred Willard was also a nice touch to this show for those like myself that remember him in WKRP in Cincinnati, and also as Roberts bible thumping father in law in Everybody loves Raymond it was a touch of Nostalgia, and almost like a reunion of some of the Everybody Loves Raymond cast.This show could have easily went 8-10 seasons. I have no clue why they cancel all  the good shows and keep the stupid ones. They should bring this show back, and cancel one of the many stupid shows they are shoving down our throats. Also I have to mention that Christopher Lloyd co-created and wrote this show he is a dark comedy genius.",5,Best comedy that I can remember in over 3 decades,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,976,"['show', 'was', 'dark', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'canceled', 'smart', 'comedy', 'intelligent', 'shows', 'cancel', 'keep', 'stupid', 'ones', 'instead', 'Patrica', 'Heaton', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'Everyone', 'Loves', 'Raymond', 'Kelcey', 'Grammer', 'was', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'two', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'touch', 'show', 'like', 'remember', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'also', 'Roberts', 'bible', 'thumping', 'father', 'law', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'was', 'touch', 'Nostalgia', 'almost', 'reunion', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'cast.This', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'went', '8-10', 'seasons', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'cancel', 'good', 'shows', 'keep', 'stupid', 'ones', 'should', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'cancel', 'one', 'many', 'stupid', 'shows', 'are', 'shoving', 'down', 'throats', 'Also', 'have', 'mention', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'co-created', 'wrote', 'show', 'dark', 'comedy', 'genius']",Back to You - Season 1
