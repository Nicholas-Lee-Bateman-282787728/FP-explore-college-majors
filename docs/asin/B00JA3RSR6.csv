I like the interaction between the characters, and the problems that they face and solve in each episode.  The characters are well fleshed out, in my opinion, that is a feature you don't see in many animated productions.  There is welcome humor, and an equal amount of seriousness.  All in all, cartoons well worth watching, and definitley worth buying.

1696139,A2WMDDDW6POOR5,B00JA3RSR6,Gemseeker,"[0, 0]","This is for the second half of season 2 (Defenders of Berk, not Riders). While the first half had storylines that were essentially &#34;more of the same&#34;, in the second half we get back to the people. I especially liked the episode where Hiccup rants to his father about how to get his riders to work together-it shows that being a leader is not going to be as easy as the first movie would have us believe. And of the two types of problems in this series-fighting bad guys/wild dragons vs. becoming the leader of his people, Hiccup's real challenge is the latter, by far.For those of you who have read my comments about the picture quality issues of the Defenders, part one dvd set, I just bought the second half of season two-Defenders of Berk on dvd to see if it had the same picture problem as the first. It does-the picture is slightly blurry, most noticable while trying to read the end credits. But this time it occurred to me to try shrinking the picture size-and the smaller I made it, the clearer it got. Just like with a lot of streaming movies-it loses focus/resolution the larger you make the picture. So for now I am watching it at about two-thirds of full-screen size, not perfect but not bad enough to make my eyes cross.What's the contact info for the manufacturer? Or can someone else pass along this message?

They are just as fun as the first movie was with the great stories and fun humor and if you are a big dragon lover like myself, it's a must for any collection :)  I only wish we had cable to watch season 3 as it airs. It will be a long wait for the season 3 dvds :(My only complaint about these sets are that season 1 and season 2 are split into 2 parts each. With only 10 episodes per part, they really should have sold each season as a complete dvd. That's a lot of money to be paying for only a handful of episodes per season part :(",4,A long wait for season 3...,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,674,"['was', 'watching', 'cartoons', '8yr', 'old', 'nephew', 'day', 'got', 'home', 'school', 'were', 'able', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'stories', 'fun', 'humor', 'are', 'big', 'dragon', 'lover', 'must', 'collection', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'cable', 'watch', 'season', '3', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'wait', 'season', '3', 'dvds', 'only', 'complaint', 'sets', 'are', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'are', 'split', '2', 'parts', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'part', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'sold', 'season', 'complete', 'dvd', 'lot', 'money', 'be', 'paying', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'season', 'part']",Dragons: Defenders of Berk - Part 2

Some very adult issues are brought out in these movies/series that I think are excellent and will hopefully help children in their later lives whether they realize it or not.
