966338,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000E1YVZU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 8]","I do not like to be one of those critics that immediately denounces this film because of the popularity surrounding the Broadway hit.  I hope that with this review I do not sound like it, but there were some harsh occurrences that I cannot ""let slide"", while others say they were ""golden"".  There is a very big difference between this film version and that which I saw on stage. Sure, I didn't see the one in New York City (enjoyed the one in London), but there is something unique, absolute, and powerful about seeing a stage version of a musical instead of in the comfort of your own couch.  I don't believe that I am saying this, but I think that you have more originality on stage.  Imagination is your greatest tool, and you can also take certain justices when performing in front of a live audience that you cannot in cinema.  This was a big hurdle to have to cross with the film version of Rent.  Again, I don't want to just compare and contrast the film to play, but there was a level of imagination and originality lost in the cinematic version.  Instead of dreaming of what New York City was like on stage, director Chris Columbus spoon-feeds it to you.  You could literally turn off your mind for this film and still find some slivers of entertainment, but was it the right entertainment?  The music was phenomenal, it was impressive to see the original cast (of which I have listened to their original Broadway CD for years now), and there was some interesting points that Columbus chose to keep, and others that he chose to delete.  You cannot recreate the imagination of the theater with a film.  Shocked to hear myself say that, but it is true.  There is something about smelling the person next to you and ""Mooing"" with the tourist on the other side.  That is was I missed the most about Rent the film.Again (and I apologize), but much like the play I loved the beginning of Rent.  I initially felt that Columbus was going to successfully pull it off.  He was going to bring back the age-old cinema trick of bringing original casts back together to film on a bigger scale.  Opening with our entire cast singing the powerful ""Seasons of Love"" to an open stage, I nearly broke into tears at that moment.  I saw Columbus going in a very creative direction, and I must admit the opening scene pulled me in.  Then, nearly word for word, song for song, he slowly began to befuddle it.  Just like the play, for the first half of the film, I think Columbus (and the cast) did a very convincing job.  The songs provoked intimate memories, the struggle of life coupled with the power of love shined through, and the independence of living in a huge city like NYC in the late 80s was reborn.  The familiar faces of the cast and the crispness of the songs demonstrated how big this Broadway hit was.  Columbus took some creative control, which I did not complain with.  His change on ""Tango: Maureen"" I thought was a prediction of what he was going to do with the other songs, but alas, that creativity stopped there.  Columbus tried hard, but ultimately, after finishing this film, I do not think he was the best director to helm this project.  I didn't want Rent to be as gritty as Angels in America, yet I didn't want it to be as candy-coated as I witnessed it with Columbus.  Character's hair were never tangled or messed up, money again didn't seem to be an issue, and apparently throwing fire into the streets is not a problem in NYC.  I realize that Columbus was attempting to capture the inherit history of the musical with these scenes, but we are living in a Hollywood of realism.  Rent is a real story, I didn't want it to feel like it was ""faked"".  By the end of this film, I had felt that Columbus had ""faked"" me.One aspect of this film that really appealed to me was the return of the original cast.  That was a superb decision made by Columbus (and probably DeNiro) that was successfully able to keep some of the original emotion from the stage version.  Rosario Dawson annoyed me throughout the film, but outside of that I felt the original cast did a fantastic job.  I especially enjoyed Jesse L. Martin's ""Tom Collins"" character.  There was so much emotion, so much passion behind his eyes when he spoke that you could not help but immediately love his character.  One could say the same about Angel.  Anthony Rapp, sadly, seemed angry the entire time about something.  Even as he sang of love, his beady little eyes seemed dark and hollow.  I think he missed the aura of his character.  I, shockingly, also believed that Tracie Thoms did a fantastic job with her character, creating just enough chemistry as well as stern independence to bounce off Idina Menzel (in my opinion stole the show).  Taye Diggs, well, he was Taye Diggs.  Yet, it is due to these key players that I was able to watch this film until the end.  I do not think this film could have been done without these original players back in the roles that rocketed them into the spotlight.I have some friends that have seen the stage version of Rent and listened to the original Broadway cast CD and complain about this film.  It may seem like I am doing the same, but I am not complaining, just feeling a bit disappointed.  My friends claim that this film just doesn't work in today's society because of the growing awareness of AIDS and medicine's ability to combat the drug.  They also whine about the aging actors that were once in their 20s performing this same song and dance routine.  I do not agree with any of these comments at all.  This is a film/play that does not feel dated to me.  It still feels alive due to the suffering in this country surrounding AIDS.  Rent is able to do something that other films seem to continually forget to capture, and that is friendship.  Rent is about friends, no matter how old they are, always being there for you.  It is about having your own independence, while being surrounded by those that accept it.  It is about overcoming hardships with the help of these friends.  It is about living your life as if it were your last.  Rent's themes are relevant today, just as they were ten years ago.Overall, I thought this was a mediocre film release.  There could have been better moments (the ending could have been less Hollywood), yet what countered this was the music, which was phenomenal.  Columbus' idea to bring the original cast back was a bold and creative move in my eyes.  I agree that Rent should have been made into a film, but (while he had his ups and downs) I do not think Columbus was the best decision to helm this project.  I am excited that I watched this film, but I think I would rather see another staged version of Rent before I see the version on film again.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Five hundred twenty-five thousand

966342,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000E1YVZU,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","Inspired by Puccini's ""La Boh&egrave;me,"" the musical movie version of Rent revolves around a group of late Eighties down-and-out young artists living in the part of the Lower East Side known locally as Alphabet Soup (for Avenues A, B, C, and D). It's one of the lowest-rent districts in Manhattan, but they still can't afford their rent.They can't find work in their quirky fields. They face straight and gay love problems and meanwhile (also) the realities of living with AIDS, which afflicts four of the eight key characters. Still, their boundless love and hope carry them through.The stage version of Rent won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Obie Award, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, four Tony Awards and three Drama Desk awards, alas too late for composer Jonathan Larson to appreciate his success: he died of an aortic aneurysm the night before the show's first off-Broadway performance.After 10 years on Broadway, the show has attracted a huge following--many of whom have seen it several times. But you don't need to have seen the original Broadway musical to enjoy this film: There's singing and dancing on the streets, on fire-escapes, on table-tops and in subway cars. It all enchantingly carries the plot along.Director Chris Columbus recast six actors in the roles they played when the stage show opened--Anthony Rapp as filmmaker Mark Cohen, Idina Menzel as performance artist Maureen Johnson, Adam Pascal as songwriter Roger, Jesse L. Martin as computer programmer Tom Collins, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as drag queen drummer Angel and Taye Diggs as the landlord's son-in-law Benny Coffin III. All six perform with amazing panache. The two newcomers--Rosario Dawson as exotic dancer and drug addict Mimi Marquez and Tracie Thoms as an attorney and Maureen's lesbian lover Joanne Jefferson--are equally alluring.The film opens with ""Seasons of Love."" The entire cast sings of the importance of every moment. Then ""Rent"" sets the story flowing. Mark Cohen is off to making films of friends and his neighborhood before running home to find Roger and Tom Collins asking them to throw down the key. Before getting upstairs, Tom is attacked by thugs. Angel, drumming on a plastic can in the street, hears him moaning and comes to his rescue in a nearby alleyway, thus setting off the film's gay love affair.Mimi flirts with Roger in ""Light My Candle"" and although he rejects her with ""Another Day,"" she comes back again in ""Out Tonight."" Tom and Angel go to their AIDS support group, which sings of overcoming their fears in ""Will I?"" Mark commiserates with Joanne in ""The Tango Maureen."" The cast lauds their happy-go-lucky lifestyle in ""La Vie Boheme."" Angel and Tom fall for one another in ""I'll Cover You."" And Roger reclaims a chance with Mimi in ""Your Eyes.""There's a lot of entertainment, and some lessons for life packed into this beauty of a film. See it.--Alyssa A.

Adam Pascal stars as an aspiring songwriter,Roger,who encounters a stripper named Mimi (Rosario Dawson) Anthony Rapp stars as an aspiring filmmaker capturing the drama of life- from Maureen's protest to the support groups for those suffering from AIDS. There are musical highlights along the way,such as the hilarious ""Tango Maureen"",the hedonistic ""La Vie Boheme"" and the joyous ode to the Southwest,""Santa Fe.""

At first, it was kinda rough going after seeing/hearing the title song, but the film really grew on me for what it is. Yeah, I admittedy was thrown off a bit with some of the subject matter which has been discussed to death here, but I was not offended. It strikes me as a testament to the human spirit that this group of social outcasts, scorned by most people bond toggether as friends and as a family against their inevitable ends.Perhaps it's just as well that I didn't see the original play and did not have it to compare with the film. I love this movie, although I wouldn't take the kiddies to it.Now that the DVD is finally out and I snapped it up right away, some additional commentary is necessary. The deleted scenes are quite interesting, as is often the case with a movie that you like. The alternate ending is triumphant, if a tad cornball and it's just as well, considering Angel's character, that they didn't use it (I won't spoil it, see and you'll understand). But it's still interesting as a bonus feature. The documentary about Jonathan Larson is very revealing, if a tad overlong (the behind the scenes stuff about the film would have worked better as a seperate feature) and overall, the entire package holds together well (including some of the original stage cast memebers who did not return for the movie.

966350,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000E1YVZU,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[5, 9]","This was really hard to get through. Around the 48 minute point, the urge to turn off the movie became evident and did not leave throughout the whole movie. Rent is set at the East Village of New York City in the late 1980's. The film, adapted from the Broadway show of the same title, follows a group of bohemian artists through their journey of trying to produce the art that they love, yet still be able to have enough money to pay the rent of their respective Penthouses. Apparently, 90% of people that live in New York City have AIDS, or so that is what you are led to believe by this film. Rent tries to grab the bull by the horns and produce a film that touches upon the issues that city dwellers are plagued with. Here are some reasons why it fails to do so.""Rent"" the film, tries way too hard to replicate ""Rent"" the play, and fails miserably. Many of the original cast members of the stage return to act their roles in the film. The result is a slew of lackluster performances. These actors who are not used to the cameras so close because of the separation they have from the audience on stage seem unemotional and undetermined to make their roles believable. Or maybe it's because when they are on stage they are more diligent on the acting side, but with the audience replaced by a camera, maybe their heart isn't in the role as much as it usually is when they are amongst the people in the crowd. For whichever reason it is, the acting didn't deliver nearly as effectively as it does when seen live on stage.The musical numbers were sang well and conducted correctly, but yet again the lackluster demeanor of the cast makes the music mediocre at best. When you see the Broadway performance of Rent, the personalities of the actors seem a lot more real. With the separation between you and your TV screen, you realize that the songs are not even as great as you thought they were. The magic of seeing a Broadway show is the relationship that you feel with the actors. There is a certain chemistry that lives in the electricity that the actors emit while on stage. On the big screen, the audience is extremely emotionally detached from the cast, which is very quick to disappoint.I really think the movie could of worked if it hadn't of focused so much on trying to be the play. Director Chris Columbus tries way to hard to keep the spirit of the stage show, yet produces a sloppy production with a ton of continuity. People appear at scenes to participate in musical numbers, then reappear in the next scene, but at a different setting. The corniness of the film becomes evident when everyone in the streets start singing along with the main actors. Ok...it's a musical...we get it.In no way does this film represent the stage production of Rent. In fact, the stage production is one of the best and most popular since classics as Cats and Ms. Saigon. The film feels like a parody of the play. It is quite disheartening that this movie was made because now the reputation of Rent will always be linked with this movie. I can not ethically recommend this film, but I can recommend sticking with the play. In fact, I highly recommend the play. As for the movie? Don't waste your money.

966351,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000E1YVZU,Andy Orrock,"[8, 8]","The reviewer who has it dead-on right in these pages is the one who calls out the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived 'Rent' as more opera (using 'La Boheme' as inspiration), not a musical.  And what that means is the the connecting dialogue is sung in stage-voice, not chatted as dialogue.  So, to see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak dialogue like ""I rewired the ATM at the Food Emporium"" when you know it's killing him not to sing it and it's equally killing every Rent fan to hear him constrained to simply mouthing the words...well, it's a major flaw because it deals major blows to the flow and energy of Larson's work.Other concerns:* The first-half of the play is re-staged pretty much shot-by-shot. Then, bizarrely (given the fidelity in the first half), the second half veers wildly from the original.  Director Columbus wastes too much time staging ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a way not intended.  Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 - 10 minutes he tacks on here could have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact.* The deleted scenes aren't trvial matters - 'Rent' is a hard story to follow for the unitiated.  Each one of those scenes could have helped explain the the storyline.* Surely one of the reasons to prop up ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was to get more Idina Menzel in there.  [Menzel (the original Elephaba in ""Wicked"" and the original Maureen here) has ascended to Broadway royalty, so who can blame Columbus?]  But, if so, why leave out 'Happy New Year?' which features a goodly amount of Maureen?* The deleted scenes end up de-emphasizing Anthony Rapp's Mark, which is unfortunate because he's the voice and connective thread in the play.  Leaving out his '3D IMAX of my mind...that's poetic...that's pathetic' number is a major ommission, both to Rapp as an actor and to anyone trying to follow the movie - this is the key piece that puts things into perspective for the viewer time-wise.  Why else would Larson strain to put lines in Rapp's monologue like ""Christmas...Christmas Eve last year""  He's framing the scenes for us.This would be a three-star review, but I'll go for four because of the redeeming nature of the nice documentary about the Larson family - this is very powerful stuff.

The manner in which the storyline was performed, however, was a bit much. People should be able to know what they are getting themselves into when they purchase a movie ticket.

It's a great substitute for the live show if you can't see it on stage and a wonderful souvenir for fans who want to relive the experience without having to shell over $50 and up for a seat. I will definitely buy the DVD when it releases. There were two things that that made this film magical for me. The first thing is the 3-dimensional, real world stage that RENT is filmed on. The stage show is basically one set but the movie has a real loft, a real performance space. They even made a Catscratch Club! It was so cool to see songs like ""Out Tonight"", ""Tango Maureen"", & ""One Song Glory"" expanded into these lavish production numbers. And even with all the various enviroments it still retains the essence of the stage show.The second bonus was the fact that most of the film cast was comprised of the original stage cast. To see Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Jesse L. Martin, etc. reprise their roles was a blessing since I missed them on stage. I was worried about Rosario Dawson as Mimi but she did a great job (thank God) and the new Joanne was awesome too. I don't understand all the talk about the actors looking ""aged"". Who did the critics want to see? Hilary Duff?! The cast looked pretty vibrant and energetic to me. The actors' ages were the last thing on my mind when watching this film. I was too busy following the story and being awed by the musical performances to worry about who had the most crow's feet. I am just so grateful that I now have the faces to match the voices on the original cast recording of the RENT soundtrack. Yes!A few criticisms like the sometimes wooden performances where the actor looks like he/she is focusing way too much on the lip synching and less on the emotional presentation. Like during the fight scene/song between Roger throws Mimi out of his apartment. I wish Adam looked as angry as his voice. Or maybe his hair was covering his anger? Luckily this incident happens rarely in the film. And as a huge fan of the soundtrack it was a little odd when some of the lines sung in the show or spoken in the film. Like when Collins visits Mark & Roger and offers them Stoli. It was supposed to be sung not spoken. It didn't hurt the movie very much but as a fan it took getting used to. Overall, this film was worth the wait and I'm glad that it's finally here and I'm ecstatic that it was done so well.

Their voices lacked that youthful spunk.  To equate AIDS, homosexuality, and drug addiction with Bohemian life is nonsense.

966360,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000E1YVZU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 13]","Musicals (and Operas) aren't my forte - although I did enjoy CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE - so I was hesitant to check out RENT. But after reading about its notable comparisons to La Boheme, and how consumption was replaced by HIV/AIDS, I was intrigued enough to pick up a copy and find out what director Chris Columbus (what an unfortunate name) did with it.I guess I should've stuck with my original movie-musical/opera instincts.RENT is exactly what it claims to be, a musical; and perhaps a bit too much of one. At every opportunity - whether it seems justifiable or not - the cast breaks out into song. I know, I know. It's a musical. What did I expect?Maybe I've been spoiled by the two aforementioned postmodern musicals. CHICAGO AND MOULIN ROUGE told stories through both good narratives and great songs. And they didn't force-feed the audience musical number after musical number after musical number. Let me explain further ...RENT is a modern parable about bohemians living in New York's East Village. They're either all struggling artists, lovers, or victims of the HIV epidemic ...or, sometimes, they're all three (depending on which character you choose to follow). They all live in a substandard building and are having trouble paying the rent (begin opening chorus here). Anthony Rapp stars as Mark Cohen, a failed movie-maker who's coming to terms with the loss of his overtly sexy - and apparently bisexual - girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel). He's also been filming all of his friends lives and it is this that gives most of the movie its emotional weight. Adam Pascal plays Roger, Mark's roommate. Roger is dealing with his HIV status by remaining a shut-in after having lost a girlfriend to AIDS. But then Mimi (Rosario Dawson) moves in downstairs and Roger is tempted to fall in love again. But his HIV status and his broken heart keep them apart ...in addition to the fact that Mimi is a drug addict and is HIV positive, too. Jesse L. Martin plays Tom Collins (ha-ha), an out of work MIT instructor who returns to the Village to find his friends self-destructing and, amazingly, to find love in the arms of another HIV positive man, Angel (played by an excellent Wilson Jermaine Heredia).It is Angel - I think - that is supposed to represent the glue that holds these ragtag bohemians together, but we see so little of him (up until the hospital scenes where he's dying) that this aspect was nearly lost on me.There are some decent film moments. Some of the more memorable ones (for me) were during the opening when the power to the building they're all living in is shut off and everyone burns something to stay warm, then throws the burning embers out the windows of this multi-story structure (nice imagery). I also liked the scenes involving the HIV support group that showed its members gradually disappearing, a reminder to viewers that HIV tends to be fatal to a huge percentage of those that become infected.But the songs just couldn't hold the movie together. Most of them had the exact same tempo (with the exception of maybe one or two) and blurred or blended together, making me not really care what they were singing about. And with a musical so packed full of songs, that's pretty bad.",2,"Same Tempo, Same Old Song",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3218,"['Musicals', 'Operas', 'are', ""n't"", 'forte', 'did', 'enjoy', 'CHICAGO', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'so', 'was', 'hesitant', 'check', 'out', 'RENT', 'reading', 'notable', 'comparisons', 'La', 'Boheme', 'how', 'consumption', 'was', 'replaced', 'HIV/AIDS', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'what', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'did', 'it.I', 'guess', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'original', 'movie-musical/opera', 'instincts.RENT', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'musical', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'opportunity', 'justifiable', 'not', 'cast', 'out', 'song', 'know', 'know', 'musical', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'postmodern', 'musicals', 'CHICAGO', 'AND', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'told', 'stories', 'good', 'narratives', 'great', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'force-feed', 'audience', 'musical', 'number', 'musical', 'number', 'musical', 'number', 'Let', 'explain', 'further', 'RENT', 'modern', 'parable', 'bohemians', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'East', 'Village', ""'re"", 'struggling', 'artists', 'lovers', 'victims', 'HIV', 'epidemic', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'three', 'depending', 'character', 'choose', 'follow', 'live', 'substandard', 'building', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'paying', 'rent', 'begin', 'opening', 'chorus', 'here', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Mark', 'Cohen', 'failed', 'movie-maker', 'who', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'overtly', 'sexy', 'apparently', 'bisexual', 'girlfriend', 'Maureen', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'also', 'been', 'filming', 'friends', 'lives', 'most', 'movie', 'emotional', 'weight', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'Roger', 'Mark', 'roommate', 'Roger', 'dealing', 'HIV', 'status', 'remaining', 'shut-in', 'having', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'AIDS', 'then', 'Mimi', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'downstairs', 'Roger', 'tempted', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'HIV', 'status', 'broken', 'heart', 'keep', 'apart', 'addition', 'fact', 'Mimi', 'drug', 'addict', 'HIV', 'positive', 'too', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Tom', 'Collins', 'ha-ha', 'out', 'work', 'MIT', 'instructor', 'who', 'Village', 'find', 'friends', 'self-destructing', 'amazingly', 'find', 'love', 'arms', 'HIV', 'positive', 'man', 'Angel', 'played', 'excellent', 'Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', '.It', 'Angel', 'think', 'supposed', 'represent', 'glue', 'ragtag', 'together', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'where', 'dying', 'aspect', 'was', 'nearly', 'lost', 'me.There', 'are', 'decent', 'film', 'moments', 'more', 'memorable', 'ones', 'were', 'opening', 'when', 'power', 'building', ""'re"", 'living', 'shut', 'off', 'everyone', 'burns', 'something', 'stay', 'warm', 'then', 'burning', 'embers', 'out', 'windows', 'multi-story', 'structure', 'nice', 'imagery', 'also', 'liked', 'scenes', 'involving', 'HIV', 'support', 'group', 'showed', 'members', 'gradually', 'disappearing', 'reminder', 'viewers', 'HIV', 'be', 'fatal', 'huge', 'percentage', 'become', 'infected.But', 'songs', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'Most', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'tempo', 'exception', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'blurred', 'blended', 'together', 'making', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'were', 'singing', 'about', 'musical', 'so', 'packed', 'full', 'songs', 'pretty', 'bad']",N/A

966367,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000E1YVZU,calvinnme,"[3, 5]","I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so ""out there"" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of ""I'll Cover You"", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie.

966368,A18Z33BM3GZE9R,B000E1YVZU,"Carl Cannella ""alec_of_kerry419""","[12, 13]","Rent will forever be a legend of musical theatre. Jonathan Larson's intimate and incredibly personal musical went on to win rave reviews, phenominal success, several Tony Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Larson never got to see the success of his baby, however, as he died of an undiagnosed aeortic aneurism the night of the final dress rehearsal. Would Rent have earned the success it did had the tragedy of Larson's death not thrust the musical into the headlines? Would Larson have approved of the move from a small Off-Broadway theatre to a full-blown Broadway production? What would Larson have done had he been granted a lengthy career? We can never know, but he has left a legacy that even the most wide-eyed dreamer couldn't imagine.This film has been sputtering around Hollywood for nearly a decade, with directors from Spike Lee to Joel Schumacher attached to direct at various times. Thankfully, Mirimax couldn't agree on how to approach the project, which catapulted no less than four directors from behind the camera, leaving room for the vastly underappreciated Chris Columbus to make his first truly great film. His vision for Rent was one that embraces the show's theatrical roots as opposed to masking them, as in 2002's Chicago. He utilizes no tricks to bring the musical numbers inside the characters' heads, and yet his film manages to be the best movie musical in decades, and yes, that is including the aforementioned razzle dazzle Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle.The story itself is rather insignificant. It follows the basic outline of Puccini's classic opera, La Boheme, updated to include drug abuse, AIDS, homosexuality, drag queens, and most importantly rock music. We follow the lives of a group of eight bohemians living in New York City as they celebrate love and life over the course of a year. They encounter new friends, old enemies, and yes, even death, and yet the film never preaches is message of ""No day but today.""One of this film's greatest strengths is its cast. With six of the original eight principle actors from the Broadway production, there is a sense of family that is integral to the believability of the drug- and disease-filled story. Of those six, Anthony Rapp as film-maker Mark and Jesse L. Martin as teacher Collins fare the best. Rapp instills Mark with an over-the-top energy that embues his character with a genuinely likable quality, while Martin is so charmingly joyful one can't help but adore the character.Both newbies give extraordinarily strong performances, particularly Rosario Dawson as the drug-addicted, AIDS-inflicted stripper Mimi. For a character that is often played frustratingly large, Dawson brings to Mimi a sweet vulnerability that serves both story and character. It is unfortunate that the actor who shares the most scenes with Dawson, Adam Pascal, appears so uncomfortable with the medium that Roger, ""the bittersweet, evocative"" songwriter, is both wooden and unrelatable. It's a shame, really, as the Mimi/Roger relationship is at the center of the story. Tracie Thoms, the other newcomer, is easily the best singer in the cast.The true heart of the film, however, lies in the character of Angel, a lovable drag queen who is also inflicted with AIDS. As played by Wilson Jermaine Heredia, the character is immediately likably familiar. While Heredia plays the character just a tad too flamboyant and stereotypical, that is what Larson wrote for the character. Angel is the reason this story works. He is at once recognizable as a real person, and while he is not actually based on any one person, audiences can see a bit of him in everyone.The cinematography is absolutely stunning. It compliments both the somber and lively musical numbers without making the film feel glossy. ""Tango: Maureen"" in particular is a fantastic scene, ironically enough being the only scene to take place in a fantasy. The dance itself is electric and powerful, and a perfect introduction to the flighty character Maureen, played by Tony-winner Idina Menzel. Also rousing is ""La Vie Boheme,"" the most celebratory song in the film. There is more energy present in this one scene than appeared in the entire runtime of last year's Phantom of the Opera.As for the Extras, the DVD is both sparse and rewarding all at once. The commentary with Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal, the sole feature on the first disk, offers little insight into the making of the film, but is interesting enough to warrent a listen. Weirdly enough, though, the language on the commentary is censored with bleeps, something I have never seen before. Disk two is fairly sparse as well, but it contains a 2 hour-long documentary that follows Rent from Jonathan Larson's childhhod straight through to the film. This is one of the best making-of documentaries ever offered as a DVD extra, and it was clearly made with love and respect for the man that brought Rent into being. I found myself weeping when Larson's death was finally mentioned, over an hour into the doc. One would have to have a heart made out of stone not to be moved by Larson's story. Also noteworthy on the second disk are several deleted scenes and musical numbers. The dialgue sequences were clearly deleted for a reason, as they neither advance nor improve the story, but the two songs, ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye, Love"" add much depth and emotion to the final act of the film. These songs are a wonderful addition to the DVD, but Columbus was right in cutting them, much to the disappointment of ""RentHeads"" everywhere.",5,No Day But Today,1140307200,"02 19,

966370,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000E1YVZU,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","Many reviewers have identified various weaknesses in the film version of Rent.  These include overacting and lack of character development among the 8 primary characters. There are multiple plot lines that are more superficial than genuinely presented and fully developed as three dimensional characters rather than stereotypes.And yet the translation from stage to screen was visually successful since stage-like settings were retained so that the film retained a feeling of a stage production. However, when the cameras come in close, the acting needs to be refined and toned down, which did not occur here. In fact, the boisterous overacting, over singing, could almost overpower a viewer since the cameras were too close to the actors, making them frighteningly loud and over-done.  This may seem like an odd comparison but The Sound of Music, when translated from stage to screen, toned down intimate numbers and conversations so as to try to capture some sense of realism (in a highly unrealistic optimistic overly sweet film).  The Sound of Music retained a sense of intimacy in many of the musical numbers, whereas Rent blasts you with every number, despite the emotional content. The overstatement that worked on the stage worked against the film with the exception of a sexy song, Light My Candle, which the characters Mimi and Roger played appropriately to the medium and the message.Beside the translation from stage to screen, the film also had the problem of trying to reflect a point in the AIDS epidemic where the first medicines were appearing, for example AZT, but the efficacy of the medicines were limited. This period of time, 1988, was just prior to the protease inhibitor miracle of 1991-1995 when so many deaths were avoided and the life span of infected persons dramatically increased. Thus the film reflects a point in historic time in an epidemic that rapidly changed. Why should this detract?  After all, La Boheime is about a prostitute dying of tuberculosis. Distance makes the difference. We are not really able yet to understand and reflect upon the various stages of the AIDS epidemic and how various stages may have impacted person's perceptions of life and death, fatality and hedonism. This would mean that with time the film and stage production would actually improve so that future viewers were be able to say ""so that is what it was like on AZT in 1988.""",3,I suspect it may get better with time,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2394,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'identified', 'various', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'version', 'Rent', 'include', 'overacting', 'lack', 'character', 'development', '8', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'multiple', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'more', 'superficial', 'genuinely', 'presented', 'fully', 'developed', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'rather', 'stereotypes.And', 'yet', 'translation', 'stage', 'screen', 'was', 'visually', 'successful', 'stage-like', 'settings', 'were', 'retained', 'so', 'film', 'retained', 'feeling', 'stage', 'production', 'However', 'when', 'cameras', 'come', 'close', 'acting', 'needs', 'be', 'refined', 'toned', 'down', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'here', 'fact', 'boisterous', 'overacting', 'singing', 'could', 'almost', 'overpower', 'viewer', 'cameras', 'were', 'too', 'close', 'actors', 'making', 'frighteningly', 'loud', 'over-done', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'comparison', 'Sound', 'Music', 'when', 'translated', 'stage', 'screen', 'toned', 'down', 'intimate', 'numbers', 'conversations', 'so', 'try', 'capture', 'sense', 'realism', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'optimistic', 'overly', 'sweet', 'film', 'Sound', 'Music', 'retained', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'many', 'musical', 'numbers', 'whereas', 'Rent', 'blasts', 'number', 'emotional', 'content', 'overstatement', 'worked', 'stage', 'worked', 'film', 'exception', 'sexy', 'song', 'Light', 'My', 'Candle', 'characters', 'Mimi', 'Roger', 'played', 'appropriately', 'medium', 'message.Beside', 'translation', 'stage', 'screen', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'trying', 'reflect', 'point', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'where', 'first', 'medicines', 'were', 'appearing', 'example', 'AZT', 'efficacy', 'medicines', 'were', 'limited', 'period', 'time', '1988', 'was', 'just', 'prior', 'protease', 'inhibitor', 'miracle', '1991-1995', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'deaths', 'were', 'avoided', 'life', 'span', 'infected', 'persons', 'dramatically', 'increased', 'Thus', 'film', 'point', 'historic', 'time', 'epidemic', 'rapidly', 'changed', 'Why', 'should', 'detract', 'La', 'Boheime', 'prostitute', 'dying', 'tuberculosis', 'Distance', 'difference', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'able', 'yet', 'understand', 'reflect', 'various', 'stages', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'how', 'various', 'stages', 'may', 'have', 'impacted', 'person', 'perceptions', 'life', 'death', 'fatality', 'hedonism', 'would', 'mean', 'time', 'film', 'stage', 'production', 'would', 'actually', 'improve', 'future', 'viewers', 'were', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'AZT', '1988']",N/A

966372,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000E1YVZU,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","Rent is loosely based on Puccini's opera,Puccini - La Boh&egrave;me / Freni, Pavarotti, Harwood, Ghiaurov, Karajan. In the opera's opening scene, the artists, musicians, and bohemians are torching their scripts, novels, and sheet music for heat because they are poor, desperate, and freezing. Ditto for the denizens of Rent. Update to Manhattan's Lower East Side, pre 9/11, pre gentrification, post AIDS; slight change to drug addict, stripper, musician, film maker, drag queen, performance artist, lesbian lawyer, gay philosophy professor, and yuppie developer, and voila! Rent: a film of a Broadway musical that took Broadway by storm in 1996.Aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's RENT to Benny Coffin III (Taye Diggs), a former friend, now a yuppie developer with dreams of gentrifying. He had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter, but now is pressuring them to stop a protest of evicting the homeless from a nearby property. Exotic dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson), inexplicably has the hots for Roger, even though he never seems to actually finish writing a song. Mark's former girlfriend, performance diva Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia).Directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)) who felt that though the Broadway version was 10 years old, a lot of the original cast could still carry their roles. All but two of the film's cast are from the original Broadway cast. Some of the songs are removed to make way for more dialogue, but the songs are still integrated into the movie in a clever way. The Broadway version was sung throughout, like a Rock Opera. In the film they sometimes break into song suddenly, with no warning, as in the scene where Maureen, the performance artist, and Joanne, her new girlfriend, have a commitment ceremony. It highlights her flamboyant personality, and the trouble that Joanne is having dealing with her flirtatiousness. The shock is also palpable on their respective parents, who seem OK with it, but are really pushed to their limits (I like to picture Lynne & Dick Cheney as Maureen's parents).But mostly the songs develop very naturally, and almost evolve from spoken to sung as the emotions heighten, as in the seductive ""Light My Candle"" sung by Mimi to Roger, or they grow out of actual performances in the context of the action, as in ""Out Tonight"" which begins with Mimi's dance routine. One of the best lines is from ""Candle"" where Roger says she looks familiar, and then Mimi says she is a dancer at the Cat Scratch Club. ""I didn't recognize you without the handcuffs,"" he sings.The musical was written by Jonathan Larson. Tragically, he died just before his show could be staged, of an aortic aneurysm. In some bonus footage he is shown proclaiming that he wants to write the ""Hair of the `90s."" He also received some support and encouragement from Steven Sondheim. Though RENT is noWest Side Story (Full Screen Edition), it shows a lot more innovation thanMoulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition), in its attempt to revitalize the Musical form. That movie took familiar songs and recast them as plot stepping stones. RENT can at least claim that original music and lyrics were written specifically for it.For me, it was interesting to speculate how the film's cast and the people that Jonathan Larson was writing about were related. If their characters were gay, were the actors portraying them also gay? I wondered if Larson pictured himself as Roger, or perhaps more of Mark, the film maker? (Wouldn't it have been great to have Andy Dick in this role, Anthony Rapp's fine performance notwithstanding?) Maybe he most closely identified with Angel? An interesting bit of trivia was that Larson supported himself as a waiter at the Moondance Caf&eacute;, and later, Jesse L. Martin also worked there as a waiter, even being trained under Larson. His character, the philosophy professor Tom Collins, was very gay, and I wondered about him. He has played Dr. Greg Butters, love interest forAlly Mcbeal: The Complete DVD Collection [Region 2 Import], and also plays Detective Green on the long running police procedural,Law & Order - The Fourteenth Season (2003-04 Season). I once saw him along with S. Epatha Merkerson, also of L&O;, as she picked up an Emmy. Seeing him that night, with Merkerson, and two other seemingly gay men in her entourage, it really seemed like he was. An internet search could not confirm this, except at one point it said he was never married (was married to his career), didn't have a girlfriend--but then one gossip item showed him out on the town with Cynthia Nixon, of Sex & the City.Also dating someone from Sex & the City is Rosario Dawson. She was electric in RENT, and I saw that she had quite a varied career, from independent films to blockbusters to bombs. She is from the Lower East Side, and a mix of African American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Native American, and Irish. She was discovered sitting on a porch and asked if she wanted to be in a movie. That movie wasKids, directed by Larry Clark. Since then she has been inClerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition), Sin City 2,Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition),  andJosie and the Pussycats (PG-13 Version). She has also worked with Prince and Jay-Z, as well as been romantically linked with various and sundry people. Hard to keep up with them all. Even someone from Dawson's Creek, now wouldn't that be apropos?Taye Diggs, along with Jesse L. Martin, was also a love interest on Ally McBeal. He was linked to Ling Woo (Lucy Liu), and he was also not only a cultural reference, but also played Will Truman's love interest on a few episodes of Will & Grace. Jack makes numerous references to Taye Diggs, as in a birthday wish of someone for a hot air baloon ride over Taye Diggs' house, and he is also a prominent feature of the gay assistant's character's fantasies on Ugly Betty. His character in RENT is neither gay, nor particularly appealing as he is kind of the villain--a once idealistic friend who is now a cynical yuppie developer. It is just interesting how he has become such a cultural icon.

The singing is great, some of the vocal arrangements are great, and it's because of those great performances that I give this movie 3 stars.But aside from that, I don't think I like musicals.  I checked my watch 3 or 4 times during the film.  To me, musicals are a bit silly.  I mean, SINGING IN THE RAIN is a musical.  The songs are great songs and they're central to the show.  In RENT, the songs were just dialogue sung to a tune.  I'm watching the movie, there's narrative and action going on and then BAM! they burst into song.  It seems a bit silly to me.  The production should have made up its mind whether it was a movie or a musical.  I know it was a movie OF a musical, but for me, I wasn't buying it.However, the performances were excellent.  Angel and Mimi were my favorite characters.  Although the show was conceived 20 years ago when we were constantly inundated with news about AIDS, today it seems ironic that the movie feels dated simply because AIDS is no longer a news item in spite of the fact that more people than ever have the virus.  But that's not RENT's fault.In the very beginning of the movie, you go through 5 credits before RENT appears on the screen.  Articles in the LA Times say this mess is why it took so long for the musical to make it to the screen.  I'm glad it made it; like it or not, RENT is a part of American pop culture landscape, even if it does feel a bit dated.Go see it.  It's 2 hours 15 minutes out of your life.  Or should I say 135 minutes out of the total 525,600 minutes this year?",3,I don't think I like musicals.,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,1591,"['performances', 'movie', 'RENT', 'are', 'excellent', 'singing', 'great', 'vocal', 'arrangements', 'are', 'great', 'great', 'performances', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars.But', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'musicals', 'checked', 'watch', '3', '4', 'times', 'film', 'musicals', 'are', 'bit', 'silly', 'mean', 'SINGING', 'IN', 'THE', 'RAIN', 'musical', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'songs', ""'re"", 'central', 'show', 'RENT', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'dialogue', 'sung', 'tune', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'narrative', 'action', 'going', 'then', 'BAM', 'burst', 'song', 'bit', 'silly', 'production', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'was', 'movie', 'musical', 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'musical', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'it.However', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'Angel', 'Mimi', 'were', 'favorite', 'characters', 'show', 'was', 'conceived', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'constantly', 'inundated', 'news', 'AIDS', 'today', 'ironic', 'movie', 'feels', 'dated', 'simply', 'AIDS', 'no', 'longer', 'news', 'item', 'spite', 'fact', 'more', 'people', 'ever', 'have', 'virus', 'not', 'RENT', 'fault.In', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'go', '5', 'credits', 'RENT', 'screen', 'Articles', 'LA', 'Times', 'say', 'mess', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'musical', 'make', 'screen', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'not', 'RENT', 'part', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'landscape', 'even', 'feel', 'bit', 'dated.Go', 'see', '2', 'hours', '15', 'minutes', 'life', 'should', 'say', '135', 'minutes', 'total', '525,600', 'minutes', 'year']",N/A
966374,AA6AJD8VKAMIC,B000E1YVZU,Charles H. Martin,"[0, 0]","I'll preface my review by saying that I am only passingly familiar with the play Rent. Before watching the movie, I had been turned onto seeing it after listening to the music from the Broadway show, but I have never seen the play actually performed. As such, I can't really comment on how this film stacks up to the play, only how it stands on its own as a film.What strikes me about Rent early on is the very good acting by all of the cast. For most of this, I can chalk it up to experience with the characters; most of the original cast of the play makes it into the movie and thus they have 10 plus years of working with their parts. However, even the new additions are very well acted. The characters of Rent live a carefree Bohemian lifestyle, but there is still an incredible sadness within them. Most of the cast has AIDS and is doomed to die in a very painful manner. Those who do not have AIDS live with the knowledge that they will have to watch as their friends die. For most of the film, those emotions go unstated, but they are clearly in the background for every character.A solid example of this sadness on the inside comes through during the song ""Another Time,"" when Mimi flirts with Roger and he pushes her away because of his fear of opening up to someone as he dies of the virus. In a very angry song, he breaks down for a moment and begins saying softly, ""I should tell you, I should tell you..."" only to explode in anger again. The performance is very subtle, but Roger's pain remains evident in his voice even as he keeps it hidden. The characters are as real as fictional constructs can be; they do not simply feel happy or sad or angry. They carry around a mix of emotions, and the actors portray those mixed emotions as they try to have a good time in what are potentially their final days.The music of Rent is obviously one of the highlights of the film. Although many songs have been cut out from the play, probably due to the time constraints on a film, the important ones are still there and they still sound terrific. If anything, the cast has improved in their musical talent over the years, and the wide variety of quirky and beautiful songs written by the late Jonathan Larson are all performed to perfection. The music remains important to the plot, advancing the storylines and highlighting all the key moments of the film.Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS. The performances are sharp and the music is terrific. This is a film that will move you from happiness to anger to sadness and back again, covering everything in between along the way.",5,Don't Rent - Buy this DVD,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,2694,"[""'ll"", 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'only', 'passingly', 'familiar', 'play', 'Rent', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'seeing', 'listening', 'music', 'Broadway', 'show', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'actually', 'performed', 'such', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'comment', 'how', 'film', 'up', 'play', 'only', 'how', 'own', 'film.What', 'Rent', 'early', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'most', 'can', 'chalk', 'up', 'experience', 'characters', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'play', 'movie', 'thus', 'have', '10', 'years', 'working', 'parts', 'However', 'even', 'new', 'additions', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'characters', 'Rent', 'live', 'carefree', 'Bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'still', 'incredible', 'sadness', 'Most', 'cast', 'AIDS', 'doomed', 'die', 'very', 'painful', 'manner', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'AIDS', 'live', 'knowledge', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'friends', 'die', 'most', 'film', 'emotions', 'go', 'unstated', 'are', 'clearly', 'background', 'character.A', 'solid', 'example', 'sadness', 'inside', 'song', 'Time', 'when', 'Mimi', 'Roger', 'away', 'fear', 'opening', 'up', 'someone', 'virus', 'very', 'angry', 'song', 'down', 'moment', 'saying', 'softly', 'should', 'tell', 'should', 'tell', 'only', 'explode', 'anger', 'again', 'performance', 'very', 'subtle', 'Roger', 'pain', 'evident', 'voice', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'fictional', 'constructs', 'can', 'be', 'do', 'not', 'simply', 'feel', 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'carry', 'mix', 'emotions', 'actors', 'portray', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'try', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'what', 'are', 'potentially', 'final', 'days.The', 'music', 'Rent', 'obviously', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'many', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'play', 'probably', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'film', 'important', 'ones', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'sound', 'terrific', 'anything', 'cast', 'improved', 'musical', 'talent', 'years', 'wide', 'variety', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'written', 'late', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'are', 'performed', 'perfection', 'music', 'important', 'plot', 'advancing', 'storylines', 'highlighting', 'key', 'moments', 'film.Rent', 'movie', 'emotions', 'person', 'would', 'realistically', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'facing', 'something', 'powerful', 'deadly', 'AIDS', 'performances', 'are', 'sharp', 'music', 'terrific', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'happiness', 'anger', 'sadness', 'back', 'again', 'covering', 'everything', 'way']",N/A
966375,AH5Z0XEQHQL0W,B000E1YVZU,"Chris Bundoc ""filmmaniac""","[1, 2]","Rent is a blast! The whole movie is probably 90% all song, and when there is dialogue, it is only to set up the next scene or musical number. The songs, by the way, are not that bad. They're mostly sung dialogue which works, because there's something about singing out words that make the dialogue come to life and feel more personal.Acting wise, everyone played their parts well and it's no surprise that everyone would be doing a great job as these actors were the same performers that did the play back in the early 90's. So of course, with frequent performances, the actors know these charcters inside and out. The only newcomers were Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, who both do an excellent job of blending in with the original cast and not to mention vocal talents as well.Musical highlights have to be ""Out Tonight"", ""I'll Cover You"", ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"", ""Take Me or Leave Me"", ""I Should Tell You"" not to mention ""La Vie Boheme"" and ""Finale B"".The film is about 2 hours and 13 minutes long and for someone who might not be into musicals, this might be a tough film to sit through because by the 1 hour and 15 minute mark, you will be exhausted with how many musical numbers were already performed and how many more there is to go! But for someone who is used to song and dance, this shouldn't be a problem. The charcters and situations are easy to understand and engaging that it won't bore fans.Watching Rent, I truly believe that this is one rock opera of a movie that somewhat felt epic in terms of its noumerous amount of musical numbers, the one year time span of the film and of how the scenes were shot. Again lots of wide sweeping shots that just make the movie that much bigger and ""epic"" like.Anyways, go check it out and see if it works for you!",4,A Powerful Musical Experience!,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1772,"['Rent', 'blast', 'whole', 'movie', 'probably', '90', '%', 'song', 'when', 'dialogue', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'scene', 'musical', 'number', 'songs', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'bad', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'sung', 'dialogue', 'something', 'singing', 'out', 'words', 'make', 'dialogue', 'come', 'life', 'feel', 'more', 'personal.Acting', 'wise', 'everyone', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'actors', 'were', 'same', 'performers', 'did', 'play', 'back', 'early', '90', 'So', 'course', 'frequent', 'performances', 'actors', 'know', 'charcters', 'inside', 'out', 'only', 'newcomers', 'were', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'who', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'blending', 'original', 'cast', 'not', 'mention', 'vocal', 'talents', 'well.Musical', 'highlights', 'have', 'be', 'Out', 'Tonight', ""'ll"", 'Cover', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'Reprise', 'Take', 'Me', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Should', 'Tell', 'not', 'mention', 'La', 'Vie', 'Boheme', 'Finale', 'B', '.The', 'film', '2', 'hours', '13', 'minutes', 'long', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'musicals', 'might', 'be', 'tough', 'film', 'sit', '1', 'hour', '15', 'minute', 'mark', 'will', 'be', 'exhausted', 'how', 'many', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'already', 'performed', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'go', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'song', 'dance', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'charcters', 'situations', 'are', 'easy', 'understand', 'engaging', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'fans.Watching', 'Rent', 'truly', 'believe', 'one', 'rock', 'opera', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'felt', 'epic', 'terms', 'noumerous', 'amount', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'year', 'time', 'span', 'film', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Again', 'lots', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'bigger', 'epic', 'like.Anyways', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'see']",N/A

The personality. The depth of the characters.The movie jumped from song to song and there was no character building. The jist of RENT is to show the year in the life of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City struggling with life, love and AIDS, and the impacts they have on America. Yet, I couldn't help thinking that we really and truly didn't get to know these people. And... IMPACT on AMERICA?? I haven't the slightest clue.Is it the filmmakers fault? Not sure. Probably not. I just think that there is SO MUCH MATERIAL HERE that gets portrayed in a stage play that was absolutely impossible to portray in a 2 hour movie.The music is phenominal. The spirit of the film is there. The film opens up with the cast singing the wonderful song SEASON OF LOVE, and to me, from that point on, it became a hyperactive jump from one plot point to the next and never slowed down to actually let you know these people.Adam Pascal plays Roger Davis, a former rocker, that is scarred because a former love of his life killed herself with drugs, which we see in brief flashbacks. Rosario Dawson plays Mimi Marquez who sings one of the coolest songs in the movie OUT TONIGHT. She, apparently has a problem with drugs too, but I never got the gist of that until they found her on the street dieing. Apparently, they all have AIDS, but I didn't understand that Roger and Mimi did until they went to the meeting, which they had been avoiding.Wilson Jermaine Heredia plays a convincing drag queen named Angel Dumott Schunard. His funeral, which is supposed to be a big emotional moment of the movie, went right over my head. The reason? There was just too much ground to cover, too many stories to tell, too many characters to get to know, that we didn't get to know ANY OF THEM.I could go on about the things in this movie, but it's just that everything was too vague and unexplored. Later in the movie, Roger decides he's leaving to go to Sante Fe. Apparently, a big deal. Everyone is sad and depressed because of this... they show about a 5 minute MTV clip of him walking through a desert singing and he's back home and everybody is SO EXCITED!The movie wasn't bad for me because the music was bad, the music was awesome... in fact, just buy the CD... the movie was bad for me because all of the emotional impact things, the moments that will make you understand the characters and understand the troubles that they are going through are so VAGUE and UNEXPLORED, I had little to no interest in the film at all.",2,LACKED PERSONALITY,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,2669,"['someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'musical', 'performed', 'live', 'watched', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'something', 'something', 'VERY', 'IMPORTANT', 'was', 'missing', 'personality', 'depth', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'jumped', 'song', 'song', 'was', 'character', 'building', 'jist', 'RENT', 'show', 'year', 'life', 'Bohemians', 'East', 'Village', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'struggling', 'life', 'love', 'AIDS', 'impacts', 'have', 'America', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'really', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'people', 'IMPACT', 'AMERICA', 'have', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'clue.Is', 'filmmakers', 'fault', 'Not', 'sure', 'Probably', 'not', 'just', 'think', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'MATERIAL', 'HERE', 'portrayed', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'absolutely', 'impossible', 'portray', '2', 'hour', 'movie.The', 'music', 'phenominal', 'spirit', 'film', 'there', 'film', 'up', 'cast', 'singing', 'wonderful', 'song', 'SEASON', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'point', 'became', 'hyperactive', 'jump', 'one', 'plot', 'point', 'next', 'never', 'slowed', 'down', 'actually', 'let', 'know', 'people.Adam', 'Pascal', 'plays', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'former', 'rocker', 'scarred', 'former', 'love', 'life', 'killed', 'drugs', 'see', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Mimi', 'Marquez', 'who', 'one', 'coolest', 'songs', 'movie', 'OUT', 'TONIGHT', 'apparently', 'problem', 'drugs', 'too', 'never', 'got', 'gist', 'found', 'street', 'dieing', 'Apparently', 'have', 'AIDS', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Roger', 'Mimi', 'did', 'went', 'meeting', 'had', 'been', 'avoiding.Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', 'convincing', 'drag', 'queen', 'named', 'Angel', 'Dumott', 'Schunard', 'funeral', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'emotional', 'moment', 'movie', 'went', 'right', 'head', 'reason', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'cover', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'tell', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'ANY', 'OF', 'THEM.I', 'could', 'go', 'things', 'movie', 'just', 'everything', 'was', 'too', 'vague', 'unexplored', 'Later', 'movie', 'Roger', 'leaving', 'go', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'Apparently', 'big', 'deal', 'Everyone', 'sad', 'depressed', 'show', '5', 'minute', 'MTV', 'clip', 'walking', 'desert', 'singing', 'back', 'home', 'everybody', 'SO', 'EXCITED', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'music', 'was', 'bad', 'music', 'was', 'awesome', 'fact', 'just', 'buy', 'CD', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'emotional', 'impact', 'things', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'understand', 'characters', 'understand', 'troubles', 'are', 'going', 'are', 'so', 'VAGUE', 'UNEXPLORED', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'film']",N/A

If you did not see the stageshow, don't bother watching this version as you will most probably hate it. But if you did see the show, you will in all probability be disappointed with the movie (but you won't necessarily hate it). It was decided that the characters would speak more dialogue than in the stage version.I would have gone for wall to wall music and truly kept it a rock OPERA, because it just doesnt work anymore for a character to speak and then suddenly start singing. Not in this setup where they tried to be as ""real"" as possible. Even though they are a bit too old for their parts, I accepted the original cast members and respect them for originating the amazingly successful Broadway show. I just felt NO emotion while watching the movie, I was detached and watching the timer on my DVDplayer to see how many minutes were left. Completely the opposite of my experience in the theatre (I saw it in 1998). I know some devoted fans LOVE the film and I am glad they do - as we need to see more musicals on film. But after this movie I am sure the studios will think thrice before attempting another stage to screen movie musical. RENT was a gamble that did not pay off. And I am very sorry about it, as I WANTED it to work.There is a very insightful documentary on disc 2 (about the tragic story of Jonathan Larson, the creator of RENT) as well as some deleted scenes and even an alternative ending.

I loathed most of the Golden Age Hollywood musicals that my parents loved, and those from my youth, the 1960s and 1970s (Hair, Jesus Christ, Superstar, Godspell, etc.), did not move me, either- at least dramatically, even if the songs were great. There's something about people breaking out into song that is just so forced that, dramatically, is too much to overcome. Perhaps the only film musical that totally worked for me was Evita, and that's because it was one long music video, from beginning to end, with literally only one sentence of spoken dialogue. However, musicals have been making a comeback in film. Moulin Rouge led the way, a few years back, and it's a truly great musical, if not a film. Chicago won an Academy Award for Best Picture the following year, even though it's not half the film, nor musical, Moulin Rouge is. Then, came the Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely, and, well, Cole Porter, Cole Porter. It was a very good film that incorporated music wonderfully and intriguingly into its plot, the life's tale of the legendary composer. Next came Rent, the film version of Jonathan Larson's late 1980s musical that dominated Broadway last decade, which updated Puccini's opera, La Boh&eacute;me for the AIDS era. Surprisingly, while only also a great composer of ballads and rip roaring rock tunes. Without doubt, Rent has as many great songs as Hair or Godspell ever did- perhaps more.Yes, the actual story the tale tells is slight and often silly, if I'm being generous....Yes, the characters are stereotypes and caricatures, there is no real development of their psyches, and the film ends in shameless melodrama- the abandoned and now homeless Mimi's death and resurrection, and preachiness- in its regard of the anomic, dead transvestite Angel as somehow the apex of the human experience. But, as I always asked people who harped about the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla, `What did you really expect from a film where a giant lizard stomps on New York; Brando in Streetcar?' Similarly, what can one reasonably expect from a work that glorifies AIDS suffering in such a Romantic light, as well the inanities and irresponsibilities of young drug addicts and sexual freak shows who somehow believe that the world owes them something merely for their breathing, and that having to actually pay rent to someone to live somewhere is a form of fascism? If you answered, `Well, maybe, good music,' you are absolutely right, and, fortunately, Rent has much of that to spare. Ultimately, the music, and Larson's brilliance in the crafting of his infectiously catchy tunes, is the film's saving grace. And, when has even a little bit of grace ever been a bad thing?",3,Better than expected,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,2738,"['Let', 'state', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'musicals', 'loathed', 'most', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'parents', 'loved', 'youth', '1960s', '1970s', 'Hair', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Godspell', 'etc', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'either-', 'least', 'dramatically', 'even', 'songs', 'were', 'great', 'something', 'people', 'breaking', 'out', 'song', 'just', 'so', 'forced', 'dramatically', 'too', 'much', 'overcome', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'film', 'musical', 'totally', 'worked', 'was', 'Evita', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'music', 'video', 'beginning', 'end', 'literally', 'only', 'one', 'sentence', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'However', 'musicals', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'comeback', 'film', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'led', 'way', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'truly', 'great', 'musical', 'not', 'film', 'Chicago', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'following', 'year', 'even', 'not', 'film', 'musical', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Then', 'came', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'biopic', 'De-Lovely', 'well', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'incorporated', 'music', 'wonderfully', 'intriguingly', 'plot', 'life', 'tale', 'legendary', 'composer', 'Next', 'came', 'Rent', 'film', 'version', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'late', '1980s', 'musical', 'dominated', 'Broadway', 'last', 'decade', 'updated', 'Puccini', 'opera', 'La', 'Boh', 'eacute', 'AIDS', 'era', 'Surprisingly', 'only', 'also', 'great', 'composer', 'ballads', 'rip', 'roaring', 'rock', 'tunes', 'doubt', 'Rent', 'as', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'Hair', 'Godspell', 'ever', 'did-', 'perhaps', 'more.Yes', 'actual', 'story', 'tale', 'tells', 'slight', 'often', 'silly', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', '.Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'caricatures', 'real', 'development', 'psyches', 'film', 'shameless', 'melodrama-', 'abandoned', 'now', 'homeless', 'Mimi', 'death', 'resurrection', 'preachiness-', 'regard', 'anomic', 'dead', 'transvestite', 'Angel', 'somehow', 'apex', 'human', 'experience', 'always', 'asked', 'people', 'who', 'harped', '1998', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Godzilla', 'What', 'did', 'really', 'expect', 'film', 'where', 'giant', 'lizard', 'stomps', 'New', 'York', 'Brando', 'Streetcar', 'Similarly', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'work', 'AIDS', 'suffering', 'such', 'Romantic', 'light', 'well', 'inanities', 'irresponsibilities', 'young', 'drug', 'addicts', 'sexual', 'freak', 'shows', 'who', 'somehow', 'believe', 'world', 'something', 'merely', 'breathing', 'having', 'actually', 'pay', 'rent', 'someone', 'live', 'somewhere', 'form', 'fascism', 'answered', 'Well', 'maybe', 'good', 'music', 'are', 'absolutely', 'right', 'fortunately', 'Rent', 'much', 'spare', 'Ultimately', 'music', 'Larson', 'brilliance', 'crafting', 'infectiously', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'when', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'grace', 'ever', 'been', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

I listened to it constantly, and still do.  I followed the journey of Rent from stage to screen with a mixed bag of emotions.  They got most of the original cast (GREAT!) Shooting on location in New York (Great!)  Chris Columbus, the same guy who directed Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone is directing this movie (Uh-Oh.)  But still there was some hope.  He did a decent enough job with the first two Harry Potter movies because he made it an extremely faithful adaptation.  Maybe he'd do the same here.  Then a PG-13 rating.  The soundtrack included some rather strong language and some songs with risque content which in this ultra conservative day, would have guaranteed it an ""R.""Still I was cautiously optimistic that the movie would follow in the footsteps of other cinematic rock operas like ""Tommy"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""No such luck.For some reason they decided to set the first part of the movie in 1989, even though they refence several elements from the 90's, like ""Thelma & Louise"" for example.Then much of the songs has been switched to straight dialogue interrupted at times by a musical number.  Often this dialogue would bring the movie to a screeching halt, only to come alive again when the singing started.I have no complaints about any of the actors.  I thought they were all great, even if some were different from the original.My problem is that I wanted more singing.  I wanted Chris Columbus to be as faithful to the stage production of Rent as he was to the books of Harry Potter.  I would have been satisfied if he had just pointed a camera at the stage and let it run during a performance, just to keep all of the songs intact.Instead we have a movie that feels like it plays down the fact that it's a musical, that altered the subject matter to get a more family friendly rating, that, let's face it, sold out to the corporate interests that it pretended to criticize.",3,It could have been so much more,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,1981,"['bought', '2', 'cd', 'soundtrack', 'Rent', 'back', ""'90s"", 'wore', 'out', 'disks', 'listened', 'constantly', 'still', 'do', 'followed', 'journey', 'Rent', 'stage', 'screen', 'mixed', 'bag', 'emotions', 'got', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'GREAT', 'Shooting', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'Great', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Home', 'Alone', 'directing', 'movie', 'Uh-Oh', 'still', 'was', 'hope', 'did', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'first', 'two', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'made', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'do', 'same', 'here', 'Then', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'soundtrack', 'included', 'rather', 'strong', 'language', 'songs', 'risque', 'content', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'guaranteed', 'R.', 'Still', 'was', 'cautiously', 'optimistic', 'movie', 'would', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'other', 'cinematic', 'rock', 'operas', 'Tommy', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'such', 'reason', 'decided', 'set', 'first', 'part', 'movie', '1989', 'even', 'refence', 'several', 'elements', '90', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'example.Then', 'much', 'songs', 'been', 'switched', 'straight', 'dialogue', 'interrupted', 'times', 'musical', 'number', 'Often', 'dialogue', 'would', 'bring', 'movie', 'screeching', 'halt', 'only', 'come', 'alive', 'again', 'when', 'singing', 'started.I', 'have', 'complaints', 'actors', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'even', 'were', 'different', 'original.My', 'problem', 'wanted', 'more', 'singing', 'wanted', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'be', 'as', 'faithful', 'stage', 'production', 'Rent', 'was', 'books', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'had', 'just', 'pointed', 'camera', 'stage', 'let', 'run', 'performance', 'just', 'keep', 'songs', 'intact.Instead', 'have', 'movie', 'down', 'fact', 'musical', 'altered', 'subject', 'matter', 'get', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'rating', 'let', 'face', 'sold', 'out', 'corporate', 'interests', 'pretended', 'criticize']",N/A
966382,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B000E1YVZU,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[10, 19]","RENT the film works for exactly four minutes.  The opening credits role and then the cast sings 521,600 Minutes and its all downhill from there.  What follows a nice opening is a film so pointless, so banal, you'll asks as my wife did for the two and half hours back you spent watching RENT.I remember when RENT opened on Broadway.  I remember I had a buddy who camped out on the street to see the play.  I remember people called RENTheads would record the shows in other cities and trade bad audio and video of the off Broadway productions starring Molly Ringwald and Doogie Howser. It was a phenomenon based on the tragic death of it's creator Jonathon Larson more than a well made show, and so the play stayed untouched, unfiddled around with, for who would dare touch the Genius of Larson?  Who would dare walk on his grave?If I were the director of this movie I would have begged for a rewrite.  If ever there was a film dying for some heart, some central core, its RENT.  It's jumbled, it's messy, it contains characters that don't mesh, there's no coherence, no one worth rooting for, no one worth hating, and that's wrong. The passion and drive of the clunky play may work as live theater, heck CATS works as live theater, but RENT is charmless, pointless, and murky and it really shouldn't be.RENT follows the exploits ""in the year of the life"" of Mark (Anthony Rapp) the angst ridden film maker, Roger (Adam Pascal) the Rockstar with AIDS, Mimi (Rosario Dawson) the heroin addicted Stripper with a heart of gold (and AIDS), Tom (Jesse L. Martin) the unemployed professor with AIDS, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) the Drag Queen (with AIDS)  who steals Tom's heart, Maureen (Idina Menzel) the performance artist and Mark's Ex-Girlfriend, and Joanne (Tracie Thomas) the Lawyer who falls in love with Maureen.  They are the bohemians, they can't pay the rent, they can't pay the heat, and everyday they stand the chance of being evicted.  So they sing.  They sing a lot, and at one point at a protest, they Moo.  That causes a near riot.  I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater.  But I had a feeling they were watching a different movie cause they kept clapping.Why was this film so joyless?  Why were the main characters so whiney?  Why does RENT have no real heart?  The film just assumes that we the audience will like these people and so it makes no attempt to allow them to win our hearts.  It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends.  But half the film revolves around how these people don't get along. They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine.  They hate progress, they protest the idea of personal responsibility, and fight the man, for what? Nothing but a crappy apartment in New York City.The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops.  The homeless women look at him and screams something like ""don't exploit me, get a job.""  These people are not happy, the lifestyle they promote is pointless and the film fails to take a stand on any of it.The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level.  The dialogue clunks haphazardly into the songs.  The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater.  But you'll have 521,600 minutes attacking you in your dreams.  If the screenplay would have been retooled to fit the screen instead of the screen trying to replicate the stage a better movie would have emerged.  But RENT will appeal only to those who love the play.The other glaring problem is the actors seem too old to embody these parts.  With actors culled from the original off-Broadway cast, it casts and even deeper gloom over the film.  We all have to grow up, this group of 30-somethings edge on pathetic.  A new cast of twenty-somethings would have worked a bit better.So save your money.

Though at some times during the film you do wish they would slow down the music a little and try to have a little bit more normal dialouge ... the music is still really wonderful and throughout the film you are more than a bit entertained.I'm also sure that some of you may have heard that some of the people from the original cast played their parts in the new movie, this was overall pretty good just because all of the original performers are absolutly brilliant!, the only thing that bothers me is that in the film all of the people are supposed to be in their early twenties .... I'm sure you would agree that some of them look like they are only the verge of turning 40 or so (or at least 35...), one really suprizing thing was that they got Rosario Dawson to play a part, though I was skeptical of this choice I was overall pretty pleased with her performance not only in the acting portion but the singing as well, she is the real deal as an actress.I thought that at a few parts of ""RENT"" that things got just a nidge jumbed mostly because the very little amount of actual dialouge (besides the singing!) .... but the singing alone makes this a great film that I would recommend to most people, except for maybe conservetive people or people that dont like musicals, do keep in mind it in some parts is a little bit riscay but it's not like ...

But that was about it. I sure was in for a surprise when I played this DVD.Rent takes a one year look into New York's East Village bohemians. These carefree artists face constant struggles during the late 1980s. The story's focus is on these two main characters; Mark (Anthony Rapp) an aspiring filmmaker that will just about anything that is not main stream and his roommate is Roger (Adam Pascal) an aspiring songwriter. Shuffle in the many friends who are intertwined in the story of love, sex, drugs, art and friendship.This DVD musical must be played with a Home Theatre System with Dolby Digital surround sound. The songs come alive with visual art portrayed by the actors/singers. The content hits the heart of its viewer. The dialog is crisp, clear and to the point when sung.The surprise for me is that I actually will add this DVD to my collection because of the songs. But now I actually know the story behind the music. I will always have Mimi (Rosario Dawson) in my mind during the ""Out Tonight"" performance at the Catscratch Club.

966389,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000E1YVZU,Dorrie Wheeler,"[6, 8]","Rent Two Disc Special Edition DVD ReviewThe Rent Two Disc Special Edition DVD is one of the greatest musical feature film DVD releases ever. Contributing to the DVD's greatness  is a substance filled second disc of bonus features.  If you missed Rent the movie during it's short theatrical run, you must pick up the DVD.  If you saw the movie and enjoyed it, you will definitely be pleased with the two-disc DVD release.Disc one features the movie Rent.  The movie Rent is the big screen adaptation of the award winning Broadway musical. The film is fantastic but failed to become a box office blockbuster and when award nominations came around Rent was all but forgotten.  Personally, I feel this is because the world didn't know the story of Rent as well as they may have known the back story of previous stage musicals adapted for the big screen such as Chicago and Annie.Rent is the story of a group of Bohemian friends living in New York City.  They are dealing with various issues of life, career, and relationships.  Several of the friends are suffering from the AIDS virus. They are all different but have a common bond.  The story is about a year in the life of these very unique friends.The big screen version of Rent was unique in the sense that instead of using A list Hollywood actors for the film the cast was largely comprised of actors who performed during the stage plays Broadway run.  Rosario Dawson, who stars in the film as Mimi, a beautiful heroin addict, is the most well known Hollywood actor in the cast.  Rounding out the cast are Taye Diggs, his real life wife Indina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, Jessie L. Martin, Tracie Thoms, Adam Pascal and Wilson Jermaine Heredia.Okay, first things first, Rent is a musical.  The film opens up with the musical performance and the performances keep coming.  There is very little actual spoken dialogue in the film. The cinematography is electrifying as the color seems to jump off of the screen.  There are several scenes that you will remember forever after watching them. Memorable scenes include the opening performance, ""Seasons of Love,"" the dance performance ""Tango Maureen,"" and Rosario Dawson's seductive performances ""Light The Candle"" and ""Out Tonight.""  All of the performances are awesome and Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel in drag lights up the screen.With a story telling soundtrack, it's very easy to follow the story despite the lack of dialogue.  It's a great movie with a message of persistence, struggle, understanding and friendship.The bonus features are included on the second disc.  There are several music performances that were deleted from the movie featured on the second disc.  The second disc also includes a feature length documentary titled ""No Day But Today.""  In the documentary friends, family members and people who worked with Jonathon Larson detail his passion for music and the theater and the strides he made to see that his work was seen by the world.  For those who do not know, Jonathan Larson died of an aortic aneurysm the last night of dress rehearsals for the stage play version of Rent.Other bonus features include PSA's for theater foundations, including a foundation founded by Jonathan Larson's family.Overall, Rent the two disc special edition is a satisfying DVD film experience.  The two-disc special edition is available in both widescreen and full screen versions.",5,Very pleased with this DVD,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3380,"['Rent', 'Two', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'ReviewThe', 'Rent', 'Two', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'one', 'greatest', 'musical', 'feature', 'film', 'DVD', 'ever', 'Contributing', 'DVD', 'greatness', 'substance', 'filled', 'second', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'missed', 'Rent', 'movie', 'short', 'theatrical', 'run', 'must', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'saw', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'pleased', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'release.Disc', 'one', 'movie', 'Rent', 'movie', 'Rent', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'award', 'winning', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'film', 'fantastic', 'failed', 'become', 'box', 'office', 'blockbuster', 'when', 'award', 'nominations', 'came', 'Rent', 'was', 'forgotten', 'Personally', 'feel', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Rent', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'known', 'back', 'story', 'previous', 'stage', 'musicals', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'such', 'Chicago', 'Annie.Rent', 'story', 'group', 'Bohemian', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'dealing', 'various', 'issues', 'life', 'career', 'relationships', 'Several', 'friends', 'are', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'are', 'different', 'have', 'common', 'bond', 'story', 'year', 'life', 'very', 'unique', 'friends.The', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'Rent', 'was', 'unique', 'sense', 'instead', 'using', 'A', 'list', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'film', 'cast', 'was', 'largely', 'comprised', 'actors', 'who', 'performed', 'stage', 'Broadway', 'run', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'who', 'film', 'Mimi', 'beautiful', 'heroin', 'addict', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'cast', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Indina', 'Menzel', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Jessie', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia.Okay', 'first', 'things', 'first', 'Rent', 'musical', 'film', 'up', 'musical', 'performance', 'performances', 'keep', 'coming', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'film', 'cinematography', 'electrifying', 'color', 'jump', 'screen', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'will', 'remember', 'forever', 'watching', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'include', 'opening', 'performance', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'dance', 'performance', 'Tango', 'Maureen', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'seductive', 'performances', 'Light', 'Candle', 'Out', 'Tonight', 'performances', 'are', 'awesome', 'Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', 'Angel', 'drag', 'lights', 'up', 'screen.With', 'story', 'telling', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'story', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'great', 'movie', 'message', 'persistence', 'struggle', 'understanding', 'friendship.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'several', 'music', 'performances', 'were', 'deleted', 'movie', 'featured', 'second', 'disc', 'second', 'disc', 'also', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Day', 'Today', 'documentary', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Jonathon', 'Larson', 'detail', 'passion', 'music', 'theater', 'strides', 'made', 'see', 'work', 'was', 'seen', 'world', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'died', 'aortic', 'aneurysm', 'last', 'night', 'dress', 'rehearsals', 'stage', 'play', 'version', 'Rent.Other', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'PSA', 'theater', 'foundations', 'including', 'foundation', 'founded', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'family.Overall', 'Rent', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'satisfying', 'DVD', 'film', 'experience', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'available', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'versions']",N/A

966392,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000E1YVZU,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 8]","Suffice it to say that the movie version of ""Rent"", nine years after it exploded on Broadway, delivers the goods in late 2005. That in itself is no small feat since its then-topicality brings the story a somewhat tainted 1990's time capsule feel. Credit needs to go to director Chris Columbus, who has the audacity to bring back six of the eight original cast members and does surprisingly little to alter the story structure for the screen. The late Jonathan Larson's energetic, hook-heavy music is what made the show so memorable to me when I saw it during its first year in New York, and the now-familiar score still maintains its searing drive as it flows through the episodic story of almost starving artists living in the squalor of Manhattan's Alphabet City in 1989 with the AIDS epidemic running rampant (currently the neighborhood is going through significant urban renewal). In fact, four of the eight main characters are HIV-positive, and this makes the story resonate as much as the vital music does today.Having the cast return to roles they originated nearly a decade earlier when they epitomized twenties angst is a risky move as the characters would seem to be less compelling inhabited by actors now in their mid-thirties. As it turns out, age is not the issue versus the ability of the actors to generate the excitement they did onstage. Their contributions at minimum are solid and effervescent with some standing out, for example, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, the geeky documentary filmmaker who records the lives of his friends with candor and regret. Jesse L. Martin - he of the dazzling smile and honey-coated baritone - seems genuinely liberated from years of button-down civility on ""Law and Order"" to play computer programmer Tom Collins smitten with drag queen Angel portrayed with unbridled pride and poignancy by Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Martin's and Heredia's giddy duet, ""I'll Cover You"", is full of such romantic fervor that other more traditional couplings can only aspire to such dizzying heights.Idina Menzel plays the bisexual performance artist Maureen Johnson with real brio though she seems a bit over-the-top even when not performing her supposedly avant-garde work, ""Over the Moon"". Despite nailing his passionate solo, ""One Song Glory"", Adam Pascal looks somewhat lost in his portrayal of Roger Davis, the tortured singer-songwriter who begrudgingly falls for Mimi Marquez, the borderline junkie/exotic dancer downstairs. With her saucer eyes and flirty demeanor, Rosario Dawson replaces original Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and she turns out to be an excellent choice, showing off unseen singing and dancing skills within the context of the most screen-savvy performance of the cast. She does an appropriately saucy turn on the showstopper, ""Out Tonight"". Rounding out the principal cast are another newcomer, Tracie Thoms, a belter who plays Maureen's lover yuppie lawyer Joanne Jefferson (and consequently wails with immaculate bravura the bridge to the show's most famous song, ""Seasons of Love""), and Taye Diggs, who manages to make the most of the relatively thankless role of Benny Coffin.No matter the variability of the acting, everyone sings with glorious power, a fact made clear at the outset by Columbus, who smartly has them sing ""Seasons of Love"" in the manner it was introduced onstage with spotlights on a darkened stage. He also takes cinematic liberties which work in some of the numbers retranslated into the film, such as ""Light My Candle"", ""Tango: Maureen"" and ""Take Me As I Am"". Some like the centerpiece ensemble, ""La Vie Boheme"", work almost the same way they did on stage with its sheer exuberance intact. Some scenes don't work as well, for example, ""What You Own"" where Roger is literally living out the symbolic lyrics in Santa Fe. With its more naturalistic tone in spite of the numerous breaks into song and dance, the movie reminds me less of Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbins' adaptation of ""West Side Story"" than of Milos Forman's take on ""Hair"". Be forewarned that those who loved the stage version are the ones who will most be in thrall over the film version.

966395,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B000E1YVZU,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[4, 4]","Rent. Adapted from the 1996 hit broadway musical by Johnathan Larson is an amazing film. No, amazing is an understatement. Think along the lines of phenomenal, yet it is even more than than that. I haven't seen a really good film I can say I would stop people on the streets to see, but Rent renewed that for me, and even now my 525,600 minutes of the year have become enjoyable to the least, and this film has started off in a great way.Brought on by it's information I found in magazines and talk shows, I thought maybe Rent would be something of originality. I have not been enjoying the recent slew of remakes, but am more than happy to see a film that is of difference than others. Not to mention, I haven't seen a musical on stage or film since the Little Shop of Horrors came to Arizona in 1999. I think good music is what every film needs. Rent had just a little bit more which made it even better than the rest.In New York City, the life of several friends is being threatened and they can tell you that in their own way. Mark Cohen and Roger Davis (Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal) are threatened to leave their apartment building when former friend Benjamin (Taye Diggs) plans to build a so-called cyberspace club inside the building. But that's when fate meets love and Mimi (Rosario Dawson) a fellow attendant to the building, falls in love with Roger.Past loves such as Mark's ex-girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) who's fallen in love with proper but committed Lawyer, Joann Jefferson (Trace Thoms) come to each other once again as friends. Angel finds Tom and life is becoming more difficult as the reality of everything sinks in for the seven friends. But there is nothing to do but love each other and live on with past dreams. Death may come and find them, but love will hold strong no matter who you are. And even then you won't have to pay the rent.I couldn't help but feel all throughout the movie that reality was more than captured in Rent, and it may sound far fetched because it is. Musicals are usually silly and make you laugh. Rent does make you laugh, there's no question about it. But you know you've watched a really good film when it stays with you long afterwards. In this case, I knew I had because even 24 hours after, I am going to see it again tomorrow. There's more than enough that's lifted off your mind as you relate the characters. Being a filmmaker myself, I could relate to Mark who took his beloved camera everywhere he went.As for music, such songs as ""Seasons of Love"" and ""What you own"" will touch you in the heart and in the mind realizing these characters are really you. ""Rent"" and ""Santa Fe"" will bring out the dreams and hardships you once faced (and probably still face) in your life. On the other hand, ""La Vie Boheme"" will make you laugh and laugh and laugh...and then some. The whole soundtrack has been stuck in my head since yesterday yet I enjoy remembering them (just not when I try to sleep!).Rent will hit you where you feel. There's more to Rent than anyone can explain. It's magic touches you, and for me, I'm a touchy feely kind of person, but have never been obessed with a film like this. It's one that stays with you long after, and is a film you can enjoy after a good long week. My week at school was not exactly the best, and that was all lifted off my shoulders when music was thrown in in less than 3 hours. Anyone can use Rent at anytime.

And I never did see the stage version of ""Rent""; only ""La Boheme"". However, this fact didn't limit my appreciation for this (film version) of ""Rent"", and perhaps enhanced it. The movie was far better than I expected, with its subtle wit, energy, and surprisingly good music (which beckons repeated listening).I do concur with others who suggest that key scenes were deleted while others were prolonged; however, the DVD provides an extra disc which includes these scenes, along with the remarkable story of Jonathan Larson's life.In short, I was captivated from the opening of ""Rent"", through the conclusion of all of the generous supplementary material.

966397,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000E1YVZU,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 7]","Set on some of New York's meanest streets and very loosely based on Puccini's LA BOHEME with the AIDS epidemic substituted for tuberculosis, Jonathan Larson's RENT is an unexpected collage of stark visuals, memorable music and lyrics, and on-the-edge characters--and it was more than enough for the play to win a host of critical accolades, including the 1996 Pulitzer Price for Dramatic literature, an honor only rarely awarded to musical fare.  But stage excitement seldom translates undiluted to the screen, and in this RENT is no exception.The basic story remains the same, and in general concerns the various artistic ambitions and romantic complications of several men and women whose savage rebellion against the status quo has led them to hand-to-mouth lives in New York.  But even as they come together to protest the impending commercialization of the dilapidated district they call home, their relationships with each other begin to spiral out of control--and the lifestyle of casual sex and drug abuse begins to take a serious toll, with several HIV-positive characters forced to face mortality in increasingly direct ways.With two exceptions, the cast consists of those who originated the roles in the 1996 Broadway show.  To my mind, the big noise here is Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who repeats his Tony award-winning performance as Angel, a street musician and drag queen who acts as the emotional center of the group; that said, however, the overall cast is quite fine and plays at full throttle, even if Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel do seem a bit too old for this story of youthful angst some ten years after they originated their roles on the New York stage.Unfortunately, the film stumbles in a visual sense.  Certainly there is considerable urban decay on the screen, but it is also very much a Hollywood-ized concept of it; instead of going with a rawly gritty quality, which would have benefited the material, the designers have elected to sweeten everything where possible, and the end result has a slightly ""sanitized for your protection"" quality.  But the real stumble is in the adaptation.Apparently the powers-that-be felt that the movie-going public was just not bright enough to sort out who is who and who is doing what; consequently many of the ensemble numbers have been somewhat simplified, and the result is somewhat less exciting that the originals.  To add further insult, it also seems very obvious that the powers-that-be drew the line at presenting the show as the opera that it is; on stage, RENT has very little in the way of spoken dialogue, but on screen the adaptors have been careful to separate the major musical numbers with chit-chat that adds nothing to the show and which actually creates yet another and still greater problem.Although RENT is most particularly remembered for such memorable set pieces as ""One Great Song,"" ""Light the Candle,"" ""Tango Maureen,"" and so on, Larson actually planted the a sense of time and place and considerable character development in the small musical transitions between these numbers--and virtually every one of those transitions have been cut in order to accommodate the notion that there has to be spoken dialogue.  When you add in one or two very questionable cuts of major songs as well... the end result has a tendency to read as more of a series of very memorable music videos instead of a cohesive whole.  It was a bad idea.Even so, and while RENT the movie will never compare to RENT the play, it still has enough going for it to hold you in a very firm grip, and I recommend it.  The special edition double DVD is also very strong in terms of bonuses, and it may well be a unique example of bonuses that give as much (if not more) information on the original Broadway version and its creators as to the film itself.

This is a fitting movie and done with the true intention that Jonathan Larson would have imagined it being translated into film. As a matter of fact (honey, I know this act), the opening number in the movie version of RENT is ""Seasons of Love"".RENT has of course enough of a rudimentary plot to cement together the emotional moments and great vocals, which are the film's raison d'tre.Mimi Marquez is a stripper Catscratch Club who idolizes her upstairs neighbor, Roger and tries to seduce him.  However, Roger is afraid to let himself fall in love with Mimi because he is infected with HIV and although attracted to her, is afraid of her ultimate rejection. Throw in the gay couple who unfortunately already have AIDS, Angel Dumott Schunard and Tom Collins who are more fortunate and are a match made in heaven.  Lastly you have Maureen Johnson who is an art performer and homeless advocate who has dumped Mark for another woman, Joanne Jefferson.  Mark Cohen narrates the film delivered exquisitely by Anthony Rapp. And they all have cinematic chemistry, especially since all except two are the original Broadway cast members.  The plot revolves around them not being able to pay their rent to the part-owner and former roommate, Benny.There are not enough superlatives to describe RENT, and I fear my review will not do it justice. This film has moments, just like the original Broadway show, that will leave you laughing.  It is not a comedy however, and if you have a heart, you will become teary-eyed and empathize and love all these characters.  In fact, you want to become their friends, even be one of them!If you are familiar with the Broadway version, you will notice that in ""One Song, Glory"", as Roger bolts that tune out, you catch past glimpses of what his life with April was like.  This is a wonderful feature that the film version could deliver where the Broadway version could not. Another plus, among the many, is ""Tango Maureen"" where Mark meets Joanne and they tango.  After Mark falls down they go into a tango extraordinaire that could only be delivered on film.  Very tasteful, very classy.RENT is tender, colorful, in-your-face, exuberant entertainment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you don't take the opportunity to see it while it's on the ""Big Screen"", then you're doing yourself a huge injustice.

And after paying close attention to the transfer of the play to the screen little has change in feelings about this work.Loosely based on Puccini's 'La Boheme' (with some direct quotes in the score) this musical drama has much to say about AIDS, kids as artists, survival, all forms of gay life, extended family - many subjects that make it worthy of production.  The cast performs extremely well from the opening 'Chorus Line' takeoff  through the intimate and blaring production numbers. The pacing is excellent, the cinematography is good, the mood is right.  So why the three star rating?  For this viewer/listener the score is so thread bare and trite that it is difficult to understand why it has attracted such huge success. There is one song (which opens the show) and otherwise the rest of the score melts into an indistinguishable m&eacute;lange of repetition.

966403,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000E1YVZU,Guy De Federicis,"[2, 5]","I saw ""Rent"" on Broadway in 1999. I remember thinking, somewhere into the second act, I'm loving this but there isn't a whole lot going on. ""Rent"" survives, -flourishes, on it's sweeping strokes of humanity; on it's bohemian urban ragamuffins singing the praises of life while suffering poverty, disease and drug addiction, like poor and junkie graduates from the school of ""Fame"". Big empty spaces in the musical, like a few bland characterizations, and sometimes tuneless songs, were overlooked due to the genuine portrait of unfortunate, but very much alive, lives in New York City's gutter level Alphabet City.And for awhile it looked as though ""Rent"", the movie was going to accomplish the same fete. The first half moves at a lively pace, with beautiful people in ragged clothes, struggling for warmth in candlelit urban dwellings, songs pouring out of them as if it was a natural language, and colorful musical crowd scenes. The fiery and passive scene of a unified neighborhood, in chorus, taking a stand against slum lords, is a visual delight. Angel still makes her drop-dead sexy, snaky entrance, and I was about to be content to see ""Rent"" again realized, if not creatively reborn.But somewhere along the way, the urban twilight-y atomosphere loses its spark. The thin story lines, which once served quite adequately as brush stroke generalizations of the urban poor, take center stage in lieu of the hardcore song of the city, rising up from the very bricks and mortar of Alphabet City. I thought the film was hurt very much by the absence of the schizophrenic bag lady, so evident in the Broadway production, pushing her shopping cart on stage and joining in on the cast's songs. She served as an anchor weight inclusion of unfortunate city dwellers, not all of whom are artistic bohemians. Here, she has a single dramatic scene that segregates her, as if depicting the real urban poor.It was my understanding that Spike Lee was to be the director of the filmed, ""Rent"", and it would be interesting to see what another artist would have done. Director Chris Columbus extracts dynamic performances from the cast, notably Rosario Dawson, as a sympathetic and gorgeous heroin addicted AIDS victim, but he wastes precious time in many scenes, particularly the culture class gay wedding, that seems to wander in from a production of ""Hair"", and stays much too long.It's been six years since I saw ""Rent"" on Broadway, and I still get offers from that theatre for reduced price tickets to a second viewing. I enjoyed ""Rent"", the movie, but I may finally take the theatre up on its offer, now that I'm reminded of what a great show it was.",3,RENT THE MOVIE,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2645,"['saw', 'Rent', 'Broadway', '1999', 'remember', 'thinking', 'somewhere', 'second', 'act', ""'m"", 'loving', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'Rent', 'survives', '-flourishes', 'sweeping', 'strokes', 'humanity', 'bohemian', 'urban', 'ragamuffins', 'singing', 'praises', 'life', 'suffering', 'poverty', 'disease', 'drug', 'addiction', 'poor', 'junkie', 'graduates', 'school', 'Fame', 'Big', 'empty', 'spaces', 'musical', 'few', 'bland', 'characterizations', 'sometimes', 'tuneless', 'songs', 'were', 'overlooked', 'due', 'genuine', 'portrait', 'unfortunate', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'gutter', 'level', 'Alphabet', 'City.And', 'awhile', 'looked', 'Rent', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'accomplish', 'same', 'fete', 'first', 'half', 'moves', 'lively', 'pace', 'beautiful', 'people', 'ragged', 'clothes', 'struggling', 'warmth', 'candlelit', 'urban', 'dwellings', 'songs', 'pouring', 'was', 'natural', 'language', 'colorful', 'musical', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'fiery', 'passive', 'scene', 'unified', 'neighborhood', 'chorus', 'taking', 'stand', 'slum', 'lords', 'visual', 'delight', 'Angel', 'still', 'drop-dead', 'sexy', 'snaky', 'entrance', 'was', 'be', 'content', 'see', 'Rent', 'again', 'realized', 'not', 'creatively', 'reborn.But', 'somewhere', 'way', 'urban', 'twilight-y', 'atomosphere', 'spark', 'thin', 'story', 'lines', 'once', 'served', 'quite', 'adequately', 'brush', 'stroke', 'generalizations', 'urban', 'poor', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'lieu', 'hardcore', 'song', 'city', 'rising', 'up', 'very', 'bricks', 'mortar', 'Alphabet', 'City', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'hurt', 'very', 'much', 'absence', 'schizophrenic', 'bag', 'lady', 'so', 'evident', 'Broadway', 'production', 'pushing', 'shopping', 'cart', 'stage', 'joining', 'cast', 'songs', 'served', 'anchor', 'weight', 'inclusion', 'unfortunate', 'city', 'dwellers', 'not', 'whom', 'are', 'artistic', 'bohemians', 'Here', 'single', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'depicting', 'real', 'urban', 'poor.It', 'was', 'understanding', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'was', 'be', 'director', 'filmed', 'Rent', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'artist', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'cast', 'notably', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'sympathetic', 'gorgeous', 'heroin', 'addicted', 'AIDS', 'victim', 'precious', 'time', 'many', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'culture', 'class', 'gay', 'wedding', 'wander', 'production', 'Hair', 'stays', 'much', 'too', 'long.It', 'been', 'six', 'years', 'saw', 'Rent', 'Broadway', 'still', 'get', 'offers', 'theatre', 'reduced', 'price', 'tickets', 'second', 'viewing', 'enjoyed', 'Rent', 'movie', 'may', 'finally', 'take', 'theatre', 'up', 'offer', 'now', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'was']",N/A

Great movie.  But the UMD just flat out sucks.  Believe it or not, there is NO CHAPTER SELECT option in the main menu.  Wow.  A musical UMD naturally ought to be separated into chapters that will let you easily go to the track you want to watch/listen, but that's not possible without a chapter selection menu.  Furthermore, the chapters are not bookmarked so that they start at the beginning of a song, which again, would make sense for a musical like Rent.  Video and audio are good, but I would have just made my own MP4 video file if I knew that the UMD would be so lame, especially since Sony now allows video of full 480x272 resolution to be played from memory stick.  Using PSP Video 9, you can make videos that are of comparable quality but only 700mb-1gb in size (AVC video@768kbps, AAC audio@128kbps) that will play off your pro duo memory stick.  And since the PSP now allows you to easily scene search by 1,2, or 5 minute intervals, it is much easier to find the song you want to play on the pro duo than on this UMD.

966408,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000E1YVZU,James Hiller,"[4, 5]","Long time has passed since I first heard this amazing music from a Broadway show that dared to be different. Ten years, in fact. In that time, our world has become a much different place; harsher, more scary, less tolerant in many ways. And all of that just makes Rent more relevant and more real, and speaks to us just as strongly as ever.Rent is the story of a group of artisians and visionaries, stuck in dire circumstances, struggling to make their mark in the world before the world makes its mark on them. Mark, a filmmaker, lives with Roger, a musician, in a rundown building in New York's Lower East Side. Mimi, a girl who lives below the pair falls madly in love with Roger. Collins, a friend and former roommate, meets Angel, a drummer drag queen, after getting bashed. Lawyer Joanne's on again, off again relationship with her sensuous partner Maureen, a performance artist, flows with the story.Together, these people make Rent. Each person strivse to fulfill their life's desires, but like the visionary opening scene, their dreams quickly turn to ash as they pitch them out the windows in fiery blazes as reality sets in. The story dares to suggest we must strive daily towards our goals, for we may not have a tomorrow to depend on.But Rent is so much more than story, it's the music. Songs brought over from the stage show are intact and beautiful. The powerhouse ""Rent"" opening number is equally as thrilling on celluloid. Angel and Collins' romp in ""I'll Cover You"" is powerfully joyful; as powerfully sad as its reprise at the funeral in the second half of the movie. La Vie Boheme is amazing; energetic, fun, and it makes you want to get up and dance. Songs missing from the musical do not leave gaps at all in the movie (well, perhaps one... ""Goodbye Love).The performances in the movie are rich. Portrayed by many of the originial cast members, who bring with them memories of Rent's early days, they each have a depth to their characters that communicates worlds just in a glance or a smile. Anthony Rapp's Mark look when he first meets Joanne is classic. Adam Pascal's ""Light My Candle"" is rich, sexy, and daring. Idina brings such humor and energy to her ""Over the Moon"" segment. Wilson Jermaine Heredia shines in Angel's ""Today for You"", and Jesse L. Martin steals the movie in his powerful ""I'll Cover You"" refrain. Newcomers Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Rosario Dawson each hold their own in the new group.The DVD brings two discs; the first, the movie with director's commentary. The second brings a powerful documentary on the life of Jonathan Larson. This documentary traces out the development of Larson's career, tragically cut short from his death just as Rent was going to take off. A very moving part of the documentary is a tribute to Larson's friends, Gordon, Allie, and Pam, who are mentioned in Rent.In retrospect, this just isn't a film, this is history. Chris Columbus has now captured on film orginial perfomances of an amazing musical. In a hundred years, when they are studying the devleopment of musical theater, they'll have this film to look back on to remember these moments. Jonathan Larson's gift to the world was the musical Rent. We now have this film to celebrate it; and celebrate, we shall.",5,"Rent, forever",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,3244,"['Long', 'time', 'passed', 'first', 'heard', 'amazing', 'music', 'Broadway', 'show', 'dared', 'be', 'different', 'Ten', 'years', 'fact', 'time', 'world', 'become', 'much', 'different', 'place', 'more', 'scary', 'less', 'tolerant', 'many', 'ways', 'just', 'Rent', 'more', 'relevant', 'more', 'real', 'just', 'as', 'strongly', 'ever.Rent', 'story', 'group', 'artisians', 'visionaries', 'stuck', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'struggling', 'make', 'mark', 'world', 'world', 'mark', 'Mark', 'filmmaker', 'Roger', 'musician', 'rundown', 'building', 'New', 'York', 'Lower', 'East', 'Side', 'Mimi', 'girl', 'who', 'pair', 'madly', 'love', 'Roger', 'Collins', 'friend', 'former', 'roommate', 'meets', 'Angel', 'drummer', 'drag', 'queen', 'getting', 'bashed', 'Lawyer', 'Joanne', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'relationship', 'sensuous', 'partner', 'Maureen', 'performance', 'artist', 'story.Together', 'people', 'make', 'Rent', 'person', 'strivse', 'fulfill', 'life', 'desires', 'visionary', 'opening', 'scene', 'dreams', 'quickly', 'turn', 'ash', 'pitch', 'out', 'windows', 'fiery', 'blazes', 'reality', 'sets', 'story', 'suggest', 'must', 'strive', 'daily', 'towards', 'goals', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'tomorrow', 'depend', 'on.But', 'Rent', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'music', 'Songs', 'brought', 'over', 'stage', 'show', 'are', 'intact', 'beautiful', 'powerhouse', 'Rent', 'opening', 'number', 'equally', 'thrilling', 'celluloid', 'Angel', 'Collins', 'romp', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'powerfully', 'joyful', 'powerfully', 'sad', 'reprise', 'funeral', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'La', 'Vie', 'Boheme', 'amazing', 'energetic', 'fun', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'Songs', 'missing', 'musical', 'do', 'not', 'leave', 'gaps', 'movie', 'well', 'perhaps', 'one', 'Goodbye', 'Love', '.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'rich', 'Portrayed', 'many', 'originial', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'bring', 'memories', 'Rent', 'early', 'days', 'have', 'depth', 'characters', 'worlds', 'just', 'glance', 'smile', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Mark', 'look', 'when', 'first', 'Joanne', 'classic', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'Light', 'My', 'Candle', 'rich', 'sexy', 'daring', 'Idina', 'such', 'humor', 'energy', 'Moon', 'segment', 'Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', 'shines', 'Angel', 'Today', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'movie', 'powerful', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'refrain', 'Newcomers', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Joanne', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'hold', 'own', 'new', 'group.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'movie', 'director', 'commentary', 'second', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'life', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'documentary', 'traces', 'out', 'development', 'Larson', 'career', 'tragically', 'cut', 'short', 'death', 'just', 'Rent', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'off', 'very', 'moving', 'part', 'documentary', 'tribute', 'Larson', 'friends', 'Gordon', 'Allie', 'Pam', 'who', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Rent.In', 'retrospect', 'just', ""n't"", 'film', 'history', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'now', 'captured', 'film', 'orginial', 'perfomances', 'amazing', 'musical', 'hundred', 'years', 'when', 'are', 'studying', 'devleopment', 'musical', 'theater', ""'ll"", 'have', 'film', 'look', 'back', 'remember', 'moments', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'gift', 'world', 'was', 'musical', 'Rent', 'now', 'have', 'film', 'celebrate', 'celebrate', 'shall']",N/A

I've got to say I've developed myself quite a little crush on Rosario Dawson.  I tell you, that girl NEEDS to put out an album!!!!  She was amazing in this movie!!!!  The whole cast were really good in fact.  They harmonized beautifully!  No matter which few cast members were singing they sounded good together!  Its when you got a whole handful of them singing at the same time that the songs really hit thier peak.  But whether many characters or just two, I don't remember a single song that i vehemently hated with a passion.As for the story...well...I kinda felt both beat over the head and stabbed at the same time.  Rich people suck, poor people are wonderful, blah blah blah.  I said this as kind of a joke, but I realized it could've been absolutely true and why they did it.  #####There's a scene in a dinner where all the poor people are going around and pushing the tables together.  At the end of thier line, three rich guys (the ones who want to tear down their apartments to make a cyber cafe or something) are sitting there.#####  Now it just so happens the poor people have square tables.  They can push their tables together and converse.  The rich peoples' table however is round, meaning they can't connect with anybody.  Which is, in fact, the point of the movie from what I could gather.

966414,A1V20TOIU7GNAH,B000E1YVZU,"Jeffrey M. Davis ""Jeffrey Matthew Davis""","[2, 5]","Being the good homosexual theater student that I am, I patiently waited for five-hundred twenty-five-thousand six-hundred minutes for the film version of Rent. Of course my expectations were high since almost the entire Broadway cast reunited for the film, and the film soundtrack (in my opinion) is much more enjoyable than the Original Broadway Cast recording. Sadly though, the film version of Rent made me more disappointed than seeing a horribly miscast and untalented thirty-something play the title role in last year's film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera.So what turned this Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning piece of theater into the worst film adaptation of a musical since A Chorus Line? I'd start by blaming virtually unknown screenwriter Steve Chbosky and director Chris Columbus as both obviously do not understand what the original stage version is all about.(...)Still, Rent is somewhat redeemed by its brilliant cast. ""Law and Order"" alum Jessie L. Martin gives a charming performance as Collins. His rendition of the heart-wrenching reprise to ""I'll Cover You"" is enough to win him a Golden Globe nomination. Other stand-outs are Tony Winner Idina Menzel's energetic and hilarious performance as the trashy, constantly horny bisexual Maureen. Her rendition of the monologue/song/performance art piece ""Over the Moon"" is both nonsensical and laugh-out-loud funny all at once. And Tracie Thoms as Maureen's sophisticated, Ivy-League lesbian lover Joanne gives a brilliantly understated and demure performance. Their fierce duet, ""Take Me or Leave Me"" is easily one of the most enjoyable moments of the film, as is Thoms's duet with Antony Rapp's Mark in the ""Tango: Maureen."" But the biggest surprise of the bunch is Rosario Dawson as the optimistic yet HIV positive junkie, Mimi. Who knew that she could sing or dance? At any rate, she is a joy to watch, and her striptease number ""Out Tonight"" is a high point of the film.Despite the enjoyable performances by the cast, Rent is plagued by bad writing, directing, and editing. As I watched this train wreck I could picture the producers of the upcoming adaptations of Dreamgirls and Hairspray cowering in a corner. My advice when it comes to Rent: save your money for The Producers, which will hopefully follow in the footsteps of better recent musicals like Moulin Rouge and Chicago. And if you must see Rent, well consider that renting that seat in the movie theater costs a lot more than renting the DVD will.",3,"How Do You Measure, Measure a Film?",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2490,"['Being', 'good', 'homosexual', 'theater', 'student', 'am', 'patiently', 'waited', 'five-hundred', 'twenty-five-thousand', 'six-hundred', 'minutes', 'film', 'version', 'Rent', 'course', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'almost', 'entire', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'reunited', 'film', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'recording', 'Sadly', 'film', 'version', 'Rent', 'made', 'more', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'untalented', 'thirty-something', 'play', 'title', 'role', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Phantom', 'Opera.So', 'what', 'turned', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Tony', 'Award', 'winning', 'piece', 'theater', 'worst', 'film', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'Chorus', 'Line', ""'d"", 'start', 'blaming', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Chbosky', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'obviously', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'original', 'stage', 'version', 'about.', 'Still', 'Rent', 'somewhat', 'redeemed', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Law', 'Order', 'alum', 'Jessie', 'L.', 'Martin', 'charming', 'performance', 'Collins', 'rendition', 'heart-wrenching', 'reprise', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'enough', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'Other', 'stand-outs', 'are', 'Tony', 'Winner', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'energetic', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'trashy', 'constantly', 'bisexual', 'Maureen', 'rendition', 'monologue/song/performance', 'art', 'piece', 'Moon', 'nonsensical', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'once', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Maureen', 'sophisticated', 'Ivy-League', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'Joanne', 'brilliantly', 'understated', 'demure', 'performance', 'fierce', 'duet', 'Take', 'Me', 'Leave', 'Me', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'film', 'Thoms', 'duet', 'Antony', 'Rapp', 'Mark', 'Tango', 'Maureen', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'bunch', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'optimistic', 'yet', 'HIV', 'positive', 'junkie', 'Mimi', 'Who', 'knew', 'could', 'sing', 'dance', 'rate', 'joy', 'watch', 'striptease', 'number', 'Out', 'Tonight', 'high', 'point', 'film.Despite', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'cast', 'Rent', 'plagued', 'bad', 'writing', 'directing', 'editing', 'watched', 'train', 'wreck', 'could', 'picture', 'producers', 'upcoming', 'adaptations', 'Dreamgirls', 'Hairspray', 'cowering', 'corner', 'My', 'advice', 'when', 'Rent', 'save', 'money', 'Producers', 'will', 'hopefully', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'better', 'recent', 'musicals', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'must', 'see', 'Rent', 'well', 'consider', 'renting', 'seat', 'movie', 'theater', 'lot', 'more', 'renting', 'DVD', 'will']",N/A

But to see it on film is a totally flat experience. It just doesn't work on the screen for me. Although you've got a top talented cast, the incredible energy and electricity that bolted across the stage are nowhere to be found here.The musical is a nitty, gritty story based in dank, scroungy Village surroundings, filled with nitty gritty people living on the edge. Since I lived in NYC for 30 years, I instantly felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can't imagine.  But to spend two hours in a movie theater, watching this dank, depressing story unfold, is a dark experience.  The musical numbers all seem forced. The people aren't very likable. They're all too dramatic and intense for one's comfort zone and the reason the movie bombed, is that middle America probably couldn't understand why the people in this movie just didn't pay the damned rent--and avoid all the drama and problems!This movie did very well in large cities where there were people who could identify with this bonhemian story of tragedy and AIDs. But even for someone like myself who is very familiar with this world, which takes place in the Village, where I lived, it's a dour, depressing experience with very little to feel upbeat about.I couldn't sympathize with the druggies and the prosties nor did any of the musical numbers electrify.

I will be the first to say that because of the subject matter (it is about a bohemian lifestyle, after all so what does one expect?) it's not for everyone. I would classify myself as fairly conservative -- conservative values, Christian, etc. and again, I classify Rent as an outstanding work. I cared about these characters without judgment and condemnation and challenge others who would avoid this movie because of the subject matter to be open-minded to the human beings (regardless of whether or not you agree with lifestyles, etc.). It has the potential to change your life, and increase your compassion toward others. That may sound a bit melodramatic, but it is true.OK...off my soap box.What a thrill it is for me to see this Broadway cast portray their very same roles on the big screen.

McCormick,"[5, 11]","*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ***I have to admit that, before I saw this movie, I was expecting something much worse than what the movie actually turned out to be. My expectations had been built from reading plot summaries and hearing one or two of the songs plus the lyrics from a few of the others. However, I decided to give the movie a fair chance, as I've been wrong in my expectations before. In the case of Rent, I won't say I was wrong or right. I was kind of half-right in my expectations.The movie isn't bad, but it is corny, pretentious, pseudo-philosophical, and schmaltzy. It's been said before, but these characters don't come across as people of passion and strong beliefs. They rather come across as excessively idealistic losers who are upset because society makes them do something worthwhile to earn their keep instead of shooting videos of their friends hanging out or spending years writing a single trite song.Their former friend and now successful businessman is considered a sell-out, though it's not clear what principles he's compromised for money, other than the principle of freeloading. Don't get me wrong - there's plenty wrong with being power-hungry and casting aside people for the sake of profit, but this story hardly captures any of the things that are actually wrong with it.Along these lines lie pseudo-philosophical statements like ""We're not gonna pay rent, 'cause everything is rent."" I still don't know what that is actually supposed to mean. The best explanation I've heard so far is that it's referring to the fact that you have to pay lots of bills and all that, but if that's what it was intended to mean, it's an incredibly vapid point.On the subject of the movie's emotional impact, it sounds horrible, but the truth is I was *laughing* during Angel's funeral, and it's not because I found anything particularly funny about Angel's death. That scene could have been one that was actually moving, but instead they started singing ""525,600 minutes"", and the scene suddenly became nothing but corny schmaltz.

However, this late-1980's tale of struggling Bohemians is ultimately unsatisfying.  Though a number of the characters must face grave difficulties, including addiction and AIDS, it is hard to feel for the ""struggle"" of those who are provided free residence and spend much of their time living irresponsibly.  The turnabout of now having to owe and entire year's rent is startling, but, on the other hand, I know very few people who have the luxury of living for free, or then simply deciding they will continue to live for free if the rules suddenly change.  On top of this, more than a couple of comments suggest that life in New York can't possibly get more ""sh***y"" than ""today"" (late 1980's), and it makes one wonder what our characters would have thought of a city being attacked by terrorists, destroying the World Trade Center and killing 3,000 people.  With so much suffering going on in the world, it is hard to feel sorry for a group of Bohemians whose main concern is seeking some kind of fellowship as they lead a reckless (and often dangerous) lifestyle with no moral restrictions.Time is indeed precious, and I appreciate Jonathan Larson's astonishing musical talent, but I would have preferred to spend these two hours with another set of characters.

966428,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,B000E1YVZU,Katie,"[10, 47]","Okay, people who didn't like it: stop saying that it's just for RENT fans.  While I'm sure a lot of RENT fans liked it, a lot of them didn't.  And it's certainly not for every musical fan, either.  We might even hate it more than you do because we know about the stage version, which is superior to the movie.Anyway, like most hardcore musical fans, I was a RENThead for about a year.  Also like most hardcore musical fans, the phase wore off rather quickly and when I saw the stage production not much later I was bitterly disappointed.  I don't think that RENT is a bad show (in fact, I am listening to the OBC's ""Without You"" as I write this,) I just think that it is horribly overrated.  It's always annoyed me that it's about, as I like to put it, people with no jobs who complain about having no money.  The blatant hypocrisy also has really bothered me: the movie doesn't have ""Contact,"" but in that song they make fun of safe sex.  I'm sorry, but with that kind of attitude it's not really surprising that you got HIV.  I also hate most of the characters, whom I find to be shallow and quite selfish.Anyway, onto the movie itself.  For the record, I hate Chris Columbus.  I have not seen one movie of his that I like.  People say that he is too faithful to the source, but that is entirely not true.  He adds what some would consider minor changes, but these changes are enough to completely warp something into something else, something that it entirely shouldn't be.First off, setting it in 1989.  WHAT was he thinking?  RENT does not belong in that year.  It belongs in the 90's.  There were so many anachronisms and inconsistancies that it was ridiculous.  Thelma and Louise is the one that critics have pointed out the most.  Now, if Chris Columbus had a good reason for setting it in 1989 I might be a bit kinder, but I believe he set it there because that's when he lived in NYC.  Uh... yeah.Second off, all or nothing.  RENT is considered a rock opera.  That means minimal dialogue.  That means including the recitative-like ""Tune-Ups"" and ""Voicemails"" which were dispersed throughout the score to unify everything.  Without those interconnecting ""dialogue"" songs, the score became a jumbled-together mess: songs started, randomly and abruptly.  That also means leaving in ""Christmas Bells"" and ""Goodbye, Love.""  Taking out ""Goodbye, Love"" removed the important development of Roger's reason for leaving, which was because Mimi was ill.  It also took out Mark's development, when Roger says that all he does is hide behind his camera.  The ommission of ""Halloween"" did that, as well.  I won't even begin to talk about how they depleted Benny's character.Third off, the ""staging"" for some of the songs.  ""Another Day"" should not be sung from Mimi and co. on the ground to Roger on the balcony.  I kept thinking ""If she's bugging you so much, go back inside!""  It loses its impact if it's so distant.  I was really mad about that, because I love that song.  The scenes with Roger in Santa Fe were so darn cheesy I cannot even begin to explain what was wrong with them, and setting ""What You Own"" right after he comes back is quite stupid to me.  My favorite part of the song has always been when Roger sings ""The filmmaker cannot see"" and we're like ""OMG!  He's back!""  Chris Columbus TOTALLY ruined that effect.  And setting ""Out Tonight"" at a strip club?  What the heck?  I'm so thoroughly perturbed by that I won't even begin to nitpick about how Mimi is an S&M; dancer, not a Go Go Dancer.Fourth, what was with the rent notices being burned and thrown into the street?  Maybe it looked cool, but all I could think was ""Fire hazard!""Fifth, and my BIGGEST issue which gets its own section... the gay wedding!  What the heck!  Not only was it completely random and there for no purpose other than political soapboxing, it was OOC.  Maureen isn't a commitment kind of gal.  Joanne's parents, who hate Maureen in the original musical, would NEVER approve.  The scene itself was really just uncomfortable.  If they wanted a gay couple to marry, why not Collins and Angel?  At least they were a good couple.  Ugh ugh ugh.Now, onto performances themselves.  I'm sorry, but the OBC was too old.  They were tired.  They had played the roles a gazillion time and had nothing new to say.  If you compare them to the OBC recording, there's a multitude of difference.  I'll review each individually, though:Mark - Anthony Rapp did all right, but nothing special.Roger - Adam Pascal just can't sing anymore; he's been beating his voice up too much.  It has deteriorated and it shows.  He lacked passion.  Roger's a hard character to play without making him whiney, and while Adam succeeded in doing this on the OBC he didn't so much in the movie.Mimi - Boring.  Rosario's acting itself was good, but RENT is a musical.  That means acting alone won't suffice: you need to act when you sing.  Also, she didn't have the vocal chops for it.  Her voice was pretty enough, but Mimi isn't a pretty little ingenue.  Also, this isn't her fault, but she was too sweet and pretty to be Mimi; Mimi needs to seem more... rough and used.  And she straight-toned the entire time.  Drove me nuts.  She lacked the sheer passion and edge of Daphen Ruben-Vega, who sang the heck out of those songs.Maureen - I am no fan of Idina Menzel, I will admit that right out.  Like Adam Pascal, her voice has deteriorated.  I blame her smoking and bellowing at the top of her lungs in Wicked.  Anyway, personality-wise she was fine, though I hate Maureen.Collins - Very good; he made me cry during ""I'll Cover You (reprise)""  And his voice is wonderful.Angel - Awesome as well, but I've always loved Wilson in that role.Benny - Poor guy didn't get much of a part, but what we saw of him was good.Joanne - Tracy Thoms was FANTASTIC!  I like her even better than OBC Joanne!  This is the first time I'd ever seen Joanne ""win"" in ""Take Me Or Leave Me.""  Also the first time I've ever really liked her.In this movie's defense, it was better than the Phantom of the Opera (not that it's hard.)  And, though they performed better back in the day, the vocal performances were (with the exception of Rosario Dawson) at least passable.  That's hard to find in musical-movies nowadays.But I agree with other people who said that this movie came far too late.  HIV isn't as much of a problem anymore, after all.  Without really great characters (which RENT has never, ever had IMO) it's hard to give us a reason to care about people who, as I said earlier, have no job and complain about having no money.",2,"Chris Columbus fails to hide RENT's flaws; in fact, he brings them out more",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,6567,"['Okay', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'saying', 'just', 'RENT',

Walsh ""lilgracie346""","[0, 1]","Some Rent-o-philes can't get over the liberties taken by the film version of the beloved Broadway show, but judging a film by the same standards as a theatrical production is simply unfair.  This film does its very best to capture the heart and spirit of the show without trying to outdo the stage show with film-only effects, sets, and superstar casting.  True, some of the original cast members had to be replaced for the film (the most notable substitution being Rosario Dawson as Mimi), but the stage show is still present by all accounts.  Roger, Mark, Maureen, Collins, and Angel are back for the film version and manage to maintain their strong performances after god knows how many times around.  The filmmakers made strategic decisions of which songs to leave out, with some not being missed (Contact - a strange, staccato chanting of sexual innuendo and warnings) and others questionably absent (Goodbye Love, one of the most poignant songs of the entire show).  Overall, the film does the show as much justice as it can and respects the origins of these songs as it portrays them for a larger audience.  The second disc of special features is mostly just a two-hour tribute to the writer of the show which, frankly, could have been done in about thirty minutes.  The commentary track is decent, but doesn't shed as much light on production decisions or other differences between the film and the stage show as I would have liked.",4,Forget regret...,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,1440,"['Rent-o-philes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'liberties', 'taken', 'film', 'version', 'beloved', 'Broadway', 'show', 'judging', 'film', 'same', 'standards', 'theatrical', 'production', 'simply', 'unfair', 'film', 'very', 'best', 'capture', 'heart', 'spirit', 'show', 'trying', 'outdo', 'stage', 'show', 'film-only', 'effects', 'sets', 'superstar', 'casting', 'True', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'be', 'replaced', 'film', 'most', 'notable', 'substitution', 'being', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Mimi', 'stage', 'show', 'still', 'present', 'accounts', 'Roger', 'Mark', 'Maureen', 'Collins', 'Angel', 'are', 'back', 'film', 'version', 'manage', 'maintain', 'strong', 'performances', 'god', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'around', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'strategic', 'decisions', 'songs', 'leave', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'missed', 'Contact', 'strange', 'staccato', 'chanting', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'warnings', 'others', 'questionably', 'absent', 'Goodbye', 'Love', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'songs', 'entire', 'show', 'Overall', 'film', 'show', 'much', 'justice', 'can', 'respects', 'origins', 'songs', 'larger', 'audience', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'mostly', 'just', 'two-hour', 'tribute', 'writer', 'show', 'frankly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'commentary', 'track', 'decent', ""n't"", 'shed', 'much', 'light', 'production', 'decisions', 'other', 'differences', 'film', 'stage', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'liked']",N/A
966433,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000E1YVZU,Kevin Killian,"[255, 284]","I saw the movie in a beautiful theater in downtown San Francisco on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and was surprised to find so few people in the movie theater--maybe 75 of us, and the theater could have fit 500.  I wonder if some of the lukewarm reviews haven't influenced people's decisions to go to RENT.  Hope not, for I'm here to tell you, this movie is dynamite and IMHO much, much better than the play.  For one thing, in the movie you can hear every word, even with the increased rock instrumentation, for hundreds of sound experts have worked their magic and made sure that even people underwater could hear every single syllable; whereas on stage, it depended from night to night what percentage of the lyrics were going to be coming across the temperamental sound system of the Nederlander (NYC).I did miss Daphne Rubin-Vega who was incomparably sexy and chilling as Mimi, but I never believed her being in love, and Rosario Dawson looked like she was just 'playing' at being bad and underneath she was ready to fall in love as soon as she saw Roger through the window.  Her scenes of addiction are captured in the movie effectively, in a rpaid montage that might disconcert some rentheads but will, I think, be easily understood by those new to the show.Yes, some of the actors looked older than 20 somethings.  But we forget that most of those who died of AIDS in the 1989-90 period were actually in their 30s.  What's the big deal?  To me, Angel's fate is all the more sad because he seemed to be healthy for so long and then, all of a sudden, well, any more would bring me into spoiler territory.Idina Menzel is not as over the top as she is on stage, but there's still plenty of fire power there, and she's bigger than anything in the movies since the heyday of Betty Hutton!  She looks remarkably beautiful and she doesn't miss a trick; and just when you think she'll overshadow Tracie Thoms as her attorney girlfriend, Joanne, the latter pulls off some memorable comic business and signals her disappointment and regret with her expressive brown eyes.  Anthony Rapp is charming as Mark Cohen, he comes off as a tiny terror, I wonder how tall he is, the constant scenes of him snarking down the streets with his fists clenched in anger at his sides, but no one else around to reveal his true proportions--the old Alan Ladd trick.  And Adam Pascal is suave and tormented in equal measures as Roger.  His eyelashes are so long I expected them to have a special spotlights in the credits, but no.I have to disagree with the posters who claim that Larson wrote all the best numbers for the men in the cast.  Maybe that's personal pleading, but I find the best songs pretty much divided right down the middle.  Mimi's ""Out Tonight"" isn't as exciting as on stage, but it is much more compellingly staged, as Rosario Dawson steps out of the Cat Scratch Club after her shift only to launch into the second verse, and seems to scale the wall of the loft to get to Roger like Catwoman in the third.  (""I'll let you make me . . ."")  ""Light My Candle"" suffers a little without Daphne Rubin-Vega in it, and Adam Pascal acts as though he knows he's cheating on her with Rosario Dawson.  Afterwards he gets his balls back.  The ensemble singing of ""Will I?"" and ""Another Day"" are perfectly staged and rehearsed, and it's there that I started to lose it.  I guess I must have spent the last seventy minutes of the movie in a continual rain of tears.  By the end I had to sit through all the credits in a vain attempt to gather composure.  The faces of those whom I lost to AIDS flashed before my eyes.  Not all of them, but some of them.  I did resolve to go out and try to practice love on a grand scale.  They got me this time.  ""No other path, no other way, give in to love or live in fear.""These sentiments are vapid and, in the daylight, seem a little silly, but the beauty and power of the movie is to convince you of their truth.  Good work all around.

966434,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000E1YVZU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 6]","What makes Rent unique is that it was the first Broadway production that put the lights on AIDS and HIV.  It is also the second show that openly depicted gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) issues on the main stage in New York, since the Broadway musical La Cage aux Folles in 1983.  A decade after its opening, Rent received its cinematic treatment.  It kept most of its original cast members from the stage, which helped bring about the same feel from the stage.  However, it does not possess the same uniqueness in the cinematic realm, as film has openly portrayed gay issues over the last 15 years through terrific films such as Maurice (1987), Philadelphia (1993), Bound (1996), Boys Don't Cry (1999), and most recently Brokeback Mountain (2005).  In addition, films such as the disturbing cult New York film Kids (1995) and the television film And the Band Played On (1993) handled the issue of HIV and AIDS even before the premiere of the stage musical.  Despite its lack of cinematic rareness, Rent still helps shed some important light on HIV/AIDS and GLBT issues, and does so through much music and song.In the shadow of AIDS and HIV the audience gets to experience a musical with roots in Puccini's opera La boh&egrave;me, which is set in the Alphabet City of New York City.  It is a location where artists and others with non-traditional life philosophies sought refuge including myriads of poverty stricken people.  Alphabet City also suffered from drugs and violent crimes during the 1980s, which is when Rent takes place and follows the fate of eight friends and lovers.  The social setting is almost more important than the characters in the film, as the atmosphere in which they live heavily colors their political, social, economical perspective on life.The opening shot with the eight main characters on a stage allows the audience to draw that it is a stage musical moved to a set, as they sing the Seasons of Love.  Abruptly, the imagery moves from the countdown to one of filmmaker Mark Cohen's (Anthony Rapp) 8mm films that show the gritty and poor part of New York that many want to escape.  Instead, Mark embraces it by showing it to the audience, which helps set the tone of the film.Amidst the New York chaos, one character after another appears through song, as we get to know them as friends such as Mark's roommate Roger Davis (Adam Pascal).  He is musician struggling with coming up with the perfect song while constantly remaining in a glum state pondering the past and his acquisition of AIDS through a dirty drug needle.  They have a friend Tom Collins (Jesse L, Martin), a gay non-tenured NYU college professor with AIDS, who often stays with them at their place.  Mark and Roger also have a former friend, Benjamin Coffin III (Taye Diggs) whom they now loathe, as he has become their landlord while imposing rules and rent on them, as he sold them out by joining the aristocratic society.  Simultaneously, Mark suffers from a broken heart, as his girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) has left him for the IVY-League graduate Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Last, but certainly not least, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), a flamboyant transvestite, suffers from AIDS, but also expresses a strong affectionate love for Tom Collins that he reciprocates.  Together these eight characters go through a year of emotional ups and downs cornered by sadness, disappointments, and death which ultimately regains itself like bird Phoenix out of the ashes by spreading its wings of love.The musical aspect attempts to carry a triumphantly poignant celebration of love and mutually painful struggle in the shadow of death and illness.  However, it is not always so easy on the ear, as it aurally provides some cinematic gracelessness.  Much of the awkwardness emerges in the story line driven by its overwhelming song and lyrics, as the audience almost never gets a chance to breath or contemplate the importance of each piece between the musical numbers.  In addition, in some instances the lyrics sound awkward through their gawky rhyming.  Besides the musical portion, the audience will also lose interest in the characters, as the film self-indulgently begins to entertain itself in the revolutionary undertones that displays by ""sticking it to the man.""  In a story where people's emotions are essential, as a viewer I almost felt cheated, because the psychological aspects of the characters were never fully portrayed in the way film only can provide.  Instead, the film leans too heavily on the music, as if it exclusively would bring about the emotional moments in the film, which makes it feel that the director Columbus never elevated the stage musical to what cinema could help create.  In the end, Rent provides a superficially intriguing musical, but never reaches the accomplishments of other contemporary film musicals such as Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Chicago (2002), or even close to the many musicals from the 1950s and 60s.",3,"Ok, Yet Congested Musical with Very Little Room for Reflection...",1140912000,"02 26,

""Kimberly""","[1, 4]","I have never made a movie review- I usually wait until the movie comes to DVD before bashing it or praising it... but, this movie was EXTRAORDINARY. I just left the theater and the songs, feelings, and emotions are still playing in my head and right now I am so close to tears it is unbelievable.This is the best movie I have seen in years! And in my opinon is the last good show Broadway has ever done.I didn't become a ""RENT"" fan until seeing this AMAZING movie. Hearing the songs, the feelings of wanting to not be forgotten, and having someone to love you is are at the true heart of this movie. After the third song, I felt like all the characters in the movie were somehow friends of mine... and we have know eachother forever. Feeling comfortable with the characters and their feelings of inaddiqesce made me feel like I was going on this journey with them.A perfect cast with all your favorites from the orginal Broadway show. Each one of them perfectly cast in their role... give inspirational renditions of the songs that brought them to fame and inspiring performances!  Anthony Rap manages to somehow stand out among them though as though he is the ""firm root"" of their friendship- and sings powerful while adding comic relief when needed.All about trying to find yourself and express yourself in the 90s... no matter what your living is you'll be able to relate wether a doctor or an underrated actor. No matter what you'll love the movie. Relate to feelings of wanting something more while having to deal with ""real world"" issues such as paying rent, drugs, and diease. On a bad day ""Rent"" is considered the ""Hair"" of the 90s. Taking place when AIDs was virtually a fatal diease... you see the affliction and feel the pain for those in this movie afflicted. While you only lose one of those who follow you on the journey of these friends you can truly feel sad for those other characters you have met that are afflicted.I found myself falling in love with all of them as though they were actual friends... The soundtrack to the movie may in fact be better than the actual Broadway version.  This movie musical will NOT dissappoint the fans of the orginal and may actual outshine the Broadway performances. With inspirational music and a great cast to match...""Rent"" can't go wrong even the least fanatical musical fan will be impressed.All in all wether your a Broadway fan, a music buff, or just want to see a great movie ""Rent"" is all you need! Get the friends together and go be AMAZED by the power of ""RENT.""  And please keep your fingers crossed for some Oscar nominations here!",5,No Day But Today!

I'm now sorry I waited, despite knowing the general story I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. The songs were upbeat and not too long (in general I dislike musicals) and the story was very well put together and the acting exceptional, in my opinion. Friends trying to figure out their lives and accept each other, warts and all, find that shared experience and hardship can form a bond akin to family. While the premise of low-rent was central to the story, anyone who lives in new york knows that the apartments these struggling artist have in the movie are ridiculous. That aside, it was stylized a bit much, but that seems to be usual with musicals. This movie was so watchable it was almost mesmerizing, and even a bit touching at times. If you like musicals, stories about artists, believe in bohemian ideals, see the world as us against them, or even just enjoy a good story of ""we're all just people"", you will probably enjoy this movie.

966441,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E1YVZU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","I am still not yet to the point where I have grown tired of watching my favorite parts of this musical (or listening to them when I am driving in my car and away from my DVD players).  Ironically the touring company was next door in Wisconsin when the movie came out on DVD, but it will be back in a couple of weeks and I have tickets to go see it, even though it means driving from the shores of one Great Lake to another, because I really want to see what the show is like on stage.  What I do know at this point is that I like the music more than the characters, and the soundtrack more than the original cast album, although the legion of Rentheads out there may be horrified by such sentiments.  But then I never really related to the original Bohemian characters in Puccini's opera either.  I swear that Roger (Adam Pascal) looks like Moebius the Living-Vampire from Marvel comics and I cannot get past that idea. I should be able to identify with would-be filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), but I like his ability to tango more than the cinematic style of his work.  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is sexy, but dying, and Joanee (Tracie Thoms) and Maureen (Idina Menzel) cannot wholly commit to the idea that opposites attract. As for Benjamin (Taye Diggs), the dude is definitely slumming.The characters that I really care about are Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) because I think they best represent love amongst this group of friends.  I know that Mimi and Roger are supposed to be the main couple (""Light My Candle""), and that Maureen and Joanne are a truly combustible couple (""Take Me or Leave Me""), but the real love story is Angel and Collins and when I reduce the dynamic of ""Rent"" to a pair of songs I point to ""I'll Cover You"" and its reprise.  So even when logic dictates that this movie should be rated at 4.5 at best, I think of that final shot in the film of Angel and I have to round up become of its poignancy (the alternative ending, the smile on Tom's face when Angel walks by and holds his hand for a minute is almost as transcendent).Turning some of the songs into dialogue so it is not wall-to-wall singing was not necessary from my perspective. I am perfectly willing to listen to musicals or operas that are music and all singing from start to finish. Still, I appreciate the attempt to give the story a bit more dramatic weight by doing so.  Ultimately, what is so appealing about the music in ""Rent"" are the harmonies, as amply demonstrated by ""Seasons of Love.""  Ultimately, the emotions matter more than the words. Is ""La Boheme"" any less effective because most of us do not know precisely what they are singing? After all, one of the most famous arias in the opera is Colline saying goodbye to his coat. When ""Life Support,"" ""Will I"" and ""Another Day"" combine at the end to make up ""Finale B,"" the lyrics are simplistic, but the emotional effect is (here comes the word again) transcendent, even compared to something like the sextet from ""Lucia di Lammermoor."" In other words, the sound and fury signify a lot in ""Rent,"" and if in the end it all comes down to love that is not exactly a bad thing. Plus, with the six voices at the end (eight if you do the alternative version), I think most of us can find a vocal part to sing along with well within our comfort range, not that it stops us from switching parts and trying to be more ambitious. Larson also provides so many different types of songs that every couple of songs something in a style you really like comes along.I really like the soundtrack more than the original cast recording. Of course, six of the original cast are here, so I should point out that not only do I think that those six have brought a decade's worth of experiencing singing these songs to their performances but that the two newbies add something to the mix. Martin's ""Santa Fe"" and reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" evidence a great deal more depth as he puts his younger self to shame.  One my favorite vocal moments is in ""Goodbye Love"" when the voices of the two newcomers, Dawson and Thoms, blend and power through, ""I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had, someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you."" The biggest heresy would be that I like the way ""Finale B"" is played straight for the emotional impact of Mimi's revival instead of the mock deus ex machina of the original (off) Broadway production.Again, I realize that those who have seen the musical can hold the exact opposite position and I fully appreciate that seeing the show live, especially songs like ""Over the Moon,"" is something different from this film. Beyond that, producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with Green Day, did a great job of updating the sound for the 21st century. As for director Chris Columbus, it taking this particular musical to the streets he did not make it to the sacred heights of ""West Side Story,"" but I think ""Rent"" works a lot better than the likes of ""Hair"" and ""Godspell"" on the big scream.  Several of his montages, most notably for ""Without You,"" are quite effective, but I understand that some fans will not be able to get beyond the fact ""Goodbye Love"" is relegated to the deleted scenes.  The bottom line is that my affection for this movie is based more on the ear connected to the heart than the eye linked to the brain, and I will just leave it at that.  I certainly understand why so many people find ""Rent"" so profoundly moving.",5,Not the Broadway show but still a compelling musical experience,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,5447,"['am', 'still',

966444,A12OTDIWIG841L,B000E1YVZU,Leslie Thompson,"[1, 2]","I haven't seen this on Broadway, but I saw a stunning production in Hershey a few years ago. However, this movie is nothing to scoff at. Adapting a play for the big screen has many hurdles, and of course it won't be the same as in the theater, but doesn't anyone want to bring part of that experience into their home, aside from just having the soundtrack? Give these people credit for having interest in doing it and not writing off all musicals as frivolous and/or stupid. And at least most of the actors are from the original cast, unlike Chicago (although it was much more successful, perhaps due to big name stars).It was neat to see such vivid settings as opposed to a bare bones stage. In Roger's song Glory, I loved seeing the flashbacks of him with blond, short hair, meeting the woman who later gave him HIV. And in the Tango Maureen, watching the rundown building transform into a fancy ballroom with marble floors and chandeliers, all dancers in black except for Maureen, in red, was an amazing scene.I don't know why they chose to start off the movie with Seasons of Love, but it didn't seem to hurt much. I wasn't too impressed with the title song though. They left out some parts such as Joanne's funny lines, ""Maureen I'm not a theater person...I'll never be a theater person!"" but that's because she did not appear in that song. Throwing the firey trash onto the street didn't make much sense either.At first I thought I would be annoyed by Rosario Dawson, but was pleasantly surprised by her singing and acting talent.  I also liked seeing Jesse L. Martin outside of his detective role on Law and Order. He and Angel made a great pair. Angel is one of the most lovable characters, and Heredia was brilliant in that role.  I cry when Angel dies every time.Little details added a lot to the movie, such as the scene in the subway for the Santa Fe song. Collins delights some women in the train by dancing with them briefly, as well as making other passengers smile, looking happy. And when Mark and Joanne go to the Buzzline office to work out a deal, Joanne's attention is obviously focused on Maureen, watching her flirt with the secretary through the glass office wall.Mark's character annoyed me as usual, with his whiny voice and rarely without his camcorder. He's a ""bleeding heart"" (as the one homeless woman tagged him) who isn't too realistic about a lot of things, but at least he tries to make a difference. I don't believe he's trying to become rich by filming what he does; he just wants to show the world what it's like out there. I don't consider it ""selling out"" either for him to sell footage to Buzzline. If you need money to survive, there is no shame in doing what he did. Kind of ridiculous, really, to think of it as selling out. Take what you get, because living on principles alone can make you homeless, and then you can't do much for your cause. Last time I watched this, I joked with friends that they didn't take Mimi to the hospital near the end because that would be ""selling out."" Kind of a bad joke, I guess.So sure, criticize it all you want (I do), but movies always have some advantages over theater, while theaters will always have advantages over movies.

Jonathan Larson composed the Pulitzer Prize winning revolutionary rock opera. Rent was loosely based on Puccini's opera `La Boheme'. Rent has been on Broadway for twelve years and will be closing September 7, 2008.RENT is about eight starving artists living during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1989 living in the East Village in New York City. ""Measuring their lives in love"" the eight struggling bohemians must cope with poverty, illness, starvation, life, love and trying to pay off last year's and the current year's rent.The eight friends are Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), a nerdy love-struck film producer who is trying to get his big break. Rodger Davis (Adam Pascal) is a washed up songwriter with HIV whose girlfriend Amy recently died of AIDS. Mimi Marquez, the drug addicted dancer at The Catscratch Club who falls in love with Rodger. Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel) is a bisexual outspoken performer who dumped Mark for a lawyer named Joanne Jefferson. Joanne (Tracie Thoms) is a lawyer who is sick of Maureen mooning over other men and women. Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) is a computer-age philosopher at NYU with AIDS who falls in love with Angel Dumott Schunard, a gay Drag Queen street performer who ""provides a comfortable home for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" (Angel from ""You Okay Honey?"" song from Rent). Last but not least is Benjamin ""Benny"" Coffin III an old roommate of Mark, Collins, and Maureen who recently married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys and is now the landlord of Avenue A, who hopes to evict all the homeless from Alphabet City and build a cyber studio.Directed by Chris Columbus (Known for Home Alone and Harry Potter) this powerful and riveting movie moves even the hardest of hearts and leaves everyone crying and with a feeling of hope.

Many complaints by moviegoers stem from the fact that the film is about homosexuality and AIDS and has (supposedly) been falsely advertised. These ignorant people have no doubt been living under a rock for the past ten years to not know what Rent is about. I can't believe they'd expect an entire 135 minute film about people who can't pay their rent? Please!Rent is one of those movies that makes me realize why I love movies so much. It's passionate, energetic, fun, entertaining, touching, beautiful, and wonderfully romantic. It's everything a movie should be, and more. It's just one of those near-perfect movies that makes you laugh, cry, and want to dance. Once the film is over, it makes you want to see it again, and again, and again. This is the only movie I have ever wanted to see again once it was over, and the only one I bothered to see three times in the theatre (so far). Each time it kept getting better and better.The songs are superb and add so much depth to the already terrific story, an update of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme."" ""Light My Candle"" is a brilliant and fabulous reimagining of the scene in La Boheme where Mimi and Rodolfo first meet. The beat is catchy and the lyrics are fabulous. It is one of my favorite songs in the film, probably a tie with the equally brilliant and wonderfully incorrect ""La Vie Boheme,"" the definite show-stopper in a film full of amazing songs.What makes the film so great more than anything, is the fact that the story is so relatable. Gays, straights, and all those in-between will all find something to love in this movie. The cast all perform well and it was a smart choice to cast the original Broadway cast members in their original roles. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas are perfect substitutes for the only two members of the original cast who didn't return for the film.In my opinion, Rent is by far the best, and most underrated and least appreciated movie of the year. I think it was lost in the Brokeback Mountain hype, but that film has nothing on this one. Brokeback Mountain was a horrid mess, while Rent is just simply an amazing film. This is one that keeps all those who have seen it flocking back to the theatre. It's really a shame that more people haven't discovered it. I know it's based on a 10 year old Broadway musical, but this is a truly revolutionary film for gay people, not Brokeback Mountain like everyone believes. I felt that had an offensive view of gay men as only being into rough sex. This one showed the tender side of gay relationships, and for that alone, it's a triumph!

966454,AEMNZIVOQ07VF,B000E1YVZU,Meghan Brunner,"[5, 8]","I saw Rent twice on stage and have the soundtrack memorized. I was excited to see it had come out on DVD as well... until I watched it.Seeing it on stage was transcendent. This movie cut a bunch of the songs (time constraints?), cut many of the layers out of some songs that were kept (too hard to film on their budget?), and turned many lines that were sung in the original into spoken dialogue (wanted to make it a musical instead of a rock opera?), which felt awkward and flat.They also changed parts of the story. For example, in the stage version, April left a note to Roger saying the two of them had AIDS and slit her wrist in the bathroom; in the film, he's standing beside her as she gets her test results and we're to assume she died of AIDS-related complications, which takes a lot of the punch out of Roger's character. In the stage version, all of Act One happens on Christmas Eve; in the film, it's split up into two (or more?) days for no apparent reason, which makes the lyrics of some later songs inaccurate.

966456,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000E1YVZU,Melissa Niksic,"[3, 7]","It wouldn't be fair to expect the film version of ""Rent"" to completely live up to the original Broadway show, but Chris Columbus' production does a pretty good job. This is a great example of a musical that has been successfully adapted to the big screen. However, there are definitely some kinks that prevent me from giving this movie five stars.""Rent"" is a rock opera that was loosely based on Puccini's ""La Boh&egrave;me"" and also contains elements reminiscent of ""West Side Story."" The story revolves around an eclectic group of young people living in New York City that are coping with a world filled with corruption, anger, and disease. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne, the entire Broadway cast returned to star in the film version of the show, and that's what makes this movie so great. The performances are emotionally riveting and the music is absolutely phenomenal.I don't understand why it took Hollywood almost ten years to turn ""Rent"" into a movie. Even though the cast is every bit as it was ten years ago, it's kind of weird to see that all of the characters are a decade older than they're supposed to be. The film feels kind of dated when you watch it: although Aids and homosexuality are still topics of discussion, they aren't the issues at the forefront of our lives anymore, and I hope that doesn't turn off people who are experiencing ""Rent"" for the first time.There are a couple of nitpicky issues I have with the movie, and the first is the omission of the song ""Goodbye Love."" Ordinarily, I can completely understand that directors have to cut material for film adaptations, but I read an interview with Columbus in which he said that he chose to cut the song because he thought it was ""too emotional to deal with after Angel's death."" WHAT?! Talk about disrespecting someone else's artistic choices and completely belittling the mentality of your audience in the process! That was just ridiculous. Also, the film was supposed to be set in 1989, but I never would have picked up on that if the characters hadn't made reference to it a couple of times...everything looked like it was supposed to be set in the present day. The only other ""clue"" about the time period that Columbus threw into the film was a poorly-placed shot of the World Trade Center, which I thought was tasteless and kind of sloppy. There were also some very stupid camera shots in the film, such as that awful close-up of Adam Pascal when he's singing ""Your Eyes"" to his beloved Mimi...he looked so ridiculous that it completely ruined the moment. Also, there were some issues with poor character development in the film. That had nothing to do with the actors' performances: certain elements of the story just didn't transfer very well to the big screen. For example, poor Taye Diggs (who is a very good actor) had nothing to do during most of the film and just wandered around looking like a lost puppy dog. It was a real waste of some extraordinary talent. Oh well.Overall, this is a very good movie. The cast is wonderful and the music is spectacular. The not-so-great things about the film are all Chris Columbus' fault, so maybe someone should tell him not to make any movies for a while.",4,"Pretty impressive, but sloppy in parts",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,3229,"['would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'expect', 'film', 'version', 'Rent', 'completely', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'production', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'great', 'example', 'musical', 'been', 'successfully', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'However', 'are', 'definitely', 'kinks', 'prevent', 'giving', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'Rent', 'rock', 'opera', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'Puccini', 'La', 'Boh', 'egrave', 'also', 'elements', 'reminiscent', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'story', 'eclectic', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'coping', 'world', 'filled', 'corruption', 'anger', 'disease', 'exception', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Mimi', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Joanne', 'entire', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'returned', 'star', 'film', 'version', 'show', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'music', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'took', 'Hollywood', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'turn', 'Rent', 'movie', 'Even', 'cast', 'bit', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'kind', 'weird', 'see', 'characters', 'are', 'decade', 'older', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'feels', 'kind', 'dated', 'when', 'watch', 'Aids', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'still', 'topics', 'discussion', 'are', ""n't"", 'issues', 'forefront', 'lives', 'anymore', 'hope', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'experiencing', 'Rent', 'first', 'are', 'couple', 'nitpicky', 'issues', 'have', 'movie', 'first', 'omission', 'song', 'Goodbye', 'Love', 'Ordinarily', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'directors', 'have', 'cut', 'material', 'film', 'adaptations', 'read', 'interview', 'Columbus', 'said', 'chose', 'cut', 'song', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'emotional', 'deal', 'Angel', 'death', 'WHAT', 'Talk', 'disrespecting', 'someone', 'else', 'artistic', 'choices', 'completely', 'belittling', 'mentality', 'audience', 'process', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Also', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', '1989', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'characters', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'reference', 'couple', 'times', 'everything', 'looked', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'only', 'other', 'clue', 'time', 'period', 'Columbus', 'threw', 'film', 'was', 'poorly-placed', 'shot', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'thought', 'was', 'tasteless', 'kind', 'sloppy', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'stupid', 'camera', 'shots', 'film', 'such', 'awful', 'close-up', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'when', 'singing', 'Eyes', 'beloved', 'Mimi', 'looked', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'completely', 'ruined', 'moment', 'Also', 'were', 'issues', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'actors', 'performances', 'certain', 'elements', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'very', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'example', 'poor', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'wandered', 'around', 'looking', 'lost', 'puppy', 'dog', 'was', 'real', 'waste', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'Oh', 'well.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'music', 'spectacular', 'not-so-great', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'fault', 'so', 'maybe', 'someone', 'should', 'tell', 'not', 'make', 'movies', 'while']",N/A

A movie I was going to see received a negative review. Hours later, I saw that movie. That critic didn't know jack.That movie wasRENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This adaptation of an equally awesome Broadway musical is far from another nail in the coffin of the movie musical. In fact, it is another nail pried off said coffin.Fans will approach this film with hesitation since it is directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and Home Alone) and starring six of the original eight leading cast members from the original Broadway cast as well as the girl who went topless in Alexander and some girl who no one has probably ever heard of before.Be not afraid: Columbus knows what he is doing, the six cast members look like they left the show last week (in that they look as young as ever) and the two newbies fit in as if they were there from the beginning.All the musical numbers are translated effectively onto the screen. Rather than being completely sung through like onstage, the film contains a good deal of dialogue. Also, a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery noticeable change is the rearranging of Seasons of Love as the opening number when onstage it opens Act II. What some may consider blasphemy, this customer calls a very good call. Doing the show as it was written would not have worked for film and since Seasons of Love is the most famous song, it's better to start the film off. Like the two new cast members, Seasons of Love feels lik it's been the opening number all along and the dialogue feels like it's been a part of the show forever.Now to the cast:Anthony Rapp is back as Mark Cohen, the aspiring filmmaker. Having only heard him on the soundtrack, he's even better on film.Adam Pascal, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Aida early in its run, is amazing as Roger Davis, the HIV+ musician looking to write ""one great song"" before he leaves this world. Love his hairdo as well.Idina Menzel, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Wicked shortly after she won her Tony, kicks ass as Maureen Johnson, Mark's lesbian ex-girlfriend. She's sexy, she's funny, she's sassy. You gotta love it.Taye Diggs, Idina's real life husband, is equally excellent as Benjamin Coffin III aka Benny, the sellout landlord who married some rich bimbo and is trying to evict his friends. Frankly, his talents are underused. He only gets one good song to himself and it's over far too quickly.Wilson Jermaine Heredia reprises his Tony winning role as Angel, the cross-dressing HIV+ street musician who wins the heart of another man and the audience. He has a voice like an angel, and man does he make an attractive woman.Jesse L. Martin steals the show as Tom Collins, an HIV+ ex-NYU professor. His voice is like velvet, he brings huge laughs (stealing the movie when he bursts into the apartment declaring a ""Merry Christmas, bitches!""), and his rendition of the reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" is my favorite moment of the show. Hell, he's my favorite character in the piece.The newbies are Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson.Tracie Thoms is superior to Fredi Walker, the original Joanne. As the lesbian lawyer who Maureen leaves Mark for, she wins the audience over with her kick-ass voice and humor. Ironically, she has auditioned several times for Rent. Let's hope she makes it to the actual show in the near future.Rosario Dawson is a wild spitfire as Mimi, the (you guessed it) HIV+ S&M; dancer. She could dance circles around Daphne Rubin-Vega, the original Mimi, and is a hell of a lot prettier. She sings and dances like a pro too.With cameos by Aisha de Haas (another original cast member) as a bag lady and Sarah Silverman as tabloid newshost Alexi Darling, the cast is a joy to watch.Add to this joyous Bohemian celebration some sorely overlooked cinematography and you have a film that made this reviewer turn to his Dad and say, ""I'm so happy!""Overall grade: A+",5,Rent Rules All,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,3944,"['was', 'last', 'day', 'school', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'trotted', 'downstairs', 'check', 'paper', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'received', 'negative', 'review', 'Hours', 'later', 'saw', 'movie', 'critic', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'jack.That', 'movie', 'wasRENT', 'adaptation', 'equally', 'awesome', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'far', 'nail', 'coffin', 'movie', 'musical', 'fact', 'nail', 'pried', 'off', 'said', 'coffin.Fans', 'will', 'approach', 'film', 'hesitation', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Home', 'Alone', 'starring', 'six', 'original', 'eight', 'leading', 'cast', 'members', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'girl', 'who', 'went', 'topless', 'Alexander', 'girl', 'who', 'one', 'probably', 'ever', 'heard', 'before.Be', 'not', 'afraid', 'Columbus', 'what', 'doing', 'six', 'cast', 'members', 'look', 'left', 'show', 'last', 'week', 'look', 'as', 'young', 'ever', 'two', 'newbies', 'fit', 'were', 'there', 'beginning.All', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'translated', 'effectively', 'screen', 'Rather', 'being', 'completely', 'sung', 'like', 'onstage', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'Also', 'veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery', 'noticeable', 'change', 'rearranging', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'opening', 'number', 'when', 'onstage', 'Act', 'II', 'What', 'may', 'consider', 'blasphemy', 'customer', 'very', 'good', 'call', 'Doing', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'film', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'most', 'famous', 'song', 'better', 'start', 'film', 'off', 'two', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'feels', 'lik', 'been', 'opening', 'number', 'along', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'been', 'part', 'show', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'back', 'Mark', 'Cohen', 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'Having', 'only', 'heard', 'soundtrack', 'even', 'better', 'film.Adam', 'Pascal', 'who', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Aida', 'early', 'run', 'amazing', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'HIV+', 'musician', 'looking', 'write', 'one', 'great', 'song', 'world', 'Love', 'hairdo', 'well.Idina', 'Menzel', 'who', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Wicked', 'shortly', 'won', 'Tony', 'ass', 'Maureen', 'Johnson', 'Mark', 'lesbian', 'ex-girlfriend', 'sexy', 'funny', 'sassy', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'it.Taye', 'Diggs', 'Idina', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Benjamin', 'Coffin', 'III', 'aka', 'Benny', 'sellout', 'landlord', 'who', 'married', 'rich', 'bimbo', 'trying', 'evict', 'friends', 'Frankly', 'talents', 'are', 'underused', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'song', 'far', 'too', 'quickly.Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', 'Tony', 'winning', 'role', 'Angel', 'cross-dressing', 'HIV+', 'street', 'musician', 'who', 'heart', 'man', 'audience', 'voice', 'angel', 'man', 'make', 'attractive', 'woman.Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'show', 'Tom', 'Collins', 'HIV+', 'ex-NYU', 'professor', 'voice', 'velvet', 'huge', 'laughs', 'stealing', 'movie', 'when', 'apartment', 'declaring', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'rendition', 'reprise', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'favorite', 'moment', 'show', 'Hell', 'favorite', 'character', 'piece.The', 'newbies', 'are', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Rosario', 'Dawson.Tracie', 'Thoms', 'superior', 'Fredi', 'Walker', 'original', 'Joanne', 'lesbian', 'lawyer', 'who', 'Maureen', 'Mark', 'audience', 'kick-ass', 'voice', 'humor', 'Ironically', 'auditioned', 'several', 'times', 'Rent', 'Let', 'hope', 'actual', 'show', 'near', 'future.Rosario', 'Dawson', 'wild', 'spitfire', 'Mimi', 'guessed', 'HIV+', 'S', 'M', 'dancer', 'could', 'dance', 'circles', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'original', 'Mimi', 'hell', 'lot', 'prettier', 'sings', 'dances', 'pro', 'too.With', 'cameos', 'Aisha', 'de', 'Haas', 'original', 'cast', 'member', 'bag', 'lady', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'tabloid', 'newshost', 'Alexi', 'Darling', 'cast', 'joy', 'watch.Add', 'joyous', 'Bohemian', 'celebration', 'sorely', 'overlooked', 'cinematography', 'have', 'film', 'made', 'reviewer', 'turn', 'Dad', 'say', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'Overall', 'grade', 'A+']",N/A

Remember this is a story about Gen X early twenty year olds and though they perform well: Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (Mark, Roger, Angel and Maureen) look like what they are, mid-thirty year olds.

966460,A76GWMMHDDFID,B000E1YVZU,Michael D. Deforbes,"[3, 4]","I've become a burgeoning Renthead, but I've never seen the musical yet. I listen to the soundtrack constantly. Actually my first experience with Rent was through this movie. I loved the songs and the music, but after seeing pics and some video of the original show, I came to the conclusion that Chris Columbus took Jonathan Larson's inspired work and made it so uninspiring.His first mistake was to shoot on location or sets that look like New York. When you look at the set design of the musical, it was conceptual and abstract. If the set designers of the musical wanted to copy reality, they would have done that, but they realized that Rent (like many musicals) is a fable. Therefore the stylized abstract set works with the rock musical genre. The look of the movie is based on reality (they are singing in the streets and dancing in cafes). And because of that, it looks like every other musical or rock video set in New York. And other musicals, like West Side Story, do it so much better. And this is a shame because Rent was so fresh and different and this movie makes it seem so ordinary.I'm not a filmmaker, but I think it would have been very interesting to shoot this musical with all of the actors against a bluescreen and then add a GCI conceptual stylized version of New York in the background. That way the environment of New York could look fresh and different, just like it did in the original musical.Another aspect of the film that is so dissapointing is it's failure to carry the same emotional weight of the musical. Take for instance the scene when the cast is walking away from the funeral and begin arguing. This is one of the most emotionally charged scenes in the musical, the breakdown of this family of friends that we've come to love. How does Columbus handle this? He shows us a far establising shot with the friends walking through a cemetary. You can barely see their faces! And then he edits out the arguement/duet between Mark and Roger which was the conclusion of that emotional arc in the musical. Just like his two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus does not know how to bring out the emotional arc of a storyline.The best part of this DVD was the No Day But Today documentary on the 2nd disc which tells the story of Larson and Rent. That was much more interesting and inspiring than the movie. And it is a shame because this was/is an innovative unique musical. There was nothing like it that came before and there has been nothing like it since, and this movie makes it seem so pedestrian.",2,Not What It Could Have Been Thanks to the Uninspired Chris Columbus,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,2533,"[""'ve"", 'become', 'burgeoning', 'Renthead', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'musical', 'yet', 'listen', 'soundtrack', 'constantly', 'Actually', 'first', 'experience', 'Rent', 'was', 'movie', 'loved', 'songs', 'music', 'seeing', 'pics', 'video', 'original', 'show', 'came', 'conclusion', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'took', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'inspired', 'work', 'made', 'so', 'uninspiring.His', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'shoot', 'location', 'sets', 'look', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'look', 'set', 'design', 'musical', 'was', 'conceptual', 'abstract', 'set', 'designers', 'musical', 'wanted', 'copy', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'realized', 'Rent', 'many', 'musicals', 'fable', 'stylized', 'abstract', 'set', 'works', 'rock', 'musical', 'genre', 'look', 'movie', 'based', 'reality', 'are', 'singing', 'streets', 'dancing', 'cafes', 'other', 'musical', 'rock', 'video', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'musicals', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'shame', 'Rent', 'was', 'so', 'fresh', 'different', 'movie', 'seem', 'so', 'ordinary.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'filmmaker', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'shoot', 'musical', 'actors', 'bluescreen', 'then', 'add', 'GCI', 'conceptual', 'stylized', 'version', 'New', 'York', 'background', 'way', 'environment', 'New', 'York', 'could', 'look', 'fresh', 'different', 'just', 'did', 'original', 'musical.Another', 'aspect', 'film', 'so', 'dissapointing', 'failure', 'carry', 'same', 'emotional', 'weight', 'musical', 'Take', 'instance', 'scene', 'when', 'cast', 'walking', 'away', 'funeral', 'begin', 'arguing', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scenes', 'musical', 'breakdown', 'family', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'How', 'Columbus', 'handle', 'far', 'establising', 'shot', 'friends', 'walking', 'cemetary', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'then', 'out', 'arguement/duet', 'Mark', 'Roger', 'was', 'conclusion', 'emotional', 'arc', 'musical', 'Just', 'two', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'emotional', 'arc', 'storyline.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'No', 'Day', 'Today', 'documentary', '2nd', 'disc', 'story', 'Larson', 'Rent', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'shame', 'innovative', 'unique', 'musical', 'was', 'nothing', 'came', 'been', 'nothing', 'movie', 'seem', 'so', 'pedestrian']",N/A

Having seen Rent 5 times, in three states and 2 different countries, I honestly didn't care if the movie was a religious follower of the play; I didn't care that some of the 'original' players were not along for the ride.  The stage version is my favorite musical of all time, and I've seen plenty of them.  Every time I've gone to see the show it's because I 'just want to see it one more time..' which inevitably leads to just one more, and just one more.The movie is as magical as the show.  In a scant 2 hours and 15 minutes (the time flies by) the whole story is told.  Some of the details have changed, and die-hards have dissected those differences enough that I don't feel the need to recap them again here.  Suffice it to say, RENT captured a distinct time - the late 80's/early 90's and the AIDS epidemic at its most lethal - and the many different ways a group of friends dealt with the tragedy.  How amazing it is that even though AIDS is less of a death sentence today (at least in America) than it was at that time, the story is still as powerful and relevant as it was when Jonathan Larson wrote it back then.If you truly loved the show, you won't nitpick the finer details of things that were changed; rather, you'll be grateful that it's been committed to film for good.  If you don't like musicals, you will likely not like this film.

966462,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000E1YVZU,Michael Zuffa,"[20, 41]","""Rent"" is the story of eight New Yorkers from Christmas Eve 1989 to Christmas Eve 1990.  Those New Yorkers include Mimi (Dawson), a stripper who got HIV from sharing needles; Tom Collins (Martin), a gay man with HIV; Angel (Heredia), a transvestite with HIV; Roger (Pascal), a musician who also got HIV from sharing needles; and Mark (Rapp), a filmmaker who is trying to catch a break.  When old friend Benny (Diggs), the guy who owns the tenement that they all live in, threatens to evict them unless they start paying rent, they begin to worry about what the future holds for them.""Rent"" is based on the popular musical of the same name and stars most of the original Broadway cast.  That is probably the greatest thing I can say about this movie, and I applaud the filmmakers for getting the cast to reprise their roles.  After all, they are the ones who made the characters what they are.  The music is OK, the stand out song being ""Seasons of Love"".  Of course, that is the first song, and the rest of the songs are lesser in comparison, so it is all downhill song-wise from there.  The story is maddening, as these lazy people struggle to live rent-free so that they can just enjoy life.  While I appreciate their desire to enjoy the time they have, I hated the characters for doing it at the expense of others.I did not like this movie.  I suppose to see it live is more impressive, and that may be enough to overshadow the dumb story, but that does not work in movie form.  This is for die hard fans of the musical only.

966465,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B000E1YVZU,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[8, 11]","I love ""Rent.""From the first time I saw the musical, I couldn't get it out of my head.If wearing out a CD was possible, I would have done so with the soundtrack. Borderline obsessed, I was blown away with the energy, the vitality; it was raw, it was sexual, it was passionate.I never got to see the original cast perform the show, though. I understand that was quite a sight to behold.So you see, when I heard the majority of the original cast were to perform in the film, I was ecstatic. I vigorously defended the casting of the ""older"" actors; my letter to that effect made it into Entertainment Weekly way back when.When the film soundtrack arrived, I could not wait and listened to it over and over again...and if you have checked out the spotlight review over there on Amazon, you'll see how impressed I was.This film is a respectful recreation of ""Rent"", using the people who know it best. It loses some heat in its' gritty ""expansion"" into the real world, but I cannot deny the visceral thrill of seeing these originators coming back one more time for Jonathan.And that's the bottom line: this is for Jonathan Larson. This is a huge valentine for him. I imagine he would have been touched that so many people care, and so many people came back to do this.The song sequence is a bit rearranged; a few bits and songs are excised. The actual storytelling is more clear, more straightforward. My wife actually preferred this version to the stage version.It's not perfect. My initial experience in the theater noticed a few slow spots. The fade-to-blacks seemed to take forever. But that was more than likely my impatience in getting to ""the good stuff."" And there's a lot of good stuff here.The flaming rain in the title song. Rosario Dawson's searingly sexy performance in both ""Light My Candle"" and ""Out Tonight."" Tracie Thoms' powerhouse vocals in...well...pretty much every time she opened her mouth. Her duet with Idina Menzel in ""Take Me or Leave Me"" starts off stiff (that whole commitment ceremony felt forced) but ends with fireworks. The ""Tango Maureen"", with Anthony Rapp, is a lovely stylistic change from the original show...with the extended tango sequence a visual treat. Adam Pascal's rocking Roger belts out soaring melodies, and still manages to look tortured. His confessional ""Your Eyes"" works MUCH better here than in the stage version. The song works better sung to one person than to an audience.What more can be said about Jesse L. Martin? His soulful exuberance lights up the screen with every smile. His acrobatic ""Santa Fe"" on a subway car is a joy; his duet with Wilson Jermaine Heredia strolling through Tompkins Square Park in ""I'll Cover You"" was one of the most romantic scenes I've seen in a film in years.And let's get back to Mr. Heredia. His Angel character is the film's sweet, emotional core. By using little touches like a wink here, a smile there, a pinky wave...when Angel gets sick, you're devastated. Even when you know it's coming. And finally Anthony Rapp's performance as the observer/commentator holds everything together. He creates perspective for us.""La Vie Boheme"" has the whole cast in a hyper-verbal, hip-thrusting, table-hopping, orgiastic frenzy, and I loved every second of it.Only Taye Diggs seems to get shorted; but that's the fault of the character Benny. He just doesn't have much to do when compared to the big, colorful people surrounding him.Chris Columbus does a fine job here. Making it ""real"" was the only style choice he had. Anything else would have meant simply sticking a camera in a theater and filming a stage show. I'm not a director, and I'm so enamored of the show...so protective of it, really...that of course I think there are things that could have been done better. Like the editing. It should have been ""peppier"", more energetic. But the thing is I'm probably wrong. I cut people open for a living, I don't cut film. It would have ended up looking like a bad commercial or music video. This film breathes.Although, I wish they could have edited in the song ""Halloween"", and I actually prefer the alternate ending to the one in the film. Probably because it's more like the original. Definitely check out the deleted scenes.You really need to see the documentary on disc two. It will make the experience of seeing ""Rent"" infinitely better. In fact, you'll race to re-watch the film after seeing this. It's one of the best making-of's around. If you don't openly weep at least twice while you're watching, you have no business seeing this movie. The abbreviated life of Jonathan Larson is now inextricably linked with ""Rent."" I wish I had known the guy. That's the feeling you get watching this very well made documentary.This musical about the precious brevity of life is populated by the very people you see in this documentary. I'm not talking about the actors. You'll see his actual, old friends and think, ""Is that Roger? Couldn't that be Joanne?""And they are. They all are.And the characters are all Jonathan as well.I came to love his parents and his sister, caring for this musical, tending to it, protecting it, all in the love and remembrance of their son and brother. This is all they have left of him, and they've ensured it will last forever.As one mysterious person said, breaking the silence after the first performance of the show following his death...""Thank you Jonathan Larson.""",5,Jonathan Larson is smiling right now...,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,5380,"['love', 'Rent', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'musical', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head.If', 'wearing',

And even when it does get somewhat depressing and sad, it manages to stay relatively positive.Overall, while Rent doesn't have the same quality or magic that Chicago had, it still has plenty enough, and makes this an enjoyable experience.

966472,A2T02KBUTKW8VG,B000E1YVZU,MtGiraffe,"[3, 5]","Almost 10 years ago, a Broadway musical named ""Rent"" opened and quickly spawned a devoted legion of fans known as ""Rent-heads.""  A film version of the show was inevitable but took almost a decade to reach the big screen.  Was it worth the wait?  Well, yes and no.First, the good news: the overall spirit of the stage show, which I'll admit I've seen nine times, is intact.  The music is still excellent, and six of the eight original Broadway cast members reprise their portrayals for the big screen (and the two new additions are surprisingly strong as well).  If you've never seen the show (and most people haven't), you should still enjoy the film if you're a fan of musicals, rock music, and/or the independent spirit of broke twentysomethings.  If you can't stand movies where the characters frequently and spontaneously break into song, avoid this film (though these songs are much closer to today's rock music than most musicals you'll see).Now, the disappointing news: while the spirit remains the same and the cast is strong, director Chris Columbus (who directed the first two--and blandest--""Harry Potter"" films) has made enough needless changes to the source material that the overall film will likely leave a frustrated taste in any hardcore Rent-head's mouth.  Some of the changes are good (having ""Santa Fe"" sung on a subway car works very well, and even the risky move of setting ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a country club pays off), but Columbus tries too hard to please mass audiences by using flashier locations (Roger now sings ""What You Own"" in the middle of the New Mexico desert, making the number seem like a Calvin Klein ad) and replacing some of the musical's sung lyrics with spoken dialogue (which has a negatively comic effect for anyone already familiar with the show's music; imagine hearing Dorothy speak the lyrics to ""Over the Rainbow"" in ""The Wizard of Oz"").Regardless of whether or not you've seen ""Rent"" on stage, you should see the film if you're a fan of the musical genre.  It is a good film.  But the show is better.A note about the DVD:The bonus disc contains a great documentary called ""No Day But Today,"" which details ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's life and the eventual genesis of ""Rent.""  The documentary is excellent, especially considering it's a special feature on a DVD.  It stands well enough on its own that any fan of the show will love it whether or not they liked the film.The bonus disc also includes alternate/deleted scenes and songs including ""Goodbye, Love,"" ""Halloween,"" and an alternate ending that is far superior to the one they ended up using and closer to the ending of the stage show.  (Chris Columbus's commentary track on the alternate ending reveals his uncertainty with using the ending they did use, and he was right to be uncertain; he should have gone with his gut and kept this one.)",4,The Long-Awaited Film Version Doesn't (And Does) Disappoint,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,2858,"['Almost', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'named', 'Rent', 'opened', 'quickly', 'spawned', 'devoted', 'legion', 'fans', 'known', 'Rent-heads', 'film', 'version', 'show', 'was', 'inevitable', 'took', 'almost', 'decade', 'reach', 'big', 'screen', 'Was', 'wait', 'Well', 'yes', 'no.First', 'good', 'news', 'overall', 'spirit', 'stage', 'show', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nine', 'times', 'intact', 'music', 'still', 'excellent', 'six', 'eight', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'members', 'reprise', 'portrayals', 'big', 'screen', 'two', 'new', 'additions', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'should', 'still', 'enjoy', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'musicals', 'rock', 'music', 'and/or', 'independent', 'spirit', 'broke', 'twentysomethings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'movies', 'where', 'characters', 'frequently', 'spontaneously', 'break', 'song', 'avoid', 'film', 'songs', 'are', 'much', 'closer', 'today', 'rock', 'music', 'most', 'musicals', ""'ll"", 'see', '.Now', 'disappointing', 'news', 'spirit', 'same', 'cast', 'strong', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'who', 'directed', 'first', 'two', 'blandest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'made', 'enough', 'needless', 'changes', 'source', 'material', 'overall', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'leave', 'frustrated', 'taste', 'hardcore', 'Rent-head', 'mouth', 'changes', 'are', 'good', 'having', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'sung', 'subway', 'car', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'risky', 'move', 'setting', 'Take', 'Me', 'Leave', 'Me', 'country', 'club', 'Columbus', 'too', 'hard', 'please', 'mass', 'audiences', 'using', 'flashier', 'locations', 'Roger', 'now', 'What', 'Own', 'middle', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'making', 'number', 'seem', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'ad', 'replacing', 'musical', 'sung', 'lyrics', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'negatively', 'comic', 'effect', 'anyone', 'already', 'familiar', 'show', 'music', 'imagine', 'hearing', 'Dorothy', 'speak', 'lyrics', 'Rainbow', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '.Regardless', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Rent', 'stage', 'should', 'see', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'musical', 'genre', 'good', 'film', 'show', 'better.A', 'note', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'disc', 'great', 'documentary', 'called', 'Day', 'Today', 'details', 'Rent', 'creator', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'life', 'eventual', 'genesis', 'Rent', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'especially', 'considering', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'well', 'enough', 'own', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'not', 'liked', 'film.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'also', 'alternate/deleted', 'scenes', 'songs', 'including', 'Goodbye', 'Love', 'Halloween', 'alternate', 'ending', 'far', 'superior', 'one', 'ended', 'up', 'using', 'closer', 'ending', 'stage', 'show', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'commentary', 'track', 'alternate', 'ending', 'reveals', 'uncertainty', 'using', 'ending', 'did', 'use', 'was', 'right', 'be', 'uncertain', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'gut', 'kept', 'one']",N/A

By then we were all familiar with the story fo Joanthan Larson who wrote the show and tragically died before the show even opened.  Legends esepcially on Broadway are made of stories like these but for me there was a more perosnal reason to see this show.  Having grown up in the East Village I was familiar with the area and the people who both lived and worked there.  But for several reasons I was disappointed with the show although I loved the music and purchased the album. Then I read a movie based on the show was being made and when I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this again.  I seriously wondered how they would capture the essence of Manhattan and the high energy of the performers. But I didn't have to wonder for long.  From the first scene with the 8 principal actos standing on stage singing Seasons of Love, I knew I was in for a movie treat. Not only did I enjoy the movie, I loved it and plan to purchase it so I can watch it again and again.Based on the opera La Boheme, Rent tells the story of a group of young people living, loving and dying in the area of Manhattan called the East Village.  Known as the hub of the 60's movement 40 odd years ago, in recent years the area became known for squatters and disenchanted young adults. For me, familiar with the area, the movie had all of the energy of this part of Manhattan and the lives of those who live there.Focusing on 8 individuals that included Angel, a drag queen with AIDS, his lover Tom to Maureen a performance artist and finally to Marc, a filmmaker who in the end captured their story for all times.  While the show was loud and at times I felt the performers were shouting over the music, the film was beautifully conceived and allowed the listener to make sense of the words.  The actors, most of them from the Broadwayshow, were excellent. With the exception of The Sound of Music and Chicago it is rare that I think a movie based on a Broadway musical is better.  But in the case of the movie Rent, I loved every minute of this movie and was sorry to see it end.  The music so poignant continues to play in my head and I am sure the late Jonathan Larson must be smiling down from heaven to see how well this movie was made by Chris Columbus. While the subject matter is difficult at times and at the very least gripping and poignant, I suggest this movie to all who would enjoy seeing an excellent film.",5,A Movie for All Seasons,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2495,"['When', 'tickets', 'show', 'Rent', 'first', 'went', 'sale', 'knew', 'had', 'purchased', 'family', 'then', 'were', 'familiar', 'story', 'fo', 'Joanthan', 'Larson', 'who', 'wrote', 'show', 'tragically', 'died', 'show', 'even', 'opened', 'Legends', 'esepcially', 'Broadway', 'are', 'made', 'stories', 'was', 'more', 'perosnal', 'reason', 'see', 'show', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'East', 'Village', 'was', 'familiar', 'area', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'worked', 'there', 'several', 'reasons', 'was', 'disappointed', 'show', 'loved', 'music', 'purchased', 'album', 'Then', 'read', 'movie', 'based', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'when', 'saw', 'trailers', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'seriously', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'capture', 'essence', 'Manhattan', 'high', 'energy', 'performers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wonder', 'long', 'first', 'scene', '8', 'principal', 'actos', 'standing', 'stage', 'singing', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'knew', 'was', 'movie', 'treat', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'loved', 'plan', 'purchase', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again.Based', 'opera', 'La', 'Boheme', 'Rent', 'story', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'living', 'loving', 'dying', 'area', 'Manhattan', 'called', 'East', 'Village', 'Known', 'hub', '60', 'movement', '40', 'odd', 'years', 'ago', 'recent', 'years', 'area', 'became', 'known', 'squatters', 'disenchanted', 'young', 'adults', 'familiar', 'area', 'movie', 'had', 'energy', 'part', 'Manhattan', 'lives', 'who', 'live', 'there.Focusing', '8', 'individuals', 'included', 'Angel', 'drag', 'queen', 'AIDS', 'lover', 'Tom', 'Maureen', 'performance', 'artist', 'finally', 'Marc', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'end', 'captured', 'story', 'times', 'show', 'was', 'loud', 'times', 'felt', 'performers', 'were', 'shouting', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'allowed', 'listener', 'make', 'sense', 'words', 'actors', 'most', 'Broadwayshow', 'were', 'excellent', 'exception', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Chicago', 'rare', 'think', 'movie', 'based', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'better', 'case', 'movie', 'Rent', 'loved', 'minute', 'movie', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'end', 'music', 'so', 'poignant', 'play', 'head', 'am', 'sure', 'late', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'must', 'be', 'smiling', 'down', 'heaven', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'subject', 'matter', 'difficult', 'times', 'very', 'least', 'gripping', 'poignant', 'suggest', 'movie', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

However, it was good enough live for me to give the movie a look.Based loosely on Puccini's La Boh&egrave;me, Rent is a rock opera that focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village who live lives full of art, music, sex, and drugs. The show particularly spotlights the AIDS crisis and how it affects the characters. For the most part, the show made the stage to screen transition well. There were a few awkward moments with characters basically looking at each other and singing - moments that didn't seem to be supported by any subtextual motivations. And the film did allow for flashbacks and other backstory devices that aren't possible on stage. I'm aware that most of the cast members were plucked from the Broadway cast, and they were all really strong. Rosario Dawson, who was new to the effort, did a wonderful job as well.For the most part, I thought this film was a good treatment of the stage show. The director clearly has a great love for the material, and I also got the feeling that the performers really understood the thematic message of the show. The movie (and the stage play) does contain some sensitive material, but nothing that couldn't inspire productive discussion.

966475,A232JQR4NBH9SX,B000E1YVZU,Nikola,"[2, 2]","It was obvious after ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" that the genre of movie musical was experiencing a renaissance of some kind. This paved the way for many projects to arrive from Broadway to the big screen, but there is always one significant problem - who is the target audience? More so, are the consumer generations of the 21st century ready to buy in to singing and dancing when telling a story? God forbid a movie doesn't have a plot or a point; it is automatically labeled with the words ""tedious"", ""boring"" and the pejorative ""artistic"".So, here comes ""RENT"". It is exactly a musical studios would be frightened to invest in. The very slim plot is simply an excuse to present a generation of artists, some of them gay, lesbian or transgendered, and their bohemian lifestyle. As they fight AIDS, hold protests and revolutionize against selling out, you are expected to believe that they simply often burst into song when you least expect it and don't give a damn that the things they talk about may be considered controversial, sinful or wrong (especially since they perform these songs boldly, unlike the very stylized approaches of ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Chicago""). I am glad to say that, despite all this, the movie miraculously works on its every level.The characters of ""RENT"" are based on real people and their experiences in the impoverished East Village, New York City. Among them is Roger, an HIV-infected ex-junkie musician who is liked by Mimi, a 19-year-old stripper junkie. Roger shares his flat with Mark, who is a film-maker looking for the way ""to express, to communicate"" which becomes particularly hard when his girlfriend Maureen dumps him for another girl, the wealthy Joanne. Add in a philosophy teacher who can't find meaning in life until he meets Angel, a man in drag, and you have a huge spectrum of characters, which can sometimes present an obstacle in some movies. The strength of ""RENT"" is that it treats all these characters as one, combining their different characteristics into one sample of the New York Bohemia.Another fantastic aspect of the musical is its music - literally every number is a showstopper, from the emotional ""Seasons of Love"" and ""I'll Cover You"" to the rockin' ""Rent"" and ""What You Own"". ""La Vie Boheme"" is a challenge of a song, since it contains more than twenty references, and it is fun to research them and trace the influences these people grew up with - Maya Angelou, The Sex Pistols, Michael Cunningham, just to name a few. Another fun sequence is ""Out Tonight"" which celebrates being young and having fun, but then subtly fades into ""Another Day"", which explains the philosophy of living in the moment and enjoying every day like it's the last.""RENT"" never fails. Despite some slight misjudgments and some slower pace at times, it is always strong, bold and delivers its message. It is also never pretentious, because even if you have never lived this kind of life, it is inviting and seductive. More than anything, ""RENT"" is playful, and that is its sexiness - recognizing and understanding the philosophy of ""no day but today"".",5,Viva La Vie Boheme!,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,3093,"['was', 'obvious', 'Chicago', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'genre', 'movie', 'musical', 'was', 'experiencing', 'renaissance', 'kind', 'paved', 'way', 'many', 'projects', 'arrive', 'Broadway', 'big', 'screen', 'always', 'one', 'significant', 'problem', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'More', 'so', 'are', 'consumer', 'generations', '21st', 'century', 'ready', 'buy', 'singing', 'dancing', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'God', 'forbid', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'point', 'automatically', 'labeled', 'words', 'tedious', 'boring', 'pejorative', 'artistic', '.So', 'here', 'RENT', 'exactly', 'musical', 'studios', 'would', 'be', 'frightened', 'invest', 'very', 'slim', 'plot', 'simply', 'excuse', 'present', 'generation', 'artists', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'transgendered', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'fight', 'AIDS', 'hold', 'protests', 'revolutionize', 'selling', 'out', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'simply', 'often', 'song', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'things', 'talk', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'controversial', 'sinful', 'wrong', 'especially', 'perform', 'songs', 'boldly', 'very', 'stylized', 'approaches', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'movie', 'miraculously', 'level.The', 'characters', 'RENT', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'experiences', 'impoverished', 'East', 'Village', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Roger', 'HIV-infected', 'ex-junkie', 'musician', 'who', 'liked', 'Mimi', '19-year-old', 'stripper', 'junkie', 'Roger', 'shares', 'flat', 'Mark', 'who', 'film-maker', 'looking', 'way', 'express', 'communicate', 'particularly', 'hard', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Maureen', 'girl', 'wealthy', 'Joanne', 'Add', 'philosophy', 'teacher', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'Angel', 'man', 'drag', 'have', 'huge', 'spectrum', 'characters', 'can', 'sometimes', 'present', 'obstacle', 'movies', 'strength', 'RENT', 'characters', 'one', 'combining', 'different', 'characteristics', 'one', 'sample', 'New', 'York', 'Bohemia.Another', 'fantastic', 'aspect', 'musical', 'music', 'literally', 'number', 'showstopper', 'emotional', 'Seasons', 'Love', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'rockin', 'Rent', 'What', 'Own', 'La', 'Vie', 'Boheme', 'challenge', 'song', 'more', 'twenty', 'references', 'fun', 'research', 'trace', 'influences', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'fun', 'sequence', 'Out', 'Tonight', 'being', 'young', 'having', 'fun', 'then', 'subtly', 'Day', 'philosophy', 'living', 'moment', 'enjoying', 'day', 'last', 'RENT', 'never', 'slight', 'misjudgments', 'slower', 'pace', 'times', 'always', 'strong', 'bold', 'message', 'also', 'never', 'pretentious', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'lived', 'kind', 'life', 'inviting', 'seductive', 'More', 'anything', 'RENT', 'playful', 'sexiness', 'recognizing', 'understanding', 'philosophy', 'day', 'today']",N/A

I guess the highest praise I can give it is, this is the best contemporary musical I've seen in YEARS.My first introduction to RENT was by way of--of all things--Late Night with David Letterman, when he had the original cast on the show to perform (I think) ""La Vie Boheme."" I remember the energetic singing, the vivacious dancing on the table, the THUNDEROUS applause they received at song's end...and thinking, ""Man, this is one musical I have to see."" I'm just sorry it took me this long to finally see it, considering it's been to Kansas City with touring companies a few times. Now that I've seen the movie and loved it, I can only hope it comes here again, and soon.All this being said, I can only agree with the multitudes who've already reviewed RENT. The cast is outstanding. The songs--of which I loved every one--just knocked me out. (The rock songs almost sound like Springsteen could have written them, they're THAT good.) There are moments in the movie when you'll want to stand up and cheer, and moments that will bring tears to your eyes. I can't recommend this highly enough...IMHO, it runs rings around musicals like Chorus Line, Cats, or Chicago. If you haven't seen it yet, treat yourself and do so ASAP.

966478,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000E1YVZU,Olukayode Balogun,"[2, 2]","So what's the story?This is a musical (or ""rock opera"" to use the correct technical term) set in New York City about a group of East Village young people caught up between their grasping landlord on the one hand, and poverty, illness and pre-combination therapy AIDS on the other. It's based on Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical, apparently one of the longest running shows on Broadway.Sounds all doom and gloom. Does it work as a musical?Rock opera, rock opera. And yes. This movie is all about celebrating life and all the possibilities it offers. It's about fighting for success and acceptance. The realities of illness and death are acknowledged but this is no mournful tale.But still. A rock opera? You?(Laugh) Yes, it's true I've never been one for musicals - or, shall we say, movies with singing and dancing in them. ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Fame"" are about all I can handle. I hated ""Grease"", I fell asleep ten minutes into ""West Side Story"", ""Evita"" went completely over my head and ""Moulin Rouge"" just gave me a headache. But I was determined to watch this one and I was determined to own a copy on DVD, primarily because of the issues it deals with. But there was also the fact that I'd heard the wonderful Jesse L. Martin was in it. I'm a huge fan and I'd only ever seen him on TV - first of all in that silly Ally McBeal's love interest and more recently as Detective Eddie Green on ""Law & Order"". The prospect of seeing him singing and dancing (which he does in this movie, and very well, it has to be said), to me was worth the price of the DVD all on its own. He was acting a gay character too, which only added to my excitement but there were no love scenes, sadly. There was kissing though...But, seriously and all superficial stuff aside, this is a great spectacle of drama, song and dance. Jesse L. Martin is not the only star here of course and he is supported (in my eyes anyway) by a great cast, including the ever-beautiful Rosario Dawson, ever-handsome (but always one dimensional) Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp and Tracie Thomas. Everyone gave great performances and you just HAVE to see the diner scene!But is it something that will stand up to repeated watching?I think so. For me anyway. On one of those days (which always come around) when I'm feeling low and need some life affirmation, I can think of no better DVD to put on. I'm glad I bought it.What about DVD Extras?Well, this 2-disc special edition has loads of extras, including commentary by director Chris Columbus and selected cast, a feature-length documentary called ""No Day But Today"", deleted scenes and musical performances and PSAs for Jonathan Larson's Performing Arts Foundation and the National Marfan Foundation.So well worth getting then?Absolutely. The only reason I didn't give it a five star recommendation is that I didn't really like that many of the songs. But for something to watch and get into, I think it's great.

I looove RENT so much, it's a wonderful message, really heartfelt and it hits close to home. A story of friends living the bohemian life in NYC circa 1989-1990 and most everyone in the clan has AIDS. Amazingly, now that I think back (and watch it again), the only real bit of comic relief that I can remember is Mark and Roger's answering machine's repetitive-ness: SPEEEEAAK gets me every time. :) At first when I went to see it, I didn't think I would like the movie very much, it looked too into the rock-music for me to enjoy. But I was (obviously and thankfully) mistaken. The music was wonderful and the parts were played by the seasoned Broadway actors who originated them (except Mimi/Dawson and Joanne/Thoms). Everyone's performances were the most believable that I have ever seen, probably because they've been so comfortable in them for so many years. I surprised myself as I felt tears running down my face at the end; I didn't think it had had that big of an impact on me. Wrong again.The few things I warn about: make sure whoever is seeing this movie is... mature. There are a gay couple and a lesbian couple, a few F-bombs and someone gets mooned. Not too bad, you get used to the couples after seeing them long enough, and the F-bomb is... twice, in the same song. That's about it, I hope you enjoy it.

But in spite of the sadness and drama that surrounds the content of ""Rent,"" it was mostly fun and some of it almost intentionally camp.  So the film comes along, being as faithful as it can, removing some of the long windedness of some numbers and characters, but also robbing ""Rent"" of some of its fun, but it still mostly works.The opening of the film is fantastic.  It ALMOST feels like they got the tone down and it looks like one of those classic openings to old musicals - lots of characters, big, flashy and very much in the spirit of the play.  The title number is trimmed, removing some of Joanne's banter and Benjamin's dialgoue.  It's a nice trim an arguable improvement.  It looks like Chris Columbus got this down initially.  And for the first part, the film flows pretty well - acting, music, pacing, fine.It isn't until the arrival of Maureen that something doesn't seem right.  ""Rent"" was a piece carved for the stage and Jonathon Larson crafted some neat scenes for it.  The one that always stuck out was ""Christmas Bells,"" not only because to me, it's an important motif, but also because it really captured the grand thing ""Rent"" was, featuring alot of good character interplay and building up to the arrival of Maureen.  The way its dones on stage wouldn't carry well to the screen.  So Chris Columbus just kind of skips it, jumping to Maureens stage performance and to La Vie Boheme.  It was always a good piece in the stage play and it feels like there's a gap here in the film.Act 2 seems a little sloppy, probably because of the staginess of so many scenes.  While the narrative remains effective and in tact, Columbus seems unsure how to do something with ""What You Own"" and creates soemthing that resembles an early 90s music video that's almost painful to watch.  Other than that, the second act works on screen, though it's not as well paced as the first part, or the play.If I have any complaints, they mostly lie in the fact that ""Rent"" doesn't have as much fun as it should.  Yes, it's got serious subject matter, but it's loads of fun and celebration - and celebration was always key for Rent.  I feel like Columbus mourns the story a bit more.  Again, this could just be becaus of how the material transitions to screen.Overall, Rent the  movie is good.  Just try not to compare it to the stage version.  If you want to see a good theatrical performance, check out the DVD of the last show.

966491,A39W3263A9HCMN,B000E1YVZU,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[3, 7]","Before I get to the review, confession time. Even as a theater extremist, I never liked Rent. OK people, go on and eviscerate me.Why did I never like it? Maybe if I was born in the eighties or if I lived in New York, I'd like it. There were a few moments of brilliance in the show, and some catchy songs, but none of the positives ever added up really. It's really dated and cheesy, it's WAY too long, in fact I've had to scoff at a lot of my friends (as of recently) who worship it because of how dated, cheesy and laughable it is. Especially since I saw it for the first time on stage in 2009 and enjoyed the actors' performances but absolutely hated it. Even moreso, its cheesy lyrics prevent me from enjoyment, and half the songs are half-arsed copy and paste jobs. One particularly crowning moment of cringe worthy is ""Will I?"". Ugh, I had to sing that for a showcase and dreaded every second of it each night. ""Will I lose my diiiignityyy, will someone caaaare, will I wake tooomoroow[...] FROM!!! THIS!!! NIGHT!!! MAAAAAARE!!!!"" as if the lyrics weren't bad enough, it gets repeated what feels like 250 times. The worst part is when the song becomes an incomprehensible mishmash at the end with 20 different people singing at different times to the point where it sounds like ""Will someone care?"" is repeated over and over. I most certainly WON'T care, and I would if the characters didn't feel like stereotypes, cardboard cutouts and had any depth other than ""She's her lover/he's a drag queen/he's making a movie about their lifestyle/etc."" So as you could tell, there was no way I could imagine any of those craptacular songs or dated story translating to film.A few nights ago this was on TV, starting at 10. That, with commercials, resulted in me staying up till 1 to watch a terrible movie based on a really crappy musical. However curiosity bit me in the ass and so I gave in and watched this film.The good thing about this movie is that it's a terrible adaptation of the play. A lot of fanboys/girls have gotten angry over this but I was quite happy- at least half those craptacular songs were out of the question and songs were turned into dialogue to avoid me smashing my head against the nearest sharp object. Add to that some GREAT cinematography and visual brilliance. I liked the look of the film- fit the bohemian mood great. The cast wasn't that bad, some of them surprised me- specifically Maureen. She made me like ""Over The Moon"" actually. So in a way this film is better than the play but that's not saying much.The songs somehow sound even more emo than the play- and mind-bendingly so. That, of course, is the result of a film exposing a play for how truly bad it is, showing the songs' true form. So that means ""Out Tonight"", ""Will I"", ""I Should Tell You"", and ""Light My Candle"" are more whiny, cheesy, and annoying than the stage play. And of course, the film drones on and on for too long, just like the play, but thankfully it's shorter. Were this film a minute longer I'd cry.I'll go out on a limb and also state how I can't understand how the whole concept of ""Rent"" IN GENERAL has a huge fanbase. Am I gay? No. Do I enjoy watching stuff about AIDS? It depends on if its done tastefully. Maybe if I were in the gay crowd I'd be worshipping it just as much as everyone and their dog. No wait- even if I were gay I'd still hate its guts- Hell I even know gay people who hate Rent. I'll also go out on a limb and state I'll never, repeat, NEVER understand how teenagers adore it so much. As an adult, I find it so laughably dated and cheesy. I'll admit I wasn't born in the eighties, so maybe that's why I don't get some of the references. And yet people as young as 9 (bad parenting much? This film, here in Canada is rated PG, and in USA PG-13. I wouldn't recommend the play to anyone under 15 at all due to its content!) worship it! When I saw the stage production some time ago, a member of the cast stated on how difficult it was- for him as a straight man- to be able to pull off the role of a gay dude and make a man-to-man kiss look natural. Being an actor myself I know how difficult it is. Coincidentally that very person was one of my closest friends, whom I had seen the play for specifically (to be fair though, he did great for what he had to work with, so I'll give him that.). Honestly, even with its popularity among the LGBT community and what not, I fail to see the appeal of the show.In short, this film is a 135 minute exercise in idiocy, but hey, at least it's keeping true to the true nature of the show. I go see a play like The Gershwins' Crazy For You or Kotis' Urinetown and am immediately transported to the locations those shows take place in (The setting of Deadrock, Nevada is one of the most fun settings for a show ever). I go see Rent and am transported to the top floor of a 40 story office building. This gets an extra star just for managing to cleverly depict the idiocy of the show on film.

There was so much hype surrounding the play at the time that a let down (considering my expectations) was, perhaps, inevitable.  Still, I liked many of the musical numbers and that prompted me to buy the soundtrack.  And that is where I fully appreciated what Jonathan Larson had created.Flash forward several years later and I still listened to the original Broadway soundtrack when I heard that a RENT movie was finally going to happen.  I thought the trailer was great, giving you a real sense of what was at the heart of the movie: love and friendship.I love the movie.  It was great of Chris Columbus to utilize so many of the original Broadway cast members.  The musical numbers, I thought, were crisper and tighter: edgier, if you will, than on the stage.  I actually find myself preferring many of the film's song versions than the Broadway versions.  I do prefer the original Mimi's voice, Daphne Rubin-Vega, but Rosario Dawson is still great.  Whoduthunk?Chris Columbus' use of flashbacks to show the Roger-April relationship was a nice touch and it was sad (in a good way) to see Angel slowly slip away to AIDS - something you didn't get in the stage version.It's a long movie, but so is the play.  With the magic of DVD it's great that we still get to see some original numbers such as ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye Love"" which were cut from the movie.  I still think ""Goodbye Love"" should have been included in the film's final cut.The documentary on Jonathan Larson was really great, thorough and informative.  It's wonderful to see how his parents carried the torch for him after his untimely passing. And the director's commentary with Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal was fun (who'd have thought that Taye Diggs performance during the funeral scene was so bad it had to be cut?).Gripes?  Not many.  I wish the trailers would have been included in the extras.  Also, it would have been fun to hear from more of the cast in the commentary.During the commentary, Chris Columbus also mentioned several scenes that were filmed, including, for example, April's suicide scene.  If they were going to be cut from the movie, they should have at least shown up as deleted scenes.  It also would have been nice to include the video diaries that were on-line during the making of the movie on the DVD as Peter Jackson is doing for KING KONG.At the end of the day, RENT, the movie, is a great final tribute to the play that shook Broadway to its core.

I distinctly remember sitting in the theatre and thinking Act I was great and Act II was spectacular.  I couldn't wait to see a filmed version of this groundbreaking work.Well, what a HUGE disappointment.  The film rendition of Johnathan Larson's play was an anachronistic mess that at times seemed so syrupy sweet I thought I'd need a massive dose of insulin!  It also felt oddly outdated, as if it was made 15 years too late.  And, the oddest and most inexplicable thing of all is that some actors who appeared in both the stage and filmed versions of the work seemed miscast in the film, creating major credibility problems!  They actually made me feel uneasy because their characters had a comical edge that was definitely not intended.  This was an odd phenomenon that led me to believe the problem with the film was its director.  Chris Columbus, the captain of this sinking ship,  was completely out of his league - he just didn't have the chops to give it the edginess or urgency that it deserved, and that really came through on stage.  I am not of the school of thought that stage plays never translate well to film - just look at  DEATH OF A SALESMAN, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE or musicals like WEST SIDE STORY, DAMN YANKEES, or BYE BYE BIRDIE.  And one of my favorite musicals of all time did not originate as a stage play and was considered a brilliant example of the French New Wave -  a work called THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG -  that proved musicals could be intensely powerful.  RENT, however, simply missed the mark.  It was disjointed, unbearably long, way too politically correct and terribly dull.  And I could swear Chris Columbus added material to the film not present in the original stage production that further weakened the potency of its story.  So, in summation, this was an extremely unflattering filmed translation of an otherwise powerful statement on a particularly dark period in our history.  Too bad...

People responsible for those adaptations were so blinded by a chance of their picture making money that they consequently forgot to craft a product which actually WOULD make money.Fortunately, Christopher Columbus remembered when adapting Jonathan Larsen's 1996 hit musical RENT. Chronicling `a year in the life' of New York bohemians, RENT has previously been described as my generation's HAIR.This musical-film also deals with angst, love, tragedy, paired with lots of sociopolitical commentary. A group of artists' wrestles with AIDS, activism, personal addictions, and the politics of a former friend/roommate who wants to gentrify the area after he wed the landlord's daughter. He is now the elitist which he had once railed against---and the others are still fighting.I was ecstatic when I found out that my favorite musical was being adapted by the movies; then grew skeptical about the potential product's quality. I am elated to confirm that RENT is not among the `motion picture adaptation' causalities. It should become a `textbook example' of how GREAT movie adaptations are made.Most of the original (as in THE ORIGIAL) Broadway cast reprised roles for the movie. Because these actors had already invested so much time into the parts, they naturally wanted to do a good job on screen. I never got the impression they were calling in the lines, and therefore was genuinely sad when the movie ended----only because the picture was now over. I hadn't gotten that involved into a movie since I was a little kid.I particularly liked Anthony Rapp (Mark)'s acting and think that the character whom I act the most like is Maureen (Idina Menzel), the angry young activist lover of Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms).I (of course!) knew ALL of RENT's musical numbers by heart before going into the movie theater, but finally seeing it on-screen and generally unaltered was a delightful experience. Absence of the `message machine' breaks in this movie genuinely did not bother me. This screenplay did not attempt to add anything into the characters as `compensation' for theater modifications and therefore prevented its own candle from going out.In another plus, it eschewed recent ""sitcom-Disneyfied"" portrayals of New York City to instead pointedly acknowledge cities as places where people are deal with life and death issues.",5,How we gonna pay...to repeatedly see an awesome movie?,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,2435,"['Most', 'recent', 'movie', 'remakes', 'were', 'horrible', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'indescribably', 'horrible', 'Bewitched', 'People', 'responsible', 'adaptations', 'were', 'so', 'blinded', 'chance', 'picture', 'making', 'money', 'consequently', 'forgot', 'craft', 'product', 'actually', 'WOULD', 'make', 'money.Fortunately', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'remembered', 'when', 'adapting', 'Jonathan', 'Larsen', '1996', 'hit', 'musical', 'RENT', 'Chronicling', 'year', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'bohemians', 'RENT', 'previously', 'been', 'described', 'generation', 'HAIR.This', 'musical-film', 'also', 'angst', 'love', 'tragedy', 'paired', 'lots', 'sociopolitical', 'commentary', 'group', 'artists', 'wrestles', 'AIDS', 'activism', 'personal', 'addictions', 'politics', 'former', 'friend/roommate', 'who', 'gentrify', 'area', 'wed', 'landlord', 'daughter', 'now', 'elitist', 'had', 'once', 'railed', '-and', 'others', 'are', 'still', 'fighting.I', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'favorite', 'musical', 'was', 'being', 'adapted', 'movies', 'then', 'grew', 'skeptical', 'potential', 'product', 'quality', 'am', 'elated', 'confirm', 'RENT', 'not', 'motion', 'picture', 'adaptation', 'causalities', 'should', 'become', 'textbook', 'example', 'how', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'are', 'made.Most', 'original', 'THE', 'ORIGIAL', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'reprised', 'roles', 'movie', 'actors', 'had', 'already', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'parts', 'naturally', 'wanted', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'screen', 'never', 'got', 'impression', 'were', 'calling', 'lines', 'therefore', 'was', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'only', 'picture', 'was', 'now', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'involved', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'kid.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Mark', 'acting', 'think', 'character', 'whom', 'act', 'most', 'like', 'Maureen', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'angry', 'young', 'activist', 'lover', 'Joanne', 'Jefferson', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', '.I', 'course', 'knew', 'ALL', 'RENT', 'musical', 'numbers', 'heart', 'going', 'movie', 'theater', 'finally', 'seeing', 'on-screen', 'generally', 'unaltered', 'was', 'delightful', 'experience', 'Absence', 'message', 'machine', 'breaks', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'screenplay', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'add', 'anything', 'characters', 'compensation', 'theater', 'modifications', 'therefore', 'prevented', 'own', 'candle', 'going', 'plus', 'eschewed', 'recent', 'sitcom-Disneyfied', 'portrayals', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'instead', 'pointedly', 'acknowledge', 'cities', 'places', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'deal', 'life', 'death', 'issues']",N/A

966498,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000E1YVZU,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 13]","In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - ""Rent"" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like ""Phantom of the Opera,"" which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like ""Rent,"" which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers ""Rent"" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, ""Rent"" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.The story, a modern day update of ""La Boheme"" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them ""deadbeats"") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.""Rent"" - with its noble ""performance artists"" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as nave, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical ""Angel"") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded ""job"" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.  In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of ""the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation"" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for ""Rent"" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially ""sensitive"" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free.",2,the squatter as hero,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,5141,"['terms', 'format', 'style', 'superficially',

It is great on stage but loses some of the best stuff on the big screen. Most of the music was cut out of the movie, and even 2/3 of the emotional overload ""Goodbye Love"". But it could have been much, much worse.Many people would have felt that Spike Lee would have made a more adequet director than Chris Columbus. I don't really think that is true. Chris Columbus tried his best and pushed the cast beyond their limits, if you noticed in the film there are significant parts where there is no cut for a very long time. I personally think that Spike Lee would have been a horrible director. He wanted to cast Justin Timberlake as Roger!! That would ruin everything for me and many other RENTheads. If anything Chris Columbus did the film and the characters some justice the only way that he could, by getting the original cast members.The cast still has some of its old groove. Although older there a little wiser and have better voices. Adam Pascal can still send shivers down the spine. And although that Daphne Rubin-Vega had a little rasp in her voice, I still miss it over Rosario Dawson's. And as much I hate to admit it but the addition of Tracie Thoms was a better choice then Fredi Walker, the original Joanne (hear that high note!)As a musician myself the songs are amazing and intricate, and hold a lot of meaning.Although the movie was really good, it was missing some key things that it good, and how i feel in love with it in the first place.

Welch ""Browngerl""","[2, 2]","I've always wanted to see RENT, although I was just a lowly teenager when it first appeared on Broadway, so I didn't give it a second thought. I really just liked to see the commercial. Friends holding arm-in-arm, walking down the street, singing a song with lyrics I could barely make out.Whatever. I saw Rent the movie for the first time 2 days ago. I LOVED it. Although it was supposed to be set in NY, 1989-1990, and battled topics that I have virtually no familiarity with - it's like I could feel everything was happening to the characters. That's when I know I've connected physically with a movie. Granted, I have no non-internet knowledge of RENT, the Broadway Musical, I still hope to see it one day and figure that if it's as good as the film, I'll be blown away. Permanently.I connected with all of the characters and their struggles, although I didn't at first. I still feel that Benny, played by Tate Digg's role in the movie is insignificant, and I couldn't figure out Mark's role/issues in the whole thing. Apparently, this is explained more in depth in the play, and in the extended version of ""Goodbye Love"". The film is not a goody-goody comical version of something deep and dark like ""Chicago"" was. It presents issues and deals with them in a subtle way. And yes, with a soundtrack and a montage of scenes that are both refreshing AND depressing. One scene that is especially sad is the one at the Life Support group(for those with AIDS) that goes with the song ""Will I?""""Will I lose my dignity,Will someone careWill I wake tomorrow,From this nightmare?""Haunting.I thought Rosario Dawson did a very good job in the role of Mimi. Her voice isn't exceptionally strong, and listening to ""Out Tonight"" (one of my favorite tracks) on my Ipod, I could hear the guitar chords overpowering her voice. Other than that, I felt she did fine. One overall theme of the movie was centered on the recurring lyrics of ""No Day But Today"". As 4 out of the 8 main characters have AIDS, it's befitting that they live their life to the fullest.I don't feel complled to comment any further, 'cept to say that you can't please everyone. There are people who like the play, but don't like the film. Then others that like the film, but don't like to play.

So i expected Mimi [Rosario Dawson, sparkling in her role as a heroin addict] to die in Roger's [Adam Pascal, also brilliant as the AIDS-infected songwriter who can't get a song together] arms.  & the very beginning, w/the actors all singing ""Seasons of Love"" on a bare, brilliantly-lit stage, prepares 1 to distance 1self.

He's a show all by himself as the sassy drag queen who befriends Tom Collins [Jesse L.

966505,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000E1YVZU,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 8]","""Rent"" is art triumphing over reason, aided by extremely catchy music. It's cute despite its relative absurdity, which is heightened on a movie screen, a canvas easier to scrutinize than a stage, where the musical ""Rent"" has enjoyed an extraordinary run on Broadway.Employing all the songs from Johnathan Larson's original production - based on the opera ""La Boheme"" - and using six of the original cast members, ""Rent"" tells the tale of seven New Yorkers living in and around Alphabet City amidst art, drugs and AIDS. Set in 1989, the friends are rallying against landlord Benny (Taye Diggs) and his attempt to close down their rent-free tenement and reopen it as some kind of cyberstudio. Benny would like to employ his old roommates, filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) and musician Roger (Adam Pascal), to stop a protest by performance artist Maureen (Idina Metzel), who dumped Mark for uptown lawyer Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is a club dancer with her eye on Roger, while Tom (Jesse L. Martin) is another friend mugged in the street and nursed back to health by a street drummer/queen named Angel (Jermaine Wilson Heredia). Both have AIDS, as do Roger and Mimi.Director Chris Columbus opens up the musical by staging certain numbers at various New York landmarks - the subway, Central Park - and creating an elaborate set for Maureen's performance. Music comprises 90 percent of the film, the better to gloss over a gossamer story that requires the characters to fall immediately, joyously in love and use Benny as a convenient villain who emerges more as a prompt for conflict or song - it's his words that touch off ""La Vie Boheme"" - than a character.Metzel, in the smallest of the main roles as Maureen, is shrill, flirty, funny and generally excellent, willing to give her character a shade of selfish, and Rapp turns in a old-school showman's performance, all passion and gesticulation; it reminded me of Sam Rockwell's work in ""Confessions of Dangerous Mind."" The other cast members are suffering saints, led by Mimi, played by Dawson as a dangerous-but-sweet minx. ""Rent"" assaults Roger from all angles to date this dying heroin addict half his age who's been on the street since she was 17 and used to date Benny. Think about that for a minute.Or don't. Roger and Mimi's courtship does, after all, include two of the best songs, ""Light My Candle"" and ""Another Day,"" the end of which is the first full belting of the mantra of ""Rent,"" ""no day but today."" The idea: Live solely in the moment, loving those you're with, making friends and art  your family. While it's more of a defensive, desperate life philosophy than I think anybody should live by, the characters believe it and are eventually rewarded by it. Thoms, as Joanne, probably has the best, full-bodied voice; Dawson has the weakest, but also the easiest on the ears. They might have affected Rentheads another way, but Tom and Angel seemed to me disposable; their relationship is goofy, slight and coy. Angel is meant to be an emotional anchor, but he comes off as a plucky sidekick.",3,Plot?

966506,ACTYP447JCDX0,B000E1YVZU,Scott Bresinger,"[23, 43]","Okay, full confession up front: I have never seen the Broadway musical on which this film is based, but I have walked by the Nederlander theatre where it plays and seen the lobby tricked out like some Epcot Center approximation of the ""actual"" Lower East Side of Manhattan, where both play and film are supposed to be set.  I have, however, seen well north of a thousand films, including more than a few musicals, some of which I actually enjoyed, so I do think I can give ""Rent,"" the movie, a fair shake as a reviewer.  That said, what I did see was a phony and hollow co-opting the very counterculture that ""Rent"" pretends to celebrate.Just as ""Hair"" (play & film) was a vision of what total squares saw of the 60's counterculture, ""Rent"" updates that vision to 1989, where there was indeed a thriving artistic community in the Lower East Side, one that even produced some interesting results.  Of course, ""Rent"" is also a (very) loose adaptation of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"" (if Puccini were alive today he would roll over in his grave--LOL) so composer Jonathen Larsen had no responsibility to get his setting just right.  That he managed to get so much so wrong is another matter.  Or should I say sanitized?  Or cartoon-ified, if that makes any sense.  The songs and music, which have been hailed as the closest the American theatre has ever come to actual rock music, turns out to be mainly sappy power ballads ready-made for a particularly ""rebellious"" American Idol contestant.  One song that attempts to be what I think was indended as rap is so embarrassing that even Vanilla Ice seems hardcore by comparison.  The clothes the characters wear are the types of outfits that would get them laughed at by even  the leather/safety pin/mohawk trust fund punks who beg for change on St. Marks Place.  Okay, in one scene Idina Menzel's Maureen does a bit of ""performance art"" that's every bit as excruciating (albeit PG-13 sanitized) as the real thing.  Problem is, I think it wasn't intended to seem that way! It should also be noted that most of the cast, who originated their roles in the musical's first run, now seem way too old for their characters, and the effect is more midlife crisis than downtown cool.In the showstopping set piece anthem ""La Vie Boheme"" the thinly drawn characters dance around a faux-authentic Lower East Side pub and name check edgy artists that range from Alan Ginsberg and John Cage to Susan Sontag and The Sex Pistols.  needless to say, a movie shepherded by ""Home Alone""/""Harry Potter"" helmer Chris Columbus is about as ""edgy"" as a nerf ball.  ""Rent"" tries to sell us prepackaged rebellion as just a bunch of lovable eccentrics (with few eccentricities to speak of) and doomed romantics, most of whom, we are to believe suffer from (oh excuse me--are ""surviving with"") AIDS.  In this movie, the worst symptom of the disease is apparently to look kind of run-down and tired, but not too tired to belt out a heart-tugging ballad or two.  This watering-down of a very real pandemic is more offensive than any of the supposedely ""shocking"" behavior any of our Bohemian heroes are supposed to delight in.  Frankly, I couldn't stop thinking of the skewering ""Rent"" took in the film ""Team America: World Police""--""Everyone has AIDS!""  Indeed.I will grant that there are a couple of effective numbers that recall--I believe on purpose--Brecht and Weill, and as a whole the cast has energy to spare and obviously have learned from experience to play off each other very well.  I also dug the cameo by Sarah Silverman as an oily TV executive, but then I'm a sucker for Ms. Silverman in general.  A few bright spots, however, cannot rescue this muddled morass of mediocrity.  Since I've been prattling on now for what seems like 525,600 minutes, if you still think you really have to see this, the title suggests how you should go about it.

Yes, some of the shorter songs (voicemails, etc) have now become spoken dialogue--but the changes are all necessary when you go to the medium of film.I think Chris Columbus did a great job, and clearly wanted to celebrate and honor Larson's vision--the man even sought out the original cast (Daphne was pregnant at the time of filming so she couldn't play Mimi, and Fredi Walker thought she was too old to play Joanne) in order to accomplish that goal.Perhaps the studio's error was in cleaning up the sound. The show was such a success because it was so raw and at times unpolished, maybe that's where the film sort of fails--the music is too polished, too clean. Mimi doesn't sound as wild and as desperate to live her life now because she knows death is knocking at her door. (Not knocking Rosario's Mimi, I loved her), Roger isn't as angry, as volatile.With that said, the film was my introduction to RENT and holds a special place in my heart.

966514,ASJQPZSBCWSF,B000E1YVZU,"S.R.W. Phillips ""StevieRae5""","[4, 5]","I absolutely adored this movie, which I saw on opening night. I have always wanted to see the musical on Broadway, and still plan to as soon as possible. Therefore, I have nothing (i.e. the stage version) to compare the movie to, so I can say that, as a stand-alone movie, it was great.  I thought that the acting was heartfelt, and I loved Rosario Dawson's voice, which I found surprisingly good and unique, as well as the level of vulnerability that she brought to the character of Mimi. When Roger tells her (in ""Light My Candle""), ""You look like you're sixteen,"" you find yourself agreeing with him. It breaks your heart that she looks--and is--so young and is living on her own in the city, addicted to heroin and infected with HIV. I agree with another reviewer--she seems as though she's trying to convince everyone that she's ""born to be bad"" (""Light My Candle""), but I'm just not buying it--not because of a problem with Dawson's acting, but because my take on the character is simply that she's a lost kid trying to figure out who she is.I thought all of the characters were endearing in their own special way, with the exception of Benny, who, another reviewer rightly pointed out, doesn't show up all that much. The songs were astounding, and I loved the way Larson made an effort to show love in all its varying forms (Angel and Collins, Mimi and Roger, Joanne and Maureen) without seeming too self-conscious of doing it.The only reason that I knocked the rating down to four stars is that there seem to be a lot of unresolved issues, perhaps that weren't left that way in the musical. My main beef is that the relationship (is that's what, in fact, it's supposed to be) between Mimi and Benny is a little fuzzy, and how it turns out is not explained. Since I have purchased the soundtrack and listened to ""Goodbye, Love,"" I feel I have a little more insight, but it doesn't seem like it is given the attention it needs. By throwing in a few lines or maybe one short scene, I think it would be a little more clear. I also had to dock it by one star because, in my opinion, the ending should have been done better. I'll try not to give anything away, but the big ""She is...NO, she's not! Let's all rejoice and sing!!!"" was a little disappointing. But the music is so fabulous and I became so invested in the characters that I will forgive those two flaws.I don't agree with the opinion that the movie came too late. As a matter of fact, at a time when new HIV infections among teenagers are on the rise, it seems like it's appearing at just the right time. And, of course, it premiered on Broadway, I believe, in 1996, so we can't forget that, either. Look how long it took Phantom to turn into a movie (which, I must say, I loved as well). It is timely and should be required viewing for teenagers. By putting faces and lives on the disease, it reaches you in a way that some people have (fortunately for them) never experienced, and I left the theater very moved.",4,Loved it!,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2977,"['absolutely', 'adored', 'movie', 'saw', 'opening', 'night', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'musical', 'Broadway', 'still', 'plan', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Therefore', 'have', 'nothing', 'i.e', 'stage', 'version', 'compare', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'that', 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'loved', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'voice', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'unique', 'as', 'well', 'level', 'vulnerability', 'brought', 'character', 'Mimi', 'When', 'Roger', 'Light', 'My', 'Candle', 'look', ""'re"", 'sixteen', 'find', 'agreeing', 'heart', 'so', 'young', 'living', 'own', 'city', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'infected', 'HIV', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'trying', 'convince', 'everyone', 'born', 'be', 'bad', 'Light', 'My', 'Candle', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'buying', 'not', 'problem', 'Dawson', 'acting', 'take', 'character', 'simply', 'lost', 'kid', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'is.I', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'endearing', 'own', 'special', 'way', 'exception', 'Benny', 'who', 'reviewer', 'rightly', 'pointed', 'out', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'much', 'songs', 'were', 'astounding', 'loved', 'way', 'Larson', 'made', 'effort', 'show', 'love', 'varying', 'forms', 'Angel', 'Collins', 'Mimi', 'Roger', 'Joanne', 'Maureen', 'seeming', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'doing', 'it.The', 'only', 'reason', 'knocked', 'rating', 'down', 'four', 'stars', 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'perhaps', 'were', ""n't"", 'left', 'way', 'musical', 'main', 'beef', 'relationship', 'what', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'Mimi', 'Benny', 'little', 'fuzzy', 'how', 'out', 'not', 'explained', 'have', 'purchased', 'soundtrack', 'listened', 'Goodbye', 'Love', 'feel', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'insight', ""n't"", 'seem', 'given', 'attention', 'throwing', 'few', 'lines', 'maybe', 'one', 'short', 'scene', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'clear', 'also', 'had', 'dock', 'one', 'star', 'opinion', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'big', 'NO', 'not', 'Let', 'rejoice', 'sing', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'music', 'so', 'fabulous', 'became', 'so', 'invested', 'characters', 'will', 'forgive', 'two', 'flaws.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'opinion', 'movie', 'came', 'too', 'late', 'matter', 'fact', 'time', 'when', 'new', 'HIV', 'infections', 'teenagers', 'are', 'rise', 'appearing', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'course', 'premiered', 'Broadway', 'believe', '1996', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Look', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'Phantom', 'turn', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'timely', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'teenagers', 'putting', 'disease', 'way', 'people', 'have', 'fortunately', 'never', 'experienced', 'left', 'theater', 'very', 'moved']",N/A

A top-notch cast. However, I wanted to point out how one song was kind of ruined for me. When Roger turns down Mimi's advances, it's not only because he's HIV+ and has been hurt by the death of his girlfriend. It's also because he's a recovering injection drug user, and he finds out Mimi is a user. That gives him a very good reason for not wanting to be involved with her! But the whole cast is singing ""No day but today"", urging him to not reject a chance at love (granted, they don't know she's a junkie). So the emotion of that song (which is kind of the theme song for the whole movie) for me is lost because it's a bunch of people urging their friend to get involved with a junkie.  It's supposed to be a celebratory, life-affirming, love-encouraging song. Also, I wanted to add that the 2nd disc that comes in this set is really great.

966516,AGMW3I34INNYG,B000E1YVZU,Stephen Cannon,"[6, 10]","Rent as it exists as a Broadway show is a unique product of a specific time and specific place, and most importantly it plays to a certain audience because of its cast of 'starving artists' characters.  Rent as a film is difficult to capture, as the original show had a very sparse production design and the story was carried on the raw energy of the eprformers on stage.  Loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera ""La Boheme,"" Rent tells the story of Mark, a filmmaker looking to make the next great film, and his roommate Roger, who is trying damn hard to write the next great song.  Their landlord and ex-roommate Benny, who has recently become wealthy, is threatening to evict them if they don't pay a year's worth of back rent.  Benny offers to cut the pair a break if they help stop Maureen, Mark's ex, from putting on a demonstration protesting one of Benny's real estate developments.  Mark refuses, maybe partly because he was dumped for na girl, JoAnn.  In all the hubbub, the power in their building goes out, and Mimi, a stripper and drug addict who lives downstairs, comes up to get a light for her candle, and falls for Roger.  Add to the mix Tom Collins (no, I'm serious) and his new love, a drag queen named Angel, and you have the comnplete ensemble.  Of these, Tom, Angel, Mimi, and Roger have AIDS or are HIV positive.On paper, this sounds a little hokey.  Keep in mind that the plot is still operatic, even if the music is rock/gospel/r&b.;  The cast, most of whom were the original broadway company, are all committed, and all turn out great performances, both acting and singing.  Much of the 'sung lines' from the show have been made into dialogue, but I feel that this is necessary for a film adaptation of such a show.  Most convincing are the opening ""Seasons of Love"" and ""The Tango Maureen.""  Some elements ahve been cut, some have been added, all for great effect.  This is not an amazing movie, but I think that this is the best possible film version of a show that is best seen live.

966517,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000E1YVZU,Steven Mason,"[0, 0]","I'm a huge fan of Rent; I think it's the best American musical ever made and it's up there with the best in the world. I was lucky to see the original production in New York, and I've seen many other excellent national stage productions. I've been waiting ten years for the movie. What I got was a Hollywood version that was hit and miss. It's another great musical, like Phantom of the Opera, that I regretfully won't be adding to my movie collection.Let me say what I liked first. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi, all of the original cast was there, and Dawson was fine. Some of the scenes were fantastic: the opening street scene with fires burning everywhere and the cast singing the frenetic and galvanizing title song; Mark and Joanne's tango of despair; Angel and Collins singing Santa Fe on the subway; Maureen's Over the Moon performance was a riot; the Mad Hatter's dinner at the Life Cafe was suitably bohemian.Now what I didn't like. Even with the occasional brilliance of certain scenes, the story and the characters had little chemistry or edginess; it pales in comparison to the stage show. The music is sung and played to perfection, but studio musicians have taken away its soul. Many of the segues between scenes and songs are terrible; some of them are just blackouts. Dialogue that sounds good sung sounds stilted unsung. Some major songs are missing. Other songs have been changed, for example, Mimi's signature song, Out Tonight, is performed in a strip club, reminding me of Flashdance, and there was no moondust in her hair! In Angel and Collins' love song, I'll Cover You, you can almost hear the director shouting for them not to get too affectionate with each other, perhaps to keep a PG-13 rating. Benny looked uncomfortable in his role, and you'd never know he was a bohemian at heart turned yuppie who eventually finds his way back. If one more person had laughed hysterically over Maureen turning lesbian, I swear I would have screamed. And almost acting as a coup de grace was the elaborate and farcical commitment ceremony between Joanne and Maureen which included their breakup song Take Me or Leave Me.Please see this movie, especially if you've never seen the stage show. But if the movie doesn't thrill you, please note that the stage production is a whole lot better, and try to see it if at all possible.

I thought the whole Christmas Bells/It's Beginning to Snow sequence was brilliant.  It doesn't even show up in the movie.  First the good things: 6 of the original 8 leads from the original B'way production are in the movie playing the characters again.  Rosario Dawson makes a much better Mimi than Daphne Rubin-Vega (a great improvement -- I can't stand Rubin-Vega's mealy-mouthed delivery - it sounds like she's chewing her words, or maybe just the scenery).  The plot such as it is has been streamlined, though some of the songs tend to ramble on and outlive their welcome.  The bad: 6 of the 8 original cast members made the movie. Most look too damned old for the roles, except Anthony Rapp, who still has a baby face and probably could play Roger again when he's fifty. Adam Pascal's hair: he looks like Jon Bon Jovi caught out in the rain; I know this is a source of contention amongst female fans that a lot like him with the long hair, but long hair doesn't look right on a 35-year old, even if he's supposed to be a rocker. Much of the original recitatives have been turned into spoken dialogue which sounds flat. The ending seems forced, and I agree with one other reviewer: Roger's ""one great song"" is a dud. Pascal is best when he's ripping his voice to shreds, not crooning a sappy ballad.Will I still buy the movie on DVD? Probably; it's better than most movies out there.

966523,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000E1YVZU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 7]","I was never able to see the musical ""Rent"" performed live on stage. This seems to be an ongoing trend with me. Every acclaimed musical that comes to town is always gone before I get a chance to see it. It took me almost a decade to finally catch ""Phantom of the Opera"" on stage, and then only because I was living in London and it was still playing there. So, I was happy to learn that a film version of the popular Broadway musical about a bunch of starving artists living in Manhattan's East Village would be made with many of the original cast members. It seemed a natural fit that Robert DeNiro would produce the project, a musical set on the mean streets of New York. Then more of the cast and crew were announced and my hopes began to deflate.The film is directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Harry Potter 1 and 2"", ""Bicentennial Man"") and produced by Revolution Studios. Danger, Will Robinson. Danger. Columbus has made a series of amazingly successful films, but that doesn't mean they were necessarily good films. ""Harry Potter 1 and 2"" were good films, but as we now see, the films in the series can and are so much better now that other directors have taken over. He tends to make more `family friendly' broad comedies featuring a well-known comedian (i.e., Robin Williams) and a `hook' (i.e., a man poses as a nanny to be close to his children during the divorce). Columbus doesn't seem like a good match with the material. Revolution Studios has produced an amazingly long series of just plain terrible films, stretching across every genre and engulfing many good actors in the wake. Their most successful and critically acclaimed film was Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk Down"", but one film does not make up for even a small portion of the series of duds they have perpetrated on the public. ""America's Sweethearts"" anyone?""Rent"", as a film, works, but much like the first two ""Harry Potter"" films, it doesn't transcend. I am doubtful that this musical will become a classic like the great musicals of the 40s and 50s, or even as well-remembered as the Disney animated musicals like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"". But it is a good film.My main difficulty is that a number of the songs are difficult to hear, songs featuring the character Roger (Adam Pascal). Roger, a former rising musician, now living with AIDS, the product of a drug habit, lives with Mark (Anthony Rapp), a budding documentary filmmaker, in a run-down loft in the lower East Side of Manhattan. Freezing, hungry and frustrated, their landlord turns the power off on Christmas Eve, leaving them, literally, in the dark. When Roger sings a song, either alone, or to another person, the background music takes on an edgier, rocker mood, drowning out a lot of his lyrics, making it difficult to understand him.When any of the other characters are the centerpiece of a particular song or ballad, the accompanying music is much more musical-like, allowing the lyrics to be heard. It seems odd that one character's songs should be different from the rest and I am not sure why this was done, but it really detracts from the experience.""Rent"", written by Jonathan Larson, who died shortly before the play premiered on Broadway, is a modern day interpretation of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"", which was also the loose inspiration for Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"". Now, I know what I am about to say will make a number of people mad, but ""Moulin Rouge"" was a much better film. Even with all of the excessive editing and the loud shouting, I was able to understand every word of the music, the acting, everything. In ""Rent"", this simply isn't the case. Please keep in mind I am only comparing the films. I'm sure watching ""Rent"" performed live on stage is a completely different experience.The main difference between ""Rent"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" is that ""Rent"" was initially produced as an Operatic musical. From what I understand, the play was pretty much all music, all singing, and no spoken dialogue. Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steven Chbosky have added a little bit of dialogue throughout and this is not entirely successful. This dialogue may help establish the characters a little more, but it seems odd to hear so much singing and then have the characters speak a few lines of dialogue before returning to singing. The characters speaking in their normal voices takes you out of a world where everyone is singing all of the time, jarring you back into reality. Then when they start singing again, it takes a few moments to get back into the cadence of the song. It seems sloppy.The new addition to the cast is Rosario Dawson. Six of the other seven members of the cast originated their roles in the Broadway production. Dawson plays Mimi Marquez, a heroin addicted exotic dancer, and gives perhaps the most believable performance. She is the newcomer to the group and as we witness her character through their eyes, we see a more fully realized arch for her character. They meet her, learn about her, deal with some of her problems and then become close to her. She becomes attracted to Roger, which adds gravitas to his character as the recovering addict has to help Mimi with her addiction, bringing back memories of his own problems. It is Dawson's best performance in a few years.The other standout is Wilson Jermaine Heredia who plays the transvestite Angel. Wilson won a Tony for the same role on Broadway and he clearly knows his way around the character. He makes Angel more real than some of the other characters. At times, we feel empathy and sadness, and at others, we feel his joy for life. It is a real stand out performance.The rest of the cast is good. Anthony Rapp plays Mark, the budding documentary filmmaker who always carries a camera around, recording events as they happen to him and his friends. All of this footage is for a documentary he is working on, which he ultimately finishes and shows to the collected group. The camera has no microphone, so he seems to be making a silent documentary, using a jumble of pictures and images to tell his story. The finished project seems like a bad student project from high school, but maybe that's just me.Jesse L. Martin (TV's ""Law and Order"") plays Collins, a friend of Mark and Roger who returns to New York to teach and deal with his own case of AIDS. He meets Angel and they begin a relationship. His character is the least interesting to me, because he spends the majority of the film walking around smiling and laughing, because he is so happy in his relationship with Angel. His character experiences the least growth, making him the least interesting. Idina Menzel (who played the Wicked Witch in ""Wicked"" recently on Broadway), plays Maureen and does a good job with the role of the flirtatious Bi- former girlfriend of Mark.Because this is a musical, you expect a certain amount of the film to take place in interior settings, but Columbus stages many of the outdoor scenes on what appear to be sets as well. With the advancement of technology, it seems like it would be fairly easy to shoot exteriors in real locations. But Columbus apparently doesn't agree. At one point Roger travels to Santa Fe, and these scenes are clearly shot outdoors in real locations. They stand out like a sore thumb because they are so different from the rest of the film. Clearly, that is the point, but they don't appear to belong to the same film.""Rent"" will clearly appeal to devoted fans of the stage version, but if you have never seen the stage play you may have some trouble accepting Columbus' interpretation of the material.",3,They Didn't Check The References Very Thoroughly,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,7593,"['was', 'never', 'able', 'see', 'musical',

966525,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000E1YVZU,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 10]","When I first saw the musical I was impressed with a musical that was new and wasn't Andrew Lloyd Weber. I also loved the whole mythology of the bohemian artist and the artist community that has only a limited shelf life. In this case, AIDS is killing the artist, but in other time periods, the artists eventually move away, become successful, ""sell out"" or just pack it up. There are only so many years you can convince yourself that poverty is romantic before you get a business degree.I bought the CD and listened to it so often that I got sick of it. I started to notice how bad some of the songs were and how even the good ones were terribly overwrought.Needless to say I had only an inkling of what I was getting myself in for when I saw the movie. I found that I loved the songs even more when I watched it and for only a few hours I let myself hum along to the nostalgia of youthful ""rebellion"" and art crowds. The songs that were great when I first saw it, still held up. The songs that weren't so great weren't in it for very long (and in some cases Chris Columbus replaced the singing with straight dialogue - which is strange but also effective).That's not to say the movie is without faults. I'm not sure if Larson intended to depict the artier types as amateur hacks (Maureen's performance art, Roger's mediocre one song that he takes a year on, Mark's home video - these are not good artworks) or if he really believed that they were living the dream. I'm tending to think the former since his work is pretty good. The actors are too old for the roles. Rosario Dawson is not 19. The rest of the cast are in their 30s, long after it's cool to live in poverty and make bad art. The hokey slams on internet and cyberart grind the movie to a halt.But overall, it's an enjoyable movie and a great memorial to old friends - either the ones taht died of AIDS or just the ones you knew in college and lost touch with.",4,Odd Movie,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1923,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'musical', 'was', 'impressed', 'musical', 'was', 'new', 'was', ""n't"", 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'also', 'loved', 'whole', 'mythology', 'bohemian', 'artist', 'artist', 'community', 'only', 'limited', 'shelf', 'life', 'case', 'AIDS', 'killing', 'artist', 'other', 'time', 'periods', 'artists', 'eventually', 'move', 'away', 'become', 'successful', 'sell', 'out', 'just', 'pack', 'up', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'can', 'convince', 'poverty', 'romantic', 'get', 'business', 'degree.I', 'bought', 'CD', 'listened', 'so', 'often', 'got', 'sick', 'started', 'notice', 'how', 'bad', 'songs', 'were', 'how', 'even', 'good', 'ones', 'were', 'terribly', 'overwrought.Needless', 'say', 'had', 'only', 'inkling', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'found', 'loved', 'songs', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'watched', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'let', 'hum', 'along', 'nostalgia', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'art', 'crowds', 'songs', 'were', 'great', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'still', 'held', 'up', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'cases', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'replaced', 'singing', 'straight', 'dialogue', 'strange', 'also', 'effective', '.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'faults', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Larson', 'intended', 'depict', 'artier', 'types', 'amateur', 'hacks', 'Maureen', 'performance', 'art', 'Roger', 'mediocre', 'one', 'song', 'year', 'Mark', 'home', 'video', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'artworks', 'really', 'believed', 'were', 'living', 'dream', ""'m"", 'tending', 'think', 'former', 'work', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'not', '19', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', '30s', 'long', 'cool', 'live', 'poverty', 'make', 'bad', 'art', 'hokey', 'slams', 'internet', 'cyberart', 'grind', 'movie', 'halt.But', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', 'memorial', 'old', 'friends', 'ones', 'taht', 'died', 'AIDS', 'just', 'ones', 'knew', 'college', 'lost', 'touch']",N/A

But I also know that, realistically, there is no way to film it without rearranging and cutting (cutting A LOT) and what have you.  The show is all over the place, but it works because of the music and the massive energy of everyone on stage.  You can't help but be sucked in, and when the first notes of ""Seasons of Love"" enter your ears, you'll be more than tempted to sing along.But getting back to the movie...The movie has a few things going for it:-The cast (six of the original eight, as if you don't know) is wonderful.  There is an easy camaraderie between the principles, which makes a lot of the dialogue more believable.  They all look and sound as if they are having fun, and that tends to be contagious even on screen.  Idina Menzel isn't as over the top and obnoxious as she was on stage, though she still has her moments.  Tracie Thoms steals the show...she was born to be Joanne, honestly.  And Wilson Jermaine Heredia is heartbreakingly charming beginning to end.  As for the Daphne/Rosario debate, Daphne's Mimi always frightened me slightly.  She reminded me of that tough girl in high school that you just NEVER crossed because if you did, you would die.  She grew up quick because she didn't have any other choice.  Rosario Dawson's Mimi is more vulnerbale and (dare I say it) naiive.  When Roger says she looks sixteen, she's almost too eager to correct him.  There's a certain tenderness she brings to Mimi, and that's not a bad thing.  She gives a surprisingly strong vocal performance (though I don't think her voice would be able to survive 8 shows a week), and the chemistry between her and Adam Pascal is just something else.-While it IS a treat to see the original cast reunited (for the most part), the music is the real star of the show.  I love my OBC recording more than life itself, but the music is only enhanced by this production.  Seasons of Love (with Tracie Thoms voice simply soaring in the solo) is moved from the beginning of the second act, but this version breathes new life into the song...something I never thought possible.  Jesse Martin's voice just got better with age, and if you don't believe me, listen to I'll Cover You (reprise).  Tango: Maureen and Take Me or Leave Me are absolute show stoppers here, probably because of Idina's post-Wicked popularity.  And La Vie Boheme is STILL the salute to all things Bohemian that it always was.  You can't help but love it.  The only song I really had a problem with was Halloween (they cut it out of the final version of the film).  It sounds slightly over-produced because of the very personal nature of the lyrics.  The music is too prominent on that track for my liking, but Anthony Rapp can always be counted on.-The story always treads the line between poignant and cheesy very VERY dangerously, so the finale could have very easily been disasterous.  But it's handled beautifully, and to be honest, I was crying too hard to care.  I'll warn you: if you've lost anyone to AIDS, then their face is bound to come to your mind during this film.  Also, most of the sung dialogue in the show is spoken here, which for me is a MAJOR plus.  I have never understood the whole ""Let's sing the entire movie"" thing.  Singing through the dialogue works on stage, but on film, its tiresome.The only real complaint I have about the whole thing is the exclusion of Contact, a song from the show.  I know, realistically, no one would be able to pull THAT performance off on film.  But it is one of the best, and most creative, moments of the entire show.  Without spoiling anything, the event that Contact deals with is dealt with wonderfully in the movie, but it's more cliche.The second DVD is a MAJOR must-see.  Just don't make the mistake of watching it right after the movie finishes.  I did...and I couldn't get through it.  The main feature on Disc Two is the extremely informative and powerful documentary ""No Day But Today.""  You'll learn about the life of Jonathan Larson and the creation of Rent.  While watching it, I was filled with an obscene amount of respect for the man.  It tells his life story, so when his family and friends recall his death, you're just as emotional as they are at the absurd timing of it.  It's obvious that they are still trying to come to terms with his death.  But if you think about it, it makes creepy sense.  Rent was the biggest thing he would EVER do, and when he did that, he died.  I firmly believe he was put on Earth to give us Rent, which is exactly what he did.  So thank you Jonathan Larson.There are other special features.  The deleted scenes are great because of the songs (I don't know WHY Goodbye Love and Halloween were cut).  The alternate ending isn't as moving as the one they used, but it's still touching in its own right.  The commentary is amusing, particularly a comment Adam Pascal makes about the scene in Santa Fe reminding people of the Britney Spears movie - which (for the record) had not crossed my mind until he pointed it out.  Personally, that was one connection I could have done without.Rent is really about making the most of the time you're given in life.  You can't argue with that.  The music, the characters, the story, even the story of Rent's creation, come together to deliver that message.  And trust me, if you're feeling low for whatever reason, this movie will do nothing if not comfort you on some level.  So grab the kleenex, sit back, and just enjoy the ride.

966527,A16GGCDUETTTDB,B000E1YVZU,T-Man,"[0, 1]","I believe that ALL fans of the original Broadway play will love this movie. They may not like it better, but they should love it! It's emotions are so powerful, so tense, you can feel it. It's a ROCK musical that has every word ringing in your ear with lots of meaning. Not many musicals move their story along with music like this one does. You really need to pay attention to the lyrics here.If you're a fan but haven't seen this movie yet, you should. Tracie Thoms (Joanne) and Rosario Dawson (Mimi) fill the shoes of Fredi Walker and Daphne Rubin-Vega PERFECTLY. All the other 6 people ARE FROM THE ORIGNAL CAST!Here are some of the reasons why I think the movie version of Rent works out a little better than the broadway play:A more logical plot: In the original cast play, half of it takes place on Christmas, at least from 9:00 P.M. on December 24 to perhaps early in the morning on December 25th. That would mean everything from the song ""Rent"" to ""La Vie Boh&egrave;me B"" took place during a period of only a few hours. It's almost impossible. But here, half of everything takes place from 9 pm December 24th to when everybody in the restaurant is singing ""La Vie Boh&egrave;me B"" late at night on December 26th.I also like how much fat has been trimmed from the original Broadway play. ""Rent"" was originally a rock opera. Much of what was sung in the original play is now spoken dialouge in the movie, with almost the exact same words too. We now have that, and the major songs. Perfect!What I also like is how the movie starts out with ""Seasons of Love."" This song is now sung by the 8 stars only (not to mention, along with the rest of all the music, has much more clearer vocals, and layered, more full instrumentation). It's perfect because it basically introduces what the play is about. ""Seasons of Love B"" keeps its original spot, except it comes before Maureen's and Joanne's ""Take Me Or Leave Me."" ""Seasons of Love"" is supposed to be feel good, and the movie does a perfect job of it.I recommend this movie to both fans and non-fans of Rent, and fans and non-fans of musicals/operas. Rent basically turned me into an addict of itself and made me a fan of musicals. I often thought of most musicals as things for kids but not after Rent.Please see this eye-opening, heart-racing, goosebump forming, and tear-jerking movie!

966528,A26LIR24MAM6VQ,B000E1YVZU,"todd rich ""scoop 69""","[1, 7]","* Firstly , I'd like to state for the record, that I originally rated this item , 3 stars. Once I finished my review , I noticed that it was rated a 1 star. Unfortunately I couldn't change it. Now , for my review.Considering the great "" bumps"" in the road , about filming a broadway play ( especially a musical ), I think Chris Columbus's film production of "" Rent"", is a remarkable achievement. From translating the meduim to film , and editing what should stay in and out of the finalized product , is pure genius. Is there a cionsiderable difference in the play and the film ....YES. Will there be any missing momentum and energy lost in the play's transition from stage to film ?......YES. However , ""Rent"" , as a film , stands on it's own merits and highlights enough of the characters and storyline , to give you the jist of the phenominal play. You'll never get out of a film , what you get out of a play. Never ! However , much like the fantastic musicals such as "" Fame , Grease , Hair , and Little Shop of Horrors "" , the success ,of this ""transferring of mediums"" is dependent upon teh storyteller ( aka: the director). Chris Columbus does a fantastic job. Enough of my technical talk. The story itself , is a mezmerizing and unforgettable journey into the lives of several friends caught up in the bohemian lifestyle.  The story takes place in 1980's NY , and thusly the problems such as poverty , homelessness , drug use , and AIDS, play a huge factor. Ironically , the plot hasn't aged muich , because we're still living in that era. The only difference is that some of us are older and wiser. However , the problems still plaugue our society and this film does brilliantly at highlighting these issues. The film features phenominal performances , musical numbers , editing , directing , and cinematography. There is also a bonus dvd , that takes us to the humble ( to say the least ) beginnings, of the development of "" Rent"". This bonus dvd , is well worth the purchase price. Another mentionable and commendable aspect of "" Rent' , is that it features the majority of the original broadway cast. After viewing the bonus dvd , it is impossible to cast the film any other way. The actors burst back into their characters , like a teenager rides a bike. They simply perform better than anyone else ever could. Plain and simple , this movie is tight. I highly recommend it , even if you don't like musicals. I believe that you will find yourself watching it again and again and even humming some of the songs. Whereas , "" Rent "",  might not be the best musical I've ever seen, it certainly is one that I will never forget. Where it lacks in song originality , it makes up for , in script. Where is lacks in acting , it makes up for , in character development.

966529,A1NLX2NT3A5Z1U,B000E1YVZU,TOL,"[7, 10]","I am a self-proclaimed lover of musical theatre. And although I own  almost every major Broadway and Off-Broadway soundtrack, and have seen most of the classics at least once or twice, I somehow let Rent slip through the cracks. Not, by any means, because I never heard of it, but, rather, because I made the all too often fatal mistake of listening to the musical theatre elitists who turn their nose up at anything that wasn't written by Stephen Sondheim. Sure, I heard the story: an update of La Boehme that replaces Mimi with a stripper and the plague with AIDS. I also heard of the untimely death of the young composer, and even bought into the urban legend that he died of AIDS (which could not be further from the truth). But, somehow, I took a pass on the show, the soundtrack, and the whole sordid affair. The ""rentheads"" just seemed far too giddy for me to believe that they were actually worshipping something of value. Boy was I wrong.When the movie came out, I was tempted to go see it, but I took yet another pass, for all the same reasons. But the DVD was convenient enough for me to give it a spin. And what a spin it was. As a piece of musical theatre, Rent is not without its issues - all of which have been stated very eloquently before. The plot is a little weak and the lyrics could have used a little refining. But THE MUSIC! Oh, that music! I was bowled over from the first half minute. Jonathan Larson was far from a musical genius - which is exactly why the music is so incredibly good. Combining simple, memorable melodies with incredible multi-part harmonies, the notes sing to you all by themselves. I was left wondering where this play had been all my life.But this is not intended to be a review of the show itself. What I am here to do today is review the DVD. And I made you sit through the long introduction above because it is very relevant to what I am about to write.  Like most any other operatic musical, it is very hard to translate to film without it feelng like you are watching a studio version of the play itself. The magic of the theatre is lost on film, and most musicals are very difficult to adapt without a whopping serving of cheese. Jesus Christ Superstar, Godspell, Hair, Evita, Phantom Of The Opera, and a slew of others have all suffered from the same fate. And, I'm afraid to say that Rent joins the pack of musicals that just didn't quite translate. Many an ambitious Director have tried. And the only one who has ever succeded, in my opinion, is Rob Marshall with Chicago. How? By filming it like an old style Hollywood musical with an updated modern feel, instead of trying to set the stage version to film. Chris Columbus, who directed Rent, chose to go the other route - adapting the stage show to a series of elaborate sets and unimaginable backgrounds which try to imitate reality, and might have suceeded were it not for all of the frolicking and singing going on. And that's where the conflict lies. Modern Hollywood movies show unrealistic things happening in realistic settings. Stage musicals show realistic things happening in unrealistic settings. So the only way to translate them properly is to do as Chicago did and as the old-style Hollywood musicals did; don't try to be too real. Well, Chris Columbus, with his roots in 1980's New York City, missed that entire point and tried too hard to make it all real for us. And, in so doing, he, in my opinion, failed.But that's not the only way in which Mr. Columbus failed us. In watching the movie, I had a unique perspective because I had absolutely no previous exposure to the story. And, unfortunately, were it not for the music, I might never have felt any emotion at all because the movie never gives us any emotional attachment to any of the characters. I won't go into plot lines here, but I can tell you that nothing held together. The relationships were just never established. And then I watched the excellent Special Features disc which included all of the cut scenes. And, all of a sudden, everything came together. After watching only 4 of the deleted scenes, I was suddenly able to feel the entire movie. Mark explains his internal struggles, Mimi explains her attachment to Roger, Roger and Mark explain their attachment to one another, and Benny explains his relationship with Mimi. And, with that, you can suddenly understand and relate to the rest of the movie in an entirely different way. Then I made the mistake of turning the Director commentary on during those cut scenes, and I was all the more infuriated to listen in on Chris Columbus flip-flopping back and forth as to whether or not the scenes actually should have been cut. It was like listening to a child trying to justify himself into a position which he knew he should never have taken. This was most evident during his description of the alternate ending in which the actors return to the same stage on which they began, to sing the finale in the same setting where they sang the introduction. This was the only 'theatrical' moment of the entire movie where he actually put the actors on stage where they belong. Tying the ending to the beginning in this way might just have made everything else seem like somebody else's re-telling of their story, or as a part of Mark's film - which could have actually worked. But, instead he decided to cut it because, as he put it, it was too far the beginning and he didn't think the audience would remember it enough to tie the two together. Never underestimate us, Chris. It all left me a little angry, to tell you the truth. But I was also left feeling fortunate to have seen this movie for the first time on DVD so that I could also see these cut scenes and benefit from the composer's original vision - one which made much more sense than that of Chris Columbus.So it may sound like I'm bashing the Director here, and, in reality, I'm probably not cutting him enough slack. Because I think his intentions were probably good. The problem, as far as I could see it, is that he knew the story too well. So it held together far better for him than for someone like me who had never seen or heard the story before. But there was also a lot that he did right. The decision to use 6 out of 8 of the original cast members, for one. The chemistry, vocal chops, and dramatic timing of Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, and Jesse L. Martin are spectacular and work perfectly together. And the seemless introductions of Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms are equally impressive. The music and accompanying arrangements sound modern, fresh, and well produced, and the blocking, camera work, and timing are all beyond compare. So, although he got a lot of it wrong, he does deserve due credit for getting a lot of things very, very right.But the real star of this show is still the Special Features disc and, more appropriately stated, the composer, Jonathan Larson. The accompanying cut scenes are a necessity so I won't give the DVD too much credit for including them, but the 2-hour documentary entitled No Day But Today is a gem that could have demanded the entire price of the DVD all by itself. In it, we learn about the life of Jonathan Larson, the humble, eccentric, and, yes, very straight composer of Rent. Not that being straight is relevant to anything other than the fact that there is an eerie and unsettling feeling associated with a person, like myself, who assumed for 10 years that the composer of a play about AIDS must have been homosexual, and then one day, suddenly realizes that my otherwise open mind could have been so easily closed by prejudice and lies. A humbling experience to say the least. In any case, Jonathan Larson's story is told with such eloquence and such feeling that it is even more emotionally insightful than the movie itself. In fact, it was only after watching this documentary that I was truly hooked on the story of Rent. And it is then that you realize that Jonathan Larson's story is as much a part of the success of Rent as the story of the play itself. And maybe it is only through his death that the true story can completely unfold and be felt. This documentary reached me on many levels. It left me speechless. And, as you can tell by the length of this review, that is a rare occurence.So, in short, I was inspired by Rent - but as much, if not more, by the story of its composer than by the story itself. They are truly one. I am grateful for having been so grossly misinformed and for not having seen Rent before, because I truly believe that the only way I would have truly enjoyed it is not as a 3-hour play, or as a 2-hour movie, but as a 4-hour movie/documentary that paints the entire picture. And it is a picture that I will not soon forget.Summary: 5-stars for the music, 4-stars for the book, 3-stars for the lyrics, 3-stars for the movie, 6-stars for the documentary. That averages out to about 4-stars. So that's where I'll leave it. But only with these words: Buy this DVD, watch both discs in their entirety, and just let the music and the story reach you as they did me. The feeling will be with you for a long time.",4,"Thank You, Jonathan...",1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,9158,"['am', 'self-proclaimed', 'lover', 'musical', 'theatre', 'own', 'almost', 'major',

The movie showed people  dying of AIDS, lesbian relationships, actors freely talking about drugs and showing syringes, and a drag queen. And no i'm no saint. I'm liberal and gay but this movie should've been a rated R movie. Come on. How corrupt is that. Horror movies are always getting axed for being rated R and getting a edited watered down PG-13.  But non-horror movies have alot of sexual suggestions, bad language (yes the S word and the F word), and heavy violence but are rated PG-13.

966533,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000E1YVZU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 9]","I must confess that I have never seen the original theatre. I hear many avid fans praise the filmed version as well as the original. My impression is simply this; ""why so long?"" And ""why so annoying?"" And most of all, why Chris Columbus?Or how about this - Why it took so long to make a filmed version? They should have done it much earlier. Today the story of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City is no longer credible and attractive enough. NYC has changed a lot since the 1990s while the film seems unaware of that, resulting in the detached feeling. What was refreshing in 1996 is no longer so to most of us in 2005.Of course, stage musical is a different thing, where you are directly invited to the world you are watching, and the actors' pure energy with dynamic singing makes you forget the weakness of the setting and the plot. The key to the film adaptation is how to transfer the energy to the screen. John Cameron Mitchell knew it as in `Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which is a knock-out experience from the first to the end.But Columbus, whose CV includes `Home Alone' and `Harry Potter,' doesn't seem to know it. Look at the number ""La Vie Boheme"" that is supposed to be a show-stopper. Sorry if you liked the piece, but to me the utterly offensive ""anthem"" is just rubbish. With the stereotyped images about artists, and worse, homosexuals, the scene is only useful in proving how the mainstream filmmakers look at the Bohemians and create these thin, clich&eacute;d characters on the screen. Do they really act like that on stage? Or is this scene really supposed to be done like that?Among this faux Bohemian world, however, some actors manage to be real. Anthony Rapp is amazing, probably the only actor in the cast, who embodies a spirit of the rebellious Bohemian artist in the film. Rosario Dawson is seductive while dancing, and Taye Diggs is impressive (as always) as one former roommate with a more level-headed perspective. However, the rest of the film is about some good musical songs, many mediocre rock numbers (for which the original creator of the musical Jonathen Larsen is not responsible, I think), and some not-so-great acting from the cast.The lengthy film remains mediocre from the beginning to the end, and that is the worst thing done to the material that is supposed to be unique and original, hymn to love and life.",2,Chris Columbus???

Rent took me through a range of emotions, and it was fun.It was fun to have some popcorn and park on the couch and be thoroughly entertained for a couple of bucks, than bother with the fuss and high price of going out. This movie is a fun night out, without going anywhere.",5,Great Movie,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,342,"['love', 'musicals', 'one', 'had', 'great', 'songs', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'Rent', 'took', 'range', 'emotions', 'was', 'fun.It', 'was', 'fun', 'have', 'popcorn', 'park', 'couch', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'couple', 'bucks', 'bother', 'fuss', 'high', 'price', 'going', 'out', 'movie', 'fun', 'night', 'out', 'going', 'anywhere']",N/A

I don't know what it is that draws me to this movie, but theres a power there that I cannot escape.  I don't know if it's the memorable characters, the songs or their lifestyle that I identify with, but Im in complete awe everytime I listen to the soundtrack or watch the movie.  I saw this movie twice in the theater and I can't wait for the DVD to come out to watch the documentary of Jonathan Larson.  I also own the broadway album which I love since I've seen the film.
