535765,A1OBU0FTRIJQ3F,B00003CXSM,Amazon Customer,"[4, 5]","I usually don't go for romantic flicks, but even so few were as enchanting as this one. It was a little predictable (but all romance movies mostly are) and some of the cute comedy was a bit flat - again, nothing I didn't expect. Matthew McCaughnehy (I know I'm spelling his name wrong) is always really good, in all his films, and he was endearing as the cute and responsible doctor opposite Jenniefer Lopez. Oddly enough, I expected to find her a bit irritating in this movie (even though I liked her other work) and was thankfully mistaken. She's really good, adding a lot of spark to this picture-perfect movie. The two main characters also have lots of chemistry, something that's sadly lacking lately. Scene stealers include the bumbling yet sweet Italian misfit Massimo, played by Justin Chambers, who is perfect. His character is almost ridiculous when first introduced, but provides endless humor. Chambers' bewildered grin and odd mannerisms redeen his otherwise annoying, yet cute, character. Also look out for Lopez' father in the film, whos name eludes me, he's very good too. Everyone is!Great dialogue, script, and acting. Much better than expected. Right up there with other romantic comedy favorites of mine, 'Sliding Doors' and 'Notting Hill', if a little silly.

I don't particularly find her a drop-dead knock out like everyone else (she is attractive, but not my cup of tea), and I don't really think she is the greatest actress out there (I foresee NO Oscars in her future) BUT, and this is a HUGE but, she is so likeable and charming and just effortlessly captivating.I LOVE WATCHING HER!That said, when I first saw `The Wedding Planner', her captivating presence blinded me to the films flaws.  I really liked this, but truth be told, I like almost everything she does.  I mean, what isn't to like about predictable romantic comedies so familiar you could quote them before you see them YET maintain such charming chemistry with the viewer that you walk away totally refreshed and completely entertained.I mean, really...what ISN'T to like about that?Still, after a few recent viewings it becomes clearer and clearer that, despite Lopez's charm, I really don't wish to watch this one again.`Maid in Manhattan'; yes please.`Monster-in-Law'; double check.This predictable, preposterous mess; I don't think so.One of the biggest issues I have with `The Wedding Planner' is that it is SOOOOOO stupid.  It's one thing to present a premise that is predictable and `far fetched', but it is another thing entirely to insult the viewer by degrading your main characters, delivering people who appear to be just plain stupid.  The whole idea of a groom-to-be having one last potential `outing' before he ties the knot is not far-fetched.  Having that fling turn out to be your bride-to-be's hired wedding planner is stretching it a little, but believable.  Having the bride totally oblivious to everything that is obvious and (get this) TRUSTING HER GROOM AND HER PLANNER TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF HER LIFE WITHOUT OUT is just going so far over the line that it is eye-rolling ridiculous.  I mean, forget her naivety about her grooms wavering pants, there is no way I am going to believe that a woman that neurotic about her wedding being perfect is going to let two other people plan it for her while she goes away on business.Stupid.Add to that the ridiculous Massimo sub-plot (which is drug out far too long and becomes such a stupid reminder of how clich&eacute;d and unintelligent rom-coms can be) and you have a film that lacks so much in brains it loses all charm.  It's sad, because Lopez and even Matthew (I'll never really understand his appeal) both play off one another wonderfully here.

535768,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,B00003CXSM,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[0, 3]","A wedding planner produces weddings.  But unlike movie or stage producers, the wedding planner is limited by one cardinal rule: do not fall in love with either the bride or groom and thereby destroy the very wedding you're being paid to produce.On this premise we get a fairly predictable comedy.  Jennifer Lopez,as unlikely a wedding planner as you'll ever get, falls in love with the groom.  Meanwhile another jerk (other than the groom, of course) wants to marry Jennifer.  In the end, despite the movie-makers' overbearing attempt to reach a happy ending, Jennifer, in my view, marries the wrong jerk.  I think it's a movie that ran away with itself, frustrating the original idea.  Since the original idea was to frustrate the wedding planner, it's poetic justice of a sort.Just one of Jennifer Lopez's songs was played as part of the soundtrack.  I think the movie-makers were afraid to fill the entire soundtrack with her songs.  But why?  They would have given the movie extra value.

Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez couldn't be better as star-crossed lovers who click on their first meeting. The trouble is that Lopez is a high-anxiety wedding planner with a utility belt strapped on her that would make Batman look unprepared, and her newest client (Bridgitte Wilson-Sampras) is engaged to McConaughey. Choreographer Adam Shankman makes an ill-advised directorial debut that is rife with technical errors (extras that stare right into the camera, sloppy editing among the many) and is completely unaware as to how uneven the apparantly unfinished script really is. That said, his talents as a dance director are obvious considering that the tango scene between the two leads is the film's best moment and one of the most enjoyable dance scenes in a Hollywood film of recent years. Wilson-Sampras and Judy Greer, two consistently working character actresses, are given their very best roles to date in this film and subsequently give excellent performances. Star power is the real winner here though, and the two gorgeous headliners will keep you wanting more until the very end.

535779,AV8VLS7ZPUPUQ,B00003CXSM,Carol Tessen,"[0, 1]","Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is a sweet, charming wedding planner with aspirations of being a partner in the firm she works for.  On the job she is hard-working, extremely capable and always has the right solution to every problem that could possibly occur in a large, lavish wedding.  In her private life, she borders on being obsessive-compulsive and has come to terms with the fact that she will probably never marry (which is why she is a wedding planner).  While walking across the street one day, she gets her new Gucci shoe stuck in a drain cover and stoops down to retrieve it.  Meanwhile, a cab has just hit a dumpster that has sent it rolling down the street heading straight for Mary.  Mary sees the oncoming dumpster but refuses to budge without her precious shoe.  Dr. Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) sees the dumpster rolling toward Mary and, realizing she isn't going to move out of the way, hurls himself at her which sends both of them out of harm's way.  She faints and awakens in the children's ward of St. Vincent's Hospital where Dr. Steve is a pediatrician.  They become acquainted and Mary starts to fall in love with the handsome doctor.  What she doesn't know, but will come to find out, is that Steve is the groom in the largest wedding she has ever planned.  Mary is hired by Francine Donelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) to plan her wedding.  Mary soon discovers that Fran is engaged to Steve.  She keeps her feelings to herself and continues to plan Steve's and Fran's wedding.  While this is going on, Mary's father (Alex Rocco) makes plans to marry his daughter to her childhood friend, Massimo (Justin Chambers) who, after seeing Mary all grown up, is more than willing to comply.  At first Mary is very cool to the idea of this arranged marriage but realizes that the love of her life is marrying another and this may be the only chance she will have to marry.  She accepts and makes plans for her own wedding.  Steve and Fran are supposed to get married the same day as Mary and Massimo.  Everyone is where they are supposed to be on the big day and there is a surprising twist that may effect the outcome of both weddings.This is one of my favorite movies!  Is there anything that Jennifer Lopez can't do?  She's beautiful, is an incredible singer, a great dancer, and a good actress as well.  She proves that she can do comedy in this movie and you will fall in love with her character.  As with most romantic comedies, you will pretty much be able to figure out the ending.

The movie, &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding,&quot; was a departure from the formula when there was a surprise as to who ended up successful in the romantic battle between two suitors. Here, there was the potential for the same sort of twist. Indeed, the table was set for the less predictable outcome to occur. But no!!!! Instead, we see. early on, sexual and emotional tension develop between the two main characters and it is perfectly predictable that after a few plot twists, they will end up getting married.Jennifer Lopez was good in her role but Matthew McConaughey was a little less believable as a pediatrician who becomes her romantic interest. All in all, the movie was cute, but at one time or another, we have seen all the predictable plot twists, right down to the mad race to break up the wedding of the main charcter's love interest to someone else before it's too late (remember &quot;The Graduate?).

But this idea is quickly killed by a  combination of a weak script and terrible acting.  Most of the blame falls squarely on the beautiful shoulders of gorgeous Jennifer Lopez.Lopez has an acting range that can best be described as non-existent. She plays every scene with the same vacant-eyed look.  She emits virtually no emotion and recites her lines as if they were written on cue cards.  Her total lack of involvement in her character is appaling.Matthey McConaughey does not escape blame either.  He gives essentially the same monosyballic performance that he did in EdTV - another good idea killed by his inept acting.The plot is mostly formula - Jennifer Lopez plays Mary Fiore, wedding planner falls in love with the groom she is supposed to be helping planning a wedding for.  And the bride, played by beautiful but colorless Bridget Wilson-Sampras, practically throws her fiance at the Lopez.  Talk about a case of being blind to the situation.  I should add that the plot device used to bring Lopez and McConaughey together - she gets her shoe stuck in a manhole - is incredibly contrived.There a a number of other plot lines tossed in. Lopez supposedly is a member of a Scrabble club with her father (yeah, right), but this is not explored very much.  It is hard to fathom a reason as to why the filmakers chose this plot device.  Loez also suposedly has to nail this big client so that she can become a partner in the company.  This plot device is also not utlized for any particular purpose.  Mary's dad, played by the usually decent Alex Roccco, tries to fix her up with this Italian fellow, who seems to have come right out of central casting from the files of &quot;Obnoxious Foreigner&quot;.  It is yet another degrading sterotype.  And why is he hanging around a bunch of old people?  This is also not explained.  One other unbelievable plot device is that Mary has not had a date in two years?  Like who would believe that?  This woman is absolutley stunning and she doesn't date?  Maybe it's her personality.  But a less pretty actress could have been more believable.But most of the problem with this movie is the attempt to craft a movie around someone who can't act.  Lopez might work well in a lessor role where she doesn't have to carry the load and the success of the film doesn't depend on her role.  This could have been a much better movie, had it starred actors with more ability.  And had it been given a better script.",2,Atrocious Acting Kills Good Idea,1002499200,"10 8, 2001",2001,2547,"['surface', 'was', 'cute', 'idea', 'Wedding', 'planner', 'falls', 'live', 'one', 'clients', 'idea', 'quickly', 'killed', 'combination', 'weak', 'script', 'terrible', 'acting', 'Most', 'blame', 'squarely', 'beautiful', 'shoulders', 'gorgeous', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez.Lopez', 'acting', 'range', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'non-existent', 'scene', 'same', 'vacant-eyed', 'look', 'virtually', 'emotion', 'lines', 'were', 'written', 'cue', 'cards', 'total', 'lack', 'involvement', 'character', 'appaling.Matthey', 'McConaughey', 'not', 'escape', 'blame', 'either', 'essentially', 'same', 'monosyballic', 'performance', 'did', 'EdTV', 'good', 'idea', 'killed', 'inept', 'acting.The', 'plot', 'mostly', 'formula', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Mary', 'Fiore', 'wedding', 'planner', 'love', 'groom', 'supposed', 'be', 'helping', 'planning', 'wedding', 'bride', 'played', 'beautiful', 'colorless', 'Bridget', 'Wilson-Sampras', 'practically', 'fiance', 'Lopez', 'Talk', 'case', 'being', 'blind', 'situation', 'should', 'add', 'plot', 'device', 'used', 'bring', 'Lopez', 'McConaughey', 'together', 'shoe', 'stuck', 'manhole', 'incredibly', 'contrived.There', 'number', 'other', 'plot', 'lines', 'tossed', 'Lopez', 'supposedly', 'member', 'Scrabble', 'club', 'father', 'yeah', 'right', 'not', 'explored', 'very', 'much', 'hard', 'fathom', 'reason', 'why', 'filmakers', 'chose', 'plot', 'device', 'Loez', 'also', 'suposedly', 'nail', 'big', 'client', 'can', 'become', 'partner', 'company', 'plot', 'device', 'also', 'not', 'utlized', 'particular', 'purpose', 'Mary', 'dad', 'played', 'usually', 'decent', 'Alex', 'Roccco', 'fix', 'up', 'Italian', 'fellow', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'right', 'central', 'casting', 'files', 'quot', 'Obnoxious', 'Foreigner', 'quot', 'yet', 'degrading', 'sterotype', 'why', 'hanging', 'bunch', 'old', 'people', 'also', 'not', 'explained', 'One', 'other', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'device', 'Mary', 'not', 'had', 'date', 'two', 'years', 'who', 'would', 'believe', 'woman', 'absolutley', 'stunning', ""n't"", 'date', 'Maybe', 'personality', 'less', 'pretty', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable.But', 'most', 'problem', 'movie', 'attempt', 'craft', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Lopez', 'might', 'work', 'well', 'lessor', 'role', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'carry', 'load', 'success', 'film', ""n't"", 'depend', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'starred', 'actors', 'more', 'ability', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'better', 'script']",N/A

Mary will say and do anything to make certain HER weddings go off without a hitch.  All her clients have to do is show up and let her shove them around.  Then she goes home alone, no surprise, and we're expected to feel sorry for her.  They spend half the movie building her up as some ironclad bully in high heels only to abruptly reduce her to a wishy-washy whiner caught up in some slapstick antics only the Marx Brothers could pull off.Mary meets her foil, in guise of a possible suitor (Matthew McConaughey), when a runaway dumpster almost takes her out.  Instead, he takes her out.  Oh by the way, he's otherwise engaged (but while the intended is away, the rat will play).  In true Harlequin fashion they almost kiss (does this make their indiscretion chaste but not pure?).  When next the liars meet it's with the intended wife in tow, they revel in the awkwardness of the situation and say nothing until they can snipe at each other during a dance lesson.  Both are now seen for what they truly are, petty loathsome liars (he can't say anything because he's about to be married and she can't say anything because money is involved and she doesn't want to lose her partnership in the firm).  The plot deepens into a morass of bigger lies, not the least of which is a misunderstood engagement to some guy named Massimo.

Yes, it does seem like another silly chick-flick with one-dimensional characters, but it's not.  The characters in this movie are so loveable and funny; you want them all to win at the game of love!Jennifer Lopez does a fantastic job as Mary Fiore, a wedding planner who's motto is ""Those who can't wed, plan!""  She has no life other than her job and doesn't have any potential of love in her life until...Eddie James comes along played by Matthew McConaughey (who is as smug, haughty, and arrogant as ever!).  Luckily, McConaughey's character actually needs these characteristics, so it all works out nicely.Justin Chambers plays Massimo Lenzetti, a hilariously clueless childhood acquaintance of Mary's, who comes back wanting to marry her.  I must say that Chambers steals the show.  Whenever he comes on screen you find yourself giggling uncontrollably at his awkwardness.  I must point out that he later played D'Artagnan in ""The Musketeer"", quite a transition from Massimo!  This proves that Justin Chambers is a fantastic actor.Judy Greer also does a wonderful job as Mary's assistant, Penny Nicholson.  Penny is constantly hyperventilating over small things (like a broken dish at a wedding).  It's really quite funny to watch.I found myself laughing almost constantly throughout ""The Wedding Planner"" because of the unforgettable and funny characters mentioned above.  ""The Wedding Planner"" also gives us some hilarious insight into the world of wedding planning.  One of my favorite lines is ""The FOB is MIA"".  To Mary, this means ""the father of the bride is missing"".  If anyone has seen ""Strictly Ballroom"" or ""Best in Show"" then they'll understand what I'm about to saw.  A lot of the humor in this film is really just showing you how ridiculous the worries of the wedding planner community are.  The traumas that seem important to Mary are just so comical to us that we can't help but laugh.",4,"""The FOB is MIA!!!""

Every minute I was instead conscious a script was being acted out.  Nothing about the characters, or the story line, was logical and as the film progressed I realized it was like watching endless piece of a puzzle but in no way did the pieces fit together into a picture.  There was no sense in the dialogue of people really talking either, just of actors doing their best with the lines handed to them.  The musical score labors mightily start to finish to signal cuteness but there's little cute in the dialogue or the storyline; it's a mess.  Jennifer Lopez is an actress with a small, small range and a flatness to her performances because, I suspect, that's the best she can do within this framework.

I took nine girls from the my church youth group to go see the Wedding Planner. It was one of the biggest mistakes of my natural born life.Jennifer Lopez is non-involving, and McConauhey, seemingly AWOL since Amistad, is not to be spoken highly of in this film. The plot is simple: Lopez falls for a doctor(McConauhey) and he falls for her. There is a twist, or something like it, though. Lopez is supposed to marry this Italian puppy-dog of a man, a man who I actually rooted for. All seems doomed when........An hour or so later I was left rubbing my eyes and wondering why my feet were sticking to the floor of theatre. I assumed it was soda and candy spills that had created such a sticky mess but upon further review, I decided it was probably some other poor fella who had cried tears of dred and pain as he watched this movie with his wife. Can tears create such a sticky texture? I don't know. Maybe a doctor would know. Let's ask McConauhey...oh wait, he only plays one in this film.....kind of.Lopez is worth the price of admission. No, not in a fantasy sort of way but rather, in a humerous kind of way. Her character is laughable and her acting is second to everyone.Note to haters of the classic-chick-flick-genre, this film will destroy every ounce of masculine hormone your body has ever produced. Unless you're really trying to get your relationship back and a'hoppin, don't watch this.Ladies, this goes for you too. This is not your mother's chick flick. It's not Pretty Woman, My Best Friends Wedding, or even the fearless While You Were Sleeping. This is a code B chick flick, only the kind of chick flick you should watch during those extreme lapses of severe boredom. Please be warned.As for Puppy Dog boy, he is dealt the rawest deal. I liken him to the poor guy from Runaway Bride who is left by Roberts for Richard Gere.

535823,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00003CXSM,"John ""MovieAddict""","[2, 2]","Two words successfully describe &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;: Pee yew. With an exclamation mark. It's boring, contrived, silly and not very funny at all. Its two main stars, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, share absolutely no sense of chemistry whatsoever. The plot allows for devilishly funny situations that never arise from the recycled and visibly tired script. It's like sitting through a rerun of an old movie you've seen a million times before. And not a very good movie, for that matter.JHo - I mean, JLo - plays Mary, a wealthy wedding planner (hence the title) and control freak who is lonely and neglected in real life, forming no relationships for herself. That is, until she meets a doctor (McConaughey), who rescues her after she gets her high heel stuck in a pot hole in the middle of a busy highway. (Don't ask.) He takes her out to a fair and they dance and almost kiss.Then she finds out that he's engaged. Not only that, but he's engaged to one of her closest and friends. And, to top it all off, he's also her newest client - she has to organize his upcoming wedding. Then, his fiancee flies out of town for a week, leaving the two flirters together to sort out the wedding, and perhaps fall in love with each other during the process. But that will mean breaking up the wedding, right? Matters don't help that Mary soon becomes engaged herself to a man she has known since childhood. Why? Who cares? It's all part of the contrived plot I was ranting about earlier.First problem: The cast. JLo can't act. Not only that, there's no chemistry/sparks between her and McConaughey, who also can't act his way out of a paper bag (or from behind JLo's most famous behind, in this case). And she also can't handle the role of the Beautiful Lonely Single Female, a role Sandra Bullock can carry off because she doesn't act like a...well...JHo the entire time.I like romantic comedies, especially the entertaining and sweet kind. A romantic comedy doesn't have to wow me over with its plot or technical achievements; all I ask for are likable characters and an entertaining premise, recycled or not. Good evidence of this is &quot;Alex and Emma,&quot; a film I attended a screening of some small number of weeks ago. I enjoyed that film despite its many negative reviews because I found the characters sweet and the story entertaining. &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; is neither. It is both annoying and revolting, with unlikable characters (who come off as selfish and whiny as opposed to generous and optimistic) and a bad bundle of jokes.And as I stated above, &quot;The Wedding Planner's&quot; premise is like a rerun of another old romantic comedy - but not a very good one. The woman who has it all together is lacking love in her life; when she finally finds true love she can't have it. Quoting Dr. Evil, &quot;Boo-frickety-hoo.&quot;The movie was directed by Adam Shankman, who has directed &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002) and &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), the latter of which is very similar to this film and also quite unfunny at times. But at least &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; had a top-notch cast, and at least it made me laugh - if only a handful of times. &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; didn't make me laugh at all; it didn't make me care about its cute couple; it made me want to vomit. That's not a good trait for a romantic comedy that boasts how cute and funny it is. Quoting one of the most catchy taglines for a film ever, &quot;You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl.&quot; Take away the laughing part and you've got a two-sentence summary of this terribly mediocre movie.",2,"I like romantic comedies, but this made me want to puke...",1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3642,"['Two', 'words', 'successfully', 'describe', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'quot', 'Pee', 'yew', 'exclamation', 'mark', 'boring', 'contrived', 'silly', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'share', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'plot', 'devilishly', 'funny', 'situations', 'never', 'arise', 'recycled', 'visibly', 'tired', 'script', 'sitting', 'rerun', 'old', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'matter.JHo', 'mean', 'JLo', 'plays', 'Mary', 'wealthy', 'wedding', 'planner', 'hence', 'title', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'lonely', 'neglected', 'real', 'life', 'forming', 'relationships', 'herself', 'doctor', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'high', 'heel', 'stuck', 'pot', 'hole', 'middle', 'busy', 'highway', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'out', 'fair', 'dance', 'almost', 'kiss.Then', 'out', 'engaged', 'Not', 'only', 'engaged', 'one', 'closest', 'friends', 'top', 'off', 'also', 'newest', 'client', 'organize', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Then', 'fiancee', 'town', 'week', 'leaving', 'two', 'flirters', 'together', 'sort', 'out', 'wedding', 'perhaps', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'process', 'will', 'mean', 'breaking', 'up', 'wedding', 'right', 'Matters', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'Mary', 'soon', 'engaged', 'man', 'known', 'childhood', 'Why', 'Who', 'part', 'contrived', 'plot', 'was', 'ranting', 'earlier.First', 'problem', 'cast', 'JLo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Not', 'only', 'chemistry/sparks', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'JLo', 'most', 'famous', 'behind', 'case', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'role', 'Beautiful', 'Lonely', 'Single', 'Female', 'role', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'can', 'carry', 'off', ""n't"", 'act', 'well', 'JHo', 'entire', 'time.I', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'sweet', 'kind', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'wow', 'plot', 'technical', 'achievements', 'ask', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'premise', 'recycled', 'not', 'Good', 'evidence', 'quot', 'Alex', 'Emma', 'quot', 'film', 'attended', 'screening', 'small', 'number', 'weeks', 'ago', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'found', 'characters', 'sweet', 'story', 'entertaining', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'quot', 'annoying', 'revolting', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'selfish', 'whiny', 'opposed', 'generous', 'optimistic', 'bad', 'bundle', 'jokes.And', 'stated', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'quot', 'premise', 'rerun', 'old', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'together', 'lacking', 'love', 'life', 'when', 'finally', 'true', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Quoting', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'quot', 'Boo-frickety-hoo.', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'who', 'directed', 'quot', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'quot', '2002', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'quot', '2003', 'latter', 'very', 'similar', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'unfunny', 'times', 'least', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'quot', 'had', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'least', 'made', 'only', 'handful', 'times', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'care', 'cute', 'couple', 'made', 'want', 'vomit', 'not', 'good', 'trait', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'how', 'cute', 'funny', 'Quoting', 'one', 'most', 'catchy', 'taglines', 'film', 'ever', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'cry', ""'ll"", 'hurl.', 'quot', 'Take', 'away', 'laughing', 'part', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two-sentence', 'summary', 'terribly', 'mediocre', 'movie']",N/A

Her acting style and personality fit well with the character, and makes the whole movie work.Jennifer plays Mary Fiore, an intelligent and very good wedding planner.  We see multiple examples of Mary's ability to organize and plan for complex weddings, from the biggest and most complex activity down to the minutest detail.  Mary always has a contingency for every situation.Because of Mary's position, and how the weddings she plans always happen so successfully, Mary is envied by many.  However, the truth is that Mary's personal life is dull.  As Mary says, ""Those who can't do, teach.  Those who can't wed, plan.""  Another old saying also appropriate is, ""Always a bridesmaid and never a bride,"" with the substitution of wedding planner.Into Mary's life comes Dr. Steven Edison (Matthew McConaughey).  Through one of those bizarre coincidences that generally happen only in the movies, Dr. Steve saves Mary from a runaway dumpster hit by a cabbie who was trying to retrieve ice cream that had fallen from a cone.  It takes Mary some time to discover that the guy that has saved her life and to whom she is attracted is going to be the groom for the biggest wedding she has ever planned.  The rest of the movie involves maneuvering between Dr. Steve, Mary, and Fan Donolly (Bridgette Wilson), Dr. Steve's future bride, until we reach the rather unlikely, somewhat humorous, and moderately predictable end of the movie.This movie is less than perfect.  All the characters treat each other too nicely, even when they are being ""mean.""  Everything works out a little too nicely, even given all the coincidences.  Ultimately the movie is a romantic fantasy, with a fair amount of humor that works.  Of course, the movie is intended to be a sort of Cinderella story, though Cinderella in this case is pretty and intelligent, and knows how to handle herself in the business world.  While some may complain the movie is trite, it does work, it does make you feel good, and I enjoyed the movie well enough to smile at the ending and to want to watch it a second time.",4,"Fun, Light, Romantic Comedy",1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,2117,"['movie', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'acting', 'style', 'personality', 'fit', 'well', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'work.Jennifer', 'Mary', 'Fiore', 'intelligent', 'very', 'good', 'wedding', 'planner', 'see', 'multiple', 'examples', 'Mary', 'ability', 'organize', 'plan', 'complex', 'weddings', 'biggest', 'most', 'complex', 'activity', 'down', 'minutest', 'detail', 'Mary', 'always', 'contingency', 'situation.Because', 'Mary', 'position', 'how', 'weddings', 'always', 'happen', 'so', 'successfully', 'Mary', 'envied', 'many', 'However', 'truth', 'Mary', 'personal', 'life', 'dull', 'Mary', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'teach', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wed', 'plan', 'old', 'saying', 'also', 'appropriate', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'substitution', 'wedding', 'planner.Into', 'Mary', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Steven', 'Edison', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'one', 'bizarre', 'coincidences', 'generally', 'only', 'movies', 'Dr.', 'Steve', 'Mary', 'runaway', 'dumpster', 'hit', 'cabbie', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'ice', 'cream', 'had', 'fallen', 'cone', 'Mary', 'time', 'discover', 'guy', 'saved', 'life', 'whom', 'attracted', 'going', 'be', 'groom', 'biggest', 'wedding', 'ever', 'planned', 'rest', 'movie', 'maneuvering', 'Dr.', 'Steve', 'Mary', 'Fan', 'Donolly', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'Dr.', 'Steve', 'future', 'bride', 'reach', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'somewhat', 'humorous', 'moderately', 'predictable', 'end', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'less', 'perfect', 'characters', 'treat', 'other', 'too', 'nicely', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'mean', 'Everything', 'out', 'little', 'too', 'nicely', 'even', 'given', 'coincidences', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'fair', 'amount', 'humor', 'course', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'sort', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'case', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'how', 'handle', 'business', 'world', 'may', 'complain', 'movie', 'trite', 'work', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'well', 'enough', 'smile', 'ending', 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",N/A

Jennifer's hair stylist made sure that she had such an ordinary style that it underplayed her beauty and her sensuality, helping her style fit the role of Mary.

If it is true that the course of Mary's and Steve's true love never runs smooth, it is also true that the predictable unfolding of the paper thin plot is far more humorous than one might think, thanks to the chemistry between Lopez and McConaughy.  What the movie suggests as a subtext is that leaving oneself open to the uncertainties of love necessarily entails about an equal chance of pleasure as pain.  The pairing of Mary with her unwanted Italian suitor gives the flip side of the pleasure that the audience feels sure is inevitable with Mary and Steve.  For this earnest and decent Italian, love is an emotion worth the risk.For Mary and Steve, it was worth the risk too, but it could pay off only for two of the three.  Beneath the sugary ending of forced happy endings, love is truly a gamble, even if the odds are stacked against you.",3,Weddings--like life--Are a Gamble,1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,1584,"['one', 'will', 'ever', 'confuse', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'PLANNER', 'timeless', 'movie', 'dangers', 'marrying', 'someone', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'someone', 'whom', 'know', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'Director', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'nevertheless', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'deals', 'such', 'somber', 'elements', 'basic', 'compatibility', 'while', 'deflecting', 'audience', 'attention', 'fluff', 'plot', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Mary', 'woman', 'job', 'big', 'time', 'wedding', 'planner', 'distance', 'distant', 'rumblings', 'own', 'never', 'be', 'marriage', 'Enter', 'Matthew', 'McConaughy', 'Steve', 'who', 'set', 'marry', 'surface', 'perfect', 'woman', 'bright', 'bouncy', 'blonde', 'Further', 'enter', 'young', 'Italian', 'whom', 'father', 'chosen', 'Mary', 'husband', 'true', 'course', 'Mary', 'Steve', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'smooth', 'also', 'true', 'predictable', 'unfolding', 'paper', 'thin', 'plot', 'far', 'more', 'humorous', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'thanks', 'chemistry', 'Lopez', 'McConaughy', 'What', 'movie', 'subtext', 'leaving', 'open', 'uncertainties', 'love', 'necessarily', 'equal', 'chance', 'pleasure', 'pain', 'pairing', 'Mary', 'unwanted', 'Italian', 'suitor', 'flip', 'side', 'pleasure', 'audience', 'feels', 'sure', 'inevitable', 'Mary', 'Steve', 'earnest', 'decent', 'Italian', 'love', 'emotion', 'risk.For', 'Mary', 'Steve', 'was', 'worth', 'risk', 'too', 'could', 'pay', 'off', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'sugary', 'ending', 'forced', 'happy', 'endings', 'love', 'truly', 'gamble', 'even', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked']",N/A

I rented it for my wife since most of my movies as of recent have been mostly for me. However, I tried to keep an open mind and give it a fair shake. Unfortunately, this movie just sucked. First time director and first time screenwriters, what can you expect?The script was just not believable. I know that romantic comedies have the liberty of taking some license here and there, but I just didn't buy so much of this movie that the whole thing just seemed fake. For starters, we're supposed to believe that Jennifer Lopez is an Italian immigrant? Come on! Her father (Alex Rocco (I)) doesn't sound Italian, he sounds retarded. I don't even know why she had to be an immigrant. There was nothing in the plot that required her being from another country, except for the fact that her father trys to arrange a marriage, which was just another unnecessary plot device. There's just so much that was wrong with this script, I'm just amazed that the leading actors signed on to this project.The talent in this movie was fairly decent. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey had some chemistry and they looked good together. Kathy Najimy is a wonderful comedic actress and her scene with Jennifer was very good and believable. Fred Willard, and Kevin Pollak are the other actors that do comedic roles extremely well, but their talents were simply not tapped. They did what they could, but they simply had nothing to work with.

535847,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXSM,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","The week that The Wedding Planner opened, its star, Jennifer Lopez, set some firsts. The movie came in at number one, and so did her new CD. Rarely before had a popular performer managed such a feat. The album is fairly memorable, but, alas, the movie is not at all. It should soon fade into oblivion. Perhaps the best thing about it is that is offers further proof that Ms. Lopez can act.When it opens, Maria [Lopez], who plans weddings for a living, is orchestrating a lavish one. She pulls the big event off smoothly, and then goes home. Here we see that, outside of her profession, Maria doesn't have much excitment in her life. She lives alone and has nothing better to do with her spare time than to eat some takeout food and watch TV or to join her father and his friends at their Scrabble club. One day she is crossing a street and gets the heel of one of her new Gucci shoes caught in a manhole cover. While she tries to free her shoe, she is nearly run over by a runaway dumpster. She is saved by the handsome Steve [Michael McConaughey], who is a successful pediatrician. That night they have a romantic, but chaste, date in a park. At first it looks as though Maria has found Mr. Right, but the next day she finds out that Steve is the fiance of her newest and richest client. Meanwhile, her father, an Italian immigrant, decides that Massimo [Justin Chambers], a boy she knew as a child in Italy, is perfect for her. This sets up one of the oldest plots in the romantic comedy genre. A girl is in love with a man who isn't available while being pursued by a nice guy she doesn't love.The problem with The Wedding Planner isn't the tried and true story line. There are, after all, only a few acceptable themes in romantic comedy. The problem is with the dialog. The screenplay is not outrageous enough to be a screwball comedy, not racy enough to be an adult comedy and not clever enough to be laugh-out-loud funny. It is simply bland, which is a problem in any kind of movie.I suspect that Ms. Lopez was drawn to the part because her character is a prim, buttoned up type, the opposite of the star's real life image. Playing against type, she does a fine job, but this is not enough to carry such a lightweight story. McConaughey drawls his way through his role, playing Steve so limply that it's hard to see the attraction. Bridgett Wilson-Sampas is good as Steve's intended, Fran, who only thinks she wants him. What few great comic moments there are belong to Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough as Fran's out to lunch parents, and to Justin Chambers as Massimo.You know a movie is in trouble when it constantly reminds you of other, more memorable movies. I kept thinking about Hepburn and Tracy or about Doris Day and Rock Hudson. I remembered how witty and outrageous some of their movies were.

I haven't seen Enough yet, but it's on my wishlist, and I've seen the trailer, it actually looks really good. And of course, on this, she just has to get one of her songs on the soundtrack - this time it was ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"".What's good about this movie, is how obsessive, neat, and organised J-Lo is. She's always ready for any eventuality in her job as a wedding planner, and even at home, she's the exact same. Everything appears to be at perfect right angles etc. It's like Monica Geller all over again.I'm not that big a fan of Matthew McConaughey (FYI, I'm copying & pasting that!) There is no chemistry/sparks between him & J-Lo, and he also can't act his way out of a paper bag. He's not the worst thing about this movie actually, every joke is forced and completely unoriginal. The classic romcom types are all present and correct: the ethnic, overprotective father; the vapid fianc&eacute;e; the matchmaker best friend etc. And J-Lo is playing an Italian, when it's perfectly obvious she's so NOT. Very miscast in this movie, the actor playing her father looks more Italian than she does.Apart from J-Lo, there are two fantastic actresses in this. Judy Greer, who always seems to play the supporting actress in any movie I've seen her in, and never gets the lead (13 Going On 30 and What Women Want, for example). Joanna Gleason is the other fantastic actress, she's so funny, especially when she's singing, and J-Lo's horse takes off due to the singing! It took a while for me to place her, but of course, she was in Friends! She played Kim, one of Rachel's bosses at Ralph Lauren. She's also done quite a few voices in King Of The Hill.Possibly don't see for J-Lo, but for the supporting actors around her, especially Judy Greer, and Joanna Gleason. Oh, and one of the bigger nuns with the HUGE voice from Sister Act appears in two scenes, with a dreadful short blonde hairstyle. She was also in Rat Race, what's her name?! Mary Wickes? I think? Nope, she's dead. Wrong nun. Kathy Najimy! I'll get there eventually.

The review says they're all too nice.  But I think that no one wants to step on each other's toes and reveal something.

While this may not be the best movie that I have seen from this genre, I was pleased with it as it lived up to my expectations.Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is one of the best wedding planners, but leads a solitude life outside her work by spending time with her father playing scrabble. One day a man saves her life from a runaway dumpster, and Mary starts getting feelings for him. Mary's friend Penny (Judy Greer) sets up Mary and Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) the doctor who saved her life, on a date. Just when Mary feels like she has found Mr. Perfect, she finds out that Steve is the groom for one of the weddings that she is planning! Furthermore, her father sets her up with Massimo (Justin Chambers), a man Mary doesn't want to get involved with.This movie had a lot of funny moments like:i. every scene with Penny in it. It was such a delight to see Judy Greer play a comedy role for once. I've only seen her play negative roles in movies like `Cursed' and '13 Going on 30' and it was such a change to see how funny she was here.ii. When Massimo and Steve try to out beat each other in the beginning. Actually, even Justin Chambers who played Massimo was funny in most of the scenes.iii. The horse riding scene. It was hilarious to see Mary trying to control the crazed horse.Director Adam Shankman (who also directed `A Walk To Remember') did a fine job in this movie. Okay, Okay, so the story is predictable, and the actors overdid their Italian accents, but you cannot help but feel for them while you are watching it. Jennifer Lopez, Judy Greer, Justin Chambers, Alex Rocco and everyone else did a great job for their roles. I was a little disappointed with Matthew McConaughey since he kept portraying the same clueless looks and emotions throughout the movie, but he didn't too such a bad job either.In short, this is a breezy romantic comedy that anyone would enjoy watching.

535865,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXSM,Reviewer,"[2, 5]","The first question you have to ask about this movie is, what is the target audience supposed to be?  In what may be a most telling scene, when the main character has an accident and wakes up in the hospital, she just happens to be in the pediatric ward; perhaps giving those to whom this insipid drivel would appeal something with which to relate?  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  In regards to ""The Wedding Planner,"" directed (more or less) by Adam Shankman, that last comment should've been reserved for later, but by then I may have had to make it ""cliche-ridden"" insipid drivel.  Actually, early on this film seemed to have some promise; but then the opening credits ended and it was all downhill from there.  It may ring of paranoia, but the makers of this movie-- though unable to deny responsibility since they did, in fact, make it-- may have been able to make a case that they had been the victims of a conspiracy of sorts, beginning with the cast they assembled to bring it all to life.  I can think of no other movie that boasts such a grossly unappealing, miscast bunch of actors, beginning with Alex Rocco as Salvatore, the father of Mary Fiore, the character played by Jennifer Lopez.  Mull that over for just a moment, if you will; Rocco as Lopez's father....  For the life of me, I cannot understand Jennifer Lopez; she's beautiful and talented, and seemingly bent on making as many mistakes, career-wise, as she possibly can.  Perhaps I should make that ""artistic"" mistakes, since with her singing career and being given the opportunity to make movies (even ones like this) she is probably going to be very materially well-off, even if she continues to do nothing of artistic merit for the rest of her life.  Maybe when the teenyboppers have grown tired of her (which shouldn't be too long) and she realizes that she will only be able to invade Brittany Spears territory so far, she will go back to what she is really good at, making movies like ""Selena,"" and ""Out Of Sight,"" in which she demonstrated what kind of acting chops she has.  How ironic that in this film she plays a wedding planner, when what she needs in real life is a ""career planner"" for herself.  It just seems like such a shame that ""J. Lo"" has taken the fast-track to fame and fortune instead of employing her myriad gifts to better purpose.  That she looks attractive in this film cannot be denied, but neither can it be denied that as far as her acting, it was nothing more than a walk-through for her.  Matthew McConaughey, meanwhile, winds up in even murkier waters than Lopez here, with his portrayal of Dr. Steve ""Eddie"" Edison, the character whom circumstances bring into contact with Mary Fiore at a pivotal point in his life.  He is engaged to Fran (Bridgette Wilson), but begins to have second thoughts about it after his encounter with Mary.  The plot line gets pretty complicated after that, and for anyone who has trouble keeping up with it, I can only suggest that they confer with some of those currently residing in that pediatric ward.  Any charm, charisma or screen presence McConaughey has must have been checked at the gate when he signed on for this one, because a more flat, uninspired performance you are unlikely to find without looking real hard.  Hold that thought; can anyone say Chris O'Donnell in ""The Bachelor?""  And the lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Lopez is stupefying; interestingly enough, he has even less with Wilson.  The producers would've had to bring in truckloads of rocks and flint to ignite any sparks on this set.  The supporting cast includes Justin Chambers (Massimo), Judy Greer (Penny), Joanna Gleason (Mrs. Donolly), Charles Kimbrough (Mr. Donolly), Fred Willard (Basil St. Mosely), Kathy Najimy (Geri) and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Dojny (but don't blink or you'll miss him).  Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about ""The Wedding Planner"" is that it makes even the mediocre movies look good.  It's always a huge disappointment to see talent, the likes of which are involved here, go to waste in such an unmitigated debacle as this.  It would be so satisfying to see Jennifer Lopez, especially, in a project worthy of what she has to offer, and of which she is capable; as an audience, we can only hope that she gets some good advice about the direction of her career, and that she will have the guts to listen to and act upon it.",1,"Was That Jennifer Lopez, Or Brittany Spears...",983145600,"02 26, 2001",2001,4387,"['first', 'question', 'have', 'ask', 'movie', 'what', 'target', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'telling', 'scene', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'accident', 'up', 'hospital', 'just', 'be', 'pediatric', 'ward', 'perhaps', 'giving', 'whom', 'insipid', 'drivel', 'would', 'appeal', 'something', 'relate', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'regards', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'directed', 'more', 'less', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'last', 'comment', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reserved', 'later', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'cliche-ridden', 'insipid', 'drivel', 'Actually', 'early', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'promise', 'then', 'opening', 'credits', 'ended', 'was', 'downhill', 'there', 'may', 'ring', 'paranoia', 'makers', 'movie', 'unable', 'deny', 'responsibility', 'did', 'fact', 'make', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'case', 'had', 'been', 'victims', 'conspiracy', 'sorts', 'beginning', 'cast', 'assembled', 'bring', 'life', 'can', 'think', 'other', 'movie', 'grossly', 'unappealing', 'miscast', 'bunch', 'actors', 'beginning', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'Salvatore', 'father', 'Mary', 'Fiore', 'character', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Mull', 'just', 'moment', 'will', 'Rocco', 'Lopez', 'father', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'seemingly', 'bent', 'making', 'many', 'mistakes', 'career-wise', 'possibly', 'can', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'make', 'artistic', 'mistakes', 'singing', 'career', 'being', 'given', 'opportunity', 'make', 'movies', 'even', 'ones', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'materially', 'well-off', 'even', 'do', 'nothing', 'artistic', 'merit', 'rest', 'life', 'Maybe', 'when', 'teenyboppers', 'have', 'grown', 'tired', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'long', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'invade', 'Brittany', 'Spears', 'territory', 'so', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'making', 'movies', 'Selena', 'Out', 'Sight', 'demonstrated', 'what', 'kind', 'acting', 'chops', 'How', 'ironic', 'film', 'wedding', 'planner', 'when', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'career', 'planner', 'just', 'shame', 'J', 'Lo', 'taken', 'fast-track', 'fame', 'fortune', 'instead', 'employing', 'myriad', 'gifts', 'better', 'purpose', 'attractive', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'can', 'be', 'denied', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'walk-through', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'meanwhile', 'up', 'even', 'murkier', 'waters', 'Lopez', 'here', 'portrayal', 'Dr.', 'Steve', 'Eddie', 'Edison', 'character', 'whom', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'contact', 'Mary', 'Fiore', 'pivotal', 'point', 'life', 'engaged', 'Fran', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'encounter', 'Mary', 'plot', 'line', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'anyone', 'who', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'can', 'only', 'suggest', 'confer', 'currently', 'residing', 'pediatric', 'ward', 'charm', 'charisma', 'screen', 'presence', 'McConaughey', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'checked', 'gate', 'when', 'signed', 'one', 'more', 'flat', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'are', 'unlikely', 'find', 'looking', 'real', 'hard', 'Hold', 'thought', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Bachelor', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'McConaughey', 'Lopez', 'stupefying', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'even', 'less', 'Wilson', 'producers', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bring', 'truckloads', 'rocks', 'flint', 'ignite', 'sparks', 'set', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'Massimo', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Penny', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'Mrs.', 'Donolly', 'Charles', 'Kimbrough', 'Mr.', 'Donolly', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Basil', 'St.', 'Mosely', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'Geri', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Dr.', 'Dojny', 'do', ""n't"", 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'even', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'look', 'good', 'always', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'see', 'talent', 'likes', 'are', 'involved', 'here', 'go', 'waste', 'such', 'unmitigated', 'debacle', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'satisfying', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'especially', 'project', 'worthy', 'what', 'offer', 'capable', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'good', 'advice', 'direction', 'career', 'will', 'have', 'guts', 'listen', 'act']",N/A

535868,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CXSM,Robert Moore,"[3, 4]","I REALLY wanted to see this film when it came out in the theaters, and then anxiously awaited its release on DVD.  the movie looks like something that was perfect for me.  I am a passionate fan of romantic comedies, and I have enjoyed Jennifer Lopez in nearly all her films.The good news is that she was fine in this movie.  She was cute as a button, charming, convincing, and someone you really come to care for and feel with as a character.  The bad news is that the screenplay really hurt the movie as a whole.There is a traditional way of doing romantic comedies.  Boy (or girl) meets girl (or boy).  Boy gets girl.  Boy loses girl.  Boy gets girl back.  In recent years, filmmakers haven't been content with this formula, but instead want to keep us on our toes about that final &quot;Boy gets girl back.&quot;  The film that really solidified this for us in recent years was MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING.  And I suspect that the screenwriters of THE WEDDING PLANNING imagined that we had all seen that &quot;other&quot; wedding movie (though FORCES OF NATURE, a much lesser film, also plays a number of variations on the traditional wedding comedy).  Yet another wedding comedy, THE RUNAWAY BRIDE, also engages in some of this &quot;Do the guy and girl really get together in the end&quot; revisionism.This attempt to keep us on our toes seems to be to be a major mistake.  The point of a formula like &quot;Boy meets girl, etc.&quot; is seeing how well the screenplay and director deal with the limitations imposed by that formula.  In the greatest romantic comedies, the ingenuity in dealing with how the couple inevitably get back together is at least part of the delight of the movie.  Compare these recent wedding movies with THE PALM BEACH STORY or THE PHILADELPHIA STORY or THE AWFUL TRUTH or THE LADY EVE or IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT.  But more recently the trend has been to shake up the genre itself.  THE WEDDING PLANNER, therefore, becomes Girl Meets Boy, Girl Loses Boy, Girl Nearly Gets Boy Back, Girl Decides to Get Another Guy, Guy Decides to Stick with His Original Girl, etc., etc.  The film gets very messy with the result that through the last half of this film, I was seriously stressed about who was going to end up with whom, and was starting to feel pain for whoever was going to get hurt (and the fact that no one gets hurt in this film lends to the overall artificiality of the plot).By the end of the film, I found myself not caring who ended up with whom, but instead just didn't want anyone to get hurt.  And I felt that neither the getting together nor the not getting hurt were handled well.The effect of this film is (1) to make me hope Jennifer Lopez does more, and better, comedies in the future and (2) that those writing screenplays for romantic comedies go back and study some of the old classics, and give some serious thought as to why they were so successful.",3,"High expectations, but a mildly disappointing film",995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,2897,"['REALLY', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'then', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'release', 'DVD', 'movie', 'something', 'was', 'perfect', 'am', 'passionate', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'nearly', 'films.The', 'good', 'news', 'was', 'fine', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'button', 'charming', 'convincing', 'someone', 'really', 'come', 'care', 'feel', 'character', 'bad', 'news', 'screenplay', 'really', 'hurt', 'movie', 'whole.There', 'traditional', 'way', 'doing', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy', 'Boy', 'girl', 'Boy', 'girl', 'Boy', 'girl', 'back', 'recent', 'years', 'filmmakers', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'content', 'formula', 'instead', 'want', 'keep', 'toes', 'final', 'quot', 'Boy', 'girl', 'back.', 'quot', 'film', 'really', 'solidified', 'recent', 'years', 'was', 'MY', 'BEST', 'FRIEND', 'WEDDING', 'suspect', 'screenwriters', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'PLANNING', 'imagined', 'had', 'seen', 'quot', 'other', 'quot', 'wedding', 'movie', 'FORCES', 'OF', 'NATURE', 'much', 'lesser', 'film', 'also', 'number', 'variations', 'traditional', 'wedding', 'comedy', 'wedding', 'comedy', 'RUNAWAY', 'BRIDE', 'also', 'quot', 'Do', 'guy', 'girl', 'really', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'quot', 'attempt', 'keep', 'toes', 'be', 'be', 'major', 'mistake', 'point', 'formula', 'quot', 'Boy', 'girl', 'etc.', 'quot', 'seeing', 'how', 'well', 'screenplay', 'director', 'deal', 'limitations', 'imposed', 'formula', 'greatest', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ingenuity', 'dealing', 'how', 'couple', 'inevitably', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'least', 'part', 'delight', 'movie', 'Compare', 'recent', 'wedding', 'movies', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'THE', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'STORY', 'THE', 'AWFUL', 'TRUTH', 'THE', 'LADY', 'EVE', 'IT', 'HAPPENED', 'ONE', 'NIGHT', 'more', 'recently', 'trend', 'been', 'shake', 'up', 'genre', 'WEDDING', 'PLANNER', 'therefore', 'Girl', 'Meets', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Loses', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Nearly', 'Gets', 'Boy', 'Back', 'Girl', 'Decides', 'Get', 'Guy', 'Guy', 'Decides', 'Stick', 'Original', 'Girl', 'etc.', 'etc', 'film', 'very', 'messy', 'result', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'seriously', 'stressed', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'whom', 'was', 'starting', 'feel', 'pain', 'whoever', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'hurt', 'fact', 'one', 'hurt', 'film', 'overall', 'artificiality', 'plot', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'whom', 'instead', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'get', 'hurt', 'felt', 'getting', 'together', 'not', 'getting', 'hurt', 'were', 'handled', 'well.The', 'effect', 'film', '1', 'make', 'hope', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'more', 'better', 'comedies', 'future', '2', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'back', 'study', 'old', 'classics', 'give', 'serious', 'thought', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'successful']",N/A
535869,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXSM,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 8]","""The Wedding Planner"" has all the originality, credibility and wit of a bad TV sitcom.  The film boasts a storyline so hoary and wheezy that one could probably trace its antecedents all the way back to that marvelous 1934 classic ""It Happened One Night"" - if not indeed even further back than that.  It's the oldie about the bride-or-groom-to-be who discovers just at that crucial last moment, when all the guests have gathered for the wedding, that he or she is actually marrying the wrong person and that his or her real, honest-to-God genuine true love is just out there waiting in the wings ready for the taking.  ""The Wedding Planner"" doubles our pleasure by having TWO such disastrous weddings happening at the same time.Like far too many lazy romantic comedies, ""The Wedding Planner"" is based on a premise so reeking of incredibility, coincidence and contrivance that any attempt to connect it to the real world vanishes at the outset (and before you accuse me of being an unromantic and of not understanding that suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient in any film in the romantic comedy genre, I will just point to the brilliant 1967 film ""Two For the Road"" as evidence that this does not have to be the case).  Jennifer Lopez plays Mary Fiore, a hotshot wedding planner so absorbed in the minutiae of her work that she just can't seem to find the time or the inclination to look for Mr. Right herself.  One day she is ""rescued"" from near-death - in a scene of stultifying stupidity - by a handsome pediatrics doctor named Steve, played by Matthew McConaughey.  A feeling of mutual attraction develops between them, which leads to heady complications when, to Mary's utter amazement (but to no one else's in the audience), Dr. Steve turns out to be the fianc&eacute;e of the very woman whose wedding Mary has been planning.  As always, the well-intentioned characters struggle with the complexities of the situation, momentarily consider the feelings of their future spouses, then immediately run off and do what's best for themselves anyway.  And why is it that, in situations such as this one, those rejected suitors always turn out to be either so self-absorbed and hateful that we don't care a bit if they're hurt by the wedding day turnabout, or so completely self-negating and understanding that they end up happily wishing the newly formed couple bon voyage with the rest of their friends and family?  Either way the audience is let off the hook and we are free to root for our two main characters with a clear conscience.  Some genres just have hopeless conventions I guess.One could conceivably overlook the mountain of clich&eacute;s under which the story lies buried had the film at least managed to bring even a touch of freshness, style and wit to its execution.  Instead, we are subjected to an assortment of silly, lowbrow antics such as Mary finding herself on an out-of-control horse so that Steve can ride along and rescue her, or Steve breaking off the genitals of a statue and having to hold the newly glued piece on while talking to a policeman.  The dialogue doesn't help to raise the sophistication level of the film much either.Where ""The Wedding Planner"" really falls down, however, is in the performance department.  Jennifer Lopez appears to be a reasonably likable and attractive young woman, but she seems hopelessly puerile and amateurish both in her line readings and in her body language.  McConaughey is his usual blank self, and virtually every supporting player is forced to indulge in the broadest sort of comic overacting in a desperate attempt to wring at least SOME laughs out of this tired material.The way I look at it is this:  if you have seen ""Runaway Bride"" - yet another bad romantic comedy - you've already seen ""The Wedding Planner.""

She hasn't had good luck finding anyone for herself to marry, so she has become one of the most successful wedding planners in California. All at once, Mary lands the biggest wedding of her planning career and meets the man of her dreams when he saves her shoe and her life from a run away dumpster. Mary and bride to be Fran become friends as they plan Fran and Eddy's wedding. Mary also has the best night of her life in the park with Steve the doctor who saved her life. The next day, she meets Fran's fianc&eacute; Eddy. Much to her surprise, &quot;Eddy&quot; turns out to Doctor Steve whom Mary has fallen in love with. Now she must push though planning the wedding having broken the number one rule of wedding planning - Do Not Fall In Love With The Groom!My Opinion:  This is a light hearted uncomplicated romantic comedy. It never tries to be anything else. It wasn't made to be anything else. As such, it succeeds in making you laugh, and entertaining you for 104 minutes. Everyone is nice and things are fairly predictable but this is made pretty obvious by the movie trailers and descriptions.  To be disappointed because it wasn't a complicated epic like &quot;The English Patient&quot; is unfair. I enjoyed both Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey. They both were very enjoyable and likeable.DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1, DD 5.1. Many extra features including deleted scenes that show how the movie evolved.What You Should Do:  See it if you like romantic comedies and are in the mood for a nice, cute movie.

Its so mundane and unoriginal and completely not funny. Jennifer Lopez is a one character actor. Honestly. There is no range with her. People pay money to see her films, but really, they are just watching the same movie over and over again. Everyone who watches this movie will know what will happen at the end. Its a given. There is no need for obstacles or pointless drama. Romantic comedies are *almost* all the same. Same characters, same ending. However, what makes this one even more unbearable is the fact that once again, Jennifer Lopez is in it.

I don't care, I'm right out with it, Jennifer Lopez, in my opinion, is one of today's great talents.The Wedding Planner is a sweet and mindless comedy about a woman whose job it is to plan other people's weddings. She's been hurt in the past, and has closed her heart to any thought of her own romance, but she's wonderful at executing the most spectacular of fairytale weddings.Along comes a mismatched couple if there ever was one. Matthew McConaughey is the hapless groom, whose low-key, even temperament is no match for his social climbing, obnoxious (but beautiful) bride-to-be. Lopez is hired to plan the wedding. Lopez and McConaughey are attracted. Each tries to deny it. And the ending is inevitable.To me, this easy-to-watch video is as satisfying as a well-written romance in print, the kind you want to curl up and devour. I have done so with this movie about 5 times now, and I still love it. On the intelligence meter, it probably deserves a 1. On the enjoyment meter, a good, solid 10. Indulge yourself.
