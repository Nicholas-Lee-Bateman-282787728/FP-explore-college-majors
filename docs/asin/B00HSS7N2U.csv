1691943,A2855Z4ZIDUF91,B00HSS7N2U,Mr Doug Gordon,"[0, 0]","In this day of sequels & remakes, it's refreshing to see that African-American independent film making is still flourishing.  Mark Harris-Writer/Director/Producer, doesn't disappoint his audience in this romantic comedy with a thought provoking message, which everyone can truly identify with.  The film follows Robert (Darrin Dewitt Henson of &#34;Soul Food&#34; TV series, &#34;Being Mary Jane&#34; & many more) who quickly finds out he's fired from his painter position.  This starts the ball rolling to find his true calling, for both his career & private life.  Other cast members include Gabrielle Dennis (&#34;The Game&#34;) as Morgan-Robert's love interest.  Lamman Rucker (&#34;Why Did I Get Married 1 & Too&#34;) as Morgan's ex-husband, Erica Hubbard (&#34;Let's Stay Together&#34;) as Robert's &#34;no romance without the finance&#34; ex-girlfriend & Christian Keyes (&#34;Let's Stay Together&#34;) as Robert's entrepreneurial cousin, plus the additional supporting cast bring this movie to life and add a genuine flavour.  Cinematography, lighting & sound are all on-point too, making this film entertaining and easy to watch.  Most importantly, for DVD purchasing, this movie has a high re-watchability factor to it as well.  DVD production is 5 stars too. Disc features excellent production and manufacturing. Keep case comes inserted in a movie artwork protector sleeve for a nice added touch.  Master video transfer is crisp & clean looking with excellent sound.  Extras include behind the scenes interviews with Mark Harris & cast members, plus a photo gallery.  If you're a fan of independent films, especially movies made by African-American Producers/Directors/Writers, like I am, then you will really enjoy this film.
