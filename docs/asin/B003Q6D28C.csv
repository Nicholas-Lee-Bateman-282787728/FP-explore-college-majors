1357471,A3TP31S61PPE3G,B003Q6D28C,AlexJouJou,"[6, 10]","I saw this film on a plane. I think I spent the entire time it was showing with my mouth open - possibly drooling because I don't really know if I remembered to swallow! I was mesmerized!I'm a parent of two kids. I have a lot of experience with their education here in SoCal. California is so broke that I just received a notice that the number of kids per class will hit 30 for K-3 next year. No teacher can effectively teach that many kids. The state of education in this country has quietly approached nuclear meltdown - and most of us don't know it.My take away from this film is ABSOLUTELY the same thing I think many of us have known for years - It is the TEACHERS that make a difference!I homeschooled my daughter in Kindergarten and she attended a public charter school in 1st grade where it was part homeschooling but there were classes one day a week (regular and elective sort).  She entered 2nd grade ahead of all her peers by leaps and miles. Her second grade teacher, by October, had relegated her to tutoring the other kids - she already knew all the curriculum. She already read and comprehended, did higher grade level math, and understood many science concepts. While part of this was due to her intelligence the important of my careful teaching at home (which I dedicated a great deal of time, money, and effort too by the way - I did no different than any teacher could and SHOULD do) and the public charter school put her in a position to be years ahead of the other 2nd graders. The latter part of 2nd grade had a test that all kids took to test into gifted and talented education (The Raven I believe). My daughter tested at the 99.7% and was offered a spot in the Seminar program. This is for the highest test takers - and it sets up a child basically through high school to be in this special program. After a great deal of deliberation I placed her in the 3rd grade Seminar class. She sailed through that next year. Up until then she had very good teachers who did try with her - they got her vested and motivated and wanting to learn. They challenged her - and found ways to engage her.Then 4th grade came. Difference was night and day. This new teacher sent home notes stating my daughter was lazy, could not pay attention, and was clearly in the wrong program. Unfortunately he also communicated that to my daughter. It was an awful year. An average of 4-5 hours of homework a night for my 10 year old. Tears, shouting, headaches and stomaches. I attempted to take a complaint about the teacher higher. Guess what? He had tenure. We were stuck. We couldn't move schools or she would have had to give up the program. This experience taught me that all this film is about is TRUE. The teacher was protected from virtually any action - in short nothing was gonna get him out. As a single mom I did not have enough money to send my daughter to a private school. I had no options. The damage to my daughter from this year we still feel - particularly in math. The teacher convinced my daughter she was not good at math and took a child that tested at 6th and 7th grade level math to a place where everything she did she questioned. This is an awful thing to do to a child. I did all I could at home - but some things resonate deep.Thankfully she is now going into high school and, outside of that one year, she continues to be a mostly straight A student with B's in - you guessed it - MATH. The film - in showing what a difference a teacher can make - is so incredibly and powerfully RIGHT that it highlights just how WRONG our current system is! While the whole concept of tenure might have started off right it took a dramatic left turn and we are now left with this inefficient and harmful system where the best and the brightest get NOTHING - little recognition, no extra pay, maybe a shot at a teacher of the year but that's one of many. We MUST change this - Children ARE our future - and I've watched while every year we seem to get further and further behind.I work at a university. Our incoming freshman write and do math at a level I surpassed in 9th grade 30 years ago. Go to any place that has teens working - they cannot even make change! They have to look at the cash register to tell how much to give back and if they mess it up they give you a deer in the headlights look.And the really sad thing is that we are fortunate to be in a much better position than many other kids. Some of my friends have it way worse - and while I deplore the current state of education I think until I saw the film I was sort of complacent - with a somewhat apathetic attitude. Well no longer!Something must be done.

1357472,A1A5H418P7PN65,B003Q6D28C,Amazon Customer,"[8, 23]","I think someone who isn't aware of what's involved in learning and testing could easily come away from this movie far more confused (when asked about specifics of the problem) than when they entered - although feeling like they know about what's going on (just like the movie's US math test performance versus confidence).  There were a lot of heart string tugged - no one wants to see their beautiful baby suffer now or into the future.  But in the attempt to bring the problem emotionally to the forefront, many issues were either simplified, glossed over, neglected or associated with something that was not substantiated in the movie.I have not read other reviews of the movie, and although there are plenty of other issues to take with this movie, the following one calls into question any statement purported by the filmmakers:Proficiency.  Not once was it defined, given historical perspective (the same exact test has been given for the last 40 years (the time featured in this movie)?) or its methods illustrated, quantified, or really the question of assessment really touched upon in any respect.  If the entire thrust of the movie is to based on relative test scores (between districts, between countries, between years), how can anyone really understand these comparisons without first understand what it is in fact that is being compared.  I understand that it would be a whole lot more difficult to make a movie that first educated its audience some small portion about the ways and means of education in the first place (doing what this movie says is wrong in the first place) - but how are we, as a discerning public, to really have an idea about the state of education when it is really never defined.  If I have 100 things (Indian Rupee) and my friend has 10 things (US Dollars) and my friend wants to trade - you really want to know what those things are, right?The fingerpointing in this movie has a lot of emotion, but little in the way of really setting up or indeed tackling the problems in education.",1,"Very emotional, but little real identification of the state of education",1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2025,"['think', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'aware', 'what', 'involved', 'learning', 'testing', 'could', 'easily', 'come', 'away', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'confused', 'when', 'asked', 'specifics', 'problem', 'when', 'entered', 'feeling', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'movie', 'US', 'math', 'test', 'performance', 'versus', 'confidence', 'were', 'lot', 'heart', 'string', 'tugged', 'one', 'see', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'suffer', 'now', 'future', 'attempt', 'bring', 'problem', 'emotionally', 'forefront', 'many', 'issues', 'were', 'either', 'simplified', 'glossed', 'neglected', 'associated', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'substantiated', 'movie.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'issues', 'take', 'movie', 'following', 'one', 'question', 'statement', 'purported', 'filmmakers', 'Proficiency', 'Not', 'once', 'was', 'defined', 'given', 'historical', 'perspective', 'same', 'exact', 'test', 'been', 'given', 'last', '40', 'years', 'time', 'featured', 'movie', 'methods', 'illustrated', 'quantified', 'really', 'question', 'assessment', 'really', 'touched', 'respect', 'entire', 'thrust', 'movie', 'based', 'relative', 'test', 'scores', 'districts', 'countries', 'years', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'really', 'understand', 'comparisons', 'first', 'understand', 'what', 'fact', 'being', 'compared', 'understand', 'would', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'first', 'educated', 'audience', 'small', 'portion', 'ways', 'means', 'education', 'first', 'place', 'doing', 'what', 'movie', 'wrong', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'are', 'discerning', 'public', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'state', 'education', 'when', 'really', 'never', 'defined', 'have', '100', 'things', 'Indian', 'Rupee', 'friend', '10', 'things', 'US', 'Dollars', 'friend', 'trade', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'things', 'are', 'right', 'fingerpointing', 'movie', 'lot', 'emotion', 'little', 'way', 'really', 'setting', 'up', 'indeed', 'tackling', 'problems', 'education']",N/A
1357473,AX93URVYM33YI,B003Q6D28C,"Arthur Sido ""But who are you, O man, to answe...","[6, 10]","I have been looking forward to watching Waiting For ""Superman"" since I heard about it and finally got the chance to watch it last night. It was a gut-wrenching movie that takes the situation in our public schools beyond abstract statistics and into the lives of parents and children who are desperate to get into a better school and get out of one of America's failing public schools. They are mostly younger kids and because of where they live they are on the path to a dropout factory high school if they don't get into a charter school. Even one young lady in a very nice suburban school is trying to get out because even in an affluent school district, the schools are doing a poor job of preparing all of the students for the economy of the 21st century instead of preparing them for niche jobs as worker bees in the 1950's. The movie follows these families and intersperses their experiences with interviews of innovative educators who describe the incredible obstacles to trying to reform the school system, most notably the teachers unions that are so politically powerful that they have successfully blocked any sort of real reform for decades.What is especially heart wrenching is watching auditoriums packed full of parents and kids desperately hoping that their child is selected at random to attend a charter school knowing that if their child doesn't get picked that they are destined for a much harder road to college. As the names are read off and the kids are not selected, you can see how crushed the children are and perhaps even more so the parents. (spoiler warning!) Ironically the one kid who did get into a charter school is the young woman from California who lives in a neighborhood of million dollar homes and attends one of the nicest looking schools I have ever seen.It was an interesting juxtaposition that the day we watched Waiting For ""Superman"", teachers unions in Wisconsin were encouraging their members to skip work to protest changes to the collective bargaining arrangements in that state and Democratic lawmakers went into hiding to avoid a vote. The public school system is entirely about the entrenched interests and those interests, as the movie points out, are all about the adults and not the kids. That is readily apparent as the movie showed scenes of rooms full of screaming teachers yelling and gesturing at Michelle Rhee of the D.C. public schools for daring to make hard decisions and take a tough stance in the worst public school system in the country.There are good teachers and there are bad teachers and I think the system wears down good teachers over the years. When you look at the next classroom over and that teacher is putting forth minimal effort and getting paid the same as you, where is your incentive to work harder? What we are left with is an education establishment that I believe has as its goal nothing more than getting as many union members into the educational system and keeping them there no matter what. The good teachers, and there are lots of them, should be rewarded just as high performers in any private organization are rewarded for excellence. They should be allowed to innovate and adapt and they should be encouraged to take risks. The bad teachers should be managed out the door before they can do any more damage. No private organization would survive with the same work rules as a public school (see: Automakers, American). If we are as serious about education in this country as we pay lip service to, we must shatter the monopolistic hold of the public school teachers unions. The teachers unions hold good teachers back and keep bad teachers employed and that is doing nothing to help our kids.I would highly encourage any parent with a child in the public school system or really anyone who is concerned about the state of American education and what it means for the future of America to watch Waiting For ""Superman""",5,The very institution entrusted to educate our kids stands in the way,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,3911,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Waiting', 'Superman', 'heard', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'gut-wrenching', 'movie', 'situation', 'public', 'schools', 'abstract', 'statistics', 'lives', 'parents', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'get', 'better', 'school', 'get', 'one', 'America', 'failing', 'public', 'schools', 'are', 'mostly', 'younger', 'kids', 'where', 'live', 'are', 'path', 'dropout', 'factory', 'high', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'charter', 'school', 'Even', 'one', 'young', 'lady', 'very', 'nice', 'suburban', 'school', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'because', 'even', 'affluent', 'school', 'district', 'schools', 'are', 'doing', 'poor', 'job', 'preparing', 'students', 'economy', '21st', 'century', 'instead', 'preparing', 'niche', 'jobs', 'worker', 'bees', '1950', 'movie', 'families', 'intersperses', 'experiences', 'interviews', 'innovative', 'educators', 'who', 'describe', 'incredible', 'obstacles', 'trying', 'reform', 'school', 'system', 'most', 'notably', 'teachers', 'unions', 'are', 'so', 'politically', 'powerful', 'have', 'successfully', 'blocked', 'sort', 'real', 'reform', 'decades.What', 'especially', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'watching', 'auditoriums', 'packed', 'full', 'parents', 'kids', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'child', 'selected', 'random', 'attend', 'charter', 'school', 'knowing', 'child', ""n't"", 'get', 'picked', 'are', 'destined', 'much', 'harder', 'road', 'college', 'names', 'are', 'read', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'selected', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'crushed', 'children', 'are', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'parents', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'Ironically', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'did', 'get', 'charter', 'school', 'young', 'woman', 'California', 'who', 'neighborhood', 'million', 'dollar', 'homes', 'one', 'nicest', 'looking', 'schools', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'juxtaposition', 'day', 'watched', 'Waiting', 'Superman', 'teachers', 'unions', 'Wisconsin', 'were', 'encouraging', 'members', 'skip', 'work', 'protest', 'changes', 'collective', 'bargaining', 'arrangements', 'state', 'Democratic', 'lawmakers', 'went', 'hiding', 'avoid', 'vote', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'entirely', 'entrenched', 'interests', 'interests', 'movie', 'out', 'are', 'adults', 'not', 'kids', 'readily', 'apparent', 'movie', 'showed', 'scenes', 'rooms', 'full', 'screaming', 'teachers', 'yelling', 'gesturing', 'Michelle', 'Rhee', 'D.C.', 'public', 'schools', 'daring', 'make', 'hard', 'decisions', 'take', 'tough', 'stance', 'worst', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'country.There', 'are', 'good', 'teachers', 'are', 'bad', 'teachers', 'think', 'system', 'down', 'good', 'teachers', 'years', 'When', 'look', 'next', 'classroom', 'teacher', 'putting', 'forth', 'minimal', 'effort', 'getting', 'paid', 'same', 'where', 'incentive', 'work', 'harder', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'education', 'establishment', 'believe', 'goal', 'nothing', 'more', 'getting', 'many', 'union', 'members', 'educational', 'system', 'keeping', 'matter', 'what', 'good', 'teachers', 'are', 'lots', 'should', 'be', 'rewarded', 'just', 'as', 'high', 'performers', 'private', 'organization', 'are', 'rewarded', 'excellence', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'innovate', 'adapt', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'take', 'risks', 'bad', 'teachers', 'should', 'be', 'managed', 'out', 'door', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'damage', 'private', 'organization', 'would', 'survive', 'same', 'work', 'rules', 'public', 'school', 'see', 'Automakers', 'American', 'are', 'serious', 'education', 'country', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'must', 'shatter', 'monopolistic', 'hold', 'public', 'school', 'teachers', 'unions', 'teachers', 'unions', 'hold', 'good', 'teachers', 'back', 'keep', 'bad', 'teachers', 'employed', 'doing', 'nothing', 'help', 'kids.I', 'would', 'highly', 'encourage', 'parent', 'child', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'really', 'anyone', 'who', 'concerned', 'state', 'American', 'education', 'what', 'future', 'America', 'watch', 'Waiting', 'Superman']",N/A

1357475,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B003Q6D28C,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[6, 7]","In many ways, I'm probably the exact wrong audience for this film.  First, I don't have children; I am child-free by choice.  Second, I am actually a member of a union which includes teachers--although I am not a teacher myself (I'm a psychologist), I work for a state college, where all educators and professionals are automatically enrolled into the same union.  And in interest of full disclosure, I'm quite liberal (you can decide for yourself after reading the rest of my review whether that influenced my opinion of this film or not).I had been interested in seeing WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"" since it was in theaters.  Most people who have heard anything about this movie know that it involves parents trying to get their kids into the too-few good schools available via risky lottery systems--this is truly as heartbreaking as it sounds, but it actually only accounts for about the last 30 minutes or so of the film.  Rather, most of the documentary speaks more to the education system in general, struggling to answer the tough question of WHY so many of our schools are failing and WHAT we can do about it.  Regarding the latter, this film does provide hope, as it features the successes reached by charismatic educator Geoffrey Canada and others.Some have suggested that this film spends too much time assigning blame.  In its efforts to understand the issues in our schools, yes, WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"" does highlight some particular area of problems, although I don't think this was a major feature of the movie.  However, it was necessary, and unfortunately, one of the areas which does come out negative when viewing American education as a whole is the teacher's unions.  Now, I am certainly pro-teacher (and I believe that this film was as well, as it couldn't say enough about the importance of good teachers), and as I noted above, I am in a union myself.  But this has allowed me to see first-hand the detriments to being unionized, with employees no longer caring because their jobs are protected.  Is this who you want teaching your kids?  We need to respect and license teachers as we would other professionals (such as doctors, lawyers, etc.), but also be able to remove teachers from their positions when necessary.Part of what makes this film so moving is the individual children featured.  There is Daisy, the young Hispanic girl whose mother is the wage-earner (she mentions that her father is ""struggling"") who wants to be a doctor, nurse, AND a veterinarian.  Anthony, whose father died of a drug overdose, is being raised by his grandmother and trying to stay on track.  Little Francisco likes math but isn't crazy about school overall, mainly because he's not getting much attention in his overwhelming elementary classes.  The extras on the DVD include four additional student/teacher stories that go into even greater depth:  each is an approximately 8-12 minute feature on a particular student, teacher, or family efforting to make a difference.If you watch the credits at the end, you will realize that director Davis Guggenheim is suggesting that this is a start only--obviously much more needs to be done.  (This is actually his SECOND documentary about education; the first wasThe First Year.)

Sure there are people who say test scores are meaningless and this is somewhat addressed in the movie but you cannot argue graduation/dropout rates. The movie also presents all this mindnumbing data in a very creative way often using moveable graphics on a map of the U.S.That is only part of the story. By focusing on a few different kids and their parents we gain far greater insight into how kids are being shortchanged depending whether not so much how good their school is but how good or bad each individual teacher is.The movie will leave you slackjawed if you are looking at this as an outsider, like I am, not being an American. Ultimately, though, unlike so many documentaries that often point fingers and stop there, this one shows some solutions that have worked in the U.S. such as the KIPP schools in LA or how Washington, D.C., (the nation's capital having one of the worse public school districts in the country) attempted to wake up their teachers' union by offering incentive-based pay...and the union showing where their real heart is, turning that down.The movie also is incredibly heartbreaking when you see the actual lottery drawings for kids to get into these ""good"" schools.The extras are a bit much as they are sales pitches for various charter schools--some of which we learn about in the movie.

Fairbanks""","[19, 41]","In Waiting for Superman, we see rundown neighborhoods filled with crumbling apartment buildings which even rats might find uninhabitable. ""For generations, experts tended to blame failing schools on failing neighborhoods,"" the narrator tells us. ""But reformers have begun to believe the opposite, the problems of failing neighborhoods might be blamed on failing schools.""The kind of ""high performing teacher"" that the film then goes on to praise would write ""prove"" in the margin of a student essay that proposed the above thesis. If the student neglected to support his argument with facts, the teacher would reward the paper with a failing grade, or maybe a C in acknowledgment of whatever effort was put forth, but certainly not the A that far too many critics gave Waiting for Superman upon its much ballyhooed release.Waiting for Superman deserves an F, a big, fat one, for simply offering opinions without providing a shred of evidence to support them. Instead, the film attacks Teachers Unions while praising charter schools which are generally free of their influence. Among those recruited to make the case is Howard Fuller, former superintendent of the Milwaukee Schools. Listen as Fuller explains one of the problems he faced as a superintendent:""I'm assigning kids over to a school. The day I sent them over there, I know they ain't gonna learn nothing, (sic) `cause ain't nobody learned anything over there in 20 years.""As they say, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, and Fuller's atrocious slaughtering of the English language makes him a poor spokeman for education reform. Others trotted out to promote the film's cause also have questionable credentials. Michelle Rhee, the former Chancellor of the D.C. school system, came to her high profile post with little more than an attitude. Her track record as a teacher has been as effectively hidden as Obama's birth certificate.Waiting for Superman turns out to be nothing more than propaganda for charter schools - publically funded but privately operated - at a profit - hence their appeal to the same kind of malignant forces behind most of America's current economic woes. The filmmakers deserve some credit for acknowledging that charter schools have been no more successful than public schools, but they skim over that fact as quickly as possible, then resume blasting away at the big, bad Teachers Union.Like far too many documentaries these days, much of Waiting for Superman is contrived and emotionally manipulative. Several scenes have since been exposed as having been staged for the cameras, and the film's framing device, involving a lottery to pick the lucky students who get to attend one of those supposedly miraculous charter schools, is an attempt to create suspense and push the viewers' buttons.Waiting for Superman is a very bad film tailor-made for the kind of passive viewer who accepts without question whatever nonsense is thrown at him by the self-styled ""experts.""  Our public education system is, indeed, in need of repair, but why? One reason is undoubtedly the emphasis on the constant testing that encourages students to memorize data, but does nothing to enhance their thinking skills. More significant is the breakdown of the American family and a culture that glorifies wickedness and rewards incompetence. Bad neighborhoods, populated by economically disadvantaged and fractured families, are, indeed, the reason why most schools are failing, but that's a problem our society finds too overwhelming to face. It's easier to find a scapegoat, and Waiting for Superman finds it in teachers who, for the most part, are being victimized as much as their students in a society that is crumbling from within.Those interested in education reform are advised to skip this movie and crack open a book instead.

1357479,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B003Q6D28C,bunnyrabbit4,"[12, 23]","Our local Charter schools are being created along the corporate plan for education shown here. It is not a pretty plan, nor is the result a more educated human being. If you teach someone how to think and learn, they become lifelong learners. If you provide a wide variety of activities designed to stimulate EVERY mind, like good teachers have always done, you encourage genius. I teach at the college level and over the last 10 years we have seen test score rise at the K-12 level only to find that at the college level these students are miserable critical thinkers, unable to reason their way out of a paper bag. At the K-12 level, teachers can lose their teaching certificates if they continue to ""FAIL"" at producing test scores, often under the most defeating circumstances.What most people don't realize is that the same corporate giants who planned this have also attacked college level educators. It is important that no educators show up to expose what is going on. At the college level there have been recent changes to insure we can't get raises unless a very high percentage of our students LIKE US on evaluations. In our case the number is 90%. This produces pressure to essentially BLESS the flawed K-12 system with inflated grades. This is all part of the plan to turn education over to corporations and force REAL teachers into the ranks of the unemployed.Increasingly students come to us looking for test answers, not knowledge. They expect ""study guides"" that narrow the information down to only what is going to be on the test. The joy of learning has been ""tested"" out of them. I hope if the day comes that you find yourself in a hospital, your nurse doesn't search your forehead for choice A, Choice B, Choice C or D all of the above! It takes complex critical thinking to diagnose real problems. And it should be noted that this is also an attack on the Arts in schools. Perhaps you've never thought of their value, but poetry can better help you to understand the person in front of you than Math or Science. Teachers in our gifted English programs are now forbidden from teaching poetry and must use History...I wonder whose version of history that will be?? Perhaps the world according to Bill Gates or Monsanto???  Monsanto is giving away Science lessons to charter schools on the wonders of GMO foods...and of course the Corporate Charters are all about making money!!

This ""documentary"" is so biased and opinionated that I now question the ""Director's"" previous work, An Inconvenient Truth.  The fairest fact-based review of this PR film for privatizing public schools is titled The Myth of Charter Schools, November 11, 2010, Diane Ravitch, in the New York Review Of Books.  She details the giant salaries of Charter Schools' owners, how Wall Street is involved in getting our tax money (sound familiar?) out of public schools, the real statistics reveal that charter schools fail more often than public schools which is odd because the whole point of charter schools is for private corporations to get at that tax money and for these corporations to show results by only taking the most motivated parents and top performing students (yet 75% do no better or worse than public schools), and a lot more.  In that review the author takes down the statistics, the interviewees, and much more in the film by fully presenting statistics the films misrepresents or conveniently ignores.  She even responds to the responses of the films interviewees.  Ironically the star of the film (who primps for the camera by firing a school employee live in a Maury Povich / Jerry Springer style moment reminiscent of Romans throwing Christians to the lions) is herself fired by the voters the week this film was released.  That ""star"", Michelle Rhee, was revealed last week to have lied about her successes as a school teacher on her resume which she used to attain her position in DC schools-the same one she was forced to resign from.There are two balanced and thoughtful films that truly explore the challenges of Education in this modern age: Race To Nowhere and The Principal Story.I've voted pro-environment my whole life but I now regret assuming the facts in An Inconvenient Truth were true without researching those ""facts"" myself.  I cannot imagine someone who is willing to lie so greatly in one documentary would suddenly be completely honest in another.

Perhaps another hour would have been needed to talk about what happens to disciplinary issues, Special education students, illegal alien children and the focus in many districts on sports rather than education.  The highlight for this documentary are several urban schools in DC, Los Angeles, Redwood City, CA across the country and some of their students and the caregivers that push them to succeed.Some shocking facts are revealed:  the literacy rate in DC is a mere 12%.  New York State has 600 teachers every year that for whatever disciplinary reason are pulled out of class and basically spend every day napping, playing cards or reading newspapers in a teacher lounge until their case gets reviewed by the school board.  Tenured teachers seem invincible in some states.  In other states (like Arizona) tenure does not exist.  STates spend more money incarcerating prisoners than they do educating students.We clearly see a divide between rich and poor in this documentary.  But what we also see are parents concerned about the education of their children, and we listen to several parents who do everything they can to afford private education because the local public school is a dropout academy.Several distinguished educators are interviewed for this documentary:  Geoffrey Canada, Bill Strickland, Michelle Rhee, former chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools system of Washington, D.C.  She resigned in October 2010 which is not mentioned in the documentary as this was still in production at the time.This documentary is well done but some areas are omitted. Although this documentary proves that financially poor students do not necessarily make poor academic students, what could have used more research are all the reasons that make school districts poor at educating students.  Inept bureaucracy is one factor that is made obvious.  But what is the burden on districts where many illegal immigrants live?  The children of these people need to be educated, too, if they want to get ahead, but often these people are enrolled using forged documents.  What about the athletes that only attend school to be able to play sports?  What happens to girls that get pregnant?  What about schools with a high violence problem? What about the issues of learning differences between girls and boys? The unasked question goes on and on.One sees how some students struggle to get a good education, but one doesn't see how the teachers struggle, too.  Teachers work long hours, deal with unruly children and parents, and are always the first to be blamed when a child fails.This documentary proves with the Kipp Academies that poor students can achieve with longer school hours and Saturday schools.  But do parents and children support this?  The students in this documentary seem to feel priviledged attending the schools profiled in this film, and their good education allows them to make high goals for the future. The better schools are the chartered schools where rules are strictly adhered to.  Acceptance is based on a lottery system conducted in front of a live audience of parents and children.  Is this, however, how children should be accepted?In the end there is not enough time to cover all aspects of our public school system.  We only saw the tip of the ice berg. For a more thorough documentary more teachers, parents, children and administrator need to be interviewd.  The life of a teacher is little known.  This is still a worthwhile documentary to view and discuss.",4,You're lucky if you get an education,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,3614,"['documentary', 'covers', 'many', 'aspects', 'current', 'public', 'education', 'system', ""n't"", 'cover', 'Perhaps', 'hour', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'needed', 'talk', 'what', 'disciplinary', 'issues', 'Special', 'education', 'students', 'illegal', 'alien', 'children', 'focus', 'many', 'districts', 'sports', 'rather', 'education', 'highlight', 'documentary', 'are', 'several', 'urban', 'schools', 'DC', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Redwood', 'City', 'CA', 'country', 'students', 'caregivers', 'push', 'succeed.Some', 'shocking', 'facts', 'are', 'revealed', 'literacy', 'rate', 'DC', 'mere', '12', '%', 'New', 'York', 'State', '600', 'teachers', 'year', 'disciplinary', 'reason', 'are', 'pulled', 'class', 'basically', 'spend', 'day', 'napping', 'playing', 'cards', 'reading', 'newspapers', 'teacher', 'lounge', 'case', 'reviewed', 'school', 'board', 'Tenured', 'teachers', 'seem', 'invincible', 'states', 'other', 'states', 'Arizona', 'tenure', 'not', 'exist', 'STates', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'incarcerating', 'prisoners', 'do', 'educating', 'students.We', 'clearly', 'see', 'divide', 'rich', 'poor', 'documentary', 'what', 'also', 'see', 'are', 'parents', 'concerned', 'education', 'children', 'listen', 'several', 'parents', 'who', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'afford', 'private', 'education', 'local', 'public', 'school', 'dropout', 'academy.Several', 'distinguished', 'educators', 'are', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'Geoffrey', 'Canada', 'Bill', 'Strickland', 'Michelle', 'Rhee', 'former', 'chancellor', 'District', 'Columbia', 'Public', 'Schools', 'system', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'resigned', 'October', '2010', 'not', 'mentioned', 'documentary', 'was', 'still', 'production', 'time.This', 'documentary', 'well', 'done', 'areas', 'are', 'omitted', 'documentary', 'financially', 'poor', 'students', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'poor', 'academic', 'students', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'research', 'are', 'reasons', 'make', 'school', 'districts', 'poor', 'educating', 'students', 'Inept', 'bureaucracy', 'one', 'factor', 'made', 'obvious', 'what', 'burden', 'districts', 'where', 'many', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'live', 'children', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'educated', 'too', 'want', 'get', 'ahead', 'often', 'people', 'are', 'enrolled', 'using', 'forged', 'documents', 'What', 'athletes', 'only', 'attend', 'school', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'sports', 'What', 'girls', 'get', 'pregnant', 'What', 'schools', 'high', 'violence', 'problem', 'What', 'issues', 'learning', 'differences', 'girls', 'boys', 'unasked', 'question', 'on.One', 'how', 'students', 'struggle', 'get', 'good', 'education', 'one', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'teachers', 'struggle', 'too', 'Teachers', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'deal', 'unruly', 'children', 'parents', 'are', 'always', 'first', 'be', 'blamed', 'when', 'child', 'fails.This', 'documentary', 'proves', 'Kipp', 'Academies', 'poor', 'students', 'can', 'achieve', 'longer', 'school', 'hours', 'Saturday', 'schools', 'do', 'parents', 'children', 'support', 'students', 'documentary', 'seem', 'feel', 'priviledged', 'attending', 'schools', 'profiled', 'film', 'good', 'education', 'make', 'high', 'goals', 'future', 'better', 'schools', 'are', 'chartered', 'schools', 'where', 'rules', 'are', 'strictly', 'adhered', 'Acceptance', 'based', 'lottery', 'system', 'conducted', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'parents', 'children', 'however', 'how', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'accepted', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'cover', 'aspects', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'only', 'saw', 'tip', 'ice', 'berg', 'more', 'thorough', 'documentary', 'more', 'teachers', 'parents', 'children', 'administrator', 'need', 'be', 'interviewd', 'life', 'teacher', 'little', 'known', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'documentary', 'view', 'discuss']",N/A

The students' stories were touching, and I was really hoping they would be selected for the schools their parents were trying to get them into. However, I did not appreciate the director not attempting to present the teacher's perspectives or the point of view of the parents that are raising the poor performing students. Schools to be held accountable for the learning and the introduction of new concepts to these students. However, the parents have to reinforce these concepts and instill study habits to their children. If they do not value education, their children won't either, which is a HUGE obstacle for any teacher to tackle. The creator of this documentary also did not hold the children accountable for their own performance either. I felt like this documentary was just bashing teachers and did not portray an accurate picture of what teachers go through on a rounded basis. If a teacher is ""bad"", they should not continue to teach, but is it fair to base if a teacher is ""bad"" or not on a test that a student takes on one day out of the school year. These tests do not take into consideration any conditions, work habits, or attitudes these students may have. It is a very unfair system. Parents and kids should be held more accountable, and the government should put more money and resources into the education system. This would result in improvements across the board.",2,too biased,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1438,"['were', 'good', 'parts', 'documentary', 'students', 'stories', 'were', 'touching', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'selected', 'schools', 'parents', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'director', 'not', 'attempting', 'present', 'teacher', 'perspectives', 'point', 'view', 'parents', 'are', 'raising', 'poor', 'performing', 'students', 'Schools', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'learning', 'introduction', 'new', 'concepts', 'students', 'However', 'parents', 'have', 'reinforce', 'concepts', 'instill', 'study', 'habits', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'value', 'education', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'either', 'HUGE', 'obstacle', 'teacher', 'tackle', 'creator', 'documentary', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'children', 'accountable', 'own', 'performance', 'felt', 'documentary', 'was', 'just', 'bashing', 'teachers', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'accurate', 'picture', 'what', 'teachers', 'go', 'rounded', 'basis', 'teacher', 'bad', 'should', 'not', 'continue', 'teach', 'fair', 'base', 'teacher', 'bad', 'not', 'test', 'student', 'one', 'day', 'school', 'year', 'tests', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'consideration', 'conditions', 'work', 'habits', 'attitudes', 'students', 'may', 'have', 'very', 'unfair', 'system', 'Parents', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'more', 'accountable', 'government', 'should', 'put', 'more', 'money', 'resources', 'education', 'system', 'would', 'result', 'improvements', 'board']",N/A

The socio-economic issues are not limited to inner city schools, nor is bad education. This film tends to make the teachers looks like the causes even when it says it's trying to be fair.

1357487,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B003Q6D28C,C.Wallace,"[12, 31]","Michelle Rhee is a star in this documentary. Check out the Wikipedia article on her and the scandalous test erasures on her watch as D.C. School Chancellor. These are the very tests that ""reformers"" want to use as the criterion to separate good from bad teachers.  Would this cheating have occurred if not for the tremendous pressure coming from on high?""Reformers"" like Rhee who are hailed in this documentary want to take away tenure. Tenure is one reason people become and remain teachers. Take away a benefit and expect to get better teachers. But, fine, take it away, and let administrators like Rhee fire away. Of course, they would only fire people because they want children to get the best possible education. True, without tenure and unions, incompetent teachers who have jobs right now would be much easier to fire. Does that mean there would then be no incompetent teachers working? Those who run the schools in this tenureless/unionless brave new world would never protect incompetent teachers? Private schools and charter schools which have no unions today only have great teachers?The ""reformers"" want to make teacher pay competitive. Get those test scores, and get big bucks. Don't get those test scores...hit the street. Model teaching on the business world: produce or you are out. Everybody knows that if you don't sell enough widgets and your job is selling widgets...Check the news; check the many stories of charter/public schools cheating on these tests. Discover that charter schools, as briefly noted in this film, do not perform better on average on these tests than public schools.  (Produce a slick documentary that shines on the best and ignores the rest.) Are the people who run these charter schools better people than those who run the public schools? Are they fair people who will not let their personal feelings determine the fate of someone under their control? What will they do about teachers who produce high scores, but, in fact, are not compassionate good people?Give the ""reformers"" what they want: no unions, uncertain pay for teachers, and no job security. (Remember, unions do not only protect teacher job security, they also protect things like pay, benefits, and working conditions.) Make it all depend upon an insecure test system that can be warped by unscrupulous people. Who will you get to teach then? You will get people who are willing to totally submit to the person who can fire them.  For any reason. You will get people who WILL get those high test scores. Will most of these people be brilliant and honest, far better educators than most public school teachers today?  Will these shining stars embrace beginning English learners and disruptive students and not run away from challenging students like they would run away from the plague? If these last two questions can be answered with a resounding ""Yes,"" then by all means--total ""charterization,"" please.Of course, it doesn't really matter to rich folk like filmmaker Davis Guggenheim. He states early in the film that his own children go to private school. It seems to me that his song goes like this: ""I'll run your life and make you follow rules that do not personally affect me.""Blame urban decay on the schools! Blame crime on the police! Blame doctors for disease! Surely, somebody could put together something slick that supports these charges. Forget all of the people who have pulled themselves up by getting a public school education!  The film vaguely asserts that ""forty years ago"" our schools were success factories, not today's ""dropout factories.""  So, there aren't any successful people today who benefited from a public education? Search your memory for accounts in the media or the stories of your friends/associates who blame personal failure on the public schools. Guggenheim does. I wonder if Guggenheim could put together a documentary about specific high school dropouts which demonstrates that these people dropped out because of their teachers. He could, if he looked hard enough and spent enough money, probably get a group of convincing photogenic people to say something like, ""I would have graduated from high school and college if only I did not have such incompetent teachers in the public schools I attended beginning in kindergarten."" I suspect that other aspects of these lives would remain unexamined.Ultimately, the people will decide this issue. That is, you will decide. Ask yourself about your teachers. You know them well. Is Guggenheim correct? It seems to me that the economic hard times we face today will boost these ""reformers."" In their unionless brave new world it will be easy to cut public school budgets, teacher salaries (some will go up, but the average will sharply drop), and expensive teacher benefits. ""Reformers"" can claim to save tax dollars.  And, there will always be good schools, no matter what, due to hardworking, dedicated, teachers, administrators, and staff. Socrates walked about clad in rags, apparently homeless, living off the handouts of friends. So, in a hypothetical unionless brave new world in, say, thirty years, someone like Guggenheim can come along with a camera and defend the destruction of unions. But it will be a challenge because just out of camera range there will be a lot of rot.I feel that many of these ""reformers"" really want to privatize education. Make it a business. It would be a huge business, with big profits to be made. I can envision big corporations that run schools and sell stock. ""Schools R Us."" Parents would check those stocks as they choose schools for their children. Today, there are many outstanding private schools. Their fees are often very high. You get what you pay for. What happens to those who can't pay?Provide vouchers so parents could send their kids to schools with high test scores. Many of these schools would charge more than the vouchers would cover. And it can be difficult and expensive to send a child to a school outside the neighborhood. However, if our society remains committed to universal free education, the poorest students, students with special needs, students who are just beginning to learn English, and students with a pattern of disruptive behavior would be stuck in the underfunded truly free neighborhood schools.Today's schools do not prepare us for a global economy, according to the film. Those often-cited lists of how other countries have higher test scores are thrown in our faces.  But do these other countries try to educate everyone like the United States? Are these societies characterized by a diverse population that includes many who are just beginning to learn the language in which the test is administered? Many other countries separate students into different tracks at an early stage.  Does every child take these sacred always-cited tests in other countries, or just a select group on a strong academic track? Are there mandatory school attendance laws that are strictly enforced? Just how valid are these tests in other countries?  Some of those countries above us on the list strike me as countries where the Minister of Education (or whatever the name) BETTER have a good report. Is there widespread cheating in other countries? Of course, Guggenheim does not look under these rocks. Remember, we are dealing with statistics that can radically change due to relatively limited manipulation/dishonesty.The film indicates that students do not fail because of poverty, broken families, and apathetic parents.  (The only parents we see in this film seem to be very concerned about their children.) Students fail because of the teachers, according to this production. Certainly, there are public school teachers who do not perform well. ""Any is too many."" But exactly what are the percentages of underachieving teachers compared to the percentages of people who do not do their jobs in other fields? This film offers no other explanation for student failure.Wave a crooked wand and give ruthless people the POWER. Yeah, that's it.

1357490,A2WU73VIG5W51Q,B003Q6D28C,"David D. Lawson ""A Legend in his own mind""","[6, 9]","While I do not agree with everything that was put forth in this film. A lot of it really rang true. As I was a Tenured HS Teacher for over 24 years. And yes Virginia, There is a lot of waste and politics in the Education Business. Yes I said Business. (It is Welfare for the Lower Middle Class in a lot of ways) For Example. The District that I work with was top heavy with Administrators. Who with a few notable exceptions were infected with pure careerism.  Their main concerns were keeping the Superintendent happy, getting their next promotion, not going back to the Classroom and keeping the lid on. From them, I heard a lot of platitudes about ""What is best for the Students"" & ""Thinking out of the Box"". But God help you, if you tried any thing new or effective in your classroom w/o their blessing which never comes. Because if you did try something new & got caught too often. You would either get transfered to the farthest School from your home. Or The Assist. Principal would be tasked to make your work life a living Hell.(I saw this happen to a very Talented and Gifted Substitute Teacher, Who would of been a Great Teacher but got the boot for his efforts instead.)Instead you get a lot of textbooks that have been ""dumbed down"" and a lot of computers that do not work. I won't even go on about the vast amount of paper work that really had nothing to do with actually Teaching. Or the large amount of time & taxpayers money wasted on In Services. That & a strict lesson plans that leave no time really to explain to the students what they are suppose to learn. As a lot of my great kids would show up for class from other districts or had missed a lot of school. So they just did not have a solid base on which build on for the subjects that I taught. Then I would get called on the carpet because I would try to build that base & would be accused of wasting valuable time.(I know that I was a handful for those folks)I also have to agree that my fellow ""teachers"" were a mixed lot. A large minority were just a wonder to behold. Maybe they do not know it or maybe they did, But I stole a lot of their ideas and techniques over the years. They also inspired me to do a better job and keep the privilege to teach. Then there were the others. (How they got a credential I do not know.) They were the major reason why I avoided the Lounge. They were some of the most bitter and angry people that I have ever met. (I also will freely admit that the only reason why I became a Teacher was that it was the only job that I could get that paid well and had benefits. I also admit that for the first couple of years I was a lousy Teacher. I just hope that my former students will forgive me.) Bottom line - We really need to take a good hard look at how we recruit Teachers, train them, lead not manage them and what do we do with the Bad Teachers.As to teachers Unions, In theory it is a good idea because sometimes you need someone in your corner when trouble raises its head toward you. But in my experience the Unions are a joke. The only thing my union was good for was taking my Closed Shop Union dues. If you got into trouble and you were not one of the Union Fair Haired Boys. Well you were on your own. Sure they would make some noise but thats about it. The dirty little secret is that one way to become an Administrator is to become a Union Official as a stepping stone. So you do not want to rock the boat too much.Moving on to Charter School. As with everything else in life they are a mixed bag. While the basic concept is sound, It does have problems. In that they have a high turn over rate for both Teachers and Administrators. Also the Local School Districts rightly fear them as some serious competition. So they try their best to sabotage them. Also you get folks who are there to make a lot of money period. Also the Politicians will throw their weight around by either supporting the Charter Schools or railing against them. There is a lot of political patronage in Education.I was also surprised that the ""Church"" Schools were not mentioned. From what I saw of them the vast majority of them do a great job with a whole lot less money. Granted you have the problem of separation of church and state. Also I was surprised that Vouchers was not mentioned. I feel that this is another tool that needs to be looked at.All in all, I think that this film has done a good service to our students.

1357491,A3EEBE82C3HYRD,B003Q6D28C,David,"[222, 270]","One of the most remarkable components of the film was the discussion of a proposal of Michelle Rhee -- the Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools system -- to pay teachers in the district up to $140k based on merit, if tenure would be ended in the district. In the world capital of democracy, the teacher union leaders refused to let this proposal go to a union vote.This short story is nestled into the middle of the film but describes the flavor of the rest of the movie. ""Waiting for 'Superman'"" is a shock and awe that delivers convincing arguments that good teachers are what matters to student learning but the U.S. school system cannot let shining stars shine or fire the bad apples, and the worse-off neighborhoods are hit the hardest. One of the major arguments of the film is that teacher tenure* has to go. It makes its case for each point with facts, figures, clear arguments, and examples. The film intensely wraps it all together with emotional connections to a half-dozen students followed through the film, each hoping to literally win the lottery and get a spot in a top charter school.The film isn't all attack, and it shows several success stories in the form of top charter schools. Many of these schools have graduation rates of nearly 100%, and nearly all students go onto college. Interestingly, many of the charter schools take students who were already behind and from neighborhoods with schools that are classified as drop-out factories (where a minority of students graduate).""Waiting for 'Superman'"" examines the problems, and it shows what is possible.See this film. Understand the issues. Push for reform.- - -* Tenure started with professors at universities. However, professors are never guaranteed tenure when they start their positions, and it typically takes about ten years -- ""ten-ures"" -- before they earn it. Many never achieve it. Yet K-12 public school teachers who have been only teaching for three years at the same school can achieve tenure, and they don't even have to go through a review to be granted tenure.",5,Why are we failing?

1357492,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B003Q6D28C,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 4]","This indictment of the American public school system in this sometimes powerful, sometimes overwrought documentary looks at the causes, stakes, and people behind educational reform.  Perhaps the most moving aspect is how it follows a handful of students and their families, primarily from inner city neighborhoods, as they struggle to gain access to a good education.  By doing this, the film gives faces and stories -- and gets the viewer invested in the outcome -- so that it is impossible to think of those who miss out as mere statistics.  From the Bronx to LA, these kids want desperately to learn, and their ambitions are huge, yet they face a system where many teachers have lost control of their classrooms and where the drop-out rates are staggering.In the true style of finger-pointing documentaries, this one takes facts (flat-line school performance, dropping US literary and math-competency compared to other countries, an inability of high tech firms to find qualified American citizens to fill their open positions, etc.) and digs up the villains (teacher unions, the tenure system, fear of change.)  These issues are sometimes illustrated by cutesy animation reminiscent of public school educational films shown back in the 1970s and 1980s.  Charter schools are portrayed as the saviors of the public educational system, although the filmmakers do acknowledge in a brief animated section that most of them fail to educate their students.  My biggest problem with Waiting for ""Superman"" is the way the gray areas are almost glossed over since they provide a different but still related complexity to the issues.  It's easy to come away with the idea that, because some charter schools have had excellent results, charter schools and school vouchers are the way to save the system.  If only one in six charter schools succeed, then their success is no better than the regional public school system.  The filmmakers highlight why the best charters succeed, but not why others fail.Public school teachers, even good ones, are likely to be infuriated with this film, primarily because, while the life-changing influence of good teachers is noted, this film goes after tenure, teacher unions, school spending, and ineffective teaching (one clip shows students playing craps in the back of the classroom while the teacher reads), and it portrays school districts and unions as being more interested in the adults/employees than the children they are designed to serve.Despite its flaws, this is an important film to watch, if for no other reason than to learn about how we are failing our children.  When Bill Gates says that our young adults are not educated enough -- or motivated enough -- to support our position as a leader in the global economy, it is a wake-up call.  Watch this film -- and make up your own mind.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,Thought-provoking but sometimes a little cheesy and one-sided,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,2853,"['indictment', 'American', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'sometimes', 'powerful', 'sometimes', 'overwrought', 'documentary', 'looks', 'causes', 'stakes', 'people', 'educational', 'reform', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'moving', 'aspect', 'how', 'handful', 'students', 'families', 'primarily', 'inner', 'city', 'neighborhoods', 'struggle', 'gain', 'access', 'good', 'education', 'doing', 'film', 'stories', 'viewer', 'invested', 'outcome', 'impossible', 'think', 'who', 'miss', 'out', 'mere', 'statistics', 'Bronx', 'LA', 'kids', 'want', 'desperately', 'learn', 'ambitions', 'are', 'huge', 'yet', 'face', 'system', 'where', 'many', 'teachers', 'have', 'lost', 'control', 'classrooms', 'where', 'drop-out', 'rates', 'are', 'staggering.In', 'true', 'style', 'finger-pointing', 'documentaries', 'one', 'facts', 'flat-line', 'school', 'performance', 'dropping', 'US', 'literary', 'math-competency', 'compared', 'other', 'countries', 'inability', 'high', 'tech', 'firms', 'find', 'qualified', 'American', 'citizens', 'fill', 'open', 'positions', 'etc', 'up', 'villains', 'teacher', 'unions', 'tenure', 'system', 'fear', 'change', 'issues', 'are', 'sometimes', 'illustrated', 'cutesy', 'animation', 'reminiscent', 'public', 'school', 'educational', 'films', 'shown', 'back', '1970s', '1980s', 'Charter', 'schools', 'are', 'portrayed', 'saviors', 'public', 'educational', 'system', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'acknowledge', 'brief', 'animated', 'section', 'most', 'fail', 'educate', 'students', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Waiting', 'Superman', 'way', 'gray', 'areas', 'are', 'almost', 'glossed', 'over', 'provide', 'different', 'still', 'related', 'complexity', 'issues', 'easy', 'come', 'away', 'idea', 'charter', 'schools', 'have', 'had', 'excellent', 'results', 'charter', 'schools', 'school', 'vouchers', 'are', 'way', 'save', 'system', 'only', 'one', 'six', 'charter', 'schools', 'succeed', 'then', 'success', 'better', 'regional', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'filmmakers', 'highlight', 'why', 'best', 'charters', 'succeed', 'not', 'why', 'others', 'fail.Public', 'school', 'teachers', 'even', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'infuriated', 'film', 'primarily', 'life-changing', 'influence', 'good', 'teachers', 'noted', 'film', 'tenure', 'teacher', 'unions', 'school', 'spending', 'ineffective', 'teaching', 'one', 'clip', 'students', 'playing', 'craps', 'back', 'classroom', 'teacher', 'reads', 'school', 'districts', 'unions', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'adults/employees', 'children', 'are', 'designed', 'serve.Despite', 'flaws', 'important', 'film', 'watch', 'other', 'reason', 'learn', 'how', 'are', 'failing', 'children', 'When', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'not', 'educated', 'enough', 'motivated', 'enough', 'support', 'position', 'leader', 'global', 'economy', 'wake-up', 'call', 'Watch', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A

No one can deny what he uncovers is both shocking and sad, but I would have liked if he touched upon, even superficially, the following issues: 1)the role of proper nutrition and how a lack of it may contribute to learning disabilities, 2)multiple intelligences and how some children can't conform to a visual-auditory teaching system, 3)teachers who are themselves ""undereducated"", 4)television and video games and their impact on learning, and finally, 5)parents who don't take an interest in their child's education.To be fair, Guggenheim covered a great deal in this documentary and I applaud him and his crew for going out there and bringing back his findings to us. I'm sure the teacher's union has already put this film on their banned list. The reason being, it may disturb most of their members when they find out they're a bunch of mediocre drones looking to maintain the status quo for their benefit.

It follows the struggles of a few kids and their families in their quest for better education. Most importantly it focuses on the causes of the problems: namely that just as the quality of education of students is overlooked, so is the quality of training of the teachers and holding them accountable. To a very large degree the problems rest on the 'management', the school administrators and politics, which determine how best to use the tax money.Like everyone else who watched this documentary, especially the lottery method to determine who will go to a ""great"" school and who will not, I was repulsed by the state of public education in the United States, especially in Washington D.C. Michele Rhee's efforts impressed me, but the sickly state of the teachers' union was quite evident: while more money is poured, performance in the quality of teaching is not impacted. 90 Million Dollars spent in a year for transportation in D.C. alone. This didn't surprise me. Only a few years ago, in Rochester, NY, I had read that in the Rochester Central School system the staff had spent millions on the travel expenses of its administration. Geoffrey Canada, another educator, also seems impressive. I'd like to learn more about him.Because I have my own personal experience with a public school, where my daughter goes, in Upstate New York, my thoughts on public schools are a bit biased. The schools are great, and the teachers are topnotch. I sincerely believe that the school taxes paid in Upstate New York is less than what it would have cost if this school was private. But watching this documentary, there are many places in the rest of America that are struggling with quality education. Parents who wish a better future for their children in tears because they didn't win the lottery for a good school.WHY should there be bad schools? Why should anyone have to struggle to get good education...in America??Everyone deserves a good education in the world. Parents around the world should be made more aware of the existence of technologies that are supported by some of the greatest minds: Khan Academy is one, with an amazing structured learning approach especially in primary school levels. Many books are either very affordable or free, especially in Amazon. But I am not a fan of home schooling. There is need for real schools, where real life is simulated, namely the interaction with other people.The solution to the education problem in the United States will require team work of parents, the teachers, the unions, the government, and especially the kids themselves. Collaboration should be doable because everyone really wants better education for all children.I ask three things for schools to teach: how to read, how to write, and how to google.",4,Alternatives should have been discussed!,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,2922,"['structure', 'movie', 'very', 'easy', 'immediately', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'content', 'problems', 'exist', 'American', 'education', 'system', 'struggles', 'few', 'kids', 'families', 'quest', 'better', 'education', 'Most', 'importantly', 'causes', 'problems', 'namely', 'just', 'quality', 'education', 'students', 'overlooked', 'so', 'quality', 'training', 'teachers', 'holding', 'accountable', 'very', 'large', 'degree', 'problems', 'rest', ""'management"", 'school', 'administrators', 'politics', 'how', 'best', 'use', 'tax', 'money.Like', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'watched', 'documentary', 'especially', 'lottery', 'method', 'determine', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'great', 'school', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'was', 'repulsed', 'state', 'public', 'education', 'United', 'States', 'especially', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Michele', 'Rhee', 'efforts', 'impressed', 'sickly', 'state', 'teachers', 'union', 'was', 'quite', 'evident', 'more', 'money', 'poured', 'performance', 'quality', 'teaching', 'not', 'impacted', '90', 'Million', 'Dollars', 'spent', 'year', 'transportation', 'D.C.', 'alone', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Only', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Rochester', 'NY', 'had', 'read', 'Rochester', 'Central', 'School', 'system', 'staff', 'had', 'spent', 'millions', 'travel', 'expenses', 'administration', 'Geoffrey', 'Canada', 'educator', 'also', 'impressive', ""'d"", 'like', 'learn', 'more', 'him.Because', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'public', 'school', 'where', 'daughter', 'Upstate', 'New', 'York', 'thoughts', 'public', 'schools', 'are', 'bit', 'biased', 'schools', 'are', 'great', 'teachers', 'are', 'topnotch', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'school', 'taxes', 'paid', 'Upstate', 'New', 'York', 'less', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'school', 'was', 'private', 'watching', 'documentary', 'are', 'many', 'places', 'rest', 'America', 'are', 'struggling', 'quality', 'education', 'Parents', 'who', 'wish', 'better', 'future', 'children', 'tears', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'lottery', 'good', 'school.WHY', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'bad', 'schools', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'have', 'struggle', 'get', 'good', 'education', 'America', 'Everyone', 'good', 'education', 'world', 'Parents', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'aware', 'existence', 'technologies', 'are', 'supported', 'greatest', 'minds', 'Khan', 'Academy', 'one', 'amazing', 'structured', 'learning', 'approach', 'especially', 'primary', 'school', 'levels', 'Many', 'books', 'are', 'very', 'affordable', 'free', 'especially', 'Amazon', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'home', 'schooling', 'need', 'real', 'schools', 'where', 'real', 'life', 'simulated', 'namely', 'interaction', 'other', 'people.The', 'solution', 'education', 'problem', 'United', 'States', 'will', 'require', 'team', 'work', 'parents', 'teachers', 'unions', 'government', 'especially', 'kids', 'Collaboration', 'should', 'be', 'doable', 'everyone', 'really', 'better', 'education', 'children.I', 'ask', 'three', 'things', 'schools', 'teach', 'how', 'read', 'how', 'write', 'how', 'google']",N/A

1357499,A11SSYM4ISRN1I,B003Q6D28C,gclaheh,"[2, 4]","I never really thought about inner city schools until I watched this documentary and worked with some of my Black co-workers whose kids attended these poor schools.  I always asked them why they couldn't just move and they had various excuses like they were in debt or they didn't want to move away from their family.  But I won't even go there because this documentary isn't about that.It mostly is mostly about these poor Black/Hispanic kids have no choice but to go to these crappy schools where they will probably drop out and go to prison and it is all the teachers union's fault.  One thing that impressed me about this was that a small percentage of these students graduated from these crappy schools graduated from college despite their circumstances.  It is weird but I have a different perspective on this.First of all, a college degree is no guaruntee for a successful life.  Look at the Occupy Wall Street crowd, many of them have college degrees and they claim they can't find jobs.  I even had trouble finding a job once I graduated.  I worked in a well paying job and many of my co-workers didn't have a four year degree, yet we were all making the same money.  What will surprise most people is the number of people I worked with who have math and science degrees who made the same money as people who didn't go to college.  Then they talk about how Americans can't compete with foreigners in high tech jobs.  What people don't know is that many companies prefer hiring people from China and India because they can pay them less and work them longer hours than Americans who have to pay off college debts.My advice to young people is to be honest with themselves; if they are struggling with high school, college might be a waste of time and money for them.  And don't go into serious debt to get a degree.  With that note, in these failing schools, I feel that these students would be better served if they were encouraged to learn a trade or start their own business.The other comments that I wanted to make is that I felt that many of the parents interviewed are waiting for Superman to rescue them.  The only exception was the mom who enrolled her daughter in Catholic school.  Couldn't these parents buy workbooks for their kids and make them complete them?  Can't they hire tutors?  Look into homeschooling?  Make sure their kids do their homework?  Some Americans have become too dependent on government or others to help them out.  Whatever happened to self-suffiency?  The Homestead Act gave homesteaders free land, if they could live off of it for so many years.  I think that the Americans who were interviewed in the documentary would starve to death on their homestead while they are waiting for government workers to come and farm the land for them.The last thing that I wanted to say is what I think the government should do about these schools.  The government should cut the regulations and allow schools to fire teachers.  Then the government should withdraw a lot of funding from these schools and just have a few public schools in the area and allow the charter schools to take over.  The government keeps giving money to these schools that fail, when private and charter schools clearly do much better with less money.",4,Documentary really makes you think.,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3255,"['never', 'really', 'thought', 'inner', 'city', 'schools', 'watched', 'documentary', 'worked', 'Black', 'co-workers', 'kids', 'attended', 'poor', 'schools', 'always', 'asked', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'move', 'had', 'various', 'excuses', 'were', 'debt', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'move', 'away', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'there', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'about', 'that.It', 'mostly', 'mostly', 'poor', 'Black/Hispanic', 'kids', 'have', 'choice', 'go', 'crappy', 'schools', 'where', 'will', 'probably', 'drop', 'out', 'go', 'prison', 'teachers', 'union', 'fault', 'One', 'thing', 'impressed', 'was', 'small', 'percentage', 'students', 'graduated', 'crappy', 'schools', 'graduated', 'college', 'circumstances', 'weird', 'have', 'different', 'perspective', 'this.First', 'college', 'degree', 'guaruntee', 'successful', 'life', 'Look', 'Occupy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'crowd', 'many', 'have', 'college', 'degrees', 'claim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'jobs', 'even', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'job', 'once', 'graduated', 'worked', 'well', 'paying', 'job', 'many', 'co-workers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'four', 'year', 'degree', 'yet', 'were', 'making', 'same', 'money', 'What', 'will', 'surprise', 'most', 'people', 'number', 'people', 'worked', 'who', 'have', 'math', 'science', 'degrees', 'who', 'made', 'same', 'money', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'college', 'Then', 'talk', 'how', 'Americans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'foreigners', 'high', 'tech', 'jobs', 'What', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'companies', 'prefer', 'hiring', 'people', 'China', 'India', 'can', 'pay', 'less', 'work', 'longer', 'hours', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'pay', 'off', 'college', 'debts.My', 'advice', 'young', 'people', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'struggling', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'might', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'serious', 'debt', 'get', 'degree', 'note', 'failing', 'schools', 'feel', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'were', 'encouraged', 'learn', 'trade', 'start', 'own', 'business.The', 'other', 'comments', 'wanted', 'make', 'felt', 'many', 'parents', 'interviewed', 'are', 'waiting', 'Superman', 'rescue', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'mom', 'who', 'enrolled', 'daughter', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Could', ""n't"", 'parents', 'buy', 'workbooks', 'kids', 'make', 'complete', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'hire', 'tutors', 'Look', 'homeschooling', 'Make', 'sure', 'kids', 'do', 'homework', 'Americans', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'dependent', 'government', 'others', 'help', 'out', 'happened', 'self-suffiency', 'Homestead', 'Act', 'gave', 'homesteaders', 'free', 'land', 'could', 'live', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'think', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'would', 'starve', 'death', 'homestead', 'are', 'waiting', 'government', 'workers', 'come', 'farm', 'land', 'them.The', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'say', 'what', 'think', 'government', 'should', 'do', 'schools', 'government', 'should', 'cut', 'regulations', 'allow', 'schools', 'fire', 'teachers', 'Then', 'government', 'should', 'withdraw', 'lot', 'funding', 'schools', 'just', 'have', 'few', 'public', 'schools', 'area', 'allow', 'charter', 'schools', 'take', 'over', 'government', 'giving', 'money', 'schools', 'fail', 'when', 'private', 'charter', 'schools', 'clearly', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'less', 'money']",N/A

Early in the movie we're shown a clip for the old Superman TV show where Superman would always come in and save the day.  The point of this movie is our government schools are very, very broken, but no one is powerful enough to come save the children.In many ways it is a sad movie.The movie shows us children from rough situations.  These children want an educate so they can do well in life.  They have dreams, but these dreams will not be realized if they children are never taught.The movie interweaves clips of the children and their struggles to get into good schools with quotes from various education experts and politicians.  For decades politicians have been calling for improvements in education.  More funding has been raised for education.  Yet year after year public education continues to get worse.  For example in 2002 President Bush and Senator Kennedy worked to pass No Child Left Behind, where a large focus of the law was to measure progress.  Yet eight years later few children are proficient in math and reading.Here are some of the sad points made in the movie:1) Between 5th and 7th grade huge numbers of minority students go from getting B's to D's.2) Because of poor education in elementary schools many students will group out from middle and high school.3) Because of tenure it is almost impossible to fire bad teachers.The movie showed how Michelle Rhee tried to tackle the bureaucracy in the Washington DC school district, but was fought on many sides.  She tried to fire 50 principles and close down 23 failing schools, but there was a huge backlash.  Michelle Rhee said that the public is willing to let the children suffer so teachers don't get fired.The movie ends on a positive note.  It claims we know how to improve public schools now we just need to do it.While I think this is a good movie and worth watching I don't believe the conclusion.  The government schools today in the United States have institutionalized their problems and I don't have any faith that things will get better in the next decade.  It is such a Gordian Knot.  Any time someone tries to fix even a piece of the problem the teacher unions and school officials talk about the law and threaten lawsuits.  There are thousands of roadblocks scattered all across public education.If you want to see a good summary of the problems with public schools, this is worth watching.

It's pro-charter school propaganda for the uninformed. If you have never spent one day in a troubled inner-city classroom, you will love this movie. Sure, the teachers are all bad, greedy, lazy union bums who don't want to educate our kids, right? Charter schools will come in and fix everything! Right?Wrong, this is the reality, for anyone that has common sense. The real problem with our inner city schools is not the teachers or poverty. It's the culture. It does NOT value an education. This country is obsessed with trying to make every student Harvard material. We just can't do that. It's not realistic. Plenty of these children would rather be working than at school. Never mind the indoctrination we all received about the horrors of 19th century industrialization. The fact is, not every child is cut out for school. Not every culture values it. Honestly, I have to agree. There is a shortage of skilled workers out there in different fields. Instead of trying to encourage everyone to get a college degree, why not encourage them to work from an early age if they don't want to be in school? This is the real issue here.A charter school does nothing but take taxpayer money and try their hardest to send it to a few wealthy people. It wipes out middle class jobs.

The best and latest research bears out that the schools depicted in the film do make a positive difference,not simply anecdotely, but statistically as well. A study by Kevin Booker, researcher at Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. and Tim R. Sass, professor of economics at Florida State University, (among others), entitled ""Charter Schools in Eight States (RAND Corporation, 2009) has found significant differences in college entrance levels between charter school graduates and ""regular public school"" graduates in both Chicago and Florida. The two areas were selected for research because they are so different in many other social, economic, and cultural respects.  Charter school students have double the percentage of college-bound graduates, and while studies and statistics are open to critiques, they do support the anecdotes in this movie; after all, statistics are simply aggregated anecdotes.

1357506,A1A535W556ROBQ,B003Q6D28C,James Ferguson,"[6, 8]","Seems Superman in this case is Ronald Reagan, as Guggenheim appears to side with the conservative view that the teachers unions are the drawback to the public education system, presenting a very positive case for the charter school system, which are not subject to the same collective bargaining agreements.  He unfairly contrasts the worst of the public school system with the best of the charter school system, charting a handful of families who try to get their kids into local charter schools because of the appalling reputations of local public schools.  He paints the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the NEA as the bad guys, blocking what he regards as meaningful reform, as was the case in DC when Michelle Rhee tried to impose sweeping changes to improve this decaying school system.  The good guys are charismatic administrators like Geoffrey Canada who created a charter school in Harlem, which boasts of leaving no child behind, resulting in a huge waiting list for his excellent school.  As a result, this is a very one-sided documentary which will probably have more parents clamoring to get their kids into the lotteries for these charter schools, and complaining all the more about how teachers' unions have corrupted the public school system.As Guggenheim points out, the public school system is managed at the federal, state and local levels, with a huge bureaucracy and conflicting agendas.  Yet, many public school systems do succeed thanks to administrators and teachers who have learned to work within the system and make meaningful changes.  But, Guggenheim ignores these successful public schools and instead holds up charter schools as the role models for our stagnating public school system, even as he notes only 1 in 5 of these charter schools achieve the education goals that have been set by succeeding presidential administrations.There are no easy answers.  Maybe if governors like Scott Walker tried to work with teachers' unions rather than try to destroy them we might see strides made toward improving school systems around the country.

I was glad that I discovered about what was really going and this film helped to reinforce that understanding.  It's heart breaking that I back-out and this film reminded me of my initial feelings. It's still hard in that I still want to be a teacher but under the ground rules that our government and the unions have placed, it's clear to me that there is an element that is destroying the possible academic possibilities for our children in America (programing and propaganda).I went and looked at all of the bad reviews here at Amazon for this film to actually try to understand the other side. Let me explain my reason for looking.  I am back in school again after 20 years in the military to get a leadership degree and this film was assigned to our class where as I was required to present both sides of the issue. Some of the opposing reviews here on Amazon are reasonable and honest but most are presented to deflect and to avoid personal responsibility.Bottom line:  A lot of sloppy and selfish adults are trying to get paid and the children are left with the crumbs and this film shows that.This is not to assume that I think there are teachers deserving less, there are many that deserve more but this film will help to show the classic example of poor leadership, thus the good teachers and our children are the losers.All one has to do is to observe the public school system in America, and compare it internationally to other countries and their school systems to recognize that our children are the losers, thus America is imploding.The truth of this film shows what is going on in our public/government ran education system and it's a real shame.",3,"The painful observation and the proof to kept Control, via the U.S. Government.",1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1758,"['had', 'thought', 'being', 'teacher', 'even', 'retiring', 'using', 'troops', 'program', 'was', 'glad', 'discovered', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'film', 'helped', 'reinforce', 'understanding', 'heart', 'breaking', 'back-out', 'film', 'reminded', 'initial', 'feelings', 'still', 'hard', 'still', 'want', 'be', 'teacher', 'ground', 'rules', 'government', 'unions', 'have', 'placed', 'clear', 'element', 'destroying', 'possible', 'academic', 'possibilities', 'children', 'America', 'programing', 'propaganda', '.I', 'went', 'looked', 'bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'film', 'actually', 'try', 'understand', 'other', 'side', 'Let', 'explain', 'reason', 'looking', 'am', 'back', 'school', 'again', '20', 'years', 'military', 'get', 'leadership', 'degree', 'film', 'was', 'assigned', 'class', 'where', 'was', 'required', 'present', 'sides', 'issue', 'opposing', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'are', 'reasonable', 'honest', 'most', 'are', 'presented', 'deflect', 'avoid', 'personal', 'responsibility.Bottom', 'line', 'lot', 'sloppy', 'selfish', 'adults', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'paid', 'children', 'are', 'left', 'crumbs', 'film', 'that.This', 'not', 'assume', 'think', 'are', 'teachers', 'deserving', 'less', 'are', 'many', 'deserve', 'more', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'show', 'classic', 'example', 'poor', 'leadership', 'thus', 'good', 'teachers', 'children', 'are', 'losers.All', 'one', 'do', 'observe', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'America', 'compare', 'internationally', 'other', 'countries', 'school', 'systems', 'recognize', 'children', 'are', 'losers', 'thus', 'America', 'imploding.The', 'truth', 'film', 'what', 'going', 'public/government', 'ran', 'education', 'system', 'real', 'shame']",N/A

1357510,ATWX9WCEACYYW,B003Q6D28C,J. Blilie,"[54, 99]","Davis Guggenheim appears to be auditioning to be the Michael Moore of the anti-union movement in the US.  I have rarely seen such a one-sided and data-free screed presented.The most conspicuous feature of this film is its absolutely, willfully, blinkered ignoring of any data and especially any causal factors in low student achievement - except for Guggenheim's villains of the piece:  Teachers and their unions.  He even cues up the Jaws music when the union leaders are shown.  This is an exercise in blame:  Placing all the blame for poor student performance on teachers and their unions.  And I mean all of it:  No other groups are apportioned ANY responsibility for student performance in this film, including, conspicuously, the parents and the students themselves, who are presented as passive victims rather than the most important actors in the story.For instance, he blames schools and teachers, entirely, for the fact that kids don't show up for school.  Do the parents, neighborhood, and the kids themselves (the actual ones failing to show up) have ANY responsibility here?  Does accountability extend only to teachers?  Apparently, for Davis Guggenheim, it does.Mr. Guggenheim would like you to believe that the following have no impact on student performance:  Parental involvement, income level, educational level of the parents, the surrounding culture in which the children live, violence, drug addiction and dealing, unemployment, incarceration rates among the parents and relations of the students, sleep, nutrition, etc.  They are not even given lip-service in the film, not even acknowledged as factors.  All people involved in education know that parental involvement is the most important factor in student performance.  This all-important factor is tacitly waved away with a handful of anecdotes.Mr. Guggenheim presents a tiny handful of involved parents (anecdotes) and you are supposed to believe that they accurately represent the norm in the school districts shown in the film, and by implication, all struggling school districts.  This is nonsense.  He also looks at a tiny sample of the school population (in highly unusual schools) and tries to imply that these examples could be just up-sized to the whole population and all issues would be solved.Mr. Guggenheim presents the KIPP Academies and Geoffrey Canada's Harlem Children's Zone's Promise Academies as successful models for public education.  All can acknowledge that they do good work.  The numbers of students presented for these two systems are, if I'm remembering correctly from the film, 3000 students and 24,000 students.  Let's round up to a total of 30,000 students.  There are approximately 50 million students in K-12 in US schools (and based on how the film presents them we should conclude that almost all of them are terrible students).  His examples account for 6 one-hundredths of 1 percent of the student population (0.06%, about 1/20th of 1%, or 1 out of every 1700 students).  A miniscule sample size indeed.What is never presented in the film is how these example schools do their work (a rather glaring omission).  (Most basically:  What are their class sizes?)  You're left to infer that they got rid of the unions and that took care of everything (though it's still unclear whether their teachers are unionized or not).  I've heard both Davis Guggenheim and Geoffrey Canada interviewed at length.  How do they do it?  They do it by working the teachers much harder and longer and more invasively than is reasonable.For instance:  Longer work days, evening teaching/tutoring, summer school, weekend tutoring, teachers on call 24/7 on their private cell phones, teachers going into the students' homes and doing their homework with them.  (Teachers already spend many hours per week outside of school hours preparing, grading, etc.:  It is very far from a 40-hour per week job.)  Anyone would consider such expansion of their work to be a huge pay cut and an extreme invasion of their private lives.  (And, unsurprisingly, these are just the sort of workplace degradations that unions resist.)  This isn't teaching, this is surrogate parenting.  This is expecting teachers to devote their entire lives (not their working hours) to educate and support other people's kids, instead of their own families.  You may be able to find a few super-dedicated people willing to sacrifice their lives for other people's kids.  This is not a viable option for 99% of teachers, who, not surprisingly, expect it to be a job and to have time off and to be able to participate in their own families.One of the examples shown in the film is a boarding school in LA that takes the students 24 hours a day and does not allow TV, video games, etc.  This is (stern, intensive) surrogate parenting, not teaching.  We are left to wonder about the tiny class sizes in this school and the labor costs of parenting the kids 24/7.I called in a question to Mr. Guggenheim during a radio interview:  I asked what happens to the kids whose parents do not fulfill their contracts with the school (among other things, he said (in the interview, not in the film) that the parents in these schools have to sign a contract with obligations to support their student).  He didn't answer.  I can:  They go back into the failing public school that has no choice but to take all comers.  They have to take the kids whose parents can't hack KIPP or HCZ, those kids who misbehave and are expelled from private schools, those kids who are special needs and cost too much for the private schools and the special academies.The reason Mr. Guggenheim doesn't present the actual methods used in these schools is that they are not teaching, but surrogate parenting.  He is tacitly but clearly acknowledging what all educators know:  Parental involvement is the most important factor in student performance.  All his examples are surrogate parenting + teaching.Many things are presented in misleading ways in this film.  For instance:Guggenheim shows (fake) charts that indicate:  Great teachers produce better student performance (test scores).  Well, how were those teachers rated great?  By their students test scores.  So, teachers with students with great test scores have students with great test scores.  Very enlightening.He presents rising educational spending against flat achievement without giving the reasons for the increasing spending, which are largely a continuous stream of Federal and State mandates, conspicuously the ""mainstreaming"" of special needs kids formerly placed in other institutions, which both increase costs and dictate higher achievement standards.  (What is the y-axis on that chart, and how is it normalized?)  Many special needs kids require a full time aid:  One employee dedicated to a single student.  Does that cost money?He compares the ""best teachers"" - say the top 5% - against the ""worst teachers"" - say the bottom 5% - and notes that the top group does much better than the bottom group.  Is this a surprise to anyone?  Comparing the best to the worst among ANY group will produce this result!  It's in the definition of the proposition:  We DEFINE the best or top people as being much better than the bottom or worst.Mr. Guggenheim notes that a lower percentage of teachers lose their certification due to performance (1 in 1600) than lawyers or doctors do.  This is supposed to imply that bad teachers are retained in crazy numbers.  Of course, some bad teachers are retained, as in any profession.  But he fails to note that between 5% and 9% of teachers permanently leave the profession annually (between 1 in 20 and 1 in 11) and these percentages have risen steadily since the 1980s.  50% call it quits within their first 5 years on the job.  The ones that remain can usually hack it.  (Teacher Attrition and Mobility:  Results from the 2004-05 Teacher Follow-up  Survey, January 2007, National Center for Education Statistics)In the end, all Mr. Guggenheim has is anecdotes from a tiny fraction of the students in the country in a few highly unusual schools.  He would have you believe that if we just busted the teachers' unions (the dream of the current crop of GOP governors) then all would be sweetness and light and the ""achievement gap"" would disappear, all the kids in those tough urban districts would come back to school and complete their high school education and go on to college.  If those lazy, incompetent teachers can just be put back in their place - like back in the good old days when they were poorly paid, had no voice and no protections, and did what they were told - all will be well.

Think of your circle: board chair, boss, direct reports, colleagues, donors, key volunteers, etc. Are they readers or listeners? What's your preferred style? Does your circle know that?I'm a reader. I comprehend more by reading than by listening.  Yet, Drucker's counsel has caused me to be sympathetic to listeners--so this review is for listeners.  If you'll listen (and view) this DVD for just one hour and 43 minutes, it may change the way you think about telling your story.While the subject matter of Waiting for ""Superman"" (the movie was released in 2010, the DVD arrived this past February) appears to be of the ho-hum educational documentary variety--don't kid yourself (no pun intended). It's riveting.  You might agree or disagree with the content, but that's not why I'm recommending it.My gut though is that you'll resonate with the dismal shape of education in America. The up-close-and-personal student stories will touch you and the dedication of school administrator and teacher heroes will inspire you. But that's not why I'm recommending it.While viewing the DVD last week, I counted at least seven things you can learn about telling your organization's story. So here's my recommendation: schedule a two-hour staff lunch.  Order the pizza and the popcorn and presto--you'll have an add-water-and-stir staff meeting. Create a worksheet handout with these questions:1) What problem does this documentary film address? Why has this problem remain unsolved for so long?2) What approach did the director, Davis Guggenheim, employ to pull the viewer's mind and heart into the subject matter?3) In your opinion, what were the three most creative techniques he used to communicate his message (both the problems and the solutions)?4) What graphic arrested your attention the most? Do you remember the statistics that accompanied the graphic? Why was it so memorable?5) What individual's story grabbed your heart?6) This is not a faith-based documentary. But if it were, what would be your rallying cry to your faith-based audience--to inspire them to be part of the solution?7) What did you appreciate most about the film?8) If you had a small team, a camera, and one week--what story about your organization would you like to put on film--and why?

1357517,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B003Q6D28C,kacunnin,"[6, 14]","WAITING FOR SUPERMAN sets up a very simple thesis: American public education has been hijacked by the teachers unions.  The title of the film comes from director Davis Guggenheim's story about a young boy learning that Superman doesn't exist.  ""Who will come and save us if there's no Superman?"" the film asks.  Charter schools will, Guggenheim insists - if only the teachers' unions will get out of the way.The film focuses on five children from major US cities whose parents are hoping to get them out of horrible, failing public schools by entering them in a series of charter school lotteries.  Charter schools, says Guggenheim, are good schools.  They have dedicated teachers, longer school hours, a longer school year, and better success rates overall.  Charter school students wear uniforms, they chant in unison, they don't fight or misbehave, and they're always smiling.  This, says the film, is what we want for our children.  This is what they deserve.  But something is preventing it from being possible.Teachers' unions, Guggenheim concludes, are to blame for both the proliferation of terrible public schools and the limited availability of charter school alternatives.  The unions are making it impossible for principals to fire bad teachers (once a teacher gets tenure, Guggenheim insists, he can't be fired without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money).  So bad teachers keep teaching, even if they do nothing all day but read the newspaper while their students play games and fool around.  Guggenheim gives us video footage supposedly shot by a student in just such a class.  The teachers are even telling their students, ""I don't have to teach you anything, because I have tenure and I can't be fired.""  And even teachers who do get removed from the classroom are warehoused in so-called ""rubber rooms"" where they do nothing for eight hours each day, collecting their full union-sanctioned paychecks.  This is what the unions do, says the film - they protect the bad teachers and make it impossible for public schools to do a better job educating our children.On top of that, the unions are fighting to block the spread of charter schools, which threaten their hold on public education in this country.  A successful charter school makes the failing public schools look even worse . . . so the unions must oppose charter schools whenever they can.  They must also oppose anyone who threatens their monopoly.  Guggenheim shows us a potential hero in DC Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee, who found herself battling the unions in an attempt to turn around the failing DC school system.  She proposed ending tenure and offered DC teachers a chance to earn six-figure salaries based on performance.  But the evil union blocked her at every step.  Of course the film leaves out much of the controversy surrounding Rhee's time as DC Chancellor, including the suspicion that at least half of the schools in the District had cheated to increase their test scores (when your job is totally dependent on how well kids do on a standardized test, cheating is going to happen).The problem with WAITING FOR SUPERMAN is that it oversimplifies a very complicated problem.  Bad teachers and intractable teachers' unions might be part of the problem - but so are poverty, poor nutrition, lack of parental involvement, student disinterest, drugs, gangs, violence, and general apathy.  The parents highlighted in this film are dedicated to their children's education.  Their children seem bright, focused, and well-behaved.  Nowhere do we see examples of the kinds of children and parents most commonly seen in failing inner city schools.  The frustrations teachers experience in such classrooms can be overwhelming.  Poor teacher performance is as much about class size, student motivation, and parental support as it is about test scores (which, after all, are the only indicator used to determine how successful a teacher is - if his students do well on standardized tests, he must be good; if they do not, he must be bad).WAITING FOR SUPERMAN does effectively pull us into the lives of five families, but it also beats us over the head with the evils of unions and bad teachers.  At the same time, the film ignores the fact that while some charter schools have been proven successes, far more have done as poorly (or worse) than the neighborhood public schools they are replacing.  It also says nothing about the corporate money behind many charter schools, or about the fact that the ultimate involvement of charter school parents is a huge plus in the success of those schools (parents who are willing to complete complicated forms, stand in long lines, and attend public lotteries are exactly the kinds of parents who will provide the support necessary for their children and their schools).I applaud Guggenheim for making a film about the troubles of our education system, but I wish he had been less focused on vilifying teachers' unions and more open to looking at ways to improve overall education in America.  If we continue to judge our teachers by standardized test scores earned by their students, we will never reclaim our position as a top-performing nation in education.  Students need to learn how to think, not how to answer multiple-choice questions.  And they need to learn that waiting for a ""superman"" to solve problems is an exercise in futility.  We don't need Superman; we need a willingness to work together to help our children learn and grow.",2,"Over-simplified documentary points blame, but lacks credibility",1327536000,"01 26,

This is not merely the best movie to appear in years, it's the only movie worth watching.Whenever I view a movie in a theater or rent a movie, I somehow can't help but be reminded of the words of ol'Country Joe McDonald: ""The theater darkened. An image filled the screen. I thought, 'OH MY GAWD! IT'S THE SAME OLD [CRAP]!' Know what I mean?""That's certainly true of the movies critics and audiences have recently raved about.The King's Speechis yet another example of the Kindly- Psychotherapist-Unlocks-Childhood-Trauma-and-Cures-Patient movie that's been made over and over for years.The Social Networkis nothing more thanPirates of Silicon Valleydone over in washed-out brown color (possibly because it was shot in video and edited inFinal Cut).Despite its pretensions,Inceptionspends $180,000,000 to make one more car-chase-and-gunfight movie.Other movies are all on the level of comic books, which is why we have Batman, Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, &c.;, &c.; That's it? That's the best Hollywood can do? Comic books? The lowest common denominator?Finally, despite having ""Superman"" in the title, here's a serious movie for a serious audience. How beautiful it is to see someone admirable, someone with natural charisma (Geoffrey Canada, the CEO of the Harlem Children's Zone) who is not an actor.The cinematography is superb; the animation is clever. There are too many great scenes in it to mention them all. A father (who is obviously worried out of his wits) repeatedly tells his daughter to cross her fingers. Then, the camera shows the girl's hands balled into tiny fists. The scene of her swallowing her tears is heartbreaking. I defy anyone to name another movie with a scene of comparable poignancy. I find it difficult to summon the same degree of emotional involvement for any actors as I did with the kids in ""Waiting for Superman."" You just ache for them to get a break.This is movie-making at it's finest, and even thesoundtrack music by Christophe Beckis outstanding, but before you rush out into the streets to champion the cause of better education or merely visit the website the movie repeatedly touts, stop and think if you want your opinions on education to be formed by nothing more than a single movie. Davis Guggenheim is a superb polemicist, but he's not an educator. Maybe you should read a teensy-bit more about the problems of education before drinking (as some reviewers here have apparently done) the Kool-Aid.This is a movie review, so I'll refrain from voicing any opinion about the merits of charter schools (depending on whom you listen to, some are better than public schools, and some are worse; the one near my home has brought property values down because the police have frequently been called to it) or the hot topic of collective bargaining and union contracts. I will, however, object to one aspect of the movie that is deplorable.As I mentioned, Geoffrey Canada is a helluva guy, but the movie fails to mention that he's making a handsome $400,000 a year, and that his school group has privately-contributed assets of over $400,000,000. Instead of each of his students going on to college, as the movie would have us believe, many have been thrown out into the street. (ReadWhatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and Americafor a full account.)The movie touts the miracles of the Green Dot schools in LA and then shows Bill Gates speaking of the necessity of such schools, but it fails to mention that the Gates Foundation has invested in these schools. The movie is an advertisement for charter schools without revealing who the sponsors are.Isn't that . . . uhm . . . like . . . *dishonest*?Davis Guggenheim is a brilliant movie maker, perhaps the best we have, but as with his previous ""documentary"" (read: propaganda)An Inconvenient Truth,he cherry-picks his examples and distorts facts. I can't overemphasize how beautiful ""Waiting for Superman"" is, but you shouldn't thoughtlessly swallow Guggenheim's views any more than you would accept the views of Michael Moore orLeni Riefenstahlwithout question. America is in a sad state when the citizens listen only to the opinions of actors, TV and radio personalities and movie directors.ADDENDUM: In the August 21,2011 New York Times Book Review, there's a highly informative review by Sara Mosle that covers issues raised in Class Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools by Steven Brill, a book that echos Waiting for Superman in its advocacy of charter schools. The review, however, raises objections to such boosterism, and it cites a 2009 study which concluded that 80% of charter schools do no better or perform worse than public schools.There are many arguments, both pro and con, about charter schools, and I'll repeat that as fine as this movie is, people need to get more information from other sources.",5,Repeat after me: IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[8, 24]","I've been closely following education for about 40 years, and was an early-on proponent of vouchers, teacher testing, more pupil testing, etc. Eventually I realized that both the liberal (more money) and conservative prescriptions (more choice) were wrong. Improving American education outcomes is both very simple and impossible, once one casts aside ideologies and PC blinders.When I went to school, the best students were almost ALWAYS Asians or Jews. Period. That should have told us all we needed to know. Instead, new complex and tortured theories have been invented to explain why all pupils (supposedly) have equal ability. Meanwhile, more money has accomplished nothing, and the best students continue to be Asians or Jews. Even conservatives' great hope, Michelle Rhee, failed - turns out those 'improvements' were largely dishonest, contrived, and artificial. (If its any consolation, Michelle's far from the first educator to have built their 'accomplishments' on the sands of fact-free/distorted ideologies and sloppy data.)What eventually opened my eyes was the opportunity to read studies by the late Harold Stevenson, Univ. of Michigan - Psychology, that compared Asian and American pupils, parents, and schools. The most obvious and glaring difference - they try much harder (like Avis), and their parents are almost never satisfied with either their children's' efforts or achievements, or the demands placed upon them by their local schools. So they send their children to extra schooling - weekends, and summers, and never lose focus on preparing for their 'college-entrance exams.' Thus, the simplest 'solution' would be to simply blame our poor relative performance on Confucius and his emphasis on education and hard work. (I thought that was 'our secret' to success, per the Protestant Ethic!)In addition, other researchers repeatedly and credibly report that the average Asian IQ runs about 12 points higher than the average American; that's two-thirds of a standard deviation, an awful lot!Bottom-Line: American pupils will never work as hard as Asian children. Neither will they ever have equivalent raw material between their ears. Instead, we'll continue to waste time and enormous amounts of money assuaging our liberal and conservative ideologies.

It focuses primarily on urban families typically too poor to have options for their children's primary and secondary education.  We follow several families who resort to charter school lotteries in an attempt to get a decent education for their kids.  Although the film is filled with plenty of facts and figures that suggest the issues are broad and across the board, the featured minority families may give the impression that it is isolated.  I also would have liked to see the perspective of the teachers unions who are blasted in this doc. especially on the issue of tenure.  I've heard union chief Randi Weingarten on TV before and she seems like a poor spokesperson.  Here she is just shown in clips firing up her troops.  The scary part of this film is that many of the students pushed through drop out factories end up in prison which costs more than if we had sent them to private school.  The sad part is that we know the problem.  We've had educators actually fix the problem in local areas but as a country we don't have the balls to address it head on.

While there are two sides to every story, and this movie is focused on one side, you don't have to hear the other to realize the implacable problems facing our nation's public school system. Are you a fan of labor unions or, more specifically, teacher's unions? You probably won't like this movie. Like so many new documentaries focusing on the problems growing from organized labor, this movie also shows how soething that started out as a force for good can become a force for bad when it comes into power.As a former teacher, myself, I was amazed by the problems schools faced and the inability to deal with some of them. The apathy and resistance to real changes by the incumbent power of the unions is just enormous. I've taught in both private and public schools, and believe me: There is a world of difference between the two. Like the director of the movie, you want to root for all the good teachers out there who try their best every day, but when faced by the enormity of the societal problems and broken tenure system of the schools, you just want to cry or throw up your hands, pull your kids out of the public schools and send them to a better place. If only I had the money to send my own kids to a private school or have them homeschooled! Certainly not all teachers are bad. Most are not! But how broken is a system that protects and promotes poor performers? What kind of business model is that? Could a company succeed if it never addressed or corrected its weak links? Why should that be the case with schools (or other governmental work forces)?This is both an informative and touching movie, and one you'll not soon forget.

See this film, and you will feel anger, sadness, outrage and hopefully, inspiration. Not bad things for any film to inspire.In the recent past, many Americans became outraged at the prospect of healthcare reform and the possibility of rationing of services. That is EXACTLY what is happening when districts hold lotteries for admission to quality schools. Too many applicants seeking too few seats results in the rationing of quality education. This should have parents marching in the streets in anger. Why it does not is beyond me. This is what happens in third world countries.One aspect that I like about this film, is that it does not shy away from leveling blame at all parties. While the tenure system and teachers' unions are largely placed in the crosshairs, nobody seems to be without some degree of fault here. The producers of this film should be commended for their candor.After seeing the film, I actually emailed Ms. Rhee, and asked her, among other things, why so many parents seem to want to improve education as a whole, but are reluctant to embrace change at a local level. I speak from experience in that when Denver Public Schools attempts to close a school or replace staff, it is met with parent protest, accusations of racism and the like. Ms. Rhees' response to me was that while parents will usually want the best for their kids, it is hard to embrace the new, when human nature wants the familiar, even if it leads to detriment. This makes a lot of sense when you think about it.Given the current economy, I cannot help but think that a big part of our competitive edge as a nation depends on our schools.

If our teachers are central to the performance of a school, how can we reconcile poor performance with an uncritical view of teachers? Are bad schools only in slums? Can children brought up in poverty excel in school?Waiting for Superman is not an attack on teachers. If anything its a testament to the critical importance of good teachers. Guggenheim's research shows the amazing effect that good teaching can have on a very large population of students. But he also presents the corallary. Just as good teaching saves lives, bad teaching destroys them. And unfortunately Americans have allowed a system to develop where good teachers get no rewards and bad teachers are almost never fired. The problem is not necessarily spending. We have more than doubled our per student expenditures since the 1960s (even adjusting for inflation) and are turning out graduates who are not college ready.Guggenheim follows the history of American schools showing how up until the 1970s American public schools were the best in the world. He shows how the lack of global competition made us look awfully good. Unfortunately schools need to be better then they were fifty years ago, when they were expected to turn out high school classes where 20% of the kids went to college. Nowadays schools need to turn out graduating classes where just about everybody is ready for a four year college--and very few school districts are doing it. To make the story hit home, Guggenheim profiled several students waiting to get into Charter Schools, schools which are run by different rules than most public schools, and have a history of success. Watching these children observe the lottery that will determine whether they can attend, will break your heart.He also profiles Michelle Rhee, the take-no-prisoners Superintendent of the Washington, DC school system. As someone who lives right outside of DC, I have watched Rhee and applauded loudly as she has taken on every special interest that holds back education in Washington, DC. The movie showcases her wins in improving DC test scores. Unfortunately it misses the final chapter of Rhee's career, the defeat of Mayor Adrian Fenty, who put his own career on the line, in the interest of the children of Washington, DC. Rhee's future in DC is unknown but the incoming Democratic candidate for Mayor, who will run unopposed in November, supports many of the practices that Rhee fought. As Rhee sadly points out, much of this problem is adults not wanting to confront other adults.",5,We have to be our own Superman,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2656,"['Waiting', 'Superman', 'David', 'Guggenheim', 'riviting', 'documentary', 'America', 'school', 'systems', 'question', 'many', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'teachers', 'are', 'central', 'performance', 'school', 'how', 'can', 'reconcile', 'poor', 'performance', 'uncritical', 'view', 'teachers', 'Are', 'bad', 'schools', 'only', 'slums', 'Can', 'children', 'brought', 'up', 'poverty', 'excel', 'school', 'Waiting', 'Superman', 'not', 'attack', 'teachers', 'anything', 'testament', 'critical', 'importance', 'good', 'teachers', 'Guggenheim', 'research', 'amazing', 'effect', 'good', 'teaching', 'can', 'have', 'very', 'large', 'population', 'students', 'also', 'corallary', 'Just', 'good', 'teaching', 'saves', 'bad', 'teaching', 'unfortunately', 'Americans', 'have', 'allowed', 'system', 'develop', 'where', 'good', 'teachers', 'get', 'rewards', 'bad', 'teachers', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'fired', 'problem', 'not', 'necessarily', 'spending', 'have', 'more', 'doubled', 'student', 'expenditures', '1960s', 'even', 'adjusting', 'inflation', 'are', 'turning', 'out', 'graduates', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'college', 'ready.Guggenheim', 'history', 'American', 'schools', 'showing', 'how', 'up', '1970s', 'American', 'public', 'schools', 'were', 'best', 'world', 'how', 'lack', 'global', 'competition', 'made', 'look', 'awfully', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'schools', 'need', 'be', 'better', 'then', 'were', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'expected', 'turn', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'classes', 'where', '20', '%', 'kids', 'went', 'college', 'schools', 'need', 'turn', 'out', 'graduating', 'classes', 'where', 'just', 'everybody', 'ready', 'four', 'year', 'college', 'very', 'few', 'school', 'districts', 'are', 'doing', 'make', 'story', 'hit', 'home', 'Guggenheim', 'profiled', 'several', 'students', 'waiting', 'get', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'schools', 'are', 'run', 'different', 'rules', 'most', 'public', 'schools', 'have', 'history', 'success', 'Watching', 'children', 'observe', 'lottery', 'will', 'determine', 'can', 'attend', 'will', 'break', 'heart.He', 'also', 'Michelle', 'Rhee', 'take-no-prisoners', 'Superintendent', 'Washington', 'DC', 'school', 'system', 'someone', 'who', 'right', 'DC', 'have', 'watched', 'Rhee', 'applauded', 'loudly', 'taken', 'special', 'interest', 'back', 'education', 'Washington', 'DC', 'movie', 'wins', 'improving', 'DC', 'test', 'scores', 'Unfortunately', 'final', 'chapter', 'Rhee', 'career', 'defeat', 'Mayor', 'Adrian', 'Fenty', 'who', 'put', 'own', 'career', 'line', 'interest', 'children', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Rhee', 'future', 'DC', 'unknown', 'incoming', 'Democratic', 'candidate', 'Mayor', 'who', 'will', 'run', 'unopposed', 'November', 'many', 'practices', 'Rhee', 'fought', 'Rhee', 'sadly', 'out', 'much', 'problem', 'adults', 'not', 'wanting', 'confront', 'other', 'adults']",N/A

But ""Waiting for Superman"" has no vision on how to make those changes without first addressing political issues entirely beyond the scope of educational reform. Although the movie tacitly suggests that schools could resolve poverty, crime and broken families through the sheer awesomeness of good-looking, articulate Harvard graduates who really care, schools don't enjoy that kind of cultural power in the United States. And it's probably better that they don't.Guggenheim - whose previous film, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" is well-balanced compared to this screed - tells the story of five families - four poor, one quite wealthy - and their quests to get a child enrolled into a charter school. Why? Because their public school plum stinks, or, in the case of the suburban school,  it discriminates by putting lower-achieving students on a track toward diminished academic goals. The charter schools - which receive public funds, but far more money in private donations - have limited spaces, so enrollment must be determined by a live lottery.The drama in such a thing is inherent, and the most exploitative moments of ""Waiting for Superman"" involve Guggenheim interviewing these carefully-selected, cutesy-articulate grade-schoolers, then carefully selecting their cutest, most articulate answers to ratchet up the viewer's worry for lottery day. Not all of the kids secure a spot. The unfortunate are, unsurprisingly, devastated. So is the audience, now naturally attached to cute kids. Is that good filmmaking - or just shooting fish in a barrel?Around these emotional subplots, Guggenheim stuffs his film with factoids insisting  the inadequacy of American schools. He attempts to tie poor test results in math and reading to a few classic bogeymen: Bad teachers and the heavy-hitting teachers' unions that rep them. ""Waiting for Superman"" makes its case effectively enough - there's really no way to defend New York City's ""Rubber Room,"" where, thanks to union contracts, suspended teachers can get full pay for sleeping or reading magazines while they await disciplinary hearings - without explaining what, precisely, ""guarantees"" you're hiring a good teacher in the first place, and how long a teacher gets to be ""bad"" before they're ""good.""  Can anyone do that without reflexively pointing to the ""results"" the teacher produced?One flawed ""hero"" of the film is Michelle Rhee, former chancellor of schools in Washington, D.C. Her brazen plan for success boils down to firing a lot of teachers, principals and administrators, braying fruitlessly at unions, conducting every TV and magazine interview known to man, touting short-term test gains and staring like a menace at the parents who wail at her in public meetings. She lasted three years before resigning her job after the mayor who appointed her lost in a primary - precisely because he appointed her superintendent. Rhee, who trimmed lots of fats but left even more scars, now runs a nonprofit; I presume she'll become a millionaire.The other is Geoffrey Canada, who runs the Harlem's Children Zone, a charter educational program in one of the nation's toughest neighborhoods. Does HCZ work? The film argues yes, and frankly, it's impossible to argue: Canada's emphasis on college placement and total immersion in the educational process will naturally produce kids who succeed in school - on a small scale. Extrapolate Canada's idea out to the thousands of students who attend NYC public schools, and you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars to fund it. Who has that kind of loot?And therein lies the fundamental problem of ""Waiting for Superman:"" The title is ironic. Canada recounts the day when, as a child, he learned Superman wasn't real, and wouldn't solve Harlem's problems, and yet the movie touts these hyper-expensive, ""Superman"" solutions of year-round school and ten-hour school days and boarding-school dorms as a legitimate method of educating the nation's children. And it is legitimate - if you want to pay for it. Because charter schools sure as heck aren't going to pay for themselves if they charge no tuition.Not that charter schools are bad. But a lot of them ultimately fail -  few get that kind of private funding HCZ enjoys - and they can only serve a fraction of the population. What's the point of creating academies that can only be accessed by the sheer luck of the lottery ball? The movie lays into unions, but the cities themselves negotiated those intractable contracts. Why? Guggenheim never addresses the leading problem with bad schools - their tie-in to property taxes, which tend to be virtually non-existent in low-income areas. Who pays property taxes on bombed-out streets of blight? Nobody - the city owns the land. But if Guggenheim had taken dead aim at the matter, he would have been on the hook for suggesting mere excellence can't overcome a flaw in funding. And that wouldn't have been in keeping with the message of the movie.Which is what? Some lemonheaded, meritocratic notion that elite effort, presence and just plain belief, man, can overcome all. As the creative closing credits roll after ""Waiting for Superman,"" Guggenheim, ever the fundraiser, keeps admonishing the audience to text ""POSSIBLE"" to a phone number and visit his Web site to schedule a home DVD party. What's the endgame here? Better teacher accountability?  Smaller classrooms? Magnet schools for everyone? Is there a price tag? And once all the rotten teachers are swept away - well into the tens of thousands, no doubt - where are their replacements found? No, not for hubs of art and culture like DC and NYC. But, say, Wichita and Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Gary, Ind.? What about districts where test results aren't quite bad enough to necessitate the luxury solution? Do they at least get the sport coupe?To pretend this problem isn't a major policy undertaking, involving a recalibration of priorities -on spending, on crime prevention, on wage inequality - and literally trillions of dollars, is a dangerous lie of youth or, at worst, a con perpetuated by idealists who wormed their way into the system, made some waves, then got out with their philosophy intact. Are a few kids smarter? Sure. But none the wiser.",2,Still waiting for plausible solutions,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,6832,"['Long', 'rage', 'short', 'solutions', 'Waiting', 'Superman', 'more', 'political', 'tool',

The film is extremely eye-opening, showing just how bad a state most of our education systems are in. They clearly illustrate that no matter the area, teachers are failing America's youth at an alarming rate. I found the film to be very biased though, as it only points out what's wrong with the system, and fails to mention any of the positives that still exist in education. It also fails to offer solutions for the problems. Guggenheim throws lots of facts and figures at us and repeats the same themes.

Blaming teachers for everything wrong makes no sense, since they are but one link in a complex chain.  Also, the narrator has a very halting style of talking that is distracting.  And Michelle Rhee?

1357554,A1XE2JOZZKMEG6,B003Q6D28C,Wikileaker,"[19, 29]","The gist of ""Waiting for Superman"" is that the entire blame for the sad state of the nation's public schools are the lazy and selfish teachers and their unions. All other problems and obstacles are neglected, save for passing and indirect references to three of the lesser ones. 1) There is one lonely passing mention of ""difficulties at home"" that students bring into the classroom. These go unnamed. Indirectly, only through the highlight on the success of the KIPP schools are the other two problems raised: 2) lack of a ""culture of excellence"" and high expectations of students and 3) insufficient time spent in the classroom. These last two items are not dealt with directly; the viewer is expected to infer them from the fact that the KIPP schools are successful and they feature in the KIPP program.To be sure, teacher quality IS of utmost gravity. But in a feature-length documentary, it is remiss to entirely ignore the host of other important factors that impinge on this issue. No mention is made of the problems of discipline or bullying. Student nutrition. Failing infrastructure. Lack of parental involvement, even apathy. Time wasted by students in and out of the classroom on non-learning social activities, particularly drugs, television, computer games, World Wide Web, and Facebook.The film states as a fact that the teacher unions are the single largest lobbying bodies in the USA, getting laws passed that protect their members from corrective and punitive actions for non-performance. This is patently false. In fact, the biggest lobbying arm in the nation is the financial sector: investment banks, commercial banks, mortgage lenders, credit card companies, rating agencies, accounting firms, tax law firms, etc. etc. In the aggregate the financial sector's lobbying effort easily dwarfs the next three largest COMBINED. Here I will present no proof of this, but it should be only commonsense to grasp that in a capitalistic society the largest business sector will be that of money. If someone wishes to challenge this assertion of mine, I will be sure to come back here and serve up the proof.Back to the film. This outright falsehood on the part of the presenter is evidence of the shrill tone the entire film takes toward the public education system. Another thing I noticed in this regard is the child Daisy who is presented as an innocent, precocious, pretty little girl trapped in a nightmarish education system. But notice that throughout the film, she wears the EXACT same outfit -- pink top with blue vest. Yet she is presented in various activities at various times in her life when it is so obvious all her scenes were shot in a single session. Her lines were also obviously written for her. Could not have been more shrill.The film DOES present some pertinent facts, such as the practice of ""tracking"", and the difficulties of getting things done in such a vast stultifying bureaucracy. For this minor achievement, I award a single star above the minimum.The film makes one most glaring omission, and an obvious one (or at least it should be obvious). VOUCHERs. Families condemned to miserable school districts could simply be issued vouchers by the government so that they can enroll in quality private schools. This is not even mentioned as a possibility.Another problem is the ridiculous state of the nation's daycare system. It makes zero sense to not nurture children's furiously growing brains and minds in their preschool years. Children at this age cannot be stopped from learning about the world and how to think about it. If they are properly stimulated during this critical period of their upbringing, they will be enthusiastic learners throughout all their school years and most importantly, their adult lives. As one smart fellow once said, kids don't drop out of high school -- they drop out of the second grade and then just ""hang around"" for another eight or nine years.Perhaps the biggest problem of all deserves its own special paragraph: that of culture. I refer not to the aforementioned ""culture of excellence"" (which is assuredly of critical importance), but the fact of our contemporary societal ""dumbing down"". Intelligence and knowledge are no longer valued as they once were. It's cool now to be dumb and ignorant.This is no understatement. Just last week, the first week of November 2011, Tavis Smiley had an interview with Harvard physicist Lisa Randall. Mr. Smiley asked Dr. Randall if she was concerned with the state of the nation's schools, and she replied that it is the single greatest threat to the USA. People these days no longer respect facts, numbers, rational thinking, or the scientific method. This sort of environment fosters intellectual apathy in the children.The last thing about this film that really bothers me is the title, ""Waiting for Superman"". As if the despairing students and parents trapped in a poor school system can do NOTHING to help themselves. Not so! Why don't these parents band together and teach their kids themselves??? Is it too much to ask of them that they actually READ a BOOK on say, Algebra or English, and help their kids learn their lessons? Don't they have local libraries with internet access??? Why not get up off your tailbones and help yourselves, instead of ""Waiting for Superman"" to save you ???",2,too narrowly focused on the evil teachers; shrill and contrived,1320451200,"11 5,
