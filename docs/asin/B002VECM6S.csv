1292291,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B002VECM6S,,"[3, 5]","The Blind Side is a touching and always entertaining movie about an homeless African American teen named Michael (Quinton Aaron) that's taken in by a strong dominating white woman (Sandra Bullock) and her whipped husband (Tim McGraw). They buy him clothes, feed him and even help train him to get him ready to play football, among many other things.The movie is a little overly happy through-out, even the visit from Bullock to Michael's drug addict mother goes a lot better than you'd expect. I wonder how Bullock's character would have handled Precious's mother lol. Since in the Blind Side all the men certainly seem to just shut-up and do as she says. Tim McGraw isn't bad as her husband, but his character isn't developed much. He's just Bullock's yes man basically and she's his boss even if he does play her husband. Hell, when she's ready to bring home Michael for the first time and doesn't even ask, McGraw just says ""this is the part where I say yes"", is he whipped or what ? lol. While Quinton Aaron is good as a huge huggable teddy bear, he doesn't get many lines. Bullock says he changed her life, but we just see how she changed his, she was already a tough and dominating woman before she even met him.The movie may be about manly stuff like football and a big African American knocking people around playing the sport, but the Blind Side is really about the strong women that influenced Michael. I say women, because Kathy Bates' character tutors him to try and help him get his grades up, while Kim Dickens plays a teacher that also believes in Michael when no one else does.So yeah, I a had a small problem with how the Blind Side makes men look clueless in need of the help of women, it even makes Michael's football coach appear that way. Despite having a problem with that, there was still no doubt in my mind that I was watching a special movie and one of the best of 2009. It gets to you emotionally and Bullock is less over the top than I expected, she shows that she can do more than just bad romantic comedies. Bullock proves that she's right up there with good actresses like Julia Roberts and not just a poor man's Julia Roberts lol.",4,A Touching and Moving Story,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2162,"['Blind', 'Side', 'touching', 'always', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'homeless', 'African', 'American', 'teen', 'named', 'Michael', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'taken', 'strong', 'dominating', 'white', 'woman', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'whipped', 'husband', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'buy', 'clothes', 'feed', 'even', 'help', 'train', 'get', 'ready', 'play', 'football', 'many', 'other', 'things.The', 'movie', 'little', 'overly', 'happy', 'through-out', 'even', 'visit', 'Bullock', 'Michael', 'drug', 'addict', 'mother', 'lot', 'better', ""'d"", 'expect', 'wonder', 'how', 'Bullock', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'Precious', 'mother', 'lol', 'Blind', 'Side', 'men', 'certainly', 'seem', 'just', 'shut-up', 'do', 'Tim', 'McGraw', ""n't"", 'bad', 'husband', 'character', ""n't"", 'developed', 'much', 'just', 'Bullock', 'yes', 'man', 'basically', 'boss', 'even', 'play', 'husband', 'Hell', 'when', 'ready', 'bring', 'home', 'Michael', 'first', 'time', ""n't"", 'even', 'ask', 'McGraw', 'just', 'part', 'where', 'say', 'yes', 'whipped', 'what', 'lol', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'good', 'huge', 'huggable', 'teddy', 'bear', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'lines', 'Bullock', 'changed', 'life', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'changed', 'was', 'already', 'tough', 'dominating', 'woman', 'even', 'met', 'him.The', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'manly', 'stuff', 'football', 'big', 'African', 'American', 'knocking', 'people', 'playing', 'sport', 'Blind', 'Side', 'really', 'strong', 'women', 'influenced', 'Michael', 'say', 'women', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'character', 'tutors', 'try', 'help', 'get', 'grades', 'up', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'teacher', 'also', 'Michael', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'yeah', 'had', 'small', 'problem', 'how', 'Blind', 'Side', 'men', 'look', 'clueless', 'need', 'help', 'women', 'even', 'Michael', 'football', 'coach', 'appear', 'way', 'having', 'problem', 'was', 'still', 'doubt', 'mind', 'was', 'watching', 'special', 'movie', 'one', 'best', '2009', 'emotionally', 'Bullock', 'less', 'top', 'expected', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'bad', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Bullock', 'right', 'there', 'good', 'actresses', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'not', 'just', 'poor', 'man', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'lol']",N/A

1292318,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002VECM6S,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 11]","...from all the `unhelpful' votes I'm going to get because of this.Okay, let's forget the fact that Sandra Bullock should not have taken the Oscar from Carey Mulligan.  Let's forget the fact that the film itself had no place on Oscar's `Best Picture' ballot.  Let's just take a second to look at `The Blind Side' separated from the hype and the accolades and the attention and ponder on just what kind of film this really is.Okay, let's ponder over what kind of film I think this is.I went into `The Blind Side' thinking that it was going to be a sappy tear-jerker that pretty much had every clich&eacute; in the book and was basically carried by a single performance that made it worth watching.  What I got was sort of what I expected.  The film, thankfully, is no where near as sappy as it could have been, but it is littered (and I mean like inner-city trash dump littered) with clich&eacute;s and the performances in the film are near horrific, except for Sandra `I now have an Oscar' Bullock.Please understand that I ADORE Sandra Bullock and really think that the nomination was deserved (even if I wouldn't give her one) and was very happy for her when she won.Okay, here's the deal.  I liked this film.  It was good.  It was moving and touching and inspirational and really all those things you expect from a film like this.  That said, there is nothing original here and the way the film is constructed can, at times, teeter on annoying.  The film is a little too long for starters (the ending drags on a little too much) and there is a serious glimmer of `TV Movie of the Week' that runs through its veins.  The way that Michael's home life with the Tuohy's is established ran a little tired for me (I mean, I've seen this a million times before).  There just didn't seem to be much here to establish the film as memorable.I called every play so-to-speak before it came.As far as the acting is concerned, I remember saying to my wife that the reason Sandra was toted as the best actress this year was because she starred in a film where no one else could act.  I mean, Sandra comes across like acting royalty when paired with a bunch of people who don't know what they are doing, and I'm not just talking about the principle players here.  Tim McGraw is the only one that really holds his own here (he has such natural charisma, and I told my wife when the film ended that I would not be surprised to see him Oscar nominated sometime this decade).  The fact remains that even the extra's here are atrocious.  The actresses who play Leigh Anne's lunch buddies for example are just ridiculous.  Their approach to acting is awkward and laughable.  The actress who plays the `investigator' in the end is also just plain awful.  And then you have the main actors in the film.  Quinton Aaron only knows one emotion, and he plays it awfully one-note at that.  There are no layers to him.  He just mopes.  Lily Collins is barely there (literally and figuratively) and Jae Head has to be the WORST child actor I've seen in a long time.  His performance was the single most obnoxious thing I've seen all year.  It was borderline repulsive.BUT, Sandra really does shine here.  Like I said, her nomination was deserved.  She understands how to build a real woman, with heart and soul but also with flaws.  She doesn't shy away from exposing her vanity, but she also establishes a believable layer of motherly adoration.You love this woman by the films end.So, before you hop all over that `unhelpful' button, realize that I'm not `not recommending' this film.  In fact, I am recommending it in the end.  Like I said, the film is good, and Sandra borders `great'.  No, I don't think that the film should have garnered all the attention and accolades it did, and for me the over-praise did kill some of my respect for the film (it has so many faults that it bothers me it was labeled one of the top ten best films of the year) but it is entertaining and emotionally connected and it does present the audience with am inspiration story worth hearing.So watch it, just don't expect it to be flawless.",3,Someone needs to protect my blind side...,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,4094,"['unhelpful', 'votes', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'this.Okay', 'let', 'forget', 'fact', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'Oscar', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Let', 'forget', 'fact', 'film', 'had', 'place', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'ballot', 'Let', 'just', 'take', 'second', 'look', 'Blind', 'Side', 'separated', 'hype', 'accolades', 'attention', 'ponder', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'really', 'is.Okay', 'let', 'ponder', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'think', 'is.I', 'went', 'Blind', 'Side', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sappy', 'tear-jerker', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'clich', 'eacute', 'book', 'was', 'basically', 'carried', 'single', 'performance', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'sort', 'what', 'expected', 'film', 'thankfully', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'sappy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'littered', 'mean', 'inner-city', 'trash', 'dump', 'littered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'horrific', 'Sandra', 'now', 'have', 'Oscar', 'Bullock.Please', 'understand', 'ADORE', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'really', 'think', 'nomination', 'was', 'deserved', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'won.Okay', 'here', 'deal', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'moving', 'touching', 'inspirational', 'really', 'things', 'expect', 'film', 'said', 'nothing', 'original', 'here', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'can', 'times', 'teeter', 'annoying', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'starters', 'ending', 'drags', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'serious', 'glimmer', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'veins', 'way', 'Michael', 'home', 'life', 'Tuohy', 'established', 'ran', 'little', 'tired', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'here', 'establish', 'film', 'memorable.I', 'called', 'play', 'so-to-speak', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'remember', 'saying', 'wife', 'reason', 'Sandra', 'was', 'toted', 'best', 'actress', 'year', 'was', 'starred', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'act', 'mean', 'Sandra', 'acting', 'royalty', 'when', 'paired', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'principle', 'players', 'here', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'own', 'here', 'such', 'natural', 'charisma', 'told', 'wife', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'sometime', 'decade', 'fact', 'even', 'extra', 'here', 'are', 'atrocious', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'lunch', 'buddies', 'example', 'are', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'approach', 'acting', 'awkward', 'laughable', 'actress', 'who', 'investigator', 'end', 'also', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'then', 'have', 'main', 'actors', 'film', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'only', 'one', 'emotion', 'awfully', 'one-note', 'are', 'layers', 'just', 'mopes', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'barely', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Jae', 'Head', 'be', 'WORST', 'child', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'performance', 'was', 'single', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'was', 'borderline', 'repulsive.BUT', 'Sandra', 'really', 'shine', 'here', 'said', 'nomination', 'was', 'deserved', 'how', 'build', 'real', 'woman', 'heart', 'soul', 'also', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'exposing', 'vanity', 'also', 'believable', 'layer', 'motherly', 'adoration.You', 'love', 'woman', 'films', 'end.So', 'hop', 'unhelpful', 'button', 'realize', ""'m"", 'not', 'not', 'recommending', 'film', 'fact', 'am', 'recommending', 'end', 'said', 'film', 'good', 'Sandra', 'borders', 'great', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'attention', 'did', 'over-praise', 'did', 'kill', 'respect', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'faults', 'was', 'labeled', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'entertaining', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'present', 'audience', 'am', 'inspiration', 'story', 'worth', 'hearing.So', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'flawless']",N/A

He was a teenager living on his own in a run-down area of Memphis, TN.  A friend takes his own son and Michael to a private school where teachers learn that while Michael had not acquired any learning skills needed to do well in a traditional school setting, but that he had latent abilities to listen and learn.  Soon after he entered his new school, a well-to-do family took him in, gave him a place to stay, and provided stability to his life, for all the right reasons...his later success in football was never a primary concern.Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Touhy, a strong-willed woman who pulls Michael into her family.  Sometime later when a friend asks whether she is changing Michael's life, she answered ""No, he's changing ours.""When asked about ""The Blind Side"" Michael replied that ""It's pretty much all true, except that Mrs. Touhy didn't teach him how to play football, he already knew how to do that.""This is a heart-warming tale of what's best about the human spirit - the ability and willingness to reach out to another person in need and provide what they need.

Seriously??I mean, look, I like Sandra Bullock, got nothing against her, but ""best actress"" over Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep (in her delicious turn as Julia Child in ""Julie & Julia"")?  Not to mention newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, in ""Precious"" - now *that* was a remarkable performance!  I dunno, Bullock's performance here was adequate, mildly charming, but really contained very little fire to it, and hardly any surprises.  Plus, the movie was so predictable and vanilla... and so terribly, terribly condescending towards its subjects and its audience. Like ""Crash"" a few years earlier, the Oscar popularity of this tepid, cliche-filled after-school special is more indicative of the shallow, dysfunctional state of race relations in America than it is of any great depth or craftsmanship in the film itself.

I do like Sandra in it, but was it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. (as a comparison Julia Roberts' performance as Erin Brockovich was far superior) And to put that little kid front and center like that through the whole thing with his over-acting was a total distraction, unrealistic, and annoying. He was the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie for sure. And riiiiiiiiight...this little kid coached Mike making him the great football player that he is because a first grader knows more about football than any real coach does. Sure. Whatever. And TIM MCGRAW in a lead role? Who came up with that idea? Something tells me he didn't show up at the casting call and beat out everyone else out because he's a better actor than all the real actors out there. He's a country western SINGER with NO acting experience (or ability) as I found out from watching this movie.

Sandra Bullock delivers a fine performance as does the actor who plays Michael Oher. However, the acting performances of some of the other characters were pretty bad, some actually REALLY bad. And I have a hard time believing that most of the actual sequence of events really happened that way--the story seems to have been ""Hollywoodized"" quite a bit. Michael Oher fights off several armed gangbangers at once? He's a big guy, sure, but it seems likely that at least one of the gangbangers would have shot him. And the scene where Leah Anne threatens the gangbangers with guns was a little cheesey--""Oh yeah, well, I'll shoot you first, boy!""--that was basically what she was saying. Kind of wondering if that scene really happened.Tim McGraw as an actor? How about someone like Dennis Quaid playing Leah Anne's husband--that would have been a more appropriate casting, I think.The movie has some funny parts, but some would-be funny parts just come off as corny. The best part of this movie is the ending, since it's a happy one. So it's OK, but I wouldn't give it 5 stars, or even 4.

But that had nothing to do with the movie making.The direction was abysmal with every known Lifetime device being employed to fashion some emotion in the viewer. It never succeeds. It just made more annoyed at a wonderful story being mistreated by Hollywood just like what they did with Invictus.

There are certainly other performances out there worthy of that slot - case in point Abbie Cornish in Bright Star, Samantha Morton in The Messenger, Michelle Monaghan in Trucker.The only reasoning I can think of for these nominations is - White Guilt.

This movie is such a bleeding heart, unoriginal script, put into the hands of Hollywood's embraced nightmare of an actress. Bullock can't act, period! This movie is proof of that, not the contrary. I'm actually angered I wasted time watching it. A decent beginning is ruined the more Bullock we see. Targeted emotional, heart tugging (albeit un-original and hokey) script lines aimed at those who wouldn't know quality film from the assembly line crap being put out more these days. This movie isn't even Lifetime Network good, though that's the only place it deserves to be. And there's some stuff on Lifetime I do like. You throw in some emotional jerking scenes with darling Sandra, whose fans are just waiting to have something to cheer for, and you galvanize the forces. ""Brilliant????"" Sandra Bullock's is the worst actress today, maybe the past 50 years as far as those who people claim to be good, and that fact is only cemented by this movie. She's given predictable, emotionally manipulative lines that her fan base will cheer for. ""He's changing me!...I'm NRA and packing!"" YOO HOO! They should have handed out Bullock pom, poms for her fans to cheer with. Cliched, hokey lines all Sandra's fans were just waiting to cheer for. This script is b-grade at best, a cliched, manipulative, ""assembly line"" script to plug into a Hollywood darling, right out of Hollywood's ""instant nomination for a fave who hasn't won yet"" files. Seems to me the majority who love this movie are females, or Pavlovian youngens. That's no surprise. This movie reeks of FM cable channel movies and/or juvenile appeal. It's directed at those who don't know quality film. This is a rehashed story line hidden under the ""true story"" mask Hollywood so desperately uses for credibility for their films too often in order to jerk the emotions of it's viewers who they hope haven't seen it before, so that the viewers find it ""original and true."" This movie is made for TV standards. Bullock is the most horrid part of this at best, average made for Lifetime Channel movie, one that uses sympathy to milk it's viewers emotions away from its predictability. Bullock sucks. This is her 7th movie I forced my way thru and it was like sticking my hand in a fire after having been burned before, a mistake I'll never make again. I watched this flick on the insistence of friends, family and PR machines, to watch Bullock's ""best"" performance. It got worse as the movie progressed. I've seen better performances by Wilma Flintstone and Lisa Simpson, and I ain't kidding! It cracks me up what sells for quality these days in film. And easy suck ups when it comes to commentary. I'd rather hear Granny Clampett's (of Beverly Hillbillies fame) high whining voice for 24 hours uninterrupted than 1 more minute of the worst actress alive today.I anticipate the Bullock Bleeding Heart Army will also zap this post.

1292348,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002VECM6S,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","The Blind Side (2009) is one of those heartstrings-pulling, feel-good, underdog sports movies that we get every few years from Hollywood. It tries, like so many films before it, to mimic the success of Hoosiers (1987) and Rudy (1993). And I'm surprised to say that this one works! Or at least better than most. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. While it's not quite at the level that Hoosiers and Rudy share, it's the closest I've seen a sports movie get since them. As one of the ten films nominated in 2009 for the Best Picture Oscar, The Blind Side is really the story of the American Dream that we all idealize and strive for. It's the story of a talented young black athlete named Michael Oher who has challenges in school and at home. But what he needs is someone to help him dig himself out of the deep hole of problems he's been thrown into by his parents and society. Sandra Bullock, as Leigh Anne Tuohy, is the ""lifeguard"" that recognizes Michael's needs and she comes to his rescue, offering him a nurturing and safe place to live and a better high school to attend. She sees the love inside Michael and his unique talents for protecting those that he loves. He just needs to learn how to combine those talents with his natural athletic abilities so that he can perform at a high level on the football field, where he is pushed to perform due to his physical size.I can see why Sandra Bullock won her Best Actress Oscar for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy in this film. She is at the top of her game here like I haven't seen her since Speed (1994) and A Time To Kill (1996). She's been taking a lot of romantic comedies over the past decade, and her acting just wasn't going anywhere in those roles, even though her films had marginal financial success and she gained vast name recognition. It's with The Blind Side that she has taken the talent we've seen in her supporting roles and brought it to a leading role. After seeing The Blind Side this Fall, I'm not sure I agree with Bullock winning her Oscar for this role, but once again, I think the Academy was really awarding her for her body of work, which has culminated so far with The Blind Side.The Blind Side is another great looking film with beautiful cinematography and good production design. I wouldn't say that Director of Photography Alar Kivilo broke any new ground photographically, but his work here is nicely lit and saturated to give the movie the warmth that its viewers certainly feel. I think one thing missing from elevating this great visual package is a more moving musical score. I can't remember that music elevated anything for me during this film. It wasn't a bad score, but it was merely serviceable and didn't elevate the emotional punch that this film strives for.All in all, The Blind Side is a great family film that has something for everyone. I especially love young actor Jae Head as S.J., the fun and precocious son of Sandra Bullock's character. His relationship with Michael as a brother is both endearing and hilarious. Some of the best scenes in the film are between S.J. and Michael. And many of the family scenes where the entire family is at home eating, watching TV, or just goofing off, reminded me of similar times in my own life and family. The Blind Side is the rare film that appeals to a broad audience, but doesn't sacrifice too much of the artistry and creativity in the craft of film either. It finds a nice balance that wins in many areas.",3,Promoting the American Dream,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,3449,"['Blind', 'Side', '2009', 'one', 'heartstrings-pulling', 'feel-good', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movies', 'get', 'few', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'mimic', 'success', 'Hoosiers', '1987', 'Rudy', '1993', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'say', 'one', 'least', 'better', 'most', 'give', '3.5', '5', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'Hoosiers', 'Rudy', 'share', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sports', 'movie', 'get', 'one', 'ten', 'films', 'nominated', '2009', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Blind', 'Side', 'really', 'story', 'American', 'Dream', 'idealize', 'strive', 'story', 'talented', 'young', 'black', 'athlete', 'named', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'who', 'challenges', 'school', 'home', 'what', 'someone', 'help', 'dig', 'deep', 'hole', 'problems', 'been', 'thrown', 'parents', 'society', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'lifeguard', 'Michael', 'needs', 'rescue', 'offering', 'nurturing', 'safe', 'place', 'live', 'better', 'high', 'school', 'attend', 'love', 'Michael', 'unique', 'talents', 'protecting', 'just', 'learn', 'how', 'combine', 'talents', 'natural', 'athletic', 'abilities', 'so', 'can', 'perform', 'high', 'level', 'football', 'field', 'where', 'pushed', 'perform', 'due', 'physical', 'size.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'film', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Speed', '1994', 'Time', 'Kill', '1996', 'been', 'taking', 'lot', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'past', 'decade', 'acting', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'roles', 'even', 'films', 'had', 'marginal', 'financial', 'success', 'gained', 'vast', 'name', 'recognition', 'Blind', 'Side', 'taken', 'talent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'supporting', 'roles', 'brought', 'leading', 'role', 'seeing', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Fall', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'Bullock', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'think', 'Academy', 'was', 'really', 'awarding', 'body', 'work', 'culminated', 'so', 'far', 'Blind', 'Side.The', 'Blind', 'Side', 'great', 'looking', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'good', 'production', 'design', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Alar', 'Kivilo', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'photographically', 'work', 'here', 'nicely', 'lit', 'saturated', 'give', 'movie', 'warmth', 'viewers', 'certainly', 'feel', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'elevating', 'great', 'visual', 'package', 'more', 'moving', 'musical', 'score', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'music', 'elevated', 'anything', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'score', 'was', 'merely', 'serviceable', 'did', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'emotional', 'punch', 'film', 'for.All', 'Blind', 'Side', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'something', 'everyone', 'especially', 'love', 'young', 'actor', 'Jae', 'Head', 'S.J.', 'fun', 'precocious', 'son', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'brother', 'endearing', 'hilarious', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'S.J', 'Michael', 'many', 'family', 'where', 'entire', 'family', 'home', 'eating', 'watching', 'TV', 'just', 'goofing', 'off', 'reminded', 'similar', 'times', 'own', 'life', 'family', 'Blind', 'Side', 'rare', 'film', 'appeals', 'broad', 'audience', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'too', 'much', 'artistry', 'creativity', 'craft', 'film', 'nice', 'balance', 'many', 'areas']",N/A

1292350,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002VECM6S,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","Making schmaltzy movies is a thing Hollywood is overly good at. Music rises telling us when to get that lump in our throat. Actors talk softly with a glistening eye. And the love-fest ensues.If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the ""great white person saving the [insert minority here] other person from certain doom"" theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), ""Big Mike"" is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock,The Lake House) and her family. They do ""the good Christian thing"" and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college. He must overcome the whitewashed system of academia in upscale Memphis to do it, too. He soon receives help with the arrival of a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates,Charlotte's Web) who toughens up Michael's mental muscle and prepares him for his college days.Most of this is just backstory, however, for the main event, which is Michael's immediate rise onto the football circuit. His size and speed shock all those who watch his games, making him a prime candidate for college scouts.The film isn't without its funny moments, though, most of which are thanks to S.J. (Jae Head,Hancock), the Tuohy's youngest - and very small - son who helps Michael navigate through all of the college offers that come his way. There are also some combo touchy-feely and comical moments. The one that comes to mind is when the Tuohy's ask Michael to become a member of their family and he says, ""I thought I already was.""The main draw here is, finally, Sandra Bullock. Not known as a powerhouse actress and more as one who goes after the money, Bullock may have gotten lucky and found the part she could play so well that it grabbed her an Oscar. Her Leigh portrayal was truly excellent. But was it as good as, say, Gabourey Sidibe'sPrecious? Or Meryl Streep's Julia Child inJulie & Julia? Some think not (Does Meryl need another Oscar?  I mean, really!)Regardless, I think sports movie fans will gobble up this one just as much as HOOSIERS and ROCKY.",4,Sandra Bullock Finally Pulls In A Stellar Performance,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2720,"['Making', 'schmaltzy', 'movies', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'overly', 'good', 'Music', 'telling', 'when', 'get', 'lump', 'throat', 'Actors', 'talk', 'softly', 'glistening', 'eye', 'love-fest', 'ensues.If', 'abhor', 'types', 'films', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'THE', 'BLINDSIDE', 'Not', 'here', 'only', 'mildly', 'despise', 'great', 'white', 'person', 'saving', '[', 'insert', 'minority', 'here', 'other', 'person', 'certain', 'doom', 'theme', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'flick', 'too', 'Yes', 'here', 'too', 'So', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'rate', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'Well', 'not', 'overly', 'schmaltzy', 'overly', 'great-white-hope-ish', 'relatively', 'true', 'telling', 'NFL', 'star', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'early', 'troubled', 'life', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee.Homeless', '16', 'parental', 'guidance', 'Big', 'Mike', 'seen', 'wandering', 'streets', 'affluent', 'Leigh', 'Tuohy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Lake', 'House', 'family', 'do', 'good', 'Christian', 'thing', 'offer', 'big', 'guy', 'place', 'sleep', 'night', 'strong', 'silent', 'Michael', 'attempts', 'leave', 'next', 'day', 'Leigh', 'have', 'stay', 'night', 'so', 'induction', 'Tuohy', 'family.But', 'NFL', 'Michael', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'must', 'first', 'pass', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'get', 'college', 'must', 'overcome', 'whitewashed', 'system', 'academia', 'upscale', 'Memphis', 'do', 'too', 'soon', 'help', 'arrival', 'tutor', 'Miss', 'Sue', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'who', 'up', 'Michael', 'mental', 'muscle', 'college', 'days.Most', 'just', 'backstory', 'however', 'main', 'event', 'Michael', 'immediate', 'rise', 'football', 'circuit', 'size', 'speed', 'shock', 'who', 'watch', 'games', 'making', 'prime', 'candidate', 'college', 'scouts.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'funny', 'moments', 'though', 'most', 'are', 'thanks', 'S.J', 'Jae', 'Head', 'Hancock', 'Tuohy', 'youngest', 'very', 'small', 'son', 'who', 'Michael', 'navigate', 'college', 'come', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'combo', 'touchy-feely', 'comical', 'moments', 'one', 'mind', 'when', 'Tuohy', 'ask', 'Michael', 'become', 'member', 'family', 'thought', 'already', 'was', 'main', 'draw', 'here', 'finally', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Not', 'known', 'powerhouse', 'actress', 'more', 'one', 'who', 'money', 'Bullock', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'lucky', 'found', 'part', 'could', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'grabbed', 'Oscar', 'Leigh', 'portrayal', 'was', 'truly', 'excellent', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'say', 'Gabourey', ""Sidibe'sPrecious"", 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Julia', 'Child', 'inJulie', 'Julia', 'think', 'not', 'Does', 'Meryl', 'need', 'Oscar', 'mean', 'really', 'Regardless', 'think', 'sports', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'gobble', 'up', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'HOOSIERS', 'ROCKY']",N/A

1292354,A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI,B002VECM6S,Book Glutton,"[1, 1]","I am sure it is just coincidence, but this week's Gospel in Church is about how an enemy has sown weeds into the field of the Master's wheat (see Mt 13:24-43). I think one of the messages of the reading(s) is ""patience"" with the world, with others, and with ourselves. Frequently, we are little aware of the weeds that have taken root in our lives, although we are quick to see them in others. All the while the weeds can have a dominating affect on the good we also possess.I was reminded how this movie is a good example of this message & more. Michael Ober had more than a few negatives overshadowing his life. The Touhy family, especially in the form of Sandra Bullock, was able to see the good, in spite of all else, and enable Michael not only to look past it, but to excel. Most already know the ending before watching the movie: success in the form of college, scholarship, All-American and NFL. Not bad for someone who was abandoned only years prior.In this true story, credit must be given to John Lee Hancock for his great directing. I suppose the final product would not be what it is without great editing also (mentioned in other reviews). I found Sandra Bullock an essential ingredient in the movie. She was terrific!

Sorry, you cynical lot, that just can't happen here because this is a true story, and from what I've read of the actual people involved, told rather forthrightly for a Hollywood biopic.Here a wealthy family in Memphis, through an unlikely series of circumstance and happenstance, meet and befriend a very large teenager from the mean side of town. His family history a chaotic mess, his life a series of guest appearances in other people's homes, Michael Oher finds the first stability and real love he's ever experienced with the family who took him in. The story of their acceptance and his, and his success in his new environment, is nothing short of motivational.The acting is superb. Both Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw (yes, Tim McGraw ... the scene where he talks about The Charge of the Light Brigade is inspired) give strong performances as the well to do couple. The script plays on the feisty element of Mrs. Touhy's character for both dramatic effect and laughs, and pulls both sides off very successfully. If the real lady is half of what the film portrayed, she's still a force of nature. :-) My guess is that she is more than what the film portrayed, as the film can only show the highlights of what was certainly a tough road to travel for quite a while.After getting to know the family thru the performances of the cast, the real family photos shown in the closing credits are quite a treat, and all alone give you a sense of the accuracy of the movie you just witnessed.

Evidently America prefers her in her with-it-lady-yelling-at-someone mode.The performance by the lead, Quinton Aaron, was also a major disappointment.  At first he gives this off-center, muted performance, as if he's barely containing some volcanic rage.  And you start thinking, ""This is gonna be great!  This guy's gonna explode!""  But instead that never happens.  What instead happens is that you get this off-putting, unfocused performance all the way up till the end of the movie.

Now, there couldn't be two movies on a different plateau than AVATAR and BLIND SIDE, but I'm so glad that she brought me to see this movie. AVATAR, I gave 4 stars, BLIND SIDE, 5 stars. BLIND SIDE, for what it was, was flawless.With BLIND SIDE, the story tells itself, because it's the true story of 2009 Baltimore Ravens Right Tackle Michael Oher, or possibly Michael Williams, or maybe something else, and his improbable escape from oblivion with the love and care of a rich white family in Memphis, Tennessee. Michael Oher's greatness, first showed up in his size and athletic potential and then in his courage to forget and go forward. Michael Oher, a kid who struggled at basic study skills and education, but scored a 98% in protective instincts. A tribute to his lifestyle and his ability to survive, homeless, with two shirts, a pain on his face that couldn't be explained.Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, and I haven't seen a whole lot of nominated movies this year, but if she isn't at least a runner up to the best actress of the year, I'll be stunned. This was Sandra Bullock's shining moment. She is strong and she is funny and she is exceedingly brilliant at hiding the tears she sheds throughout the movie as her personna won't allow her to be seen crying. No scene was more poigniant than the one where she makes a bedroom for Michael in her beautiful home with a chipperness that you would expect from a spunky Tennessee mother. Michael says, ""I've never had one of these before."" and she says, ""What, a room?"" ""No, a bed."" he says. She looks at him, stoned faced, gives a quick nod and exits the room, enters the bathroom, locks the door and although we don't see it, we know exactly what she's doing.THE BLIND SIDE is a testimant to what life is all about. The Tuohy families link to Michael Oher may have been a rare occurence, and that's why there's a movie about it, but if we all looked out for each other a little more, despite color boundaries, despite class boundaries and just showed a little love and extended a helping hand when we could, the world would be a better place.The Tuohy's didn't just extend a hand, they extended their hearts and lives.",5,Sandra Bullock finally shows us how good she can be,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,2275,"['wife', 'just', 'went', 'double-feature', 'picked', 'AVATAR', 'picked', 'THE', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'Now', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'two', 'movies', 'different', 'plateau', 'AVATAR', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'brought', 'see', 'movie', 'AVATAR', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', '5', 'stars', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'flawless.With', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'story', 'true', 'story', '2009', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'Right', 'Tackle', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'possibly', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'maybe', 'something', 'else', 'improbable', 'escape', 'oblivion', 'love', 'care', 'rich', 'white', 'family', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'greatness', 'first', 'showed', 'up', 'size', 'athletic', 'potential', 'then', 'courage', 'forget', 'go', 'forward', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'kid', 'who', 'struggled', 'basic', 'study', 'skills', 'education', 'scored', '98', '%', 'protective', 'instincts', 'tribute', 'lifestyle', 'ability', 'survive', 'homeless', 'two', 'shirts', 'pain', 'face', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'plays', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'whole', 'lot', 'nominated', 'movies', 'year', ""n't"", 'least', 'runner', 'up', 'best', 'actress', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stunned', 'was', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'shining', 'moment', 'strong', 'funny', 'exceedingly', 'brilliant', 'hiding', 'tears', 'movie', 'personna', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'seen', 'crying', 'scene', 'was', 'more', 'poigniant', 'one', 'where', 'bedroom', 'Michael', 'beautiful', 'home', 'chipperness', 'would', 'expect', 'spunky', 'Tennessee', 'mother', 'Michael', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'one', 'What', 'room', 'No', 'bed', 'stoned', 'faced', 'quick', 'nod', 'room', 'bathroom', 'door', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing.THE', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'testimant', 'what', 'life', 'Tuohy', 'families', 'link', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'rare', 'occurence', 'why', 'movie', 'looked', 'out', 'other', 'little', 'more', 'color', 'boundaries', 'class', 'boundaries', 'just', 'showed', 'little', 'love', 'extended', 'helping', 'hand', 'when', 'could', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place.The', 'Tuohy', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'extend', 'hand', 'extended', 'hearts', 'lives']",N/A

Dorsey, Kim Dickens, Tom Nowicki and Kathy BatesWRITTEN BY: John Lee Hancock; based on the book by Michael LewisDIRECTED BY: John Lee HancockRated: PG - 13Genre: DramaRelease Date: 20 November 2009At last Sandra Bullock has finally gotten the praise she has been so deserving of since the early 90s. Thanks to her wonderful performance in The Blind Side, she has received her first Oscar nomination.She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy in this heartfelt true story. Leigh Anne and her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) live in a big house, have a lot of money, and a terrific family. Then, things get even better for them when a troubled young man named Michael comes into their lives.Michael is played by Quinton Aaron. This kid has a look to him unlike anything you have ever seen on the face of anyone in Hollywood; he has the kindest eyes you could imagine and just looking at him you want to be his friend because he seems like the nicest person you will ever meet. It is no wonder Quinton Aaron was cast for the role of Michael, because his character is the exact same way.The Tuohys first meet Michael when he is walking home in the rain from a high school volleyball game that their daughter was playing in. He's a very huge guy you see, and you just can't miss him. He is completely drenched to the bone when they pull over to see if he needs a ride.When Leigh Ann asks him if he has a place to stay for the night and he says no, Sandra Bullock sealed her Oscar nomination with one of the best delivered lines of the year: ""Don't you dare lie to me.""He in fact was lying as he does not have a place to stay. Nor does he have a change of clothes or a family of his own or even so much as a loyal friend to talk to. Michael has nothing.Leigh Ann is destined to change all of that. She invites him to stay the night on the couch and soon enough he is living with them. Eventually she gives him his own bedroom and learns that he's never had a bed to call his own before. It's hard for her to hear this, but he has one now so she accepts that, as Michael has had to.The film is called The Blind Side for two reasons. One is because Michael is black and the Tuohys are white and everyone in town except for them seems to notice this. The second is because as well as being an emotional drama, it's also a very good football movie; referring to the blind side of the quarterback.Leigh Ann narrates parts of the film and beefs us up on our knowledge of the world of sports. She tells us the story of how Michael came to love the game of football and how it changed all of their lives.Michael tries out for the team and isn't exactly the best and doesn't necessarily love football at first. With a little help from Leigh Ann, he learns that he can use his incredible size to protect the quarterback. Leigh Ann explains to him that the team is his family, and asks him if he would protect her and her family. Michael takes this very seriously and makes her and us believe that he would do absolutely anything for her and the family.That's pretty much all it took to turn Michael into an unstoppable machine on the field. Before long, colleges are beating down their door with offers. Leigh Ann has even gone so far as to hire a private tutor to help Michal with his grades. There are some very good scenes here, with the always enjoyable Kathy Bates, playing the tutor.Surprisingly, the film is also very laugh-out-loud funny through its entirety. This is particularly thanks to the fine acting of Jae Head, who plays Leigh Ann and Sean's goofball son, S.J.One of the things that could hurt the film for others, I actually found to be one of its greatest assets: It doesn't feel like a film. There are no real over the top dramatic performances and character arcs and plot twists in the film. You can really tell that the filmmakers were trying to be as true to the story that actually took place, as possible.Sandra Bullock is astonishing. You will notice the accent that she perfected flawlessly and that as she has done in so many other films; she adds a unique physical posture to her character. She walks and physically moves like someone else and you can really notice it. She also looks a great deal like the real Leigh Ann, as can be seen in photographs at the end of the film.This movie doesn't pull any fast ones on us and it never pretends or wants to be anything that it's not. It simply tells its marvelous story: Michael was a great kid that nobody gave a chance to and everyone gave up on; until he met Leigh Ann Tuohy.This film truly moves you because it shows you that no matter the size of a person, they have feelings; and the slightest gesture of kindness can change someone's life forever.",5,The Blind Side Review,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,4820,"['BLIND', 'SIDESTARRING', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'Jae', 'Head', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'Sharon', 'Morris', 'Omar', 'J.', 'Dorsey', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'Tom', 'Nowicki', 'Kathy', 'BatesWRITTEN', 'BY', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'based', 'book', 'Michael', 'LewisDIRECTED', 'BY', 'John', 'Lee', 'HancockRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '20', 'November', '2009At', 'last', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'finally', 'gotten', 'praise', 'been', 'so', 'deserving', 'early', '90s', 'Thanks', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Blind', 'Side', 'received', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination.She', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'heartfelt', 'true', 'story', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'live', 'big', 'house', 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'terrific', 'family', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Michael', 'lives.Michael', 'played', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'kid', 'look', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'face', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'kindest', 'eyes', 'could', 'imagine', 'just', 'looking', 'want', 'be', 'friend', 'nicest', 'person', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'wonder', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'Michael', 'character', 'exact', 'same', 'way.The', 'Tuohys', 'first', 'meet', 'Michael', 'when', 'walking', 'home', 'rain', 'high', 'school', 'volleyball', 'game', 'daughter', 'was', 'playing', 'very', 'huge', 'guy', 'see', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'completely', 'drenched', 'bone', 'when', 'pull', 'see', 'ride.When', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'place', 'stay', 'night', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'sealed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'one', 'best', 'delivered', 'lines', 'year', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'lie', 'fact', 'was', 'lying', 'not', 'have', 'place', 'stay', 'have', 'change', 'clothes', 'family', 'own', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'loyal', 'friend', 'talk', 'Michael', 'nothing.Leigh', 'Ann', 'destined', 'change', 'stay', 'night', 'couch', 'soon', 'enough', 'living', 'Eventually', 'own', 'bedroom', 'never', 'had', 'bed', 'call', 'own', 'before', 'hard', 'hear', 'one', 'now', 'that', 'Michael', 'had', 'to.The', 'film', 'called', 'Blind', 'Side', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'Michael', 'black', 'Tuohys', 'are', 'white', 'everyone', 'town', 'notice', 'second', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'emotional', 'drama', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'football', 'movie', 'referring', 'blind', 'side', 'quarterback.Leigh', 'Ann', 'parts', 'film', 'beefs', 'up', 'knowledge', 'world', 'sports', 'story', 'how', 'Michael', 'came', 'love', 'game', 'football', 'how', 'changed', 'lives.Michael', 'out', 'team', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'love', 'football', 'first', 'little', 'help', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'can', 'use', 'incredible', 'size', 'protect', 'quarterback', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'team', 'family', 'would', 'protect', 'family', 'Michael', 'very', 'seriously', 'believe', 'would', 'do', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'family.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'took', 'turn', 'Michael', 'unstoppable', 'machine', 'field', 'long', 'colleges', 'are', 'beating', 'down', 'door', 'offers', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'even', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'hire', 'private', 'tutor', 'help', 'Michal', 'grades', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'here', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'playing', 'tutor.Surprisingly', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'entirety', 'particularly', 'thanks', 'fine', 'acting', 'Jae', 'Head', 'who', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'Sean', 'goofball', 'son', 'S.J.One', 'things', 'could', 'hurt', 'film', 'others', 'actually', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'assets', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'top', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'character', 'arcs', 'plot', 'twists', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'possible.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'astonishing', 'will', 'notice', 'accent', 'perfected', 'flawlessly', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'unique', 'physical', 'posture', 'character', 'walks', 'physically', 'moves', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'really', 'notice', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'real', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'photographs', 'end', 'film.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pull', 'fast', 'ones', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'not', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'story', 'Michael', 'was', 'great', 'kid', 'nobody', 'gave', 'chance', 'everyone', 'gave', 'up', 'met', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'Tuohy.This', 'film', 'truly', 'matter', 'size', 'person', 'have', 'feelings', 'slightest', 'gesture', 'kindness', 'can', 'change', 'someone', 'life', 'forever']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[5, 7]","In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock.  In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular filmmaking and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's `blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success.  This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school.  Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports.  Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock).  She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family.  Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.Encouraged by his `family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field.  He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates.  Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results.  Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant.  To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role).  When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael.  And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing.  When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout.  It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends.  The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz.  What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins.  Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast.  The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean.  But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will.  It's the kind of performance that gets awards.  Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick.  (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.)  Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her own fail cannot help but touch and inspire.",4,THE BLIND SIDE Shines Brightly,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,4005,"['tradition', 'feel', 'good', 'sports', 'movies', 'Rookie', 'Hoosiers', 'Blind', 'Side', 'what', 'apart', 'genre', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'Bullock', 'character', 'story', 'one', 'perfect', 'example', 'popular', 'filmmaking', 'themes', 'love', 'hope', 'redemption.Opening', 'infamous', 'injury', 'NFL', 'quarterback', 'Joe', 'Theisman', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'film', 'centers', 'importance', 'protecting', 'quarterback', 'side', 'hence', 'position', 'left', 'tackle', 'become', 'vital', 'football', 'team', 'success', 'true', 'story', 'beginnings', 'tackle', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'drafted', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens.Coming', 'broken', 'family', 'Oher', 'predominantly', 'white', 'high', 'school', 'Quiet', 'introverted', 'poorly', 'classes', 'performs', 'marginally', 'athletic', 'sports', 'Befriended', 'younger', 'boy', 'S.', 'J.', 'Tuohy', 'Michael', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'circumstance', 'wealthy', 'Tuohy', 'family', 'led', 'strong-willed', 'mom', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Bullock', 'homeless', 'boy', 'place', 'sleep', 'night', 'out', 'be', 'mansion', 'home', 'time', 'trust', 'bond', 'develops', 'adopted', 'surrogate', 'family', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'young', 'man', 'project', 'speak', 'love', 'own', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'biological', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'survive', 'own', 'friends', ""'hood"", 'who', 'border', 'criminals.Encouraged', 'family', 'school', 'faculty', 'Michael', 'grades', 'play', 'football', 'field', 'up', 'befriended', 'more', 'schoolmates', 'sense', 'family', 'so', 'important', 'protective', 'instincts', 'new', 'level', 'football', 'spectacular', 'results', 'long', 'marquee', 'college', 'coaches', 'descend', 'Memphis', 'attempt', 'recruit', 'gentle', 'giant', 'help', 'get', 'grades', 'get', 'up', 'par', 'family', 'tutor', 'Miss', 'Sue', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'too', 'brief', 'role', 'When', 'official', 'NCAA', 'interviews', 'Michael', 'conflict', 'interest', 'Tuohys', 'are', 'avid', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'Alumni', 'University', 'Mississippi', 'Michael', 'crossroads', 'career', 'relationship', 'Tuohy', 'are', 'moments', 'savor', 'such', 'Thanksgiving', 'Tuohy', 'household', 'how', 'family', 'Michael', 'course', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'coaches', 'Michael', 'protect', 'quarterback', 'were', 'family', 'amusing', 'When', 'neighborhood', 'heavy', 'dose', 'living', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'scene', 'where', 'local', 'gang', 'confronts', 'more', 'expected', 'standout', 'stark', 'contrast', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'judgmental', 'friends', 'college', 'recruitment', 'scenes', 'are', 'amusing', 'lend', 'air', 'authenticity', 'showing', 'real', 'life', 'coaching', 'legends', 'Nick', 'Saban', 'Lou', 'Holtz', 'What', 'refreshing', 'how', 'Michael', 'befriended', 'S.', 'J.', 'later', 'sister', 'Collins', 'Having', 'children', 'making', 'positive', 'life', 'affirming', 'choices', 'welfare', 'others', 'rare', 'depiction', 'film.Director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Rookie', 'credit', 'weaving', 'good', 'script', 'based', 'Michael', 'Lewis', 'book', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'strong', 'cast', 'Tuohy', 'kids', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'Jae', 'Head', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'quite', 'good', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'supportive', 'husband', 'Sean', 'most', 'definitely', 'Bullock', 'show', 'energy', 'infectious', 'film', 'sheer', 'will', 'kind', 'performance', 'awards', 'Think', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Erin', 'Brockovich.This', 'film', 'real', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'easily', 'watchable', 'most', 'family', 'members', 'not', 'easy', 'trick', 'Do', 'stay', 'end', 'see', 'snapshots', 'real', 'life', 'Tuohy', 'family', 'Yes', 'narrative', 'very', 'straightforward', 'facts', 'places', 'spirit', 'family', 'matriarch', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'one', 'own', 'fail', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'touch', 'inspire']",N/A

1292411,A2W7WUVO0JA6LL,B002VECM6S,"DaBrandoChipper ""MathNerd""","[32, 74]","I remember looking forward to this movie and being utterly disappointed on the way out and the reasons are many.  The story had potential, but the director chose to turn this into a made for Lifetime Channel Tv movie. All directors manipulate the audience to an extent, but the Blind Side does not allow the audience to think at all.  We clearly know who is a big bad meanie and we clearly know who the saints with halos are.  And there are no in betweens.  And can anyone honestly say there was anything in this ""film"" that could not be anticipated from the trailer?  I would venture that anyone, after seeing the 60 second preview could probably describe the entire film.  There was nothing in the screenplay that could not be predicted.  How can such a predictable film be remotely considered for top picture?The portrayal of the sport of football itself was half baked(I was really looking forward to some insight into the sport of football in this movie, but my little sister seems to know more about the sport than the director does).  The coach of the OTHER team was a devil and all his players were little demons.  Michael's team were the good guy underdogs that you MUST root for unless you are a communist.  And Michael shoving his meanie nemesis all the way down the field and over the fence?  Why was this scene necessary?  If someone were to actually do that (and they never did or will), they would be ejected and suspended.  And even if it were to happen, a total brawl would ensue on the field.  Was the director trying to get a laugh?  That would be the way I would expect to see football portrayed on an episode of I-Carly, not in an Oscar nominated film.And at the end of the film, do we really understand who Michael Oher is?  All we get is a caricatured sketch of him.  The film was all about Leigh Ann, and not Michael.  Some have argued the focus of the film is about Leigh Ann's good deed, and that is all good and fine, but I would like a bit more depth to Michael's character.  That was who I came to the movie to see.  And I am not totally willing to coronate Leigh Ann and her husband as total saints yet either; I believe that there was more to the NCAA investigation than we were led to believe.  But once again, the director was unwilling to let the audience think here.  The audience was clearly TOLD the NCAA was the big meanie.  All black and white and no grey is the EASY way out.Finally, I do not believe Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her performance in this film (or any other film she has been in for that matter).  Her performance was pretty much exactly what you would expect; very little subtlety or nuance.  She was pretty much happy, mad, and sad everywhere the script told her.  Not a bad performance, but if one saw all the other female leads that were nominated, Bullock's performance was easily at the bottom of the bunch.  Heck, even a few that WEREN'T nominated were better.  Amy Adams, for instance, turned in a FAR superior performance in Julie and Julia.  I guess if Taylor Swift can get a Grammy for album of the year, we really can't be surprised if the Academy hands out an undeserving award or two.",2,An Oscar Nod For This?,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3161,"['remember', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'being', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'way', 'reasons', 'are', 'many', 'story', 'had', 'potential', 'director', 'chose', 'turn', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'Tv', 'movie', 'directors', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'extent', 'Blind', 'Side', 'not', 'allow', 'audience', 'think', 'clearly', 'know', 'who', 'big', 'bad', 'meanie', 'clearly', 'know', 'who', 'saints', 'halos', 'are', 'are', 'betweens', 'can', 'anyone', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'anything', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'anticipated', 'trailer', 'would', 'venture', 'anyone', 'seeing', '60', 'second', 'preview', 'could', 'probably', 'describe', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'screenplay', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'predicted', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'predictable', 'film', 'be', 'remotely', 'considered', 'top', 'picture', 'portrayal', 'sport', 'football', 'was', 'half', 'baked', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'insight', 'sport', 'football', 'movie', 'little', 'sister', 'know', 'more', 'sport', 'director', 'coach', 'OTHER', 'team', 'was', 'devil', 'players', 'were', 'little', 'demons', 'Michael', 'team', 'were', 'good', 'guy', 'underdogs', 'MUST', 'root', 'are', 'communist', 'Michael', 'shoving', 'meanie', 'nemesis', 'way', 'field', 'fence', 'Why', 'was', 'scene', 'necessary', 'someone', 'were', 'actually', 'do', 'never', 'did', 'will', 'would', 'be', 'ejected', 'suspended', 'even', 'were', 'happen', 'total', 'brawl', 'would', 'ensue', 'field', 'Was', 'director', 'trying', 'get', 'laugh', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'football', 'portrayed', 'episode', 'I-Carly', 'not', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'film.And', 'end', 'film', 'do', 'really', 'understand', 'who', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'get', 'caricatured', 'sketch', 'film', 'was', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'not', 'Michael', 'have', 'argued', 'focus', 'film', 'about', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'good', 'deed', 'good', 'fine', 'would', 'like', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'Michael', 'character', 'was', 'who', 'came', 'movie', 'see', 'am', 'not', 'totally', 'willing', 'coronate', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'husband', 'total', 'saints', 'yet', 'believe', 'was', 'more', 'NCAA', 'investigation', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'once', 'again', 'director', 'was', 'unwilling', 'let', 'audience', 'think', 'here', 'audience', 'was', 'clearly', 'TOLD', 'NCAA', 'was', 'big', 'meanie', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'EASY', 'way', 'out.Finally', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'been', 'matter', 'performance', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'very', 'little', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'happy', 'mad', 'sad', 'everywhere', 'script', 'told', 'Not', 'bad', 'performance', 'one', 'saw', 'other', 'female', 'leads', 'were', 'nominated', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'was', 'easily', 'bottom', 'bunch', 'Heck', 'even', 'few', 'WERE', ""N'T"", 'nominated', 'were', 'better', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'instance', 'turned', 'FAR', 'superior', 'performance', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'guess', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'can', 'get', 'Grammy', 'album', 'year', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Academy', 'out', 'undeserving', 'award', 'two']",N/A

Price ""author of Billy's Victory""","[3, 4]","The recently released sports movie, Blind Side, is an eye opener and takes a look at how one person, and in this case one family, can make the difference in the life of an individual down on his luck. It is a feel good movie and you'll leave the theater thinking better of your fellow man. Now, everytime I tune into an NFL game involving the Baltimore Ravens,I won't be looking downfield to see the result of the play, instead I'll be back at the line, focusing in on No. 74, Michael Oher, to see if the 6-4, 309 pound tackle did his job. For you sports fans out there, it has been well publicized how Oher, a homeless teenager was taken in by a well-to-do family, learned to play football at a Christian school,went on to star at Ole Miss and was drafted by the Ravens earlier this year and has now started in all 13 NFL games.I doubt Blind Side will garner any Oscars, unless Sandra Bullock can somehow beat out Meryl Streep for the best actress hardware. Bullock is outstanding in the role as the patriarch of the white, well-to-do Tuohy family who ropes in the homeless, African-American teenager and changes his life forever. As a side note,I'm becoming a Tim McGraw fan. Not because he's a heck of country singer, or for the fact he's the husband of Faith Hill, but because he's not too bad on the silver screen. Despite the fact, McGraw, who plays Leigh Ann Tuohy's husband in Blind Side, takes second-billing to Bullock's performance,I noticed his soft-spoken, behind the scenes portrayal of the family's bread winner.A few years back, McGraw played just the opposite as Charles Billingsley, an alcoholic father in the 2004 sports movie Friday Night Lights.Two different roles, but two very good performances.

I can recommend this movie for anyone seeking encouragement about life today; there are a lot of basically good people living their lives and making positive contributions to the lives of others. From that perspective alone the movie pays dividends to the purchaser.On top of all that it is a fun movie to watch; Sandra Bullock does a convincing job of being a no-nonsense mom that takes action when required. This is, I understand, an accurate reflection of Leigh Anne Tuohy in real life. This brings up my biggest complaint with the DVD; it is sorely lacking in extras such as background footage on the real Tuohy family. Many specials appeared on the media, but nothing appears in the DVD about the family who was the basis for the film.

They see to it that he gets a good private education, so he can earn a football scholarship.  Oher eventually becomes an All-American at Ole Miss and then the first-round draft choice for the Baltimore Ravens.The story is well-told and inspiring.  Sandra Bullock is particularly good as the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy.  Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as the Critic's Choice, Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild and People's Choice awards.  Ironically, Bullock had turned down the role three times because of her concerns about playing a devout Christian.  After accepting the role, she almost quit a couple of weeks into filming, because she thought her acting was doing an injustice to Tuohy.  Apparently not!The blu-ray transfer is great.  Visuals and audio are both strong.  The disc contains interviews with Michael Oher, Aaron Quinton (who played Oher), Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sandra Bullock.  Parental Advisory: While the movie does feature one scene of violence and a couple of allusions to sex and drugs, it is suitable for family viewing.  The Tuohys are commendable for their care of Michael.  The power of their example outweighs a couple of minor negative elements that might necessitate a word of explanation for very small children.One goof in the film.  Above the gate at the Christian school, is an inscription that says, ""With man this is possible, but with God all things are possible.""  This is a misquotation from Matthew 19:26, which says, ""With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.""  Apart from this, the movie makers handled the Christian aspects of the film quite well.I highly recommend The Blind Side.

1292430,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B002VECM6S,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 4]","I'm not a fan of sappy, feel-good movies, but everyone kept telling me that I had to see The Blind Side.  So I did, and I was prepared to hate it.  To my surprise, director John Lee Hancock manages, for the most part, to skirt sentimentality for a (relatively) no-nonsense story of a homeless African-American teenager who is adopted by a fireball of a Southern woman and her family.  Yes, there are the obligatory teary moments, but fortunately, most of the film marches on as Leigh Anne Tuohy herself does, with purpose and determination and not much time to linger over emotions.First, the plot:  this is the story of NFL left tackle Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) as told through the point-of-view of his adoptive mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Southern belle with grits.  Young Oher, the abandoned child of a crack addict from the projects, ends up at the private Wingate Christian School through the fluke of happening to temporarily live with the school's janitor who wants his own son admitted.  Oher, who has neither the educational background nor the support to attend, is admitted purely because of his size and the guilt-inducing speech by the coach to the admissions committee.  By another strike of fate, he ends up in the home of the Tuohys with tough-as-nails Leigh Anne finding a soft spot for the reticent, hulking teenager.  The story is not as much about Oher and football as one might think; instead, it is more about Leigh Anne and her love for Michael, which just happens to play an important part in the life of Michael Oher, the football player. The refusal to linger on most revealing moments is both a strength and a weakness, however, since the viewer ends up with only a superficial idea of the dynamics of the situation and little solid idea of the real Oher, other than the gentle giant type.  It rankles a little that this story is more about how a white family made a African-American football player than how a football player made himself, but the story is what it is.  One told from Oher's point-of-view would have been entirely different, and perhaps even more sentimental given the circumstances of his background.Sandra Bullock is excellent as Leigh Anne; she plays her character as with both toughness and class. Aaron is good, though not great, as Oher; he is best when all his emotions are reflected in his eyes and the corners of his mouth.  He does play Oher a little too dumb at times; in the NCAA scenes at the end, he transforms from confused idiot to articulate young man overnight.  Tim McGraw plays a likable, albeit passive, Sean Tuohy.  Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy is the only cast member who demonstrates conflicted emotions.  Jae Head as S.J. Tuohy borders on the obnoxious, although his scene whipping Michael into football shape is fun to watch, even though it does smack of Disney-esque montages.Although The Blind Side offers no challenges, it is an enjoyable, polished film.  The clips seen in trailers come across as much more muted in the context of the scenes themselves.  Parts of the film are surprisingly realistic -- not in the true-life-story way (I can't comment on that, not having read Oher's book) but in the believability of how the scenes unfold.  I recommend The Blind Side for viewers who like mainstream and feel-good films as well as for those who want to be entertained for a couple of hours.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,Not as sappy as the trailers make it sound,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,3391,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'sappy', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'everyone', 'kept', 'telling', 'had', 'see', 'Blind', 'Side', 'did', 'was', 'prepared', 'hate', 'surprise', 'director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'manages', 'most', 'part', 'skirt', 'sentimentality', 'relatively', 'no-nonsense', 'story', 'homeless', 'African-American', 'teenager', 'who', 'adopted', 'fireball', 'Southern', 'woman', 'family', 'Yes', 'are', 'obligatory', 'teary', 'moments', 'fortunately', 'most', 'film', 'marches', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'purpose', 'determination', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'linger', 'emotions.First', 'plot', 'story', 'NFL', 'left', 'tackle', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'told', 'point-of-view', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'Southern', 'belle', 'grits', 'Young', 'Oher', 'abandoned', 'child', 'crack', 'addict', 'projects', 'up', 'private', 'Wingate', 'Christian', 'School', 'fluke', 'happening', 'temporarily', 'live', 'school', 'janitor', 'who', 'own', 'son', 'admitted', 'Oher', 'who', 'educational', 'background', 'support', 'attend', 'admitted', 'purely', 'size', 'guilt-inducing', 'speech', 'coach', 'admissions', 'committee', 'strike', 'fate', 'up', 'home', 'Tuohys', 'tough-as-nails', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'finding', 'soft', 'spot', 'reticent', 'hulking', 'teenager', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Oher', 'football', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'instead', 'more', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'love', 'Michael', 'just', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'football', 'player', 'refusal', 'linger', 'most', 'revealing', 'moments', 'strength', 'weakness', 'however', 'viewer', 'up', 'only', 'superficial', 'idea', 'dynamics', 'situation', 'little', 'solid', 'idea', 'real', 'Oher', 'other', 'gentle', 'giant', 'type', 'little', 'story', 'more', 'how', 'white', 'family', 'made', 'African-American', 'football', 'player', 'how', 'football', 'player', 'made', 'story', 'what', 'One', 'told', 'Oher', 'point-of-view', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'different', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'sentimental', 'given', 'circumstances', 'background.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'excellent', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'character', 'toughness', 'class', 'Aaron', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Oher', 'best', 'when', 'emotions', 'are', 'reflected', 'eyes', 'corners', 'mouth', 'play', 'little', 'too', 'dumb', 'times', 'NCAA', 'scenes', 'end', 'confused', 'idiot', 'articulate', 'young', 'man', 'overnight', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'likable', 'albeit', 'passive', 'Sean', 'Tuohy', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Tuohy', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'conflicted', 'emotions', 'Jae', 'Head', 'S.J', 'Tuohy', 'borders', 'obnoxious', 'scene', 'whipping', 'Michael', 'football', 'shape', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'smack', 'Disney-esque', 'Blind', 'Side', 'challenges', 'enjoyable', 'polished', 'film', 'clips', 'seen', 'trailers', 'come', 'much', 'more', 'muted', 'context', 'scenes', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'not', 'true-life-story', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'Oher', 'book', 'believability', 'how', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'recommend', 'Blind', 'Side', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'mainstream', 'feel-good', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'couple', 'hours.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A

Truth, ladies and gentlemen, is stranger than fiction.  If a fiction writer had penned a story about a well-to-do white family taking a gentle giant, homeless, African-American teenager under its wing to nurture and love until the young man develops into an All-American and NFL first round draft pick said story would rapidly go back into the slush pile.  Thank goodness, then, that THE BLIND SIDE, the highly inspirational and wonderful story about Michael Oher and the Tuohy family, is absolutely true; at the end of this movie (and after viewing actual photos of Oher and the Tuohys that predominate the closing credits) I was literally standing and cheering.I'm not that big on romcoms or chick flicks, which means Sandra Bullock doesn't do a whole lot for me.  But here, playing determined, always controlling Leigh Anne Tuohy, Bullock is remarkable.  Even I want to go pick up my room after she scolds one of her charges.  And Tim McGraw is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors.  Playing Sean Tuohy this country crooner makes acting look so easy.  Finally, kudos to a hulking Quinton Aaron as the silent, long suffering Oher.  Big Mike, as he's called, has never experienced love; when the Tuohys offer it to him in abundance he doesn't know how to react, so he's tentative and hesitant.  Aaron brings home the very human component of Michael Oher's fantastic journey from misery to belonging.

Sandra Bullock, always a great actor who can adapt to a wide variety of rolls, does an outstanding job of portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy, the socially upper-class Memphis society woman who has compassion on Michael Oher, the overgrown kid from the projects, and who not only adopts treats him as a member of her own family but gives him the strength and courage to believe in himself. Quinton Aaron, in his debut as a lead actor, plays the part of Oher in a way that is truly believable.But the acting is just part of what makes this a great film. The true story of a woman who is willing to step way out of her comfort zone and put her life and reputation on the line for a kid it would be easy to ignore (or fear) is more than just heartwarming. It is a testimony to what can be accomplished if one is willing to put his or her principles into action. It is also a testimony to how far someone who has come to believe in himself because someone else believes in him can go in life. (Although we know the end result before the movie begins--namely, that Michael Oher eventually will be a first-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens--this in no way detracts from the suspense and the excitement of the movie itself.)This is not just a movie for the football fan.

This is one such movie.  In short, it ranks as one of the greatest sports movies ever made - not the least of which due to the fact that it is based on the true story of Michael Oher.One of the more notable aspects of this film is just how little of it takes place on the football field.  This is a movie about Michael Oher the person more than it is Micheal Oher the football player.  In spite of being about 6'8 & > 300lbs, we find Oher to be someone who is as uniquely human as the rest of us.  People who automatically believe that sports movies = zero plot will be quite surprised after giving this one a viewing.Likewise, very little focus is on Oher's HS football team.  It shows them winning from time to time & it shows Michael holding the league championship trophy.  However, the other players on the team only have bit parts and we know very little about them.Rather than being about a team's quest for a championship, this is a movie about a young man's involvement in the college football recruiting process.  It is also centered around his desires to escape his past and make the grade while fending off racism at a ritzy all-white private school.At its core, however, this is a story that shows how a little bit of kindness can go a long way towards making the world a better place.  Even in the sadistic, twisted time in which we live, it's good to know that magnanimity has not entirely gone out of style.Acting wise, this is one of the most well-done films I've ever seen.  There was not a single weak performance in the movie, and there are not too many movies I can say that about.  The casting office came through with flying colors!  Sandra Bullock's Oscar was well deserved, and Quinton Aaron is perfect as the gentle giant with puppy dog eyes.  Cameos by college coaches such as Nick Saban, Lou Holtz & Phil Fulmer were a nice touch.Whether you love Sandra Bullock or merely adore Sandra Bullock, this is a heartwarming movie that will stay with you forever.  If, after watching this movie you're not stirred in the least, I would highly recommend that you check your pulse to ensure that you still have one!",5,A Cinderella story - football style!,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,2236,"['so', 'often', 'movie', 'well-deserving', 'hype', 'allocated', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'short', 'one', 'greatest', 'sports', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'least', 'due', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Michael', 'Oher.One', 'more', 'notable', 'aspects', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'place', 'football', 'field', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'person', 'more', 'Micheal', 'Oher', 'football', 'player', 'spite', 'being', '6', '8', '>', '300lbs', 'find', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'uniquely', 'human', 'rest', 'People', 'who', 'automatically', 'believe', 'sports', 'movies', '=', 'zero', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', 'giving', 'one', 'viewing.Likewise', 'very', 'little', 'focus', 'Oher', 'HS', 'football', 'team', 'winning', 'time', 'time', 'Michael', 'holding', 'league', 'championship', 'trophy', 'However', 'other', 'players', 'team', 'only', 'have', 'bit', 'parts', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'them.Rather', 'being', 'team', 'quest', 'championship', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'involvement', 'college', 'football', 'recruiting', 'process', 'also', 'centered', 'desires', 'escape', 'past', 'make', 'grade', 'fending', 'off', 'racism', 'ritzy', 'all-white', 'private', 'school.At', 'core', 'however', 'story', 'how', 'little', 'bit', 'kindness', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'Even', 'sadistic', 'twisted', 'time', 'live', 'good', 'know', 'magnanimity', 'not', 'entirely', 'gone', 'style.Acting', 'wise', 'one', 'most', 'well-done', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'not', 'single', 'weak', 'performance', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'casting', 'office', 'came', 'flying', 'colors', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Oscar', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'perfect', 'gentle', 'giant', 'puppy', 'dog', 'eyes', 'Cameos', 'college', 'coaches', 'such', 'Nick', 'Saban', 'Lou', 'Holtz', 'Phil', 'Fulmer', 'were', 'nice', 'touch.Whether', 'love', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'merely', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'forever', 'watching', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'stirred', 'least', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'check', 'pulse', 'ensure', 'still', 'have', 'one']",N/A

Sorel ""book lovah""","[3, 3]","Last week, The Blindside opened in theaters across the country heralding a superstar cast including Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, and Kathy Bates (among others). The movie was advertised as a feel-good movie about a young homeless boy who finds love and family in a white southern family. However, the movie is much more than that! The story is really about a young African-American boy, Michael Oher, who lived in the Memphis projects with his drug-addicted mother. At a young age, he was taken from his mother and placed in various foster families from which he always escaped. By coincidence, he was enrolled in a preppy, white, christian school where he was considered an outcast by both students and parents. At this time, Oher was homeless and found food by collecting alreayd eaten popcorn leftover after athletic games at the school. One day, Leigh Ann Tuney (Sandra Bullock) finds Michael walking down the street in the cold and welcomes him to sleep on her family's couch. Within months, Michael becomes part of the family and is accepted by Leigh Ann's husband, and two children. Of course there are difficulties that arise, but Michael is soon placed on the football team. With the help of a tutor (Kathy Bates), Michael becomes eligible to attend college.The aspect that makes this feel-good movie more than just a stereotypical tearjerker is that it is a true story with as much pain as it has happiness. The first 45 minutes of the movie has the audience clutching their guts in hopes that the sorrow experienced by Michael will hopefully subside. Though his circumstances improve a great deal, the film never lets the audience forget Michael's past and therefore keeps it ever looming in the back of the audience's mind. The characters are real, and they should be, because they are based on real people.Overall, it is the perfect holiday movie! It makes everyone want to jump up from their seats and give back to those less fortunate. I was not a fan of Sandra Bullock before this movie, but I now have to say that she did an excellent job. I often find tearjerker movies to be annoying and shallow, which this movie is neither. The autenticity of the story is further bolstered by the ending of the movie in which actual photographs of Michael Oher and the Tuney family are projected on the screen alongside the credits. There is even footage of Oher being drafted for the Ravens by the NFL in which Oher and the Tuney's are shown together. The sentiments and values that this film embodied touched my heart and I am sure that it did the same to the other viewers in the theater. It may even get me interested in football!

1292468,A3TSLD2UOQRA05,B002VECM6S,"Earl A. Myers, Jr.","[6, 15]","This movie first of all requires a suspension of disbelief. What high school coach puts a kid on the practice field without first going over the basic rudiments of the blocking game required of a lineman. Also, the film gives the impression that all major college coaches wanted Michael Oher solely on the basis of the one block in which he blocked an opposing lineman back into his own end zone and deposited him over a protective barrier. The football sequences were by in large weak and unimpressive.Lastly, I didn't get the whole NCAA interrogation thing. They should have been thankful that a family cared enough to take him in and given some purpose to his life, let alone a university who was willing to take a chance on him with his poor academic achievement records.Sandra Bullock gave a creditable performance, but Academy Award status, I think not; Meryl Streep in a walk for sure. The best acting was displayed by the young man who played Bullock's son. Precocious doesn't begin to describe this young actor's ability. He steals every scene in which he appears.This is certainly a feel good, inspirational story. But, somehow it misses the mark on drama and true reality. It is great for family viewing (Which is truly something hard to come by these days), but it lacks the biting edge (sans profanity) that is needed to push it into the classic or near classic film category.",3,Good But Not Great,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,1389,"['movie', 'first', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'What', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'kid', 'practice', 'field', 'first', 'going', 'basic', 'rudiments', 'blocking', 'game', 'required', 'lineman', 'Also', 'film', 'impression', 'major', 'college', 'coaches', 'wanted', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'solely', 'basis', 'one', 'block', 'blocked', 'opposing', 'lineman', 'back', 'own', 'end', 'zone', 'deposited', 'over', 'protective', 'barrier', 'football', 'sequences', 'were', 'large', 'weak', 'unimpressive.Lastly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'NCAA', 'interrogation', 'thing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'thankful', 'family', 'cared', 'enough', 'take', 'given', 'purpose', 'life', 'let', 'alone', 'university', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'poor', 'academic', 'achievement', 'records.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'gave', 'creditable', 'performance', 'Academy', 'Award', 'status', 'think', 'not', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'walk', 'sure', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'displayed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Bullock', 'son', 'Precocious', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'young', 'actor', 'ability', 'scene', 'certainly', 'feel', 'good', 'inspirational', 'story', 'somehow', 'mark', 'drama', 'true', 'reality', 'great', 'family', 'viewing', 'Which', 'truly', 'something', 'hard', 'come', 'days', 'biting', 'edge', 'sans', 'profanity', 'needed', 'push', 'classic', 'near', 'classic', 'film', 'category']",N/A
1292469,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002VECM6S,Ed Uyeshima,"[16, 18]","This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds storylines, the Texan band of brothers inThe Alamoand the over-the-hill pitcher inThe Rookie. However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-basedbookabout the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bullErin Brockovichterrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as ""Big Mike"", is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller inDoubt- provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect.",4,Bullock Makes Her Mark as a Steel-Willed Memphis Belle in an Emotionally Driven Football Drama,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,3800,"['empathetic', '2009', 'sports-oriented', 'drama', 'what', 'professional', 'critics', 'would', 'call', 'uplift', 'film', 'unabashed', 'pulling', 'necessary', 'emotional', 'cords', 'undemanding', 'audience', 'Screenwriter/director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'stranger', 'genre', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'reflected', 'similar', 'against-all-odds', 'storylines', 'Texan', 'band', 'brothers', 'inThe', 'Alamoand', 'over-the-hill', 'pitcher', 'inThe', 'Rookie', 'However', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'factors', 'transcend', 'potentially', 'manipulative', 'structure', 'Hancock', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'Lewis', 'intriguing', '2006', 'fact-basedbookabout', 'evolution', 'left', 'tackle', 'pro', 'football', 'first', 'irresistible', 'pull', 'true-life', 'story', 'six-foot-six', '345-pound', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'plucked', 'destitution', 'Memphis', 'projects', 'well-to-do', 'white', 'family', 'become', 'starting', 'left', 'tackle', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'now', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'second', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'bleached', 'blonde', 'immensely', 'likable', 'heavily', 'no-bullErin', 'Brockovichterrain', 'solid', 'performance', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'Touhy', 'feisty', 'decorator', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'Oher', 'family', 'home.The', 'film', 'when', 'coach', 'private', 'religious', 'school', 'otherwise', 'lumbering', 'Michael', 'display', 'natural', 'athletic', 'ability', 'basketball', 'court', 'coach', 'untapped', 'potential', 'Michael', 'football', 'player', 'huge', 'size', 'so', 'much', 'accepted', 'poor', 'academic', 'record', 'also', 'out', 'taciturn', 'Michael', 'referred', 'everyone', 'Big', 'Mike', 'homeless', 'sleeping', 'can', 'state', 'took', 'away', 'child', 'crack-addicted', 'mother', 'upscale', 'Touhys', 'have', 'noticed', 'before', 'school', 'children', 'S.J', 'Collins', ""n't"", 'see', 'Michael', 'wandering', 'freezing', 'cold', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'impulsively', 'initial', 'hesitation', 'quickly', 'part', 'family', 'performance', 'school', 'improves', 'enough', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'football', 'field', 'Once', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'team-as-family', 'metaphor', 'Michael', '345-pound', 'behemoth', 'realize', 'talent', 'smashing', 'defensive', 'line', 'College', 'football', 'coaches', 'South', 'come', 'Touhy', 'home', 'recruit', 'Michael', 'aggressively', 'play', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'Touhys', 'alma', 'mater', 'unexpected', 'inevitable', 'dramatic', 'turn.It', 'not', 'Bullock', 'anything', 'new', 'movie', 'Rather', 'winning', 'every-person', 'screen', 'persona', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'character', 'would', 'seem', 'antithetical', 'sensibilities', 'actress', 'true', 'story', 'probably', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'character', 'role', 'Michael', 'ascent', 'Bullock', 'one', 'few', 'film', 'stars', 'today', 'can', 'generate', 'such', 'instant', 'rapport', 'audience', 'emotional', 'weight', 'story', 'grit', 'dexterity', 'Michael', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'be', 'such', 'impassive', 'presence', 'beginning', 'when', 'form', 'own', 'person', 'actor', 'gentle', 'palpable', 'force', 'character', 'evolution', 'really', 'scenes', 'Bullock', 'Aaron', 'most', 'heartstrings', 'welled', 'up', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'shrewdly', 'engineered', 'moments', 'sidelines', 'country', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'supportive', 'husband', 'Sean', 'credibly', 'are', 'scene-stealing', 'turns', 'towheaded', 'Jae', 'Head', 'indefatigable', 'S.J', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'usual', 'gutsy-broad', 'form', 'Michael', 'tutor', 'Miss', 'Sue', 'Broadway', 'Adriane', 'Lenox', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'inDoubt-', 'film', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'Michael', 'haunted', 'mother', 'far', 'less', 'sports', 'movie', 'more', 'story', 'individual', 'need', 'power', 'family', 'film', 'powerful', 'respect']",N/A

Then of course came the Oscar nomination and the win right afterwards, I hadn't seen the film but I was happy for her. Sandra has done some good stuff before so she earned it, although I had seen ""Precious"" and thought for sure the leading lady in that had it. Regardless I was not upset and thought good for Sandra. Since then I have seen it and Sandra's husband has cheated on her, kinda sucks I guess since her whole acceptance speech was about him having her back. Any way on to the review, Mr. KIA had basically said all that needs to be said on this film but I will write any way. I recommend reading his review.This is the true story of Baltimore Ravens [hey I once lived in Maryland] player Michael Oher and the family that took him in. After a man helps him get into a good private school Mike still finds himself homeless, and basically alone in the world. That is until Leigh Anne Tuohy [Bullock] notices him talking to her son S.J. [Jae Head]. Later on she sees him walking in the rain and offers him a ride and a place to stay. The rest as the say is history, well there are some hurtles in the way. After taking him in they help him reach his potential in football, and basically in life. His story is very touching and inspirational and I am glad it worked out for him.I had a good time watching this movie and even all the hype did not kill it for me. I thought the filmmaking was done greatly by writer/director John Lee Hancock. Based on the book by Michael Lewis I think they did a good job although obviously things have been left out. Still everyone did a good job especially the cast and Quinton Aaron especially who played Big Mike. Jae Head and Lily Collins are good as the kids and of course Kathy Bates is great in anything. Country singer Tim McGraw does a great job as Sandra's husband and may be the person who didn't get enough credit for the performance. Then of course there is Sandra Bullock who is now an Academy award winning actress. Does she deserve it is not up to me but I am happy for her and I am glad she got it.I thought this was a good movie that has a lot of heart in it and I would recommend every one see it. Also for those who are interested I also recommend you read Mr. KIA's review. Whether you think Sandra deserved or not is pointless because this film is meant to be enjoyed.

1292491,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B002VECM6S,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[3, 3]","Sports movies are abundant these days, and so, with many dealing with overcoming obstacles, it is inevitable that some fall into a line of clich&eacute;s. As much as The Blind Side might appear to be a ""football movie,"" it really is more about life--that is, what it means to change it. In The Blind Side, Michael Oher's story is magnificently depicted. The film is still guilty some stereotypes and some corniness, but I don't think these moments are enough to detract from Michael Oher's story being told in a genuine way. We feel some sympathy for the young man, and some compassion for the woman and the family responsible for helping him to a new place in life. Oher, despite a difficult and dysfunctional upbringing, is able to work his way into the pro sports world thanks to Leigh Anne Tuohy and her supportive family.The Blind Side does have some clich&eacute;s, which we usually experience in ""race"" or ""sports"" films, and is a victim of uncomfortable sappiness at points. For instance, we have the obligatory obnoxious, racist Southern redneck father and son from the opposing team that Big Mike plays against, who act the part to perfection. We also have the ""white guilt"" references, and the overwhelming pity for the poor kid who has no chance. Inspiring at times, The Blind Side falls into some moments of cheesiness, such as the scene where Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) talks trash to some guys in the hood. Also, she decides she can be a better coach than the football coach, so she interrupts a practice to help the coach out and tell Mike how to block.Still, it is a film that has redeeming qualities which outweigh the negatives. We pull for Michael when he is struggling with his grades and fitting in to a new school and family. Leigh Anne Tuohy becomes the force that won't let him quit; she doesn't want him just to be another statistic, and makes sure that his dream will be fulfilled. This becomes a feel good story because Michael is a likeable kid who doesn't have all the advantages others do, but does something with the chances he's given.Sandra Bullock winning Best Actress for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy seemed a bit of a stretch and probably shows how subjective judging a star's performance really is. Overall, though, I'd say The Blind Side was a better than average film which does a sold job telling an inspirational story, but probably not worthy of a five star rating.",4,"Some cheesiness at times, but solid despite this",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2415,"['Sports', 'movies', 'are', 'abundant', 'days', 'so', 'many', 'dealing', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'line', 'clich', 'eacute', 'As', 'much', 'Blind', 'Side', 'might', 'appear', 'be', 'football', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'change', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'story', 'magnificently', 'depicted', 'film', 'still', 'guilty', 'stereotypes', 'corniness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'moments', 'are', 'enough', 'detract', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'genuine', 'way', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'young', 'man', 'compassion', 'woman', 'family', 'responsible', 'helping', 'new', 'place', 'life', 'difficult', 'dysfunctional', 'upbringing', 'able', 'work', 'way', 'pro', 'sports', 'world', 'thanks', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'supportive', 'family.The', 'Blind', 'Side', 'have', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'usually', 'experience', 'race', 'sports', 'films', 'victim', 'uncomfortable', 'sappiness', 'points', 'instance', 'have', 'obligatory', 'obnoxious', 'racist', 'Southern', 'redneck', 'father', 'son', 'opposing', 'team', 'Big', 'Mike', 'who', 'act', 'part', 'perfection', 'also', 'have', 'white', 'guilt', 'references', 'overwhelming', 'pity', 'poor', 'kid', 'who', 'chance', 'Inspiring', 'times', 'Blind', 'Side', 'moments', 'cheesiness', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'trash', 'guys', 'hood', 'Also', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'coach', 'football', 'coach', 'practice', 'help', 'coach', 'tell', 'Mike', 'how', 'block.Still', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'pull', 'Michael', 'when', 'struggling', 'grades', 'fitting', 'new', 'school', 'family', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'force', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'quit', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'be', 'statistic', 'sure', 'dream', 'will', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'Michael', 'likeable', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'advantages', 'others', 'do', 'something', 'chances', 'given.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actress', 'role', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'seemed', 'bit', 'stretch', 'probably', 'how', 'subjective', 'judging', 'star', 'performance', 'really', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'Blind', 'Side', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'film', 'sold', 'job', 'telling', 'inspirational', 'story', 'probably', 'not', 'worthy', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

1292493,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,B002VECM6S,"Gabriela Perez ""Oy! So many books. . . .""","[31, 34]","Don't get me wrong--I know this is a Hollywood version of Michael Oher's life during a particular timeframe. I know that certain real-life events have been tweaked in order to tug more effectively at my (and your) heartstrings. I also know that I can't assume that this movie is a perfect representation of this family and how Michael Oher came to be part of it.That said, I must admit to having been a sniffling fool throughout much of the film. I am particularly sensitive to stories that show human beings stepping outside of typical comfort zones and taking risks to embrace others who need the attention or support. This story, for all that it's been Hollywood-ized, shows a young man and a family doing just that, and it's powerful in spite of those moments that just seem too good to be true.I agree with other reviewers that Sandra Bullock has done an excellent job in this film. Her character might sound like a stereotype, but there's too much going on in her heart and head to keep her in a box that's easy to dismiss. She stands there in front of drug dealers who've been basically treating her like a piece of meat at the same time that they're sliding nasty, threatening looks over her designer-clad body, and she manages to hold her own. She enters territory that she likely hasn't ever encountered before, dangerous territory that must have struck fear into her heart and made her want to run in the opposite direction, but she enters and stays because she has something to accomplish, from finding Michael, to finding his drug addict mother, to ensuring that he doesn't meet a horrible end at the hands of those drug dealers leering at her. She does this, and then (I think) she spends however long it takes to fight back the emotions that these experiences bring out in her. The reviewer who said she basically hides when she is emotional is spot on, I think. She is all guts and sarcastic wit and in-your-face honesty because she has to be in order to get what she needs from others. But the soft side of her is reserved for very rare moments, either with her husband, or with Michael, who simply won't allow her finally to walk away and hide her feelings. Interesting that it seems at first that she is the one drawing him out, when ultimately they manage to pull the best from each other.The acting is superb all-around.  Quinton Aaron plays Michael, and he does it with such skill that it's easy to assume he is like Michael all the time, that he is simply playing himself. Instead, what we have is an actor who found the vulnerable core of his character and covered it with the flat, lumbering movements of someone barely connected to life and to other people. When we first meet Michael, it's hard to imagine that he will ever manage a full, genuine smile or even speak effectively to others. He begins to open up, and it's little moments where he reveals some of his past, or just simply tells us how his life is changing, that make him shine as a character. He's got a fair amount of anguish that he doesn't allow to come to mind very often, pain that has shaped him and led to that distance he seems to carry with him most of the time. Just an awesome acting job.The story was my favorite part, though, and I did find myself crying as the family pictures came up on screen after the movie proper was done. Crying because, hey, here are the REAL moments, many of them part of the film version, too. Here are the pics that show this giant kid dwarfing his new family but also show a group of people finding their joy together. Just very sweet and very necessary at a time when we are likely spending more energy worrying about how crappy other human beings can be. It's nice to be reminded that human beings also contain within them a core of kindness and compassion that they sometimes extend out in truly amazing ways to people who not only need it but who have so much of their own to give back.I will definitely get the DVD when it's released.",5,Sometimes you just need to know there are people who take these kinds of chances. . .,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,3972,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'life', 'particular', 'timeframe', 'know', 'certain', 'real-life', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'tweaked', 'order', 'tug', 'more', 'effectively', 'heartstrings', 'also', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'assume', 'movie', 'perfect', 'representation', 'family', 'how', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'came', 'be', 'part', 'it.That', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'having', 'been', 'sniffling', 'fool', 'much', 'film', 'am', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'stories', 'show', 'human', 'beings', 'stepping', 'typical', 'comfort', 'zones', 'taking', 'risks', 'embrace', 'others', 'who', 'need', 'attention', 'support', 'story', 'been', 'Hollywood-ized', 'young', 'man', 'family', 'doing', 'just', 'powerful', 'spite', 'moments', 'just', 'seem', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'character', 'might', 'sound', 'stereotype', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'heart', 'head', 'keep', 'box', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'there', 'front', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'basically', 'treating', 'piece', 'meat', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'sliding', 'nasty', 'threatening', 'designer-clad', 'body', 'hold', 'own', 'territory', 'likely', ""n't"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'must', 'have', 'struck', 'fear', 'heart', 'made', 'want', 'run', 'opposite', 'direction', 'enters', 'stays', 'something', 'accomplish', 'finding', 'Michael', 'finding', 'drug', 'addict', 'mother', 'ensuring', ""n't"", 'meet', 'horrible', 'end', 'hands', 'drug', 'dealers', 'leering', 'then', 'think', 'however', 'long', 'fight', 'back', 'emotions', 'experiences', 'bring', 'out', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'basically', 'when', 'emotional', 'spot', 'think', 'guts', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'in-your-face', 'honesty', 'be', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'others', 'soft', 'side', 'reserved', 'very', 'rare', 'moments', 'either', 'husband', 'Michael', 'who', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'finally', 'walk', 'away', 'hide', 'feelings', 'Interesting', 'first', 'one', 'drawing', 'out', 'when', 'ultimately', 'manage', 'pull', 'best', 'other.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'all-around', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'Michael', 'such', 'skill', 'easy', 'assume', 'Michael', 'time', 'simply', 'playing', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'actor', 'who', 'found', 'vulnerable', 'core', 'character', 'covered', 'flat', 'lumbering', 'movements', 'someone', 'barely', 'connected', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Michael', 'hard', 'imagine', 'will', 'ever', 'manage', 'full', 'genuine', 'smile', 'even', 'speak', 'effectively', 'others', 'open', 'up', 'little', 'moments', 'where', 'past', 'just', 'simply', 'how', 'life', 'changing', 'make', 'shine', 'character', 'got', 'fair', 'amount', 'anguish', ""n't"", 'allow', 'come', 'mind', 'very', 'often', 'pain', 'shaped', 'led', 'distance', 'carry', 'most', 'time', 'Just', 'awesome', 'acting', 'job.The', 'story', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'did', 'find', 'crying', 'family', 'pictures', 'came', 'up', 'screen', 'movie', 'proper', 'was', 'done', 'Crying', 'hey', 'here', 'are', 'REAL', 'moments', 'many', 'part', 'film', 'version', 'too', 'Here', 'are', 'pics', 'show', 'giant', 'kid', 'dwarfing', 'new', 'family', 'also', 'show', 'group', 'people', 'finding', 'joy', 'together', 'Just', 'very', 'sweet', 'very', 'necessary', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'likely', 'spending', 'more', 'energy', 'worrying', 'how', 'crappy', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'be', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'human', 'beings', 'also', 'contain', 'core', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'sometimes', 'extend', 'out', 'truly', 'amazing', 'ways', 'people', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'need', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'give', 'back.I', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'DVD', 'when', 'released']",N/A

Certainly, Sandra Bullock's performance was a plus--but unfortunately, the sheer flaws in the logic of the story ruined it for me.What am I talking about?Here it is: What happened to the black man, the uncle or relation who takes the two boys--including our hero--to the private school at the beginning of the film?They vanish--including younger brother. Yet this was a definitive moment in the film.So throughout my viewing, the thought pestered me: what happened to the person who brought the boy and his brother to the school in the first place? That question is just left out of the equation altogether and we next see the lovable gentle-giant-teen walking in the rain with nowhere to go: enter the Sandra Bullock character and her maternal gestures.I was left thinking--why couldn't they just kill off(dies in an accident or something) the older father-figure black man (and younger brother)or something so I can forget how the boy got to the school in the first place?But that question is completely forgotten about and therefore, my intelligence was insulted.We are now, apparently, in fantasy-land where the kid is just wandering around on the campus of this privileged all-white school.The other flaw was the bit about the teen not knowing anything about football--yet again, at the outset, we have the black father figure insinuating to the principal that the kid can do anything with a ball.It's this ridiculousness that made this movie flat-line for me.The rest is just sentimental nonsense.

1292503,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002VECM6S,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","BLIND SIDE is a quiet little film, one of the type we usually see on Hallmark Hall of Fame on television, that carries a tender message without really offending anyone or challenging the mentality of the viewer.  It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.'  John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it.  He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well.  Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances.  Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists.  It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow.  Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support.BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind.

Swift ""97jedi""","[2, 2]","The Blind Side tells the story (only slightly sensationalized according to various news stories) of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager taken in by a well-off family who make sure he's fed, clothed, and educated. They help him with his sports at the private school he attends in Tennessee while also giving him the family life he never really had. Despite the obvious racial difference, neither side seems to pay it any mind and neither does the viewer; it's mentioned in a few places, but the very realistically-portrayed characters ignore it because they're helping a boy in need. It's something of a heart-wrenching story, as the recruitment for college football runs afoul of NCAA inspectors who consider the parents' favoritism of Ole Miss to be a violation of recruiting rules as they are considered boosters due to their donations to the university. While this is the climax of the movie, Michael's interview with the NCAA inspector and his reaction to her accusations of impropriety, the movie has already provided a wonderful tale of overcoming one's odds through the generosity of those who have more than enough to give. Those hoping for the typical fare of a football movie with grand choreographed plays to make one cringe will be disappointed, since football is not the point of the movie, just a backdrop in a few scenes and the glue that holds the story together. But this movie could have succeeded without ever showing a scene on the field, since it's a story of what real family values are all about.The DVD is a fine transfer of the film, which rightfully got a Best Actress Oscar for Sandra Bullock (though Tim McGraw's fantastic portrayal of the father never seems to be mentioned), but there is a dearth of special features. These days, people expect a lot of behind-the-scenes featurettes, especially on a movie with Oscar wins attached, but there are none. Neither are there any feature commentaries. There are five deleted scenes of minimal consequence (that is, one can tell why they were cut since they were hardly necessary), though they fill in gaps for less-perceptive viewers, but nothing else. Viewers can watch it dubbed into French or Spanish, while subtitles for English and those two languages are also available.It's a great movie, but the DVD is really lacking in the features most buyers seem to look for these days, which is the only reason I gave this one four stars instead of five.",4,"Fantastic movie, bare-bones DVD",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2423,"['Blind', 'Side', 'story', 'only', 'slightly', 'sensationalized', 'according', 'various', 'news', 'stories', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'homeless', 'teenager', 'taken', 'well-off', 'family', 'who', 'make', 'sure', 'fed', 'clothed', 'educated', 'help', 'sports', 'private', 'school', 'Tennessee', 'also', 'giving', 'family', 'life', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'obvious', 'racial', 'difference', 'side', 'pay', 'mind', 'neither', 'viewer', 'mentioned', 'few', 'places', 'very', 'realistically-portrayed', 'characters', 'ignore', ""'re"", 'helping', 'boy', 'need', 'something', 'heart-wrenching', 'story', 'recruitment', 'college', 'football', 'afoul', 'NCAA', 'inspectors', 'who', 'consider', 'parents', 'favoritism', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'be', 'violation', 'recruiting', 'rules', 'are', 'considered', 'boosters', 'due', 'donations', 'university', 'climax', 'movie', 'Michael', 'interview', 'NCAA', 'inspector', 'reaction', 'accusations', 'impropriety', 'movie', 'already', 'provided', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'overcoming', 'one', 'odds', 'generosity', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'enough', 'give', 'hoping', 'typical', 'fare', 'football', 'movie', 'grand', 'choreographed', 'plays', 'make', 'one', 'cringe', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'football', 'not', 'point', 'movie', 'just', 'backdrop', 'few', 'scenes', 'glue', 'story', 'together', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'ever', 'showing', 'scene', 'field', 'story', 'what', 'real', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'about.The', 'DVD', 'fine', 'transfer', 'film', 'rightfully', 'got', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'father', 'never', 'be', 'mentioned', 'dearth', 'special', 'features', 'days', 'people', 'expect', 'lot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'especially', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'attached', 'are', 'none', 'are', 'there', 'feature', 'commentaries', 'are', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'minimal', 'consequence', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'were', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'fill', 'gaps', 'less-perceptive', 'viewers', 'nothing', 'else', 'Viewers', 'can', 'watch', 'dubbed', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'English', 'two', 'languages', 'are', 'also', 'available.It', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'really', 'lacking', 'features', 'most', 'buyers', 'seem', 'look', 'days', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five']",N/A

This movie shows the value of a functional family as well.Sandra Bullock earned her Oscar award in this movie, but in reality it's about Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) -- every scene either contains him or he's part of the discussion.Even though this movie is about sports, it isn't a sports movie. The focus is on the development of Oher. Leigh Anne Touhy may have taken the lead but the rest of the family all took an active role in accepting him.There are several things I like about this movie. First, you've finally got a movie where the main characters are Republican Christians and they're still good people! Second, it recognizes the reality of racism but it also shows that there are many whites who are not racist (including Republican Christians).While this movie is about a family, is it a family movie? I have for years believed that a PG-13 movie disqualifies itself from being a family movie, but this is one that can make me reconsider. In reality, I consider this a PG movie with a few PG-13 scenes as opposed to a true PG-13 movie. As with any movie (even G-rated ones), I encourage parents to watch it with their kids.This movie is a great blend of humor and drama. It has moments of humor, such as Katherine Bates' character describing Tennessee's football field or when Leigh Anne takes Mike shopping.I would highly recommend this movie.

It's always nice to see someone going from having nothing to having everything, especially when that someone is such a nice, gentle man who deserves it. Even if it was just because he was in the right place at the right time. In this case, he was homeless in the right place at the right time, which was a little different than usual. Sandra Bullock using that weird Southern accent took a little getting used to, but a third into the movie I almost managed to forget about it.The only annoying thing was all the college recruiting. It's so sad that good students - even students with straight A's - have to fill out tons of applications and pay tons of application fees begging for admission (and pay tons of tuition with tons of interest) while other students have the colleges begging them to choose them just because they have the skill to knock someone over on a field, or some such talent. Seems kind of skewed. (But that's how we end up with the millionaire sports stars while other Americans get by on $40,000 or worse, minimum wage.)In any case, I am glad it was a well-acted movie based on plot instead of a sports movie. Football tends to bore me, as do most sports, unless I am playing them. There were football scenes, of course, but they fit the plot and they were brief instead of overdone. After all, we already know he's a football star, so we don't need to see him win 16 games, right? Especially when they do that thing where the winning goal/touchdown/basket/point/whatever is scored in the last half a second.

And when it does happen, who notices? Apparently, someone noticed and brought to light a situation most of us would be uncomfortable trying to be around. And the one who would dare to go into it has more guts than most.A young black man that gets ragged on by a bunch of white people at a predominantly white ""Christian"" school can't stand it. The way the teachers treat Michael is rather disgusting, acting like he's just another lost cause, since he can't read and doesn't seem to pay attention worth crap... the reason they took him in? One of the teachers threw out a provocative thought, that if they weren't willing to give someone who hadn't been given a chance in life, they may as well take out the ""Christian"" part of their school's name.Turns out, that wouldn't be enough to help him. The teachers feel like they may as well give up on him, yet it takes one person to see through his struggles, the superficiality of all her rich, white friends, and do something- she challenges him to make his life better. Academically, that'd be a long shot, yet worth it if he can pull it off. His one winning shot? Use his anger, confusion, frustation, and more into a medium, something he's good at- football. But it's not only the friends of the woman nor the teachers who show socially racial bias against this newcomer from nowhere, even a redneck family gets a good chewout by Mike's newly surrogate mother. Literally everyone who portrays any trace of racism gets a good chewout to appropriate degrees, and no one can prepare for the wrath of this one mother who shows she can see through the surface of other people, see their potential, and help them. No matter what it takes.Helping Mike find a place to call home, finding people he can call family, helping him find people to identify with, no matter where from. Even the people from teh ghetto try to take him in, but end up making the mistake of making sexually degrading remarks about the mother and her daughter and Mike being around them. Not a good idea when the guy you're making bad jokes about is literally at least 2x your weight and, despite having a gentle nature, can take you out very quickly and very well.From Mike (the well-sized, misunderstood man willing to be different and hates the way others treats him as though blacks should be gone and is grateful someone sees him as a human being and treats him as such) to the Tuohy family, these people literally transcends social barriers in every way.When I first heard of this, it was through the movie poster.

1292547,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002VECM6S,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[5, 6]","Micheal Oher (Quinton Aaron) was a large black kid who grew up in the Memphis projects living on people's couches because his crack addicted mom was unfit to take care of him. One day, Tony Hamilton (Omar J Dorsey), trying to enroll his kid into Wingate Christian School, also gets Micheal enrolled in the school. Moving from place to place to find shelter, Michael finally comes across Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) who invite him to stay at their house, and eventually invite him to be a part of their family.The story of Micheal Oher is really a quite amazing one. Oher traveled from place to place never really having a place to stay, until he was invited by the Tuohy's to stay with them. Having never remained in a school for more than a year, and failing miserably, the Tuohy's helped him raise his grades to be able to play football (and basketball) in school. Eventually this lead to him being one of the most sought after high school players for college recruiters. Just before the 2009 NFL season he became a first round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens and became the 2009 Rookie of the Year. With such an amazing story of ""rags to riches"" how does Oher's story translate to film?Very well. One thing that surprised me, and I found refreshing was the fact that a such an openly Christian family was actually treated respectfully and without ridicule. I say this because the movie itself actually has a genuine spirit to it, it doesn't completely feel like a by the numbers inspirational sports movie. The writing does a great job at keeping many of the true things that happened in real life in the movie, moving things around as is typically necessary for screen stories, without making things feel forced. As sports movies go, this movie feels fresher than many that have come in recent years.This, of course, is the movie that not only earned Sandra Bullock her first Oscar nomination, but her first Oscar win as well and for good reason. Playing a character based on a real person is already a daunting task, but for an actress known most for playing America's sweetheart type roles, playing a strong willed genuinely philanthropic Christian woman is definitely not an easy task, but Bullock equips herself well and steals the movie. And Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher does a fantastic job playing Oher as a person who is shy, quiet, and even somewhat cynical, but doesn't allow his cynicism to define him. Throughout the film we watch these layers removed as he becomes more ingrained in the Tuohy household.My biggest problem with the movie is some of the changes they felt the need to make to this already fantastic true story. Michael Oher already knew how to play football before being placed on the team at Briarcrest (the real school that he attended while in the Tuohy home). Making it seem as though he didn't, to me, is an insult to the true character this film is trying to portray. On top of that the story, as portrayed in the film, is a little too good to be true. Having researched the matter a bit there's a lot in the real account of the story that does seem that way, but there was also a bit more struggle to get Micheal's grade's up, and he also wasn't the perfect teen that they depict him as in the movie. This lack of an inner struggle for the main character, as well as the lack of an outer struggle throughout most of the movie drags it down a few notches.All in all, I think it was a really good movie, and while it might not, in my opinion, be an Oscar worthy movie on the best picture front, its definitely one of the better inspirational sports movies to come out in recent memory.

I thought Bullock showed both the woman's pushiness and kind heart. I thought Quinton Aaron as Michael did a very good job. He had an intelligence, dignity and a sense of humor that shined through. The little kid was a bit much, but after I watched the family interviewed on TV, I thought it was about right. The football scenes were done well. The only bad acting was done by some of the coaches. I thought Old Miss coach did a really bad job.The movie took liberties with the story, but the story telling was very good and got the flavor of the story. The movie addressed subtle racism very well. The movie had one scene where the Mrs. Tuohy threatened a drug dealer. It seemed a little unreal, but could it happened? It seemed unlikely, it is hard to say. I haven't heard any comments on it by the family.It was an amazing story and the movie makers did a good job of bringing to the screen. Did Ms. Bullock deserve an Oscar? Before I saw the movie, I thought no way this role should lend itself to an Oscar nomination. However, after seeing her performance, I changed my mind.

I'm not much of a football fan, so a true story about an underprivileged kid being taken in by a rich family and making good on the gridiron didn't hold much appeal for me.Was I wrong!Football is NOT the main thrust of this story.  The film is more about faith and compassion -- and color-blindness.  Yes, I will take the title to refer to more than just a tackle protecting other players from threats they can't see.In fact, this story is so miraculous I almost couldn't believe it was true.  Leigh Anne Tuohy is obviously a remarkable woman and one of the strongest female role models I have ever seen in a movie, and Sandra Bullock embodies her with a performance that really did deserve the Oscar, even over the pitch-perfect Meryl Streep as Julia Child.As depicted here, the Tuohy's of Memphis are the very model of a proper Christian family.  When Leigh Anne sees young Mike homeless and alone, shivering in the rain, she doesn't hesitate to take him into her beautiful upscale home.  When it becomes clear that the shy and learning-challenged young man has no place to go home to, she welcomes him into their family.The scene at lunch is memorable, where Leigh Anne answers one of her well-heeled lady friends who questions why she isn't concerned bringing a large young black man into a home shared by a beautiful teen-aged white daughter.  ""Shame on you!"" Leigh Anne replies, and good for her!If only our country were filled with Leigh Annes instead of the so-called Christians who populate the Tea Party and continue to turn their backs on the homeless on every street corner!As a tutor the Tuohy's hire for Mike, Kathy Bates also makes an impression, warning them before they engage her, ""There's something you should know about me -- I'm a Democrat!""Fortunately they hire her anyway, and she helps Mike improve his grades enough to graduate high school and earn a football scholarship to Old Miss, on his way to becoming a pro with the Ravens.My only gripe here is I wish the DVD had a director's (and star's) commentary.  I would like to know if the particulars of the story are all true -- was Mike really investigated by the NCAA to see if the Tuohy's had acted improperly recruiting him for Old Miss?Did Mike really start a fight when one of his old neighborhood acquaintances made sexual comments about Leigh Anne and her daughter?Did Sandra Bullock get to meet the real Leigh Anne to perfect her steely but warmhearted characterization?I hope that this deficiency will be rectified with a tenth-year anniversary DVD or such in a few years.

1292557,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B002VECM6S,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[4, 7]","""The Blind Side"" is a wonderful, unforgettable masterpiece that's destined to become a perennial holiday classic.Everyone in your family--from youngsters to the older--should be enthralled with this magical movie experience brought to us by John Hancock.As writer and director, Hancock has gathered together a once-in-a-lifetime cast who enwrap you in a family so real that you feel like a member. Based on real life, the Tuohys of Tennessee find and nurture a homeless young black youth, Micahel Oher. They eventually adopt him and consider him a full-fledged member of their Christian family. They're also responsible for his becoming a multi-million dollar football star at Ole Miss.That's the heart of this story that will have you laughing one minute, and trying to choke back your tears the next.As the pistol packing, brassy Mother Lion, Leanne Tuohy, Sandra Bullock absolutely electrifies, giving the performance of a lifetime. Her Academy Award performance puts her firmly in the pantheon of movie greats. Like her legendary predecessors, Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh, Bullock has the magical spark that connects directly with the viewer and when she confronts a gang of thugs who threaten her newly adopted black son, Michael Oher, the hair on the back of your head tingles when Bullock gets right in their faces and spits"": ""You threaten my son, you threaten me!""  Looking fabulous with her new blonde do, wearing knock-out fashions and exuding electrifying charisma, Bullock brings us an unforgetabble heroine to love forever.Most of us can barely remember those actresses who've recently snared the Best Actress honor (quick, who was that French actress who won last year for ""La Vie En Rose"")  Sandra Bullock, however gives us a fiery, fabulous heroine that we'll be discussing and thinking about for years to come.This is hardly to say that Bullock is the only one who did great.  Hancock's entire cast--from the extras in the background, the school faculty, the athletes, the young performers in Michael's welfare housing projects--were all extraorinary.The Tuohy family became like people you'd love to have as neighbors: Tim McGraw is the handsome, genial head of the Touhy family and owns a chain of Taco Bell restaurants that make him a multi-millionaire. His two children played briilliantly by Lily Collins and the scene-stealing, impish Jae Head, enhanced this story-book family.The Blind Side should have won the Oscar for Best Picture but many of the big city movie critics hated it.  New York Magazine was especally notorious for its steady stream of sarcastic observations about Sandra Bullock and the movie itself.  Maybe it's staggering box office ($255 million domestically as of 3/14/2010) was a deterrant. Numerous other critics were aghast that Sandra Bullock was actually winning awards for her role over Meryl Streep.Bullock proves herself to be Hollywood's greatest star. She's a brillant commedienne (i.e, The Proposal, Miss Congenialty) and now with The Blind Side, a brillant dramatic actress.

""The Blind Side"" is not ""Rocky"". It's based on a true story, it actually happened, and for the general public to become immediately suspicious about the circumstances and the veracity of a woman like Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock) and husband Sean Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw) to not only assist but adopt, put through school, and eventually make into a high school football star a mute, sullen black kid named Michael (Quinton Aaron) from the poorest side of Tennessee is a bit frightening.Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job (only problem I had with her performance is that it diminished Sean Tuouhy's role in this semi-miracle and makes him look emasculated) as Leigh Anne Tuouhy, a woman who you imagine belongs to the Tea Party, votes Republican, and doesn't think too much beyond her next interior home decoration.  A sweet family with two nice kids and a lot of money, everything is picture perfect until two very different fates collide.Michael is a big, gentle giant from the projects who is so silent as to be mute.  He is given a transfer from his public school to a private school because they don't know what to do with him.  His mother is a crack addict and his father is AWOL.  This young man has the marks of poverty all over him--the only bed he has to sleep in is an inflatable mattress that falls apart under his massive frame.  Quinton Aaron's performance is so effective that he almost seems to be apart from this world entirely, so little is he loved or cared for.One day Leigh Anne and her husband see him walking in a rainstorm, leaving the school bleachers where he was picking up bags of discarded popcorn to eat.The long and short: Leigh Anne Touhy and her family did something that most of us would not even consider doing, perhaps even if we had the resources.  The moral audacity of this kind of act is what makes it so unique: it doesn't happen much.  Michael is now an all star football player due to the efforts of these people who didn't know him.  (And yeah, this happened in the South.  I was surprised too.)A great film, uplifting and not in an unrealistic or corny way.",5,The moment when one cannot turn away,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2284,"['think', 'film', 'yet', 'ooey', 'gooey', 'look', 'how', 'cute', 'nice', 'human', 'nature', 'can', 'be', 'featurette', 'just', 'saw', 'totally', 'different', 'thing', 'going', 'here', 'Blind', 'Side', 'not', 'Rocky', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'actually', 'happened', 'general', 'public', 'become', 'immediately', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'veracity', 'woman', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Sean', 'Tuohy', 'played', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'not', 'only', 'assist', 'adopt', 'put', 'school', 'eventually', 'make', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'star', 'mute', 'sullen', 'black', 'kid', 'named', 'Michael', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'poorest', 'side', 'Tennessee', 'bit', 'frightening.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fantastic', 'job', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'performance', 'diminished', 'Sean', 'Tuouhy', 'role', 'semi-miracle', 'look', 'emasculated', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuouhy', 'woman', 'who', 'imagine', 'belongs', 'Tea', 'Party', 'Republican', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'next', 'interior', 'home', 'decoration', 'sweet', 'family', 'two', 'nice', 'kids', 'lot', 'money', 'everything', 'picture', 'perfect', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'fates', 'collide.Michael', 'big', 'gentle', 'giant', 'projects', 'who', 'so', 'silent', 'be', 'mute', 'given', 'transfer', 'public', 'school', 'private', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'mother', 'crack', 'addict', 'father', 'AWOL', 'young', 'man', 'marks', 'poverty', 'only', 'bed', 'sleep', 'inflatable', 'mattress', 'apart', 'massive', 'frame', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'performance', 'so', 'effective', 'almost', 'be', 'apart', 'world', 'entirely', 'so', 'little', 'loved', 'cared', 'for.One', 'day', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'husband', 'see', 'walking', 'rainstorm', 'leaving', 'school', 'bleachers', 'where', 'was', 'picking', 'up', 'bags', 'discarded', 'popcorn', 'eat.The', 'long', 'short', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Touhy', 'family', 'did', 'something', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'doing', 'perhaps', 'even', 'had', 'resources', 'moral', 'audacity', 'kind', 'act', 'what', 'so', 'unique', ""n't"", 'happen', 'much', 'Michael', 'now', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'due', 'efforts', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'yeah', 'happened', 'South', 'was', 'surprised', 'too', 'great', 'film', 'uplifting', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'corny', 'way']",N/A

However, what you need to do is use your own mind and a little common sense and say - hey - here is a true story with (as they say in Europe) ""An American HAPPY END"" go see it for yourself, if you don't you of course will never know what you missed, but in my opinion it is a BAD decison not to see this on the big screen - Bullock just made me howel when she told the coack - ""I told you that you could thank me later, Well it is later!""

But if you let your intellectual critical faculties loose, you may feel as I do: I don't believe in the story as presented, I don't buy Sandra Bullock's character, and I found the acting uniformly poor. When Sandra, Mrs. Fashion Plate, a decorator, took into her home the big hulking African-American boy, I didn't believe it; nor did I believe it when she storms onto the field and orders the coach around. I didn't buy any of her family, and their acting certainly didn't help close the sale. Sandra plays a nervy, bossy character, but it's hard to suspend disbelief when she confronts some homeboys in the projects and claims she's packing.Kathy Bates plays the boy's tutor. Now if she had been the central character in the story, playing Bullock's role, I might have bought the story and the wife's character, but then the movie wouldn't have made hundreds of millions of dollars.This is the true story of a NFL lineman. Bullock, her husband, and Bates were all Ole Miss graduates and rabid football fans. In the movie the suggestion is made that this oversized boy was taken into the home deliberately to groom him as a future football star for Ole Miss. That would make more sense than the story as it stands. The movie has a lot of football game footage to satisfy sports fans.That the husband was so supportive of his wife and so uncritical, I find hard to believe. Sandra Bullock wanted to be a glamourpuss and a high-minded Christian do-gooder at the same time.

While I am sure to get lambasted for the next statement all I can say is bring some Kleenex because the movie while somewhat predictable is a tear jerker and exceptionally well done.Michael Oher, played by QUINTON AARON. is from the projects.  His mother is a drug addict with kids from more fathers than she can remember.  Her main goal in life is simply to find enough money to get the next fix and she has trouble even remembering her children's name let alone where they might currently be living.  Michael spends his time hopping form one couch to another and if he can't find a place to crash he sleeps on the street.  By luck of the draw he finds his way into a private all white Christian school and not long after gets kicked out of his current house.Leigh Anne Tuohy, played superbly by Sandra  Bullock is a bossy, no non-sense rich house wife.  She is strong willed to the point and doesn't spend a lot of time with the softer side of life.  She has a heart but she doesn't let it get in the way of her goal and the direction she has taken to get there.  By chance she sees Michael walking along the side of the road one night in shorts and a polo shirt in the rain.  It is freezing cold and she attempts to figure out why he is not at home with his family.  At that point she takes him into her house and her family reluctantly agrees.  With her iron clad ruling I am not sure her husband had a choice but she placates him at times with the thought that he might.There are several great lines in the movie but two that stand out for polar opposite reasons are:  Sandra Bullock at one point states that it isn't she who is making such a difference in Michael's life as much as it is he who is changing hers.  With his lumbering huge frame and raw physical power he is nothing more than a big soft teddy bear.  He is gentle with the kids, loves helping people and quite to the point of reclusive.  He comes across as a genuine product.  My girlfriend's favorite line is when Sean Tuohy, played by Tim McGraw says ""I never thought I would have a black child before I met a Democrat"".  You roll in the floor laughing at that one.Michael Oher might possess a natural athletic ability but he does not naturally like violence.  It takes him a while before he figures out the game of football but once he does he excels instantly with his innate talent.  The sports aspect plays a key role and with the story being based on the true life experiences it is amazing when you see Michael play on Sunday mornings for the Baltimore Ravens.  He ended up being a first round draft pick.The story is more about two worlds colliding and what we, who are a little more well off than others, can do to help if we open our hearts and our minds.  Color has always been a dividing point in our nation since the first slaves were shipped here from Africa.  One can only hope that with the first black President and the softening that has occurred over time we might as a nation finally be ready to set aside our prejudices and accept people for who they are as people versus their ethnicity.So bottom line, I loved the movie.  It was hard not to show the tears streaming down my cheek as I casually wiped them away.  It is a heartwarming, well acted, excellently directed production.  A perfect feel good story for the holidays that will hopefully spur some extra giving this year.  I strongly recommend seeing it if you can pull yourself away from the high octane action flicks and or vampire movies for a couple of hours.  You will not regret it.",4,"A Must See, Great Movie",1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,3971,"['are', 'movies', 'where', 'see', 'preview', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'script', 'out', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'even', 'get', 'car', 'drive', 'theater', 'Then', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'surprise', 'hell', 'Blind', 'Side', 'somewhere', 'in-between', 'what', 'took', 'off', 'guard', 'superb', 'acting', 'injected', 'several', 'humorous', 'moments', 'way', 'story', 'touched', 'heart', 'am', 'sure', 'get', 'lambasted', 'next', 'statement', 'can', 'say', 'bring', 'Kleenex', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'tear', 'jerker', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done.Michael', 'Oher', 'played', 'QUINTON', 'AARON', 'projects', 'mother', 'drug', 'addict', 'kids', 'more', 'fathers', 'can', 'remember', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'simply', 'find', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'next', 'fix', 'trouble', 'even', 'remembering', 'children', 'name', 'let', 'alone', 'where', 'might', 'currently', 'be', 'living', 'Michael', 'time', 'hopping', 'form', 'one', 'couch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'place', 'crash', 'sleeps', 'street', 'luck', 'draw', 'way', 'private', 'white', 'Christian', 'school', 'not', 'long', 'kicked', 'current', 'house.Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'played', 'superbly', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'bossy', 'non-sense', 'rich', 'house', 'wife', 'strong', 'willed', 'point', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'softer', 'side', 'life', 'heart', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'way', 'goal', 'direction', 'taken', 'get', 'there', 'chance', 'Michael', 'walking', 'along', 'side', 'road', 'one', 'night', 'shorts', 'polo', 'shirt', 'rain', 'freezing', 'cold', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'home', 'family', 'point', 'house', 'family', 'reluctantly', 'iron', 'clad', 'ruling', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'husband', 'had', 'choice', 'times', 'thought', 'are', 'several', 'great', 'lines', 'movie', 'two', 'stand', 'out', 'polar', 'opposite', 'reasons', 'are', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'one', 'point', ""n't"", 'who', 'making', 'such', 'difference', 'Michael', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'changing', 'hers', 'lumbering', 'huge', 'frame', 'raw', 'physical', 'power', 'nothing', 'more', 'big', 'soft', 'teddy', 'bear', 'gentle', 'kids', 'helping', 'people', 'quite', 'point', 'reclusive', 'across', 'genuine', 'product', 'girlfriend', 'favorite', 'line', 'when', 'Sean', 'Tuohy', 'played', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'black', 'child', 'met', 'Democrat', 'roll', 'floor', 'laughing', 'Oher', 'might', 'possess', 'natural', 'athletic', 'ability', 'not', 'naturally', 'like', 'violence', 'while', 'out', 'game', 'football', 'once', 'excels', 'instantly', 'innate', 'talent', 'sports', 'aspect', 'key', 'role', 'story', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'experiences', 'amazing', 'when', 'see', 'Michael', 'play', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'first', 'round', 'draft', 'pick.The', 'story', 'more', 'two', 'worlds', 'colliding', 'what', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'well', 'others', 'can', 'do', 'help', 'open', 'hearts', 'minds', 'Color', 'always', 'been', 'dividing', 'point', 'nation', 'first', 'slaves', 'were', 'shipped', 'here', 'Africa', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'first', 'black', 'President', 'softening', 'occurred', 'time', 'might', 'nation', 'finally', 'be', 'ready', 'set', 'aside', 'prejudices', 'accept', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'versus', 'ethnicity.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'show', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'cheek', 'casually', 'wiped', 'away', 'heartwarming', 'well', 'acted', 'excellently', 'directed', 'production', 'perfect', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'holidays', 'will', 'hopefully', 'spur', 'extra', 'giving', 'year', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'can', 'pull', 'away', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'flicks', 'vampire', 'movies', 'couple', 'hours', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",N/A

Michael Ohrer is a role model in how he overcame his poor childhood to the NFL through sweat and determination.Here's the downside:This film misleads people as to how inept Ohrer was on the football field before arriving at the Tuohy's house. He was a 6-5 black kid who didn't know anything about football, you see. It would see this angle was inserted to make it appear that the Tuohy's generosity was entirely based on their Christian principles, when in reality, 100% of the black boys they adopted went on to their alma mater and the NFL.In short, this movie literally vilifies all blacks except Ohrer himself. The problem with race relations in America, this movie teaches us, is black people. A scene where Bullock's character threatens some black thugs by telling them she's a member of the NRA is torn from the white Republican fantasy book of the nature of crime and violence.The Tuohys just might've saved Ohrer's life, but they all don't need to be so proud of themselves about it.",3,A movie for white conservative Southerns to feel good about themselves!,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1198,"['Nothing', 'wrong', 'really.This', 'movie', 'technically', 'good', 'league', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'overt', 'Christian', 'themes', 'exception', 'Narnia', 'films', 'terms', 'production', 'values', 'Michael', 'Ohrer', 'role', 'model', 'how', 'poor', 'childhood', 'NFL', 'sweat', 'determination.Here', 'downside', 'film', 'people', 'how', 'inept', 'Ohrer', 'was', 'football', 'field', 'arriving', 'Tuohy', 'house', 'was', '6-5', 'black', 'kid', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'football', 'see', 'would', 'see', 'angle', 'was', 'inserted', 'make', 'appear', 'Tuohy', 'generosity', 'was', 'entirely', 'based', 'Christian', 'principles', 'when', 'reality', '100', '%', 'black', 'adopted', 'went', 'alma', 'mater', 'NFL.In', 'short', 'movie', 'literally', 'blacks', 'Ohrer', 'problem', 'race', 'relations', 'America', 'movie', 'black', 'people', 'scene', 'where', 'Bullock', 'character', 'black', 'thugs', 'telling', 'member', 'NRA', 'torn', 'white', 'Republican', 'fantasy', 'book', 'nature', 'crime', 'violence.The', 'Tuohys', 'just', 'might', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'Ohrer', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'so', 'proud']",N/A

THE BLIND SIDE is sweet, compelling, emotional, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It is the perfect movie for a warm, cozy evening at home.THE BLIND SIDE is the true story of a homeless teenager Michael Oher, and the family that unconditionally takes him in.  Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael walking the streets late one cold night, and invites him into her home.  Somehow they need each other, and Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family.  As Michael improves his grades and learns about football, they all learn about the meaning of love, life, family, and support.  THE BLIND SIDE will make you laugh, make you cry, and give you hope.  It truly is a feel good movie.Sandra Bullock is excellent (and lovely) as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a strong, spunky woman with a huge heart, Tim McGraw as her amiable, likeable husband, and Quinton Aaron steals the show as the teenager who is so much more than he seems.  Kate Bates does a nice turn as Michael's tutor, encouraging him to do better, haranguing him when he doesn't try.  The chemistry of the entire cast is outstanding and quite believable.  The love of this family for each other radiates off the screen and makes you feel happy.  As an added bit of reality, a number of well-know NCAA college football coaches make cameo appearances as themselves.The script for THE BLIND SIDE is exceptional.  Even as life is getting better for Michael, you never forget where he came from and how hard he had to work.  You ache for this boy and horror of his childhood, and you cheer for this family and what they have done for each other.  The writers and the actors take you on a joyous emotional rollercoaster, from the tragic depths to the highest heights.  And the destination is most definitely worth the ride.So grab a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and a cuddly blanket.  Then pop in this movie and enjoy.

Sandra Bullock plays a mouthy mom only too ready to get into everybody's face about what she thought they should be doing including her white girlfriends who she met at lunch. When one of them broaches the topic of bringing in a black teen from the ghetto and that it might not be safe or that this very large teen from the ghetto might be dangerous, Sandra verbally slaps her in the face for being a racist. Then of course there was the obligatory dig at President Bush at the Child Protective services. Seems rich, white, mouthy mom Sandra Bullock can mouth off to just about everybody except a black woman working CPS, DMV & NCAA. But she eventually redeems herself when she confronts a gang of black crackheads who are catcalling her, while she was in the projects where she drove herself in her 2010 BMW. I didn't know weather to laugh or cry at this point in the movie. The few scenes in the movie where football was being played were just awful. Of course the opposing team is portrayed as as bunch of white, racist, redneck, Nazi's. How much self-flagellation do whites have to do before they can cleanse themselves of American History?  If anybody deserved an Oscar it would have been the actor who played SJ the young white son. If you want to see a good movie based on real life go see ""Radio"" or ""Invinceable""!

That's just what his life is, the hand he has been dealt. Leigh Anne is a wealthy electrically-charged wife, mother, business owner who doesn't listen to excuses or consider anything contrary to what she wants as a final answer.When Leigh Anne finds Michael headed toward the high school gym on a night where there was no mercy available, she takes him home and into her family. Day by day, realization by realization, each of them are changed and their lives meld together.There are tearful moments and ones filled with laughter and often both at the same time.

Finally it popped up on HBO and my wife and I sat down to watch it.After it was over we sat there staring at the blank screen and wondering what on earth was the fuss about and how on earth did Sandra Bullock win the Oscar for this?  The Proposal was better for heaven's sake, was that the name of the movie where she was Canadian and had to marry Ryan Reynolds to stay in this country?  Anyhow, I love a good football picture but this one made Michael Oher seem like an idiot, until the Touhys groomed him for football and university life, and apparently taught him to rap too.The main actor Quinton Aaron has a faint vestige of a personality. which the director must have thought suited the character well, for he varies it only slightly.  The rest of the cast, including Sandra Bullock, is fine, even Kathy Bates.  Well, the one actor I couldn't stand was the little boy, Jae Head, who just got more annoying in every scene.  Little Jae Head was good in Friday Night Lights, where he played a fatherless kid whom Tim Riggins took pity on early on in the series...  but here he's been directed to talk like Mickey Rooney on speed.  I hesitate to state here that I don't like little S.J. because people will think I don't like family movies about Republican Christians, because I do.  You can check out hundreds of my other reviews of family films to prove it.  Now also what was with THE BLIND SIDE seeding its cast with people we loved on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS?

I really wanted to like this movie and it had the potential to be a good movie, but it was too melodramatic and stereotypical.I didn't like the way that they portrayed Oher as basically being illiterate before he met the Tuohy's. I appreciate the fact that they took him in, but the movie made it seem like before they adopted him, he was reading on a 3rd grade level. That's just wrong.They bought him a SUV that he proceeded to wreck when he let himself get distracted. The kid was in the car with him. Instead of chastising him for being irresponsible, they praised his ""protective instincts."" WTF?The most ridiculous scene in the movie was when Sandra Bullock's character taught him how to play football. All of those coaches were there and he needed his step-mom to show him how to play football? (and based on Michael Oher's real autobiography, this was factually incorrect)There was no gray area in the movie. Every character was either good or bad. The NCAA people who accused the Tuohy's of being boosters were bad. The all-white football team who played Michael Oher's team were also bad and made the predictable racist comments. Sandra Bullock's former gal pals were more subtle in their racism.Another ridiculous scene was when Sandra Bullock went to the projects to look for Michael and then confronted that drug dealer. Some petite, blonde white woman is really going to stand up to a drug dealer?This is an interesting movie, but I really wish they stuck to the actual story that occurred instead of trying to dramatize it.

Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher, a big lumbering Black youth, who has little in life.  A caring, kind, generous family, the well-to-do Tuohy's, adopted the homeless teen.  This is a wonderful story about family, football, and fighting the odds against you.""Big Mike"", the homeless teen knows little of his mother, but much about the streets and projects of Memphis.  All he remembers of his childhood is traumatic and sad, but he is a good person and does not expect much, if anything of others.  A well-to-do Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) sees him walking in the rain and cold one night, and takes him in, although somewhat wary about whether he would rob and run.  He shows his good character, and slowly but surely becomes a part of their family.  Leigh Anne wants to know his family and finds his mother, who is ashamed of how she turned out.  Over a period of time and lessons learned, the Tuohy's adopt Michael and he changes their lives, as they help him change his.  Both the Touhly children are bright - SJ is fun to watch as he helps Michael practice football moves.Michael becomes a top-notch football star as well as an excellent student hitting the Dean's list.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[125, 140]","I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012.  So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so.  For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself.  He is the underdog we love to root for.The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description.  Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommendAkeelah and the Bee, another five star movie.  In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe  for her performance.A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor.  Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei inMy Cousin Vinny.  I predict this will be the year of the exception.  Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice.  This would be Bullocks first nomination.Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.I hope this was helpful to you, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",5,A true story that will move you.,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,3010,"['go', 'see', 'movies', 'time', 'are', 'still', 'release.At', 'time', 'year', 'have', 'high', 'profile', 'movie', 'offerings', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'New', 'Moon', 'same', 'vampires', 'world', 'coming', 'end', '2012', 'So', 'easy', 'movie', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'miss', 'movie', 'mistake', 'do', 'so', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'few', 'recommend', 'whole', 'heartedly.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'playing', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'tough', 'business', 'mom', 'who', 'big', 'Mike', 'young', 'oversized', 'kid', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'role', 'model', 'who', 'never', 'did', 'well', 'academically', 'had', 'reason', 'believe', 'underdog', 'love', 'root', 'for.The', 'Tuohys', 'take', 'plush', 'house', 'get', 'drawn', 'experience', 'perhaps', 'sucked', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'description', 'Mike', 'hidden', 'gift', 'others', 'sports', 'coach', 'can', 'identify', 'other', 'teachers', 'start', 'have', 'faith', 'so', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'happen.If', ""'re"", 'movie', 'importance', 'mentor', 'believing', 'people', 'more', 'believe', 'more', 'start', 'believe', 'like', 'one', 'also', 'recommendAkeelah', 'Bee', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'first', '14', 'days', 'Blind', 'Side', 'done', '108', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'assuring', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'hits', 'year.While', 'Academy', 'not', 'typically', 'reward', 'comedies', 'awards', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'may', 'get', 'nomination', 'so', 'might', 'writers', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'might', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance.A', 'point', 'interest', 'movie', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'daughter', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'who', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'daughter.Update', 'Jan', '29', '2010', 'now', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'Oscars', 'expect', 'will', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'stage', 'interesting', 'contest', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'actresses', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'interesting', 'mix', 'drama', 'humor', 'Oscars', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'given', 'type', 'performance', 'exception', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'inMy', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'year', 'exception', 'Streep', 'been', 'nominated', '15', 'times', 'winning', 'only', 'twice', 'would', 'be', 'Bullocks', 'first', 'nomination.Update', '2/3/2010', 'Blind', 'Side', 'been', 'nominated', '2', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Picture', '2010', 'Best', 'Picture', 'category', 'been', 'expanded', '5', '10', 'pictures', 'partly', 'falling', 'ratings', 'partly', 'many', 'popular', 'movies', 'have', 'not', 'historically', 'received', 'same', 'level', 'Oscar', 'love', 'movies', 'such', 'Blind', 'Side', 'received', 'public.Blind', 'Side', 'grossed', '238', 'million', 'dollars', 'domestically', 'making', '8th', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', '2009', '63', 'time', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'still', 'release.I', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

They are a faith-based white family with little to worry about monetarily but genuine in their beliefs (dialogue above).Leigh Anne Tuohy is a Southern Lady &#8211; all tight skirts, sunglasses in her hair, perfect make-up and possessed of a non-nonsense practicality aligned with a will of iron few will tackle (she mutters &#34;well all right&#8230;&#34; all the time). But beneath all that steely mettle is a heart of gold &#8211; a woman who practices her Christianity - rather than just spend time with it on a Sunday. To Leigh Anne giving is as natural as speaking &#8211; and colour is not an issue.Slowly Leigh Anne begins to notice her vivacious but tiny son S.J. gravitate towards the protective frame of Big Mike &#8211; a gentle giant with no malice in him and a handy ability to forget the past. One night walking back from the Coin-Op Laundry where Mike washes and dries one of only two teeshirts he owns (he&#8217;s been made homeless yet again) &#8211; Leigh Anne is driving with her family in tow and spots Mike walking in the freezing night air in flimsy clothing. He seems lost and even defenceless. She makes a decision to give him a place to stay that night &#8211; the opulent Tuohy home. And so it begins &#8211; a loving relationship that will eventually see him become a member of the family and Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy become his legal guardians.But then Mike begins to realize that when it comes to American Football &#8211; his 98% Protective Instincts (the only test he ever scored highly on) make him the perfect Left Tackle &#8211; the man who protects the Quarter Back. Soon huge clubs (six legendary football coaches make cameo appearances) are noticing his extraordinary natural ability to block anything that threatens his &#8216;family&#8217; (the team) and soon he is learning at school too. But it could all be derailed by the Social Services people who feel Leigh Anne may have set Big Mike up all along so that he would play for their beloved team 'Ole Miss' (Mississippi). Soon he is back at the drug-infested Projects and then the Coin-Op &#8211; confused and hurting&#8230;What gives &#34;The Blind Side&#34; a beating heart is that it&#8217;s beautifully played by all &#8211; especially Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron. There's a danger that it all descends into a rich-white-woman&#8217;s plaything &#8211; a patronizing project she&#8217;s taken on &#8211; it&#8217;s not like that. Bullock is fabulous in the role (and deserved her Oscar) while Aaron&#8217;s dignity in the face of ridicule and pain is filled with a grace that is still, peaceful and intensely moving.The BLU RAY picture is GORGEOUS &#8211; defaulted to Full Aspect &#8211; it looks incredible all of the time.

1292668,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002VECM6S,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I know it's been out for a while now but the fact is I didn't have the chance to see the film THE BLIND SIDE until this past weekend. All I can say to those who are following in my footsteps on this movie, you'll regret waiting once you have the chance. This movie far outweighed THE HURT LOCKER when it comes to what should have won for Best Picture at this year's Oscars. Understandable, though, as the film features no political motivation which seems to be how you win any more.For those who haven't seen it, the film is the true life story of football star Michael Oher and how a series of fortunate events led him from what could have been the most miserable of lives to one of fame and fortune. But more important than those qualities is that Oher was led by some unseen force to find a family and a home.Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a young black man, big for his age, who gets a chance to go to a private school with the hope of playing sports. Unfortunately his grades disqualify him from participating. With low test levels and a low level learning ability, it seems as if Michael isn't long destined for this school. Few of the kids take an interest in being friendly to him with the exception of young S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head).One cold and rainy day after being picked up from school, S.J.'s mother Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) watches as Michael walks in the rain. When asked where he is heading, he says the gym because it's warm there. Realizing the boy has no home, Leigh Anne invites him to stay the night at their house.A one night invitation turns into a long term situation as Leigh Anne decides to take on the responsibility of helping this young man. Husband Sean (Tim McGraw), daughter Collin (Lily Collins) and S.J. all welcome Michael into their home. Leigh Anne takes Michael shopping for clothes and helps him with studies as well. The teachers at the school help too as they realize Michael isn't stupid, he's just never been in a learning environment that encouraged him to study. Michael's life begins to change immediately.The help of the teachers and Leigh Anne pays off when Michael's grades raise enough for him to join the football team. But this huge player isn't what the coach expected as he tends to be non-aggressive on the field. Recognizing the coach just doesn't understand how to reach Michael, Leigh Anne walks onto the practice field and tells Michael that the team is his family and that since he has said he'd do anything to protect his family, he should apply that to the field. In so doing, he becomes the lynch pin to the success of the team.A twist in fate appears towards the end of the film as Michael's decision to go to Ole Miss for college is questioned by the NCAA. They feel that perhaps the entire incident of Michael's mentoring and guardianship by the Tuohys was nothing more than their using him to help their alma mater. The answer as to the truth in this can only be found within Michael's heart.The success Oher was able to sustain thanks to the help of one woman who made the decision to see to it that a human being wasn't just dumped one more time is what makes up the center of this film.  The football, the fact that Michael Oher is black, the rise in education and status are all planets that circle the sun here.  And that sun is the story of a person who was willing to ignore mindless comments, ignorant claims and the world around her in an attempt to simply help someone get a step up.Some have claimed that this is just another example of white people helping out blacks in an attempt to make themselves feel better. They miss the point of the film entirely. That's because while Bullock may be the star, the real story isn't about Leigh Anne Tuohy. The real story is about Michael Oher and his taking hold of the opportunity provided to him and making the best of his life.Rare today is it that we are presented with a film that contains as much heart as this one does. Even God is given a center piece in the film as it takes place at a Christian school. Too often films are mired in the nasty sides of life, the worst the world has to offer. Even in the scenes in this film that involve Michael's old neighborhood we get the chance to see him rise above and move forward.This movie offers all you could ask for. It offers plenty of laughs at the oddest of times. It offers portions that will touch your heart and bring a tear to your eye. But more than anything it offers you heart and the possibility of a bright future for anyone. Yes, it might be rare, but when movies like this are made they are worth making note of.",4,A MOVIE WITH HEART,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4602,"['know', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'now', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'THE', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'past', 'weekend', 'can', 'say', 'who', 'are', 'following', 'footsteps', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'waiting', 'once', 'have', 'chance', 'movie', 'far', 'outweighed', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'when', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'Oscars', 'Understandable', 'though', 'film', 'political', 'motivation', 'be', 'how', 'win', 'more.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'football', 'star', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'how', 'series', 'fortunate', 'events', 'led', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'miserable', 'lives', 'one', 'fame', 'fortune', 'more', 'important', 'qualities', 'Oher', 'was', 'led', 'unseen', 'force', 'find', 'family', 'home.Michael', 'Oher', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'big', 'age', 'who', 'chance', 'go', 'private', 'school', 'hope', 'playing', 'sports', 'Unfortunately', 'grades', 'disqualify', 'participating', 'low', 'test', 'levels', 'low', 'level', 'learning', 'ability', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'long', 'destined', 'school', 'Few', 'kids', 'take', 'interest', 'being', 'friendly', 'exception', 'young', 'S.J', 'Tuohy', 'Jae', 'Head', '.One', 'cold', 'rainy', 'day', 'being', 'picked', 'up', 'school', 'S.J', 'mother', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Michael', 'walks', 'rain', 'When', 'asked', 'where', 'heading', 'gym', 'warm', 'there', 'Realizing', 'boy', 'home', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'stay', 'night', 'house.A', 'one', 'night', 'invitation', 'long', 'term', 'situation', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'take', 'responsibility', 'helping', 'young', 'man', 'Husband', 'Sean', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'daughter', 'Collin', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'S.J', 'welcome', 'Michael', 'home', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Michael', 'shopping', 'clothes', 'studies', 'as', 'well', 'teachers', 'school', 'help', 'too', 'realize', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'just', 'never', 'been', 'learning', 'environment', 'encouraged', 'study', 'Michael', 'life', 'change', 'immediately.The', 'help', 'teachers', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'off', 'when', 'Michael', 'grades', 'raise', 'enough', 'join', 'football', 'team', 'huge', 'player', ""n't"", 'what', 'coach', 'expected', 'be', 'non-aggressive', 'field', 'Recognizing', 'coach', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'reach', 'Michael', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'walks', 'practice', 'field', 'tells', 'Michael', 'team', 'family', 'said', ""'d"", 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'family', 'should', 'apply', 'field', 'so', 'doing', 'lynch', 'pin', 'success', 'team.A', 'twist', 'fate', 'end', 'film', 'Michael', 'decision', 'go', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'college', 'questioned', 'NCAA', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'entire', 'incident', 'Michael', 'mentoring', 'guardianship', 'Tuohys', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'using', 'help', 'alma', 'mater', 'answer', 'truth', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Michael', 'heart.The', 'success', 'Oher', 'was', 'able', 'sustain', 'thanks', 'help', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'decision', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'dumped', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'what', 'up', 'center', 'film', 'football', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'black', 'rise', 'education', 'status', 'are', 'planets', 'circle', 'sun', 'here', 'sun', 'story', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'ignore', 'mindless', 'comments', 'ignorant', 'claims', 'world', 'attempt', 'simply', 'help', 'someone', 'get', 'step', 'up.Some', 'have', 'claimed', 'just', 'example', 'white', 'people', 'helping', 'out', 'blacks', 'attempt', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'miss', 'point', 'film', 'entirely', 'because', 'Bullock', 'may', 'be', 'star', 'real', 'story', ""n't"", 'about', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'real', 'story', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'taking', 'hold', 'opportunity', 'provided', 'making', 'best', 'life.Rare', 'today', 'are', 'presented', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'one', 'Even', 'God', 'given', 'center', 'piece', 'film', 'place', 'Christian', 'school', 'Too', 'often', 'films', 'are', 'mired', 'nasty', 'sides', 'life', 'worst', 'world', 'offer', 'Even', 'scenes', 'film', 'involve', 'Michael', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'rise', 'move', 'forward.This', 'movie', 'could', 'ask', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'oddest', 'times', 'portions', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'more', 'anything', 'heart', 'possibility', 'bright', 'future', 'anyone', 'Yes', 'might', 'be', 'rare', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'worth', 'making', 'note']",N/A

1292675,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,B002VECM6S,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[2, 3]","A touching drama based on the true story of Baltimore Ravens' offensive tackle Michael Oher. Growing up, Oher was an athletically-gifted, homeless African-American. Accepted into a private school on a financial scholarship, a rich, Christian family, the Tuohys, befriends Oher and eventually adopts him, giving him the love and stability he needs to become an all-American football player.The movie is a glowing account of what Christian faith, when practiced, really looks like. In a remarkably refreshing portrayal, Christian love is, again and again, a motivating factor for several characters in the movie to do what's right. Sandra Bullock, in an Oscar-winning role as Leigh Ann Tuohy, remarked after finishing the film, ""Wow, I finally met someone who practices but doesn't preach.""In one scene of the movie, a government official attempts to confuse Michael by accusing the Tuohys of adopting him only to help their alma mater, Ole Miss, recruit a star player. Michael realizes this is false, however, by recognizing he wants to go to Ole Miss because that's where his ""family"" went. The government agent is seen as meddling in the family's affairs, far out of bounds from where the government has any business intruding. My wife loves this movie.The cast is what makes this from being just a glorified Hallmark-moment movie.

Because it doesn't focus on football, but on what it means to be charitable and to have integrity AND it does it without crude rude humor and foul language (both seem to be major features of other sports-movies).The movie has just enough football that it added to the story rather than dominated it.

What Bullock thought he meant was his own room but he meant his own bed.As the movie unfolds the family bonds with Michael and he starts to show slight improvement at school.

Michael Oher is one of those people. Michael Oher, homeless, parentless (for all intents and purposes....his mother is a drug user) and misunderstood, just needs a break. The opportunity comes when Michael encounters Leigh Anne Touhy, an aggressive Southern Belle and wife to ex-Athlete and Taco Belle chain owner (85), Touhy.

I too was reluctant to watch ""The Blind Side"", after all I've seen, other football related dramas like ""Remember the Titans"" and ""We are Marshalls"" and wondered what could this movie offer? Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did. Although all are based on true stories, about men who beat the odds (whether it was segregation, racism or simply their misfortunes) to become professional athletes, the ""Blind Side"" suggests that there are some people in society who do for others with no hope of reward or recognition for the acts themselves. And in this story, although race was an issue, it seemed to focus more on the socio-economic difference between Michael and the Touhy's, versus race. Although some questioned the motives of the Touhy family, to mentor and later adopt a young athlete who had tons of potential, I believe that they did it because they wanted to make a difference.

Seeing Sandra Bullock in the movie ""The Proposal"" gave me a chill of her masculine rude demeanor. The previews enforced the same image of an over-confident yet shallow woman. In this movie, Bullock still holds that stiffed attitude of hollowness, concealed under the faade of overconfidence.I doubt that a sensitive woman like the real Leigh Anne Touhy would venture into a dangerous ghetto in such provocative attire that the movie displayed. At least, a woman that believed in standing by the underdog would also display sense of modesty. In the photo of the real Michael Oher, Leigh Anne Touhy sounded more down-to-earth than her actress counter-part.The scene when Bullock walked into the field, slammed the coach on his rear end, and grabbed two male players by their helmets could only happen in a movie. The idea of having a woman with the noble motive who could salvage the future of desperate poor adolescent conflicts with the harshness and meanness of an aggressive woman who overrides a football coach by her intrusive and improvised coaching.The best two actors in the whole movie were those played by Tim McGraw in the role of the husband and Jae Head in the role of the son of the white family. The little boy acted brilliantly in solving many formidable problems for which reserved adults could not comprehend a solution. Tim McGraw behaved naturally unrestricted and without the excessive show of meanness of Bullock.The ""blind side"", in the Blind Side movie, conveys many meanings: the blinding of detached and intoxicated poor people from the realities of modernity, the blinding of middle class people by long rooted hateful racism, the blinding of educators emphasizing grades over human circumstances, the blinding of football fans by entertainment and winning over character, the blinding of sports promoters by money and success, and the blinding of political organizations to the real struggle of the majority of the poor.The most prominent blinding was the breaking through the boundaries of poverty by the mere chance of entertaining the wealthy racist southerns by an overweight black child. For Oher's dilemma to get attention, it required many odd circumstances to work in his favor. The cold and freezing weather, the big, tall and poorly dressed black boy, crossing the street in front of a BMW in a white Christian neighborhood, and the calming demeanor of the helpless boy, all worked to bend the subconsciousness of passersby to his predicament.",5,A wonderful display of many blind spots in our culture.,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2531,"['previews', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'discouraging', 'Seeing', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'Proposal', 'gave', 'chill', 'masculine', 'rude', 'demeanor', 'previews', 'enforced', 'same', 'image', 'over-confident', 'yet', 'shallow', 'woman', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'still', 'stiffed', 'attitude', 'hollowness', 'concealed', 'faade', 'overconfidence.I', 'doubt', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'real', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Touhy', 'would', 'venture', 'dangerous', 'ghetto', 'such', 'provocative', 'attire', 'movie', 'displayed', 'least', 'woman', 'believed', 'standing', 'underdog', 'would', 'also', 'display', 'sense', 'modesty', 'photo', 'real', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Touhy', 'sounded', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'actress', 'counter-part.The', 'scene', 'when', 'Bullock', 'walked', 'field', 'slammed', 'coach', 'rear', 'end', 'grabbed', 'two', 'male', 'players', 'helmets', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'movie', 'idea', 'having', 'woman', 'noble', 'motive', 'who', 'could', 'salvage', 'future', 'desperate', 'poor', 'adolescent', 'conflicts', 'harshness', 'meanness', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'who', 'football', 'coach', 'intrusive', 'improvised', 'coaching.The', 'best', 'two', 'actors', 'whole', 'movie', 'were', 'played', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'role', 'husband', 'Jae', 'Head', 'role', 'son', 'white', 'family', 'little', 'boy', 'acted', 'brilliantly', 'solving', 'many', 'formidable', 'problems', 'reserved', 'adults', 'could', 'not', 'comprehend', 'solution', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'behaved', 'naturally', 'unrestricted', 'excessive', 'show', 'meanness', 'Bullock.The', 'blind', 'side', 'Blind', 'Side', 'movie', 'conveys', 'many', 'meanings', 'blinding', 'detached', 'intoxicated', 'poor', 'people', 'realities', 'modernity', 'blinding', 'middle', 'class', 'people', 'long', 'rooted', 'hateful', 'racism', 'blinding', 'educators', 'emphasizing', 'grades', 'human', 'circumstances', 'blinding', 'football', 'fans', 'entertainment', 'winning', 'character', 'blinding', 'sports', 'promoters', 'money', 'success', 'blinding', 'political', 'organizations', 'real', 'struggle', 'majority', 'poor.The', 'most', 'prominent', 'blinding', 'was', 'breaking', 'boundaries', 'poverty', 'mere', 'chance', 'entertaining', 'wealthy', 'racist', 'southerns', 'overweight', 'black', 'child', 'Oher', 'dilemma', 'get', 'attention', 'required', 'many', 'odd', 'circumstances', 'work', 'favor', 'cold', 'freezing', 'weather', 'big', 'tall', 'poorly', 'dressed', 'black', 'boy', 'crossing', 'street', 'front', 'BMW', 'white', 'Christian', 'neighborhood', 'calming', 'demeanor', 'helpless', 'boy', 'worked', 'bend', 'subconsciousness', 'passersby', 'predicament']",N/A

This is probably due to that fact she usually plays the same character in most of her films.Instead of picking on this good natured film, I have to ask myself why do I watch movies?

I honestly can't believe so many critics and everyday, intelligent people like this garbage. I can't be alone on this one, right? Here are just four reasons why ""The Blind Side"" is so terrible...1. We never really experience Big Mike's uphill struggle. We get snippets of his horrible past and clues that he's going nowhere fast (he throws his laundry into another person's wash load because he doesn't have money), but we never really know what it's like to walk in his shoes. That would've made me care about him just a little bit! Then, when he succeeds in the end, it actually matters! Instead, we're supposed to feel his pain because he mopes like a child for two hours.2. ""I'm not changing him. He's changing me."" Just ONE example of lazy, predictable, awful writing that will make you vomit in your mouth, not to mention it makes no sense. HOW is Big Mike changing you? Your character was a strong woman from the beginning and continued to be strong until the end. How exactly did you change, Sandra?3. During the big game, the coach answers his phone and lo and behold, it's fiesty Sandra Bullock on the other end with play calling advice. That's right. The serious, focused coach answers his personal cell phone during the big game, even though there's no way he could hear his phone ringing in a raucous football stadium. It's THAT movie. You know, the kind of movie that manufactures something totally absurd to remind you that this is supposed to be a heart-felt, cute, and endearing story. Absolutely insulting, especially because it's trying to pull the ""underdog"" heartstrings. You can't make a realistic, ""triumph of the human spirit"" story and do this stuff. Save it for Sandra's chick flicks! In fact, I don't know what makes me angrier - the scene or the fact that people like it!4. Everything about ""The Blind Side"" will make you laugh AT it, not with it. Your eyes will also get tired from rolling so much. The logic in the writing is so warped, I yelled at the t.v. on several occasions. For instance, Sandra says, ""Did your mother read Ferdinand to you, Michael?"" Are you bleeping kidding?!

In fact I was just minding my own business and getting on a flight from London to Mexico City, ready to hanker down for a nice long 10 hour sleep.But the flight attendants were busying themselves to serve the food and the cabin was buzzing, so I thought I would watch the first 1/2 hr or so of a film whilst I waited for everything to calm down and the cabin lights to be dimmed.I picked The Blind Side because I was convinced that the film would hold absoluteley no appeal to me. In hindsight, this turned out to be far from the truth.Firstly, Sandra Bullock is one of those mainstream actresses that is eminantly watchable and likeable. Yes, her films usually won't rattle your life or even leave you with a huge amount to think about, but they are usually fun and enjoyable. In this though, you soon forget that it is Sandra in the role and quickly become immersed in the life and kindness of Leigh Anne.Secondly, even most real-life stores are dramatised for added impact/effect with tensions built for little reason other than viewer entertainment. In this film I found the reflection of a real life family really compelling. It is startingly different to watch a film where you are drawn into the lives of the people on-screen without relying on gimmicks to keep your attention.Thirdly, the courage and fortitude of Michael Oher, born into indifference, poverty and lack of opportunity, and his ability to simply be a decent and kind man, overwhelming the odds, making a life that brings both him and his adopted family such wealth and joy, is simply profoundly moving.Suffice to say, I did not get much sleep on the flight and arrived in Mexico tired but happy.

In  the book as  wellas the movie,  Leigh Ann  was the  driving  force-as  in real  life-  for helping  Michael Oher  withhis  transformation  for  his  last  two  years  at  Briarcrest  Christian  school.The  movie  stay true  to  the  book. The book  and  the movie  exposed many  social  ills ofour  society-such  as  falling  school  systems, drug  problems,  parenting  problems  and  the gaps  between  the rich  and poor.  However,  the  focus  of  movie  and the book  are  toshow  that  an american  family  taking  chances  on  a  homeless  teenager  with  open  armsand  offering  him  a  second  chance  in life.(obviously  hard  for  some one to swallow.)one  good  example  here:  Collins  Tuohy  dropped  all  her  advanced  placement  class  tobe with  Michael's  mathematics and  English  class  at  their  senior  year. In an  interview, she  stated  she  was  glad  to  do  it  to  help him out. this  example  addressed  the  point  as to why  there  were  few conflicts  in this  movie. Michael  Oher  deserved  much credit  for  his  vision and  excellent coping  life  skills  while he  was  homeless. He  is  an  inspiration  for many  of  us  in tough  times. I  have  seen the movie  precious  too.  The  incest,  child  abuses and  in-equity  are  common  among  american  families.  The  movie blind side  just  exposed  them  and not  went  into  details.  However,  the movie did  show the  true  life  story  of  Michael  for  a  period of  time.  I  recommend  this  movie  to  everyone  who  is  open-minded.",5,"A  great  family  movie with  much  heart,  warmth,  encouragement,  great  family  Values",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,2518,"['blind', 'side', 'was', 'written', 'Michael', 'Lewis', 'financial', 'journalist', 'came', 'acrossthe', 'material', '2004', 'when', 'was', 'working', 'book', 'finances', 'NationalFootball', 'league', 'noticed', 'left-tackle', 'position', 'was', 'gaining', 'importance', 'SeanTuohy', 'was', 'classmate', 'High', 'school', 'told', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'positionand', 'adoption', 'story', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', '25', 'years', 'are', 'wealthy', 'are', 'not', 'seeking', 'personal', 'gainat', 'took', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'devoted', 'much', 'time', 'energy', 'moneyto', 'nurture', 'was', 'really', 'mircale', 'go', 'almost', 'zero', 'grade', 'point', 'average', '2.6', 'grade', 'needed', 'play', 'division', '1', 'footabll', 'NCAA', 'requirements', 'movie', 'was', 'unique', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'Tuohy', 'contributed', 'much', 'too', 'However', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'did', 'not', 'trust', 'man', 'due', 'rough', 'upbringing', 'book', 'wellas', 'movie', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'was', 'driving', 'force-as', 'real', 'life-', 'helping', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'transformation', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'Briarcrest', 'Christian', 'school.The', 'movie', 'stay', 'true', 'book', 'book', 'movie', 'exposed', 'many', 'social', 'ills', 'ofour', 'society-such', 'falling', 'school', 'systems', 'drug', 'problems', 'parenting', 'problems', 'gaps', 'rich', 'poor', 'However', 'focus', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'toshow', 'american', 'family', 'taking', 'chances', 'homeless', 'teenager', 'open', 'armsand', 'offering', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'obviously', 'hard', 'one', 'swallow', 'one', 'good', 'example', 'here', 'Collins', 'Tuohy', 'dropped', 'advanced', 'placement', 'class', 'tobe', 'Michael', 'mathematics', 'English', 'class', 'senior', 'year', 'interview', 'stated', 'was', 'glad', 'do', 'help', 'out', 'example', 'addressed', 'point', 'why', 'were', 'few', 'conflicts', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'deserved', 'much', 'credit', 'vision', 'excellent', 'coping', 'life', 'skills', 'was', 'homeless', 'inspiration', 'many', 'tough', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'precious', 'too', 'incest', 'child', 'abuses', 'in-equity', 'are', 'common', 'american', 'families', 'movie', 'side', 'just', 'exposed', 'not', 'went', 'details', 'However', 'movie', 'did', 'show', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Michael', 'period', 'time', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'who', 'open-minded']",N/A

Well, such a story can still be inspiring today in the right context.  The Blind Side shows us that having someone coming from nothing get some help from someone who's coming from plenty can be just as inspiring.  Again, context is important and this film understands that perfectly.  And so we are taken on the journey that is the life of Michael Oher, played here by Quinton Aaron, as he struggles through school and eventually draws the attention of the Tuohy family, who ultimately take him in.  With some help from them, Michael discovers his love for football (a deviation from his real-life story, in which he was already pretty talented in the sport) and becomes a star on his high school team after he is prompted to think of his teammates as his family and apply his protective instincts accordingly.  This soon draws the attention of college coaches and eventually leads to an NCAA investigation surrounding Michael and his family's conduct in his college selection.  This is a great film and Sandra Bullock, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, definitely earned that Oscar.  I felt an odd sort of comfort with her and Tim McGraw, who played Sean Tuohy, portraying a southern Christian couple.  They just worked so well together and Mr. McGraw displayed some acting chops I never knew he possessed.  I especially enjoyed the scene where he is explaining the meaning of the book that Michael is reading.  Kathy Bates was great as the tutor who happens to be a Democrat, but I think she didn't get enough screen time...come on, it's Kathy Bates!  She owned this role as she always does.  Ultimately, I found only one thing wrong with this film:  the montage of the college coaches coming to visit Michael.  While I thought it was beyond awesome that the real-life coaches of that time were playing themselves in the film, I found it beyond, beyond annoying that Sean ""S.J."" Tuohy, Jr., played by Jae Head, was bargaining for benefits for himself with each of the coaches.  I could have done without that.  There is no way, no way that happened in real life!  My only hope is that the NCAA representatives saw that montage and had a stroke.  Michael's alleged violation in regards to him choosing ""Ole Miss"" seems like a minor traffic infraction compared to what I saw this little kid doing.  But despite this glaring problem that I cannot ignore, this is a great film about an amazing and inspiring story that I'd highly recommend to anyone.

Everyone can see he is huge, and he's great with a basketball.  He ends up getting into a private Christian school, and they want him to play football, but he needs to seriously raise his grades first.Leigh Tougy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean Tougy (Tim McGraw) see `Big Mike' walking late at night when it's cold out, and figure out that he has no home, and invite him to stay with them for the night.  They end up becoming much more involved, and helping his teachers and his coach understand who Michael is.  Helping them learn how to teach him.A movie about adoption, taking care of other peoples needs, and not caring about other peoples judgement.  A movie about beating the odds and getting out of unfavorable situations.  A movie about real family love (and Michael IS part of their family).I liked the Blind Side, it was a good story that was well written. There was swearing in it, although not so much that I couldn't enjoy the movie (of course I would have prefered they skipped that all together and it still would have flowed well, but that's me).  No sex scenes or even hints of it.  Michael did at one point defend his ""sister"" and ""mom"" from offensive comments from his old friends.The first 5 minutes confused me, and I kept waiting for more details about it, but I never did see more about it.  It was about a football accident involving other players, but I didn't see how it fit.  Because of this scene I was tense waiting for the `accident' and sure that his life was going to be ruined.I was able to enjoy this movie even with the swearing, some violence, and the gang members used derogatory slang towards women.

1292774,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002VECM6S,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","This is a film with a story that is perpetually on the brink of pathos and a sop to white guilt over the position of a huge number of African-Americans in American society. The phrase ""white guilt"" even comes up in the film. There is no question that you can't avoid thinking about these things when confronted by a film about a wealthy white family taking in an exceptionally poor, socially unsupported black kid and raising him through his high school years. Let's set all that aside for a second. The film tells a story about people caring about other people and those who can helping someone else who needs it. And we all can't help but love rags to riches stories. Especially if they have a basis in fact.The political aspects of this film have generated a huge amount of controversy. The story of a white family helping a black kid is bound to stir controversy. There are so many issues raised by this that I won't even start to get into that. I think people will bring their own politics to a viewing of the film, so it will serve as a Rorschach test. I see it as an indictment of society at large and the almost complete lack of opportunity for a huge number of very poor blacks. I see Michael Oher as an exception, a kid who got very lucky because of the compassion of one family in a position to help. Conservatives will see this as a validation of private largess, while I see the opposite, with virtually no one willing to do what the Tuohy's did. Not many people will get breaks like Michael did.I'm happy for Sandra Bullock. I've always liked her, but have watched her career with a sense of horror. She has turned down some roles in pictures that were successful, while she has been in a long string of clunkers. This was easily her best role since . . . SPEED? Many of her best roles actually came from before SPEED, in small supporting performances. Of the top box office actresses of her era, she may have the worst group of movies on her resume. I also like that she is another of an increasing number of actresses to continue to enjoy success after turning 40. It is great to see her have such great success after so many stinky movies.As an Arkansas fan (and therefore an SEC fan) I got a kick out of seeing former Arkansas coaches Lou Holtz (who was fired for his awkward handling of racial tensions on the team, stupidly making a commercial endorsing racist North Carolina senator Jesse Helms when the Arkansas program was being torn apart by accusations of racial insensitivity on the team--and what could be racially less sensitive than making a commercial for that old hate monger) and Houston Nutt (fired due to stupidity of some Arkansas fans who created an untenable atmosphere -- not that I don't enjoy the current Arkansas coach). There is a funny moment where Houston Nutt, as the Arkansas head coach, notices that Leigh Anne is holding an Ole Miss cup. That is funny because when fan pressure drove Nutt out of his job at Arkansas, he became the head coach at Ole Miss. Speaking of Arkansas, Michael Oher should have gone there. Darren McFadden and Felix Jones might have been even more productive. Well, maybe not. I'm not sure how either of them could have done much more than they did. Oher did end up playing for Houston Nutt. Interestingly, I am pretty sure that all of the coaches who appeared in the film are now actually at other schools or out of football entirely.I have to point out that a couple of actors from one of my all time favorite TV series, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, were in THE BLIND SIDE. The boy who played the irrepressible S.J., Jae Head, played the equally irrepressible Bo in Season One of FNL, a little boy who idolized Tim Riggins.

Zwick,"[4, 6]","It would be easy to be cynical about ""The Blind Side"" - to point out how it's just another tale of a do-gooding rich white person condescending to help out a struggling minority; that it once again shows a minority at the mercy of the generous white folk; and that it is filled with heart-tugging but implausible Kumbaya moments designed to make us feel good about ourselves and our nobility.  Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.Based on the book ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"" by Michael Lewis, ""The Blind Side"" is what ""Precious"" might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's ""rescued"" by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well.  A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when ""The Blind Side"" threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and sentimental uplift.  But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid.  And little Jae Head (""Hancock"") steals every scene he's in as Michael's wise-beyond-his-years little ""brother,""  S.J.  Writer/director John Lee Hancock doesn't bring a whole lot of ingenuity to the plotting or depth to the characters, but he gets the job done, which, I suppose, is all one can really ask for from a film in this genre.As a drama centered around high school football in the South (in this case, Memphis), ""The Blind Side"" can't hold a candle to the magnificent TV version of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but its inspirational story may get to you anyway - whether you choose to give yourself over to it or not.",3,standard-issue feel-good drama with compelling performances,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2649,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'be', 'cynical', 'Blind', 'Side', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'just', 'tale', 'do-gooding', 'rich', 'white', 'person', 'condescending', 'help', 'out', 'struggling', 'minority', 'once', 'again', 'minority', 'mercy', 'generous', 'white', 'folk', 'filled', 'heart-tugging', 'implausible', 'Kumbaya', 'moments', 'designed', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'ourselves', 'nobility', 'Yes', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'do', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'NFL', 'long', 'way', 'nipping', 'least', 'cynicism', 'bud.Based', 'book', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Evolution', 'Game', 'Michael', 'Lewis', 'Blind', 'Side', 'what', 'Precious', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'designed', 'mass-audience', 'mind', 'lump-in-the-throat', 'feel-good', 'crowd-pleaser', 'generally', 'inarticulate', 'plus-size', 'black', 'youngster', 'who', 'falling', 'cracks', 'big', 'time', 'due', 'poverty', 'wretched', 'parenting', 'Only', 'Michael', 'case', 'rescued', 'Tuohy', 'family', 'primarily', 'feisty', 'socialite', 'mom', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'home', 'loving', 'environment', 'lessons', 'how', 'be', 'world-class', 'football', 'player', 'as', 'well', 'behemoth', 'kid', 'who', 'shy', 'reticent', 'field', 'aggressive', 'domineering', 'least', 'once', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'given', 'good', 'talking', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'seem', 'nearly', 'as', 'scarred', 'upbringing', 'embittered', 'towards', 'humanity', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'given', 'been', 'child', 'certainly', 'miles', 'ahead', 'Precious', 'coping', 'department', 'story', 'not', 'none', 'across', 'convincing', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Blind', 'Side', 'drown', 'sea', 'sanctimony', 'sentimental', 'uplift', 'also', 'pull', 'back', 'precipice', 'least', 'periodically', 'thanks', 'performances', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'pushy', 'aggressive', 'being', 'off-putting', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'who', 'Michael', 'sweet', 'likable', 'kid', 'little', 'Jae', 'Head', 'Hancock', 'steals', 'scene', 'Michael', 'wise-beyond-his-years', 'little', 'brother', 'S.J', 'Writer/director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', ""n't"", 'bring', 'whole', 'lot', 'ingenuity', 'plotting', 'depth', 'characters', 'job', 'done', 'suppose', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'ask', 'film', 'genre.As', 'drama', 'centered', 'around', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'South', 'case', 'Memphis', 'Blind', 'Side', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'magnificent', 'TV', 'version', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'inspirational', 'story', 'may', 'get', 'anyway', 'choose', 'give', 'not']",N/A

The big shaggy football player is a gentle giant who protects the family in various ways--he watches their ""blind side."" Its a foot ball analogy. During a car accident, he reaches out his arm and protects the little brother from flying through the windshield and becoming a human cannon ball. He has these natural ""protective instincts."" Like the way he protects the playeres on the football field, he also protects the adoptive family. Blah blah blah. And they all live happily ever after.Perhaps the worst line in the movie is when Sandra Bullock says, ""No, I'm not changing his life, he's changing mine,"" or something corny like that. I think we could make a list of corny scenes and lines.Who knows what the truth is about this story, or how Michael Ohr really got into the NFL. This story is so self congradulatory.There is one small part in the movie that I do like. The part where Michael Ohr reads the poem ""The Charge of the Light Brigade."" It is about warriors who march on when they know they will probablly fail. About the courage to do something really hard, like go to a new school where you don't know anyone.  But the rest of this movie is just so syrup-y. I guess you could watch it when you need a serotonin surge.The whole story, ultimately, is told from Leanne Touhy's vantage point. Every one in her world has names, personalities, goals. Everyone from Michael Ohr's world is nameless, goal less, hopeless. Obviously, Leannne thinks this kidnapping is a form of salvation for ""michael.""

He attends a Christian school and when he's spotted roaming the streets he is taken in by a rich white family who help him through school and give him a home and some stability in his life. He subsequently gets a football scholarship and attends university before hitting the big time.This has plenty of scenes that raised a smile or laugh, although this is in no way a comedy film, and the best way to describe this would be as truly heart-warming. It is genuinely a feel good movie and whilst there are certain moments that seem grim for Michael, overall this is a very upbeat and positive story.The relationship between Michael and Leigh Ann (his `new' mother) is wonderful to see and you also see how helping Michael also has a positive effect on her and the whole family in turn. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as his tutor and as always she is delightful to watch, but to be honest everyone plays their roles superbly, which makes this a joy to watch.All in all, this is a great film and offers up a decent story (all the better for being real) that leaves you feeling buoyed up and positive.

1292816,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B002VECM6S,Steve Douglas,"[1, 1]","So many have given their opinions of the movie and multiple summaries of the plot so I won't bore you with another.  This is a 5 star movie, yes, but I gave it a 4 simply for the transfer to BluRay, which is what this review is about.The video transfer is simply excellent with an average Mbps rate between the mid 20's and lower 30's.  The coloration of the transfer is warm yet very realistic in skin tones, background environment and color resolution.  At no point did I see any artifacting, aliasing or stair-stepping which might have been noticeable in the crowd scenes more than any other place.  There were good details in the shadow and darker areas though most of movie takes place during daylight or well lit indoor scenes.  Because the technology of filmmaking has improved so much in recent years, you will probably not see a night and day difference between the Blu Ray and Standard Def versions( I do have the SD disc but am not using this review as a head to head comparison.  Never the less, you will see improvement in the contrast and smaller details. 5 starsThe audio is a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and this dialogue driven film delivers in clear and precise dialogue with nicely balanced levels so that you do not ever need to roller coaster your remote's volume control. Once set to the volume you want you can leave it there.  There is a big and audible difference between the lossy audio of some discs and the lossless of this and others. You really can hear the difference.  That said, most all audio on The Blind Side takes place in the front stage with some, just a few, foley effects for the left or right speakers.  Usually, this occurs when a door closes on either side of the stage.  There is no real use of the rear channels and very, very little for the LFE sub channel to use.  4 stars.There are several extras including deleted scenes, most of which would have fit nicely into an extended version, an interview with the real Michael Ohre, Quinton Aaron who plays him in the movie and also some of his friends and relatives, football coaches and a back and forth discussion between Sandra Bullock and the real Leigh Anne Tuchy.  The extras on this Blu Ray were all created in 2010 and I appreciated them all.If you do not already have The Blind Side in your collection, then, by all means, the Blu Ray is the way to go.

1292818,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B002VECM6S,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[7, 10]","If you know me well, you know that I hate football. Heck, I loathe sports in general. So you can imagine how I felt when the family unit suggested that we see THE BLIND SIDE for our annual Christmas movie night. In a way, I was curious. I mean, Sandra Bullock isn't a bad actress, and her performance in this film has been all the rage lately, so there was at least one draw for me...just one. I hate inspirational sports films. I struggled through REMEMBER THE TITANS. I barely survived all 116 minutes of RUDY. We'll just say that this was not a film that I had anticipated.And for all of my reservations, it was pretty good.See this film for Sandra Bullock's amazing performance. It is a career best, and should not be missed. She lights up the screen, playing one of the most positive Christian characters ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood film. You only ever see slanted portrayals of Christians onscreen - and no wonder - if more Christians would walk the walk and talk the talk, this would not be a problem - however, Bullock gives a performance that dismisses all of that for now, especially given the fact that we are dealing with material that is based on real situations.The film tells the true story of All American football player, Michael Oher, and the family that took him off of the streets of Memphis and adopted him. Bullock portrays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a devout Christian woman who convinces her husband to take a chance on the young black man. Being that she is a strong willed woman with a sharp tongue and a no-nonsense attitude, it's not long before shes purchasing a bed set and escorting Oher to the store to buy new clothes. She soon adopts maternal feelings for the boy, and becomes his legal guardian. She loves him just as if he is one of her own children. Michael looks after the younger kids and takes care of them, and Tuohy's youngest son becomes a permanent fixture at his side. Bullock's performance is the driving force behind the film. Her craft is impeccable. It's too bad that the film falls short dramatically at times, often resorting to Disney-esque sentiment while it abandons the harsher realities of life in favor of a family friendly PG-13 rating. Some of the minor characters come off as token caricatures, such as Kathy Bates' tutor and Michael's younger brother.Weaknesses aside, while this may not be the best film of the year, it is definitely a touching story that tries its best to keep away from the temptation to manipulate the audience emotionally - and it is because of this film that I have a renewed faith in Sandra Bullock's abilities. See it for her performance alone, if you must. The other actors aren't bad. Tim McGraw is exceptional as Tuohy's supportive, submissive husband. Then again, he has nothing on Bullock. She steals the show.A note to ""Christian filmmakers"" in the industry: take a lesson from THE BLIND SIDE. Here is a film that promotes Christian themes while avoiding the mistake of cramming a sermon down your throat. Remember, when it comes to film, we'd much rather hear a story than a sermon. If we want to hear the latter, we can go to church on Sunday. Remember, story over sermon. Anything other than that becomes propaganda. You lose 90% of your audience that way. Well, at least I start tuning you out, but that's just me.",4,BLIND SIDE surprises with an Oscar-worthy performance!,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,3309,"['know', 'well', 'know', 'hate', 'football', 'Heck', 'loathe', 'sports', 'general', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'family', 'unit', 'suggested', 'see', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'night', 'way', 'was', 'curious', 'mean', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actress', 'performance', 'film', 'been', 'rage', 'lately', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'draw', 'just', 'one', 'hate', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'films', 'struggled', 'REMEMBER', 'THE', 'TITANS', 'barely', 'survived', '116', 'minutes', 'RUDY', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'had', 'anticipated.And', 'reservations', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.See', 'film', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'amazing', 'performance', 'career', 'best', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'screen', 'playing', 'one', 'most', 'positive', 'Christian', 'characters', 'ever', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'only', 'ever', 'see', 'slanted', 'portrayals', 'Christians', 'onscreen', 'wonder', 'more', 'Christians', 'would', 'walk', 'walk', 'talk', 'talk', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'however', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'now', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', 'are', 'dealing', 'material', 'based', 'real', 'situations.The', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'football', 'player', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'family', 'took', 'streets', 'Memphis', 'adopted', 'Bullock', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'devout', 'Christian', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'take', 'chance', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'Being', 'strong', 'willed', 'woman', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'no-nonsense', 'attitude', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'shes', 'purchasing', 'bed', 'set', 'escorting', 'Oher', 'store', 'buy', 'new', 'clothes', 'soon', 'adopts', 'maternal', 'feelings', 'boy', 'legal', 'guardian', 'just', 'one', 'own', 'children', 'Michael', 'younger', 'kids', 'care', 'Tuohy', 'youngest', 'son', 'permanent', 'fixture', 'side', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'craft', 'impeccable', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'short', 'dramatically', 'times', 'often', 'resorting', 'Disney-esque', 'sentiment', 'harsher', 'realities', 'life', 'favor', 'family', 'friendly', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'minor', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'token', 'caricatures', 'such', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'tutor', 'Michael', 'younger', 'brother.Weaknesses', 'aside', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'definitely', 'touching', 'story', 'best', 'keep', 'away', 'temptation', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'film', 'have', 'renewed', 'faith', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'abilities', 'See', 'performance', 'alone', 'must', 'other', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'exceptional', 'Tuohy', 'supportive', 'submissive', 'husband', 'Then', 'again', 'nothing', 'Bullock', 'show.A', 'note', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'industry', 'take', 'lesson', 'THE', 'BLIND', 'SIDE', 'Here', 'film', 'Christian', 'themes', 'avoiding', 'mistake', 'cramming', 'sermon', 'down', 'throat', 'Remember', 'when', 'film', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'hear', 'story', 'sermon', 'want', 'hear', 'latter', 'can', 'go', 'church', 'Sunday', 'Remember', 'story', 'sermon', 'Anything', 'other', 'propaganda', 'lose', '90', '%', 'audience', 'way', 'Well', 'least', 'start', 'tuning', 'just']",N/A

1292836,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B002VECM6S,The Guardian,"[4, 5]","John Lee Hancock's excellent film tells the story of the formative years of Michael Oher, American football star player (left tackle) with the Baltimore Ravens, born on the wrong side of the tracks with a good heart but dealt a poor deal in life with no role model until he meets and is first helped by and later adopted by the (rich, white) Tuohy family in Memphis TN. It has good, pacy story development, first class editing and career-best performance form Sandra Bullock.The source material is Mike Lewis's 2006 book ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"". As is the way with screenplays, some minor liberties may have been taken with the true narrative of Michael's life with the Tuohys in order to serve the needs of a coherent drama. But the essential story is true-to-life and very well realised.Quinton Aaron puts in a fine performance as Big Mike (few actors would have the necessary size and physique for the role), and although all the leading characters are good, it's Bullock's performance as ballsy, compassionate Leigh-Anne Tuohy who drives the plot along and is its principal pro-active agency. The Oscar and Golden Globe awards for her performance were well deserved.A minor quirky detail is that musician Phil Collins' daughter Lily plays Sean and Leigh-Anne's teenage daughter in the film. Her real-life name? ""Collins.""""The Blind Side"" is not a ""sports movie"" but a film about building trust, how unlikely relationships are possible and can be very successful, and how generosity of heart and persistent commitment to someone else's success can achieve great things. The film is ""feel-good"" but in no way sentimental or schmaltzy. Its narrative drive is strong, the script sharp and clich&eacute;-free and you genuinely care about these people. It contains moments of memorable poignancy.It's hard to see how such a mediocre offering as ""The Hurt Locker"" could be awarded Best Film of 2009 by the Academy with clearly superior competition like this - but with the Academy, life is often full of surprises.See it, if you haven't already.",5,Bullock takes her role by the horns to deliver a career-best performance in a heartwarming film,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2056,"['John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'excellent', 'film', 'story', 'formative', 'years', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'American', 'football', 'star', 'player', 'left', 'tackle', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'born', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'good', 'heart', 'dealt', 'poor', 'deal', 'life', 'role', 'model', 'first', 'helped', 'later', 'adopted', 'rich', 'white', 'Tuohy', 'family', 'Memphis', 'TN', 'good', 'pacy', 'story', 'development', 'first', 'class', 'editing', 'career-best', 'performance', 'form', 'Sandra', 'Bullock.The', 'source', 'material', 'Mike', 'Lewis', '2006', 'book', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Evolution', 'Game', 'way', 'screenplays', 'minor', 'liberties', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'true', 'narrative', 'Michael', 'life', 'Tuohys', 'order', 'serve', 'needs', 'coherent', 'drama', 'essential', 'story', 'true-to-life', 'very', 'well', 'realised.Quinton', 'Aaron', 'fine', 'performance', 'Big', 'Mike', 'few', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'necessary', 'size', 'physique', 'role', 'leading', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'ballsy', 'compassionate', 'Leigh-Anne', 'Tuohy', 'who', 'plot', 'principal', 'pro-active', 'agency', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'awards', 'performance', 'were', 'well', 'deserved.A', 'minor', 'quirky', 'detail', 'musician', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'daughter', 'Lily', 'Sean', 'Leigh-Anne', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'film', 'real-life', 'name', 'Collins', 'Blind', 'Side', 'not', 'sports', 'movie', 'film', 'building', 'trust', 'how', 'unlikely', 'relationships', 'are', 'possible', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'how', 'generosity', 'heart', 'persistent', 'commitment', 'someone', 'else', 'success', 'can', 'achieve', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'feel-good', 'way', 'sentimental', 'schmaltzy', 'narrative', 'drive', 'strong', 'script', 'sharp', 'clich', 'eacute', 'genuinely', 'care', 'people', 'moments', 'memorable', 'poignancy.It', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'mediocre', 'offering', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'could', 'be', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Film', '2009', 'Academy', 'clearly', 'superior', 'competition', 'Academy', 'life', 'often', 'full', 'surprises.See', 'have', ""n't"", 'already']",N/A

Survival for this child is an uncomplaining journey to live peacefully, without anyone noticing him or bothering him.  He washes his one pair of shorts in a sink at the laundromat and dries them in another's customer's dryer.  He sleeps in the gym because that's where it is warm.  He is taken in by the school because of his size, and into a woman's home because she feels compelled to make certain he has a warm place to sleep for a night.  It is soon recognized by all that this gentle giant just wants to be loved, and so love he gets.  The best part of the story is understanding how he gets through life without bitterness or anger at the cards life dealt him:  He is following his mother's words of wisdom, though she had nothing else to give him.

I watch my fair share of ""garbage"" honestly, but there are sometimes great movies that show up seemingly out of nowhere and really surprise, The Blind Side falls into that category. In The Blind Side we meet the Tuohys, a rich American family who generously give homeless Michael Oher a home and at the same time a family. Oher does poorly in school but his size give him an advantage when it's a physical matter, especially sports. It is soon discovered that Michael has a talent for football. At first the Tuohys are only being generous but they get much more out of it than Oher does. The movie is a little about football, yet, it is not about sports. Ok, maybe a little but football isn't what the movie is about and neither is it its purpose; the main values portrayed in The Blind Side are acceptance and family; the two are things some of us lack.I'm not that big a fan of Sandra Bullock's but I have to say that she really impressed me here and delivered without a doubt, it's one of the best performances of her career. Quinton Aaron delivered an excellent performance as Michael Oher, a.k.a Big Mike, rocks solid. The supporting actors were also very good (Phil Collin's daughter has a role in it); it only adds to the enjoyment factor and it's refreshing to see a movie that was so carefully done. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie and how often I have watched it so far.  On the other hand, it's no surprise that The Blind Side has been nominated for some awards (Bullock won a deserved Academy Award for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy). There is a lot of emotional appeal and one scene in particular stands out to me. Michael enters his room and says he's never had one before, to which Leigh Anne replies: ""A bedroom to yourself?"" Michael concludes: ""No, a bed"".You may think that's a spoiler but it's not, it is almost impossible to spoil this movie and none of the reviews here on Amazon really have spoilers.I know it's just a movie and very few will get understand what I'm saying but I got a lot out of watching it. It's a remarkable movie that stands out; now wonder it's been receiving such praises so far. If you're a movie buyer I think you'll want to add this one to your movie collection, it deserves a place there. You will definitely want to share the experience that is this movie, besides; it's a nice family film too.

1292853,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002VECM6S,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","As a based-on-truth film ""The Blind Side,"" well-intentioned and uplifting as it is, falls short of a compelling drama. The true story of Michael Oher, a real-life pro football player, and Leigh Anne Tuohy, his adoptive mother, is certainly inspirational, but the film's storyline itself looks sometimes formulaic, or even predictable. But where the film lacks creativity and imagination, the star Sandra Bullock almost single-handedly makes up for them with her strong performance.It is Sandra Bullock and her Oscar-winning performance that lifts the film from being an average bio-pic to a first-class dramatic piece of work. She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a wealthy wife and mother who takes in Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a homeless boy who later becomes a Baltimore Ravens player. It is great to see what Sandra Bullock can really do. She plays the role with warmth and humor.You may say ""The Blind Side"" is a feel-good film, but for some viewers ""The Blind Side"" feels too good. Director John Lee Hancock (""The Rookie"" ""The Alamo"") forgoes opportunities to create dramatic tensions, such as Leigh Anne's decision to adopt Michael. Some episodes look out of place. Strange remarks about the ""dead bodies"" by Michael's private tutor Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) is one example. Did he really believe that?""The Blind Side"" is a good example of a film where superb acting of the star lifts the drama above the genre. This happened many times before - Richard Dreyfuss did it in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" or recently Emily Blunt in ""The Young Victoria"" - and this happened again with Sandra Bullock and her wonderful performance.",4,(3.5 STARS) Watch fpr Sandra Bullock's Strong Performance,1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,1617,"['based-on-truth', 'film', 'Blind', 'Side', 'well-intentioned', 'uplifting', 'short', 'compelling', 'drama', 'true', 'story', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'real-life', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'certainly', 'inspirational', 'film', 'storyline', 'sometimes', 'formulaic', 'even', 'predictable', 'where', 'film', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'star', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'up', 'strong', 'performance.It', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'film', 'being', 'average', 'bio-pic', 'first-class', 'dramatic', 'piece', 'work', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'wealthy', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'homeless', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'player', 'great', 'see', 'what', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'role', 'warmth', 'humor.You', 'may', 'say', 'Blind', 'Side', 'feel-good', 'film', 'viewers', 'Blind', 'Side', 'feels', 'too', 'good', 'Director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Rookie', 'Alamo', 'opportunities', 'create', 'dramatic', 'tensions', 'such', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'decision', 'adopt', 'Michael', 'episodes', 'look', 'place', 'Strange', 'remarks', 'dead', 'bodies', 'Michael', 'private', 'tutor', 'Miss', 'Sue', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'one', 'example', 'Did', 'really', 'believe', 'Blind', 'Side', 'good', 'example', 'film', 'where', 'superb', 'acting', 'star', 'drama', 'genre', 'happened', 'many', 'times', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'did', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'recently', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'happened', 'again', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'wonderful', 'performance']",N/A
1292854,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002VECM6S,Turfseer,"[41, 57]","*** This review contains spoilers ***The Blind Side is one of those movies that manages to evoke a huge difference in opinion as to whether film works or not. I'm somewhere in the middle. Certainly the saga of the White Republican Tuohy family who takes in Michael Oher, a black kid from the 'other side of the tracks', and then helps him to become what he has become today, a very successful NFL star football player, is an inspirational tale of true Christian charity. On the other hand, the story is riddled with so many clich&eacute;s that ultimately the film devolves into a predictable tale of the rise of an underprivileged youth.Some posters argue that the white characters in the film, particularly the Tuohy family themselves, come off as saintly and the black characters are all presented as negative stereotypes. I don't see that at all. For starters, the first black character we meet, 'Big Tony' Hamilton, is a self-sufficient and kindly man who ends up being responsible for getting Big Mike into the Wingate Christian school where he eventually thrives. Leigh Anne Tuohy is hardly a saint as she is depicted as sensitive but also a thoroughly pushy and sometimes obnoxious woman who is capable at times, of putting her foot in her mouth. While Michael Oher is a slow learner, the film makes it quite clear that he has street smarts and inherently is a lot smarter than what the teachers at the Wingate school pegged him to be. Unfortunately, the film's scenarists know a lot more about Leigh Anne Tuohy's personality than Michael Oher's. This is perhaps the major shortcoming of the film as the warm, winning ways of Oher are not shown here; rather, he's depicted as thoroughly introverted and socially inept and rookie actor Quinton Aaron is unable to make much of a part that is quite thin to begin with.The first third of the movie is perhaps the most moving as it shows Leigh Anne's Tuohy's growing realization that she has led an isolated life. In a most poignant scene, Tuohy is startled when Michael reveals that he's never slept in a bed before. Leigh Anne's willingness to take Michael in is tested in the scene involving the car accident. After Sean Tuohy Sr. buys Michael a new car, he gets into a car accident while the the young SJ is in the passenger seat. Somehow all is forgiven when it's revealed that Michael prevents the full force of the air bag from hitting SJ. Never discussed are the events preceding the crash--Michael and SJ are engaged in singing a rap song without Michael paying attention to the traffic ahead of them. I also wondered if Leigh Anne would have forgiven Michael so easily had SJ actually been seriously injured in the accident or even killed. Christian charity I suppose has its limits!Once Oher is acclimated to his new family, 'The Blind Side' picks up the Hollywood mantle and offers up another tired and long-winded high school football scene, replete with the young SJ obnoxiously 'coaching' Oher before the big game along with Leigh Anne later fending off the token white racist in the stands. Oher not only gains confidence as a defensive tackle but the big teddy bear flips an opposing player over a fence after the bully has been mocking him before every play (how cute!).Again, the second half of 'The Bind Side' ends up with mixed results. There's more 'cute' stuff when Leigh Anne hires a tutor (Kathy Bates) who tutors Michael to get his grade point average high enough to qualify for college. Liberal Hollywood needs to let us know that the tutor is a Democrat so that both conservative Republicans (the Tuohy family) and a Democrat both have a hand in helping Michael reach his goal. There's a stab at comedy when all the college recruiters start courting Michael and again the obnoxious child actor who plays SJ attempts to get the 'best deal' for himself in the event that Michael is recruited (stuff like walking out on the field at the beginning of the college football season).When an NCAA Investigator questions the Tuohy family's motives in 'adopting' Michael after he accepts an invitation to attend Ole Miss, Michael impulsively returns to his old ghetto haunts. There he's taunted by Alton, the head gang member, brilliantly played by IronE Singleton (this actor has the potential to be a major star!) Michael gets into a fight with Alton and gets the better of him and then disappears. Leigh Anne looks high and low for Michael and confronts Alton. Some posters say the scene is implausible since the gang member would have retaliated when Leigh Anne challenged him. I'm not so sure--when she claims that she's friends with the DA, that in itself might have given Alton pause to take revenge. After all, he's a drug dealer who doesn't want any outsiders calling attention to his business. Finally Leigh Anne finds Michael after he calls her. There's a reconciliation and Michael is cleared by the NCAA after they finally accept his explanation that his decision to go to Ole Miss was made on his own free will. Of course Michael goes on to graduate from high school and is drafted by the NFL.Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of conveying the brash personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. Tim McGraw as Sean Sr. and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy have little to do during the film. As previously mentioned, the youngster SJ (played by Jae Head) is simply obnoxious and Quinton Aaron does not know how to make Michael Oher into an engaging character. As 'The Blind Side' is based on a true story, it certainly is worth watching. Just don't expect much complexity when it comes to the majority of its characters.",3,Average Hollywood treatment of true life tale of Christian charity,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,5590,"['***',

Not only is it good drama and even inspiring, Sandra Bullock (The Proposal, Crash, Miss Congeniality) is to die for. She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a real-life, very high-mainteance, incredibly focused, tenacious wife, mother and interior designer, living a very wealthy lifestyle with her family in Memphis, Tennessee. One fateful rainy night, the family meets and decides to help a young, homeless black student from their children's private Christian school. He is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), future All-American and first round NFL draft pick; but at the time, an introverted, poor student with only two qualities that might possibly help him to become a football player: his size and his protective instincts. Leigh Anne, with the help of husband Sean (Tim McGraw), son S.J. (Jae Head) and daughter Collins (Lily Collins), along with coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), help Michael to see his potential and use it to become, not only a talented football player, but a good student and an honorable man. So that, by the end of the film, he has coaches from all over the South vying for his recruitment.This is a true story, based on the book by Michael Lewis (The Blind Side: Evolution Of A Game), and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Alamo, Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, A Perfect World), who also co-wrote the screenplay with Lewis. Country music recording artist Tim McGraw is enjoyable as good-natured husband Sean, and also does the soundtrack. But Sandra Bullock steals the film. I know how good she is because I grew up in a Southern family with interior designers, and they're all high-maintenance, focused and tenacious like that. What makes Bullock's character extraordinary is the courage, heart and vision she adds to those qualities. But she never smiles... until the end of the film, and it's a classic moment. Another terrific scene is when the coaches from different universities are looking at a video of Oher blocking an opposing player that has been antagonizing him all game, and pushing him all the way down the field, into the end zone and over the fence. That's just one of the many times you'll laugh and cry simultaneously. This movie makes me glad there is still a movie industry.

Well -- for me, anyway, the reality was a little different.The young actor playing teen-ager Michael Oher, Quinton Aaron, may have only been playing the part the way he saw it -- but he seems to have as much acting ability as a huge block of coal. Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, the husband and father in the white family, spends a lot of his time doing whatever his wife tells him and marveling at how lucky he was to get her.But it is Sandra Bullock, the wife Leigh Anne Tuohy, who really spoils this movie for me. With long, flowing blonde hair (dyed for the part), and a series of fanny-flattering straight skirts and tight slacks, she is certainly pleasing to look at -- until she opens her mouth. To put it mildly, her nickname could fittingly have been ""Momma Sass.""Momma orders her family around, tells football coaches how to do their job, does a ""shamey-shamey"" white guilt trip on her female friends when they suggest that having a young black man living with her family that includes a teen-age daughter might not be just the wisest thing to do, and is in general just too insufferably cocky and bumptious for my taste. She even talks trash to a group of black gang members in a public housing project where she has gone to look for the missing Michael -- and gets away with it. I'm amazed she was not shown doing a rap song she had improvised on the spot -- she can seemingly do everything else. The only person in the movie allowed to out-sass Momma and leave her without a snappy comeback is a fat, black female office manager at a license branch. Is anyone surprised?Oher's scenes with the Tuohys' young son are mildly charming -- one of the few bright spots, in my estimation. But those bright spots are all too few.Golden Globe for Bullock as best actress? OK -- that was their decision to make. To paraphrase something Harry Truman once said, ""I didn't give it to her."" Way, way too much cocksureness -- and practically none of the blowback she would get from the people she's ordering around and smart-mouthing, if this was real life. I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them for a good movie.

The focus is not (as I had hoped) on Michael Oher overcoming his tragic and traumatic upbringing with the help of a kind and loving family.No. The focus was on how the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock) was a kind and heroic woman determined to do the right thing, even when everyone else (her Husband, her friends, the coach, Michael's friends) were busy being stupid jerks.We're supposed to overlook the fact that the woman dominates the whole town and that everyone else either meekly complies or gets run over in her crusade to always be right about everything. We're supposed to approve of this woman threatening to shoot anyone who threatens her son.Maybe we're supposed to be ignorant of what Jesus taught in Matthew 5:5 ""'Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.'"" or Matthew 26:52, ""'Put your sword back in its place,' Jesus said to him, 'for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.'"".I have nothing against women in the role of leadership.

The movie was fine until she starts ranting around with her forced southern draw, after that its really just hard to take her seriously. I was a fan of her when she was cute and funny, but her more serious roles, notably Crash, and Premonition just left a bad taste in my mouth. Someone like Robin Williams is a genius and basically can tackle any roll you give him funny or serious. Drama just isn't Sandras thing, i know the movie doesnt revolve around her, but Big Mike is actually a better actor than her(for a drama) and he rarely speaks. So its pretty basic, and yes predictable as most have said, plus i'm not an underdog can rise to the top if he puts his mind to it kind of movie fan, just Rockys thats about it. When it comes to Good Will Hunting, Finding Forester, and even Rudy they just pretty much all try and achieve the same goal which gets monotonous. Also i'm not a football fan(just my local home teams), so thats another reason its not my thing. Not saying its horrid by any means, but in my opinion i just don't like that the cast or the story.

McEwen ""Wisdom falls in between the...","[14, 59]","Pay attention America because this is what we have become.Disclaimer: Due to the unpopularity of this movie review let it be said that a movie review is not an accusation or a personal snide comment directed toward any person, note, or form; it is simply an opinion. I would never have watched this movie if I didn't think it had a good message. Actors and message aside, I am digging deeper into the well and trying to find some water of sustenance; and though I regret some of the things I write, I am trying to get to the heart of truth. Everyone who goes in search of doing good shall always be blessed in the heart and spirit and that is why this movie has been so popular; I am simply lamenting the overlay of fakeness in which it was presented; the reality seems so far from what I have glimpsed; so hopefully, after that, this will cover at least a bit of something. An explane' if you will.Sometimes the only sense of happiness comes in split rotation forms of music and movies; snippets of greatness fed piecemeal into my psyche; little pieces of warmth or rather fits of cold fusion that wraps my warped and weary soul with a molecular coat of sustenance patting down the hairs of my soul and petting me into a comatose slack jawed sense of familiarity letting me know that at least in some corners of the universe I am not completely and entirely alone; I am not the only one who looks around and says, What the **** has happened here? - - and then the realization that there is no solution.I made the tragic mistake of thinking there might be some piece of this comfort resting within the confines of this movie, excuse me, commercial. And in making this mistake I seem to have mistakenly given over a part of myself to trying to make sense in what America seems to hold up to the light and applaud. Not only applaud but gather around, hold up as of mortals worshipping Gods; and I must freely admit that this idea of heralding such blatant materialism and juvenile quest to the finish line touch downs yellow flags and all; quite simply makes me ill. Not ill as in I fear there is a chill in the room and I may sense a fever coming on. Ill in the sense that I look around and see so much fake and plastic being passed off as real; ill in the sense that this very movie is such a great lie. The only real part of it being the essay written by Mike, entitled, ""white walls."" A moment of clarity interrupts the fake and plastic and inserts itself for a few scarce moments.Compare this commercial to something like say, ""Doubt,"" ""Precious,"" or ""The Hurt Locker,"" and where does it stand? Way over in the corner looking out the window and hoping that mum is on the way to the circular drive and wondering what's for dinner. Because the reality is that this is a joke. It is a sick sinister joke. Turning the ever well oiled wheels of the illusion that if you run fast and hit hard and throw the ball just right then the contract and the endorsements are just abatements holding the line until you maybe or maybe not quite graduate from high school and run out into the open arms of the fake and the plastic; but the cheering crowds will reward the players all the same; this is Rome, after all.So, go on and get yer game on. Go on and slap some ass and work on flattening out that southern drawl until it sounds as monotone and as void of any feeling as the very mouth it is coming out from. Spew. Spew. Spew. Spew the monochrome into the ominous void and - touch down, we have a winner. Sadly, there are so many schools containing teaching lounges just like this one, and sadly, it will never change. Just watch the teacher who holds up an essay like, ""white walls,"" and then take a step back and back and back and walk right out the door because that's exactly where the job will take you. Was there a mission statement written into the dialogue around here somewhere? And how dare I pare down and split open something so juicy as a watching a barbie doll try to push herself into a reality that she will never understand? What's wrong with me and why don't I just get with the program? - - Come on already.I think I'll opt out of the plan. And I'd suggest to parents who want their children to grow up not as products, but as real people who think real thoughts, to abstain and go in search of a good book. Or maybe write an essay on the violent nature of football and it's ever enforced violent nature of the crowds and the illness that takes over and inserts itself into people's psyches; write an essay examining why it's okay for someone who looks great in color coordinated outfits to cut in front of the line and sass talk the workers; just because it looks good. I think of the movie, ""Precious,"" and the reassurance that there are real writers out there - Sapphire - who dare to write the truth and then someone comes along and makes it into a movie; these are the moments my soul climbs into in order to breathe, in order to go up and on and face the great American void; in order to be able to write the truth about this movie which is in no uncertain terms;

Saavedra,"[0, 1]","A beautifully told story that seems to be true and accurate, but notice the subtle stories intertwined in the main story?First, there is the story about the father, owner of a multitude of fast food restaurants, who is so abundantly reaping the financial rewards of his ownership that he and his family can live a life in extremely grand style. What about his employees that are doing the work, providing the service, maintaining the properties, how are they living? How are they paid? (And yes, I know the mother seemed to be doing work for financial gain too and that also contributed to their financial success.)Secondly, note the harsh, negative presentation of the NAACP representative. Possibly it was accurate, but also it is good that someone was questioning what happened to this young, talented neglected boy. Too many poor children have been taken into custody to then be used as servants for their caretakers, so bravo there are representatives from the NAACP and other similar organizations that are checking things out and hopefully they aren't brow beating the children as was shown in this portrayal.All in all it is a movie worth seeing as long as one doesn't let their Blind Sides negatively affect you.",4,"A great story with a couple big, subtle drawbacks",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1221,"['beautifully', 'told', 'story', 'be', 'true', 'accurate', 'notice', 'subtle', 'stories', 'intertwined', 'main', 'story', 'First', 'story', 'father', 'owner', 'multitude', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'who', 'so', 'abundantly', 'reaping', 'financial', 'rewards', 'ownership', 'family', 'can', 'live', 'life', 'extremely', 'grand', 'style', 'What', 'employees', 'are', 'doing', 'work', 'providing', 'service', 'maintaining', 'properties', 'how', 'are', 'living', 'How', 'are', 'paid', 'yes', 'know', 'mother', 'seemed', 'be', 'doing', 'work', 'financial', 'gain', 'too', 'also', 'contributed', 'financial', 'success', 'Secondly', 'note', 'harsh', 'negative', 'presentation', 'NAACP', 'representative', 'Possibly', 'was', 'accurate', 'also', 'good', 'someone', 'was', 'questioning', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'talented', 'neglected', 'boy', 'Too', 'many', 'poor', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'custody', 'then', 'be', 'used', 'servants', 'caretakers', 'so', 'are', 'representatives', 'NAACP', 'other', 'similar', 'organizations', 'are', 'checking', 'things', 'out', 'hopefully', 'are', ""n't"", 'brow', 'beating', 'children', 'was', 'shown', 'portrayal.All', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'as', 'long', 'one', ""n't"", 'let', 'Blind', 'Sides', 'negatively', 'affect']",N/A
1292876,AP3B615GM191G,B002VECM6S,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 6]","I made the decision to watch this film for two reasons: One, because I am a football fan, and two, because I like film dramas.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommended to anyone, it focuses much more on the ""human drama"" angle and very little on the actual football.For a basic plot summary, ""The Blind Side"" tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is adopted by Leigh Anne & Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw) and given a respite from life in ""the projects"".  A giant of a boy, Michael shows an aptitude for football, learning, and family values under the guidance of the Tuohys, and eventually obtains both a college education and a shot at football's biggest stage--the NFL.Because this is a movie based on a true story, it is tough to know how much of it is actually true.  As a sports fan who closely follows the NFL, I know that Mr. Oher himself is uncomfortable talking about the film (or, more specifically, his portrayal in it), so perhaps some liberties were indeed taken to make for a juicier storyline.That being said, this production (for better or worse) is a strong, emotional, human-interest drama that will both warm your heart and make you think.  Though the basic concepts and characters are ""vanilla"" enough for even younger children to grasp, the more over-arching themes can easily be picked out by adults and thought upon.  The acting also helps accomplish this goal, as the entire cast shines in their respective roles.About the only thing that prevents me from giving this film the full five stars is that I felt it could have devoted a bit more time to the ""football side"" of things (ala the Michael Lewis book).  If done correctly, this movie could have been a sort of ""Social Network"", but for the NFL.  Instead, to create a more family-friendly film, the production eschews all but a few mentions of actual football.Overall, this is a charming film that is appropriate for anyone.  Though not quite ""gritty"" enough to be an outright classic, there is something to be said for its saccharine approach to film-making.

1292878,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002VECM6S,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","My husband and I finally got around to watching ""The Blind Side"" tonight and I'm glad we did - this is truly a heartfelt and inspiring movie with not only a stellar performance by Sandra Bullock, who is truly deserving of her Oscar, but also incredible performances by the rest of the main cast. Based on the true experiences of Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) and Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), the story is credibly portrayed without sinking into over-the-top sappiness. This is partly helped by the matter-of-fact manner in which the story is told - there are no overly long melodramatic scenes, and all the crucial plot points move along at an adequate pace.The stand-out performance is definitely by Sandra Bullock who is perfectly cast as the plain-talking, at times acerbic, but always having her heart in the right place Leigh Anne Tuohy. Her compassionate nature shines through every action - an outpouring of love without any expectations whatsoever. Her family rallies around in supporting Leigh Anne's decision to embrace Michael as one of their own - and I particularly enjoyed the antics of Sean and Leigh Anne's young son who develops a close brotherly bond with Michael. The touching family scenes are nicely balanced with the football scenes, be it training (loved it when Leigh Anne takes matters into her own hands during a training session that is not going particularly well), or an actual game.My husband initially expressed some cynicism about this movie (prior to watching it) - he was concerned that the movie would be more of a cliche given the themes of class and race, but after watching it, we both agreed that ""The Blind Side"" is no cliche - it is truly a heartfelt, inspiring, family-friendly drama that emphasizes the virtues of compassion, civic responsibility, and the pure, abiding love of ""family"".",5,Uplifting and inspiring,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,1845,"['husband', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Blind', 'Side', 'tonight', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'truly', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'also', 'incredible', 'performances', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'Based', 'true', 'experiences', 'Michael', 'Oher', 'played', 'Quinton', 'Aaron', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'story', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'sinking', 'over-the-top', 'sappiness', 'partly', 'helped', 'matter-of-fact', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'are', 'overly', 'long', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'crucial', 'plot', 'points', 'move', 'along', 'adequate', 'pace.The', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'definitely', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'plain-talking', 'times', 'acerbic', 'always', 'having', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'Tuohy', 'compassionate', 'nature', 'shines', 'action', 'outpouring', 'love', 'expectations', 'whatsoever', 'family', 'supporting', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'decision', 'embrace', 'Michael', 'one', 'own', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'antics', 'Sean', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'close', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'Michael', 'touching', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'football', 'scenes', 'be', 'training', 'loved', 'when', 'Leigh', 'Anne', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'training', 'session', 'not', 'going', 'particularly', 'well', 'actual', 'game.My', 'husband', 'initially', 'expressed', 'cynicism', 'movie', 'prior', 'watching', 'was', 'concerned', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'cliche', 'given', 'themes', 'class', 'race', 'watching', 'agreed', 'Blind', 'Side', 'cliche', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'inspiring', 'family-friendly', 'drama', 'virtues', 'compassion', 'civic', 'responsibility', 'pure', 'abiding', 'love', 'family']",N/A
