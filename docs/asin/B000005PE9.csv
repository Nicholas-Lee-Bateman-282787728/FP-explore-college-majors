491963,A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B000005PE9,"AF ""Whigs""","[0, 0]","First, this is a very good, simplified, child-friendly version of The Hobbit.  That's not to say that it's dumbed down, it's just not too scary.  Overall, it's a very good adaptation that covers the high points without too many quibbles about what was left out.There are a few things I don't like about this version:  the wood elves look like The Grinch (which makes no sense, given what they look like in LOTR), the Elf King has a heavy Germanic accent (which is just an odd choice, but none of the other elves show this trait), Smaug's head looks like a cat head more than a dragon, and I'm not a fan of the voice used for Smaug.  I can't recall the actor, but a British actor would've suited him better, IMO.  The music, overall, is pretty good, but it's very dated.  When I say ""pretty good"" I mean that it's something from my childhood, so I'm probably more tolerant of it than others might be, but the tunes  run the gamut from sappy/cheesey ballads to light 70s disco funk.  Your mileage may vary.Now, for the DVD.  There are several places where the sound & video skips...SKIPS!...and parts of lines are either repeated or missed.  This is obviously inexcusable.  I don't care how much they're charging for this, how hard is it to PAY ATTENTION when you're making a video transfer?  I also had the record set of this story when I was a kid, but I don't recall the difference in sound effects that other reviews are mentioning.  Overall it's a pretty shoddy effort, as far as a video transfer.

491964,A3CDG6F1JKU0W1,B000005PE9,Alanna Evans,"[13, 14]","Rankin and Bass had the fantasy animation niche cornered and perfected in the late 70s/early 80s with a string of excellent animated flicks including adaptions of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Flight of Dragons&quot;.  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; however was probably the most ambitious considering that so many people love and have read J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpieces multiple times over and his fans are sticklers for detail.  Luckily the script for this adaption is savagely faithful to original story and with the simplistic animation which does have alot of movement, beauty and a charm of its own, the book really comes to life on the small screen.This movie along with the other two I mentioned above were not blatantly family friendly, containing some intense moments that put it in a seperate league from the watered down cliched animated fare released nowadays which seems created more to annoy parents than to try and capture their interest to.  As an adult I still enjoy this movie and it makes a nice flick to watch to tide one over until the live action big budget movies start to come out starting in 2001.Still think all animation is just for children?

491967,A1XSW26YGZB1X6,B000005PE9,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","In light of Peter Jackson's triple triumph with the Lord of the Rings, much renewed criticism now appears to be surfacing regarding the Ralph Bakhshi and Rankin-Bass cartoon adaptations.  While Bakhshi was never able to complete his particular vision and Rankin-Bass only ever adapted ""The Hobbit"" and ""Return of the King,"" these particular works should at least be evaluated on their own merits.Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit"" is, for my money, the best of the lot.  While it of course simplifies much of the story, the essential elements are all there: Bilbo's professional recruitment by Gandalf and the dwarves, the encounter with the trolls and the acquisition of Sting, Elrond's translation of the moon letters, the run-in with the orcs, the finding of the ring and the riddle-game with Gollum, the dwarves' rescue from the burning tree by the eagles, Gandalf's departure, the spiders of Mirkwood, imprisonment by the wood-elves and Bilbo's unique rescue method, Lake-Town, the opening of the secret door, Bilbo's audience with Smaug, Smaug's raging escape and vengeance upon Lake-Town, the thrush's message to Bard and the slaying of Smaug, Thorin's defiance, the Battle of Five Armies, Thorin's deathbed realization, and Bilbo's return home to publish ""There And Back Again.""  Classic lines like ""adventures make one late for dinner,"" ""We hates it forever,"" ""Go now and speed well,"" and ""'till your eyries receive you at the journey's end"" are all retained in their proper places.  So it's not as though we've been duped into watching a radically different story.In fact one of the film's greatest strengths is in its faithful adaptation of many of Tolkien's lyrics, to include ""The Road Goes Ever Ever On,"" the elves' ""Tra-la-la-lalley"" and ""Rollin' Down the Hole,"" the orcs' ""You Go, My Lad"" and ""Fifteen Birds,"" and the men with ""At The Mountain King's Return.""  The single best song comes right in the prologue, with the dwarves' passionate ""Far O'er the Misty Mountains Cold"" becoming a recurring musical signature throughout the film.  Just as pervasive (unfortunately) is Glenn Yarborough's annoying ""The Greatest Adventure"" theme song.Where the Tolkien purists get annoyed is with the omissions and the scaling-down of some story elements.  To list a few: the entire ""Unexpected Party"" chapter is condensed into a single visit, and Gandalf's presentation of Thror's map and key to Thorin is swapped out, to instead take place in the trolls' cave.  The Rivendell scenes are over with in less than four minutes.  Gollum and Bilbo exchange a whopping 2 riddles each, with the rest of the scene stretched out by creepy music.  Beorn is omitted entirely, gone the way of Tom Bombadil --the eagles rescue the dwarves from the burning tree and take them straight to the edge of Mirkwood.  The sudden transition from spider-battle to the capture of the dwarves by the wood-elves is awkward and not given much explanation; although voice-overs by Bilbo do help somewhat.  Similarly, the ""Barrels Out Of Bond"" chapter is condensed into a single song, which leads almost without pause straight into the dwarves' washing ashore at Lake-Town.  Likewise, Bilbo's only has the one encounter with Smaug, and there is no explanation given for the thrush's ability to be understood by Bard.  The Arkenstone subplot is omitted entirely, and only the barest mention of Dain's army's arrival from the Iron Hills is made --casual viewers will likely miss this moment and end up wondering how thirteen dwarves suddenly turned into hundreds.  However most of these omissions and condensations are forgivable as they would otherwise slow up the pace of the story and lose the attention of the eight-to-twelve year-old audience for which it is intended.What is less forgivable are a very few outright plot changes: I never cared for the artists' depiction of the wood-elves --they look very sinister and not at all noble or beautiful.  Gandalf gives every indication of having guessed the nature of Bilbo's invisibility almost from the moment Bilbo is reunited with the party after his escape from Gollum.  Likewise Gandalf has some very forced added-in lines at the very end of the story that lay the groundwork for Lord of the Rings, suggesting that he already knows full well what the ring is and what is to come.  A blatant rewrite comes at the end of the Battle of Five Armies, where Gandalf says only six of the original thirteen dwarves survived --we even see Bombur's death scene!  In Tolkien's story, the only casualties of the original thirteen were Thorin, Fili, and Kili.  This for me is the most annoying aspect of the film --there was absolutely no reason to have increased the ""body count"" in this way.Keeping in mind that Rankin-Bass intended ""The Hobbit"" for the pre-teen set, this is a perfectly acceptable rendition and I would certainly recommend watching it with your children.  Some of the orc (goblin) scenes and certainly Smaug and the spiders might be a little too intense for kids under six, but as with all such films, it should be a parent's judgement call.  As a youngster this cartoon was what frankly got me hooked into Tolkien's world, and there is evidence that it is now doing so with some members of the next generation who aren't yet old enough to see the Peter Jackson films.  Need more proof?  Thanks to this movie, my eight year-old son is now writing himself into Hobbit fan fiction!",4,The best of the lot...pre-Peter Jackson,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,5408,"['light', 'Peter', 'Jackson',

491973,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B000005PE9,Arch Stanton,"[1, 1]","Anyone who didn't see this movie as a child is likely to have a different reaction to this film. It is really rather cheesy and has some odd quirks. Whether you find them charming or not will likely depend on how old you were when you first saw it. I was fortunate enough to see it as a kid so I love it. A few of the oddities: When characters die they get a shocked expression and then twirl around into the distance. There is no blood and no body. The characters are very over-dramatic and make load pronouncements. They also include a great deal of singing, both songs of Tolkien's making and of their own.The main characters are quite distinctive and memorable. Bilbo is played to perfection by Orson Bean. He's a quiet man who often narrates his own story. He sounds suitably stick-in-the-mud. His character design is unusual and he looks very distinctive from the dwarves. He's rather soft and circular while they're blocky and angular. Gandalf is played by the great John Huston. I know him as a director but he has a wonderfully commanding voice. His Gandalf is actually a little too powerful. When you see him inThe Return of the Kingyou realize that while it works perfectly for the Hobbit it limits him greatly in the other books. He can disappear at will, basically teleports from one place to another, and can apparently summon the sun. He's beyond danger. He seems to know exactly what's going to happen in the future including the nature of the ring. It fits well here like I said, and that's what's important. The other film isn't even worth seeing. Thorin is wonderfully confident and proud. All the dwarves have deep and somewhat unusual voices. Balin and Bombur are the two that really stand out. The rest of the dwarves are really only background extras. Most of them don't even have spoken lines. Gollum is wonderful. He seems suitably crazy and dangerous although he's less quick and wiry than I imagine him to be. He looks rather more like he could overpower Bilbo than outmaneuver him. Smaug is played by Richard Boone in a very angry and animalistic performance that, as much as I love it, is probably out of character for the silver-tongued worm. He's a surprisingly mammalian-looking dragon with fur and everything. Elrond is bearded oddly enough, but you can tell he's an elf because he has a halo. It is a little odd. Something that I actually didn't notice until I thought about it is that everyone speaks with an American accent. You get so engrossed in the performances that you just don't notice. It doesn't stand out at all. The only people who don't sound American are the woodelves. They have some strange foreign accent that is quite strange. Their design is odd too. They look like green, segmented, lumpen beings.The animation style is unique. I've never seen anything quite like it. The backgrounds are watercolors, which couldn't possibly represent reality but are beautiful nonetheless. It's a limited and cheap animation with a great deal of repetitive motions and animation saving motionlessness. Depending on how you look at it it's either charming or cheap. Either way it's distinctive. Certainly it's better than the overanimation ofLord of the Rings. The use of the ring is done well. When Bilbo puts it on he doesn't vanish but turns almost invisible so the audience can see him but nobody else can. I don't know how else they could show it without confusing the audience. The colors are generally dull earth tones but they make it fit with the world. The music is a delight, although again it helps to have seen it as a child. A lot of the singing is quite cheesy.A lot of the storytelling is wonderful. They set up Bilbo's longing for adventure wonderfully in the opening titles as he dreams he's a rich king in the dwarf kingdom having samples of his treasure brought to him. Later on they zoom out to see endless echoing caverns during the riddles with Gollum which sets up the lonely isolation better than anything else could. My favorite moment in the whole film is when Bilbo climbs a tree in Mirkwood and looks out over the world giving a view of Bag's End far far away which sets up the mood perfectly. At 77 minutes there isn't enough time for everything. Beorn is skipped entirely as is the setup in the beginning. The Battle of Five Armies is rather brief too. It will be a great deal of fun seeing what Peter Jackson does with all this when he makes his version. I really hope that there is something comparable when Bilbo climbs the tree.So that's the film. If you've got any nostalgia for this film then you'll probably not be disappointed to see it again. It's exactly like I remember it being when I was a kid. I can't wait to see the live action adaptation but I doubt it will remove my nostalgia for this film, although I may see aspects of it in a new light.",5,You Really Have to Grow Up With It...,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,4827,"['Anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'child', 'likely', 'have', 'different', 'reaction', 'film', 'really', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'odd', 'quirks', 'find', 'charming', 'not', 'will', 'likely', 'depend', 'how', 'old', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'kid', 'so', 'love', 'few', 'oddities', 'When', 'characters', 'die', 'get', 'shocked', 'expression', 'then', 'twirl', 'around', 'distance', 'blood', 'body', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'over-dramatic', 'make', 'load', 'pronouncements', 'also', 'include', 'great', 'deal', 'singing', 'songs', 'Tolkien', 'making', 'own.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'distinctive', 'memorable', 'Bilbo', 'played', 'perfection', 'Orson', 'Bean', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'often', 'own', 'story', 'suitably', 'stick-in-the-mud', 'character', 'design', 'unusual', 'very', 'distinctive', 'dwarves', 'rather', 'soft', 'circular', ""'re"", 'blocky', 'angular', 'Gandalf', 'played', 'great', 'John', 'Huston', 'know', 'director', 'wonderfully', 'commanding', 'voice', 'Gandalf', 'actually', 'little', 'too', 'powerful', 'When', 'see', 'inThe', 'Return', 'Kingyou', 'realize', 'perfectly', 'Hobbit', 'greatly', 'other', 'books', 'can', 'disappear', 'will', 'basically', 'one', 'place', 'can', 'apparently', 'summon', 'sun', 'danger', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'future', 'including', 'nature', 'ring', 'well', 'here', 'said', 'what', 'important', 'other', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Thorin', 'wonderfully', 'confident', 'proud', 'dwarves', 'have', 'deep', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'voices', 'Balin', 'Bombur', 'are', 'two', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'dwarves', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'background', 'extras', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'spoken', 'lines', 'Gollum', 'wonderful', 'suitably', 'crazy', 'dangerous', 'less', 'quick', 'wiry', 'imagine', 'be', 'rather', 'more', 'could', 'overpower', 'Bilbo', 'outmaneuver', 'Smaug', 'played', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'very', 'angry', 'animalistic', 'performance', 'that', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'probably', 'character', 'silver-tongued', 'worm', 'surprisingly', 'mammalian-looking', 'dragon', 'fur', 'everything', 'Elrond', 'bearded', 'oddly', 'enough', 'can', 'tell', 'elf', 'halo', 'little', 'odd', 'Something', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'thought', 'everyone', 'American', 'accent', 'get', 'so', 'engrossed', 'performances', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'American', 'are', 'woodelves', 'have', 'strange', 'foreign', 'accent', 'quite', 'strange', 'design', 'odd', 'too', 'look', 'green', 'segmented', 'lumpen', 'beings.The', 'animation', 'style', 'unique', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'watercolors', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'represent', 'reality', 'are', 'beautiful', 'nonetheless', 'limited', 'cheap', 'animation', 'great', 'deal', 'repetitive', 'motions', 'animation', 'saving', 'motionlessness', 'Depending', 'how', 'look', 'charming', 'cheap', 'way', 'distinctive', 'Certainly', 'better', 'overanimation', 'ofLord', 'Rings', 'use', 'ring', 'done', 'well', 'When', 'Bilbo', ""n't"", 'vanish', 'almost', 'invisible', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'show', 'confusing', 'audience', 'colors', 'are', 'generally', 'dull', 'earth', 'tones', 'make', 'fit', 'world', 'music', 'delight', 'again', 'have', 'seen', 'child', 'lot', 'singing', 'quite', 'cheesy.A', 'lot', 'storytelling', 'wonderful', 'set', 'up', 'Bilbo', 'longing', 'adventure', 'wonderfully', 'opening', 'titles', 'rich', 'king', 'dwarf', 'kingdom', 'having', 'samples', 'treasure', 'brought', 'Later', 'zoom', 'out', 'see', 'endless', 'echoing', 'caverns', 'riddles', 'Gollum', 'up', 'lonely', 'isolation', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'favorite', 'moment', 'whole', 'film', 'when', 'Bilbo', 'tree', 'Mirkwood', 'out', 'world', 'giving', 'view', 'Bag', 'End', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'up', 'mood', 'perfectly', '77', 'minutes', 'there', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'everything', 'Beorn', 'skipped', 'entirely', 'setup', 'beginning', 'Battle', 'Five', 'Armies', 'rather', 'brief', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'seeing', 'what', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'when', 'version', 'really', 'hope', 'something', 'comparable', 'when', 'Bilbo', 'tree.So', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'see', 'again', 'exactly', 'remember', 'being', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'live', 'action', 'adaptation', 'doubt', 'will', 'remove', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'may', 'see', 'aspects', 'new', 'light']",N/A

491982,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000005PE9,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","Even after I saw the recent 2012 version, I still felt this animated one from the 70s was better.First, I'll bring up the DVD issues that others have raised. I did encounter some problems with the DVD. It does skip in a few places. (Such as when Bard of Laketown presents himself to the dwarves.) Slightly annoying, yes. But nothing that really hampers the enjoyment of the film. Not seriously anyway.The other complaint people raised is that sometimes the whole image is dark, and it's hard to make out what's happening. This was true when I played it on a standard DVD player. But when I put it on my upgrader, the image was much better.Onto the material at hand.The main reason I prefer this version is because this 1977 animated version sticks to the story of what ""The Hobbit"" is. The new 2012 version has tried to make this story into a ""Lord of the Rings"" saga full of war. ""The Hobbit"" was more the story of a Hobbit's journey that involved SOME violence.I'd rather not go through a whole synopsis. Chances are that if you are on this site, you probably already know the story.But I will say that this 1 1/2 hour (maybe a little less) film captures the story in a most beautiful manner. We have Bilbo's somewhat forced journey to help the dwarves reclaim a treasure they consider theirs. Gandalf is certainly heroic and benevolent. But he hasn't quite become the Christ like figure he will eventually become in ""The Two Towers."" The dwarves are great in their roles as 'supposed good guys.' But we are allowed to wonder. They seem to manipulate poor Bilbo a lot, even where matters 'not in the original bargain' are concerned. And they are quick to forget about certain bargains.(IE The men of LakeTown help Thorin, feed him and his friends; and they 'trust to his gratitude.' Biblo flushes out Smaug trying to help the dwarves get their gold back; in a rage Smaug burns LakeTown; later Bard tells the dwarves that Laketown has been destroyed and must be rebuilt, and that they can thank him by sharing their fortune; and the dwarves aren't so gracious. Never mind the fact that Smaug destroyed LakeTown as a result of the dwarves trying to get their gold.) What a contrast how the dwarves refuse to share. And when Bilbo entered Smaug's cave, Smaug says: ""Well thief, I smell you, I feel your air, and I hear your breath. Go on. Help yourself. There's plenty and to spare.""Even poor Smaug isn't so 2D if we think about it. He had left the people in LakeTown alone for many years.

(Be the narration from Gandalf or Bilbo.)Also, the voices are so perfect. Orson Bean is the sweet and innocent Bilbo Baggins; John Huston is great as the heroic and benevolent, but not quite yet the Christ like Gandalf; Otto Preminger is memorable as the Elf King; Richard Boone is convincing as the dangerous, but possibly not all evil Smaug; and John Stephenson seems well suited for his roles as the Goblin King and Bard (the eventual King of LakeTown).Many of the songs are also beautiful and memorable.All in all this is a great DVD that I still prefer over the 2012 version.",5,"2013, And This Is Still the Best Version.",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3322,"['Even', 'saw', 'recent', '2012', 'version', 'still', 'felt', 'animated', 'one', '70s', 'was', 'better.First', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'up', 'DVD', 'issues', 'others', 'have', 'raised', 'did', 'encounter', 'problems', 'DVD', 'skip', 'few', 'places', 'Such', 'when', 'Bard', 'Laketown', 'presents', 'dwarves', 'Slightly', 'annoying', 'yes', 'nothing', 'really', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Not', 'seriously', 'other', 'complaint', 'people', 'raised', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'image', 'dark', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'was', 'true', 'when', 'played', 'standard', 'DVD', 'player', 'when', 'put', 'upgrader', 'image', 'was', 'much', 'material', 'hand.The', 'main', 'reason', 'prefer', 'version', '1977', 'animated', 'version', 'sticks', 'story', 'what', 'Hobbit', 'new', '2012', 'version', 'tried', 'make', 'story', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'saga', 'full', 'war', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'Hobbit', 'journey', 'involved', 'SOME', 'violence.I', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'go', 'whole', 'synopsis', 'Chances', 'are', 'are', 'site', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'story.But', 'will', 'say', '1', '1/2', 'hour', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'film', 'story', 'most', 'beautiful', 'manner', 'have', 'Bilbo', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'journey', 'help', 'dwarves', 'reclaim', 'treasure', 'consider', 'theirs', 'Gandalf', 'certainly', 'heroic', 'benevolent', ""n't"", 'quite', 'become', 'Christ', 'figure', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'Two', 'Towers', 'dwarves', 'are', 'great', 'roles', ""'supposed"", 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'allowed', 'wonder', 'seem', 'manipulate', 'poor', 'Bilbo', 'lot', 'even', 'where', 'matters', ""'not"", 'original', 'bargain', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'quick', 'forget', 'certain', 'bargains', 'men', 'LakeTown', 'help', 'Thorin', 'feed', 'friends', ""'trust"", 'gratitude', 'Biblo', 'out', 'Smaug', 'trying', 'help', 'dwarves', 'get', 'gold', 'back', 'rage', 'Smaug', 'LakeTown', 'later', 'Bard', 'dwarves', 'Laketown', 'been', 'destroyed', 'must', 'be', 'rebuilt', 'can', 'thank', 'sharing', 'fortune', 'dwarves', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'gracious', 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', 'Smaug', 'destroyed', 'LakeTown', 'result', 'dwarves', 'trying', 'get', 'gold', 'What', 'contrast', 'how', 'dwarves', 'refuse', 'share', 'when', 'Bilbo', 'entered', 'Smaug', 'cave', 'Smaug', 'Well', 'thief', 'smell', 'feel', 'air', 'hear', 'breath', 'Go', 'Help', 'plenty', 'spare', 'Even', 'poor', 'Smaug', ""n't"", 'so', '2D', 'think', 'had', 'left', 'people', 'LakeTown', 'alone', 'many', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'attack', 'Bilbo', 'flushed', 'out', 'attempt', 'get', 'dwarves', 'gold.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'whole', 'story', 'events', 'story', 'alternate', 'most', 'beautiful', 'manner', 'events', 'story', 'narration', 'narration', 'Gandalf', 'Bilbo', 'Also', 'voices', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'Orson', 'Bean', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'John', 'Huston', 'great', 'heroic', 'benevolent', 'not', 'quite', 'yet', 'Christ', 'Gandalf', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'memorable', 'Elf', 'King', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'convincing', 'dangerous', 'possibly', 'not', 'evil', 'Smaug', 'John', 'Stephenson', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'Goblin', 'King', 'Bard', 'eventual', 'King', 'LakeTown', '.Many', 'songs', 'are', 'also', 'beautiful', 'memorable.All', 'great', 'DVD', 'still', 'prefer', '2012', 'version']",N/A

To say that I didn't like it would not be entirely true. Even today I fish it out and watch it from time to time. Unfortunately, you almost have to not have read the books to really enjoy it. Either that or you have to be younger than...let's say my age (twenty-two). This is because the film is very short. It's also animated, but there are lots of animated films and TV shows you can enjoy no matter what, so that's not my main gripe. There are a few problems I found with this movie. First, the actors. Yeah, they were good, but they just didn't sit right in my mind. Bilbo, for instance (played by Orson Bean), always seemed to me like he'd have an Irish accent or something. Gandalf always struck me as a British guy, while I always pictured the dwarves as Scottsman. Even their name sounds scottish, ya know, Dwarf.Actually, the thing that really gripes me is the fact that there were quite a lot of key scenes that were not included in the movie I.E. the company's meeting with Beorn and Bombur's little swim in the enchanted stream. The soundtrack was Ok as well, but not the best. The best part of that aspect of the film was that the singers for the songs did a good job. My favorites were Bilbo's song (this was actually at the end of the book), the Goblins' song and the song of the people of Esgaroth.

I'd seen Disney movies, but never anything like this. Here was animation - and animation appropriate for all ages at that - but with a different aesthetic and a little bit of an edge to it. Here is a tale of dragons, elves, wizards, goblins, giant spiders, valiant dwarves, and a little hobbit who is more than meets the eye.The plot is well-known, but for those unfamiliar with it: One day, Bilbo Baggins, a mild-mannered hobbit, receives a visit from a wily wizard named Gandalf and a group of 13 dwarves who enlist him in a mad adventure - to rescue the dwarves' rightful fortune from the dreaded clutches of the great dragon Smaug. Reluctantly accepting, Bilbo travels with his companions through dark forests, goblin-haunted mountains, the nests of great spiders, and worse, engaging in a battle of wits with a dragon and fighting a war between elves and men and dwarves and goblins. However, Bilbo finds that he learns a great deal about himself in the process.Rankin and Bass, who also produced the great stop-motion animation Christmas specials we've all come to love, did an excellent job with this show. The characters are relatable, the voices excellent (Gandalf, for instance, was voiced by the incomparable John Huston) and the music fun - all of the great songs of the Hobbit novel are in this jaunt, set to music and range from hauntingly beautiful to just plain fun.

It should be noted, for those that don't know, that Hobbits are the salt of the earth and enjoy the basics of life (mostly centering around meals). Most Hobbits frown on those who disrupt the status quo or go out adventuring. Bilbo had embraced this way of life and was seemingly willing to live from day to day without any indication that he had anything more in him. All of that was changed with the arrival of Gandalf, a traveling wizard. Soon Bilbo was pulled from the comfort of his home (and many pantries), and did indeed have many adventures involving Dwarves, Trolls, Giant Spiders, Elves, Orcs, Magic Swords, Treasures, and one clever Dragon.

But while you wait for Middle-Earth to come to life on the silver screen, it's worth checking out Rankin-Bass' ""The Hobbit,"" an animated kids' movie that is a fairly pleasant, moderately faithful adaptation.Bilbo Baggins is a mild-mannered little hobbit living unobtrusively in Bag End, a conventional hobbit-hole in the comfortably boring Shire. His life is abruptly turned upside-down when the mysterious wizard Gandalf arrives, along with thirteen dwarves (who proceed to take over Bilbo's home). That evening, they reveal their reason for coming: They are seeking a ""burglar"" to help them retake back Lonely Mountain, a dwarf stronghold taken over by the dragon Smaug.Whether he likes it or not, Bilbo soon ends up the burglar, and is dragged into elf palaces, goblin traps and even a fateful meeting with the grotesque froglike Gollum. The dangerous road ahead of him draws out reserves of courage and intelligence that few knew he had -- but the greatest danger comes not only from Smaug, but from the armies that congregate near his mountain.First off: This is only a moderately faithful adaptation of Tolkien's books -- most of the essentials are here, but quite a few things are missing, including any dwarves or elves other than Elrond and the thirteen guys following Bilbo. There are some vague mentions of a dwarf army arriving and some random singing voices outside Elrond's house, but nothing more than that.But it has the essentials -- goblins, eagles, hobbits, mountains of treasure, elves of various stripes, the grey wizard Gandalf and a town of men living on a stilted lake town. And there's plenty of humor (""MY ARMS!"") and quite a few battle scenes (which are marred by weird facial expression and schizophrenic spinning), and a truly lovely scene where Smaug starts visiting destruction on what he believes is his enemies.On the other hand, we are also treated to the weird sight of the Elf-King, Bard, and Thorin all gushing over each other, ten seconds after they were trying to kill each other. As for the animation, it's a mixed bag -- the dwarves, Gandalf, Gollum and Bilbo are all animated nicely, and there are some truly beautiful backdrops for the action (the Misty Mountain, Laketown, Hobbiton, even Mirkwood)... but the wood-elves look like distended Yodas.However, the sound is TERRIBLE. They have cleaned it up in places, but in other areas they have inserted gratuitous screams and mutters. They have also pulled out sounds: barrels rolling, arrows striking, Smaug roaring and breathing fire, the dwarves wailing from inside their barrels, the clash of gates - you get the idea. It's little details that makes it feel more real, but these are all removed -- and there's an annoying crackling sound that pops up every now and then.Until the live-action adaptations of ""The Hobbit"" comes out, we'll have to be content with the animated version -- it has some flaws, but it's an entertaining little story by itself.",3,Here down in the valley,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,3073,"['Currently', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adaptation', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'first', 'novel', 'Hobbit', 'mired', 'down', 'pre-production', 'problems', 'wait', 'Middle-Earth', 'come', 'life', 'silver', 'screen', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'Rankin-Bass', 'Hobbit', 'animated', 'kids', 'movie', 'fairly', 'pleasant', 'moderately', 'faithful', 'adaptation.Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'mild-mannered', 'little', 'hobbit', 'living', 'unobtrusively', 'Bag', 'End', 'conventional', 'hobbit-hole', 'comfortably', 'boring', 'Shire', 'life', 'abruptly', 'turned', 'upside-down', 'when', 'mysterious', 'wizard', 'Gandalf', 'thirteen', 'dwarves', 'who', 'proceed', 'take', 'over', 'Bilbo', 'home', 'evening', 'reveal', 'reason', 'coming', 'are', 'seeking', 'burglar', 'help', 'retake', 'back', 'Lonely', 'Mountain', 'dwarf', 'stronghold', 'taken', 'over', 'dragon', 'Smaug.Whether', 'not', 'Bilbo', 'soon', 'up', 'burglar', 'dragged', 'elf', 'palaces', 'goblin', 'traps', 'even', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'grotesque', 'froglike', 'Gollum', 'dangerous', 'road', 'ahead', 'out', 'reserves', 'courage', 'intelligence', 'few', 'knew', 'had', 'greatest', 'danger', 'not', 'only', 'Smaug', 'armies', 'congregate', 'mountain.First', 'off', 'only', 'moderately', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Tolkien', 'books', 'most', 'essentials', 'are', 'here', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'including', 'dwarves', 'other', 'Elrond', 'thirteen', 'guys', 'following', 'Bilbo', 'are', 'vague', 'mentions', 'dwarf', 'army', 'arriving', 'random', 'singing', 'voices', 'Elrond', 'house', 'nothing', 'more', 'that.But', 'essentials', 'goblins', 'eagles', 'hobbits', 'mountains', 'treasure', 'elves', 'various', 'stripes', 'grey', 'wizard', 'Gandalf', 'town', 'men', 'living', 'stilted', 'lake', 'town', 'plenty', 'humor', 'ARMS', 'quite', 'few', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'marred', 'weird', 'facial', 'expression', 'schizophrenic', 'spinning', 'truly', 'lovely', 'scene', 'where', 'Smaug', 'visiting', 'destruction', 'what', 'enemies.On', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'weird', 'sight', 'Elf-King', 'Bard', 'Thorin', 'gushing', 'other', 'ten', 'seconds', 'were', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'animation', 'mixed', 'bag', 'dwarves', 'Gandalf', 'Gollum', 'Bilbo', 'are', 'animated', 'nicely', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'backdrops', 'action', 'Misty', 'Mountain', 'Laketown', 'Hobbiton', 'even', 'Mirkwood', 'wood-elves', 'look', 'distended', 'Yodas.However', 'sound', 'TERRIBLE', 'have', 'cleaned', 'up', 'places', 'other', 'areas', 'have', 'inserted', 'gratuitous', 'screams', 'mutters', 'have', 'also', 'pulled', 'out', 'sounds', 'barrels', 'rolling', 'striking', 'Smaug', 'roaring', 'breathing', 'fire', 'dwarves', 'wailing', 'barrels', 'clash', 'gates', 'get', 'idea', 'little', 'details', 'feel', 'more', 'real', 'are', 'removed', 'annoying', 'crackling', 'sound', 'up', 'now', 'then.Until', 'live-action', 'adaptations', 'Hobbit', 'out', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'content', 'animated', 'version', 'flaws', 'entertaining', 'little', 'story']",N/A

I Just finished reading J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" for the first time. My husband asked me to read it, claiming it as his favorite book of all time. It was good, but at the age of 26, I did find it a tad tedious. I do however, understand why it has so many devoted followers.The cartoon version of ""The Hobbit"" is old. It was produced in 1978. I really liked the animation. It had a very enchanting, dark, ""foreign"" quality to it. There are many lines taken verbatum from the book, but you can't expect the movie to live up to the printed edition. It doesn't come close..but I must say I still thought the scene with Gollum was most horrifying. I hope someday to overcome my fear of the slimy little monster.Would this be a great edition to a Tolkien fan's collection? It would make a good gift. Do I recommend this to young children? I'm not sure...the characters are pretty frightening and the whole movie has a real gritty aura to it. I think it would be more appropriate for a child that has already read the book/series and understands it's concept.

492022,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000005PE9,J. Alford,"[2, 3]","Ahead of Peter Jackson by at least two decades, the crew of Rankin/Bass decided to take a break from holiday specials or tokusatsu movies and put together this, the first ever animated production based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit was a prelude to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and Rankin/Bass created this made-for-TV movie which aired a year prior to Ralph Bakshi's Rings theatrical animated feature(which only covered most of the first two books). Rankin/Bass later went on to do another TV movie based on Return Of The King, which alot of rumors state was done to finish up where Bakshi's film left off, but according to R/B was really intended as a followup to their version of The Hobbit. Like some of their other productions, Rankin/Bass did this in association with a Japanese studio, in this case Topcraft(aka: Studio Ghibli).The movie is a pretty faithful adaptation of the original novel. Bilbo Baggins is an average Hobbit, a race of short humanoids that live in the quiet area of Hobbiton(or ""Shire"")in the mythical land of Middle Earth. He gets drafted into a quest with the drifter wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves to be their lucky number as a burglar. Thorin is their leader, and is taking them to Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim their treasure stolen generations ago by the evil dragon, Smaug. Along the way, they run afoul of trolls, but Gandalf(on one of his many coffee breaks away from the party)saves them, and leads them to Rivendell to meet up with the elf lord Elrond. Bilbo and the dwarves are later on captured by goblins(or ""orcs""), but Bilbo falls down a whole into a dark underground cavern where he runs across the froglike creature Gollum. Bilbo happens upon a magic ring that makes him invisible when he wears it, and uses it to follow Gollum to an exit. He rejoins his friends and frees them, but only for them to be captured again by giant spiders. Bilbo liberates them again, but they are in turn caught again by wood-elves(or ""silvan elves""). Invinsibly, the phantom Hobbit manages to get the dwarves to the lake town near Lonely Mountain. The treasure hunters then go to Smaug's pad, and Bilbo is elected to go burgal something out of there. Using his inviso-power, Bilbo manages to gander at the overgrown reptile to find he has a small patch in his scaly armor, but his presence ticks Smaug off, and he heads to the lake town for some serious Godzilla-on-Tokyo action. Bilbo sends a bird to give the head of the lake town Smaug's design flaw, and the big lizard gets arrow'd once and for all. The story concludes with an epic battle of five armies feuding over the treasure, which with Gandalf's help ends about as peaceably as at could. Bilbo heads back to Hobbiton/Shire unaware that this part of the story is only the beginning.This TV movie has become the stuff of legend, winning the Christopher Award, a Peabody, and was nominated for a Hugo Award. It features some of the amazing character designs Rankin/Bass has used in both its 2D and 3D productions, most of which for this film were inspired by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham. The best is the all star cast employed for this, including Orson Bean as Bilbo, John Huston as Gandalf, and Richard Boone completely dominates his role as Smaug. For a 70s TV production, there is some breathtaking animation, far beyond what you would've seen in even a Disney movie.

The real problem with the visuals is that the character designer (Lester Abrams) was apparently not that familiar with Tolkein's descriptions of Elves. The Wood Elves resemble Dungeons & Dragons style Goblins, the Goblins look like cat monsters, Smeagol looks like a Kappa or some kind of toad-monkey, & Elrond should have black hair, look much younger, & not have a beard, as Tolken wrote that Elves do not grow facial hair & are fair & ageless in appearence. The Dwarves take the Disney approach of looking like Garden Gnomes, & the Ent looked like it was made of wood, but they should be able to blend in with the trees seamlessly.Most readers complain about the absence of Beorn. Indeed there is a great deal of scenes where the characters are walking to music, but meetings are cut out or cut short, like how no one ever includes Tom Bombadil from Fellowship of the Ring. (Though I dout Rankin-Bass would have cut him out, as asll he ever does is sing).The entire venture through Mirkwood & the introductionns to the Wood Elves & river folk are short & not very eventful.In the end, the tension between the greed-sticken Thorin & tired Bilbo is almost cut entirely, & the big battle is not well explained & very short.The voice acting isn't bad (Smeagol's is especially interesting) & the motions, expressions, & quality of the animation are much higher than what you can expect out of anything hand-drawn today. They also do a great job of making Gandalf look like a scary badass.In the end, it's highly recommended for people who have never & will never read the book, for only they will find no fault in it.",3,Not one of Rankin-Bass's best.,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,2356,"['Rankin-Bass', 'master', 'animated', 'claymated', 'fantasy', 'are', 'also', 'notorious', 'rushing', 'skipping', 'entire', 'scenes', 'source', 'material', 'make', 'room', 'lots', 'lots', 'singing', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'LotR', 'movie', 'broken', 'two', 'movies.The', 'lyrics', 'music', 'are', 'taken', 'straight', 'book', 'people', 'music', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cheered', 'music', 'had', 'been', 'sound', 'effects', 'missing', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'release', 'thing', 'two', 'ways', 'character', 'designs', 'people', 'find', 'endearing', 'fantastical', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'very', 'Rankin-Bassish', 'Half', 'people', 'think', 'damn', 'creepy', 'even', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'find', 'style', 'unsettling', 'real', 'problem', 'visuals', 'character', 'designer', 'Lester', 'Abrams', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'familiar', 'Tolkein', 'descriptions', 'Elves', 'Wood', 'Elves', 'resemble', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'style', 'Goblins', 'Goblins', 'look', 'cat', 'monsters', 'Smeagol', 'Kappa', 'kind', 'toad-monkey', 'Elrond', 'should', 'have', 'black', 'hair', 'look', 'much', 'younger', 'not', 'have', 'beard', 'Tolken', 'wrote', 'Elves', 'do', 'not', 'grow', 'facial', 'hair', 'are', 'fair', 'ageless', 'appearence', 'Dwarves', 'take', 'Disney', 'approach', 'looking', 'Garden', 'Gnomes', 'Ent', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'wood', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'blend', 'trees', 'seamlessly.Most', 'readers', 'complain', 'absence', 'Beorn', 'Indeed', 'great', 'deal', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'walking', 'music', 'meetings', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'cut', 'short', 'how', 'one', 'ever', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'dout', 'Rankin-Bass', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'asll', 'ever', 'sing', '.The', 'entire', 'venture', 'Mirkwood', 'introductionns', 'Wood', 'Elves', 'river', 'folk', 'are', 'short', 'not', 'very', 'end', 'tension', 'greed-sticken', 'Thorin', 'tired', 'Bilbo', 'almost', 'cut', 'entirely', 'big', 'battle', 'not', 'well', 'explained', 'very', 'short.The', 'voice', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Smeagol', 'especially', 'interesting', 'motions', 'expressions', 'quality', 'animation', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'anything', 'hand-drawn', 'today', 'also', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Gandalf', 'look', 'scary', 'badass.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommended', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'will', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'only', 'will', 'find', 'fault']",N/A

The songs are decent, though some are rather sappy, and the animation is satisfactory.

In retrospect, I realize that my mother introduced me to this movie to prepare me for the book, which she later read to me as a bedtime story. Anyway, I still like the movie, which now holds additional nostalgic value. In my opinion, this movie is a better adaptation than the other attempts to translate Tolkein's work into animation. Part of this is probably due to the fact that The Hobbit actually was a simpler book, and was made to please younger children, as well as older kids and adults. Even though the encounter with Beorn was left out, this movie is an excellent adaptation of the novel, covering all significant plot points, and making excellent use of Tolkein's songs and poetry in the soundtrack. I still think of the melodies in this film when I read the musical sections of the book. The vocal acting was done brilliantly, with Orson Bean making Bilbo simultaneously mild-mannered and courageous; John Huston giving Gandalf a vigourous personality and resonant voice to match; and Hans Conreid making Thorin suitably proud and surly. The animation, which some people call &quot;dated&quot; is perfectly adequate, is not so spectacular that it takes one's attention away from the story, and has a feel that I have never found outside of a Rankin-Bass film.

Tolkien's classic novel ""The Hobbit,"" I was extremely disappointed after watching this animated version last night.Released as a television movie in 1978, this animated ""cartoon"" version of one of my favorite books fails in just about every way possible.  From the completely uninspired, low budget TV animation, to the annoying soundtrack complete with horrible songs, this movie completely misses the fun and excitement of the book.Sadly, Tolkien's wonderful characters are all reduced to dull, unmemorable one dimensional cartoons, and even the voice talents of such people as John Huston, who is the voice of Gandalf, add little to the overall mediocre production.If you're looking for a nice ""kiddy movie"" to keep your very young children entertained for a few hours, than maybe this movie will be acceptable. But if you are a serious adult fan of ""The Hobbit"" I think you will be unimpressed and probably quite bored with this animated version.The Hobbit is a true classic, a wonderful fairy tale and a grand adventure! It was such a fun book to read as a kid, and again as an adult. I truly hope that one day this book gets the same ""live action"" film treatment that Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" has already received.  It's long overdue that this story becomes the epic motion picture that so many fans have been hoping for.Mike",2,A Classic Book Reduced to a Poorly Animated Kid's Cartoon,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1361,"['big', 'fan', 'J.', 'R.', 'R.', 'Tolkien', 'classic', 'novel', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'animated', 'version', 'last', 'night.Released', 'television', 'movie', '1978', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'version', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'just', 'way', 'possible', 'completely', 'uninspired', 'low', 'budget', 'TV', 'animation', 'annoying', 'soundtrack', 'complete', 'horrible', 'songs', 'movie', 'completely', 'fun', 'excitement', 'book.Sadly', 'Tolkien', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'are', 'reduced', 'dull', 'unmemorable', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cartoons', 'even', 'voice', 'talents', 'such', 'people', 'John', 'Huston', 'who', 'voice', 'Gandalf', 'add', 'little', 'overall', 'mediocre', 'production.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'nice', 'kiddy', 'movie', 'keep', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'entertained', 'few', 'hours', 'maybe', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'acceptable', 'are', 'serious', 'adult', 'fan', 'Hobbit', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'unimpressed', 'probably', 'quite', 'bored', 'animated', 'version.The', 'Hobbit', 'true', 'classic', 'wonderful', 'fairy', 'tale', 'grand', 'adventure', 'was', 'such', 'fun', 'book', 'read', 'kid', 'again', 'adult', 'truly', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'book', 'same', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'treatment', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'already', 'received', 'long', 'overdue', 'story', 'epic', 'motion', 'picture', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'hoping', 'for.Mike']",N/A

After reading the horrid reviews people have written about this harmless cartoon, I am taking a stand and defending its virtues.So it doesn't exactly include everything from the book. So the animation is not Pixar-quality. The movie includes the majority of the relevant points from the book and paints an entertaining tale of magic, sorcery, and the races of Middle Earth. In fact, after just recently reading ""The Hobbit"", I found this cartoon to accurately portray the images I had in my mind while reading its chapters.Bilbo Baggins is the most unlikely hero, playing the ""burglar"" designated by the wizard Gandalf to help the Dwarves reclaim the treasure that lies within the Lonely Mountain. During his travels, he meets Trolls, Elrond in Rivendell (a character which recurs in the LOTR trilogy), wicked spiders, elves, and much more. And, as a small part of the tale, he encounters Gollum and finds a most ordinary ring...a trinket that enables him to become invisible. Little does he know...In any case, unless Peter Jackson decides to make the LOTR prequel of ""The Hobbit"", this is the only one we've really got. And I have to say, it wasn't that bad. Read the book, though...it will make the movie more enjoyable and understandable.

492071,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B000005PE9,"Mike London ""MAC""","[5, 6]","This video is a good adaptiation of J. R. R. Tolkien's classic children's novel.  There are many positive things to it.  Yet there are also some negative aspects to it, because, after all, it is a human production.The  positive is it introduces the story to an audience that might not pick up a  book, or people who have never heard of Tolkien (imagine that!).  I can  honestly say this movie is responsible for getting me into Tolkien.  We had  Disney, and I watched this and the sequel (Return of the King), although I  remembered this the most.  When I saw the book at a flea market back when I  was 12 or 13, I bought it (I am now 20).  Had it not been for this movie, I  might have passed that book bye.  Therefore, I'm heavily indebted to this  movie, because it is responsible for my discovery of Tolkien.  The  animation, espically that of The Shire, is true to the stories.  The  depiction of Gollum is espically good, and that whole sequence is very well  down.  The animators and cast really capture the spirit of what Tolkien was  trying to do.  Gandalf is always a a delight.  The dragon is magnificent  (although they erroneously pronounce &quot;Smaug&quot; like the pollution  &quot;smog&quot;).  Much of the animation seems like pictures straight from  Tolkien's sketch book.The negative, although it is not surprising,  tho' still disappointing, is they cut things out.  The entire sequence with  Beorn is cut out.  It would have been very interesting to see him in this  version.  The elves do not have that `high elvish beauty' that so permeates  THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and, to a lesser extent, THE HOBBIT.  They are quite  attrocious to look at.  Strangely, they fit in well with the scenery and  the animation style, but to the story it contradicts it.  Some things are  rushed over, most notable the episode with the Trolls.  In the book, they  have a fight o how to cook the dwarves, with Gandalf off scene, actually  causing the fight. Here, they comment on how they like them, but there is  no fight, and (unconvincingly) dawn overtakes them.  On the mountain,  although there is the thrush, there is no great ravens (Roac son of Carc).  The entire political matter of the Arkenstone is left out.  And for some  strange reason, they change the number of how many live from 10 to 6.  The  reason why I could never understand.  One scene I never understood was  Bilbo, awakening to find the goblins upon them, but before dreaming, says  &quot;dwarves have a strange notion of perfection&quot;.  It is only a 76  minute film, so they did cut things.  It is sad they could not include  more.As you can tell, its chief weaknesses are the things it cut out.  The movie is true to the book.  Bilbo's physical appearance is now how I  always visualize it, and Gollum is superb.  He is blackened skinned in  this, and green in THE RETURN OF THE KING.  The animation is its strongest,  and with exception to the Elves is true to Tolkien, the weakest is the  things they were forced to cut.  Overall, a good film.  This place will  always have special significance to me, because this is what got me into  Tolkien.

The music was pleasantly familiar and rather comical in the way in broke into the middle of some scenes to provide some explanation of Bilbo's thoughts. Some of the songs were actually lyrics from the book set to music, which I enjoyed immensely.The animation was good, if nothing really spectacular; the lightning flashes around Gandalf were actually really cool, and there was no need for the movie to look especially bright or detailed and I thought the more muted colors and simpler art-style fit the mood.It followed the book reasonably well, but, being only an hour and 17 minutes, it sometimes seemed a bit rushed; the dwarves arrived all at once rather than gradually, and Beorn wasn't in the movie at all. The humor is what suffered the most from the short runtime. But still, it couldn't include everything.

Bilbo is to serve the Dwarves in the capacity of ""burglar"". They do, in fact, experience multiple adventures along the way, incursions with terrifying trolls and other enchanted world undesirables. The Dwarves make it hard on themselves by way of their greed which made me think how very true this story is.

This animated version premiered on television in 1978 and it is passable, but nothing spectacular. This movie tells the story of how Bilbo Baggins acquires the ring that becomes the central focus of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.The movie follows the book fairly well, but it is basically play by numbers. At only 77 minutes, it moves through the story quickly and fails to develop it. It lacks the feel or spirit of the book and the characters receive little development. Gollum, who is one of Tolkien's more interesting creations, is portrayed as a loathsome toad. Smaug hardly seems the awesome and terrifying creature that Bilbo outwits in the book. Gandalf and Bilbo are the only characters who receive an acceptable treatment.The animation is passable and the music is at best listenable and at worst annoying. As an introduction to Tolkien's works for kids this movie succeeds. However, for a more adult and/or Tolkien-savy audience this is lacking as a good representation of the depth of story telling that he was capable of.

Tolkien, is loads of family enjoyment!The story begins introducing a small hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is the same as almost every hobbit; he loves peace and calm, and doesn't even have the slightest wish to have an adventure. But when the wizard Gandalf appears at his home, his life is turned topsy-turvey along with the arrival of Thorin and Co., 13 homeless dwarfs. They are in search of a 'burglar' to help them take back what is rightfully theirs, the treasure stolen from them by the evil dragon, Smaug. Bilbo of course refuses to have any part of them but very much against his will is pulled into their adventure. But it won't be easy. They must cross over the Edge of the Wild, go over the Misty Mountains, then go through the dark Mirkwoods. Along they way they must also fight against trolls, goblins, the savage Warfs, giant spiders, and other unknown dangers. Will they be able to make it to the Lonely Mountains? But Bilbo is thinking, even if they make it there, will they be able to defeat the dragon who awaits them there?Terrific tale, and if you haven't read the book, I truly recommend you that you read it. But I can give this movie only 4 stars. This movie does have its good points. I love it how it is close to the book, the people who did the voices of all the characters were perfect for the parts, and it's enjoyable for people all ages. I love it also the music, and they used Tolkien's words and lines from the book.But it does has some weak points. One, as most people pointed out, many major events were taken out of the movie. Most noticeably is there is no mention of one of my favorite characters in the book, Beorn the man/bear and the end was a little different, too. Also, the animation isn't that good, not at all like the newer computer animated movies. This may dissapoint many people and teenagers especially if they're not patient enough to watch it through.Still, it is good family fun and I recommend this movie. I haven't seen next of the animated &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but I have seen &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. I did not think much of that at all. I think I'll wait for the movie &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to come out. I'm so excited to see it!

I remember years ago seeing the full length theatrical version of Rankin/Bass' Lord of the Rings, but this is the first time I've seen the Hobbit.I've read Tolkien's trilogy a few times and am familiar with the book.  The film follows the book fairly religiously.  There are certain liberties: Bilbo is writing a narrative to Gandalf whereas this never happens in the book, but it makes a good first person plot device.Especially impressive was putting the story's original songs and poetry to music and overall it turned out pretty well.  The trolls capturing the dwarves or the goblins ""snap crack break snap!"" songs were especially creepy.I was especially impressed with Gollum meeting Bilbo when they were swapping riddles to see if Bilbo would be tasty ""my precioussss.""  Not all the riddles from the book were used and there was one point where one of the riddles was used as a backdrop song.  Very creative.The animation is ""OK"" but keep in mind this was made as a low budget television picture and so would not have the resources to make a better animated feature.  For what they got, they did it well.It was great to hear Hans Conried as one of the voices (Thorin the dwarf king) as I used to hear him many times on Saturday morning cartoon features.The Hobbit is not a ""cartoon"" but was drawn as an illustration -- the art in the background is nicely ""Middle Earth""-ish; the tones are usually of a brown/tan nature, an old-fashioned look.  The animation is a bit stiff but that's a minor quibble.The film is clearly made for older children and I think this film would be a great introduction to Tolkien until they get older and are ready to tackle the author's original works.Peter Jackson's The Hobbit will be released in a couple of years but why wait?

492102,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000005PE9,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 2]","The Rankin-Bass adaptations of JRR Tolkien's beloved Middle-Earth novels are a challenge to appreciate.  They set a difficult task for themselves by simply taking on these projects - Tolkien considered his books ""unfilmbable,"" and the legions of his rabid fans are only too eager to pick over any flaw or devitation from the original books, no matter how minor.  And these productions are not mega-budget affairs, either.And yet, of the three projects undertaken by the Rankin-Bass team, ""The Hobbit"" is by far the most successful.  Despite the fact that this is an extremely dated film - thanks to the dramatic improvements in animation since 1977 and Glenn Yarbrough's incredibly new-agey vibrato - the movie is a perfect little adventure for kids under the age of 10.In the wake of Peter Jackson's stupendous ""Lord of the Rings"" films, a little comparison is warranted.  The gap between this production of ""The Hobbit"" and Peter Jackson's films is tremendous - you cannot put these productions side by side.  For one thing, Jackson's catering budget was probably 100 times the size of the Rankin-Bass operating budget.  For another, the Rankin-Bass guys were trying to make a cartoon, while Jackson was trying to make some serious movies.  So it is as unfair to the Rankin-Bass team to complain that ""The Hobbit"" is not as good as Jackson's movies as it is to complain that the Looney Tunes ""G.I. Bugs Bunny"" is not as good as ""Saving Private Ryan.""So what do you get with this adapation of ""The Hobbit""?  First, you get a condensed story that is still remarkably faithful to the original book.  The movie feels a bit pell-mell at times - the visit to the House of Elron, the attack by the goblins in the Misty Mountains, and the fiery-rescue-by-the-eagles scene each seem to take about 45 seconds - but it knows where to linger.  Bilbo's riddle-game with Gollum is a lot of fun, and Bilbo's encounter with Smaug is the high mark of the movie.  All in all, the movie does a terrific job showing Bilbo's growth from a respectable hobbit to a full-flung adventurer (although one who never forgets the simple pleasures of a good pipe and a large meal).  The filmmakers also did an excellent job adapting Tolkien's original poetry and songs into the movie soundtrack - my four-year-old daughter walked around singing ""Fifteen Birds in Five Fir Trees"" for a couple of days after watching the movie for the first time.  These are simple, catchy songs - perfect for kids.The animation is also first-rate (for its time).  There are the usual short-cuts, but all the characters are drawn more or less along the archetypal lines.  The only exception to this are the Wood Elves, who are a mysteriously dark and frowny bunch.  Voice talents are impeccable - Orson Bean is an earnest Bilbo, John Huston is a wise and knowing Gandalf, and Richard Boone is awesome as Smaug.  It's a little jarring to hear some of the more minor characters voiced by the same voices I remember from ""The Flintstones,"" ""Battle of the Superfriends,"" and the ""Laff-O'lympics"" - but that's a minor complaint.Tolkien fans will lament the shortcomings of this adaptation - the story was slashed to Cliff Notes proportions, and the overall production is so kid-friendly it is hard for adult fans of Tolkien to watch it without feeling a little guilty.  But with the news that Peter Jackson continues to try to put ""The Hobbit"" on the big screen, there's hope for a more mature version of the film.  But the fact remains that this production will be the first exposure to Tolkien for lots of young people, and it does a perfect job of baiting the hook.",4,Difficult to review - but ultimately high marks are needed,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,3615,"['Rankin-Bass', 'adaptations', 'JRR', 'Tolkien', 'beloved', 'Middle-Earth', 'novels', 'are', 'challenge', 'appreciate', 'set', 'difficult', 'task', 'simply', 'taking', 'projects', 'Tolkien', 'considered', 'books', 'unfilmbable', 'legions', 'rabid', 'fans', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'eager', 'pick', 'over', 'flaw', 'devitation', 'original', 'books', 'matter', 'how', 'minor', 'productions', 'are', 'not', 'mega-budget', 'affairs', 'either.And', 'yet', 'three', 'projects', 'undertaken', 'Rankin-Bass', 'team', 'Hobbit', 'far', 'most', 'successful', 'fact', 'extremely', 'dated', 'film', 'thanks', 'dramatic', 'improvements', 'animation', '1977', 'Glenn', 'Yarbrough', 'incredibly', 'new-agey', 'vibrato', 'movie', 'perfect', 'little', 'adventure', 'kids', 'age', '10.In', 'wake', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'stupendous', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'little', 'comparison', 'warranted', 'gap', 'production', 'Hobbit', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'films', 'tremendous', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'productions', 'side', 'side', 'one', 'thing', 'Jackson', 'catering', 'budget', 'was', 'probably', '100', 'times', 'size', 'Rankin-Bass', 'operating', 'budget', 'Rankin-Bass', 'guys', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'cartoon', 'Jackson', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'serious', 'movies', 'as', 'unfair', 'Rankin-Bass', 'team', 'complain', 'Hobbit', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'complain', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'G.I', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'adapation', 'Hobbit', 'First', 'get', 'condensed', 'story', 'still', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'movie', 'bit', 'pell-mell', 'times', 'visit', 'House', 'Elron', 'attack', 'goblins', 'Misty', 'Mountains', 'fiery-rescue-by-the-eagles', 'scene', 'seem', 'take', '45', 'seconds', 'where', 'linger', 'Bilbo', 'riddle-game', 'Gollum', 'lot', 'fun', 'Bilbo', 'encounter', 'Smaug', 'high', 'mark', 'movie', 'movie', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'Bilbo', 'growth', 'respectable', 'hobbit', 'full-flung', 'adventurer', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'good', 'pipe', 'large', 'meal', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'adapting', 'Tolkien', 'original', 'poetry', 'songs', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'four-year-old', 'daughter', 'walked', 'singing', 'Fifteen', 'Birds', 'Five', 'Fir', 'Trees', 'couple', 'days', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'simple', 'catchy', 'songs', 'perfect', 'kids.The', 'animation', 'also', 'first-rate', 'time', 'are', 'usual', 'short-cuts', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'more', 'less', 'archetypal', 'lines', 'only', 'exception', 'are', 'Wood', 'Elves', 'who', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'dark', 'frowny', 'bunch', 'Voice', 'talents', 'are', 'impeccable', 'Orson', 'Bean', 'earnest', 'Bilbo', 'John', 'Huston', 'wise', 'knowing', 'Gandalf', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'awesome', 'Smaug', 'little', 'jarring', 'hear', 'more', 'minor', 'characters', 'voiced', 'same', 'voices', 'remember', 'Flintstones', 'Battle', 'Superfriends', ""Laff-O'lympics"", 'minor', 'complaint.Tolkien', 'fans', 'will', 'lament', 'shortcomings', 'adaptation', 'story', 'was', 'slashed', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'proportions', 'overall', 'production', 'so', 'kid-friendly', 'hard', 'adult', 'fans', 'Tolkien', 'watch', 'feeling', 'little', 'guilty', 'news', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'try', 'put', 'Hobbit', 'big', 'screen', 'hope', 'more', 'mature', 'version', 'film', 'fact', 'production', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'exposure', 'Tolkien', 'lots', 'young', 'people', 'perfect', 'job', 'baiting', 'hook']",N/A

But all of this is suddenly changed when the wizard Gandalf (voice by John Huston) appears with a dozen dwarves, headed by Thorin (voice by Hans Conreid).  They are there to hire an expert burglar, of which Bilbo is purported to be, but by whom Bilbo really does not know.  Before he knows it, Bilbo is on his way to Laketown where the last surviving dragon, Smaug (voice by Richard Boon), watches over the great dwarvish treasure that Thorin is determined to reclaim.  Along the way, Bilbo will be forced to battle monstrous trolls, descend into the world of the goblins, escape the clutches of the creature Gollum (voice by Brother Theodore), free his friends from the huge spiders, and eventually steal into the cavern of the great Smaug himself...I can vividly remember watching this film when I was a child and being absolutely entranced by this fantasy world.  I had no idea it was based on a book until I was older and was able to devour Tolkien's books.  I admit that the animation style takes a little getting used to, but I thought that it very ably suited the fantasy epic portrayed.  All of the voices were perfect for the film and the voice of Gollum is particularly creepy - you can really tell that this creature has lost his sanity just by listening to the voice.  I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack where they took care to use songs from the book.  These were wonderful and I love that they took the time to put them in.  Even though there is quite a bit of violence in the story, the animators took care not to show anything, just showing weird swirls of color and blackouts, I didn't even know that the characters were dying until I watched it when I was older.  Still, it is a little too scary for young children to watch, regardless of its cartoon status.  As far as the sound quality goes, I would have to agree with other viewers in that it is very poor on this DVD.

Bilbo joins some dwarves to reclaim their treasure stolen by a dragon named Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo bumps into Gollum and gains The Ring. This does provide some background for the story of Lord of the Rings.I do find it interesting that it took 40 years for any movie version to be attempted.

I'd say it fits, and the music is appropriate. I feel this way because I ate at a vegetarian place in Houston, TX that had a name inspired by Hobbit culture and seemed to share some aspects of the &quot;hippie&quot; way of life.

The show was made for children so the violence was toned down and a few songs were tossed in to keep things cute (you can thank Disney for that mentality). All in all it's a good effort considering what they were trying to accomplish.Now for this DVD. It sucks. For some reason about half of the atmosphereic sounds and audio effects are gone. It's like some scenes have just about all of the audio taken out completely. No more are the ""death"" noises Rankin and Bass used in place of... well... death scenes. No more do you hear Smaug's fiery breath. Basically lots of audio cues that really flesh out the visuals are gone. It's incredibly annoying.I remember watching this special when I was a kid and I remember a LOT more sounds and background noises. I have no idea why they aren't on this DVD. If it wasn't for the extremely poor audio transfer I would easily recommend this DVD. As it is I can only recommend this DVD to people already familiar with this special.

I grew up watching it on the Disney Channel as a kid, and thought it was awesome. As a teen I discovered it was based on a book, read it and quickly became a massive fan of epic fantasy. Suffice it to say after seeing it on TV in the 80's as a child I had high hopes for the DVD.Quite frankly this DVD is complete garbage. The menus look like something created on a home computer. As other reviewers have pointed out, key sound effects are missing and the audio is muted and subdued. There is no range in the audio, it's flat as a pancake and muted and muffled as if your speakers were covered in a blanket. Even worse, the video quality looks like a bootleg video that was ripped and posted to YouTube at low quality. I'm talking blacks that look grey (on a plasma TV no less), huge amounts of pixelization in spots, audio that actually skips in one spot and repeats, panning shots that jump instead of smoothly sliding (again on a plasma, so it's NOT an LCD panning issue) and dark scenes that have such poor contrast you can hardly see anything. Not to mention horrible interlacing on the page turn effects. Yuck!The ultimate conclusion is that this is a five star movie that's been given a horrific release on DVD and desperately needs a remaster so that animation fans can enjoy it fully. Until there's a Criterion quality Blu Ray released (for GOOD examples of animation remasters see Ah My Goddess!, Magic Knight Rayearth, Arcadia of My Youth, and The Secret of NIMH, as well as any of the old Miyazaki releases) don't buy this movie unless you've got a VCR and can find a copy of the VHS.",1,A five star movie with a one star DVD,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,1700,"['Let', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'first-of-all', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'original', 'animated', 'feature', 'Hobbit', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'kid', 'thought', 'was', 'awesome', 'teen', 'discovered', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'read', 'quickly', 'became', 'massive', 'fan', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'Suffice', 'say', 'seeing', 'TV', '80', 'child', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'DVD.Quite', 'frankly', 'DVD', 'complete', 'garbage', 'menus', 'look', 'something', 'created', 'home', 'computer', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'key', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'missing', 'audio', 'muted', 'subdued', 'range', 'audio', 'flat', 'pancake', 'muted', 'muffled', 'speakers', 'were', 'covered', 'blanket', 'Even', 'worse', 'video', 'quality', 'bootleg', 'video', 'was', 'ripped', 'posted', 'YouTube', 'low', 'quality', ""'m"", 'talking', 'blacks', 'look', 'grey', 'plasma', 'TV', 'less', 'huge', 'amounts', 'pixelization', 'spots', 'audio', 'actually', 'one', 'spot', 'repeats', 'panning', 'shots', 'jump', 'instead', 'smoothly', 'sliding', 'again', 'plasma', 'NOT', 'LCD', 'panning', 'issue', 'dark', 'scenes', 'have', 'such', 'poor', 'contrast', 'can', 'hardly', 'see', 'anything', 'Not', 'mention', 'horrible', 'interlacing', 'page', 'turn', 'effects', 'Yuck', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'been', 'given', 'horrific', 'release', 'DVD', 'desperately', 'remaster', 'animation', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'Criterion', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'released', 'GOOD', 'examples', 'animation', 'remasters', 'see', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'Arcadia', 'My', 'Youth', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'Miyazaki', 'releases', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'VCR', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'VHS']",N/A

Bass/Rankin produced an animation that was more catered to the younger audience, but imho, worked -- it brought a fairly-tale like quality before the much more grim telling of the Lord of the Rings. the handpainted backgrounds were very nicely done that are far superior to many other comparable animations.the songs were ok, and remember Tolkien wrote poems in the book that would sound horrible if it were just said... i.e., when the Orcs/Wargs rode down singing/chanting: 'fifteen birds, in five fir trees...' this quirkly little poem added a certain style to Tolkien writing that i thought was appropriately ported to this animation. watch Ladyhawk if you really want to gripe about a soundtrack adversely affecting the movie.the voice acting in general was quite good but Huston was flawless -- and he was much, much better in the Return of the King and was particularly effective because the voice of Gandolf became the narrative of that animation.the Hobbit, as a book, i felt was much more whimsical than Tolkien's other works and i enjoy this interpretation (but read the book whenever you get the chance!) -- i just wish that they hadn't downgraded the soundtrack -- or they could have tone down the song just a wee bit and everyone would be happy ;)",3,in a hole in the ground...,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,1752,"['i', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'more', '4', ""'"", 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'WB', 'changed/omitted', 'parts', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'noticable', 'i', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'vhs', 'version', 'anticipation', 'dvd', '.i', 'must', 'admit', 'aside', 'bringing', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'youth', 'i', 'thought', 'movie', 'held', 'own', 'merits.the', 'animation', 'style', 'very', 'distinctive', 'i', 'felt', 'character', 'designs', 'were', 'fairly', 'appropriate', 'Bass/Rankin', 'produced', 'animation', 'was', 'more', 'catered', 'younger', 'audience', 'imho', 'worked', 'brought', 'fairly-tale', 'quality', 'much', 'more', 'grim', 'telling', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'handpainted', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'many', 'other', 'comparable', 'animations.the', 'songs', 'were', 'ok', 'remember', 'Tolkien', 'wrote', 'poems', 'book', 'would', 'sound', 'horrible', 'were', 'just', 'said', 'i.e.', 'when', 'Orcs/Wargs', 'rode', 'down', 'singing/chanting', ""'fifteen"", 'birds', 'five', 'fir', 'trees', 'quirkly', 'little', 'poem', 'added', 'certain', 'style', 'Tolkien', 'writing', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'appropriately', 'ported', 'animation', 'watch', 'Ladyhawk', 'really', 'want', 'gripe', 'soundtrack', 'adversely', 'affecting', 'movie.the', 'voice', 'acting', 'general', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Huston', 'was', 'flawless', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Return', 'King', 'was', 'particularly', 'effective', 'voice', 'Gandolf', 'became', 'narrative', 'animation.the', 'Hobbit', 'book', 'i', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'whimsical', 'Tolkien', 'other', 'works', 'i', 'enjoy', 'interpretation', 'read', 'book', 'whenever', 'get', 'chance', 'i', 'just', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'downgraded', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'have', 'tone', 'down', 'song', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'happy']",N/A

I bought it for nostalgic reasons, so that we could all watch it together again and bring back good memories. It achieved that goal, but I was a little disappointed in a few things. For one, it seemed to me that there were missing scenes, but maybe I am wrong about that. Maybe I am confusing it with an LP audio version story of The Hobbit. Aside from this, there is one place where a brief, seconds-long scene and audio are repeated, and another spot where it appears to &#34;skip&#34; briefly.
