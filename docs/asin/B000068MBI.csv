704746,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B000068MBI,A Customer,"[6, 9]","There is such a thing as 'too many twists'.Summary:Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) is a high-powered lawyer that is married to Tom Kubik/Ron Chapman (James Caviezel), a former Marine turned 'collector' (I think that's what he is; they don't ever really say).  When some kids break into their house, the police take fingerprints and realize that Tom/Ron is actually a 'wanted' Marine because of his participation in the murders of some innocent peasants in El Salvador 10 some odd years before.  So, after doing their Christmas shopping one evening, Tom/Ron is arrested by the FBI and sent to a military base to await trial for murder.  Of course Claire decides she is going to defend him and picks up Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman) who has successfully defended a case against a military court before, as co-counsel.With a bunch of twists and turns, Claire eventually gets Tom/Ron free only to find out that he really was the one that did it.  In the end, Tom/Ron tries to kill her but with the help of one of the peasants that survived the attack (Emilio Rivera (I)), Tom/Ron is killed and Claire is free to set up shop with Charlie as attorneys.My Comments:In retrospect, this movie is pretty bad.  I was sort of entertained by the movie when watching it, but was never really sucked into it and was able to predict every plot twist.The major problem with the movie is that it is so contrived.  What are the chances a defense lawyer is going to marry an ex-marine in hiding that is in need of an excellent defense lawyer?  What are the chances that a peasant from that very village would live in the same city where all of this is taking place?  The kids breaking into the house at the beginning of the movie makes no sense.  And the biggest problem with the entire movie is the final twist when we find out that Tom/Ron did actually do it.  When we find this out the entire movie falls apart.  Why would the general dismiss the case?  Why would the person that Tom/Ron said did do it, Maj. James Hernandez (Juan Carlos Hern&aacute;ndez), act the way he did?  It was just too forced to be a convincing and compelling story.I should mention that Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are good in this, but then they are good in most of the films they do.  But even their decent acting can't overcome the poor story and plot.  As for James Caviezel, I don't particularly care for him as an actor and even though he was not too bad, his performance in The Count of Monte Cristo was much better than this.Overall, the movie was a let down, even though I did not have high expectations going into it.  There are much better movies out there; this one is not worth your time.",2,There is such a thing as 'too many twists'.,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,2660,"['such', 'thing', ""'too"", 'many', ""twists'.Summary"", 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'high-powered', 'lawyer', 'married', 'Tom', 'Kubik/Ron', 'Chapman', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'former', 'Marine', 'turned', ""'collector"", 'think', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'say', 'When', 'kids', 'break', 'house', 'police', 'take', 'fingerprints', 'realize', 'Tom/Ron', 'actually', ""'wanted"", 'Marine', 'participation', 'murders', 'innocent', 'peasants', 'El', 'Salvador', '10', 'odd', 'years', 'So', 'doing', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'one', 'evening', 'Tom/Ron', 'arrested', 'FBI', 'sent', 'military', 'base', 'await', 'trial', 'murder', 'course', 'Claire', 'going', 'defend', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Grimes', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'successfully', 'defended', 'case', 'military', 'court', 'before', 'co-counsel.With', 'bunch', 'twists', 'turns', 'Claire', 'eventually', 'Tom/Ron', 'free', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'was', 'one', 'did', 'end', 'Tom/Ron', 'kill', 'help', 'one', 'peasants', 'survived', 'attack', 'Emilio', 'Rivera', 'Tom/Ron', 'killed', 'Claire', 'free', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'Charlie', 'attorneys.My', 'Comments', 'retrospect', 'movie', 'pretty', 'bad', 'was', 'sort', 'entertained', 'movie', 'when', 'watching', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'sucked', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'plot', 'twist.The', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'so', 'contrived', 'What', 'are', 'chances', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'going', 'marry', 'ex-marine', 'hiding', 'need', 'excellent', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'What', 'are', 'chances', 'peasant', 'very', 'village', 'would', 'live', 'same', 'city', 'where', 'taking', 'place', 'kids', 'breaking', 'house', 'beginning', 'movie', 'sense', 'biggest', 'problem', 'entire', 'movie', 'final', 'twist', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'Tom/Ron', 'did', 'actually', 'do', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'entire', 'movie', 'apart', 'Why', 'would', 'general', 'dismiss', 'case', 'Why', 'would', 'person', 'Tom/Ron', 'said', 'did', 'do', 'Maj.', 'James', 'Hernandez', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Hern', 'aacute', 'act', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'forced', 'be', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'story.I', 'should', 'mention', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'good', 'then', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'even', 'decent', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'poor', 'story', 'plot', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'actor', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'performance', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'this.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'time']",High Crimes

I just thought that was interesting.  Ok, now back to what I thought of this film.  I was disappointed at the trailers released on TV for this film.  It kept saying ""... surprising ending"" with Jim Caviezel looming under a hallway arch.  That ruined the film for me.  I knew what the ending was going to be even before watching the film.  I watched it just to be sure anyway ;).  I think Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman work well together.  Ashley Judd plays a no nonsense lawyer trying to defend her husband Jim Caviezel in a military court on the charge of murder.  Morgan Freeman plays an ex-drunk attorney who's good at trying military cases.  Together they have to peel back the layers of deception and coverups that happened 13 years ago.This film does not have any powerfully dramatic scenes.  It felt like a cookie cutter suspense thriller (the type John Grisham would write).  In fact, at times it tries to be light and humorous.  The ending did not really provide the audience a reason to empathize with Ashley Judd's character.

704748,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000068MBI,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Sharp and intriguing and certainly entertaining, `High Crimes' has a lot going for it; most of all Ashley Judd (so underrated as an actress) and her intricate and believable performance.  The film follows a loving couple who are thrust into turmoil when the husband is accused of an atrocity thirteen years prior and is brought before military court.  His wife, a lawyer, is convinced of her husband's innocence and is determined to prove it.  `High Crimes' is a tad standard in its direction, never really pushing any envelopes and so you won't feel like this is a truly inspired piece of filmmaking, but it is remarkably solid in what it is trying to get across.  Morgan Freeman is adequate, although he seems to be stuck in a particular performance that he regurgitates time and time again, and the scenes with Michael Shannon are somewhat unsettled in the flow of the film.

704752,ALR35EFI69S5R,B000068MBI,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[6, 8]","The primary reason to see this film is the terrific acting by an ensemble cast composed of Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Jim Cavieze, and Amanda Peet. We are treated to a snapshot view of Ashley and Jim living a outrageously happy life together until suddenly and inexplicably it is shattered by his arrest for crimes committed years ago as a special forces operative in Central America under a different name, from which it appears he had been fleeing for decades. What evolves is another standard jostling of criminal minds, both offenders and lawyers, as well as those of darker forces who seem determined to railroad Jim character for reasons not immediately apparent.Yet Ashley's character is hardly defeated. Given the fact she happens to be a skilled defense lawyer, she enlists the support of Morgan Freeman, a man once known for his legal expertise but now sidelined by bouts with the bottle. He becomes the lynchpin in the defense efforts to unravel the mystery behind the scenes in order to save Ashley's husband from conviction.  It is entertaining to watch freeman and Judd play off each other, in this, their second outing together (""Kiss The Girls""). Each is a consummate dramatic actor in his or her own right, and the way they use each other to lend credence and gravity to a scene is marvelous to watch.Cavieze is also quite good, a convincing straight man who lies so well even the audience cannot tell when he is doing so. The supporting cast is also quite good, and one finds the time flying by, always an indication that the script and performances are working well.  The plot is too traditional, and fairly predictable at that, yet the characters woven by the cast catch one up into the fantasy nonetheless, and what results is an altogether enjoyable and entertaining movie experience.

As an investigator into this case in which she was too close, no way could she even think of being impartial, she traveled the world to find evidence to win her case.In El Salvador, she is givne the wrong information and she uses touch tactics with the government lawyer to expose the whole covert operation (so like the Green Berets in Vietnam) which gives her client the edge so as not to make the U. S. Marines look bad.  She pays dearly for this mistake.This whole film was Ashley Judd, and she just was not capable of carrying the show.  Making the alcoholic attorney with a suite of offices in a yellow adobe in Mexico appear incompetent was a bummer.  He was like Howell Forrester, who let drink keep him from seeing things clearly, and thus was too slow on the uptake.Seeing her strut in L.A. and outrun a Chevy truck on the streets, flying into John Wayne airport in Orange County, and generally masquerating as a real female attorney like Marcia Clark was interesting but not believable.",3,Crimes Covered Up For the Good of Who?,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,1258,"['beginning', 'star', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'Ashley', 'Judd', ""'Double"", 'Jeopardy', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'be', 'qualified', 'attorney', 'court', 'took', 'personna', 'Marcia', 'Clark', 'competent', 'defender', 'O.', 'J.', 'trial', 'century', 'investigator', 'case', 'was', 'too', 'close', 'way', 'could', 'even', 'think', 'being', 'impartial', 'traveled', 'world', 'find', 'evidence', 'win', 'case.In', 'El', 'Salvador', 'givne', 'wrong', 'information', 'touch', 'tactics', 'government', 'lawyer', 'expose', 'whole', 'covert', 'operation', 'Green', 'Berets', 'Vietnam', 'client', 'edge', 'so', 'not', 'make', 'U.', 'S.', 'Marines', 'look', 'bad', 'dearly', 'mistake.This', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'capable', 'carrying', 'show', 'Making', 'alcoholic', 'attorney', 'suite', 'offices', 'yellow', 'adobe', 'Mexico', 'appear', 'incompetent', 'was', 'bummer', 'was', 'Howell', 'Forrester', 'who', 'let', 'drink', 'keep', 'seeing', 'things', 'clearly', 'thus', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'uptake.Seeing', 'strut', 'L.A.', 'outrun', 'Chevy', 'truck', 'streets', 'flying', 'John', 'Wayne', 'airport', 'Orange', 'County', 'generally', 'masquerating', 'real', 'female', 'attorney', 'Marcia', 'Clark', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'believable']",High Crimes
704755,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B000068MBI,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[4, 6]","Disappointing courtroom thriller has an excellent Ashley Judd capitalizing on her success two years earlier in Double Jeopardy. She plays a successful attorney married to a really nice guy (Jim Caviezel) who has no particular occupation except to attempt to impregnate her in the mornings and then work in the toolshed for the rest of the day. She discovers that he actually has a past when the FBI take him into custody and accuse him of a war crime involving the murder of innocent El Salvadoran civilians that he supposedly committed when he was still a marine (and had a different name). Judd, completely perplexed and unsure of who's she even married to at this point, decides to go with her gut instinct anyway and appoints herself her husband's attorney along with the green novice (Adam Scott) they've already given him, and to make sure she fully can comprehend military law enlists the help of a wild-card washed up ex-alcoholic lawyer (Morgan Freeman, Judd's costar from the 1997 thriller Kiss The Girls). Despite the annoying setbacks (the lame subplot involving Amanda Peet as Judd's irresponsible younger sister, not to mention cloying scenes like Caviezel insisting he and his wife get it on in the lie-detector test room because *wink wink* no one's looking), the majority of the film's running plot is actually quite involving: twists and turns and incredible complications kept me riveted to the screen, desperate to find out how Judd would get herself and her family out of this incredible mess. Plus the film benefits from genuine chemistry between the lady heroine and Freeman, their characters written a slight cut above the usual Determined with a capital D freedom fighters you get in these kinds of films. Director Carl Franklin is obviously interested in making something more than just the average Hollywood thriller, something apparent from his more imaginative camera angles and editing techniques, but the film eventually takes an obvious turn in its third act that in itself reveals the film's climactic finale before it even happens, and you're left with an empty feeling like you've seen it all before.

704756,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000068MBI,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","Because Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are so comfortable working together you find yourself simply enjoying the ride in director Carl Franklin's glossy suspense thriller. Very entertaining, beautifully photographed, and with two leads easy to like, this is Hollywood entertainment at its best. It receives high marks for doing what it was designed to do.Claire (Ashley Judd) has a nice life as this film opens. A defense attorney for a respected law firm in lovely San Francisco, she and her husband Ron are trying to start a family. But when she finds herself face down on the street while her husband is taken in to police custody, who claim he is someone else, Claire's world begins to crumble. Judd does a nice job showing the mix of conflicting emotions as everything she thought she knew about her husband goes out the window. Her husband is charged with the murder of civilians in El Salvador while in uniform, and will be given a military trial. Claire believes in his innocence and when he is assigned a green 1st. Lieutenent (Adam Scott) to defend him, she knows he needs help.Enter Morgan Freeman as Charlie Grimes. He's been sober for over a year, and his sharp wit and knowledge of a military courtroom remain in tact. The chemistry between Freeman and Judd is as comfortable as our favorite old pair of jeans, allowing us to sit back and enjoy the story, without scrutinizing every plot point. The closer they get to what really happened and the cover up that goes all the way to the top, the more dangerous it becomes for them. Even when evidence they uncover is used as a bargaining chip to have the charges dropped, all is not well. Charlie has discovered something about the case in Mexico that will shed a bright light on the truth.Adapted from a Joseph Finder novel, this is sparkling entertainment.

Ashley Judd plays Claire Kubik, a lawyer on the way to a partnership until her husband is arrested for a military crime he swears he didn't commit.  To defend him, Claire must navigate military law and threats, getting in deeper and more dangerously with every half-truth she uncovers.The plot has fewer holes than most thrillers, although most viewers will see the &quot;twist&quot; a mile away.  And that a law firm would jettison one of its promising stars because her husband was arrested is preposterous.  Wouldn't they help in the defense?  Still, given the holes in most thrillers these days, these lapses are minor.  The acting is solid, with Judd creating a gutsy, smart woman who is capable of both unfaltering love and fury.  Morgan Freeman does a fine job with his thin material as a once-alcoholic lawyer who is &quot;a thorn in the military's side.&quot;  James Caveziel, as Claire's husband, is less complex; his pleading got on my nerves by the end.  Supporting roles by Amanda Peet (Claire's floozy sister) and Adam Smith (a young military lawyer) are adequate, though not highly memorable.The strength of this film is in the pacing and the seamless way in which it unfolds.

Accompanying Claire's status as a testament to her wealth is her dead-beat sister, Jackie (Amanda Peet), whom she gives money to keep her on her feet; she will later be needlessly stitched into the story for reasons beyond my comprehension.The movie picks up a slight amount of momentum when Tom is taken by FBI agents, while Claire tries desperately to uncover the charges. She is told that the man she knows to be Tom Kubik is actually named Ron Chapman, whom, she later discovers, is being accused of the murder of nine innocent civilians in a small town in Mexico during an operation to root out a nefarious terrorist. Tom/Ron persists that he is innocent, offering to take a polygraph test for Claire, and warning her of just how dangerous those surrounding her can be.So what's a gal to do? In this case, enlist the help of a local attorney who has a history with the bottle, and basically throw around some bad ... attitude and acting zeal in order to beat the bad guys. This gives Judd a chance to reunite with ""Kiss the Girls"" costar Freeman, who jumps right back into his Alex Cross persona as Charles Grimes. Together, the two uncover clues and small pieces of evidence, that which leads Claire to suspect a conspiracy aimed at bringing her husband down.The acting zeal for the film is incredible, allowing Judd and Freeman many opportunities to play off one another's smarts and shortcomings. Anyone who appreciated their performances in ""Girls"" will no doubt find a comfort zone in watching these two amazing talents resurrect their charisma.The film itself fares less well. It poses the question of Tom/Ron's innocence in a manner that is formulaic and predictable, supplying us with several tear-filled moments of tenderness between husband and wife that showcase good acting, but do nothing to deter our own theories about his character. This plot line paves the road for the film's anti-climactic conclusion, where what we suspect will happen does, and what we hope won't happen also does.And then there is the issue of the various subplots I mentioned above, from the useless involvement of Jackie to the inclusion of Grimes' problem with alcohol. Such scripting tactics are exactly the thing the film doesn't need, and yet, it sees fit to offer solutions to these problems, rather than tackle a resolution to the more intriguing matters at hand.I commend director Carl Franklin for his ability to instill some measurable suspense within the overall lacking story, but Freeman and Judd remain the sole life force of the film, playing their characters with a zeal and wit that is a welcome throwback to their previous interaction. The film wants to deal with big issues like corrupted ideals, conspiracy amongst those whose job is to serve and protect, and so on, but in the end, ""High Crimes"" is just another courtroom drama that is riddled with predictability and lackluster solutions to uninvolving problems.",2,Riddled with predictability and lackluster solutions.,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,3836,"['Proving', 'worth', 'actors', 'insatiable', 'ability', 'carry', 'substandard', 'material', 'undeserved', 'heights', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'High', 'Crimes', 'political', 'thriller', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'agendas', 'film', 'various', 'important', 'characters', 'who', 'populate', 'various', 'subplots', 'range', 'intrical', 'downright', 'place', 'problem', 'movie', 'resolve', 'outright', 'solution', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'material', 'dry.Judd', 'stars', 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'successful', 'attorney', 'who', 'San', 'Francisco', 'ex-Marine', 'husband', 'Tom', 'played', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'two', 'enjoy', 'fabulous', 'lifestyle', 'such', 'privileges', 'ability', 'engage', '[', 'intercourse', ']', 'Claire', 'trots', 'off', 'work', 'ample', 'time', 'spend', 'together', 'know', 'whole', 'happily-ever-after', 'shebang', 'Accompanying', 'Claire', 'status', 'testament', 'wealth', 'dead-beat', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'whom', 'money', 'keep', 'feet', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'needlessly', 'stitched', 'story', 'reasons', 'comprehension.The', 'movie', 'up', 'slight', 'amount', 'momentum', 'when', 'Tom', 'taken', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Claire', 'desperately', 'uncover', 'charges', 'told', 'man', 'be', 'Tom', 'Kubik', 'actually', 'named', 'Ron', 'Chapman', 'whom', 'later', 'discovers', 'being', 'accused', 'murder', 'nine', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'small', 'town', 'Mexico', 'operation', 'root', 'out', 'nefarious', 'terrorist', 'Tom/Ron', 'innocent', 'offering', 'take', 'polygraph', 'test', 'Claire', 'warning', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'surrounding', 'can', 'be.So', 'what', 'gal', 'do', 'case', 'enlist', 'help', 'local', 'attorney', 'who', 'history', 'bottle', 'basically', 'throw', 'around', 'bad', 'attitude', 'acting', 'zeal', 'order', 'beat', 'bad', 'guys', 'Judd', 'chance', 'reunite', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'costar', 'Freeman', 'who', 'jumps', 'right', 'back', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'persona', 'Charles', 'Grimes', 'Together', 'two', 'uncover', 'clues', 'small', 'pieces', 'evidence', 'Claire', 'suspect', 'conspiracy', 'aimed', 'bringing', 'husband', 'down.The', 'acting', 'zeal', 'film', 'incredible', 'allowing', 'Judd', 'Freeman', 'many', 'opportunities', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'smarts', 'shortcomings', 'Anyone', 'who', 'appreciated', 'performances', 'Girls', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'comfort', 'zone', 'watching', 'two', 'amazing', 'talents', 'resurrect', 'charisma.The', 'film', 'less', 'well', 'question', 'Tom/Ron', 'innocence', 'manner', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'supplying', 'several', 'tear-filled', 'moments', 'tenderness', 'husband', 'wife', 'showcase', 'good', 'acting', 'do', 'nothing', 'deter', 'own', 'theories', 'character', 'plot', 'line', 'road', 'film', 'anti-climactic', 'conclusion', 'where', 'what', 'suspect', 'will', 'happen', 'what', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'also', 'does.And', 'then', 'issue', 'various', 'subplots', 'mentioned', 'above', 'useless', 'involvement', 'Jackie', 'inclusion', 'Grimes', 'problem', 'alcohol', 'Such', 'scripting', 'tactics', 'are', 'exactly', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'yet', 'fit', 'offer', 'solutions', 'problems', 'rather', 'tackle', 'resolution', 'more', 'intriguing', 'matters', 'hand.I', 'commend', 'director', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'ability', 'instill', 'measurable', 'suspense', 'overall', 'lacking', 'story', 'Freeman', 'Judd', 'remain', 'sole', 'life', 'force', 'film', 'playing', 'characters', 'zeal', 'wit', 'welcome', 'throwback', 'previous', 'interaction', 'film', 'deal', 'big', 'issues', 'corrupted', 'ideals', 'conspiracy', 'amongst', 'job', 'serve', 'protect', 'so', 'end', 'High', 'Crimes', 'just', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'riddled', 'predictability', 'lackluster', 'solutions', 'uninvolving', 'problems']",High Crimes

704775,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000068MBI,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd (""Kiss the Girls"") team up again in this courtroom thriller, which is entertaining despite its worn plot and obvious ending.  The reason it doesn't descend to a level consistent with the screenplay's unoriginality is the superior acting by the three principal performers.Claire (Ashley Judd) and Tom (James Caviezel) are living an idyllic and romantic married life, trying hard to have a baby.  Everything is going swimmingly until one day Tom is arrested and charged with murder and war crimes dating back to his military service and raid in El Salvatore years earlier.  It seems Tom's entire identity is a lie and his name is really Ron Chapman, a former Special Forces commando.Claire, who is conveniently a prominent defense lawyer, takes up his case determined to prove he is innocent, choosing to believe his denials despite the fact that everything she knows about him is a fabrication.  She hires Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman) to assist her because until he became a broken down alcoholic, he was once one of the top lawyers in the military.The film is paced well and balanced between courtroom drama and other related storylines like constant death threats, a dirty general and a mystery man.  It is fairly standard fare, but the presentation is engaging.Morgan Freeman is such a terrific actor, that even a trite script can't keep him down.  He is wily and insolent as the washed up lawyer with a few tricks left up his sleeve.  Freeman projects an unassuming power in his work, full of dynamism yet highly amiable.  His interaction with Judd is wonderful, treating her with avuncular kindness and intellectual respect.Ashley Judd is a fine dramatic actor, who returns to serious drama after an ill advised detour into romantic comedy (""Someone Like You"").  Judd is razor sharp in this film, coming across as bright, energetic and passionate.  She is tough as nails and doesn't back down to pompous military officers or thugs trying to intimidate her.Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused.  This is a tough character because he is so mysterious and duplicitous.  Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in ""Angel Eyes"", so he had some experience with this type of role.  He handles the part well, appearing utterly sincere whether his character is telling the truth or not.Amanda Peet gives her standard performance as Claire's hair brained and sex obsessed sister.  Peet is no serious dramatic talent, but she has this character down and comes across as believably ditzy and concerned about her sister despite their obvious sibling rivalry.This film doesn't fool anyone with its surprise ending, but it does deliver good suspense, a tried and true formula and some excellent performances.  I rated it a 7/10.

Apparently so do the two of them - because Judd was brought this project and requested that Freeman be brought on board.This movie isn't bad - not bad at all - it's just predictable.Judd's character and her husband (Jim Cavaziel) are lovey dovey (so you know something bad is going to happen to them) in love.  What happens is her husband is arrested by the FBI and the military for mass murder.  This is a big deal.  Judd, being a famed defense lawyer, takes it upon herself to defend him in military court.  She and everyone else knows that he has been framed.  Or has he?Freeman plays a former JAG corp lawyer who is now a recovering alocholic and assists Judd's character with the case.The film is interesting and has some really exciting scenes, but even they weren't presented as well or as suspenseful as they could have been (I blame this on the director and editor, not the actors).Speaking of the director...There are times when I really liked what he did with the film and others I didn't.  One of the really neat things I liked was that on several occasions he did this ""rough close up"" (my term) effect that I haven't seen utilized since the old Dirty Harry and Bullitt type movies of the 1970's.  It's really kind of cool and fit in this film.  It's just a shame that there wasn't more action here.  A decent car chase scene built into this film would have fit.  There is one, but it's just a few seconds long (shame).This film just wasn't enough to satisfy my appettite.  It was too predictable and the audience only got to really know the lead characters well.  It would have helped if we'd had more character data on the ""villains"" and been sent down a few more wrong paths and provided more red herrings.I did like this film, but I know that so much more could have been done with it.  I'm absolutely nuts about the two leads and I'd pay to see them read the newspaper aloud, but Hollywood really needs to pair the two of them up in an action packed action thriller.

And if a movie is called predictable that's generally seen as a put-down. But of all the hit-and-miss efforts to make something that won't incur that label, some make good old tried-and-true formulae and predictability look not so bad by comparison. One device that can invite a misfire that would make predictability look better is that of twist endings. A few years ago, PRIMAL FEAR was the first movie in which a twist ending made me feel cheated out of the very movie premise I had bought into. I just invested too much energy into the body of the movie taken at face value. Then when the ending turned all that on its head, I felt that the heart of my movie-going experience was jerked out from under me. The same didn't happen again for a while, but just recently, the phenomenon seems back with a vengeance. With FRAILTY, MURDER BY NUMBERS, and now HIGH CRIMES, movies have got me really on overload with the ending that says, ""And now we're going to undermine you're whole movie experience that you just underwent.""

They are living the perfect life until one night, while sleeping; their home is broken into by a couple of teenagers.From the break in scene, we roll into a night out shopping.

We then find out that he's been picked up by the military and accused of a war crime.

704810,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000068MBI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","""High Crimes"" was one of those movies that just started pushing the wrong buttons on me, which surprised me because usually any film with Morgan Freeman in it is going to be a safe bet.  The man is one of the finest actors around and his playing God in the new Jim Carey movie would probably be considered typecasting by everyone who has worked with him.  But I am not going to blame him for why I got on the wrong side of this movie, nor am I going to point a finger at screenwriters Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley, becaue I am pretty sure the objectionable elements were in the original novel by Joseph Finder.Freeman is paired with Ashley Judd in this 2002 film, five years after they worked together in ""Kiss the Girls.""  However, this time Judd does the heavy lifting and the basic premise is quite compelling.  Judd plays Claire Kubik, a defense attorney whose is about to make partner at a big law firm.  Life is good.  But then her husband is arrested by the FBI and changed with having murdered civilians is El Salvador when he was in the Army.  That is only half the shock, because Claire also finds out that he married her under an assumed name.  Her husband is going to be court-martialed for the massacre and if found guilty he will be sentenced to death.  But when she sees the young first lieutenant (Adam Scott) assigned to defend the case, she makes herself co-counsel, and, to help her understand the playing field, she tracks down Charlie Grimes (Freeman), an ex-military lawyer and recovering alcoholic.The character's alcoholism is one of the aforementioned buttons, because of course the sobriety of Grimes comes into play.  I will grant that the situation is contrived well in terms of the plot, but contrivance becomes the key word to describe this plot element.  The net benefit is a mild sense of concern because, well, Grimes is played by Morgan Freeman and is clearly a good guy.  The other button that gets pushed is that ""High Crimes"" is another one of these films were the United States military is portrayed as being psychopathic killers.  Not only that, they are INCOMPETENCE psychopathic killers.  Claire's husband claims somebody else is to blame and that there is a conspiracy going on and eventually she starts getting too close to the truth and shadowy figures try to take care of her in a way that is ultimately guaranteed to shine even more publicity on this case.  Fortunately, some of the shadowy figures are on Claire's side.I want to point out that my disdain for the U.S. military being portrayed as incompetent psychopathic killers existed long before the war to liberate Iraq.  Just as I got tired of villains turning out to be Nazis and drug crazed Vietnam vets, I am already tired of villains being ultra-right military men whose ideological beliefs overwhelms their professionalism and sense of morality.  Claire's husband says the real killer is a guy named Hernandez (Juan Carlos Hern&aacute;ndez), now a Major, who looks brazenly homicidal.  But the military is covering things up apparently, so it is not a big deal.Judd's performance is what hold the movie together on these terms.  She might be questioning everything her husband ever told her since the day they met but in the courtroom here legal instincts take over.  Every motion she makes might be denied, but she knows how to dissect witnesses with a nice combination of sharp questions and pointed attitude.  This is one of those films where it ain't over until its over, so I was ticked off, but I was also entertained, so if you have different buttons than I do you will obviously enjoy this film more than I did.  Also, a tip of the hat to Tom Bower as FBI Special Agent Mullins, who gets off some nice shots during a scene with Claire on a park bench; always nice to see a veteran actor milk his little scene for everything it is worth.",4,Ashley Judd was good but this movie pushed my buttons,1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,3852,"['High', 'Crimes', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'started', 'pushing', 'wrong', 'buttons', 'surprised', 'usually', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'going', 'be', 'safe', 'bet', 'man', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'playing', 'God', 'new', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'considered', 'typecasting', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'blame', 'why', 'got', 'wrong', 'side', 'movie', 'am', 'going', 'point', 'finger', 'screenwriters', 'Yuri', 'Zeltser', 'Cary', 'Bickley', 'becaue', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'objectionable', 'elements', 'were', 'original', 'novel', 'Joseph', 'Finder.Freeman', 'paired', 'Ashley', 'Judd', '2002', 'film', 'five', 'years', 'worked', 'together', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'However', 'time', 'Judd', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'basic', 'premise', 'quite', 'compelling', 'Judd', 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'defense', 'attorney', 'make', 'partner', 'big', 'law', 'firm', 'Life', 'good', 'then', 'husband', 'arrested', 'FBI', 'changed', 'having', 'murdered', 'civilians', 'El', 'Salvador', 'when', 'was', 'Army', 'only', 'shock', 'Claire', 'also', 'out', 'married', 'assumed', 'name', 'husband', 'going', 'be', 'court-martialed', 'massacre', 'found', 'guilty', 'will', 'be', 'sentenced', 'death', 'when', 'young', 'first', 'lieutenant', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'assigned', 'defend', 'case', 'co-counsel', 'help', 'understand', 'playing', 'field', 'down', 'Charlie', 'Grimes', 'Freeman', 'ex-military', 'lawyer', 'recovering', 'alcoholic.The', 'character', 'alcoholism', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'buttons', 'course', 'sobriety', 'Grimes', 'play', 'will', 'grant', 'situation', 'contrived', 'well', 'terms', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'key', 'word', 'describe', 'plot', 'element', 'net', 'benefit', 'mild', 'sense', 'concern', 'well', 'Grimes', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'clearly', 'good', 'guy', 'other', 'button', 'pushed', 'High', 'Crimes', 'one', 'films', 'were', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'portrayed', 'being', 'psychopathic', 'killers', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'INCOMPETENCE', 'psychopathic', 'killers', 'Claire', 'husband', 'somebody', 'else', 'blame', 'conspiracy', 'going', 'eventually', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'truth', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'try', 'take', 'care', 'way', 'ultimately', 'guaranteed', 'shine', 'even', 'more', 'publicity', 'case', 'Fortunately', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'are', 'Claire', 'side.I', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'disdain', 'U.S.', 'military', 'being', 'portrayed', 'incompetent', 'psychopathic', 'killers', 'existed', 'long', 'war', 'liberate', 'Iraq', 'Just', 'got', 'tired', 'villains', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'Nazis', 'drug', 'crazed', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'am', 'already', 'tired', 'villains', 'being', 'ultra-right', 'military', 'men', 'ideological', 'beliefs', 'overwhelms', 'professionalism', 'sense', 'morality', 'Claire', 'husband', 'real', 'killer', 'guy', 'named', 'Hernandez', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Hern', 'aacute', 'now', 'Major', 'who', 'brazenly', 'homicidal', 'military', 'covering', 'things', 'up', 'apparently', 'not', 'big', 'deal.Judd', 'performance', 'what', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'terms', 'might', 'be', 'questioning', 'everything', 'husband', 'ever', 'told', 'day', 'met', 'courtroom', 'here', 'legal', 'instincts', 'take', 'over', 'motion', 'might', 'be', 'denied', 'how', 'dissect', 'witnesses', 'nice', 'combination', 'sharp', 'questions', 'pointed', 'attitude', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'ai', ""n't"", 'was', 'ticked', 'off', 'was', 'also', 'entertained', 'so', 'have', 'different', 'buttons', 'do', 'will', 'obviously', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'Also', 'tip', 'hat', 'Tom', 'Bower', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Mullins', 'who', 'off', 'nice', 'shots', 'scene', 'Claire', 'park', 'bench', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'veteran', 'actor', 'milk', 'little', 'scene', 'everything', 'worth']",High Crimes

She's living the perfect life-until the day FBI agents trap her and her husband out on the street right before Christmas.  Within seconds, a flash-bang goes off and Claire finds herself facedown in the street, watching helplessly as her husband Tom is handcuffed and taken into custody at gunpoint.  By the next morning, Claire learns that the FBI took Tom in because they claimed he was Ron Chapman.  Chapman is wanted for military desertion and for murdering civilians in a Special Forces operation in El Salvador.  Since Tom/Chapman is a soldier, his fate has to be determined in a military court of law.  Out of her depth for the moment, unsatisfied with the young lieutenant that has been assigned to defend her husband, Claire looks for another lawyer who has experience dealing with military courts.  She finds Charlie Grimes, a down-and-out recovering alcoholic who has been booted out of the Marines himself for conduct unbecoming an officer (he slept with his superior's wife).  Together, Claire and Charlie pursue the tangled and twisted trail of secrets while up against a literal army of men who will only stop short of killing them.  One secret leads to another, and soon the incident that prompted Tom's arrest is much larger, capable of bringing down a military general and causing more murders.Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman acted together in KISS THE GIRLS, the first Alex Cross novel by best-selling author James Patterson to be filmed.  Judd has also starred in DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD, WHERE THE HEART IS, EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, DOUBLE JEOPADY, and is slated to star in CATWOMAN, a movie about the costumed superhero.  Freeman has starred in THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, ALONG CAME A SPIDER, DEEP IMPACT, HARD RAIN, and CHAIN REACTION.  The director, Carl Franklin, has directed ONE FALSE MOVE, NOWHERE TO RUN, and DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS.Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are excellent in their craft and those skills come to the forefront in HIGH CRIMES.  Judd stars as a very successful attorney with a corner office in a big firm and comes across dynamically in that role.  She knows how to stage a power play and how to be the debutante at a large social event.  At the other end of the spectrum, she also knows how to play the victim (after she's attacked by masked invaders) and the frightened wife (when she first learns of her husband's arrest, and again when she realizes that she really doesn't know her husband well).  Freeman plays seedy recovering alcoholic attorney Charlie Grimes to a tee, then smoothly steps into the role of an experienced trial attorney facing the double-barreled threat of the military court.  The action in the movies comes across smartly paced, moving through the progression of things getting worse and worse, while at the same time the twists and turns the plot takes leaves the watcher uncertain who to trust and exactly how much that person can be trusted.  Both Freeman and Judd's characters have important driving missions to accomplish, but Judd manages to steal the show several times, due in part to the script and in part because she is a fantastic actress.  All of the plot points are developed, and every character in the film is a worthwhile investment for the watcher.  Everyone is under the microscope in this thriller, and that's exactly how it should be.  The additional materials included on the DVD include an interview with the author of the book, HIGH CRIMES, on which the movie was based that is a very good piece, showing the difference between the movie and the book.  An interesting note is that Joseph Finder also had a cameo in the movie-with his head shaved.  Another featurette covers the differences between civilian and military courts that is an excellent presentation.As good as this movie was, there were a couple issues that got glossed over.  After fourteen years passed, why would the Marines be so concerned over Chapman's story that they would break even more laws by intimidating and then trying to kill Claire Kubik?  Also, not all of the movie's villains get the comeuppance they so richly deserved.  At the finale, though it seems impossible, Freeman and Judd should have been together to face the end together.Fans of Judd's and Freeman's work on KISS THE GIRLS will want to add this gem of a thriller movie to their personal collection.  People who want a relatively bloodless edge-of-the-seat thriller with a rock-solid mystery will want to see this one.  Definitely worth an evening's entertainment for legal film fans or for a couple wanting a his-and-her movie that delivers on both ends.",4,A Chilling Thriller,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,4747,"['High-powered', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'model', 'success', 'blend', 'wit', 'charm', 'intelligence', 'sexy', 'looks', 'living', 'perfect', 'life-until', 'day', 'FBI', 'agents', 'trap', 'husband', 'out', 'street', 'right', 'Christmas', 'Within', 'flash-bang', 'Claire', 'facedown', 'street', 'watching', 'helplessly', 'husband', 'Tom', 'handcuffed', 'taken', 'custody', 'gunpoint', 'next', 'morning', 'Claire', 'FBI', 'took', 'Tom', 'claimed', 'was', 'Ron', 'Chapman', 'Chapman', 'wanted', 'military', 'desertion', 'murdering', 'civilians', 'Special', 'Forces', 'operation', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Tom/Chapman', 'soldier', 'fate', 'be', 'determined', 'military', 'court', 'law', 'depth', 'moment', 'unsatisfied', 'young', 'lieutenant', 'been', 'assigned', 'defend', 'husband', 'Claire', 'lawyer', 'who', 'experience', 'dealing', 'military', 'courts', 'Charlie', 'Grimes', 'down-and-out', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'been', 'booted', 'Marines', 'conduct', 'unbecoming', 'officer', 'slept', 'superior', 'wife', 'Together', 'Claire', 'Charlie', 'pursue', 'tangled', 'twisted', 'trail', 'secrets', 'up', 'literal', 'army', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'only', 'stop', 'short', 'killing', 'One', 'secret', 'soon', 'incident', 'prompted', 'Tom', 'arrest', 'much', 'larger', 'capable', 'bringing', 'down', 'military', 'general', 'causing', 'more', 'murders.Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'acted', 'together', 'KISS', 'THE', 'GIRLS', 'first', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'novel', 'best-selling', 'author', 'James', 'Patterson', 'be', 'filmed', 'Judd', 'also', 'starred', 'DEVINE', 'SECRETS', 'THE', 'YA-YA', 'SISTERHOOD', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'HEART', 'IS', 'EYE', 'THE', 'BEHOLDER', 'DOUBLE', 'JEOPADY', 'slated', 'star', 'CATWOMAN', 'movie', 'costumed', 'superhero', 'Freeman', 'starred', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'ALONG', 'CAME', 'A', 'SPIDER', 'DEEP', 'IMPACT', 'HARD', 'RAIN', 'CHAIN', 'REACTION', 'director', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'directed', 'ONE', 'FALSE', 'MOVE', 'NOWHERE', 'TO', 'RUN', 'DEVIL', 'IN', 'A', 'BLUE', 'DRESS.Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'excellent', 'craft', 'skills', 'come', 'forefront', 'HIGH', 'CRIMES', 'Judd', 'very', 'successful', 'attorney', 'corner', 'office', 'big', 'firm', 'across', 'dynamically', 'role', 'how', 'stage', 'power', 'play', 'how', 'be', 'debutante', 'large', 'social', 'event', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'also', 'how', 'play', 'victim', 'attacked', 'masked', 'invaders', 'frightened', 'wife', 'when', 'first', 'husband', 'arrest', 'again', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'husband', 'well', 'Freeman', 'seedy', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'attorney', 'Charlie', 'Grimes', 'tee', 'then', 'smoothly', 'steps', 'role', 'experienced', 'trial', 'attorney', 'facing', 'double-barreled', 'threat', 'military', 'court', 'action', 'movies', 'smartly', 'paced', 'moving', 'progression', 'things', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'same', 'time', 'twists', 'plot', 'watcher', 'uncertain', 'who', 'trust', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'Freeman', 'Judd', 'characters', 'have', 'important', 'driving', 'missions', 'accomplish', 'Judd', 'steal', 'show', 'several', 'times', 'due', 'part', 'script', 'part', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'watcher', 'Everyone', 'microscope', 'thriller', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'additional', 'materials', 'included', 'DVD', 'include', 'interview', 'author', 'book', 'HIGH', 'CRIMES', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'very', 'good', 'piece', 'showing', 'difference', 'movie', 'book', 'interesting', 'note', 'Joseph', 'Finder', 'also', 'had', 'cameo', 'movie-with', 'head', 'shaved', 'featurette', 'differences', 'civilian', 'military', 'courts', 'excellent', 'presentation.As', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'were', 'couple', 'issues', 'got', 'glossed', 'fourteen', 'years', 'passed', 'why', 'would', 'Marines', 'be', 'so', 'concerned', 'Chapman', 'story', 'would', 'break', 'even', 'more', 'laws', 'intimidating', 'then', 'trying', 'kill', 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'Also', 'not', 'movie', 'villains', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved', 'finale', 'impossible', 'Freeman', 'Judd', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'face', 'end', 'together.Fans', 'Judd', 'Freeman', 'work', 'KISS', 'THE', 'GIRLS', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'gem', 'thriller', 'movie', 'personal', 'collection', 'People', 'who', 'want', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'thriller', 'rock-solid', 'mystery', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'Definitely', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'legal', 'film', 'fans', 'couple', 'wanting', 'his-and-her', 'movie', 'ends']",High Crimes

704822,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000068MBI,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 6]","THE CASE: High Crimes begins with grainy footage of a bunch of bodies lined up in a grungy town, while an elderly woman wails over and over.  We flash back to the happy marriage of Claire (Ashley Judd) and Tom Kubik (James Caviezel) who are trying to start a family.  She's a successful lawyer; he's a successful Marine.  Their life is disrupted by a break-in by some punks.In a trend that is highly representative of the disjointed plotline of High Crimes, Tom is suddenly arrested.  Tom's name is actually Sergeant Ron Chapman, and he is wanted for the execution of a bunch of people in another country. But Tom/Ron proclaims his innocence, complicated by the fact that Claire is pregnant.So Claire buckles down.  She decides to stand by her man and act as counsel on the case after meeting Ron's defense, Lieutenant Terrence Embry (Adam Scott), a newbie for sure.  Claire's not dumb; she knows she needs help.  She pulls in Dr. Alex Cross...I mean Charles W. Grimes, played by Morgan Freeman.  Complicating things is Jackie (Amanda Peet), Claire's sister.I'm bringing High Crimes up on charges of opaque plot points, awful stereotypes, and worst of all, just being plain boring.  The charges are as follows:HIGH CRIME #1: Using Grimes' alcoholism for laughs.  It's not funny and it's insulting to alcoholics.HIGH CRIME #2: Portraying the Marines as bloodthirsty, incompetent thugs who terrorize women and the downtrodden. It's offensive to just about everyone in the armed forces.HIGH CRIME #3: The Jackie character doesn't need to be in the movie. Peet's sole purpose is apparently to walk around in underwear so that Judd doesn't have to.HIGH CRIME #4: Idiotic clues.  Ambidextrous people do NOT all throw things back and forth in their hands; that is certainly not indicative of a person being a criminal.  Worse, in the flashback sequences, the main bad guy tosses an AK-47 (not an easy weapon to toss around) back and forth in his hands.  All to demonstrate he's ambidextrous and therefore the killer.HIGH CRIME #5: A long, drawn-out (115 minute) plot with a depressing conclusion that doesn't make up for any of the nonsense we had to put up with to get to the end.LESSER CHARGES: Unbelievable plot points (a civilian lawyer defending her military husband?), choppy editing (what does the break-in have to do with anything?), cheesy music that telegraphs When Bad Things Are About to Happen (TM), characters that appear out of nowhere and then disappear until conveniently needed, and really stupid terror tactics by the shadowy bad guys.Your honor, I find High Crimes guilty of all of the above charges and recommend both Judd and Freeman be given better acting opportunities, Yuri Zelster and Grace Cary Bickley sent to writing school, and director Carl Franklin sentenced to acting in the Alf Christmas Special...again.",2,Guilty as charged,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2831,"['CASE', 'High', 'Crimes', 'grainy', 'footage', 'bunch', 'bodies', 'lined', 'up', 'grungy', 'town', 'elderly', 'woman', 'over', 'flash', 'back', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Claire', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Tom', 'Kubik', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'start', 'family', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'successful', 'Marine', 'life', 'disrupted', 'break-in', 'punks.In', 'trend', 'highly', 'representative', 'disjointed', 'plotline', 'High', 'Crimes', 'Tom', 'suddenly', 'arrested', 'Tom', 'name', 'actually', 'Sergeant', 'Ron', 'Chapman', 'wanted', 'execution', 'bunch', 'people', 'country', 'Tom/Ron', 'innocence', 'complicated', 'fact', 'Claire', 'pregnant.So', 'Claire', 'down', 'stand', 'man', 'act', 'counsel', 'case', 'meeting', 'Ron', 'defense', 'Lieutenant', 'Terrence', 'Embry', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'newbie', 'sure', 'Claire', 'not', 'dumb', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'mean', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Grimes', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Complicating', 'things', 'Jackie', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Claire', 'sister.I', ""'m"", 'bringing', 'High', 'Crimes', 'up', 'charges', 'opaque', 'plot', 'points', 'awful', 'stereotypes', 'worst', 'just', 'being', 'plain', 'boring', 'charges', 'are', 'HIGH', 'CRIME', '1', 'Using', 'Grimes', 'alcoholism', 'laughs', 'not', 'funny', 'insulting', 'alcoholics.HIGH', 'CRIME', '2', 'Portraying', 'Marines', 'bloodthirsty', 'incompetent', 'thugs', 'who', 'terrorize', 'women', 'downtrodden', 'offensive', 'just', 'everyone', 'armed', 'forces.HIGH', 'CRIME', '3', 'Jackie', 'character', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'Peet', 'sole', 'purpose', 'apparently', 'walk', 'underwear', 'Judd', ""n't"", 'have', 'to.HIGH', 'CRIME', '4', 'Idiotic', 'clues', 'Ambidextrous', 'people', 'do', 'NOT', 'throw', 'things', 'back', 'forth', 'hands', 'certainly', 'not', 'indicative', 'person', 'being', 'criminal', 'Worse', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'AK-47', 'not', 'easy', 'weapon', 'toss', 'around', 'back', 'forth', 'hands', 'demonstrate', 'ambidextrous', 'therefore', 'killer.HIGH', 'CRIME', '5', 'long', 'drawn-out', '115', 'minute', 'plot', 'depressing', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'nonsense', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'get', 'end.LESSER', 'CHARGES', 'Unbelievable', 'plot', 'points', 'civilian', 'lawyer', 'defending', 'military', 'husband', 'choppy', 'editing', 'break-in', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'cheesy', 'music', 'telegraphs', 'When', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Are', 'Happen', 'TM', 'characters', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'then', 'disappear', 'conveniently', 'needed', 'really', 'stupid', 'terror', 'tactics', 'shadowy', 'bad', 'guys.Your', 'honor', 'find', 'High', 'Crimes', 'guilty', 'above', 'charges', 'recommend', 'Judd', 'Freeman', 'be', 'given', 'better', 'acting', 'opportunities', 'Yuri', 'Zelster', 'Grace', 'Cary', 'Bickley', 'sent', 'writing', 'school', 'director', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'sentenced', 'acting', 'Alf', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'again']",High Crimes

I know they have a number of collaborations under their belts, but more are needed.  Come on, people!  Get on this!  Anyway, in this installment of this fine partnership, Ashley Judd plays a woman/lawyer who's husband is suddenly arrested and revealed to be a wanted war criminal living under an assumed name.  Believing the pleas of innocence coming from the man who's real name she's only just learned, Jud recruits Morgan Freeman to help her navigate the inner workings of a military court, where the ballgame is quite different from the civilian courts.  Okay, so the first half of this film was great and interesting...but then it began to get crazy with conspiracies and cover-ups that just served to confuse me.  Personally, I'm never really a fan of these sorts of things which end up including factors like ""how high up the conspiracy reaches within the organization"" and ""who is left to trust"".  Also, the ending felt like one big cop out.  Did someone just read the script halfway through production and realize the original ending just wouldn't work given everything else that had already been thrown in?  It almost made the movie redundant.  I know this is based on a novel, and I will probably read that novel just to see if the ending's the same.  Maybe it works better on paper, but it just didn't do it for me in this film.  I do recommend it because Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are awesome regardless.  They are just always worth watching.  And I have to admit, after the cop out ending, their final scene together is amusing, even if it is just a bit clich&eacute;...again, they make it work so well.

704836,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000068MBI,Reviewer,"[4, 6]","What do you do when life throws you a curve, when you're blind-sided by a situation totally out of the blue, a situation unbelievable and inexplicable that has to do with the past of the person you love most in the whole world?  A past of which you've never had so much as a hint or knew existed?  It's a situation that is examined by director Carl Franklin in ""High Crimes,"" a film that is part courtroom drama, part suspense/thriller (with emphasis on the latter), and which illustrates the facility with which the black and white definition of someone's life can in a moment be tainted and overwhelmed by shades of gray.  And it becomes, then, a story about courage and commitment, and most importantly, trust and truth, the basic ingredients that make up the mortar that holds our society and our very lives together; and as this film points out, if the mixture of that mortar is not pure, it is a very tentative seal, indeed, that binds us together.Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) seemingly has the perfect life; she's a successful criminal defense attorney (about to become a partner in the firm), has a beautiful home in the San Francisco Bay area and a wonderful husband, Tom (James Caviezel), with whom she is hoping to have a baby soon, which would make her life complete.  Then suddenly, it all comes crashing down around her, when Tom is arrested by the F.B.I. and charged with murder.  And, as if that's not bad enough, it's a military case-- Tom is facing a court martial stemming from an incident in 1988 when Tom was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.The incident occurred in El Salvador; after the bombing of a restaurant in which three Americans were killed, a detachment of Marines-- Tom's unit-- was sent to a small village in pursuit of the rebel terrorist responsible for the bombing.  According to the military intelligence that had been gathered, the villagers there would have information about the perpetrator.  But as the interrogations began, things went bad somehow, and some of the villagers ended up dead.  And fingers pointed to Tom as the shooter.Claire, of course, believes that Tom is innocent, and decides to take on the case-- and the military-- herself.  She feels confident in her ability to defend him and get to the truth.  After all, she has a strong case-- if only she can uncover the identity of the real shooter, then prove it in a court of law that operates within parameters that extend beyond her personal frame of reference.As can be expected with a film like this, there is much more to it than meets the eye, and director Franklin does a great job of putting his characters (and his audience) through their paces with it.  There are a number of forks in the road along the way to the climax, and he puts them all to good use, building the tension and maintaining it right up to the very end.  He spends just enough time in the courtroom scenes to make them effective; he does not dwell on them nor linger there.  Instead, he keeps most of the story elsewhere, which works well, because that's where the action and the thrills reside.  Most importantly, he keeps it all moving right along and keeps you guessing; he never tips his hand too soon, and it makes for some riveting suspense.Franklin knows how to handle his actors, too, and he gets some first rate performances out of them, especially from Judd and Morgan Freeman, who are great on-screen together (as they were in their previous collaboration, ""Kiss the Girls,"" in 1997).  Judd is charismatic and has a down-to-earth persona she manages to bring to whatever character she is playing that enables the audience to connect with her.  Her Claire is professional, but well grounded-- which gives something of a fresh face to the usual portrayal of lawyers in film, and she's entirely convincing, which, of course, adds much to the credibility of the story.  As with any good actor, the essence of her character can be found in her eyes, which honestly reflects who this person really is.  Judd gives so much more than a by-the-numbers performance, and she gets results accordingly; Claire is very real, and because of that, you care what happens to her.As Charlie Grimes, the former Marine lawyer (who back in the day had more than some trouble with the system of military justice) now in a less-than-thriving private practice, Morgan Freeman effectively creates a memorable character, bringing that extra something to the part-- as he has in films throughout his career-- with yet another excellent performance.  Freeman has a natural quality that comes through so well on screen (as it certainly does here), he always gives his best, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.  A good job from one of the finest actors around.Caviezel also does a convincing turn as Tom, as does Adam Scott, as Lt. Terrence Embry, the young attorney assigned by the Marines to Tom's case, and Amanda Peet, as Jackie Grimaldi, Claire's somewhat irresponsible sister.The supporting cast includes Tom Bower (Agent Mullins), Michael Gaston (Waldron), Juan Carlos Hernandez (Hernandez), Jude Ciccolella (Farrell) and Emilio Rivera (Attacker).  A well crafted and delivered thriller that will get and keep you emotionally involved, ""High Crimes"" is entertaining, but frustrating, as well.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat while taunting you with the absolutes of a military tribunal that makes the term ""Military justice"" seem like an oxymoron; there are times, in fact, when you'll want to yell at the screen and plead for someone or other to use some common sense and acknowledge the proof of what's placed right in front of them.  But it's all a part of the ride, and it's a good one; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies.",4,Good Drama Laced With Thrills,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,5722,"['What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'life',

Any diehard movie goer would be able to see where this movie is heading and how it is going to end. It appears Director Franklin doesn't appreciate the intellegence of his audience and lays in too many little give-aways.The story: Attorney Ashley Judd is married to a chap who has years earlier assumed a new identity to escape military justice. She discovers this interesting facet of his personality when the FBI jumps on them and takes him away to face murder charges at a military court martial. He is accused of killing citizens in a raid on a El Salvador village while in the Marine Corps. After reeling with shock that her husband is some other guy Ashley settles down and decides she will stand by him. Not only stand by him, but defend him. A court martial being out of her groove she contacts an attorney with military experience. Enter Morgan Freeman. Up to this point the story has been very good, leaving me wondering: ""How would I deal with this situation? What would I do?""Now the movie shifts gears and the most interesting part is not the story which involves the court martial and dealing with the military mind, but the interaction between Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.

Morgan Freeman costars as the typical gone-to-seed, down-on-his-luck (but, we are told, brilliant) lawyer who has lost both reputation and career to the ravages of alcoholism.As in most films of this ilk, the military in ""High Crimes"" emerges as little more than a hotbed of skullduggery and corruption, with the top brass issuing unethical and undoubtedly illegal orders, then doing everything it can do make sure the facts surrounding those activities remain forever hidden from public view - even stooping to rubbing out uncooperative witnesses if necessary.  As a whodunit, ""High Crimes"" follows a fairly predictable path filled with the inevitable false clues, misunderstandings and, of course, the surprise ""twist"" ending, which really isn't a surprise at all to anyone even remotely familiar with the way this kind of story operates.  ""High Crimes,"" though watchable, is also depressingly efficient in that it simply goes through the motions without injecting anything even remotely original or surprising into the proceedings.  With a sinister figure lurking in every shadow and a red herring hiding around every corner, we soon grow weary of the sheer predictability of the whole enterprise.  There literally is not a single original minute in the entire film.""High Crimes"" isn't bad enough to make anyone jump up out of his seat in outrage - unless it happens to be the military, which certainly has every reason to feel affronted in this case.  Luckily, Judd and Freeman are good enough actors that they can make even this mediocre material seem better than it is.

In a word, this film is a great disappointment.The plot is about a first-rate lawyer Claire Kubik (Judd) whose life changes out of the blue when her beloved husband is arrested on the street of San Fransico by FBI.  Her love Jim Caviezel, it is claimed, is in fact an ex-marine who is once charged for killing innocent civilians during the mission in El Salvador.  Claire stands up for her husband, now in unfamiliar territory of military court, with a help from Morgan Freeman's laywer Grimes, but she soon finds out that ""Everything You trust, Everything You Know, May be a Lie,"" as the tugline of the film goes.The film treads on every clithed method of spending time, like some made-for-TV thriller, and practically what it shows on the screen is only the basics of story without any added skills or flavor.  There is no time for us to be drawn into this too rudimentary storyline, as we only observe the progress of the ""case,"" which is too busy to explain itself before the audience.  The ""by the number"" fashion of unfolding the story is too painful to watch for all the good cast thrown in this film.If you think my review too unkind, compare this with such works as ""Rules of Engagement"" by William Friedkin.  The latter is a  flawed film, but knows how to generate tension of the war, make the audience fell the need for the characters to regain their  lost dignity, and most of all, the atomosphere of the court scenes, which are sadly lacking in ""High Crimes.""  Surely we are told here that in the military world, it is not ""judge"", but ""investigating officier""; it is not ""jury"", but ""members.""  However, this image of rigid, strict, by-the-book authority of the marine is not fully developed, and the case ends somehow in a disappointing way.  Like this (at first) promising sides of the film, many things pop up in the film, only to be wasted in a half-baked way; we see romance, we see war; we see the court; we see Amanda Peet as a vivacious sister of Clair, but none of them work, probably because of the pointless development of them.Freeman shows unexpected comical side with his acting as a down-and-out lawyer, and Judd herself is good (but often painful to watch, again after ""Kiss the Girls"") but those two cannot save the too routine storytelling of the film.  Even the location of San Fransisco and its dry, moody picture cannot help much in this low patches of ""High Crimes""",2,"High Expectations, Low Results: Mediocre Thriller from Judd",1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2705,"['critically', 'praised', 'Devil', 'Blue', 'Dress', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'High', 'Crimes', 'inferior', 'respect', 'story', 'predictable', 'characters', 'unmemorable', 'even', 'acting', 'side', 'reliable', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'not-so-impressive', 'hitman', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'former', 'word', 'film', 'great', 'disappointment.The', 'plot', 'first-rate', 'lawyer', 'Claire', 'Kubik', 'Judd', 'life', 'blue', 'when', 'beloved', 'husband', 'arrested', 'street', 'San', 'Fransico', 'FBI', 'love', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'claimed', 'fact', 'ex-marine', 'who', 'once', 'charged', 'killing', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'mission', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Claire', 'up', 'husband', 'now', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'military', 'court', 'help', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'laywer', 'Grimes', 'soon', 'out', 'Everything', 'trust', 'Everything', 'Know', 'May', 'be', 'Lie', 'tugline', 'film', 'goes.The', 'film', 'treads', 'clithed', 'method', 'spending', 'time', 'made-for-TV', 'thriller', 'practically', 'what', 'screen', 'only', 'basics', 'story', 'added', 'skills', 'flavor', 'time', 'be', 'drawn', 'too', 'rudimentary', 'storyline', 'only', 'observe', 'progress', 'case', 'too', 'busy', 'explain', 'audience', 'number', 'fashion', 'unfolding', 'story', 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'good', 'cast', 'thrown', 'film.If', 'think', 'review', 'too', 'unkind', 'compare', 'such', 'works', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'latter', 'flawed', 'film', 'how', 'generate', 'tension', 'war', 'make', 'audience', 'fell', 'need', 'characters', 'regain', 'lost', 'dignity', 'most', 'atomosphere', 'court', 'scenes', 'are', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'High', 'Crimes', 'Surely', 'are', 'told', 'here', 'military', 'world', 'not', 'judge', 'investigating', 'officier', 'not', 'jury', 'members', 'However', 'image', 'rigid', 'strict', 'by-the-book', 'authority', 'marine', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'case', 'somehow', 'disappointing', 'way', 'first', 'promising', 'sides', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'only', 'be', 'wasted', 'half-baked', 'way', 'see', 'romance', 'see', 'war', 'see', 'court', 'see', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'vivacious', 'sister', 'Clair', 'none', 'work', 'probably', 'pointless', 'development', 'them.Freeman', 'shows', 'unexpected', 'comical', 'side', 'acting', 'down-and-out', 'lawyer', 'Judd', 'good', 'often', 'painful', 'watch', 'again', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'two', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'too', 'routine', 'storytelling', 'film', 'Even', 'location', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'dry', 'moody', 'picture', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'much', 'low', 'patches', 'High', 'Crimes']",High Crimes
