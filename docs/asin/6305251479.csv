456081,A1J1K3X8ZMB5WD,6305251479,David Stager,"[4, 5]","As pointed out by the two previous reviewers, this video is a direct copy of two silver age comic books.  I can tell you that modern kids do not like the 1966 Marvel Super Heroes animations, and this video is more suitable  for a superhero comic book fan.  It's too bad that Fox did not research the  identity of the voice actors who deliver Stan Lee's over the top dialogue  perfectly.  There are actually 13 different Hulk stories animated in the  full series.  Only two of them are presented here.  The original comics  continued a story line over many issues and almost the entire early Hulk  &quot;cosmic sagas&quot; are available and would make a great box set.  If  you're listening Fox, Hulk animations are available for Hulk #1, 2, 3, 5,  6, Tales to Astonish # 60-81, and Avengers #2.  Why not include the entire  thing in its original serial format and leave in the title cards and  recaps?  If the silver age comic book trade on E-Bay is any indication,  these videos presented in this form would be valuable.  As kid videos, they  are worthless.",3,Kids video or collectors item?,928195200,"06 1, 1999",1999,1058,"['pointed', 'out', 'two', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'video', 'direct', 'copy', 'two', 'silver', 'age', 'comic', 'books', 'can', 'tell', 'modern', 'kids', 'do', 'not', '1966', 'Marvel', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'animations', 'video', 'more', 'suitable', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'too', 'bad', 'Fox', 'did', 'not', 'research', 'identity', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'deliver', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'top', 'dialogue', 'perfectly', 'are', 'actually', '13', 'different', 'Hulk', 'stories', 'animated', 'full', 'series', 'Only', 'two', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'original', 'comics', 'continued', 'story', 'line', 'many', 'issues', 'almost', 'entire', 'early', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'cosmic', 'sagas', 'quot', 'are', 'available', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'box', 'set', ""'re"", 'listening', 'Fox', 'Hulk', 'animations', 'are', 'available', 'Hulk', '1', '2', '3', '5', '6', 'Tales', 'Astonish', '60-81', 'Avengers', '2', 'Why', 'not', 'include', 'entire', 'thing', 'original', 'serial', 'format', 'leave', 'title', 'cards', 'recaps', 'silver', 'age', 'comic', 'book', 'trade', 'E-Bay', 'indication', 'videos', 'presented', 'form', 'would', 'be', 'valuable', 'kid', 'videos', 'are', 'worthless']",The Incredible Hulk - Origin of the Hulk / The Power of Doctor Banner VHS

All this is are pictures flying across the screen and mouths cheaply moving. And why does the hulk talk? Yes, he does talk like in the old comic and he sounds like frankinstein instead of what you would think he would talk like.This was very bad, even for the 60's.

456083,ALWB64XOXNMDP,6305251479,Picardfan007,"[1, 1]",Lots of people accuse the animators for using the original art; but I have to say it does work in a limited way. You have to remember back in the mid sixties Marvel wanted any publicity it could get. They are good wholesome fun for any Marvel fan who wants to see the Hulk from his early days.  I thought it was great that the producers wanted to at least remain faithful to the comic...something future cartoon and movie adaptions didn't do.,5,For Kids and fans of all ages,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,442,"['Lots', 'people', 'accuse', 'animators', 'using', 'original', 'art', 'have', 'say', 'work', 'limited', 'way', 'have', 'remember', 'back', 'mid', 'sixties', 'Marvel', 'wanted', 'publicity', 'could', 'get', 'are', 'good', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'Marvel', 'fan', 'who', 'see', 'Hulk', 'early', 'days', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'producers', 'wanted', 'least', 'remain', 'faithful', 'comic', 'something', 'future', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'adaptions', 'did', ""n't"", 'do']",The Incredible Hulk - Origin of the Hulk / The Power of Doctor Banner VHS
456084,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6305251479,Tim Janson,"[5, 5]","In the mid-1960's, Marvel put most of it's top heroes into limited animation series that used to run...at least what I recall, was every afternoon.  Each day a different character was featured: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, and the Submariner.  The ""animation"" used actual panels from the comic art and gave them very limited movement...perhaps and arm swinging or lips moving, etc...While primitive, it gave fans their Marvel heroes with stories from the actual comic books with art by people like Jack Kirby and others.  One of the true cheesy loves of these cartoons were the infections theme songs...""Doc Bruce Banner, belted by gamma rays, turn into the Hulk....""Even over 30 years later I still know the words to each of their theme songs.  It was great stuff.  The  hour shows were broken up into 3 six minute segments.  Throughout these limited shorts we see the origin of the Hulk and the cast of characters including Betty Ross, Major Talbot, and Gen. Thunderbolt Ross.  While the Hulk battled villains such as The Leader and the Abomination, it was Ross and the military who were his main foe in these early cartoons as Ross constantly hunted the Hulk down.  The voice acting was always fun, too.  It was overly dramatic but that really worked with everything else.  These really were like animated comic books.
