Enjoy it for what's it's worth, which isn't a whole, whole lot, but is still better than most junk coming out of Hollywoodland. The acting is good as is, in my opinion, the script. I found the story involving American efforts to snatch up Nazi rocket scientists, a quintessential American jack ***, a murderous lying prostitute, the cool well intended George Clooney trapped in a film noir plot, the score, the black and white picture, and war ravaged setting add up to a something worth the price of a rental fee. Guess I like the films THE GOOD GERMAN copies and don't mind that Steven Soderbergh didn't make a new classic on their level. Kind of a tall order there folks. I give him props for his efforts.

1066452,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000OY8NBK,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","(2 1/2 *'s)  It's no surprise after the success of `Good Night and Good Luck,' George Clooney and Steven Sodenheim would team up to create another vintage historical drama of great import.  Unfortunately, despite being filmed in stunning black and white and recorded with an authentically old-fashioned score, the movie threads together monumental history and a detective tale in a way that isn't as cohesive or focused as the former triumph.  There are solid moments to be sure:  Clooney plays U.S. army correspondent, Jake Geismer (Clooney), relocating to Germany to seek normalcy and find Lena (Cate Blanchett) an old flame.  In the midst of the drama are stunning newsreels of Potsdam as both Superpowers seek German war rocket scientist, Franz Bettman (David Willis), a human focal point demonstrating the emerging Cold War.  Impressively, they give us a feel for Europe (particularly Berlin) as it's being divied up between the power brokers.The story starts solidly enough with an army driver, Patrick Tully (performed with punk kid-toughness by Tobey McGuire) who picks up Jake and quickly makes a connection with Lena, whom Tully keeps like a pimp possession.  From there Jake connects the dots in his investigation that brings him more and more mystery than he originally bargained for.  Some of the film's best moments come when they pause to reflect on the aftermath of the war and it's ramifications for psychological casualties in the film's present (July, 1945) and their future.  (A poignant reminder comes into play when one camera store owner is shown strapped to a rolling dolly because he lost his legs in The War.)Some of the tough, private eye maneuvering by Clooney and (especially) a fine performance by the versatile Blanchett, we get the goods, even if at times the mixture doesn't always translate into the sort of urgency we'd expect from such important material.  Kudos for the authenticity, though. If there weren't expletives in the movie, I'd have sworn I was watching a flick from the forties.  Clooney's no Humphrey Bogart, and Blanchett is (almost) no Ingrid Bergman, but with a few tense scenes and some big ideas, they almost pull it off.",3,"""In the End, No One Was Exempt""",1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2175,"['2', '1/2', '*', 'surprise', 'success', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'Sodenheim', 'would', 'team', 'up', 'create', 'vintage', 'historical', 'drama', 'great', 'import', 'Unfortunately', 'being', 'filmed', 'stunning', 'black', 'white', 'recorded', 'authentically', 'old-fashioned', 'score', 'movie', 'together', 'monumental', 'history', 'detective', 'tale', 'way', ""n't"", 'as', 'cohesive', 'focused', 'former', 'triumph', 'are', 'solid', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'Clooney', 'U.S.', 'army', 'correspondent', 'Jake', 'Geismer', 'Clooney', 'relocating', 'Germany', 'seek', 'normalcy', 'find', 'Lena', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'old', 'flame', 'midst', 'drama', 'are', 'stunning', 'newsreels', 'Potsdam', 'Superpowers', 'seek', 'German', 'war', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'Franz', 'Bettman', 'David', 'Willis', 'human', 'focal', 'point', 'demonstrating', 'emerging', 'Cold', 'War', 'Impressively', 'give', 'feel', 'Europe', 'particularly', 'Berlin', 'being', 'divied', 'up', 'power', 'brokers.The', 'story', 'solidly', 'enough', 'army', 'driver', 'Patrick', 'Tully', 'performed', 'punk', 'kid-toughness', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'who', 'up', 'Jake', 'quickly', 'connection', 'Lena', 'whom', 'Tully', 'pimp', 'possession', 'Jake', 'dots', 'investigation', 'more', 'more', 'mystery', 'originally', 'bargained', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'come', 'when', 'pause', 'reflect', 'aftermath', 'war', 'ramifications', 'psychological', 'casualties', 'film', 'present', 'July', '1945', 'future', 'poignant', 'reminder', 'play', 'when', 'one', 'camera', 'store', 'owner', 'shown', 'strapped', 'rolling', 'dolly', 'lost', 'legs', 'War', 'tough', 'private', 'eye', 'maneuvering', 'Clooney', 'especially', 'fine', 'performance', 'versatile', 'Blanchett', 'get', 'goods', 'even', 'times', 'mixture', ""n't"", 'always', 'translate', 'sort', 'urgency', ""'d"", 'expect', 'such', 'important', 'material', 'Kudos', 'authenticity', 'though', 'were', ""n't"", 'expletives', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'sworn', 'was', 'watching', 'flick', 'forties', 'Clooney', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Blanchett', 'almost', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'few', 'tense', 'scenes', 'big', 'ideas', 'almost', 'pull', 'off']",The Good German
1066453,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000OY8NBK,Alex Udvary,"[2, 4]","Steven Soderbergh's ""The Good German"", depending on your age and knowledge of film can either be seen as a daring, new experimental film shot in black & white or a tribute to classic war time Hollywood films of the 1940s, most noteably ""Casablanca"". I belong to the latter.Capt. Jack Geismer (George Clooney) is an American journalist, who use to live in Berlin before the war. After the war he was giving a choice of being stationed either in London or Berlin. According to Geisman there was no choice. He knew he wanted to go back to Berlin to try and find his lost love Lena (Cate Blanchett) who may or may not have been involved with the Nazis.Intrigue soon follows as Geisman's driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire) is found dead. He allegedly had information regarding a German scientist Emil Brandt. In order to thicken the plot a bit we find out Emil was married to Lena, and it was her really the killers were looking for. Tully was having an affair with Lena and promised to get her out of Berlin. This all takes place before Geisman finds out about Tully and Lena and wants to rekindle their faded flame.To say more about the plot would be a mistake. I'd ruin the entire film for you. But I have to admit I think the visuals and the effect Soderbergh was going for is a bit more interesting to talk about then the plot itself. The movie was shot on actually camera equipment used in during the 40s. The film has such a crisp look to it, that if it were not for the strong language and graphic sexual content, this could have been one of the lost films of 1946 suddenly found. Soderbergh did his homework on this one. I'm not much of a fan of his work. I didn't enjoy titles such as ""Full Frontal"", ""Kafka"" or his ""Ocean"" movies (I haven't seen 13 yet) but I did like ""Traffic"" (which I think deserved the best picture Oscar over ""Gladiator"") and ""Erin Brockovich"". Here though Soderbergh must be given his due credit. The film is more than an imitation. It is compelling enough where it could stand on its own without the gimmick of the camera equipment.But not just the look of the film captures the spirit of the times we have to give credit to Clooney and Blachett. I was never much of a Clooney fan but when I say ""Good Night and Good Luck"" I found a new respect for him and he is quite good in this film. He definitely recalls Bogart, though the part is a little different. Bogart was usually an outsider who didn't want to get involved. Remember his line in ""Casablanca""? ""I stick my neck out for no man."" Here Clooney's character wants to get involved. It was the whole point of his journey.Blanchett on the other hand I've always admired. She is one of the great actresses working today. If we want to compare this to ""Casablanca"" we could say she brings Ingrid Bergman to mind but for some reason I thought of Greta Garbo. That mysterious woman appeal that Garbo excelled at seems to be what Blanchett was going for.A lot of people didn't seem to like this film. I came across mostly negative reviews from the critics and the public didn't seem to embrace it either. Why do I like it? I have no clue. I could just be the simple reason I like what Soderbergh was going for. I enjoy Hollywood films from the time period. Or it could be it was just a good movie. Maybe a combination of both. Either way ""The Good German"" is worth watching.Bottom-line: Steven Soderbergh's tribute to classic Hollywood films of the 1940s does a great job of recreating the look and feel of the films from the era but the story is good enough to work on its own.",4,Classic Hollywood Storytelling,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,3552,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Good', 'German', 'depending', 'age', 'knowledge', 'film', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'seen', 'daring', 'new', 'experimental', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'tribute', 'classic', 'war', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'films', '1940s', 'most', 'noteably', 'Casablanca', 'belong', 'latter.Capt', 'Jack', 'Geismer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'American', 'journalist', 'who', 'use', 'live', 'Berlin', 'war', 'war', 'was', 'giving', 'choice', 'being', 'stationed', 'either', 'London', 'Berlin', 'According', 'Geisman', 'was', 'choice', 'knew', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'Berlin', 'try', 'find', 'lost', 'love', 'Lena', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'Nazis.Intrigue', 'soon', 'Geisman', 'driver', 'Tully', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'found', 'dead', 'allegedly', 'had', 'information', 'regarding', 'German', 'scientist', 'Emil', 'Brandt', 'order', 'thicken', 'plot', 'bit', 'find', 'out', 'Emil', 'was', 'married', 'Lena', 'was', 'really', 'killers', 'were', 'looking', 'Tully', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Lena', 'promised', 'get', 'Berlin', 'place', 'Geisman', 'out', 'Tully', 'Lena', 'rekindle', 'faded', 'flame.To', 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', ""'d"", 'ruin', 'entire', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'visuals', 'effect', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'going', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'talk', 'then', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'actually', 'camera', 'equipment', 'used', '40s', 'film', 'crisp', 'look', 'were', 'not', 'strong', 'language', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'lost', 'films', '1946', 'suddenly', 'found', 'Soderbergh', 'did', 'homework', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'titles', 'such', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'Kafka', 'Ocean', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '13', 'yet', 'did', 'Traffic', 'think', 'deserved', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscar', 'Gladiator', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Here', 'Soderbergh', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'due', 'credit', 'film', 'more', 'imitation', 'compelling', 'enough', 'where', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'gimmick', 'camera', 'not', 'just', 'look', 'film', 'spirit', 'times', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Clooney', 'Blachett', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'Clooney', 'fan', 'when', 'say', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'found', 'new', 'respect', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', 'Bogart', 'part', 'little', 'different', 'Bogart', 'was', 'usually', 'outsider', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'Remember', 'line', 'Casablanca', 'stick', 'neck', 'man', 'Here', 'Clooney', 'character', 'get', 'involved', 'was', 'whole', 'point', 'journey.Blanchett', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'one', 'great', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'want', 'compare', 'Casablanca', 'could', 'say', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'mind', 'reason', 'thought', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'appeal', 'Garbo', 'excelled', 'be', 'what', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'going', 'for.A', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'film', 'came', 'across', 'mostly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'critics', 'public', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'embrace', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'clue', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'simple', 'reason', 'like', 'what', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'time', 'period', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'combination', 'way', 'Good', 'German', 'worth', 'watching.Bottom-line', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'tribute', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'films', '1940s', 'great', 'job', 'recreating', 'look', 'feel', 'films', 'era', 'story', 'good', 'enough', 'work', 'own']",The Good German

First off, the music score stunk.  It was intrusive and, except in a few spots, it was mostly inappropriate.  And the out-of-step music seemed to me to echo the slightly off-step pace and delivery of the film.  Even though it looked great, it wasn't so much an homage as a film school exercise.  It tried to re-do and update a look and sensibility that is locked forever in the romantic bubble of its own time. The addition of franker sex and language, while more suited to our times, presented a dissonance to the overall scheme of the film, illustrating the difficulty of trying to re-imagine the romance of the 40's wartime dramas for our own, more divisive and cynical age.  It ended up an ungainly mix of Casablanca romance and Third Man disillusion.That said, it was a worthy attempt, and I applaud the effort to try to do something different.  It held my interest, and I very much liked the performances, especially Cate Blanchett and Robin Wiegert.  Clooney and Maguire were okay, and it was an interesting story. But you never really felt a true connection between the characters.  At any rate, this was director Soderbergh's showcase, and I hope he will continue his chance-taking efforts.

My movie experiences of the past mostly stem from Alfred Hitchcock movies.  And have only seen Casablanca once, a long time ago.  Actually, it doesn't really matter, I think some of the elements of the past were captured pretty well, it was the plot (or maybe the book to movie translation) and script that really didn't work.  The lighting was well done, the shadows, the music to set the tone.  All of that was done pretty well.  There were some good support roles also.  I even kind of like Tobey's appearance.  The things for me that didn't work were the simplistic dialogue, the kind of strange background plot, and there were no real climatic moments.  After a while, you don't really care what happens, you just kind of want stuff to be wrapped up.  And then when it is wrapped up, you still don't care.And on another note, normally we think of the heroine character as someone we empathize with.  Our heroine seemed a little dirty for me.  She seemed to be popular in the towns that she visited (if you know what I mean), also I couldn't let go the Nazi angle.

1066460,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000OY8NBK,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 4]","I worry about director Steven Soderbergh. He's trying too hard to come up with ""something different."" New gimmicks do not a great film make. He's done phenomenal work in the past, including TRAFFIC and The OCEAN'S resurgence (i.e., OCEAN'S ELEVEN, etc.). These are straightforward stories with characters we can grasp, laugh at, or worry about. But then he stretches too far and comes up with EROS, SOLARIS (which wasn't too bad), and the bottom rung BUBBLE.Attempting to capture some of that ancient Hollywood gold, Soderbergh puts up THE GOOD GERMAN, a black and white feature in the vein of CASABLANCA. But any resemblance to the former film ends with the lack of technicolor. Given a chop-shop style script, the success of the movie hung on the uncharacteristic style more than the acting, dialogue, or story. The unfortunate part about it is that it doesn't utilize the compelling narrative in which the film is based upon, the novel by Joseph Kanon.The Good German, that term, is meant to denote a German who may have had ties to Nazi-ism but who's record was cleaned up (on paper) so that they could be exported from the country without the threat of being accused of war crimes. Never did this essential element come through on film. What did, though, was a mish-mash of scenes that seemed strung together without regard to story-flow nor character portrayal. We never care for -- or understand the motivations of -- any of these people.The star is George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) as Jacob ""Jake"" Geismer, a journalist sent to Berlin for the post-WWII Potsdam conference. Once there, we quickly learn that he's been here before. In fact, he was involved with a lovely (but married) German named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett, BABEL). Lena is now involved with Corporal Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire, THE ICE STORM) who also happens to be Jake's back-stabbing driver. Is this all coincidence? Jake soon finds out that Lena's supposedly dead husband may have important documents those at the Potsdam conference want to keep quiet (i.e., destroy). When Tully turns up dead, the heat hits Jake full-on, sparking up his naturally inquisitive journalist mind. Everyone has an agenda and wants something from each other.And that's about it...The looping of intrigue is nothing new to cinema, but it can be done correctly if the acting and story are entertaining. You won't find that here. The characters/actors are wooden at best, which is quite a surprise considering the high-caliber cast. Lacking this, one would hope to find a pearl of success somewhere within the script. Not so. Again, it has a haphazard feel with poor fluidity.In the end, it is the filming technique and in-you-face style that stands out over anything of substance. If you really want to know what a Good German is, read Kanon's novel and skip Soderbergh's interpretation.",2,Style Over Substance,1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,2856,"['worry', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'different', 'New', 'gimmicks', 'do', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'make', 'done', 'phenomenal', 'work', 'past', 'including', 'TRAFFIC', 'OCEAN', 'resurgence', 'i.e.', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'etc.', 'are', 'straightforward', 'stories', 'characters', 'can', 'grasp', 'laugh', 'worry', 'then', 'too', 'far', 'up', 'EROS', 'SOLARIS', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'bottom', 'rung', 'BUBBLE.Attempting', 'capture', 'ancient', 'Hollywood', 'gold', 'Soderbergh', 'up', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', 'black', 'white', 'feature', 'vein', 'CASABLANCA', 'resemblance', 'former', 'film', 'ends', 'lack', 'technicolor', 'Given', 'chop-shop', 'style', 'script', 'success', 'movie', 'hung', 'uncharacteristic', 'style', 'more', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'story', 'unfortunate', 'part', ""n't"", 'utilize', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Joseph', 'Kanon.The', 'Good', 'German', 'term', 'meant', 'denote', 'German', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'ties', 'Nazi-ism', 'who', 'record', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'paper', 'could', 'be', 'exported', 'country', 'threat', 'being', 'accused', 'war', 'crimes', 'Never', 'did', 'essential', 'element', 'come', 'film', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'mish-mash', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'strung', 'together', 'regard', 'story-flow', 'character', 'portrayal', 'never', 'care', 'understand', 'motivations', 'people.The', 'star', 'George', 'Clooney', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'Jacob', 'Jake', 'Geismer', 'journalist', 'sent', 'Berlin', 'post-WWII', 'Potsdam', 'conference', 'Once', 'there', 'quickly', 'learn', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'fact', 'was', 'involved', 'lovely', 'married', 'German', 'named', 'Lena', 'Brandt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'BABEL', 'Lena', 'now', 'involved', 'Corporal', 'Patrick', 'Tully', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'THE', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Jake', 'back-stabbing', 'driver', 'coincidence', 'Jake', 'soon', 'out', 'Lena', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'husband', 'may', 'have', 'important', 'documents', 'Potsdam', 'conference', 'want', 'keep', 'quiet', 'i.e.', 'destroy', 'When', 'Tully', 'up', 'dead', 'heat', 'hits', 'Jake', 'full-on', 'sparking', 'up', 'naturally', 'inquisitive', 'journalist', 'mind', 'Everyone', 'agenda', 'something', 'other.And', 'looping', 'intrigue', 'nothing', 'new', 'cinema', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'correctly', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'entertaining', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'characters/actors', 'are', 'wooden', 'best', 'quite', 'surprise', 'considering', 'high-caliber', 'cast', 'Lacking', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'find', 'pearl', 'success', 'somewhere', 'script', 'Not', 'so', 'Again', 'haphazard', 'feel', 'poor', 'fluidity.In', 'end', 'filming', 'technique', 'in-you-face', 'style', 'out', 'anything', 'substance', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Good', 'German', 'read', 'Kanon', 'novel', 'skip', 'Soderbergh', 'interpretation']",The Good German

1066466,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000OY8NBK,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 7]","There's times where I don't really care for Steven Soderbergh movies. Traffic I felt was a compelling if overlong drama that had an aura of self-importance, like it was intentionally made to be one of those ""important"" films. The Good German sometimes feels like the same way: like it wants to be a classic noir film although the intent of course was for it to feel like a film that would've been made at RKO in the old days. While there's some things that feel out of place and just a genuine feeling of sluggishness, it's still a good homage to a classic time period.Jake Geismser (George Clooney) is in Berlin covering the Potsdam Conference with Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and President Roosevelt. He meets driver Tully (Tobey Maguire) who's a nice guy until he's left alone in where he becomes a scheming, violent firebrand. His girlfriend is prostitute Lena (Cate Blanchett) who of course has to be Geismer's ex. But the name ""Emil Brandt"" pops up which gets everyone riled up and a murder happens which gets Jake investigating on who the culprit is and what's so important about Emil Brandt.I will say this: this film has the perfect 1940's feel, from the shadows to the staging, the overdramatic music and it's even presented in full-frame. Even if you don't like the movie, you got to admit they nailed the feel. As far as acting, we do have Clooney and Blanchett who almost were born to be in black and white with Blanchett looking the best. Only misstep was Maguire since he's not really menacing so much as he goes into temper tantrums. If he did this performance in Spider-Man 3, that movie would've benefited. He even rabbit punches a girl in this just so the filmmakers can let you know this guy's tough. Classically trained actors just needed to look at you to know he's not one to cross; Maguire has to actually be given something violent to do.The problem with the movie as a whole is that it's just...kind of boring. It's as if more attention was paid to the look than the script. Casablanca was talky sure but at least it kept your interest. This feels like you're just checking the time code a lot wondering how long the movie's been on. But if you're one that prefers the old movies, you'll probably like this although a sex scene that would've got cut feels odd while there's tons of language to get thrown around. But, as far as a great B&W; movie is concerned, Good Night and Good Luck is definately a better pick.Either it's to preserve the ""magic"" of making the movie or just simply make special features unavailable until a bigger Special Edition is announced, it's really bare-bones.

1066467,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000OY8NBK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 5]","The Good German, the novel by Joseph Kanon, is a first-class thriller that makes some serious points. The Good German, the movie by Steven Soderbergh, isn't and doesn't.Books and movies are different animals, and a fan is naive to think that the strengths of one can always be translated into the other. Director Soderbergh, in my view, in order to achieve two objectives doesn't even try. The first, notable only if the viewer hasn't read the book, is to change substantial elements of the plot and the characters for what seems no greater purpose than to create star roles for George Clooney and Tobey Maguire and ""acting moments"" for the two of them and Cate Blanchett. He also seems, as so many Hollywood factory philosophers seem compelled to do, to want to make obvious points about how awful some government actions can be, how hideous ""end-justifies-the-means"" activities are and how noble is the average guy, played by a Hollywood star lead, of course, in resisting all this. But much, much worse, Soderbergh has used The Good German as a toy. He has said he wanted to make the movie in the style of the old Forties movies. For the most part he shot everything on stage sets, used the old camera lenses, insisted on boom mikes for sound recording and played with the harsh light contrasts familiar from movies like The Third Man and the B-level noirs photographed by John Alton. He even was his own cinematographer and editor (under pseudonyms). What he came up with is a stilted drama so harshly lit that the movie is unpleasant to watch. The movie is a collection of deep, deep contrasts that give washed-out brightness, dead white faces and shadows so black anything might be happening. This must have been great fun for Soderbergh to create but it's hell for the movie viewer to sit through for nearly two hours.The story, set in Berlin in 1945 when the Potsdam Conference is just starting, is hugely visual. There are desperate civilians everywhere, GIs living high, bombed-out ruins, war criminals being hunted by both the Soviets and the Americans, not to punish but, if they were rocket scientists, to bring back home. Intrigue and corruption bubble just below the rotten surface of the city. And Jake Geisner, played by George Clooney, finds himself up to his neck in intrigue when he spots a former mistress, Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) and is assigned a GI driver, Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire). Then a GI is murdered, which leads Geisner into some dangerous situations and some moral conflicts. Unfortunately, among all the specious changes Soderbergh makes in the story-line, the worst is the conclusion. Instead of a satisfying bit of justice served up with irony, as in the book, we have an irrelevant bit of knowledge tossed at us that serves no purpose but to create another acting moment for Clooney and Blanchett.For me, even if I hadn't read the book this movie would have been a disappointment. It's an auteur's dream of a director's Hollywood clout, but gone bad. If Soderbergh doesn't get his act together soon, he'll wind up as a cautionary tale of talent being indulged, corrupted and wasted. I can't think of a movie of his I've seen since Out of Sight and The Limey that did much for me. Amid the Berlin debris, however, is the performance of Cate Blanchett. She looks awful in Soderbergh's unforgiving lighting and it's obvious at times that she's trying to channel Marlene Dietrich.

1066472,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000OY8NBK,D. Hartley,"[3, 4]","Steven Soderbergh loves to pay homage. In fact, (Mr. Tarantino aside),he probably holds the record for dropping more cinema buff-centric references per film than any other director. In his most recent film, ""The Good German"" (filmed in B&W;), he may have allowed this tendency lead him too deeply into ""style over substance"" territory.The story is set in immediate post-war Berlin, with the backdrop of the uneasy alliance and growing mistrust between the occupying U.S. and Russian military forces. Captain Jacob Geismer (George Clooney) is an American military correspondent who has been assigned to cover the Potsdam Conference. His G.I. driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire) is a slick wheeler-dealer (reminiscent of James Garner's character in ""The Americanization of Emily"") who ""procures"" everything from sundries to women and has a German girlfriend named Lena Brandt (a barely recognizable Cate Blanchett, dutifully delivering all her lines in a husky Marlene Dietrich drone). Imagine Capt. Geismer's surprise when Tully introduces him to said girlfriend, and she happens to be an old lover of his.To say much more about the narrative would risk revealing spoilers, so suffice it to say that Lena, a Woman with a Dark Secret, soon becomes the central figure in a murder mystery, with the hapless Geismer drawn into the thick of it.Unfortunately, despite a certain amount of suspense in the first act,the story becomes increasingly convoluted and curiously uninvolving. Blanchett's performance feels a bit phoned-in, and I wouldn't call it Clooney's best work either. Now, it is possible that Soderbergh is SO obsessed with aping the feel of a film noir-ish, black and white late-40's war thriller, that he may have directed his actors to mimic the semi-wooden, melodramatic acting style that informed many of those films. (Even the DVD transfer appears to be in tune with the affectation; as it is matted in full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio).The cinematography is a bit overexposed and  ""washed out"", although I can see that Soderbergh is making an admirable attempt to mimic the chiaroscuro look of a certain classic Carol Reed film (I am sure I am not the first person to draw comparisons to ""The Third Man"").There are also some other obvious touchstones here, like Hitchcock's WW2 thrillers ""Notorious (DVD)"" and (especially) ""Foreign Correspondent"".At the end of the day, however, if I really want to see something that reminds me of ""The Third Man"" or ""Foreign Correspondent"",I think if I had my druthers, I would just as soon pull out my copy of....er, ""The Third Man"" or ""Foreign Correspondent"", if you know what I am saying.

The film is shot in black-and-white and both borrows from and defies the cinematographic conventions of the time: the shadows are well-defined, the actors are boldly marked with strong key lights, yet the whites and lighter sections are often flared out and hazy, more like the wartime newsreels, which were shot on the fly rather than on some Hollywood set.  This is a good metaphor for the film as well: it's difficult to see the light amid the darkness and grime of a decimated Berlin.  Director Stephen Soderberg pays homage to many classic films -- ""Casablanca,"" ""The Third Man,"" et.al. -- but he also make use of the documentary feel of Frank Capra's wartime training films and the desolate, grainy footage of the liberation period.  The story is unremittingly dark and cynical, as Clooney's optimistic tough-guy hero is repeatedly pummeled both by Spillane/Chandler goons and by the force of history, the optimism of prewar America is battered as well...

The camp housed workers for German rockets who were fed just 800 calories of food a day - just enough to keep them alive and working.

Tully and Geismer share the same mistress, Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) who was Emil Brandt's wife before his supposed death.

I know that the actors wanted to make a good post-war film, with the tension and allegory that should have been present. I will tell you how the mark was missed.  I doubt anyone associated with the film watched a single 1945-50 film produced in Germany during the emerging cold war.  Many of these show the compromised characters of post-war Berlin actually IN post-war Berlin.  In this film cuts from real film to computer generated scenes just miss the mark.  In many of those film  you see no one killed or beaten, it is all psychological inner drama and tension.  It is not difficult to find these films.  I have purchased many from Amazon.  Instead, when necessary, this film resorts to Hollywood magic.  The ""sought"" SS-man is able to hide out for weeks--impossible with the military crawling over the ruins of Berlin.  We are asked to believe that a motor-pool corporal can cross military zones with near impunity, stealing cases of scotch and selling them to the other side (the film is set at the time of the Potsdam conference).  There is no justification for ""necessities"" appearing from nowhere (e.g., a French uniform for the SS-man). Although I dislike it, the incessant smoking and drinking is missing.  It can be done without glorifying it (e.g., Slovenka, Slovenian Girl, 2009).  The impoverishment of post-war Berlin is really not apparent.  My point is not that there are better films.  Essentially, my point is that THIS could have been a much better film--and most American moviegoers who would want to see Clooney and Blanchett would NOT know where or when the films were made that provide the background for such a black and white film.  Could have been a masterpiece, but instead, as you see from other reviews and the mean rating, it fell far short.

1066476,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000OY8NBK,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is not to be dismissed, but I am disappointed with how misbegotten this stylized 2006 melodrama is given the potential of the material and the pedigree of the cast. The idea is intriguing enough - recreate a WWII-era, black-and-white Warner Brothers movie replete with back projection shots, a period-authentic score (composed with appropriately grand orchestration by Thomas Newman), and plot elements borrowed fromCasablancaandThe Third Man. What Soderbergh does is apply current sensibilities about the characters that would have been heavily censored by the Hayes Office at the time. The result just doesn't resonate, and the chief culprit seems to be Paul Attanasio's dull, often incoherent screenplay. He eschews the romanticism necessary to make Soderbergh's ruse work, and the characters' motivations come across with little conviction, at least anything that would make sense to a discerning viewer.The convoluted story follows war correspondent Jake Geismar back to Berlin where he ran the AP bureau before the war began. He finds a city in ruins not only in terms of the buildings but in the people who remained for the war's duration. Geismar is covering the Potsdam Conference for the New Republic, but he also wants to find his former lover, Lena Brandt. Assigned to drive him around the city is an American soldier named Tully, whose chipper exterior masks an angry, amoral center deep into the local black market. The fates of these characters clash unexpectedly around Lena's mathematician husband, whom she claims is dead, even though he is still pursued by a number of unsavory characters including a corrupt U.S. Congressman. As Geismar, George Clooney is smart enough not to mimic Bogie, but he also doesn't slip into his role very easily since his ironic &eacute;lan is at odds with the character's obsessive, misguided nature.You would think the superbly talented Cate Blanchett would have a field day playing a Dietrich-like femme fatale, especially with her convincing Teutonic accent and camera-ready cheekbones, but Lena is presented so cryptically that we become indifferent to her tenuous situation. Soderbergh also spends precious little time developing the romantic aspect of their relationship, which should have been the driving force to their often irrational actions. Tobey McGuire's boyish demeanor as Tully becomes unctuous almost immediately, and the role's darker dimensions escape his grasp. The production's technical aspects provide curiosity value, although the result can be less than enthralling, for example, Soderbergh's camerawork is far too crisp to compare reasonably with the gauzy treatments of old studio craftsmen like Arthur Edeson (Casablanca) or Robert Krasker (The Third Man).

The theatrical and cinematic qualities of this film noir are stunning, creating not only a flashback to the 1940s films but to the period of the 1940s in postwar Europe.  The story is rich in suspense, visual surprises, and intrigue, and manages to unfold a complex tale involving many characters in a manner that keeps the viewer guessing about the outcome until the final image fades.  But the film takes a hefty does of patience to appreciate.Potsdam conference, 1945 in decimated Berlin is the scene.  Capt. Jacob 'Jake' Geismer (George Clooney) arrives to observe and report on the conference and is assigned a driver named Tully (Tobey Maguire), a fast talking, manipulative opportunist who loves post-war Berlin for the easy money it allows a doofus like him to make.  Tully happens to have a lover, the mysterious  Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), who he is trying to assist in escaping from Germany.  As luck would have it Lena had been a previous lover of Jake in his prior time in Berlin.  The action begins when the Russians, the British, and the Americans reveal their attempt to locate rocket scientist Emil Brandt, Lena's husband who she declares has been long dead.  A murder occurs, espionage takes over and the film runs its cat and mouse chase for the discovery of the real Emil Brandt and the secrets his capture represent at this crucial junction in time - the Potsdam Conference.The characters in the film come close to being caricatures: Ravil Isyanov as the main Russian figure, Beau Bridges and Jack Thompson as the main American figures, Robin Weigert as the requisite good prostitute/stripper roommate of Lena, Tony Curran representing the British presence, and Don Pugsley as the German evil presence that ties the whole story together.  Blanchett is her usual splendid self, adding a true sense of mystery and allure to her multifaceted role, George Clooney is on target as Jake, and Tobey Maguire manages to get on our nerves as the nerdy but clever Tully.  The pleasure in this film comes from Soderbergh's mastery of the medium not only as director but as cinematographer, and by Thomas Newman's period perfect score as orchestrated by the immensely talented Thomas Pasatieri fleshes out the film's effect.Knowing that public and critical reaction is split, the film is a good evening of adventure: every viewer will elect which side of the critique to follow.

While it is undertandable that a film adaptation has to take some liberties with the original material, the drastic changes that the screenwriter made are senseless - they add nothing to the film, nor do they change the tone of the film for the better; in fact, in most cases they only make the film more confusing. Relationships between characters now make no sense, so it is hard, if not impossible, to understand their motivations for doing what they do.

A favorite genre?Recently a friend recommended the movie CHARLOTTE GRAY, so when I ordered it, I noticed another ""similar"" movie THE GOOD GERMAN. I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett's so this was a no-brainer decision: I ordered both movies. CHARLOTTE was a good movie...with Blanchett in the title role and with the magnificent Michael Gambon and the nice British actor Rupert Penry-Jones...but THE GOOD GERMAN was better! Here's the plot synopsis from the subscription service:A U.S. Army war correspondent is drawn into a deadly mystery in post-war Berlin as he seeks out his wartime mistress in this adaptation of author Joseph Kanon's best-selling novel. The war is over, and Jake Geismar (George Clooney) is an American journalist assigned the task of covering the peace in Berlin -- but he was once lovers with a mysterious woman named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett). Lena is a lady with many secrets to hide, however, and now that the fighting has ceased, she has every intention of burying her sins and escaping her dark past. As Jake searches for Lena in war-torn Berlin with the assistance of American Army motor pool driver Tully (Tobey Maguire), the complex web of deceit woven by the desperate woman soon leads all three into the black market, which could prove either the ticket to Lena's ultimate escape or the downfall of both her and her pursuers.What a weak synopsis. Oh, the film starred Clooney, Blanchett, and Maguire.  And the setting and time period is mentioned correctly as post-war Berlin.  But the plot is so much more interesting and multi-layered than hunting for an old wartime lover!  And it's filmed in black and white with all the costume and look of a 1945 old movie. The soundtrack is really awesome with its spikes of impending danger! (I learned later that director Steven Soderbergh...under the pseudonym Peter Andrews...used 1940s era lenses, sound-recording techniques, and a decidedly less-mobile camera for this spectacular effect.)The story is very thrilling with lots of intrigue. George Clooney is perfectly cast as Jake Geisner, an American journalist in Berlin to cover the Potsdam summit. A young Tobey Maguire, as the Army driver assigned to transport Geisner, stole the first part of the movie playing a very manipulative soldier pimping for certain desperate German women and selling information to the Russians about them. Cate Blanchett is one of those desperate German women: she mysteriously and slightly underplays the part but is brilliant as usual.And hopefully, you can determine who is the good German?  The question nags me a bit.  I think I know though.I plan to read Joseph Kanon's 2001 novel of the same name soon. Kanon won a 1988 Edgar for best first mystery for LOS ALAMOS. I may have to go back and read his other books, too: THE PRODIGAL SPY (1998), ALIBI (2005) which won Hammett Prize, and STARDUST (2009).",4,A small gem in black and white!,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2965,"['How', 'do', 'select', 'movie', 'viewing', 'Do', 'have', 'favorite', 'director', 'A', 'favorite', 'actor', 'favorite', 'genre', 'Recently', 'friend', 'recommended', 'movie', 'CHARLOTTE', 'GRAY', 'when', 'ordered', 'noticed', 'similar', 'movie', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'so', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'decision', 'ordered', 'movies', 'CHARLOTTE', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'Blanchett', 'title', 'role', 'magnificent', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'nice', 'British', 'actor', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', 'was', 'better', 'Here', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'subscription', 'service', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'war', 'correspondent', 'drawn', 'deadly', 'mystery', 'post-war', 'Berlin', 'out', 'wartime', 'mistress', 'adaptation', 'author', 'Joseph', 'Kanon', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'war', 'Jake', 'Geismar', 'George', 'Clooney', 'American', 'journalist', 'assigned', 'task', 'covering', 'peace', 'Berlin', 'was', 'once', 'lovers', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'named', 'Lena', 'Brandt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Lena', 'lady', 'many', 'secrets', 'hide', 'however', 'now', 'fighting', 'ceased', 'intention', 'burying', 'sins', 'escaping', 'dark', 'past', 'Jake', 'searches', 'Lena', 'war-torn', 'Berlin', 'assistance', 'American', 'Army', 'motor', 'pool', 'driver', 'Tully', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'complex', 'web', 'deceit', 'woven', 'desperate', 'woman', 'soon', 'three', 'black', 'market', 'could', 'prove', 'ticket', 'Lena', 'ultimate', 'escape', 'downfall', 'pursuers.What', 'weak', 'synopsis', 'Oh', 'film', 'starred', 'Clooney', 'Blanchett', 'Maguire', 'setting', 'time', 'period', 'mentioned', 'correctly', 'post-war', 'Berlin', 'plot', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'multi-layered', 'hunting', 'old', 'wartime', 'lover', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'costume', 'look', '1945', 'old', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'awesome', 'spikes', 'impending', 'danger', 'learned', 'later', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'pseudonym', 'Peter', 'Andrews', 'used', '1940s', 'era', 'lenses', 'sound-recording', 'techniques', 'decidedly', 'less-mobile', 'camera', 'spectacular', 'effect', 'story', 'very', 'thrilling', 'lots', 'intrigue', 'George', 'Clooney', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Jake', 'Geisner', 'American', 'journalist', 'Berlin', 'cover', 'Potsdam', 'summit', 'young', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Army', 'driver', 'assigned', 'transport', 'Geisner', 'stole', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'playing', 'very', 'manipulative', 'soldier', 'pimping', 'certain', 'desperate', 'German', 'women', 'selling', 'information', 'Russians', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'desperate', 'German', 'women', 'mysteriously', 'slightly', 'part', 'brilliant', 'usual.And', 'hopefully', 'can', 'determine', 'who', 'good', 'German', 'question', 'bit', 'think', 'know', 'though.I', 'plan', 'read', 'Joseph', 'Kanon', '2001', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'soon', 'Kanon', 'won', '1988', 'Edgar', 'best', 'first', 'mystery', 'LOS', 'ALAMOS', 'may', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'other', 'books', 'too', 'PRODIGAL', 'SPY', '1998', 'ALIBI', '2005', 'won', 'Hammett', 'Prize', 'STARDUST', '2009']",The Good German

The film unfortunately, has a few big bubbles that impress initially, but vaporize and leave a flat, bitter fluid later.The big bubbles are the name actors and homage to film noir. The overweaning style, heightened by the best component of the film (Thomas Newman's music) is intriguing to lovers of the genre, but the actors, professional as they are, can't bring much to their roles, probably as a result of the direction. Clooney is likeable as always but doesn't project the necessary intensity of caring for Cate Blanchett that the action demands. Blanchett does create a character, but it's too Dietrich-like to stand in its own right. So, after the plot ends and the actors leave the screen, you're left with disappointment, even though your hopes were up and you were saying to yourself, ""This film isn't as bad as they were claiming!""The bottom line for me is: the real comparison film is Lars Von Trier's ""Zentropa"" (or ""Europa"") of 1991.

1066495,A2DB720I9XRX7K,B000OY8NBK,K. Draper,"[2, 4]","Steven Soderbergh's THE GOOD GERMAN puts me in mind of Wolfgang Staudte's excellent film, DIE MOERDER SIND UNTER UNS (The Murderers are Among Us), which was the first film to be produced in post-war Germany. Both movies are set amid the ruins of Berlin (Truemmerfilm)--both in the Soviet Zone, in fact.  Both feature a beautiful German woman who is involved with a ""good German"", that is, a man of conscience had been forced to serve in the Nazi regime.  I enjoyed this new Hollywood film noir, but I found it a bit ""colorless"" at times: the lackluster execution misses the drama worthy of this important and creative concept, compared to the more suspenseful and memorable THE MURDERERS ARE AMONG US.Cate Blanchett's character, Lena Brandt tries to escape from Germany and is burdened with the dark secrets of her past; Susanne Waller in the 1946 film returns to Berlin after being imprisoned in a concentration camp, and she tries to bring order to the rubble of her apartment and to create a new life and future for herself.  Although Susanne suffers unjustly in the war,  she returns to Berlin and puts the past behind her. Lena, on the other hand,  basically sells herself in order to survive and to avoid the horrible suffering of the war, and to avoid dire post-war consequences.  Her main goal is to get out of Berlin, but, by her own admission, she can never really leave Berlin (i.e. her past).  Apparent from the start is that Lena sells her body in order to get what she wants, but we only learn the full truth of her complicity in war crimes at the very end, as she leaves Jake Geismer (Clooney) to board a plane and leave Germany. (Casablanca-esque)The ""good German"" in the modern film noir is the continually hunted Emil Brandt, whereas the good German of the older, East German film is the  haunted Hans Merten.  Both movies illustrate the fact that there were indeed those few souls who were able to see the Nazi agenda for the evil that it was,  and not succumb to the prevailing propaganda.  But THE MURDERERS ARE AMONG US is does so more successfully and memorably. I do like the brave little Emil Brandt, who kept lists and records of the atrocities he witnessed.  Though he seems meek in comparison to Lena, he is really the courageous one because he risks his life for the truth and whereas she is the cowardly one who will stop at nothing to save her own hide.  But where's the panic, where's the horror?  Even the sewer doesn't seem to stink in THE GOOD GERMAN.  Hans Merten, on the other hand, is a tortured soul.  He can't get a grip on himself after the crimes which he witnessed and was forced to be party to.  This feels more real.  How can a person of conscience survive the horrors of war so calmly unaffected?  Merten's shows serious signs of post-traumatic stress.  Brandt, just feels a bit claustrophobic down unter there.I found this parallel between these two old and new films interesting.

1066496,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000OY8NBK,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[10, 11]","In THE GOOD GERMAN, Steven Soderburgh does an amazingly good job of recreating the noir look, sound, and feel of Michael Curtiz's classic 1940s Warner Brothers productions such asPassage to Marseille,Now, Voyager, andCasablanca, so much so that I expected Madeleine LeBeau, Leonid Kinskey and Marcel Dalio to play the bit parts.Shot in black and white with incandescent lighting, recorded with boom mikes, and using fixed focus lenses, Soderburgh makes this film an homage to the era of the wartime melodrama.George Clooney plays Jake Geisman, a war correspondent returned to his prewar posting, Berlin, just as the Potsdam Conference gets under way in Berlin (July 1945). As is natural, Jake tries to reconnect with his Berlin past, only to find himself drawn into a murder mystery shaped and defined by the nascent Cold War. As Jake blunders from situation to situation trying to discover the truth, he loses his postwar innocence and optimism.Along with others, Jake also gets into a lot of fights with a character I eventually dubbed ""The Mysterious Man Who Hits People In The Head."" Said Mysterious Man appears so often that I suggested changing the name of the film from ""Der Gute Deutsch"" to ""Klop en Kopf.""Also starring Cate Blanchett as Jake's former lover, Lena Brandt (""Why are you throwing away women like that? Someday they may be rationed"") and Tobey Maguire as an amoral American GI and black-marketeer, Sgt. Tully (""You do despise me Rick, don't you?""), the four-letter dialogue and frank sexual situations belie both the atmosphere and the straight-ahead Forties-style plot to indicate that this is a retrospective, not a re-creation.So much of THE GOOD GERMAN samples films from the era that part of a cinemaphile's enjoyment of watching comes down to, ""I saw that in . . ."" This is particularly true of the ending, which will be instantly familiar but strangely unrecognizable.THE GOOD GERMAN is highly recommended, particularly for adherents of the classic silver screen.",4,They don't make 'em like that anymore . . . but they did this time,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1991,"['THE', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', 'Steven', 'Soderburgh', 'amazingly', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'noir', 'look', 'sound', 'feel', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'classic', '1940s', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'productions', 'such', 'asPassage', 'Marseille', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'andCasablanca', 'so', 'much', 'expected', 'Madeleine', 'LeBeau', 'Leonid', 'Kinskey', 'Marcel', 'Dalio', 'play', 'bit', 'parts.Shot', 'black', 'white', 'incandescent', 'lighting', 'recorded', 'boom', 'mikes', 'using', 'fixed', 'focus', 'lenses', 'Soderburgh', 'film', 'homage', 'era', 'wartime', 'melodrama.George', 'Clooney', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Geisman', 'war', 'correspondent', 'returned', 'prewar', 'posting', 'Berlin', 'just', 'Potsdam', 'Conference', 'way', 'Berlin', 'July', '1945', 'natural', 'Jake', 'reconnect', 'Berlin', 'past', 'only', 'find', 'drawn', 'murder', 'mystery', 'shaped', 'defined', 'nascent', 'Cold', 'War', 'Jake', 'blunders', 'situation', 'situation', 'trying', 'discover', 'truth', 'postwar', 'innocence', 'optimism.Along', 'others', 'Jake', 'also', 'lot', 'fights', 'character', 'eventually', 'dubbed', 'Mysterious', 'Man', 'Who', 'People', 'Head', 'Said', 'Mysterious', 'Man', 'so', 'often', 'suggested', 'changing', 'name', 'film', 'Der', 'Gute', 'Deutsch', 'Klop', 'en', 'Kopf', 'Also', 'starring', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Jake', 'former', 'lover', 'Lena', 'Brandt', 'Why', 'are', 'throwing', 'away', 'women', 'Someday', 'may', 'be', 'rationed', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'amoral', 'American', 'GI', 'black-marketeer', 'Sgt', 'Tully', 'do', 'despise', 'Rick', 'do', ""n't"", 'four-letter', 'dialogue', 'frank', 'sexual', 'situations', 'atmosphere', 'straight-ahead', 'Forties-style', 'plot', 'indicate', 'retrospective', 'not', 're-creation.So', 'much', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', 'samples', 'films', 'era', 'part', 'cinemaphile', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'down', 'saw', 'particularly', 'true', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'strangely', 'unrecognizable.THE', 'GOOD', 'GERMAN', 'highly', 'recommended', 'particularly', 'adherents', 'classic', 'silver', 'screen']",The Good German
1066497,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000OY8NBK,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","I watched this movie twice.  The first time I watched it in French without subtitles.  Then I watched it in English, because I'm not fluent in French.  :)  Steven Soderberg directed this picture.  He won the Best Director Oscar for ""Traffic"" in 2000 & has directed ""Sex, Lies & Videotape"" & ""Erin Brockovich.""  Using the name Peter Andrews, he also served as cinematographer.  I think it is a valid question with the scene setup at the airport at the end why did he choose to copy ""Casablanca,"" without adding anything significantly to that setup.  We do get the profound twist [spoiler] that Lena survived by turning in other Jews to the Gestapo, but it only serves to take what we think is going to be a romantic ending and shatters it.  Perhaps like the Wizard of Oz, the film should suddenly have burst into color as the lights come on in Clooney's head.Thomas Newman's score was nominated for the Oscar from this film and is one of the best elements of the picture.George Clooney won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Syriana"" in 2005.  He's an actor who brings depth to even a thin character.  As Captain Jake Geismer, he broods and carries a torch romantically for Lena, even as he gets beaten up by Toby MacGuire.  While Clooney does a good job IMHO, the plot seems to beat him back consistently, ""You should have never come back to Berlin.""  We might have had a more interesting film if he'd been elsewhere.Cate Blanchett filmed ""Notes On a Scandal"" & ""Babel"" this same year.  She does a journeyman's job.  She's got a distinctive, lovely face and turns in an expressive low-key performance that smolders from the pressures of trying to survive.  While she won her Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""The Aviator"" in 2004, she did not add to her honors with this film.Toby MacGuire's got boy-next-door looks.  The plot undercuts his appeal by showing his character Tully boffing Blanchett from behind bent over the bed.  Then he clubs Clooney into a clump and jumps into the Jeep for a getaway.  MacGuire's only acting recognition at this point is a Best Supporting Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics Association for ""The Wonder Boys"" in 2000.  Unfortunately, his best Good German moment was as a corpse pulled from the river with debris clinging to his face.Shown to best advantage is Christian Oliver as Emile Brandt.  Oliver has not worked extensively with credits like ""The Baby Sitters Club"" in 1995 and ""Subject Two"" about vampires in 2005.  But as Lena's husband hidden away, he brings depth and good looks in his brief camera appearances.Who knows why Beau Bridges signed on to play Col. Muller in this film.  The best thing about his performance is that he showed up for work and shot the scenes.This is neither a wonderful film nor an awful film.  It's an average film.  I'd watch it just to see Cate Blanchett.  With lowered expectations, it's good for an evening's viewing.

1066499,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000OY8NBK,Melissa Niksic,"[7, 7]","""The Good German"" is a tribute to the old Hollywood classics like ""Casablanca,"" which is the movie that this film tries so hard to emulate. Stylistically, ""The Good German"" is incredible. The entire movie is filmed in glistening black and white, and it's very hard to distinguish it from a movie that was made 60 years ago. The basic plot is pretty good, too: an American military journalist (George Clooney) arrives in post-war Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference, only to stumble into a murder plot involving his newly-appointed driver (Toby Maguire), a former flame (Cate Blanchett) and her not-quite-dead husband. Unfortunately, ""The Good German"" fails to generate a strong emotional response from the audience the way ""Casablanca"" does, which really takes away from the other wonderful accomplishments the talented director and cast managed to achieve.Clooney delivers an excellent performance, but I was disappointed in Maguire, who seemed very out of place in the film. (Fortunately, his character doesn't stick around for very long.) However, the two shining stars of this film are Blanchett, who delivers a stunning performance in her mysterious role, and the cinematography itself, which is absolutely breathtaking. Being a huge fan of old movies, I really enjoyed this modern throwback to 1940s filmmaking. In my opinion, though, the graphic sexual content and foul language really took away from the classic aesthetic feel director Steven Soderbergh tried so desperately to recreate: it was unnecessary, and it really took away from all the other old-fashioned movie elements.The final scene in the film is very obviously a recreation of the last scene in ""Casablanca."" Again, while I enjoyed the tribute, I felt that the last scene of ""The Good German"" severely lacked the same kind of emotion and passion that ""Casablanca"" has, which is a real shame. The acting was good, but I really didn't care about what happened to any of the characters, which signifies a major problem with the script.I hope Soderbergh attempts to do another ""modern film noir"" movie eventually. He has the look of it down pat: now all he needs is a slightly stronger script, and we'll be back to the days of Bogart and Bergman in no time!",4,"A good movie, but it could have been much better",1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,2229,"['Good', 'German', 'tribute', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'classics', 'Casablanca', 'movie', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'emulate', 'Stylistically', 'Good', 'German', 'incredible', 'entire', 'movie', 'filmed', 'glistening', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'basic', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'American', 'military', 'journalist', 'George', 'Clooney', 'post-war', 'Berlin', 'cover', 'Potsdam', 'conference', 'only', 'stumble', 'murder', 'plot', 'involving', 'newly-appointed', 'driver', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'former', 'flame', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'not-quite-dead', 'husband', 'Unfortunately', 'Good', 'German', 'generate', 'strong', 'emotional', 'response', 'audience', 'way', 'Casablanca', 'really', 'away', 'other', 'wonderful', 'accomplishments', 'talented', 'director', 'cast', 'managed', 'achieve.Clooney', 'delivers', 'excellent', 'performance', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Maguire', 'who', 'seemed', 'very', 'place', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'character', ""n't"", 'stick', 'around', 'very', 'long', 'However', 'two', 'shining', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'stunning', 'performance', 'mysterious', 'role', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'old', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'modern', 'throwback', '1940s', 'filmmaking', 'opinion', 'though', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'content', 'foul', 'language', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'classic', 'aesthetic', 'feel', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'tried', 'so', 'desperately', 'recreate', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'other', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'obviously', 'recreation', 'last', 'scene', 'Casablanca', 'Again', 'enjoyed', 'tribute', 'felt', 'last', 'scene', 'Good', 'German', 'severely', 'lacked', 'same', 'kind', 'emotion', 'passion', 'Casablanca', 'real', 'shame', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'major', 'problem', 'script.I', 'hope', 'Soderbergh', 'attempts', 'do', 'modern', 'film', 'noir', 'movie', 'eventually', 'look', 'down', 'pat', 'now', 'slightly', 'stronger', 'script', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'days', 'Bogart', 'Bergman', 'time']",The Good German

Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[6, 6]","It was a bit of a shock at first to see Batman (George Clonney) and Spider Man (Tobey McQuire) together in the opening scenes of THE GOOD GERMAN. Especially seeing Spider Man. But that went away quickly with Maquire's tough, black-marketing Corporal Tully erasing memories of his sweet Spidey role. Despite the action-hero star presence of Clooney and Maguire, Cate Blanchette turns out to be the real star of this blank and white post WW II noir film, her sultry, dangerously mysterious persona stealing the show. The camera seems to linger on her like a love sick teenager. The plot is about Americans and Russians trying to locate a German scientist and people getting killed or betrayed. But I found myself drifting away from the details of the plot twists and focusing instead on the atmospherics of post-war Berlin with rubble still in the streets and women selling themselves to survive. That and the characters portrayed by Blanchett and Clooney, who this time out finds himself in a subdued role without a script to emphasise his gift of humor or his glamour. In fact, in the harsh black and white photography, Clooney looks older and haggard while Blanchett becomes even more beautiful. The GOOD GERMAN takes its time and goes mostly nowhere but you will enjoy being there with Cate. Director Steven Soderbergh is intent on giving us a moody film with lots of shadows and dramatic lighting and cinematic posturing to classic black and white movies like CASABLANCA.

Then he hired some first rate actors... but somehow...it didn't work.  If he had worked harder at the script and less at the look, it might have been wonderful.Yes, it is visually splendid. If that is enough for him, then he has succeeded.  However, if he wanted to make a really good motion picture, he failed.I'm not sure exactly where he went wrong but I failed to care about any of the principles.  And when you can't engage the interest of the audience enough to drag them through all of the meananderings of the grim and grisly plot, then why bother?The ""hero"" whose name I've already forgotten although I just watched this, played by George Clooney, never managed to engage me.  I think a different actor might have made the film work.  Clooney is handsome and can be very charming in an old-fashioned, Cary Grant way. (Maybe Soderburgh should make something in the style of the wonderful, slick and glamorous Grant films, casting Clooney....that might be a hoot.) He has no ability to convey any emotion facially and after while, who cares?  He is supposed to be so enamored of this woman that he risks life and limb over and over but somehow he never manages to show us that.Cate Blanchett is very beautiful here and her extraordinary cheek bones play wonderfully in the intense black and white lighting. She is a fine actress and although I was tempted at times to make cheap remarks about her attempting to imitate Marlene Dietrich, I do think that she did the best anyone could with this silly plot.  She manages to look stunning all the time which is quite a feat for someone who has been on the brink of starvation for years.I haven't read the book this was taken from so I don't know exactly what went wrong in re-writing the script.  But it failed to show just what motivated the Clooney character to keep after Lena (Blanchett).  He got beat up time after time and his driver, (Toby Maguire) was killed because of his involvement with her...She was mysterious and elusive--perhaps he was just a man who needed punishment, but the story makes us believe he is the virtuous hero, not just a jerk.Well, after sitting through all of this, I really didn't care who got on the plane at the end and who didn't.

You even have Lena walking through the sewers under Berlin (in high heels!) to search for,... well, see the movie.

The actors were good if a bit archetypal.  But there was not much character development so it seemed ludicrous that the George Clooney character kept being beaten up.  He was certainly a slow learner! Especially since he had lived in Berlin before and was no greenhorn.The SS and their wives were vetted so thoroughly at the time for their Aryan backgrounds that I found it a bit of a stretch that the Cate Blanchett character, married to an SS officer, was actually Jewish.

1066513,A2AIPWIP3VZT8N,B000OY8NBK,Robert Toombs,"[5, 7]","At a recent preview screening, Mr. Soderbergh got up to introduce the film and talked about wanting to recreate the feel of a 1940s Warner Bros. movie as directed by Michael Curtiz (it was double-featured with Casablanca)--but with a modern freedom to depict strong language, sexuality and extreme situations. This made me start worrying even before the movie began: sometimes those limitations work to a filmmaker's advantage, forcing creative solutions by which to still get the story told. In the end, I felt that Soderbergh's fascination with the style of those 1940s films had overwhelmed his storytelling skills, because none of what I saw really felt all that important.Now don't get me wrong--I admire the fact that Soderbergh keeps trying new things, that he's constantly reaching and stretching, trying to grow artistically in every direction.  That's a big part of why I think he's one of our best filmmakers right now; but it's axiomatic that every once in a while, one of his experiments won't work (""Bubble,"" anyone?).  Because the danger is that sometimes the work will feel as if it was for Soderbergh's benefit more than his audience's, and I'm afraid that that's what happened here.Cate Blanchett (who was born to be photographed in black-and-white) gives a great performance, but her final revelation wasn't quite as awful as I'd thought it would be, which made the whole thing feel underwhelming. George Clooney is the new William Holden, and that's a good thing, but he and Blanchett needed a better story, better told, to work with, and they just didn't get it. A real disappointment: lots of craft, but not much heart. Or rather, it seemed that all the heart got poured into the craft, not into the storytelling.

Joseph Kanon's book as it was would have made an excellent script. Kanon is an excellent writer (critics compare him with John LeCarre)and his plots are complex but very believeable.  He chooses historical themes, in this case, Germany in the immediate post-war period, when the occupying armies are still getting organized, the black market is roaring, and the first intimations of the Cold War are appearing as America and the Soviet Union each try to capture as many of Germany's top scientists as possible. Emil Brandt is one of these.  His wife Lena was having an affair with an American journalist before the war, and the journalist returns to Berlin to find her, the great love of his life.  What the movie makes of poor Lena is atrocious; but I guess it's Hollywood's view of post-war Berlin, a city of rubble and exhausted, conquered people.  In the book, Lena is something else entirely than the prostitute in the film.  But, the film noir aspects of the movie are done quite well, and the scenes of a bombed-out, ruined Berlin are real, photographed in May 1945 and woven skillfully into the movie.  One problem is that the actors are far too well-fed to be believeable.  Germans in Berlin were literally starving in the months after the surrender. Try though they might, Hollywood makeup artists and cameramen just did not manage to reproduce the look of people who have been  couple years without real meat, butter, eggs, or animal fats in general.

Geismer knows that there is more to the story than he is being told, so he begins to look into things on his own time, which puts him in harm's way.The mystery is too political.

His use of wipe transitions, jarring camera angles, stark black and white, fast close ups, voice overs, newsreels, cigarette smoking, and expressive background music all revive the era nicely, but the film still screams modern Hollywood. Perhaps it is the language, the sex, or the more graphic violence.

The Good Shepherd was a slow moving espionage drama, that dealt with lies,spies, and stealth,and The Good German is about survival,lies, entrapment,desperation.The Stephen Soderburgh directed ""Good German"" is a dark film both in dialogue and style - very reminscent of The Third Man, and the great Warner Bros film noirs of the 40's/50's.Apparently he reverted back to using the same kind of cameras that were used in the forties,had the lighting changed to ensure the darkened look of the film replicated the look of the film noire - which built up the sense of danger and fear so essential to the background of a war torn Berlin.The central female character, Lena Brandt (played with perfection by Cate Blanchet) is a woman who is widowed,was raped by the Russians,now working as a prostitute,who is desperate to get out of Berlin, but needs a man to protect her and pay her way out.She becomes the mistress of Tully, a rather nasty,oportunistic and violent fellow who's ""day job"" is as an American Army motor pool driver. This is the first time I've seem Maguire playing a cad, but he inserts just the right amount of the ""smilimg assassin"" into his character.I recall one chilling moment when he is driving Jake - an American journalist (George Clooney) in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference.Sully is bragging like a big shot about his his girlfriend, then he stops and says ""You can have her for an hour if you like.""  That summed Tully's character up in one sentence, she was using him to get out of the country and he was using her for whatever took his fancy, knowing as he did that Lena was dependant on him for freedom and food,her very survival.George Clooney's Jake (reminiscent of William Holden at his peak in this) is a former lover of Lena's and when Sully is murdered after crossing the border into the Russian Zone,he steps in to try and help her.Lena proves to be not what she pretends to be - her survival instincts are such that during the war she cold bloodedly betrayed neighbours to the Gestapo - an act that comes back to haunt her.She is shown as self absorbed and ruthless, using men for their power as she is powerless, prepared to do whatever is necessary to save herself.All in all, it's a tale of shadows and intrigue,of people who have lost their souls and who are trying to come to terms with all that has happened to them.The Good German is not a five star journey, but thanks largely to Blanchet's fine acting and Soderburgh's direction, the film is worth of 4.",4,The Good German - A Step Back Into the Forties,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,2656,"['Recently', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'left', 'audiences', 'being', 'bored', 'witless', 'entranced', 'enjoying', 'something', 'different', 'intrigued', 'plot', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'slow', 'moving', 'espionage', 'drama', 'dealt', 'lies', 'spies', 'stealth', 'Good', 'German', 'survival', 'entrapment', 'desperation.The', 'Stephen', 'Soderburgh', 'directed', 'Good', 'German', 'dark', 'film', 'dialogue', 'style', 'very', 'reminscent', 'Third', 'Man', 'great', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'film', 'noirs', ""40's/50's.Apparently"", 'reverted', 'back', 'using', 'same', 'kind', 'cameras', 'were', 'used', 'forties', 'had', 'lighting', 'changed', 'ensure', 'darkened', 'look', 'film', 'replicated', 'look', 'film', 'noire', 'built', 'up', 'sense', 'danger', 'fear', 'so', 'essential', 'background', 'war', 'Berlin.The', 'central', 'female', 'character', 'Lena', 'Brandt', 'played', 'perfection', 'Cate', 'Blanchet', 'woman', 'who', 'widowed', 'was', 'raped', 'Russians', 'now', 'working', 'prostitute', 'who', 'desperate', 'get', 'Berlin', 'man', 'protect', 'pay', 'way', 'mistress', 'Tully', 'rather', 'nasty', 'oportunistic', 'violent', 'fellow', 'who', 'day', 'job', 'American', 'Army', 'motor', 'pool', 'driver', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seem', 'Maguire', 'playing', 'cad', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'smilimg', 'assassin', 'character.I', 'recall', 'one', 'chilling', 'moment', 'when', 'driving', 'Jake', 'American', 'journalist', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Berlin', 'cover', 'Potsdam', 'conference.Sully', 'bragging', 'big', 'shot', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'can', 'have', 'hour', 'like', 'summed', 'Tully', 'character', 'up', 'one', 'sentence', 'was', 'using', 'get', 'country', 'was', 'using', 'took', 'fancy', 'knowing', 'did', 'Lena', 'was', 'dependant', 'freedom', 'food', 'very', 'survival.George', 'Clooney', 'Jake', 'reminiscent', 'William', 'Holden', 'peak', 'former', 'lover', 'Lena', 'when', 'Sully', 'murdered', 'crossing', 'border', 'Russian', 'Zone', 'try', 'help', 'her.Lena', 'proves', 'be', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'survival', 'instincts', 'are', 'such', 'war', 'cold', 'bloodedly', 'betrayed', 'neighbours', 'Gestapo', 'act', 'back', 'haunt', 'her.She', 'shown', 'self', 'absorbed', 'ruthless', 'using', 'men', 'power', 'powerless', 'prepared', 'do', 'necessary', 'save', 'herself.All', 'tale', 'shadows', 'intrigue', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'happened', 'them.The', 'Good', 'German', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'journey', 'thanks', 'largely', 'Blanchet', 'fine', 'acting', 'Soderburgh', 'direction', 'film', '4']",The Good German

I was looking forward to it because I am such a fan of the kind of movies Soderbergh was trying so hard to emulate. I was disappointed. The careful planning to make everything seem so precise as it would've been sixty years ago is a nice idea, but it shouldn't involve the actors, who performed as robotically as if they too were a part of the facade. I am a fan of all of the actors involved but their performances were poor. Maguire was a cartoon thug, Clooney was wooden and dull, and Blanchett was morose and vague.Another issue I had with the film is that they added in some 21st century gratuity to the film in sex scenes, nudity, and dozens of f-bombs from Spider-Man and it seemed really out of place. I am not prudish in any way, but the jarring inappropriateness of it in this context was off-putting. There was simply no need for it outside of titillation. That works great in a Will Ferrel movie, but not here.I can't even say that this is worth it to rent unless you wait until it moves from the more expensive new releases to the cheaper stock, or wait until it puts you to sleep on tv.It's a shame that such a good idea turned out to be so dull and unimaginative where it most needed it - the plot, the writing, and the acting.",2,"Nice package, empty box",1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,1302,"['was', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'so', 'predictable', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'am', 'such', 'fan', 'kind', 'movies', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'emulate', 'was', 'disappointed', 'careful', 'planning', 'make', 'everything', 'seem', 'so', 'precise', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'nice', 'idea', 'should', ""n't"", 'involve', 'actors', 'who', 'performed', 'as', 'robotically', 'too', 'were', 'part', 'facade', 'am', 'fan', 'actors', 'involved', 'performances', 'were', 'poor', 'Maguire', 'was', 'cartoon', 'thug', 'Clooney', 'was', 'wooden', 'dull', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'morose', 'vague.Another', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'added', '21st', 'century', 'gratuity', 'film', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'dozens', 'f-bombs', 'Spider-Man', 'seemed', 'really', 'place', 'am', 'not', 'prudish', 'way', 'jarring', 'inappropriateness', 'context', 'was', 'off-putting', 'was', 'simply', 'need', 'titillation', 'great', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'movie', 'not', 'here.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'worth', 'rent', 'wait', 'more', 'expensive', 'new', 'releases', 'cheaper', 'stock', 'wait', 'sleep', 'tv.It', 'shame', 'good', 'idea', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'dull', 'unimaginative', 'where', 'most', 'needed', 'plot', 'writing', 'acting']",The Good German
1066523,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B000OY8NBK,The Jaundiced Eye,"[4, 5]","This movie had some positive features, but for me the negatives interfered with my overall enjoyment.Positive: Cate Blanchett was wonderful. She could read the Tel Aviv phone book and bring tears to your eyes. Unfortunately, at times the Tel Aviv phone book might have provided her with better dialog than did the script for this movie. Positive: The black and white photography superbly captures the look and feel of a 1940's noir drama, with nods to Casablanca and The Third Man. Overall, the cinematography was probably the single most impressive ""character"" in the whole production.Now for the negatives: The casting was silly. Toby Maguire was selected to play the womanizing, butt-kicking, black market racketeer-tough guy. That's right folks, Toby Maguire. Give me a break....were they simply looking for a recognizable actor, without regard for the fact he was completely unsuited for and never (for a second) believable in this role? Then to make matters worse, they cast George Cloony as the wimpy ""good guy"" who gets his butt kicked in virtually every scene...including once by Toby!!! They must have had George standing in a hole and Toby on a crate for that one. It was unconvincing to the point of being laughable. I can see George as a good guy....but never a wimp.Another negative for me was the agonizingly slow pace of the story. You could take a short nap and not miss a lot. In fact, I think parts of this movie might be a suitable substitute for Ambien.In conclusion: Watch it (if you must) for the wonderful cinematography, but be prepared for the preposterous casting and the lethargic pace.

If you noticed they also kept the same bad ""special effect"" of showing a car in motion by moving the scenery around it.George Clooney, a reporter who doesn't write any stories or has any deadlines, returns to Berlin. His driver is Toby MaGuire who plays the bad Spiderman as a driver. He picks Clooney's pocket, works the black market, sells out his country, and just by co-incidence is the unlikeable boyfriend of Clooney's old German girlfriend, who happens to be the wife of a former Nazi. Her husband, who is dead, but both the Americans and Russians are still looking for him. Toby McGuire offers the ""dead"" German to the Russians for money. Toby turns up dead himself with only a million or so suspects. Now the story goes into a mild who-dun-it which doesn't last too long as Clooney investigates his death which leads to a twisting tale. Toby's killer confesses in an odd first person narration, something unique to this third person tale. This scene was out of place and not necessary as the murder is mentioned in the subsequent conversation.At this point the movie is no longer a who-dun-it, but has another plot twist (not totally unexpected). I suspect the real reason for the film, is the real life underlying political or philosophical aspects which questions committing an evil for the greater good. Blanchett's character has almost robotic.

1066525,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000OY8NBK,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[21, 26]","Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney are well on the path of establishing a memorable Hollywood partnership akin to John Wayne and John Ford or Humphrey Bogart and John Huston; they have a production company together, have made many films together and have produced still others. ""The Good German"", their latest effort, is an interesting experiment. But it is more interesting as an experiment and less interesting as a film.Captain Jacob Geismer (George Clooney), a journalist, arrives in Germany to cover the Potsdam conference at the end of World War II. Geismer was stationed in Germany before the War began, running the Associate Press bureau, and his return is bittersweet, and the town and people he once loved are in ruins. His driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire), a young Army solider, loves living in post-War Germany and works the angles to make some money, providing black market items to people, procuring counterfeit documents, anything to earn money. Geismar soon learns that his old girlfriend, Lena (Cate Blanchett) is still alive and dating Tully. Soon, it becomes apparent that someone is manipulating them to find Lena's husband, Emil, a scientist, who she claims is dead.""The Good German"" is a difficult film to become involved in. The actors show little emotion as they move through the mechanics of the story. Perhaps this is intended, as a way of showing the effects of the war. In the book, when Geismar finds Lena, she is very sick and he nurses her back to health before they become embroiled in the plot. This is barely alluded to in the film and it changes the dynamic of their relationship. It is difficult to see why he is so interested in Lena. Yes, she is a former lover, but he knows she has been dating Tully (and `dating' is a kind word for their relationship) and has basically has become a prostitute to survive. We never learn why he is so attached to her. Because he doesn't care for her in the same way in the film, nursing her back to health as he did in the book, he doesn't ""care for her"" in the same way. Because this key relationship doesn't work, the rest of the film becomes a bit tedious.Soderbergh has always been an innovative filmmaker. In most of his films, he experiments with various aspects of the creative process. In some, he changes color and light to produce heightened effects. In others, he plays with narrative and dialogue to create an interesting, more powerful dynamic between the characters. He has experimented with film noir, sci-fi, drama, comedy, relationship films, heist films, caper films and much more. He is a filmmaker consistently willing to push the envelope, to strengthen his skills and do something different and unusual.""The Good German"", set in 1945, naturally lends itself to a black and white composition. But rather than take a Woody Allen approach and shoot the film in stunning, crystal clear black and white, Soderbergh decided to move backwards and play with some of the filmmaking techniques from this period. In any conversation about great black and white films, one of the titles that will come up is ""Casablanca"". The similarities between the two films are startling; both are set during the war years, involve people affected by the war, and feature doomed relationships. Soderbergh shot ""The Good German"" on sound stages in Los Angeles, much like Curtiz did with ""Casablanca"". But he went a few steps further. Using digital filmmaking techniques in combination with period lenses, lighting and sound techniques he gives the film a remarkably `authentic' look. Scenes are lit dramatically even surrealistically and whites occasionally flare as the camera pans across them. But the director also seems to have adopted some filmmaking techniques common to the period. People move in and out of frame, or approach the camera, their faces filling the screen. He has eschewed long tracking shots for a more dated directorial style.I have read that Soderbergh directed the actors to perform in a presentational, theatrical stage style. If you look at ""Casablanca"", this would be a great way of describing Bogart's and Bergman's acting style. Yet, why is it that we remember this as a classic and I can barely remember Clooney and Blanchett's performances from watching the film yesterday? They are certainly similar, but it just doesn't work in this new film. The characters seem cold, distant and aloof and we don't really care for them.Hopefully, Soderbergh will use some of these techniques on his next film. Now that he has a better handle on them, he should be able to use them to their advantage, possibly creating a ground breaking, memorable work.",3,"Good Experiment in Filmmaking, cold acting leaves no room for emotion",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,4640,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'George', 'Clooney', 'are', 'well', 'path', 'establishing', 'memorable', 'Hollywood', 'partnership', 'akin', 'John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Ford', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'John', 'Huston', 'have', 'production', 'company', 'together', 'have', 'made', 'many', 'films', 'together', 'have', 'produced', 'still', 'others', 'Good', 'German', 'latest', 'effort', 'interesting', 'experiment', 'more', 'interesting', 'experiment', 'less', 'interesting', 'film.Captain', 'Jacob', 'Geismer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'journalist', 'Germany', 'cover', 'Potsdam', 'conference', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Geismer', 'was', 'stationed', 'Germany', 'War', 'began', 'running', 'Associate', 'Press', 'bureau', 'return', 'bittersweet', 'town', 'people', 'once', 'loved', 'are', 'ruins', 'driver', 'Tully', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'young', 'Army', 'solider', 'living', 'post-War', 'Germany', 'angles', 'make', 'money', 'providing', 'black', 'market', 'items', 'people', 'procuring', 'counterfeit', 'documents', 'anything', 'earn', 'money', 'Geismar', 'soon', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Lena', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'still', 'alive', 'dating', 'Tully', 'Soon', 'apparent', 'someone', 'manipulating', 'find', 'Lena', 'husband', 'Emil', 'scientist', 'who', 'dead', 'Good', 'German', 'difficult', 'film', 'become', 'involved', 'actors', 'show', 'little', 'emotion', 'move', 'mechanics', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'intended', 'way', 'showing', 'effects', 'war', 'book', 'when', 'Geismar', 'Lena', 'very', 'sick', 'back', 'health', 'become', 'embroiled', 'plot', 'barely', 'alluded', 'film', 'dynamic', 'relationship', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'interested', 'Lena', 'Yes', 'former', 'lover', 'been', 'dating', 'Tully', 'dating', 'kind', 'word', 'relationship', 'basically', 'become', 'prostitute', 'survive', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'so', 'attached', ""n't"", 'care', 'same', 'way', 'film', 'nursing', 'back', 'health', 'did', 'book', ""n't"", 'care', 'same', 'way', 'key', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'work', 'rest', 'film', 'bit', 'tedious.Soderbergh', 'always', 'been', 'innovative', 'filmmaker', 'most', 'films', 'various', 'aspects', 'creative', 'process', 'color', 'light', 'produce', 'heightened', 'effects', 'others', 'narrative', 'dialogue', 'create', 'interesting', 'more', 'powerful', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'experimented', 'film', 'noir', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'comedy', 'relationship', 'films', 'heist', 'films', 'caper', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'filmmaker', 'consistently', 'willing', 'push', 'envelope', 'strengthen', 'skills', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'unusual', 'Good', 'German', 'set', '1945', 'naturally', 'black', 'white', 'composition', 'rather', 'take', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'approach', 'shoot', 'film', 'stunning', 'crystal', 'clear', 'black', 'white', 'Soderbergh', 'decided', 'move', 'backwards', 'play', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'period', 'conversation', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'one', 'titles', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'Casablanca', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'startling', 'are', 'set', 'war', 'years', 'involve', 'people', 'affected', 'war', 'feature', 'doomed', 'relationships', 'Soderbergh', 'shot', 'Good', 'German', 'sound', 'stages', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'much', 'Curtiz', 'did', 'Casablanca', 'went', 'few', 'steps', 'further', 'Using', 'digital', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'combination', 'period', 'lenses', 'lighting', 'sound', 'techniques', 'film', 'remarkably', 'authentic', 'look', 'Scenes', 'are', 'lit', 'dramatically', 'even', 'surrealistically', 'occasionally', 'flare', 'camera', 'director', 'also', 'have', 'adopted', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'common', 'period', 'People', 'move', 'frame', 'approach', 'camera', 'filling', 'screen', 'eschewed', 'long', 'tracking', 'shots', 'more', 'dated', 'directorial', 'style.I', 'have', 'read', 'Soderbergh', 'directed', 'actors', 'perform', 'presentational', 'theatrical', 'stage', 'style', 'look', 'Casablanca', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'describing', 'Bogart', 'Bergman', 'acting', 'style', 'why', 'remember', 'classic', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'Clooney', 'Blanchett', 'performances', 'watching', 'film', 'yesterday', 'are', 'certainly', 'similar', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'new', 'film', 'characters', 'seem', 'cold', 'distant', 'aloof', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'them.Hopefully', 'Soderbergh', 'will', 'use', 'techniques', 'next', 'film', 'Now', 'better', 'handle', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'advantage', 'possibly', 'creating', 'ground', 'breaking', 'memorable', 'work']",The Good German

1066528,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000OY8NBK,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 3]","Shot to look exactly like a 1940s film, even down to Steven Soderbergh using 1940s lenses and vintage black and white cameras, but with added bad language and sporadic violence, The Good German unfortunately ends up feeling like one of his sporadic exercises in style over content. At its heart there's an intriguing story with a strong moral hook as George Clooney's correspondent for Stars and Stripes finds himself distracted from covering the Potsdam Conference in a devastated Germany by the murder of his black marketeering driver Tobey Maguire, which neither the Russians nor the Americans want investigated. Just to complicate matters, Maguire's girlfriend (who he hired out to lonely GIs) turns out to be not just Clooney's pre-war ex but the wife of the personal secretary to a Nazi rocket scientist and war criminal who both sides are very eager to get their hands on - but not for reasons they might want to get out.Sadly, it never really gels. Clooney is kept offstage for much of the first twenty minutes, only really entering the plot long after it's set in motion but suddenly forcing it into a dead stop as his backstory has to be explained and his character properly introduced, sidelining the mystery and taking too long to give a reason to care about him. More curiously, despite seeming the most Old Hollywood of modern leading men he doesn't quite look right in a classic setting, a problem shared by Cate Blanchett, who seems to be trying too hard to force Marlene Dietrich and Ingrid Bergman into her character and not managing to pull it off. It's a shame, because there's quite a lot that is good about The Good German, but it's concentrating too self-consciously on the surface trick of looking like an old movie but sounding like a modern one to ever really concentrate on the story and characters, which always seem to be much less of a priority. As a result, despite a good twist ending, by the time we get to the all-too-obviously Casablanca-inspired airport finale, we simply don't care whether Clooney and Dietrich get on the plane together or part. You'd be better off just watching Jacques Tourneur's Berlin Express instead.No extras on the DVD.",2,An interesting failure,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2180,"['Shot', 'look', 'exactly', '1940s', 'film', 'even', 'down', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'using', '1940s', 'lenses', 'vintage', 'black', 'white', 'cameras', 'added', 'bad', 'language', 'sporadic', 'violence', 'Good', 'German', 'unfortunately', 'up', 'feeling', 'one', 'sporadic', 'exercises', 'style', 'content', 'heart', 'intriguing', 'story', 'strong', 'moral', 'hook', 'George', 'Clooney', 'correspondent', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'distracted', 'covering', 'Potsdam', 'Conference', 'devastated', 'Germany', 'murder', 'black', 'marketeering', 'driver', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Russians', 'Americans', 'want', 'investigated', 'Just', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Maguire', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'hired', 'out', 'lonely', 'GIs', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'Clooney', 'pre-war', 'ex', 'wife', 'personal', 'secretary', 'Nazi', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'sides', 'are', 'very', 'eager', 'get', 'hands', 'not', 'reasons', 'might', 'want', 'get', 'out.Sadly', 'never', 'really', 'gels', 'Clooney', 'kept', 'offstage', 'much', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'only', 'really', 'entering', 'plot', 'long', 'set', 'motion', 'suddenly', 'forcing', 'dead', 'stop', 'backstory', 'be', 'explained', 'character', 'properly', 'introduced', 'sidelining', 'mystery', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'give', 'reason', 'care', 'More', 'curiously', 'seeming', 'most', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'modern', 'leading', 'men', ""n't"", 'quite', 'look', 'right', 'classic', 'setting', 'problem', 'shared', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'force', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'character', 'not', 'managing', 'pull', 'off', 'shame', 'quite', 'lot', 'good', 'Good', 'German', 'concentrating', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'surface', 'trick', 'looking', 'old', 'movie', 'sounding', 'modern', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'concentrate', 'story', 'characters', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'priority', 'result', 'good', 'twist', 'ending', 'time', 'get', 'all-too-obviously', 'Casablanca-inspired', 'airport', 'finale', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Clooney', 'Dietrich', 'get', 'plane', 'together', 'part', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'watching', 'Jacques', 'Tourneur', 'Berlin', 'Express', 'instead.No', 'extras', 'DVD']",The Good German

1066530,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000OY8NBK,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","I know director Steven Soderbergh likes experimental films, but I never imagined he would do this. In ""The Good German"" you will see a film noir starring George Clooney, Cate Blanchett and Tobey Mcguire in a complicated story of crimes and intrigues set in the ruined city of post-war Berlin in 1945, divided into sectors by the Allies, just like Vienna in ""The Third Man."" ""The Good German"" is shot exactly the same way as old films of 1940s - editing, camera angles, lighting, plus even title backs and acting style. So Thomas Newman's score, which deservedly nominated for Oscar, is just impressive in more than one way.Yes, the results impressed me pretty much at first, and soon bored me because of the lack of emotions. All actors look fine in the meticulously re-created images of old Hollywood films, especially cast-against-type Clooney as military journalist who stumbles upon murder mystery and ever-fantastic Blanchett as mysterious lady with a Dietrich-like accent. The film sometimes uses strongly sexual and violent actions and languages as if trying to remind us that this is not just a copy of old film.But the film's real problem lies behind the styles. When the film attempts to be thrilling or romantic with the convoluted plot, it becomes painfully clear that there is nothing truly interesting here. The film keeps unraveling layers of mysteries without stirring any emotions within us. You don't see the chemistry of Bogart and Bergman, without which the story fails to be engaging.I don't know anything about the source novel. I only imagine that it is much better than this adaptation, which borrows one scene from ""Casablanca"" while it does not need to do so. The scene may be a pastiche; or it may be that Soderbergh meant it for real.

Japan has not been bombed yet and a army journalist(Clooney) arrives in Berlin for, in my understanding, a conference. He is not a stranger to Berlin. He lived there before the war and was in some sort of relationship with Cate Blanchett's character. Upon arrival, he is issued a driver, played to the point of annoyance by Tobey Maguire. Surprise suprise, Tobey's character is now involved with Cate's character and then we find out that Cate's husband, who everyone, including her assumes died in the war-but maybe not? Yea... it can get a tad confusing.This murder mystery does not have a good handle of things from the onset. There are many problems with this film, most deriving from the script and characters. Tobey Maguire sticks out like a sore thumb in this-just badly miscast any way you look at it. George Clooney plays the same character in every film-no surprise. Cate B. is extraodinary as usual, so versatile you would never believe she WASN'T German. But even she can't save this convoluted mess of a film.There is murder, and mystery and a boring romantic subplot that goes nowhere, and characters you can't even begin to care for for various reasons. I can see why this bombed in theaters. The one thing this film has going for it, is its authentic look. Shot entirely in black and white, it comes so very close to the old films we all know that it's just a shame the actual plot can't be any better.I'm always amazed by the five star reviews of certain films.

Rogers,"[1, 4]","SPOILER ALERT!!!If you haven't already seen the film, The Good German, then don't read any further or some of the surprises that pop up in the movie will be ruined for you.First, let me admit that the only reason I bought this DVD was because I hoped to see the ethereal Cate Blanchett either putting on a pair of nylons, or taking them off.  After all, this is a movie that takes place in post-war Germany in 1945, and it is rated ""R.""  Unfortunately, there were no stocking shots of Ms. Blanchett in the film, which was a huge disappointment to me, but I still enjoyed it to a large degree.  It did take me most of the movie to finally realize why it was ""R"" rated and not ""PG-13.""  If the F--- word is used more than once in a film, it automatically gets an ""R"" rating, and the F--- word was used several times, though once would've been more than enough.  I have no idea why the director, Steven Soderbergh, decided to take an ""R"" rating for a few choice words that really made no difference in the quality of the movie.  I personally think it would've been better to skip the F--- word and to see Ms. Blanchett in nylons.  That would certainly have been more enjoyable.The Good German centers on George Clooney's character, whose a newspaper reporter for the Army and is in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference with Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.  He hasn't been in Berlin since before the war and doesn't recognize anything.  His driver is Corporal Tobey Maguire, who also dabbles in the black market on the side to make some extra money.  Maguire is seeing Cate Blanchett's character, whose a prostitute and agrees to help her get out of Germany and to the United States.  The catch here is that the Russians and two separate departments in the Army are watching Blanchett, hoping that her SS Officer husband is still alive and that she'll eventually lead them to him.  Some of the people want her husband dead, while others want him alive because of his knowledge.  Tobey Maguire is killed off within the first third of the film for being too greedy.  George Clooney is beat up several times throughout the film as he tries to find out more about Blancett and her supposedly deceased husband.  Before the war, Blanchett worked for Clooney and had an affair with him.  He's still in love with her.  Because of his love, he offers to help her and her husband escape and nearly dies in the process.The film, of course, is shot in black and white, and is modeled after the movies of the late thirties and forties.  Soderbergh does an excellent job of capturing that time period and of shooting the film just like a forties' director would've done.  The performances of all the actors are adequate for what they're doing.  There's no Oscar caliber acting in this film, but the performers still do their part to carry the film along.  I was a little confused at the end with all the information that's presented to Clooney's character about Blanchett and her husband and why everybody is after him, but up until that point I thought the movie was rather suspenseful and well done.  It definitely held my interest.  Is this a movie that I'd want to see a second time?  No, but only because there's no stocking scene in it with Ms. Blanchett.

1066535,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000OY8NBK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","""The Good German"" reminds me of the sauerkraut I had to eat as a kid. Sauerkraut is an acquired taste. It looked like sauerkraut but I remember hating the taste. Why? Because my mom just couldn't get the flavor for it right and we often had it from a can. I'm not sure that I would have ever acquired a taste for sauerkraut even if it was homemade but canned sauerkraut captured the ""look"" of the dish but lacked everything else. While ""The Good German"" looks good it misses the essence of the 40's melodramas it's trying to duplicate. The film however certainly has its merits.Director Steven Soderbergh affectionately recreates the look of melodramas that were popular in the 1940's with this film. ""The Good German"" recalls both ""Casablanca"" crossed with ""The Third Man"" with its moody black and white cinematography (done by Soderbergh himself under the pseudonym ""Peter Andrews""). While not entirely successfully, ""The Good German"" does try to marry a 21st century sensibility with its mixture of profanity and the look of a 1945 studio film. Set in post-war Germany just before the Potsdam accord where President Harry Truman, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin divided up Europe, American journalist Jake Geismer (George Clooney) comes over to cover the historical event taking place but suddenly finds he's trapped in a web of deceit, double-crosses and lies regarding the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. The key to it all is a Lena (Cate Blanchett) a former stringer for the reporter who provided reports from Germany in the early days of the war and his former lover. She has now taken up with Tully (Tobey Maguire) a military man doing anything he can to exploit post-War Germany and make a buck in an effort to escape her past and try to escape Berlin as well. Whatever the Americans and Soviets are after, they are willing to murder anyone that gets in their way to use Lena for their own ends.Soderbergh's film hits all the right technical points including using visual references to other classic melodramas from Hollywood's Golden Age but lacks the soul of those films. The script by Paul Attanasio (from the novel by Joseph Kanon) seems as disjointed and emotionless as Soderbergh's glacial direction. ""The Good German"" is all about the ""look"" of the film and surfaces providing an excellent example in recreating the techniques of 40's films without having any of the emotional content. Don't get me wrong ""The Good German"" isn't a bad film--viewers will have a hard time connecting with the characters and being pulled into the film. The mystery at its heart just isn't made compelling enough by the disjointed narrative and even the performances are all about recreating the right ""moments"" from previous films not about creating memorable moments of the performers own. This is the kind of film that you might have casually watched on TV while doing the dishes and other chores without truly becoming involved enough to actually sit down and watch it. The film is R rated for profanity and sexual situations neither one of which would have made it into a 1940's melodrama.The DVD doesn't have any extras which is too bad--it would have allowed the director to elaborate on his experiment and assess where it succeeded and failed. The film looks quite good with some stunning black and white photography that captures the shimmering whites and rich blacks that were characteristic of films from the time.Although ""The Good German"" doesn't taste genuine, it certainly looks it. While I didn't find it emotionally involving, it's an entertaining movie that reminds me of some of Hitchcock's technical experiments like ""Rope"" where the technique was far more important than the material.

1066536,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B000OY8NBK,William Hare,"[65, 76]","""The Good German"" provides viewers with intriguing film noir related to a war setting.  Director Steve Soderbergh opted for a black and white treatment of a film based in war torn Germany at the end of the conflict for a very good reason.Some reviewers were critical of using film noir format at a current point of film making when war ravaged Germany could have been shown using the latest in color technology.  ""What was the point of it?"" critics have asked pertaining to Soderbergh's decision.As someone who has written two books on the subject of film noir, I will use the opportunity to jump into Soderbergh's shoes and explain what I would presume his motivation to be.  While so many critics remain ensconced in the captivating old detective genre starring a Robert Mitchum, Dick Powell or Humphrey Bogart, war provides a starkness all its own.In viewing ""The Good German"" I concluded that the starkness of black and white suited the tenor, tone and mood of a drama set against the rubble of the great city of Berlin after the destruction of war had taken its tragic toll.As for the dramatic elements, George Clooney was ideal as the war reporter who returns to Germany after hostilities have ended and reheats old passions with sleek, sexy and very savvy Cate Blanchett.  When he learns that she has been having an affair with the young soldier who has been assigned to be his driver Clooney becomes disgusted, seeking to learn more about a woman he now believes to be a self-serving opportunist up to her eyeballs in intrigue.After having a violent physical confrontation with his young driver, Clooney becomes more curious as the driver's body washes up on shore after his corpse has been floating in the river.  The reporter becomes more determined to find out more about the woman who had been his lover.  He is now convinced that he knew far less about than he had earlier believed.Cate Blanchett plays her role of a lady of mystery with consummate skill.  She immerses herself in her role as a German so well that she is physically unrecognizable from the star that played another great actress named Kate with a ""K"", namely Hepburn in ""The Aviator.""At the film's end Clooney's confrontation with Blanchett reveals her as someone determined to survive during a war period and in a city where bodies are falling all around her.The lesson to be learned is that life is a battle for survival and that the Blanchetts of the world are the most skilled at playing it, enhancing their chances to endure.  Philosophers continue to ponder the question of the morality of tactics pursued that would be anything but acceptable under less compelling circumstances.",5,Intriguing Wartime Film Noir,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2666,"['Good', 'German', 'viewers', 'intriguing', 'film', 'noir', 'related', 'war', 'setting', 'Director', 'Steve', 'Soderbergh', 'opted', 'black', 'white', 'treatment', 'film', 'based', 'war', 'torn', 'Germany', 'end', 'conflict', 'very', 'good', 'reason.Some', 'reviewers', 'were', 'critical', 'using', 'film', 'noir', 'format', 'current', 'point', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'war', 'ravaged', 'Germany', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'using', 'latest', 'color', 'technology', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'critics', 'have', 'asked', 'pertaining', 'Soderbergh', 'decision.As', 'someone', 'who', 'written', 'two', 'books', 'subject', 'film', 'noir', 'will', 'use', 'opportunity', 'jump', 'Soderbergh', 'shoes', 'explain', 'what', 'would', 'presume', 'motivation', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'remain', 'ensconced', 'captivating', 'old', 'detective', 'genre', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'war', 'starkness', 'own.In', 'viewing', 'Good', 'German', 'concluded', 'starkness', 'black', 'white', 'suited', 'tenor', 'tone', 'mood', 'drama', 'set', 'rubble', 'great', 'city', 'Berlin', 'destruction', 'war', 'had', 'taken', 'tragic', 'toll.As', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'ideal', 'war', 'reporter', 'who', 'Germany', 'hostilities', 'have', 'ended', 'reheats', 'old', 'passions', 'sleek', 'sexy', 'very', 'savvy', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'When', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'be', 'driver', 'Clooney', 'disgusted', 'seeking', 'learn', 'more', 'woman', 'now', 'be', 'self-serving', 'opportunist', 'eyeballs', 'intrigue.After', 'having', 'violent', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'young', 'driver', 'Clooney', 'more', 'curious', 'driver', 'body', 'up', 'shore', 'corpse', 'been', 'floating', 'river', 'reporter', 'more', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'lover', 'now', 'convinced', 'knew', 'far', 'less', 'had', 'earlier', 'believed.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'role', 'lady', 'mystery', 'consummate', 'skill', 'role', 'German', 'so', 'well', 'physically', 'unrecognizable', 'star', 'played', 'great', 'actress', 'named', 'Kate', 'K', 'namely', 'Hepburn', 'Aviator', 'film', 'end', 'Clooney', 'confrontation', 'Blanchett', 'someone', 'determined', 'survive', 'war', 'period', 'city', 'where', 'bodies', 'are', 'falling', 'her.The', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'life', 'battle', 'survival', 'Blanchetts', 'world', 'are', 'most', 'skilled', 'playing', 'enhancing', 'chances', 'endure', 'Philosophers', 'continue', 'ponder', 'question', 'morality', 'tactics', 'pursued', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'acceptable', 'less', 'compelling', 'circumstances']",The Good German

Soderbergh directed (and did the cinematography) for this film... above and beyond all THIS IS A SODERBERGH FILM.  He's up there with the likes of David Lynch and Cronenberg and various other experimentalists or avant-garde-ists.  ""The Good German"" is beyond simply being a film noir, or having A-List actors in it (which he always does)- the film is to produce an effect and evoke something more than your average or even above average film can accomplish.when you deal with a director with this much vision and true artistry, viewers are bound to be polarized (even the ""thinking"" ones).  None of his films do particularly well at the box office and are usually very limited run and more often than not they will be sitting on your local Blockbuster's shelf waiting to be rented by YOU.Solaris:  based on a book AND a prior Russian film.  lots of people ""didn't get it"", others hated it because they felt it was a bad 'adaptation'... simply, it's sodergergh's way of doing it.Kafka:  for those that think they didn't like ""The Good German"" or Kafka, try this one on, then put your critic's hat on (or live under it).i could go on, but i'm really just trying to say that when you watch a Soderbergh film, that's exactly what you going to get- not your film and not anything else....and if your precious little Spider Man suddenly has a foul mouth, a scum-fk personality, and is abusive to women and it stopped you from enjoying the film, then i guess his character was conceived just right ;)",5,um...
