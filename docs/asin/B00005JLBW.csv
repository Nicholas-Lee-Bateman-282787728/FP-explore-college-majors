598032,A2ZQXHBN605JTB,B00005JLBW,"Angela M. Healey ""AngelaMHealey""","[110, 124]","The Osbournes is one of the best TV shows around, and I can't wait for the Complete First Season to come out on DVD.  This version is uncensored, so you can see footage that they didn't show on TV (according to Amazon, on 6 episodes).  This DVD, unlike most television shows that come on DVD has a lot of bonus material and special features, as well as all 10 great episodes from the first series:1. There Goes The NeighborhoodWe meet the family as they move into their new Beverly Hills home. After problems with the furniture, Ozzy displays his dismay with a tricky remote control. Later, Ozzy performs on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"", despite his nervousness. Kelly and Jack have a love-hate relationship and physically fight throughout the episode. The show closes with Sharon trying to sort through her funny family issues.2. Bark At The MoonThe Osbournes are settling into their new house as their pets settle too. Some rambunctious pets ruin the furniture and leave ""presents"" on the ground. Sharon enlists a pet therapist to help the situation. Also, Kelly is pulled over by cops due to poor driving.3. For The RecordThe Osbourne clan visits the ""Big Apple"" sans Jack. As Ozzy makes many guest appearances on shows such as NBC's ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" and TRL, Jack goes to a ""hippy"" camp where he apparently breaks all the rules and has a miserable time. Then the family makes it home in time for Kelly's 17th birthday. Complete with cauldrons and contortionists, Kelly has a little too much fun and gets a tatoo. Meanwhile, a girl sleeps in Jack's room and the door is locked.4. Won't You Be My Neighbor?The epsiode begins with Kelly venting her anger to Ozzy because she has a ob/gyn appointment that she doesn't want to go to. Then Sharon and Jack get upset because their next door neighbors blast techno music at 2:00 in the morning. After Sharon sets them straight by yelling at them and, like an Osbourne, reveals all her opinions. A food fight begins when the neighbors perform a rendition of ""My Girl"" and ham, bagels, and the like enter the backyard next door. After the police pay a visit to the Osbourne home, and they are let off with a warning, Ozzy gets in on the action and breaks a window with a log.5. Tour Of DutyOzzy is about to embark on a U.S. tour and realizes that he's out of shape. He enlists a personal trainer and tries to become healthy. Then, Kelly takes her mom on a shopping spree which leads to Kelly misplacing Ozzy's credit card. It's finally time to go on tour. Jack stays home so that he can start his own record label. Ozzy films a video that spoofs ""Lady Marmalade"" from Moulin Rouge. Ozzy gets upset with Sharon because she booked tour dates in close succession but then he takes to the stage.6. Trouble In ParadiseOzzy is still on tour but suffers a leg injury. Jack struggles to abide by the rules and worries the nanny a great deal. When the patriarch and matriarch return home, Jack is partying with his friends. This leads to a family meeting. Jack and Kelly tell their parents that their lives are different from anyone they know due to touring and fame. Sharon half-understands their dilemma but tells them that they have to stop taking advantage of their parents. Ozzy confronts Jack with his alcohol and drug use and tells Jack to look at how it has affected him. After the talk, Kelly has an epiphany and tells her mom that she will change her friends.7. Get StuffedOzzy still has a foot injury. As he takes too much medicine (with alcohol), he takes the dog out for a surreal walk. Kelly becomes upset because Jack has gotten a lot of recognition in his musical career while she has received none. Kelly seeks consolation from Ozzy, to which he provides little--but does confront Jack. Ozzy then tells the family that he wants to be alone for his birthday. Disregarding his request, the clan surprises him in Chicago and he is pleased.8. No VagrancyJack brings his friend, Dill, a professional skater that is no stranger to alcohol and drugs, into the house so that he can receive the hotel treatment that only the Osbournes could provide. He clashes with the mom and dad: 1) Ozzy never remembers meeting him 2) Sharon finds a bottle of Jack Daniels and attempts to pee in it 3) Dill messes up Sharon's Kitchen 4) Ozzy feels that he's overstayed his welcome. Eventually Dill agrees to leave (as if he had a choice) to Jack's chagrin. Also, Lola, the loveable bulldog, is given away without Jack's knowledge. Ozzy ultimately agrees to bring Lola back as long Jack provides the proper care to the dog.9. A Very Ozzy ChristmasIt's Christmas and the Osbournes celebrate as only they can. Sharon, Ozzy, and Jack are in New York on tour when they receive word that their security guard had been arrested for attempted burglary. They return home and Ozzy gets reacquainted with the dogs...Christmas morning approaches and Lulu (Ozzy's son from a previous marriage)visits. Ozzy helps make Christmas dinner and the meal is filled with feuding words and Kelly eventually leaves the table. Jack then receives a knife and Ozzy confiscates it.10. Dinner With OzzyOzzy reflects on his childhood, life, and family as he dines in front of a camera. He describes his problems and how he doesn't know what a 'normal' family would be. At the end of the episode Ozzy is presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clips are shown of highlights of the family's first season.I would reccomend this to any Osbournes fan, or if you want to know what the fuss is about, buy it and find out.  The first season of 'The Osbournes' is great, packed with special features, never before seen footage and commentary.- E  d  d  y -",5,Osbournes on DVD!,1039651200,"12 12,

If you watch it on DVD, I recommend leaving the ""bleeps"" on (so you can't hear the swearing), because otherwise the show looses much of its charm and cuteness. With the swearing in full-force, it seems much more like a dysfunctional family with way too much money and time on their hands. I only wish I also had the second, third, fourth seasons on DVD, too. But the first season is definitely the best. The bonus features are pretty funny. I recommendthe blooper reel! Pretty funny stuff.

598037,A3CM1CDUSWYDIO,B00005JLBW,Christopher Schmitz,"[2, 2]","Reality TV.  There's no getting away from it.  This trendy new format has generated more flops than successes.  But here is one of its better moments.There's more than meets the eye in ""The Osbournes.""  Its cheesy, artificial classic sit-com opening leads to the opposite:  A voyeuristic camera that captures a real family at its best and worst.  And it's the family of bat-biting ant-snorting Satan-worshipping Black Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne!  You'd expect them to be a little eccentric, and they don't disappoint.  Much campy humor is derived from addled Ozzy, a self-styled ""Prince of Darkness,"" who needs his wife's help for the simplest tasks.  After too many high-decibel concerts and acid trips, Ozzy's speech sounds like it lapses from time to time into Farsi; damned if I can comprehend his mealy-mouthed jabberings.  Luckily, this DVD has an ""Ozzy translator.""Then there's his sweet but steely manager/wife Sharon, part aging roadie, part British grande dame.  Fiercely loyal to her husband and endlessly patient, she's the heart and the brains of the household.  Her withering exchanges with her noisy neighbors, in addition to being hilarious, show her acerbic strength.  Her love of pets has turned their sprawling home into a kennel; animals trot under tables and ooze from every curtain.Then there are the kids:  Stocky, morose, nocturnal Jack (17yo) treats his nanny which staggering disrespect.  He answers the pressing question:  When your dad is a devil-worshipping heavy metal rocker, how can you shock him with your teen rebellion?  Jack is a classic Cali rich kid, clubbing at night, inviting over houseguest himbos that make Cato Kaelin look like Aristotle.  Lethargic and prone to truancy during the day, he comes alive at night; he must have a bit of dad's vampire blood.  Stocky, sassy, pink-haired Kelly livens things up with witty retorts and petulant displays.  The DVD covers only the first (and best) season of the show.  Kelly hasn't yet launched her music career with an apropos cover of Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach.""The house is like the fifth star of the show, a gorgeous Beverly Hills mansion filled with the Osbournes' state-of-the-art electronics and macabre decor.  Theirs is a modern glamorous life full of shopping, fellow celebrities, and high times; also, it's a mundane life full of typical family dysfunction.  It breathes new life into the notion of California as the land of fruits and nuts, and it's as entertaining as anything I've seen on TV in years.",5,It's a Long Slide from the Cleavers,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2511,"['Reality', 'TV', 'getting', 'away', 'trendy', 'new', 'format', 'generated', 'more', 'flops', 'successes', 'here', 'one', 'better', 'moments.There', 'more', 'eye', 'Osbournes', 'cheesy', 'artificial', 'classic', 'sit-com', 'opening', 'opposite', 'voyeuristic', 'camera', 'real', 'family', 'best', 'worst', 'family', 'bat-biting', 'ant-snorting', 'Satan-worshipping', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'lead', 'singer', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'little', 'eccentric', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Much', 'campy', 'humor', 'derived', 'addled', 'Ozzy', 'self-styled', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'who', 'wife', 'help', 'simplest', 'tasks', 'too', 'many', 'high-decibel', 'concerts', 'acid', 'trips', 'Ozzy', 'speech', 'time', 'time', 'Farsi', 'damned', 'can', 'comprehend', 'mealy-mouthed', 'jabberings', 'Luckily', 'DVD', 'Ozzy', 'translator', 'Then', 'sweet', 'steely', 'manager/wife', 'Sharon', 'part', 'aging', 'roadie', 'part', 'British', 'grande', 'dame', 'Fiercely', 'loyal', 'husband', 'endlessly', 'patient', 'heart', 'brains', 'household', 'withering', 'exchanges', 'noisy', 'neighbors', 'addition', 'being', 'hilarious', 'show', 'acerbic', 'strength', 'love', 'pets', 'turned', 'sprawling', 'home', 'kennel', 'animals', 'trot', 'tables', 'ooze', 'curtain.Then', 'are', 'kids', 'Stocky', 'morose', 'nocturnal', 'Jack', '17yo', 'treats', 'nanny', 'staggering', 'disrespect', 'pressing', 'question', 'When', 'dad', 'devil-worshipping', 'heavy', 'metal', 'rocker', 'how', 'can', 'shock', 'teen', 'rebellion', 'Jack', 'classic', 'Cali', 'rich', 'kid', 'clubbing', 'night', 'inviting', 'over', 'houseguest', 'himbos', 'make', 'Cato', 'Kaelin', 'look', 'Aristotle', 'Lethargic', 'prone', 'truancy', 'day', 'alive', 'night', 'must', 'have', 'bit', 'dad', 'vampire', 'blood', 'Stocky', 'sassy', 'pink-haired', 'Kelly', 'things', 'up', 'witty', 'retorts', 'petulant', 'displays', 'DVD', 'only', 'first', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'yet', 'launched', 'music', 'career', 'apropos', 'cover', 'Madonna', 'Papa', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Preach', 'house', 'fifth', 'star', 'show', 'gorgeous', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'mansion', 'filled', 'Osbournes', 'state-of-the-art', 'electronics', 'macabre', 'decor', 'Theirs', 'modern', 'glamorous', 'life', 'full', 'shopping', 'fellow', 'celebrities', 'high', 'times', 'also', 'mundane', 'life', 'full', 'typical', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'new', 'life', 'notion', 'California', 'land', 'fruits', 'nuts', 'as', 'entertaining', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'years']",N/A

No matter what the ratings or sales, the Osbourne family has become one of the focial points of American attention and probably will stay that way for some time. They're a fantastic bunch of people.This DVD set (the uncensored one doesn't have words bleeped out) contains the first season, ten episodes of Ozzy Osbourne, heavy metal rocker; his strong, smart wife-manager Sharon; son Jack and pink-haired daughter Kelly. (And a lot of pets, too) Food fights, pet therapy, teen partying, settling into a new home, dogs messing up the furniture, stolen thongs, and much more pepper this interesting, entertaining TV show. The Partridge Family they ain't... thank God.What makes this middle-aged rocker and his family different from other fly-on-the-wall reality shows? Maybe it's their honesty, maybe it's because they were were the first. With the abundance of the F-word and the don't-kiss-up attitudes, the Osbournes are a breath of fresh air on TV in general. They remain perhaps the only good reality show out there.Even if you weren't a fan of Black Sabbath, you'll quickly become acquainted with Ozzy: eccentric, funny, and profanely sweet at times. Sharon is intensely loyal and loving to her hubby, sometimes acid-tongued, witty, and capable of being as peculiar as he is.  Jack and Kelly serve as exceptional counterpoints to their parents, sometimes petulant, sometimes disobedient, sometimes just doing their best to rebel (clubbing, getting tattoos, and so on). They can be as witty as Sharon, and their exchanges sometimes just blossom into hilarity -- sometimes unintentionally (""I feel like I'm invisible"" ""Shut up!"") And they all love each other quite clearly although they sometimes have odd ways of showing it (""Merry Christmas, baby. Another .... year. I adore you, sweetheart. Now, ... off."")It mostly takes place in the Osbournes' house, a big Beverly Hills mansion that has been decorated in accordance with the Osbournes' personalities. Don't expect a central theme -- lots of weird decorations, plenty of crucifixes, personal bedrooms, and lots and lots of antiques. And the DVD set has plenty of extras -- extra footage, games, ""Ozzy's Ten Commandments,"" interviews, an ""Ozzy translator,"" commentary, and more.Love them or hate them, the Osbournes are undeniably entertaining, and this DVD set is a wonderful means of seeing this show over, and over, and over. (My feelings toward this series are summed up best by Ozzy himself, paraphrased: ""I love you, but you're all ... mad."") Definitely worth getting and keeping.",5,"""We're not the ....

Unfortunately though, the text is in light green and sometimes is hard to read against the background. The too Ozzy for TV scenes and deleted scenes are not too exciting. Another special feature is interviews with each of the family members about the show/experience. I found this very interesting. Also, this is the uncensored version--I would really suggest this because they use profanity a lot and I'd bet you'd get really sick of all the beeps.

This show has a severe case of overateditis.  Actually, the only good aspect about this show is that it shows what people who do drugs on a weekly or monthly basis will be like in thirty years, walking-talking zombies.I grew up with Ozzy's music from a rock `n' roll-like family, but I knew Ozzy had the biggest ego of all time (coming from a guy that bites off bat's and pigeon' heads over being drunk).  He has an even bigger ego than pop-gone-bad Steven Tyler and solo-gone-bad David Lee Roth.Ozzy Osbourne has influenced and inspired a lot of bands we see today.  To put it more lightly, Black Sabbath created heavy metal.  If it weren't for Ozzy and crew, who knows whom we would be idolizing now.But creating an ""in-your-face, we-are-rich-and-stupid, you're-not"" show is a little less than creative.  However, I do give MTV credit.  It's about time they actually do something that involves some form of music since they usually do shows like ""Road Rules"" or ""Real World"", which defeats what MTV is about and stands for.  But a show displaying real intelligence could be much better.Imagine Martin Scorsese directing an episode of ""Undressed"".  That would be more entertaining then seeing an episode of ""The Osbournes"".  Come on.  If you have a bunch of cameraman all around your house, wouldn't you act a little less than ordinary?  That's what makes the show unrealistic.  If you had hidden cameras all around the house, maybe it would work out.Some of our rock legends even disagree about this new chapter in Ozzy's life.  ""I think it's a shame because I think Ozzy is being laughed at,"" Alice Cooper said during an interview on a radio station.  ""And, really, what does that kind of television say about our society?""Even ""Uncle"" Ted Nugent said during a TV interview, ""[The Osbournes display] an indictment to the soullessness of modern man that we get a kick out of witnessing a magnificent creature reduced to a blithering, hopeless idiot.""  Ouch!If that's not enough, what gives Sharon Osbourne the right to insult Ozzy, her family, and rock `n' roll as a whole?  This business deal Sharon made isn't a good one, since she is the brains of the already gone brain cells of Ozzy Osbourne.  She has made her family now commercialized to a point where it's not about rock `n' roll anymore, it's about their riches.I went to ""The Merry Mayhem Tour"" last year at this time, and was never so excited for a concert as I was back then.  But three months later when the first season premiered, I flat out lost all respect for the guy.  While others who aren't even Ozzy fans are getting into this show, I hate it.  The only reason why I watch it is to see what crazy thing Ozzy will do next.  Other than that, I think I'd rather watch a toilet flush, since it has that same-effect.For being a devoted fan over the years, that says a lot.

The mother who readily tells anyone that her husband tried to strangle her on their wedding day, admits to having a lot of plastic surgery, and has recently battled colon cancer. The daughter, who regularly defies her parents and her hair is a different colour each time you see her. And the son, who has been in rehab before his 18th birthday. Not the Simpsons, not even the Partridge family. This was a welcome introduction to the Osbournes, the latest to jump on the reality TV bandwagon. For people who weren't around when Black Sabbath were, will probably know Ozzy Osbourne for biting a head off a bat.The first series only has 10 episodes, which seems kinda strange, but the DVD is definitely worth buying, especially the amount of extras you get. The Ozzy translator is definitely the best extra, it's so funny!The best person in the Osbournes is definitely Ozzy, or maybe Kelly. His facial expressions are classic, and from not knowing how to work the TV remote, to embarrassing his children by kissing his devoted wife in public, every Ozzy moment is the best. Jack, I think, is the most annoying out of them.This series is apparently uncensored. So you hear every single swear word, but Ozzy's middle finger gets blurred out, and also his [behind] when he moons on stage. That's what I call censoring. True, we don't want to see Ozzy's [behind], but he does a lot worse, than stick his middle finger up at the camera, and moon the audience when on stage!This DVD is a must for all Osbournes or not fans.

If they played actual music videos like they did in the old days (was it that long ago?), maybe I'd watch more.  However, whenever ""The Osbournes"" are on, I find myself glued to the TV.  Well, now the entire first season is yours to own on DVD.**NOTE:  Do NOT get the ""censored version.""  I know people like the bleeps, but there is an option on the DVD that allows you to listen to it censored if you like.  So, now you have the chance to hear them both!  So go with the ""uncensored version"" if you want the best buy.**There's no real storyline, there's no cute little set-up, and there's no ""phony characters"" to mix things up.  This is as real as it gets.  Everything you thought Ozzy's life would be is the EXACT opposite.  He's stuck in hell and his family is the main reason.  With a house full of various animals, a son and daughter who fight on a daily basis, and a wife who seems to be the only one who knows how to run things, ""The Osbournes"" is an unpredictable show with surprises around every corner.  But as dysfunctional and weird this family seems, there is love... or at least I think there is...The complete first season is a success in my eyes.  Every single episode is classic and you'll want to watch them over and over again.  If you're having a bad day, you just have to pop this in and you will feel so much better as you laugh along with this whacky family.  Each episode has a very high replay level and you're bound to catch something new that you missed the first time around.This DVD set is fantastic.  I was surprised to learn that you can watch it CENSORED if you like.  I know people are torn on whether to get this uncensored one or the censored version, but now that decision won't be hard to make.  Go with the ""uncensored version"" since you get the choice of either watching it with the bleeps or without.  (I actually think it's funnier to hear them swear without the bleeps.  Hearing Sharon say the ""mother-f"" word is priceless!Extra features included are: commentary, language censoring option for each episode, season highlights, edit a scene, new interviews, additional footage, and so much more.  Lots of goodies for you to explore.""The Osbournes: The Complete First Season Uncensored"" is a fantastic DVD set that has a very high replay level.

I was 13 when I went to my first concert, and of course it was Ozzy.  Ozzy was everything to me...why?  Who can truly answer that when you're a teenager.  Ozzy was rebellion, Ozzy was stick-it-to-the-man, Ozzy was down with authority.  Ozzy was Insane!!!  Later, we realize that our childhood heroes usually don't stand up so well to further examination.  Ozzy was a drug addict.  Ozzy was a boozer extraordinaire.  Ozzy was abusive to his wife.  Ozzy was Insane!!!  So what had changed.  Well...somwhere in the midst of 2002, Ozzy and his wife Sharon decided to throw caution to the wind and let MTV come into their home in Beverly Hills and film portions of their life.  Enter Kelly & Jack and about a million wheezy little rat dogs and you have The Osbournes.  Now we, as voyeurs, like reality TV because most of the time it shows us regular folks how the other half lives.Dad is Ozzy Osbourne, Rock Legend, party animal jumbo deluxe, singer of Heavy Metal anthems, co-founder of Black Sabbath, one of the most influential heavy rock bands ever!  Here we see a kinder, gentler Ozzy, more vulnerable, more mellow, more geriatric as if the excess of partying and drug consumption has left him half alive.  He's quaint.  He's funny.  He's a regular Joe surrounded by the excesses of having a huge career.  The mansions, the jewelry, the crazy spending sprees his wife and daughter seem to love.Then we have Mom, Sharon Osbourne, the woman behind the legend.  Shrewd businesswoman, manager, hard-ass,shopaholic and dog lover.Kelly, the daughter,  the whiner.  Spoiled to the max with her Mercedes SUV and her credit card snatching self.  I am Ozzy's daughter, let me ride that fame for as long as possible. Still, she has her moments.  You want to spank her with a newspaper like one of their little rat dogs from time to time.Jack, the son,  the complete wuss.  A little on the overweight side.  Glasses.  Hair, sort of a semi-afro freaknest, that will never, ever, ever look good. Jack is running around most of the time trying to juggle too many things:  Being Ozzy & Sharon's son, trying to live a normal life, partying, trying to be some sort of promoter or band manager (although we see this happens only because of who his parents are), and fighting with his spoiled sister. Jack is the sincer one, the one we kinda feel sorry for.  He's a dork.  He's a loser.  The underdog of the show.Out of them all, the strange thing is, Ozzy seems to be the most grounded one of them all.  Rock God Ozzy?  Okay.Anyway.  The first season is thoroughly entertaining, watching Ozzy fight with his neighbors and seeing the whole way in which the house runs is hilarious and warm and charming.  The Osbournes curse to their hearts content and that in itself is funny.  Get the uncensored version, however, because you get the choice to bleep or not to bleep.  Hysterical.  Priceless.  And though the later season start to wane in charm, the first season will always remain a ground-breaker and an entertaining enterprise.Years and years later, after all that's been said and done, is Ozzy still my hero?

How times have changed.  Now, Ozzy is a hot commodity, and here is MTV to milk it for all it's worth.  When reality shows were all the rage (it seems like that was forever ago doesn't it?), MTV made a reality show out of Ozzy and his wife Sharon and kids Kelly and Jack (note that Ozzy also has an older daughter with Sharon, whose name I cannot recall, that wanted nothing to do with this godforsaken show) that is obviously staged, totally unfunny (now and then it has its moments), and mindnumbingly painful to watch.  Any true fan of Ozzy will find it painful to watch the godfather of heavy metal stumble around and ramble incoherently, and while I don't blame Ozzy for doing nothing less than selling out (remember, wife Sharon is also his manager), after watching this you'll long for the days of old when Ozzy's fans were really his fans, and not just trendy bandwagon jumpers.  The show's new season debuted with dismal ratings, so hopefully it won't be on for much longer, one can only hope.",1,A disgrace to Ozzy's legacy,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,1319,"['First', 'off', 'want', 'say', 'years', 'was', 'hardcore', 'Ozzy', 'fan', 'even', 'hit', 'teens', 'was', 'definition', 'heavy', 'metal', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'long', 'remember', 'said', 'liked', 'Ozzy', 'people', 'would', 'look', 'disgust', 'say', 'things', 'eww', 'guy', 'who', 'head', 'bat', 'How', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'Now', 'Ozzy', 'hot', 'commodity', 'here', 'MTV', 'milk', 'worth', 'When', 'reality', 'shows', 'were', 'rage', 'was', 'forever', 'ago', ""n't"", 'MTV', 'made', 'reality', 'show', 'Ozzy', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'kids', 'Kelly', 'Jack', 'note', 'Ozzy', 'also', 'older', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'godforsaken', 'show', 'obviously', 'staged', 'totally', 'unfunny', 'now', 'then', 'moments', 'mindnumbingly', 'painful', 'watch', 'true', 'fan', 'Ozzy', 'will', 'find', 'painful', 'watch', 'godfather', 'heavy', 'metal', 'stumble', 'around', 'ramble', 'incoherently', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Ozzy', 'doing', 'nothing', 'less', 'selling', 'out', 'remember', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'also', 'manager', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'long', 'days', 'old', 'when', 'Ozzy', 'fans', 'were', 'really', 'fans', 'not', 'just', 'trendy', 'bandwagon', 'jumpers', 'show', 'new', 'season', 'debuted', 'dismal', 'ratings', 'so', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'longer', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope']",N/A

I have to wonder at the mindset of those who would entertain the concept of producing such an unlikely and profane show.  But you know something?  It works. Ozzy Osbourne and wife/manager Sharon ARE likeable but I really can't say why. I think we can all agree that at its core, this is a family that is fiercely loyal to one another and really do love one another albiet in wildly eccentric ways that is thankfully, alien to the experience of most people. If a show ever drove a stake through the heart of a family unit headed by the likes of Ward Cleaver, this show most certainly qualifies.

Even Rosie O'Donnell, when she was asked if she would ever do the show, replied, &quot;I'd rather give birth to a porcupine...backwards!&quot;That said, and the fact that &quot;Survivor&quot; was always scheduled up against something else I enjoyed much more to begin with...The Osbournes are TRUE reality television...hey, even filthy rich people need to take the trash out once in awhile or deal with the pets doing something they shouldn't (and in THEIR house, that's easy to find). Someone once told me they'd rather remember Ozzy as being the bigger-then-life Black Sabbath singer from 1972...fact is, he's in his fifties and has a family to deal with. What could be more reality-based than that? They say what's on their minds, sometimes they fight like cats and dogs (not to mention THEIR cats &amp; dogs) but what's obvious underneath it all is that they love each other and that all the money in the world doesn't have to change someone.
