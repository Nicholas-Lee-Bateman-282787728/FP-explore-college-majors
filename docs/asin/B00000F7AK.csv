I would recommend this film to the fans of ""Zulu"" but do not have high expectations.  To the filmmakers credit they try to meticulously portray the events that led to the massacre of British troops at the hands of Zulu warriors.  It's not the filmmakers ambition that I'm criticizing but in the way they execute their story.  The events preceding the battle border on the stuporous.  The film feels like it's populated by re-enactors as opposed to actors playing real men.  This is odd because of the presence of fine actors like Burt Lancaster and Peter O'Toole in the cast.

499538,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,B00000F7AK,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[13, 19]","First off DO NOT compare this to the Stanley-Baker 1964 epic.  This is different kettle of fish entirely.  I made that the mistake the first time I watched it and I came away dissatisfied.  If you are familiar with Zulu, you go in with preconceived expectations.  The comparison off the bat can make you prejudice against a fine work.Cy Endfield co-wrote the epic prequel Zulu Dawn 15 years after his enormously popular Zulu. It was intended to be a trio of films - with a third movie Ulundi to round out what Cy had to say about British imperialism - the ""Little England"" mentality.From point one the contracts are seen.  In Zulu you have a small pocket of a few over 100 Brits holding out against 4,400 Zulu - fresh from Islandlwana (the story told in Zulu Dawn).  This is a story of courage, will and determination.  Is a positive movie.  Zulu dawn on the other hand is a heart-rendering movie. Nearly 1400 soldiers and native levies were slaughter in a a matter of hours by over 10,000 Zulus.  Why because of Brit arrogance.  Lord Chelmsford (Victoria's cousin by the way - which may be why he wasn't punished for this fiasco!!)  Treated the Zulu campaign as a lark in the park.  He divided his forces in the face of the enemy, not once, but several times, resulting in the disaster at Islandlwana, as well as leaving other pockets of solders held up in the fashion you saw Baker and Caine - for months, in some cases over a year.  These death had to fall on Chelmsford's head.The second contracts Zulu saw is a picture of the whole army under Chelmsford.  A contrast into the Brits lifestyle vs the Zulu.  The contrast of arrogance vs might and true military genius.  So the story is less focused on just one or two individuals such as Chard and Bromhead, but only the various commanders and officers. So the personal involvement isn't there.Beautifully filmed, is a a good companion piece to Zulu and Shaka Zulu.  Some of my favourite films.Just don't compare it to Zulu and you will find you enjoy the film.  However, it does tear the heart, instead of uplifting it as Zulu does.  It's a very a very realistic look at the worse military blunder until modern times, and likely STILL the worst defeat by a ""modern"" equipped army against native warrior warmed with only spears.Just so sad the third film was never completed.",5,excellent example of Military arrogance,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2328,"['First', 'off', 'DO', 'NOT', 'compare', 'Stanley-Baker', '1964', 'epic', 'different', 'kettle', 'fish', 'entirely', 'made', 'mistake', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'came', 'away', 'dissatisfied', 'are', 'familiar', 'Zulu', 'go', 'preconceived', 'expectations', 'comparison', 'bat', 'can', 'make', 'prejudice', 'fine', 'work.Cy', 'Endfield', 'co-wrote', 'epic', 'prequel', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', '15', 'years', 'enormously', 'popular', 'Zulu', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'trio', 'films', 'third', 'movie', 'Ulundi', 'round', 'out', 'what', 'Cy', 'had', 'say', 'British', 'imperialism', 'Little', 'England', 'mentality.From', 'point', 'one', 'contracts', 'are', 'seen', 'Zulu', 'have', 'small', 'pocket', 'few', '100', 'Brits', 'holding', 'out', '4,400', 'Zulu', 'fresh', 'Islandlwana', 'story', 'told', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'story', 'courage', 'will', 'determination', 'positive', 'movie', 'Zulu', 'dawn', 'other', 'hand', 'heart-rendering', 'movie', 'Nearly', '1400', 'soldiers', 'native', 'levies', 'were', 'slaughter', 'matter', 'hours', '10,000', 'Zulus', 'Why', 'Brit', 'arrogance', 'Lord', 'Chelmsford', 'Victoria', 'cousin', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'punished', 'fiasco', 'Treated', 'Zulu', 'campaign', 'lark', 'park', 'divided', 'forces', 'face', 'enemy', 'not', 'once', 'several', 'times', 'resulting', 'disaster', 'Islandlwana', 'as', 'well', 'leaving', 'other', 'pockets', 'solders', 'held', 'up', 'fashion', 'saw', 'Baker', 'Caine', 'months', 'cases', 'year', 'death', 'had', 'fall', 'Chelmsford', 'head.The', 'second', 'contracts', 'Zulu', 'saw', 'picture', 'whole', 'army', 'Chelmsford', 'contrast', 'Brits', 'lifestyle', 'Zulu', 'contrast', 'arrogance', 'vs', 'might', 'true', 'military', 'genius', 'story', 'less', 'focused', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'individuals', 'such', 'Chard', 'Bromhead', 'only', 'various', 'commanders', 'officers', 'personal', 'involvement', ""n't"", 'there.Beautifully', 'filmed', 'good', 'companion', 'piece', 'Zulu', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'favourite', 'films.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Zulu', 'will', 'find', 'enjoy', 'film', 'However', 'tear', 'heart', 'instead', 'uplifting', 'Zulu', 'very', 'very', 'realistic', 'look', 'worse', 'military', 'blunder', 'modern', 'times', 'likely', 'STILL', 'worst', 'defeat', 'modern', 'equipped', 'army', 'native', 'warrior', 'warmed', 'only', 'spears.Just', 'so', 'sad', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'completed']",N/A
499539,ALCTVUGB5WZG1,B00000F7AK,Dennis J. Buckley,"[3, 3]","From the outset, I have to admit that ""Zulu,"" is one of my favorite films.  No matter how hard I try to be objective, my review of ""Zulu Dawn,"" is colored by Endfield's first film of the Zulu War.  But I have watched ""Zulu Dawn"" several times over the years, and it is a worthy effort.The positive: The depiction of the Battle of Isandhlwana.  As with other colonial battles that had few or no survivors on the British side, there is and probably ever will be debate about ""what happened"" and ""who was to blame.""  Endfield's great strength is in letting the battle tell its own story, and including respectful but not hero-worshipping characterizations of the combatants.  While I strongly suspect that the Zulu organization and command and control was better than what we see, that's a minor point. Endfield does depict the well known theory that the British lines ran short of ammunition.  He also accurately shows how overextended the lines were.  If Puillene had ""lagered"" as the Boers did at Blood River and Chard did (almost by default) at Rorke's Drift, the battle might have turned out very differently.The negative: The lead up to the battle paints the Brits just a shade too black, in my opinion.  Arrogance and hubris there seems to have been in plenty, but I also suspect there was a leavening of just plain stupidity and abysmally poor management thrown in.  How that could have been captured, I am not entirely sure, but more depth in the characterization of key players like Chelmsford would have made this an even better movie.  When you have Peter O'Toole available, do something more with him!The movie is not only worth watching, it has a place in any collection of films about the British Empire.  Depicting a battle in writing, let alone on film, is daunting-- recall Wellington's words likening it to trying to write the history of a ball. Endfield comes closer to catching an historic battle on film-- in its entirety-- than any other work that I am aware of.Two minor points: I wish we had been shown the ultimate fate of the fictional Lieutenant Vereker.  I like to think that he got away.  And ""the end of a great dynasty,"" referred to at the end of the film has nothing to do with the British Empire.  Disraeli was speaking of the death of the last lineal male descendant of Napoleon Bonaparte in a skirmish during the war.",4,Better with Age,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2350,"['outset', 'have', 'admit', 'Zulu', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'be', 'objective', 'review', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'colored', 'Endfield', 'first', 'film', 'Zulu', 'War', 'have', 'watched', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'worthy', 'effort.The', 'positive', 'depiction', 'Battle', 'Isandhlwana', 'other', 'colonial', 'battles', 'had', 'few', 'survivors', 'British', 'side', 'probably', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'debate', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'was', 'blame', 'Endfield', 'great', 'strength', 'letting', 'battle', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'including', 'respectful', 'not', 'hero-worshipping', 'characterizations', 'combatants', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'Zulu', 'organization', 'command', 'control', 'was', 'better', 'what', 'see', 'minor', 'point', 'Endfield', 'depict', 'well', 'known', 'theory', 'British', 'lines', 'ran', 'short', 'ammunition', 'also', 'accurately', 'how', 'overextended', 'lines', 'were', 'Puillene', 'had', 'lagered', 'Boers', 'did', 'Blood', 'River', 'Chard', 'did', 'almost', 'default', 'Rorke', 'Drift', 'battle', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'very', 'differently.The', 'negative', 'lead', 'up', 'battle', 'Brits', 'just', 'shade', 'too', 'black', 'opinion', 'Arrogance', 'hubris', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'also', 'suspect', 'was', 'leavening', 'just', 'plain', 'stupidity', 'abysmally', 'poor', 'management', 'thrown', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'am', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'more', 'depth', 'characterization', 'key', 'players', 'Chelmsford', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'When', 'have', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'available', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'place', 'collection', 'films', 'British', 'Empire', 'Depicting', 'battle', 'writing', 'let', 'alone', 'film', 'daunting', 'recall', 'Wellington', 'words', 'likening', 'trying', 'write', 'history', 'ball', 'Endfield', 'closer', 'catching', 'historic', 'battle', 'film', 'entirety', 'other', 'work', 'am', 'aware', 'minor', 'points', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'fictional', 'Lieutenant', 'Vereker', 'like', 'think', 'got', 'away', 'end', 'great', 'dynasty', 'referred', 'end', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'British', 'Empire', 'Disraeli', 'was', 'speaking', 'death', 'last', 'lineal', 'male', 'descendant', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'skirmish', 'war']",N/A

What's not to like?Here's the scoop. The Brits are in Africa. They want to not only inhabit, they want to rule, so they are going to impose their will on the Zulu and ask them to step down for no real reason. The Zulu king figures the Brits wouldn't do it if he asked so why should he? So they go toe to toe with some devastating results for the Brits.This was a real chapter in history and it feels as though they stuck close to the general way things actually happened. The Brits are depicted as racist and stodgy. They are trying to bring England to Africa. They are too organized for this circumstance. The Zulu seem to be doing just fine. They're predominantly farmers who are able to feed themselves and they have an organized society. The Brits are the intruders. Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) is pompous and figures there is no way he can be beat by these savages. As a result he doesn't think things through well enough and ends up making poor decisions in regard to strategy. The Zulu hand the Brits the defeat of all time.This is a cool flick in the classic sense. The set up and execution seem right out of the manual. The characters are written well enough (some needed more filling out) and the Zulu aren't made to appear less than human. They're smart and brave. Good use is made of location and the acting is steady. Almost every actor you've ever seen in any British movie is here. This is a solid effort all the way around. Unfortunately, it seems this was a straight film to DVD transfer with no enhancements. The picture quality is decent enough but the sound is awful.

Those reviews are accurate FOR THOSE EDITIONS.  However, this DVD/Blu-Ray combo is the real deal. The film is in its original widescreen aspect ratio and it looks great on a widescreen TV, a pretty good transfer with beautiful color for the sweeping battle scenes. My only quibble: volume seems awfully low, and I had to crank it up to hear properly.""Zulu Dawn"" chronicles the vents leading up to Lord Chelmsford's ill-fated expedition into Zululand where 20,000 Zulus overwhelmed a poorly situated garrison of British troops on the slopes of Ishandlawana hill. The film is a prequel to the classic ""Zulu"", which depicts the battle of Rorke's Drift that took place later that same day. (These two films make for an awesome double feature.)While this film never achieves the artistry of ""Zulu"" (which is visually stunning and properly regarded as a classic.) it is a well-paced, well-produced epic in its own right. Unlike ""Zulu"", this film sticks pretty close to the historical events and some of it was filmed at actual locations.

499554,A1H3YRJR5N8A9W,B00000F7AK,J. C. Darling,"[14, 18]","Ok, I just watched ""Zulu Dawn"", and although it is a good movie - and, allegedly, more historically accurate than ""Zulu"" by some accounts I have read - it lacks the drama and the human interest value of the earlier film.In ""Zulu"", you get to know the characters from the officers down to the privates. Relationships between the privates and the officers and non-coms are an integral ingredient to the success of ""Zulu"". In ""Zulu Dawn"", characters ARE introduced to the viewer, but there is some dynamic missing. You aren't given enough of an insight into the characters. This results in many lost opportunities in the film.There is simply something more personal about ""Zulu"" than ""Zulu Dawn"". In ""Zulu"", you are more invested in what is happening because of the character developments and the troop's comradery so well portrayed in that film. ""Zulu Dawn"" DOES introduce you to the officers Chelmsford, Durnford, etc... but I never felt as if I got to know them as well as I did Bromhead and Chard, Hook and Colour Sgt. Bourne, etc. After all, in a military drama, what is most important to portray is the special comradery that can only be achieved by those who fought together - who fought, literally, for their lives! It's the reason movies like ""Glory"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are so good. I felt that a battle like that which was fought at Isandlwana could have been ripe with opportunities for nail-biting, heart-wrenching, dramatic vignettes. But, unfortunately, I didn't get any of that.One other point I want to make concerns the actual battle scenes themselves... If one has seen the film ""Waterloo"", then they will have noticed the epic battle scenes which were taken straight from some of the best-known paintings of the time. The scene of the charge of the Scots Grays is taken right from the Lady Butler painting, for example. That kind of imagery is vital, in my opinion, for a successful war film. You need to freeze time in war films in order for the viewer to really appreciate what happened. Otherwise, the chaos of warfare is not easily translated to film. Now, the way the battle of Isandlwana is portrayed in ""Zulu Dawn"" may very well be as close to historical accuracy as possible: hords of zulu warriors sweeping through the British camp and overwhelming everything in their path. Ok... I know that is what happened. But, how about a 20-30 second vignette based on the famous painting of the last stand of the 24th by Charles Fripp? Where was the scene of the last surviving troops being ordered to ""fix bayonets, and die like British soldiers do!""?  ... followed by a slow aerial pull-back from the small band of the 24th as the Zulus close in, closer and closer, until no more red coats are visible! What a scene THAT would have made! And what about the partial eclipse of the sun which apparently occured during the battle? Not a hint? Come on! The battle scenes were rushed through, and not enough attention to human interest and drama was paid to it. Too bad.Again, I go back to ""Waterloo"" as an example of how a war movie should be filmed. Sergei Bondarchuk did some incredible work with aerial views and slow motion to great dramatic effect.The arrogance and folly of the British military seems to be the focal point of this film.  We all know that this is exactly what lead to the slaughter at Isandlwana, and it is right to have put that point across in the film. However, the desparate fighting and brave stands made by the Brits should have received top billing. If not, then certainly a balance of the two could have been achieved.The scene of Coghill and Melville attemptimg to save the Queen's colours was about the best scene in the whole movie. But, again, I did not feel for them the way I feel for Bromhead and Chard when I watch ""Zulu"".All in all, a good film. But, I won't be returning to it as often as I do ""Zulu"".Added 5/9/06:I just viewed ""Zulu Dawn"" for a second time, and although I still do not think it is as good as ""Zulu"", I liked it more the second time 'round. As for character develoment, I think Burt Lancaster's portrayal of Colonel Durnford is one that merits ""sympathy"" from the viewer, while Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Chelmsford as an arrogant, single-minded, pompous *ss is also worthy of praise.",3,"Sorry... not as good as ""Zulu""",1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,4265,"['Ok', 'just', 'watched', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'good', 'movie', 'allegedly', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Zulu', 'accounts', 'have', 'read', 'drama', 'human', 'interest', 'value', 'earlier', 'film.In', 'Zulu', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'officers', 'down', 'privates', 'Relationships', 'privates', 'officers', 'non-coms', 'are', 'integral', 'ingredient', 'success', 'Zulu', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'characters', 'ARE', 'introduced', 'viewer', 'dynamic', 'missing', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'insight', 'characters', 'results', 'many', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'film.There', 'simply', 'something', 'more', 'personal', 'Zulu', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'Zulu', 'are', 'more', 'invested', 'what', 'happening', 'character', 'developments', 'troop', 'comradery', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'DOES', 'introduce', 'officers', 'Chelmsford', 'Durnford', 'etc', 'never', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Bromhead', 'Chard', 'Hook', 'Colour', 'Sgt', 'Bourne', 'etc', 'military', 'drama', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'portray', 'special', 'comradery', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'who', 'fought', 'together', 'who', 'fought', 'literally', 'lives', 'reason', 'movies', 'Glory', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'felt', 'battle', 'was', 'fought', 'Isandlwana', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ripe', 'opportunities', 'nail-biting', 'heart-wrenching', 'dramatic', 'vignettes', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'that.One', 'other', 'point', 'want', 'make', 'concerns', 'actual', 'battle', 'one', 'seen', 'film', 'Waterloo', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'noticed', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'straight', 'best-known', 'paintings', 'time', 'scene', 'charge', 'Scots', 'Grays', 'taken', 'right', 'Lady', 'Butler', 'painting', 'example', 'kind', 'imagery', 'vital', 'opinion', 'successful', 'war', 'film', 'need', 'freeze', 'time', 'war', 'films', 'order', 'viewer', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'happened', 'Otherwise', 'chaos', 'warfare', 'not', 'easily', 'translated', 'film', 'Now', 'way', 'battle', 'Isandlwana', 'portrayed', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'close', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'possible', 'hords', 'zulu', 'warriors', 'sweeping', 'British', 'camp', 'overwhelming', 'everything', 'path', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'how', '20-30', 'second', 'vignette', 'based', 'famous', 'painting', 'last', 'stand', '24th', 'Charles', 'Fripp', 'Where', 'was', 'scene', 'last', 'surviving', 'troops', 'being', 'ordered', 'fix', 'bayonets', 'die', 'British', 'soldiers', 'do', 'followed', 'slow', 'aerial', 'pull-back', 'small', 'band', '24th', 'Zulus', 'close', 'closer', 'closer', 'more', 'red', 'coats', 'are', 'visible', 'What', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'what', 'partial', 'eclipse', 'sun', 'apparently', 'occured', 'battle', 'Not', 'hint', 'Come', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'rushed', 'not', 'enough', 'attention', 'human', 'interest', 'drama', 'was', 'paid', 'Too', 'bad.Again', 'go', 'back', 'Waterloo', 'example', 'how', 'war', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'filmed', 'Sergei', 'Bondarchuk', 'did', 'incredible', 'work', 'aerial', 'views', 'slow', 'motion', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect.The', 'arrogance', 'folly', 'British', 'military', 'be', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'lead', 'slaughter', 'Isandlwana', 'right', 'have', 'put', 'point', 'film', 'However', 'desparate', 'fighting', 'brave', 'stands', 'made', 'Brits', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'top', 'billing', 'not', 'then', 'certainly', 'balance', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved.The', 'scene', 'Coghill', 'Melville', 'attemptimg', 'save', 'Queen', 'colours', 'was', 'best', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'feel', 'Bromhead', 'Chard', 'when', 'watch', 'Zulu', '.All', 'good', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'returning', 'as', 'often', 'do', 'Zulu', '.Added', '5/9/06', 'just', 'viewed', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', 'second', 'time', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'as', 'good', 'Zulu', 'liked', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'character', 'develoment', 'think', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'portrayal', 'Colonel', 'Durnford', 'one', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'portrayal', 'Chelmsford', 'arrogant', 'single-minded', 'pompous', '*ss', 'also', 'worthy', 'praise']",N/A

It's just not very exciting.While ZULU dealt with the siege at Rork's Drift in the aftermath of the battle of Isandlhwanna, this film deals with the battle of Isandlhwanna itself. In the 1870s, the British government of Natal in South Africa feared that the Zulu were growing too strong. They delivered to the Zulu king an ultimatum with which he could not comply. They then invaded. Everyone thought that the best infantry in the world, the British army, would soon put a Zulu notch in the imperial belt. Instead, the 24th regiment of foot was wiped out by Zulu impis at Isandlhwanna. This is the story of that disastrous campaign.Peter O'Toole plays Lord Chelmsford with all of the arrogance which ultimately led to the destruction of the British expeditionary force. Burt Lancaster plays one of his knowledgeable officers and Bob Hoskins plays the regimental sergeant major. Each does a good job of portraying the character but the whole does not stand together as well as it should.

499562,A3R7MXVQRGGIQ9,B00000F7AK,"Joseph J. Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[1, 1]","This movie is considered a prequel to the classic and great movie Zulu.  There is an all star cast in this DVD which includes Burt Lancaster, Peter O'Toole, Simon Ward and Bob Hoskins.  The story is based on a factual incident in history about the conflict between the British and the Zulu nation.In January of 1879 the arrogant British offcials sent a message to the Zulu King demanding the King change his policies.  The King refused to give in to the British official.  The British were confident that their superior fire power and military experience would easily beat the Zulus.  Needless to say, they were dead wrong.  They encountered 25,000 angry Zulus and the British soldiers were slaughtered, causing this historical defeat for the British military.One of the interesting things about this film is that 13,000 actual Zulu warriors were used in the making of this historic movie.  The movie started out a little slow but it was not long before the British crossed the river and engaged the Zulu.  I liked the movie Zulu better, but this one (Zulu Dawn) is also very memorable and well worth viewing.In conclusion, if you are a history buff and enjoy good solid military movies, you may want to check out this one.Rating:  4 Stars.

I am bit puzzeled by many of the previous reviews written on this film. It seem that many of the reviewers expects historical accuracy from movies. How can such expectation be after watching movies like Braveheart, Patriot, Windtalkers or Pearl Harbor??Zulu Dawn gives a pretty good coverage of the initial stages of the Zulu War, one of many wars of aggression fought by the British Empire during the 19th century although it no worst then the wars of aggression United States wages against the American Indians during the same period. While not historically accurate per say, it gives a nice accountability of the British arrogance and greed versus the natives' defiance toward the imperial order.Top notch cast with Peter O'Toole, Burt Lancaster and Simon Ward helped this movie considerably. Bo Hoskins as one of the sergents definitely add color to the cast. The events in the movie lies from the British point of view. Like all movies, there were historical free plays given to add spice, tension and characters to the historical events. Thats to be expected....!!The battle scenes were well done and British mistakes well presnted even if they may or may not be historically accurate.The DVD edition of this movie is not in Widescreen at all. Its in pan and scan mode like the VHS. I guess the company who came out with this edition can't find the widescreen version. It almost looks like they just took the VHS version and clean it up for DVD. That is quite disappointing to say the least and I expect that the price of this movie will drop considerably because of it. The image is also pretty average, okay on my outdated big projection TV but I am willing to guess that it may look bit crappy on a better TVs out there. This is also a very strip down DVD with no extras.Most people who buy this DVD now will only do so to replaced their old VHS tape. For the other fans, I would strongly recommend waiting for a massive price drop before buying this P/S version, the initial price is definitely too expensive for such a low quality material.

The anti-British bias of the movie hurts its accuracy.  For one, the Zulu Kingdom was not some innocent, put upon people.  Shaku Zulu had spend years creating a brutal tribal kingdom that was under his complete control.  His seccessors were no less brutal.  King Catayweo may have been marginal less dictatorial than Shaku, but only by degrees.  Despite this flaw, the movie is still worthwhile.  Peter O'Tool lays it on thick by making Lord Chelmsford look the arrogant fool.  This was not quite the case.  Burt Lancaster does a nice job as Durnsford, and Simon Ward is great as the young gent recruit in the native horse.The battle scene at Ishlandwana is impressive, but almost totally inaccurate.  For one thing the British firepower kept the Zulus pinned for quite a while.  The movie shows them charging forward ever invincible.  Only when the Britsh fire slackend were they able to surge forward and break the line.  The movie does not show this.  Also the Zulu prisoners reporting the British position back to the main Impi is pure fantasy!  This never happened and is another attempt by the movie to make the British look cruel and stupid!  There are some other flaws, but to me these are the most serious.The production quality is first-rate, and the attention to the flow of historical events is well done, if a little confusing at times.  Those not familar with the campaign may have problems following it.  Although portrayed as one of the most serious defeats ever in British military history this is also an exaggeration.  The Zulu campaign was a embarrassment in some ways for the British, and also an un-wanted conflict, but the ultimate result was a crushing British victory a few weeks later under Chelmsford. Those who want a truly crushing victory of the natives over the Europeans should check out the fate of the Italians in Ethiopia in 1896! That was a true debacle.  The British endured their set-back and came back for the final win as they often did.

It seems to have been actually filmed at Isandalwana, Natal where the action took place.  Unfortunately, this movie should have come out before the excellent 'Zulu', simply because the massacre at Isandalwana occurred before the fight at Rourkes Drift depicted in Zulu.It is also not quite as good of a film as is 'Zulu' which is a bit difficult to understand because this is clearly the better and more expensive production.  In 'Zulu' the acting is decidedly uneven. In ""Zulu Dawn"" the acting is very good.This is the story of the largest, or one of the largest, destruction of European troops at the hand of 'barefooted natives' in history.  The British, because of supposed Zulu provocation, invade Zululand.  The Zulu prepare for a fight.  The British aren't worried--they have little respect for the fighting qualities of the Zulu--and split their force.  One force, split off from Gen. Chemsford's [Peter O'Toole's] main force by several miles, chances on a few Zulu herders.  At least they think it is just a few Zulu.  Zulu Impis have concealed themselves in broken ground in front of the British camp.The Zulu attack taking heavy casualties from the fast shooting English but things start to go wrong.  The movie shows an overly officious ordinance NCO as being tardy in the distribution of ammunition.  Other sources claim, however, that the rifles got gummed up and jammed by black powder residues.  No matter.  The English couldn't maintain their rate of fire and suddenly the Zulu were among them, stabbing with their lethal assegai's [in Zulu the name of the weapon is for the sound of the short spear being jerked from a wound].  Suddenly the entire English force is in disarray and the Zulu are among the tents.  They run down and kill soldiers trying to flee.I'm still not sure why this is not as good of a film as 'Zulu'.

Frankly, I had given-up hope on ever seeing ""Zulu Dawn"" transferred to blu-ray. Amazingly, it here and although it's still the poorer step-child to the magnficently restored ""Zulu"", this prequel is still very good, and well-worth acquiring.I'm not a geek, but I though other viewers might appreciate to read what the experts on blu-ray releases have to say about this particular title. Now, perhaps, my other wish that someday ""Khartoum"" and ""55 Days at Peking"" might make their blu-ray debut before my eyes are too weak to appreciate the gift!""Zulu Dawn is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Severin Films with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 2.35:1 (this may mean that Severin has finally forsaken the older MPEG-2 codec for its Blu-ray releases). Severin is touting this as having been restored, and it must be admitted that the elements are in remarkably good condition overall, with one notable exception. Several times throughout the film there are what appear to be a missing frame, leading to just very slight jumps in the fluidity of the motion. It's really noticeable in the clips in the main The History of the Zulu Wars featurette included as a supplement, and at times almost looks like what you see when a PAL source has been converted to NTSC. That anomaly aside, this is really a rather nice looking high definition presentation. My hunch is there has been some noise reduction applied to this release, but there is definitely fine grain (as in fine grain) noticeable when the film is in motion, especially in the many outdoor scenes where it's quite visible in the skies. Colors are nicely robust (if the reds are just slightly on the orange side, as the screenshots accompanying this review show) and fine detail pops quite well in close-ups.Severin Films is still getting its feet wet in the Blu-ray market and it's a good sign that this release has a lossless audio option. Both a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono mix as well as a Dolby Digital 2.0 (mono) mix are included on this Blu-ray. The lossless track sounds very good indeed, with dialogue clean (if sometimes a bit hard to decipher due to the accents) and Elmer Bernstein's exciting score well rendered. Anyone who is a fan of Bernstein's amazing work in Hawaii knows how well the composer utilizes ethnic instruments (especially percussion) and voices, and he does much the same thing in this film. While this track is obviously narrow, it has some requisite dynamic range, especially in several key action sequences.* The History of the Zulu Wars (1080p; 25:34) is a really interesting documentary featuring Ian Knight, author of Zulu Rising - The Epic Story of Isanlwana and Rorke's Drift, who provides a wealth of background information and context that really helps the viewer to better appreciate some of the finer details of the film.* Recreating the War (480i; 20:19) looks back on the historical accuracy of the film, and includes interviews with Midge Carter (a male), who was thehistorical advisor.* A Visit to the Battlefield (480i; 16:47) features Ian Knight again, taking us on a little guided tour of the actual historical locations.* Theatrical Trailer (480i; 3:00)* Outtakes (480i; 12:14). These are in pretty poor shape, image wise, but they're fascinating to watch as they show director Douglas Hickox in action.

499592,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00000F7AK,Trevor Willsmer,"[8, 9]","""One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeared of no one man. But the Zulu, they come in the thousands, like a black wave of death in the thousands.""Zulu Dawn isn't in the Zulu league, but if you're interested in the period and can overlook a few historical errors, it's a good addition to that curious subgenre of British epics celebrating their humiliating military defeats. In its determination to set some of the colonial myths straight it does tend to overlook the Zulus' own imperial ambitions, divided leadership and tactical stupidity, but it's well staged with an exceptionally strong cast of familiar British faces and a wildly miscast Burt Lancaster offering one of the screens worst Oirish accents. The battle's a long time coming, but is worth the wait, and the film is genuinely spectacular, with director Douglas Hickox pulling off a particularly impressive river crossing sequence to the accompaniment of Elmer Bernstein's stirring score. However, if you don't get off on troop deployments and crowd scenes of colourfully clad British soldiers on the veldt, you'll probably find it heavy going for the first hour.Sadly, as others have noted, this is a very shoddy DVD - like the UK issue it's cropped from its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio to 1.85:1 and with an inferior sound mix (the theatrical release prints had an excellent stereo soundtrack) and no real extras to speak of despite plenty being available. A very poor show indeed. It's worth noting, however, that the French PAL disc not only boasts a good transfer in the original 2.35:1 ratio with removeable French subtitles but also includes the theatrical trailer and is well worth seeking out if you have a multi-region player.",3,A historic disaster on a disastrous DVD,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1703,"['One', 'Zulu', 'only', 'one', 'man', ""'m"", 'afeared', 'one', 'man', 'Zulu', 'come', 'thousands', 'black', 'wave', 'death', 'thousands', 'Zulu', 'Dawn', ""n't"", 'Zulu', 'league', ""'re"", 'interested', 'period', 'can', 'overlook', 'few', 'historical', 'errors', 'good', 'addition', 'curious', 'subgenre', 'British', 'epics', 'celebrating', 'humiliating', 'military', 'defeats', 'determination', 'set', 'colonial', 'myths', 'straight', 'tend', 'overlook', 'Zulus', 'own', 'imperial', 'ambitions', 'divided', 'leadership', 'tactical', 'stupidity', 'well', 'staged', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'cast', 'familiar', 'British', 'wildly', 'miscast', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'offering', 'one', 'screens', 'worst', 'Oirish', 'accents', 'battle', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'wait', 'film', 'genuinely', 'spectacular', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Hickox', 'pulling', 'off', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'river', 'crossing', 'sequence', 'accompaniment', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'stirring', 'score', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'troop', 'deployments', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'colourfully', 'clad', 'British', 'soldiers', 'veldt', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'heavy', 'going', 'first', 'hour.Sadly', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'very', 'shoddy', 'DVD', 'UK', 'issue', 'cropped', 'original', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'inferior', 'sound', 'mix', 'theatrical', 'release', 'prints', 'had', 'excellent', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'real', 'extras', 'speak', 'plenty', 'being', 'available', 'very', 'poor', 'show', 'indeed', 'worth', 'noting', 'however', 'French', 'PAL', 'disc', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'transfer', 'original', '2.35:1', 'ratio', 'removeable', 'French', 'subtitles', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'well', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'have', 'multi-region', 'player']",N/A
499593,A37A80Z0L8GZU3,B00000F7AK,Tyson D. Rahmeier,"[48, 55]","ZULU DAWN is a superb companion film to the classic ZULU, particularly since both films were written by the same man, Cy Enfield.  ZULU DAWN climaxes with the Battle of Isandhlwana, which immediately preceded the Battle of Rorke's Drift, accurately portrayed in ZULU.  While the Battle of Isandhlana is important, the real significance of ZULU DAWN lies in its revelation of how the British governor of South Africa orchestrated the war against the Zulu.  Moreover, the British governor, Sir Henry Bartle-Frere, acted against the wishes of Queen Victoria and Parliament, resulting in the bloody defeat and near annihilation of the British 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandhlwana.  The arrogance and carelessness of the British is shocking and the humiliating defeat of the British army in South Africa strikes the viewer as completely justified. The fact that good copies of ZULU are hard to find is pitiful enough, but the unavailability of ZULU DAWN is a real tragedy.  It's extremely difficult to rent; it's been out of print so long that most recent video rental establishments have never been able to acquire it.  I myself have only encountered two copies for sale ever, and I bought both of them (one went to my uncle, who turned me on to ZULU DAWN in the first place).
