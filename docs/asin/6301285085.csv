Foster plays a gang-raped survivor looking for justice in hyprocritical world where men are not held responsible for their actions. Foster received a well-deserved Oscar as her fearless performance of Sarah. There is a graphic rape scene towards the closing of the film that is to be expected since the main theme of this film is about the outcomes of a terrible and vicious rape. Unfortanely, females are still considered ""damaged goods"" when something this hineous occurs. McGillis's character seeks justice from the men who raped her in a downtown bar and even goes after the men who watched and cheered on the rape and did nothing to stop it. A powerful and superb film all around. This film will force you to see the truth and make you want to change the legal system.

248896,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301285085,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The thing about `The Accused' is that, while it came before them, it resembles the onslaught of Lifetime films that center on the same subject and for all it's worth, it doesn't really contain much quality.  It is a standard courtroom drama that places a victimized woman at the center of a hot button issue and expects the audience to react to it.  It also allows a young Jodie Foster to completely rip the scenery to shreds between her teeth, gnawing and chewing and spitting and ultimately sputtering into a hot mess.  In all honesty, McGillis delivers a far superior performance that handles the weight of the `subject' with depth of understanding.  Sadly, Foster is a lot of surface hysterics, which is great if you want an Oscar I guess.  It's similar to what happened in the Lead Actor category that same year, with Hoffman winning for a gimmick while his co-star, Tom Cruise, actually delivered a fully fleshed out character.  Alas, `The Accused' takes a serious crime, throws in an air-tight case and buckles up for a predictable and well-meaning yet underwhelming ride.  The lathered on stereotypes, the stop-go pacing and lack of true development leave this one to skip; unless you're a diehard fan of Foster (in that case, you've already seen this).",2,"I don't want to point fingers, but...",1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1261,"['thing', 'Accused', 'came', 'onslaught', 'Lifetime', 'films', 'center', 'same', 'subject', 'worth', ""n't"", 'really', 'contain', 'much', 'quality', 'standard', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'victimized', 'woman', 'center', 'hot', 'button', 'issue', 'audience', 'react', 'also', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'completely', 'rip', 'scenery', 'shreds', 'teeth', 'gnawing', 'chewing', 'spitting', 'ultimately', 'sputtering', 'hot', 'mess', 'honesty', 'McGillis', 'far', 'superior', 'performance', 'weight', 'subject', 'depth', 'understanding', 'Sadly', 'Foster', 'lot', 'surface', 'hysterics', 'great', 'want', 'Oscar', 'guess', 'similar', 'what', 'happened', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'category', 'same', 'year', 'Hoffman', 'winning', 'gimmick', 'co-star', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'actually', 'delivered', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'Alas', 'Accused', 'serious', 'crime', 'air-tight', 'case', 'up', 'predictable', 'well-meaning', 'yet', 'underwhelming', 'ride', 'lathered', 'stereotypes', 'stop-go', 'pacing', 'lack', 'true', 'development', 'leave', 'one', 'skip', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'Foster', 'case', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen']",N/A

248898,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301285085,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 2/08Rate: 72/08: The Accused is a good film that deserves a solid rating of `7'. At the same time, there are nice moments tied together by weak threads. I don't think the performances of Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis are extraordinary, but they do a pleasant job of making a small picture to work. Then again, it's hard for me to believe Jodie Foster as a ""rape victim"" when it's clearly obvious that she, because it's Jodie Foster, was not in fact raped. There goes the credibility out of the window. So, excuse me for being cynical. On the other hand, the courtroom scenes along with the construction are fair and sometimes incomplete. In a point of view, the rape victim, played by Jodie Foster, is being viewed as somebody who ""asked for it,"" while, in another point of view, she is simply a rape victim. Anyway, I like the message that comes out of The Accused, and it probably pays homage to raped females wherever they are. Hopefully, they get their justice served by putting the scumbags away to prison for life. However, I do think that the direction in The Accused is a bit lacking, and the movie can have been a tiny bit better. Strangely, the actual rape scene looks ""entertaining"" when it's not supposed to be. By a comparison, the rape scene during the introduction of Death Wish II is a lot more brutally graphic. In so many ways, The Accused comes off looking like Lifetime Television movie of the week. Somebody else in Jodie Foster's place would have given the role the justice it deserves. Kelly McGillis does an okay job, and she looks less mannish this time around than she did during Top Gun. All in all, The Accused is not a bad piece of work, but, of course, I could have been fooled by it being a made-for-TV picture.",4,Jodi Foster as a Rape Victim?

For one thing, her accent keeps slipping between that weird southernish accent she has, and a New Jersey-esque accent. That is not something an Oscar-winner should do. Other than that her acting is good but not Oscar worthy.The film starts out with Jodie running out of a bar, and with a man calling 911 saying a woman is being raped. The lawyer who takes her case lets the rapists plead down to some lesser charge that isn't associated with sexual assault. This makes Jodie's character very angry. The (female) lawyer begins to feel bad and wants to pin a rape-ish charge on someone. She goes against all the male partners at her firm, and prosecutes the men who watched and cheered the rapists on. If she can convict them, not only will they go to jail, but the men already in jail for the rape, will actually be convicted of rape and it will be on the books or whatever. A matter of principle I guess. That man who called 911 is the only one who can really verify that she was raped and that the others cheered it on. But he doesn't want to testify...This film is all about man-bashing and it is painfully obvious. The man who can prove she was raped doesnt want to come forward, the rapists dont even realize they have committed rape, the male prosecutors are all against the woman lawyer who wants justice for Jodie, Jodie's boyfriend is insensitive to the fact that she was gang raped, on and on. This movie clearly sends the message ""Men bad, woman (not matter how cheap and loose) good""Jodie's character is a trashy slut. No one deserves to be raped, but she plays a real low-life in this movie. I actually liked that about the film. It wasn't some innocent virgin who just got mauled. It was a really trashy girl, so trashy that no one in the bar did anything about her rape because she was such a loose scumbag that everyone just thought it was her usual antics.It's a good story, but the way that they made it so ""all men are evil"", it felt like a TV movie on Lifetime. It is pretentious in that way. The movie constantly reminds you that all the men are bad, and the woman is a poor helpless thing. If the movie didn't insist I was an idiot and barrage me with all this ""insensitive male"" crap, I still would have gotten the point, and I wouldn't have rolled my eyes at the movie as much as I did.I don't feel this is worth owning, unless you are a huge Foster fan.

I think the title of this film plays off that. It is really about Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster), as if she were on trial, as if she were the accused. It was a very difficult role, considering all she had to go through, and then two grueling trials on top of that. As an actress Foster would have to walk a very fine line. She was sexy, flirtatious, and very drunk and high, but did she deserve to be raped? Jodie Foster was quite the brave one. She dared to take her character to the very edge of the abyss, where the jury--not to mention the audience--is almost thinking that she was asking for it.After the men who raped her are put away, but with very light sentences for ""reckless endangerment,"" Attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) puts the men who watched and cheered the rapists on trial. Though there is no ""Good Samaritan"" law, that would make it illegal to witness a crime and do nothing, there is a law against ""criminal solicitation"" encouraging a crime. It was a very unusual interpretation of the law by Sarah's attorney; and one that the D.A. Paul Rudolph vehemently disapproved of. Kelly McGillis portrayed Murphy's change of heart well. By giving the men a chance to plea bargain, she was de facto admitting that she thought her case was weak. She is really going out on a limb with her unusual prosecution, but that is the only way they can get it on record that a rape had occurred so the rapists will serve out their maximum sentences.--------------Sarah Tobias: What are our chances?Kathryn Murphy: 50-50 at the most. Good night.Sarah Tobias: Good night.====================Jodie Foster was great as Sarah Tobias, and she won an Oscar for her performance. A very well deserved Oscar. Foster has been acting since she was a child. I recall seeing one of her first film performances as a tom boy named Audrey in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" She continued to impress, holding her own as Iris against Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver."" Since ""The Accused"" she has won another Oscar for ""The Silence of The Lambs.""Leo Rossi deserves mention for his portrayal of Cliff Albrecht, one of the men on trial for cheering and egging on the rapists. With his beady eyes and scorpion tattoo he oozed menace. He really threw himself into his role with relish. There is a great scene where he recognizes Sarah in a record store that serves as a catalyst for all that follows.I find ""The Accused"" guilty. Guilty of being a gripping court room drama--and one of the best performances of Jodie Foster's illustrious career. It is not to be missed, and I sentence one and all to watch it, in spite of the dark and heavy material.

The rapists have hired one of the best criminal attorneys in the country and it looks to be an impossible to win case.It's a film that stops just short of pandering to what the audience wants to see and then becomes a riveting court-room type film that almost could play on television.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[3, 4]","Adapted from a real-life case, veteran actress Jodi Foster won the first of her two Oscars as bar fly Sara, the victim of a brutal gang rape that is witnessed and cheered by onlookers at a dive bar. Sara's assailants are afforded less serious charges and, thus, lesser sentences, and it is their treatment by the judicial system that ignites Sara's own cry for justice. Enter prosecuting attorney Kelly McGillis, charged by Sara of sacrificing her victimization, who goes after the onlookers who encouraged the attack. The legal issue, then, is whether an onlooker can be prosecuted for encouraging an offense. It's an enticing legal question that is intelligently asked by this film's magnificent script, bolstered by fine acting. And the rape scene is savage!

It teaches audiences that it's difficult to convict rapists, even with a lot of evidence.  The emotional stance of the film is true.  The trauma and fears during and after is expressed to the fullest.  Every struggle keeps audiences interested in every event, leading to a surprising conclusion.  Its certain graphic scenes were necessary to film to show the issue's depth.  The details prove that the writers researched rape to its fullest, which deserves them tremendous respect.Jodie Foster's Oscar winning role (Best Actress) as Sarah is one of her career bests.

248913,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,6301285085,David Seaman,"[1, 1]","""The Accused"" is a film based on a true story that is folklore to residents of Eastern Massachusetts when a woman was beaten and gang raped at Big Dans bar in Fall River and not only did no one try to help her, but a crowd of men gathered and began to cheer the rapists on.The film open with Jodie Foster, playing a young twenty-something named Sarah, bursts screaming out the door of the Bar into a dark parking lot on an industrial street. She is shoelss, blouse torn. SAarah is screaming; tears and shock. Her eyes darting back and forth as if she doesn't trust the air that surrounds her. Where will the next attack come from? She was running just to run; there was no concious destination. We see a young man in a truck, just as shocked but more calm.(He is key later on) Then we see her in a pay phone booth. (they still existed in the mid 1980's.) and it;s clear that through her tears she is calling for help.Then we watch her undergo a humiliating medical exam at a hospital. The camera is on her eyes and her eyes tell us exactly what is happening to her. The doctor and nurses are gentle but business like and give her intrsuctions. She is clearly in shock. Foster acts with her eyes and the things she does in this scene are enough to win the Oscar, though there's so muhc more to come. Finally a rape crisis councellor arrives. She is allowed to shower, the first of many and given clothes. After fifteen miunutes into the film we hear Foster deliver her first lines. Her voice is hoarse and the bruises on her neck indicate why. The councellor is asking her questions. Foster is chain smoking, her hand shakes each time she lifts the cigarette to her lips. It is clear that she is an uneducated blue collar citizen. She behaves with bravery.Then we are at home with her. The trailer is hers. Her boyfriend is there, smoking pot and drinking beer. She takes a few hits as well and we can feel the palpable tension because he doesn't know how to react and she feels as if he is disgusted by her. He almost as much says, ""Get over it"" before she throws him out.And the film is under way.The preppy college boys who actually rapoed her atop a pinball machine plea down to a lesser charge and Foster's public defender (Expertly played by Kelly McGinnes) accepts this plea without running it by Foster. Foster arrives at this womans home in the middle of a dinner party and tears her to pieces about how she sold her out; how she allowed those ""animals"" to beat and molest her ""while my crotch was exposed to all of those people!"" and the choked tears are controlled. We see that she is a strong and intelligent woman, albeit uneducated.She knows what is right and she feels that the D.A. has let the ball drop on this one. The boys will be out of jail with very little interruption ot their education. Let alone their lives. Sarah will never be the same again.To repent, McGillis decides to charge all of the spectators with accomplice to rape. And now we have a ballgame.I didn't see ""The Accused"" until after the shock of hearing that the child star, Jodie Foster had won Best Acttress over the skilled supurb performance by Streep in ""Silkwood"". But by the end of seeing this film I saw that Foster was a treasure. The film works with flashbacks of course- how better to do a court room drama- so we have the entire two hours to see her strength, to develop her character and earn our repsect.Sarah is a remarkable woman. Her strength isn;t easy; she just needss to be strong bcause right is right. We are rooting for this tiny, frail David against a Corporate Goliath that would set a precedent (and indeed did- anyone watching the news had that information going in.) Foster plays trailer trash with dignity, as Sean Penn gave Sam dignity for the educationally challenged.Like the famous scene in ""Sophies Choice"" which will go down in history as the best performahnce by anyone, Jodie Foster delivers a remarkable performance at the climax of the film and we are forced to watch, experience and FEEL what this poor young woman endured. Not just the physical trauma of rape and the humiliation that goes with it- the passing back and forth- but the chants of the drunken men circled around the room makes the circumstances of hell even more shocking. Watching this scene is traumatic; we can uin derstand that liv ing it must have been horrific. Foster's testimony is strong and even her tears fall down cheeks that are stern; her shoulders  are square. That ten  minute sequence is in a class with the train station scene in ""Sophies' Choice"". It will change you; make you grow and be a better person.The film moves us deeply but it also teaches us and makes us better people.This is one of the best films made in the 1980's. It appeared quietly without fanfare and after Foster won the Oscar if slipped into a catagory that makles it historic. Foster has spent her entire career facing controvery in her films and even the way she worked. This is Fosters most moving percormance which says a great deal considering her role in ""Silence of The Lambs"", ""The Brave One"" and ""Nell."" This is a woman who could take a screenplay with a male action hero and play the lead. she is effective. She is slectric. She is amazing. The gift she's given the world is unmeasureable and this film is one that you must see. As far as the pain we must enduire at times through the film, Foster provides us with a poyaoff at the end that shows us how to heal ourselves.",5,1988 Best Acttress who beat Meryl Streep in

Aesthetically time hasn't been completely kind to this film.  I also have a mild issue with this film in  that its themes are practically directly lifted from I Spit on Your Grave,  the infamous 1978 exploitation film that already very fully explored the  grotesque idea of rape as male sport.  In the 1982 French film L'Amour  Viole (Rape of Love) the same themes were explored, with a more sensitive  hand and less primal an approach.  In this respect The Accused is almost  redundant.This is a gross simplification on my part, however, and now  I'll go back a bit:  Jodie Foster's lead performance here is stunning and  brave, recalling the grit she first showed in Martin Scorsese's Taxi  Driver.  Leonard Maltin may argue that the re-enactment of the rape was  unnecessary, but as played by Foster, the sequence added much-needed  realism to the character's experience.  In fact, if the rape were never  shown, you could even argue that cinematically it never happened at  all.Foster's performance of course carries this film, and The Accused  still has a place in history as being a Hollywood rarity:  This was one of  the first truly mainstream, big-budget Hollywood films to deal with rape as  a crime.  I would say that I Spit on Your Grave's primitive mindset offers  an even more interesting alternate outlook on the  victim-perpetrator-spectator dynamic while L'Amour Viole is artier and more  intimate.  But The Accused, derivative (or at least precursored) as it is,  still holds up comfortably.",4,"Sublime acting, but slightly dated.",948240000,"01 19, 2000",2000,1605,"['Accused', 'distinctly', 'flavour', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'design', 'style', 'Aesthetically', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'completely', 'kind', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'mild', 'issue', 'film', 'themes', 'are', 'practically', 'directly', 'lifted', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'infamous', '1978', 'exploitation', 'film', 'already', 'very', 'fully', 'explored', 'grotesque', 'idea', 'rape', 'male', 'sport', '1982', 'French', 'film', ""L'Amour"", 'Viole', 'Rape', 'Love', 'same', 'themes', 'were', 'explored', 'more', 'sensitive', 'hand', 'less', 'primal', 'approach', 'respect', 'Accused', 'almost', 'redundant.This', 'gross', 'simplification', 'part', 'however', 'now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'bit', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'lead', 'performance', 'here', 'stunning', 'brave', 'recalling', 'grit', 'first', 'showed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'may', 'argue', 're-enactment', 'rape', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'played', 'Foster', 'sequence', 'added', 'much-needed', 'realism', 'character', 'experience', 'fact', 'rape', 'were', 'never', 'shown', 'could', 'even', 'argue', 'cinematically', 'never', 'happened', 'all.Foster', 'performance', 'course', 'film', 'Accused', 'still', 'place', 'history', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'rarity', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'truly', 'mainstream', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'deal', 'rape', 'crime', 'would', 'say', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'primitive', 'mindset', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'alternate', 'outlook', 'victim-perpetrator-spectator', 'dynamic', ""L'Amour"", 'Viole', 'artier', 'more', 'intimate', 'Accused', 'derivative', 'least', 'precursored', 'still', 'up', 'comfortably']",N/A

These were questions that were rarely asked in the 1980s, but at the time when this controversial film was released, these issues were starting to become very high profile, public issues. For this reason, the film is effective. The other reason the film is effective is because Jodie Foster disappears into her role as the rape victim. And Kelly McGillis is a strong advocate for Foster's character and for the pursuit of this issue of prosecuting rapes and the rapists who perpetrate such crimes.

It is an eye-opening film that wants you, hence us, to realize the seriousness of rape. Not maybe the crime itself. No one will reject, entirely at least, the criminal nature of this act, even if some men may look at it with dubitative eyes and gross jokes in the mouth. But what this film is all about concerns justice for one and the  audience  of the rape for two. Justice finds it difficult to go to court and they prefer at times some deal rather than a full-out trial. It is easy. It gives the attorney some good conscience. And it does not rub the wide public too much against their grain. But the most difficult problem of the two is the attitude of the  audience  of the rape. A rape is often a multiple event that engages several men in the act, several, rapists but also several and at times many spectators. You can find different behaviors in front of such a crime. Those men who will look or even watch, shocked in their deepest unconscious or subconscious mind, but who will do nothing to stop it or to expose it. Then you have those men, and at times women, who will be shocked and will walk away and try to forget. Finally you have those men who will encourage the  show  and become accessories of the crime without realizing they are becoming accessories of a crime, entirely taken up by the action and their thrilled excitement. Which is worse : to be a rapist or to be a thrilled, excited and encouraging if not even more accessory ? I do not know, but the film definitely considers that both are crimes, and they are. Is it as simple as that to say that without such an  audience  many rapes would not take place ? Maybe. Do those accessories have to be tried, convicted and sentenced severely ? Probably, because after all they may become some kind of master-minds to the rape itself, though to behave like that is not really to show the intelligence we could expect from a master-mind. Such films will never be outdated as long as that crime exists, even if it were possible to reduce the numbers. That crime is massive in numbers and it is committed most of the time by perfectly sensible, intelligent, coherent people, who yet demonstrate that in some conditions they lose all their sense, intelligence and coherence. It is a crime that does not require the slightest amount of intelligence to be performed. In fact it even requires to have as little intelligence as possible : a rapist loses all sense of decency, most of the time. Of course it is a surviving practice in our societies where ethics have changed tremendously, and yet the animal is so close to the surface of so many people, men, should I say, because rapists are essentially men.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,To encourage a rape is a crime,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,2748,"['film', 'aged', 'yet', 'brightly', 'up-to-date', 'eye-opening', 'film', 'hence', 'realize', 'seriousness', 'rape', 'Not', 'maybe', 'crime', 'one', 'will', 'reject', 'entirely', 'least', 'criminal', 'nature', 'act', 'even', 'men', 'may', 'look', 'dubitative', 'eyes', 'gross', 'jokes', 'mouth', 'what', 'film', 'concerns', 'justice', 'one', 'audience', 'rape', 'two', 'Justice', 'difficult', 'go', 'court', 'prefer', 'times', 'deal', 'rather', 'full-out', 'trial', 'easy', 'attorney', 'good', 'conscience', 'not', 'rub', 'wide', 'public', 'too', 'much', 'grain', 'most', 'difficult', 'problem', 'two', 'attitude', 'audience', 'rape', 'rape', 'often', 'multiple', 'event', 'several', 'men', 'act', 'several', 'rapists', 'also', 'several', 'times', 'many', 'spectators', 'can', 'find', 'different', 'behaviors', 'front', 'such', 'crime', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'look', 'even', 'watch', 'shocked', 'deepest', 'unconscious', 'subconscious', 'mind', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'stop', 'expose', 'Then', 'have', 'men', 'times', 'women', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'try', 'forget', 'Finally', 'have', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'encourage', 'show', 'become', 'accessories', 'crime', 'realizing', 'are', 'becoming', 'accessories', 'crime', 'entirely', 'taken', 'up', 'action', 'thrilled', 'excitement', 'Which', 'worse', 'be', 'rapist', 'be', 'thrilled', 'excited', 'encouraging', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'accessory', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'definitely', 'are', 'crimes', 'are', 'as', 'simple', 'say', 'audience', 'many', 'rapes', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'Maybe', 'Do', 'accessories', 'have', 'be', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'severely', 'Probably', 'may', 'become', 'kind', 'master-minds', 'rape', 'though', 'behave', 'not', 'really', 'show', 'intelligence', 'could', 'expect', 'master-mind', 'Such', 'films', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'outdated', 'as', 'long', 'crime', 'even', 'were', 'possible', 'reduce', 'numbers', 'crime', 'massive', 'numbers', 'committed', 'most', 'time', 'perfectly', 'sensible', 'intelligent', 'coherent', 'people', 'who', 'yet', 'demonstrate', 'conditions', 'lose', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'coherence', 'crime', 'not', 'require', 'slightest', 'amount', 'intelligence', 'be', 'performed', 'fact', 'even', 'have', 'as', 'little', 'intelligence', 'possible', 'rapist', 'sense', 'decency', 'most', 'time', 'course', 'surviving', 'practice', 'societies', 'where', 'ethics', 'have', 'changed', 'tremendously', 'yet', 'animal', 'so', 'close', 'surface', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'men', 'should', 'say', 'rapists', 'are', 'essentially', 'men.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

248931,AILXRYWN97P7O,6301285085,Kirsten Abercrombie,"[9, 38]","Ostensibly a polemic against rape, this movie is actually an exercise in male-bashing. What proves that is one line in which the ""heroine"" just has to say to the one man most sensitive to her cause and the one who deplored her victimization all along, ""You're not like all the others -- you're worse!"" I suppose defenders of the movie will say that, since it's based on a true story, it should realistically portray its subject, right down to what she (understandably?!?) said in a moment of anger. But like most movies based on true stories, it's based only loosely on its true story, and if there was any one detail to leave out, that would be it. A lot of movies loosely based on true stories seem to have a knack for leaving in the one thing best left out. In her acceptance speech for her ill-gotten Oscar for playing this caustic ""heroine"", Jodie Foster said the movie's message was about treating people nice. Too bad she was so apparently clueless as to how un-nice it is to tell the one man in the movie sympathetic to her cause that he wasn't like the rapists but worse. We really need to ask what kind of message it sends - if you're a man who deplores rape and tries to be helpful to a victim, you'll get told you're not like the rapists but worse. Surely the truth of the matter must be that such a deplorable attitude does more to encourage than to discourage rape.

Second, Jodie Foster gives an excellent performance and provides an unflinching look at how rape can ruin a victim's life.Also, this film deserves credit for portraying the victim as a strong willed character who is far from perfect-and it sends the message that flirting with someone does NOT mean that you deserve to be raped. And I applaud the fact that this film doesn't take the extreme view (hello Lifetime channel) that all men are pigs who either enjoy victimizing women or don't see anything REALLY wrong with doing so.

Her character determinedly fights against all odds to be as brave as possible when she has hardly any support from anyone, and even her lawyer seems to think she partly deserved to be raped.  The film demonstrates, however, that even when a woman flirts, wears skimpy clothing and has too much to drink/does drugs, nothing should ever take away her right to say ""no"" to sex.  One reviewer thinks this film is about male-bashing.  The scene she refers to, where she tells a potential witness that he's ""worse than the others"" takes place right after he informed his lawyer that he really ""didn't remember"" what happened in the bar and that the lawyers pressured him into testifying.  Since he was the only witness who was able to help her, it should come as no shock that she was upset and hurt that he chose to back out of testifying and stick up for his rapist friend rather than her, the rape victim.  In the end, though, he went with his conscience and told the truth, that he did watch her get raped and he knew who had cheered it on--and at that point, Jodie's character was most grateful towards him.

248944,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,6301285085,Movie Fan,"[10, 11]","The Accused is a powerful movie to educate the ignorant world about the law. The movie focuses on the fact that it is not only a crime to commit a rape, but it also a crime to induce, persuade, and convince a person to continue or and commit a rape. The second thing that this true story focused on was, no matter how you dress, how you act, how many lovers you've had, how you talk, or where you live, you deserve a fair trial, fair treatment, and justice like anyone else. The most brilliant thing about this film is they showed the actual rape scene. Once you see it, you have a whole new perspective on things. You sympathize for the victim even more. You also realize that she didnt ask for it what so ever. This really took place in a small town back east, but some details were changed as with all based on a true story films. The woman was actually gang raped on a pool table, not a ping ball machine. Thing movie was not a male basher. I.E. kennenth joyce, the good guy who reported the rape. He witnessed the rape, knew they were raping her, and felt sympathy for Sarah Tobias. It was just a trashy bar full of desperate guys who behaved badly and were criminals. Smiling, lifting eyebrows, and dancing, does not mean a woman is asking to get raped. She was the victim and was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Another senstitive subject for me is these big shot defense attorneys who tear a person's character apart. They dig up past mistakes that a person made and try to make a jury think that the victim deserved it, or asked for it. Being premiscuos in the past has nothing to do with the NO MEANS NO LAW. It's your body, you can say no. Foster is a brilliant and talented actress who does not agree to roles that are meaningless. She takes her acting career seriously which is why she diagreed to Hannibal. She would not play a role in a film with no imagination or meaningful insight, i.e. pure violence. Hannibal turned out to be a horrible film anyways. Fosster knows what she is doing! Her roles are strong women, who have a lasting influence on the viewers. I.E silence of the lambs. The Accused is no exception. It's a movie I saw when I was a teeneager and never have forgotton what it stood for. During a famous rape case recently, a cab driver told me ""the victim had numerous lovers, she was a bad girl."" I wanted to tell him to rent the accused because bottom line, if a person is raped, it's a crime and the victim deserves as much sympathy as anyone else. Justice does not discriminate. It isnt suppose to. Only the defense attoryneys try to turn everything upside down. I was so angry when the lawyers kept saying ""these men had sex with Sarah Tobias and no one knew it was a rape.""

First a movie about a crime, then a movie about society's responsibility in the crime.Jodie Foster is a fiery independent woman who goes to a local bar after a fight with her boyfriend.  She has mischief on her mind but when a group of frat boys decide they will not take no for an answer, they rape her on the pinball machine.She then faces further humiliation of the police and the degradation of trial where she, the victim, is put on trial.  After the perpetrators are acquitted, the prosecutor (Kelly McGillis) puts the spectators on trial.  This movie says that not only are the people who commit the crime responsible but those who stand by and encourage it to happen.Tom Topor wrote the outstanding screenplay.  He also wrote the play and screen adaptation of Nuts, another great courtroom drama.  His heroine is not a clean cut  responsible person but a flawed woman trying to make a living and a life.  This is more realistic than other films that would have a perfect Sarah.Jodie Foster gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance.  This was her coming out party. She was no longer a child star or a sensation. Kelly McGillis gives her best performance of her career.

Although her lawyer (McGillis) believes her, her past involving drugs works against her and the rapists are put away for only three to five years.  The guilty McGillis then sets about trying to prosecute those that watched the rape, in doing so letting Foster tell her story.There is obviously a lot to criticise here, although the central performances and the reluctant friendship that the two women form pull it above the usual courtroom fare.  Foster pulls in an absolutely outstanding performance that makes you forget all about `Silence Of The Lambs'.  She manages to be both feisty and vulnerable at the same time and your eyes will be fixed on her in every scene that she's in.  That's certainly not to say that McGillis isn't just as good, as she underplays effectively in a less showy role.  In short, they work together perfectly, making the quietly respectful friendship the two form never appear clich&eacute;d or dull.  The movie also wisely steers clear of pushing any feminist message too far, making this simply a movie about one woman and her struggle for justice.  It's a credit to Foster that this struggle is never less that riveting.A great deal is made of the explicit rape scene, which is without a doubt incredibly disturbing.  Although some may see it as the emotional weight of the movie, Foster's performance is enough to convince you of the hell her character's been put through.  Still, it's not often that a movie often known purely for its explicit nature should turn out to actually be pretty accomplished.",4,Impressive thriller,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1617,"['law', 'room', 'thriller', 'woman', 'Foster', 'who', 'raped', 'seedy', 'bar', 'lawyer', 'McGillis', 'past', 'involving', 'drugs', 'works', 'rapists', 'are', 'put', 'away', 'only', 'three', 'five', 'years', 'guilty', 'McGillis', 'then', 'trying', 'prosecute', 'watched', 'rape', 'doing', 'so', 'letting', 'Foster', 'tell', 'story.There', 'obviously', 'lot', 'criticise', 'here', 'central', 'performances', 'reluctant', 'friendship', 'two', 'women', 'form', 'pull', 'usual', 'courtroom', 'fare', 'Foster', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'forget', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'be', 'feisty', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'fixed', 'scene', 'certainly', 'not', 'say', 'McGillis', ""n't"", 'just', 'as', 'good', 'effectively', 'less', 'showy', 'role', 'short', 'work', 'together', 'perfectly', 'making', 'quietly', 'respectful', 'friendship', 'two', 'form', 'never', 'appear', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dull', 'movie', 'also', 'wisely', 'steers', 'clear', 'pushing', 'feminist', 'message', 'too', 'far', 'making', 'simply', 'movie', 'one', 'woman', 'struggle', 'justice', 'credit', 'Foster', 'struggle', 'never', 'less', 'riveting.A', 'great', 'deal', 'made', 'explicit', 'rape', 'scene', 'doubt', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'may', 'see', 'emotional', 'weight', 'movie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'enough', 'convince', 'hell', 'character', 'been', 'put', 'Still', 'not', 'often', 'movie', 'often', 'known', 'purely', 'explicit', 'nature', 'should', 'turn', 'out', 'actually', 'be', 'pretty', 'accomplished']",N/A

The Accused is based on a true story and though it sets out to educate it becomes tedious and falls under the same hole many rape films fall into: focusing too much on the lawyer and not enough of the victim. I think the film should have opened with us seeing Sarah Tobias before the rape. Let us get a chance to see where's she's been, what kind of woman she is, how she handles situations like this. As a woman I find it important to break down the characterization in a movie like this. Starting off with her running from the bar was a good hook but all through the film I felt something was missing because we never got a chance to see who Sarah Tobias really was.This is a great film to open people's eyes. Women can smoke pot, drink and even strip but that doesn't give anyone the right to rape them. I think that was the best thing The Accused presented. It was important that they focused on that. Sarah wasn't the greatest woman in the world but it was important to show that no matter how a woman acts or was raised it doesn't make her self-worth any less important than anyone else's. Jodie Foster did a good job. She seemed bored with the film until the rape scene when she fully got into character. Some say this rape scene was horrifying. Well it's nothing compared to watching or being a victim of a real-life rape. Compared to that this movie was like watching Barney. Hollywood can't begin to imitate the act of a true rape, though this film comes closer than many.The Accused is not for everyone. Some people claim they can't see it more than once. If you haven't seen it you're missing out on a very powerful film. But don't expect to be entertained all the time.

However, there are some negative facets as well.I didn't think that the acting, overall, was all that impressive.  For example, there's a witness who expresses concern about assisting in an investigation because some of the people involved are pretty scary.  Hollywood does a lot better at making people appear dangerous than what we see in ""The Accused"".  We understand who the bad guys are and we generally get the impression that they deserve whatever they have coming.  However, they come across, to me, more stupid than scary.  I suspect that the script and casting may have been at fault as much at the actors themselves.  Then again, costumes and make-up could have helped as well.  The whole cast left me expecting better.  Jody Foster won the Best Actress Oscar in a weak year in a role that virtually guaranteed a nomination for whomever got the part.  She did alright but, again, costumes and make-up failed in their job.  Jody looks a little too well-kept to play the role as I understood it.  She looked more like a sorority sister suffering from laziness and bad judgement than a working girl on a dead end path.To preface my final point, I have to admit that I watched this movie on TV and on a family oriented channel.  I assume that the movie I saw was ""sanitized"" for general audiences.  I also note that it is an R-rated movie in its' theatrical release.  However, I came away thinking that I had watched a ""made for TV"" movie.  There's just something missing from ""The Accused"" that makes it seem that no one put too much time and effort into making it.  It's a good movie for the reasons that I mentioned above.  The legal issue involved was unique and, though it may have its' detractors, the movie makes a good case for it.  The way we are kept in suspense as to what to expect next worked well and kept me guessing.  What helped even more is not knowing exactly what DID happen until the last 20 minutes or so.

McGillis, playing fierce courtroom competitor Capt. Kathryn Murphy, starts out viewing the case of Sarah Tobias's sexual assault by three men in the back of a crowded bar as just another showcase for her negotiation skills. She makes a deal to put Sarah's attackers in jail under a lesser charge rather than taking the case to court, a decision with which Sarah vehemently disagrees but regarding which she is given no choice. When Sarah lands in the hospital-again-after retaliating against one of the men who cheered on her attackers while she was gang-raped, Capt. Murphy begins to see what her deal-making has cost the strong-willed Sarah, and her detachment from the case instantly dissolves. She can't do anything to reverse the results of her earlier negotiation, but she decides that she can prosecute the men from the bar who incited, witnessed and encouraged the rape. It's a case that seems like it can't be won-how can you bring criminal charges against spectators of a crime?

248959,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6301285085,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[0, 0]","The Accused"" is based on an actual true story of a woman who was brutally gang raped by three men. Jodie Foster plays Sara Tobias, who goes to a roadside bar one night after arguing with her boyfriend. Friendly dancing and chitchat leads Sara to be put on top of a jukebox by a man who rapes her. Two other men join in on the rape, while others watch and cheer as if they were at a sporting event. The film is about a woman who hires an attorney to bring her assailants to justice, as well as seeing that those who applauded the rapes are also charged.Jodie Foster became a certifiable actress in ""The Accused"", for she won 1988's Oscar as Best Actress, and also brought rape issues to the forefront of American consciousness. Kelly McGillis, who is a rape survivor in real life, plays the attorney who fights for Sara and others like her.An eye-opening and raw film, ""The Accused"" is not for everyone. The script, direction, and acting are all top-notch, but the subject matter is unsettling. However, this sort of film needed to be made to show others how brutal men can be to their female counterparts.The hardest scene in the film to watch is the gang rape itself: producers wisely showed it toward the end of the film so we could get to know the character of Sara and feel for her attack. Jodie Foster actually blacked out while doing the rape scene, and the men who played the attackers had a hard time performing the graphic and horrifying rapes. Jodie had to calm the actors down and help them through their scenes.""The Accused"" comes with the theatrical trailer and is in widescreen format, but unfortunately there are no other bonuses. It would have been nice if a documentary on the movie would have been included.The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",5,"""The Most Graphic Case of Rape On Film""",1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,1782,"['Accused', 'based', 'actual', 'true', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'gang', 'raped', 'three', 'men', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Sara', 'Tobias', 'who', 'roadside', 'bar', 'one', 'night', 'arguing', 'boyfriend', 'Friendly', 'dancing', 'Sara', 'be', 'put', 'top', 'jukebox', 'man', 'who', 'Two', 'other', 'men', 'join', 'rape', 'others', 'watch', 'cheer', 'were', 'sporting', 'event', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'attorney', 'bring', 'assailants', 'justice', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'who', 'applauded', 'rapes', 'are', 'also', 'charged.Jodie', 'Foster', 'became', 'certifiable', 'actress', 'Accused', 'won', '1988', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'also', 'brought', 'rape', 'issues', 'forefront', 'American', 'consciousness', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'who', 'rape', 'survivor', 'real', 'life', 'attorney', 'who', 'Sara', 'others', 'her.An', 'eye-opening', 'raw', 'film', 'Accused', 'not', 'everyone', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'top-notch', 'subject', 'matter', 'unsettling', 'However', 'sort', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'show', 'others', 'how', 'brutal', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'female', 'counterparts.The', 'hardest', 'scene', 'film', 'watch', 'gang', 'rape', 'producers', 'wisely', 'showed', 'end', 'film', 'could', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'Sara', 'feel', 'attack', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'actually', 'blacked', 'out', 'doing', 'rape', 'scene', 'men', 'who', 'played', 'attackers', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'performing', 'graphic', 'horrifying', 'rapes', 'Jodie', 'had', 'calm', 'actors', 'down', 'help', 'scenes', 'Accused', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'widescreen', 'format', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'other', 'bonuses', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'documentary', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'included.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Vancouver', 'British', 'Columbia', 'Canada']",N/A

Well by today's standards of rape scenes this was pretty tame.It was bad, but I've seen more graphic than this. Jodie Foster plays a prostitute who has a reputation for getting wild, but gets gang-raped by three chauvanistic men in a bar. From the tone of my review, you've probably noticed that I have no compassion or tolerance for rapists. Kelly McGillis plays Jodie's attorney trying to get justice against the rapists and the men who encouraged the rape. The rapists defense attorney makes a complete fool of himself, making lack of evidence the main focus for an aquital. The viewers who judged this movie calling it stupid and poorly acted, didn't watch this in the right frame of mind, I watched it with the intent of hating the rapists, the encouragers, and of course the stupid defense attorney, in that mind framethis movie succeeds brilliantly. Is it an easy movie to watch? No, definitely not. Is it worth watching for more than just Jodie and Kelly's performance? Absolutely! Anyone who thinks this girl deserves to be raped, because of how she was dressed or stoned and drunk, DON""T BOTHER RESPONDING, cause I WILL INGORE YOUR COMMENT! It's worth a look for the acting, storyline and the message, but it's also a good movie for drama fans, so depending on what you can handle this is a very well done film, you may want to rent it first.",4,"By today's standards, this film was rather tame",1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1481,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'least', '2', 'years', 'finally', 'decided', 'judge', 'movie', 'how', 'graphic', 'was', 'Well', 'today', 'standards', 'rape', 'scenes', 'was', 'pretty', 'tame.It', 'was', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'graphic', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'prostitute', 'who', 'reputation', 'getting', 'wild', 'gang-raped', 'three', 'chauvanistic', 'men', 'bar', 'tone', 'review', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'noticed', 'have', 'compassion', 'tolerance', 'rapists', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'Jodie', 'attorney', 'trying', 'get', 'justice', 'rapists', 'men', 'who', 'encouraged', 'rape', 'rapists', 'defense', 'attorney', 'complete', 'fool', 'making', 'lack', 'evidence', 'main', 'focus', 'aquital', 'viewers', 'who', 'judged', 'movie', 'calling', 'stupid', 'poorly', 'acted', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'watched', 'intent', 'hating', 'rapists', 'encouragers', 'course', 'stupid', 'defense', 'attorney', 'mind', 'framethis', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'No', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'just', 'Jodie', 'Kelly', 'performance', 'Absolutely', 'Anyone', 'who', 'girl', 'be', 'raped', 'how', 'was', 'dressed', 'stoned', 'drunk', 'DON', 'T', 'BOTHER', 'RESPONDING', 'cause', 'WILL', 'INGORE', 'YOUR', 'COMMENT', 'look', 'acting', 'storyline', 'message', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'drama', 'fans', 'so', 'depending', 'what', 'can', 'handle', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'first']",N/A

The district attorney on the case is Katheryn Murphy who wants to prove that although Sarah had taken drugs that night and was acting provocatively while in the bar, this is no reason for her to be so brutally attacked and the men responsible should be brought to justice. THE ACCUSED is equal parts gripping and disturbing, and in several key areas. It's a movie about the indignities of victimization, as painfully exemplified in Foster's post-rape medical exam. It's a movie about courage, seen in McGillis' selfless determination to help Foster and in the key witness's stepping forward against a close friend. And it's a movie about how our contemporary legal system cheapens victims all in the name of expediency.
