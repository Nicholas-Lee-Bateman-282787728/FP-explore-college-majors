1274197,A3W4N04XZXPHVQ,B002KBA74Q,Anne E,"[0, 0]","This is such a FUN workout that also provides a great cardio routine! I use this workout on alternating days with Lindsay Brin's toning DVDs. Dance Jam is an upbeat, entertaining and often times challenging workout! I love that it offers different workouts depending on how much time you have or the intensity of workout you want. The Half Time dance is a super fun way to ramp up your workout. As with all of Lindsay's DVDs, she is so much fun to workout with and is always encouraging!",5,Great workout!,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,487,"['such', 'FUN', 'workout', 'also', 'great', 'cardio', 'routine', 'use', 'workout', 'alternating', 'days', 'Lindsay', 'Brin', 'toning', 'DVDs', 'Dance', 'Jam', 'upbeat', 'entertaining', 'often', 'times', 'challenging', 'workout', 'love', 'different', 'workouts', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'intensity', 'workout', 'want', 'Half', 'Time', 'dance', 'super', 'fun', 'way', 'ramp', 'up', 'workout', 'Lindsay', 'DVDs', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'workout', 'always', 'encouraging']",N/A

So I pre-ordered Dance Jam and was pleasantly surprised. I still feel like this DVD was WAY over-priced so I really only give this 3.5 stars, but it was a fun workout for a light day. This workout would be good for beginner to intermediate level.The 42-minute workout is led by Lindsay Brin, a former NFL dancer, and four of her cheerleader friends. There are two other workout options that split the 42 min. workout in half, so that if you're pressed from time you can do a 24 or 34 minute workout. The workout itself has pretty basic dance moves that require a moderate amount of skill, but there is a section to breakdown some of the moves for those who are less coordinated. Lindsay has cute names for the moves, such as ""touchdown"". She does each move slowly before going full-tempo, but not so many times at the slower tempo that your heartrate goes down. Some of the moves only look right when done faster, but most dances are like this.  Her rest move is called ""pop-it"" and it consists of bopping up-and-down in place.  Also, there is a modifier to show low-impact or easier versions of the moves, but there are not a lot of high impact moves. The modifier is not that great and does not show low impact version when she really needs to, such as with the ""booty-drop"" move. One of my complaints, is that I can't really believe that Lindsay did any dance professionally beacuse she doesn't seem that comfortable with moves. It's like she has no finesse while performing. Surprisingly, this does not detract from the workout and the DVD is well-done. Also, there is a little to much bopping in place for me, however you will still get a fairly good workout.So, I like this workout, but it's not one of my absolute favorites. It's fun and has cute moves. Time will only tell whether it will continue to be sufficiently challenging.  I hope in the future Lindsay comes out with more dance videos of a similar nature, but that she builds up her dance confidence before then.",4,"Cute, fun cardio routine!",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2048,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'Lindsay', 'Brin', 'have', 'never', 'tried', 'workouts', 'So', 'pre-ordered', 'Dance', 'Jam', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'still', 'feel', 'DVD', 'was', 'WAY', 'over-priced', 'so', 'really', 'only', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'was', 'fun', 'workout', 'light', 'day', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'level.The', '42-minute', 'workout', 'led', 'Lindsay', 'Brin', 'former', 'NFL', 'dancer', 'four', 'cheerleader', 'friends', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'workout', 'options', 'split', '42', 'min', 'workout', 'half', ""'re"", 'pressed', 'time', 'can', 'do', '24', '34', 'minute', 'workout', 'workout', 'pretty', 'basic', 'dance', 'moves', 'require', 'moderate', 'amount', 'skill', 'section', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'coordinated', 'Lindsay', 'cute', 'names', 'moves', 'such', 'touchdown', 'move', 'slowly', 'going', 'full-tempo', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'slower', 'tempo', 'heartrate', 'down', 'moves', 'only', 'look', 'right', 'when', 'done', 'faster', 'most', 'dances', 'are', 'rest', 'move', 'called', 'pop-it', 'bopping', 'up-and-down', 'place', 'Also', 'modifier', 'show', 'low-impact', 'easier', 'versions', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'modifier', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'show', 'low', 'impact', 'version', 'when', 'really', 'such', 'booty-drop', 'move', 'One', 'complaints', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'Lindsay', 'did', 'dance', 'professionally', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comfortable', 'moves', 'finesse', 'performing', 'Surprisingly', 'not', 'detract', 'workout', 'DVD', 'well-done', 'Also', 'little', 'much', 'bopping', 'place', 'however', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'fairly', 'good', 'workout.So', 'like', 'workout', 'not', 'one', 'absolute', 'fun', 'cute', 'moves', 'Time', 'will', 'only', 'tell', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'sufficiently', 'challenging', 'hope', 'future', 'Lindsay', 'out', 'more', 'dance', 'videos', 'similar', 'nature', 'dance', 'confidence', 'then']",N/A

I was/am not a dancer or cheerleader, but it was still fun and very do-able for me. I was able to follow all of the steps and enjoy myself.I don't use this DVD as my main workout (I love to run for my cardio) but I like to pop it in and do it with my daughters during the day (especially when we've been ""cooped up"" all day).",4,Fun and effective,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,465,"['have', 'Lindsay', 'other', 'DVDs', 'totally', 'love', 'was', 'fence', 'one', 'different', 'others', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'was/am', 'not', 'dancer', 'cheerleader', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'very', 'do-able', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'steps', 'enjoy', 'myself.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'DVD', 'main', 'workout', 'love', 'run', 'cardio', 'like', 'pop', 'do', 'daughters', 'day', 'especially', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cooped', 'up', 'day']",N/A

But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I have been enjoying this workout! Lindsay does a great job teaching the ""moves"" to you and gets your heart rate up really well at the same time. She has helped me over the past 2 1/2 years get into the best shape of my life (after having three kids). She is passionate about what she does and truly wants to help people get in shape. This DVD is getting more enjoyable, the more I do it. The first time around was more learning the moves, but after that, I've really been able to get into it and get a great cardio workout. I am surprised at how fast the times goes! The 40 minutes flies by!",5,Love this,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,733,"['was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'nervous', 'try', 'DVD', 'have', 'never', 'danced', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'workout', 'Lindsay', 'great', 'job', 'teaching', 'moves', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'really', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'helped', 'past', '2', '1/2', 'years', 'get', 'best', 'shape', 'life', 'having', 'three', 'kids', 'passionate', 'what', 'truly', 'help', 'people', 'get', 'shape', 'DVD', 'getting', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'do', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'more', 'learning', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'really', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'get', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'fast', 'times', '40', 'minutes', 'flies']",N/A
