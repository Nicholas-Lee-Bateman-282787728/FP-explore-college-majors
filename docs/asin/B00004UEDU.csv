552458,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00004UEDU,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","I'm sure by the end of this movie the fear of flying class still had even more fear of flying.  In TURBULENCE 2 FEAR OF FLYING, a familiar scenario unfolds; we know that someone on the plane is going to have to fly it and bring it in safely.  This time it falls on the shoulders of Craig Sheffer, who usually plays a bad guy, but this time he's the hero.  Add pretty Jennifer Beals as a claustrophobic, too, and Jeremy Nordling as a despicable bad guy with a phony British accent and you have all the requisites for a hold your breath action movie.Given the genre has been beat to death, there are some suspenseful moments and some over the top plot twists, but it's tidy enough to keep a viewer interested.  Tom Berenger pops in as the flight attendant, and didn't have to worry about any Oscar nominations for this one!",3,NO WAY TO CURE A PHOBIA,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,821,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'end', 'movie', 'fear', 'flying', 'class', 'still', 'had', 'even', 'more', 'fear', 'flying', 'TURBULENCE', '2', 'FEAR', 'FLYING', 'familiar', 'scenario', 'unfolds', 'know', 'someone', 'plane', 'going', 'have', 'fly', 'bring', 'safely', 'time', 'shoulders', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'who', 'usually', 'bad', 'guy', 'time', 'hero', 'Add', 'pretty', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'claustrophobic', 'too', 'Jeremy', 'Nordling', 'despicable', 'bad', 'guy', 'phony', 'British', 'accent', 'have', 'requisites', 'hold', 'breath', 'action', 'genre', 'been', 'beat', 'death', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'top', 'plot', 'twists', 'tidy', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'flight', 'attendant', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'one']",N/A

And yes, it did touch upon current issues (it was a little eerie at times -- seeing a story about a terrorist taking over an airliner). So what may have seemed over-the-top and silly at the time is now more plausable. Well, a little more plausable, anyway.I didn't mind the rather absurd premise of this film. I didn't let myself get bogged down, worrying about this technical improbablility and that technical improbability. After all, what do I know about airliners and all the techno-geeky stuff? Nothing! So, I just figured that it was all relatively plausable, and left it at that. So I do not think I was being nit-picky in the least.I liked most of the characters; they were fine. Likeable. Craig Sheffer made a good hero -- he should play such roles more often. Jennifer Beals is lovely and gave a decent performance. The ""bad guy"" (Jeffrey Nordling) was really good at being evil. Tom Berenger didn't have that exciting of a part (he played the head air traffic controller), but he did very well with what he was given.Half way through the film, I was thinking, ""This really isn't so bad after all. Not great, but typical B-movie stuff."" And then something SO dumb, SO implausable happened, that even I, in my forgiving and easy-going mood, thought, ""NO WAY."" It all kind of fell apart after that for me. The film could never quite recover from such an embarrassingly stupid plot device. And it didn't.The ending was...bad. Not so much because of the ""hero landing the plane"" business (we've seen that a million times before and usually accept it) but just because it never could redeem itself after the embarrassingly stupid plot device. Plus, there were portions of the ending were corny, forced -- I cringed in parts. I found myself saying, ""This is a BAD movie.""Too bad it started to fall apart like that at the end. The rest of the movie was never going to be considered *good*, but it could have avoided being quite so bad had it not taken that fatally stupid turn near the end.",2,Pretty bad...,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,2040,"['first', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'yes', 'did', 'touch', 'current', 'issues', 'was', 'little', 'eerie', 'times', 'seeing', 'story', 'terrorist', 'taking', 'over', 'airliner', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'over-the-top', 'silly', 'time', 'now', 'more', 'plausable', 'Well', 'little', 'more', 'plausable', 'anyway.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'rather', 'absurd', 'premise', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'worrying', 'technical', 'improbablility', 'technical', 'improbability', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'airliners', 'techno-geeky', 'stuff', 'Nothing', 'So', 'just', 'figured', 'was', 'relatively', 'plausable', 'left', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'being', 'nit-picky', 'least.I', 'liked', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'fine', 'Likeable', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'made', 'good', 'hero', 'should', 'play', 'such', 'roles', 'more', 'often', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'lovely', 'gave', 'decent', 'performance', 'bad', 'guy', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'being', 'evil', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'exciting', 'part', 'played', 'head', 'air', 'traffic', 'controller', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'given.Half', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'thinking', 'really', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'Not', 'great', 'typical', 'B-movie', 'stuff', 'then', 'something', 'SO', 'dumb', 'SO', 'implausable', 'happened', 'even', 'forgiving', 'easy-going', 'mood', 'thought', 'WAY', 'kind', 'fell', 'apart', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'quite', 'recover', 'such', 'embarrassingly', 'stupid', 'plot', 'device', ""didn't.The"", 'ending', 'was', 'bad', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'hero', 'landing', 'plane', 'business', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'usually', 'accept', 'just', 'never', 'could', 'redeem', 'embarrassingly', 'stupid', 'plot', 'device', 'were', 'portions', 'ending', 'were', 'corny', 'forced', 'cringed', 'parts', 'found', 'saying', 'BAD', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'started', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'considered', '*good*', 'could', 'have', 'avoided', 'being', 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'fatally', 'stupid', 'turn', 'end']",N/A
