It was the mid 80s and I was a high school junior and happened upon The Broadway Album in a record store, doing research for my high school Jazz Choir. I knew her name...that's all I really knew about her, other than the fact that she was a singer. I took the record home and ""discovered"" that voice...and played it over and over and over...until my family wouldn't let me play it anymore. I remember thinking then that I wished I had discovered her earlier since she obviously would probably retire soon, being around 40 years of age. Well...now I'm almost 40 and it seems there is almost more history of Barbra AFTER that year of discovering her than there was before. Barbra Streisand's voice is as familiar to me as a close friend...and I never, ever get weary of hearing it. It has a timeless quality that transcends genres, eras, or generations. And on this latest recording, she continues to prove to her many fans why she has lasted so long. It's true that her voice isn't what it was when she was 19 years of age. But, that's just range. And if you were a fan of hers simply because she could hit those very high notes...you probably weren't a real fan anyway. She still sings every one of her standards in the same key and still knows how to interpret each one as if every song was a 3-act play with her playing each part with intimate perfection. She is still pitch perfect, still caresses each note and lyric with her delicate vibrato and still knows how to command a stage and performance with the vigor and stamina of a woman more than half her age.

Upon release, ""One Night Only"" clips looked like Barbra talk/singing lullabies to a small group of friends so didn't rush to obtain this event...what a mistake! Finally sat down with newly obtained DVD/CD and ""One Night Only"" is a keeper...opening & off to a great start with soulfully sung ""Here's To Life"", it is clear Barbra & Co. set out to create a sublime musical experience with Barbra in full command of her rich & soulful voice. Between song chat is fun as it usually is with Streisand appearing to ad-lib in her own very entertaining & engrossing way...audience with her all the way and the uniqueness of the natural setting show the star is a star who can adapt to any staging, large or small. The legendary voice so fluid and lush with range far reaching those fine high notes with skill and technique one would expect from this great singing wonder. Would have been wonderful to hear ""Cry Me A River"" & ""Happy Days Are Hear Again"" in small club setting but the richly varied program is a winning one and seemed like a few more would have been just fine.

I don't know if it's because she's been around for 5 decades, her age, or just because she is a LEGEND, but by God, she is still as amazing as if it were the first time she stepped on a stage and took everyone by surprise.  But I guess we shouldn't be surprised, for she has always been an artist who rarely disappoints, if ever.  My jaw literally dropped to the floor when she sang.  Who knew she could be better than her best.  All the movies, all the music, all the concerts, all of everything else she has done has culminated into this one evening.

With each passing year, Barbra Streisand's voice, talent and professionalism gets better.Although some might find both the CD and DVD as a companion piece to her last #1 CD, Love Is The Answer, it not only stands on its own but manages to surpass the fantastic singing that shot that album to number 1 (making her the first recording artist to have a #1 album in five consecutive decades).

While I wasn't in attendance, with this film, I felt like I was in the room with Barbra and her 100 or so guests. You'll experience every expertly mixed sound amidst a wonderfully engaging and stylized capture of the minutes before, during, and after the show. Barbra's voice is as good as its been lately, showing the sublime breath control and sustain at the end of soft notes which conclude many numbers. Seems she could go on and on and on. The band, led by wondrous jazz pianist Tamir Hendelman, offers Barbra magical musical support. She's often witty, engaging in frequent banter and humor, showing little nervousness and great joy with the room's incredible warmth.

1336287,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B003BZXI1O,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[6, 11]","Barbara Streisand is the greatest singer ever, period.  I know she is a perfectionist and that these live albums provide her a chance to record without having to obsess over every detail with many retakes.  And some of her concert albums have been wonderful.  You get to hear the classics and some new material.  But two things happen in this album that just irrated me.  First, she was talking during songs.  I know this was a intimate audience and most people were her friends but having little conversations during the songs is just annoying to the listener.  Second, we know she has impressive and important friends and we know her political views but to introduce people just to say they were there was again annoying and expressing her political views is just unneccesary.

1336289,ACLNARTC3NVJC,B003BZXI1O,"PatrickO ""Patrick""","[89, 94]","Whether it was nostalgia or just a great idea to promote her new record with Diana Krall, Barbra's one night at the Village Vanguard, a 123-seat, 74-year-old jazz club in Greenwich Village, captures an intimate example of her ability to connect with an audience. I live in NYC, but wasn't lucky enough to attend.  However, I got to see Ms. Streisand in 2006 at Madison Square Garden and was front and center as a kid at Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium in March 1976 when she put on a one-day concert event to film for her ""A Star is Born,"" film. In both cases, the audience of thousands just shut up and listened when she sang. In the case of Sun Devil Stadium that included a lot of drugged out teens and adults there to rock out to Peter Frampton and other acts.Here she scales back her famous voice and personality to fit the venue and gives back to her fans a sample of what it was like in the early '60s to have heard her sing in one of the many nightclubs around the US where she got her start.  Along the way, she covers a few of her standards, but more importantly some others that are not so famous, but equally great.  ""Spring is here,"" which she once sang on the Tonight Show is a highlight. Just a beautiful song of hope, love and loss.  She's in great voice here and hits some amazing notes.  If she misses a couple of others, who cares?  She certainly goes for it on several songs like the ""Way We Were.""  That's part of the experience of seeing someone live. I think it's good she didn't clean everything up too much in post-production.  And what makes her so great is her ability to act songs.Along the way, she introduces the rich and famous who attended, along with the lucky contest winners.  This include President Clinton, his wife, our Secretary of State, Nicole Kidman, SJP, Donna Karan, and her husband, James Brolin.  She also introduces or is introduced by, a lot of people who where or are old friends and have stayed with her for almost 50 years.  One of the things that comes across about Ms. Streisand is her incredible loyalty to the people who are loyal to her.  She doesn't say much about it, but she also uses her talent and resources to support multiple charitable causes through her own foundation.  She puts her money where her mouth is.  No matter what you think of her politics, Barbra Streisand tries to make the world a better place.  If we were all as socially conscious, the world would be a much better place.So, if you're just a casual fan thinking this might be a boring paint-by-numbers event that was thrown together to promote her album, you'd make a mistake not to buy it. It's just like being there in the audience.  It was a master-stroke by Ms. Streisand to do this and making things that are old entirely new again. Oh, and she also looks nice.And to the person who said her husband looks bored - sorry, I honestly don't know what you're talking about. An amazing young actor named Ashton (HBO's The Pacific, and A History of Violence) Holmes sits to his right during the performance, by the way.Overall, the evening presents an eclectic mix of people and songs.  The star likely planned it that way and comes up with something her fans will love and even casual fans will really enjoy.  Now, if she will just consider making another movie or two worthy of her great talent ... :)",5,"Out of the ampi-theaters and into the Village Vanguard. Who'da thunk it?

Or, when you get old, your voice/body/health will get worse - everyone has to deal with that, including each one of us. Why can't we take/love her as she is? Is it because we are narrow-minded?""So, Barbra's quality is just different from that of the young Streisand and her current vocal ability is still pretty much enjoyable -- while the voice gets rougher & deeper, the more relaxed she can get (with age), which brings another different sublime quality that the young Streisand couldn't have delivered.So, I'd like to tell all the old & new fans to be kind to a 68-year-old lady who still is so capable of entertaining us.

Green,"[44, 49]","Of course we're all writing in advance of the release of this DVD or DVD/CD combo; but before her single or double CD was released last year, I found, here on AOL, that I was able to view five of the selections from her new album in this venue now being released as a DVD.  It was magic seeing and hearing her; she looked lovely and seemed quite at home in the intimate setting she chose to present her new work.  At that time I anxiously awaited the release of the double CD that is now in my collection.  Today, as I write this, Barbra is celebrating her 68th birthday.  While I'm sure we fans wish her many more, what a body of work she has to look back on from over the last forty-five or more years!  My favorite Barbra has always been her presentation of the standards; the songs she covers on this new DVD don't disappoint.  Very low-key, seldom straining a voice that doesn't quite do what it did when she was nineteen, she can still just send shivers down one's spine...""Some Other Time"" is a good example of her causing this reaction from me.  This gorgeous Leonard Bernstein classic is immediately claimed by Barbra as hers alone.  And what a kick to have her, at least on the CDs, drawing on the talents of Diana Krall as Barbra takes a new direction in her recording.  Diana is a favorite of mine, and I was thrilled, prior to the release of the album, to read the two were working together.  I hope it's not the only time they do this.  Anyhow, my pre-order is in...but just for the DVD, for the CD will simply be near-identical to the album(s) I already own.  I love watching Barbra as she sings.
