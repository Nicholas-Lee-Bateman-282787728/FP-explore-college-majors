910819,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B0009PW4D2,Ace-of-Stars,"[13, 18]","*Thanks, everybody! Due in large part to your reviews I have decided to heed your warnings and skip past this ""turkey""! Because of your ""common consensus,"" as it were, ""curiousity"" will by no means kill THIS particular ""cat""!Yes, I felt the very powerful urge to experience this version of ""WotW,"" especially after (1)- hearing repeatedly how amazingly ""faithful"" this version was to Mr. Wells' original vision and (2)- having been SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED (to 'gag-reflex' levels) by Steven Spielberg's drippy-syrupy, happy-sappy, and completely illogical abomination of the same source material (replete with the otherwise lovely & talented Dakota Fanning's irritating ""Screaming Mimi"" performance).So despite all of the ""warnings"" about the ""bad acting,"" the ""bad editing,"" the ""bad cinematography,"" and the ""bad special effects,"" I still played around with the idea that its faithfulness to the original story would more than make up for all of this film's many production faults -- or that I could at least overlook such faults, as I often am capable of doing when presented with an entriguing-enough story to involve myself in (""Sleepaway Camp,"" anyone?). But the more I read of your reviews, the more doubts I began to have, until it led me to do the ONE thing I had yet to do -- VIEW THE TRAILERS! Therefore allow me, please, to repeat EVERYTHING which has repeatedly been expressed throughout these reviews based solely on my observation of the three ""theatrical"" trailers I viewed of this movie:* less-than-impressive cinematography* stale/wooden (read: ""awful"") acting* uninspiring & amateurish special effects* incompetent editingThat this is the closest ""by the book"" film adaptation we have of the original story seems, to me, to be this film's only major (if not exclusive) selling point.I have this uncanny ability to ""look beyond"" poorly produced/directed/acted films in favor of a ""good story"" (or, at least, a ""decent"" one), but I simply CANNOT bear to sit through such a high concentration  of these cinematic deficits all pressed neatly together into one complete package! If only a series of motion picture promotional ""trailers"" can cause me to utterly reject ANY AND EVERY interest in a film project I may have initially had & held onto quite so effectively, then I can only consider myself SPARED of even greater disappointment from something that was surely to be a much more horrendous experience 3-hours in length! From all that I have observed and read, I do not even believe (as many of you seem to do) that a ""larger budget"" would have made one bean of difference!Thank you, my friends, from the very bottom of my heart! Thank you for your help in saving me from a fate not exactly ""worse-than-death"" but pretty damn close!= = = = = =",1,Agree with the consensus --,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2762,"['*Thanks', 'everybody', 'Due', 'large', 'part', 'reviews', 'have', 'decided', 'heed', 'warnings', 'skip', 'past', 'turkey', 'common', 'consensus', 'were', 'curiousity', 'will', 'means', 'kill', 'THIS', 'particular', 'cat', 'Yes', 'felt', 'very', 'powerful', 'urge', 'experience', 'version', 'WotW', 'especially', '1', 'hearing', 'repeatedly', 'how', 'amazingly', 'faithful', 'version', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Wells', 'original', 'vision', '2', 'having', 'been', 'SEVERELY', 'DISAPPOINTED', ""'gag-reflex"", 'levels', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'drippy-syrupy', 'happy-sappy', 'completely', 'illogical', 'abomination', 'same', 'source', 'material', 'replete', 'otherwise', 'lovely', 'talented', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'irritating', 'Screaming', 'Mimi', 'performance', 'warnings', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'editing', 'bad', 'cinematography', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'played', 'idea', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'many', 'production', 'faults', 'could', 'least', 'overlook', 'such', 'faults', 'often', 'am', 'capable', 'doing', 'when', 'presented', 'entriguing-enough', 'story', 'involve', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'anyone', 'more', 'read', 'reviews', 'more', 'doubts', 'began', 'have', 'led', 'do', 'ONE', 'thing', 'had', 'yet', 'do', 'VIEW', 'TRAILERS', 'Therefore', 'please', 'repeat', 'EVERYTHING', 'repeatedly', 'been', 'expressed', 'reviews', 'based', 'solely', 'observation', 'three', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'viewed', 'movie', '*', 'less-than-impressive', 'cinematography*', 'stale/wooden', 'read', 'awful', 'uninspiring', 'amateurish', 'special', 'effects*', 'incompetent', 'closest', 'book', 'film', 'adaptation', 'have', 'original', 'story', 'be', 'film', 'only', 'major', 'not', 'exclusive', 'selling', 'point.I', 'have', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'look', 'poorly', 'produced/directed/acted', 'films', 'favor', 'good', 'story', 'least', 'decent', 'one', 'simply', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'bear', 'sit', 'high', 'concentration', 'cinematic', 'deficits', 'pressed', 'neatly', 'together', 'one', 'complete', 'package', 'only', 'series', 'motion', 'picture', 'promotional', 'trailers', 'can', 'cause', 'utterly', 'reject', 'ANY', 'EVERY', 'interest', 'film', 'project', 'may', 'have', 'initially', 'had', 'held', 'quite', 'so', 'effectively', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'consider', 'SPARED', 'even', 'greater', 'disappointment', 'something', 'was', 'surely', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'horrendous', 'experience', '3-hours', 'length', 'have', 'observed', 'read', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'believe', 'many', 'seem', 'do', 'larger', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'bean', 'difference', 'Thank', 'friends', 'very', 'bottom', 'heart', 'Thank', 'help', 'saving', 'fate', 'not', 'exactly', 'worse-than-death', 'pretty', 'damn', 'close', '=', '=', '=', '=', '=', '=']",H.G.

Some dolt chose to cram 3 h of movie on a DVD and I'll bet it's a single layer DVD. As a result, the video quality is awful...very jerky. Worst I've ever seen on any commercial DVD.

The ""special"" effects wouldn't have looked out of place in Tron, and even then they would have looked dated. I remember seeing the trailer and gasping in horror as a really bad looking CGI Big Ben was blown up. I comforted myself thinking that it was probably just raw FX footage. It wasn't, Timbo actually included it in the film. And the editing is breathtakingly poor, I don't think it was edited at all, throughout the film we are treated to the lead walking. Thats right, whenever he needs to go somewhere we see the whole journey, this film is basically Anthony Piana walking from A to B.Finally, don't be suckered by the 5 star reviews, chances are they were written by a T Hines, no, thats too obvious, lets call him Timothy H.

910829,A3W2RZQCMJQNRB,B0009PW4D2,Billbo,"[21, 24]","Before I say what I thought about this movie, I would like to say that I have been looking forward to this particular version of The War of the Worlds ever since I heard about it last year.  I was very excited to hear that a movie that would closely follow H.G. Wells' book was being made.It is with some pain that I have to say what I thought about the movie: I thought it was bad, folks, really bad. The whole movie looked like it was thrown together at the last minute. The acting was somewhat better than what I have seen in most porn movies, but that is about as much praise as I could give it. (I found it particularly difficult to not laugh during a scene at the beginning of the movie that takes place in an observatory with 'Ogilvy'.)  The special effects were particularly bad; the vast majority of them looked like 'pre-visualizations', and were very crude. (I am very sorry to say it, but I thought the 'Thunder Child' scene looked particularly pathetic.) I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that most video games have better effects.  One of the most amateurish things about this film was that many of the 'night' scenes were filmed in broad daylight, and little to no attempt was made to make these scenes look like they were filmed at night.  Nearly all of this ineptitude pales in comparison to the extremely sloppy editing of the film, where characters seem to move from city streets to country lanes faster than the speed of light, and some scenes look like they were randomly thrown in,and seem to have no purpose whatsoever.I am rather incredulous that the site promoting this movie is claiming that it will be in 'select theaters' this month.  Frankly, if I were a theater owner, I would need to see no more than the first twenty minutes of this film before deciding not to touch it with a ten foot pole. I have read other reviews that are comparing this film with 'Ed Wood' type films. If anything, these comments are an insult to Ed Wood. I truly cannot imagine any theater showing this film unless the film's producers were hiring them to do so.The only parts of this movie that had any hints of quality to me were the scenes with the narrator and the curate at the abandoned house, and some of the scenes that followed.

910833,A26MIHZNZXUQZT,B0009PW4D2,Brad Frank,"[542, 583]","Pendragon Pictures' new film ""H G Wells' War of the Worlds"", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (March, 2005) but this never happened. The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of Spielberg's film, which hits theatres June 29.I liked this film, with certain reservations.How faithful is the adaptation? It's not quite 100% faithful to Wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. But on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal.Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. The majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game. Numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for ""real"" seem to be those in open fields or forests.But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.The acting and direction won't win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers.I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would rate this similarly to a BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature.A few nitpicks:  Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD. And the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing?If you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original H G Wells novel. And for only 10 bucks, you shouldn't feel cheated. If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a MST3K fan). Be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.BTW: An entirely different version of War of the Worlds, aka ""INVASION"", is due on DVD June 28. This was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the Spielberg film.

This was a project I had been following with great interest. The very idea that somebody sought to faithfully recreate the H.G. Wells novel in movie form intrigued me, I suppose, because nobody had ever previously attempted it. While I do honestly appreciate the ambition Timothy Hines might very well have possessed when he conceived this film, I cannot help but conclude that he fell far short of delivering the shining result he so foolishly promised.This was not, by any stretch, a professional or theater-worthy production. For Mr. Hines to proclaim to the world that it was is clearly nothing short of a misrepresentation. He should therefore show no surprise when people across the board are slamming the film he told everyone would blow their socks off. I pretty much knew beforehand that Pendragon's budget for this was very minimal. Mr. Hines, I truly believe, knew that as well. But he still went ahead and rushed the movie out onto DVD with unfinished special effects that do nothing more than make you wish the movie was a lot less shorter than the three agonizing hours that it currently is. Now, were Hines the type of man to state upfront that he did not possess the funds he previously boasted....fan reaction would probably have been far more forgiving. But, he was not upfront about anything. He lied, and that is not something any aspiring filmmaker should ever do.I really did, for all intents and purposes, enjoy the film's first hour. The martian and heat ray intros were particular standouts. But, from there on, everything took a complete and total nosedive. I have seen many movies with budgets lower than this, and there was not one of them that could not easily afford exterior filming. Why Mr. Hines chose to abuse CGI in such a gross manner throughout this production staggers my line of rational thinking. The sepia toning and differing color schemes I could handle, but not the constant and obviously artificial computer generated backgrounds.Perhaps, had Hines taken the time to polish up the scattershot effects and trim down the running time, we would have been treated to something slightly better. Unfortunately, that is not what happened.I had already planned on catching Steven Spielberg's film. And now, having seen this tragic case of squandered potential, I am even more hyped.

Griffins or Charlie Chapman, Heinz deftly transports us back to a time and place that we can only imagine in our inferior minds - Pennsylvania, 1898, where a cast of thousands in their Civil War-era finery are subjected to a terrifying invasion of gigantic mechadroidal spider monsters that lay waste to much of Pittsburgh, including Big Ben!! Sweet Christ on a feathery cloud this movie is fantastic! And the acting, well, don't get me started or Amazon might be forced remove my privileges for unauthorized use of praise! (Ha Ha.  Ha.). Suffice it to say that Tony Piano is ideal as the Main Character, ably switching from a sort of lethargic trance-like condition (totally in keeping with the scepticism of his character) to super heroics that would make John-Claud Vandam hang up his numb-chucks within a single sequence! Truly an acting legend has been born in this film. Mark my words, we'll be hearing a lot more from Mr. Piano down the road. And let us not forget the lovely Jamie Lynn Cease as the ravishing Miss Elfinsteen. What I wouldn't give to put a tap on that and sell it to the world, if you know what I mean. Wait a minute, what DO you think I mean. How DARE you, you heathen sinners.I've read that TIMOTHY WELLES' WARS OF THE WORLDS cost OVER $175,000 TO MAKE! That's a lot of money, and I can assure you, every penny of it is up on the screen. The special effects in this film, despite the obviously planted naysayers here on Amazon, are some of the finest work I've seen since TV's Harry Thomason graced us with THE DAY IT CAME TO EARTH way, waaay back in 1979 (why I can remember seeing that one at the Starlight Drive In out on the one-oh-five). Hasn't been a decent special-effects driven film since then, I say. In fact, not since THE PASSIONS OF MR. JESUS or LEFT BEHIND II: TRIBULATION FORCE has a movie left me so emotionally drained yet charged with a renewed enthusiasm to confront this hellish liberal cesspool that plagues these end of times! Praise Timmy Heinz! Praise!This is truly a film for our troubled times, based on a book for our troubled times, except it was for our troubled times back then, and they were less troubled back then than they are now, let me tell you! There's a potent subtext at work in Heinz's film that reminds me of the one posited by the Great Prophet Hal Lindsay in THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH in 1977: that mankind should be forever vigilant that its fiery destruction is just around the corner. Be it at the hands of our loving Lord and Saviour, or vast armies of teeming, towering metallic Venusian killbots, both of which can pulverize us into steak seasoning with just one blast from their laser-precision eye-blasters, it WILL happen. Are YOU ready for it?. And, not coincidentally I'm sure, both films share a distinct set of production values. Coincidence? I think not. Verily, great minds direct alike!In closing, I'd heartily recommend ORSON HEINZ'S BATTLES OF THE PLANETS for the entire family, and even for those not so fortunately blessed, including heathen single mothers and promiscuous single people. Unlike today's cartoons with their ""hip"" humour, their doe-eyed panty-flashing Japanese wiccan-harlots, and their cynical disregard for conservative family values, there's absolutely nothing in H.G. HEINZ'S WORLDS AT THE WAR that wouldn't find solace within the deveoping mind of a five-year-old.So get thee to your local Wal-Mart, pronto! I've no doubt supplies of this newly-priced-reduced masterpiece are limited, if the praise afforded it here on Amazon is any indication. Why, I was so impressed with the packaging ALONE that I humbly returned a fresh box of Remington .22 Thunderbolts AND a copy of Mel Gibson's Passion of Mr. Jesus Sticker Book to their respective shelves so I could purchase another copy for my in-laws, who are coming over to the trailer this weekend.Take it from me, a 20-years-married mother of three, they just don't make them like this anymore!Take Care and May Ramtha Go With You,Betty(in no way affiliated with Pendragon Pictures, Timothy Orson or the estate of H.G. Welles)",1,Praise Timmy Heinz!

Note ""the DVD"" rather than ""my DVD"" as it won't be kept long.  On the disk itself is the phrase ""Guaranteed Superior Quality.""  Not so.  Perfect fodder for the late Mystery Science Theater 3000.The CGI is at best early to mid 1980s.  See the execrable Thunderchild sequence and the Martian exsanguination of a rather crudely constructed cow (mooing sounds were added apparently so you'd know what you're looking at.)  Rather don't see them.Thespians: everyone gets to have at least one reaction shot per event, perhaps more.  'Horror' is shown by squinting and showing one's teeth.  IMDb tells me few of the actors have appeared in other films.  Those who have inhabited characters named 'bikini girl' and 'sweater girl.'  Whatever talents they had in those roles did not transfer to this film.  The scenery-chewing actor playing the curate will soon be seen in ""Creatures from the Pink Lagoon.""  The artilleryman's role, important in the book,  is a complete waste.Filmic style: daytime is orange, night is pale blue - except when they don't use the filters.

The effects were CGI but look like they used an old Atari computer to generate them. A shoe string budget makes this look like an animatronics version electronic storyboard to present an idea to the money holders, not a final version for the public. I do wish that just once someone would remake this tale true to the original setting and intent of H.G.Wells set in late 1890's England. The original story was powerful and would lend itself well to cinema. Unfortunately, both the George Pal 1953 version and the more recent Stephen Spielberg versions update the story to contemporary settings. The original story would be very good to see, but not like it was presented in this terrible production.",1,Cheapo production ruins a great tale,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,810,"['Terrible', 'version', 'wonderful', 'classic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'loved', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'effects', 'were', 'CGI', 'look', 'used', 'old', 'Atari', 'computer', 'generate', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget', 'look', 'animatronics', 'version', 'electronic', 'storyboard', 'present', 'idea', 'money', 'holders', 'not', 'final', 'version', 'public', 'do', 'wish', 'just', 'once', 'someone', 'would', 'remake', 'tale', 'true', 'original', 'setting', 'intent', 'H.G.Wells', 'set', 'late', '1890', 'England', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'powerful', 'would', 'lend', 'well', 'cinema', 'Unfortunately', 'George', 'Pal', '1953', 'version', 'more', 'recent', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'versions', 'update', 'story', 'contemporary', 'settings', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'see', 'not', 'was', 'presented', 'terrible', 'production']",H.G.

910846,AXK7EFY9EPRI4,B0009PW4D2,"David Jerrard ""Gadgetus Collectivus""","[10, 13]","First things first.  This is an actual honest review from a real person who has actually reviewed other movies.  Thus, you'll find potential spoilers in this review, but above all, some actual information about why I liked or disliked this movie, frequently in detail, as opposed to the plethora of fake reviews here.  Some of these fake reviews even go so far as to claim the negative ones the fake ones.  If this is so, then why is it that this relatively little known movie has managed to collect over 500 reviews in the short time it's been out (with over 350 positive reviews by people that have never posted reviews of anything else), while the famous (read: well known) George Pal classic version that's been out for years has only received 150 reviews in total?  More on that later.Where to start? I guess I could go for the good points...They managed to point the camera at the actors without it wandering all over like all these ""trendy"" directors like to do so often these days to cover up the fact that they don't know what they're doing. The camera work here managed to frame things without detracting from the scenes for a fair amount of the movie. A few jolts appear here & there when something blows up, which wasn't done all that well (probably added in post - if you can call it that), but overall the camera work is about about the least offensive thing here.Similarly, the lighting isn't bad. It could be much better though, like all those day-for-night shots that are so obviously shot during the day.  This appears to have been filmed mostly outdoors, or against blue/green screen, and then tweaked in post. They were apparently going after an old, sepia toned look for this and they came close once in a while.  The other colors they used are another story.That's it for the good points.This movie was abviously done for next to nothing. It's evident from the use of obvious non-actors throughout, who seem confused about where to look, what's supposed to be happening around them, or even what they should be doing. In what should be intense scenes, like when the martians first attack, a crowd of people just stand around, obviously waiting for someone to tell them to run, and they look like they're waiting for this command, rather than reacting to this big event that's supposed to be going on in front of them. Even as they're being fired upon, they just stand around and half-heartedly writhe in horribly fake agony, as poorly composited fire is ""burning"" them alive. Oh, and that fire is drastically out of scale as well. Most of the people have a dazed & confused look on their face all the time, probably the exact same expression viewers have while watching this.The martian war machines are designed half decently, but that's about all. They're animated so poorly you have no idea what they're supposedly trying to do. Their actions hae no apparent purpose other than to move randomly.  The interaction with live and CG environments is also so bad, this thing should be taking a top spot on the gallery abominate site. For example, a tripod walks into a farmhouse, and the leading arms/tentacles, etc. actually pass, very obviously, through the walls for a second before the house is animated to collapse - something that's inexcusable in 3D animation.The martians themselves look like piles of goo (to be polite) with wormlike tentacles and huge eyes that are also poorly done. The appear to have been rendered at a very low resolution and then scaled up to fit the backgrounds since they are always blurry. They could really do with some higher quality texturing and some lighting by someone that has some skill. In fact, all the lighting for the 3D elements was abysmal. The original Doom game was done far better.Compositing (combining 3D, CGI, effects into live action sequences) was horrible. No attempts seem to have been made to match motion with background anywhere. Shadows are not added to try to place the effects into the scenes, and in fact, almost every scene with any effects whatsoever has been processed so badly that all sense of depth has been removed. The original pit that the first pod is found in is a perfect example. It's only seen from the side, and no attempt is made to define how large it is, except through the inexperienced reactions of the ""actors"" mulling around. Someone falls in, and the only way to see where the edge of the pit actually is is by watching for when this poor guy climbs out of it a couple times. Even then, it looks like he's just been added to a scene of piles of sand.An extremely pathetic compositing attempt is made just before the main character gets on a paddleboat.  I had to play this scene a few times to actually figure out what I was looking at.  It's a three part comp, and none of the elements match the others.  The foreground is the main character standing on a hill, looking down into a field.  At the other end of the field, clearly about half a mile distance, is a line of trees.  The next element is placed above those trees, and is supposed to appear behind them.  However, that element is of a paddleboat, from a point of view looking UP!  And this is towering above the trees.  The person standing on this boat, which is comped in beyond the trees, now appears to be well over 100 feet tall, dwarfing the trees in front of him.  Finally, the third element, the lake, is added behind all this, and this lake element is viewed from an agle of about 45 degrees, DOWN.  So we have a field that is on a gentle incline, going down toward the giant paddleboat that towares above the trees, that looks like it's beached itself so the front is way higher than the back, and behind that we have a lake that appears to be going uphill on a steep incline, and drifts out of sync with the rest of the frame when the camera moves.The worst is during a scene on a paddleboat as a battleship, the Thunderchild, (which looks like it was modeled using a bathtub toy for reference) races by, unrealistically fast, as martian machines are, um, I don't know what they were doing exactly - looking menacing? Anyway, these were composited so badly I actually thought this section was filmed and accidentally exposed twice. And the shots of the paddleboat looked more like they took a photo of house and swapped the landscape around it with water, without any regard for the drastically different perspectives.The same with the battleship as it went by. Its angle was from a such a higher vantage point than the background it was placed into that near the end of the shot, this thing was obviously about to take flight (another few frames and it would literally be above the horizon). Then there's the shots of both boats actually travelling sideways (the Thunderchild actuall appears to turn and skid in one), with absolutely no interaction with the water.Finally, most of the scenes in this thing have a very distracting jumpiness to them. Every fifth frame is dropped and replaced with a copy of the fourth frame. This makes it look like you're watching a bad MPG or AVI on a computer that can't play video very well. It makes any scenes with a lot of movement very hard to watch, especially scenes where the camera pans.This thing is BAD. I bought it due to a few ""glowing"" reviews here, and after seeing some of it, I just had to check a few more to make sure I wasn't remembering things wrong. Several reviewers actually nailed it... Tim Hines or his cronies are obviously shilling this piece of trash with several fake reviews. I tested his theory and it appears solid. Just click the ""See all my reviews"" link beside any of the positive reviews and you see that in virtually every case, that is the only review that person has written. Now, what are the chances of a hundred-plus people all coming together to give glowing reviews about this little-known bad movie, and not writing any reviews for anything else?Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Find a positive review and check the link for all the other reviews. Now, check the reviews that are less than positive. In most cases, those reviewers will have posted other reviews for other films. Now, check another movie - one that's better known, and do this same test. Chances are that all those reviewers (positive or negative) will have more than just one review to their credit. This is a test I will definitely be doing myself from now on.Going over all the pages of reviews I can't help but notice pattern - one that others have also noticed. After a few real reviews of the movie (virtually all negative) from people - most using real names with other reviews to their credits, a block of 4-5 star positive review turns up, just enough to push the real reviews off the first page. Virtually none of these rave reviews are by people that are using real names, or have even reviewed another movie anywhere on the site (and this is easily checked as I mentioned previously - click the ""read all my reviews"" link beside the names). Sure enough, shortly after  a couple bad reviews were posted, what did I see? Three positives, all by people that aren't using the Real Name system, and who have never reviewed anything else on the site.Another real review followed, again, very negative, by someone that's got other reviews to his credit. And the pattern repeats, with SIX glowing reviews, and only one of those used the real name system. That one reviewer is the only one of the bunch that has even reviewed anything else. Amazon should really prevent people from placing reviews without using the Real Name system, since the current method, as evidenced by the sheer number of obvious fake reviews here, is being abused by the shills to trick people into paying money for a product that is simply garbage.This not only hurts customers who buy this under the artificial impression that the product is good, since they see only the latest batch of fake reviews on the first page, but it's also a detriment to Amazon itself, since this is essentially false advertising. The reviews placed on Amazon are testimonials, and testimonials are advertising, whether paid for or not. Amazon should at least take steps to ensure these testimonials are honest ones - not faked just to hide the honest ones.I paid money for this piece of trash. Money I would NOT HAVE PAID had I seen some of the real reviews that were pushed off the first page when I placed the order. In essense, because of false claims on the pages of Amazon, I bought a product that was far inferior to the claims I read about it. I was lied to about the quality of this DVD, and it wasn't untl it arrived a few days later and I was able to play it that I realized those reviews were completely false.I returned to Amazon to re-check those reviews that made it seem like this was such a great film, and was lucky enough to catch the latest offering of real reviews, all stating in detail how pathetic this thing was. Another hour later, those reviews were pushed to the second page as another packet of fake ones was posted.  Another batch of shallow, ""this movie is great"" with no real reasons given, by first-time reviewers, who have put about as much effort into their ""reviews"" as went into this crappy movie.  Even someof their personal information is lame, like the one from Ontario, Canada, USA...  Um, newsflash...  Canada is NOT a state in the US. And Ontario is a province of Canada (as well as a county in California).  At least try to claim a location that actually exists!These spammers (since this is basically what they are) know that the majority of people will only bother to read the reviews that are on the first page, so if they can arrange to have at least three of those four to be positive, then they're likely to make another sale. So they write them themselves, and post a few at a time, under various names, and shortly, the real reviews are pushed down the list. This is also easy to check since there are four or so reviews, all supposedly be different people, that are exact, word for word copies!An easy solution to this problem would be to just prevent/remove the reviews that fall into this pattern (rather than delete all the reviews, as was done in the past for this) - reviews from people not using the Real Name system and that have not reviewed anything else. Unfortunately, this does smack of censorship.Or, a review can be kept out of the public eye until that reviewer has written other reviews (of more substance than merely saying it's a great movie), which would indicate that this person is an honest reviewer.  After all, these reviews have to be approved by someone, somewhere, before they actually appear.Another option is to give customers an option on the website to filter out these types of reviews, and make that the default. A review by someone that's done other reviews is going to carry a bit more weight than one by someone that has never reviewed anything else and only gives a couple lines of text to the effect, ""It rocks.""This filter can be added to a tool that's already in place, but found only on the second and later review pages - the drop-down list, where we're curently able to sort reviews by Newest First, Oldest First, Highest Rated, Lowest Rated, most & least helpful and by star rating.Obviously, I'm extremely offended by being tricked into paying money for this thing. I have a right to be. I was lied to by the pages on Amazon. I haven't seen anything else on DVD, or any other medium (that I can remember) that was done so poorly, and I've seen some really bad stuff (Caress of the Vampire 2 and Troll 2 for example). There is no excuse for the horrible frame dropping effect that's all through this thing, or the lamest CG effects I've ever seen in a movie, or the poor acting which falls short of that of a play put on by grade school children. In my view, something this bad can only be made as part of an intentional scam to rip people off (Matrix quality effects?!?!), and these fake reviews only support this opinion. After all, the people behind this mess are obviously aware that what they made is something that anyone older than a two-year old with senses would be ashamed to sell to anyone, yet they're constantly trying to hide the truth from the public to suck more money out of them.Or, Amazon could just refer people to the reviews on the internet movie database, which seems to be a little more strict about the content of the reviews.  Read those, and you'll see a big swing in the general consensus on this thing.I am so tempted to report this thing to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, but so far, the only unsafe thing about this DVD is the small possibility of being hit by one when someone throws it away in disgust and anger. Or the possibility of my heart stopping out of sheer boredom if I were to ever be able to sit through all three hours of this turd non-stop.This thing is bad. Very bad. I was shocked to see that they mentioned in their trailer that it was coming to theaters in 2005! I guess that was the plan up until someone actually saw it. Timbo or someone must have figured out that if this was put into a theater, people would walk out in droves, demanding their mony back, and the movie would have been pulled very quickly, and most likely in a very public way.  This was probably the smartest move these idiots have made, but I suspect it wasn't due to intelligence, but rather because it was too expensive.It takes a real ass to spam a review system to try to trick more people into buying this thing, and a turd this big could only have been passed by a rather huge one.He Who Is Tempted To Make A Website To Flame This Movie Properly.",1,This doesn't even

This version is set at the beginning of the 20th century and follows the Wells novel literally. But the result is so sloppy and self-indulgent, and the special effects so poorly executed, that all sense of horror and excitement are lost.Perhaps this film was made by high-school students working in a garage. Clearly they had no real sets or actors. The special effects are a jumble of techniques, with the martian machines (the tripods, the spiders, and the death ray) reasonably well done but most of the rest just horrible. The scenes of destruction of London and other towns make the burning of Tokyo in the original Godzilla movie look good.

I have read the message boards on IMDB and yes, the acting is sub par at best.  The story is faithful to the book about 90% of the time and the CGI is, at best, like that of a first year art student.  Was that supposed to be a cow? The alian tripods are a great rendering.  Concerning teh CGI, we are so spoiled by state of the art effects that when something doesn't meet or exceed our expectations we become critical.  This might have been due to budgetary restraints.When it comes to the ""style"" the film was made (cinematography), to me, that was ingenious.  It was almost like seeing some of the old tinted Victorian stereo-opticon(?)cards and ""magic lanterns"" of the same time period come alive. The tintings used were in stark contrast to say the normal color of whatever it would be in nature. (ex. red bush (bright reds), cool blues, sickly greens. We all forget that ""Technicolor"", either two (2) strip or three (3)strip was not true color. That's what made them so colorful and phony looking.  Watch Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" for one of the last and greatest uses of the three (3)strip process. Very surreal!The jerky picture style in some areas reflects that of the early silent movies from the time.  Anyone here ever heard of George Melies?  His early films were similar to the style used.Getting to the movie (acting, etc).  Yes the acting IS 3rd rate at best but watchable for one viewing - especially the priest -- very ""Plan 9"".  Most reactions are far too broad. The story itself, as I said, does go by the book almost all the time.Maybe more money, a real studio backing it and better direction could have improved on the movie.  I saw all the negatives about Mr. Hines (aka ""Timbo"") on the IMDB along with these on Amazon and, well, 'nuf said.  Never met the guy but he had a good idea. It's too bad the studios could not back his vision and given us a better product.With the near release of the Spielberg version of ""War of the Worlds"" I thought I would take a chance, bought it and really do not regret it.  If asked would I sit through another viewing, well, if I will-I will, but I'm in no hurry.  I will in the future. Beautiful visuals, throughout!!

910849,A178M2RQGZBU9L,B0009PW4D2,Dean,"[13, 13]","I must say after viewing Timothy Hine's War of the Worlds that I am very disappointed. While the film is undoubtedly a labor of love, it looks like a labor of love done on a circa 1998 Macintosh in someones basement. I was frankly expecting a much more big-budget look to this film based on some of the hype prior to its release. Instead, we are treated to very cheesy and often gratuitous special effects that often seem to bear no relation to reality, and actually pale to special effects done in films of the 50's. The level of realism is computer-gamish at best, with fires that have no smoke and don't seem to burn anything, people burned to skeletons that writhe about after they are dead, (not to mention have a sheen to them), and cannons that emit no smoke when fired, and are also missing the teams of horses that would pull them. Indeed the historical and continuity errors in this film could fill a fair sized book, I expect...its obvious that technical advice was sorely lacking. While I was expecting something of a stylized look to the film, it is so inconsistent as to be downright confusing at times. The strange filtering and tinting in some scenes seems to be an intentional artifice, but the atrocious color-matching in other scenes seems to completely obviate the effort. While the Martians and their machines have an interesting look, the quality of the animation is jerky and poor, once again much like a circa-1998 computer game. England in 1898 seems strangly empty, with featureless CG streets and buildings, groups of houses that seem to be adjacent to wilderness areas, and battleships with no crew. The sequence where the Thunder Child warship battles the martians is terribly bungled, the animated ships are comical, traveling without wakes at impossible velocities, firing guns with no one manning them...all in all, quite embarrassing. Much of the footage of the actors is confined to them reacting to off-camera action while placed against a CG background...even some of the interiors seem to be matted in...is it really so hard to film simple interiors? As I think someone else here pointed out, many of the scenes with CG effects end up looking like outtakes or mockups for the real shot...but they are the real shot...The night scenes all seem to be shot during the day with a blue filter...I thought this went out with low budget films in the 60's? And you may need to get the motion sickness pills out during any scene where the camera pans...it pans in steps so jerky my girlfriend was getting dizzy watching it...Then there is the terrible editing...we are treated to about an hour of extraneous footage of people running through grasslands, down empty roads, and through the same groups of trees for no clear reason, except to impress upon us in a very heavy handed way that this was before the age of the car and if you wanted to get somewhere you had to walk (or run, judging by the amount of jogging around in this film, apparently everyone in Victorian England was a marathon class runner, even women in long dresses and high heeled boots). Indeed the film gets off to a very slow start indeed, with a huge amount of time devoted to Ogilvie climbing in and out of the Martian cylinder's pit over and over again...what is the purpose of this? There are serious issues with the sound mix as well, I found it difficult to understand much of the dialogue, as it is mixed so low in comparison to the music...during the narrated parts I was looking for subtitles, but found none. Admittedly, the film adheres quite closely to the book, and takes most of its dialogue verbatim, but the internal conversations that happen within a written story don't always make for compelling on-screen speech, and the turn-of-the-century prose sounds rather stilted at times. While most of the actors are at least competent, its pretty obvious that some of them are &lt;ahem> friends or relatives of someone. I suppose I should stop criticizing this film, I know the guy put alot of effort into it, but it's obvious he bit off much more than he could chew. &lt;sigh>",2,A flawed effort to bring a classic to film.,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,4089,"['must', 'say', 'viewing', 'Timothy', 'Hine', 'War', 'Worlds', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'labor', 'love', 'labor', 'love', 'done', 'circa', '1998', 'Macintosh', 'someones', 'basement', 'was', 'frankly', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'big-budget', 'look', 'film', 'based', 'hype', 'prior', 'release', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'cheesy', 'often', 'gratuitous', 'special', 'effects', 'often', 'seem', 'bear', 'relation', 'reality', 'actually', 'pale', 'special', 'effects', 'done', 'films', '50', 'level', 'realism', 'computer-gamish', 'best', 'fires', 'have', 'smoke', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'burn', 'anything', 'people', 'burned', 'skeletons', 'writhe', 'are', 'dead', 'not', 'mention', 'have', 'sheen', 'cannons', 'emit', 'smoke', 'when', 'fired', 'are', 'also', 'missing', 'teams', 'horses', 'would', 'pull', 'Indeed', 'historical', 'continuity', 'errors', 'film', 'could', 'fill', 'fair', 'sized', 'book', 'expect', 'obvious', 'technical', 'advice', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'stylized', 'look', 'film', 'so', 'inconsistent', 'be', 'downright', 'confusing', 'times', 'strange', 'filtering', 'tinting', 'scenes', 'be', 'intentional', 'artifice', 'atrocious', 'color-matching', 'other', 'scenes', 'completely', 'obviate', 'effort', 'Martians', 'machines', 'have', 'interesting', 'look', 'quality', 'animation', 'jerky', 'poor', 'once', 'again', 'much', 'circa-1998', 'computer', 'game', 'England', '1898', 'strangly', 'empty', 'featureless', 'CG', 'streets', 'buildings', 'groups', 'houses', 'seem', 'be', 'adjacent', 'wilderness', 'areas', 'battleships', 'crew', 'sequence', 'where', 'Thunder', 'Child', 'warship', 'martians', 'terribly', 'bungled', 'animated', 'ships', 'are', 'comical', 'traveling', 'wakes', 'impossible', 'velocities', 'firing', 'guns', 'one', 'manning', 'quite', 'embarrassing', 'Much', 'footage', 'actors', 'confined', 'reacting', 'off-camera', 'action', 'placed', 'CG', 'background', 'even', 'interiors', 'seem', 'be', 'matted', 'really', 'so', 'hard', 'film', 'simple', 'interiors', 'think', 'someone', 'else', 'here', 'pointed', 'out', 'many', 'scenes', 'CG', 'effects', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'outtakes', 'mockups', 'real', 'shot', 'are', 'real', 'shot', 'night', 'seem', 'be', 'shot', 'day', 'blue', 'filter', 'thought', 'went', 'out', 'low', 'budget', 'films', '60', 'may', 'need', 'get', 'motion', 'sickness', 'pills', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'camera', 'steps', 'so', 'jerky', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'getting', 'dizzy', 'watching', 'Then', 'terrible', 'editing', 'are', 'treated', 'hour', 'extraneous', 'footage', 'people', 'running', 'grasslands', 'down', 'empty', 'roads', 'same', 'groups', 'trees', 'clear', 'reason', 'impress', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'way', 'was', 'age', 'car', 'wanted', 'get', 'somewhere', 'had', 'walk', 'run', 'judging', 'amount', 'jogging', 'around', 'film', 'apparently', 'everyone', 'Victorian', 'England', 'was', 'marathon', 'class', 'runner', 'even', 'women', 'long', 'dresses', 'high', 'heeled', 'boots', 'Indeed', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'start', 'indeed', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'devoted', 'Ogilvie', 'climbing', 'Martian', 'cylinder', 'pit', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'purpose', 'are', 'serious', 'issues', 'sound', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'difficult', 'understand', 'much', 'dialogue', 'mixed', 'so', 'low', 'comparison', 'music', 'narrated', 'parts', 'was', 'looking', 'subtitles', 'found', 'none', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'quite', 'closely', 'book', 'most', 'dialogue', 'verbatim', 'internal', 'conversations', 'happen', 'written', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'compelling', 'on-screen', 'speech', 'turn-of-the-century', 'prose', 'rather', 'stilted', 'times', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'least', 'competent', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'are', 'lt', '>', 'friends', 'relatives', 'someone', 'suppose', 'should', 'stop', 'criticizing', 'film', 'know', 'guy', 'put', 'alot', 'effort', 'obvious', 'bit', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'chew', 'lt', 'sigh', '>']",H.G.

Most filmmakers would have tried to conceal just how awful this film was, perhaps by only running ""teaser"" previews which would rave about how great the movie was while never making the mistake of showing any actual footage, but not Pendragon. By putting the insanely cheap ""Fall of Big Ben"" scene - not to mention the equally hilarious ""Here Comes the Glowing Green Cartoon Meteor Straight From PBS's BooBah Show"" bit - right there in the preview, the filmmakers left no doubt of just how low the film's quality was going to be, and for that I salute them. It's refreshing to see such clueless honesty in marketing nowadays.The problem is this: although the preview is very, very funny, the film itself runs far too long to continue laughing at it. Oh sure, the first five minutes or so, in which the lead character lets his heavy eyeliner and fake mustache do all his acting for him, well, that's pure comedy gold. But after an hour and a half of the performing mustache and eyeliner routine, that gold starts to tarnish pretty badly. And when you realize there's still ANOTHER hour and a half left to go, well, that's when you completely lose all faith in humanity and start dressing up like a huge cockroach, in hopes that when they finally assume their rightful place as the ultimate rulers of the Earth, they'll at least let you hang around and fetch moldy donuts for them and things.In the meantime, however, you've got to find a practical use for this DVD. Here are some things you can try:Chew on it. Puppies love chewing on shiny, plastic things like DVDs, and puppies always look happy. Maybe chewing on this DVD will make you happy too. Just don't crunch it up and swallow it. That will not make you happy. And the proctologist who will have to help you sort things out afterwards will not be happy AT ALL.Talk to it. Talking to plants can help them grow into bigger, healthier plants. Maybe talking to this DVD will help it grow into a real, less-stupid movie. You will have to say just the right things though, like ""Hey, Mr. Wal-Mart employee, take this back and give me a copy of anything else instead, even 'Racing Stripes' or 'Pauly Shore Is Dead.'""Take it out dancing. Yes, you will look extremely silly trying to dance with a DVD, and you will get thrown out and banned from many, many clubs, but at least you won't be at home, where this film might accidentally find its way into your DVD player and start running again. It's worth any humiliation to avoid that grim possibility.Stomp on it. This is the most satisfying thing to do. But don't just run up and do it. First sidle up to the DVD. Walk around it casually. Then lightly shuffle around it doing an energetic Mexican Hat Dance. And then, when it least expects it, LEAP DOWN UPON IT AND BRUTALLY CRUSH IT INTO A THOUSAND MILLION GLEAMING SPLINTERS OF SPARKLING PLASTIC GARBAGE. Now you feel great! Unless you weren't wearing any shoes, and now maybe you feel like you need a doctor. Well, just don't mention my name when you start filling out those vast piles of emergency room forms. Whatever strange things you choose to do in your own home are no concern of mine.",1,Not good. Possibly even unhealthy.

910854,A2BVNMTD504LHC,B0009PW4D2,Edward E. Rom,"[9, 10]","When I first heard that this movie was going to be coming out, I was very enthusiastic about it.  This is a fantastic concept, doing WotW just as Wells wrote it, and I eagerly anticipated seeing it.  That feeling, as it turned out, was entirely misplaced.  I turned it off when it got to the scene where the Narrator has the accident with the dog-cart, when the horse got spooked by seeing a Martian fighting machine in the midst of the thunderstorm.The biggest problem here is that these are some of the cheesiest special effects I have ever seen, other than in the Doctor Who TV serials.  Unlike the Doctor Who series, this story is not saved by intelligent scripting and good acting.I can tolerate a certain amount of lack of realism when it comes to the ""sci-fi"" parts of a film -- it's difficult to realistically depict things that do not exist in our mundane world.  In this film, though, I began to be uneasy very close to the beginning, when the Narrator and his wife are walking through a sun-dappled (!) landscape, and are looking at the stars in the sky -- it took me a little while to realize that this was supposed to be night-time!  I wasn't impressed by the rainstorm that looked like a snowfall, either.  This really is the worst feature of the film, the fact that the special effects are not even up to the standards of realism of the year 1950, let alone 2005.  It is in my opinion ridiculous that the 1953 George Pal production of WotW would have better special effects than this movie, but that is indeed the case.As for the acting (and, by implication, the directing), this reminded me of something made-for-TV.  I was really annoyed by the characterization of Ogilvy; I have no idea why the character was written this way for the film, but he came off as a bad example of a stereotyped scientist in a children's TV show.  I became glad that he gets killed off early in the story after about two minutes of him on-screen, because it was painful to watch this low-talent ham acting.The other characters were not as badly portrayed, but none of them seemed to have what I would think of as ""presence.""  I suppose that they must have been paid the actorly equivalent of minimum wage -- and, as in anything, you get what you pay for.Another thing I always pay attention to when watching a film is the soundtrack.  This film's soundtrack sounds cheap and generic, and at points is actually reminiscent of a TV sitcom.  I personally prefer a minimalist approach to a soundtrack -- to hear what I mean, watch the 1970 version of Get Carter, starring Michael Caine, or any Stanley Kubrick film, and listen.  The minimalist approach to soundtrack music is especially useful when it's a low-budget project, as in Get Carter (In that case, I think the producers had to throw out the soundtrack in order to pay Michael Caine -- and this was indeed what I'd call wise budgeting!).My final thought for this review is that the producers of this film should not have wasted their money in this fashion.  A project of this sort is extremely ambitious -- in this case, bringing a true-to-the-author's-vision rendition of one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written to the screen -- and it strikes me that this is one of those things you either spend at least $50 million on, or don't attempt at all.  I don't know what the actual budget was, but for this money they probably could have made a nice little movie that people would have liked, and that would have gotten them ahead in their careers.  What they actually got was an abomination and an atrocity, a total waste of time, money, and effort.  I seriously doubt that participation in this project will look good on anyone's resume.",1,The Great Disillusionment,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,3703,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'coming', 'was', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'fantastic', 'concept', 'doing', 'WotW', 'just', 'Wells', 'wrote', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'entirely', 'misplaced', 'turned', 'off', 'when', 'got', 'scene', 'where', 'Narrator', 'accident', 'dog-cart', 'when', 'horse', 'got', 'spooked', 'seeing', 'Martian', 'fighting', 'machine', 'midst', 'thunderstorm.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'are', 'cheesiest', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'TV', 'serials', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'story', 'not', 'saved', 'intelligent', 'scripting', 'good', 'acting.I', 'can', 'tolerate', 'certain', 'amount', 'lack', 'realism', 'when', 'sci-fi', 'parts', 'film', 'difficult', 'realistically', 'depict', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'mundane', 'world', 'film', 'began', 'be', 'uneasy', 'very', 'close', 'beginning', 'when', 'Narrator', 'wife', 'are', 'walking', 'sun-dappled', 'landscape', 'are', 'looking', 'stars', 'sky', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'realize', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'night-time', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'rainstorm', 'looked', 'snowfall', 'either', 'really', 'worst', 'feature', 'film', 'fact', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'standards', 'realism', 'year', '1950', 'let', 'alone', '2005', 'opinion', 'ridiculous', '1953', 'George', 'Pal', 'production', 'WotW', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'indeed', 'case.As', 'acting', 'implication', 'directing', 'reminded', 'something', 'made-for-TV', 'was', 'really', 'annoyed', 'characterization', 'Ogilvy', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'film', 'came', 'off', 'bad', 'example', 'stereotyped', 'scientist', 'children', 'TV', 'show', 'became', 'glad', 'killed', 'off', 'early', 'story', 'two', 'minutes', 'on-screen', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'low-talent', 'ham', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'badly', 'portrayed', 'none', 'seemed', 'have', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'presence', 'suppose', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'actorly', 'equivalent', 'minimum', 'wage', 'anything', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'for.Another', 'thing', 'always', 'pay', 'attention', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'cheap', 'generic', 'points', 'actually', 'reminiscent', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'personally', 'prefer', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'soundtrack', 'hear', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', '1970', 'version', 'Get', 'Carter', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'listen', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'especially', 'useful', 'when', 'low-budget', 'project', 'Get', 'Carter', 'case', 'think', 'producers', 'had', 'throw', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'order', 'pay', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'was', 'indeed', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'wise', 'budgeting', '.My', 'final', 'thought', 'review', 'producers', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'wasted', 'money', 'fashion', 'project', 'sort', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'case', 'bringing', ""true-to-the-author's-vision"", 'rendition', 'one', 'greatest', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'ever', 'written', 'screen', 'one', 'things', 'either', 'spend', 'least', '50', 'million', 'do', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'actual', 'budget', 'was', 'money', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'ahead', 'careers', 'What', 'actually', 'got', 'was', 'abomination', 'atrocity', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'participation', 'project', 'will', 'look', 'good', 'anyone', 'resume']",H.G.

910857,ALM1ZGI0H4U9D,B0009PW4D2,George M. Graves,"[10, 12]","This is possibly the worst motion picture ever made. Think about ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" - this Pendragon film of Wells' classic is much worse. ""Robot Monster"" - this version of  ""War of the Worlds"" is far worse. In fact, Pendragon's ""War of the Worlds"" makes these '50's sci-fi clinkers seem like ""Ben Hur"" by comparison. What's wrong with it? Where to begin...First of all, the script is lousy. Though derived from Wells' dialog in the book, it is stilted and clumsey. This isn't helped by the fact that all the actors in the film are ""community playhouse"" caliber - at best. Th acting is simply amateurish in the extreme.Secondly, the directing is inept. This director has no sense of pace whatsoever. The movie runs just under three hours and by the time it ends, the viewer is three years older. More than half the film consists of medium to long shots of various characters simply running around. Long minutes of the main character stumbling through forests and over fields and along footpaths where just a quick shot of same would have sufficed, seem to account much of this movie's length. It's boring in the extreme and ultimately, very tiring.This movie was made on a shoestring budget, and one must admire the folks involved for such an ambitious undertaking. I suspect that the thinking was that compters are cheap, and the tools with which to make the special effects shots are easy to come by, and of little cost. In fact there is an open source 3-D rendering suite called POV-RAY that is free for anyone to download. It consists of rendering tools, modeling front ends and compositing modules and is very capable software. If you have seen the original concept teaser that director Kerry Conran made in his attic in the '90's using an old Macintosh for ""Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow"" then you would know that these types of tools are capable of doing excellent work. The power of the major studios' special effects departments are available for anyone to use. Unfortunately, just as owning a copy of PageMaker doesn't make the owner a talented and experienced publisher, neither does a computer and some 3D software make one a special effects expert. That's the problem here. Whoever did the models of the war machines and the creatures, themselves, did a credible job. One might not agree with the interpretation of Wells' descriptions of these things, but that's a matter of taste, and I'm not going to comment. The main problem seems to be that whoever did the animation of these war machines and creatures hasn't clue one about animating. War machines sometimes walk, but often they seem to just slide across the screen. Movement is jerky and seems, to a large extent, totally unmotivated. The scene where the creatures get in a running battle in the English Channel with a British warship is so poorly animated and composited as to be laughable. And watch the long shots of cavalry horses moving across the heather. The leg motion of the horses doesn't match the motion AT ALL.This film is overly long, tiring, unsatisfying on every level, and for the most part downright inept. Save your money to see the Spielberg version in the theater. It might not be all that satisfying either, but at least it will be a professional, competently made motion picture.",1,Bored with the World is a Better Title,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,3287,"['possibly', 'worst', 'motion', 'picture', 'ever', 'made', 'Think', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Pendragon', 'film', 'Wells', 'classic', 'much', 'worse', 'Robot', 'Monster', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'far', 'worse', 'fact', 'Pendragon', 'War', 'Worlds', 'sci-fi', 'clinkers', 'seem', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'comparison', 'What', 'wrong', 'Where', 'begin', 'First', 'all', 'script', 'lousy', 'derived', 'Wells', 'dialog', 'book', 'stilted', 'clumsey', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'community', 'playhouse', 'caliber', 'best', 'Th', 'acting', 'simply', 'amateurish', 'extreme.Secondly', 'directing', 'inept', 'director', 'sense', 'pace', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'just', 'three', 'hours', 'time', 'viewer', 'three', 'years', 'older', 'More', 'film', 'medium', 'long', 'shots', 'various', 'characters', 'simply', 'running', 'around', 'Long', 'minutes', 'main', 'character', 'stumbling', 'forests', 'fields', 'along', 'footpaths', 'where', 'just', 'quick', 'shot', 'same', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'seem', 'account', 'much', 'movie', 'length', 'boring', 'extreme', 'ultimately', 'very', 'tiring.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'one', 'must', 'admire', 'folks', 'involved', 'such', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'suspect', 'thinking', 'was', 'compters', 'are', 'cheap', 'tools', 'make', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'are', 'easy', 'come', 'little', 'cost', 'fact', 'open', 'source', '3-D', 'rendering', 'suite', 'called', 'POV-RAY', 'free', 'anyone', 'download', 'rendering', 'tools', 'modeling', 'front', 'ends', 'compositing', 'modules', 'very', 'capable', 'software', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'concept', 'teaser', 'director', 'Kerry', 'Conran', 'made', 'attic', ""'90"", 'using', 'old', 'Macintosh', 'Sky', 'Captain', 'World', 'Tomorrow', 'then', 'would', 'know', 'types', 'tools', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'excellent', 'work', 'power', 'major', 'studios', 'special', 'effects', 'departments', 'are', 'available', 'anyone', 'use', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'owning', 'copy', 'PageMaker', ""n't"", 'make', 'owner', 'talented', 'experienced', 'publisher', 'computer', '3D', 'software', 'make', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'expert', 'problem', 'here', 'Whoever', 'did', 'models', 'war', 'machines', 'creatures', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'One', 'might', 'not', 'agree', 'interpretation', 'Wells', 'descriptions', 'things', 'matter', 'taste', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'main', 'problem', 'be', 'did', 'animation', 'war', 'machines', 'creatures', ""n't"", 'clue', 'one', 'animating', 'War', 'machines', 'sometimes', 'walk', 'often', 'seem', 'just', 'slide', 'screen', 'Movement', 'jerky', 'large', 'extent', 'totally', 'unmotivated', 'scene', 'where', 'creatures', 'get', 'running', 'battle', 'English', 'Channel', 'British', 'warship', 'so', 'poorly', 'animated', 'composited', 'be', 'laughable', 'watch', 'long', 'shots', 'cavalry', 'horses', 'moving', 'heather', 'leg', 'motion', 'horses', ""n't"", 'match', 'motion', 'AT', 'ALL.This', 'film', 'overly', 'long', 'tiring', 'unsatisfying', 'level', 'most', 'part', 'downright', 'inept', 'Save', 'money', 'see', 'Spielberg', 'version', 'theater', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'satisfying', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'professional', 'competently', 'made', 'motion', 'picture']",H.G.

Goebel ""artstaub""","[16, 18]","After reading the mostly negative reviews of this film, I decided to buy it anyhow based on my longtime love of H.G.Wells classic tale of an alien armageddon. I went into it with an open mind...I really did. This version of the story starts off promising, I found the cinematography to be really interesting in it's use of sepia and tinted backgrounds and it was obvious that Timothy Hines, the director was trying to make it look as if the film was made around the turn of the century. It was true to the story too and this pleased me. The specials effects, crude by today's standards actually had a charm all their own... at the start. The first turkey indicator was the mustache on the main charactor, it looked like it was purchased from a Wal-Mart costume display at Halloween time and I found myself laughing out loud every time I concentrated on it. It started to become a distraction. The acting for the most part was really awful, particularly the main charactor's wife. I was resolved however to see this thing through it's entire lenght. Another distraction was the editing which was as inept as it gets. If a charactor has to get from one place to another we are treated to endless takes of them walking through fields and woods forever and ever. No wonder this thing runs 3 hours, but I was anxious to see the infamous tripods so I kept telling myself to hang in there. When they finally appeared they got the biggest laugh of all out of me as they hoped and skipped in jerky strides across the landscape. At this point I said to myself ""So many good movies and so little time, I'm outta' here.""

Parten,"[4, 8]","This little film was certainly worth the price, and a faithful adaption of ""War of the Worlds"" is long over due, but did the director have to film every little to-and-fro in the story? The first hour of the film involves so many scenes of the narrator just quietly walking from one place to the other I almost lost interest and gave up on it right then and there. Hey, director, ever hear of a lapse disolve? Or a montage?Many scenes go on way too long, and would have benefited from trimming either at their beginning, their ending, or both. At three hours, the whole thing could have used a lot of tightening up. A two hour version would have been excellent, and nothing would have been lost in the telling of the story.Having said all that, anyone viewing it can tell it was a labor of love, and perhaps that was the problem.  Someone should have stepped back and looked at it with a critic eye and the audience in mind and broke out the scissors.On the positive side, the Martians and their war machines are well realized, and some of the effects are spectacular.

Last thing I remember, I was singing a karoake version of Kenny Roger's megahit ""lady"" in the basement of a local freemason. That's the last thing I remember. When I awoke in the morning, I was aghast to find myself nude and painted blue, with a Llama eating grass in my backyard. Even worse, I had this movie superglued to my right bicep. I decided to watch it. mistake!Let me point out that I am not a filmaker. I know it is very easy to criticise what other people have created, but much more difficult to actually create something. I do not know anything about how to write a movie script, or what a gaffer does, or any of that. All I know is what I like to watch. One thing I do not like watching is a man with a mustache that can only be described as ""retarded"" running, walking, and biking all over a fake british countryside. But friends, that is what you get. You could take half the footage from this ""film"" and make a documentary on how to use your feet and legs for locomotion purposes. The rest of the movie could then be spliced together and shown to people you don't like for revenge purposes.Holy balls. What can I say that hasn't been said before by the other unfortunates who have witnessed this movie? I used to judge movies based on a simple schematic. A good movie is one that is near the brilliance of such films as Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, and Dolemite. A bad movie is one that would rank somwhere in the vicinity of House of the Dead. Guess what? House of the Dead is better than this movie. we have a new bottom of the barrel DVD! On a scale of one through ten, ten being the highest, and one being the lowest, this movie gets an F-.On the upside, I did throw up while watching this, which made my hangover abate somewhat. Also, I did watch the whole thing, and seeing as this movie is about thirteen hours long, my hangover had actually gone away by the time it was over(I am the kind of guy who looks for a silver lining).In summation, I must advise that every single person on earth not watch this movie. Don't watch it to make fun of it. Don't watch it to see skeletons on fire that magically thrash around even though their muscles are absent. Don't watch it to see the sweet acting during the Thunderchild sequence. And most of all, don't watch it just because it's glued to your bicep.

This movie, made by some unknown company calling itself  Pendragonpictures, produced this rather low budget effort with sloppy special effects, silly acting and rather shoddy CGI.  In one scene theyshowed a train (obviously an American one) passing by, pulled by an American diesel electric locomotive which didn't exist in 1898and the passenger cars were not British (I worked for a railroad once).  Later they would show another American train, this time witha steam engine (better!).The picture often jumped, sometimes skip a frame or two, blurry and lousy  color.  So why did I give it 4 stars?First, because it is the only version of the book that is faithful to the book.  Only a few changes made, very insignificant  while the restvery closely followed the book, using much the same dialogue.  The martian designs were ok, but I thought the best part of the filmwas the beautifully designed martian fighting machines.  Slick, scary and beautiful!!  The  heat ray was ok, not the flaming laser type found in other invasion movies.  The burning of the houses was for the most part done well, though the fire flames lookedfakey.  The best scene of the film (and it is worth seeing) is when our hero and the curate were trapped in the house crushed by thefallen cylinder.  Here the special effects were very good and the handling machines the martians  really looked good.  I think mostof the studios budget must have gone into the house scenes.  While this would had made a great picture with a larger budget, Istill rank it above Spielbergs  mess.  Only the 1950s Paramount film tops this in my opinion.  If you like H. G.

The expressionistic use of color, and the almost surreal effect of scenes taking place where one view with night sky is crosscut with another with day reminded me of one famous painting by Magritte.  The special effects were interesting too, not always wholly convincing or consistent, but often quite impressive: the initial victims of the Heat-Ray, on the common, collapsing into skeletons (yet writhing as if still alive) reminded me of Ray Harryhausen's skeletons in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (and several later hommages to that scene, including the deaths in Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks!"")...  on reflection, the effect-- where even the live-action sequences are altered to make them LESS realistic-- seems to me to be a filmic equivalent of a comic book.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing! And the adherence closely to the original book is refreshing, too.

Now that it is out I have mixed feelings about it.To be fair, the first hour or so played very nicely.  I actually enjoyed the slower pace getting to the cylinder opening scene.  I appreciated some of the character development during this time.  It often felt like a PBS British drama.  Also found the first sighting by the narrator of the Martian machines in the storm to be a creepy part.  I liked the artilleryman's retelling of the events he experienced, too.However, after that point I felt that the film just moved too slowly and had too few battle scenes and the ones that were there were too short.  No momentum or sign of great distress on the part of the populace. Where were the mobs of people evacuating before the Martians?  Basically we just see 4 or 5 people at a time escaping.  Especially disappointing was the Thunderchild scene where it almost seemed like the folks on the boat were out on a holiday or something!Special effects?  Already covered elsewhere in other reviews.  Day for night shots were really the worst thing, though, and too many CGI rooms, horses, people, etc.  What I did like were the color effects and the starry skies that were used.  Like someone else already mentioned, and my wife and I had discussed as well, the color tints and the jerkiness of the film made it look like a film of the period.  Might play better with the color turned off!Am I happy with this film?  No.  Do I hate it?  No.  Maybe it could be re-cut, special effects worked on, and shown as a mini-series on TV!",3,"Interesting, but Somewhat Disappointing Film",1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,1636,"['others', 'looked', 'forward', 'version', 'quite', 'while', 'following', 'progress', 'web', 'so', 'forth', 'Now', 'out', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'it.To', 'be', 'fair', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'played', 'very', 'nicely', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'slower', 'pace', 'getting', 'cylinder', 'opening', 'scene', 'appreciated', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'often', 'felt', 'PBS', 'British', 'drama', 'Also', 'found', 'first', 'sighting', 'narrator', 'Martian', 'machines', 'storm', 'be', 'creepy', 'part', 'liked', 'artilleryman', 'retelling', 'events', 'experienced', 'too.However', 'point', 'felt', 'film', 'just', 'moved', 'too', 'slowly', 'had', 'too', 'few', 'battle', 'scenes', 'ones', 'were', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'momentum', 'sign', 'great', 'distress', 'part', 'populace', 'Where', 'were', 'mobs', 'people', 'evacuating', 'Martians', 'Basically', 'just', 'see', '4', '5', 'people', 'time', 'escaping', 'Especially', 'disappointing', 'was', 'Thunderchild', 'scene', 'where', 'almost', 'seemed', 'folks', 'boat', 'were', 'out', 'holiday', 'something', 'Special', 'effects', 'Already', 'covered', 'elsewhere', 'other', 'reviews', 'Day', 'night', 'shots', 'were', 'really', 'worst', 'thing', 'though', 'too', 'many', 'CGI', 'rooms', 'horses', 'people', 'etc', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'were', 'color', 'effects', 'starry', 'skies', 'were', 'used', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'mentioned', 'wife', 'had', 'discussed', 'as', 'well', 'color', 'tints', 'jerkiness', 'film', 'made', 'look', 'film', 'period', 'Might', 'play', 'better', 'color', 'turned', 'off', 'Am', 'happy', 'film', 'No', 'Do', 'hate', 'No', 'Maybe', 'could', 'be', 're-cut', 'special', 'effects', 'worked', 'shown', 'mini-series', 'TV']",H.G.

The internet being what it is, it's hard to separate fact from rumor sometimes. It's not neccesary, however, to delve into accusations in regards to Mr. Hines character in order to pan his version of War of the Worlds. It's admirable that he set out to do the story in its original form, and attempted to deliver the first faithful adaptation of H.G. Well's seminal novel. Unfortunately, what he's ultimately delivered just might be the worst film of the decade. The story's there, that much can be said. But practically none of the other elements come together to properly service it. The acting and cinematography are so ametuerish that it's hard to believe that Mr. Hines has had a career behind the camera, even in television commercials. Frames strain and quiver to contain the simplest of motions, at times, and in others the picture quality looks barely above that of consumer level home video. The musical score alone has been praised but it's so over-bearingly loud in the film that it begins to grate the nerves. And then comes the matter of the dialogue track, the actors seem muted, as if we're listening to them with ears packed with gauze. One screening of this by its director should have prompted a new sound mix prior to release.And now, to the special effects. Mr. Hines depends heavily on CGI to tell his story, which would have been fine had the graphics not been so incompetently crafted. And early scene of the ""narrator"" driving his horse and buggy at night with a computer matted background is a grim harbinger of things to come. If Mr. Hines can't convincingly potray a horse and buggy ride, how can he hope to depict an alien invasion with towering Martian tripods laying waste to turn of the Century England? Witness the battle between a pair of Martian tripods and the ""Thunder Child"" warship. To see it is to see awfulness in its purest form.In this mind-numbingly long three hour feature, one sequence alone stands out as being relatively effective. The ""narrator"" and a priest are trapped beneath the rubble of a house demolished by a landing Martian cylinder. The desperation and horror the two men experience there is fairly well communicated, despite the limitations of the production. If only that could be said for more of this film.Mr. Hines can't complain. He realized his life long dream of making ""War of the Worlds"", and though it failed to secure theatrical distribution, it got a fairly wide video release.

910876,A276YAD1NSV9LQ,B0009PW4D2,J. Young,"[21, 33]","War of the Worlds is a dark tale written in 1898, taking place around 1900, about man's transient place in nature, and the effects of modern machinery on human struggle, whether the machines are in the hands of humans or another species entirely. In the original book, humankind and the narrator are both in defeat and despair at the end, saved for the time being not by any human effort or invention, but by the accidental vulnerability of the Martians to a bacterial organism--another natural species entirely.This engaging film tells the story in full, including dialogue taken almost verbatim by the page from the original. The visuals are photographed or processed to simulate early 20th Century hand-cranked cameras and projectors, so motion is at variable speeds, with the flickering quality of sub-24-frame-per-second projection. The color is in the style of tinted or two-color process early film (such as sequences in Hell's Angels or the original King of Kings). The actors act like people of 1900, in speech, manner and sentiment. The audio quality is modern, with a good symphonic score.Special effects echo an earlier age of film, even those effects probably duplicated with  CGI rather than modelling and stop-motion. Folks who have to have modern graphics won't like it, period. However this film is a story being told, not an imitation of an imaginary hyper-reality handed to an audience. It requires an extention of the viewer's mind, and rewards that effort with a journey through the world of Herbert George Wells. The Martian war machines and the reduction of their victims to skeletons, as well as the occasional squashing-flat of the stomped-on are efforts which Harryhausen would appreciate (though one sequence of naval combat would have been regarded as primitive by D W Griffith).Because of the fidelity to the book, and probably because the film is released on DVD without preliminary editing for an American theatre audience, it runs three hours, a sort of director's cut. For those who get into the creative stye of the film and enjoy the details of the authentic story, this is not too long.",5,A tribute to H G Wells and the early years of film making.,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,2122,"['War', 'Worlds', 'dark', 'tale', 'written', '1898', 'taking', 'place', '1900', 'man', 'transient', 'place', 'nature', 'effects', 'modern', 'machinery', 'human', 'struggle', 'machines', 'are', 'hands', 'humans', 'species', 'entirely', 'original', 'book', 'humankind', 'narrator', 'are', 'defeat', 'despair', 'end', 'saved', 'time', 'being', 'not', 'human', 'effort', 'invention', 'accidental', 'vulnerability', 'Martians', 'bacterial', 'organism', 'natural', 'species', 'entirely.This', 'engaging', 'film', 'story', 'full', 'including', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'page', 'original', 'visuals', 'are', 'photographed', 'processed', 'simulate', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'hand-cranked', 'cameras', 'projectors', 'motion', 'variable', 'speeds', 'flickering', 'quality', 'sub-24-frame-per-second', 'projection', 'color', 'style', 'tinted', 'two-color', 'process', 'early', 'film', 'such', 'sequences', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'original', 'King', 'Kings', 'actors', 'act', 'people', '1900', 'speech', 'manner', 'sentiment', 'audio', 'quality', 'modern', 'good', 'symphonic', 'score.Special', 'effects', 'echo', 'earlier', 'age', 'film', 'even', 'effects', 'probably', 'duplicated', 'CGI', 'rather', 'modelling', 'stop-motion', 'Folks', 'who', 'have', 'have', 'modern', 'graphics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'period', 'However', 'film', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'imitation', 'imaginary', 'hyper-reality', 'handed', 'audience', 'extention', 'viewer', 'mind', 'rewards', 'effort', 'journey', 'world', 'Herbert', 'George', 'Wells', 'Martian', 'war', 'machines', 'reduction', 'victims', 'skeletons', 'as', 'well', 'occasional', 'squashing-flat', 'stomped-on', 'are', 'efforts', 'Harryhausen', 'would', 'appreciate', 'one', 'sequence', 'naval', 'combat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'regarded', 'primitive', 'D', 'W', 'Griffith', '.Because', 'fidelity', 'book', 'probably', 'film', 'released', 'DVD', 'preliminary', 'editing', 'American', 'theatre', 'audience', 'three', 'hours', 'sort', 'director', 'cut', 'who', 'get', 'creative', 'stye', 'film', 'enjoy', 'details', 'authentic', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'long']",H.G.

We were very disappointed for many reasons, but the main one is that it was not at all like the book.  I was delighted to find that this had been made as close to the book as possible.  What makes this a fantastic show is that the filming is done in an old classic style.  It is easy to say that the special effects are cheep because it was made to look that way.  Black and white frames hand colored, tinted frames, night sky backdrop painted.  There are even some sceens that are a mixure of black and white and tinted.  Why? To give the feeling that you are actually back at that time period, late 1800's.  The special effects are NOT cheep, but stylized as it would have been done at the turn of the century.  It is almost like watching a silent film with dialogue.  It is extremely creative and artistic.  My 11 year old son is now reading the book and says that the DVD follows the book pretty close.  In fact the DVD follows the description of the tripods and the martians according to the book.  If you want to see what HG Wells had in mind, watch this.  My wife is a librarian for fiction and stated that there had been very little interest in the book since the ""movie"" came out.  But when my sons, 11 and 15 saw this DVD, my oldest son insisted on getting the book for himself.  I think that any production that motivates a teenager to read has merit!

Spielberg's version moves very quickly with gorgeous special effects but basically throws away the book except for the beginning and ending narration and the tripod machines destroying everything.This version tells the story in the book, but really lacks in the special effects department, and that's putting it charitably.I won't repeat what others have said, but I think this was a basically good idea that didn't go far enough.  They began with old silent footage to introduce the story and then went into a ""talkie"" movie with all kinds of tones to make it look old.  A lot of footage went by while actors showed various emotional expressions on their faces without saying anything, just like the old silent films.So, why didn't they just make a silent film?  They could have used modern technology to create a faux silent movie of the War of the Worlds in black and white, looking like it had been created in the 1910's to depict something that had recently happened.They still would have to bump the effects up a notch.  For example, rather than creating bad computer game animation of an ironclad on the water, go buy a model of an ironclad, put it out on a lake, and blow it up.  That would have been better.The upside of this movie is that it could probably be edited to half it's length without losing much in the way of plot progression, and then it can serve as an episode of a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type of show sometime later this century.",2,"Well, it was a neat idea...",1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,1542,"['about', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'get', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Spielberg', 'version', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'gorgeous', 'special', 'effects', 'basically', 'away', 'book', 'beginning', 'ending', 'narration', 'tripod', 'machines', 'destroying', 'everything.This', 'version', 'story', 'book', 'really', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'putting', 'charitably.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'think', 'was', 'basically', 'good', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'began', 'old', 'silent', 'footage', 'introduce', 'story', 'then', 'went', 'talkie', 'movie', 'kinds', 'tones', 'make', 'look', 'old', 'lot', 'footage', 'went', 'actors', 'showed', 'various', 'emotional', 'expressions', 'saying', 'anything', 'just', 'old', 'silent', 'films.So', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'silent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'modern', 'technology', 'create', 'faux', 'silent', 'movie', 'War', 'Worlds', 'black', 'white', 'looking', 'had', 'been', 'created', '1910', 'depict', 'something', 'had', 'recently', 'happened.They', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'bump', 'effects', 'up', 'notch', 'example', 'rather', 'creating', 'bad', 'computer', 'game', 'animation', 'ironclad', 'water', 'go', 'buy', 'model', 'ironclad', 'put', 'out', 'lake', 'blow', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.The', 'upside', 'movie', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'edited', 'half', 'length', 'losing', 'much', 'way', 'plot', 'progression', 'then', 'can', 'serve', 'episode', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'type', 'show', 'sometime', 'later', 'century']",H.G.

Now you would think that a s hour long version of the classic novel would be a good thing. But what this film is instead is one of the most badly acted, poorly done, and overly faithful films ever made.Now the film has two things going for it. The first being that it is a straight adaptation of the novel. This is a plus for fans of the original novel who've been waiting forever for an actual adaptation of the novel. The script is incredibly faithful to the novel though it uses some things too much and uses some things (like the Writer in the ruins of London) too little. The other plus is the film's music. Jamie Hall produced a terrific score to the film. The music perfectly fits the scenes it is used in and whenever in appears it boosts the film considerably.But these are only a small part of the film. And they can't save it from its greatest faults. Between the horrible acting, terrible CGI effects, and a massive length, this film is a complete and utter disaster. Allow me to explain further:The acting in the film is terrible to say the least. The performances are uninspired and while the actors suit their roles physically, they never do seem to be able to get into their characters. The acting in the scene when the Martains first use the heat ray is laughable not only because of the bad special effects but because of the bad acting. The fact that all of the characters are British with obvious American accents is further proof of the low budget nature of the film.The special effects are CGI and bad CGI at that. The scene in which The Writer and his Wife are looking up into the night sky is the first of many examples I can think of. The use of CGI to create cities is laughable and incredibly obvious. The constant use of the same extras in scenes showing chaos in cities is another piece of proof of the low budget. And let's not forget the Martains! Instead of being as terrifying as the people in the film made it seem, it is a bad piece of CGI and laughable to say the least.The film's length is another issue. A lot of the film is spent walking. There is a constant amount of walking in the film is astronomical and slows the film down to lee then a snail's pace. A ton of the film could have been cut out to make it shorter and maybe even better.Overall this is a disaster. I reccomend this only if you're a die-hard Welles fan in search of a straight adaptation of the novel then this is the film for you. Or maybe if you are a fan of the really, really bad 1950's sci-fi films. Otherwise avoid this film and the three hours of your life you will lose to it.",1,H.G.

LOL------CONs:-The film was WAY too long!- They could have easily edited out an hour to an hour and a half of the film and had a better product...- The pointless ""running through the woods"" scenes were pretty tiring...- The use of colored camera lenses made for a very quick progression of time: night, day, night, day, etc. ...sometimes it seemed as if day and night switched every couple of minutes...- The annoying opera singer was simply terrible!- The music lulled me to sleep on several occasions...- Some of the film's dialogue seems as if it was taken from the book VERBATIM... this made for some awkward dialogue in spots...- The blue screen filming was often PAINFULLY obvious...- Many of the actors played two or more roles in the film...- The acting quality on the film wasn't always very high... for example:The big ""Thunder Childe"" scene (Martian Tripods versus a pre-WWI naval dreadnought) was like watching a tennis match:- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...- On and on, etc., etc.That ""CGI to actors back and forth"" sequence characterizes much of the film.------PROs:- More accurate to the original H.G. Wells novel than any other WOTW film...- In fact, at times, it seems as if the film EXACTLY mirrors the book's chapters...- Interesting visualizations of the Martians!- Cool retro special effects that were pitiful at times but very nostalgic of early sci-fi pulp novels and films...- The damned preacher always had his mouth stuffed full of bread! He was just as annoying as the book seemed to intend him to be!- The annoying opera singer who was simply terrible got eaten!- The period clothing and hair styles were oustanding... Love the curls!!!- They remembered to feature the Martian ""black smoke,"" but it seemed to be very sparsely featured (I seem to recall that ""black smoke"" was what defeated the British navy at the Battle Of the Thames... not in the film... ).- They actually remembered to feature the elusive Martian flyers!------OVERVIEW:I can't recommend this film for entertainment value, but the alien visualizations are great. Only a very serious fan of WOTW would like this film. The average Joe will probably be bored to sleep... and maybe a few serious WOTW fans as well...

910889,A27JJILLBKWIR9,B0009PW4D2,"Megarat ""a well-intended critic""","[8, 9]","You're probably an H.G. Wells fan.You're probably appreciative of independent, low-budget cinema, and unfazed by poor special effects.  You can see past the gloss, and artistry brings more value to a film than millions of dollars of slick production value.On the flip side, you might even fetch some amusement from occasional bad movies.Having read the bipolar reviews for this film, you're probably thinking that you can't lose.  If it's good, everyone wins.  If it's bad, at least it should be fun to watch.  But read the reviews carefully.  You might think you can take this movie on, but it's out of your league.  This movie has left a trail of dead optimistic movie buffs in its wake.  Like the rest, it will crush you and dance on your grave.I was one of those left-for-dead optimistic movie buffs.  I love movies, with my tastes ranging from Harmony Korine to Ed Wood.  I regarded this faithful version of ""War of the Worlds"" as a worthy gamble, capable of a great payoff, and invited over two other optimistic movie buffs to share the risk.  We even had a few drinks, to soften our expectations.This is one of those bad movies that makes you feel miserable, that makes you feel like a sucker, that makes you regret not stopping it sooner.  This movie basically torments your soul for its entire three-hour runtime.  When we watched it that night, it held up for thirty minutes, max.  At one hour, I was embarrassed.  At two, I was wishing I was dead.  During the final scenes, three-plus hours into the movie's runtime, I was wishing I had never been born.To paraphrase ""The Simpsons"":  I no longer fear Hell, because I have seen this movie.Why?  The causes are far too multifarious to sum up with a simple diagnosis, but I'll give it a try.  The pacing was painful.  The acting was excruciating, even egregious.  While Anthony Piana and a few other actors earned their (small) paycheck, the rest of the cast was straight out of a junior-high-school talent show.  The special effects were worse than distracting, in that frequently you couldn't actually tell what was supposed to be happening.  (And if this was supposed to be 'artistic style', it didn't work at all, and the director should have recognized that.)This was a movie that clearly didn't have any feedback during its production, was created by a director who lacked an eye for competent cinema, and was probably just an avaricious ploy to scam money by pushing a substandard product into the marketplace concurrently with Spielberg's version and riding its wave of publicity.Still, some people claim to love this movie, and given how radical opinions can swing, I'm certain that some people do.  Yet there's apparently something else at work, resulting in an alternative reason for the bipolar nature of these reviews, and there's much controversy regarding their veracity.  Not just on Amazon, but in other sources as well.  To whit:-- The film company (Pendragon) insists that they are the subject of a guerilla smear campaign by Paramount, which is using a nameless PR firm to debase the value of this film, since it is viewed as a competitor to Spielberg's version.  (I.e., an army of faceless paid drones are posting negative reviews to make the movie look bad.)-- Many film enthusiasts believe that numerous false positive reviews have been issued by Pendragon, with the intention of misrepresenting the public opinion regarding their movie, and thus inflating their sales.  (I.e., the filmmaker and his buddies are posting positive reviews to make the movie look good.)With such identical accusations being flung from opposing sides of the fence, it implies that one of the parties is likely to be correct:  that several of the reviews are fabricated, of either the highly-positive or highly-negative variety.My one-star review probably indicates where I stand, and I'm so annoyed by Pendragon's apparent act of deception that it fueled me to write this review.

But this is a *three hour* movie, which hundreds of people claim will not only be a waste of your time, but will spur an emotional response akin to watching a loved one being horribly humiliated on national television.  You owe yourself twenty minutes of confirmation before taking the plunge.  There are lots of data out there, and it will certainly sway you one way or the other.  I wish I had done it myself before pushing ""PLAY"".Personally, I recommend that you quell your curiosity and stay away.  I don't regard this as a movie, but a con-job disguised as art.  (And honestly, the premise of this film is so promising, I would've been interested in viewing one of the shorter, revised ""director's cuts"" that have since been released, to give the film another chance.  But because of the apparent deception by Pendragon, I'm not going to fall for that again.)Still, if you decide to venture forth and give this movie a day in court, I'd encourage you to rent it, and of the three versions of this film that exist, you should watch the original, full-length (three-hour) version, so you can see what all the fuss is about.",1,Do your research before seeing this

Wells some years ago and the premise of this movie being faithful to the book was promising enough for me to buy this DVD.The movie is a disappointment but had its moments in a somewhat goofy way.Good Points:1. The story is fairly close to the book, more so than the 1953 George Pal movie which is one of my all time favorites.2. I liked the music.3. The martians and their vehicles looked very good and darn close to the descriptions written in the book.4. I laughed at one of the scenes where a person gets squashed by the machine.Bad Points:1. The movie was too long. I echo the sentiment of the observations of people just walking around from place to place.2. While the music was good, it was used quite overwhelmingly throughout the picture.3. The CGI for anything other than the martian vehicles were bad, bad, bad. Particularly the naval battle scenes off the coast of England. Those warships looked like first generation color games that I played on my Macintosh IIsi in 1992.4. If anyone is going to show this film on TV, it will probably be PBS or some arts cable channel.These are my main observations after viewing this film last night.

Also, the movie was selling at Wal-mart for $9, including sales tax so I said what the heck. There is only one word to describe this movie: HORRID.  The only redeeming quality is the director Timothy Hines makes an effort to produce an accurate portrayal of turn of the 19th century England from the women in their Victorian clothing to the uniforms of the soldiers to the 12 pounder artillery pieces. Hines tried to be cute in giving the movie a washed out tone as if this was some movie stored away and found recently although the tone is erratic from reddish , to green, to blue to no tone at all. Some of the emotional gestures reminds one of the acting one saw in early silent movies where you have the exaggerated facial expressions conveying emotions. That's about the only good things I can say about it. The acting is atrocious. Some of the scenes are funny in a bad way. For example, you see the narrator and his wife going for a walk during the day time but they are talking about the stars they see in what suppose to be a night sky. The CGI effects are so bad as if they were produced on a old Intel 486 computer. I have seen much better graphics on video games. The movie spends inordinate amount of time showing the narrator walking from point A to B in some non-descript countryside. I think if Hines shortened these walking scenes he would of cut the movie by a third from its 3 hour run time. (I watched the movie over a three day period since one would not be able to handle it on a single viewing.) The Thunderchild scene is awful. Instead of creating some mighty Victorian battleship the Thunderchild was a torpedo boat and one does not even see a single sailor on it. Its too bad the Sci-Fi channel and Masterpiece Theatre did not team up to produce an faithful version of World of the Wars. That would have been a much better production. I give it one star because it did have some pretty actresses dressed up in Victorian finery.PS: I went over the 4 and 5 star reviews and there were only 5 reviews from Amazon.com customers who wrote reviews for other items. Amazon deleted all the reviews once before because of employees from Pendragon pictures spamming the site with fake reviews. I am sure the legitimate 4 or 5 star reviews are from people with different tastes. I would recommend checking whether a review seems to be from a legitimate Amazon.com customer. I do not work for or know anybody who works for Paramount Pictures, who got pissed off Pendragon is trying to piggy back off Spielberg's WOTW. So called fans of this DVD have charged that the poor reviews are being written by Paramount Pictures as a form of payback. As a fan of Victoriana, I really wanted this movie to succeed but the poor product speaks for itself.",1,HORRID,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3046,"['am', 'sucker', 'Victorian', 'period', 'pieces', 'seeing', 'screen', 'Victorian', 'damsels', 'hats', 'lace', 'velvet', 'heart', 'go', 'putter', 'am', 'fan', 'Sci-fi', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'direct', 'video', 'production', 'two', 'staying', 'faithful', 'HG', 'Wells', 'novel', 'Also', 'movie', 'was', 'selling', 'Wal-mart', '9', 'including', 'sales', 'tax', 'so', 'said', 'what', 'heck', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'movie', 'HORRID', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'director', 'Timothy', 'Hines', 'effort', 'produce', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'turn', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'women', 'Victorian', 'clothing', 'uniforms', 'soldiers', '12', 'pounder', 'artillery', 'pieces', 'Hines', 'tried', 'be', 'cute', 'giving', 'movie', 'washed', 'out', 'tone', 'was', 'movie', 'stored', 'away', 'found', 'recently', 'tone', 'erratic', 'reddish', 'green', 'blue', 'tone', 'emotional', 'gestures', 'one', 'acting', 'one', 'saw', 'early', 'silent', 'movies', 'where', 'have', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'only', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'bad', 'way', 'example', 'see', 'narrator', 'wife', 'going', 'walk', 'day', 'time', 'are', 'talking', 'stars', 'see', 'what', 'suppose', 'be', 'night', 'sky', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'were', 'produced', 'old', 'Intel', '486', 'computer', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'graphics', 'video', 'games', 'movie', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'showing', 'narrator', 'walking', 'point', 'B', 'non-descript', 'countryside', 'think', 'Hines', 'shortened', 'walking', 'scenes', 'would', 'cut', 'movie', 'third', '3', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'three', 'day', 'period', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'single', 'viewing', 'Thunderchild', 'scene', 'awful', 'Instead', 'creating', 'mighty', 'Victorian', 'battleship', 'Thunderchild', 'was', 'torpedo', 'boat', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'single', 'sailor', 'too', 'bad', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'did', 'not', 'team', 'up', 'produce', 'faithful', 'version', 'World', 'Wars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'did', 'have', 'pretty', 'actresses', 'dressed', 'up', 'Victorian', 'finery.PS', 'went', '4', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'were', 'only', '5', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'customers', 'who', 'wrote', 'reviews', 'other', 'items', 'Amazon', 'deleted', 'reviews', 'once', 'employees', 'Pendragon', 'pictures', 'spamming', 'site', 'fake', 'reviews', 'am', 'sure', 'legitimate', '4', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'are', 'people', 'different', 'tastes', 'would', 'recommend', 'checking', 'review', 'be', 'legitimate', 'Amazon.com', 'customer', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'know', 'anybody', 'who', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'who', 'got', 'pissed', 'off', 'Pendragon', 'trying', 'piggy', 'back', 'Spielberg', 'WOTW', 'So', 'called', 'fans', 'DVD', 'have', 'charged', 'poor', 'reviews', 'are', 'being', 'written', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'form', 'payback', 'fan', 'Victoriana', 'really', 'wanted', 'movie', 'succeed', 'poor', 'product', 'speaks']",H.G.

Many of the movies coming out now a days, in trying to be loyal to their source, are getting longer.  Also, as for the color, I think a lot of that has to do with the slow appearance of the red weed and also the fact that clouds and smoke reflect red from fires and fighting, as Wells wrote about in his book.Even the tripods and Martians were not that bad looking.  But I happen to be a fan of the Thunderchild and its battle against the three war machines in the novel.  So I have to take two points away for that - that was plain bad.  No way to defend those scenes - Jeff Wayne's video game had better battleships.Only a sci-fi fan, a fan of Wells or a fan of MST3K should watch it.

All the 5 star reviews are from people who worked on the film or paid plants. Because even at only $8 at Walmart I still felt ripped off. The only reason I didn't take it back was because when I show it to other people they go CRAZY at how bad it is. The Reverend Steve at the Church of ED WOOD was quaking in his boots when he heard about this Movie, a new LOW in Cinema. I've shot 16mm features for a few grand that looked better than this DTV production. So based on my 25 years of working the very low end of the business this IS ONE OF THE WORST I seen. Why? Because they reach so high but miss the mark in all but one or two(If that) scenes. About 10 minutes of this 3 hour tale is done well and it  does not look like ANY MONEY was spent on this Tale. I'm sure they spent some money as filmmakers love to spend  $$$  and simple things that could and should be done on set were matted in at what cost and waste and I've seen $500,000 a day blown on the set of MARS ATTACKS so I cut allot of slack to indi projects but really every thing in this version screamed cheap. The FXs look as bad as 1970's THE STARLOST.  I know a guy doing FXs at home on a store bought PC that would hold their own in a STAR WARS movie so it's what skill as an artist you have not just the tools. And you have to upgrade Tim, the software your using on this WOTW looks 20 years old. My $2,000 Mac can do more than my $50,000 amiga video editor from '96.  I never made my money back on that system but  I am doing a TV show on my Mac so it all works out. Timothy Hines should try and do work he could be proud of and not lie to the public about how much his version cost and how its going to kick all the others *sses. I haven't spent any money on Tom's movie YET but I did buy your DVD Mr. Hines based on all the web buzz you created.  Good Job on that but really deep down you do you know you didn't deliver a GOOD MOVIE to us the Fans. The Jerky Frame rate was a bad idea for a 3 hour movie.  Toss out your software and upgrade with the money you made from this scam. Should people buy this movie ?  I'd say 90% of the people who I showed this to would not. The other 10% saw it for free. I've seen it 4 times. Why. Because I was offered a chance to make a cheap shot on video movie based on a famous book and after seeing this am Glad I didn't because who needs more crap like this in stores. Your movie is a great lesson on how not to make a movie...it will be my new bible of Bad ideas . There is Hollywood Hype and then there is lying . Tim is a liar, just look at all the 4 & 5 stars reviews popping up here when I've shown this to about 15 people and ALL SAID IT WAS THE WORST THING THEY EVER SAW Sure, Pump up the ratings and budget online...Guess you want to sell it to the sci-fi channel for big bucks!! Sci-fi Channel, Big Bucks lol. When we the fans look at your ""Movie"" and you tell us you spent Millions and Millions and we see 7 xtras matted into a BAD photo...right. Love how you used a store bought Jigsaw PUZZLE of a House for shots of a House being destroyed and falling apart in Puzzle shapes...Classic ED WOOD  I call  BS on you Mr. Hines.  Why mess with ED WOOD. Leave him the title of worst director of all time. Please stop faking good reviews here. I'm 43 years old and own about 4,000 movies (even 16mm prints) Your movie sucks. Your ideas suck. The ARTWORK suck. The Fake Horses sucked. The Fake xtras sucked. The Music was GOOD. Your ""Directing"" sucked. 99% of your actors sucked. The LOVE STORY sucked. The ACTION sucked. The FXs Sucked. The Stop motion sucked. Your mini-DV sucked (  I too shoot with an XL1S) The B&W footage at the start was Very GOOD but you didn't shoot it...it was PD Stock footage.

Wells' The War of the Worlds
910895,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0009PW4D2,Muzzlehatch,"[6, 9]","Sometimes artists and scientists are ahead of their times. Leonardo invented the helicopter and a new kind of realism in painting, hundreds of years before we were ready for them; some consider Shakespeare to be the first ""psychological realist"" in drama, 300 years before Freud. These two of course have been revered through the ages, but sometimes the great innovators are forgotten and only resurrected through chance or the perseverance of a few devoted followers.Such a one was Timur Hinesikoff (ca 1892-1937?) the director of the great, forgotten (until now) early sound, color and animation masterpiece The War of the Worlds, filmed in the lost community of Nonsensk, located approximately 800 km northwest of Moscow on the shores of the river Doofka, in the summers of 1929 and 1930.Hinesikoff was apparently an ethnic Latvian, born in South Africa to Marxist radical activists attempting to start a racial revolt in the early 1890s. He seems to have spent his first 6 or 7 years there before being moved to Russia as a refugee after his parents were killed in the Boer war. It is theorized that the shocks he may have experienced during that conflict, the impact of seeing his parents taken away (and possibly, seeing his father shot) before his eyes, may have formed the genesis of his preoccupations with the English socialist writer H.G. Wells and his visions of future-warfare as an adult.Taken to live in Moscow by his Russian aunt, Hinesikoff learned Russian as a second language and always maintained a proficiency in English, later learning German and French as well. His extended family were members of the intelligentsia, and his uncle Volgon was an inventor and inveterate tinkerer, probably a genius himself who certainly helped spur young Timur on in his experiments with film, sound, and color. Timur encountered such luminaries as Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Kalatozov through whom he learned the rudiments of the film language, but it would be his own inventions of the so-called ""Hinesikoff Process"" and ""Timurkolor"" that would make his name in film history.Without getting too technical, the Hinesikoff Process was an early multiplane camera system that predated Walt Disney's experiments by nearly a decade; even more novel was the inventor/filmmaker's idea to combine both animation and live action, and to film the whole in color. His Timurkolor was extremely variable in quality due to its need for optimal light conditions - the results typically show bright, almost 3-color Technicolor-type hues in bright natural light but a more artificial 2-color or sepia character in lower light conditions. He also had invented a new film type that would allow a much more seamless blend of the animated effects and the live-action footage - or so it would seem. Alas this last element was never quite perfected and thus the effects sequences in War of the Worlds at times look primitive even by 1930 standards, despite the color and the vastly superior sound.It should be noted that Hinesikoff was working off a vast fortune; despite his own parents' deeply-held Marxist/anti-capitalist beliefs and his attraction to British-style socialism, it either never occured to the filmmaker that he was only able to create his epic through the system he despised, or there was some justification he devised for it. We will likely never know; most of the director's papers seem to have vanished around the time he did, in a Stalinist purge shortly before World War II. And Hinesikoff apparently spent nearly all of his fortune acquiring the worldwide rights to Wells' bestseller and filming it.Allowances of course must be made with a film of this type, but it may help to know something of the circumstances in which it was made. Given Hinesikoff's insistance on showing the true horrors of war, and the reluctance of Stalin's government to allow him to film in or near any large city - as well as his insistence on making the film in multiple languages to reach the largest possible audience (a not-uncommon practice in the very early days of sound film), the small town of Nonsensk was chosen, and it was the only possible candidate. Nonsensk, in the late 1920s and early 1930s was an artificially created utopian city, little-known outside of the Party in the Soviet Union at the time and not at all known elsewhere; it was in fact a cosmopolitan, multilingual town made up of Marxist and Communist refugees from England, France, and the United States - mostly the latter - and it was funded as a technological experiment. Here Hinesikoff could find his actors, and build his virtual animation studio. Here also he happened to meet his composer, Jamie Hall, whose lush romantic score was reminiscent of Borodin, and his Swedish production designer Eric Nielsen, responsible for so much of the bright, unearthly and very un-English look of the piece - clearly deliberate and meant to throw the viewer off and create a sense of unease.The actors were, not surprisingly, mostly amateurs with linguistic backgrounds. As Hinesikoff was spending most of his money on his models and animation, and as this was clearly what was most important to him - the film contains an absolutely unprecedented amount of FX work, which would not be equalled in any film made anywhere until the 1990s - great dramatic ability was not always to be found or even looked for. Then, too, we must remember that the exaggerated style evident in such characters as the Writer (Anthony Piana) was more common in those immediate post-silent days - and The War of the Worlds was, in fact, the very first Soviet sound film released. More problematic to modern audiences still will be the length of the film - 3 hours - but taking a close look at what few records survive of the picture's abortive test screenings indicate that this was problematic for the early audiences as well. Hinesikoff's genius at invention and his forward-looking depiction of future-war did not, apparently, gel even in 1930 with his amateurish cast and his rather too literal screenplay.Also worth noting are the herky-jerky character of many scenes, particularly ones in which animation is involved; whether this is because they were shot silent and never quite properly synched, or because there are actual frames missing (again, not uncommon with Russian film of the period) remains unknown. In fact, for as many ways as the film points forward, and even might be considered avant-garde, in just as many it remains primitive and tied to the early sound era from which it comes - there is precious little camera movement for example, despite Hinesikoff's smaller, more mobile camera and sophisticated sound equipment.Still, some were impressed, among them the great writer of the original story himself, who soon afterwards embarked on getting many more of his ideas onto the big screen - the 1930s was a good decade for H.G. Wells indeed. And directors such as Eisenstein, Disney and Powell expressed admiration for the virtuoso effects techniques in the 10 years or so that the film remained in limited circulation; and over the succeeding years it seems that a few major filmmakers of modern times (most notably Guy Maddin and Robbie Moffat) have managed to bask in it's novelty as well. Somehow, though, by 1940 it had vanished out of general circulation, and so it remained for 65 years until the director's great-grandson, the American Timothy Hines, brought it back to life in this stunning DVD.Some cynics have actually suggested, absent proper documentation either on the disc or in any proper university or film archives, that this whole project is in fact a hoax - that there never was a Hinesikoff, that all of what I have just written was in fact made up by film scholars to discredit Mr. Hines, who unfortunately seems to believe that this is, in fact, his own work. While feeling quite sorry for Mr. Hines in his clearly problematic state, I think it quite obvious that no one, sane or not, could actually have made such a film as this in all seriousness in 2005. As a bold experiment with new technology, far ahead of its time in the between-war years, this is an extraordinary achievement; but as a film made 28 years after Star Wars? No one could make up a joke so bad as that.",5,Rediscovered Early Soviet sound/color/animation masterwork confounds audiences today,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,8255,"['Sometimes', 'artists',

910897,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B0009PW4D2,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[9, 16]","[...]In many instances, this seems to arise from a lack of understanding of what the director is up to here.  Let's be clear about this: you cannot buy a better version of War of the Worlds.Let's start, however, with the (very minor) defects in the film.  The cast is obviously enthusiastic but inexperienced.  Most of them are in their first or second films.  Their inexperience isn't helped by the fact that they're in part imitating acting conventions of the period - the last year of the 19th Century, 1900 CE.  The film is probably a little overlong - a minute under 3 hours.  However, this stems (as we will see) from a desire to do a faithful production of Wells' original story.  Computer effects (especially of buildings on fire or being blown up) are admittedly cheesy but serviceable.Unlike any other version, this War of the Worlds actually is ""War of the Worlds"".  Other versions are merely pale reflections, no matter how impressive the acting or special effects.  This version hews closely to Wells' actual narrative.  Unlike some other place that looks more impressive when it's blown up, the setting is Wells': in and near rural Woking, England (with some scenes in and near suburban London).  The Martians themselves, and their machines, are shown as Wells described them.  The Martians' vampirism is also realistically shown - although their meal is not followed by what Wells described as ""a prolonged and cheerful hooting"".  The cleverest device of the directory was to create a widescreen color film that even so had the look of having been filmed in 1900.Early film-makers were unable to rely on standard stock of celluloid, but instead used whatever film they could get.  The result was often work of uneven color quality - different shades of black, sepia, blue, and red most commonly.  Some films were even made ""color"" by hand tinting.  This film shows all those characteristics.  Some scenes appear as if shot through a blue, red, or sepia filter.  In others, the natural color is washed out to a brownish shade.  Some, shot in primarily forest or grass settings, show a shade of green typical of hand tinting.  Many viewers, clueless as to the history of film, may view these telling effects as ""defects"".Overall this version of ""War of the Worlds"" is brilliant, although the originality of its conception is hampered by an obviously limited budget.  Its length, which may seem a burden, effectively reflects Wells' leisurely approach in building to dramatic climaxes.  The result is more interesting and dramatically sound than the modern practice of constant shocks to the system.Of all versions of Wells' SF masterpiece, this is the one to own - even if you've already got Tom Cruise's (admittedly pretty good) slam-bang-slam-bang-slam-bang-can-Dakota-Fanning-scream-any-louder version.",5,The BEST,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,2818,"['[', ']', 'many', 'instances', 'arise', 'lack', 'understanding', 'what', 'director', 'up', 'here', 'Let', 'be', 'clear', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'better', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds.Let', 'start', 'however', 'very', 'minor', 'defects', 'film', 'cast', 'obviously', 'enthusiastic', 'inexperienced', 'Most', 'are', 'first', 'second', 'films', 'inexperience', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', ""'re"", 'part', 'imitating', 'acting', 'conventions', 'period', 'last', 'year', '19th', 'Century', '1900', 'CE', 'film', 'probably', 'little', 'overlong', 'minute', '3', 'hours', 'However', 'will', 'see', 'desire', 'do', 'faithful', 'production', 'Wells', 'original', 'story', 'Computer', 'effects', 'especially', 'buildings', 'fire', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'are', 'admittedly', 'cheesy', 'serviceable.Unlike', 'other', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'actually', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Other', 'versions', 'are', 'merely', 'pale', 'reflections', 'matter', 'how', 'impressive', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'version', 'closely', 'Wells', 'actual', 'narrative', 'other', 'place', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'blown', 'up', 'setting', 'Wells', 'rural', 'Woking', 'England', 'scenes', 'suburban', 'London', 'Martians', 'machines', 'are', 'shown', 'Wells', 'described', 'Martians', 'vampirism', 'also', 'realistically', 'shown', 'meal', 'not', 'followed', 'what', 'Wells', 'described', 'prolonged', 'cheerful', 'hooting', 'cleverest', 'device', 'directory', 'was', 'create', 'widescreen', 'color', 'film', 'even', 'so', 'had', 'look', 'having', 'been', 'filmed', '1900.Early', 'film-makers', 'were', 'unable', 'rely', 'standard', 'stock', 'celluloid', 'instead', 'used', 'film', 'could', 'get', 'result', 'was', 'often', 'work', 'uneven', 'color', 'quality', 'different', 'shades', 'black', 'sepia', 'blue', 'red', 'most', 'commonly', 'films', 'were', 'even', 'made', 'color', 'hand', 'tinting', 'film', 'characteristics', 'scenes', 'appear', 'shot', 'blue', 'red', 'sepia', 'filter', 'others', 'natural', 'color', 'washed', 'out', 'brownish', 'shade', 'shot', 'primarily', 'forest', 'grass', 'settings', 'show', 'shade', 'green', 'typical', 'hand', 'tinting', 'Many', 'viewers', 'clueless', 'history', 'film', 'may', 'view', 'telling', 'effects', 'defects', '.Overall', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'brilliant', 'originality', 'conception', 'hampered', 'obviously', 'limited', 'budget', 'length', 'may', 'seem', 'burden', 'effectively', 'Wells', 'leisurely', 'approach', 'building', 'dramatic', 'climaxes', 'result', 'more', 'interesting', 'dramatically', 'sound', 'modern', 'practice', 'constant', 'shocks', 'system.Of', 'versions', 'Wells', 'SF', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'own', 'even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'good', 'slam-bang-slam-bang-slam-bang-can-Dakota-Fanning-scream-any-louder', 'version']",H.G.

910898,A1SL9WA6YKDO,B0009PW4D2,Red Dragon,"[19, 23]","First, to justify my review... I have been a professional videographer/editor/ director since the late 70's. I have acted professionally (mostly stage) since the 80's. I have written scripts, some good, some bad. And like many others I have always wanted to do/see a period production of ""War of the Worlds"". Money and the difficulty in adapting the story has always been an issue.So I looked forward to the release of Hines' film with great anticipation. Finally, the film version we've all been waiting for. I was fooled by the preproduction artwork for the film on Pendragon's web site. I was expecting quality work. When this film hit dvd and not the theatre I knew it was not a good sign. I bought a copy at WalMart, once I found one where the dvd hadn't come loose inside the case. When I sat through it, well, I was sickened and sadden at this atrocity. I do not like it when someone calls all the bad reviewers ""sourpusses"". We weren't expecting ILM-quality effects, but neither were we expecting old video game sfx. If you cannot produce quality effects than stay away from film subjects that must rely on cgi. Any effects-laden film production team will/should test the cgi waters first, to make certain they can pull it off. If Hines' fx team couldn't tell that their cgi shots did not work, if they actually thought their work was good, professional visual effects, then they have no business making cgi-based films. For 'War of the Worlds' to succeed and be accepted as quality filmmaking, every part of the production MUST work.It all begins with the script. You cannot just film a novel. Adaptations are tough, but the screen writer must make choices (Even the superb 'Shogun' had artistic choices).  It is unforgivable that 45 minutes pass before the opening of the first pod in the pit. Forty-five minutes!As previously mentioned by another viewer, I did notice the motion artifacts. I would like to know the format used by Hines. In all my years of shooting video I have never seen this kind of motion effect. I don't know if it is a result of a 24p shooting mode, bad transfer, the wrong editing software or what (We're currently using Avid Xpress DV and moving up to Avid Express Pro HD, so hopefully we won't have such artifacts).Yes, the acting was over-the-top and below par in most cases, especially by the leads. The accents were passable at best, but I was floored when the artillery man mispronounced the very British ""aluminium"" as the American ""aluminum"" (note the extra ""i"" that differentiates the two). If you're doing a British film you have to pay attention to Briticisms.Special effects should be used when there is no other way of accomplishing a shot. With the bad matting artifacts from the blue/green screen composites, why use virtual sets for basic interiors? They weren't clean and the scale did not match the actors. The night sky composite with the terrible day-for-night scenes early on when the writer is pointing out Mars to his wife are ludicrous. I have never seen a night sky like this. It looked like a deep space Hubble plate. The only comment I will make about the already criticized Thunderchild sequence is, besides the poor model work, that this is supposed to be a fast, torpedo ram vessle and yet the waves made by the 'fast ship' looked like a few brush strokes in a paint program. And the crashing tripod into the waters barely created a ripple. This is supposed to be a 100 foot tall war machine!The music did have some merit but there were no developed themes; just background.The sound mix did not exist. A foley of someone running across gravel sounded as if the microphone was dragged across the ground. There were no layering of sounds. The soundtrack was too quiet, as if most of the production was shot 'mit-out-sound'.Well, I won't continue with bashing this film further. It has been done more thoroughly by so many before me. This and other negative reviews is not nit-picking. This film is nothing but nits and should be picked clean! I will conclude by urging people not to purchase this dvd. Rent it if you must. Find 10 friends and pitch in a buck, if you must. But you've read all the reviews, so be thee warned. And no, this isn't sour grapes. The fans of H.G.

Unfortunately, the film doesn't do real justice to Wells' vision. Some specifics:Tim Hines was the script writer, the photographer, the editor, and the director. This lack of any external, objective opinion may explain why the film is sooooooo long. A good editor could have trimmed the film's 180 minutes to something more manageable without losing any of the story. Near the beginning, there seem to be endlessly-repeated (identical) sequences of Anthony Piana walking back and forth along the same path through the forest. And just why did Hines feel it necessary to treat us all to an excerpt from G&S;'s ""Mikado"" in the middle of a Martian attack?The acting was marginal. The main character's ""British"" accent was really forced and unnatural. (It sounded like Keanu Reeves' sad attempt at British english in Copola's ""Dracula"".) Coupled with his pasted-on, fake-looking moustache, it was difficult to take him seriously.The film contains a lot of technical flaws. There were a number of scenes supposedly taking place at night, but which were clearly filmed in broad daylight. In a single scene, sometimes Hines would remember to use the day-for-night filter; other times not.The Martian machines were only vaguely similar to Wells' description; the Hines version looked more like giant, malevolent Sony Aibo mechanical dogs. It was also obvious that Hines used exactly the same CGI footage every time the Martian machines appeared. One of the machines makes a sudden, jerky glide from frame-right to frame-left, and sure enough it does it in every scene.Most annoying of all was the constant jumpiness of the video. Contrary to what another reviewer stated, I don't believe this is an intentional artistic choice on Hines' part. (Although that may be the spin the movie company is putting on things after the fact.) Rather, it seems to be an artifact of trying to compress three hours of video onto a single-sided DVD. The effect is like watching an internet-TV broadcast over a very slow network connection -- the frame rate just doesn't keep up. Once again, a little editting would have helped this movie's compression problems.On the positive side, I paid less than a sawbuck for this DVD at my local discount store, so I dont' feel particularly cheated.

I had thought that Roger Corman's Fantastic 4 was the worst, but this one takes the cake.  I wish that Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still on the air because this thing is a comedy gold mine!I understand low budget films, I have many in my collection.  I can forgive bad acting (with even worse accents), 'not so special' effects, and not very convincing CGI.  However no dollar amount can save a film from a director that lacks a sense of narative, the concept of tension, what a scene actually consists of, and when to edit said scenes.The movie is 180 minutes long whose bulk of time follows the main protagonist: walking through empty fields, running through empty fields, walking through the woods, stumbling through empty fields sans shirt (while falling on his back three times in the course of what feels like 10 minutes, moaning as if in labor).The director tried to go with a stylized look throughout the film using various stock video filters.  The problem is that the color of the filter would change within the same scene depending on what angle the camera was shooting at (look everything is orange, no wait now it is blue, hey its orange again!).  Another annoying artifact was that the film seems to pause for about half a second every thirty seconds or so giving the appearance of streaming video having bandwidth issues.The special effects.1) All fire in the film is computer generated, however the animation frame rate of the flames does not match the frame rate of the film.2) The Martian's heat ray isn't a ray at all, just multi colored lights that flash on the screen.  Ok, so physicall the beam would be invisible, but then how do the characters deduce that the aliens are indeed firing rays of energy?3) Heat Ray Death Scenes.  I haven't laughed this hard in a while.  The price of the DVD is worth this comedy nugget alone.  People are reduced to skeletons that are also badly rendered CGI.  How hard is it to do a skeleton?  I don't know, but if a person is zapped with a heat ray that removes all flesh and clothing, why then is the skeleton wet in appearance.  And how exactly does a skeleton writhe in agony without muscles let along a functioning brain?4) The best scene is when a tripod crashes into the 'River Thames' - the splash it creates makes any episode of Doctor Who look like Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.5) Another humorous scene is a crowd panicing in the streets of 'London'.  This was accomplished with looped CGI animation of filmed people.  In one quick scene a small group of people just disappear because their animation stopped looping!6) There is one scene of a woman singing an opera in a crowded opera house, but I have no idea why.I would say 'nice try' but I cannot.  And I am not even going to talk about British soldiers without helmets or rifles.

910904,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B0009PW4D2,Scott Kolecki,"[15, 19]","My recent purchase of the direct to DVD edition of H.G. Wells ""The War of the Worlds"" was made despite the many glaring BAD reviews this film received, even before its public release on June 14, 2005.  The purchase was made because I had been tracking the history of this film since I stumbled upon Pendragon's website late last year.  I viewed the film with a great deal of skepticism, and a very critical eye, and I hope that this review will serve readers with a balanced view of what one person thought of the film.To begin, the film follows the original novel more closely than any movie based on a Well's novel has ever done.  Much of the dialogue, settings, scenes, even small details are lifted from the original subject matter, and for that alone, Timothy Hines deserves a great deal of credit.  In addition, Hines' film comes in the advent of the collosal Paramount release expected later this year, and with the amount of controversy surrounding the legalities of this small independent film's release, it is a pleasure to have an adaptation of the story that actually adheres to Well's original novel.For fans of the original book, keep in mind that this film does depict the story accurately, and gives audiences a glimpse at the story as Well's originally envisioned it.  With that said, the balance of my comments are going to be directed at the film itself.The most glaring flaw with this film is, I am truly sorry to say, in how it was filmed.  As other reviews have indicated, this film was obviously shot before a bluescreen, with the understanding that effects could be added later.  Never is this more appearant than when viewing the several sequences when the characters are travelling either by horse-drawn carriage, or by boat (as depicted in the Thunderchild scene).  The matting is very poorly done and is very distracting when viewing the film.  In addition, many of the ""sets"" are nothing more than CGI rendered images that look cartoonish, or at best, not fully rendered. Actors are placed in the foreground in almost all cases, and the CGI world they are supposed to be integrated into looks obviously animated, which is a tragic shame, considering that so many of these images could have been shot using live action sets.Expanding on my comments about the CGI, I must also take fault with about 75% of the effects shots in this film.  To give credit where it is due, some of the sequences containing the walking machines are decent, though still-substandard to the level of effects seen in most films today.  There are points in the film where the effects are so poorly done, it is difficult to even determine what it is that we are supposed to be looking at-I.E., the sequence when the invaders are consuming an animal (presumably a cow??).  The effects do detract from the movie to such an extent that it can, at times, make the film difficult to watch with any credulity...and this is a shame, because so much effort was made to getting the story right.As for the acting...a number of comments have been made in other reviews about the quality of the performances being notably lacking.  I cannot wholly disagree with that statement, though I do give credit to the performance of the narrator, who seems to hold the story together, especially in the latter sequences of the film when he and the Curate are caught up in the demolished house.  His performance is generally pretty good. The Artilleryman too, is decent in his role, though he is only present for a small portion of the story.  Given the conditions in which this film was filmed-the lack of any real sets and the large level of blue-screening appearantly used, the characters reactions to situations and experiences are believable and generally well articulated.The most gaping hole in this film is the Thunderchild scene.  Although up to this point there are many effects sequences that are forgivable (though laughable), this sequence was horrendous.  Having never read the original novel, I had no idea that this sequences was one of the climactic moments of the story, and this film certainly does nothing to encourage that belief.  This sequence, more so than any other part of the film, is completely horrendous to watch and very poorly developed.As it is, the film does leave a lot to be desired, and for non-fans of the book, this film is probably not for you.  It is a shame, really, that it did not have the funding of a major studio production, because the film has the potential to be quite good.  As it is, I am giving it a three-star rating because it tries to bring to life one of the great science fiction stories of all time without the interference of a Hollywood re-write.  Hines's film will not be remembered in the annals of filmmaking as a great work, but it is a faithful adaptation of a story which has stood the test of time for more than 100 years.For fans of the novel, approach this with the acute understanding that what you are going to view is not an effects-driven movie.  If you are looking for a high-tech effects film, wait until the release of the Cruise/Spielberg adaptation due out later this month.  This film is one for those who want to see the story told as it was originally written, and even then, approach it with the understanding that it was created with an ambitious intent that falls way short of the mark.-Scott Kolecki",3,Flawed but Faithful Adaptation of Original Novel,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,5365,"['recent', 'purchase', 'direct', 'DVD', 'edition', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'War',

I first read Wells novel in junior high in the early 60s and was choked-up by the chapter ""The Thunder Child"". I watched this DVD with 3 friends of similar age, all of us involved with semi-pro horror and hard-boiled publishing. As a scene by scene reinactment of the actual novel, Hines has apparently decided to edit out nothing that went ""in the can"" and my suspicion is that he obtained final financing just barely adequate to complete the fx sequences. The reviews listed here seem to generally fall into bitterly divded camps- somewhat like the Republicans and Democrats here in Minnesota. I enjoyed the Spielberg film more than I expected, but have always regreted that updated versions need force-field generators to make the invaders impervious.

Tom Cruise will not appear to defeat the invaders single handedly, nor will he romance the screen siren of the month. This movie is a faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel, and, as such, maintains a quaint old-fashioned air which I found charming. There is no ultra graphic violence, no throbbing sex scences, no foul language: instead we are presented an old-fashioned, almost Victorian, approach to filmmaking which successfully brought the viewer back into the times the film purports to portray. This is somewhat akin to remaking a 1920s style film in black and white. This approach is refreshing, given the steady stream of vulgar, formulaic offal coming out of Hollywood today.I found the tale riveting. I was drawn into the plot and the plight of the very real characters. The narrator had a limited view of the totality of the war against the martians and that is what we were shown. The special effects were not Lucas quality, but they somehow fit in with the overall antiquity of the presentation. They demanded a little more imagination from the viewer (suspension of disbelief) than is normally expected these days. There were no identifiable actors in the film and this too helped draw me into the action. I was not forced to overlook that I was viewing the very familar Leo DiCaprio, for example, rather I saw the actors as believable people, caught up in an extraordinary nightmare.

Wells classic, it is the most faithful version ever made. The film is set in the late 1890s, the era when the original book depicts, not the modern-day America like two famous versions made in 1952 and 2005. The filmmakers, it is obvious, love the Well's original for director Timothy Hines co-wrote, photographed, and even edited the film.[WALK, WALK, WALK...] But the film runs for 3 hours. I couldn't believe it when I saw the words RUNTIME 180 Mins. Faithful to the book as it is, the story is so slow-moving and tedious that it bores you to death by the time you witness the aliens start to attack. What the hero of the film does is the following three - walking, talking, and crying. Sometimes he does two of them at the same time, but whatever he does, it is certain you will sleep.[AND STRANGE COLORS] The CGIs are awful, not even the same quality as the video games you can download on the net. I don't expect much from the low-budget sci-fi film, but when I watch the tripods move like a grasshopper jumping in the field, it only makes me sad. And perhaps you should remember that with extra-care and money, you can create decent images like  that of `Sky Captain.'But the worst thing is its colors. The picture is constantly tinted in various kinds of hues - at one time, it looks filtered with orange-colored film, another time, with green-colored, another with dark blue. The results are like looking a Grade Z films by Ed Wood film, in which the scenes switches between night and day. In this film, the characters seem as if soaked in blue water, then red, and so on and on, which makes me dizzy. You may think that your DVD player has been broken.But the most amazing thing about the film is that here so many reviewers have already posted their opinions about the film, which indicates that lots of people have seen it like I did before or after watching the Spielberg film. My advice is this : don't repeat what I did. I don't think Tom Cruise's version is the definite one of `The War of the Worlds,' and someone should make one with its original late-Victorian settings, but as to this one, all I can say is that for all the labor the filmmakers have invested, it is not worth your own time.",1,More Like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space': All Walking and Talking and Not Even 'So Bad So Good',1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2317,"['something', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'low-budget', 'version', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'most', 'faithful', 'version', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'set', 'late', '1890s', 'era', 'when', 'original', 'book', 'depicts', 'not', 'modern-day', 'America', 'two', 'famous', 'versions', 'made', '1952', '2005', 'filmmakers', 'obvious', 'love', 'Well', 'original', 'director', 'Timothy', 'Hines', 'co-wrote', 'photographed', 'even', 'edited', 'film', '[', 'WALK', 'WALK', 'WALK', ']', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'saw', 'words', 'RUNTIME', '180', 'Mins', 'Faithful', 'book', 'story', 'so', 'slow-moving', 'tedious', 'death', 'time', 'witness', 'aliens', 'start', 'attack', 'What', 'hero', 'film', 'following', 'three', 'walking', 'talking', 'crying', 'Sometimes', 'two', 'same', 'time', 'whatever', 'certain', 'will', 'sleep', '[', 'STRANGE', 'COLORS', ']', 'CGIs', 'are', 'awful', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'quality', 'video', 'games', 'can', 'download', 'net', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'when', 'watch', 'tripods', 'move', 'grasshopper', 'jumping', 'field', 'only', 'sad', 'perhaps', 'should', 'remember', 'extra-care', 'money', 'can', 'create', 'decent', 'images', 'Sky', 'Captain', 'worst', 'thing', 'colors', 'picture', 'constantly', 'tinted', 'various', 'kinds', 'hues', 'one', 'time', 'filtered', 'orange-colored', 'film', 'time', 'green-colored', 'dark', 'blue', 'results', 'are', 'looking', 'Grade', 'Z', 'films', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'scenes', 'switches', 'night', 'day', 'film', 'characters', 'seem', 'soaked', 'blue', 'water', 'then', 'red', 'so', 'dizzy', 'may', 'think', 'DVD', 'player', 'been', 'broken.But', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'film', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'posted', 'opinions', 'film', 'lots', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'did', 'watching', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'version', 'definite', 'one', 'War', 'Worlds', 'someone', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'original', 'late-Victorian', 'settings', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'labor', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'invested', 'not', 'worth', 'own', 'time']",H.G.

I looked at a fair number of these, and they were pretty much on the mark: a) yes, it is closest to Wells' novel; but, b) it is excruciatingly long and repetitious; c) has terrible acting; and d) has atrocious editing of scenes. The heat ray and striding machines are interesting ... but very crude by today's standards ... or maybe even so when the movie was made. The directors made a special effort to have everyone speak with some sort of a British accent. This was reasonably convincing. (Since the movie was made in the US, where did they get all these actors.)The Martians with their spindly tentacles could never support themselves in earth's 3x greater gravity. Also, why the huge eyes? Are they nocturnal? But these quirks may be traceable back to Wells himself. The music score was pretty good ... and seems to be strongly influenced by the first part of the Russian folk song ""Polyushka."" (Coincidence?)So why are there so many reviews?
