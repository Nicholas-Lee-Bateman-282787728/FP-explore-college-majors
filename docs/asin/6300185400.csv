Although the 2 main characters are very likeable and their acting is good, the disco-type music in this so-called scary movie was just annoying.  I also found the 'love-scene type' music very inappropriate.  The type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more.  I was hoping for a 'haunted house' theme in this movie and it just didn't deliver.  I will give this movie 2 stars because I liked the 2 main characters.

The movie is packed with seasoned actors. The story is just as spooky as any scary movie and the plot is revealed in little doses as the protagonists are slowly eliminated.

The book is sadly out of print, but I'd recommend it as a definite read for fans of such things. It launched his career and despite the obvious limitations put upon him, Coyne did an excellent job. Now that I'm done telling you to read the book, on with the review for the film.This is very much worth checking out if you're a fan of slow horror films. This isn't a particularly scary movie, but then it isn't really supposed to be. You won't be gasping for air at any point and you won't find any true jump scares here. If that's what you're looking for, then you might want to either skip this or approach it with caution. For those who like movies that take time to build up, this is probably more up your alley.The acting really is what drives this film, as is the onscreen chemistry between Ross and Elliott. This is the film that sparked their entire relationship and it shows. Their attraction really does help the movie out, as much of the film's story line surrounds Elliott's character trying to figure out what's going on and stay around Ross's character. The acting of the whole ensemble is nice, but Ross and Elliott really are the two main figures. Of course, we also have other stars in the film, such as The Who's Roger Daltrey (who does an excellent job) and RHPS's Charles Grey (who acts decently in this).The story? The story is also good. It's rather straightforward and simple when you get down to it, which works in its favor when you figure that the main gist of the movie is that you're watching people get picked off one by one. There's more to it than that, of course, but I like that the movie writers didn't try to make this too overly complicated.DVD bonuses? There are none. This is pretty much a bare bones set where you get a trailer and that's about it. I do have to say that I'm glad that they included English subtitles, as not every older movie actually gets those. They're big too- not so much that they ruin the movie but big enough that you won't worry about missing them.It's just a shame that this film is as obscure as it is. It really deserves more of a cult following than it currently has. I'd definitely recommend this as a late night movie or as something to watch on Halloween inbetween the slasher and jump scare flicks. That it shows Sam Elliott's bare backside as well as him taking a shower is just a bonus.",4,Slow atmospheric film,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2465,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'meaning', 'pick', 'up', 'read', 'liked', 'movie', 'novelization', 'put', 'out', 'Coyne', 'book', 'sadly', 'print', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'definite', 'read', 'fans', 'such', 'things', 'launched', 'career', 'obvious', 'limitations', 'put', 'Coyne', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Now', ""'m"", 'done', 'telling', 'read', 'book', 'review', 'film.This', 'very', 'much', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'slow', 'horror', 'films', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'scary', 'movie', 'then', ""n't"", 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'gasping', 'air', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'true', 'jump', 'scares', 'here', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'approach', 'caution', 'who', 'like', 'movies', 'take', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'probably', 'more', 'up', 'alley.The', 'acting', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Ross', 'Elliott', 'film', 'sparked', 'entire', 'relationship', 'attraction', 'really', 'help', 'movie', 'out', 'much', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'Elliott', 'character', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'stay', 'Ross', 'character', 'acting', 'whole', 'ensemble', 'nice', 'Ross', 'Elliott', 'really', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'figures', 'course', 'also', 'have', 'other', 'stars', 'film', 'such', 'Who', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'who', 'excellent', 'job', 'RHPS', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'who', 'decently', '.The', 'story', 'story', 'also', 'good', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'simple', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'favor', 'when', 'figure', 'main', 'gist', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'people', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'more', 'course', 'like', 'movie', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'too', 'overly', 'complicated.DVD', 'bonuses', 'are', 'none', 'pretty', 'much', 'bare', 'bones', 'set', 'where', 'get', 'trailer', 'do', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'included', 'English', 'subtitles', 'not', 'older', 'movie', 'actually', ""'re"", 'big', 'too-', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ruin', 'movie', 'big', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'worry', 'missing', 'them.It', 'just', 'shame', 'film', 'as', 'obscure', 'really', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'currently', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'late', 'night', 'movie', 'something', 'watch', 'Halloween', 'inbetween', 'slasher', 'jump', 'scare', 'flicks', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'bare', 'backside', 'as', 'well', 'taking', 'shower', 'just', 'bonus']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","In 1939 mystery novelist Agatha Christie created AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the tense story of ten people cut off from the rest of the world and being preyed upon, one after another, by a killer they cannot identify.  It was a revolutionary idea, and it has inspired so many novels, plays, and movies that it is impossible to count them all.  The novel's influence is distinctly noticeable in this 1979 film, especially in the fact that many characters are discovered to be murderers who got away with it.  Yes, this is more or less the same story--but with devil worshipers.  You read that correctly.  Devil worshipers.Maggie and Pete (Katherine Ross and Sam Elliot) are American designers who have been lured to England by Lord Mountolive, and who find themselves trapped at his estate with five others.  Accidents begin to follow in rapid order, and Maggie is soon brought before Mountolive to receive a special ring that is pressed upon her finger and which she cannot remove.  Still more accidents follow, and it becomes apparent that these are not accidents at all.  Indeed, innocent Maggie is trapped in a battle with the other ring-wearers, a battle to be the last survivor and the heir to Mountolive's legacy.The movie is somewhat stylish, and it does have moments.  Unfortunately, it is also slow and the script is extremely uneven.  Even so, Ross and Elliot are an astonishingly attractive couple, and the supporting cast--most particularly Margaret Tyzack as Nurse Adams--is quite good.  The film is also notable for Roger Daltrey of The Who, appearing as Clive Jackson.  I saw the film when it was on the big screen in 1979, and at the time it had considerable ""ick"" factor; these days, however, it reads as middling-to-mild, and the film has acquired a certain camp quality.

This movie also fashions a ""who dunnit"" like mystery although it is quite easy to determine who the killer is.  Also, ""The Legacy"" sports a great score to present the mood and theme of the horror quite well.Overall, ""The Legacy"" isn't really scary but there are some creepy elements to it...the atmosphere is chilling and the incredibly evil power behind the deaths of these guests provides the audience with a plausible and genuine supernatural villain that inspires a small degree of terror in the audience.""The Legacy"" is a nice little chiller with a good plot and very good acting.  I was very impressed with both Ross and Elliot in this movie...they really make it work very nicely.  Also, the woman that played ""Adams"" does a great job and she is very creepy as ""the nurse"" with a cat like demeanor.  Adams is thoroughly evil and unstoppable...she's a real treat to watch and adds a lot to the movie in my opinion.I give ""The Legacy"" THREE STARS as a horror flick and while it is not too scary, it really does present supernatural evil to the audience in the ""right way"" that allows for a convincing and credible horror movie.  ""The Legacy"" is about the legacy of satan's power and that is an interesting idea, BUT that being said, the plot fails to explain how this legacy was able to come about...still, the movie is quite entertaining as long as you don't over scrutinize the obvious holes in the plot.  Also, there are some good kills in this movie.All and all, ""The Legacy"" is a pretty good little horror flick...I just wish that it was scarier and that more was explained.  Ultimately, I think this movie would have worked better and would have been more credible to the sophisticated horror movie fan if the inheritance was a demon's power and not that of satan himself.The transfer of this movie to DVD is very well done and the audio is average.",3,Very Interesting and unique horror flick...GREAT acting too!!!,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,3013,"['Legacy', 'interesting', 'unique', 'horror', 'flick', 'place', 'England', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'star', 'flick', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'plot', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'job', 'possibility', 'England', 'boyfriend', 'going', 'abroad', 'fun', 'nothing', 'else', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'Ms.', 'Walsh', 'inherit', 'gift', 'sorts', 'can', 'call', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'would', 'ruin', 'plot', 'hole', 'two', 'plot', 'will', 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'Still', 'Legacy', 'quite', 'effective', 'essential', 'purpose', 'supernatural', 'evil', 'horror', 'flick.The', 'couple', 'have', 'bike', 'accident', 'strange', 'man', 'house', 'can', 'wait', 'get', 'bike', 'fixed', 'However', 'Pete', 'Katherine', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'leave', 'house', 'foul', 'play', 'afoot', 'other', 'guests', 'begin', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'strong', 'interesting', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'scenes', 'actually', 'were.Basically', 'couple', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'leave', 'evil', 'house', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'movie', 'also', 'who', 'dunnit', 'mystery', 'quite', 'easy', 'determine', 'who', 'killer', 'Also', 'Legacy', 'sports', 'great', 'score', 'present', 'mood', 'theme', 'horror', 'quite', 'well.Overall', 'Legacy', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'are', 'creepy', 'elements', 'atmosphere', 'chilling', 'incredibly', 'evil', 'power', 'deaths', 'guests', 'audience', 'plausible', 'genuine', 'supernatural', 'villain', 'small', 'degree', 'terror', 'audience', 'Legacy', 'nice', 'little', 'chiller', 'good', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Ross', 'Elliot', 'movie', 'really', 'make', 'work', 'very', 'nicely', 'Also', 'woman', 'played', 'Adams', 'great', 'job', 'very', 'creepy', 'nurse', 'cat', 'demeanor', 'Adams', 'thoroughly', 'evil', 'unstoppable', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'lot', 'movie', 'opinion.I', 'give', 'Legacy', 'THREE', 'STARS', 'horror', 'flick', 'not', 'too', 'scary', 'really', 'present', 'supernatural', 'evil', 'audience', 'right', 'way', 'convincing', 'credible', 'horror', 'movie', 'Legacy', 'legacy', 'satan', 'power', 'interesting', 'idea', 'BUT', 'being', 'said', 'plot', 'explain', 'how', 'legacy', 'was', 'able', 'come', 'still', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'over', 'scrutinize', 'obvious', 'holes', 'plot', 'Also', 'are', 'good', 'kills', 'movie.All', 'Legacy', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'scarier', 'more', 'was', 'explained', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'credible', 'sophisticated', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'inheritance', 'was', 'demon', 'power', 'not', 'satan', 'himself.The', 'transfer', 'movie', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'audio', 'average']",N/A

For those who love Sam Elliott, this movie is a beautiful (and unusual) landscape for his rugged features to be painted against.  So much of his history now is written from the back of a horse, thick in dust and two weeks' shy of a shave.  Nothing wrong with that, it's why I love him, but this movie had me atypically smiling through-out the length of it.  He could have come out so different if that had been his goal.  Instead he stayed close to home, close to his wife and doing movies he understood the ethics of - and for those choices we can do nothing but respect him.The DVD itself was flawless, the colors unpredictably good for something shot in the 70s, (in England) and the sound quality as good or better than anything I've watched from that time.Don't watch it for the horror.

""filmfan3""","[1, 1]","I love occult thrillers, and I read about this film on a movie fansite, so I bought the DVD based on the reviews of a lot of serious horror fans. This is a real 1970s movie, with the cheesy soundtrack and the funny hair and clothes of my youth, but the story is fun. A rich old British man lies dying in his country manor, and the heirs have been summoned--including an American distant relative (Katharine Ross). But the Last Will and Testament has a catch--a deadly catch--and the supernatural murders begin. The cast includes a lot of good Brit stage actors (John Standing, Charles Gray, and the wonderful Margaret Tyzack), as well as rock icon Roger Daltrey(!). It's a pretty familiar story, and you'll even recognize the big country house from a million other movies and TV shows. But there's a nice, creepy vibe to it, and Richard Marquand (EYE OF THE NEEDLE, RETURN OF THE JEDI, JAGGED EDGE) is a good, solid director who makes it a fun popcorn scare-fest.

I have the book & liked it. Was just as good turned into a movie & the 2 main charters make it interesting. The best part is when she is taken into the room with the old man & he grabs her hand & puts the ring on her finger & she can't get it off.
