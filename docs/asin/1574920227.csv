190997,A2582KMXLK2P06,1574920227,B. E Jackson,"[3, 4]","A storyline such as the one featured in Oleanna is *definitely* an acquired taste.  There's no other way to look at it.What you have is a college professor and his female student CONSTANTLY arguing with each other in dark and dreary college rooms throughout the entire movie.  What are they arguing about, you ask?  Several things.One of them being the fact the female student is having a ton of trouble understanding and grasping the teachers lecture, and as a result, the girl believes her college course feels like a big waste of time.She apparently takes it VERY personally that she doesn't seem to understand a single word that the teacher is saying during class time, which is what seemingly made her so upset that she felt the need to confront the teacher about it at the end of the day.After a while (like over an hour of painfully overbearing bickering) the discussion finally turns to sexual harrassment and what the female student believes the professor did to her personally on one occasion (which prompted the girl to run out of the room screaming with people in the hallways hearing about what supposedly just took place).  Talk about *extremely* awkward how the storyline went in *this* direction out of left field.However, I'm glad it DID go in this direction.  Now that a sexual harrassment case enters into the mix, the arguments that take place between the female student and her teacher are more heated and interesting.I don't feel the storyline is nearly as clever or interesting as many viewers do.  Other awkward moments took place such as the professors wife constantly calling him up on the phone because the two of them are planning to buy a house and are having some problems, and therefore interrupting the many, many discussions taking place between the professor and his female student.  It got REALLY annoying when an hour later the frequent phone calls were *still* happening.Sure, the ending is good (and a bit surprising) but it's not enough to save the film.  Expect a lot of boredom over the course of its running time, but who knows- maybe you'll get something more worthwhile out of it than I did.",2,unappealing to me,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,2135,"['storyline', 'such', 'one', 'featured', 'Oleanna', '*definitely*', 'acquired', 'taste', 'other', 'way', 'look', 'it.What', 'have', 'college', 'professor', 'female', 'student', 'CONSTANTLY', 'arguing', 'other', 'dark', 'dreary', 'college', 'rooms', 'entire', 'movie', 'What', 'are', 'arguing', 'ask', 'Several', 'things.One', 'being', 'fact', 'female', 'student', 'having', 'ton', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'grasping', 'teachers', 'lecture', 'result', 'girl', 'college', 'course', 'feels', 'big', 'waste', 'time.She', 'apparently', 'VERY', 'personally', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'single', 'word', 'teacher', 'saying', 'class', 'time', 'what', 'seemingly', 'made', 'so', 'upset', 'felt', 'need', 'confront', 'teacher', 'end', 'day.After', 'while', 'hour', 'painfully', 'overbearing', 'bickering', 'discussion', 'finally', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'what', 'female', 'student', 'professor', 'did', 'personally', 'one', 'occasion', 'prompted', 'girl', 'run', 'out', 'room', 'screaming', 'people', 'hallways', 'hearing', 'what', 'supposedly', 'just', 'took', 'place', 'Talk', '*extremely*', 'awkward', 'how', 'storyline', 'went', '*this*', 'direction', 'left', 'field.However', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DID', 'go', 'direction', 'Now', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'case', 'mix', 'arguments', 'take', 'place', 'female', 'student', 'teacher', 'are', 'more', 'heated', 'interesting.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'storyline', 'nearly', 'as', 'clever', 'interesting', 'many', 'viewers', 'do', 'Other', 'awkward', 'moments', 'took', 'place', 'such', 'professors', 'wife', 'constantly', 'calling', 'up', 'phone', 'two', 'are', 'planning', 'buy', 'house', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'therefore', 'interrupting', 'many', 'many', 'discussions', 'taking', 'place', 'professor', 'female', 'student', 'got', 'REALLY', 'annoying', 'when', 'hour', 'later', 'frequent', 'phone', 'calls', 'were', '*still*', 'happening.Sure', 'ending', 'good', 'bit', 'surprising', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'Expect', 'lot', 'boredom', 'course', 'running', 'time', 'who', 'knows-', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'did']",N/A

Freeman,"[4, 5]","Funny, only one other reviewer here noticed, or had the guts, to state the obvious: the girl in this movie is OBVIOUSLY delusional and in need of psychotherapy. But I digress...Alright, here's the truth about this movie. The always-great Macy plays a middle-aged college professor who offers help to one of his failing students, in this case a young woman with CLEAR psychological problems. The student in question blows a simple misunderstanding into a full blown sexual harassment charge aimed at destroying the professor, which in turn would mean losing his hard-earned tenure. Any NORMAL woman would CLEARLY have seen the misunderstanding for what it was: A MISUNDERSTANDING, and consequently drop the matter entirely. Not so the student-from-hell in this film. She not only misconstrues the professors intentions, she goes on a personal vendetta with the single-minded purpose of a shark hunting a baby seal (only the shark is more intelligent), whereas the girl comes accross as a moron with schizo-affective disorder. She tries to completely and utterly destroy the man.Just when you think it couldn't possibly get any better, things go from bad to worse. What happens next could only take place in the mind of someone in desperate need of thorazine: She accuses the professor of RAPING her.Can you say 'nut case' boys and girls?I enjoyed this movie only because of Macy, who in my opinion is one of the most underrated actors of our times. However the movie is a bit unrealistic in that most men would have either walked away from this girl completely, told one of their peers about it soon enough to make others aware of the situation, OR - and this is what most men would have done if it came to the same point as it did in the movie.

191001,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1574920227,Dennis Littrell,"[21, 28]","David Mamet, the Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning author of the Broadway and later cinematic masterpiece, Glengarry Glen Ross, and other works, wrote and directed this artistic and quasi-realistic look at the gender wars.  It starts out so slow that I almost gave up on it in the middle of the second reel (or actually in the middle of what would be the second act-it's adapted from his play) but I am surely glad I held on as it gathered momentum and power.  It's about a college professor and a student who accuses him of sexual harassment.  He's weak willed and likes his position and she's a ball-breaker who projects her desire for him by attacking him.  He doesn't see the danger until it's too late.William H. Macy, lately seen as the fifties TV husband in Pleasantville (1998) and before that as the murderous car salesman in Fargo (1996), plays the pompous professor while Debra Eisenstadt is the unpleasant student looking to hurt.  The dialogue is repetitious and purposely banal in an attempt to imitate actual speech.  If you've never seen or read a Mamet play, his unique and highly characteristic style may startle you.  What he tries to do with the repetition and the indirection is to imitate and burlesque the manner of normal speech.  He effort is less successful here, in fact annoying at times, partly because Macy's unique acting style is almost a natural parody of misdirection and obtuseness.  Taken together perhaps we have overkill.  Nonetheless, this is fascinating to watch.  People do talk at cross purposes and practice miss-communication.  The tension, once developed, is maintained throughout because we can't decide whose side we're on.  Both characters are purposely unsympathetic, and both compromised because of their personality weaknesses.Mamet is a master at exposing human hypocrisy and ulterior motivation.  We can see that the professor is in fact innocent of sexual harassment, but entirely guilty in his heart, while the unattractive girl although lying and out to hurt has been devalued by our society to the point of self hatred.  They are unsympathetic, yet we can, through them, if we are honest with ourselves, catch a glimpse of our own compromised nature.  They are out to abuse or hurt one another because of established character defects.  The lecher leches to control and to prove his masculinity, while the harassed &quot;victim&quot; seeks some attention to spice up her dreary life.",4,Classic Mamet,978220800,"12 31, 2000",2000,2438,"['David', 'Mamet', 'Tony', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'author', 'Broadway', 'later', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'other', 'works', 'wrote', 'directed', 'artistic', 'quasi-realistic', 'look', 'gender', 'wars', 'out', 'so', 'slow', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'middle', 'second', 'reel', 'actually', 'middle', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'second', 'act-it', 'adapted', 'play', 'am', 'surely', 'glad', 'held', 'gathered', 'momentum', 'power', 'college', 'professor', 'student', 'who', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'weak', 'willed', 'position', 'ball-breaker', 'who', 'projects', 'desire', 'attacking', ""n't"", 'see', 'danger', 'too', 'late.William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'lately', 'seen', 'fifties', 'TV', 'husband', 'Pleasantville', '1998', 'before', 'murderous', 'car', 'salesman', 'Fargo', '1996', 'pompous', 'professor', 'Debra', 'Eisenstadt', 'unpleasant', 'student', 'looking', 'hurt', 'dialogue', 'repetitious', 'purposely', 'banal', 'attempt', 'imitate', 'actual', 'speech', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'read', 'Mamet', 'play', 'unique', 'highly', 'characteristic', 'style', 'may', 'startle', 'What', 'do', 'repetition', 'indirection', 'imitate', 'burlesque', 'manner', 'normal', 'speech', 'effort', 'less', 'successful', 'here', 'fact', 'annoying', 'times', 'partly', 'Macy', 'unique', 'acting', 'style', 'almost', 'natural', 'parody', 'misdirection', 'obtuseness', 'Taken', 'together', 'perhaps', 'have', 'overkill', 'Nonetheless', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'People', 'do', 'talk', 'cross', 'purposes', 'practice', 'miss-communication', 'tension', 'once', 'developed', 'maintained', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'side', ""'re"", 'characters', 'are', 'purposely', 'unsympathetic', 'compromised', 'personality', 'weaknesses.Mamet', 'master', 'exposing', 'human', 'hypocrisy', 'ulterior', 'motivation', 'can', 'see', 'professor', 'fact', 'innocent', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'entirely', 'guilty', 'heart', 'unattractive', 'girl', 'lying', 'hurt', 'been', 'devalued', 'society', 'point', 'self', 'hatred', 'are', 'unsympathetic', 'yet', 'can', 'are', 'honest', 'ourselves', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'own', 'compromised', 'nature', 'are', 'abuse', 'hurt', 'one', 'established', 'character', 'defects', 'lecher', 'control', 'prove', 'masculinity', 'harassed', 'quot', 'victim', 'quot', 'attention', 'spice', 'up', 'dreary', 'life']",N/A
191002,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,1574920227,Erik Bateson,"[3, 3]","David Mamet's Oleanna, named after a Norwegian folk song that mocked the idea of a utopia, is a tense, tense movie. I haven't been so uncomfortable watching a movie in a long time. After watching it a second time, I especially noticed the girl's compulsive taking of notes, recording John's (William H. Macy's) talk about his son having to go to a public school as ""the white man's burden."" He tells her that she doesn't need to take notes, but she tells him that she ""want to remember."" This means something different the second time around, as the viewer knows the aftermath of her analysis. I think that she misinterprets his willingness to help her; germane statements such as, ""I like you"" delivered in non-suggestive tones are taken in the most aggressive way possible; his openness and her naivet&eacute; are a lethal combination.The play was inspired by the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy and its aftermath. Unlike that case, where the question was, ""Did he do what she alleged?,"" the question in this work is, ""Did what he undeniably did constitute sexual harassment?"" He would say yes, she would say no.I think that your appreciation of this film is partially influenced by your ideology: If you generally agree with feminism, you're more apt to take the girl's side, and if you generally disagree with feminism, you're more likely to take the guy's side. I think that David Mamet wants us to side with Carol for the first act (she just wants help, and he's being difficult), side with John for the second act (he's about to lose his house, his tenure, and his reputation over trivial matters), and make up our own mind in the third act. On the cover of the dvd, it says, ""Either one you side with, you're wrong,"" suggesting that it's easier to make a case against either person in this film than for them. In this sense, instead of having a traditional protagonist and complementary antagonists, the play doubles up on antagonists, and skips the ""good guy"" part (I apologize for saying ""good guy."" I should have said ""person of a non-specific gender with quality."").While Glengarry Glen Ross or American Buffalo may inundate the viewer with certain four-letter words, Oleanna's strong language comes from other four-letter words-rape, baby (""and don't call your wife baby!""), etc. You will either love it or hate it; I loved it.",4,Excellent,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2347,"['David', 'Mamet', 'Oleanna', 'named', 'Norwegian', 'folk', 'song', 'mocked', 'idea', 'utopia', 'tense', 'tense', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'especially', 'noticed', 'girl', 'compulsive', 'taking', 'notes', 'recording', 'John', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'talk', 'son', 'having', 'go', 'public', 'school', 'white', 'man', 'burden', ""n't"", 'need', 'take', 'notes', 'want', 'remember', 'something', 'different', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'viewer', 'aftermath', 'analysis', 'think', 'willingness', 'help', 'germane', 'statements', 'such', 'like', 'delivered', 'non-suggestive', 'tones', 'are', 'taken', 'most', 'aggressive', 'way', 'possible', 'openness', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'are', 'lethal', 'combination.The', 'play', 'was', 'inspired', 'Clarence', 'Thomas/Anita', 'Hill', 'controversy', 'aftermath', 'case', 'where', 'question', 'was', 'Did', 'do', 'what', 'alleged', 'question', 'work', 'Did', 'what', 'undeniably', 'did', 'constitute', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'would', 'say', 'no.I', 'think', 'appreciation', 'film', 'partially', 'influenced', 'ideology', 'generally', 'agree', 'feminism', ""'re"", 'more', 'apt', 'take', 'girl', 'side', 'generally', 'disagree', 'feminism', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'take', 'guy', 'side', 'think', 'David', 'Mamet', 'side', 'Carol', 'first', 'act', 'just', 'help', 'being', 'difficult', 'side', 'John', 'second', 'act', 'lose', 'house', 'tenure', 'reputation', 'trivial', 'matters', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'third', 'act', 'cover', 'dvd', 'one', 'side', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'suggesting', 'easier', 'make', 'case', 'person', 'film', 'sense', 'instead', 'having', 'traditional', 'protagonist', 'complementary', 'antagonists', 'play', 'up', 'antagonists', 'good', 'guy', 'part', 'apologize', 'saying', 'good', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'person', 'non-specific', 'gender', 'quality', '.While', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'American', 'Buffalo', 'may', 'inundate', 'viewer', 'certain', 'four-letter', 'words', 'Oleanna', 'strong', 'language', 'other', 'four-letter', 'words-rape', 'baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'wife', 'baby', 'etc', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'loved']",N/A
191003,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,1574920227,Evelina,"[5, 6]","Oleanna is the revenge of the non liberal against the liberal. The non liberal takes the tools provided by the liberal and uses them to destroy the liberal.The woman keeps on repeating how hard she and others had to work to get into college and how hard it is for them to stay there. They had to struggle and sacrifice. She gets into college and goes to class. She has been taught all her life how important education is and how higher education is the ticket to many excellent things in life. She sits in the classroom and the instructor tells her it is all nonsense and that higher education is a travesty and it is like a stupid fraternity ritual, some hazing ritual. He is the professor and he seems to despise what he does and what he has dedicated his working life to.Some understand why the man takes this attitude. It is part of the liberal contempt for the United States and for the entire western world. The premise is this - that all of that is worthless and stupid, that although all of the west is bad, the US is the worst, that everything that the conventional minded seem to value, such as higher education, is a joke. Yet at the same time, it must be pursued. Education is important and so is a nice upper middle class lifestyle. Yet it is all nonsense. Anyone who suggests otherwise or who notes the contradictions is regarded as stupid, as not with it, as not cool. Such a person does not get it.The woman does not get it. Why does the teacher affect to despise his work? Why does he stand in front of students and express disgust for the institution that employs him and the entire system it is a part of? She is prepared to study and learn. She does not understand how she is supposed to study and learn and at the same time regard the whole thing as a joke.The man is not entirely consistent. As a good academic, he parrots the usual line. Yet he values the book that he wrote. He has pride in it. He wants his son to be proud of him. Not only that but his values appear to be solid bourgeois values. He is buying a nice new house. He wants a promotion and more money. This in turn is even more puzzling to the woman. What is he about exactly?The man is nice. He tries to explain to her what it all means. But he can't. She cannot understand how these things are important and at the same time worthless. She asks him repeatedly, what does he mean when he says that a college education is the same as a stupid hazing in a fraternity (full of mindless frat boys, one presumes.)  How is she supposed to take school seriously and yet at the same time not take it seriously? If what he says is true, then what all they all doing there? How can it all be nonsense?As a nice man, the professor tries to help her. If she accepted his help and learned to parrot the usual line, she would have been okay and so would he. But she remains genuinely bewildered. The man, though kind, never understands her. He never understands what she is asking, although she asks it explicitly. She is very open. So is he. But they are speaking different languages. This is the truth that he cannot tell her because he cannot acknowledge it himself. The group to which I belong has the rule that we must express contempt for everything in our culture. At the same time, we must value it enough to act by its rules and garner the rewards it offers. We must express disgust for such things as big new houses as evidence of mindless American materialism.  Yet at the same time, we must buy and live in such houses.But she gets her revenge for his opacity. She takes the liberal thinking and uses it to destroy him. He thinks he is a critique of culture. She will show him what a critique really is. She will show him how every word out of his mouth, every gesture of his hand, every thought in his head is in the service of the evil oppressor. She will show him how just one word of hers, just one accusation that he oppressed her can destroy him. She needs no proof.  In the liberal system which he accepts without even thinking about it, proof is not needed. All it takes is one word of hers. She out liberals him to the point of telling him how he can address his wife. She gets drunk with her power over him. ""Don't call your wife baby.""

In the case of OLEANNA, the answer would be &quot;not very much at all.&quot;  It is, as others have noted, still very much stagebound.  Like the female student, we feel virtually confined to the professor's office.  Theatergoers have to accept such conventions as a (usually) necessary theatrical limitation.  But in the context of a film, it becomes almost unbearably claustrophobic.And I see from reading other reviewers' comments, that I'm hardly alone in finding the dialog too mannered. For long stretches at a time, the two protagonists (well, actually, antagonists) do nothing by interrupt each other.  Some interruption makes for a more natural representation of actual conversation, but when neither character actually gets to complete an entire sentence, it is anything but natural.  It's just irritating.  Mamet, who reportedly writes to a metronome, should probably have turned the darn thing off this time out.And of course there's that constantly ringing telephone.  That would likely have driven me nuts even as a theatrical device.  On film it's too much.Mamet is always interesting enough to make almost any of his projects worth watching (at least once).  And William H. Macy is his reliably quirky self.  The quintessential character actor, he shines when given the lead role.  Despite the mannered dialog, he is able to plumb his character's proverbial depths and create a fascinating portrait of a tortured academic, whose ambition, though very real, is hampered by nagging self-doubt (to say nothing of his doubts regarding his chosen profession).Debra Eisenstadt as his student antagonist doesn't have as rich a palette to work with.  Her character goes from insecure, diffident student, somewhat in awe of her brilliant professor, to near militant, bent on the personal destruction of her former instructor.  The actual transition seems to have been made deliberately vague.  She seems to have fallen under the influence of an unidentified but apparently quite militant &quot;group&quot; and finds some new strength and a sense of identity therein.  With a moral certitude unique to the very young, she has no qualms about sacrificing her professor's life and career on the altar of &quot;political correctness.&quot;Which brings up the subject of the film's &quot;message.&quot;  The film's tagline is &quot;Whatever side you take, you're wrong.&quot;  And that simply is not true.  As riddled with self-doubt as the professor is, he is clearly the more sympathetic character.  Yes, both &quot;sides&quot; are aired, but it is clear almost as soon as the nature of the conflict is articulated, that the tortured but intellectually honest professor doesn't stand a chance against the newfound black-and-white worldview of the &quot;true believer&quot; student.All of this conflict could have made for gripping cinema.  What you actually are likely to come away with is that &quot;hmmm-it-probably-worked-onstage&quot; feeling.  And that's too bad.  Given the potentially incendiary subject matter, it really should have been a better film.",3,Just Makes the Grade,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,3567,"['always', 'been', 'puzzle', 'why', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'stage', 'plays', 'work', 'just', 'fine', 'others', 'fail', 'miserably', 'Lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'fair', 'number', 'not', 'sole', 'purpose', 'answering', 'question', 'mind', 'just', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'Good', 'thing', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'hellbent', 'resolving', 'issue', ""'m"", 'closer', 'answer', 'now', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'can', 'talk', 'how', 'successfully', 'play', 'been', 'quot', 'opened', 'up', 'quot', 'screen', 'case', 'OLEANNA', 'answer', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'all.', 'quot', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'stagebound', 'female', 'student', 'feel', 'virtually', 'confined', 'professor', 'office', 'Theatergoers', 'have', 'accept', 'such', 'conventions', 'usually', 'necessary', 'theatrical', 'limitation', 'context', 'film', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'claustrophobic.And', 'see', 'reading', 'other', 'reviewers', 'comments', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'alone', 'finding', 'dialog', 'too', 'mannered', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'two', 'protagonists', 'well', 'actually', 'antagonists', 'do', 'nothing', 'interrupt', 'other', 'interruption', 'more', 'natural', 'representation', 'actual', 'conversation', 'when', 'character', 'actually', 'complete', 'entire', 'sentence', 'anything', 'natural', 'just', 'irritating', 'Mamet', 'who', 'reportedly', 'metronome', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'turned', 'darn', 'thing', 'time', 'out.And', 'course', 'constantly', 'ringing', 'telephone', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'driven', 'nuts', 'even', 'theatrical', 'device', 'film', 'too', 'much.Mamet', 'always', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'almost', 'projects', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'reliably', 'quirky', 'self', 'quintessential', 'character', 'actor', 'when', 'given', 'lead', 'role', 'mannered', 'dialog', 'able', 'plumb', 'character', 'proverbial', 'depths', 'create', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'tortured', 'academic', 'ambition', 'though', 'very', 'real', 'hampered', 'nagging', 'self-doubt', 'say', 'nothing', 'doubts', 'regarding', 'chosen', 'profession', 'Eisenstadt', 'student', 'antagonist', ""n't"", 'have', 'rich', 'palette', 'work', 'character', 'insecure', 'diffident', 'student', 'somewhat', 'awe', 'brilliant', 'professor', 'near', 'militant', 'bent', 'personal', 'destruction', 'former', 'instructor', 'actual', 'transition', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'deliberately', 'vague', 'have', 'fallen', 'influence', 'unidentified', 'apparently', 'quite', 'militant', 'quot', 'group', 'quot', 'new', 'strength', 'sense', 'identity', 'therein', 'moral', 'certitude', 'unique', 'very', 'young', 'qualms', 'sacrificing', 'professor', 'life', 'career', 'altar', 'quot', 'political', 'correctness.', 'quot', 'up', 'subject', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'tagline', 'quot', 'side', 'take', ""'re"", 'wrong.', 'quot', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'riddled', 'self-doubt', 'professor', 'clearly', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Yes', 'quot', 'sides', 'quot', 'are', 'aired', 'clear', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'nature', 'conflict', 'articulated', 'tortured', 'intellectually', 'honest', 'professor', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'newfound', 'black-and-white', 'worldview', 'quot', 'true', 'believer', 'quot', 'student.All', 'conflict', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'gripping', 'cinema', 'What', 'actually', 'are', 'likely', 'come', 'away', 'quot', 'hmmm-it-probably-worked-onstage', 'quot', 'feeling', 'too', 'bad', 'Given', 'potentially', 'incendiary', 'subject', 'matter', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film']",N/A
191005,A60074ZOWMQGX,1574920227,Joe Banks,"[31, 31]","A previous reviewer called this film unnerving.  Being a university professor, I can certainly attest that it touched a nerve.  Oleanna is a fascinating character study that will almost certainly evoke powerful feelings in whoever watches it.  After seeing it, I felt a lingering sense of unease that I couldn't quite explain.  I thought about the film a long time before the reason dawned on me.Oleanna is a story about a power play between two relatively unsympathetic characters:  a pompous, complacent Professor and a dedicated, but dense, Student.  At the start, the failing Student is seeking help from the seemingly indifferent Professor.  As the plot slowly unfolds, we see that the Professor is not as uncaring as he  initially appears.  In fact, he delays a critical real estate deal to stay and counsel the student.  Ironically, because of his compassion toward her, the advantage gradually shifts from the Professor to the Student.  By the end of the story, it's shockingly clear how high the stakes really were--the power play has morphed into a death match.Some reviewers have argued that each character's point of view has merit.  For example, the Student has sacrificed & struggled to get to college, and is (rightly) angry that she if failing a course by a the Professor who holds higher education in utter contempt.  That being said, the Student is clearly unable to grasp anything beyond a literal interpretation of what she reads, hears, or experiences.  Because of this, it's painfully obvious that she doesn't belong in college.  However, rather than hold her to a clear intellectual standard, the Professor tries to coddle and accomodate her.  It is this misguided deed, combined with her literal & paranoid interpretation of his actions, that leads to the Professor's undoing.In the aftermath of their initial meeting, the Student charges the Professor with sexual harrassment and abuse of power.  In subsequent acts, the Professor tries to reason with her, which only makes matters worse.  Ultimately, she convinces the all-powerful Tenure committee to embrace her version of the truth.  Only in the final act is it revealed she may have been out to destroy the Professor from the start.  In fact, there's a not so subtle hint that she thinks she's God.  And why shouldn't she?  By the end of the story she has managed to change the destiny of both the Professor and herself.  So what is the moral of this story?  It is, simply, that the educated will let the stupid inherit the Earth.  What makes Oleanna  particulary frightening is that this can, and does, happen every day.",5,Fascinating and Frightening,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2601,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'called', 'film', 'unnerving', 'Being', 'university', 'professor', 'can', 'certainly', 'attest', 'touched', 'nerve', 'Oleanna', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'evoke', 'powerful', 'feelings', 'whoever', 'watches', 'seeing', 'felt', 'lingering', 'sense', 'unease', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'explain', 'thought', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'reason', 'dawned', 'me.Oleanna', 'story', 'power', 'play', 'two', 'relatively', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'pompous', 'complacent', 'Professor', 'dedicated', 'dense', 'Student', 'start', 'failing', 'Student', 'seeking', 'help', 'seemingly', 'indifferent', 'Professor', 'plot', 'slowly', 'unfolds', 'see', 'Professor', 'not', 'as', 'uncaring', 'initially', 'fact', 'critical', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'stay', 'counsel', 'student', 'Ironically', 'compassion', 'advantage', 'gradually', 'Professor', 'Student', 'end', 'story', 'shockingly', 'clear', 'how', 'high', 'stakes', 'really', 'were', 'power', 'play', 'morphed', 'death', 'match.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'argued', 'character', 'point', 'view', 'merit', 'example', 'Student', 'sacrificed', 'struggled', 'get', 'college', 'rightly', 'angry', 'failing', 'course', 'Professor', 'who', 'higher', 'education', 'utter', 'contempt', 'being', 'said', 'Student', 'clearly', 'unable', 'grasp', 'anything', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'what', 'hears', 'experiences', 'painfully', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'belong', 'college', 'However', 'rather', 'hold', 'clear', 'intellectual', 'standard', 'Professor', 'tries', 'coddle', 'accomodate', 'misguided', 'deed', 'combined', 'literal', 'paranoid', 'interpretation', 'actions', 'Professor', 'undoing.In', 'aftermath', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Student', 'Professor', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'abuse', 'power', 'subsequent', 'acts', 'Professor', 'tries', 'reason', 'only', 'matters', 'worse', 'Ultimately', 'all-powerful', 'Tenure', 'committee', 'embrace', 'version', 'truth', 'Only', 'final', 'act', 'revealed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'destroy', 'Professor', 'start', 'fact', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'hint', 'God', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'end', 'story', 'managed', 'change', 'destiny', 'Professor', 'So', 'what', 'moral', 'story', 'simply', 'educated', 'will', 'let', 'stupid', 'inherit', 'Earth', 'What', 'Oleanna', 'particulary', 'frightening', 'can', 'happen', 'day']",N/A

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[6, 6]","Sure, on the surface this seems like a movie/play about sexual harrassment, but it is truly deeper and more terrifying than that.  I believe what this story is about is modern man's inability to conduct civil discourse, and of our propensity to run roughshod over our fellow citizens just to prove that we can.  The professor and the student in this story are both extremely flawed in their own ways, but in common they are both terrible at simple human communication.  As a result, a very minor event gets blown WAY out of proportion, and neither character has the foresight to see how badly things may well turn out as a result - at least until it's too late.  This is actually a very sharp microcosm of America's litigous society.  We seek to sue rather than to compromise or understand.  It's not enough to be right - everyone else has to be wrong.  This story is as good an example as anything else I've encountered of why our society is going to hell in a handbasket.  We as a society are so full of hatred, self-loathing, insecurity, and/or pomposity that we are hastening our own cultural demise.  The tag line for this movie (and the play) is ""Whatever side you take, you're wrong.""  How right that is!  There is no right side or wrong side.  That is not the point anyway.

191007,A2ZE73RFY0GD3K,1574920227,J. Reynolds,"[5, 7]","This is an interesting little stage play in which a distracted college professor, meeting with one of his students, is sucked right into a huge mess orchestrated by that student.Given that the student's name is Carol, I did not understand the play's title ""Oleanna.""  The dictionary advises, though, that an ""oleander"" is a poisonous evergreen shrub.  This student was definitely poisonous, skillfully using the professor's own words against him and purposefully pushing him into doing further damage to himself.From my own experience in the working world, I believe a similar real-life episode would never be allowed to fester as far as this one did.  I think a real professor would have severed all contact with the student immediately after her actions following their first meeting, when she wrote up the conversation (recalled, astonishingly, word-for-word in great volume) and used it to document an official complaint against the poor chump.  He kept attempting to deal with her, to negotiate, and constantly found himself saying the wrong thing and/or prompting the young woman's hostility and increasing her power over his life.I bought this film because I heard the stage play sometimes provoked loud arguments in the audiences during the performances, and fist fights afterward in the theater lobbies -- and I can see how that would happen, especially among the college set and young professional adults.David Mamet's dialogue is obviously David Mamet's dialogue.  At times, I fully expected characters to break into, ""Go to lunch, George.  Will you go to lunch?  Will you go to lunch?""This is worth seeing once, for the mental challenge/enjoyment, but it's probably not the sort of intense drama you'll want to view repeatedly like Glengarry Glen Ross or Reservoir Dogs.",3,Compelling But Unrealistic,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1782,"['interesting', 'little', 'stage', 'play', 'distracted', 'college', 'professor', 'meeting', 'one', 'students', 'sucked', 'right', 'huge', 'mess', 'orchestrated', 'student.Given', 'student', 'name', 'Carol', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'play', 'title', 'Oleanna', 'dictionary', 'advises', 'though', 'oleander', 'poisonous', 'evergreen', 'shrub', 'student', 'was', 'definitely', 'poisonous', 'skillfully', 'using', 'professor', 'own', 'words', 'purposefully', 'pushing', 'doing', 'further', 'damage', 'himself.From', 'own', 'experience', 'working', 'world', 'believe', 'similar', 'real-life', 'episode', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'fester', 'as', 'far', 'one', 'did', 'think', 'real', 'professor', 'would', 'have', 'severed', 'contact', 'student', 'immediately', 'actions', 'following', 'first', 'meeting', 'when', 'wrote', 'up', 'conversation', 'recalled', 'astonishingly', 'word-for-word', 'great', 'volume', 'used', 'document', 'official', 'complaint', 'poor', 'chump', 'kept', 'attempting', 'deal', 'negotiate', 'constantly', 'found', 'saying', 'wrong', 'thing', 'and/or', 'prompting', 'young', 'woman', 'hostility', 'increasing', 'power', 'life.I', 'bought', 'film', 'heard', 'stage', 'play', 'sometimes', 'provoked', 'loud', 'arguments', 'audiences', 'performances', 'fist', 'fights', 'afterward', 'theater', 'lobbies', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'happen', 'especially', 'college', 'set', 'young', 'professional', 'adults.David', 'Mamet', 'dialogue', 'obviously', 'David', 'Mamet', 'dialogue', 'times', 'fully', 'expected', 'characters', 'break', 'Go', 'lunch', 'George', 'Will', 'go', 'lunch', 'Will', 'go', 'lunch', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'mental', 'challenge/enjoyment', 'probably', 'not', 'sort', 'intense', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'want', 'view', 'repeatedly', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs']",N/A
191008,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,1574920227,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[3, 3]","I titled my review as above only to distinguish the fact I am in no way an intellectual.  This was unnecessary of course for anyone who had read any of my previous reviews.  Not much insight, little education, but rich in opinion.For this three-act play by David Mamet transformed to film by Mamet I offer my movie-buff-opinions on three facets of the movie version of 'Oleanna' and include a personal insight I question.Mamet, having penned the tale, was the obvious choice as a director.  We know of course he must have attained what he desired.  Unfortunately, as film fans many viewers migh possibly be more receptive to Mamet's attempts to portray 'real-life communication' if he had allowed actor's to deliver his beloved interruptions as just that - interruptions.  In everyday conversation when people interrupt and talk over one another there are no 'silences' between the words we interrupt.  Our conversations explode into one long flow of dialogue.  Multiple words of one participant are overlapped and drowned out by the other speaker's interrupting words.  Most of us recognize it because we nearly all do it - often.  Mamet's attempt felt annoying to me because the effort for realism (the interruptions) was interrupted itself by the silences he directed into the script.  But hey, he is the author, the director, the expert.  I am just a talker who gets interrupted often, rightly so most of the time.  He did get one interruption accurate, that darn telephone.  It was as real on film as in our lives and I yearned for Macy's character to just unplug the thing!Acting ability is so easily recognized when there are only two characters for comparison and an extremely challenging script as a common opponent.  The so often undertreated, extremely talented William Macy is hands-down the superior thespian in this match.  His ability to strictly conform to Mamet's restrictive formula and still manage to give definition, life, emotion, and humanity to the professor unfortunately served to spotlight the lesser acting talent of Debra Eisenstadt in her role of Carol, the student.  Eisenstadt's delivery of Mamet's stilted words were particularly irritating in the first act (I personally yearned to smack her); perhaps the major reason some reviewers only made it through a small portion of the film before throwing in the towel.  An unfortunate decision on their part leading to their being cheated of the heart of the argument ultimately unfolding on screen.""whichever side you take, you're wrong"", the tag line for this film is interesting in that while the story is guaranteed to make the viewer 'think' about the opposing sides, we seem to 'remain' on the same side at that end as we were at the beginning.  Throughout the previous reviews, the reader could easily discern the 'professor' from the 'student' by the content of the review itself without the inclusion of the statement of the obvious 'as a professor/teacher' or 'I am a student'.  Our predilection for 'pulling for' or 'mentally defending' our own stance throughout the film no doubt makes 'Oleanna' much more interesting and personal for each viewer.  While the unfolding of events exposes the pros and cons of the beliefs of each stringently drawn stereotypical character, viewers seem to ultimately discover their urge to mentally enter the fray and root for 'their' side.It goes without saying, given this being the work of David Mamet, this is not an action-packed shoot-em up, techno-rich experience.  There is a reason however why some reviewers alluded to being drained and tired at the end of this film.  It encompasses the viewer in a mental wresting match that invigorates the thought processes of the viewer to such a degree that we are challenged to participate, encouraged to interrupt with our own thoughts and ideas, and just as frustrated at the interruptions to our participation as the characters on screen. I highly recommend this film to anyone loving a good argument.  No, it isn't 'Inherit the Wind' or even the more personal 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'.  It is however a debate on higher education, women's rights, personal ambition, and communication in today's world without many of those specific 'words' being spoken.  No blatant bandstanding, no catch phrases.  Just two people engaged in a personal interchange on many of today's hottest topics which involves the viewer to a degree that we recognize the battle, pick our side, and pull for all we are worth, often finding personal kernels of thought just for ourselves.Possible spoilers if you haven't yet seen the film.  You might consider stopping here and coming back to read later.My questionable personal insight?  Having read the previous reviews, it struck me I read a lot into this play that apparently wasn't there.  As the events unfolded I deducted that Carol's group was 'women' in generally, not a specifically formed social group.  Also, I felt that the entire first act and specifically her personal actions were an act on her part.  As Carol revealed herself a more vocal, less confused and more specifically directed person, I felt that the professor had deliberately been 'set-up' from the git-go.  She had a plan and knowing his personality she had designed that plan feeling confident he would 'fall right into' her contrivance.  The hanging around, refusing to leave, writing it all down such didn't seem 'normal' and 'natural' for the character she was vocalizing.  But, it is pretty clear I am in a minority of one on this, based on the other reviews.  That fact however is the down-fall of watching films alone and the beauty of a thought-provoking film, it gets your gray-cells marching and allows them to explore in all sorts of directions.",4,From a

This movie centers on the power struggles between a college professor and one of his female students, touching on issues of male/female relationships as well as the perception of power between the genders. An ambitious plot which, unfortunately, seems to meander all over the place before leading to a rather chilling, climactic ending. While Macy does a fine job of communicating Mamet's dialogue  his character, a university professor on the verge of tenure, seems artificially constrained by the stilted dialogue and the peculiar rhythms of speech ( a trademark of Mamet which sometimes works, but not in this movie). The young woman who plays the student seemed equally restricted by the dialogue. Even with the unevenness and flaws within this movie, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen as the plot was intriguing. Ultimately, however, I was left with a feeling of confusion and a sense that this one fell far short of its ambitious intentions. What was the message Mamet was trying to convey, I wondered?

Take Mamet's trademark choppy and rythmic prose - add that there are two characters in the whole film - put that together with the fact that the film is about one of the most controversial subjects and yet, does no 'moralizing' of the 'who's right' variety. What do you get? Boredom? Torture? That's what you'd think, right? Wrong! This film is outstanding; that is...if you are a David Mamet fan. I am, and quite frankly, if you're not, you should be.Oleanna is the story of a girl who goes to see her college professor for help in a class she is failing. He means well (so it seems) and tries to help, but says (and does?) some thing that lead her to suspect sexual harrassment. Before long a complaint is filed and he may lose his tenure and his job. Yes, the whole film - THE WHOLE FILM - is dialogue between these two characters in his office (three acts). But as a testament to Mamet, no one has ever made a two-person dialogue stretched over 90 minutes so forward moving, exciting, confusing, nuanced, and awesome. The ending is explosive!The reason for the knocked out star is for the Mamet-ness which, though I am accustomed to and love, may seem strange to the uninitiated. His style is this: the dialogue he writes containes fragmented and somewhat choppy sentences as an attempt to immitate real speech (why do movie characters always talk in complete sentences?). Further, instead of the actors improvising the ""ums"" and stammers, Mamet actually WRITES THEM INTO THE SCRIPT and the actor's job is to perform it completely as written! What does this make for? If done correctly and properly it makes for a highly rythmic and forward moving style. If done poorly, it makes for a mechanical and almost dull recetative that gets under your skin, it's so tight. Fortunately, it is done quite well by the two actors (with ever-so-slight slippage into the monotone from the actress).All in all, this is a film I will watch again and again, and I'm confident that I'll see new nuances each time (that's just Mamet's way!).

Along with that I was also expecting Mamet to effectively nurture my confusion. Doing so in his trademark &quot;trickster&quot; style. First having a character give his side of the story and then the other one give hers and as they argue, the audience should have seen very valid points from both sides. Thus making it impossible to fully condemn either character. If this had happened the tagline would have been true, and I would have given this film five stars. Nothing even remotely close to that happened. Macy was beaten at his own game yes but he was beaten unfairly. He was innocent of the charges, and she knew it. She just out-talked him and used his personality against him. The fact remains that all he was trying to do was help her. He was willing to make sacrifices so that a student could succeed in his class. She used that against him as well. She couldn't figure the material out so she instead figured him out. She effectively destroyed him.  Now I am aware that this is probably the exact opposite of what Mamet intended. Mamet was alarmed that the audience cheered when Macy hit her. Yet I did too.

191013,A11CWKAAEU2BPN,1574920227,"Michael C ""Mick""","[0, 0]","Oleanna is a two-character piece. For the most part, the dynamics are played out in a series of rooms on an unnamed  college campus.Carol approaches the professor for help. She's failing his course. Instead of giving her conventional advice, the professor explains to Carol his entire philosophy of education. She is offended by some of what he says, and they argue, but their eventual parting seems to be amicable, in the beginning.Bolstered by a group of nameless, faceless supporters, Carol is no longer the nervous, uncertain girl of as the movie plays out. Her self-assurances waxes, the professor's wanes.An intellectual sparring match where there is no absolute truth.The dialogue is strewn with inuendo's through out the latter part of the movie, though neither is lying; it is the subjective rather than the objective element of their account which is unique to each who witness this movie unfold.Ultimately, perhaps the question in Oleanna is not whether sexual harassment has been committed, but exactly who is persecuting whom.Although there often appears to be a play with graduated English literal terminology, Carol often demeans the language to lower the standard in conversation; though apparently fluent in it's use.As the movie progressors it's possible in the beginning to see Carol searching for understanding, then toward the end simply using it as condesending weapon or retaliation, in attempt to belittle and demean the professor; as she feels, was done to her and not just in terms of conversation but her grade. There is constant reflective quality of a word meaning, that within the cofines of using a word and within the sentance structure, which is acurrately used, becomes a tool to change the structure of intent and meaning.The most annoying aspect of this work,is the constant interruption and it's not the phone ringing during critical pauses in conversation, but the constant incomplete and interupted sentances and 'Flight of Thought'; by both the professor and Carol.In some ways, the progression of Oleanna is more like that of a psychological thriller than a drama.As the movie goes forward, there is the revealation that Carol has filed a protest against the professor, accusing him of sexual harassment. Her charges have some part of fact, but neither intent nor context are considered within the charges laid forth. They are not meant to be real, in fact.This is essentially a play of a student failing a class and is looking to get even, easily reflected in her attempts to document each and every word; which in its self is taken out of true context, thus proving a play on words without a witness,is nothing more than words -Accurate as they may be. Having noted that, the turning point of the whole movie, was made in the most simple fashion...""Don't call your wife, baby"",one will have to see the movie and then consider context and intent of that small phrase and the impact relationship.Oleanna is a about mind games and I would feel confident that there is the possibility to see more than two versions of the whole, in the end. Much of the interpration is left open for judgement.For myself  I see a student, feeling threatened with failure, seeks guidance with the express intent of obsolving herself; only the situation gets out of control and that's remarkable, the movie is about control, although the word 'Power' in transgressed into the theme. In order for the student to give conscience to her appeal, she drives herself deeper into a disconsolate mood and is not helped by the professors ideology of himself and that education is his to manipulate. Neither one listening to the other, the result is the student breaks down the barriers, using her notes to have the professors tenure dismissed, without any involvement on his part officially; the professor was over confident and should have seeked School counsel.The end result was in fact more than words, but the physical act of lost control and indeed a crime, pushed and goaded he cracked.I'm always taken by those that subverse others with dreaded ""Social"" crimes, with no real merit, equally the self imposed Rightous types; we have both in this drama.Michael",4,"Only watched the movie, have not read the book.",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,4176,"['Oleanna', 'two-character', 'piece', 'most', 'part', 'dynamics', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'series', 'rooms', 'unnamed', 'college', 'campus.Carol', 'professor', 'help', 'failing', 'course', 'Instead', 'giving', 'conventional', 'advice', 'professor', 'Carol', 'entire', 'philosophy', 'education', 'offended', 'what', 'argue', 'eventual', 'parting', 'be', 'amicable', 'beginning.Bolstered', 'group', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'supporters', 'Carol', 'no', 'longer', 'nervous', 'uncertain', 'girl', 'movie', 'out', 'self-assurances', 'waxes', 'professor', 'wanes.An', 'intellectual', 'sparring', 'match', 'where', 'absolute', 'truth.The', 'dialogue', 'strewn', 'inuendo', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'lying', 'subjective', 'rather', 'objective', 'element', 'account', 'unique', 'who', 'witness', 'movie', 'unfold.Ultimately', 'perhaps', 'question', 'Oleanna', 'not', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'been', 'committed', 'exactly', 'who', 'persecuting', 'there', 'often', 'be', 'play', 'graduated', 'English', 'literal', 'terminology', 'Carol', 'often', 'language', 'lower', 'standard', 'conversation', 'apparently', 'fluent', 'use.As', 'movie', 'possible', 'beginning', 'see', 'Carol', 'searching', 'understanding', 'then', 'end', 'simply', 'using', 'condesending', 'weapon', 'retaliation', 'attempt', 'belittle', 'demean', 'professor', 'was', 'done', 'not', 'just', 'terms', 'conversation', 'grade', 'constant', 'reflective', 'quality', 'word', 'meaning', 'cofines', 'using', 'word', 'sentance', 'structure', 'acurrately', 'used', 'tool', 'change', 'structure', 'intent', 'meaning.The', 'most', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'work', 'constant', 'interruption', 'not', 'phone', 'ringing', 'critical', 'pauses', 'conversation', 'constant', 'incomplete', 'interupted', 'sentances', ""'Flight"", 'Thought', 'professor', 'Carol.In', 'ways', 'progression', 'Oleanna', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'drama.As', 'movie', 'forward', 'revealation', 'Carol', 'filed', 'protest', 'professor', 'accusing', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'charges', 'have', 'part', 'fact', 'intent', 'context', 'are', 'considered', 'charges', 'laid', 'forth', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'real', 'fact.This', 'essentially', 'play', 'student', 'failing', 'class', 'looking', 'get', 'even', 'easily', 'reflected', 'attempts', 'document', 'word', 'self', 'taken', 'true', 'context', 'thus', 'proving', 'play', 'words', 'witness', 'nothing', 'more', 'words', '-Accurate', 'may', 'be', 'Having', 'noted', 'turning', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'most', 'simple', 'fashion', 'Do', ""n't"", 'call', 'wife', 'baby', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'consider', 'context', 'intent', 'small', 'phrase', 'impact', 'relationship.Oleanna', 'mind', 'games', 'would', 'feel', 'confident', 'possibility', 'see', 'more', 'two', 'versions', 'whole', 'end', 'Much', 'interpration', 'left', 'open', 'judgement.For', 'see', 'student', 'feeling', 'threatened', 'failure', 'guidance', 'express', 'intent', 'obsolving', 'only', 'situation', 'control', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'control', 'word', ""'Power"", 'transgressed', 'theme', 'order', 'student', 'give', 'conscience', 'appeal', 'deeper', 'disconsolate', 'mood', 'not', 'helped', 'professors', 'ideology', 'education', 'manipulate', 'one', 'listening', 'other', 'result', 'student', 'down', 'barriers', 'using', 'notes', 'have', 'professors', 'tenure', 'dismissed', 'involvement', 'part', 'officially', 'professor', 'was', 'confident', 'should', 'have', 'seeked', 'School', 'counsel.The', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'fact', 'more', 'words', 'physical', 'act', 'lost', 'control', 'indeed', 'crime', 'pushed', 'goaded', ""'m"", 'always', 'taken', 'subverse', 'others', 'dreaded', 'Social', 'crimes', 'real', 'merit', 'equally', 'self', 'imposed', 'Rightous', 'types', 'have', 'drama.Michael']",N/A

191015,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,1574920227,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","Oleanna gets my solid recommendation, at least for people who like small movies with really intense acting performances. Adapted pretty much straightforward from the play, it benefits from the intimacy of television, as it gets no benefit from being on a big screen. It is not really a feminist film as neither character is portrayed in a particularly flattering manner.Oleanna is basically a two-character film, which is divided into three sections, corresponding to three visits by a young college woman to her professor's faculty office. It is a small elite college and coming from a modest background she has had to make a lot of sacrifices to attend the school. As we come to know her we see that she harbors an ""extreme"" amount of resentment concerning these sacrifices.The Professor (William Macy who played the role on the stage) is pompous, arrogant, and overbearing. He pontificates excessively and having him as your instructor would not be an inspirational experience. His approach to teaching and the film's title (a reference to a couple who sold swampland to unsuspecting saps) is a slap at the rip-off that passes for higher education.Carol (Debra Eisenstadt) is flunking his class, her work is inadequate but she feels entitled to special treatment because of her disadvantaged social situation and her many sacrifices to attend the school. It is on this point that the film is especially interesting because part of her situation has merit, she simply wants him to teach her-to respect her and her aspirations for an education (i.e. to actually be a teacher). And someone from her background should receive help with the technical terms and theoretical abstractions, which are familiar to those who received better preparation in high school. Toward the end of her first visit the professor for unknown reasons switches from stern taskmaster into his paternal mode and seems to realize that he really should be doing his job better.But Carol misinterprets his sudden interest and on her second visit informs him that she and a support ""group"" are pursing a sexual harassment complaint with his tenure committee. Her allegations, when viewed out of context appear to have merit and upset him enough that he physically blocks her exit. This simply compounds his trouble.Her third visit occurs after he has been denied tenure and is packing up to leave the school. While clear that the professor has never had any sexual interest in her and was not trying to trade sexual favors for a grade, Carol's interpretation of his actions seems reasonable and sincere until she attempts to blackmail him and condescendingly admonishes him about the pet name he uses for his wife. At that point (if not before) you realize that she is a nut case who has irresponsibly ruined his life, in part because of her resentment about her overall situation at the college and in part because of an unconscicious desire for power.This makes for a intriguing twist as Carol is revealed as one of those well meaning people so caught up in the rightness of their cause (and the seductive power of suddenly having influence) that they become blind to the human consequences of their actions.Then again, what do I know?

As a two hander, it&#65533;s certainly well acted by Mamet regular William H Macy and Debra Eisenstadt, and Mamet even throws in some songs he wrote on the soundtrack, but the set traps us in the two rooms that the college professor accused of sexual misconduct and the student charging him, inhabit.

First, his characters are stereotypes (students will no longer do &quot;anything&quot; for a grade, though professors are more than willing to do so rather than risk damaging a student's self-esteem).  Secondly, the fatal flaw is not in character but in a system that equates grades and credits with knowledge.  Within such a politicized, institutional context, a sympathetic case can be made for the professor but none strong enough to exonerate him.

The film has only two characters, one being a college professor (played by William H Macy) and a shy young student (played by Debra Eisenstadt) even though these two characters are the only prominent players in the story; the director manages to develop a nerve retching, edge of your seat thriller that will have you thinking during the credits.The film begins with carol (the shy student) that is failing a college course and is really eager to pass her class. She tries to convince her professor of giving her a second chance at passing the class. the professor has no interest in doing so, the student insists. This is pretty much the whole story a feedback between student and professor, between the so called experienced and the amateur. the story gets in to full thriller mode when carol begins to blackmail her professor, claiming that he harassed and intended to rape her.

He has gone to the same well too many times for me.  Once or twice to add a twist, OK.  It's usage in practically everything he does these these days strains my patience.That being said, this was a difficult film to withstand at first, and not shut down to watch something else.  Here we have two people, both of whom are obviously not on the same page, holding conversations about subjects of interest only to themselves; not with each other.  The viewing experience is quite taxing to begin with, and only by sustained attention do we finally gain some comprehension of what is actually going on.  Forget about figuring out where it may be going; no such luck.Not to give anything away, if you can stay with this movie for the first two thirds duration, your loyalty to difficult cinema will eventually be rewarded when the film finally rolls into the final furlong.

191022,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,1574920227,Thomas Glebe,"[4, 5]","I generally enjoyed this David Mamet film, but throughout the stuttered, ridiculously choppy and awkwardly timed dialogue, and ""come out of nowhere"" twists and turns, which keep the viewer generally guessing and interested most of the way, the final resolution is ultimately disappointing as a complete train of truthful, meaningful, logical to the end thought.This work seemingly invites viewers into taking a side between the only two characters involved, a young, female college student and her middle-aged, male professor.  But this is the wrong approach in my view because both characters are eventually portrayed as equally sharing in the blame for what transpires. And that just isn't the case.  While the student here is initially portrayed as innocently questioning the prof's teaching methods, and worried about her personal performance in the teacher's class, as are her rights, her character soon turns into an over-the-top and obviously, irrationally vindictive,  ""bad"" person (which she fully admits to being mid-film, but which is never elaborated upon).And while the prof's eventual physically violent and angry reaction to this crazy student's despicable and false accusations and behavior, go overboard in the much too abrupt end, any truly objective viewer will easily I think, understand (if not approve of) his reactions, as opposed to hers.  Almost ordering, as the student does at the end, her teacher not to call his own loved wife, ""baby"" because she casually ""objects"" to it, is insane.The ending in this film is left up in the air as to who has the strongest case here, the student or the teacher, but it's really no contest, as far as I'm concerned. The female student is a clearly, and eventually revealed, psychologically disturbed wacko. The prof has his own faults no doubt, but that he not only tried to, but actually did ""RAPE"" the female student, simply by taking a caring and personal interest in her philosophical questions and anxieties, is totally specious. The truth is something quite different.  This is a movie which throws out a lot of important concepts, especially as it concerns male-female relationships, and the ""power over another"" incongruities in general of the academic student/teacher dynamic. But in my view, it all eventually comes up short because, at the end, it paints the professor as well as the student as equal ""evils.""  And that just isn't so, as written and presented.I have enjoyed a lot of playwright/screenwriter/director David Mamet's other works, especially ""House of Games,"" ""Edmond,"" ""State and Main,"" ""About Last Night,"" ""Wag the Dog,"" and ""Hoffa,"" among many others, and his early masterpiece, ""The Verdict"" (best picture winner 1982), but this effort just doesn't cut it.  In virtually every other Mamet film I've seen, a lot of which led the viewer to vaguely interpreted finales, where one has latent sympathies for both the good guy/gal and opposite, there's really no contest here.  The graduate female student can only be considered quite deranged and simply ""bad.""  The professor, despite his violent anger and corporal abuse at the end, seems justified in a way, and quite sane and basically decent.While I appreciate the intent here, as in most of his films, of letting the viewer be the final judge of good and evil (most brilliantly shown in my personal Mamet favorite, ""House of Games""), the student's evolving words, behavior, and totally bizarre, harsh, real-life actions she takes against her supposed ""oppressor,"" in this movie, aren't really ever justified by the material as a whole.  Or by what the prof actually says, does, or preaches.  In essence, the very last scene is really what should've only been the beginning of another ten minutes or so of needed extrapolation and explanation to make the film, and its characters plausible, in which, a true balance of credibility and believable food for thought might've been offered.What is actually presented here is just too black and white, but is erroneously painted in bogus shades of gray, and the dialogue and pacing are just too artificial and rough, and inconsistently but continually stretch the limits of credulity.  Finally, the fact that any university ""tenure"" committee would EVER take this particular student's ""complaints"" seriously in the first place, with such flimsy, if non-existent hard evidence, seems highly implausible at best.  Let alone such which might and does lead to the poor guy losing his tenure, his job, and basically his whole academic, financial and personal well being, without any shown hearing or trial, based solely on the deranged ""word"" of an obvious psycho.Entertaining and interesting up to a point, this is definitely one of Mamet's lesser works.  Given his substantial body of other great accomplishments however, this weaker effort I can only give a mediocre rating and let the viewer be the final judge.  Though I'd strongly advise everyone to see (I watched it a couple of times on cable), or at least rent this before buying it, based solely upon Mamet's fine overall reputation and body of work alone.",3,An interesting misfire...,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,5094,"['generally', 'enjoyed', 'David', 'Mamet', 'film', 'stuttered', 'ridiculously', 'choppy', 'awkwardly', 'timed', 'dialogue',

In all my years of teaching I think I may have come across a student this bright and literate perhaps half a dozen times, if that.  I found the dialogue between her and the tenure seeking professor unconvincing and so stuffy it's hard to believe.  Mamet's writing, far more suited to the stage, is hard to take.  It has the same clipped and far from real life tone as it did in &quot;House of Games&quot; (a far better picture, in my opinion). I do not see where this film portrays some big deal intellectual game between these two.

191024,AY8WZDYR79GFV,1574920227,Yasha Banana,"[6, 12]","First, the problem I have with this movie. ... Then the problem I have with David Mamet.Let's face it, in this movie both characters are up to no good.  The student uses power to attack the teacher, and the teacher uses his power to belittle and harass the student.The student was attacked verbally, at first, and then, at the end of the movie, quite clearly attacked *physically.*  It doesn't matter the provocation, the teacher physically attacked the student.  Likewise, the student went to far in destroying the teacher's career as well as whatever consequences occurred in his private life.So what does that suggest David Mamet wants to say about human nature?  I certainly am not the first one to maintain that David Mamet is misanthropic; it's a now-common criticism of his work and of his worldview.  Add to this his recent ""conversion from soft-left liberal to Milton Friedman right-wing conservative and what do you have?  Someone who is (now) convinced that people are *not* essentially good at heart and therefore (and here's where the politics come in) why try to change society for the better, those lousy people out there, outside the high, well-built walls of the rich and superrich ... will only screw things up.This has been the path others artists of Mamet's generation have taken, most notably Martin Scorcese and Woody Allen.  They remind me of the line fascist-like Joseph Cotton had in Alfred Hithcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" -- ""Don't you know that the world is a sewer.""I reject that.  And for an artist of Mamet's talent and abilities to feel that way is worse than a violent crime, it's a crime against history.  It's a crime against all those people who historically have struggled to make the world a better place.  I wonder how many hours David Mamet's father and grandfather, and perhaps mother and grandmother and great grandparents worked per day, per week and under what conditions.  I wonder how they would have gotten by if the army of people who fought and struggled and died for an eight-hour day and safe working conditions and the right to organize, I wonder how well they would have fared if instead of fighting these people became cynical and negative and fell in love with Corporate America (as Mamet clearly indicated in his recent left-to-right ""conversion article"" The Village Voice).Here's a man who savaged capitalism and the corporate mentality in ""Glengary Glenross"" -- and now *loves* corporations, can't live without them, tells us that, after all, we must need and love them, they provide so many of the things we want. ... You know, like economic depressions, multi-billion dollar bailouts, slave-sweatshop labor, global warming, foul air, low-paying, dead-end jobs, ownership of the political process.In short, what can David Mamet possible write or create in the future that speaks to the ""felt-lives"" of millions of people?
