I was so intrigued by this show that I became addicted to it and watched it every week religiously.  That was until my work schedule changed.

It allowed me to see all the episodes I missed.The way this show has been set up with dirty cops, Shark's shady background & dealings, the new prosecutors, and just the over all way the legal system is manipulated to put away the bad guys, makes it worthy of detective/lawyer shows.  There is so much going on that it keeps your interest and throws is twist and turns that one doesn't expect.The cast of this season is full of a great bunch of actors.Deputy District Attorney Sebastian Stark-James Woods - Chews Up the Scenery and has a great presence.District Attorney/Deputy District Attorney Jessica Devlin-Jeri Ryan - I like tension between her and Stark.Julie Stark-Danielle Panabaker - I think her story line is just some filler.  Sometimes I care other times I don't.  If she went away, I wouldn't miss her.Deputy District Attorney Raina Troy-Sophina Brown - She is one of my favorites. Smart, sexy, resourceful, not afraid to step & take on confutations.Deputy District Attorney Madeline Poe-Sarah Carter - She is real ball buster & is really taking to heart Stark's teachings.District Attorney Investigator Isaac Wright-Henry Simmons (Guest appearance episode 2, regular episode 8 - present) Kind of a dirty cop but is a good bridge for Stark to work with LAPD.Deputy District Attorney Casey Woodland-Samuel Page (Season 1)Deputy District Attorney Martin Allende-Alexis Cruz (Episodes 1-11) - The episode when he gets killed gave me goose bumps.

1091595,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000TM1CL0,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","""Shark"" is a very original serie about a highly successful and really mean lawyer, Sebastian Stark (James Woods), who made a fortune and humiliated virtually every assistant district attorney in LA defending the most evil and despicable (but always very rich) criminals. His agressiveness and lack of scrupules earned him the nickname ""Shark"". But one day he has a conscience crisis (well, this is just a TV show, so I guess everything is possible...) and accepts to become an assistant district attorney himself, leading a High Profile Crimes Unit in Los Angeles. He finds himself under the orders of DA Jessica Devlin (magnificent Jeri Ryan), who suffered her share of humilaiting defeats against him - and gave him for this new unit a team of young, unexperienced (and not always very bright) ADA's.The team members are:- ADA Raina Troy (Sophina Brown), highly idealistic young black woman, who openly despises Stark but being very disciplined and unwilling to transfer stays loyal and obeys orders. Raina is hard working, methodical, calm and reserved - but her antipathy for her boss puts her good manners to a hard trial. Stark likes to shock and tease her, but respects her the most. She is the main stability pillar of the team.- ADA Casey Woodland (Samuel Page), a young white man, very handsome, born with a silver spoon in his mouth (his dad is a very rich and very prominent politician), he actually doesn't have to work if he doesn't want to - but clearly he got the virus of prosecution and he likes his job. He is very self confident (even arrogant), which makes him less than popular with other team members, especially Raina and Martin Allende... Stark just loves sending him curveballs and pointing at his mistakes, but he appreciates his aggressivity.- ADA Martin Allende - the youngest and the most delicate team member, is a young Latino guy, the first in his family to go to college and perceiving his work as a mission to help people and the whole society. He is even more idealistic than Raina (to the point of being naive) and working with Stark is a big challenge for him. Stark and Casey made a bet early in the series about his sexual orientation (Stark betting he is straight, Casey arguing he must be gay) and we know the answer just in the middle if the series.- last but definitely not least - ADA Madeline Poe (Sarah Carter, a jaw dropping beauty) - the most interesting (and the most gorgeous) team member is a hyper ambitious, totally cynical and ultra smart young woman, who asked to work with Stark to learn from the best in the trade. Contrary to Raina and Martin, she simply loves Stark's style and is as ready to play dirty as him - and even one better. She wants to be elected DA before being 40 (like Jessica Devlin, her other role model) and is ready to fight, cheat, lie and kill for it. Her intimate life will probably surprise even the most hardened TV viewers... With Stark himself this is the best character in the series.The cases treated by the team are mostly interesting, mostly important enough to attract the attention of Manuel Delgado, Mayor of Los Angeles (Carlos Gomez, great second role) himself. Mayor Delgado is also Stark's poker partner, at least once in a week... which comes handy from time to time.James Woods is of course the reason to watch this series and he really gives a great performance. His characer is so arrogant, mean, aggressive, cynical, that this is a pleasure to watch - especially considering that all this venom is directed against the evil doers (and most of the criminals are really really bad, and even worse, mostly they are rich...).However, even with all those good points, the series just fall short of a masterpiece. The reason is, I believe, that the creators of the series get scared by their own courage and simply didn't follow the logic to the end. Sebastian Stark is supposed to be a bad, arrogant, cynical person, treating people mainly as source of income and/or entertainement - and every time he could REALLY act his part, the screenplay holds him back or even makes him go backwards. We are supposed to believe, that a man, who defended the worse kind of people, earning big money and trashing victims, witnesses, policemen and prosecutors for nearly 30 years actually never used the services of a call girl when defending all the madams of LA(""I just represented them"")? Also he is supposed to be ultrasmart - and in EVERY episode he gets in trouble with his witnesses during the trial in EXACTLY the same way! That finally got on my nerves towards the end. Also be warned - the episodes ""The wrath of Khan"" and ""Trail by fire"" are probably the most idiotic things I ever saw on TV, the first of them introducing also totally useless changes in the series (in 11th episode!).Some episodes however are outstanding, especially ""Strange Bedfellows"", ""Russo"", ""Deja vu all over again"" and ""Love triangle"". In ""Russo"" you can appreciate a little joke - William Forsythe (Russo) and James Woods (Stark) already played together in ""Once upon a time in America"" long time ago and it is a great pleasure to see them reunited again, even for one episode. In ""Fall from Grace"" we can admire Natasha Henstridge as the most gorgeous guest star in the 1 season.All in all, this is a nice watch and I liked it (with the exception ot two episodes mentioned before) but do not expect the quality of ""Law and order"", ""CSI"" or ""The shield"".",4,"Interesting idea, nice watch and an excellent James Woods - but (sadly) not a master piece",1355184000,"12

1091597,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000TM1CL0,Olukayode Balogun,"[25, 27]","I've always respected James Woods as an actor. I've always thought of him as unique. He has a very unique image, has a very unique style and his choice of roles over the years have, I've always felt, marked him out as, well, unique. ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", ""True Crime"", ""Any Given Sunday"". Even his appearance on ""ER"" a few seasons ago. Whether the role has been big or small, on the big screen or small, my opinion is that he's always played very interesting characters.Once seen, Woods is very difficult to forget.Still, as much as I love me some legal drama, when I first heard about this TV series in 2006 a part of me thought - very snobbishly, I admit - that Woods' decision to do a TV series was a sign of his career as a movie actor being on the wane. I thought it would feel tired and desperate. As a consequence, even though I'd heard that the pilot was directed by Spike Lee, I didn't tune in to watch the series when it premiered here. Big mistake.I caught it around four or five episodes in - I was channel surfing and something - or someone - caught my eye. It could've been Henry Simmons. Whatever or whoever, after just a few minutes I was hooked.This fast-paced series has everything I love in a crime/courtroom drama. Woods, as LA maverick, &uuml;ber-prosecutor with a conscience Sebastian Stark, (who's just ""hopped the fence"" from the other side, i.e. defending criminals, by the way), is fast-talking, fast-thinking and is as slick as a pool of oil - but in a good way.The urban mayhem and legal wrangling were right up my street but I was also immediately drawn in by the underlying storyline involving Stark and his teenage daughter Julie, played by Danielle Panabaker. But it was when the show gave me one of the biggest sit-up-and-gape TV shocks of 2007 by killing off a major character, a character I'm sure everyone watching was growing to love, that I realised these people were serious. This was the real deal. I never missed another episode.Watching the entire season over on DVD has been a treat. Not only did I catch up on the episodes I missed, I also got the chance to review a scene if I didn't completely get it the first time round. Great performances all round, especially from Woods himself of course; from Jeri Ryan as his boss Jessica Delvin (the on-screen chemistry between her and Woods sizzles; the banter between their two characters is razor sharp, yet playful at the same time); from Simmons as cop-turned- prosecuting-investigator Isaac Wright and from Sam Page, Sophina Brown, Alexis Cruz and Sarah Carter as Woods' ADAs, Casey Woodland, Raina Troy, Martin Allende and Madeleine Poe respectively. A more dynamic legal team, I don't think I've ever seen on TV. This is what Dick Wolf's ill-fated ""Conviction"" wished it could've been. It's very much like ""The Shield"" but without the violence. There's no profanity either.If you enjoy courtroom drama, emotional drama, crime detection and all-round high-octane action with a sliver of politics thrown in, you can't afford to miss this 22-episode series. The season finale involving scenes with Stark and his daughter had me in floods of tears.DVD extras include audio commentary on selected episodes, a ""Creating Shark"" feaurette, gag reel and deleted scenes.This is brilliant TV. Highly recommended. Season two finally kicks of here this Friday.

1091598,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B000TM1CL0,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[6, 6]","About 20 years ago, I was working for the City of Oakland.  While I was there, James Woods was shooting ""True Believer""--the semi-biographical story of the San Francisco ""hippie"" attorney, Tony Serra.  In watching how he handled the role--going with the ponytail hairpiece to affect Serra's hairstyle, and his incredible energy--I came to a realization that Woods LOVES doing larger than life personalities.  It's been fascinating to think that he's done real-life lawyers some would think at opposite ends of the spectrum--Serra and the infamous Roy Cohn--along with some of his other characters (Ned Trent from ""The Specialist"").This leads to ""Shark"", and a role that Woods fits almost too perfectly.  We all know the premise--high-priced, highly successful defense attorney gets client acquitted, client murders wife and expects defense attorney to work his magic; defense attorney gets reality check, gets offered job in the Los Angeles District Attorney's office heading up a High Profile Crimes Unit, and lawyer proceeds to go legally medieval on criminals.  All this while suddenly learning to live with a 17-year old daughter he really hadn't had a hand in raising.This is a series that can't be pulled off unless you have a lead actor who can play an over-the-top character--at times, bordering on unsympathetic because of his ego and tactics--with a tremendous energy and humor.  That is why James Woods' Sebastian Stark is the center of this series' universe...and it's a pretty good universe.Take nothing away from the supporting players--in the office, Sarah Carter's Stark-wannbe Madeline Poe and Sophina Brown's moralistic Raina Troy are great and their relationships reflect their characters--Poe's encounters with Sam Page's Casey Woodland (A thin character that wasn't brought back in Season 2), and Troy's budding relationship with the HPCU's investigator, Issac Wright (The dignified Henry Simmons).  Of course, we cannot not mention Danielle Panabaker's Julie Stark--her decision to move in with her father at the start of the season, and Sebastian's adjustments--having to worry about a smart, charming daughter at the age when kids get in trouble--grounds Stark.Then, there's Jeri Ryan's Jessica Devlin.  The LA District Attorney clearly doesn't want Stark in her office at the start of the series, and what had been obviously an adversarial and contentious relationship at the start grows into a mutual respect (if not a friendship) between two former rivals thrown together, so much so that Devlin--when she loses the DA election--gets picked by Stark to save a case he's thrown off of.  Of course, seeing Ryan in her business suits makes me wish that somehow the series would have a Masquerade Party scene and she would wear the Seven Of Nine catsuit (I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I??!?).The high points of the season are the two Wayne Callison episodes, where Billy Campbell's slick serial killer gets himself onto Stark's radar, but doesn't find out until the final act of the season finale how far Stark is willing to go to see justice done.  It's a telling and ominous moment to hear what the bare-knuckles defense attorney-turned-prosecutor was willing to do to get even with Callison--not just for beating him the first time around, but HOW he was beaten.  I mention this because Callison may have done things to beat Stark in ""Wayne's World"" that Stark would have done as a defender.  In ""Wayne's World II"", the look that Campbell has in that final sequence when he finds out how Stark got him...is priceless.Make no mistake, ""Shark"" is James Woods' vehicle...and he drives it nicely.",4,Shark: Season 1--Was Woods Born For This?,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,3607,"['20', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'working', 'City', 'Oakland', 'was', 'there', 'James', 'Woods', 'was', 'shooting', 'True', 'Believer', 'semi-biographical', 'story', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hippie', 'attorney', 'Tony', 'Serra', 'watching', 'how', 'handled', 'role', 'going', 'ponytail', 'hairpiece', 'affect', 'Serra', 'hairstyle', 'incredible', 'energy', 'came', 'realization', 'LOVES', 'doing', 'larger', 'life', 'personalities', 'been', 'fascinating', 'think', 'done', 'real-life', 'lawyers', 'would', 'think', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'Serra', 'infamous', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'other', 'characters', 'Ned', 'Trent', 'Specialist', '.This', 'Shark', 'role', 'almost', 'too', 'perfectly', 'know', 'premise', 'high-priced', 'highly', 'successful', 'defense', 'attorney', 'client', 'acquitted', 'client', 'murders', 'wife', 'defense', 'attorney', 'work', 'magic', 'defense', 'attorney', 'reality', 'check', 'offered', 'job', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 'heading', 'up', 'High', 'Profile', 'Crimes', 'Unit', 'lawyer', 'proceeds', 'go', 'legally', 'medieval', 'criminals', 'suddenly', 'learning', 'live', '17-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'hand', 'raising.This', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'have', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'times', 'bordering', 'unsympathetic', 'ego', 'tactics', 'tremendous', 'energy', 'humor', 'why', 'James', 'Woods', 'Sebastian', 'Stark', 'center', 'series', 'universe', 'pretty', 'good', 'universe.Take', 'nothing', 'away', 'supporting', 'players', 'office', 'Sarah', 'Carter', 'Stark-wannbe', 'Madeline', 'Poe', 'Sophina', 'Brown', 'moralistic', 'Raina', 'Troy', 'are', 'great', 'relationships', 'reflect', 'characters', 'Poe', 'encounters', 'Sam', 'Page', 'Casey', 'Woodland', 'A', 'thin', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'brought', 'back', 'Season', '2', 'Troy', 'budding', 'relationship', 'HPCU', 'investigator', 'Issac', 'Wright', 'dignified', 'Henry', 'Simmons', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'not', 'mention', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'Julie', 'Stark', 'decision', 'move', 'father', 'start', 'season', 'Sebastian', 'adjustments', 'having', 'worry', 'smart', 'charming', 'daughter', 'age', 'when', 'kids', 'get', 'trouble', 'grounds', 'Stark.Then', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'Jessica', 'Devlin', 'LA', 'District', 'Attorney', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'want', 'Stark', 'office', 'start', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'obviously', 'adversarial', 'contentious', 'relationship', 'start', 'mutual', 'respect', 'not', 'friendship', 'two', 'former', 'rivals', 'thrown', 'together', 'so', 'much', 'Devlin', 'when', 'DA', 'election', 'picked', 'Stark', 'save', 'case', 'thrown', 'course', 'seeing', 'Ryan', 'business', 'suits', 'wish', 'somehow', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'Masquerade', 'Party', 'scene', 'would', 'wear', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'catsuit', 'CAN', 'DREAM', 'CA', ""N'T"", '.The', 'high', 'points', 'season', 'are', 'two', 'Wayne', 'Callison', 'where', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'slick', 'serial', 'killer', 'Stark', 'radar', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'final', 'act', 'season', 'finale', 'how', 'far', 'Stark', 'willing', 'go', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'telling', 'ominous', 'moment', 'hear', 'what', 'bare-knuckles', 'defense', 'attorney-turned-prosecutor', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'get', 'even', 'Callison', 'not', 'just', 'beating', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'HOW', 'was', 'beaten', 'mention', 'Callison', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'beat', 'Stark', 'Wayne', 'World', 'Stark', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'defender', 'Wayne', 'World', 'II', 'look', 'Campbell', 'final', 'sequence', 'when', 'out', 'how', 'Stark', 'got', 'priceless.Make', 'mistake', 'Shark', 'James', 'Woods', 'vehicle', 'nicely']",N/A
