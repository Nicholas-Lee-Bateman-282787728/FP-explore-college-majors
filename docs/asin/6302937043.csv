346601,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302937043,Alex Udvary,"[20, 25]","Okay, when we think of Harold Lloyd we think of the famous image of him hanging onto the hands of a clock outside a building, right? Well, this is where the shot was taken from. ""Safety Last"" was one of the few Lloyd comedies I actually saw when I was younger. I mostly saw his short 2 and 3 reelers growing up. But, I happened to see ""Safety Last"" on tv yesterday. It's been about 15 years since I last saw, and I was still amazed.""Safety Last"" tells the story of a couple in love (Lloyd and Mildred Davis). Lloyd is going to become a big businessman so he can marry the girl of his dreams. As soon as he gets enough money he will send out for her to come. At best Lloyd gets a job as a salesman making $15 a week. In 1923 I'm guessing that was pretty good, but, even by those standards not enough to get married on. So, naturally like any man would do, he lies to his girlfriend pretending that he's doing much better than he actually is. He goes without eating so he can buy her a chain. He writes to her everyday of the week dreaming of the day they can be together.Feeling she has waited long enough for Lloyd, Davis decides it's time for her to go to him. Thus making things worst for him due to the fact she visits him at work! But, as fate would have it the department store where he is working is looking for a scheme to draw costumers. And Lloyd gets a great idea that will earn him $1,000!Okay, I feel I have to commet on the building climbing piece. It is one of the most daring scenes I have scene in comedy history. Now, I know that no harm came to Lloyd making shooting that scene. I know he survived the making of that scene and went on to make other movies, but, I became so caught in the moment that my heart was in my throat. I was sitting on the edge of my seat. Everytime it seemed as if Lloyd would fall off the buliding I jumped lol. I kept thinking to myself, ""Why did he do this?!"" ""How did he do this?!"" ""How did they shoot this scene?!!"" You forget that it's only a movie. because most of us know that Lloyd did his own stunts. It really is something everyone has to see.Would I say this is his ""best"" movie? No, to be honest I don't think so. Do I think it's one of his funniest? Sure. It's right up there. I also think it's one of the best comedies not only made in it's day, but of all-time. So go out and buy it.Bottom-line: Probably Lloyd's most famous movie due to the ""thrill"" scene at the end. One of the best comedies of all time.",4,One Of Lloyd's Best!,1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,2466,"['Okay', 'when', 'think', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'think', 'famous', 'image', 'hanging', 'hands', 'clock', 'building', 'right', 'Well', 'where', 'shot', 'was', 'taken', 'Safety', 'Last', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'Lloyd', 'comedies', 'actually', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'mostly', 'saw', 'short', '2', '3', 'reelers', 'growing', 'up', 'happened', 'see', 'Safety', 'Last', 'tv', 'yesterday', 'been', '15', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'was', 'still', 'amazed', 'Safety', 'Last', 'story', 'couple', 'love', 'Lloyd', 'Mildred', 'Davis', 'Lloyd', 'going', 'become', 'big', 'businessman', 'can', 'marry', 'girl', 'dreams', 'As', 'soon', 'enough', 'money', 'will', 'send', 'out', 'come', 'best', 'Lloyd', 'job', 'salesman', 'making', '15', 'week', '1923', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'standards', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'married', 'So', 'naturally', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'girlfriend', 'pretending', 'doing', 'much', 'better', 'actually', 'eating', 'so', 'can', 'buy', 'chain', 'everyday', 'week', 'dreaming', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'together.Feeling', 'waited', 'long', 'enough', 'Lloyd', 'Davis', 'time', 'go', 'Thus', 'making', 'things', 'worst', 'due', 'fact', 'work', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'working', 'looking', 'scheme', 'draw', 'costumers', 'Lloyd', 'great', 'idea', 'will', 'earn', '1,000', 'Okay', 'feel', 'have', 'commet', 'building', 'climbing', 'piece', 'one', 'most', 'daring', 'scenes', 'have', 'scene', 'comedy', 'history', 'Now', 'know', 'harm', 'came', 'Lloyd', 'making', 'shooting', 'scene', 'know', 'survived', 'making', 'scene', 'went', 'make', 'other', 'movies', 'became', 'so', 'caught', 'moment', 'heart', 'was', 'throat', 'was', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'Everytime', 'seemed', 'Lloyd', 'would', 'fall', 'off', 'buliding', 'jumped', 'lol', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'How', 'did', 'shoot', 'scene', 'forget', 'only', 'movie', 'most', 'know', 'Lloyd', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'really', 'something', 'everyone', 'see.Would', 'say', 'best', 'movie', 'No', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Do', 'think', 'one', 'funniest', 'Sure', 'right', 'there', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'day', 'all-time', 'So', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'it.Bottom-line', 'Probably', 'Lloyd', 'most', 'famous', 'movie', 'due', 'thrill', 'scene', 'end', 'One', 'best', 'comedies', 'time']",N/A
346602,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6302937043,Andrew McCaffrey,"[8, 11]","Harold Lloyd is &quot;The Boy&quot;, the typical character that Harold Lloyd played: spectacled, eager, fresh-faced, and up against the world.  Mildred Davis plays his dopey, but utterly loveable girlfriend.  SAFETY NOW encompasses much of what I now associate with Harold Lloyd films.  The stunt work is exciting and breathtaking, while the storytelling is funny, and sweet without being schmaltzy.SAFETY LAST is made up of two main segments.  The first is a collection of humorous set pieces set in and around a department store.  The Boy has gone off to the big city to make his fortune, promising to send for The Girl when he can afford their marriage.  Understandably, he has somewhat overstated his position; he only works as a clerk, but in an attempt to keep his girlfriend happy he has managed to make himself a senior manager in his correspondences.  The humorous situations that he gets into both trying to survive each day and keeping the truth from The Girl are very entertaining and amusing.The second major portion of SAFETY LAST is what the film is most famous for -- Harold Lloyd scaling the side of a tall building using no safety ropes, no nets, and no trick photography.  It is absolutely breathtaking, and utterly hilarious.  We know he isn't going to fall off when he comically teeters towards the edge, but I couldn't help but laugh at his quick footwork.One of the things that amused me most in retrospect was my own reaction to the building-climbing sequence.  Harold Lloyd has been dead for over thirty years now.  The film itself is eighty years old.  And I know enough about cinema history to realize that Harold Lloyd did not plunge to his death while filming the stunt sequences all that time ago.  Yet, I was watching the film with my knuckles turning ever whiter.  Whenever Lloyd stumbled, I jumped.  When he teeters towards the ledge in a seemingly uncontrolled fashion, I squealed.  Amazing that something like this can still have an impact on this member of the modern audience.  It's a real testament to Lloyd's talents to be able to pull off something like this.  And I don't just mean that the stunt-work is excellent (which it is), but that it can still reach across the years to me sitting in front of my television wondering how on Earth the actor managed to do that.SAFETY LAST was the first of Harold Lloyd's feature films that I was exposed to, and I really enjoyed the experience.  It's really a pity that Lloyd's name has faded from cinema history, as, from what I've seen, his films deserve the sort of treatment now afforded to Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin.  And they're certainly head and shoulders above much of what has been passed off as comedies in the years since the silent era died.",4,Harold Lloyd dangles,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,2742,"['Harold', 'Lloyd', 'quot', 'Boy', 'quot', 'typical', 'character', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'played', 'spectacled', 'eager', 'fresh-faced', 'up', 'world', 'Mildred', 'Davis', 'dopey', 'utterly', 'loveable', 'girlfriend', 'SAFETY', 'NOW', 'much', 'what', 'now', 'associate', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'films', 'stunt', 'work', 'exciting', 'breathtaking', 'storytelling', 'funny', 'sweet', 'being', 'schmaltzy.SAFETY', 'LAST', 'made', 'two', 'main', 'segments', 'first', 'collection', 'humorous', 'set', 'pieces', 'set', 'department', 'store', 'Boy', 'gone', 'off', 'big', 'city', 'make', 'fortune', 'promising', 'send', 'Girl', 'when', 'can', 'afford', 'marriage', 'Understandably', 'somewhat', 'overstated', 'position', 'only', 'clerk', 'attempt', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'happy', 'managed', 'make', 'senior', 'manager', 'correspondences', 'humorous', 'situations', 'trying', 'survive', 'day', 'keeping', 'truth', 'Girl', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'amusing.The', 'second', 'major', 'portion', 'SAFETY', 'LAST', 'what', 'film', 'most', 'famous', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'scaling', 'side', 'tall', 'building', 'using', 'safety', 'nets', 'trick', 'photography', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'know', ""n't"", 'going', 'fall', 'off', 'when', 'comically', 'edge', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'quick', 'footwork.One', 'things', 'amused', 'most', 'retrospect', 'was', 'own', 'reaction', 'building-climbing', 'sequence', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'been', 'dead', 'thirty', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'eighty', 'years', 'old', 'know', 'enough', 'cinema', 'history', 'realize', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'did', 'not', 'plunge', 'death', 'filming', 'stunt', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'knuckles', 'turning', 'ever', 'whiter', 'Whenever', 'Lloyd', 'stumbled', 'jumped', 'When', 'ledge', 'seemingly', 'uncontrolled', 'fashion', 'squealed', 'Amazing', 'something', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'impact', 'member', 'modern', 'audience', 'real', 'testament', 'Lloyd', 'talents', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'stunt-work', 'excellent', 'can', 'still', 'reach', 'years', 'sitting', 'front', 'television', 'wondering', 'how', 'Earth', 'actor', 'managed', 'do', 'that.SAFETY', 'LAST', 'was', 'first', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'feature', 'was', 'exposed', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'really', 'pity', 'Lloyd', 'name', 'faded', 'cinema', 'history', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'deserve', 'sort', 'treatment', 'now', 'afforded', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'head', 'shoulders', 'much', 'what', 'been', 'passed', 'off', 'comedies', 'years', 'silent', 'era', 'died']",N/A
346603,A3CJKTAXF2JT1,6302937043,Classic Movie Lady,"[0, 0]","There have been many times that I have seen the iconic photo of silent film legend, Harold Lloyd (1883-1971), dangling precariously from a large clock, but I had never taken the time to actually see the film that this photo came from.  I was born in the 1960s, and by then, films had sound, were in color, and movie theaters had wide screens.  I knew about silent films, but because they had only captioned dialog, and were often filmed in grainy black and white, I never thought that I could ever really enjoy them.I was wrong.  Released in 1923 ""Safety Last"" was and is a silent film masterpiece.  Harold Lloyd was a master of slapstick comedy.  As an influence for future slapstick comedy stars such as Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and The Marx Bros, he was right up there with Charles Chaplin, and Buster Keaton.  In spite of the many dangerous situations and conditions that he filmed in, Lloyd never used stuntmen in his movies.The plot of this film is quite simple.  A young man from the country goes to the city to ""make good"" so he can impress his girl and win her hand in marriage.  After reading his letters, his girl looks him up in the city.  She finds him, but he tells her that he is a manager of a busy department store even though he is a lowly clerk.  The climax of the film is when he is unwittingly compelled to climb to the roof of the department store.The actress who plays his girl in the film is the stunning Mildred Davis (1901-1969), who would become Harold Lloyd's real-life wife.  She was one of the most beautiful women of the silent film era.So if you are a silent film fan, or want to get a real taste of classic film history.  Get this film for your collection.

346604,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302937043,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[43, 47]","Although he is generally considered the equal of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd's films are much less widely available--with the exception of SAFETY LAST, which turns up with great regularity at film festivals and on cable television. Like most of his films, SAFETY LAST finds Lloyd struggling to make good in order to win the girl of his dreams (in this case his actual wife, actress Mildred Davis)--and when the big boss offers a thousand dollars for a promotional idea that will draw hundreds to the store, Lloyd suggests a human fly act... but at the last minute circumstances go awry, leaving Lloyd to make the climb himself.While the first half of the film abounds in brilliant, hilarious sight gags, it is Lloyd's climb up the skyscraper that is best remembered: attacked by pigeons, entangled in a net, running afoul of a mouse, and ultimately hanging from the hands of a clock face hundreds of feet above a cheering crowd.  Filmed without stunt-doubles or such devices as rear-screen projection, the squirm effect of the sequence is still tremendous--and the film is all the funnier for it.  Always wearing his signature straw hat and round-frame glasses, Lloyd's eager optimism personified the go-getter mentality of the 1920s, when the sky seemed the limit and progress hadn't yet gone on too long.  If you are a fan of silent film but have not yet encountered Harold Lloyd, SAFETY LAST is the perfect introduction--and an essential for your collection.",5,One of the Silent Era's Greatest Comedies,1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,1481,"['generally', 'considered', 'equal', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'widely', 'available', 'exception', 'SAFETY', 'LAST', 'up', 'great', 'regularity', 'film', 'festivals', 'cable', 'television', 'most', 'films', 'SAFETY', 'LAST', 'Lloyd', 'struggling', 'make', 'good', 'order', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'case', 'actual', 'wife', 'actress', 'Mildred', 'Davis', 'when', 'big', 'boss', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'promotional', 'idea', 'will', 'draw', 'hundreds', 'store', 'Lloyd', 'human', 'fly', 'act', 'last', 'minute', 'circumstances', 'go', 'awry', 'leaving', 'Lloyd', 'make', 'climb', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'sight', 'gags', 'Lloyd', 'climb', 'skyscraper', 'best', 'remembered', 'attacked', 'pigeons', 'entangled', 'net', 'running', 'afoul', 'mouse', 'ultimately', 'hanging', 'hands', 'clock', 'face', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'Filmed', 'stunt-doubles', 'such', 'devices', 'rear-screen', 'projection', 'squirm', 'effect', 'sequence', 'still', 'tremendous', 'film', 'funnier', 'wearing', 'signature', 'round-frame', 'glasses', 'Lloyd', 'eager', 'optimism', 'personified', 'go-getter', 'mentality', '1920s', 'when', 'sky', 'seemed', 'limit', 'progress', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'gone', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'fan', 'silent', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'encountered', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'SAFETY', 'LAST', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'essential', 'collection']",N/A
346605,AT04V4H3AO3T5,6302937043,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[7, 9]","Anyone who knows anything about cinematic history knows that the payoff in SAFETY LAST is Harold Lloyd's harrowing and comedic exploits hanging from the hands of a clock on the side of a building high above the city streets. As many times as I had seen excerpts from that sequence in various places, I had never seen the movie in its entirety until now.Harold Lloyd was a comic genius. The story is simple enough--boy goes to the big city; boy lies to girl about how well he is doing; girl comes to the city to surprise boy--but the movie is so rich in site gags that it is truly enjoyable throughout. Because this is a silent film, the comedy is physical and universal and appealing even to the jaded sensibilities of the present day.Lloyd plays ""The Boy,"" a fresh-faced country lad who bids ""The Girl"" (Mildred Davis) farewell in order to pursue his dreams of riches in the city. When he arrives, however, he lands a job as a lowly sales clerk, and it is a daily struggle for him to avoid being fired. Bill Strother plays ""The Pal,"" The Boy's roommate and compatriot in misery. The Pal, as a construction worker, has a talent for scaling tall buildings. When The Boy's boss offers $1000 to anyone who can draw shoppers to the department store, The Boy proposes a human fly stunt (by The Pal) to bring in the crowds. Unfortunately, The Boy unintentionally draws the ire of ""The Law"" (Noah Young) onto The Pal. As the time for the stunt draws near, The Boy needs to start climbing, at least until The Pal is able to shake The Law.Even after seeing excerpts from this scene hundreds of times, the clock-hanging sequence in SAFETY LAST is utterly breathtaking, more so when you consider that (evidently) no special effects or trick photography was used in the filming. The impact of this scene, therefore, is so much more powerful than any analogous scene in a modern film could ever be.SAFETY LAST is a classic and important film in the history of cinema, but one that is surprisingly accessible today, considering its age. It should certainly be part of any serious film buff's video library.Jeremy W.
