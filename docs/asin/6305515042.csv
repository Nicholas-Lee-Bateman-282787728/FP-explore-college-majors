I miss those older shows and wish that they would put them back on the air. I am glad that this movie was avaialble on Amazon.

468064,AETU6WZAUMX53,6305515042,"J. Perez ""Wrestle Dude""","[2, 3]",The whole cast is bland & boring and so is the story itself. It's like watching the Captain Planet show. The female mayor does little-to-nothing to help Doug and the lake monster or even stopping the villain for that matter. The lake monster is bland & forgettable at best. It's like a very long bad episode:too long for it's own good. It has a ton of stupid moments like dressing the lake monster as a girl. How can anyone not see that the girl is really the lake monster? It also has weird plot points. The only likeable cast member in the whole film is the Robot Nanny. The animation itself is not great but pretty good. I give this film a 1 out of 10.,1,Doug's First & thankfully Last Movie,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,655,"['whole', 'cast', 'bland', 'boring', 'so', 'story', 'watching', 'Captain', 'Planet', 'show', 'female', 'mayor', 'little-to-nothing', 'help', 'Doug', 'lake', 'monster', 'even', 'stopping', 'villain', 'matter', 'lake', 'monster', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'best', 'very', 'long', 'bad', 'episode', 'too', 'long', 'own', 'good', 'ton', 'stupid', 'moments', 'dressing', 'lake', 'monster', 'girl', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'not', 'see', 'girl', 'really', 'lake', 'monster', 'also', 'weird', 'plot', 'points', 'only', 'likeable', 'cast', 'member', 'whole', 'film', 'Robot', 'Nanny', 'animation', 'not', 'great', 'pretty', 'good', 'give', 'film', '1', '10']",Doug's 1st Movie VHS
468065,A11CG3PVYX5EWV,6305515042,Kid's Movie Lover,"[5, 5]","I loved this movie. I'm very upset that they no longer make it because that means alot of people wont be able to see it! It was great. You don't have to be a close follower of the show to like it. Doug and his pal Skeeter have always thought that there was something living in the polluted Lucky Duck Lake. But when they actually find the monster that lives there, it turns out to be more than they can handel. Patty, Doug's love intrest, is always hanging around with an upper classman who works with her on decorating for the valentines day dance. When Doug tries to tell Patty about the monster, she accuses him of lying. Whats worse is that Mr. Bluff, the owner of Doug's hometown, Bluffington, wants to capture the monster so that there is no proof that he has polluted Lucky Duck Lake. Now doug has to save his monster friend, get Patty back on his side, and save the day! You would love it if you saw it.

468066,A1PH5WKMM0FM2S,6305515042,S. A. Hanson,"[1, 3]","This film has been treated unfairly with the critics. They say that it is a bland riff on &quot;E.T.&quot; It isn't! Not half as much as &quot;Mac and Me&quot;. This really so much like the real story of Sasquatch  (&quot;wild man of the woods&quot;) or &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. They see traces  of him. They take a pcture of him. And even find his footprints. I beleive  that Bigfoot is some undiscovered decendent of the Gigantapithicis. And the  Loch Ness Monster is (now, you may turn pale, if you like) a surviving  DINOSAUR! And So what if the people all have blue, green, purple and orange  skin and speak in either monotone or whiny voices. And it IS very funny!
