It is worth every penny. The animation is very good, pleasing to watch. Most of the stories are originals, that somehow fill in back story or tell stories about characters in the series that you did not know about before. For instance, there is a story about Sam's fiance, as a child, she was at a sleep over where the kids summoned Bloody Mary. Then 10 years later to the day, while in college, her friends each start dying off. Sam meets her during this time, with all the craziness of her friends being killed. Then there is a lot of back story with their father, John. Some of the hunting that John and Dean were doing while Sam was going to school, etc. I guess if I had to complain about anything, it would be that the stories are only about 30mins long each.

But when I heard they were making an anime based on the first couple seasons, my interest was piqued -- and the resulting series is a dark, eerie one with golden-eyed demons, splatters of blood, and supernatural mysteries aplenty. The one major downside: at times it feels like you need to have seen the live series to understand what's going on.Sam and Dean Winchester wander through the U.S., searching for their father and/or supernatural incidents that they can deal with (preferably before anyone gets hurt). Also, they're searching for whatever killed their mother and Sam's first love, Jessica.Among the things they investigate: a lake monster, a murderous shapeshifter, a girl who may be a werewolf, a troubled young boy with a strange father, a bad luck demon, killer ghosts on a country road, mysterious fires at the old Winchester home, flashbacks to an encounter with ""Bloody Mary,"" the serial-killings of blonde women, an abused boy with a strange power, and others.But they soon discover that a devil -- a golden-eyed demon -- is following them, and he is linked to Sam and others with similar powers. When they reunite with their estranged father, they discover that there is only one thing that can stop that demon.""Supernatural: The Anime Series"" is a very dark series: lots of blood, graphic violence, and quite frequently the Winchester boys aren't able to save the people who need it most. Even the lighter episodes -- such as the lake monster episode, or the bad-luck-in-Vegas story -- have some dark undertones, and we never forget that the Winchesters are being faced with demonic evil.It's even animated darkly -- the sleek, realistic animation is painted in bleak greys, dusty reds and browns, with lots of shadows. The color that sticks out the most is a vibrant red, whether it's blood or something blood-colored.And while this series was made in Japan, the people who produced it really grasped the dusty, wild feel of the western half of the U.S., but weaved in a lot of eerie supernatural happenings that are genuinely scary (like the black-hole eyes on possessed people). The biggest problem is that sometimes I felt like I was missing something because I hadn't watched the live-action series.A lot of the character development is lavished on Sam, his angst over the loss of Jessica, his burgeoning psychic powers, and his importance to the golden-eyed demon. Comparatively, Dean's character development is mostly that he's a goofy flirt/buttkicking warrior, and that he promised to take care of his baby brother long ago. As for the voice acting, it's a little clumsy in the first episode, but Jared Padalecki and... whoever plays Dean settle nicely into their roles.I can't compare it very much to the original series, but ""Supernatural: The Anime Series"" stands pretty well on its own feet.

I signed up with Amazon to buy it as soon as it was released and for good reason.  The whole ""Supernatural"" (SPN) anime project is the first of its kind -- no other current, live American television show has been animated before. If you are a fan of either the live or anime entertainment genres -- or both --you will love this superb addition to your SPN collection.Season 7 of ""Supernatural"" will premier on September 23, 2011, over The CW Network.  This Mad House-produced anime is based upon Seasons 1 and 2, and while covering the known, live-action story lines, it also contains some really great original episodes (back stories, usually), as well as some interesting variations that are surprising and enjoyable. It will carry SPN fans through the long wait for Season 7 with ""style and grace,"" not to mention a lot of fun!The animation itself is superb in my opinion; it is a unique and special improvement on the usual Japanese anime or ""manga"" -- with jaw-dropping, guts-and-gore effects that are big and graphic, coupled with lyrically beautiful color, contrast, detail, and backgrounds worthy of a Hiroshige print.Jared Padalecki voices ""Sam"" for all 22 episodes; Jensen Ackles voices ""Dean"" in Episodes 21 and 22 (""All Hell Freezes Over, Parts I and II"").  Andrew Farrar is ""Dean"" for Episodes 1 through 20, and he does a credible job. Best part is that Jensen and Jared personally introduce each episode, sometimes as a team, but most often singly.The 3-disk set contains lots of special features, but the most fun are interviews with creator Eric Kripke and with Jared and Jensen -- either singly or together. The back office work done by Mad House is also very interesting.  All of the principals involved in this project are able to give full accounts of how the SPN anime project came to be and what they think of it.  The special features should not be ignored.Enjoy the ""Supernatural"" anime; I sure did!",5,"Unique, Great Addition to Supernatural Collection!",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,1990,"['Supernatural', 'Anime', 'Series', 'well-worth', 'owning', 'believe', 'signed', 'up', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'good', 'reason', 'whole', 'Supernatural', 'SPN', 'anime', 'project', 'first', 'kind', 'other', 'current', 'live', 'American', 'television', 'show', 'been', 'animated', 'are', 'fan', 'live', 'anime', 'entertainment', 'genres', 'will', 'love', 'superb', 'addition', 'SPN', 'collection.Season', '7', 'Supernatural', 'will', 'premier', 'September', '23', '2011', 'CW', 'Network', 'Mad', 'House-produced', 'anime', 'based', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'covering', 'known', 'live-action', 'story', 'lines', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'original', 'episodes', 'back', 'stories', 'usually', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'variations', 'are', 'surprising', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'carry', 'SPN', 'fans', 'long', 'wait', 'Season', '7', 'style', 'grace', 'not', 'mention', 'lot', 'fun', 'animation', 'superb', 'opinion', 'unique', 'special', 'improvement', 'usual', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'manga', 'jaw-dropping', 'guts-and-gore', 'effects', 'are', 'big', 'graphic', 'coupled', 'lyrically', 'beautiful', 'color', 'contrast', 'detail', 'worthy', 'Hiroshige', 'print.Jared', 'Padalecki', 'voices', 'Sam', '22', 'episodes', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Dean', 'Episodes', '21', '22', 'Hell', 'Freezes', 'Over', 'Parts', 'II', 'Andrew', 'Farrar', 'Dean', 'Episodes', '1', '20', 'credible', 'job', 'Best', 'part', 'Jensen', 'Jared', 'personally', 'introduce', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'team', 'most', 'often', 'singly.The', '3-disk', 'set', 'contains', 'lots', 'special', 'features', 'most', 'fun', 'are', 'interviews', 'creator', 'Eric', 'Kripke', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'singly', 'together', 'back', 'office', 'work', 'done', 'Mad', 'House', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'principals', 'involved', 'project', 'are', 'able', 'give', 'full', 'accounts', 'how', 'SPN', 'anime', 'project', 'came', 'be', 'what', 'think', 'special', 'features', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'ignored.Enjoy', 'Supernatural', 'anime', 'sure', 'did']",N/A

1430007,A1Z1UXUEBEY1AM,B004VLLWA6,"J. Szekely ""Hellsbane""","[1, 1]",The very first thing you will notice is this is not a 5 star review. What is holding this back is the lack of Jensen Eckles. The fact that he is not doing the voice of Dean for all but the last two episodes is a bit distracting. If you are a big fan of Supernatural you will also notice that a lot of the episodes feel very familiar where I was wishing for a little bit more new content. One other minor complaint is the treatment of Bobby. He was kind of a fat little annoying man instead of the Heroicly awesome father figure that kept the Winchester Boys on the right path all these years.

1430011,A11S26M1MUM7O7,B004VLLWA6,Neil Ford,"[29, 33]","As a major fan of both anime and Supernatural, I had high hopes for this series. I sat down to watch it with a smile on my face and hope in my heart. I held onto these as long as I could, but after a few episodes I had to be honest with myself, and face up to my disappointment.This anime doesn't capture anything of the feeling of Supernatural. The colours are garish. The music is cheesy and inappropriate. The acting has no subtlety (unlike most reviewers here, I listened to the Japanese audio). There is none of the affection for the characters that you'd expect from the live action series. There is no wry low-key humour. Dean is now a cry-baby, and Bobby, for no good reason, is a short fat clean-shaven nebbish instead of a cool cracker with a beard. John is a mean SOB, with beard and hat. Only Sam still resembles the live-action character.This isn't just a case of me not being able to accept Supernatural in a new format. Purely as anime, this show is also mediocre. In the featurette, the Japanese directors say they hired a TV writer because they didn't want the usual anime writing. Cut to a story conference in which the writer is fighting to get in ONE LINE that will give the monster of the week some sort of motivation. If you watch that episode (Alter Ego, the remake of Skin), you'll see that he did not get the line in.But the writing in general is poor. The plots are simplistic (and the plots of the ""anime originals"" are in fact mostly derived from pre-existing episodes). The directors say this is because of the short episode length, but anime fans will know that plenty of story and character can be fitted into the standard 23 minutes. When the dialog is not just blandly generic, Sam and Dean engage in awful gag-based banter (apparently cartoon Sam just HATES being called Sammy - hilarious!). Thankfully, the wacky attempts at humour mostly disappear about halfway through the series (after the one effective episode, which doesn't even feature Sam and Dean), making the show more tolerable, but still not actually good.What would a better anime version of Supernatural have looked like? Maybe a bit like Stand Alone Complex, or Witch Hunter Robin, or even Boogiepop Phantom, but obviously with a bit more ironic humour. Instead we get something that can only only lower the reputation of anime in the West, and of Supernatural in the East. A stupid, cheesy cartoon for kids. An embarrassment to both Kripke's show and the anime industry.I realise that writing such a negative review will garner a few unhelpful votes. I thought long and hard before writing this, and giving what I believe is my lowest ever Amazon review score. I'm only doing this because I want people to have an alternative to the relentlessly positive reviews here. Obviously, if you are a hardcore Supernatural fan, you will have to buy this series. I understand that. I just want you to be aware of what you are getting into, before you get your hopes too high, like I did, and then suffer a terrible disappointment.",1,"It's not Supernatural, and it's not good anime",1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,3022,"['major', 'fan', 'anime', 'Supernatural', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'series', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'smile', 'face', 'hope', 'heart', 'held', 'onto', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'few', 'episodes', 'had', 'be', 'honest', 'face', 'up', 'disappointment.This', 'anime', ""n't"", 'capture', 'anything', 'feeling', 'Supernatural', 'colours', 'are', 'garish', 'music', 'cheesy', 'inappropriate', 'acting', 'subtlety', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'listened', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'none', 'affection', 'characters', ""'d"", 'expect', 'live', 'action', 'series', 'wry', 'low-key', 'humour', 'Dean', 'now', 'cry-baby', 'Bobby', 'good', 'reason', 'short', 'fat', 'clean-shaven', 'nebbish', 'instead', 'cool', 'cracker', 'beard', 'John', 'mean', 'SOB', 'beard', 'hat', 'Only', 'Sam', 'still', 'live-action', 'character.This', ""n't"", 'just', 'case', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'accept', 'Supernatural', 'new', 'format', 'Purely', 'anime', 'show', 'also', 'mediocre', 'featurette', 'Japanese', 'directors', 'say', 'hired', 'TV', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'usual', 'anime', 'writing', 'Cut', 'story', 'conference', 'writer', 'fighting', 'get', 'ONE', 'LINE', 'will', 'give', 'monster', 'week', 'sort', 'motivation', 'watch', 'episode', 'Alter', 'Ego', 'remake', 'Skin', ""'ll"", 'see', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'line', 'writing', 'general', 'poor', 'plots', 'are', 'simplistic', 'plots', 'anime', 'originals', 'are', 'fact', 'mostly', 'derived', 'pre-existing', 'episodes', 'directors', 'say', 'short', 'episode', 'length', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'plenty', 'story', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'fitted', 'standard', '23', 'minutes', 'When', 'dialog', 'not', 'just', 'blandly', 'generic', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'engage', 'awful', 'gag-based', 'banter', 'apparently', 'Sam', 'just', 'HATES', 'being', 'called', 'Sammy', 'hilarious', 'Thankfully', 'wacky', 'attempts', 'humour', 'mostly', 'disappear', 'halfway', 'series', 'one', 'effective', 'episode', ""n't"", 'even', 'feature', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'making', 'show', 'more', 'tolerable', 'still', 'not', 'actually', 'good.What', 'would', 'better', 'anime', 'version', 'Supernatural', 'have', 'looked', 'Maybe', 'bit', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Complex', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'even', 'Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'obviously', 'bit', 'more', 'ironic', 'humour', 'Instead', 'get', 'something', 'can', 'only', 'only', 'lower', 'reputation', 'anime', 'West', 'Supernatural', 'East', 'stupid', 'cheesy', 'cartoon', 'kids', 'embarrassment', 'Kripke', 'show', 'anime', 'industry.I', 'realise', 'writing', 'negative', 'review', 'will', 'garner', 'few', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'thought', 'long', 'hard', 'writing', 'giving', 'what', 'believe', 'lowest', 'ever', 'Amazon', 'review', 'score', ""'m"", 'only', 'doing', 'want', 'people', 'have', 'alternative', 'relentlessly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'Obviously', 'are', 'hardcore', 'Supernatural', 'fan', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'series', 'understand', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'get', 'hopes', 'too', 'high', 'did', 'then', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'disappointment']",N/A

After watching the first two discs I must admit I am both pleased and surprised by how well the animated version of the show is pulled off. So let's start off with the many positives of the show. First should be obvious since with animation the show has fewer limitations and can pull of some really cool scenes and monsters/demons etc. Another huge plus of this anime are the original anime episodes, the remakes of the live action are pretty good to though, but the anime exclusive episodes really make this dvd worth while. If I had any minor gripes with the series it is that the way episodes are condensed it seems like that sometimes the emotional aspect of the live action is a little lacking. Also at times if you have not seen the live action some of the things happening in the anime will be a little confusing.

The idea of turning Supernatural into an anime was, for me, a wonderful and natural idea.  Being able to release the world of Supernatural from the limits of a live action budget opens so many possibilities.  But, I feel it was wasted here.While it is visually powerful at times, it is not the level of stunning, awe inspiring, demonic fury that it could and should have been.  It is far to vanilla, too airbrushed, too safe.  This is an excellent example of popular anime but there is nothing special about it.  It does not push boundaries, at all.  I feel Supernatural was a rule breaker and the anime should have been as well.While this anime did not fall prey to what in my opinion kills so many others, that being heartless crap music, the music most often used was ""Carry On Wayward Son"".  A good choice but as a diehard fan of Supernatural, that one is ONLY used for the season's climax.  I am thankful that some garbage pop track was not used but that one is too special to get the use it got.  That said, I do understand why someone would select that track.  I just disagree with how it is used.The stories were interesting.  Twelve of them are based on episodes of the live action show.  I did not know it would be that many.  I think six or eight would have been enough.  Even the ""original"" stories took elements from episodes just not as much.  I would have liked more new stories.  Having these appear to be stories that happened in between episodes of the live action show would have been more appealing to me and I think it would have drawn anime fans to the live action show.Ok, Dean's voice...Yes, Jensen Ackles did not do most of the voice work for Dean.  Yes I noticed it.  I tried really hard not to dwell on it but it was very difficult to get around.  I missed Jensen and having Jared Padalecki in every episode, while wonderful, only emphasized the fact that we really didn't get our favorite brothers together.Overall, this is a solid example of popular anime.
