I was actually interested enough to make a point to see the end. The movie starts out quite promising. Nichole Kidman is really great in this type of role(See also THE OTHERS). Maybe her encounters with Scientologists prepared her well for the role? The film is a little creepy and does succeed in engaging the viewer, or this one anyway. Upon viewing the ending the response it universly received was understandable.But I went in with the lowest of expectations and managed to enjoy most of this arguably (somewhat) decent sci-fi flick marred by a very lame, unsatisfying ending. So, here's to low expectations.But on the other hand I'm always against having low expectations in films. That's what most people do when they say, ""It's just a movie"" blah, blah, blah.. And I think we should have standards. Maybe, have low expectations for a film that sucks so you can enjoy it for what it's worth while at the same time freely acknowledging it sucks.",2,The Remake,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,1020,"['Saw', 'part', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'resolution', 'was', 'actually', 'interested', 'enough', 'make', 'point', 'see', 'end', 'movie', 'out', 'quite', 'promising', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'really', 'great', 'type', 'role', 'See', 'also', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'Maybe', 'encounters', 'Scientologists', 'prepared', 'well', 'role', 'film', 'little', 'creepy', 'succeed', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'one', 'anyway', 'viewing', 'ending', 'response', 'universly', 'received', 'was', 'understandable.But', 'went', 'lowest', 'expectations', 'managed', 'enjoy', 'most', 'arguably', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'marred', 'very', 'lame', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'So', 'here', 'low', 'expectations.But', 'other', 'hand', ""'m"", 'always', 'having', 'low', 'expectations', 'films', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'when', 'say', 'just', 'movie', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah..', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'standards', 'Maybe', 'have', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', 'worth', 'same', 'time', 'freely', 'acknowledging']",The Invasion
657561,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B00005JPUN,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","What if we were invaded and no one noticed?The idea of aliens taking over our bodies and then continue civilization as we know it but only without wars and heated arguments probably comes from the 50's Cold War. The Body Snatchers is the 'bottom up' alternative to the top-down Manchurian Candidate, the strategic goal being the same: 'they' take over our minds and 'we' end up with this regimented, full-consensus, beehive-like arrangement. I can see how the prospect would be terrifying to the freedom-loving citizenry in the 50's or the 60's. Better dead than Red. Right?By the third millennium, the fears have subsided and those 'we' used to admiringly call 'rugged individualists' we call 'extremists' or 'lunatics' now. The Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, lacking adequate health coverage. We are not bees in a hive just yet but the wisdom of moving in that direction is at least debatable and it's viewed as a mainstream topic.The impression of this remake, while watching it, could be ""what's so bad about it""? We live in times where anyone caught with 'water' while boarding a plane is a potentially dangerous enemy. Airports metal-detecting checkpoints post warnings on not telling jokes about things that go 'boom' or risk prosecution and water-boarding. The radio broadcasts commercials on ""click it or ticket"" and the subways have posters urging patriotic activities such as ""see something, say something"" - if you are planning to take the New York subway be prepared to have your bags checked.And... here they come... these dangerous aliens are taking over our bodies and are turning us all into... obedient, cooperative, responsible citizens who recycle, show up for work on time and never cross the street while the ""Don't Walk"" sign is flashing. We see the police chasing people because their faces express emotions - think of the airport cameras programmed to flag such individuals as possible dangerous elements or think of the New York City subway code of conduct. We hear that the war in Iraq just ended, the Middle East is finally at peace, everyone flushes only once and all follow the rules... what's not to like? See the irony?On the surface, it's a semi-bad remake of an old classic and that was my exact impression after the first viewing. Then, I watched it again and I saw a little bit more in this movie. The general idea is that maybe we are trending 'there' anyway and, give it another 50 years and, if 'the invasion' came then, it would probably go unnoticed and it might be unneeded. You either stay awake and vigilant at all times, you make no compromises other than doing what it takes to blend and go unnoticed or you are assimilated and all your worries go away.And, then, there's Nicole.I took one star because of the slight Hollywoodization but maybe that's the price to pay if you want your movie to be viewed by people other than your friends and the inhabitants of So-Ho.If you are to watch this movie, I suggest that you plan about watching it twice.",4,Invasion?

That was probably the nastiest part of this story.I did like, however, how amongst all of the ""zombies"" were people who weren't infected and helped Nicole's character along the way.

657564,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B00005JPUN,ajsteele,"[2, 2]","Well, the release date has been played around with a few times, not that that hurts it. Todays the 29th and its out. The 3 prior body snatcher movies were excellent and really did somehow intertwine the social feelings of each era in which they were released. They were all very impactive in that sense. This current film which uses all the body snatcher cliches to the hilt, misses the excellent chance of fully capitalizing on a post 9/11 worldview. A few backround tv scenes covering world events was an overly overt attempt at putting a sociological stamp on this version. It mostly failed.I dont feel its important for me to rehash the storyline because everyone(except for one reviewer living under a rock)knows the premise of a 'body snatcher' film. I bought the film in HD expecting to see at minimal some thought provoking ideas. So much was left out that could have been interjected in a concrete way. What I'm trying to point out is the missed opportunity of capturing our CURRENT era, and all that comes with it. I have to admit though, when this film is looked back on several years from now it might show some distinctions. Can we get away from the immune child notion? Its a sort of forced storyline to invoke heartfelt compassion. In turn, those scenes looked just short of a big tv movie. Important fact; body snatcher movies NEED PODS. Very cool techniques could have been employed with pods these days. Vomiting on individuals was disease oriented but came off a little silly. Their was some jumping around in the film that did't quite fit. Trying to show you one scene ahead with the action while they were in another totally messed up as far as editing.I wanted to like it, and their were some good parts. The changing bodies were realistic, but I was surprised their weren't more scenes that could have been creatively played with in regards to them. Nichole Kidman was decent and she had the proper look of confusion in the beginning. Her subway chase was alright. Daniel Craig was completely miscast and seemed to be walking through it. As a trivia point, Kidmans first patient is the actress Veronica Cartwright who was in the 1978 remake version. Unfortunately her speaking role was almost a duplicate of that version.The sci-fi idea of aliens attacking us and removing our true core is great stuff. Its such good stuff that I really expected more in this age of film making.

That being said, I didn't see the original so I have nothing to compare this movie to.The film opens with a very frantic Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) rummaging through the shelves of a pharmacy searching for sleep suppressants.  We are then taken back in a recent past where a space shuttle crash lands into the countryside.  From the moment that Bennell's ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) pricks his fingers on a foreign organism, life becomes a serious drag for the human species.  Bennell, who is a psychiatrist, doesn't get it at first when one of her patients irately claims her husband isn't her husband.  But it doesn't take long before Bennell figured out that all is not right.This could have been an excellent film, but as is all too often the case these days, character development was not a priority. Beyond Kidman, character development was non-existent. How people are being snatched, also, is never adequately, not even remotely explained.This was NOT a forgettable movie, rather quite memorable.

But this doesn't really make sense. Let's draw out the conclusion, shall we? The zombies still need to eat, which means that they still need to have resources like food and, therefore, money. Hence, there will still be a power struggle. Will there still be homeless people? Will there be presidents?So is the movie suggesting that the kind of communism or even socialism so desired by liberals won't work? Is that the main point?

657582,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPUN,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","There have been four film adaptations of Jack Finney's novel ""The Body Snatchers."" The first and most famous was Walter Wanger's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" released in 1956 and starring Kevin McCarthy. This was followed by Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake, after which came ""Body Snatchers,"" a spin off film released in 1993. Clearly, this story has gotten a lot of mileage, and if future filmmakers aren't careful, it's only going to wear itself out. This is why I was nervous about the latest adaptation, ""The Invasion""; I would be watching a completely unoriginal film with a predictable story. I went to the theater fully expecting to be disappointed. Then a funny thing happened--I got into it. And by the time I left, I realized that I actually enjoyed it.""The Invasion"" is a rehash, but at the very least, it's a well-made rehash. This is a taut, suspenseful, creepy science fiction thriller that can put the audience in an uncomfortable place. All versions of this story play on our fears of identity loss, namely how humanity is gradually being replaced by an alien species. This new film adds an original twist; instead of clone-producing pods, a microscopic organism invades the body like a virus and reprograms the mind. In order for the transformation to occur, the infected person must fall asleep. The film opens with Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) in a trashed pharmacy. Dazed, frightened, and losing control, she searches for medications to keep her awake. Why this is happening, we don't yet know. All we do know is that, as she does this, something is trying to force its way through a locked door.The film then flashes back to the events leading up to this scene. The invasion begins when a space shuttle breaks apart when reentering the atmosphere. Dozens of pieces land in various parts of the United States. As would be expected, many curious spectators try to take a small piece for themselves. What they don't know is that the hull of the shuttle is contaminated with some kind of organism; not long after the crash, people start to behave strangely, something that can only be attributed to a new strain of the flu. And it's rapidly spreading.As all this is being established, Bennell is properly introduced as a divorced psychiatrist living in Washington, D.C. She begins to suspect something is wrong when her patient, Wendy Lenk (Veronica Cartwright, in an homage to her role in the 1978 film), confides that her husband is no longer her husband. He doesn't scream or hit, even when she does. He killed their dog. He always offers her something to drink. Such odd behavior is popping up all over the city, and pretty soon, random people stare at Bennell with blank yet horrifying expressions. Even her ex-husband, Tucker (Jeremy Northam), seems to have been affected. She rightfully feels nervous about letting her son, Oliver (Jackson Bond), stay with him, especially since he frequently wakes up screaming from fever-induced nightmares.After a while, it becomes obvious that a full-blown pandemic has hit the nations of the world. Bennell seeks the help of Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), two doctors who might be able to isolate and define the virus. As they try to do their research, the infected are continuing to spread the alien virus, both by setting up phony inoculation centers and by vomiting on their victims. At this point, Bennell focuses solely on finding her son, who remains stuck with his transformed father. She knows Oliver is in terrible danger. What she has yet to discover is that, because of a childhood disease, Oliver may be the key to eradicating the alien virus.In the midst of all this tension, the film takes an interesting turn by forcing us to question the true nature of the virus: Could it, in fact, be offering humanity the promise of peace? Is it worth losing our individuality if it means an end to war, violence, and hate? I have to admit; it sounds pretty tempting, considering the age we live in. The filmmakers seemed well aware of this, as seen during a news report announcing a peace agreement between North Korea and Iran. A welcome turn of events, no question. But at what cost? At one point, Bennell and a Russian diplomat engage in a very thought provoking conversation about the nature of humanity; history has shown that humans are aggressive in nature, and to lose that aggression is to lose all that is human. It isn't my place to agree or disagree with this line of reasoning. I will say that, if the diplomat is right, then we have some serious work to do.The film's major weakness is its final thirty minutes, which was reportedly rewritten by the Wachowski Brothers and re-shot by director James McTeigue. Indeed, moments of ""The Invasion"" do seem tacked on and awkward, such as a couple of car chase sequences. Nonetheless, I was taken by the general direction of the story, and I give a lot of praise to credited director Oliver Hirschbiegel for crafting some genuinely frightening moments. In general, I liked this movie. Why, I'm not entirely sure; I'm usually the first to criticize a film for being unoriginal. But this time, I didn't really care.",4,Alien Nation,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,5173,"['have', 'been', 'four', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Jack', 'Finney', 'novel', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'first',

657585,A3FRNE6UG9KS5U,B00005JPUN,Cthulhu,"[1, 4]","I hope they keep making these bodysnatcher invasion flicks.  It's closer to reality than network news programming.  The theme, similar toRhinoceros(based upon the play by Eugene Ionesco), is universal.  You could include Invaders from Mars (Special Edition) (the original 50s cult classic---not the 80s remake,Invaders from Mars, which was pathetic), orThe Thing (Collector's Edition)(as opposed toThe Thing from Another Worldsince, although it is another great one from the 50s, it didn't involve creepy humanoid duplication---as in ""Are you/he/she one?""---so much as the threat of alien proliferation/infestation in general), in the genre (I'm probably leaving some out).  It's real.  It's happening, baby.  Don't go to sleep.  You'll wake up---one of them.  Everything you feared and hated before...  They're everywhere.  They're taking over.  One side wants to help people, or so they make themselves appear.  The other is definitely about greed, punishment and war.  The idea, of course, upon which these movies are based is a simple one:  Anybody who is diametrically opposed to your core beliefs (and some even have core beliefs that aren't prefabricated) is a cold blooded, unflinching, and evil robot.  An other.  A thing.  An alien.  This is the principle behind political diatribe, ethnic cleansing, or the employment process of any corporation or government agency.  Tell me this isn't so.  Then vote for the monster of your choice.  Sure, you're making a difference...This last offering,The Invasion, wasn't too bad until it got to the end, and did what I was afraid they would do with it---the simplistic, soothing ending.  The cop out.  For that they get a well deserved thumbs down.  Sorry if I spoiled it for you.  Or maybe I just reassured you...Except for maybe the second one of these bodysnatcher flicks, that cool 70s versionInvasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)(they got it right), they keep screwing up the endings.  Maybe it depends on what regime is in power at the time of release (I think I see a pattern here).  Take the first oneInvasion of the Body Snatchers, for example (much as I love it)---I would have had the movie end with the lunatic raving and beating on cars, trying to tell people ""They're here already!  You're next!"" or whatever.  Hilarious.  You'd just know that he would eventually be picked up by the boys in blue and/or the ones in white with the butterfly nets, etc.  Urgent need for therapy.  The End.As has previously been noted, the movie has action scenes and pyrotechnics, alrighty.  But they are visually interesting, unique, well done, not the usual.  And, yes, the infected spread the alien virus by barfing.  Why not spitting, I wonder (remember the initial AIDS scare?  Cop shoots man for spitting on him, afraid he was trying to spread AIDS).  Hell, they could sneeze.  There are also door knobs, shopping carts, or even toilet seats, for transmission of the deadly alien virus.  But no, as usual, Hollywood goes for the unsubtle, and the gross.  Which is how they view their audience.The premise of an outer space virus as the culprit is an intriguing one, and was worth pursuing.  It also saved money on special effects for pods, duplicate bodies, and the like.  However, if you're going to introduce the antagonist as a cosmic flu, you should explain how and why a lowly virus would be trying to take over the world.  An engineered virus, launched by an advanced alien race intent on subjugation of the native populace, is a concept I would have found more credible (but that's not Hollywood---that is to say, simplistic---enough).  They wouldn't want to destroy us because they need us, like any great cult leaders worth their salt, as mindless menials and thralls to build and work in whatever incomprehensible instrumentalities they design as they slowly turn our beloved planet into a hellworld.  That's a movie I could get behind, so long as they leave out the sugar frosted ending and the melodramatics.  Science-fiction and fantasy author Jack Vance used a not dissimilar theme---case in point, of competing alien cultures introducing biological agents to subvert a planet they both wanted, battling each other by accelerating evolution and promoting competitive and antagonistic lifeforms---in a short story he wrote circa 1951 called ""The World Between""The World Between and Other Stories.  Unfortunately, the film industry does not, as a rule, use science-fiction writers to produce science-fiction movies.  Which is a shame, because what you end up with, time and again, is an imbecilic shell of a story with overblown CGI, 2-dimensional characters, overacting, brain-dead dialogue, and lots of explosions.I'd like to make one of these movies.  Anybody in Lalaland listening?  Give me a shot.  I wouldn't be so pc about it.  I don't think you have to reinforce an audience's preconceptions, and ignorance, with a happy-face ending.  Anybody remember Alfred Hitchcock?  Even if they didn't get it at the box office, at least it might become a cult film.  I would embed it in reality, not some fairytale with the cavalry swooping in to the rescue in the final scene, everything's alright, you can go back to sleep now (stupid, they told you not to sleep, didn't they?).  What a con.  The ""good guys"" are infected too, get it?  No?But don't get me wrong.  This movie is definitely worth the 3 bucks I paid for it in the local cut-out rack.  I would hesitate to pay 5.  But then, I've only seen it the one time.  It was ok until that all-too-predictable touchy feely end.  Gotta reassure the proles.  If you depress them too much, it might affect their productivity.  Don't worry, we'll protect you.  OK we scared you, that's our job, but now we're going to bring you back to the warm, fuzzy reality of tidy soundbytes, simple solutions, happy endings, big screen teevees, and job security.  You're not really controlled by aliens who are exploiting you to the grave, wringing all your precious life force out of you before tossing you into the scrap heap when you're depleted, like a drained battery, for their own devious purposes.  That's just make believe.  You've been entertained.  Now it's time for bed (sure, you can sleep---it was only a movie).  Don't forget to set your alarm.  Have a good night's rest, take a tablet.  Then drink your coffee and make sure you're not late.  Busy day ahead.A message is being insinuated as the celluloid winds along, a point made several times during the course of the story line:  Conflict, greed, war, rape and slaughter are bad---but at least they're human.  It equates a world with no conflict and destruction as somehow not human---even sinister and alien.  We humans are just a bunch of cut-ups, aren't we?  The implied subtext is that a world of conflict, tho' bad, is AOK so long as you occupy the high ground with the biggest club.What's wrong with someone taking the opposite view, even if equally unsubstantiated, in some later cinematic reincarnation of the alien bodysnatcher theme---that war, destruction, and misery are sinister and alien induced?  And that peace, trade, and prosperity is our natural state.  Oh, heavens no!  That might hit a little too close to home.  This is entertainment, not revolution.OK, I'm well aware that human beings are quite capable of very bad actions on their own, without any outside help.  I'm not so daft as to believe that this world would automatically be a paradise, if only those evil aliens would just leave us alone.  But there is a question of how much of this bad behavior is genetically predetermined, and how much born of social inequity and injustice, instigated, or at least countenanced, by a sacrosanct, generation-spanning rule of law rigidly and brutally enforced.  Just a thought for some budding young film maker out there whose family was wealthy enough to send him/her to film school...By far, the best part of this movie is the graphics with soundtrack during the first part of the end credits.  That other stuff was just a warm up.  But then they quashed that with a blank screen for the remainder.  Maybe they ran out of CGI money.  Perhaps they didn't want to disturb you too much.Maybe someday someone will make a version which would reflect reality just a little too much.  Then maybe you'd read or see/hear about how his/her promising career was unexpectedly cut short by a plane crash, car wreck, freak accident, etc.  But no, it probably wouldn't happen that way.  With all we've gone through in just the past 20 or so odd years, we probably wouldn't even notice. 2010 RAPWreckerds",3,"""I need to ask you a few questions---for the Census Department...

657586,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JPUN,Cubist,"[7, 9]","To say that The Invasion had a troubled production history is a mild understatement. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel set out to make an artier and edgier take on Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel,Invasion of the Body Snatchers. However, the studio did not like his version and producer Joel Silver brought in his pals, the Wachowski brothers to rewrite the ending and director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to reshoot it. The result was a film that flopped both commercially and critically. Now that all of the dust has settled and it is finally being released on DVD, The Invasion can be reassessed. Is it really that bad?There are a few annoying jumps in logic, like Carol abandoning her vehicle for no good reason and dropping a gun on two occasions that she could have used later on. For a supposedly intelligent character, she doesn't make very smart decisions at times.This is the fourth adaptation of Finney's novel and so far all of them have paled in comparison to the first one, directed by Don Siegel, which was also the most faithful to the source material. The reason that this story keeps being remade is that the allegory for the stifling oppressive nature of conformity is so powerful and still relevant after all these years.While the aliens offer a world without pain and suffering, it is also one without joy and happiness. The Invasion updates this classic story for our times as it channels some of the anxieties of our age: avian flu, SARS, 9/11, the Patriot Act, and so on. In a nice change, this film also deviates from previous adaptations by going in a different direction with how it ends. Some may cry sell-out but it feels true to the rest of the film. The Invasion is hardly as awful as some critics would have you believe. If you go in with low expectations you may come away pleasantly surprised by the end result.""We've Been Snatched Before: Invasion in Media History"" examines how the Body Snatcher films commented on the times in which they were made and this new one is no different.

Knowing something of the film's troubled production - the original cut delivered to the studio byDownfallalumnus Oliver Hirschbiegel was considered to be 'too arthouse' by producer Joel Silver and consequently two thirds of the film was reshot by those purveyors of crimes against cinema, the Wachowski Brothers - left me wanting to see Hirschbiegel's original cut in order to see what was considered so cinematically reprehensible that it had to be reconfigured into a load of sub-action toss by two siblings, who, if there were any justice in the universe, would never be let near a film camera again. Frustratingly, it did have some intriguing ideas in it. The news reports showing vistas of the world succumbing to the REM pods - Chavez and Bush signing a peace accord, US troops pulling out of Iraq and handing over control to Moqtadr Al Sadr - showed the tantalising promise of a much more interesting exploration of the concept of a post-pod planet.  For the most part though, and as I observed to the other half while watching it, ""this is everything that's wrong with modern American cinema"", which is a pity because its in complete contrast to Philip Kaufman's definitive 1978 version of the tale,Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition), which is everything that's right about modern American cinema and still one of the most chilling films that I've ever seen.",1,The Pods In Hollywood Snatched This Movie...,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1489,"['want', 'primer', 'how', 'not', 'make', ""'Body"", 'Snatchers', 'movie', 'go', 'rent', ""'The"", 'Invasion', 'right', 'now', 'Knowing', 'something', 'film', 'troubled', 'production', 'original', 'cut', 'delivered', 'studio', 'byDownfallalumnus', 'Oliver', 'Hirschbiegel', 'was', 'considered', 'be', ""'too"", 'producer', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'consequently', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'was', 'reshot', 'purveyors', 'crimes', 'cinema', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'Hirschbiegel', 'original', 'cut', 'order', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'so', 'cinematically', 'reprehensible', 'had', 'be', 'reconfigured', 'load', 'sub-action', 'toss', 'two', 'siblings', 'who', 'were', 'justice', 'universe', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'let', 'film', 'camera', 'again', 'Frustratingly', 'did', 'have', 'intriguing', 'ideas', 'news', 'reports', 'showing', 'vistas', 'world', 'succumbing', 'REM', 'pods', 'Chavez', 'Bush', 'signing', 'peace', 'accord', 'US', 'pulling', 'Iraq', 'handing', 'over', 'control', 'Moqtadr', 'Al', 'Sadr', 'showed', 'tantalising', 'promise', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'concept', 'post-pod', 'planet', 'most', 'part', 'observed', 'other', 'half', 'watching', 'everything', 'wrong', 'modern', 'American', 'cinema', 'pity', 'complete', 'contrast', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'definitive', '1978', 'version', 'tale', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'everything', 'right', 'modern', 'American', 'cinema', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",The Invasion

657590,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JPUN,Dave. K,"[6, 8]","Sometimes a movie gets really terrible reviews and after I see it I often wonder why there is so much hate for it. I've seen movies that got bad reviews that I might have liked, but I do understand why it gets so many negative reviews. But in the case of The Invasion I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. The Invasion almost seems like a love it or hate it movie, while it does have its flaws I found it to be a fun ride.The Invasion is the 3rd remake of the 1956 classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers and so far I have liked all four versions as well as the unofficial remake The Faculty and I even enjoy some of the knock off films. The Invasion is sort of pointless sense it really doesn't add anything new to the story, though it does attempt to. I just love the concept for these movies and thus far I haven't been letdown yet.After The Invasion was shot it went through quite a few re-shoots and at times you can tell there was some studio tampering, Andy & Larry Wachowski did some rewrites while James McTeigue was hired for re-shoots. But none are credited and since I don't exactly know who did what I have to go based on the credits and only mention the original writer and director regardless of what they did.The screenplay was written by Dave Kajganich and overall it wasn't bad at all. There were some good ideas presented that try and put a twist on the story and some work well and others don't seem to work as well. Overall though the script wasn't bad by any means; the characters are fairly decent, but not enough was done with them. The characters in this you won't dislike, but you don't really like as well. One of the twists on the story is the pods are gone. How can you have a Body Snatcher movie without pods? This time around the aliens instead vomit on you.Yes you read that right; ok so maybe it's not vomit, but they spray things out of their mouth so what would you call it? That concept is a little silly and when they do it odds are you'll get a bit of a chuckle out of it. They also infect people by tricking them into getting flu shots, which was much better than the vomit. Also some people are immune to the alien virus, which was an interesting idea that sort of works.Oliver Hirschbiegel makes his American directorial debut and for the most part does a good job. The Invasion runs at a pretty good pace and there are some fairly creepy moments and while they do lack a little bit it still mostly works. Oliver Hirschbiegel manages to get some decent suspense, but when all is said and done some scenes do lack and The Invasion really had potential to be a great movie, but I still think it mostly works and ends up being a good movie. The Invasion isn't as chilling as the previous 3 versions, but I do think there were a couple of creepy moments.What I loved about the 1978 version is the movie gets to this point to where you don't know who is one of the pod people and who is still human. Even the people passing on by who are nothing more than extras you start to wonder if they are pod people. It has this great presence of paranoia. The Invasion never quite reaches that level sadly, but there is still some suspense even if not as suspenseful as the past installments. I suppose all the blame can't be placed on Oliver Hirschbiegel, but despite those flaws I still think he did well.Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell and does a fairly good job. I'm not the biggest fan of Kidman, in general her movies don't really interest me, but she is a talented actress. The problem here is her performance is just sort of boring. If you didn't know any better you would think she was one of the aliens. She really doesn't show much emotion and again not a bad performance, but sort of boring. Daniel Craig played Ben Driscoll and like Kidman he also gives a good, but boring performance.I did enjoy The Invasion, but it is the weakest of the Body Snatcher series. It lacks the thrills and chills of the previous 3. And while it does move at a slightly better pace than Body Snatchers, it never gets as chilling as that movie was at times. But despite all that The Invasion while pointless does make for a good time. I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. Again it's not a great movie and the weakest of the Body Snatcher series, but overall it is a pretty good movie.More often than not a lot of people forget how important editing is and that is one of the biggest flaws with The Invasion. While there was some suspense and some creepy moments there could have possibly been more if not for the editing. In one scene Carol and Ben are in a room talking to each other and the next scene they are in a car trying to get away, cut back to them in the room talking and cut back to them in the car. In an earlier scene Carol is at home the next at work and the next back home again. All that does take away some suspense from the scenes and also the transition from one scene to the next sometimes is a little sloppy.My biggest complaint though is the ending; while I can't say much since it would spoil the movie. While I suppose it's not a Hollywood ending in the traditional sense, but the ending isn't as bleak as the previous 3. Like I said I really can't say much seeing as it would spoil the movie. It's not really a happy ending, but not dark like the other installments, which would have fitted better.In closing, The Invasion really isn't as bad as the reviews seem to make it, while far from a perfect movie and not as chilling as the other 3 versions, The Invasion does provide a couple of jolts and despite the shortcomings I found it enjoyable.Look for Veronica Cartwright of the 1978 version in a small role as Wendy Lenk.",4,"Flawed, but enjoyable take on the Body Snatcher movies",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,5705,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'really', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'see',

657591,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B00005JPUN,David Girod,"[6, 8]","I see the multiple negative reviews, and yes ""Invasion"" is just another Hollywood remake, and it has been done better. Nothing can really top the 1950's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" anyway. But I have to say that this isn't a bad movie. I remember hearing about the pushed back release date, the re-shot scenes, and I remember this movie only lasting in the theaters about two weeks, so when I popped it into the DVD player I had a copy of ""The Mist"" on hand just in case it was so bad it would be turned off after only a few minutes. I have to say I enjoyed ""Invasion"". Nicole Kidman is always great to watch, and throw James Bond into the mix, with some really good special effects, and a clawing sense of paranoia...""Invasion"" provides a nice evening of entertainment. I liked the idea of a ""virus"" predator this time around, and I really liked who the ""virus"" arrived on Earth. (Sorry no spoilers here...but I see plenty listed in other reviews..so feel free to let them ruin the film for you..not me) There are some pretty tense scenes, and Nicole Kidman does a great job. Sometimes it becomes hip to bash a flick for little or no reason: ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Waterworld"" come to mind, and I think ""Invasion"" is suffering for that reason now. Compared to ""The Fog"", ""Black Christmas"", ""The Ring Two"" and a myriad of other truly lousy remakes, ""Invasion"" at least brought something to the table.

657592,A31A9GENAJYD64,B00005JPUN,David M. Rossi,"[0, 0]","The Invasion is a slick, sophisticated take on the terrific tale of the pod people we have seen so many times before. Or at least that's what the movie tries to be. Fourteen years after Body Snatchers: the invasion continues, an under-appreciated nicely executed sci-fi thriller, we are now subjected to a new tale of a spore threat that spreads by way of a virus. This time, the nasty business of having to deal with the disposal of useless shells of humans after pod conversion, is completely unnecessary. The virus simply merges with human DNA and the alien consciousness takes control of the host body as they sleep. The spreading of the virus is accomplished through a mucous spit spray, the movie's main downfall as this type of transmission has been done countless times before in different sci fi vehicles. Since we miss out on the special effect heavy scenes of transformation that populate previous pod propulsion, There is plenty of time for suspense laden scenes filled with the dread and impending doom as the takeover of humanity seems unstoppable. Nicole Kidman and the boy playing her son are absolutely terrific and believable as they try to resist the onslaught. They outwit the zombie-esque populous at every turn in subtle and not so subtle ways. Now for the bad: Daniel Craig is horrendous as Kidman's love interest. He displays less humanity before conversion and more emotion afterward. A complete disparity when the rest of the cast largely compliments the decent (tough dumbed down)script. With the focal point of the movie being the quick takeover of humanity, the science equation suffers enormously as there is little sense of the slow building progress and understanding of the alien presence that we experienced in the previous pod adventures. Instead, we have quick explanations that only seem to be a way to provide a brief break from the suspenseful scenes. I enjoy these types of movies when they provide a plausible chain of events around the learning of how the alien pathology works and the steps we need to take to stop it. The Invasion fails here considerably, and therefore gets a lower rating because of it. There are several political allegories that seem forced rather than a subtle side benefit as in previous films as well, adding to discomfort. So, the moral is, if you want a decent thriller to get your heart racing, it's here in The Invasion, but if what you're really looking for is an intelligent sci fi vehicle that truly delivers the goods, it may be better for you to see the other Invasions of the pod people. 3 stars",3,snatched...again,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2572,"['Invasion', 'slick', 'sophisticated', 'take', 'terrific', 'tale', 'pod', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'least', 'what', 'movie', 'be', 'Fourteen', 'years', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'invasion', 'under-appreciated', 'nicely', 'executed', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'are', 'now', 'subjected', 'new', 'tale', 'spore', 'threat', 'spreads', 'way', 'virus', 'time', 'nasty', 'business', 'having', 'deal', 'disposal', 'useless', 'shells', 'humans', 'pod', 'conversion', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'virus', 'simply', 'human', 'DNA', 'alien', 'consciousness', 'control', 'host', 'body', 'sleep', 'spreading', 'virus', 'accomplished', 'mucous', 'spit', 'spray', 'movie', 'main', 'downfall', 'type', 'transmission', 'been', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'different', 'sci', 'fi', 'vehicles', 'miss', 'out', 'special', 'effect', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'transformation', 'populate', 'previous', 'pod', 'propulsion', 'plenty', 'time', 'suspense', 'laden', 'scenes', 'filled', 'dread', 'impending', 'doom', 'takeover', 'humanity', 'unstoppable', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'boy', 'playing', 'son', 'are', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'believable', 'try', 'resist', 'onslaught', 'outwit', 'zombie-esque', 'populous', 'turn', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'ways', 'Now', 'bad', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'horrendous', 'Kidman', 'love', 'interest', 'less', 'humanity', 'conversion', 'more', 'emotion', 'afterward', 'A', 'complete', 'disparity', 'when', 'rest', 'cast', 'largely', 'decent', 'tough', 'dumbed', 'down', 'script', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'being', 'quick', 'takeover', 'humanity', 'science', 'equation', 'suffers', 'enormously', 'little', 'sense', 'slow', 'building', 'progress', 'understanding', 'alien', 'presence', 'experienced', 'previous', 'pod', 'adventures', 'Instead', 'have', 'quick', 'explanations', 'only', 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'provide', 'brief', 'break', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'enjoy', 'types', 'movies', 'when', 'provide', 'plausible', 'chain', 'events', 'learning', 'how', 'alien', 'pathology', 'works', 'steps', 'need', 'take', 'stop', 'Invasion', 'here', 'considerably', 'therefore', 'lower', 'rating', 'are', 'several', 'political', 'allegories', 'seem', 'forced', 'rather', 'subtle', 'side', 'benefit', 'previous', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'adding', 'discomfort', 'So', 'moral', 'want', 'decent', 'thriller', 'get', 'heart', 'racing', 'here', 'Invasion', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'sci', 'fi', 'vehicle', 'truly', 'goods', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'see', 'other', 'Invasions', 'pod', 'people', '3', 'stars']",The Invasion
657593,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00005JPUN,David R. Eastwood,"[1, 2]","Jack Finney's science fiction novel INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (serialized is COLLIER'S magazine in 1954; published in book form in 1955) was made into a highly regarded film of the same title in 1956, starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter in an intense and heartbreaking political parable of the times. In 1978 it was filmed (with the same title) as a satire of California society, starring Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, and Leonard Nimoy--and again was quite well received. In a third film version, BODY SNATCHERS: THE INVASION CONTINUES (1994)--starring Gabrielle Anwar, Terry Kinney, Meg Tilly, and Forest Whitaker--the focus seems to be on horror and suspense for their own sake, and although most reviewers rate it below the first two movies, many consider it worth seeing for its young female star if nothing else.In THE INVASION (2007), the latest remake starring Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (the newest James Bond), and Jeffrey Wright, Finney's central idea is alive and well: i.e., our ""humanity"" (for better or worse) can be taken from us by an ""alien"" life-form. In this outing, the traditional pods are dispensed with and a much more plausible (but far less visually dramatic) virus takes their place. Ms. Kidman's character (a brave, intelligent, and attractive female psychiatrist) is clearly the protagonist of the action, which centers around her attempts to find and rescue her young son, who is important not just to her but to all members of the human race who do not wish to be altered mentally by the virus. (In a sense, Kidman plays a kind of heroic ""Ripley"" figure, parallel to Sigourney Weaver's roles in the various ALIEN films.)This film abounds with tense action and dramatic chase scenes--as well as a few tender and/or funny moments between the mother and son; there are also several thought-provoking discussions of human nature that almost seem to have been spliced in to add depth and ""serious purpose"" to the film. Given the United States' recent and current national divisiveness, parts of this film may lead some viewers to see it as a parable about our religious/political factions. (I think this would be misinterpreting the film's intent.)As far as the ""inner peace"" of the infected people is concerned, the script and acting suffer from many inconsistencies--with the disgruntled husband of Veronica Cartwright (who had been in the 1978 remake) and the ex-husband of Kidman among the worse offenders. (But, since logic has usually been sacrificed for the sake of vivid effects throughout 2,500 years of dramatic literature, why quibble about one more instance?)The ending (which I shall not reveal here) strikes me as a bit ""rushed"" in the sense that we do not so much SEE the outcome as HEAR ABOUT it in a short voice-over that summarizes the later events in a minute or less. In this one respect, I will say it is comparable to the ending of M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS (2003), an alien invasion film starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, which I (in the minority) rated very low on several accounts.",4,JACK FINNEY'S PREMISE IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,3053,"['Jack', 'Finney', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'serialized', 'COLLIER', 'magazine', '1954', 'published', 'book', 'form', '1955', 'was', 'made', 'highly', 'regarded', 'film', 'same', 'title', '1956', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'McCarthy', 'Dana', 'Wynter', 'intense', 'heartbreaking', 'political', 'parable', 'times', '1978', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'title', 'satire', 'California', 'society', 'starring', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'again', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'received', 'third', 'film', 'version', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'INVASION', 'CONTINUES', '1994', 'starring', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'focus', 'be', 'horror', 'suspense', 'own', 'sake', 'most', 'reviewers', 'rate', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'many', 'consider', 'worth', 'seeing', 'young', 'female', 'star', 'nothing', 'else.In', 'INVASION', '2007', 'latest', 'remake', 'starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'newest', 'James', 'Bond', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Finney', 'central', 'idea', 'alive', 'well', 'i.e.', 'humanity', 'better', 'worse', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'alien', 'life-form', 'outing', 'traditional', 'pods', 'are', 'dispensed', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'far', 'less', 'visually', 'dramatic', 'virus', 'place', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'character', 'brave', 'intelligent', 'attractive', 'female', 'psychiatrist', 'clearly', 'protagonist', 'action', 'attempts', 'find', 'rescue', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'important', 'not', 'just', 'members', 'human', 'race', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'be', 'altered', 'mentally', 'virus', 'sense', 'Kidman', 'kind', 'heroic', 'Ripley', 'figure', 'parallel', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'roles', 'various', 'ALIEN', 'films', 'film', 'tense', 'action', 'dramatic', 'chase', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'tender', 'and/or', 'funny', 'moments', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'thought-provoking', 'discussions', 'human', 'nature', 'almost', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'spliced', 'add', 'depth', 'serious', 'purpose', 'film', 'Given', 'United', 'States', 'recent', 'current', 'national', 'divisiveness', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'lead', 'viewers', 'see', 'parable', 'religious/political', 'factions', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'misinterpreting', 'film', 'intent', 'As', 'far', 'inner', 'peace', 'infected', 'people', 'concerned', 'script', 'acting', 'suffer', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'disgruntled', 'husband', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'who', 'had', 'been', '1978', 'remake', 'ex-husband', 'Kidman', 'worse', 'offenders', 'logic', 'usually', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'sake', 'vivid', 'effects', '2,500', 'years', 'dramatic', 'literature', 'why', 'quibble', 'one', 'more', 'instance', 'ending', 'shall', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'strikes', 'bit', 'rushed', 'sense', 'do', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'SEE', 'outcome', 'HEAR', 'short', 'voice-over', 'later', 'events', 'minute', 'less', 'one', 'respect', 'will', 'say', 'comparable', 'ending', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'SIGNS', '2003', 'alien', 'invasion', 'film', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'minority', 'rated', 'very', 'low', 'several', 'accounts']",The Invasion

It's rather amusing how this film uses only half of the story's original title.Kidman plays Psychiatrist Carol Bennell, the divorced mother of the Elementary school-aged Oliver Kaufman (an alert and intelligent Jackson Bond) who suffers  from bad dreams about his impending visit with his father (Jeremy Northam) whom he hasn't seen in years.Dr. Tucker Kaufman's first appearance in the film is as an expert who comes to examine the remains of a recently downed space shuttle. The plot thickens with the discovery that alien spores arrived on earth with the downed  craft. While leaving the scene, Kaufman cuts his hand on a piece of debris, which will have foreboding repercussions.We see Carol's daily routine, including work with her colleagues, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) and Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig), we learn of the tempestuous  relationships of Wendy Lenk( Veronica Cartwright, who appeared in the 1978 retelling of this story) with her husband, Richard (Adam Lefevre) and how that situation is linked to the main crisis in this story.But viewers also share a delightful evening with Carol, Ben, and their friends, Dr. Henrik Belicec (Josef Sommer), his wife, Ludmilla (Celia Weston, who has come a long way since her appearance in the TV series ""Alice""), and their friend, Yorish (Roger Rees).Soon, their world changes, and the streets are full of emotionless automatons. Those who express emotions, especially in the extreme forms, are arrested, and the plot revolves around Carol and her colleagues trying to make heads or tails of the matter. Field Blauvet has a cameo as a creepy Census Taker.Notably, the main method for the alien virus' transmission is through vomiting, and the film has quite a bit of that.Before it is over, Kaufman's behavior shows that he's channeled Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. It's amusing to think that Northam can now add throwing up on Nicole Kidman to his resume.Well, it's all been done before, but now it has a 21st century twist. It has good performances, but I can't say I was too impressed by this effort.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel did better with films such as ""Downfall"".

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","I'm amazed it took Hollywood as long as it did to churn out yet another adaptation of Jack Finney's classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""And to give the writers/director credit, ""The Invasion"" does its best to update the classic tale of body-snatching aliens for the 21st century, and has some solid performances by Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, the movie has clearly been ripped to shreds and sewn back together, with major plot threads dropped and an incoherent second half.The space shuttle Patriot unexpected crashes back on Earth, and a strange fungus-like substance is found clinging to the wreckage. One of the people who encounters it is CDC director Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), who pricks his finger on a piece of debris.Then his ex-wife Carol (Kidman) begins to notice things -- dog attacks, strangely stoic children, Tucker's determination to spend time with their son Oliver, and a patient who claims ""my husband is not my husband."" When her friend Ben (Craig) is called in to examine the Czech ambassador, they find that he's covered in a weird plasticky skin wrap.They soon realize that a strange alien intelligence is infecting people, and taking over their minds and bodies when they enter REM sleep. The thing is, there may be a few people who are immune to their influence -- and Oliver is one of them. Now Carol much save her son to save the human race, but how can she stay herself when the whole world has been taken over?First, some praise. ""The Invasion"" does its best to reimagine the ""body-snatchers"" story for the 21st-century -- instead of making duplicates of the humans, the aliens possess the bodies of their victims. And rather than imitating the 1978 movie's ending, this one takes an approach more like that of Finney's original novel -- or maybe ""War of the Worlds."" Whichever.Done well, this could have been a diverting sci-fi story. Certainly the first half is a pretty suspenseful affair, with lots of build-up to the inevitable discovery of alien invasion.But then... it all falls apart. The second half appears to have been ripped to shreds and reconstituted, a cinematic Frankenstein's monster that lurches pitifully to a rushed conclusion. Everything feels uneven and chaotic, with some scenes (Carol's stay in the convenience store) dragging on for what feels like hours, and a final scene that feels like it was tacked on hastily.Also, some important plot threads and characters just... vanish. The suggestion of psychiatric drugs producing immunity is abruptly dropped, and two characters' fates are never explained. One is hit on the head with a hammer, and the other escapes the possessed... and we're just never told anything more about them. What?!One thing I cannot assign blame to is the actors. Kidman is all porcelain chilliness, but with a core of fire inside when her son is threatened. I have to wonder if she chose this role as a subtle jab at her ex-husband -- she plays a psychiatrist who keeps herself awake with pharmaceuticals and saves the world from her brainwashed drone ex, whom she whacks on the head with a hammer.The rest of the actors are pretty good, although not given much to work with. Craig gives a solid hearty performance as a doctor who feels more than friendship toward her. Jeremy Northam also does a pretty good job, although he mostly just plays a blank-eyed villain.""The Invasion"" has the bones of a decent sci-fi flick, but the second half degenerates into a messy, chaotic, confusing disaster.

Jury ""dsunglasses""","[2, 3]","It's funny how a movie that's supposed to scare you about what happens when you sleep, can actually make you sleepy.This is the fourth movie incarnation of the whole body snatcher theme, and unfortunately it's the worst. Its not the fault of the actors, instead I would blame the writing and directing.First of all, its already been done 3 times prior, not to mention a bunch of B movie knock offs, where aliens take over humans.The original spin here is the replacement of alien pods with an alien virus. This is actually a plus for the movie, as the whole bodies growing out of pods, and almost nobody notices  was always a bit of a stretch. A virus that infects and takes over mankind is far more believe and thus should be scarier, but unfortunately it wasn't. The vomiting int o food or people as a way of spreading the virus was far more gross then scary.the suspense and eeriness was good for the most part, but it  also felt all too predictable.IMO despite its flaws the 1978 version remains the best and scariest of this franchise. It's creepy music, sounds effects and horrific ""pod scream"" kept you on the edge of your seat. That movie reminded you of what people were losing, first and foremost the ability to love, as well as the appreciation for music, and all of the other things that make us human. It's horrific lost cause ending, made you glad it was just a movie.This current adaption, takes the opposite approach. First it attacks humanity a couple times halfway through the movie, and then again, with its unfullfiling ending. Rather then celebrating humanity, this movie tried awkwardly, to make  some ludicrous liberal guilt argument that the aliens are better, cause they, all just get along. The happy ending where everything is back to normal, just didn't seem believable and felt tacked on. And people's attitudes about world problems at the end, just made them seem ungrateful to have been saved.Other then the virus twist this adaption brings nothing new and worthwhile to the story.",2,This made me sleepy,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,2012,"['funny', 'how', 'movie', 'supposed', 'scare', 'what', 'when', 'sleep', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'sleepy.This', 'fourth', 'movie', 'incarnation', 'whole', 'body', 'snatcher', 'theme', 'unfortunately', 'worst', 'not', 'fault', 'actors', 'instead', 'would', 'blame', 'writing', 'directing.First', 'already', 'been', 'done', '3', 'times', 'prior', 'not', 'mention', 'bunch', 'B', 'movie', 'knock', 'offs', 'where', 'aliens', 'take', 'humans.The', 'original', 'spin', 'here', 'replacement', 'alien', 'pods', 'alien', 'virus', 'actually', 'plus', 'movie', 'whole', 'bodies', 'growing', 'pods', 'almost', 'nobody', 'notices', 'was', 'always', 'bit', 'stretch', 'virus', 'over', 'mankind', 'far', 'more', 'believe', 'thus', 'should', 'be', 'scarier', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'vomiting', 'int', 'o', 'food', 'people', 'way', 'spreading', 'virus', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'gross', 'then', 'scary.the', 'suspense', 'eeriness', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'also', 'felt', 'too', 'predictable.IMO', 'flaws', '1978', 'version', 'best', 'scariest', 'franchise', 'creepy', 'music', 'effects', 'horrific', 'pod', 'scream', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'movie', 'reminded', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'losing', 'first', 'foremost', 'ability', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'appreciation', 'music', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'human', 'horrific', 'lost', 'cause', 'ending', 'made', 'glad', 'was', 'just', 'movie.This', 'current', 'adaption', 'opposite', 'approach', 'First', 'humanity', 'couple', 'times', 'halfway', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'unfullfiling', 'ending', 'then', 'celebrating', 'humanity', 'movie', 'tried', 'awkwardly', 'make', 'ludicrous', 'liberal', 'guilt', 'argument', 'aliens', 'are', 'better', 'cause', 'just', 'get', 'along', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'everything', 'back', 'normal', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believable', 'felt', 'tacked', 'people', 'attitudes', 'world', 'problems', 'end', 'just', 'made', 'seem', 'ungrateful', 'have', 'been', 'saved.Other', 'then', 'virus', 'twist', 'adaption', 'nothing', 'new', 'worthwhile', 'story']",The Invasion
657607,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,B00005JPUN,Found Highways,"[5, 5]","All the succeeding versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers have been weaker than the ones which came before, but they've all had interesting additions to the basic story of the pods taking over people.The original (1956 with Kevin McCarthy) was the best because it was a low-budget film noir that didn't take itself too seriously. The Philip Kaufman remake in 1978 set in San Francisco anticipated the AIDS/STD crisis that was just around the corner. Abel Ferrara's version Body Snatchers (1993), set on an Army post, gave us a look at what happens when a society is increasingly militarized without wide scale involvement in the military by civilians for a temporary term of service, the way Americans experienced World War II.The Invasion starring Nicole Kidman is the least interesting yet, but even it has a couple of intriguing ideas. I get the feeling it was intended to say some halfway serious things about the United States and its place in the world before a glamorous movie star got involved.Pills have replaced pods in this version of the story.Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman) prescribes a change in medication when a woman in an abusive marriage reports that her husband has become much calmer, except for strangling the dog when it growled at him.Later one of the newly infected asks Bennell if she can give him a pill to prevent a Darfur, or a New Orleans.Before the alien infection arrives on Earth, Bennell is caught between her ex-husband and her platonic boyfriend. We see both men before and after they're infected. Unlike previous versions of the story, people aren't killed and replaced by duplicates grown from pods, they are just transformed by an infection into a joint human-alien entity.These monsters aren't the emotionless pods of previous invasions. One old man, after he's transformed, comes back to his wife and begs her to join him. His desire for the woman he's loved for decades seems real.Bennell's ex-husband is a jerk before and after he's infected, and her boyfriend is the same calm rational man he was before. This invasion of the body snatchers doesn't really result in losing your identity. The peace that breaks out all over the world is almost as ludicrous as in the 1952 B movie with Peter Graves,Red Planet Mars, when God speaks from Mars.I think the people who conceived this film wanted us to consider that maybe we should allow the infection to change us.There's one moment at the climax, when it looks like Bennell and her son (who's immune to the infection) can't escape, when she considers surrendering. But they won't allow her immune son to survive and risk the new order. So she blasts away.It's no surprise that salvation comes from Fort Detrick, where the scientists have been working on a drug (of course!) to reverse the infection.The world goes back to normal, but the movie doesn't tell us that the scientists at Fort Detrick have kept a sample of the alien substance and are working on a way to turn it into a weapon. If that's the sequel to this movie, it may be the most honest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers yet.",2,"""Maybe it's that bug that's been going around.""",1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,3096,"['succeeding', 'versions', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'have', 'been', 'weaker', 'ones', 'came', ""'ve"", 'had', 'interesting', 'additions', 'basic', 'story', 'pods', 'taking', 'over', 'people.The', 'original', '1956', 'Kevin', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'best', 'was', 'low-budget', 'film', 'noir', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'remake', '1978', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'anticipated', 'AIDS/STD', 'crisis', 'was', 'just', 'corner', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'version', 'Body', 'Snatchers', '1993', 'set', 'Army', 'post', 'gave', 'look', 'what', 'when', 'society', 'increasingly', 'militarized', 'wide', 'scale', 'involvement', 'military', 'civilians', 'temporary', 'term', 'service', 'way', 'Americans', 'experienced', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'Invasion', 'starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'least', 'interesting', 'yet', 'even', 'couple', 'intriguing', 'ideas', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'intended', 'say', 'halfway', 'serious', 'things', 'United', 'States', 'place', 'world', 'glamorous', 'movie', 'star', 'got', 'involved.Pills', 'have', 'replaced', 'pods', 'version', 'story.Psychiatrist', 'Carol', 'Bennell', 'Kidman', 'change', 'medication', 'when', 'woman', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'reports', 'husband', 'become', 'much', 'calmer', 'strangling', 'dog', 'when', 'growled', 'him.Later', 'one', 'newly', 'infected', 'asks', 'Bennell', 'can', 'give', 'pill', 'prevent', 'Darfur', 'New', 'Orleans.Before', 'alien', 'infection', 'Earth', 'Bennell', 'caught', 'ex-husband', 'platonic', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'men', ""'re"", 'infected', 'previous', 'versions', 'story', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'killed', 'replaced', 'duplicates', 'grown', 'pods', 'are', 'just', 'transformed', 'infection', 'joint', 'human-alien', 'entity.These', 'monsters', 'are', ""n't"", 'emotionless', 'pods', 'previous', 'invasions', 'One', 'old', 'man', 'transformed', 'back', 'wife', 'begs', 'join', 'desire', 'woman', 'loved', 'decades', 'real.Bennell', 'ex-husband', 'jerk', 'infected', 'boyfriend', 'same', 'calm', 'rational', 'man', 'was', 'before', 'invasion', 'body', 'snatchers', ""n't"", 'really', 'result', 'losing', 'identity', 'peace', 'out', 'world', 'almost', 'as', 'ludicrous', '1952', 'B', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Red', 'Planet', 'Mars', 'when', 'God', 'Mars.I', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'conceived', 'film', 'wanted', 'consider', 'maybe', 'should', 'allow', 'infection', 'change', 'one', 'moment', 'climax', 'when', 'Bennell', 'son', 'who', 'immune', 'infection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'when', 'surrendering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'immune', 'son', 'survive', 'risk', 'new', 'order', 'away.It', 'surprise', 'salvation', 'Fort', 'Detrick', 'where', 'scientists', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'drug', 'course', 'reverse', 'infection.The', 'world', 'back', 'normal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'scientists', 'Fort', 'Detrick', 'have', 'kept', 'sample', 'alien', 'substance', 'are', 'working', 'way', 'turn', 'weapon', 'sequel', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'honest', 'version', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'yet']",The Invasion

We can't really take that kind of fun away from all of us. Some of us need that fun, and I may say that maybe most of us need it. The film plays on that very well, till there is no escape what-so-ever, and there the film becomes a quick shortcut to a palatable end, after getting a glimpse of George W. Bush on TV. The poor woman and her son will manage to kill a few regenerated human beings who are no longer human, then she or they will kill a couple of dozens more ,and finally escape in a chopper that was handily flying by, and then on the following frame everything is back to normal, a vaccine has been found and the millions of weirdo sickly mutants have been brought back to normal. It is so nice to go back to school, to have pancakes that are not burnt, etc. The suspense is OK, the story is nothing phenomenal, Nicole Kidman wears and carries or even bears her name well, oscillating between the frenzy of a kid and the determination of an adult, but with a touch of French looking erratic psychosis. It is probably not worse than the old ""Body snatchers"" and the more recent remake of ""The War of the Worlds"".

As Joanna, she pretended to be a robot inThe Stepford Wivesand here, as psychiatrist Carol Bennell, she spends much of her time pretending to be an emotionless alien.The movie can't decide its genre; a mishmash of car chases and clunky dialogue that never manages to be scary. I recommend you watch the originalInvasion of the Body Snatchersor the 1978 remake,Invasion of the Body Snatchersinstead.A more interesting approach in this film would've been to cast Kidman's real life ex-husband, Tom Cruise, as Tucker, the ex-husband who infects Carol with a gross, face-to-face vomiting sequence. Instead, we get Jeremy Northam, who despite a healthy amount of staring and stalking, never exudes the menace necessary to be cast as the main villain.One last note, this is the first of two movies to star Kidman and Daniel Craig. The other isThe Golden Compass, in which her simian counterpart projected a wider range of emotions than she did.

Especially with all the mindless tripe contained in so many of the re-makes coming out today.  I think the two worst re-makes that have come out in just the past two years were ""War Of The Worlds"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes.""  Both of these re-makes did an absolute injustice to the originals and both of the original films contained a far better atmosphere, and acting as well.  I just don't understand the problem that Hollywood, along with people, in general, seem to have with original films.  Is newer necessarily better?Well, that being said, I really have to say that this latest re-make of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is a rare exception to the re-make tripe that has been occurring recently and a marvelous breath of fresh air.  This was a very gripping and intelligent sci-fi thriller and I really felt that Nicole Kidman made one of her finest performances ever.  (I thought I was going to have insomnia after watching her brilliant perfomance of trying to stay awake to avoid becoming the latest victim of the invasion).At any rate, this is one that should not be missed.

657621,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00005JPUN,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[13, 18]","First off, I'll let everyone here know that when i saw this movie I've never seenInvasion of the Body Snatchers(shame on me) and so cannot compare it to that movie. I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a ""glorified zombie movie"" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a ""Zombie"" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected. That said however, there is just something about the way they move, the way they don't require nourishment, and just walk around mindlessly infecting others with their alien virus that makes them very zombie like. They're notDawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)zombies, and they're not28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)zombies either; these binges are a completely new sort of zombie, sort of the Stephen King zombie for those of you who've readCell: A Novel.Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. we start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. Their smiling too much, their too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. at first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.The real horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for our aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and infected.The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near as good as the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.Re-watch value; high.",5,"""For better or worse, we're human again""",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,4019,"['First', ""'ll"", 'let', 'everyone', 'here', 'know', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seenInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'shame', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 're-make', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'went', 'movie', 'mostly', 'open', 'mind', 'expecting', 'virus', 'fun', 'exactly', 'what', 'got.Walking', 'theaters', 'opening', 'night', 'remember', 'sister', 'calling', 'Invasion', 'glorified', 'zombie', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'agree', 'more', 'No', 'not', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'strict', 'sense', 'word', 'infected', 'talk', 'drive', 'cars', 'never', 'show', 'emotion', 'remember', 'past', 'lives', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'eat', 'victims', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'right', 'away', 'who', 'who', ""n't"", 'infected', 'said', 'however', 'just', 'something', 'way', 'move', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'nourishment', 'just', 'walk', 'around', 'mindlessly', 'infecting', 'others', 'alien', 'virus', 'very', 'zombie', ""'re"", 'notDawn', 'Dead', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'zombies', ""'re"", 'not28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'binges', 'are', 'completely', 'new', 'sort', 'zombie', 'sort', 'Stephen', 'King', 'zombie', 'who', ""'ve"", 'readCell', 'Novel.Anyway', 'movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'awkwardly', 'be', 'honest', 'shuttle', 'crashes', 'very', 'beginning', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'wrong', 'other', 'guy', 'turning', 'goo', 'bed', 'start', 'notice', 'very', 'slowly', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'acting', 'people', 'smiling', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'nice', 'start', 'throwing', 'up', 'coffee', 'know', 'friendly', 'stuff', 'first', 'everyone', 'sort', 'flue', 'going', 'around', 'pretty', 'soon', 'start', 'realize', 'something', 'terrible', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'terrible', 'going', 'on.The', 'real', 'horror', 'alien', 'virus', 'infected', 'most', 'world', 'population', 'even', 'being', 'aware', 'virus', 'passed', 'one', 'person', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'much', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'humans', 'personality', 'so', 'become', 'very', 'mellow', 'emotionless', 'only', 'drive', 'infect', 'others', 'kill', 'immune', 'virus', 'spreads', 'instead', 'worldwide', 'chaos', 'anarchy', 'see', 'most', 'virus', 'movies', 'wars', 'violence', 'seem', 'stop', 'everywhere', 'US', 'pull', 'Iraq', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'end', 'years', 'fighting', 'President', 'Bush', 'Chavez', 'Venezuela', 'Almost', 'world', 'problems', 'end', 'overnight', 'virus', 'hold.And', 'terror', 'dilemma', 'Invasion', 'virus', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'stopped', 'cost', 'god', 'given', 'cure', 'aggressive', 'tendencies', 'cure', 'violence', 'war', 'poverty', 'Should', 'fight', 'change', 'human', 'nature', 'should', 'accept', 'question', 'always', 'back', 'head', 'watching', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'look', 'infected', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'Even', 'know', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'safer', 'place', 'were', 'still', 'know', 'better', 'be', 'violent', 'human', 'peaceful', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'abrupt', 'mean', 'liked', 'concept', 'were', 'going', 'needed', 'milk', 'ending', 'more', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'cylinders', 'then', 'little', 'warning', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'walked', 'theater', 'praising', 'Invasion', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'should', 'too.EDIT', 'Okay', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'gone', 'back', 'seen', 'original', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'movie', 'as', 'well', '1978', 'remake', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'version', 'classic', 'tale', 'have', 'admit', 'versions', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'older', 'fans', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'negative', 'review', 'Invasion', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'older', 'versions', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'somehow', 'put', 'original', 'movies', 'mind', 'watching', 'it.Re-watch', 'value', 'high']",The Invasion

It keeps you guessing and draws you into the characters lives. Nicole Kidman's acting here is actually good. And she has a very tender and believable relationship with her young son in the movie, whom she is trying to save. Perhaps the other reviewers are hung up on the fact that this is not an exact remake of the original 1950's version. Well, get over it. The last thing I wanted to see was the same material rehashed in the same way. This movie tries to be different while keeping only the bare bones of the original concept in tact.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","Maybe I'm easy to please or give a partial pass to genre movies (probably a little of both), but I thought ""The Invasion"" was a perfectly good evening's entertainment.  I liked the characters, the story was creepy, and things moved along at a nice clip.  Whatever production difficulties there were, the end result has a coherent, smooth feel, and gets the job done.  We should all remember that there are hundreds of examples of revered movies that had troubled production histories.  Also, I'm guessing that original director Oliver Hirschbiegel couldn't have completely objected to some of the re-shoots and modifications made to his original cut, as he's right there in the special features section sitting next to producer Joel Silver, helping him promote the film.Is ""The Invasion"" a perfect movie?  Nah.  It's strange that they hired an Australian actress (Nicole Kidman) and a British actor (Daniel Craig) and then had them both supress their accents to play Americans.  But they're otherwise good in the film, projecting tense involvement in the plot (as a quick aside, it was also kind of funny and a bit disorienting to see Mr. Craig acting alongside Jeffrey Wright, knowing they both were filming the James Bond film ""Casino Royale"" about that time).  The message was a little naive, too, if the producers were seriously suggesting that it might be okay if we all lost our emotions and passion if it meant an end to world conflicts.  But the idea wasn't pushed too hard, only suggested, so I won't make too much of an issue over that.Plusses include some good action, creepy transformation make-up, and a genuinely scary, repulsive way the infected try to spread the virus (which some reviewers here have counted as a negative aspect of the movie, which I think is a strange thing to say about a film that's supposed to frighten us).  On the DVD, sharp picture and sound, and a handful of interesting extra features, further put this one over the top.I wouldn't rush to make ""The Invasion"" part of your DVD library, but as a rental or something you run across in the TV listings, it's worth your time.  It might even be worth buying if you get a really good deal.As a final thought, I'm not sure that I needed to watch the ""The Invasion"", with its heavy metaphor for the aggressive spread of deadly new diseases and viral strains and our fear of same, just as the current swine flu pandemic is reaching crisis proportions.

657625,A2GM9GNP2G8HO1,B00005JPUN,J. R. SOUTH,"[4, 6]","Okay, as someone who considers himself somewhat of a ""Body Snatchers"" afficianado, here is my opinion of the 4th version of Jack Finney's 1954 sci-fi novel (actually the 5th version, if you count the musical adaptation written for the stage...yes, this really exists!!!).Obviously, there is something about the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story that strikes a chord in the human psyche.  It consistantly makes producers want to re-invent it and audiences want to see it again.  Let's face it: the plot is full of holes and truly off-the-map logistically.  But who cares?  Not me.  The hook is its terrifying emotional impact, targeting our fears of being trapped in an apathetic, zombie-like society.  For my money, the best of the ""Body Snatchers"" is Phillip Kaufmann's 1978 rendition, which literally drips with atmospheric dread and paranoia.  It brings Don Siegel's 1955 version (which capitalized on McCarthyism and the Red Scare) crashing into a new era of psychoanalysis and the search for happiness.Abel Ferrara's 1993 re-make has its moments (interestingly, it's set in a military base).  However, all-in-all, the script feels undeveloped and the movie never reaches the full potential of either the original book or its two cinematic predecessors.So where does this leave ""The Invasion"" in the ranks?  In my opinion, not only is it not nearly as bad as people say it is, I'm going to go out on a limb and call it pretty darn good.  When a friend and I decided to see it in the theater despite the bad press, we turned to one another halfway through, surprised by the all the bad buzz.  True, the ending sucks, and I missed the pods from another world, however implausable they may have been.  But there are quite a few jolting scares, and some weird originality added: the creepy guy at the door taking a survey in the middle of the night, the viscious dog attack, deformed bodies slithering across the floor, and of course, all that unexpected projectile vomitting!  Also, rather than being replaced by pod people, the victims of ""The Invasion"" actually remain themselves, only drastically altered by an extraterrestrial virus.  This finally makes sense of the lines uttered by all the body snatchers in all the films, that the victims will still remain who they are, only greatly improved after being taken over.  Previously, this had always seemed like a pathetic selling point to get the victims to calm down, since it was obvious they were not going to continue in their current state, but be completely replicated, as their original forms  disintegrated.So there's my take on ""The Invasion"". Hey, why not read the original book, along with ""They're Here...! A Tribute The Body Snatchers""?  Then you can rent all of the movie versions, and have a ""Body Snatchers"" weekend . . . while you wait for the next adaptation to come out.",4,My Two Cents,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,2849,"['Okay', 'someone', 'who', 'somewhat', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'afficianado', 'here', 'opinion', '4th', 'version', 'Jack', 'Finney', '1954', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'actually', '5th', 'version', 'count', 'musical', 'adaptation', 'written', 'stage', 'yes', 'really', '.Obviously', 'something', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'story', 'chord', 'human', 'psyche', 'consistantly', 'producers', 'want', 're-invent', 'audiences', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Let', 'face', 'plot', 'full', 'holes', 'truly', 'off-the-map', 'logistically', 'who', 'Not', 'hook', 'terrifying', 'emotional', 'impact', 'targeting', 'fears', 'being', 'trapped', 'apathetic', 'zombie-like', 'society', 'money', 'best', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Phillip', 'Kaufmann', '1978', 'rendition', 'literally', 'atmospheric', 'dread', 'paranoia', 'Don', 'Siegel', '1955', 'version', 'capitalized', 'McCarthyism', 'Red', 'Scare', 'crashing', 'new', 'era', 'psychoanalysis', 'search', 'happiness.Abel', 'Ferrara', '1993', 're-make', 'moments', 'interestingly', 'set', 'military', 'base', 'However', 'all-in-all', 'script', 'feels', 'undeveloped', 'movie', 'never', 'full', 'potential', 'original', 'book', 'two', 'cinematic', 'predecessors.So', 'where', 'leave', 'Invasion', 'ranks', 'opinion', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'call', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'When', 'friend', 'decided', 'see', 'theater', 'bad', 'press', 'turned', 'one', 'halfway', 'surprised', 'bad', 'buzz', 'True', 'ending', 'sucks', 'missed', 'pods', 'world', 'however', 'implausable', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'jolting', 'scares', 'weird', 'originality', 'added', 'creepy', 'guy', 'door', 'taking', 'survey', 'middle', 'night', 'viscious', 'dog', 'attack', 'deformed', 'bodies', 'slithering', 'floor', 'course', 'unexpected', 'vomitting', 'Also', 'rather', 'being', 'replaced', 'pod', 'people', 'victims', 'Invasion', 'actually', 'remain', 'only', 'drastically', 'altered', 'extraterrestrial', 'virus', 'finally', 'sense', 'lines', 'uttered', 'body', 'snatchers', 'films', 'victims', 'will', 'still', 'remain', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'greatly', 'improved', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'Previously', 'had', 'always', 'seemed', 'pathetic', 'selling', 'point', 'get', 'victims', 'calm', 'down', 'was', 'obvious', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'continue', 'current', 'state', 'be', 'completely', 'replicated', 'original', 'forms', 'disintegrated.So', 'take', 'Invasion', 'Hey', 'why', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'book', ""'re"", 'Here', 'Tribute', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Then', 'can', 'rent', 'movie', 'versions', 'have', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'weekend', 'wait', 'next', 'adaptation', 'come', 'out']",The Invasion

657628,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPUN,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","I often find it perplexing why some actors and actresses sign on for some of the movies that they do, especially when it should be obvious from the get-go that the movie will not be all that great or even do remotely well at the box office. Case in point would be the most recent adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel The Body Snatchers called ""The Invasion"" starring Nicole Kidman (""The Others"") and Daniel Craig (""007: Casino Royale"").""The Invasion"" follows the life of Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), a Washington D.C. psychiatrist, who begins to suspect that many of the people around her, and throughout the rest of the city are acting suspiciously out of character. As the oddities begin to mount, and the rest of the world follows suit, Carol along with her close friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) believe that maybe we have been invaded by an outside force. It appears that the change in people's personalities and behavior only occur after they have entered a deep sleep for the night, now Carol and Ben must fight to stay awake and stay alive before they succumb to the change that is quickly overtaking everyone in the entire world.I really wanted to see this movie when I first heard about it, but I found it odd that I hadn't seen all that many previews for it prior to its release. Truthfully, I don't believe I saw a single preview advertising this film's release until a week or two before its debut in theaters across the country. Generally when hardly any previews are shown prior to a film's release, it is a fairly good indication that the movie will not be all that great, and it will nine times out of ten be followed up by rather lousy reviews from the critics. Well, go figure the movie was released and what do you know, the critics seemed to absolutely hate it. With that knowledge I figured I wouldn't see ""The Invasion"" unless it was a cheap rental or free on TV at some point. However, I recently heard that the movie turned out to be better than expected and that some of the critics may have been overly harsh in their initial criticism of the movie. So, I decided to give the movie a try, but after viewing it, I should have trusted the critics and my own instincts about the movie, and avoided it completely.""The Invasion"" is one of those kinds of movies that tries really hard to scare the audience with genuine thrills, relying less on shock value; except it never actually succeeds in accomplishing its goal. The film's pace is way too slow, which works for some movies, but in this one it causes boredom to set in and a general lack of interest in the movie's overall outcome. The story for the film was somewhat strange to me, now I must admit that I have never read the novel on which this film is based, but I have to believe that for the novel to be as successful as it was it must have been more entertaining than this adaptation. Aside from the pacing being too slow, the motives for the invading force (presumably aliens of some kind, though we never see them or a ship) are somewhat confusing. It appears that their ultimate goal is for us to live in a world of peace and harmony, and they believe that the only way we can achieve this end result is for them to take us over. Well, that's all fine and dandy, except why go through all the trouble just to promote peace in our world. If they felt that we were too destructive of a race to ever truly achieve peace in our world, why not just kill us all, allowing them to set up shop on our world and then they could live in peace in our stead. At least that plot makes a bit more sense to me, plus it never was explained why they singled us out to begin with. I mean choosing us because of our destructive nature was their primary motive, but the fact that the invaders seemed to be willing to live out their days in our bodies indicated that they were content with living on our world. So, was there something wrong with their world, or was it destroyed or rendered uninhabitable? These questions began to become more pressing to me as the movie unfolded and the motive for the invaders began to seem more and more ridiculous and just too simple to believe. If the movie had addressed some of the questions I had raised, perhaps the movie would have been better, but the pacing still would have been an issue, though at least the actual story would have made a bit more sense to me in the process.The acting was decent, but I expected more from at least the two leads in the picture, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Nicole did a fairly solid job as a single mother who is just desperate to save her son from sharing the fate of most of mankind, although in a few scenes I thought she went a little overboard with the hysteria as she struggled to find her son and then keep him safe. Daniel Craig was a little more on the other end of the acting spectrum; instead of going overboard in his performance, I found him to be a little too subdued and almost bored with his character, which led me to not care about his character's fate nearly as much as I should have. The supporting cast was alright, most of their performances were wooden, but I forgive that because I believe that was the way the director wanted them to act so the audience could differentiate between those who were normal humans and those who had been taken over.In the end, ""The Invasion"" really fails to gain any real momentum within the story. The acting was decent, but a bit too uneven amongst the various performances that the unevenness begins to distract from the already dull story. Perhaps with better pacing, more consistent performances, and a much stronger motive for the invading forces, ""The Invasion"" may have proven to have been a better movie. Instead, ""The Invasion"" wound up being just another below average science-fiction movie that tried to take itself too seriously and found itself generally disliked by the critics and moviegoers

This was not a terrible movie, it was watchable but it felt bland and there were really no surprises, half of it was chase scenes, I felt as if I was watching a remake of ""The Fugitive"" or something, and not to mention Nicole Kidman's frozen face - I think some emotion and wrinkles on her would make her look human, instead she looked more alien than half the invaded bodies. I never saw the original but half way thought the film I asked myself - what is this movie about? It didn't feel that it was about anything; sadly it was people going though actions with no juice and energy behind any of it.This is something that I can see myself watching once but never again, the character development was completely non existent, even Daniel Craig was lacking, he looked washed out and bored to be there, there was no passion about anything whatsoever.  I also felt disappointed by the ending, it disintegrated any hopes of this movie packing a punch, at least if it was horrible and gruesome and wild I would have felt that I watched something, instead it felt like a lukewarm leftover lunch that I ate only because I didn't want to throw it away.- Kasia S.",3,Those were some boring snatchers...,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,1338,"['remember', 'being', 'excited', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'watching', 'think', 'trailer', 'was', 'better', 'least', 'was', 'short', 'showed', 'interesting', 'parts', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'was', 'watchable', 'felt', 'bland', 'were', 'really', 'surprises', 'half', 'was', 'chase', 'scenes', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'remake', 'Fugitive', 'something', 'not', 'mention', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'frozen', 'face', 'think', 'emotion', 'wrinkles', 'would', 'make', 'look', 'human', 'instead', 'looked', 'more', 'alien', 'invaded', 'bodies', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'half', 'way', 'thought', 'film', 'asked', 'what', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'anything', 'sadly', 'was', 'people', 'going', 'actions', 'juice', 'energy', 'it.This', 'something', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'once', 'never', 'again', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'completely', 'non', 'existent', 'even', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'lacking', 'looked', 'washed', 'out', 'bored', 'be', 'there', 'was', 'passion', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'also', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'disintegrated', 'hopes', 'movie', 'packing', 'punch', 'least', 'was', 'horrible', 'gruesome', 'wild', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'watched', 'something', 'instead', 'felt', 'lukewarm', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'ate', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'throw', 'away.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",The Invasion

This particular Blue-Ray DVD appeared to be an exceptional video transfer on my large screen HDTV. The Invasion did not feature too many special effects but did open with some nice CGI animations of the space shuttle burning up during re-entry. Other very excellent computer animations of space-borne microbes and some exciting stunt and action shots did appear during the course of the film, but it was definitely not a special effects movie and aimed its greatest efforts at telling a fine story.It told a good solid sci-fi tale open to many interpretations. I have watched all three productions, however, much as I liked the original felt this was somehow the best.  Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were both excellent.

I was actually in areas where people think so much alike and are so outwardly ""charming"" and ""hospitable"" that they are willing to blow everyone else to Hell (and NOT back!) in order to have everyone thinking, acting and being like they are. I thought this was a great contrast to what THE INVASION postulates that world peace was possible through control of the individual.I didnot find this THE INVASION to be a great film at all.I thought that the likes of Northam,Craig and Kidman were so much more worthy of better material, but hey, they need to work! Having seen all of the other versions of this story,to me, this was just an alternative presentation of the ""same ol'-same-ol'"" with a different style.Nothing wrong with that. (It was filmed in my hometown for over two years and snarled downtown traffic everyday.) But, that said,when I can walk away from a ""zombie film"" (I cannot think of a better term),with something that sticks in my crawl, then I am pleased that my time was well spent.Something that I have learned the hard way I will continue to take with me through life: I will NOT let anything or anyone control the way I think.

The faces of passersby looked grim, agonized, emotional.  I was afraid for them, they'd be picked up next.  My wife said, ""OK then, even though the movie was sort of a mess it still unsettles you.""  And it's true.  The fourth version of Jack Finney's 50s sci-fi masterpiece is a little incoherent, but despite the reputed four directors it works on a basic level, it scares the dickens out of you!  Nicole Kidman plays a psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, in modernday Washington DC (attractive use of the city); a divorcee, Carol shares custody of her young son Oliver with her former husband, some kind of government bureaucrat in charge of health issues.  Tucker Kaufman, the husband, is played by Jeremy Northam and at first he doesn't seem like such a bad guy.  When the space shuttle ""Patriot"" returns from its mission in outer space and explodes in a two hundred mile wide corridor from Dallas to DC, the wreckage is isolated, and a random sample seems to show spores attached to it, spores that have somehow survived the intense cold of space and also the phenomenal heat of re-entry.  Once Tucker is accidentally handed a piece of spore-laden metal, you know things aren't going to go well for his dog, his ex-wife, nor his little boy, but that's why we paid the ten dollars after all!German director Oliver Hirschbiegel is said to have been responsible for the quieter, more claustrophobic scenes in which, one by one, all of Carol's patients, friends and neighbors get ""changed"" somehow.  When she googles the phrase ""my husband is not my husband,"" hundreds of thousands of hits blink back at her.  In no time at all she ""gets it,"" aided by Hirschbiegel's nifty casting of Veronica Cartwright, from the Phil Kaufman version of BODY SNATCHERS, as the most over the top of Carol's patients, one afraid of her husband's volatile ways who gets even more afraid when he becomes ""snatched.""The biggest change I could see was that--no pods are involved in this alien invasion--and also that some people might be immune to being invaded and thus more of a target than ever to the alien mass consciousness that seeks to find a new home on earth.  Both these changes made the story seem fresh and frisky, though actually I've liked all of the versions so far, even the one with Meg Tilly by Abel Ferrara from the 1990s.Of course since the 1950s the back story has always seemed timely, and relevant to each era, and here you couldn't help but think of Nicole Kidman at the mercy of the Scientologists and her battle with her former husband, and how he Tom Cruise must be furious at her playing a psychiatrist in the first place, especially one quick to dispense Adderall and other psychoactive drugs at apparently a moment's notice.  A deliberate provocation on Nic's part?  Who knows what goes on in the mind of the great stars?  She and Daniel Craig share a nice chemistry that makes me look forward to their work together in THE GOLDEN COMPASS later this year; and in fact Daniel Craig works well together with Jeffrey Wright, don't you think?  They were good as Bond and Felix Leiter in CASINO ROYALE, and here they are back again as scientist pals.All in all not a perfect movie but far better than its muddled reputation would have you think.

They almost always lose something in translation, as does this version of The Body Snatchers.They completely lost the mark here. The camera trickery did not add to the tension, it disarmed it. The flash forwards and flashbacks didn't help to keep the story in line. The opening flashback, we find out later in the film, was not a THE critical moment. For this version I think THE critical moment would have been when Nicold Kidman walks into her son's bedroom and pauses, waiting to discover if he's changed or not. The two face each other for minutes before disclosing anything. Now that would have been the critical moment.And the ending!!!! Please! Sappy sappy sappy. In each and every other version of this paranoid, claustraphobic thriller the main character ends up succumbing to the force greater than it. What could they have been thinking here?? It's actually an insult to the story.The original is the best. The third version, with Meg Tilly, is actually quite the thrilling interpretation of the story. The second version was a bit on the lame side, but kept the story.

Even both ""War of the Worlds""..and even ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and how can we forget ""The Shining"".Is it because it doesn't have an open ending like the other ones as this one has more closure on the storyline of the ""Invasion"" films in the pastI can appreciate also the slower ""thought"" process of this version. The creepiness of these people once transformed and how well they hide their alien-selves. This storyline allows for the audience to learn more insightful thoughts of the ""aliens"" and their viewpoints than in previous versions.The intro dinner scene of the Doctors thoughts on ""progressive thinking"" is brilliant..it's an insightful poignant conversation eluding to a way of thinking most humans are blinded of based on ""their"" current living era and of cultures.I don't think this movie could've been played by younger actors. Seasoned actors and Nicole Kidman was a good choice.I have also noticed, in the past 20 years..a lack of appreciation for slower developing plots in films. Or is it lack of ""attention span"" when someone isn't always getting ""whacked"" on the screen or cars getting smashed.I think what one has to ask when viewing sci-fi films..is ""Is this what I would do if I was her/him?""

Apparently the studio didn't like the cut director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered. My suspicion is that the original film, which was completed in 2006, was probably more coherent. The Wachowski brothers were hired for massive rewriting and James McTeigue directed the new scenes. The result is a film that takes an unexpected turn for the worse.What's new in this rendition is that the victims of the alien virus aren't replaced by duplicates. Instead, the virus just acts within their own bodies, changing them so that they act as one organism-- we're talking a slightly nicer version of the borg from Star Trek. The idea of a more benevolent invader would have been a fresh interesting take and was where this movie was headed before the hack job. It would have been more insidiously delightful to explore the cost benefit analysis of succumbing to the invasion. No more wars, cruelty, and poverty on one side, while the stripping of a lot of what makes us human on the other-- also the collective vs. the individual. This probably would have come closer to Don Siegel's communist cold war scare overtones in the original movieInvasion of the Body Snatchers.Instead the movie moves to more action sequences of fighting against a overtly hostile threat. This is where the original idea gets abandoned and the movie loses its way.All of the actors put in decent performances here including an admirable job by Nicole Kidman in the lead role, Daniel Craig as her love interest (an excellent new James Bond by the way), a very good cameo from Veronica Cartwright (in the 1978 remakeBody Snatchers), Jeremy Northam as the somewhat creepy ex-husband, and Jeffrey Wright as the scientist.I think the studio should take the blame for dooming a film that had some potential. It's still an enjoyable watch and worth a rental, especially for alien invasion enthusiasts.  I don't think I've ever seen a more equally distributed range of opinion by reviewers (from one to five stars). Where it all tallies out is about where I'd put it... 3 stars.P.S.

657642,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00005JPUN,Marc Cabir Davis,"[38, 46]","Someone must defend the exquisite ""The Invasion"", which was a huge critical and commercial disaster when released in 2007. Personally, I think it was way ahead of its' time, and it is quite ironic that most people are waking up to its' genius on DVD.Nicole Kidman, in perhaps her most restrained performance plays 'a woman against the world'. Holding onto her sanity while the rest of the world around her are converted literally into zombies, she plays a simple woman who has to deal with some extraordinary circumstances. I found her insomniac performance while teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown while trapped in the convenience store, to be one of her greatest screen moments.Its moments like that which define ""The Invasion"". This is NOT a film for special effects afficionados. In fact, I can't recall even one significant special effect or 'things blowing up'. What I got instead was a quiet, intelligent science fiction thriller that relied upon dialog and languid camera movement to convey a sense of fear and mayhem. In fact, the Directors' style here is an amalgamation of David Lynch and two of his best movies - ""Dune"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". The film-noir vibe is stark throughout this film, and I would say this is closer to an art film that a typical commercial thriller.Perhaps its that sensibility that made this a commercial failure. In one extended sequence, Nicole Kidman is informed that in order to escape being noticed by the zombies, you need to be 'emotionless'. Nicole then proceeds to take the train and walk the streets, and does a fine job of conveying nothingness, simply to escape being killed, while all the while her character is dying inside. Superb.The end could have been better, yes, and in fact even I was surprised at how conveniently they wrapped things up just to finish the film off. But thats a minor quibble. I preferred this vastly over last years ""Children of Men"", which I would call ""The Invasion""'s poorer cousin. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend the negativity this film attracts when in fact its certainly a science fiction classic and clearly the best film made on the Invasion theme so far.There is a film from 1994 - ""Body Snatchers"", which had the same storyline. That was another minor masterpiece that no one noticed (try looking for the DVD, it starred Gabrielle Anwar in her defining role). Its unsung movies like these that are present in the science fiction genre, and true fans of the medium such as myself will always be there to give them the respect they deserve.Ignore the negativity, and BUY this on DVD today. Its certainly worth watching more than once, and will quickly become one of your favorite movies if you give it a chance.Five Stars.",5,A Five Star Science-Fiction Classic,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2729,"['Someone', 'must', 'defend', 'exquisite', 'Invasion', 'was', 'huge', 'critical', 'commercial', 'disaster', 'when', 'released', '2007', 'Personally', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'quite', 'ironic', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'waking', 'up', 'genius', 'DVD.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'perhaps', 'most', 'restrained', 'performance', 'plays', 'woman', 'world', 'Holding', 'sanity', 'rest', 'world', 'are', 'converted', 'literally', 'zombies', 'simple', 'woman', 'who', 'deal', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'found', 'insomniac', 'performance', 'teetering', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'trapped', 'convenience', 'store', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'moments.Its', 'moments', 'define', 'Invasion', 'NOT', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'afficionados', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'even', 'one', 'significant', 'special', 'effect', ""'things"", 'blowing', 'up', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'quiet', 'intelligent', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'relied', 'dialog', 'languid', 'camera', 'movement', 'convey', 'sense', 'fear', 'mayhem', 'fact', 'Directors', 'style', 'here', 'amalgamation', 'David', 'Lynch', 'two', 'best', 'movies', 'Dune', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'film-noir', 'vibe', 'stark', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'closer', 'art', 'film', 'typical', 'commercial', 'thriller.Perhaps', 'sensibility', 'made', 'commercial', 'failure', 'one', 'extended', 'sequence', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'informed', 'order', 'escape', 'being', 'noticed', 'zombies', 'need', 'be', ""'emotionless"", 'Nicole', 'then', 'take', 'train', 'walk', 'streets', 'fine', 'job', 'conveying', 'nothingness', 'simply', 'escape', 'being', 'killed', 'character', 'dying', 'inside', 'Superb.The', 'end', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'yes', 'fact', 'even', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'conveniently', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'finish', 'film', 'off', 'minor', 'quibble', 'preferred', 'vastly', 'last', 'years', 'Children', 'Men', 'would', 'call', 'Invasion', 'poorer', 'cousin', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'negativity', 'film', 'when', 'fact', 'certainly', 'science', 'fiction', 'classic', 'clearly', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'Invasion', 'theme', 'so', 'far.There', 'film', '1994', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'had', 'same', 'storyline', 'was', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'noticed', 'try', 'looking', 'DVD', 'starred', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'defining', 'role', 'unsung', 'movies', 'are', 'present', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'true', 'fans', 'medium', 'such', 'myself', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'give', 'respect', 'deserve.Ignore', 'negativity', 'BUY', 'DVD', 'today', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'will', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'give', 'chance.Five', 'Stars']",The Invasion

But I'm a die-hard zombie buff, a fan of movies that portray a world where mindless conformity is the real villain, and I couldn't stop myself from popping a copy in and sitting back to watch the devastation.For a story with so much symbolic possibility, ""The Invasion"" is surprisingly hollow.  Impatient to get to the creepy scenes where whole hordes of people stand emotionlessly on street corners, where crowds stare impassionately as ""real"" humans are dragged screaming into dark alleys and cop cars, the movie hustles the plot through the necessary set-up and straight into the gooey guts beyond.  You're not fifteen minutes into the film before a psychiatrist (Nicole Kidman, who is so distantly cold in the film, she seems like one of ""them"" long before anyone even knows ""them"" is a threat) is listening to a patient shakily describe her husband as ""not my husband anymore.""  A little on the nose, don't you think?This kind of pushy terror doesn't really work so well, especially when what depth the movie does manage to muster is so awkward.  On the threshhold of the climax, Kidman's psychiatrist attends a fancy dinner and listens as several elderly men discuss politics and sociology.  A Russian fellow sitting next to her adamantly points out that being violent and illogical is what makes us human, and therefore should be embraced.  He might as well be wearing a name tag that says ""HELLO!  I Am The Movie's Moral Mouthpiece.""And a weird moral it is.  After ""them"" inveigles its way into brains of most of the world, the televisions are aglow with reports of peace accords across the globe.  Old feuds are finally abolished, weapons are dismantled, walls are torn down.  Can't we all just get along?  Sure!  If we're all infected with the same mind-altering space-bug.  But we're not SUPPOSED to get along, you see, and that's why a world of mindless conformity is weird and wrong.  Right?  Right?  Someone please tell me if I'm right.The most pointed part of the story involves a rather silly twist about how the space-virus finally takes effect.  You can get the microbe inside of you, but you don't turn into one of ""them"" until you fall asleep.  Kidman's psychiatrist spends much of the movie trying to stay awake, desperately afraid that she'll nod off at any moment and then wake up someone else.  It's a neat little metaphor for our own world (the movie's way of saying ""Wake up, people!"") but it's also just as heavy-handed as anything else.  Ultimately, it becomes a sad command for the audience who, by the final neat-n-tidy scenes, may find themselves struggling to stay awake and wondering why they should.",2,You Are Feeling Sleepy ...

The editing and pace of the story was excellent, writing crisp, and Ms. Kidman seems to be aging beautifully (of course ""aging"" is not the correct term to use here. Surely, the actress is growing older, but her beauty is sharper and clearer than when she was younger, as if time were shaping away all parts of her that didn't glow). Also, the film makers seemed to understand that true horror in film is always psychological and NOT physical or visceral (meaning SAW I, II, III, IV were not scary at all).But, I suppose it was inevitable. About half way in things began to unravel. The pace became overheated and characters suddenly became very, very boring. Buy the end of the film it was a stock, very un-special action/car-chase movie.Finally, whereas the book and two previous films worked from the premise that, yes, the alien invaders offered a world without war, hunger, rape, strife, etc; it was much grander and more joyful to be human.  The concept of this film was that, clearly, it would have been better to allow the aliens to take over, and the only reason the Nicole Kidman character resisted was because her son was ""immune"" to the transformation and was going to be ""taken care of.""

Spores from outer space cause a Space Shuttle crash.  Haphazardly at first, and then deliberately, these spores infect human beings and take away their individuality.  The film presents their arrival as a mixed blessing that poses a philosophical dilemma: on the one hand, it is human individuality that leads to violence and war; on the other hand, without human individuality we would be missing something essential.  What that essential thing is the film doesn't say -- apart from the only partly glib answer that Nicole Kidman's character gives when asked what makes us more than animals: that the fact we now have postmodern feminism should give us some hope for the possibility of a better world.  What this ""human"" thing that the infected peoples lose really is we can only infer from the fear that the characters in the film exhibit in the face of its loss.  The film poses a question, that in the case of this version of ""Invasion"" is more a theological than a political question: is free will and its attendant evils really worth preserving at all costs?I like that the filmmakers are willing to push for the bold response to this question -- that peace is incompatible with individuality, and that the latter would be a fair sacrifice for the former.  On the other hand, I wish they hadn't pushed it so hard as to hammer in the contemporary implications of this message. The attempt to ratchet up tension by means of flash forwards and flashbacks that suggest the gravity of a situation also felt to me a bit overdone.  The film is lacking almost completely in subtlety, and doesn't quite make up for this in scariness.  On the whole this is not a bad film and strikes me as better than at least one of the sequels to the original ""Invasion"" -- and better than I had been led to expect from some of the critical feedback when it was out in theaters -- but not as good as I think it could have been with the talent and budget that went into it.

657653,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B00005JPUN,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[1, 6]","_The Invasion_ (2007) is a modernized and updated film version of the classic 1954 science fiction novel by Jack Finney _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_, starring Nicole Kidman as Dr. Carol Bennell, a feminized version of the main character in Finney's novel.  Finney's novel has been previously adapted to film on several occasions and each time has attempted to make a comment on the given era (e.g. commenting on the communist menace, etc.); however, this version has been compared unfavorably to those other adaptations.  Nevertheless, I feel that this version has something worthwhile to say despite itself.  The film shows what happens when an extra-terrestrial disease invades the earth and turns the people of earth into emotionless zombies.  Nicole Kidman who is a divorced psychiatrist living in Washington, D.C. in the movie (perhaps a jab at Scientologist ex-husband Tom Cruise here!) must unravel the situation as she encounters patients who claim that certain of their relatives or associates are behaving oddly or are not themselves.  Together with her son (who turns out to be immune to the disease), Kidman must fend off the entire city, including her boyfriend who eventually succumbs to the disease.  As the film unravels the atmosphere of paranoia builds and Kidman who eventually becomes infected herself must keep awake, else she too will become an emotionless and mindless zombie.  In order to better blend in with the rest of the populace, Kidman adopts a posture of stoicism, thus suppressing all true emotion.  The atmosphere of parnaoia builds and at times one wonders whether the whole thing is rather not a schizophrenic delusion.  Ultimately there is a confrontation between the people as they now are and Kidman and her son.  Kidman must choose between the invading alien presence and her former life and here the movie has a comment to make.  While the invaders offer a more peaceful world, they ultimately have no room for her son among them (he being immune to the disease).  Thus, we see how in any collective there is always one who stands out and how such a person has no room in the collective.  So while the collective may be more ""peaceful"" in a sense, it also is crippling to the superior man or the one who stands out.  In this case, Kidman makes the right choice and ultimately restores the world to the way it was before.  Thus, her son is saved from the alien menace.",5,Paranoid Schizophrenia or An Inadvertent Warning Against the Dangers of Collectivism.,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2412,"['_The', 'Invasion_', '2007', 'modernized', 'updated', 'film', 'version', 'classic', '1954', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'Jack', 'Finney', '_Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers_', 'starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Dr.', 'Carol', 'Bennell', 'feminized', 'version', 'main', 'character', 'Finney', 'novel', 'Finney', 'novel', 'been', 'previously', 'adapted', 'film', 'several', 'occasions', 'time', 'attempted', 'make', 'comment', 'given', 'era', 'e.g', 'commenting', 'communist', 'menace', 'etc', 'however', 'version', 'been', 'compared', 'unfavorably', 'other', 'adaptations', 'Nevertheless', 'feel', 'version', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'say', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'extra-terrestrial', 'disease', 'earth', 'people', 'earth', 'emotionless', 'zombies', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'divorced', 'psychiatrist', 'living', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'jab', 'Scientologist', 'ex-husband', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'here', 'must', 'unravel', 'situation', 'patients', 'who', 'claim', 'certain', 'relatives', 'associates', 'are', 'behaving', 'oddly', 'are', 'not', 'Together', 'son', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'immune', 'disease', 'Kidman', 'must', 'fend', 'off', 'entire', 'city', 'including', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'eventually', 'disease', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'paranoia', 'builds', 'Kidman', 'who', 'eventually', 'infected', 'must', 'keep', 'awake', 'else', 'too', 'will', 'become', 'emotionless', 'mindless', 'zombie', 'order', 'better', 'blend', 'rest', 'populace', 'Kidman', 'posture', 'stoicism', 'thus', 'suppressing', 'true', 'emotion', 'atmosphere', 'parnaoia', 'builds', 'times', 'one', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'not', 'schizophrenic', 'delusion', 'Ultimately', 'confrontation', 'people', 'now', 'are', 'Kidman', 'son', 'Kidman', 'must', 'choose', 'invading', 'alien', 'presence', 'former', 'life', 'here', 'movie', 'comment', 'make', 'invaders', 'offer', 'more', 'peaceful', 'world', 'ultimately', 'have', 'room', 'son', 'being', 'immune', 'disease', 'Thus', 'see', 'how', 'collective', 'always', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'how', 'such', 'person', 'room', 'collective', 'So', 'collective', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'peaceful', 'sense', 'also', 'crippling', 'superior', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'case', 'Kidman', 'right', 'choice', 'ultimately', 'world', 'way', 'was', 'before', 'Thus', 'son', 'saved', 'alien', 'menace']",The Invasion

However, of course, this is not necessary, for this new version stands quite nicely all by itself.Nicole is just honey to look at and her acting is superb. And it was fun to watch Daniel Craig on vacation from his James Bond role..a chance to see another side of his acting ability.

Guys, that's not a reason to hate a film. There are plenty of great movies without any nudity, believe me. Haha, okay so anyway, I just wrapped up the 1978 version, and really, I believe it comes down to personal taste. After my third watching of The Invasion, I can safely say that I prefer it to Kaufman's gritty dirge of a film. Yes, the ending is terribly lazy, but I wasn't especially thrilled at how Kaufman's film ended, either. The 1994 remake is still probably my favorite, but this is definitely not bad. Although, the blood/viral animations portrayed in the lab are a bit cheap, the zombie who becomes abruptly conscious and grabs at her when she tries to take it's picture is stupid, there's an odd jump cut at 44:22, when she leaves her car in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and starts to run from some zombies, she looks back, the camera cuts, and in the next shot she's continuing the same motion of looking back over her shoulder but she's now in the middle of downtown. Odd. Also, the concept of transmitting the ""disease"" by vomit is indeed disgusting and stupid. The scene on the subway where vomit is being shot through the air like spitting cobra venom is awful. Luckily, they portray it only once in the beginning, and twice in the middle, and then I think you don't have to see it again.

Film at 11.Hirschbiegel, whose previous films Das Experiment and Der Untergang are two of the best films Germany's managed to come up with since the death of F. W. Murnau, took a quick plane ride to Hollywood to direct yet another film version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Because we didn't already have enough. Better yet, they saddled him with a first-time scriptwriter, David Kajganich, who has since gone on to write the screenplay for the next surefire bomb delivered by Joel Schumacher, who in the past fifteen years has stamped himself repeatedly as the worst professional director in America. Even with so many handicaps, Hirschbiegel managed to deliver something the studio didn't like, so they brought in the Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue (who was a pretty fine assistant director before coming under the Wachowski banner) to reshoot a good deal of the movie. So how much of this can actually be blamed on Oliver Hirschbiegel is subject to debate. And given the quality of his earlier output compared to that of the Wachowski Brothers, I'm very much inclined to give Hirschbiegel the benefit of the doubt, even if he didn't stick an Alan Smithee on the movie.If you've been living in a cave since 1955, the plot: pod people are taking over the planet. Someone (in this case, Nicole Kidman) notices. As the rest of the world is taken over, our fearless heroine has to find some way to combat the invasion. Here, she's helped by her pal Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and his (very convenient) acquaintance, a researcher named Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), who happens to have an entire army base at his disposal to do research. It's tough to be scared by the pods when the army is working on the problem. Okay, wait a minute. Maybe I should have been much more scared by this movie than I actually was.It doesn't help that I've already seen the movie many times, done by three other directors, but with Hirschbiegel's name stamped on it, I couldn't resist. I only found out about the Wachowski connection later. I would have avoided it, and rightly so, had I known. It's trite and predictable, with not a convincing emotion to be found anywhere. (Kind of telling when the main difference between the good guys and the bad guys is the inability to show emotion.) It's just another useless Hollywood remake; the only difference is they're cannibalizing their own instead of heading to Asia to get source material. **",2,"It's not Oliver Hirschbiegel's fault.

I expected this movie to be scary, suspenseful, and gripping. It wasn't.I did not like the editing at all. The scenes were cut too fast, moving from one shot to another at a dizzying speed.I didn't like the beginning of the movie when the Space Shuttle burns on entry and is destroyed. This scene should have been much longer. We should have seen how the alien parasite clung itself to the shuttle. Was it the reason why the shuttle crashed? We should also have seen the crew struggling to fly the Space Shuttle.Once the Shuttle crashed, the scenes rushed way too fast from identifying the parasite to it infecting people. I just felt the whole movie was rushed.Seeing Nicole Kidman run away from something at the beginning of the movie just didn't make since. The editor was trying to show us an event in the future to keep us guessing, but this didn't work. The movie should have flowed in a linear manner, not jump from a future event to a present one. This was repeated in several other scenes, and I found this to be very annoying.The disease is passed by people throwing up. I found this pretty repulsive, especially in the subway scene. Kidman's husband also throws up on her face, yet we see her in the following scene with a clean face and no stains on her shirt--very unbelievable. And what about the stench of the vomit? Kidman then meets up with researchers and eventually with her son--without having taken a bath. Didn't her husband just puke on her? Did no one smell her?The helicopter scene at the end of the movie was not well done. You could tell it was animation.Daniel Craig did not do a good job at all. He was more of a supporting actor than a principal one.At no point throughout this movie did I find myself glued to my seat. There was no suspense; nothing really exciting happening.The fact that they found a cure so quickly was also unbelievable. We are also not shown the steps taken to find the cure--was way too rushed.I didn't like the cover design of the DVD either.The only thing I liked about this movie are the following questions, ""what would life be like without humans?

For those who have seen recent remakes the majority of them rely on creating a pretty much scene by scene remake. Such movies include The Omen, Psycho, and The Amityville Horror.Anyway the invasion is not a bad movie it's just that it had so much to offer that the creators couldn't decide what to do with it. Also this movie had a troubled production; originally set to be released in 2006 the movie would go through a lot of rewrites and re shoots. From what I heard the movie was going to originally have a twist ending, but it seems that it did not qualify with the studios demands. The Wachowski brothers were also hired to rewrite the initial script; aswell the director of V For Vendetta James McTeigue was  brought in to re shoot a more action ere film. The result of course is a mish mash of ideas put into one movie.The movie begins with what seems to be the end of the film (don't worry i won't ruin anything important) the film later jumps into a scene where a NASA space craft crash lands with a alien life inside; if exposed to it the individual gets infected, the symptoms begin in REM sleep, the infected become a type of cocoon. As soon as they wake up they recollect the past memories of the host. Basically they seem human, look human, but they are not. The infected show no emotions. The ones who are not infected use this as an advantage to hide from them.Anyway the movies central plot is pretty good it even has some edge of your seat moments.

It was never an Oscar contender or high art but in my Drive-in days, this would have been a winner. We've seen various iterations of Invasion of the Body Snatchers over the past 50 years so there's no suspense in the basic premise.  This version quickly hones in on a mother and son caught up in this horror and their battle to survive. Their battle to survive is very suspenseful.  The child actor does a nice job as the son and Nicole Kidman is convincingly fierce as his mother who will do anything to protect him.  I'm reminded of Ripley in Aliens, going up against the monster to save the little girl.  This film nicely captures the heebie-jeebie factor of being forced to blend in as humans suddenly becoming souless, emotionless killers, in a sense, as the aliens' quest is to take over Earth by killing the humanity inside of us.

This is all the more so because I was on the edge of my seat and filled with the right amounts of tension the whole way through, only to be left aghast at the weak and `cop-out' ending that fizzled out without any impact. Following Nicole Kidman (who acts remarkably well in this film) and her family as they deal with the impact of an alien invasion that leaves the populations as hosts to the alien parasites, this film has excellent apocalyptic themes. You are nervous whenever she encounters an afflicted person and flinch every time she nearly gets infected and this never lets up for the duration. The story is well written and you are gripped the whole way through and then the end arrives and you are left angry and disappointed wondering what happened. At 90 minutes this isn't that long and they could have easily added an extra 15 minutes to tie things up more neatly.

657678,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPUN,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[41, 53]","Every era seems to have a connection to the ""Body Snatchers"" as there have been about 4 films so far that are based on the classic tale and it has spawned numerous similarily themed films and silly rip-offs (Invasion of the Pod People).The first version and arguably the best isInvasion of the Body Snatchers(1956) which dealt with McCarthism.  The next take on the classic came in 1978 withInvasion of the Body Snatchersand has become my favorite version of the tale.  It focused on our need to be emotional even when it makes no sense, hence, the appearance of Leonard Nimoy in the film who built a career playing Spock, part emotionless Vulcan and part human, on Star Trek.  Then there cameBody Snatchersin 1994 and although that was a rather forgettable version, it did have something to say about the ""me"" and ""greed"" era of the 1980's.Now we have ""The Invasion"" in which Nicole Kidman takes on Leonard Nimoy's supporting role in the 1978 version and makes it the starring role.  She is well-supported by the new James Bond, Daniel Craig (Casino Royale, and even the actor who plays the new Felix Liter in the same Bond film.  In addition, there is Jeremy Northam (The Net) who has made a nice career playing heavies, and in a moment of inspirational casting there is Veronica Cartwright playing a patient of Kidman's.Cartwright was terrific inAlien(the first one) and has been in more supporting roles in film and television than I can remember.  But why is she so memorable for being in this film?  She was in the 1978 version ofInvasion of the Body Snatcherswith Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, and Leonard Nimoy.  She is a consistently strong supporting actress and to see her return 30 years later in this remake is fun and it's nice that her role isn't some small cameo either.The film itself is rather unremarkable even though it is enjoyable.  I think it may end up being only a bit more remembered than the 1994 version of this tale only because of it's cast as the direction, effects, music, and photography are all rather pedestrian.  In addition, many may recall this film for NOT having the infamous ""pods"" for which this tale is so well-known for.  While this makes this take a bit unique, I think it's a flaw as it treats the invasion more as an infection and less than an interglatic fight to exist as we are and not as another being would have us be and that is ironically the focus of this film even though that isn't played up until near the end (as if it were an after-thought).This tale continues to be haunting even with the lackadaisical approach here because this tale speaks to us in this era that seems to suggest that everyone not exactly like one group is wrong or bad.  We have become in this era rather ethnocentric and this film lightly explores how if we were all alike there would be no more wars, distrust, hate and so forth, but for that kind of world we must give up our souls.  In the end, this film attempts to redeem it's own pointlessness by throwing in the question of whether is it better to have wars over religion, status, wealth, etc. or have peace at the cost of not being who we are and our right to express that.The film wastes the talents of all by only hinting on this theme rather than exploring it with more depth and sincerity as the previous versions explored their visions of paranoia, isolationism, and the deadening of emotions in an ever increasingly violent world.  For this lack of seriousness and earnestness this film is all too much like the 1994 version which was more like this one in that it had a good cast and was appropriately chilling, but lacked significant punch and/or influence.This film is mild popcorn fun and the whole family can see it, but don't expect it to hold up to the first two far superior versions of this timeless tale.",3,Yet another remake of a classic story.,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,3813,"['era', 'have', 'connection', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'have', 'been', '4', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'based', 'classic', 'tale', 'spawned', 'numerous', 'similarily', 'themed', 'films', 'silly', 'rip-offs', 'Invasion', 'Pod', 'People', '.The', 'first', 'version', 'arguably', 'best', 'isInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', '1956', 'dealt', 'McCarthism', 'next', 'take', 'classic', 'came', '1978', 'withInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatchersand', 'become', 'favorite', 'version', 'tale', 'focused', 'need', 'be', 'emotional', 'even', 'when', 'sense', 'hence', 'appearance', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'film', 'who', 'built', 'career', 'playing', 'Spock', 'part', 'emotionless', 'Vulcan', 'part', 'human', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Then', 'cameBody', 'Snatchersin', '1994', 'was', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'version', 'did', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'greed', 'era', ""1980's.Now"", 'have', 'Invasion', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'supporting', 'role', '1978', 'version', 'starring', 'role', 'well-supported', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'even', 'actor', 'who', 'new', 'Felix', 'Liter', 'same', 'Bond', 'film', 'addition', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Net', 'who', 'made', 'nice', 'career', 'playing', 'heavies', 'moment', 'inspirational', 'casting', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'playing', 'patient', ""Kidman's.Cartwright"", 'was', 'terrific', 'inAlien', 'first', 'one', 'been', 'more', 'supporting', 'roles', 'film', 'television', 'can', 'remember', 'why', 'so', 'memorable', 'being', 'film', 'was', '1978', 'version', 'ofInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatcherswith', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'consistently', 'strong', 'supporting', 'actress', 'see', 'return', '30', 'years', 'later', 'remake', 'fun', 'nice', 'role', ""n't"", 'small', 'cameo', 'either.The', 'film', 'rather', 'unremarkable', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'bit', 'more', 'remembered', '1994', 'version', 'tale', 'only', 'cast', 'direction', 'effects', 'music', 'photography', 'are', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'addition', 'many', 'may', 'recall', 'film', 'NOT', 'having', 'infamous', 'pods', 'tale', 'so', 'well-known', 'take', 'bit', 'unique', 'think', 'flaw', 'invasion', 'more', 'infection', 'less', 'interglatic', 'fight', 'exist', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'ironically', 'focus', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'played', 'up', 'end', 'were', 'after-thought', '.This', 'tale', 'be', 'haunting', 'even', 'lackadaisical', 'approach', 'here', 'tale', 'speaks', 'era', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'not', 'exactly', 'one', 'group', 'wrong', 'bad', 'have', 'become', 'era', 'rather', 'ethnocentric', 'film', 'lightly', 'how', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'wars', 'distrust', 'hate', 'so', 'forth', 'kind', 'world', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'souls', 'end', 'film', 'redeem', 'own', 'pointlessness', 'throwing', 'question', 'better', 'have', 'wars', 'religion', 'status', 'wealth', 'etc', 'have', 'peace', 'cost', 'not', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'right', 'express', 'that.The', 'film', 'talents', 'only', 'hinting', 'theme', 'rather', 'exploring', 'more', 'depth', 'sincerity', 'previous', 'versions', 'explored', 'visions', 'paranoia', 'isolationism', 'deadening', 'emotions', 'ever', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'world', 'lack', 'seriousness', 'earnestness', 'film', 'too', 'much', '1994', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'was', 'appropriately', 'chilling', 'lacked', 'significant', 'punch', 'and/or', 'influence.This', 'film', 'mild', 'popcorn', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hold', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'far', 'superior', 'versions', 'timeless', 'tale']",The Invasion

657681,AU9ND05L99YSG,B00005JPUN,TheHorrorMovieCritic,"[1, 1]","The Invasion is remake of the 1950's sci fi film, ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Hollywood has already produced two remakes and one TV spin off. I guess folks really relish in the idea of invaders coming to Earth and snatching our bodies. This latest iteration was driven by a large budget and a couple of sexy stars.Nicole Kidman stars as psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, and besides looking like the fine Aussie vixen she is, there isn't much for her to do. The films other big star, Daniel Craig, is so criminally underused he might as well not even be in it. This leaves Kidman to carry the film and frankly she doesn't look like she really gives a crap.The first half of The Invasion is gripping and the story unfolds nicely, if not predictably. It starts going downhill during a dinner party scene where some Russian guy spits out some nonsense rhetoric. It's supposed to make you think, but I hate when a movie spells out the exact message it's trying to convey. Shortly after, the film resorts to redundant chase scenes of Kidman trying to protect her dopey son, Oliver. Once most of the populace has turned into aliens, there are some genuinely uneasy moments, but these are few and far between. The ending is really bland and it fails at the deep, psychological impact it was going for.Like most aliens, the little spores in The Invasion don't ""come in peace"" and are rather hell-bent on assimilating all of mankind into their cold and detached species. This is done by projectile vomiting on a person's face or ingesting something an alien has blown chunks into. Charming isn't it? Once a human being has ingested the host, they eventually go to sleep and wake up an emotionless alien. The transformation effects are mostly CG and they look abysmal. After someone falls asleep it looks like Ron Jeremy crept up to them and rubbed one out on their face. However, instead of looking real viscous and gooey...it appears flat, fake and clearly digitized. It's lame and it minimizes any real chance this film had at leaving a terrifying imprint on its audience.The Invasion is a squandered opportunity for a decent remake. It's clearly trying to exploit our disease fearing, xenophobic civilization but it ultimately falls flat. The excellent cast isn't given much to work with and let's be honest...there is much better sci-fi horror out there. I'm sure some will find it interesting, but most of you will be bored.

657682,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPUN,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 5]","""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".... Er, ""The Invasion"", the second remake of the popular, iconic Science Fiction film, is not a bad film. It is just a very familiar film. It does manage to create some good thrills and it sets the story against the backdrop of our current political climate in an unusual way, giving it a little more interest than the tired material has any right to generate.A shuttle burns up upon reentry causing debris to land across a wide swath of the United States. Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), a member of the CDC, visits one of the crash sites and gets a cut on his hand. Dr. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) notices people starting to act strange and turns to her best friend, Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig). He takes a small sample of the material to a friend of his, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) and they soon learn the substance is not of this Earth. Carol's son, Oliver (Jackson Bond) is also having nightmares and Carol thinks it is because he is about to start spending time with his father, Tucker, who has recently returned from Atlanta. But Tucker is one of the first infected and starts acting weird, showing little emotion. One of Carol's patients (Veronica Cartwright, who appeared in the 1978 version of the film) complains that her husband is acting differently; they no longer fight and she claims he is no longer her husband. As she begins to voice these concerns, Carol begins to notice other strange things; people are staring at her as she walks by, no one shows any emotion when a car hits a woman. Carol soon realizes she must stay awake, find her son, and join her two friends as they try to get to Fort Dix and work on an antidote.Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel (""Downfall""), with an apparent assist from the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy, more on that later), ""The Invasion"" does a fairly good job of setting up the story; the shuttle explosion allows the wreckage to land in a wide area covering approximately 200 miles, exposing millions to the infection. The alien material is on the pieces of the shuttle and as soon as someone touches a piece of the wreckage, they become infected. Naturally, they then infect others. And so on and so forth. As these infected people become more prominent, they become bolder and take less precaution in the next stages of their plans. When they become more prominent, become the majority, they have no reason to try to cover up and simply start grabbing people off the street.The director does a good job of setting up Carol's universe and using that as an indicator of the state of the Invasion. One day, as Carol walks into her office building, she notices certain things, the next day, they are different. But we get the idea that she is used to the things she noticed in the first way, so when they are different, even though they don't appear that different, she notices. And they seem strange to her, startling her, causing her to start to look at everything with new, critical eyes.""The Invasion"" borrows many of the key elements that made the first two films so successful. And they continue to work in this new version. In order to move among the infected undetected, Carol learns she must show no emotion. So, as she walks through large crowds, and they watch a couple commit suicide, a woman standing near Carol screams at the sight. As Carol moves away, the infected round up the emotional woman and prepare to convert her.There are nice touches included throughout. As Carol learns specific things about the invasion, these elements are used to create little moments of suspense only the audience knows about. Because we are in on the information, when the character in question is not, we feel a bigger part of the action. It is an old idea that Hitchcock perfected. Hirschbegel is no Hitchcock, but he gives it a game try.""The Invasion"" is a film that should not have been released in the summer. Expectations are too high during this period and if any release doesn't make at least $50 million in its opening weekend, it is a flop, which is a crazy illustration of how excessive this industry has become. Apparently, someone decided the film was a little too low key for their liking and producer Joel Silver called in the Wachowski Brothers to do a rewrite and reshoot some scenes. From what I understand, they redid the car chases in the film. And they are impressively shot, but they don't really need to be that impressive for this film. ""The Invasion"" would be a much more successful film if it stuck to the task of building tension rather than orchestrating car chases. If ""The Invasion"" were released in the fall, it would probably have been able to maintain the original feel and tone. It might have been a much better film for it.Nicole Kidman plays the Kevin McCarthy/ Donald Sutherland role. As psychiatrist Dr. Carol Bennell, she is a bit aloof and emotionally unattached to the rest of the characters. She is the type of mother who, because of her job, tries to interpret her son's nightmares. She also can't get too attached to Ben, because she can't lose her best friend. Really, she doesn't want to have the emotional attachment, and deal with the possibility of losing that. As she becomes enmeshed in the crisis, she makes smart decisions and stays just slightly ahead of the infected.I find it odd that Nicole Kidman has almost made a career of playing emotionally unattached women. Every role she plays, with a few exceptions, is emotionally aloof, manipulative or conniving, or simply crazy and can't show any genuine emotion. In some of her films, this type of thing works. In others, it doesn't. This type of performance doesn't serve her particularly well in ""The Invasion""; it would be nice to see her show some emotion to offset those moments when she is unable to do so, trying to fly under the radar of the aliens.Daniel Craig is a bit one-dimensional, little more than a sidekick to Carol. When she needs muscle, he provides it. When she needs something, he is there to provide it. He is even unable to provide her with the medical information she needs; he has to take that to a friend of his, for analysis. It seems strange that they didn't make him a different type of doctor and allow him to provide this important piece of the puzzle. As it is, he is simply Carol's frustrated boy toy.Jeffrey Wright plays the doctor with the information about the infectious agent and Jeremy Northam plays Carol's ex-husband and the man who is largely responsible for spreading the invasion throughout the United States. And then the world. Both are good, but unspectacular and not very memorable.Set in ""Present Day"", ""The Invasion"" shows the effect of the aliens taking over our minds and bodies giving the story a unique, timely slant. It is a nice touch, giving the film just a touch of political conscience and giving us just a bit of a political message.""The Invasion"" has enough going for it that it would definitely make a suitable DVD rental. But it is such a familiar story and executed in a familiar way that you will not have enough surprises to warrant the time and money of a trip to the local multiplex.",2,Interesting Take On Very Tired

657683,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B00005JPUN,Tristan,"[2, 2]","The Invasion, a remake of the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, is actually a very well made and executed remake. Greatly aiding this remake is Nicole Kidman's performance which helps the film along immensely as well as the intelligent script and stylish camera work.After a space shuttle explodes on its' re-entry back to earth pieces of it litter the neighborhoods and fields below. The particles of debris bring a deadly virus that spreads quickly from person to person before scientists are able to retrieve it. Meanwhile Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell a psychiatrist whose starts realizing something is wrong. Daniel Craig plays Ben Driscoll a doctor and friend of Carol's who is coming to the same realization. When Carol finds a mysterious moving piece of visible organism on one of her son's friends, she takes it to Ben to have it checked out. The story quickly picks-up from here and then speeds up even more, stopping only very briefly for the conclusion.I am normally not a fan of sci-fi/alien/virus movies but, this was done so well through the performance of the actors, and the filmmakers that it draws you in at the opening scene! I really liked how you do not see the virus spreading. Almost everything is seen through Carol's eyes so you do not realize the how bad the situation is until almost everyone is in infected. And as Carol flees from them, running into more wherever she turns, it slowly draws you into this horrifyingly claustrophobic world, and holds you, building the tension, not letting go until the end.As I said Nicole Kidman does a wonderful performance as always, Daniel Craig is charming as ever, and Jeremy Northam plays his role chillingly well as the ex-husband of Carol.Overall a extremely well made, well acted remake, that at the very end turns almost insightful.",3,Is that the REAL you?,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,1813,"['Invasion', 'remake', '1978', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'executed', 'remake', 'Greatly', 'aiding', 'remake', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'film', 'along', 'immensely', 'as', 'well', 'intelligent', 'script', 'stylish', 'camera', 'work.After', 'space', 'shuttle', 're-entry', 'back', 'earth', 'pieces', 'neighborhoods', 'fields', 'particles', 'debris', 'bring', 'deadly', 'virus', 'quickly', 'person', 'person', 'scientists', 'are', 'able', 'retrieve', 'Meanwhile', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Carol', 'Bennell', 'psychiatrist', 'starts', 'realizing', 'something', 'wrong', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Ben', 'Driscoll', 'doctor', 'friend', 'Carol', 'who', 'coming', 'same', 'realization', 'When', 'Carol', 'mysterious', 'moving', 'piece', 'visible', 'organism', 'one', 'son', 'friends', 'Ben', 'have', 'checked', 'out', 'story', 'quickly', 'picks-up', 'here', 'then', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'stopping', 'only', 'very', 'briefly', 'conclusion.I', 'am', 'normally', 'not', 'fan', 'sci-fi/alien/virus', 'movies', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'performance', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'opening', 'scene', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'virus', 'spreading', 'Almost', 'everything', 'seen', 'Carol', 'eyes', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'bad', 'situation', 'almost', 'everyone', 'infected', 'Carol', 'running', 'more', 'slowly', 'horrifyingly', 'claustrophobic', 'world', 'building', 'tension', 'not', 'letting', 'go', 'end.As', 'said', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'always', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'charming', 'ever', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'role', 'chillingly', 'well', 'ex-husband', 'Carol.Overall', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'remake', 'very', 'end', 'almost', 'insightful']",The Invasion
657684,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPUN,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Jack Finney's famous story, which is the basis of Don Siegel's classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" is remade again with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Considering the names involved in this new project, including German director Oliver Hirschbiegel known for his outstanding ""Downfall"" and ""The Experiment,"" the 2007 version should be a great thriller - the producers must have thought so, and so did I.Nicole Kidman is Carol Bennell who realizes that something weird is going on in the city of Washington DC where she works as psychiatrist. For the reasons that I should not reveal here, Carol knows she should not sleep in order to protect her beloved son Oliver from ""them,"" but I think you know the original story. Sorry, but this is the only part I was intrigued during the film. Oh, but I like the ""vomits"" part, though.Unfortunately the newest version misses every chance to be a good if not better adaptation of the great story. This time it is set in a bigger city and the film also (rather unnecessarily) touches the subjects like a tragic space shuttle accident, but the film moves on with a hectic speed without fully developing the meaning of the new settings. An interesting ""What if"" scenario is certainly there - are we still happy when we stop hearing any more news of war and terrorism in this way?However, the story is more ""rushed"" than ""slick,"" going from one scene to another without taking time to building up the atmosphere of impeding dangers, so the results are boring (and familiar devices like barking dogs and nods to older versions including Veronica Cartwright's character do not help much). What is worse (for me) is the concluding chapters where Nicole Kidman's character is seen driving a car madly like Kurt Russell in ""Grindhouse."" The stunts themselves are great like any other Joel Silver films, but I expected to see something entirely different.But perhaps that is the way Oliver Hirschbiegel may be feeling about the film, which, according to IMDb, went through re-shooting. We may be able to see another and hopefully better version of the film and until then, two stars.",2,"Another Remake of ""Body Snatchers""",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2120,"['Jack', 'Finney', 'famous', 'story', 'basis', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'classic', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'remade', 'again', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Considering', 'names', 'involved', 'new', 'project', 'including', 'German', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Hirschbiegel', 'known', 'outstanding', 'Downfall', 'Experiment', '2007', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'thriller', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'so', 'so', 'did', 'I.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Carol', 'Bennell', 'who', 'something', 'weird', 'going', 'city', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'psychiatrist', 'reasons', 'should', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'Carol', 'should', 'not', 'sleep', 'order', 'protect', 'beloved', 'son', 'Oliver', 'think', 'know', 'original', 'story', 'Sorry', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'intrigued', 'film', 'Oh', 'like', 'vomits', 'part', 'though.Unfortunately', 'newest', 'version', 'chance', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'adaptation', 'great', 'story', 'time', 'set', 'bigger', 'city', 'film', 'also', 'rather', 'unnecessarily', 'subjects', 'tragic', 'space', 'shuttle', 'accident', 'film', 'moves', 'hectic', 'speed', 'fully', 'developing', 'meaning', 'new', 'settings', 'interesting', 'What', 'scenario', 'certainly', 'are', 'still', 'happy', 'when', 'stop', 'hearing', 'more', 'news', 'war', 'terrorism', 'way', 'However', 'story', 'more', 'rushed', 'slick', 'going', 'one', 'scene', 'taking', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'impeding', 'dangers', 'results', 'are', 'boring', 'familiar', 'devices', 'barking', 'dogs', 'nods', 'older', 'versions', 'including', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'much', 'What', 'worse', 'concluding', 'chapters', 'where', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'seen', 'driving', 'car', 'madly', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Grindhouse', 'stunts', 'are', 'great', 'other', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'films', 'expected', 'see', 'something', 'entirely', 'different.But', 'perhaps', 'way', 'Oliver', 'Hirschbiegel', 'may', 'be', 'feeling', 'film', 'according', 'IMDb', 'went', 're-shooting', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'hopefully', 'better', 'version', 'film', 'then', 'two', 'stars']",The Invasion
657685,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005JPUN,Turfseer,"[0, 1]","The Invasion did not get a very good critical reception and I wonder why that's so. After all, this is a sci-fi movie about bodies being snatched by aliens. If you count up all the positive things in 'The Invasion', that will balance out the bad. Therefore, this film ranks a passable ""5"".Let's look at the good things first. 'The Invasion' starts off simply and effectively. A shuttle craft plummets to earth after some kind of malfunction. Pieces of the craft contain alien spores which can infect and ultimately take over peoples' DNA after they fall asleep. The spores start spreading after souvenir hunters start picking up pieces of the doomed craft (there's a great line about someone selling a piece of the wreckage on eBay).Tension builds as we see how the transformation of ordinary people into zombies affects the protagonist, Carol Bennell (a psychiatrist played by Nicole Kidman). We see these transformations beginning with one of Carol's patients who claims she no longer recognizes her abusive husband as someone she really knows (instead of abusing her, he kills the family dog without emotion!). Then when Carol leaves the office, the camera pans out to reveal what has happened to the wider society--now the 'pod people' walk around with blank stares on their faces while the enforcers amongst their group grab 'normal' people and infect them against their will. In a sense, the pod people (or better yet, the spore people) are a metaphor for cult-like societies (such as North Korea) who brainwash their followers into slave-like submission.Carol's ex-husband, Tucker, works for the Center for Disease Control and he's infected early by the alien invaders. He returns from Atlanta (where he's had no contact with his son for two years) and suddenly wants visitation rights from Carol who has no choice to now let her ex see her son. Tucker obviously wants to infect the son, Oliver, (winningly played by an extremely talented child actor, Jackson Bond) but it turns out he's immune due to having contracted chicken pox as a very young child (don't ask me to explain the science behind why he develops an immunity). The rest of the movie is taken up with Carol trying to save her son from Tucker's clutches and also trying to avoid falling asleep after Tucker infects her.I think that Nicole Kidman signed on to make this movie precisely because one of the themes is that the maternal bond is elemental. Carol bonds with Oliver and the two actors have great chemistry together (despite this being a horror movie, many women will be drawn to it due to the mother/son chemistry). Daniel Craig (looking much better than how he appears in the James Bond movies) is effective as Ben Driscoll as a low-key scientist who's trying to help Carol escape the clutches of the aliens.A group of supporting actors in a scene taking place at the Russian Embassy also gives 'The Invasion' a brief window of respectability. Driscoll's friends are a Czech couple who are friends with the Russian Ambassador, Yorish. He ironically argues with Carol that the Social Dawinism of his hot-headed Russian culture is far superior to the wishy-washy liberalism of the West (pointing out that she seeks to take the fire out of her patients by dulling them with psychotropic medication).'The Invasion' falters in the first half due to the screenwriter's insistence on depicting Carol as being completely myopic. Despite the fact that she is a psychiatrist and would naturally be skeptical of some of her patients' claims, there are too many clues that would cause her to become aware of the alien invasion much sooner than how it occurs in the storyline. The writers could have solved this lack of plausibility by perhaps establishing early on that Carol is one of those professional people who is so completely devoted to science and so contemptuous of anything that might smack of the supernatural that it would blind her to what was actually going on around her.The second half of 'The Invasion' becomes repetitious with too many chase scenes and the clich&eacute; of Driscoll, Carol's best friend, suddenly being taken over by the aliens at the film's climax. Jeffrey Wright is completely forgettable as Dr. Galeano, Driscoll's buddy who develops the vaccine that saves humanity. Finally, I didn't buy at all the news media's failure to uncover the alien invasion. Despite the horrific changes in the vast majority of the population, early on there had to be some uninfected people in the media who would have broadcast what was going on, not only on television but on the internet as well. Instead, the obvious changes are labeled as ""flu-like symptoms"".I found 'The Invasion' to be mildly entertaining. Plotwise, it sort of ran out of ideas in the second half but technically the film was well-served by excellent editing and a moody and introspective soundtrack.",3,Not as bad as some critics said it
