1012843,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000HCPS8U,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","Coming off the coattails of 'Rumor Has It,' Jennifer Anniston rises to popularity in 'The Break Up,' which is well deserved because she gives a great performance.  Too bad she isn't in as good a movie.Here she plays Brooke Meyers, a Chicago art dealer.  She meets Gary Grabowski (Vince Vaughn), a Chicago tour guide with a funny, spirited pitch for tourists.  They meet at a hallmark Chicago place, Wrigley Field, for a Cubs' game.  He sees her, falls in love, and tries to flirt with her, buying her a hot dog, while ignoring the fact she has a date.  She brushes off all his one liners, but in the next scene they're living together, so his persistence has paid off.  A scrapbook of scenes shows the highlights of their loving relationship.  Then, as we're up to date, it all rips apart.  The situation is not unlike 'The Honeymooners' with the subject matter of Bob Becker's popular play 'Defending the Caveman'.  The relatives of both lovers show how the house is divided.  Her family and friends are eccentric artists, and his are ruggedly, well..., Grabowskis.  For anyone from Chicago know, it's about tailgating, beer and brats, ball games, and wearing your condiments on your favorite sport's team T-shirts.  The differences are accentuated when he makes an analogy about Michaelangelo finishing his ""Sixteenth Chapel"".  After too much attention to the remote, she loses it, and after not being considerate about his slob space and den time for sports and heavy Nintendo games, he loses it.  And her.  Most of the movie shows how they try to win each other back.  The usual hand is played:  She dates other men to make him jealous; he invites the boys over, has wild women playing strip poker, and makes a lot of caveman noise.  They split the condo up like Fred and Wilma in 'The Flintstones'.  They're both hurt, but reconciliation isn't easy.In 'The Honeymooners' Ralph Cramdon was a riot--in both senses of the word.  When he built up to a crescendo, he delivered his funniest lines.  Here we get a lot of yelling, but it's only when the swearing and shouting dies down do we get any laughs.  Some of the best scenes are the tenderest, and here Jennifer Anniston shows some fine acting.  She totally knows her character and goes for a great range and depth of emotion.  Vince Vaughn as Gary delivers a multifaceted performance.  Hardly a cardboard caveman, we see a real person behind the boy with men's Nike's.  Movies are art, and art is meant to reflect and transcend real life.  It delivers gourmet pizza for the former; for the latter it  is comes off as stale and irritating.  Too bad it isn't billed as a documentary with laughs added.  As much as the story resembles a sit-com, it is given a cinematic treatment, however.  Developed from story ideas by Vaughn, himself, 'The Break Up' is much like another live-in-with-strife drama-comedy, 'About Last Night' from the mid-80's with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe.  Both even take place in the singles' scene of Chicago.  But while this rendition is well acted, it needs a fresher script and bigger laughs.  'The Break Up' may end up reminding people more of scenes from 'That Old Feeling'.  As a movie, it is realistic, but, as entertainment or enlightenment, it breaks up.  Many people suffering from damaged relationships may find solace in this movie, however.  For them it will be a hit--like a homerun made at Wrigley Field.",2,Women Are from Art Galleries; Men Are from Bowling Alleys,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,3393,"['Coming', 'off', 'coattails', ""'Rumor"", 'Has', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'popularity', ""'The"", 'Break', 'Up', 'well', 'deserved', 'great', 'performance', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'movie.Here', 'Brooke', 'Meyers', 'Chicago', 'art', 'dealer', 'Gary', 'Grabowski', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Chicago', 'tour', 'guide', 'funny', 'spirited', 'pitch', 'tourists', 'meet', 'hallmark', 'Chicago', 'place', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'Cubs', 'game', 'love', 'tries', 'flirt', 'buying', 'hot', 'dog', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'date', 'one', 'liners', 'next', 'scene', ""'re"", 'living', 'together', 'persistence', 'paid', 'off', 'scrapbook', 'scenes', 'highlights', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Then', ""'re"", 'up', 'date', 'rips', 'apart', 'situation', 'not', ""'The"", 'Honeymooners', 'subject', 'matter', 'Bob', 'Becker', 'popular', 'play', ""'Defending"", 'Caveman', 'relatives', 'lovers', 'show', 'how', 'house', 'divided', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'eccentric', 'artists', 'are', 'ruggedly', 'well', 'Grabowskis', 'anyone', 'Chicago', 'know', 'tailgating', 'beer', 'brats', 'ball', 'games', 'wearing', 'condiments', 'favorite', 'sport', 'team', 'T-shirts', 'differences', 'are', 'accentuated', 'when', 'analogy', 'Michaelangelo', 'finishing', 'Sixteenth', 'Chapel', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'remote', 'not', 'being', 'considerate', 'slob', 'space', 'den', 'time', 'sports', 'heavy', 'Nintendo', 'games', 'Most', 'movie', 'how', 'try', 'win', 'other', 'back', 'usual', 'hand', 'played', 'other', 'men', 'make', 'jealous', 'boys', 'wild', 'women', 'playing', 'strip', 'poker', 'lot', 'caveman', 'noise', 'split', 'condo', 'up', 'Fred', 'Wilma', ""'The"", 'Flintstones', ""'re"", 'hurt', 'reconciliation', ""n't"", 'easy.In', 'Honeymooners', 'Ralph', 'Cramdon', 'was', 'riot', 'senses', 'word', 'When', 'built', 'up', 'crescendo', 'delivered', 'funniest', 'lines', 'Here', 'get', 'lot', 'yelling', 'only', 'when', 'swearing', 'shouting', 'dies', 'down', 'do', 'get', 'laughs', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'tenderest', 'here', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'fine', 'acting', 'totally', 'character', 'great', 'range', 'depth', 'emotion', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Gary', 'multifaceted', 'performance', 'Hardly', 'cardboard', 'caveman', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'boy', 'men', 'Nike', 'Movies', 'are', 'art', 'art', 'meant', 'reflect', 'transcend', 'real', 'life', 'gourmet', 'pizza', 'former', 'latter', 'off', 'stale', 'irritating', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'billed', 'documentary', 'laughs', 'added', 'As', 'much', 'story', 'sit-com', 'given', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'however', 'Developed', 'story', 'ideas', 'Vaughn', 'Break', 'Up', 'much', 'live-in-with-strife', 'drama-comedy', 'Last', 'Night', 'mid-80', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'even', 'take', 'place', 'singles', 'scene', 'Chicago', 'rendition', 'well', 'acted', 'fresher', 'script', 'bigger', 'laughs', ""'The"", 'Break', 'Up', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'reminding', 'people', 'more', 'scenes', ""'That"", 'Old', 'Feeling', 'movie', 'realistic', 'entertainment', 'enlightenment', 'up', 'Many', 'people', 'suffering', 'damaged', 'relationships', 'may', 'find', 'solace', 'movie', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'homerun', 'made', 'Wrigley', 'Field']",N/A
1012844,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HCPS8U,A Customer,"[35, 45]","In order to appreciate The Break-Up you really have to suspend disbelief at the reasons why a couple like Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) would actually come together in the first place. The film is well acted and fast paced and also entertaining, and it does a generally good job of showing what happens when love turns into a weapon of mutual destruction.It's just I didn't quite buy the fact that a somewhat educated and cultured girl like Brooke who works as a art-gallery curator and likes going to the ballet would actually see in a working class schlep like Gary, a voluble if considerably doughy charmer who, with his two brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Cole Hauser), runs a guided tourist service in Chicago.If you can get beyond this strange lapse of logic, The Break-Up is a mostly fun and astute and features the lovely Jennifer and the clever Vince at their snappish best.  The story itself is pretty slim: Brook and Gary meet at a Cubs game, fall in love hard, buy a showpiece apartment together and live happily ever after. All this happens in the opening credits.It doesn't take long, however, for the cracks to appear in the relationship and the fights inevitably start coming. He doesn't buy the right number of lemons for a dinner party she's hosting for their respective families, and then doesn't do the dishes until she nags him to help. She doesn't understand his needs, which is basically relaxing after a hard day on his feet and watching the ball game. So consequently, after a bitter argument, Brooke impulsively puts an end to their relationship.The big problem is that they both own the apartment together, and over the next couple of weeks things get worse. Lines are drawn over who can do what and trivial disagreements break out over common space, noise, and eventually escalating into Brooke inviting over dates, Gary inviting over strippers, moving in a pool table, and everything else as the relationship spirals out of control.The couple's realtor (Jason Bateman) and shared friends, including Maddie (Joey Lauren Adams) and Johnny (Jon Favreau), all get caught up and are forced to take sides. But will Brooke and Gary be able to sort out their differences and stay together, or is the relationship doomed to failure?I think the strength of the film comes from the biting repartee that takes place between Aniston and Vaughn, especially in the earlier scenes. You really do believe that they are - and have been - a committed couple that are about to explode with frustration at each other's failings. The actors indeed imbue Gary and Brooke with moments of sincere woundedness and the film's arguments - that relationships are essentially about mutual respect and about give and take - come across as remarkably authentic.As usual in these sorts of Hollywood romantic comedies - and using the term romantic loosely - the supporting cast is filled out with a number of veterans. Judy Davis steals every scene she's in as Brooke's eccentric art gallery boss and Ann Margaret makes a surprise appearance as Brooke's mother.But the movie ultimately belongs to both Aniston and Vaughn - she's tanned and toned and looks fantastic and he does what he does best - playing the permissive man-child who just refuses to take responsibility for anything, either personal or professional.The film stalls a bit in its final third; as though the producers are intent to pad the story out and Brooke's motivations for doing what she does remain bit of an enigma - first she loves him then she doesn't and we're left to infer some of her feelings rather than bear witness to them. In the end, though, The Break-Up is at least partially notable for showing both lead actors at their best, but the film also shows off some terrific views of the beautiful city of Chicago.

Vaughn on the other hand is so annoying in this, he's just a bad actor - I don't understand what Aniston saw in him off-screen? He has no appeal and you just want to punch him in the face!

Since I have enjoyed each of the actor's previous material I thought that this movie would be a shoe -in, considering that both of these individuals are amazingly gifted in their own right.  But I must say that my father of whom I was watching the film with hit it on the head when he said, ""I can live this/I have lived this, I don't need to watch it on television, I'm finished.""Hey, what can you say?  The Break Up is a movie that drags you through the worst part of a relationship.  When you see the worst of the person that you perhaps initially you thought they were your ""sole mate"".  I'm not saying that the characters are not interesting, you probably have friends that are similar to the two people that are portrayed in Vaughn and Aniston.  In the movie they portray people that could not be further from each other as Vaughn plays a tour guide of which he is in business with his two of brothers that out of Polish descent.  Vaughn's characters loves his Chicago Cubs (the film is based in Chicago), plays video games throughout the films and likes to drink. On the flip side Aniston plays a college education, upper middle class white women that works at an art gallery, cares about the little things in life and doesn't count going to college football as dates, but instead goes because her man wanted to go, which I believe is very common in the world today.Is The Break Up a comedy or a drama?  It is probably a good example of both.  I say that because if you have ever been in a committed relationship you will laugh at the cheap shots that each character throughout the film, but on a deeper level you find part of yourself just hoping that they can patch it together by the movie's end.  You begin to see the hurt that each person feels, how the hurt settles in and then one all of the dust and yelling settles you realize what has happened.  Yes, your lives are officially separate after all of the work that each other put into the relationship in the first place and you start to wonder how did it happen?

Outside of the standard images that depict dejected men as able to get vuluptuous women into their apartment on call while ""sulking"", it refreshingly had believable guy/girl arguments. The final argument that causes the breakup was done with such good acting that it caused me to wish for equal material throughout the movie.The scene at the concert when Jennifer Aniston gets stood up was also one of the most effective empathy grabbers I've seen in a while. I felt so bad for her that I genuinely wanted all this bad blood between the two of them to quickly end. As she cried in her bedroom, I knew this was the best acting I've ever seen Aniston do. Vince Vaughn played off her distress convincingly. Although annoyingly exaggerated at times, Vaughn captured many a man's words with enough accuracy to summon up my own personal regrets.At the art gallery, the actress Judy Davis who plays Aniston's boss stood out and handled what could have been a yawner with deft and charm. Some detraction lies in the usual attempts by directors to be so super-comedic that a film can lose realism. That hand unfortunately got played one too many times. This caused an otherwise smooth film to occasionally revert back to a clunky dime-a-dozen ""romantic comedy.""The original ending was natural. You get zinged with a sorrowful regret feeling that many of us have felt at one time or another. How do I get back what once was, and no longer is?

1012849,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B000HCPS8U,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]","I didn't see this film in the theater, so when I sat down to view The Break-Up I was surprised by the fact that it's less of a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Sure there are some funny moments, but at its heart the film is about the relationship of Gary Grobowski and Brooke Meyers (played wonderfully by Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston) and how it explodes into a great mess. Vince Vaughn is great as the selfish Gary who doesn't understand why people just can't fall in line and do what he wants them to do.  As his girlfriend, Brooke, Aniston shows some real acting chops and plays a character much more adult and well-rounded than Rachel from Friends.  While the film focuses mostly on the characters of Gary and Brooke, the supporting cast is also top-notch.  Two that really shine in the film are Jon Favreau as Gary's best friend and Vincent D'Onofrio as Gary's older brother, Dennis, who gets no respect from self-centered Gary.  There is one scene in particular between them that was just heart-wrenching.  As I said, this film was not what I expected it to be.  After something like The Wedding Crashers, I guess I was expecting a bit more slapstick and childish humor from a Vaughn film, but that is definitely not what The Break-Up is; in fact, it's a very adult film about two people who can't seem to communicate with each other until it's too late.  I especially like that the writers didn't sell out in the end and go for the hokey finale.

I've been involved with counseling many couples who break up and this movie hits the proverbial nail right on the head.  Many break ups are ""accidental"".  Many times persons who break up wish they could be back together.  Many times the greatest danger comes when the problems are out in the open and persons attempt to save the relationship.All of the cast does a good job.  The characters are believable and make the viewer root for them, even the supporting cast.  The viewer becomes emotionally glued to this film with a desire for these two to make it, but they always seem to just miss, even though both want it to work.  This could be a healing film, but it is not a ""feel good"" film.  This may be why so many viewers, expecting a light hearted comedy, gave it less than stellar reviews.Most people who have experienced the breakup of a close relationship will see themselves in this film.  About half of all marriages end in divorce and most couples who live together will eventually split.  The brightest spot in the film is the ending.  It reminds us that however relationships turn out, there is hope for a future on the other side.I won't say how this film turns out, but if you do not like the ending there is an alternate ending in the bonus features.

1012851,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000HCPS8U,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","As many have noted already, `The Break-Up' is not your typical romantic comedy.  In fact, there is rarely a romantic vibe to be found within its 105 minute timeframe.  There's yelling and fighting and humiliation and aggravation and a whole lot of tension, but underneath all of that there beats a heart that is real and raw and overall very, very inviting.  It's inviting because it feels true.  What I really respect about `The Break-Up' is that it doesn't sugarcoat anything; even the ending is far from your typical Hollywood `happy' ending.  As much as this movie is classified a `romantic comedy', and as much as it is about two people presumably in love and as much as it is, at times, very funny, `The Break-Up' is more in the vein of `The Family Stone'; a dramedy with very serious overtones.The couple in question is Gary and Brooke.  Gary is pretty much an overgrown child who works with his two brothers running a Chicago touring company.  Brooke is an aspiring artist who obviously is more well-mannered than Gary and only wishes that he would act his age every once in a while.  After a blowout the two of them decide to separate but are inadvertently forced to remain together since neither is willing to give up their condo.  Brooke, who still loves Gary, tries her hardest to make him realize he has nothing without her.  She turns his friends against him and flaunts her dates in his face and pretty much humiliates him whenever possible.  Gary retaliates by treating her friends like garbage and corrupting her dates and standing her up.  They react like children, yet when you watch them you see this glimpse into their soul.Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are great here.  Vaughn is really coming into his own these past couple of years, breaking back into the main stream and becoming a `go-to-guy' in Hollywood.  He's likable and funny and charming and very believable.  Even though Gary is an overgrown child we still feel affection for him; at times even more so than for Brooke.  Aniston does a great job as well with Brooke.  She plays her very authentically.  She reacts like most women in her position probably would.  She loves Gary and wants to be with him; she just wants him to realize he needs to change in order to make things work.  She doesn't always go about it the best way but her intentions are pure.The supporting cast also help to elevate this movie.  Joey Lauren Adams (I love this girl) is sweet and kind and possesses this genuine beauty that draws me to her.  Jon Favreau is the most likable of Gary's friends and serves to help Gary see the folly of his way so-to-speak.  Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio do a fine job as Gary's very different brothers and Justin Long is hilarious as Brooke's co-worker.  Judy Davis is memorable as Marilyn Dean, Brooke's boss and John Michael Higgins is the supreme scene stealer as Brooke's show-tune-singing brother.In the end `The Break-Up' is written with an honesty I didn't expect to come from a `quote-unquote' romantic comedy.  The actors all get inside their characters in order to flesh them out for us and deliver their lines with real intensity and believable passion.  I highly recommend this film.",4,Not the movie I was expecting; it's substantially better...,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,3197,"['many', 'have', 'noted', 'already', 'Break-Up', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fact', 'rarely', 'romantic', 'vibe', 'be', 'found', '105', 'minute', 'timeframe', 'yelling', 'fighting', 'humiliation', 'aggravation', 'whole', 'lot', 'tension', 'heart', 'real', 'raw', 'overall', 'very', 'very', 'inviting', 'inviting', 'true', 'What', 'really', 'respect', 'Break-Up', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'anything', 'even', 'ending', 'far', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending', 'As', 'much', 'movie', 'classified', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'as', 'much', 'two', 'people', 'presumably', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'times', 'very', 'funny', 'Break-Up', 'more', 'vein', 'Family', 'Stone', 'dramedy', 'very', 'serious', 'overtones.The', 'couple', 'question', 'Gary', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'pretty', 'much', 'overgrown', 'child', 'who', 'two', 'brothers', 'running', 'Chicago', 'touring', 'company', 'Brooke', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'who', 'obviously', 'more', 'well-mannered', 'Gary', 'only', 'would', 'act', 'age', 'once', 'while', 'blowout', 'two', 'decide', 'separate', 'are', 'inadvertently', 'forced', 'remain', 'together', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'condo', 'Brooke', 'who', 'still', 'Gary', 'hardest', 'make', 'realize', 'nothing', 'friends', 'flaunts', 'dates', 'face', 'pretty', 'much', 'whenever', 'possible', 'Gary', 'retaliates', 'treating', 'friends', 'garbage', 'corrupting', 'dates', 'standing', 'up', 'react', 'children', 'yet', 'when', 'watch', 'see', 'glimpse', 'soul.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'great', 'here', 'Vaughn', 'really', 'coming', 'own', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'breaking', 'back', 'main', 'stream', 'becoming', 'go-to-guy', 'Hollywood', 'likable', 'funny', 'charming', 'very', 'believable', 'Even', 'Gary', 'overgrown', 'child', 'still', 'feel', 'affection', 'times', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Brooke', 'Aniston', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Brooke', 'very', 'authentically', 'most', 'women', 'position', 'probably', 'would', 'Gary', 'be', 'just', 'realize', 'change', 'order', 'make', 'things', 'work', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'best', 'way', 'intentions', 'are', 'pure.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'help', 'elevate', 'movie', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'love', 'girl', 'sweet', 'kind', 'genuine', 'beauty', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'most', 'likable', 'Gary', 'friends', 'serves', 'help', 'Gary', 'see', 'folly', 'way', 'so-to-speak', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Gary', 'very', 'different', 'brothers', 'Justin', 'Long', 'hilarious', 'Brooke', 'co-worker', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'memorable', 'Marilyn', 'Dean', 'Brooke', 'boss', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'supreme', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Brooke', 'show-tune-singing', 'brother.In', 'end', 'Break-Up', 'written', 'honesty', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'come', 'quote-unquote', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actors', 'get', 'characters', 'order', 'flesh', 'out', 'deliver', 'lines', 'real', 'intensity', 'believable', 'passion', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

The film is about the decline of their relationship (hence the title).I should point out that I rarely if ever see films like this (or rather films like I thought this would be). I'm extremely selective when it comes to comedy because I think most of what Hollywood churns out is just garbage. I despise with a passion chick flicks and how they all seem to use the tactic of building women up by tearing men down. Mixing the two is Hollywood's most popular formula; the romantic comedy or date movie. Blech!I saw this film because something in the previews told me this wasn't your typical romantic comedy. I've always been a huge fan of Vince Vaughn since first seeing him in Swingers. He's one of the best comedic actors in the biz. It's my opinion that he would have made it to the big leagues sooner had he played with the Hollywood comedy farm team also known as Saturday Night Live. Jennifer Anniston is a far better comedic actress than anything that has ever come out of that club, mostly because of her strong ability to actually act. Together they have a really strong chemisty that is probably boosted a little by their real life relationship.Well, I was right. This film isn't your typical romantic comedy. In fact, I'd hardly call it romantic at all. As for comedy, many parts were as funny as I expected. For me, laugh-out-loud comedy is a rare experience, but I laughed out loud many times in this film. If the film had stuck to being funny, it would have been a much more enjoyable film.The problem is The Break Up doesn't know what it wants to be. There are parts where the two argue that brings the comedy to a grinding halt in favor of delivering scarily realistic drama. One scene in which Vaughn's character snaps both impressed me (at his dramatic acting chops) and chilled me at the same time (most likely due to how it so eriely mirrors some of my own relationship experiences). Then without missing a beat it jumps right back to ""ha-ha"" carefree comedy. Another scene portrays the real uncomfortable nature of being witness to a couple you are friends with having a fight while you are a guest at their home. Like the friends in the movie, I wanted to make a quick exit. You don't know whether you are supposed to be laughing at these characters or worrying over them. Dramatic comedies can work great, but not like this.The biggest problem with the film was there was no purpose for it. The purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh and feel in a humorous mood. While I did laugh many times at funny scenes, the movie as a whole saps all the fun out of it. It's hard to explain how it does this without spoiling the film. Let's just put it this way: serious relationship issues when portrayed realistically, in a serious tone and not given a storybook ending are notoriously NOT funny.  Nor are they romantic. In fact I would call this movie an anti-romance.Any story is only as strong as it's ending. Apparently, the original ending was so hated by test audiences that they tacked on an extra bit to give it some ambiguity (i.e. imagine ends however you want). This same tactic was used on the movie Unfaithful because it has a thematically similar ending. This in my mind ruined that movie because it was a serious drama about what happens when you irreconciably hurt love ones.

Roger Ebert, however, isn't dating a guy that is exactly like Vince Vaughn's character Gary. This movie really hit home with me personally, solely for that reason: I know exactly what Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) is feeling. While I try to remain unbiased in reviews, I'm beginning to learn that this is an impossibility, that some movies are going to affect you more or less depending on your experiences. All in all, I enjoyed the film, despite wanting to cry every time Gary does or says something insensitive, leaving Brooke just nodding her head and walking away in defeat. It has it's funny moments, though these are few and far between, which makes the movie somewhat dull, with not enough wit or intelligence.Gary and Brooke have been dating for a couple years when they decide to buy a marvelous condo together. He doesn't pick up after himself, saying that he's tired after being at work all day. Brooke has been at work all day, too, but still manages to clean up after Gary, picking up the slack while he plays video games. They have a relationship-ending fight after she spends 3 hours after working all day to cook and clean for a family dinner, something which Gary didn't help with at all, refusing to set the table or even simply get ready for when the company arrives. Brooke feels unappreciated, and she can't take it anymore. But what's this couple to do with the expensive condo they bought? They share the space, attempt to make each other jealous, hoping that the other will change to suit their needs.While the situation could've been hilarious, it was just plain sad. I felt awkward watching the majority of this movie, because Aniston and Vaughn seem so uneasy around one another. Previews and trailers have dubbed this movie a ""romantic comedy,"" but there's hardly any romance and very little comedy. And this movie doesn't follow the typical ""boy meets girl"" formula, which is refreshing, but with the absence of Vaughn's tpyical rip-roaring comedy, the movie is stale. Still, give this one a look see, especially if you're in a relationship that seems to be equally stale.",3,"Sometimes Funny, Bit Sad, Bit Dull, But Good",1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2161,"['Roger', 'Ebert', 'movie', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'however', ""n't"", 'dating', 'guy', 'exactly', 'like', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'Gary', 'movie', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'personally', 'solely', 'reason', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'Brooke', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'feeling', 'try', 'remain', 'unbiased', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'learn', 'impossibility', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'affect', 'more', 'less', 'depending', 'experiences', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'wanting', 'cry', 'time', 'Gary', 'something', 'insensitive', 'leaving', 'Brooke', 'just', 'nodding', 'head', 'walking', 'away', 'defeat', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'not', 'enough', 'wit', 'intelligence.Gary', 'Brooke', 'have', 'been', 'dating', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'decide', 'buy', 'marvelous', 'condo', 'together', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'saying', 'tired', 'being', 'work', 'day', 'Brooke', 'been', 'work', 'day', 'too', 'still', 'clean', 'up', 'Gary', 'picking', 'up', 'slack', 'video', 'games', 'have', 'relationship-ending', 'fight', '3', 'hours', 'working', 'day', 'cook', 'clean', 'family', 'dinner', 'something', 'Gary', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'refusing', 'set', 'table', 'even', 'simply', 'get', 'ready', 'when', 'company', 'Brooke', 'feels', 'unappreciated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'what', 'couple', 'do', 'expensive', 'condo', 'bought', 'share', 'space', 'attempt', 'make', 'other', 'jealous', 'hoping', 'other', 'will', 'change', 'suit', 'situation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hilarious', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'felt', 'awkward', 'watching', 'majority', 'movie', 'Aniston', 'Vaughn', 'seem', 'so', 'uneasy', 'one', 'Previews', 'trailers', 'have', 'dubbed', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'romance', 'very', 'little', 'comedy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'follow', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'formula', 'refreshing', 'absence', 'Vaughn', 'tpyical', 'rip-roaring', 'comedy', 'movie', 'stale', 'Still', 'give', 'one', 'look', 'see', 'especially', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'be', 'equally', 'stale']",N/A

Advertising campaigns portrayed the movie as a romantic comedy, with Vince Vaughns character Gary possibly even being similar to the character he played in Wedding Crashers.  I remember when the movie came out, some reviews and maybe even some of the people involved with the movie said this isn't a romantic comedy but a realistic story about people breaking up.  I think anyone considering buying this movie should know what they are going to get:  This is not a comedy and it is not funny.The movie has a great cast, from Justin Long to John Favreau to Jason Bateman.  The character actors are funny and you could choose to laugh, but the entire movie is so depressing, the main characters so evil to each other, that nothing in the film is really ammusing.  Gary and Brooke meet in the opening scenes, the credits role and now they're living together and have their first, horrible vicious fight.  From then on, each person tries to make the other misirable.  This could have worked if there was just one reason to sense the two still like each other.  But they don't, and the movie never shows us why the ever did.  Gary seems like a jerk the entire movie.  Brooke isn't much better.  It seems the creators of this film knew what they were doing.  They made a film on the horrors and the evils that are part of the end of a relationship.  But that ruins the movie.  People see Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston on the cover and they expect a comedy.  Instead they see a movie about two people that are so hateful to each other that nothing good can possibly come out of their relationship.I can't recommend you get this movie unless you've seen it before and liked it or understand at least that this is not a romantic comedy.  There is no romance and almost nothing funny in the entire film.Many reviewers point out this isn't a comedy but rate it high for other reasons, such as the talented supporting cast.  I agree the cast is talented and some of their scenes are funny.  However, Gary and Brooke's fights cast such an overwhelming since of hatred and bitterness, that nothing else in the movie over comes it.

But it is a somewhat touching romantic drama with a surprisingly strong performance from Vince Vaughn (WEDDING CRASHERS) and a fine job by Jennifer Aniston (RUMOR HAS IT).Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Aniston) meet at a Chicago baseball game and fall head-over-hearts for each other. They buy a condo while their relationship punches ahead at full speed ...until the brakes are applied with deadly force during a dinner with friends and family. Gary forgot to buy enough lemons for the table display and all of the irritants that have bothered both of them come tumbling forth.As their relationship disintegrates, one-upmanship is employed by the two fallen lovebirds; Gary buys a pool table for the dining room and Brooke starts dating other men. Neither can afford to move out of the condo so it is eventually put up for sale.The relationship falls to such a level that it appears completely unsalvageable. When Brooke extends an olive branch, it is unknowingly knocked aside by Gary. And once Gary realizes that it WAS an olive branch, it's too late to grasp.Strong bit parts by the quirky Vincent D'Onofrio (THE CELL), Cole Houser (PITCH BLACK) and Jason Bateman (DODGEBALL) help pull this rather pedestrian dramatic film up a notch. Even Ann Margret (VIVA LAS VEGAS) has a fleeting film moment that is noteworthy during the infamous dinner scene.The downside is that there's no hallelujah moment in the film, which is somewhat of a letdown. While comparisons to THE WAR OF THE ROSES (1989) are evident in the The Break-Up's premise, The War of the Roses was most definitely a physical comedy with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner doing horrible things to each other, trying to do more bodily harm than psychological. In The Break-Up, Aniston's and Vaughn's characters are still distantly in love and the harm comes when each refuses to budge in order to get the relationship back on track.The drama of The Break-Up is almost dripping with subversive anger as the two characters force friends to take sides, bitterly fight over the smallest of tidbits, and generally run slipshod over their once prosperous lives.

Clearly this was something she felt she had to do to demonstrate (to herself?)  strength and courage.  Well, she pulled it off.  No one does sweet and genuine better than Jennifer Anniston, and she was brilliant in this role.  So now I have to also refer to her as,""tough as nails.""  She continues to demonstrate that she is head and shoulders above the other ""Friends.""And for Vince,...lets face it, all we want to do is listen to his microphone schtick on the tour bus for two hours.  That would have been fabulous (there is some nice tour bus footage in the extras section on the DVD).  But in this move which he produced, we also get a realistic story about how two people get to gether because they are attracted by certain things in the other one, but in the end it just doesn't work.This movie made sense for me because half way in, I thought to myself, these two people aren't right for each other.  (And I'm told, Vince is ugly.) Then voila, they ended up splitting.  Vince's character is the kind of guy you want to party with, but leave at the party when its time to go home.  Jennifer's character is the kind of gal you want to party, live, sleep, shower, cook, and do just about everything you possibly can with.  And she looks amazing.  Check out her butt in the nude hallway scene.I gave a four star rating because the movie didn't seem to flow evenly at times. Certain characters were introduced as worthy of knowing (most of their respective families, for example), but not developed.  The bartender/friend seemed to be a total idiot most of the time, except in one scene, where he perfectly describes Vince's character and accurately lays out half the premise of the movie.You'll enjoy these two talented people, and the relationship realism, but don't expect a nice ""bow tie"" ending.",4,Realism from Vince Vaughn,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1933,"['have', 'give', 'Vince', 'Jennifer', 'huge', 'credit', 'one', 'First', 'Jennifer', 'doing', 'role', 'so', 'quickly', 'own', 'breakup', 'Clearly', 'was', 'something', 'felt', 'had', 'do', 'demonstrate', 'herself', 'strength', 'courage', 'Well', 'pulled', 'off', 'one', 'sweet', 'genuine', 'better', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'was', 'brilliant', 'role', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'also', 'refer', 'tough', 'nails', 'demonstrate', 'head', 'shoulders', 'other', 'Friends', 'Vince', 'face', 'want', 'do', 'listen', 'microphone', 'schtick', 'tour', 'bus', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fabulous', 'nice', 'tour', 'bus', 'footage', 'extras', 'section', 'DVD', 'move', 'produced', 'also', 'get', 'realistic', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'get', 'gether', 'are', 'attracted', 'certain', 'things', 'other', 'one', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.This', 'movie', 'made', 'sense', 'way', 'thought', 'myself', 'two', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'right', 'other', ""'m"", 'told', 'Vince', 'ugly', 'Then', 'voila', 'ended', 'up', 'splitting', 'Vince', 'character', 'kind', 'guy', 'want', 'party', 'leave', 'party', 'when', 'time', 'go', 'home', 'Jennifer', 'character', 'kind', 'gal', 'want', 'party', 'live', 'sleep', 'shower', 'cook', 'do', 'just', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'amazing', 'Check', 'out', 'butt', 'nude', 'hallway', 'scene.I', 'gave', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'evenly', 'times', 'Certain', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'worthy', 'knowing', 'most', 'respective', 'families', 'example', 'not', 'developed', 'bartender/friend', 'seemed', 'be', 'total', 'idiot', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'perfectly', 'Vince', 'character', 'accurately', 'out', 'premise', 'movie.You', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'two', 'talented', 'people', 'relationship', 'realism', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'nice', 'bow', 'tie', 'ending']",N/A

As movies go, it was fairly entertaining. Vince Vaughn was his usually comedic self as the schlumpy ""every-guy,"" and he and Jennifer Aniston had a good rapport on-screen. I stop short of calling it ""chemistry,"" because, while they played off each other very well on screen in terms of comedic timing, etc., there was none of that ""sizzle"" that one would normally expect in a movie about ex-lovers who're supposed to still love/want each other. That said, Aniston, Vaughn and the supporting cast provided some decent laughs throughout the movie. The ending of the movie could have been more satisfying, but endings to ""break up/make up"" movies are always difficult. If the leads get back together and live happily ever after, the movie is panned for being sappy. If they don't, then the romantics criticize it. So while I personally was less-than-pleased with the ending of ""The Break Up,"" I understand that writing an ending for the movie was a difficult job that could just never please everybody.

Their relationship shouldn't have survived as long as it did, but it lasted long enough for them to buy a condo together.

They have to stay in the same condo until it sells, and wouldn't you know it, comedy and drama ensue.  Vaughn and Aniston turn in great performances; the supporting cast steals the show.

This movie features plenty of yelling, deceitfulness, game playing, and other things that are common when a relationship has reached its final hours.I can remember when this film was first released and it seemed intriguing. Based on the advertisements for the film, it looked like it would be an entertaining romantic comedy. It fact, it is neither romantic nor funny. There are dashes of humor at the beginning of the film but little else. The movie is mostly serious all the way with Vaughn and Aniston arguing almost non- stop until the very end of the film when they become civil once more.Vaughn and Aniston were known to be personally involved with each other during the time this movie was being filmed and this fact gave me the impression that the movie would offer great chemistry and passion. But Vaughn and Aniston do not seem right in this movie. They don't seem like a likely couple and many film critics have correctly pointed out that the two were not very good together in this film.What really bothered me most with this movie is how irritated I felt as I watched! Vaughn and Aniston continuously trade barbs with each other and Vaughn acts impatient and irritating even when he is with friends. Watching the film actually elevated my blood pressure and raised my stress level. I watched it with the hope of viewing a lightened up comedy that would serve as a good after- work stress reliever. Instead, I felt the urge to blow off steam when the movie was finally over. This drama might be the type that some bickering couples can relate to but not only could I not relate, my tolerance for this film continued to decline with each minute. I just wanted it to end to put me out of my misery.There are a few redeeming qualities with this movie, like the individual performances by the various cast members. But the main problem with the acting is that the performers and performances don't seem to gel. The characters are fine on their own, but they don't have the on- screen chemistry so desperately needed to make this film work.

Tensions finally erupt one evening when Gary chooses to laze around rather than help Brooke in the kitchen. But after ""the break up"" they are still living in the same condo because neither of them wants to leave. Brooke goes on several bad dates while Gary tries to return to his wild bachelor days. Eventually, they realize that it is best to leave the condo and go their separate ways.The strength of this movie is in it's ability to accurately portray the ""little things"" that often lead to big problems in a romantic relationship. For instance, Brooke wants to feel appreciated and cared for without having to explain her emotional needs. While Gary thinks she is expecting him to be a ""mind reader"". There are many scenes like this which most couples will relate to.However, I do wish that the characters had been shown to have a more equal number of flaws and good qualities. Instead Brooke usually seems to be a mature, sensible woman while Gary generally comes across as lazy, self-centered and childish. If Gary really is a ""typical guy"" then I do feel sorry for the women out there. But hopefully most of us are more mature and thoughtful than this dopey, aging frat boy.I enjoyed the ""alternative ending"" included on the DVD and think it was better than the one actually used in the film.

1012877,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B000HCPS8U,Classic Movie watcher,"[0, 0]","What's there to like? First and foremost, its innovative treatment of a romantic relationship. I like the opening with many photos of Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston)when they were happy together. Their big quarrel which precipitated the break-up was quite heavy and distressing - the arguments embodied the essence of differences between a man and a woman. The last half an hour where Brooke gave up all hopes after pulling all her tricks for a reunion prove to be a better turn. Once their relationship offered nothing for them to linger on, Jennifer Aniston gave a very credible performance when she had one last cry over the shattered wreck. I also like the ending where both were radiant, successful and hopeful of each own's future. A predictable ending would completely destroy the movie.What's there to beg disbelief? In the middle of separation but trapped under the same roof, no way could dare to provoke Gary to such great extent as Brooke did, fearless as she could be. It was also quite improbable that Brooke as attractive, trendy and classy as Jennifer Aniston could find no other substitute but wait for Gary. Similarly, Gary like Vince Vaughn could easily date someone else, let alone admit to some extent his share of responsibility in the break-up.What could have been a surprise? Find someone not so attractive as Brooke and Gary, then the break-up could be more realistic and thought provoking. Also on the DVD, it seems one could choose the ""his"" or ""hers"" to play the movie, though I detected no distinguishable difference in the two versions. It would be nice to have different versions, one from his point of view and one from hers, on what really went wrong on the relationship. (Exactly what Divorce His, Divorce Hers - Richard Burrton and Elizabeth Taylor - did. )After all, it took two to start and finish a quarrel.So don't expect this to be any comedy.",3,"This is not a comedy, far from it",1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1901,"['What', 'there', 'like', 'First', 'foremost', 'innovative', 'treatment', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'opening', 'many', 'photos', 'Gary', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Brooke', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'when', 'were', 'happy', 'together', 'big', 'quarrel', 'precipitated', 'break-up', 'was', 'quite', 'heavy', 'distressing', 'arguments', 'embodied', 'essence', 'differences', 'man', 'woman', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'where', 'Brooke', 'gave', 'up', 'hopes', 'pulling', 'tricks', 'reunion', 'prove', 'be', 'better', 'turn', 'Once', 'relationship', 'offered', 'nothing', 'linger', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'gave', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'when', 'had', 'one', 'last', 'cry', 'shattered', 'wreck', 'also', 'ending', 'where', 'were', 'radiant', 'successful', 'hopeful', 'future', 'predictable', 'ending', 'would', 'completely', 'destroy', 'movie.What', 'beg', 'disbelief', 'middle', 'separation', 'trapped', 'same', 'roof', 'way', 'could', 'dare', 'provoke', 'Gary', 'such', 'great', 'extent', 'Brooke', 'did', 'fearless', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'improbable', 'Brooke', 'attractive', 'trendy', 'classy', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'could', 'find', 'other', 'substitute', 'wait', 'Gary', 'Similarly', 'Gary', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'could', 'easily', 'date', 'someone', 'else', 'let', 'alone', 'admit', 'extent', 'share', 'responsibility', 'break-up.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'surprise', 'Find', 'someone', 'not', 'so', 'attractive', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'then', 'break-up', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Also', 'DVD', 'one', 'could', 'choose', 'hers', 'play', 'movie', 'detected', 'distinguishable', 'difference', 'two', 'versions', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'different', 'versions', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'hers', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'Exactly', 'what', 'Divorce', 'Divorce', 'Hers', 'Richard', 'Burrton', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'did', 'took', 'two', 'start', 'finish', 'quarrel.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'comedy']",N/A

Normally he doesn't get the chick flicks but this time I didn't get it either.  If you've ever been in a room where your friends who are a couple are fighting and you get that awkward sinking feeling that you want to leave or say something but you can't and you try your best to just ignore it or wish it away?  That is the entirety of this movie.There is nothing romantic or funny about the way these two act toward one another.  Vince Vaughn is a complete jerk who does everything to prove he is a complete sleaze that isn't troubled by emotions of any kind.  Jennifer Aniston plays the desperate girl who instead of saying what is on her mind tries all types of mind games to ""trick"" him into feeling and thinking the way she wants him to.  You do not see ANY endearing moments between these two although I was waiting for some reason to illuminate why they were together in the first place and found none.This could have been a very quirky and funny movie.  Take a look at ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" which turns dreadful marital fights into something hysterical.  However, her shrieks of him being a ""prick"" while he coaches guys about how easy it is to get into her pants through apple martinis was just completely horrifying and dreadful.

1012879,A36SZI12JHB5ZY,B000HCPS8U,"CRV ""CRV""","[1, 4]","Before watching the Break up, I thought this movie would be about a bickering recently broken up couple neither of whom want to concede their prized condo but, was I ever wrong. The Condo had minimal importance compared to the life drama of a break up.Vince vaughn was portrayed as his usuall sharped tongue wedding crasher character. He's a blue collar sales man who run's a bus touring company with his 2 polish american brothers. Aniston is  more of the elitist posh type from an educated rich background. She runs around socialite circles in her art gallery job.  This relationship was doomed to fail from the start by their differing backgrounds. Anniston was clearly at fault for instigated the argument that caused the break up. Her prissy demand for attention was uncalled for. Why couldn't she have compromised with Vince Vaughan to have the dishes done later or completely forget about the lemon issue. That type of Bitchyness would drive any man to a break up. If the roles were reversed, how would Jennifer and all you fem's that defend her feel if your hubby demands immediate attention after a hard day at work when you need some alone time that involves reading a romantic novel, doing facial massages, etc. Why did she have to have things done right away when the she new vince just got off a long day at work and neeeded a little bit of time to unwind.Anyway Vince was fed up with Jennifer's bickering and was  leaning on ending their relationship seeing that jennifer's character was way to uncompromising. on the other hand Jennifer wanted to continue with the relationship and her motive was to employ the female game of pushing a man away in order for him to chase her and apologize. It backfired in this case.  I Wonder if this movie was taken from Jenniferand Brad's real life drama.Personally I dont blame Vaughan for being uncaring. Any guy with an ounce of pride wouldn't tolerate the ""Bitchy"" attitude jennifer's character was giving off. He tried to show class at the end but, it was clearly done out of guilt rather then intimate love for Anniston.. Although the movie was marketed as a comedy, it was more of an emotional break up drama. A viewer may not get the type of movie they were  expecting but, they will see movie  they can relate too in a very real way.",4,"More drama then comedy  but, very deep",1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2293,"['watching', 'Break', 'up', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'bickering', 'recently', 'broken', 'up', 'couple', 'neither', 'whom', 'want', 'concede', 'prized', 'condo', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'Condo', 'had', 'minimal', 'importance', 'compared', 'life', 'drama', 'break', 'up.Vince', 'vaughn', 'was', 'portrayed', 'usuall', 'sharped', 'tongue', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'character', 'blue', 'collar', 'sales', 'man', 'who', 'run', 'bus', 'touring', 'company', '2', 'polish', 'american', 'brothers', 'Aniston', 'more', 'elitist', 'posh', 'type', 'educated', 'rich', 'background', 'socialite', 'circles', 'art', 'gallery', 'job', 'relationship', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'start', 'differing', 'backgrounds', 'Anniston', 'was', 'clearly', 'fault', 'instigated', 'argument', 'caused', 'break', 'up', 'prissy', 'demand', 'attention', 'was', 'uncalled', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'compromised', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'have', 'dishes', 'done', 'later', 'completely', 'forget', 'lemon', 'issue', 'type', 'Bitchyness', 'would', 'drive', 'man', 'break', 'up', 'roles', 'were', 'reversed', 'how', 'would', 'Jennifer', 'fem', 'defend', 'feel', 'hubby', 'demands', 'immediate', 'attention', 'hard', 'day', 'work', 'when', 'need', 'alone', 'time', 'reading', 'romantic', 'novel', 'doing', 'facial', 'massages', 'etc', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'have', 'things', 'done', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'new', 'vince', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'neeeded', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'unwind.Anyway', 'Vince', 'was', 'fed', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'bickering', 'was', 'leaning', 'ending', 'relationship', 'seeing', 'jennifer', 'character', 'was', 'way', 'uncompromising', 'other', 'hand', 'Jennifer', 'wanted', 'continue', 'relationship', 'motive', 'was', 'employ', 'female', 'game', 'pushing', 'man', 'away', 'order', 'chase', 'apologize', 'backfired', 'case', 'Wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'Jenniferand', 'Brad', 'real', 'life', 'drama.Personally', 'dont', 'blame', 'Vaughan', 'being', 'uncaring', 'guy', 'ounce', 'pride', 'would', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'Bitchy', 'attitude', 'jennifer', 'character', 'was', 'giving', 'off', 'tried', 'show', 'class', 'end', 'was', 'clearly', 'done', 'guilt', 'rather', 'then', 'intimate', 'love', 'Anniston..', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'comedy', 'was', 'more', 'emotional', 'break', 'up', 'drama', 'viewer', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'type', 'movie', 'were', 'expecting', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'very', 'real', 'way']",N/A
1012880,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000HCPS8U,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 3]","To me the breakup falls in line with last years `The Family Stone'.  It's marketed as a comedy, but at times it can become extremely uncomfortable in all its seriousness.  I use the word 'uncomfortable', but what I mean is that, if your walking into this movie wanted to do nothing but laugh, then when you see characters crying and it's no where near funny then you feel awkward, like ""what am I supposed to do"".  That's not a criticism, not at all.`The Break Up' is not, at least in every sense of the word, a comedy.  It is, however, a very good movie at that.  Upon hearing that Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston have the lead roles in this film one may assume that this is going to be another romantic comedy regardless of that fact that the trailer has a lot of yelling and the title itself references the end of their relationship.  What I was so glad to see was that this film took such a different approach than even I expected.  I can honestly say that this film is not predictable and that in itself should account for something.Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) have been together for quite sometime and they've slowly grown out of love, or at least out of sync with one another.  The beginning of the film definitely paints Gary as the villain, which is not what I expected at all.  I was under the impression that this was going to be a case of equally guilty parties, and even though Brooke did have her faults I was still regretful for choosing his side on the menu screen.  After a hilarious family dinner which included Brooke's crazy singing brother, Richard (John Michael Higgins) and Gary's two brothers Lupus (Cole Hauser) and Dennis (Vincent D'Onofrio), Brooke finally has had enough and calls off their relationship.  It's immediately apparent that Brooke went further than she wanted to, but Gary doesn't see that and soon the war begins, the war for friends, the war for space and most of all the war for the condo that they co-own.Littered with hilarious situations and fantastic dialog, `The Break Up' does serve up the goods, but as I've said, and as so many have pointed out, this film is more of a drama with some funny scenes.  It's a very serious and at times depressing film, but it meshes well and delivers solid entertainment.  Vince and Jennifer have great chemistry together and come off as a very believable couple.  I'm fascinated with everything Vince has touched lately, he's really taken hold of his career and steered it in the right direction, and this film is just another notch on his belt of success.  The supporting cast does a great job as well, Justin Long playing the token gay guy and doing so brilliantly, and Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams playing Johnny O and Addie, best friends to the conflicted.  I have to give my props to `The Break Up' for serving up a slice of unexpected and triumphant pie.",4,"Not what I expected, and for that I'm thankful!",1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2858,"['breakup', 'line', 'last', 'years', 'Family', 'Stone', 'marketed', 'comedy', 'times', 'can', 'become', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'seriousness', 'use', 'word', ""'uncomfortable"", 'what', 'mean', 'walking', 'movie', 'wanted', 'do', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'then', 'when', 'see', 'characters', 'crying', 'where', 'near', 'funny', 'then', 'feel', 'awkward', 'what', 'am', 'supposed', 'do', 'not', 'criticism', 'not', 'all.', 'Break', 'Up', 'not', 'least', 'sense', 'word', 'comedy', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'hearing', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'lead', 'roles', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'assume', 'going', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'regardless', 'fact', 'trailer', 'lot', 'yelling', 'title', 'end', 'relationship', 'What', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'was', 'film', 'took', 'different', 'approach', 'even', 'expected', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'predictable', 'should', 'account', 'something.Gary', 'Vaughn', 'Brooke', 'Aniston', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'quite', 'sometime', ""'ve"", 'slowly', 'grown', 'love', 'least', 'sync', 'one', 'beginning', 'film', 'definitely', 'Gary', 'villain', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'impression', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'case', 'equally', 'guilty', 'parties', 'even', 'Brooke', 'did', 'have', 'faults', 'was', 'still', 'regretful', 'choosing', 'side', 'menu', 'screen', 'hilarious', 'family', 'dinner', 'included', 'Brooke', 'crazy', 'singing', 'brother', 'Richard', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Gary', 'two', 'brothers', 'Lupus', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Dennis', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Brooke', 'finally', 'had', 'enough', 'off', 'relationship', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'Brooke', 'went', 'further', 'wanted', 'Gary', ""n't"", 'see', 'soon', 'war', 'war', 'friends', 'war', 'space', 'most', 'war', 'condo', 'co-own.Littered', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'fantastic', 'dialog', 'Break', 'Up', 'serve', 'up', 'goods', ""'ve"", 'said', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'more', 'drama', 'funny', 'scenes', 'very', 'serious', 'times', 'depressing', 'film', 'well', 'delivers', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'Vince', 'Jennifer', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'believable', 'couple', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'everything', 'Vince', 'touched', 'lately', 'really', 'taken', 'hold', 'career', 'steered', 'right', 'direction', 'film', 'just', 'notch', 'belt', 'success', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Justin', 'Long', 'playing', 'token', 'gay', 'guy', 'doing', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'playing', 'Johnny', 'O', 'Addie', 'best', 'friends', 'conflicted', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'Break', 'Up', 'serving', 'up', 'slice', 'unexpected', 'triumphant', 'pie']",N/A

Why, because I would have been paying to depress myself.This was not the movie that I was expecting. I was looking for a comedy and didn't really get one. I'll admit that there are a couple of funny parts, and I mean that literally, there were two. What this movie gave me was a big dramatic movie. I like Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn and I even like a lot of the supporting characters, but the script should have been A LOT better. Here are my two biggest problems with the movie. 1) The supporting cast though likable just came and went like nothing. I don't like being introduced to a character and then with them being dropped from the rest of the movie. Yes, they are supporting characters but they deserved so much more. 2)The movie is just depressing. As I said, I was expecting a comedy, but this movie was emotionally draining. There is just constant yelling and constant crying throughout the entire movie. Yes, it is about breaking up and that really happens, but does an audience what to see an excess of that in a comedy? If wanted to witness that much bickering I would have just visited friends in a bad relationship.

1012889,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000HCPS8U,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 5]","I wish someone had warned me -- as I'm about to warn you -- just how lame this movie is.  A low-key, though stylish, story about a mismatched couple whose relationship implodes, this movie finds a tenuous comedic premise in the idea that neither of the ex-lovers is willing to move out of their jointly-owned condominium, and thus are present to torture each other day after day.  She brings home cute guys to make him jealous, he retaliates by throwing sleazy strip-poker parties, and so on.There are a lot of factors that make this such a lame movie.  In terms of the overall structure, the decision to go straight at the beginning of the movie into the Big Fight that ends their relationship sinks this story right from the start.  We never see them as a happy couple, and never understand why they were attracted to each other, why they were pulled apart, etc.  In short, there's no character development, and no buy-in from the audience -- we just don't care about either of them.  That's a big drawback.  Also, there's no real chemistry between Anniston and Vaughan, and meanwhile the script and pacing are both rather slack... Nothing really clicks here -- the story, the acting, the direction, all blah.That being said, it wasn't until the very end of the movie that I realized that what the directors were aiming for was a Woody Allen-style character study, a Serious Film.  The first inkling comes when Vaughan delivers his big, serious, take-me-back monologue (which was painful to watch; he was woefully miscast) and the clincher comes in the final scene, where the two ex-lovers meet a year later and have an awkward, um-hi-how-are-you conversation, ala Woody and/or Robert Altman.  In the context of the lifeless film that precedes it, the scene is a dramatic flop (although both actors do reasonably well in the scene itself...) OHHHHHHHH... so THAT'S what they were aiming for!

Soon they fall in love and move into an upscale apartment they buy together. Their impulsive decision to do all this obviously ignores the reality that Brooke is a cultured, artsy type from a cultured, artsy family, while Gary is a working class stiff whose family runs a chartered sightseeing boat. Once they're past the initial romance and get to know each other, they don't really like what they see. Gary can't stand Brooke's family, and Brooke can't tolerate many of Gary's habits and his desire to just kick back and watch television (and not help with the dishes) after a hard day of work. Before long they decide to break up.There's just one problem. Who is going to get to stay in the apartment? Both Gary and Brooke think it's their right. And so, instead of one of them moving out, both stay while becoming increasingly hostile to each other. Brooke invites her dates into the apartment, while Gary moves in a pool table and entertains strippers. The conflict is further exacerbated by the fact that both Gary and Brooke have confidants who advise them to stick up for their rights.And that's pretty much the story (except for the ending, which is itself fairly predictable and not at all memorable). There's nothing deep about the story line in this movie. In fact, on the whole it is superficial, and in a way implausible. One would think that Gary and Brooke almost immediately would have realized how unsuited they were for each other (given their respective backgrounds) before they decided to cohabit, and certainly before they bought an apartment together.

1012893,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000HCPS8U,Dr. E,"[3, 3]","Could you ask for better casting?! I am crazy about Vince Vaughn (truly funny) and Jennifer Antiston (immensely under-rated). Likewise, I adore the supporting-cast: Jason Bateman (such range!), Vincent D'Onofrio (a Hollywood legend!), and Justin Long (the coolest ""geek"" ever!) So it is easy to see why a ""dream cast"" to many was ""wasted"" in this film ...As noted by several reviewers here, this film should be recognized as drama with a dash of comedy. You see, I thought this piece may be akin to DeVito's ""War of the Roses,"" which was genuinely dark and funny ... instead, Reed's work evolves from fairly amusing to downright ugly. The unfortunate aspect is that the film is crafted in such a way that the audience cannot revel in the ""ugliness."" Many directors create ""unlikeable"" characters so that the audience may enjoy their folly ... but Reed's characters are all too real. They are complex ... they reflect our own complexities ... and thus, their vicious attempts to hurt each other only succeed at making us uncomfortable. And while innovative, it is excruciating. What might be most interesting, is that the ""bad decisions"" lie with both sexes. I give Reed credit for clearly portraying both sexes as flawed and yet sympathetic.Now, I also give Reed credit for this twist on a conventional idea. It was brave to show to likable characters trapped in a bad situation ... one which many of us have experienced. I deeply wish Hollywood would make more such breaks from convention!! Nonetheless, I must admit (like other reviewers here), this film was genuinely unpleasant. It actually hurt to watch it. Of course, it must be noted, that since the film achieved such an emotional response, it actually succeeds. Still, it was difficult to watch.An interesting note, Reed shot a different ending from the one you will see when you purchase this film (check the IMDB trivia for this work because I do not want to spoil the film for you).  As a result of poor reception by test-audiences, it was scrapped and this new ending shot. It would be interesting to know what you think of this alternate ending. (Feel free to post your thoughts in the comments!!)This is a solid work. It is true to life. But it is painful. If you are in the midst of splitting from your partner or if you are newly single, it may not be the right time to watch this film. If you are a huge fan of these actors (as I am), then give this film a try ... but enter the film with the understanding that it is generally mislabeled as a comedy.",3,Too Hurtful to Enjoy ...

1012894,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000HCPS8U,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","The most resonant moment of this mishmash of a film is actually its ending. It's not important to know how the story ends except for the fact that it captures well all those quicksilver feelings of contradiction one feels when confronted with a significant other. Unfortunately, the rest of the 2006 movie enervates far more than it enthralls, primarily because director Peyton Reed never seems to find the right pitch for the story of an embattled couple who separate but choose to live together in the Chicago condo they bought. First-time feature screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender make the primary mistake of trying to make the characters likable at the same time they are supposed to go for the jugular when it comes to the conniving game of one-upmanship each plays on the other.The focus is on Gary and Brooke, who meet in typical rom-com fashion at Wrigley Field. Right after a photo montage of the happy couple during the opening credits, we already sense tension between the two as they prepare for a family dinner party. The relationship falls apart quickly when Brooke recognizes man-child Gary will never change to accommodate her needs. This leads to a series of emotional blackmail episodes that bring moments of catharsis for the pair but at different times. The movie has some nice comedy elements and one-liners for about the first twenty minutes but then moves deeper into sad-eyed melodrama as what's left of the relationship spins out of control. The constant shifts in tone are especially awkward toward the end as the characters' mutual disappointments in one another grow tiresome and repetitive.Of the two leads, Jennifer Aniston fares somewhat better as Brooke since she does not bear the comedy burden that Vince Vaughn seems to feel as Gary. Aniston achieves moments of poignancy even though her character's manipulative nature is just as bad as his. Although he has some funny bits of business throughout, Vaughn struggles valiantly with the heavier moments, and the imbalance between the two actors becomes more pronounced as the story moves along. A stellar supporting cast has been assembled and mostly wasted. A pointlessly cast Ann-Margret has a barely-there cameo as Brooke's mother, while a gaunt-looking Judy Davis has the unenviable role of Brooke's ball-breaking, gallery owner boss.Under the radar since ""Chasing Amy"", Joey Lauren Adams plays Brooke's obligatory best friend Addie, and a now-grown Peter Billingsley (the cherubic Ralphie from the 1983 holiday classic, ""A Christmas Story"") is on very low wattage as her husband. Better in the Apple ads, Justin Long does what he can with the predictably fey role of mincing gallery assistant Christopher. As Brooke's a capella-singing, sexually ambiguous brother Richard, John Michael Higgins seems to have walked in from a Christopher Guest movie. Jason Bateman has a few funny moments as the couple's realtor pal Riggleman, and Cole Hauser (a dead ringer for his father Wings) brings out the oily swinger in Gary's younger brother Lupus. The best moments are provided by Jon Favreau as Gary's suspiciously connected bartender friend Johnny O and Vincent D'Onofrio looking stressed as Gary's straitlaced older brother Dennis.The DVD is chock full of extras - a making-of featurette, short films on Richard's singing group, the Tone Rangers, and the touring company owned by Gary and his brothers, and two separate commentary tracks - the first with Vaughan and Aniston (both displaying more charm here than in the movie itself) and the other a more straightforward account by Reed.

They both purchase a beautiful condo in Chicago where they live in total bliss for quite some time. After a full day of work, Brooke comes home and rushes to make dinner and clean the house in preparation for a family dinner. When Gary comes home, he plops down on the couch and starts watching television. Brooke gets upset when he hands her a bag of three lemons, when she had originally asked him for twelve. This event sparks a series of fierce shouting matches that lead to the inevitable break up and battle for ownership of the condo.It's a simple premise that was ineffectively executed. Although Brooke and Gary's fights were engaging and rang true-to-life, their petty retaliations against one another were unoriginal and not funny. From conducting strip poker matches to bringing home dates to parading around naked after a ""Telly Savalas"" bikini wax, the couple's situation quickly headed downhill as this once promising comedy transformed into an embittered drama.This movie was nowhere near as great as I thought it would be.

1012898,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B000HCPS8U,Elisabeth,"[2, 3]","This movie has it's good points and not so good points regarding (1) the main characters, (2) the supporting characters and (3) the overall storyline.1 -- the main charactersVince Vaughn -- this is the funniest I've seen Vaughn (second best was his role in Swingers).  I especially loved the scene where his girlfriend accuses him of being bitter that her brother kicked his a**.  The look on his face as well as his response just cracked me up.Jennifer Aniston -- on the show Friends, I thought Aniston was the funniest female character (and, therefore, couldn't understand why Lisa Kudrow kept winning awards).  But I've noticed that in movies, she doesn't bring the same sparkle she brought to Friends.  Instead, her performances falls flat.  This movie is no exception.  Her acting here is very lethargic.2 -- the supporting charactersJon Favreau -- loved him in Swingers and in this movie as well.  The scene at the end where he's giving Vaughn advice on how to handle Aniston's new love interest is the funniest part in the movie.Cole Hauser -- Hauser normally plays serious roles, but in this movie, proves he can also do comedy.  The scene where he hits on these two women is both creepy and hilarious.Jason Bateman -- I'm a big fan of Bateman.  He's just a natural comedian.  His role in this movie is small, but he still manages to make those scenes funny, too.Justin Long -- I think Long has a very natural, very believable acting style.  In this movie, however, his talents are underused.  Instead, he relies on a weird hairdo and costume to provide all the gags, but they're not even funny.Vincent D'onofrio -- D'onofrio is the only person in this film who seemed really out of place.  His attempts at trying to be funny only made me cringe and feel sorry for him.  He should stick to drama.3 -- the overall storylineThis movie definitely has it's funny moments, however, I have a gripe about the overall storyline.  What bothered me was that the fault of the breakup seemed to rest solely with Vaughn's character.  But I think they were both at fault.Towards the end, when Aniston is blaming him for not giving enough to the relationship, Vaughn makes an important point that he's not a mind reader.  I agree.  Based on his apology at the end, I think had she spoken up, he would've done anything to make her happy.I mean, I could see if she asked him to change and he refused, but she didn't even ask.  Instead she expected him to read her mind and when he failed to do that (because he doesn't have any magical powers), she let her resentment fester to the point where she broke up with him.This seemed really unfair to me and not a good message for women to walk away with.I think a better message would be for Aniston to apologize as well, saying she wished she had spoken up earlier about her unmet needs and because she didn't, it caused her resentment to reach it's boiling point.That would've been refreshing to see.",3,Why is it all his fault?,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2938,"['movie', 'good', 'points', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'points', 'regarding', '1', 'main', 'characters', '2', 'supporting', 'characters', '3', 'overall', 'storyline.1', 'main', 'charactersVince', 'Vaughn', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Vaughn', 'second', 'best', 'was', 'role', 'Swingers', 'especially', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'bitter', 'brother', 'kicked', 'a**', 'look', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'response', 'just', 'cracked', 'up.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'show', 'Friends', 'thought', 'Aniston', 'was', 'funniest', 'female', 'character', 'therefore', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'kept', 'winning', 'awards', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'movies', ""n't"", 'bring', 'same', 'sparkle', 'brought', 'Friends', 'Instead', 'performances', 'flat', 'movie', 'exception', 'acting', 'here', 'very', 'lethargic.2', 'supporting', 'charactersJon', 'Favreau', 'loved', 'Swingers', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'giving', 'Vaughn', 'advice', 'how', 'handle', 'Aniston', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie.Cole', 'Hauser', 'Hauser', 'normally', 'serious', 'roles', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'comedy', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'women', 'creepy', 'hilarious.Jason', 'Bateman', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Bateman', 'just', 'natural', 'comedian', 'role', 'movie', 'small', 'still', 'make', 'scenes', 'funny', 'too.Justin', 'Long', 'think', 'Long', 'very', 'natural', 'very', 'believable', 'acting', 'style', 'movie', 'however', 'talents', 'are', 'underused', 'Instead', 'weird', 'hairdo', 'costume', 'provide', 'gags', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'funny.Vincent', ""D'onofrio"", ""D'onofrio"", 'only', 'person', 'film', 'who', 'seemed', 'really', 'place', 'attempts', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'only', 'made', 'cringe', 'feel', 'sorry', 'should', 'stick', 'drama.3', 'overall', 'storylineThis', 'movie', 'definitely', 'funny', 'moments', 'however', 'have', 'gripe', 'overall', 'storyline', 'What', 'bothered', 'was', 'fault', 'breakup', 'seemed', 'rest', 'solely', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'think', 'were', 'fault.Towards', 'end', 'when', 'Aniston', 'blaming', 'not', 'giving', 'enough', 'relationship', 'Vaughn', 'important', 'point', 'not', 'mind', 'reader', 'agree', 'Based', 'apology', 'end', 'think', 'had', 'spoken', 'up', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'anything', 'make', 'happy.I', 'mean', 'could', 'see', 'asked', 'change', 'refused', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'ask', 'Instead', 'expected', 'read', 'mind', 'when', 'failed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'magical', 'powers', 'let', 'resentment', 'fester', 'point', 'where', 'broke', 'up', 'him.This', 'seemed', 'really', 'unfair', 'not', 'good', 'message', 'women', 'walk', 'away', 'with.I', 'think', 'better', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'Aniston', 'apologize', 'as', 'well', 'saying', 'wished', 'had', 'spoken', 'up', 'earlier', 'unmet', 'needs', 'did', ""n't"", 'caused', 'resentment', 'reach', 'boiling', 'point.That', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'refreshing', 'see']",N/A

It had some funny moments in it I suppose, but mostly it was just uncomfortable; like being stuck in a room while two of your friends are having a heated argument. The movie starts out with building character and trying to get you to like the two leads (Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston). That isn't hard. They are both very likable characters. The problem then occurs with the rest of the movie after they break-up. The rest of the movie consists of the two of them doing things to hurt each other and trying to make each other feel bad. I don't want to see that. That doesn't make me smile; that isn't funny. That's cruel.It could be funny. Comedy is basically tragedy seen from a different perspective, so I think they were on the right track with this movie; they just forgot to give us the other perspective. I realize this could be a very realistic portrayal of a relationship; in fact I have heard these exact same arguments between people before. Kudos to the writers for getting that right. And I don't mind sad stories, angry stories or stories that show the world how it really is. In fact, I usually prefer those stories. This film does that, but it does it by accident. You can't say ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is truly a great comedy because it wasn't meant to be a comedy, and in the same way you can't say that ""The Break-up"" is a great drama because it wasn't meant to be one.The funniest moments come from John Favreau and Vince Vaughn together. They are funny and anytime they are on screen together you can't help but laugh.

Thinking about it could the boom mic operator been star struck by Jennifer Aniston's  beauty and charm that he or she couldn't operate the boom mic? Could it possibly be that in the dailies no one person noticed that ANNOYING boom mic? Just as I was getting into the film here was that boom mic.I was so annoyed by the boom microphone I looked up who was the operator and the credits name two people: Dan Gunchione and Rob Cunningham.Dan or Rob: What were you thinking?

This was not a ""great"" or ""classic"" movie but the message it projects could BENEFIT any relationship. This thought provoking movie can be very uncomfortable to watch at times primarily because it can hit ""close to home"" for many and most couples and had me sometimes recognizing my own shortcomings. Granted, it is not a great comedy/drama or story (can be very dreary and sad after the 30-minute mark for many) and Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn do not have an incredible ""on-screen"" chemistry. But there are so many lessons that can be learned from their troubled relationship that can be applied to everyone if we except that we are all have our ""quirks"" and ""set in our way"" mindsets.When this movie premiered, the combined total average critic reviews were a ""C"" rating. This was 14 of the top critics throughout the country (i.e.: Roger Ebert, ""C"", New York Times, ""D+"", Rolling Stone, ""B-""). That Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are such likable actors compounds the problem. They're not convincing as sadistic meanies, and when the movie makes them act that way, we feel sorrier for them than for their characters.The outstanding cast ""line-up"" definitely helps an average screenplay. The ""Telly Savalas"" piece in it was a classic comedy moment for the two main actors. The ""Tone Rangers"" were a fun addition to the story line (including their song during the end credits). The movies ending may surprise you (either positively or negatively).Sometimes we all need a friend like Vaughn had in Jon Favreau (as ""Johnny O"" who usually gave poor advice) to tell us that we may be a wonderful person but we need to realize that couples/friendships (lovers or buddies) cannot be a one-sided relationship for both to enjoy life together.",4,"""why can't you do this one little thing for me?""",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1830,"['3.5', 'Stars', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'reading', 'many', 'negative', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'classic', 'movie', 'message', 'projects', 'could', 'BENEFIT', 'relationship', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'times', 'primarily', 'can', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'many', 'most', 'couples', 'had', 'sometimes', 'recognizing', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'Granted', 'not', 'great', 'comedy/drama', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'dreary', 'sad', '30-minute', 'mark', 'many', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'incredible', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'everyone', 'except', 'are', 'have', 'quirks', 'set', 'way', 'mindsets.When', 'movie', 'premiered', 'combined', 'total', 'average', 'critic', 'reviews', 'were', 'C', 'rating', 'was', '14', 'top', 'critics', 'country', 'i.e', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'C', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'D+', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'B-', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'such', 'likable', 'actors', 'problem', ""'re"", 'not', 'convincing', 'sadistic', 'meanies', 'when', 'movie', 'act', 'way', 'feel', 'sorrier', 'characters.The', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'line-up', 'definitely', 'average', 'screenplay', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'piece', 'was', 'classic', 'comedy', 'moment', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Tone', 'Rangers', 'were', 'fun', 'addition', 'story', 'line', 'including', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'movies', 'ending', 'may', 'surprise', 'positively', 'negatively', 'need', 'friend', 'Vaughn', 'had', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Johnny', 'O', 'who', 'usually', 'gave', 'poor', 'advice', 'tell', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'person', 'need', 'realize', 'couples/friendships', 'lovers', 'buddies', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'one-sided', 'relationship', 'enjoy', 'life', 'together']",N/A

The audience was merely given the opportunity to see a relationship disintegrate as though we can not see that enough in real life.  Gosh, thank you so much.

1012906,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HCPS8U,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","THE BREAK UP  is one of those tiresome 'comedies' that Hollywood grinds out on the basis of star power.  In this case the star power begins with a story written by Vince Vaughn (along with Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender), suffused with the same Vince Vaughn that is the 'character' for all his films, and the DVD ends with an extended loquacious justification for the film given by - who else? - Vince Vaughn. It is as tedious and boring as the actor himself, though legions of fans of potty mouth slapstick over-the-top loud-mouthed 'humor' will doubtless disagree.Peyton Reed  was brought in to control the overacting of the Vaughn character and actually is able to allow the other actors in this tired story a chance to shine. The story itself? Vaughn and the superb and beautiful Jennifer Anniston meet clumsily at a Chicago Cubs baseball game where Vaughn introduces the overbearing obnoxious beast that he is in the first few minutes of the 'courtship'.  The courtship and marriage of these two people is contained in snapshots during the credits, sparing us from that extended episode.  When the film actually begins we are already in the midst of a relationship on the skids: Vaughn (a bus tour guide for Chicago with his two brothers Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio) and Anniston (an art gallery person working for the kinky and fabulous Judy Davis) live in an elegant condominium which becomes the landing pad for a breakup of their tenuous marriage.  It is a case of who can out gross who, all the while supported by mutual and individual friends.  Anniston wants to feel appreciated; Vaughn is insensitive and irresponsibly immature.  How it works out is the only good thing about the film: it doesn't!There are some fine little cameos for folks like Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, the above mentioned Judy Davis, Jason Bateman, Justin Long, Ann-Margret etc and they do what they can to add a bit of lustre to this venture, but it is the tedium of watching fighting between two people for 105 minutes that drags the picture down.  The reason for 3 stars?  Jennifer Anniston who continues to prove she can overcome almost any bad script and make it watchable.  Grady Harp.

Well, the contempt just got bigger.  This is a wretchingly poor film, one of the most tired, unbelievable (even by abysmally low Hollywood romantic comedy standards), and boring films I've seen in a while.First of all, the main story of Vaughn and Aniston getting together and being a full fledged couple is garbage.  It's another variation of the overbearing, obnoxious slob (Vaughn, who plays an obnoxious, terminally immature tour guide in Chicago) with a cerebral, intelligent woman who works in an art gallery (Aniston).  These two would NEVER get together in real life, much start a real relationship.  Opposite may attract, but these two are at the furthest opposite ends of the pole.  And at the beginning of the film when Vaughn and Aniston meet, she says she's with someone.  Who was this guy?  Was he so bad that she would dump him for an overbearing, but charming at first sight, jerk like Vaughn?  Well, I've seen some women dump the nicest, most caring guys for completely selfish, immature jerks, and regret it years later, so maybe there's a bit a truth in that.  Regardless...The dialogue in the film is worse than a made for TV movie.  It's badly written, and Vaughn and Anniston can't make the material any better.  Vaughn is rather one note in his career, always playing obnoxious, over confident guys like this, and Anniston, as beautiful as she is, is not a particularly good actress.  She has limited range.  The film seems very long at 90 minutes, and it's ulimately grueling to watch to the end.  There's a few laughs (mostly from Anniston's singing brother, but even those are overdone), but overall, it's one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time.",1,"Yes, it's as bad as its reputation....",1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,1808,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'decided', 'watch', 'one', 'afternoon', 'general', 'contempt', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Well', 'contempt', 'just', 'got', 'bigger', 'wretchingly', 'poor', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'tired', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'abysmally', 'low', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'standards', 'boring', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while.First', 'main', 'story', 'Vaughn', 'Aniston', 'getting', 'together', 'being', 'full', 'fledged', 'couple', 'garbage', 'variation', 'overbearing', 'obnoxious', 'slob', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'obnoxious', 'terminally', 'immature', 'tour', 'guide', 'Chicago', 'cerebral', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'art', 'gallery', 'Aniston', 'two', 'would', 'NEVER', 'get', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'much', 'start', 'real', 'relationship', 'Opposite', 'may', 'attract', 'two', 'are', 'furthest', 'opposite', 'ends', 'pole', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'Vaughn', 'Aniston', 'meet', 'someone', 'Who', 'was', 'guy', 'Was', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'dump', 'overbearing', 'charming', 'first', 'sight', 'jerk', 'Vaughn', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'women', 'dump', 'nicest', 'most', 'caring', 'guys', 'completely', 'selfish', 'immature', 'jerks', 'regret', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'maybe', 'bit', 'truth', 'Regardless', 'dialogue', 'film', 'worse', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'badly', 'written', 'Vaughn', 'Anniston', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'material', 'better', 'Vaughn', 'rather', 'one', 'note', 'career', 'always', 'playing', 'obnoxious', 'confident', 'guys', 'Anniston', 'as', 'beautiful', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'actress', 'limited', 'range', 'film', 'very', 'long', '90', 'minutes', 'ulimately', 'grueling', 'watch', 'end', 'few', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'Anniston', 'singing', 'brother', 'even', 'are', 'overdone', 'overall', 'one', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time']",N/A

The pain of being in this film shows in Jen's face though. It was written by Vince Vaughn and it's easy to see now why their real-life romance recently broke up.How could she forgive him for roping her into this film? I love Jen. I really do. And so the film gets 3 stars just to see her. Her anger at him in the break up increases as the film progresses. I believe she realizes it is a very true to life showing of how couples split and she is getting more annoyed at being in the picture in the first place.

1012909,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B000HCPS8U,Haunted Flower,"[1, 2]","The Break-Up DVD Review1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2006)First off, a summary. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston's characters have been dating for two years and we even get to watch how they first met. After that meeting, a photo slideshow begins and I have to say, that photographer is amazing. He caught all these adorable moments that you never get to have during your relationship because most of the time it's just the two of you. Honestly, who's taking these beautiful pictures?? Anyway, a typical day starts with a special dinner planned and they have a very typical couple fight. It heightens to a degree that provokes Aniston to call it quits. Thus the break-up begins.Now watching this movie as a communication major was fascinating because it directly correlates to my knowledge of gender communication to a tee and I hope the professor is using this movie as a teaching tool. Now Jennifer Aniston is being the typical woman who does everything in the relationship in this case. She works all day, then cooks, cleans, and does all the things he wants to do when they go out. When she asks him to do a few simple things to help her out, just as a way of showing gratitude or appreciation, he turns her down. Unfortunately instead of coming right out and saying these things, she pulls out things like, ""Why didn't you bring me twelve lemons like I asked?"" or ""We never go to the ballet."" These are to hint at: You don't listen to me or seem to care about me the way I do you. She never spells it out. Women like to imply what they're saying instead of just saying it.Vince Vaughn is the typical guy who has a great girl who does everything and he doesn't have to. He loves her but he works all day and believes he's entitled to some down time when he gets home. Which isn't a problem in itself. Then he gets ""nagged"" by Aniston to do a couple things and he sees it as her nagging him ALL the time and doesn't respect his need to veg out the way he likes to. What he's missing is that she worked all day too and is asking for some help. He needs plain english and takes everything she says literally. When she finally breaks up with him, he believes it's real and therefore if the relationship is over, there is nothing he can do, so he will defensively protect his domain and act like he doesn't care about her. The break-up was a ploy used by Aniston only to raise the stakes. She expected him to come after her, she waited by the door! If he cares, he'll try to save the relationship. He'll have a revelation, she believes. He thinks there is nothing to save and so he leaves.What follows is an often funny, sometimes very sad downward spiral into competition and continued miscommunication. They both continue to raise the stakes and the more things Aniston tries to take away from him, the further he gets pushed away. She keeps hoping she'll take away one thing he cherished and he'll suddenly say, ""Wow I miss my girlfriend, look at how my life sucks without her. I see it all now. I'll go apologize.""I have to say one of the best comedic devices I've seen in a long time is the acapella group, ""The Tone Rangers"". I laughed so hard I cried a little when I was in the theatre. Dan took me to see this movie on my birthday! :-) Seriously, how can you have a better line than, ""You can't take a pitch pipe out of a man's hand when he's in the middle of a tasty groove!"" The other funniest part of the movie is Vaughn playing an online video game with a headset connected to a twelve-year old boy and he keeps asking him if his mom is in the room crying at the devastation that is the score. Jason Bateman is very funny as their realtor friend who helps discuss the division of condo assets.This is one of the best movies of that year and I can't believe Wedding Crashers got more hype. This is a great movie, particularly if you're in a relationship. Just don't let those arguments motivate more of your own. The movie SHOWS you how not to fall into that trap. Women need to be more direct and just say what they mean. Men need to listen and notice what women go through for them. End of story. I love this movie.DVD Extras:There is feature commentary with the director and also with both lead actors Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. It is so rare to get a combination of actors on a commentary but so rewarding when you hear the in's and out's of how scenes came about and what was ad-libbed and where ideas came from. The outtakes for the movie are hysterical, but there is also a segment of improv between Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn that is so funny to see how quick they are and you'll wish all the good jokes could have been worked in to the movie. Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn improving out a scene to perfection and it is not only funny, but a good lesson on how movies come together for budding actors.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","Although Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau again team up for some of the comedic scenes, this movie is not a complete disappointment. If you like VV you may enjoy the first hour of this film; after that it descends into predictability, strained comedy, and gay stereotypes from the 80's.Vaughn gets sole credit for adding any substance to this film. And I do mean ANY. Vincent D'Onofrio, a good actor, is wasted in an inscrutable part, a deranged older sibling who runs the tourism business in Chicago with Vaughn. There are some awful scenes- REALLY awful, at the dinner table where Ann-Margret is also present.Judy Davis is a welcome diversion from this mess, but her cameo as an eccentric art gallery owner is not long enough. Aniston plays her usual self; which may be good or bad, depending on what you think of her personality. Joey Lauren Adams is also a one-dimensional character, trying to help her sister find Mr. Right.Apparently, the director did not want this to be construed as a ""chick flick"" so added Vaughn, and a few male characters, without developing the characters, or giving them any substance.There is a brief scene with the ""Old 97's"" in concert, Vaughn has a few dramatic moments, and the plot could have worked, but the screenwriter must have been under a time limit, or creatively challenged.Breaking the mold of an already faulty genre does not an instant classic make. It just means it's an unusual addition to the faulty genre, rather than an exception. And Reed should have paid closer attention to the romantic comedies that Linklater (Before Sunrise), Crowe (Jerry Maguire) and Smith (Chasing Amy) made following their teen flicks. The devil is in the dialogue, and more attention should have been paid attention to it. Oh, and casting the right people for the parts, rather than the flavours of the month. That really helps too.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","A pretty entertaining, thoughtful movie if you ignore the bouncy/fun art on the DVD box and forget the bouncy/fun marketing campaign when this movie hit theaters a couple of years back.  This is not a romantic comedy but rather a drama with some comedy sprinkled in, or- at best- a 50/50 mix of drama and comedy.  If you go in knowing that, you won't be put off (as I was until I got into the right groove) by all the intense, shadowy lighting and the intense, pain-laced arguments.  Once you know what you're getting, you'll enjoy the well-crafted intensity and the handful of funny moments, too (Jon Favreau is a riot as Vince Vaughn's protective friend).The extra features are pretty illuminating, too. That's where we learn that the film's tone was unambiguously intentional on the part of Vince Vaughn and director Peyton Reed, who essentially said, ""we hate those brightly lit, goofy romantic comedies that don't have a thread of true complexity in them!""  Oh, and for an entertaining lesson in the art of film-making, be sure to watch the Vince Vaughn/Jon Favreau improv sessions, also among the special features.  You'll see five or so improvised takes of a conversation in a bar between the two actors, while in character.  It's fun to see what responses they come up with on the spur of the moment as each actor takes turns throwing openings and straight lines at the other.  In the end, pieces of all the takes were edited together to produce the actual scene in the movie.So, again, if you don't mind a little nuance and complexity in your comedic dramas (or your dramatic comedies, or whatever you want to call this mixed-up genre), give ""The Break-Up"" a try.",4,"Not a feel-good, laugh-riot comedy, but... interesting",1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,1672,"['pretty', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'ignore', 'bouncy/fun', 'art', 'DVD', 'box', 'forget', 'bouncy/fun', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'when', 'movie', 'hit', 'theaters', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rather', 'drama', 'comedy', 'sprinkled', 'or-', 'best-', '50/50', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'go', 'knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'was', 'got', 'right', 'groove', 'intense', 'shadowy', 'lighting', 'intense', 'pain-laced', 'arguments', 'Once', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'well-crafted', 'intensity', 'handful', 'funny', 'moments', 'too', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'riot', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'protective', 'friend', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'illuminating', 'too', 'where', 'learn', 'film', 'tone', 'was', 'unambiguously', 'intentional', 'part', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'director', 'Peyton', 'Reed', 'who', 'essentially', 'said', 'hate', 'brightly', 'lit', 'goofy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'thread', 'true', 'complexity', 'Oh', 'entertaining', 'lesson', 'art', 'film-making', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Vince', 'Vaughn/Jon', 'Favreau', 'improv', 'sessions', 'also', 'special', 'features', ""'ll"", 'see', 'five', 'so', 'improvised', 'conversation', 'bar', 'two', 'actors', 'character', 'fun', 'see', 'what', 'come', 'up', 'spur', 'moment', 'actor', 'throwing', 'openings', 'straight', 'lines', 'other', 'end', 'pieces', 'were', 'edited', 'together', 'produce', 'actual', 'scene', 'movie.So', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'nuance', 'complexity', 'comedic', 'dramas', 'dramatic', 'comedies', 'want', 'call', 'mixed-up', 'genre', 'give', 'Break-Up', 'try']",N/A

We feel we should send Christmas Cards to the cast because they are part of our lives. So when a movie comes out that has Jennifer or Courtney or Matthew in it I am naturally drawn to it. I should know better.Few of the movies made by these actors comes close to the chemistry, emotion, and laughs that I experience when I see them all on a couch in a coffee shop and this movie is no different.Jennifer does a fine job in this movie. You empathize with her plight; she loves the big lug, but ... he is a big lug.  She is stunning in that girl next door way that makes you think she has the same problems with rent and work and stuff, she just looks fabulous. In the end, you do not want her to get back together with her guy; you want her to move on to a new man.I do not care for the roles Vince Vaughn takes. He is a competent actor but he selects roles that have him emotionally stunted or acting very adolescent [Mr. & Mrs. Smith]. He plays the same role here very well. I can just do without the naked parties, constant drinking, playing video games stereotype that men have to fight. Some of this is not all his fault. He does grow some during the film, but for me the story did not let him grow up enough for me to root for him to get back with Jennifer.So in the end I could have done without this uninspiring stereotypical relationship flick.

1012925,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000HCPS8U,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","""The Break Up"" shot to #1 at the Box Office for a couple weeks, got pretty good reviews, but wasn't well received with audiences. Many people say they didn't like it because all the main characters do is argue and they didn't like the ending. Basically, the reason people don't like this film is because they were expecting a romantic-comedy in the vein of ""Failure to Launch"" or ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Where the storyline is the same and the ending is the same. The Break Up lead people to believe via previews that this would be a comedy like that, instead...It is completely free of those cliches and is instead, kind of original. Even though some of the story elements (like the ending) reminded me of Annie Hall. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaugn play Brooke and Gary, a couple who co-own a condo and have successful jobs. Problem is, after a couple years together, Brooke finds Gary lazy and Gary finds Brooke pushy. One night, the two decide to break up. The problem is neither one of them wants to give up the condo. So they begin to antagonize one another until someone gives it up. Brooke has Gary kicked off their bowling team, Gary has a strip-poker party, Brooke gets a ""Telly Savalas"" and dates, Gary plays video games...Sometimes, they kind of just act like children. The movie isn't perfect; In fact, the movies I mentioned above that this film shouldn't be compared to might be better movies. If you watch this film with an open mind and no preconceived ideas of what you're going to see, you may find yourself enjoying it. Aniston and Vaughn are great as the feuding couple and Joey Lauren Adams and Jon Favreau add some great comedic bits here as well. The Bonus Features include an alternate ending, which is a perfect example of why alternate endings suck.GRADE: B-",4,Underrated...Pretty Good Romantic-Comedy,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,1794,"['Break', 'Up', 'shot', '1', 'Box', 'Office', 'couple', 'weeks', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'received', 'audiences', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'argue', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'Basically', 'reason', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'were', 'expecting', 'romantic-comedy', 'vein', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'Where', 'storyline', 'same', 'ending', 'same', 'Break', 'Up', 'lead', 'people', 'believe', 'previews', 'would', 'be', 'comedy', 'instead', 'completely', 'free', 'cliches', 'instead', 'kind', 'original', 'Even', 'story', 'elements', 'ending', 'reminded', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Vince', 'Vaugn', 'play', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'couple', 'who', 'co-own', 'condo', 'have', 'successful', 'jobs', 'Problem', 'couple', 'years', 'together', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'lazy', 'Gary', 'Brooke', 'pushy', 'One', 'night', 'two', 'decide', 'break', 'up', 'problem', 'one', 'give', 'up', 'condo', 'begin', 'antagonize', 'one', 'someone', 'up', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'kicked', 'off', 'bowling', 'team', 'Gary', 'strip-poker', 'party', 'Brooke', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'dates', 'Gary', 'video', 'games', 'Sometimes', 'kind', 'just', 'act', 'children', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fact', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'movies', 'watch', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'may', 'find', 'enjoying', 'Aniston', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'great', 'feuding', 'couple', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'add', 'great', 'comedic', 'bits', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'include', 'alternate', 'ending', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'alternate', 'endings', 'suck.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

As is, he is so swollen up with fat his face has no more expression than the Pillsbury Doughboy.  It's like his facial features are being squeezed out.  In the epilogue someone comments to him, ""You've lost weight!""  It must have been filmed months later because he looks completely different, more like himself again.  Maybe it wasn't overeating, but steroids?  Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams also look like overstuffed caricatures of themselves, while on the other extreme, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long and Judy Davis all put together don't weigh as much as Vince Vaughn.  A couple of time I felt sorry for him, like the one scene where he's lying down and the script calls for him to rise to a sitting position.  It's painful to watch and the director had to use a fast forward button to get him up before the reel changed.Right now in Sacramento humane zoo workers and the Coast Guard are joining forces to get two errant whales out of the delta.  Their pictures are all over the front page of the Chronicle, but in looking quickly at the news-stand today I said to my pal, ""Hey look, it's Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau in THE BREAKUP.""My mistake!  Okay, so there must be another version of the movie that explains how Aniston and Vaughn got together in the first place.  It just doesn't make sense that he, a pig from hell, would ever attract a woman who's supposed to be a killer saleswoman of contemporary art, a woman who has her pick of every attractive man in Chicago?

We just saw the ""LAKE HOUSE"" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.  Maybe it should have had Jennifer Aniston tucked into it somewhere, perhaps playing the same part as the Glengarry Glen Ross art saleswoman who can sell even the most unpromising canvas to the next gullible superhunk who waltzes into Marilyn Dean.  I must say Justin Long makes this movie worth seeing.  You totally believe him as the superfey, punked out receptionist with a heart of gold, the old Goldie Hawn part here turned into a hero for the QUEER EYE generation.

Although this kind of brutal distinction is hard to endorse in today's age of tragi- and dark comedies, it does serve as a reminder that you should know what you're getting.  Screenwriters should know what kind of emotional notes they're trying to strike, and audiences should know, going into a film, what sort of empathies they're expected to give up to the screen.""The Break-Up"" may have been attempting a tragic-comic tone, but I doubt it.  And if it was, it failed miserably.  The best dark comedies only work because the darkness itself is meant to be funny, and vice versa.  In ""The Break-Up,"" the two elements - the laughable and the lamentable - aren't mixed, they aren't juxtaposed, and they aren't even set up as flipsides of the other.  They hardly seem to be aware that the other is even there.It's all in the title.  Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) are breaking up.  In fact, they DO break up.  (This is not a spoiler.  If you protest, I suggest you read the title of the film again.)  Most of the movie deals with the reality of a relationship on the skids, but in this case a large part of the tension comes from the fact that neither party is willing to move out of or give up the wonderful condo they found and decorated together.  They circle around each other, growling and gnashing their teeth, all while hiding their most vulnerable spots from plain sight.  Gary buys a pool table that Brooke steadfastly refused to allow in the domicile.  Brooke walks around nude to show Gary what he's missing.  Things escalate.Break ups, generally speaking, aren't the funniest of things, especially if they're played straight-faced, and this is about as straight-faced as it gets.  Some elements are unique (Brooke allows her ambiguously gay brother's accapella group -- the Tone Rangers -- to practice in her room, disrupting Gary's sleep), others are derivative (the Game Night scene where the couple fights over a game of Pictionary comes straight out of an episode of The Simpsons).  Most of them are just plain hateful, and I'm talking about every true-to-life yelling match the two get into over the course of the movie.Taken as a case study, it may have proven to be a telling (if not a particularly ground-breaking) look at relationship dynamics.  But Diirector Peyton Reed, perhaps afraid of being too spot-on, tried to balance out the film's black heart with some sincerely funny side elements.  Gary's brothers - the lecherous Lupus (Cole Hauser) and the perpetually awkward Dennis (played ingeniously by Vincent D'Onofrio) - provide moments of relief.  So does Gary's best friend, Johnny O (another great performance by Jon Favreau).  Jason Bateman has a few wonderful moments as the real estate agent, Riggleman.  Even Brooke's boss (the skin-n-bones Judy Davis) and her coworker (Justin Long) offer us a much-needed respite from the break-up's torturous emotional melodrama.But it's not enough, really.  And more importantly, it's distracting.  That was probably the point.  These two people are really and truly breaking up, and the movie fails to explain why that's supposed to be entertaining or even interesting.  Most of us look away or get up and leave when confronted with a self-destructing relationship.  We don't stick around to watch the flames burn themselves out.  ""The Break-Up"" is a tragedy, but it doesn't want to be, and so it entreats us to stay and watch by offering us a few chuckling crumbs.  Is it tragic?  Absolutely.  Is it funny?  At times.  Is it both things together?

However, I really did not expect this movie to be as good as it is. It's excellent!As you can probably tell from the title, this film isn't exactly a romantic tale. It's actually a very dark comedy about Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston), two very different people who fall in love, move in together, and then decide to split up. Neither of them are willing to vacate their posh Chicago condo, so they're forced to live under the same roof with each other in the wake of their very nasty break-up. Brooke and Gary go to great lengths to torment each other. Gary treats Brooke's friends like outsiders and turns the living room into a pseudo-strip club, while Brooke taunts Gary with her naked body and parades her various dates in front of her ex. Ultimately, both characters are forced to come to terms with their relationship, and the outcome probably isn't what most movie-goers will expect.I was very impressed by the performances delivered by Aniston and Vaughn. There are definitely some funny moments in this movie, but the subject matter is actually quite painful, and Aniston and Vaughn do a great job of portraying their characters' heartbreaks. The supporting cast of ""The Break-Up"" is also outstanding. I especially enjoyed watching Justin Long and Judy Davis play Brooke's crazy co-workers from the art gallery: hilarious!""The Break-Up"" is a great movie because it's so incredibly realistic. I've personally witnessed many couples deal with the same problems Gary and Brooke have. I'm sure some people will complain that this isn't a traditional ""happily ever after"" love story, but not all relationships work out in the end.

Jon Favreau (Made, Swingers) is great as Vaughn's buddy Johnny O. Vaughn & Favreau work great together. I just wish Favreau had a bigger part.

1012956,A2TZNPWHFZFO5Z,B000HCPS8U,Nappaland.com,"[2, 2]","Plot Summary: Trouble ensues when a cohabitating couple decides to end their relationship but each partner refuses to move out of their home.Reason for the Rating: Sexual content, some nudity, and language.When The Break-Up came out on DVD, I was quite excited. I'd heard so much about this comedy that takes a real-life look at relationships and doesn't create some Hollywood story of romantic impossibility. After watching the movie, though, I can't say I was satisfied. I felt like instead of watching a comedy, I'd just watched a horrible tragedy--one I would have been happier to have missed.From the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to the main characters, Brooke and Gary, played by Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, respectively. We see how they met, fell in love, and through a series of photographs we see that they have a fun relationship filled with good times, great friends, and a lot of love. It all seems perfect, until they get into an argument. The argument is a small one, but it quickly turns into a huge fight, bringing to the surface all the dysfunction in the relationship that photographs just don't depict. All too soon, Gary and Brooke decide to break up.Unfortunately for the ex-couple, they live together, and neither one of them is willing to pack up and move out of the home they share. They are both too stubborn to give up the home, and thus the anger and frustration between them grows as they try to live separate lives in the same space. They begin to purposely hurt each other in order to gain the upper hand, and their tactics get more and more cruel and extreme. Although it is evident that both Brooke and Gary would like to end their fight and try to work things out, neither one of them can give up the chance to have the last word, and so the relationship continues its downward spiral throughout the movie.Sure, The Break-Up is sort of realistic, or at least it doesn't create a typical fantasy ending. But the problem, at least for me, is that this movie takes reality a little bit too far. Gary and Brooke aren't just mad at each other; they're furious. They don't simply say unkind things; they say the nastiest things they can think of. They aren't merely cruel to one another; they try to ruin each other's lives. Although a lot of this is exaggerated for comic effect, after awhile it got to be too much for me. I almost couldn't stand to watch people treat each other so horribly, comedy or not.This movie somehow devolves from two people in the midst of a bad break-up to two people living ruthless and unsympathetic lives. They're awful, especially Vaughn's Gary, who goes off on ugly tirades every chance he gets. Vaughn is known for his rapid-fire comedic dialogue in films, and he usually can make almost anyone laugh with his absurd blabbering, but when he's hurling insult after insult, it's not very humorous. I'm sure that some people will still find him entertaining, but watching cruelty masked as humor just doesn't please me.To be fair, there are definitely a few funny moments in The Break-Up. As I mentioned earlier, Vince Vaughn is like a professional motor mouth, and when he's not being cruel, he can be amusing, even though I don't think this happens very often in this film. There is also a particularly funny scene in which the couple's families meet for one big dinner, but credit the supporting cast for providing the best laughs of the movie.Overall, The Break-Up simply isn't funny enough to warrant all the screaming and scheming that take over the plot. With or without a few laughs, this movie is not enjoyable to watch. It's also definitely not appropriate for kids. Even without the sexual content (which it does have!) kids shouldn't have to witness such nastiness in action. It wouldn't be a healthy example at all.To its credit, The Break-Up does try to have a redeeming ending, and a very realistic one at that. This is probably the best part of the movie, but after watching so much misery come before it, the ending is bittersweet at best. I was left with the feeling that these people never should have known each other. I think they could have learned their lessons in life some other way. And I definitely could have gotten the message without having to sit through such a cringe-inducing film.SPECIAL FEATURES:This DVD has all the standard extras but also a few fun bonuses. There is an alternate ending which could make for some good conversation, and there is also an interactive tour of Chicago. Not everyone will be interested in that, but I, being a sucker for any kind of tour, thought it was pretty cool!DVDBLOG RECOMMENDS:If you decide to watch this one, prepare for lots of yelling and cruel actions. If that's not what you're looking for, choose something else.AFTER THE SHOW:* How could both Gary and Brooke have handled their very first argument differently and thus changed the course of their lives?* Why is it so important to listen, communicate and forgive in any relationship? Use examples from the movie to support your answer.* In what ways does each character seem to have changed for the better at the end of the movie? Why do you think this change occurs?AH",3,A [...] Review,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,5179,"['Plot', 'Summary', 'Trouble', 'ensues', 'when', 'cohabitating', 'couple', 'decides', 'end', 'relationship',

Clearly the first part of the movie is a comedy, though not a good one.  And, the latter half of the money is no longer funny, but really lacks any depth or drama.  Vince Vaughn is totally miscast in this film, which considering that he wrote it, probably did not leave other options for the lead role.  It just made no sense to me why the Jennifer Aniston character would fall in love with the totally obnoxious self-obsessed guy played by Vince Vaughn.  The role really needed someone like Owen Wilson who is likable even when he plays a jerk.  Vince just does not cut it here.  The entire movie is so one sided that it could be retitled, ""The Complete Jerk Boyfriend.""Another problem is that there were so many great supporting actors who were vastly underused, but were probably the best part of the movie.  John Michael Higgins is hysterical in his small role as Jennifer Aniston's brother.  Judy Davis is wasted in her role as a quirky gallery owner.  Who blackmailed her into this role?  Vincent D'Onofrio was great, as usual, showing the depth and heart that Vince Vaughn's character could only dream of having.  Jason Bateman's role is undefined at best.  And, did you know that Ann Margaret is in this film?  For maybe one minute actually.  The most troublesome character, however, is played by Jon Favreau.  For most of the movie he is just a neanderthal friend of Vince Vaughn.  Then, he steps completely out of character to give Vince Vaughn maybe the only important heartfelt advice and feeling in the movie.  Don't worry though, Mr. Favreau's character goes back to being a complete idiot moments later.This movie is a complete mess, sort of like the character Vince Vaughn plays in the movie.

It was a wake-up call and i knew it at the time, but I guess it took a long time for me to be honest with myself about my life and my choices.  I can't understand why this production is so often panned.  I think Vince and Jennifer turned out stellar performances.

A good part of the start of the movie existed to establish Vince Vaughn's character as a smooth talking, lazy and selfish.As the picture progresses we see both leads spending all of their efforts trying to one up each other instead of trying to repair a relationship that they both care about.  It is a powerful lesson on how not to do things.  As the movie went deeper and deeper it was clear that both people didn't want to break up but also didn't want to give in.  They were more invested in what other people advised then it what they wanted themselves.As the movie progressed it became smarter and smarter.  About 2/3 of the way into the picture I whispered to my wife that if this movie was brave it would end a particular way.  Don't worry no spoilers.Imagine my surprise and my wife's disappointment when that in fact was the case.  As we left the theatre I made a note to notice the women leaving the picture, it looked like uniform disappointment.I think the ending make a potential sequel possible, but it would be a shame in a sense since one of the things that made the picture as smart as it was is the idea that actions have results.This picture is worth watching, see it.",4,Smart movie with a dose of real life,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,1229,"['movie', 'pulled', 'two', 'directions', 'good', 'part', 'start', 'movie', 'existed', 'establish', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'smooth', 'talking', 'lazy', 'selfish.As', 'picture', 'see', 'leads', 'spending', 'efforts', 'trying', 'one', 'up', 'other', 'instead', 'trying', 'repair', 'relationship', 'care', 'powerful', 'lesson', 'how', 'not', 'do', 'things', 'movie', 'went', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'was', 'clear', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'break', 'up', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'were', 'more', 'invested', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'advised', 'then', 'what', 'wanted', 'themselves.As', 'movie', 'progressed', 'became', 'smarter', 'smarter', '2/3', 'way', 'picture', 'whispered', 'wife', 'movie', 'was', 'would', 'end', 'particular', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'spoilers.Imagine', 'surprise', 'wife', 'disappointment', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'case', 'left', 'theatre', 'made', 'note', 'notice', 'women', 'leaving', 'picture', 'looked', 'uniform', 'disappointment.I', 'think', 'ending', 'make', 'potential', 'sequel', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'sense', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'picture', 'as', 'smart', 'was', 'idea', 'actions', 'have', 'results.This', 'picture', 'worth', 'watching', 'see']",N/A
1012966,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000HCPS8U,Peter Shermeta,"[1, 1]","Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) and Gary (Vince Vaughn) live in the condo that they own together. They have had all of the conversations about what is to come from their future; things look good until one night. Brooke feels that Gary does not participate well enough in the relationship. She feels that she goes above and beyond her duty and not only does he fail to meet her halfway, he does not appreciate what she does for him. She breaks up with him.Now she must do everything in her womanly power to make him realize that he needs to make some changes in his life and want to win himself back into her favor. But is it that simple?My expectations were relatively low. To my knowledge, the movie has not been reviewed well in most circles. Some people expect it to be 100% ""chick flick."" Some people expect it to be 100% Vince Vaughn hilarity. The reality falls somewhere south of the latter and to the left of the former.The movie was absolutely hilarious...until their first fight - the break-up fight. The movie then took on a serious tone for the next 20-30 minutes. It was a sharp contrast from the raucous laughter that spewed from the audience as the movie began. The laughs that came throughout the remainder of the movie were hearty, though sporadic.I had heard that it was not a great date movie. Various scenes harp on not-so-subtle idiosyncrasies exhibited by both men and women in relationships. Apparently there has been some trouble caused among viewers who then have things pointed out that they relate to their own mate. My feelings are that maybe this could be true if you are in a middle stage of a relationship. If you are early you have not seen signs of anything yet that could be highlighted in the movie and if you are late in the game you are over it by now. But I do pass along the warning anyway.Vince Vaughn was great. Vince Vaughn's humor was somewhat of an amalgamation of other roles he has played. He had relationship insight like he did in Wedding Crashers and some right-on-time trash talk like he did in Swingers. I will continue to tout him as the new Bill Murray. He does the slapstick, sophomoric humor; he does serious drama; he does touching chick flick. He is very likeable on screen. So far anyway, he has the Midas Touch.Jennifer Aniston, in many scenes, has never looked better. I do not expect to see her name attached to any blockbuster roles, but she does well in this chick-flick niche. She is well suited to the characters in the genre.Welcome back to movies, Joey Lauren Adams. She put on a few pounds and looks good. Her role was small, but she did a good job as the nagging friend whose advice is misinterpreted by Brooke.Vincent D'Onofrio takes on another quirky role like the one he played in Thumbsucker. The characters were vastly different, but it seems that Mr. D'Onofrio is stretching his artistic legs a little. It was a small part, but he did well.As if Joey Lauren Adams' reincarnation wasn't enough, Cole Hauser came out of the woodwork. Probably the only thing you've seen him in was Dazed and Confused, and after that role you did not expect to see him in anything ever again. Though he did have a small roll in Tigerland, which is a fantastic movie.Jon Favreau was great. I love to see Favreau and Vaughn interact on screen. I still picture Mikey and Trent (Swingers) when the witty banter begins.The movie was good, not great. I may never see it again, but it was entertaining enough.",3,"Sure, it was entertaining, but...",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,3450,"['Brooke', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Gary', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'live', 'condo', 'own', 'together', 'have', 'had', 'conversations', 'what', 'come', 'future', 'things', 'look', 'good', 'one', 'night', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'not', 'participate', 'well', 'enough', 'relationship', 'above', 'duty', 'not', 'only', 'fail', 'meet', 'halfway', 'not', 'appreciate', 'what', 'up', 'him.Now', 'must', 'do', 'everything', 'womanly', 'power', 'make', 'realize', 'make', 'changes', 'life', 'want', 'win', 'back', 'favor', 'simple', 'expectations', 'were', 'relatively', 'low', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'reviewed', 'well', 'most', 'circles', 'people', 'expect', 'be', '100', '%', 'chick', 'flick', 'people', 'expect', 'be', '100', '%', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'hilarity', 'reality', 'somewhere', 'south', 'latter', 'left', 'former.The', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'first', 'fight', 'break-up', 'fight', 'movie', 'then', 'took', 'serious', 'tone', 'next', '20-30', 'minutes', 'was', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'raucous', 'laughter', 'spewed', 'audience', 'movie', 'began', 'laughs', 'came', 'remainder', 'movie', 'were', 'hearty', 'sporadic.I', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'Various', 'scenes', 'harp', 'not-so-subtle', 'idiosyncrasies', 'exhibited', 'men', 'women', 'relationships', 'Apparently', 'been', 'trouble', 'caused', 'viewers', 'who', 'then', 'have', 'things', 'pointed', 'out', 'relate', 'own', 'mate', 'feelings', 'are', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'are', 'middle', 'stage', 'relationship', 'are', 'early', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'signs', 'anything', 'yet', 'could', 'be', 'highlighted', 'movie', 'are', 'late', 'game', 'are', 'now', 'do', 'pass', 'warning', 'anyway.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'great', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'humor', 'was', 'somewhat', 'amalgamation', 'other', 'roles', 'played', 'had', 'relationship', 'insight', 'did', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'right-on-time', 'trash', 'talk', 'did', 'Swingers', 'will', 'continue', 'tout', 'new', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'slapstick', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'serious', 'drama', 'touching', 'chick', 'flick', 'very', 'likeable', 'screen', 'So', 'far', 'anyway', 'Midas', 'Touch.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'many', 'scenes', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'name', 'attached', 'blockbuster', 'roles', 'well', 'chick-flick', 'niche', 'well', 'suited', 'characters', 'genre.Welcome', 'back', 'movies', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'put', 'few', 'pounds', 'good', 'role', 'was', 'small', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'nagging', 'friend', 'advice', 'misinterpreted', 'Brooke.Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'quirky', 'role', 'one', 'played', 'Thumbsucker', 'characters', 'were', 'vastly', 'different', 'Mr.', ""D'Onofrio"", 'stretching', 'artistic', 'legs', 'little', 'was', 'small', 'part', 'did', 'well.As', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'reincarnation', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'came', 'woodwork', 'Probably', 'only', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'anything', 'ever', 'again', 'did', 'have', 'small', 'roll', 'Tigerland', 'fantastic', 'movie.Jon', 'Favreau', 'was', 'great', 'love', 'see', 'Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'interact', 'screen', 'still', 'picture', 'Mikey', 'Trent', 'Swingers', 'when', 'witty', 'banter', 'begins.The', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough']",N/A

But yesterday, it presented itself and we had time to kill...  And now I know why it wasn't much of a  hit.The trailers of the film promised a comedy about breaking up...and showed lots of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughan...two performers who have a lot of goodwill stored up with the public.  YIKES!  They used much of it up on this flick.  Anyway, all the ""funny"" stuff was in the trailers.  There is very little to laugh at here.That would be okay if this were a serious exploration of the death of a relationship, with some lighthearted modern sensibilities.  Nope, what we get is a shrill and unlikeable couple who never belonged together in the first place yelling at each other!That is the film's biggest (and fatal) flaw.  We see the two meet in the opening scene, in a way that was completely unbelievable.  Cut to opening credits which show a montage of Vaughn, Aniston and various friends and relatives in a series of still photos.  We see that these two became a long-term couple, cuz we see lots of shots of them kissing.  Or looking drunk.Somehow they buy a condo together, and when the relationship implodes, the battle over the condo is almost as important as anything else...particularly to Vaughan.  We simply NEVER see these two together as a happy couple.  The very first scene after the credits shows the relationship teetering.  Then there is a highly uncomfortable ""family dinner"" scene, in which Aniston's closeted brother (played by the usually wonderful John Michael Higgins) sings an a capella version of ""Owner of A Lonely Heart.""  Then, the families leave and the two fight, break up, and then they spend the rest of the movie one-upping each other.WAR OF THE ROSES, with Michael Douglass and Kathleen Turner, explored similar ground with bitter, brilliant and painfully funny results.  Their one-upmanship with each other was far more brutal than the silly pranks Aniston and Vaughan pull.  See that movie if you want a true BLACK comedy about breaking up at all costs.BREAKING UP, as I said, has tiny laughs every so often.  But mostly you watch and shake your head and wonder ""why were these two ever a couple and why do I hate Vince Vaughan and Jennifer Aniston so much?""  We don't really care what happens to either character.  We only see them at their worst.  Then end of the film looks for a bittersweetness...which it actually achieves a tiny dose of.  But otherwise, the tone of the movie is uneven.  It wants to be a wacky romantic comedy...but it misses the romantic part, the comedy part and mostly the wacky part too.  (Judy Davis and Justin Long are the funniest parts of the movie, as Aniston's boss and co-worker...sadly, their characters really belong in another movie.)

1012977,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000HCPS8U,Robert Moore,"[6, 7]","Unlike the previous reviewers of this film, I have the advantage of actually having seen the film at a preview here in Chicago.  I'm happy to report that it is a very decent comedy with many moments that are genuinely funny.  It doesn't quite belong to a genre of comedy known as a remarriage comedy (where a couple splits up and then reconciles despite a host of obstacles), but it isn't far from it.  I won't spoil the film by explaining precisely why it doesn't quite fit that mould.  I'll merely say that it isn't quite as predictable as one might assume at the outset.The plot is fairly simple.  Two people meet at the Cross-town Classic at Wrigley (for non-Chicagoans, that is what Major League Baseball likes to call the Cub-Sox inter-league series) and buy a condo together.  They break up, but neither seems willing to move out.  Comedy ensues as they play a series of mind games with one another.A plot this bare bones could be either good or bad or something in between, depending on what you graft onto the story.  Luckily, most of what they do is quite funny.  Much of the success of the film stems from Vince Vaughan's fabulous gift for comedy.  Jennifer Aniston, who has of course been linked to Vaughan after they met on the set of this film, does a very fine job, but it is Vaughan who drives the film's comedy.  What follows their break up is a string of very funny moments as each tries to get back at the other.There is a very odd bit of somewhat dirty humor in the film.  Jennifer Aniston's character gets a wax treatment in her nether regions known as a Telly Savalas, so that she will make her former boyfriend jealous and desirous when she walks about the apartment naked.  It isn't hard to imagine what that involves, but what makes it odd is that Telly Savalas was Jennifer Aniston's godfather.  Her father, John Aniston (born Anastassakis), was a very close friend of his fellow Greek Savalas and asked him to be Jennifer's godfather.  I just fine it a very, very odd joke given her relation to Savalas.One of the reasons the film is so much fun is the very strong supporting cast.  My fellow Arkansan and Little Rock native Joey Lauren Adams plays Aniston's best friend.  Like many people I first became aware of Vince Vaughan in the Jon Favreau film SWINGERS.  Favreau plays one of Vaughan's best friends in this one, though I swear he must weigh 80 pounds more than he did in SWINGERS.  Vincent D'Onofrio plays one of Vaughan's brothers.  The hugely talented (but under-utilized by Hollywood) Judy Davis has a somewhat inappropriate role as an art gallery owner.  But two actors formerly of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT supply two of the best contributions to the film.  That series's star Jason Bateman has a couple of typically funny moments (using pretty much the same deliver he used for Michael Bluth) and one wishes he had had a larger role.  But John Michael Higgins stole every scene he was in as Aniston's almost-gay brother.  The funniest part of the film might be when he tries to get everyone to sing a song at a dinner early in the film.  On ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT he played the highly professional and perpetually stone-faced lawyer Wayne Jarvis, though film goers will remember him best as the gay dog handler in BEST IN SHOW and the co-leader of a musical group in A MIGHTY WIND.The only reason I can't give this film five stars is that it had some persistent pacing and rhythm problems.  At several points the film drags a bit, scenes not moving at the right pace, the film lingering over bits just a little too long.  It is hard to say precisely who is to blame for such things.  Initial suspicion would go to the film's editor, but sometimes pacing can be dictated by the director or even the producers.  There is no way to tell who is to blame, but the film just doesn't have as much life as it ought to have had.But nonetheless, this is a solid comedy that will delight most viewers.  It isn't a farce like Vaughan's hit from last summer, THE WEDDING CRASHERS, but more in the lines of a very funny date movie.  I would like to add that it is one of the better Chicago films I have seen in a while.  There are a number of Chicago locations that are seen in a host of movies, but also a few that rarely are.

1012980,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B000HCPS8U,Royce Callaway,"[1, 2]","This film has a good premise unfortunately it never seemed to fulfill it or to offer anything other than another Hollywood view of relationships.  This is really unfortunate because this could have been a good film with a variety of messages, instead it simply describes in ever increasing painful detail a failing relationship.  This is not surprising because the film at its core describes two self-absorbed individuals who are committed to only two things -- winning and keeping their condo. There is no real committment to each other or to the relationship, which they constantly talk about but never do anything to repair it or to show they really care about the other person.  The focus is on winning and when Vaughn finally capitulates Anniston walks away -- having won a pyrhic victory.  Thus the moment for the magic word ""marriage"" comes and goes because this isn't about real love or committment to each other, it is all about ME.  The film portrays the modern view of ""relationships"" which essentially means being ""friends with benefits"".  These modern living arrangements are popular but bear no resemblance to either committment or marriage but this point is totally ignored in this film.  These are two people who have a lot of fun together and form a sexual and financial relationhsip but when the downside comes --after several years of fun and frolic -- it collapses -- like so many do in real life -- into a contest of wills.  It becomes very obvious that there was never any committment to each other at a personal level, which I presume is why there was no marriage -- just pseudo-adults playing house.This film had many opportunities to explore marriage versus relationships, it could have contrasted love and passion, it could have shown that true love is about sacrifice, but none of this was present or even attempted.  It was simply a drawn out contest of wills.  In essence it was simply the war of the roses lite --i.e. no violence.  I gave it two stars solely because the final symbolic scene showing them turning their backs on each other and going their separate ways was well done. This was a sad film that had no point, no message, no love, and no marriage.

What makes it stand out I think is its realism (warning to couples in the middle of actual arguments -- this movie may stir things up).  Anyway, it's not as fairly tale artificial as some movies and the main characters were charming in their very different ways.  But I wouldn't say charming actually...that makes it sound like ""Amelie"" or something.  They were relatable and real...and funny.  I would say that if you liked ""Fever Pitch,"" you might like this film too.  It even has a little baseball in it (but just a little).The cinematography is worth mentioning.  Chicago looks great as does Jennifer Aniston.  Vince vaughn was a bit chubby, but I think that was for the role.  In the end of the movie he is thin again for character reasons.Final very important point: often what can turn an okay movie into a memorable exposition of cinema art (or at least a good night in front of the tube in this case I suppose) are the supporting cast members.  John Michael Higgins, whom I had never heard of before, was hilarious as Jennifer Aniston's brother (when he tried to get Vince Vaughn to sing at dinner?  That was gold).

I'm OK with that - I see NO reason she might have 2nd thoughts - we don't see anything redeeming in Vaughn - at least for a while.  What bothered me was that Aniston almost immediately began to back track.  Her goal became making Vaughn change - the eternal female plight.  So what would she have then - a partner that will eventually get back into his old habits while she bemoans becomming Donna Reed.  Can't see that happening in this day - especially in a movie.  So the film lost reality for me at that point.

1012984,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000HCPS8U,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 3]","Now here comes an unlikely summer sleeper: ""The Break-Up,"" scourged by mainstream and Internet critics alike, is a surprisingly good, bittersweet adult comedy, a story modest in ambition but nicely executed by leads Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn and director Peyton Reed. It's a movie that could disappoint the ""Wedding Crashers"" crowd looking for raunchy, cynical humor, but it works on the more basic level of relationships - you sense the bonds and buy the conversations the characters have. Are Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) unlikable? No - they're like us.Reed opens with the couple meeting at a baseball game, fast-forwarding through their happy years with (beautiful, telling) snapshots under the credits, and halting at a fight they have after a family dinner. Their relationship is familiar: Gary has humor and charm, but must also have life structured around him, while Brooke tries too hard to perfect things that don't need it. Brooke keeps dutiful score - she knows what she's done for Gary, when she's done it, and how many times - while Gary, who gets his way, never has to. Brooke ends the relationship in a huff, expecting to mend things later that night, but the rift grows, as it must, for Gary remains in a victim stage. Brooke exhausts her list of guilt trips before Gary hits back with one of his own; when Brooke finds out, Reed lets a look between the two explain more than dialogue.The screenplay by Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender is knowing in the ways men and women fight; there are a lot of lines for the respective genders to nod over. Vaughn and Aniston make excellent bickersons, they're skilled with their sarcasm and delivery in a way that wounds without being cruel. The couple displays chemistry in these scenes; it's just not sexual. Eventually, real and fake love comes down to other things anyway. The couple has it but, out of pride, choose to express it to best friends (Joey Lauren Adams and Jon Favreau).Vaughn creates space for his rat-a-tat routine, and hits a few doubles, especially in a montage about video game football. It's not a movie Vaughn steals, but grounds himself in, attempting to work against his guy's guy persona by playing one while revealing the sham of that lifestyle. ""Your everybody's friend,"" one character tells him. Problem is, Gary doesn't really have any. Aniston is Vaughn's match; Brooke knows how to curse - the words and the music. ""The Break-Up"" stretches credulity maybe a little bit by letting Aniston look fabulous while Vaughn looks bloated and queasy, although this seems to be an issue in their fights.The couch trip is occasionally interrupted by two needless gay characters: Brooke's singing brother (John Michael Higgins) and her assistant (Justin Long), and a ridiculous art gallery owner (Judy Davis) whose type of character you can see for two full hours in the upcoming ""The Devil Wears Prada."" They exist as a diversion for what have been labeled ""difficult"" characters, when in fact they have flashing signs over their heads for the scenes they're in. Favreau does okay as an insightful, blue-collar pug, while Adams kindly reminds Aniston's character that the reclamation project is going well. Jason Bateman drops by for a scene or two, as does Vincent D'Onofrio, who, as Gary's brother, shambles and gesticulates his way through the movie as if he steals that goofy ""Law & Order"" cop.Reed and Vaughn have a made the conscious choice to make this an actor's movie - no zany soundtrack, no relentless editing - although the picture tends to cut back and forth between Gary and Brooke rather than including them in the same shot. A chatty, occasionally intense movie that kids may find too mature, ""The Break-Up"" exudes a confidence in itself most romantic comedies don't have. It mostly works and when it doesn't, at least it isn't desperate and pandering. Best of all it's wise not to wrap its story up in a completely tied bow, though, it in final scenes, we can sense what Gary and Brooke were about before they were Gary, and Brooke.",4,"Breaking up?

The line after that made my jaw drop and I fell out laughing and rewound it several times to laugh all over again. Did he have to go there? Aw man, that tickled me for the evening. Unfortunately that was about the only time I laughed through the whole movie.The plot is about an ungrateful boyfriend who doesn't realize all of the things his girlfriend does for him. The girlfriend is also a nag who doesn't know when to shut up. Sound familiar? I think this has happened in every relationship, but these two chose a strange way of dealing with it...pouting. They try to act single while living together and go above and beyond to outshine each other, pulling their friends and dates into it, too. The condo goes up for sale, and now they have to argue about that battle.Cons: While the movie did have some sentimental parts and some thought-provoking scenes (""It's not what you think"" scene), the funny parts fell flat. The brother who sings was cool for a minute, but it got old fast. The alternate ending should've been cut during the performance part, but it was MUCH better than the chosen ending. The reunion was great, but the singing could've stopped at 45 seconds. We get the point. The rest was just boring. Cowboys and Indians, how NOT clever. But speaking of an alternate ending, I was not at all a fan of the one that the movie really ended with.There was an outtake with an Asian joke that I was none too thrilled about either. Really Vince, you couldn't find anything more original to joke about than math? None of the outtakes were funny outside of the singing brother doing a terrible breakdancing scene at the end.Anyway, the film was okay, but I'm glad I tested it on Netflix instead of buying it.

Everything about this movie is ambiguous and edgy.  You don't know if you are supposed to like him (Vince Vaughn) or her (Jennifer Aniston), the set pieces are cruel, the redemptive moments inadequate...the movie fails because the characters aren't lovable on their own or together.This was a movie that needed another re-write, either to tone down the farcical elements or to play up the happy and gentle moments.

1012992,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000HCPS8U,Steve,"[1, 1]","Some years back, a disturbing film called Fatal Attraction caused a big sensation by showing the absolute worst-case scenario of marital infidelity. Despite the near tragic climax of the movie, the viewer fails to see that the infidel learned his lesson and, to further obfuscate things, his adultery is overshadowed and practically pardoned by her mental instability. No deep introspection or navel gazing epiphany, just a close call and back to the way things were before. The Break-Up does a similar public service of sorts in demonstrating how bad things can go when people end their problematic relationship and similarly avoids addressing the root causes that created the mess. By the time The Break-Up ends, both partners have grown some, but not enough to make me believe they'll not make the same mistakes again. They have picked up the pieces and tidied up but you get the feeling that when it comes time to build again, it'll be the same old house of cards.After a whirlwind dating period turns to co-habitation, the shine fades and things quickly come to a head, thanks to the selfish antics of male stereotype Gary (Vaughn) and his predictable inability to do little more than meet his girlfriend half-way and Jennifer Aniston's Brooke, who makes the fatal error of trying to change someone who is firmly set in his ways, yet another clich&eacute;. But, that leads me to the bigger flaw of The Break-Up; using formulaic Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus images, the movie relishes demonstrating how ugly the end of a relationship can be and how fast love can turn to hate, but it never addresses the problem on a deeper level and gets to the heart of the matter. People aren't clich&eacute;s and relationships aren't supposed to devolve into little more than glorified roommates who sleep together nor should they feel compelled to ""save"" what is already terminal. Yet, the movie is chock full of couples sleepwalking through the sad dance of relationship boredom and misses the opportunity to flush out why they willfully allowed themselves to become the soulless zombies they are. All of us have known and/or been in situations where it is clear that things aren't right and yet few ever seem to have the courage, strength, or sense of determination and foresight necessary to pull the plug. Instead, we soldier on despite the profound differences, boredom, frustration, lack of sex, existential angst, and, in some cases, a genuine dislike of each other, purely for some misguided sense of commitment, financial responsibilities, kids, or, the most popular reason; fear of being unattached and alone. And people perpetuate these mistakes in one relationship after another like lab rats that just can't figure out that the cheese comes with an electric shock. The Break-Up, whether intentionally or not, exposes the inherent fraud of lifeless, dispassionate relationships. It reminds us in one uncomfortable moment after another, what happens when the faade is torn away. This movie is the antithesis of romantic and beneath the light humor and the two-dimensional roles, it serves up a cautionary warning for all of those desperate and fearful people who would rather spend nights next to Mr. or Ms. Wrong than rough it alone while keeping up the search.

It wasn't as cute and funny as the trailers would have you believe, but it does have some true emotions and circumstances that couples experience in a break-up.Gary and Brooke have been together for two years, and have purchased a condo together. Brooke works in an art gallery, and is unafraid of her over-the-top diva boss. Gary is a tour guide with his two brothers - one a jerk, the other Vincent D'Onofrio in a very weird part - his suits are too small and he really has no purpose in the movie except perhaps to show that Gary is the most normal of the bunch.Brooke wants her relationship to succeed and works, cooks, cleans, organizes, arranges to keep everything going. Gary works his job, then lies on the couch and plays video games all night. That's his contribution.  When Brooke asks Gary to bring her 12 lemons, he buys 3, and then gripes at her for having the nerve to complain to him about it. He doesn't want to do anything she asks him to, and he sure isn't going to offer to help, because he doesn't want to help her. He'd rather play video games than take a shower to get ready for the dinner party she has made all the preparations for. Basically, he behaves worse than a spoiled child, and is blind to the fact that Brooke feels unappreciated and overworked. When she lets him know how she feels, he doesn't care.  This is typical of so many couples I know - the women work all day, take care of the kids, cook, clean and keep the house stocked with supplies.  The men work and maybe mow the lawn.  The women are exhausted and end up with low self-esteem. The men don't see what the big deal is.What follows is a learning experience for both.

But I think the one thing everyone can agree on is the superb acting of my man Vince and his counterpart in the film, the beautiful (and talented) Jennifer Aniston.  I really never gave her much credit, having only really seen her work in Friends and the Ben Stiller flick 'Along Came Polly'.  But she shines in this film.  First of all, the camera loves her.  I don't think she has one bad frame in the entire movie.  And her acting chops actually surprised me this time around.  The one scene in her room after the concert (I won't give it away) is poignant and seems ""real"" and well-acted.  I think sometimes you can appreciate how well an actor emotes by seeing the reaction of their co-actors in a scene, and it is visible to me that Vaughn is genuinely moved by her performance and it results in a tender scene that seems unscripted and from a real place.  But I digress cuz I'm not trying to sound too sappy...but I really like the film.  It's subjectline is a little depressing, but anyone who has ever been in a relationship only to realize it's demise, you will find a way to relate to the characters in the film.  Vince Vaughn, as usual, is superb.  His comedy, in my opinion, is all his own and no one can touch him when he is on his game.  To me, I feel like alot of his funniest lines are his ad-libs, because I don't think anyone else could write such funny quips that he delivers so effortlessly and in such an unrehearsed tone.  The guy rocks!  He never bores me on-screen, and I love when he shows his more sensitive side onscreen...which is usually quite in contrast to his more jovial and kid-like persona that he indulges in 95% of the time.  As his work in other films, he shows he is versatile and can turn on and off his comedic charm whenever he wants in deference to some frailty, vulnerability and real adult emotion.  A pleasure to watch.  The supporting cast is SUPERB and I highly recommend this film to all.  Just keep in mind that although it can be dubbed as a comedy/drama, the line is blurred throughout and the ending doesn't exactly leave you jumping for joy.

Forget about buying the ordinary dvd.  Here's my advice:  Go out and splurge. [...].This is all the entertainment you'll ever need in life, trust me.  It's a Jennifer Anniston flick where she portrays Jennifer Anniston in yet another ""She's really a good girl..."" type of movie.  Who could ever want anything else?It's not that ""The Breakup"" is unwatchable.  It's not.  It's cute, in an uninspired sort of way.

He's a clown who spends his free time playing video games and drinking Bud Light at the local sports bar.  Hey, it's art imitating life.And the Anniston character...  All I can say is:  What a dope!As for the acting itself, Vaughn seems to fit the bill, although I can't imagine how he personally could ever relate to his character.  Anniston is another story.  After nearly 20 years on the scene, Anniston's range seems to be nonexistent.  Not that she really needs one... After all, Doris Day made a good living in romantic comedies.  But at least Day's career was punctuated with better actors, like James Stewart, and better producers, like Alfred Hitchcock.Unlike her more flamboyant competitor, Jolie of tabloid fame, Anniston doesn't play the mother of an ancient warrior or a modern day femme fatale a la Tomb Raider.  A few more flicks like ""The Breakup"" and Anniston's career will likely careen over like a lead balloon and land with a crash back into the bizarre world of TV sitcoms.What ""The Breakup"" is not:  A dazzling screen epic of biblical proportion.

1013001,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000HCPS8U,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[6, 9]","After watching this movie on cable recently, I didn't know what to think. Was this supposed to be a ""romantic comedy""? If so, maybe I missed something, because I failed to see any real humor in it. If anything, I found it to be rather sad - two people in a relationship suddenly finding all kinds of faults with one another until they decide to call it quits. And oh yeah, they just happen to share a condo together, but neither one of them wants to move out. I guess that was supposed to be the humorous hook in this script, but even that isn't very amusing. The whole story itself was conceived by Vince Vaughn, who I give kudos to for coming up with a pretty good idea. Because Vince was behind it, you would have expected it to be funny - not so. It starts off funny, but somewhere along the line, you stop laughing.I just never believed that these two could be a couple in the first place. After all, they had nothing in common. Vince as Gary is in partnership with his two brothers in a Chicago tourism venture, but he is also lazy, sloppy, loud, immature, uncultured and he reverted to his bachelor habits far too quickly for me to believe that he really had any feelings for Brooke (Jennifer Aniston). Brooke is an uptight, prissy, perfectionist-type who works in an art gallery and seems too much of a diva to find Gary to be appealing, not to mention entering into the kind of commitment buying a condo together would take. They are as mismatched as oil and vinegar and I just didn't feel like there was any on-screen chemistry between them. Off-screen, it might have been a different story for Vince and Jen, but that didn't translate well in this film. I found it hard to sympathize with either of their characters. All I saw was a couple constantly arguing, finding different ways to hurt each other's feelings over and over again, and demanding family and friends to take sides in their dispute. It was upsetting, not to mention tiresome. Again, there were some moments that make you laugh, but not enough to label this a comedy. However, I especially liked Judy Davis' role as Marilyn, the fiesty gallery owner and Brooke's boss.Like one of the reviewers mentioned, real love means accepting someone for whom they are and not trying to change them, which I thought Brooke wanted to do with Gary. She should have paid more attention to the type of person he was, because I'm quite sure he wasn't hiding those aspects of himself from her. She could have made the decision not to get involved with him. So basically, she knew what she was getting into. It should have been no surprize to her when Gary didn't want to do certain things or behaved in an immature manner.

It is so unbelievably bad that it will only leave you depressed.I can't say I'm a fan of Jennifer Anniston or Vince Vaughn. I mean, these two people created the term 'Type Cast' for crying out loud. Jennifer sits there and plays a likeable little lady and Vince is a wise cracking moron. You get the sense immediately when the film starts rolling as they meet at a baseball game. Vince is so overbearing and obnoxious you're begging for the concrete mezzanine at Wrigley Field to break apart and fall onto his section, his row, and his seat as it does a couple times during the summer.The credits show cute snapshots of the two together. Kind of a montage of their.... I don't know, months together before they buy a condo.As soon as that Director credit fades out, it's one hour and thirty minutes of the two bickering. It's not that that couldn't be entertaining, but the problem is that you're never able to tell whether or not they dislike each other.

1013008,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000HCPS8U,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 4]","This film begins simply - Vince Vaughn is typecast as the self-confident aggressive loudmouth Gary Grobowski, who we meet attending a Cubs game with his friend Johnny O (Jon Favreau).  His brash pickup attempt intrigues Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston), and apparently sufficient chemistry develops between them that they not only decide to live together but actually jointly purchase the condo that they share. Of course, since this movie is about THE BREAK-UP, it never shows any of the good times which convinced Gary and Brooke that their relationship was worthwhile and thus the moviegoer has no understanding of what they might do to save it as it progressively deteriorates. The talented cast members who play various supporting roles as friends, co-workers, employers and family includes Judy Davis, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ann-Margaret, Cole Hauser, Joey Lauren Adams, Justin Long and John Michael Higgins does succeed in somewhat humanizing the stars a well as alleviating somewhat the depressing nature of the story by providing many of the truly comic moments that the film offers.If this movie has any message, it seems to be that you should be sure that your relationship with your current partner will last before you decide that you're ready to jointly buy a condo. The cast perform their roles well; however, the script is somewhere between uninteresting and depressing and the direction and editing manage to showcase its weaknesses rather than emphasize its strengths. Vaughn both was a co-author and co-producer of this film, and his multiple roles apparently did not allow enough objectivity for him to realize that his depiction of Gary was so edgy and egotistical that it was difficult not only for the moviegoer to understand why Brooke was attracted to him but more importantly to have any investment in whether he could successfully address Brooke's increasing alienation as they proceed toward what appears an increasingly unavoidable BREAK-UP.If you are a fan of either of the stars and are interested in a ""slice of life"" film or if you have recently been involved in a destructive relationship, then you may well find this film more enjoyable than I did. And there is enough comedy to keep the story from becoming depressing; I believe that the best adjective to describe it is simply uninteresting. It is not a bad film, I just cannot find any reason to strongly recommend it. The last twenty minutes of the film do very belatedly allow Brooke and Gary to finally honestly address their relationship and the flaws in their own characters that have led to their current impasse. Unfortunately, this succeeds only to highligt the lost potential of the remainder of the story. At least the ending is consistent with the story to that point rather than the all too frequent Hollywood totally improbable ""they all lived happily ever after"" conclusion. Instead, the moviegoers are only left to ponder the same intriguing questions as Brooke and Gary. First, are there circumstances which are able to motivate an adult sufficiently so that he/she will be able to substantially change their basic personality traits? Second, does the passage of time and the perspective that it provides allow deep emotional wounds to eventually become completely healed? Unfortunately, so much time has already been spent developing the obvious reasons why the relationship is in trouble and setting up the periodic humorous interludes that there is no time remaining to explore these truly interesting questions once they are finally raised.Tucker Andersen",2,"(2 1/2) Not Romantic, Not a Comedy",1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,3559,"['film', 'simply', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'typecast', 'self-confident', 'aggressive', 'loudmouth', 'Gary', 'Grobowski', 'who', 'meet', 'attending', 'Cubs', 'game', 'friend', 'Johnny', 'O', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'brash', 'pickup', 'attempt', 'intrigues', 'Brooke', 'Meyers', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'apparently', 'sufficient', 'chemistry', 'not', 'only', 'decide', 'live', 'together', 'actually', 'jointly', 'purchase', 'condo', 'share', 'course', 'movie', 'BREAK-UP', 'never', 'good', 'times', 'convinced', 'Gary', 'Brooke', 'relationship', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'thus', 'moviegoer', 'understanding', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'save', 'progressively', 'talented', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'play', 'various', 'supporting', 'roles', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'employers', 'family', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Ann-Margaret', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Justin', 'Long', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'succeed', 'somewhat', 'humanizing', 'stars', 'well', 'alleviating', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'nature', 'story', 'providing', 'many', 'truly', 'comic', 'moments', 'film', 'movie', 'message', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'sure', 'relationship', 'current', 'partner', 'will', 'last', 'decide', ""'re"", 'ready', 'jointly', 'buy', 'condo', 'cast', 'perform', 'roles', 'well', 'however', 'script', 'somewhere', 'uninteresting', 'depressing', 'direction', 'editing', 'manage', 'showcase', 'weaknesses', 'rather', 'emphasize', 'strengths', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'co-author', 'co-producer', 'film', 'multiple', 'roles', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'enough', 'objectivity', 'realize', 'depiction', 'Gary', 'was', 'so', 'edgy', 'egotistical', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'only', 'moviegoer', 'understand', 'why', 'Brooke', 'was', 'attracted', 'more', 'importantly', 'have', 'investment', 'could', 'successfully', 'address', 'Brooke', 'increasing', 'alienation', 'proceed', 'what', 'increasingly', 'unavoidable', 'BREAK-UP.If', 'are', 'fan', 'stars', 'are', 'interested', 'slice', 'life', 'film', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'involved', 'destructive', 'relationship', 'then', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'enough', 'comedy', 'keep', 'story', 'becoming', 'depressing', 'believe', 'best', 'adjective', 'describe', 'simply', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'reason', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'do', 'very', 'belatedly', 'allow', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'finally', 'honestly', 'address', 'relationship', 'flaws', 'own', 'characters', 'have', 'led', 'current', 'impasse', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'highligt', 'lost', 'potential', 'remainder', 'story', 'least', 'ending', 'consistent', 'story', 'point', 'rather', 'too', 'frequent', 'Hollywood', 'totally', 'improbable', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'conclusion', 'Instead', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'only', 'left', 'ponder', 'same', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'Brooke', 'Gary', 'First', 'are', 'circumstances', 'are', 'able', 'motivate', 'adult', 'sufficiently', 'so', 'he/she', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'substantially', 'change', 'basic', 'personality', 'traits', 'Second', 'passage', 'time', 'perspective', 'allow', 'deep', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'eventually', 'become', 'completely', 'healed', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'already', 'been', 'spent', 'developing', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'why', 'relationship', 'trouble', 'setting', 'up', 'periodic', 'humorous', 'interludes', 'time', 'remaining', 'explore', 'truly', 'interesting', 'questions', 'are', 'finally', 'raised.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

The film stars Vince Vaughn as the biggest jerk in the film, Gary Grobowski and Jennifer Aniston as his lover, Brooke Meyers (ironically this film about spoiled relationships and refusals of reconciliation brought Vaughn and Aniston together as a couple).  After a dinner with both Brooke and Gary's families present, the two become involved in a heated argument.  Gary, being the stubborn, pig-headed male that he is, refuses to take the first step and apologize for his overdramatics. Thus, what begins as a simple failure to communicate turns into an extended ""he said, she said"" and ""he did, she did"" fight that escalates beyond the point of no return.There are a few funny moments in the movie, the film includes a strong cast with some fine acting, and it does a good job of displaying some of the differences between how men and women deal with difficulties.  Both Brooke and Gary desperately want reconciliation between each other, but neither is willing to bridge the gap and perform the work that needs to be done.  Instead, they each attempt to make the other become angrier and more upset than they already are.  Each attempt that Brooke makes to turn Gary jealous and upset fails.  Her attempts fail because each of her attempts are things that would upset a woman. Brooke mistakenly believes that Gary thinks the same way that she does. However, Gary is a man and instead of Brooke's attempts infuriating, they propel him to further compete in what he believes is nothing more than a game of one-upmanship.  On the other hand, Gary does know what can hurt Brooke and each one of his efforts severely hurt Brooke. That is Gary's mistake, he believes the whole thing to be one big game.THE BREAK-UP is a major let-down.  Watching the film is similar to watching two people purposely destroy their lives, knowing it's not what they want to do, but because of pride they refuse to stop.  It's extremely sad and despite the realistic moments, it is so depressing it becomes too unrealistic.  THE BREAK-UP, however, is the best movie I've seen in a long time to illustrate the importance of commitment in a romantic relationship.

They don't share a lot of on screen time but the collaberation between the two is always dynamite and funny as hell. Cole Hauser proves again that he is limited and a good bit player but he is not bad. Vincent D'Nofrio (sp?) is just excellent as Vaughn other brother. Jennifer Anniston is ok and is good for this type of role which is playing Jennifer Anniston or basically the same role she played on Friends and every other thing she has been in. For the life of me I love when they hype a nude scene and how risque it is and then you come to find that the scene was shot so that it could have been Rosey O'donnel walking across the floor. You see, you could see Jenn's head and her making her coy little Rachel faces as she is suppose to be so shocking but they literally make the picture so blurry it could have been a Sasquatch walking across the floor and you wouldn't have known.Now for my knock on the movie and why I only gave it a 2. It just fell apart in the end. It became a hugely overly dramatic... melodramatic semi tear jerker and downer in the end. I saw the same thing in Art School Confiential and the same thing in Adam Sandlers Click. They take a semi funny movie (The Break Up was much funnier than the two I just mentioned because of Vaughn and Favreau) and then they ditch the whole side splitting funny stuff for the whole ""getting serious now"" or ""emotional message"" thing at the end that just killed it.

It's like when you have to walk on eggshells around your house when your parents argue. Very tense.I watched the whole movie, waiting patiently for the ""romantic"" part of the movie to start. I expected the two characters to get over their differences, realize that they still loved each other, and get back together. The ending was not what I expected.

Watching this loser movie in person only confirmed my suspicions: Vince, stay with your acting, man. The question? How did your additional roles in this movie (in addition to acting that is) contribute to it?From beginning to end, it is one big self-gratification project for Vaughn and I'm sorry that Aniston lend herself to the role of Brooke. The storyline is poorly developed from the confusing beginning to the extremely anticlimactic ending. Jennifer has had much better roles, and I am very surprised that she would lower herself so much. I don't need to get into all the details, other people have done that already. But if you really want to see an incomplete story of a poorly matched couple's breakup, be my guest.

War of the Roses did it with divorce, The Money Pit did it with buying the first house, and now the Break-Up does it with the updated live together couple.  With Vince Vaughn as Gary, and Jennifer Aneston as Brooke, the meet at the beginning of the movie, appear to fall in love, buy a condo together, and proceed make a life of it. Enter us and the main film.  Gary is a tour guide in the city of chicago, proud polish working his tail off, and Brooke is an educated art dealer, just looking for some help around the house and acknowledgement. After a failed dinner party with both of their families, the couple has a Falling Out, and the Break up begins.  With some ugly things, and some funny things, a trail of love peeks through. This movie is not a constant laugh-out loud movie, but it has its moments.  But I think the ending was just their. Its one of those things you have to see.  It leave the door open, and leave you hanging, what happens next, which is how many relationships actually end. You might expect the fairy tale ending in a movie, let alone a comedy, but this one is different from that. This movie is a reflextion of today's society.
