Th have many of the characters and spend an inordinate amount of time playing with them, creating and imagining new worlds where these creatures are in control. As a parent, I love it, as I see the imagination and know that they are creating something special. Thus, when I was asked to watch this new series I was excited to do so. I have to say that I was impressed with the overall series, the  cartoon work was strong and the plot and story were fun and easy to follow. My girls enjoyed it because that got to see some of the same characters that they had in their rooms come to life on screen. I only wish there were more episodes that I could share with my girls, but so far this is all that there is that I can see, and I have not been able to find this series on our cable station yet (as we do not yet have the Hub, though I hope we get it soon! All-in-all, if you have kids that love Littlest Pet Shop, they will love this new cartoon series!",5,A Great Series!,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,999,"['kids', 'are', 'BIG', 'fans', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Th', 'have', 'many', 'characters', 'spend', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'playing', 'creating', 'imagining', 'new', 'worlds', 'where', 'creatures', 'are', 'control', 'parent', 'love', 'see', 'imagination', 'know', 'are', 'creating', 'something', 'special', 'Thus', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'watch', 'new', 'series', 'was', 'excited', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'overall', 'series', 'cartoon', 'work', 'was', 'strong', 'plot', 'story', 'were', 'fun', 'easy', 'follow', 'girls', 'enjoyed', 'got', 'see', 'same', 'characters', 'had', 'rooms', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'could', 'share', 'girls', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'series', 'cable', 'station', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'Hub', 'hope', 'get', 'soon', 'All-in-all', 'have', 'kids', 'love', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'will', 'love', 'new', 'cartoon', 'series']","The Littlest Pet Shop: Little Pets, Big Adventures"

They were beyond elated when they found out their favorite toys would be coming to life on the small screen. In the first ever episode, you join Beth Baxter who moves to New York and lives above a pet day care. When Beth learns she can understand what the animals are saying, her real life adventure begins. The show is filled with fun music and dancing that will really appeal to younger children. This fun new series is sure to make Littlest Pets an even bigger phenomenon than it already is.",4,Littlest Pets Come to Life on the Small Screen,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,612,"['have', 'two', 'daughters', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'obsessed', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shops', 'were', 'elated', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'favorite', 'toys', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'life', 'small', 'screen', 'first', 'ever', 'episode', 'join', 'Beth', 'Baxter', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'lives', 'pet', 'day', 'care', 'When', 'Beth', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'animals', 'are', 'saying', 'real', 'life', 'adventure', 'show', 'filled', 'fun', 'music', 'dancing', 'will', 'really', 'appeal', 'younger', 'children', 'fun', 'new', 'series', 'sure', 'make', 'Littlest', 'Pets', 'even', 'bigger', 'phenomenon', 'already']","The Littlest Pet Shop: Little Pets, Big Adventures"

She expresses to her father and her friends how important it is to have communication with one another.  This film is appealing and suitable for the recommended age group. My children collect the Littlest Pet Shop figurines so I was interested in seeing what the voices and personalities would be like in this film.Our youth reviewers said: This movie was fun and I would watch it again.  The story is interesting.  Blythe tries to be nice and a good person all the time.  I learned what peer pressure was from the movie.  Blythe stood up to bullies when they  made fun of her friends,4,Very enjoyable. Blythe is a positive role model who handles herself well under pressure.,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,729,"['Blythe', 'importance', 'having', 'good', 'attitude', 'when', 'father', 'news', 'are', 'moving', 'home', 'father', 'friends', 'how', 'important', 'have', 'communication', 'one', 'film', 'appealing', 'suitable', 'recommended', 'age', 'group', 'children', 'collect', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'voices', 'personalities', 'would', 'be', 'film.Our', 'youth', 'reviewers', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'story', 'interesting', 'Blythe', 'tries', 'be', 'nice', 'good', 'person', 'time', 'learned', 'what', 'peer', 'pressure', 'was', 'movie', 'Blythe', 'stood', 'up', 'bullies', 'when', 'made', 'fun', 'friends']","The Littlest Pet Shop: Little Pets, Big Adventures"
1597005,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B009INAMA8,The IEMommy,"[2, 2]","I was so excited to find out the Littlest Pet Shop is on DVD!  My daughter LOVES animals and she fell in love with these animals a year ago and has been obsessed ever since.  She has a few of their playhouses and a ton of the animals.  It was fun to watch it with her and see her beloved animals come to life!The first thing I noticed about Little Pets, Big Adventures was the opening song sounded like it's from a real movie I'd watch, specifically a romantic comedy or family movie.  The narration reminded me of an adult movie as well instead of a cartoon.  This always tends to draw me in because I know it'll be more interesting and high quality than your average cartoon.Blythe Baxter and her dad move to a new home, which she is not very excited about.  I can completely relate to this having moved across the country at ten years old!  They move into an apartment above the Littlest Pet Shop. She quickly learns that there are mean girls everywhere and it will be difficult adjusting to her new environment.  Lucky for her she also discovers that she can communicate with the animals in the Littlest Pet Shop!  Things start to improve from there!I loved this DVD!  Blythe is such a fun and cool character whose appearance fits right in with what you'd imagine a human to look like on the Littlest Pet Shop. She has the same huge eyes and disproportionately large head.  Long eyelashes and pretty brown hair complete the look.Little Pets, Big Adventures deals with important issues like how mean kids can pick on and bully other kids.  It talks about huge life changes kids have to deal with like moving and making new friends.  It will help any child going through these types of things to know that it's normal and they are not alone.  My daughter has found friends in all her Littlest Pet Shop animals!We are thrilled to have a new DVD unlike any other we own!",5,Beloved Characters Come to Life,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,1870,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'find', 'out', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'LOVES', 'animals', 'fell', 'love', 'animals', 'year', 'ago', 'been', 'obsessed', 'ever', 'few', 'playhouses', 'ton', 'animals', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'see', 'beloved', 'animals', 'come', 'life', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'about', 'Little', 'Pets', 'Big', 'Adventures', 'was', 'opening', 'song', 'sounded', 'real', 'movie', ""'d"", 'watch', 'specifically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'family', 'movie', 'narration', 'reminded', 'adult', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'instead', 'cartoon', 'always', 'draw', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'high', 'quality', 'average', 'cartoon.Blythe', 'Baxter', 'dad', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'not', 'very', 'excited', 'can', 'completely', 'relate', 'having', 'moved', 'country', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'move', 'apartment', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'quickly', 'are', 'mean', 'girls', 'everywhere', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'adjusting', 'new', 'environment', 'Lucky', 'also', 'can', 'communicate', 'animals', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Things', 'start', 'improve', 'there', 'loved', 'DVD', 'Blythe', 'such', 'fun', 'cool', 'character', 'appearance', 'fits', 'right', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'human', 'look', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'same', 'huge', 'eyes', 'disproportionately', 'large', 'head', 'Long', 'eyelashes', 'pretty', 'brown', 'hair', 'complete', 'look.Little', 'Pets', 'Big', 'deals', 'important', 'issues', 'how', 'mean', 'kids', 'can', 'pick', 'bully', 'other', 'kids', 'huge', 'life', 'changes', 'kids', 'have', 'deal', 'moving', 'making', 'new', 'friends', 'will', 'help', 'child', 'going', 'types', 'things', 'know', 'normal', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'daughter', 'found', 'friends', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'are', 'thrilled', 'have', 'new', 'DVD', 'other', 'own']","The Littlest Pet Shop: Little Pets, Big Adventures"
1597006,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B009INAMA8,Z Hayes,"[7, 8]","My eight-year-old daughter and her friends love the new LPS cartoon series currently being shown on TV. She had missed the first couple of episodes and I was glad to see the DVD had just been released. This cartoon is fun for children who love the LPS toys and my daughter especially loves the Blythe character and all the LPS animals.The cartoon series is a half-hour animated show that sees Blythe Baxter and her dad move into an apartment above The Littlest Pet Shop. Initially, Blythe is not happy about the move but she soon makes a startling discovery - she can communicate with the little pets that go to pet day care at The Littlest Pet Shop! The pets comprise a doggie diva, a gecko, a cute panda, etc. and have unique personalities and cute names such as Pepper Clark, Penny Ling, Zoe Trent, Russell Ferguson, Sunil Nevla, Minka Mark, and Lenny. Unlike some other kids' animated shows, my eight-year-old (and I) actually enjoy the songs on this show with their catchy tunes.The episodes featured on this DVD are:Blythe's Big Adventure - Parts 1 & 2Bad Hair DayGailbreak!Penny for your LaughsThere are also several bonus features such as:A Look Behind the Pet Shop DoorsColoring SheetsThere's also a pet collector token inside which can be scanned with the new LPS app. to collect a virtual petThe total running time is 110 minutes in full color.This is a fun series and I hope other DVDs of the LPS shows will be released soon.",5,Fun and entertaining LPS episodes,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1437,"['eight-year-old', 'daughter', 'friends', 'love', 'new', 'LPS', 'cartoon', 'series', 'currently', 'being', 'shown', 'TV', 'had', 'missed', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'DVD', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'cartoon', 'fun', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'LPS', 'toys', 'daughter', 'especially', 'Blythe', 'character', 'LPS', 'animals.The', 'cartoon', 'series', 'half-hour', 'animated', 'show', 'Blythe', 'Baxter', 'dad', 'move', 'apartment', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Initially', 'Blythe', 'not', 'happy', 'move', 'soon', 'startling', 'discovery', 'can', 'communicate', 'little', 'pets', 'go', 'pet', 'day', 'care', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'pets', 'comprise', 'doggie', 'diva', 'gecko', 'cute', 'panda', 'etc', 'have', 'unique', 'personalities', 'cute', 'names', 'such', 'Pepper', 'Clark', 'Penny', 'Ling', 'Zoe', 'Trent', 'Russell', 'Ferguson', 'Sunil', 'Nevla', 'Minka', 'Mark', 'Lenny', 'other', 'kids', 'animated', 'shows', 'eight-year-old', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'show', 'catchy', 'tunes.The', 'episodes', 'featured', 'DVD', 'are', 'Blythe', 'Big', 'Adventure', '1', '2Bad', 'Hair', 'DayGailbreak', 'Penny', 'LaughsThere', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'Look', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'DoorsColoring', 'SheetsThere', 'also', 'pet', 'collector', 'token', 'can', 'be', 'scanned', 'new', 'LPS', 'app', 'collect', 'virtual', 'petThe', 'total', 'running', 'time', '110', 'minutes', 'full', 'color.This', 'fun', 'series', 'hope', 'other', 'DVDs', 'LPS', 'shows', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'soon']","The Littlest Pet Shop: Little Pets, Big Adventures"
