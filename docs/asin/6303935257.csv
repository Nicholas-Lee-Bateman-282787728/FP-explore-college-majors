The elegant Charles Boyer and charming and amusing Irene Dunne star in this beautiful romance between two people who meet and fall in love, but are already engaged to others.  They allow each other six months to get free for each other with the promise of a rendezvous at the top of the Empire State Building.  The day of the rendezvous comes, but not all goes as planned, and the lovers have to make new plans.

390483,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303935257,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Having seen and fallen completely smitten with `An Affair to Remember', I was really excited to dive right into `Love Affair'.  Couple that with the fact that it stars Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer and you have more than a few reasons to see this movie (especially since I think I prefer both of these actors to the two in `An Affair to Remember').One thing that I was a little disappointed in (actually, the ONLY thing) was that this film, or should I say `An Affair to Remember', is a carbon copy of the other.  They are identical in nearly every way, and that for me is a tad underwhelming.  I shouldn't fault this film AT ALL, since it came first, but I already saw and reviewed `An Affair to Remember' and so I can't call it out.  The fact that it was written and directed by the same director is a tad, well, confusing.  Not to bring up Haneke again, but I had a similar complaint with his English version of `Funny Games' (but that was more on principle than anything else).  I don't see the need to remake a film unless you are going to give it a twist, making it fresh.  Making the SAME EXACT film twenty years after you made the first isn't really making it fresh.THAT SAID, both versions are pure and delightful and heartfelt and should be seen and adored.  I feel like I'm breaking my own rule by saying this, but I can't help it.I `heart' both of these movies.The film tells of playboy Michel who just so happens to be settling down. On a cruise he happens to meet Terry, a charming woman who also happens to be settling down. The two are instantly attracted to one another, but fear that exposure of time spent could bring harmful consequences has them attempting to avoid suspicion. Michel's charm is too much and before long they are spending a lot of time together, innocently at first, but it doesn't take long for genuine feelings to creep up within both parties. They try and separate themselves in order to remain true to their significant others, but their desire runs too deep and before the cruise has ended they have fallen in love. Wanting to be sure that this is the real thing, they decide to separate for six months (giving Michel the opportunity to actually work for his catch in more ways than one) only to reunite on the Empire State Building.But will they ever meet again?Irene Dunne is beautifully charismatic as Terry, showing true flirtatious bravado as she strings her man along, and Charles Boyer is her perfect match, layering Michel with a distilled charm that is alluring.  I loved Kerr and Grant and I love Dunne and Boyer.  Specifying who was better is hard (although I will say that Grant delivers the performance of his career in `An Affair to Remember' and may be the best of the four as well) and a task I don't think I want to attempt.  Despite their undeniable similarities, both films do feel fresh and engaging in their own right.See them both, love them both, own them both!",5,An affair to remember!,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2926,"['Having', 'seen', 'fallen', 'completely', 'smitten', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'dive', 'right', 'Love', 'Affair', 'Couple', 'fact', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'have', 'more', 'few', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', 'especially', 'think', 'prefer', 'actors', 'two', 'Affair', 'Remember', '.One', 'thing', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'actually', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'was', 'film', 'should', 'say', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'carbon', 'copy', 'other', 'are', 'identical', 'nearly', 'way', 'tad', 'underwhelming', 'should', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'AT', 'ALL', 'came', 'first', 'already', 'saw', 'reviewed', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'out', 'fact', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'director', 'tad', 'well', 'confusing', 'Not', 'bring', 'up', 'Haneke', 'again', 'had', 'similar', 'complaint', 'English', 'version', 'Funny', 'Games', 'was', 'more', 'principle', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'remake', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'give', 'twist', 'making', 'fresh', 'Making', 'SAME', 'EXACT', 'film', 'twenty', 'years', 'made', 'first', ""n't"", 'really', 'making', 'fresh.THAT', 'SAID', 'versions', 'are', 'pure', 'delightful', 'heartfelt', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'adored', 'feel', ""'m"", 'breaking', 'own', 'rule', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'it.I', 'heart', 'movies.The', 'film', 'tells', 'playboy', 'Michel', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'cruise', 'meet', 'Terry', 'charming', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'two', 'are', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'one', 'fear', 'exposure', 'time', 'spent', 'could', 'bring', 'harmful', 'consequences', 'attempting', 'avoid', 'suspicion', 'Michel', 'charm', 'too', 'much', 'long', 'are', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'innocently', 'first', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'creep', 'up', 'parties', 'try', 'separate', 'order', 'remain', 'true', 'significant', 'others', 'desire', 'too', 'deep', 'cruise', 'ended', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'Wanting', 'be', 'sure', 'real', 'thing', 'decide', 'separate', 'six', 'months', 'giving', 'Michel', 'opportunity', 'actually', 'work', 'catch', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'only', 'reunite', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building.But', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'again', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'beautifully', 'charismatic', 'Terry', 'showing', 'true', 'flirtatious', 'bravado', 'man', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'perfect', 'match', 'layering', 'Michel', 'distilled', 'charm', 'alluring', 'loved', 'Kerr', 'Grant', 'love', 'Dunne', 'Boyer', 'Specifying', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'hard', 'will', 'say', 'Grant', 'performance', 'career', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'four', 'well', 'task', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'attempt', 'undeniable', 'similarities', 'films', 'do', 'feel', 'fresh', 'engaging', 'own', 'right.See', 'love', 'own']",N/A

390486,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303935257,Bobby Underwood,"[54, 55]","The depth and charm of Leo McCarey's 1939 film, Love Affair, places it far above most love stories and miles ahead of his own remake in later years. Irene Dunne would certainly have taken home the Oscar in any other year as she had many fine performances which were deserving. A fine script by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart takes us from sparkling wit to bittersweet love with ease, thanks to McCarey's fine direction and the performances of Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer.Terry McKay (Dunne) and Michel Marnet (Boyer) are aboard the S.S. Napoli on an ocean cruise contemplating their impending marriages; she to a decent fellow who is more a friend than anything, and he to a very wealthy industrial heiress who doesn't excite him much but can afford his playboy lifestyle. They meet by chance when she reads his cablegram to a girl other than his fiance by mistake and teases him about it. They must avoid prying eyes aboard ship when a charming romance takes shape, as his engagement is in all the society papers.Dunne is a witty hoot as the American girl from New York, Terry McKay, and Boyer gives a very charming performance as Michel Marnet, a man with talents who spends most of his time living it up rather than doing something with his life. Terry gets a glimpse of what he might be when she meets his charming elderly grandmother on a stop in Porto Santo, Madeira.A beautiful rose covered villa with a chapel which makes Terry want to whisper is Janou's home. She and Janou make a connection when the old woman sees that she may be the good woman who could make Michel's life right. She fears a bill may be coming for all Michel's living which he can not pay. There is a beautiful scene in the chapel Michel will paint from memory when the two part.But they promise to meet in six months on top of the Empire State building at 5:00 to see if Michel can earn a living through his painting and be worthy to ask her hand in marriage. But he waits until midnight in the pouring rain and Terry does not come. What he doesn't know is the sirens he heard below at 5:00 were for Terry, who had been struck down crossing the street and crippled, perhaps for life.Terry doesn't want Michel to know her fate and he returns to his former life in a half-hearted attempt to drown thoughts of what might have been. Terry, who was a singer, falls into a job as music teacher for the orphanage next to the ward where she was treated and tries to make a life for herself. Michel sees her in a theatre not knowing a wheel chair outside the theatre doors is the reason she did not meet him.When his grandmother passes on, he uses the gift she wanted Terry to have as an excuse to track her down and discover why she abandoned their chance at love. Terry keeps a shawl over her legs but a painting he had only recently decided to sell because the buyer was poor and crippled will bring things all into focus.A love story of rare beauty, this is a neglected treasure in American cinema. Most prints of this film are decent but it would be wonderful to see it restored to the original luster it must have had when released to theatres in 1939. Dunne sings ""Spring in My Heart"" and the Oscar nominated ""Wishing"" is sung by her group of orphans. A nice score by Roy Webb enhances the mood of another RKO classic. A memorable romance with charm that is perfect for a rainy day.",5,Pink Champagne,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,3369,"['depth', 'charm', 'Leo', 'McCarey', '1939', 'film', 'Love', 'Affair', 'far', 'most', 'love', 'stories', 'miles', 'ahead', 'own', 'remake', 'later', 'years', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'taken', 'home', 'Oscar', 'other', 'year', 'had', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'were', 'deserving', 'fine', 'script', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'Donald', 'Ogden', 'Stewart', 'sparkling', 'wit', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'ease', 'thanks', 'McCarey', 'fine', 'direction', 'performances', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Charles', 'Boyer.Terry', 'McKay', 'Dunne', 'Michel', 'Marnet', 'Boyer', 'are', 'S.S.', 'Napoli', 'ocean', 'cruise', 'contemplating', 'impending', 'marriages', 'decent', 'fellow', 'who', 'more', 'friend', 'anything', 'very', 'wealthy', 'industrial', 'heiress', 'who', ""n't"", 'excite', 'much', 'can', 'afford', 'playboy', 'lifestyle', 'meet', 'chance', 'when', 'cablegram', 'girl', 'other', 'fiance', 'mistake', 'must', 'avoid', 'prying', 'eyes', 'ship', 'when', 'charming', 'romance', 'shape', 'engagement', 'society', 'papers.Dunne', 'witty', 'hoot', 'American', 'girl', 'New', 'York', 'Terry', 'McKay', 'Boyer', 'very', 'charming', 'performance', 'Michel', 'Marnet', 'man', 'talents', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'living', 'rather', 'doing', 'something', 'life', 'Terry', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'charming', 'elderly', 'grandmother', 'stop', 'Porto', 'Santo', 'Madeira.A', 'beautiful', 'rose', 'covered', 'villa', 'chapel', 'Terry', 'want', 'whisper', 'Janou', 'home', 'Janou', 'make', 'connection', 'when', 'old', 'woman', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'Michel', 'life', 'right', 'bill', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'Michel', 'living', 'can', 'not', 'pay', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'chapel', 'Michel', 'will', 'paint', 'memory', 'when', 'two', 'part.But', 'promise', 'meet', 'six', 'months', 'top', 'Empire', 'State', 'building', '5:00', 'see', 'Michel', 'can', 'earn', 'living', 'painting', 'be', 'worthy', 'ask', 'hand', 'marriage', 'midnight', 'pouring', 'rain', 'Terry', 'not', 'come', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'sirens', 'heard', '5:00', 'were', 'Terry', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'struck', 'down', 'crossing', 'street', 'crippled', 'perhaps', 'life.Terry', ""n't"", 'want', 'Michel', 'know', 'fate', 'former', 'life', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'drown', 'thoughts', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Terry', 'who', 'was', 'singer', 'job', 'music', 'teacher', 'orphanage', 'next', 'ward', 'where', 'was', 'treated', 'tries', 'make', 'life', 'herself', 'Michel', 'theatre', 'not', 'knowing', 'wheel', 'chair', 'theatre', 'doors', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'him.When', 'grandmother', 'passes', 'gift', 'wanted', 'Terry', 'have', 'excuse', 'track', 'down', 'discover', 'why', 'abandoned', 'chance', 'love', 'Terry', 'shawl', 'legs', 'painting', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'decided', 'sell', 'buyer', 'was', 'poor', 'crippled', 'will', 'bring', 'things', 'focus.A', 'love', 'story', 'rare', 'beauty', 'neglected', 'treasure', 'American', 'cinema', 'Most', 'prints', 'film', 'are', 'decent', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'see', 'restored', 'original', 'luster', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'when', 'released', 'theatres', '1939', 'Dunne', 'Spring', 'My', 'Heart', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Wishing', 'sung', 'group', 'orphans', 'nice', 'score', 'Roy', 'Webb', 'mood', 'RKO', 'classic', 'memorable', 'romance', 'charm', 'perfect', 'rainy', 'day']",N/A

390491,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6303935257,Classic Movie watcher,"[11, 12]","I regard An Affair to Remember (Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr) a very romantic film noted for its well-thought dialogue, wholesome plot and excellent performances by its leading characters. Love Affair was actually a much earlier 1939 production which I watched only now. To my pleasant surprise, despite the nearly identical dialogues and storyline, Love Affair has its own edge and would not be eclipsed by its highly successful successor.Charles Boyer (Gaslight), with his signature French accent, effortlessly played Michel Marnet - a painter who never had a job and never worried about money. I think Cary Grant a great actor. Yet Charles Boyer was superb in portrayiing a ""playboy"" who enjoys life and does not conform to society and mundane needs. Irene Dunne (Life with Father) was as elegant and beautiful as Greta Garbo. Together the two epitomized the blue-blooded upper class - not just in their look and living style - with an air of royalty around them.Here lies the first difference between the two films - In Love Affair, Boyer-Dunne looked like blue-blooded European royalties but had no money. In An Affair to Remember, Grant-Kerr looked ordinary folk who had acquired good taste. That said, there were great chemistry in both couples. The second difference lied in the fact that Love Affair was B&W; and not digitally remastered, which might not be a bad thing afterall. It gave an authentic feel of a classic love story retold. And the magnificent Boyer-Dunne more than made up for this technicality defect. They didn't so much as act, they just graced the screen with their presence. Whether you had seen An Affair to Remember or not, this movie itself is a classic gem, performed by two wonderful stars, that appeals to the romantics.",4,A classic gem,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,1751,"['regard', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'very', 'romantic', 'film', 'noted', 'well-thought', 'dialogue', 'wholesome', 'plot', 'excellent', 'performances', 'leading', 'characters', 'Love', 'Affair', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'earlier', '1939', 'production', 'watched', 'only', 'now', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'nearly', 'identical', 'dialogues', 'storyline', 'Love', 'Affair', 'own', 'edge', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'eclipsed', 'highly', 'successful', 'successor.Charles', 'Boyer', 'Gaslight', 'signature', 'French', 'accent', 'effortlessly', 'played', 'Michel', 'Marnet', 'painter', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'job', 'never', 'worried', 'money', 'think', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'great', 'actor', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'was', 'superb', 'portrayiing', 'playboy', 'who', 'life', 'not', 'conform', 'society', 'mundane', 'needs', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Life', 'Father', 'was', 'elegant', 'beautiful', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Together', 'two', 'epitomized', 'blue-blooded', 'upper', 'class', 'not', 'just', 'look', 'living', 'style', 'air', 'royalty', 'them.Here', 'first', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'Love', 'Affair', 'Boyer-Dunne', 'looked', 'blue-blooded', 'European', 'royalties', 'had', 'money', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'Grant-Kerr', 'looked', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'who', 'had', 'acquired', 'good', 'taste', 'said', 'were', 'great', 'chemistry', 'couples', 'second', 'difference', 'lied', 'fact', 'Love', 'Affair', 'was', 'B', 'W', 'not', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'afterall', 'gave', 'authentic', 'feel', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'retold', 'magnificent', 'Boyer-Dunne', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'technicality', 'defect', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'act', 'just', 'graced', 'screen', 'presence', 'Whether', 'had', 'seen', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'not', 'movie', 'classic', 'gem', 'performed', 'two', 'wonderful', 'stars', 'appeals', 'romantics']",N/A

I found that I was able to watch it on Internet Archive but have now bought my own copy.What a truely lovely film.  Very sad, especially the sequence with Janou the grandmother and of course, at the end.  What a great combination Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne were.  Before my time, they were really just names to me but now that I have found them I am gradually building up a collection of their films both as a couple and as individuals.Irene Dunne deserved her Oscar nomination.  What a charming and intelligent actress she was.  I have also just watched her in a comedy.  She seems to have been able to turn her skills to anything.  Charles Boyer wasn`t nominated but I think he should have been, if just for the scene at the end as he finally realises what has happened.  It is some of the most moving acting I have ever seen.  In a minute or so, he manages to convey shock, horror, dismay, sorrow and finally relief that at last he has the answer.  All of this without a word being spoken.  He was an amazing actor.

But 'Love Affair' proves how sophisticated Hollywood used to be - look at the way the film moves from public to private, from cynical public marriages and affairs to true private love; and the way its themes are expressed through art - Dunne is a singer, Boyer a painter - which similarly moves from public exploitation to private truth-telling and reconciliation.

The plot is as simple and sweet as the title, with its tale of true love found, disrupted, and found again -- the sort of love affair we all wish we could have.Playboy Michel (Charles Boyer) encounters nightclub singer Terry (Irene Dunne) and flirts with her, but backs away when she says that she's engaged. He is too. But they keep bumping into each other, and their friendship grows as their feelings do. As the voyage ends, they promise to meet in six months at the Empire State building, to see if Michel can be a responsible husband.In the six months that follow, he does become a successful sign painter -- then a portrait artist. But on the day they're supposed to meet, Terry is run down by a car and may be crippled for life -- and the heartbroken Michel thinks she has dumped him. It will take another twist of fate to bring them back together.""Love Affair"" has been remade at least three times, including as the classic ""Affair to Remember"" and the blockbuster ""Sleepless in Seattle."" But though the original is the least known, it's still the most enchanting -- you can almost forget that you're watching a pair of actors doing their job. Most onscreen romances can't boast that.The charm of their love affair is that it's so simple. They talk awkwardly, visit Michel's kindly old grandmother, and even pounce on a paparazzi who photographs them. The are obstacles, but director Leo McCarthy doesn't throw any strained artificial twists into the storyline. The whole crippled-by-a-car thing could have taken the movie into soapy-melodrama territory, but it's handled pretty matter-of-factly.And Boyer and Dunne really make this movie. They actually act like a couple falling in love despite themselves -- awkward, a little chattery, thinking just of each other. As the movie wears on, they grow more comfortable with each, and it becomes clearer why the feisty American girl and the idle Frenchman are falling for each other. Both do an amazing job, especially Boyer in the final scene, when he realize.It should be noted that there aren't currently ANY good prints of this movie available for purchase, and this is no exception. It desperately needs to be cleaned up, remastered and reissued, but until that happens, expect somewhat blurry pictures and slightly crackly sound. Iy's a credit to the movie that its enjoyability isn't affected by the bad copies.""Love Affair"" is one of those really magical love stories, with its simple story and amazing acting.

390498,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303935257,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 12]","Directed by Leo McCarey, this 1939 romantic classic is the first and best version of the old warhorse of a fateful shipboard romance between an aimless playboy and a nightclub singer, both engaged but appearing to be destined to reunite on the top floor of the Empire State Building. The elaborate, shot-for-shot 1957 remake again directed by McCarey with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr is much better known, and Warren Beatty even saw fit to remake it yet again with his wife Annette Bening for a 1994 update featuring an 87-year old Katharine Hepburn in her last film role.But it all started with this more modest film starring a smart, luminous Irene Dunne as Terry McKay and Charles Boyer all continental charm as Michel Marnet. The story is as contrived as ever, but the script co-written by McCarey, Mildred Cram, Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart is full of clever dialogue to go with the soap opera elements.  It's too bad the print condition is so bad given that it has fallen into the public domain, but you can still get a strong sense of the craftsmanship behind the film, especially Rudolph Mat&eacute;'s soft-focus cinematography.Even though Maria Ouspenskaya gives her most sympathetic performance as Grandmother Janou (she was wonderfully malevolent in ""The Wolf Man""), it's really the chemistry between the two stars which keeps this afloat, especially Dunne who was so dexterous in comedy and drama in her prime that she is far superior to either Kerr or Bening. She even gets to sing two songs most winningly, one a Harold Arlen gem called ""Sing My Heart"". Even though you are likely to know every scene by heart from the 1957 remake, it's still quite worthwhile to enjoy the antiquated charms of the original.",4,The Original and Still Best Version of the Classic Tearjerker,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,1730,"['Directed', 'Leo', 'McCarey', '1939', 'romantic', 'classic', 'first', 'best', 'version', 'old', 'warhorse', 'fateful', 'shipboard', 'romance', 'aimless', 'playboy', 'nightclub', 'singer', 'engaged', 'appearing', 'be', 'destined', 'reunite', 'top', 'floor', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'elaborate', 'shot-for-shot', '1957', 'remake', 'again', 'directed', 'McCarey', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'much', 'better', 'known', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'even', 'saw', 'fit', 'remake', 'yet', 'again', 'wife', 'Annette', 'Bening', '1994', 'update', 'featuring', '87-year', 'old', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'last', 'film', 'role.But', 'started', 'more', 'modest', 'film', 'starring', 'smart', 'luminous', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Terry', 'McKay', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'continental', 'charm', 'Michel', 'Marnet', 'story', 'as', 'contrived', 'ever', 'script', 'co-written', 'McCarey', 'Mildred', 'Cram', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'Donald', 'Ogden', 'Stewart', 'full', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'go', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'too', 'bad', 'print', 'condition', 'so', 'bad', 'given', 'fallen', 'public', 'domain', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'craftsmanship', 'film', 'especially', 'Rudolph', 'Mat', 'eacute', 'soft-focus', 'cinematography.Even', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'Grandmother', 'Janou', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'malevolent', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'really', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'keeps', 'afloat', 'especially', 'Dunne', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'dexterous', 'comedy', 'drama', 'prime', 'far', 'superior', 'Kerr', 'Bening', 'even', 'sing', 'two', 'songs', 'most', 'winningly', 'one', 'Harold', 'Arlen', 'gem', 'called', 'Sing', 'My', 'Heart', 'Even', 'are', 'likely', 'know', 'scene', 'heart', '1957', 'remake', 'still', 'quite', 'worthwhile', 'enjoy', 'antiquated', 'charms', 'original']",N/A

Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne make the characters live  in a way that is rarely duplicated today. They do not merely deliver their lines expertly, they internalize every emotion, every nuance of joy or sadness. They speak and act  like real people, not actors schooled in dramatic technique. Some will say that the plot is sentimental and improbable. Perhaps, but many of us have either lived such improbable events ourselves or witnessed them in others.

""Love Affair"" has aged well, and prompts its audience to overcome all these barriers.  Irene Dunne is such a special movie star.  Her sparkling smile sets the screen aglow.  It's hard to see how her character Terry can remain so positive throughout all that happens to her. But Dunne brings an inner faith to life in the chapel scene, which makes it all believable.  Her costumes literally sparkle and glow, even through the black & white film.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar that went to Vivian Lee for ""Gone With the Wind.""  Charles Boyer as the playboy and painter brings an international intrigue to his role.  We meet the character at a time when he begins to tire of endless romantic flings and allows the lovely Terry to capture his heart.  Maria Ouspenskaya received a supporting actress Oscar nomination for the film.  This was the year that Hattie McDaniel became the first black actress to win an Oscar for ""Gone With the Wind.""  As Boyer's grandmother, she has a lovely sparkle and zest that captures the audience's heart.  A classical stage actress who studied with Stanislavsky in Russia, she fully embodies the heart of the film.  When Boyer presents her lace shawl to Terry, it is such a bittersweet moment.  ""Love Affair"" is a classic romantic film.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1939.  ""Gone With the Wind"" took home the honor against an amazingly strong field of nominees: ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Ninotchka,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" Stagecoach,"" ""Wuthering Heights"" & ""Of Mice & Men.""

This film is very well made, and except for the slightly old-fashioned romantic style, holds up as contemporary as any performance today. I like this version of the story far better than the Cary Grant/ Deborah Kerr effort. Nothing to do with the performance of those two fine actors, much more to do with the music and the even more embroidered romantically frilly style. Boyer's performance in this as a prideful playboy who doesn't want to be a sucker for love is nicely vulnerable. The instant-watch copy of this is sufficiiently clean.

390514,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6303935257,Martin Asiner,"[28, 30]","LOVE AFFAIR is one of many films whose theme is that love does not adhere to imposed schedule.  What distinguishes this movie from other and similar ones is what the actors do and say after they realize this. Terry McKay (Irene Dunne) and Michel Marnet (Charles Boyer) are each romantically involved with other people when they meet and fall in love on a sea voyage to New York.  This sort of thing happens often enough in real life but their reaction to their new emotions reveals their basic decency and depth of feeling.  They agree to meet months later on the top floor of the Empire State Building to cement their relation.  Thus far, the tone is one of light, romantic comedy.  However, LOVE AFFAIR takes an unexpected tragic detour as Terry is crippled in a car accident.  Other movies have often dealt with issues in which one lover grows ill or crippled, but in this film, one of the lovers (Terry) makes things worse by hiding her condition by running away from Michel.  For most of the second half, Terry and Michel are apart physically but connected emotionally.  Each copes with the separation as best as they can.  Michel's grief is probably the easier to cope with since he feels that he was unjustly jilted so what can he do about that except heal.  Terry's grief is more multi-faceted since she has to live with a series of complicating factors, only one of which (her being confined to a wheelchair) is beyond her control.  She must reconcile her present unhappiness with the unpleasant realization that she could have tossed away a life of bliss with a man who might not have been scared off by the prospect of a wheelchair bound wife.  Miss Dunne was a deserved nominee for Best Actress as she manages to hide her misgivings about her decision to break off the relation beneath smile and song.  Charles Boyer is convincing as a man who loses his love, does not know why, and then must face the consequences of factors totally beyond his control.  LOVE AFFAIR is not your three hanky sobber.  Rather it is an intelligent exploration of love gone astray, a condition exacerbated when one of them discovers that this love sometimes needs a healthy dose of honesty and confidence to keep it on track.",4,Love Affair: Love Overcomes Adversity,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,2216,"['LOVE', 'AFFAIR', 'one', 'many', 'films', 'theme', 'love', 'not', 'adhere', 'imposed', 'schedule', 'What', 'movie', 'other', 'similar', 'ones', 'what', 'actors', 'do', 'say', 'realize', 'Terry', 'McKay', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Michel', 'Marnet', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'are', 'romantically', 'involved', 'other', 'people', 'when', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'sea', 'voyage', 'New', 'York', 'sort', 'thing', 'happens', 'often', 'enough', 'real', 'life', 'reaction', 'new', 'emotions', 'reveals', 'basic', 'decency', 'depth', 'feeling', 'agree', 'meet', 'months', 'later', 'top', 'floor', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'cement', 'relation', 'Thus', 'far', 'tone', 'one', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'However', 'LOVE', 'AFFAIR', 'unexpected', 'tragic', 'detour', 'Terry', 'crippled', 'car', 'accident', 'Other', 'movies', 'have', 'often', 'dealt', 'issues', 'one', 'lover', 'ill', 'crippled', 'film', 'one', 'lovers', 'Terry', 'things', 'worse', 'hiding', 'condition', 'running', 'away', 'Michel', 'most', 'second', 'half', 'Terry', 'Michel', 'are', 'apart', 'physically', 'connected', 'emotionally', 'copes', 'separation', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'Michel', 'grief', 'probably', 'easier', 'cope', 'was', 'unjustly', 'jilted', 'so', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'heal', 'Terry', 'grief', 'more', 'multi-faceted', 'live', 'series', 'complicating', 'factors', 'only', 'one', 'being', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'control', 'must', 'reconcile', 'present', 'unhappiness', 'unpleasant', 'realization', 'could', 'have', 'tossed', 'away', 'life', 'bliss', 'man', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'scared', 'off', 'prospect', 'wheelchair', 'wife', 'Miss', 'Dunne', 'was', 'deserved', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Actress', 'hide', 'misgivings', 'decision', 'break', 'off', 'relation', 'beneath', 'smile', 'song', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'convincing', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'then', 'must', 'face', 'consequences', 'factors', 'totally', 'control', 'LOVE', 'AFFAIR', 'not', 'three', 'hanky', 'sobber', 'intelligent', 'exploration', 'love', 'gone', 'astray', 'condition', 'exacerbated', 'when', 'one', 'love', 'sometimes', 'healthy', 'dose', 'honesty', 'confidence', 'keep', 'track']",N/A

It is the most expensive movie in our collection, but to justify the cost I bought all three and assembled them into a gift for my wife. She loved it!

390520,A1WEFI02Q80FG4,6303935257,Robin,"[2, 2]","I 've spent years reading that the original Love Affair with Irene Dunn and Charles Boyer was the gold standard. But it was pretty tough to believe, when Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr starred in the remake. As individual actors they topped my list of favorites.But sometimes a whole is more than the sum of its parts--and sometimes small changes in a story affect the balance. So it was with Love Affair, which I saw for the first time, tonight.Much as I liked the Grant Kerr version of this movie, some things didn't make sense. Cary Grant never seemed like a womanizer nor a gigolo. He seemed too sincere, too direct, too obviously in love from the start.  And Kerr  seemed more like a socialite than a serial mistress. She was so elegant, so classy. Yes,  I know that there are elegant classy professional mistresses  in real life, but in the movies, women like Deborah are not among them.The last third of the Grant Kerr An Affair to Remember,  always seemed overly maudlin. i didn't buy Grant as a bill board painter, even to pay bills. For that matter I had a hard time seeing him as an artist. Kerr seemed so earnest it was hard to imagine her keeping the accident a secret.Dunne and Boyer play it differently. Both seem tremenously insecure, and both seem like likable people who really have been living on other's money for sex. In the Dunne Boyer version, Dunne's relationsip with her lover is a lot clearer. Boyer is more obviously a giglo, not just a guy marrying for money. Consequently the title ""Love Affair"" has a more pointed meaning. Dunne and Boyer are having affairs with other people. But their ""love affair"" is chaste, and in the six months they are parted, they strive to become better people, and succeed.By contrast, Grant and Kerr, have an ""Affair to Remember"" which they begin thinking that they will go on to marry others. Of course they fall in love, but the final third of the movie, where they change their lives doesn't completely ring true. When Kerr keeps the secret of her accident from Grant, it seems silly. Why keep a secret from reliable Cary Grant? But when Dunne keeps it from Boyer it makes sense. Boyer really does seem the irresponsible playboy, and Dunne doesn't know the extent to which he has changed.I will alway like both movies but this version is now  my favorite.

In this one, Irene Dunne's charm and comedic talents- to say nothing of her phenomenal singing ability- carry the day.  In case anyone's wondering, that's really her carolling out ""Sing My Heart"", effortlessly hitting a gooseflesh-inducing high note towards the end , then doubling the stakes with an even higher final one.This was obviously a class ""A"" effort by RKO when it was made in 1939, with the best of everything that studio had to offer brought to bear on the production.  Unfortunately, something has happened to put ""Love Affair"" into the public-domain category, with the result that we have the film only in badly-duped prints full of splices, jumps, hiss and blur.  ""Love Affair"" deserves the best treatment that Warner Bros., present owners of its surviving elements, could give it if they chose.Hopefully, ""Love Affair's"" plight will soon rouse the sympathies of George Feltenstein, the Warner's exec who is in charge of restoring the studio's classic catalogue.  While those public-domain dupes will always have a price advantage, seeing ""Love Affair"" restored to Warner Home Video's impeccable standards would be well worth the necessarily higher price.In the meantime, the present DVD is much, much better than nothing, and ""Love Affair"" is worth your time no matter how bad it looks, because Irene Dunne's performance shines through every technical glitch.",4,This Is a Job For George Feltenstein,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1523,"[""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'decide', 'like', 'version', 'story', 'better', '1957', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'versions', 'have', 'strengths', 'one', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'charm', 'comedic', 'talents-', 'say', 'nothing', 'phenomenal', 'singing', 'ability-', 'carry', 'day', 'case', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'really', 'carolling', 'out', 'Sing', 'Heart', 'effortlessly', 'hitting', 'gooseflesh-inducing', 'high', 'note', 'end', 'then', 'doubling', 'stakes', 'even', 'higher', 'final', 'one.This', 'was', 'obviously', 'class', 'A', 'effort', 'RKO', 'when', 'was', 'made', '1939', 'best', 'everything', 'studio', 'had', 'offer', 'brought', 'bear', 'production', 'Unfortunately', 'something', 'happened', 'put', 'Love', 'Affair', 'public-domain', 'category', 'result', 'have', 'film', 'only', 'badly-duped', 'prints', 'full', 'splices', 'jumps', 'hiss', 'blur', 'Love', 'Affair', 'best', 'treatment', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'present', 'owners', 'surviving', 'elements', 'could', 'give', 'chose.Hopefully', 'Love', 'Affair', 'plight', 'will', 'soon', 'rouse', 'sympathies', 'George', 'Feltenstein', 'Warner', 'exec', 'who', 'charge', 'restoring', 'studio', 'classic', 'catalogue', 'public-domain', 'dupes', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'price', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'Love', 'Affair', 'restored', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'impeccable', 'standards', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'necessarily', 'higher', 'price.In', 'meantime', 'present', 'DVD', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'nothing', 'Love', 'Affair', 'time', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'performance', 'shines', 'technical', 'glitch']",N/A

In the first hashing of this story, Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer play the star-crossed pair on a transatlantic cruiser and fall in love. They plan to meet at the Empire State Building in several months, but an accident prevents Dunne from showing up. The end is perhaps the best scene, in which Boyer discovers what happened to Dunne- it's one of the few believable scenes in the picture.Unfortunately, casting is not as believable. Irene Dunne chirps and quips her way through the picture, and does not seem to be acting up to her caliber until the last emotional scene (Why was this, of all of Dunne's finest performances, nominated for an Oscar?). Charles Boyer fares somewhat better, when that heavy French accent doesn't get in the way. Marie Ouspenskaya is indeed very good as Boyer's wise grandmother.The cinematography is very good, and costumes are very good. Unfortunately, both fail completely saving the picture. For a better version, see &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; the REAL best of the lot: Chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr is much deeper and more enchanting, and glowing Technicolor adds a real nice touch to the story. Even in the role of the grandmother, Cathleen Nesbitt fares better than Marie Ouspenskaya.
