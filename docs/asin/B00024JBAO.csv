A high profile visitor soon arrives in town and not long after a murder takes place.  Are the two stories connected?  Such is the style of most Foyle dramas;  usually more than one story line if  drawn out for us viewers per episode.  Sometimes the story lines eventually converge, but more often than not, they play out on separate planes.  The viewer thus often has a doubly hard time trying to figure out which of the 2 (or more) threads of happenings is the one that is connected to the murder that Foyle is trying to tackle.  So, it's not just who dunnit, but which story engendered murder and which dead-ends with simple (in comparison) robbery, adultery, blackmail, non leathal back-stabbing, or whatever.  Then you have to choose from several possible suspects as to who was responsible for the vilest deed.  In ""50 Ships,"" in particular at least 2 characters not involved in murder ultimately are arrested for other crimes.  Likewise, in the episode ""Among the Few,"" 4 characters not including the murderer are ultimately arrested for various crimes and misdemeanors.  To complicate things even further, many murders during Foyle's War episodes do not necessarily occur in the first 10-30 minutes of these 95-100 minute long programes.  In one episode herein the sole murder (some episodes have several too, to further complicate your guessing odds) doesn't occur until 50 minutes into the episode.My advice thus is not to overly focus  on actively trying to solve these tough-to-crack mysteries.  Notwithstanding the ""Columbo"" series being  a totally different style of show, Foyle's War shares a number of similarities with Peter Falk's famed detective:  the who-did-it is not the most interesting part of the show, but watching the very deliberate and understated dectective go about his job.  I particularly relish Columbo's speech manners and the way he draws things out as if they were salt water taffy as he hems and haws, pauses, retreats, etc.  Michael Kitchen's Foyle, albeit in his own unique way, is entertaining just to watch as well.  He is a man of few words, but very communicative with his demeanor, facial expressions, and the like. A hostile possible suspect verbally lambasts Foyle in one episode, for instance, while Foyle looks into this man's eyes watching him vent.  When the man finishes, Foyle begins to pass the man on his way out.  The man comes after Foyle trying to add a coda to his venting and when doing so attempts to grab hold of Foyle's arm.  Foyle simply continues on his way and half over his shoulder, simply says to a uniformed officer behind him, ""arrest this man.""  In another episode a person asks how Foyle knew something that would be hard to know and came to the conclusion that he did.  To which Foyle responds, a picture in his hand, and a knowing expression on his expressive face:  ""I found this in her diary.  I found the diary under her pillow."" Maybe I'm just a glutton for language precisely employed, language--bereft of unneeded words---delivered with style.  Cheers",5,"""If I'm to do my job, how can I let you leave?""

All in all, each episode has been quite good, often being as impressive as many large budget films. In a few places attitudes of the now replace attitudes of the war era, which hurts the show from a purist historical perspective, but casual observers should probably not be bothered! Due to the nature of the visual props and the use of historic persons, the show seems to promise a good representation of the attitudes of the times, but that has not always been the case.Great shots of Spitfires flying, old automobiles, military vehicles, often impressive air raid recreations.Quite gory, as though the film crew studied forensics manuals before filming, and other than that, I would say that if you have children and don't care for them to be exposed to cultural garbage, this is a good show for them.It is a very good program, worth watching.",5,Historic Setting adds plausability to detective drama,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,1051,"['put', 'simply', 'series', 'engaging', 'well', 'rounded', 'set', 'characters', 'set', 'early', 'war-time', 'WW2', 'southern', 'England', 'often', 'mixing', 'history', 'drama', 'mystery', 'detective', 'mystery', 'episode', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'often', 'being', 'as', 'impressive', 'many', 'large', 'budget', 'films', 'few', 'places', 'attitudes', 'now', 'replace', 'attitudes', 'war', 'era', 'show', 'purist', 'historical', 'perspective', 'casual', 'observers', 'should', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'Due', 'nature', 'visual', 'props', 'use', 'historic', 'persons', 'show', 'promise', 'good', 'representation', 'attitudes', 'times', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'case.Great', 'shots', 'Spitfires', 'flying', 'old', 'automobiles', 'military', 'vehicles', 'often', 'impressive', 'air', 'raid', 'recreations.Quite', 'gory', 'film', 'crew', 'studied', 'forensics', 'manuals', 'filming', 'other', 'would', 'say', 'have', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'be', 'exposed', 'cultural', 'garbage', 'good', 'show', 'them.It', 'very', 'good', 'program', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[7, 7]","Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) returns in the second season of Foyle's War, and the series remains as well-written and gripping as the first season was. Foyle is a British cop based in the southern part of England. It's Autumn, 1940. Britain, woefully unprepared, is at war with Germany. Foyle is a taciturn man, even sad. He has lost his wife and his only child has signed up with the Royal Air Force and is a fighter pilot. Foyle knows his son is going to be at high risk every time he takes off. Foyle desperately wanted to join up, too, but was told by his superiors that his talents are far better utilized where he is. He has reluctantly accepted that reality. Foyle is a dedicated, no-nonsense cop. He's respectful to authority and the rich, but he isn't intimidated. If a person has committed a crime, especially one which could damage Britain's war effort, Foyle will never let up until the crime is solved and justice -- by the book -- is done.This series is effective for several reasons. The production values are high. A great deal of effort has been placed in evoking the look and style of England at the start of WWII. The cast which backs up Kitchen is first rate. These include the ongoing characters of Samantha Stewart played by Honeysuckle Weeks (a great name) as Foyle's driver. Stewart is an energetic, curious young woman, brave when she needs to be, who gradually earns Foyle's respect. Paul Milner is played by Anthony Howell. Milner, who lost a leg in the Norway campaign, is assigned to Foyle as his detective sergeant. Milner has to build back his confidence and Foyle can't give him much time to do so. Showing up in one-time roles this season are such accomplished actors as Alan Howard, Amanda Root, Nicholas Farrell, Corin Redgrave and Henry Goodman.Most of all, the series works so well because of Michael Kitchen and the mysteries themselves, all of which are drawn from issues of the early war period. Kitchen is an excellent, subtle, versatile actor whose long career includes the amusing and reprehensibly egoistic doctor in Reckless, the well-intentioned but naive king utterly outmaneuvered by Francis Urquhart in To Play the King and the unprincipled charlatan who finds himself facing Inspector Morse. Inspector Foyle is a serious, thoughtful man of high principles, who keeps most of his deepest feelings to himself but who is not without a sense of wry humor. Kitchen captures the man perfectly. The mysteries this season involve an illicit fuel racket, a genteel hotel out of harm's way with very good food that attracts the wealthy who don't like bombs, an organized ring of looters, a highly-placed American up to his eyes in murder and Lend Lease and how money tries to influence murder investigations as well as government contracts. The series was conceived and is researched and written by Anthony Horowitz, who consistently turns out literate and complex scripts.Also out are Seasons 1 and 3, with 4 on its way. Each of the four stories is approximately 1' 40"" long. The four DVDs in the set have excellent pictures and audio. Extras include interviews with Weeks and Howell and cast filmographies.",5,DCI Foyle returns in season two of this excellent WWII home-front mystery series,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,3180,"['Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Christopher', 'Foyle', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'second', 'season', 'Foyle', 'War', 'series', 'well-written', 'gripping', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'Foyle', 'British', 'cop', 'based', 'southern', 'part', 'England', 'Autumn', '1940', 'Britain', 'woefully', 'unprepared', 'war', 'Germany', 'Foyle', 'taciturn', 'man', 'even', 'sad', 'lost', 'wife', 'only', 'child', 'signed', 'up', 'Royal', 'Air', 'Force', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'Foyle', 'son', 'going', 'be', 'high', 'risk', 'time', 'off', 'Foyle', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'join', 'up', 'too', 'was', 'told', 'superiors', 'talents', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'utilized', 'where', 'reluctantly', 'accepted', 'reality', 'Foyle', 'dedicated', 'no-nonsense', 'cop', 'respectful', 'authority', 'rich', ""n't"", 'intimidated', 'person', 'committed', 'crime', 'especially', 'one', 'could', 'damage', 'Britain', 'war', 'effort', 'Foyle', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'crime', 'solved', 'justice', 'book', 'done.This', 'series', 'effective', 'several', 'reasons', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'been', 'placed', 'evoking', 'look', 'style', 'England', 'start', 'WWII', 'cast', 'up', 'Kitchen', 'first', 'rate', 'include', 'ongoing', 'characters', 'Samantha', 'Stewart', 'played', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'great', 'name', 'Foyle', 'driver', 'Stewart', 'energetic', 'curious', 'young', 'woman', 'brave', 'when', 'be', 'who', 'gradually', 'Foyle', 'respect', 'Paul', 'Milner', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'Milner', 'who', 'lost', 'leg', 'Norway', 'campaign', 'assigned', 'Foyle', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'Milner', 'build', 'back', 'confidence', 'Foyle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'Showing', 'up', 'one-time', 'roles', 'season', 'are', 'such', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'Alan', 'Howard', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'Henry', 'Goodman.Most', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'mysteries', 'are', 'drawn', 'issues', 'early', 'war', 'period', 'Kitchen', 'excellent', 'subtle', 'versatile', 'actor', 'long', 'career', 'amusing', 'reprehensibly', 'egoistic', 'doctor', 'Reckless', 'well-intentioned', 'naive', 'king', 'utterly', 'outmaneuvered', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'Play', 'King', 'unprincipled', 'charlatan', 'who', 'facing', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Inspector', 'Foyle', 'serious', 'thoughtful', 'man', 'high', 'principles', 'who', 'most', 'deepest', 'feelings', 'who', 'not', 'sense', 'wry', 'humor', 'Kitchen', 'man', 'perfectly', 'mysteries', 'season', 'involve', 'illicit', 'fuel', 'racket', 'genteel', 'hotel', 'harm', 'way', 'very', 'good', 'food', 'wealthy', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bombs', 'organized', 'ring', 'looters', 'highly-placed', 'American', 'up', 'eyes', 'murder', 'Lend', 'Lease', 'how', 'money', 'influence', 'murder', 'investigations', 'as', 'well', 'government', 'contracts', 'series', 'was', 'conceived', 'researched', 'written', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'who', 'consistently', 'out', 'literate', 'complex', 'scripts.Also', 'out', 'are', 'Seasons', '1', '3', '4', 'way', 'four', 'stories', 'approximately', '1', '40', 'long', 'four', 'DVDs', 'set', 'have', 'excellent', 'pictures', 'audio', 'Extras', 'include', 'interviews', 'Weeks', 'Howell', 'cast', 'filmographies']",N/A

The first set of stories was so fabulous I bought the second set sight unseen before Masterpiece Theater presented them on it's regular Sunday night program and I'd do it again.  My hope is that there will be third and fourth sets in the series, which seems feasible as the war year is 1940 in film #4, and because, excepting the PRIME SUSPECT series with Jane Tennyson,  these are the best mysteries to come along in a while. If the Corporation for Public Broadcasting had been marketing works like these from the gitgo, perhaps we would have a regular Mystery Theater series instead of the hit or miss proposition we have now. I hate it when organizations such as A&E; get credit for the fine work the BBC-PBS partnership produced over the years, though A&E; has managed to produce a few shows of it's own and get others onto DVD.  BBC may go it alone (but like A&E; with far too many commercials, hint, hint). Guess there are still folks out there who don't realize how these ""non-commercial"" broadcast stations are funded.You may discover terrible facts watching this series. These days, we Americans and British wage war without personal sacrifice (gasoline rationing? What's that?) Those under 50 can't remember what sacrifice was like in the 1940s. For example, how many thousands if not millions of people died in the London blitz? Do you know millions of dogs and cats were ""put down"" because there was not enough food for humans let alone pets? The authorities sprayed horse meat not fit for human consumption green, so that folks would not think you were feeding your dog human food.I love this series.

824477,A2F3U8FECR2C3R,B00024JBAO,Dr Jack L Edwards,"[18, 75]","I have seen a number of the Foyle's War episodes and generally found them well done, although a little on the emotive side. The Foyle character seems a thoughtful and compassionate man yet strong and relentless in the pursuit of justice.I was disappointed with this episode (""Fifty Ships"") because of its strong anti-American flavour. The TV and movie media have not been shy in recent years with their increasing entertainment-as-propaganda and this qualifies as a good example; perhaps Mr. Horowitz simply wants to steal a bit of Michael Moore's fame. I had hoped to be entertained but instead watched a very good actor, Michael Kitchen, used to score political points against the Americans.Details of this episode appear below, so if you haven't seen it and don't want to find out about it before you watch it, then read no further.  However, my analysis of this as well as another episode in this set of Foyle's War (""Among the Few"") might influence how you view the intentions of the writer and whether you want to spend your time and money watching other episodes.  It's up to you.Well, how did it happen?The only American in this episode is vital to British interest and is portrayed as an arrogant thief, liar and cold-blooded killer, who murders a weak and broken man. Near the end of the episode, he is often shown smirking at the fact that he has the power to avoid arrest and prosecution and displaying only mild annoyance at the weak attempts Foyle makes to bring justice to him. The writer has Foyle play out a final scene with the American in which Foyle displays boldness and courage in the face of his own defeat in trying to bring this villain to justice. He lectures the American and vows to hunt him down no matter how long it takes.Parenthetically, there are two quick points that can be made about ""the American"": The portrayal is a brief reminiscence of ""the Ugly American"" theme of some years back, which has been waning, though more recently replaced by: ""the Quiet American."" If we generalise Foyle's little lecture, it might be said to communicate the more general theme: ""You (America) may be powerful now but one day you will get what's coming to you.""Now, contrast the portrayal of the American with that of the German spy, who is scripted as a man of character, integrity, good judgement with a love for his family and who, near the end of the episode, establishes a manly bond with Foyle in a quid pro quo in which he aids Foyle in his investigations for a promise by Foyle to contact the German's family and pass on his last words.Also, it is revealed that a relative, the wife of one of the locals, has aided the German in making shore.  The knowledge of this fact is revealed to her by Foyle in the presence of her husband who proceeds to physically strike her.  Since Mr. Horowitz creates a deliberately ambiguous situation as to the why the German has come to England, the brutality displayed by the husband not only fosters sympathy for the wife but also leads the audience to do two other things:  1) put a more  generous interpretation on the German's motive (perhaps he only was fleeing Germany and the Nazis); and therefore, 2) promote sympathy for the German himself.If Mr. Horowitz's German breaks some of our expectations, his American fits a ""popular"" stereotype - a less than admirable script in troubled times.Despite my disappointment (and I have never spoiled an ending in my reviews until now), I will continue to watch the Foyle's War series, not so much because the episodes are ""very good"" (they are ""good,"" in part for their originality) but because they have chosen a marvellous actor to play the role of Foyle and make the series better than it likely would be otherwise. I hope we receive better from Mr. Horowitz in future; we (and that includes Mr. Kitchen) certainly deserve better.Postscript:  After watching and reviewing another in this set, ""Among the Few,"" I chose not to watch any other of the Foyle's War episodes.

After viewing the first installment, I was really motivated to purchase the second installment.  If anything ""Foley's War 2"" is even better.  My main reasoning for the aforesaid appraisal is that to me, the characters in the series have, in the second installment, really established themselves with the writers helping each character to find ""his or her rightful niche"" in the story.  Added to this, the actors seem to be really ""settling"" into their roles giving fantastic and riveting performances. As I indicated before, Michael Kitchen (as inspector Christopher Foyle) is really an outstanding actor.  He is not the ""scene chewing"" variety but the kind of actor that can express volumes with his eyes or with just a subtle movement or gesture. In fact, all of the actors, in this presentation, are great!The stories, in ""Foyle's War 2"", are really engrossing. (The episode ""Funk Hole"" is particularly engrossing--I LOVED it!))

The Funk Hole is especially depressing and surprising, and has an ending that is believable and comes totally out of nowhere.

Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece. They outdid themselves. This ""War Years"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed. It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one. The combined perfection is ""jolly good show."" It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War."" You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England. His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two. I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot. Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile. Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines.Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions.

Let's just say my comments are observations and comments about what I like..Michael Kitchens is the star of this series and he handles it excellently delivering a very realistic portrayal of a high level police officer.  He is supported by Honeysuckle Weeks who also delivers an excellent performance time after time.  A number of excellent actors/actresses like Anthony Howell, Ellie Haddington and Julian Ovenden make appearances on this series and I haven't seen anyone who didn't hold up their part of the show.Foyle is a man who does his job and doesn't feel the need to advertise and/or glorify himself which makes him my kind of detective nor does the series feel the need to give him some kind of idiosyncrasy (Monk, for example).Of course one of the central themes of the series is Foyle's moral independence.  He maintains his own frame of reference and isn't buffeted by the wartime morality that others find no way to avoid.  He also exhibits a much greater willingness to accept others who don't conform to the very rigid morals of Great Britain of the 1940s.Each episode in the series features a number of threads that broaden the interest of the picture and yet the various threads don't make the story incomprehensible.I am looking forward to more episodes of Foyle's War as it moves into the Cold War and Foyle begins a second career with MI5.",5,A first rate production.,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1485,"[""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'reviewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'attempt', 'emulate', 'more', 'perceptive', 'reviewers', 'have', 'here', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'comments', 'are', 'observations', 'comments', 'what', 'like..Michael', 'Kitchens', 'star', 'series', 'excellently', 'delivering', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'high', 'level', 'police', 'officer', 'supported', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'who', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'time', 'time', 'number', 'excellent', 'actors/actresses', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'Ellie', 'Haddington', 'Julian', 'Ovenden', 'make', 'appearances', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'part', 'show.Foyle', 'man', 'who', 'job', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'advertise', 'and/or', 'glorify', 'kind', 'detective', 'series', 'feel', 'need', 'give', 'kind', 'idiosyncrasy', 'Monk', 'example', 'course', 'one', 'central', 'themes', 'series', 'Foyle', 'moral', 'independence', 'own', 'frame', 'reference', ""n't"", 'buffeted', 'wartime', 'morality', 'others', 'find', 'way', 'avoid', 'also', 'much', 'greater', 'willingness', 'accept', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'conform', 'very', 'rigid', 'morals', 'Great', 'Britain', '1940s.Each', 'episode', 'series', 'number', 'threads', 'broaden', 'interest', 'picture', 'yet', 'various', 'threads', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'story', 'incomprehensible.I', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'episodes', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Cold', 'War', 'Foyle', 'second', 'career', 'MI5']",N/A

824504,A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0,B00024JBAO,I. Westray,"[9, 11]","The overwhelming strength of the two Foyle's War series has been their acting. Michael Kitchen, at the moral and intellectual center of these shows, is superbly underplayed and satisfying. He's at the level of Alec Guinness in the old John LeCarre adapations ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Smiley's People."" His deftness and quiet intelligence are perfectly cast and thoroughly satisfying. The supporting cast, both the regulars and the guests, are equally ideal. When we're deeply curious about the secondary characters in a TV show, that's surprising. (Not many movies do that to me; I suppose ""Out of Africa"" with Kitchen's Barkley Cole would be an example of one.)The writing I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, these characters are allowed to struggle with moral ambiguity, and I respect that immensely. (It's interesting to read a few of the other Amazon reviews and find various people taking ""50 Ships"" as an anti-American tirade. The accusation is ludicrous. The character they're talking about is an individual, not the representative of Americans or middle-aged business magnates or any other demographic cohort you're feeling defensive about. That he should be tragically flawed is satisfying in the writing, not offensive. Let's say it this way: if you prefer public expressions of piety to actual moral struggle, you will find this episode unsettling, and apparently you'll cry ""prejudice."")My problem with the writing isn't the characterization, then, and it's certainly not the setting, which is lovely without being precious and which brings home the period in every adroit detail. No, it's the outrageously overwrought, overintricate plotting of the mysteries themselves. At least once in every episode there's a coincidental connection between one subplot and another that's downright hard to swallow. At the denouement of a program, I'll be soaking in the satisfying moment when Kitchen reveals his mind, and then I'll be distracted -- he didn't just connect that with that, did he? That's kind of... silly.But these are quibbles, and in some ways I think they're to do with the particular genre of mystery we're talking about. There's a sort of Agatha Christie skein of plotlines, here, and maybe I'm just not an Agatha Christia reader. I'd lean more toward a Brother Cadfael tone, which these shows do share, and a somewhat slower pace. I guess the combination of tone and plot feels just a measure artificial or contrived to me.The shows are wonderful, though, and I look forward to them. If this production company had been given a project like ""The Name of the Rose,"" we would have had something other than a rushing calamity from that movie. The qualities are all there: subtlety, beautiful casting, patient acting, a sense of dignity and human moral struggle tinged with tragic failing. If you appreciate those traits, you may enjoy this series enough to own it.",4,"Exceptional acting, somewhat overwrought plotting",1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2904,"['overwhelming', 'strength', 'two', 'Foyle', 'War', 'series', 'been', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'moral', 'intellectual', 'center', 'shows', 'superbly', 'underplayed', 'satisfying', 'level', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'old', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'adapations', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'Smiley', 'People', 'deftness', 'quiet', 'intelligence', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'supporting', 'cast', 'regulars', 'guests', 'are', 'equally', 'ideal', 'When', ""'re"", 'deeply', 'curious', 'secondary', 'characters', 'TV', 'show', 'surprising', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'suppose', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Kitchen', 'Barkley', 'Cole', 'would', 'be', 'example', 'one', 'writing', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'hand', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'struggle', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'respect', 'immensely', 'interesting', 'read', 'few', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'find', 'various', 'people', 'taking', '50', 'Ships', 'anti-American', 'tirade', 'accusation', 'ludicrous', 'character', ""'re"", 'talking', 'individual', 'not', 'representative', 'Americans', 'middle-aged', 'business', 'magnates', 'other', 'demographic', 'cohort', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'defensive', 'should', 'be', 'tragically', 'flawed', 'satisfying', 'writing', 'not', 'offensive', 'Let', 'say', 'way', 'prefer', 'public', 'expressions', 'piety', 'actual', 'moral', 'struggle', 'will', 'find', 'episode', 'unsettling', 'apparently', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'prejudice', 'problem', 'writing', ""n't"", 'characterization', 'then', 'certainly', 'not', 'setting', 'lovely', 'being', 'precious', 'home', 'period', 'adroit', 'detail', 'No', 'outrageously', 'overwrought', 'overintricate', 'plotting', 'mysteries', 'least', 'once', 'episode', 'coincidental', 'connection', 'one', 'subplot', 'downright', 'hard', 'swallow', 'denouement', 'program', ""'ll"", 'be', 'soaking', 'satisfying', 'moment', 'when', 'Kitchen', 'mind', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'distracted', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'connect', 'did', 'kind', 'silly.But', 'are', 'quibbles', 'ways', 'think', ""'re"", 'do', 'particular', 'genre', 'mystery', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sort', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'skein', 'plotlines', 'here', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'Agatha', 'Christia', 'reader', ""'d"", 'lean', 'more', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'tone', 'shows', 'do', 'share', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'pace', 'guess', 'combination', 'tone', 'plot', 'feels', 'just', 'measure', 'artificial', 'contrived', 'me.The', 'shows', 'are', 'wonderful', 'though', 'look', 'forward', 'production', 'company', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'project', 'Name', 'Rose', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'other', 'rushing', 'calamity', 'movie', 'qualities', 'are', 'there', 'subtlety', 'beautiful', 'casting', 'patient', 'acting', 'sense', 'dignity', 'human', 'moral', 'struggle', 'tinged', 'tragic', 'failing', 'appreciate', 'traits', 'may', 'enjoy', 'series', 'enough', 'own']",N/A

824516,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00024JBAO,John F. Rooney,"[3, 4]","In ""Fifty Ships"" Inspector Christopher Foyle has returned in episode one of Series 2, and as always he has his female uniformed driver, Sam, and Sergeant Milner as his loyal assistants. It's September of 1940, and the Second World War is not going well for Great Britain. America is still not in the war. Foyle is a civilian cop who has all the forces of war swirling around him. Sometimes he is at cross-swords with Military Intelligence, and because it's wartime, the civilian cop can't always win.Widower Foyle's sweetheart of twenty years before shows up, now in a marriage with two children. She says that she never loved her husband, and she wants to rekindle the old love flame with the inspector. Foyle's son is on duty with the RAF, and, of course, he's worried about him. Twenty-two year old Sam, as pretty as ever, gets bombed of her house and has no where to live in Hastings.Her landlady's valuables have been looted in the aftermath of the bombing, and some air raid wardens (member of the AFS, the Auxiliary Fire Service) are suspected. A photographer for a local paper is also suspected, and he turns out to be a crucial character in the story. Sergeant Milner offers a spare room to Sam while his wife is away, and this causes problems in his troubled marriage.A Nazi U-boat is off shore and receives a light signal from someone in the town, a traitor. A spy comes ashore, and a murder takes place on the beach. By a series of coincidences certain people have attended Oxford University at the same time, and they meet. A famous American inventor visits the local solicitor, and a local doctor is antagonistic toward him because America seems to be dragging its feet entering the War against the Nazis.This episode has a lot of disparate threads. The series benefits from good production values, a generous money outlay, strong characterization along with melodrama and suspense. Some things in the story are implausible and improbable, but the story is still a great mystery to savor.",5,Great Foyle Again,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2002,"['Fifty', 'Ships', 'Inspector', 'Christopher', 'Foyle', 'returned', 'episode', 'one', 'Series', '2', 'always', 'female', 'uniformed', 'driver', 'Sam', 'Sergeant', 'Milner', 'loyal', 'assistants', 'September', '1940', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'Great', 'Britain', 'America', 'still', 'not', 'war', 'Foyle', 'civilian', 'cop', 'who', 'forces', 'war', 'swirling', 'Sometimes', 'cross-swords', 'Military', 'Intelligence', 'wartime', 'civilian', 'cop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'win.Widower', 'Foyle', 'sweetheart', 'twenty', 'years', 'shows', 'up', 'now', 'marriage', 'two', 'children', 'never', 'loved', 'husband', 'rekindle', 'old', 'love', 'flame', 'inspector', 'Foyle', 'son', 'duty', 'RAF', 'course', 'worried', 'Twenty-two', 'year', 'old', 'Sam', 'as', 'pretty', 'ever', 'bombed', 'house', 'where', 'live', 'Hastings.Her', 'landlady', 'valuables', 'have', 'been', 'looted', 'aftermath', 'bombing', 'air', 'raid', 'wardens', 'member', 'AFS', 'Auxiliary', 'Fire', 'Service', 'are', 'suspected', 'photographer', 'local', 'paper', 'also', 'suspected', 'out', 'be', 'crucial', 'character', 'story', 'Sergeant', 'Milner', 'spare', 'room', 'Sam', 'wife', 'away', 'problems', 'troubled', 'marriage.A', 'Nazi', 'U-boat', 'shore', 'light', 'signal', 'someone', 'town', 'traitor', 'spy', 'ashore', 'murder', 'place', 'beach', 'series', 'coincidences', 'certain', 'people', 'have', 'attended', 'Oxford', 'University', 'same', 'time', 'meet', 'famous', 'American', 'inventor', 'local', 'solicitor', 'local', 'doctor', 'antagonistic', 'America', 'be', 'dragging', 'feet', 'entering', 'War', 'Nazis.This', 'episode', 'lot', 'disparate', 'threads', 'series', 'benefits', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'generous', 'money', 'outlay', 'strong', 'characterization', 'melodrama', 'suspense', 'things', 'story', 'are', 'implausible', 'improbable', 'story', 'still', 'great', 'mystery', 'savor']",N/A

824521,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00024JBAO,Joseph Haschka,"[101, 105]","I'd previously rated Series 1 of FOYLE'S WAR at four stars. I'm happy to report, after finishing the Series 2 discs, that the ongoing British telly miniseries has graduated to five stars. It's superb, and I'm desolate that I must wait until 2005 for the release of Series 3 that's airing now in the UK. (Of course, if I move to England ... Nah, the wife would never go for it.)Michael Kitchen is Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, who's been ordered to remain at his post as homicide investigator for Hastings and its environs; he'd much rather be doing his bit for King and Empire fighting the Nazis across the Channel. Indeed, his son Andrew (Julian Ovenden) is a flying officer with the RAF. The two other series regulars are Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), the army's Auxiliary Territorial Service enlistee assigned as his driver, and Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), Foyle's assistant inspector returned to home front duty after being wounded during the disastrous British invasion of Norway.The delight to be found in the four episodes of Series 2 is the underlying complexity of each plot, the tip of which is a murder being investigated by Foyle and Milner. Yet, even as the layers of the onion are peeled away, the viewer is still surprised at the intricacy of the solution, most of which is unraveled in the depths of Foyle's mind and revealed to the audience at the end, and which has ramifications that ripple far beyond the simple presence of a local corpse.As in Series 1, the storylines of 2 encompass so much more than a tawdry homicide or two: homosexuality in the RAF, collaboration between British Big Business and the Nazis, black market commerce in luxury food and petrol, and skullduggery by Franklin Roosevelt's personal emissary sent to negotiate the Lend Lease.My personal favorite episode is number four, ""Funk Hole"", wherein Foyle is relieved of his duties after being reported as having expressed seditious and defeatist statements while cowering in a London air raid shelter during a Luftwaffe bombing attack. The labyrinthine explanation for that was totally unexpected. Moreover, it looks like Sam and Andrew are to be an ""item"" - surely to be continued in Series 3. Indeed, at one point when Sam accompanies Andrew to a showing of ""Gone With the Wind"", we see her out of uniform, dressed in civvies, and with a smashing hairdo. Blimey, what a bird!FOYLE'S WAR is sumptuously fleshed out with period costumes, automobiles, hairstyles, and commercial brand names. This is first class, period entertainment.

824558,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B00024JBAO,"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","[1, 3]","I loveFoyle's War Series 1. I think it's some of the best TV out there. I had high expectations for season II, but unfortunately I felt a bit let down. First off, all of the things I loved about season I are largely still intact, including great characters, solid acting (especially Michael Kitchen), and very high production values. What deteriorated was the writing and plotting, which both seemed stale and in some cases just a re-hash of season I. Some of the episodes are too similar to those in season I, or include elements that just don't feel right in the show's larger context. I've tried to leave this review as free from spoilers as possible, but in some instances this was not entirely possible, so read at your own risk.The first episode ""50 Ships,"" has a complicated storyline that borders on implausible and includes a few too many cardboard cut-out characters for my taste, including a 'noble rouge' German spy, a ruthless scofflaw American businessman, and a an 'old ninny wife,' all in much too close proximity to one another. Without getting into plot details, the motive for the murder is tenuous at best, and baring a confession, there would be zero evidence to convict the culprit on. The ending also includes a strange and unnecessary lecture from Foyle, something that seems entirely out of character. Episode grade: C-""Among the Few,"" seeks to answer the question ""How often can Andrew Foyle get himself mixed up in a crime in just two seasons of Foyle's war?"" The answer apparently is 25% of the time, considering this is a large part of the plot in ""Among the Few"" as well as season I's episode ""Eagle Day."" (This is a general failing of the series; most of the crimes involve or happen around friends or acquaintances of Foyle or his family--this gets old quickly). There are other remarkable (or just lazy) similarities between the two episodes, which include: 1. One of the primary suspects in each crime is a skirt-chasing sleaze ball who misuses his position of authority to take varying levels of advantage of the young women under his command; 2. Both include as a major plot element a series of elaborate checks that must be circumvented for a  crime to take place (in ""Eagle Day"" the crime is theft of art and in ""Among the Few"" the crime is theft of fuel); 3. Both involve an 'inside man' plot line; 4. In both Andrew Foyle is suspected to be involved.Add to that a historically problematic approach to addressing the issue of homosexuality in the military (Which I should mention is a worthy topic to write stories about so long as they aren't reduced to preachy asides or treated with very poor historical accuracy). In addressing a pilot in the same RAF squadron as his son Andrew, Foyle both condones the character's sexuality (possibly forgivable) and indicates that said character should be willing to disclose his sexuality to his squadron mates (ridiculous at best in the historical context--more on that to follow) and then even goes so far as to chastise the character that he 'does his fellows a disservice' when the character states that they won't understand and that things would be even worse for him if he did; all of which is absolutely true given the context of a WWII fighter squadron full of alpha-dog pilots and a harsh military brass that at the time would have ejected him from military service in a matter of hours after he identified himself as homosexual.Even in the smaller context of Folye's character this conversation is forced and feels silly. Foyle to this point has never expressed anything but the most traditional of views on virtually all topics and has comported himself as a traditional English gentleman (who at that time period were sadly frequently bigoted). There is nothing to suggest that he is an idealist, an intellectual, or a libertarian. He is not a socialist, and does not at any previous point espouse liberal views. That he would support or not support homosexuality isn't really the issue; even if he did he would ABSOLUTELY know (as a long time policeman) that there is about a 0% chance that a self identified homosexual would be treated with anything but hatred and disgust by his fellow soldiers and commanding officers. However wrong that might be, Foyle's War is a PERIOD DRAMA and as such, CANNOT rewrite history to prove a point. When it does it is stooping to sermonizing, and fails to make an argument--instead it resorts to emotional arm twisting. The topic could have been much better handled. Episode Grade: DHappily, ""War Games,"" comes along just in time to divert the second series away from being a total disaster. The plot line is pretty good , and includes some very memorable scenes (particularly good is that between Simon Walker and Lucy Markham near the end). Only burdened by two more primary suspects that are friends or former friends of Foyle, War Games is fun, well done, and hits at some of the complex social issues of the day, like how to conduct business with honor in a time of war and what to do with individuals who are very valuable to the war effort but otherwise morally compromised. Episode grade: B+""The Funk Hole,"" is by far the best episode of Season II. Set at a private residence turned boarding house (aka hiding place) for the wealthy seeking solace from the bombings in London, it is a traditionally constructed 'who done it' with the appropriate ensemble of misanthropes, cowards, and those with secrets and those who can expose them. Paired together nicely with a plot involving stolen food supplies and infidelity, it is nuanced and quite a delicious little mystery. The silliness of some characters is offset by the tenaciousness of Foyle in both his quest to uncover the solution to several murders, as well as clear himself of false allegations that he committed sedition. We get to see more of Sam and Andrew, as well as Foyle at his logical best. Episode Grade: ASeries II is still reasonably good TV. It's just not fantastic like Season I. Still very watchable, and easily recommendable if you enjoyed the first season. 3/5 Stars.",3,A step down from season 1,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,6076,"['loveFoyle', 'War', 'Series', '1', 'think',

824564,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B00024JBAO,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[0, 0]","*Foyle's War* potently conveys the ambiance of classic British Golden Age whodunits but the four episodes in this set (as well as all the others) are notably more complex and mature. Due largely to the much-skilled efforts of screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, these yarns are also very well-told.The World War II southern English countryside, intermittently dotted with sleepy little hamlets filled with interesting characters, provides the backdrop for the stories. A common theme of these episodes includes the fact that Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle often finds himself conflicted in pursuing the various perpetrators of civilian crime, having to balance that actuality against the overall war effort -- his criminals are frequently patriots.Not all of Foyle's cases conclude all that tidily while others seem to terminate in a particularly gratifying manner. His two assistants, Sergeant Milner [Anthony Howell] and his driver ""Sam"" [Honeysuckle Weeks] are usually a big help to Foyle but sometimes they make an occasional misstep. In other words, this series corrals quite a lot of realism.*Fifty Ships* -- Sam's boarding house is demolished by a bomb from a Flying Pencil (the German Dornier Do 17 bomber) and her roommate is instantly killed. During the chaos some of the emergency fire personnel loot the old landlady's valuable coin collection and jewelry, but a local newspaper photographer also falls under suspicion. This theft is but one of a series of similar incidents.Foyle attends a dinner party honoring an American Emissary, formerly educated in England, who carries with him the prospect of badly needed war aid for England. But before dinner is served the Emissary gets a visit from one of the locals, a man with an obvious issue to discuss with him, and who subsequently hikes to the nearby coastline where witnesses spot a German U-boat being signaled.A Home Guard Colonel arrests a stranger who has run inland from the sea and who is suspected of being a German saboteur. While searching for the man's boat, the local who had come to see the Emissary is found dead on the beach, an apparent case of suicide.If that were not enough, Sergeant Milner's wife catches him in a compromising circumstance with Sam. Foyle has to tie up all the loose ends. Don't bother trying to guess the ending because you'll fail. Directed by Giles Foster.*Among the Few* -- [September, 1940] DCI Foyle and Sam are inadvertently thrown into the hot vehicle pursuit of a petty criminal -- the latter is killed when he crashes his truck, loaded with barrels of black market fuel, and the barrels explode. With Sergeant Milner as her contact, Foyle reluctantly allows Sam to go undercover at the local fuel depot in an attempt to discover the identity of the unknown profiteer.Foyle's son, Andrew, a top RAF Spitfire pilot, competes with a fellow pilot and close friend in shooting down German aircraft. Both men are involved with local girls who work at the fuel depot but this news is kept from Foyle for a time.An Irish saboteur constructs a large bomb and confers with a fellow agent on their prospective target which is, of course, the fuel depot.All the fuel depot personnel, along with the RAF pilots, spend their evenings socializing and drinking at The Flamingo Club which is owned by a suspected profiteer, the employer of the man killed in the truck crash. When Sam is confronted in the club by the Irish saboteur, Foyle's son takes him on which sparks an all-out brawl.One of the lady fuel truck drivers involved in the black market fuel scheme threatens to expose a secret -- she is subsequently found dead in her apartment. Foyle has to contend with this complex series of events.This fast-paced episode was directed by Jeremy Silberston.*War Games* -- [October, 1940] The chief magnate of a large food-producing company covertly generates an agreement with the Nazis, purely motivated by the notable profits to be had regardless of who wins the war. His nefarious son is moved by more ideological enthusiasms. Their ethical secretary opts to report the scoundrels to the authorities but she soon plummets to her death from a window near the top of the company headquarters building and the police rule it as an accident.Two young farmers, a girl and her ex-convict brother, face financial difficulties until the brother is recruited by his former attorney, a German by birth, to crack the food company's safe (at the magnate's country estate) and to return with any documents that he finds. The attorney assures the lad that even when the crime is ultimately discovered, it will go unreported due to the compromising nature of the documents. The young thief is wounded by the magnate's vicious son as he makes a hurried escape across the lawn after being detected. Due to a local warden, the break-in does in fact get reported but the victims lie to Foyle as they assert that nothing was stolen.Foyle is recruited to referee a war game between British regulars (who play the role of German invaders) and the Home Guard. An assassin exploits this opportunity to carry out a convenient murder -- two Home Guard members come under Sergeant Milner's scrutiny. Foyle's former Sergeant, now an Army Captain, is also one of the chief suspects.A somewhat frivolous sub-plot of youth war salvage collection provides comic relief -- Foyle places Sam in charge of the kids' diligent war efforts.This episode features a scenic farm location (a victory garden), an atmospheric old church, and an impressive manorial estate. Directed by Giles Foster.*The Funk Hole* -- [October, 1940] London reels under the conflagration caused by German bombing raids. A plainclothes police officer cowering in a bomb shelter hysterically informs his fellow occupants that Great Britain has already lost the war and that the government is concealing this actuality from the masses.In Hailsham, a gang is caught breaking into a food depot and just after loading their boxes of loot into a truck, patrolling Home Guard wardens fire on them, critically wounding one of the thieves. A mother reports her son as missing - he turns out to be the wounded thief... who dies. Sergeant Milner follows up on the case by visiting the young man's employer who operates a *Funk Hole*, (a hiding spot of sorts for elite persons who are trying to evade any involvement in the war.)Foyle visits his son, Anthony, in the hospital after he's injured as a result of a forced landing of his Spitfire into the water. Then trouble arises as Foyle is falsely accused of being the policeman who made the seditious rant in the London bomb shelter, a nuisance which disrupts his various case investigations.A not uncommon theme for *Foyle's War* episodes, the gnawing issue of special privileges for the rich during wartime, adds to the compelling drama in this entry. Directed by Jeremy Silberston.With this set, you get four nicely-packaged discs, 100 minutes per episode (per disc), plus a few special features. The aspect ratio is 16:9 widescreen, not rated. The set was produced in 2003 by Acorn Media. While this particular episode collection is not quite as compelling asFoyle's War: Set 1 (The German Woman / The White Feather / A Lesson In Murder / Eagle Day), it's still first-class and well worth

824565,A1CIZ90FFOZTLM,B00024JBAO,phantomfan,"[38, 38]","I awaited Series 2 on pins and needles, and putting it mildly I was not disappointed. What began as a well-conceived, complex war/mystery/drama series has evolved into a masterpiece. You could search the entire history of the Academy Awards and never find more gripping performances or solid screenwriting. And with Masterpiece Theater (Series 1) and now Mystery!, DCS Foyle is poised to become almost as popular in the US as he is in his native Britain.Each episode is brilliantly written, with many plots and sub-plots that end up tying together as expertly as a Celtic Maze. Although in three cases out of four the identity of the murderer is not difficult to guess (and one is blatantly obvious), the fun, as always, is trying to unravel why.On top of top-notch mystery plots, you have the moral complexity of a world at war, when right and wrong are not so easily catagorized into neat little boxes. DCS Foyle, with all his moral uprightness, finds himself in each episode faced with dilemmas that - thank God - most of us will never face. And he faces them with integrity and equanimity that is almost non-existent in today's world. Kudos to Anthony Horowitz.Fifty Ships is one of the two best episodes in the lot, primarily due to a magnificent performance by guest actor Henry Goodman. You simply can't take your eyes off him, and I have never seen a more convincing American performance from a British actor. He absoluately nailed that Chicago accent, when most Americans aren't even aware that there is one. To call this episode anti-American is simply foolishness. It is a scrupulously accurate PERIOD drama, told from an exclusively English perspective. Yes, the American in this episode is characterized as brutish, brash, and evil, but why not? The worst villians of this series are English; just watch the episode War Games if you want proof. To imagine that Mr. Horowitz had any kind of anti-American agenda is practically libelous.Fans of Sam (and who isn't?) will especially enjoy Among the Few, in which she gets to prove her mettle by going undercover at a fuel depot to spy out the criminals who are stealing fuel. Foyle's son Andrew loses a bit of his paragon-like perfection, which is to the series' credit. The resolution is a little disappointing, but the rest more than makes up for it.War Games is perhaps the most morally complex episode of the lot, and although it is not hard to guess whodunit, working out who's a good guy and who's a bad guy and why makes this one the most thought-provoking. Stellar performance by Alan Howard.The Funk Hole is my favorite episode of Series 2, and the best mystery of the four. Another stellar performance by Nicholas Farrell.The acting (Michael Kitchen defies superlatives), score, direction, and stunning scenery are magnificent - worthy of anything that is being made for the big or small screen on either side of the Atlantic.The four regulars - Foyle, Milner, Sam, and Andrew - are perfectly consistent, and evolving, as people do in life. Milner especially is coming into his own after a reluctant start, and becoming a first-rate detective. If there are some unresolved issues between him and his wife, it is not a flaw in the series - merely a promise that more is to come.

Their interplay really makes the show.  It just isn't enough (for me) to compensate for many major shortcomings.As other reviewers have pointed out, the show weaves contemporary (early WWII) social issues into its plots.  Not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be EXTREMELY off-putting.  Why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area?  Apparently it's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars?!?  Worst of all is Foyle's out-of-character sermonizing, which sometimes takes weird turns, as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he'll be on his case when the war's over.  Not only does this make no sense in view of Foyle's previous instructions, but I interpret the capitalist villain's bemused expression to mean ""Thanks for the tip, copper, I'll be getting off THIS flight in extradition-free Ireland!!!""  D'oh!  Well, carry on, inspector!The show's designers are also a bit careless with PHYSICAL period details.  Usually this is pretty minor stuff, but at least once produces a howler.  In the FIFTY_SHIPS episode, after a lengthy sermon on the CRUCIAL importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of U.S. military equipment ('even though it's just moldy American rubbish'), we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a U.S.-made C-47 (cutting edge in 1940) in RAF colours!!!As other reviewers have also pointed out, the stories are relentlessly pc.  I have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services; I'm sure that's true of all armies.  But after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman, prejudiced patriot, and cowardly bourgeois I switched to Sherlock!The unforgivable sin, however, is the cheesy plotting.  It's not just that it's formulaic and predictable, but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow Foyle to 'detect.'  Do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until Foyle pulled a Columbo with the tea bag?  Is there a Gosford Park near this police station?In conclusion, there're FAR superior Brit and, yes, U.S. detective shows out there.  If you like it pc try Morse; if you're into period try Poirot, Wimsey, or the Hickson Marple.

However, watching the DVDs of all series is preferable if one wants to see the unexpurgated episodes. Here are the first telecast dates for series 1-4 of Foyle's war:series 1: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2002, US in Feb. 2003 (on Masterpiece theater, with Russell Baker introducing)series 2: telecast UK Nov.-Dec. 2003, US in July-Aug. 2004 (on Mystery)series 3: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2004, US in Sep.-Oct. 2005 (on Mystery)series 4: was filmed in spring 2005, will be telecast in 2006The PBS broadcasts in the US are edited for a 90-minute period, which includes the Mystery (or Masterpiece theater) opening-closing sequences, between-program promos, etc. This means that each episode is really only 85 minutes long at best. Region 1 DVDs (U.S., Canada), in contrast, are about 100 minutes per episode, as are the region 2 DVDs (Europe--see www.amazon.co.uk): specific values for the 4 episodes on series 2 are (for region 1) 98.5, 97.9, 98.3, 98.3 minutes. Thus in the U.S. for the proper, more nuanced episode watching Foyle's war on DVD is essential and preferable to viewing it on PBS.Note: In a 28 Sep. 2004 interview with creator-writer Anthony Horowitz, he was asked: ""Do you realise that the show is edited to pieces when it's shown on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the states?"" Horowitz replied: ""Yes we're very sorry about that. It's not something I'd choose to do. It's American networking. I'd advise all American fans to get their hands on the English DVDs to see them in full."" I note here that American fans need only get the *American* DVDs to see the episodes in full.

While the show is still interesting, the focus seems to be shifting away from the cases and focusing more on the characters.  This is fine in some respects (especially if you enjoy character-driven shows) but not as great in others (it removes the episode's ability to stand on its own, for one, and also does cut back on the mystery portion).  Overall I'm still enjoying them, just not as much as I continue to enjoy Midsomer Murders.Fifty Ships - This is my least favorite episode to date - the only interesting bit is Sam's situation, but it's overshadowed by uninteresting and fairly unimportant plot-lines (Foyle's first love, for example).  The murder and the reasoning behind it are completely left-field, and the ending is bizarre and, while not completely unbelievable, disappointing.Among the Few - And a return to the lessons!  This entire episode (aside from the actual petrol thefts) is completely ludicrous.  It's as if they went out of their way to find a politically correct lesson to ram down our throats to show us how amazing Foyle is.  Sam, again, is a bit of a bright spot in this episode with her undercover work.  Otherwise, it is quite disappointing and entirely predictable.War Games - This episode is much more fun and interesting than the previous two in this season.  It's a return to the more straightforward war-time mysteries, and though it is, again, a wee bit predictable (especially with the children), it's still interesting and moves at a good clip.The Funk Hole - Milner gets his chance to shine!  Sure, it might be at the expense of Foyle's reputation, but still.  It was nice to see the sidekick get center stage, even if it is just temporarily.  This is another one of those 'everything's connected in a very odd way' episodes, which keeps your attention and makes you wonder what will happen next.
