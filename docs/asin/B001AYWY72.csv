Her goal with her pregnancy DVDs is to empower women to do something good for themeselve. Exersice shouldnt be about shrinking  down to a cookie cutter body image, it should be about obtaining a healthy body.I like that she designed her system to accomadate the needs and restrictions for each trimester. Also, Reece has made it so that you can opt to do brief work outs. If you are looking for a strnous work out, look in to your self to figure out why? Your weight and your pant size should be the last thing you are worried about while pregnant. Focus on gaining a healthy weight (around 25 to 35 pounds) and concentrate on keeping your body strong to sustain your growing belly. Understand that the media tells us that we need to get thin fast after our pregnancy, and this should not be the case. It takes a year for our bodies to recuperate after giving birth. Focus on getting your body back together, not getting your body back into jeans.",4,authenic dvd,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1036,"['one', 'time', 'Atlete', 'Gabrielle', 'Reece', 'always', 'been', 'role', 'HEALTH', 'goal', 'pregnancy', 'DVDs', 'empower', 'women', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'themeselve', 'Exersice', 'shouldnt', 'be', 'shrinking', 'down', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'body', 'image', 'should', 'be', 'obtaining', 'healthy', 'body.I', 'designed', 'system', 'accomadate', 'needs', 'restrictions', 'trimester', 'Also', 'Reece', 'made', 'so', 'can', 'opt', 'do', 'brief', 'work', 'outs', 'are', 'looking', 'strnous', 'work', 'out', 'look', 'self', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'weight', 'pant', 'size', 'should', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'are', 'worried', 'pregnant', 'Focus', 'gaining', 'healthy', 'weight', '25', '35', 'pounds', 'concentrate', 'keeping', 'body', 'strong', 'sustain', 'growing', 'belly', 'Understand', 'media', 'need', 'get', 'thin', 'fast', 'pregnancy', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'year', 'bodies', 'recuperate', 'giving', 'birth', 'Focus', 'getting', 'body', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'getting', 'body', 'back', 'jeans']",Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy
1169027,A1M6LNYKTY44D1,B001AYWY72,"Jessy Ko ""Mommy Shopper""","[3, 4]","I bought her shorter prenatal video first, and bought this one to replace it because it is the same but with some additional workouts, third trimester workout, and postnatal workout...So It is pretty much the same so I am placing a similar review here... (Hey, it can't be bad I am paying for almost the same video twice!)First I must say I read a lot of reviews addressing how great Gabby is, how they didn't like her trainer, or the background, or the quality, or buying the ball, weights and band. On the equipment, Ball $2 at Tjmax, the band and light weights $4.50 at Play It Again Sports. This is 258 minutes of video for $9.99, still a great deal with the added $6.50 in equipment. The rest who cares, it's just cosmetic. On the actual video, the warm ups and cool downs are great, I use them to augment some of my other videos that don't have good warm ups or cool downs. Also if I am really short on time in the morning, I just do the warm up and go, or in the evening I will just do the cool down, it is better then nothing. The workouts are simple, quick, and fast pace, which is why I bought them, for days when I don't have a lot of time. If one of the workouts isn't enough for you just repeat it as a circuit, or pause the video and do extra reps of each exercise. I do not recommend ever doing a workout that isn't for your trimester and month of pregnancy. I really liked that the workouts are completely different for each month of your trimester for the first two trimesters, you can really get board of the same workout. The exercises are good, safe, and challenging, most of them are different from all the other videos I have reviewed. I am also very happy to finally have safe abdominal work explained for the second trimester, such as splinting your abs.Also a lot of workout videos don't have a specific third trimester workout and I am glad to find one that does, with my last pregnancy I ended up quitting all workouts except walking at that point, because your body really slows you down and everything I did before that point was just to much.If you like this video you might also like to trySummer Sanders' Prenatal Workoutit has a little more cardio but has a similar workout style.",5,Content 2,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2213,"['bought', 'shorter', 'prenatal', 'video', 'first', 'bought', 'one', 'replace', 'same', 'additional', 'workouts', 'third', 'trimester', 'workout', 'postnatal', 'workout', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'am', 'placing', 'similar', 'review', 'here', 'Hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'am', 'paying', 'almost', 'same', 'video', 'twice', 'First', 'must', 'say', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'addressing', 'how', 'great', 'Gabby', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'trainer', 'background', 'quality', 'buying', 'ball', 'weights', 'band', 'equipment', 'Ball', '2', 'Tjmax', 'band', 'light', 'weights', '4.50', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sports', '258', 'minutes', 'video', '9.99', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'added', '6.50', 'equipment', 'rest', 'who', 'just', 'cosmetic', 'actual', 'video', 'warm', 'ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'are', 'great', 'use', 'augment', 'other', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'warm', 'ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'Also', 'am', 'really', 'short', 'time', 'morning', 'just', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'go', 'evening', 'will', 'just', 'do', 'cool', 'down', 'better', 'then', 'nothing', 'workouts', 'are', 'simple', 'quick', 'fast', 'pace', 'why', 'bought', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'one', 'workouts', ""n't"", 'enough', 'just', 'repeat', 'circuit', 'video', 'do', 'extra', 'reps', 'exercise', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'ever', 'doing', 'workout', ""n't"", 'trimester', 'month', 'pregnancy', 'really', 'liked', 'workouts', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'month', 'trimester', 'first', 'two', 'trimesters', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'board', 'same', 'workout', 'exercises', 'are', 'good', 'safe', 'challenging', 'most', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'videos', 'have', 'reviewed', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'happy', 'finally', 'have', 'safe', 'abdominal', 'work', 'explained', 'second', 'trimester', 'such', 'splinting', 'abs.Also', 'lot', 'workout', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'specific', 'third', 'trimester', 'workout', 'am', 'glad', 'find', 'one', 'last', 'pregnancy', 'ended', 'up', 'quitting', 'workouts', 'walking', 'point', 'body', 'really', 'down', 'everything', 'did', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'much.If', 'video', 'might', 'also', 'like', 'trySummer', 'Sanders', 'Prenatal', 'Workoutit', 'little', 'more', 'cardio', 'similar', 'workout', 'style']",Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy
1169028,A2NMVCFMC8F1DW,B001AYWY72,MelissaLynn,"[1, 1]","About me: I am 7 months along and work out daily.  I consider myself (pre-pregnancy) a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser.  About the dvd:  Some reviewers have complained that you need a lot of equipment for this workout, but as a pretty committed home exerciser, I already had everything.  I do agree they should allow more time for set-up between exercises (maybe 20 minute express workouts instead of 15?)  When her trainer is holding onto her resistance band, I am looking for something that I can anchor mine to that won't move.  My desk and my coffee table didn't work- both moved.  They are already on to the next move while I haven't completed one rep.  After a few uses I have been able to plan ahead for these things and actually execute the workout, which I now find (after all this) isn't even challenging.  I bought this because it was rated advanced and I don't agree that it is.  My heart rate NEVER got up, whereas it typically would moving quickly from exercise to exercise in a weight training routine.  Most of the exercises are adequate, but nothing special, and I find that there is too much chatter between Gabrielle and her trainer.  With the other problems already outlined combined with the low challenge, this dvd wasn't a good purchase for me- so far.  I am holding out hope that I can find use for the post-natal segments once my baby arrives.",3,It's Ok,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,1377,"['am', '7', 'months', 'work', 'out', 'daily', 'consider', 'pre-pregnancy', 'high', 'intermediate/low', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'dvd', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'need', 'lot', 'equipment', 'workout', 'pretty', 'committed', 'home', 'exerciser', 'already', 'had', 'everything', 'do', 'should', 'allow', 'more', 'time', 'set-up', 'exercises', 'maybe', '20', 'minute', 'express', 'workouts', 'instead', '15', 'When', 'trainer', 'holding', 'resistance', 'band', 'am', 'looking', 'something', 'can', 'anchor', 'mine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'move', 'My', 'desk', 'coffee', 'table', 'did', ""n't"", 'work-', 'moved', 'are', 'already', 'next', 'move', 'have', ""n't"", 'completed', 'one', 'rep.', 'few', 'uses', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'plan', 'ahead', 'things', 'actually', 'execute', 'workout', 'now', 'find', ""n't"", 'even', 'challenging', 'bought', 'was', 'rated', 'advanced', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'heart', 'rate', 'NEVER', 'got', 'up', 'typically', 'would', 'moving', 'quickly', 'exercise', 'exercise', 'weight', 'training', 'routine', 'Most', 'exercises', 'are', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'special', 'find', 'too', 'much', 'chatter', 'Gabrielle', 'trainer', 'other', 'problems', 'already', 'outlined', 'combined', 'low', 'challenge', 'dvd', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'purchase', 'me-', 'so', 'far', 'am', 'holding', 'out', 'hope', 'can', 'find', 'use', 'post-natal', 'segments', 'baby']",Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy
1169029,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B001AYWY72,Midwest Book Review,"[4, 5]","Created by Gabrielle Reece during and after her pregnancy with the help of certified personal trainer Mike Monroe, and approved by OBGYN Vivian Dickerson, The Complete Fit & Healthy Pregnancy Workout is a DVD of twelve fifteen-minute workouts, three for each trimester of pregnancy and three to help trim down after giving birth. A few pieces of inexpensive exercise equipment are recommended to tap the full potential of The Complete Fit & Healthy Pregnancy Workout: no more than an exercise ball, fitness band, and small hand weights. The primary focus is on strengthening and stretching moves, ideal keeping one's muscles strong and ready to reclaim one's figure. With the caveat that any expectant mother should consult her doctor before undertaking an exercise regimen, The Complete Fit & Healthy Pregnancy Workout is an excellent choice for expectant or aspiring mothers, and also highly recommended as a baby shower gift! 258 minutes, color.",5,An excellent choice for expectant or aspiring mothers,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,948,"['Created', 'Gabrielle', 'Reece', 'pregnancy', 'help', 'certified', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Mike', 'Monroe', 'approved', 'OBGYN', 'Vivian', 'Dickerson', 'Complete', 'Fit', 'Healthy', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'twelve', 'fifteen-minute', 'workouts', 'three', 'trimester', 'pregnancy', 'three', 'help', 'trim', 'down', 'giving', 'birth', 'few', 'pieces', 'inexpensive', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'are', 'recommended', 'tap', 'full', 'potential', 'Complete', 'Fit', 'Healthy', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'more', 'exercise', 'ball', 'fitness', 'band', 'small', 'hand', 'weights', 'primary', 'focus', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'moves', 'ideal', 'keeping', 'one', 'muscles', 'strong', 'ready', 'reclaim', 'one', 'figure', 'caveat', 'expectant', 'mother', 'should', 'consult', 'doctor', 'undertaking', 'exercise', 'regimen', 'Complete', 'Fit', 'Healthy', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'excellent', 'choice', 'expectant', 'aspiring', 'mothers', 'also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'baby', 'shower', 'gift', '258', 'minutes', 'color']",Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy
1169030,A11DOCIF2JJ90O,B001AYWY72,Sharon Bayliss,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this DVD throughout my pregnancy because it was challenging enough to get my heart rate up and really work my muscles.  Also, the nine completely distinct workout routines helped keep me from getting bored.  The only downside is that the exercises require many props (stability ball, weights, chair, fitness bands).  If you don't already have these props (especially the ball and weights), you will not benefit from this DVD because there are no modifications shown for those without props.",3,"Challenging, but with lots of props",1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,500,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'pregnancy', 'was', 'challenging', 'enough', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'really', 'work', 'muscles', 'Also', 'nine', 'completely', 'distinct', 'workout', 'routines', 'helped', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored', 'only', 'downside', 'exercises', 'require', 'many', 'props', 'stability', 'ball', 'weights', 'chair', 'fitness', 'bands', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'props', 'especially', 'ball', 'weights', 'will', 'not', 'benefit', 'DVD', 'are', 'modifications', 'shown', 'props']",Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy
