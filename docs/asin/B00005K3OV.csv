And, to his credit, director Allan Arkush has done it twice; first with &quot;Rock 'n' Roll High School&quot; - quite probably the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made - and again fifteen years later with &quot;Shake, Rattle, and Rock.&quot;  Is it great art?  Naw, but it's fun.  Be sure to watch for original &quot;Rock 'n' Roll High School&quot; stars Mary Woronov, P.J. Soles, and Dey Young playing their &quot;RnRHS&quot; characters' mothers.",4,Fun little movie,1029888000,"08 21, 2002",2002,559,"['Once', 'while', 'someone', 'get', 'handle', 'spirit', 'early', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'movies', ""'50s"", 'credit', 'director', 'Allan', 'Arkush', 'done', 'twice', 'first', 'quot', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'quot', 'quite', 'probably', 'greatest', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'again', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'quot', 'Shake', 'Rattle', 'Rock.', 'quot', 'great', 'art', 'Naw', 'fun', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'original', 'quot', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'quot', 'stars', 'Mary', 'Woronov', 'P.J', 'Soles', 'Dey', 'Young', 'playing', 'quot', 'RnRHS', 'quot', 'characters', 'mothers']","Shake, Rattle and Rock!"

Shake, Rattle and Rock! reminds me of a toned-down Grease with it's doo-wop songs and group of characters. A small town is taken back by rock-n-roll music. The teens love it, along with a radio tv show host (Howie Mandell), but the parents despise it. Especially Susan Doyle's (Renee) mother and her group of friends.The characters in this movie are great and ultimately fit into the time era. There's your group of kids who have a band (Renee Zellwegger, Patricia Childress, and Max Perlich), the radio tv host dj (Howie Mandell), the bad boy (John Doe), and a group of young black girls (Latanyia Baldwin, Necia Bray, Josina Elder, &amp; Wendi Williams) trying to make it big in a racial music business. The acting was very good. Especially that given by lead actress Renee Zellwegger. She is so awesome.Shake, Rattle and Rock! is a great movie, and your 90 minutes will not be wasted.",4,Renee Zellwegger Is Awesome,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,940,"['came', 'little', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Shake', 'Rattle', 'Rock', 'toned-down', 'Grease', 'doo-wop', 'songs', 'group', 'characters', 'small', 'town', 'taken', 'back', 'rock-n-roll', 'music', 'teens', 'love', 'radio', 'tv', 'show', 'host', 'Howie', 'Mandell', 'parents', 'despise', 'Especially', 'Susan', 'Doyle', 'Renee', 'mother', 'group', 'friends.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'ultimately', 'fit', 'time', 'era', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'band', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'Patricia', 'Childress', 'Max', 'Perlich', 'radio', 'tv', 'host', 'dj', 'Howie', 'Mandell', 'bad', 'boy', 'John', 'Doe', 'group', 'young', 'black', 'girls', 'Latanyia', 'Baldwin', 'Necia', 'Bray', 'Josina', 'Elder', 'amp', 'Wendi', 'Williams', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'racial', 'music', 'business', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Especially', 'given', 'lead', 'actress', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'so', 'awesome.Shake', 'Rattle', 'Rock', 'great', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'wasted']","Shake, Rattle and Rock!"
