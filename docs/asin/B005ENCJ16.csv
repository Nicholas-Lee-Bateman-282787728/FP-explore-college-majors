I love gutsy, political, deep movies and thougfht from reading reviews this would not be bad.  A giggle of a different sort.  The only joke was the one on me thinking this would be good.  Thanks to the industry for making the movie but more omph would be good.ThanksJordyn",1,Unhappy Customer!,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,360,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'light', 'weight', 'cant', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'disappointed', 'love', 'gutsy', 'political', 'deep', 'movies', 'thougfht', 'reading', 'reviews', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'giggle', 'different', 'sort', 'only', 'joke', 'was', 'one', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Thanks', 'industry', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'omph', 'would', 'be', 'good.ThanksJordyn']",Unhappy Birthday

1456889,A1NSDP9YZXLMDX,B005ENCJ16,Russell S,"[0, 0]","I was very torn with the number of stars for this movie. I love my British films and maybe I expected too much but it is really and okay movie. Kind of predictable and kind of dull at the beginning. It really took a long time to get to the point. Pacing is one thing but let it flow. The idea of the tidal island was very cool. the performances were okay but I did like David Paisley, he seemed to give the best performance. I won't say too much because I don't want to give anything away but give it a shot. it is really okay.",3,Give it a go,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,527,"['was', 'very', 'torn', 'number', 'stars', 'movie', 'love', 'British', 'films', 'maybe', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'okay', 'movie', 'Kind', 'predictable', 'kind', 'dull', 'beginning', 'really', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'point', 'Pacing', 'one', 'thing', 'let', 'flow', 'idea', 'tidal', 'island', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'performances', 'were', 'okay', 'did', 'like', 'David', 'Paisley', 'seemed', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'give', 'shot', 'really', 'okay']",Unhappy Birthday
1456890,A30TBUUJH28S1V,B005ENCJ16,Todd W. Hellems,"[5, 7]","This unassuming and brow-stitching flick set me up with seemingly uninteresting, moderately attractive young characters only to leave me creeped-out and using too many adverbs in this review. I wouldn't call this a psychological thriller but I will note that it disturbed me in an insidiously head-shrinking way (there goes another adverb). There are no real shock moments until the end but there are tons of behaviors that I didn't expect and couldn't decide how to interpret; therein lies the power of ""Unhappy Birthday"". That power fizzled when the ending turned out to be convoluted, ""jumping"" from nowhere with ****** ******** and ***********. I'm leaving these descriptions partially omitted (replaced with asterisks) because they might actually spoil the end for some viewers. Watch the film and enjoy the understated strangeness.",4,"Quietly, Satisfyingly Disturbing But With An Unbelievable Ending",1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,837,"['unassuming', 'brow-stitching', 'flick', 'set', 'seemingly', 'uninteresting', 'moderately', 'attractive', 'young', 'characters', 'only', 'leave', 'creeped-out', 'using', 'too', 'many', 'adverbs', 'review', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'will', 'note', 'disturbed', 'insidiously', 'head-shrinking', 'way', 'adverb', 'are', 'real', 'shock', 'moments', 'end', 'are', 'tons', 'behaviors', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'how', 'interpret', 'power', 'Unhappy', 'Birthday', 'power', 'fizzled', 'when', 'ending', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'convoluted', 'jumping', 'nowhere', '******', '********', '***********', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'descriptions', 'partially', 'omitted', 'replaced', 'asterisks', 'might', 'actually', 'spoil', 'end', 'viewers', 'Watch', 'film', 'enjoy', 'understated', 'strangeness']",Unhappy Birthday
1456891,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005ENCJ16,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 3]","Yes this is a sexy, thriller, horror, gay themed road movie that ends on a spooky Scottish Island that is cut off by tidal flows. Sadie and Rich are partners she wants a baby, he keeps trying, but is firing blanks. He is also seeing Jonny on the side, his best friend who only cares so long as he keeps firing. They are all off for a party weekend on the above mentioned island.Only big surprise is that Rick (Holby City's David Paisley - he will never live that down) has found Sadie's (Christine de Vallee - never been in Holby City but had an unscheduled stay in A and E once) long lost sister and family. Meanwhile the tide comes in and cuts them off before they have a chance to visit `Amen Island'. So they go to a Bed and Breakfast for some much needed sex.The following day they make it to this island and any sane person would have skedaddled straight away - even without the scary music, which is a constant by the way, as all of the inhabitants are weird. Even the scarecrow has been crucified. They do have some more sex though so all is far from lost.This is one of those modern horror types that feels it has to trowel on the frights and it keeps reminding you that bad things are gonna happen with the music, the constant shots of the incoming tide, shots of crows, cries of crows and the dysfunctional bunch of in breds on the island. There is also quite a lot of sign posting and some pretty flabby plot holes.That said there are some pretty good performances especially from Mr Paisley - well he was on the BBC you know. And most of the production values are high. I think that writers and producers Mark Harriott and Mike Mathews just tried to shoe horn in too much and that took away from the film rather than adding to it. Still I think it kept me entertained and is far from being the worst film ever but not quite four stars but more than a solid three. If in doubt get it on a rental, you will not be wanting to see it again as it trades on the scares and `twists' and sex and the crow shots and scary bits - I think you get it.",3,Over sexed Threesome get into some Bother on Remote Scottish Island!,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,2052,"['Yes', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'horror', 'gay', 'themed', 'road', 'movie', 'spooky', 'Scottish', 'Island', 'cut', 'off', 'tidal', 'flows', 'Sadie', 'Rich', 'are', 'partners', 'baby', 'trying', 'firing', 'blanks', 'also', 'seeing', 'Jonny', 'side', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'firing', 'are', 'party', 'weekend', 'above', 'mentioned', 'island.Only', 'big', 'surprise', 'Rick', 'Holby', 'City', 'David', 'Paisley', 'will', 'never', 'live', 'down', 'found', 'Sadie', 'Christine', 'Vallee', 'never', 'been', 'Holby', 'City', 'had', 'unscheduled', 'stay', 'A', 'E', 'once', 'long', 'lost', 'sister', 'family', 'Meanwhile', 'tide', 'cuts', 'off', 'have', 'chance', 'visit', 'Amen', 'Island', 'go', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'much', 'needed', 'sex.The', 'following', 'day', 'make', 'island', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'skedaddled', 'straight', 'away', 'even', 'scary', 'music', 'constant', 'way', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'weird', 'Even', 'scarecrow', 'been', 'crucified', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'sex', 'far', 'lost.This', 'one', 'modern', 'horror', 'types', 'trowel', 'frights', 'reminding', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'gon', 'happen', 'music', 'constant', 'shots', 'incoming', 'tide', 'shots', 'crows', 'cries', 'crows', 'dysfunctional', 'bunch', 'breds', 'island', 'also', 'quite', 'lot', 'sign', 'posting', 'pretty', 'flabby', 'plot', 'holes.That', 'said', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'Mr', 'Paisley', 'well', 'was', 'BBC', 'know', 'most', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'think', 'writers', 'producers', 'Mark', 'Harriott', 'Mike', 'Mathews', 'just', 'tried', 'shoe', 'horn', 'too', 'much', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'rather', 'adding', 'Still', 'think', 'kept', 'entertained', 'far', 'being', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'not', 'quite', 'four', 'stars', 'more', 'solid', 'three', 'doubt', 'get', 'rental', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'scares', 'twists', 'sex', 'crow', 'shots', 'scary', 'bits', 'think', 'get']",Unhappy Birthday
