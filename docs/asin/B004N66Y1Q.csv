The afro-sheen commercials I thought there were too many of them, although it was amusing to see them again after all these years. What bugged me the most was on disc 2 some of the performances were clipped off at the end. Also I would have liked to have seen the Sylvers performance of ""Fools Paradise"" which they performed on the same episode after ""Wish that I could talk to you"". Also I would have liked to have seen Dennis Coffey and the Detroit Guitar Band playing ""Scorpio"" as well as the Soul Train dancers stepping to it (I saw them play it on an episode I saw back in the 1970's). I see why some people have complained about the way Time-Life put the Soul Train DVD's together, it seems like they didn't take all the advice they were given to by the people who put the show together in the first place.",3,"Good, could have been better",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,920,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'most', 'part', 'liked', 'performances', 'interviews', 'were', 'okay', 'too', 'afro-sheen', 'commercials', 'thought', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'was', 'amusing', 'see', 'again', 'years', 'What', 'bugged', 'most', 'was', 'disc', '2', 'performances', 'were', 'clipped', 'off', 'end', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Sylvers', 'performance', 'Fools', 'Paradise', 'performed', 'same', 'episode', 'Wish', 'could', 'talk', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Dennis', 'Coffey', 'Detroit', 'Guitar', 'Band', 'playing', 'Scorpio', 'as', 'well', 'Soul', 'Train', 'dancers', 'stepping', 'saw', 'play', 'episode', 'saw', 'back', '1970', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'way', 'Time-Life', 'put', 'Soul', 'Train', 'DVD', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'advice', 'were', 'given', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'show', 'together', 'first', 'place']",N/A
1420700,A1T5PMJZCG2FD1,B004N66Y1Q,Josephine,"[9, 15]","yesterday, february 1, 2012, we all received the tragic news of don cornelius's death. i am still in shock from it (as most of his fans are) but i am also in double shock as that he happened to pass away on the very first day of black history month. i (along with all of his other fans) always thought that don cornelius carved himself out to be a special part of american pop culture history through his hard work in the field of television broadcasting. but, what's even richer and more meaningful is that his passing is now definitely cemented and staked as a mandatory and obligatory part of all future black history month celebrations. there is no way that we can bypass his memory- thank god! i feel that february 1, 2012 should forever and always be ""don cornelius"" day from here on out. i mean how appropriate and befitting is it that don was not only a formidable television icon, dedicating his whole life to broadcast, but he was also an innovator, a mover and a shaker in american culture- both black and white. even in his passing, don cornelius is still and will forever remain an important social figure. what most people who are unfamiliar with don cornelius don't know is that he was a great champion of civil rights. for decades, don fabulously secured a special place in both the history of american pop culture and also, even more importantly, in the history of black americans. don cornelius had his own show. was this the norm in the seventies? absolutely not. watching don live was spell-binding for all soul train fans. it was a time to creatively let loose and let his sensual voice guide you through an ecstasy of soulful music. watching don and soul train was definitely a spiritual experience for all who grew up in the seventies and eighties, like me. don cornelius hosted the show ""Soul Train"" every week. that was even a more awesome and important accomplishment! i mean what black man on television could be himself and be so accepted that he had a regular, star-studded weekly television show? i thought then, and still do now, that he was the classiest black man on television and one of the most intelligent. he was always upbeat and loved to showcase talent- not just black but also white. i mean what a feat to not only be one of the forerunners of bringing black and white together based on a mutual love of music and dance but also to be so well respected by all. nobody ever questioned anyone else's race. each saturday morning, every don cornelius fan waited with bated breath to see what was going to be show-cased next. i remember seeing madonna on the show live for the very first time making her iconic and eternally famous (I mean rock and roll hall of fame famous) comment to Don Cornelius asking her what her life goal(s) were. she replied,""to rule the world."" priceless!! this is just one famous example of what soul train was- it was an outrageous and most fabulous union of people that just wanted to hang-out with each other and have fun. it was a piece of club culture brought to the masses. i mean what 6 year old is ever going to be allowed into a club? only through don cornelius and ""soul train"" were we given an all-access stage pass and glimpse into a peaceful life full of good, clean fun and wholesome at that. the show was classy and taught everyone how to have fun with class. i mean really, do you see this on television anymore? even more spectacular was don's voice. don cornelius had that intriguing voice similar to barry white, al green, teddy pendergrass. i mean don sensually cooed at you and grabbed you and transformed you. even as a six year old, a fan knew instantly that you were making history along with don. in light of his passing, i urge you to purchase what you can related to don cornelius. don is a man that we should always commemorate and revere. he touched lives, memories and most of all, hearts. don will always hold a special and dear place in my heart (as i am sure he does in yours) and rightfully so. as a last farewell, i say ""Love, Peace and Soul"" forever to you don! in my opinion, you died way before all of your fans could give you an appropriate and well-deserved good-bye. i urge everyone who is a fan of don cornelius to petition to set aside february 1 in black history month as ""don cornelius"" day. that way, don cornelius's honor and tremendous dignity will always be served and cherished by all. don you will always reign as number 1, even on february 1.",5,"Don Cornelius: peace, love and soul
