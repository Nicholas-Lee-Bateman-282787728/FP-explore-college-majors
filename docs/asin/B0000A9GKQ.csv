762056,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B0000A9GKQ,A.J. Dill,"[7, 18]","As I read the plot in the item description, I thought this was going to be an awesome anime. I've also seen Fushigi Yugi (which I liked enough to give this show a try). Ceres Celestial Legend does not have near as much as romance drama in Fushigi Yugi, a plus for me, but it also lacks a strong bond between the characters. Aya is done pretty well, but the many of the other characters are introduced too quickly and then killed off too quickly. Things get a little confusing. For instance, after Aya escapes from her family, a couple guys suddenly pop in and bring her to their house. If these characters were people she knew from school, it wouldn't have been so bad. Their introduction could have been much better I thought.Another problem I had was with the originality. SPOILER: It turns out that some of the people in Aya's family want to use her angel blood to make super humans. I wish the plot was more unique than that. How many shows have been around the government wanting to make super humans? The few filler episodes also don't help the situation.I wouldn't bother with this anime even if you are a Fushigi Yugi fan. Everything feels rushed (the plot and the character development) and there is a lack of originality. Even the animation and music score is not that good.",2,Expecting a little better -,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1284,"['read', 'plot', 'item', 'description', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awesome', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'liked', 'enough', 'give', 'show', 'try', 'Celestial', 'Legend', 'not', 'have', 'near', 'as', 'much', 'romance', 'drama', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'plus', 'also', 'strong', 'bond', 'characters', 'Aya', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'too', 'quickly', 'then', 'killed', 'off', 'too', 'quickly', 'Things', 'get', 'little', 'confusing', 'instance', 'Aya', 'family', 'couple', 'guys', 'suddenly', 'bring', 'house', 'characters', 'were', 'people', 'knew', 'school', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'introduction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'thought.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'originality', 'SPOILER', 'out', 'people', 'Aya', 'family', 'want', 'use', 'angel', 'blood', 'make', 'super', 'humans', 'wish', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'unique', 'How', 'many', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'government', 'wanting', 'make', 'super', 'humans', 'few', 'filler', 'episodes', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'situation.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'anime', 'even', 'are', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'fan', 'Everything', 'feels', 'rushed', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'lack', 'originality', 'Even', 'animation', 'music', 'score', 'not', 'good']",Ceres: Celestial Legend - Volume 1

Ayashi no Ceres is a decent series, with a solid storyline and some plot twists. The music is very good, the animation average. One of my biggest complaints with this series is the fact that Aya &amp; Tooya are like Miaka &amp; Tamahome clones, which really really takes away from the character. I keep associating Aya with Miaka's stupidity and Tooya with Tamahome's bland personality. Some of the episodes feel like fillers to drag out the storyline, but hey, the series moves along at a decent pace and ends pretty well.",4,"A little better than FY, but contains many of the same flaws",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,619,"['Oh', 'Back', 'exasperating', 'angst', 'hair-pulling', 'love', 'triangles', 'have', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'Ayashi', 'Ceres', 'decent', 'series', 'solid', 'storyline', 'plot', 'twists', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'average', 'One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'series', 'fact', 'Aya', 'amp', 'Tooya', 'are', 'Miaka', 'amp', 'Tamahome', 'clones', 'really', 'really', 'away', 'character', 'keep', 'associating', 'Aya', 'Miaka', 'stupidity', 'Tooya', 'Tamahome', 'bland', 'personality', 'episodes', 'feel', 'fillers', 'drag', 'out', 'storyline', 'hey', 'series', 'along', 'decent', 'pace', 'pretty', 'well']",Ceres: Celestial Legend - Volume 1

This piano piece ""Scarlet"" is beautiful.Watase Yuu's is the manga successor behind Fushigi Yuugi. And well, Ceres has proved to be much better.Somehow, I agree that its somewhat similiar to Sailor Moon. It has fighting, romance...its your Modern-day fantasy drama.
