Ironically, the actors in these movies are possibly the most retroactively bullied teens of all time, as students are unable to resist mocking poorly-delivered chestnuts like, &#34;Give me your lunch money, eh.&#34;Contest isn't one of those movies. This is a well-acted, humorous, and thought-provoking film that manages to make its message apparent without sacrificing the story. Self-reliant Tommy is forced to collaborate with the intimidating Matt for a cooking contest, but the stakes go way beyond cuisine--Tommy is convinced that Matt has an ulterior motive, and he's not wrong. In fact, there are multiple layers to Matt's involvement, and double-crossing is the biggest dish on the menu. The duo's relationship evolves naturally, and not always in a positive direction, thanks to a combination of Matt's continued desire to impress his cronies and please his devious older brother, and Tommy's inability to fully trust his former tormentor. The ultimate outcome probably won't come as a surprise to viewers, but even towards the end of the film, there are enough twists and turns to keep things exciting.Of course, the mission of a movie like this is probably more about stemming discussion rather than merely trying to entertain. Fortunately, Contest manages to do both, especially since all teens should easily find traces of themselves in one or more characters. In a genre that often comes across as cheesy and forced, this is a rare movie that could actually make a real impact on its audience.",5,The most successful anti-bullying film--no contest,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1972,"['Anyone', 'who', 'attended', 'public', 'school', 'last', '20', 'years', 'quite', 'familiar', 'sort', 'anti-bullying', 'films', 'students', 'are', 'generally', 'forced', 'watch', 'three', 'four', 'teenagers', 'arcade/public', 'library/', '[', 'insert', 'location', 'modern', 'teenager', 'would', 'ever', 'go', 'here', ']', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'were', 'fashion', '10', 'minutes', '1986', 'unsuccessfully', 'attempt', 'suppress', 'Canadian', 'accents', 'stiff', 'narrator', 'audience', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'Ironically', 'actors', 'movies', 'are', 'possibly', 'most', 'retroactively', 'bullied', 'teens', 'time', 'students', 'are', 'unable', 'resist', 'mocking', 'poorly-delivered', 'chestnuts', '34', 'Give', 'lunch', 'money', 'eh.', '34', 'Contest', ""n't"", 'one', 'movies', 'well-acted', 'humorous', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'make', 'message', 'apparent', 'sacrificing', 'story', 'Self-reliant', 'Tommy', 'forced', 'collaborate', 'intimidating', 'Matt', 'cooking', 'contest', 'stakes', 'go', 'way', 'cuisine', 'Tommy', 'convinced', 'Matt', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'not', 'wrong', 'fact', 'are', 'multiple', 'layers', 'Matt', 'involvement', 'double-crossing', 'biggest', 'dish', 'menu', 'duo', 'relationship', 'naturally', 'not', 'always', 'positive', 'direction', 'thanks', 'combination', 'Matt', 'continued', 'desire', 'impress', 'cronies', 'please', 'devious', 'older', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'inability', 'fully', 'trust', 'former', 'tormentor', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'even', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'things', 'exciting.Of', 'course', 'mission', 'movie', 'probably', 'more', 'stemming', 'discussion', 'rather', 'merely', 'trying', 'entertain', 'Fortunately', 'Contest', 'do', 'especially', 'teens', 'should', 'easily', 'find', 'traces', 'one', 'more', 'characters', 'genre', 'often', 'across', 'cheesy', 'forced', 'rare', 'movie', 'could', 'actually', 'make', 'real', 'impact', 'audience']",Contest

This film takes the time to examine the behind-the-scenes life of the bad kid turned friend to the very boy he bullied.

Bullying is the bullet, Peer pressure is the gun. Betrayal, shame, hurt, and too often suicide is the result.

This is also a good anti-bullying film.  I liked Kenton Duty in this film.  He apparently gained 21lbs in muscle for this movie and then way more afterwards.  That's dedication to the art. The movie was awkward at points but other than that it was good.,4,Good,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,387,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'lesson', 'bully', 'turning', 'good', 'guy', 'people', 'learning', 'trust', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'also', 'good', 'anti-bullying', 'film', 'liked', 'Kenton', 'Duty', 'film', 'apparently', 'gained', '21lbs', 'muscle', 'movie', 'then', 'way', 'more', 'afterwards', 'dedication', 'art', 'movie', 'was', 'awkward', 'points', 'other', 'was', 'good']",Contest
1670465,A1NSDP9YZXLMDX,B00F3TD9MO,Russell S,"[1, 1]","First, Bravo! This movie is a scathing attack on Bullying. it is a movie that many younger people should see. Kenton duty is excellent as the bully in question,Danny Flaherty is excellent as the object of his bullying. There are other events going on under the surface with Danny's grandmother and Kenton's brother which also serve to fuel this movie. the rest of the cast including Katherine McNamara et al are all superb and do a lot of credit to a topic that needs to be brought out in the open. This is handled in a very sweet and sometimes harsh way. As I said Bravo, because even in spite of the difficulty of the subject....you still learn the lesson and smile from time to time. Well worth seeing for the entire family.",5,The reasons are clear,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,727,"['First', 'Bravo', 'movie', 'scathing', 'attack', 'Bullying', 'movie', 'many', 'younger', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'Kenton', 'duty', 'excellent', 'bully', 'question', 'Danny', 'Flaherty', 'excellent', 'object', 'bullying', 'are', 'other', 'events', 'going', 'surface', 'Danny', 'grandmother', 'Kenton', 'brother', 'also', 'serve', 'fuel', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Katherine', 'McNamara', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'superb', 'do', 'lot', 'credit', 'topic', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'open', 'handled', 'very', 'sweet', 'sometimes', 'harsh', 'way', 'said', 'Bravo', 'even', 'spite', 'difficulty', 'subject', '.you', 'still', 'lesson', 'smile', 'time', 'time', 'Well', 'seeing', 'entire', 'family']",Contest
