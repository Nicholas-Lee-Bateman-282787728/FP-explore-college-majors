1442003,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0054SE19O,A kids review,"[2, 7]","William Monahan is best known as the screenwriter for a few big movies, including Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven and Body of Lies, and Martin Scorsese's The Departed, for which Monahan won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. For London Boulevard, Monahan not only adapted the Ken Bruen novel of the same name, but also made his directorial debut, and unfortunately, it wasn't exactly an auspicious one. The film stars Colin Farrell as Mitchell, an ex-con trying to go straight who is hired by a reclusive starlet to be her bodyguard; when they cross paths with a notorious mob boss, Mitchell is sucked back into the London underworld against his will. Unfortunately, while I felt the film was adequately stylish and chock full of meaty dialogue, I also felt that there were far too many subplots to follow and that the emphasis on style detracted from the film's overall quality. You'll probably only get a kick out of London Boulevard if you like the stars, or if you're looking for tips on how to speak Cockney.",1,London Boulevard,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,1012,"['William', 'Monahan', 'best', 'known', 'screenwriter', 'few', 'big', 'movies', 'including', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Body', 'Lies', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Departed', 'Monahan', 'won', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'Monahan', 'not', 'only', 'adapted', 'Ken', 'Bruen', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'also', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'auspicious', 'one', 'film', 'stars', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Mitchell', 'ex-con', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'who', 'hired', 'reclusive', 'starlet', 'be', 'bodyguard', 'when', 'cross', 'paths', 'notorious', 'mob', 'boss', 'Mitchell', 'sucked', 'back', 'London', 'underworld', 'will', 'Unfortunately', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'adequately', 'stylish', 'chock', 'full', 'meaty', 'dialogue', 'also', 'felt', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'follow', 'emphasis', 'style', 'detracted', 'film', 'overall', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'only', 'get', 'kick', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'like', 'stars', ""'re"", 'looking', 'tips', 'how', 'speak', 'Cockney']",London Boulevard [Region B]

I kept turning up the sound. hoping to make out what they were saying.

Colin Farrell is pretty as the recently released convict who gets a bodyguard job for a star of some sort who can't go out of the house without papparazi trailing.

1442008,A1O6OZ0NNH3CR4,B0054SE19O,Chuck Snow,"[2, 2]","Despite the sleek look and neo noir aspirations, this movie is nothing more than the old 40's John Garfield chesnut about the guy who's out of jail and decides to go straight but &#34;destiny&#34; has other plans. Well, nothing works. The filmmaker can't seem to make up his mind about Redemption, Vendetta or Romance. So the whole thing curdles way before its predictable ending (you know the &#34;doomed hero&#34; is going to be done in by that teen punk he decides not to kill - I guess this is called Dramatic Irony 101). None of the characters, except for the always charismatic Farrell, are people we care about or root for. The villain is so mean it's beyond caricature - he belongs in an Austin Powers flik. The look of the film is polished as all get-up but adds to the emptiness of the material, and the Yardbird tunes, classic as they are, are used for no apparent reason - is the story supposed to take place in the 60's, does the leading man collect old rock ditties? Kiera Knightley, usually a superb actress and always a stunning presence, is stuck with a thankless part of a wimpy character with no interesting lines of dialogue to say. She seems to fall for Colin Farrell not just because he's the leading man and such an irresistible hunk, but also because, next to the David Thewlis character (her protector from the paparazzi), he looks like he bathes at least once a day - maybe he learned that in prison. There are a lot of subordinate characters and quasi-subplots that seem to be there simply as filler - certainly none of them advance the plot any. Which brings me to this: it is always a danger when writers (or stars) decide to direct their own material with no one there to keep their feet on terra firma. This particular writer-director seems to fall into that category. A shame, as Farrell, Knightley and Thewlis deserve better.

1442009,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0054SE19O,David Baldwin,"[10, 12]","Brian DePalma was considered a master plagiarist by many.  It's with little irony that ""London Boulevard"" reminds you of DePalma's ""Carlito's Way"".  Director William Monahan also references Martin Scorsese which also ironically Monahan wrote the Oscar winning script for ""The Departed"" which was a reimagining of the Hong Kong crime thriller ""Infernal Affairs"".  The question you ask yourself is Monahan's effort more than the sum of it's influences?  The answer to me is a resounding yes.  Similarities to other films cannot be denied but when done right you call it a homage.  Monahan introduces enough unique fluorishes and twists to elevate it above mere copycat status.  Colin Farrell is magnetic and macho as the recently released con who wants to go straight in a world that keeps pulling him into a life of crime.  Ray Winstone adds another indelible portrait to his personal rogues gallery as a sadistic crime boss.  David Thewlis nearly steals the show as the foppish manager of Keira Knightley's papparazzi stalked movie starlet.  The film kept me rapt and invigorated throughout.  For those who would dismiss ""London Boulevard"" as derivative I ask you to consider Bogart, Cagney, and Edward G.  They were gangster archetypes who didn't play the same character twice.  ""London Boulevard"" is a variation of the British gangster tradition that includes ""Get Carter"", ""The Long Good Friday"", ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Sexy Beast'.",5,Gangster Flick Is A Blast,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1429,"['Brian', 'DePalma', 'was', 'considered', 'master', 'plagiarist', 'many', 'little', 'irony', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'DePalma', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'Director', 'William', 'Monahan', 'also', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'also', 'ironically', 'Monahan', 'wrote', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'script', 'Departed', 'was', 'reimagining', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', 'question', 'ask', 'Monahan', 'effort', 'more', 'sum', 'influences', 'answer', 'resounding', 'yes', 'Similarities', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'call', 'homage', 'Monahan', 'enough', 'unique', 'fluorishes', 'twists', 'elevate', 'mere', 'copycat', 'status', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'magnetic', 'macho', 'recently', 'released', 'con', 'who', 'go', 'straight', 'world', 'pulling', 'life', 'crime', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'indelible', 'portrait', 'personal', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'sadistic', 'crime', 'boss', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'foppish', 'manager', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'papparazzi', 'stalked', 'movie', 'starlet', 'film', 'kept', 'rapt', 'invigorated', 'who', 'would', 'dismiss', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'derivative', 'ask', 'consider', 'Bogart', 'Cagney', 'Edward', 'G.', 'were', 'gangster', 'archetypes', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'same', 'character', 'twice', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'variation', 'British', 'gangster', 'tradition', 'Get', 'Carter', 'Long', 'Good', 'Friday', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Sexy', 'Beast']",London Boulevard [Region B]

1442012,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0054SE19O,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","LONDON BOULEVARD is a British film that is unafraid to take a long hard look at the dark side of London - organized and unorganized crime, miscreants of all ages, vengeance, substance abuse - and still come up with a 'bruised hero' with whom we can relate.  The film has its problems: the dialects of these 'English speaking' actors is so thick that it becomes necessary to turn on the subtitles to understand the dialogue, some characters are insufficiently define, the music soundtrack overwhelms the action too frequently. Yet the cast of actors is so strong that they overcome these problems and ultimately give us a terrifyingly real glimpse at the low life happenings in that major metropolis.Mitchel (Colin Farrell, looking better than he has in years) has just been released from jail, an experience he never wants to face again, but his old friends such as Billy (Ben Chaplin) tempt him to get back into big crime. Mitchel still stops by the street people to see his old friend Joe (Alan Williams) who warns Mithcel to stay away from Billy.  Mitchel finds a job as a bodyguard for actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) who stays secluded from the omnipresent paparazzi in her home where she lives with an ex-actor now druggie Jordan (David Thewlis).  Billy learns of Mitchel's new job and informs the local crime lord Gant (Ray Winstone) and a plot to rob Charlotte's home is hatched.  Mitchel will have nothing to do with the plot, warning Gant that he will never work for crime again.  A series of brutal murders occur including the slaughter of old Joe by two young footballers - a deed that enrages Mitchel, but even this need for vengeance is something he cannot carry out.  The plot thickens and other atrocities arise, but Mitchel has fallen in love with the delicate Charlotte and urges her to flee to Los Angeles to rid herself of the dangers and the paparazzi. But despite Mitchel's attempts to stay clean in the midst of the thickening mire that Gant creates, he is thwarted at every turn.  The ending is a major surprise.William Monahan (Body of Lies, The Departed, Kingdom of Heaven) wrote and directed this film based on the novel by Ken Bruen.  It is harsh, it is dark, but it is a fine example of film noir.  Colin Farrell is superb in the every difficult role of Mitchel - his acting skills are polished and his characterization is wholly credible.  The supporting cast - Winstone, Thewlis, Knightley, Chaplin, Eddie Marsan, Anna Friel as Mitchel's alcoholic wasted sister, Jamie Campbell Bower - is astonishingly fine.  This is not a film for the fainthearted, but it is a powerful little movie with many bits of afterburn to keep the audience guessing.

1442013,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0054SE19O,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 10]","I looked forward to seeing what William Monaghan could do on his own, away from the watchful eye of Martin Scorsese and a seriously overrated film like THE DEPARTED. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a good ear for dialogue. But where THE DEPARTED lacked in gravity, LONDON BOULEVARD lacks in just about everything.Basically we have an ex-con (Colin Farrell, looking like he needs some Grecian Formula), his crazed drug-addled sister (an amazingly bizarre Anna Friel), his idiot criminal friend (Ben Chaplin, channelling his inner coke-fiend), a damaged and agoraphopic film starlet (Keira Knightley, happy to finally be out of those horrible PIRATES films), her stoner caretaker (the brilliant David Thewlis), and a prerequisite volatile, vulgar and racist crime boss (Ray Winstone, phoning it in here).The main problem with this film is that it starts out strong with a not-entirely novel concept of an ex-con trying to stay as far away as possible from re-entering that life but keeps being pulled by two opposing forces, but it spirals completely out of control once Ray Winstone enters the picture. His character is less of a fleshed-out character and more of a gimmick. He exists solely to force the protagonist of our film to certain extremes. Character arcs as well as storylines are left incomplete. There seems to be a great deal of footage that was left on the cutting room floor that might elongate the runtime of the film, but it might help to complete and clear up some gaping holes. I will never say that I don't love a great film that makes you think or wonder after the credits start rolling, but the story has to make sense first.Aside from the solid work that Farrell, Knightley (who continues to impress after films like the brilliant NEVER LET ME GO and A DANGEROUS METHOD), and Thewlis do, this film is so far beyond making any kind of narrative sense, it's ridiculous. No character is given an opportunity to get fleshed out; the dialogue is pretty rote for this type of film; the direction by Monaghan seems inspired at first, but then becomes less of a homage to the 70's British crime films that apparently inspired it and more of a ripoff.There's almost no level that the film works at other than the three performers I mentioned already, and the ending is beyond moronic.

(Monaghan also writes the screenplay for this British film.) LONDON BOULEVARD was not widely shown in American movie houses: it took me a while to find the dvd.  I wish I had just re-read the book.The story parodies the 1950 movie by Billy Wilder called ""Sunset Boulevard.""  An ex-con leaves prison, doesn't want to return, and finds employment as a handyman with a reclusive actress who lives grandly in a large home.  Her only servant is a butler.  The ex-con soon shares gifts and other favors from his beautiful employer.The film is well cast. Colin Farrell plays the lead role of the ex-con Mitchell and Kiera Knightley the beautiful, but reclusive young actress. Beautiful people with not much chemistry...in the movie. Mitch spends his time shooing away the paparazzi. Anna Friel plays Michell's sister Briony. In the book she is slightly mad, a confirmed shoplifter, often forgetting her husband is dead. She arrives at Mitch's Welcome Home party ""looking like a radiant bag lady"" and apologizes for Frank's absence. In the film she is love-crazed and well-dressed...just another ditzy gal. David Thewlis plays an effete butler.  He wears wrinkled hippy-like clothes, rarely shaves and has long straggly hair.  Wonderful wit but not a bit like the proper and tuxedoed Max Von-something in ""Sunset Boulevard.""  Thewlis plays a careless protector who mainly sits at a kitchen table smoking funny cigarettes and talking about his career as an actor. Ray Winstone has the plum role of the vicious crime boss Mr. Gant.  He constantly growls with murderous intent in the film. In the book a well-dressed Gant asks the well-dressed Mitch to a posh restaurant in Covent Garden to help him organize his debt collections and to steal Lillian's Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce.Although the funeral of Joe, Mitch's favorite newspaper seller, is somber here...it's out of control in the book. The only mourners, Mitch throws a copy of ""Big Issue"" on the lowering coffin and Briony invites a street musician dressed in kilts to play the bagpipes.Monahan would have done well to let Ken Bruen write the screenplay.  Bruen's characters are funny and quirky.  And he saves the violence for the end of the story.I should have watched the dvd with subtitles...did I miss the Bruen wit?

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 2]","Though it has its issues, LONDON BOULEVARD is a pretty good gangster movie, which seems to draw some of its inspiration from films like CARLITO'S WAY and even SUNSET BOULEVARD.Fresh out of a British prison after spending three years on an assault charge, tough guy Colin Farrell is determined to go straight, even though his best buddy (Ben Chaplin) and his brutal, ultra-violent boss (Ray Winstone) are determined to bring him back into the rackets by fair means or foul.Farrell gets a job working for reclusive movie actress Keira Knightley, who is constantly being stalked by paparazzi stationed outside of her house.  A romantic relationship develops between them, and they even make plans to escape London forever.  Unfortunately, the spurned Winstone is not about to let that happen.William Monahan (THE DEPARTED) both wrote and makes his directing debut with LONDON BOULEVARD, which moves along at a fairly nice clip and never really loses our interest.  The cast is uniformly excellent.The primary problem that I have with this picture is one that is shared with many of today's British movies, and that's its language.Years ago, when actors like Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave or Trevor Howard were making films, you could hear and understand every word they said on screen.  Today, performers akin to the very talented and charismatic Colin Farrell often mumble their lines or speak in an accent and/or with slang that is difficult to understand.  You may be able to generally comprehend what is happening on screen, but the subtleties escape you.There are also a couple of unexplained ""holes"" in the story, like: Who was the paparazzi in the olive green jacket and what was his purpose?On the other hand, perhaps that was explained in the dialogue that I didn't understand.Next time I watch this movie, I think I'll turn on the subtitles.

This is a very neat idea but didn't know if itwanted to be a action movie or a love story. It seemed that the actionaspect was good but then slowed done when Knightly showed up. I realizethat that is the characters dilemma and is needed to show his choice,but the movie didn't feel smooth. This could just be me but I love mobmovies but this one didn't feel like one at all. Very artsy, so beprepared. Overall, not what I expected which is why I think I didn'tlike it that much. Too slow for me. I give it a C.",3,A very slow moving movie that is less gangster action and more internal struggle with a love story. Not for me.

1442037,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0054SE19O,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 18]","This is a directorial debut for William Monahan, Oscar winning writer for Martin Scorsese-directed ""The Departed."" With two names Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley, you may expect something great in ""London Boulevard"" (the name is probably inspired by ""Sunset Boulevard""). The end result is somewhat disappointing, though.Colin Farrell is Mitchel, an ex-convict who just got out of prison. Being hired as a bodyguard for a famous actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) living a secluded life surrounded by the paparazzi, Mitchel starts thinking of a new life plan, but his old friends including Billy (Ben Chaplin) won't let him do that. And when a brutal local gangster Gant (Ray Winstone) steps in, things get more complicated and dangerous.Based on the book of the same title by Ken Bruen (author of ""Blitz,"" basis of a Jason Statham film), ""London Boulevard"" is a British film noir with great atmosphere and on-location shots (thanks to the Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges, ""The Mission""). The cast is interesting, including David Thewlis and Anna Friel, with unanimously effective acting (though typecast Winstone was much better in ""Edge of Darkness"" for which William Monahan wrote the script).The film's problem is obvious: too many subplots and characters. Anna Friel's role as Mitchel's sister is underdeveloped, and so is the character of Keira Knightley, who looks terribly bored. The story doesn't know where it is going (what does Mitchel or Charlotte really want to do anyway?). The film's pace is rushed (especially the second half) and the conclusion is a huge letdown.The best part of the film is some stylish shots and the classic 60s rock soundtrack including The Yardbirds (used three times in the film).",2,"Great Cast, Great Music, Not So Great Story",1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1733,"['directorial', 'debut', 'William', 'Monahan', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'writer', 'Martin', 'Scorsese-directed', 'Departed', 'two', 'names', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'may', 'expect', 'something', 'great', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'name', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'end', 'result', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'though.Colin', 'Farrell', 'Mitchel', 'ex-convict', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'prison', 'Being', 'hired', 'bodyguard', 'famous', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'living', 'secluded', 'life', 'surrounded', 'paparazzi', 'Mitchel', 'thinking', 'new', 'life', 'plan', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'Billy', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', 'when', 'brutal', 'local', 'gangster', 'Gant', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'steps', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'dangerous.Based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Ken', 'Bruen', 'author', 'Blitz', 'basis', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'film', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'British', 'film', 'noir', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'on-location', 'shots', 'thanks', 'Oscar-winning', 'cinematographer', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'Mission', 'cast', 'interesting', 'including', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'unanimously', 'effective', 'acting', 'typecast', 'Winstone', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'William', 'Monahan', 'wrote', 'script', 'film', 'problem', 'obvious', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'role', 'Mitchel', 'sister', 'underdeveloped', 'so', 'character', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'terribly', 'bored', 'story', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'what', 'Mitchel', 'Charlotte', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'anyway', 'film', 'pace', 'rushed', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'conclusion', 'huge', 'letdown.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'stylish', 'shots', 'classic', '60s', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'Yardbirds', 'used', 'three', 'times', 'film']",London Boulevard [Region B]

It (the movie) is English film noir and an interesting looking gangster flick BUT the screenplay took too many twists and WTF turns in the plot from the original book and left me shaking my head, wondering why whoever okayed the script thought it would work. It was good to see Colin Ferrel offering up yet another convincing role. It's just a shame he didn't have a better vehicle to roll with it.Do yourself a favor. Pick up Bruen's book, London Boulevard or anyone of his other novels and have a good read and you'll see what I mean.
