562975,AOG4OAJE74M95,B000050IMV,Bryan A. Hicks,"[1, 2]","&quot;Sleepy Hollow High&quot; is, without a doubt, the worst horror film ever made.  The acting is atrocious.  The story is laughably bad.  And the budget is equal to the price of a loaf of bread.  Which means I had to have it!I am a lover of bad films, so I picked it up on VHS as soon as I saw it.  (Of course, I have to keep it outside, so it won't stink up the house.)  Then, when I heard it was coming to DVD, I, immediately, jumped online and ordered it.  (Actually, I think I paid more for the VHS than the DVD.) So, if you love crappy movies like I do, order it.  (Plus, if you order a copy, then the film-makers have already tripled their profit.)  The DVD also contains deleted scenes (snicker) and commentary track by the film-makers (lol), so you can't go wrong with this disc.  I must warn you though.  The running time printed on the box says 90 minutes.  My VCR clocked the running time to be about 76 minutes.But, the story...ah, yes...a group of kids go into the woods and one by one fall victim to a headless horseman or something.... Hell, I don't know.  I couldn't stop laughing long enough to catch all of the story.",1,About As Scary As An Episode Of Pokemon.

I cannot believe that people got paid for making and acting in this.  I have seen home movies of peoples vacations that have had more of a plotline that Sleepy Horror High.  The lighting had to have been done with a flashlight and to help improve the lightning situation, a campfire was started toward the end of this fine feature film so the actors could see in the dark.  I give it one star not only because I can't go lower, but because of what I saw in the credits at the end (yes, I suffered through it all!)  The filmmakers thanked ""Visa and Mastercard who without their support, the film would have never been made"" (I'm not kidding about this, look for yourself!)
