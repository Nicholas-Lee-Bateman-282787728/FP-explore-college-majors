A family of thinkers, some far advanced for their age, which isnt always a good thing. The casting was great and believable. There are some sad moments of reality but in the end, you're left feeling somewhat satisfied. Not all happy endings are perfect, it's all really relative. This movie plays on the decisions we make based on emotions and the familiarity that stunts your growth from difficult situations.

1633351,A2CCNGYAE2BVUW,B00BEJL5LE,"Chinamommy ""Kylie Mom""","[0, 1]","I wanted to love this film.  Greg Kinnear is one of my favorite actors.  I had several issues with the movie, though (in no particular order):1.  So many parts of the movie were unbelievable.  The father is a writer who hasn't had anything published in over 2 years, yet he lives in a sprawling 3-story beachhouse.  His wife left him 3 years ago, but he thinks she'll return, so he still sets a place for her at the dinner table every night.  Really?!  He also goes to her new house and peeks in her windows.  Are we supposed to find that endearing rather than just plain creepy?His kids are both writers.  The 23 year old daughter is published, and the 16 year old wrote a piece that was so awe-inspiring that Stephen King called him on the phone and said he loved it.  Yeah, right.  The daughter is a cynical b*tch who tells a young man at a bar how he has absolutely no chance of ever dating her because she doesn't believe in love.  But she finds out his mom is dying of cancer and all of a sudden she falls in love with him.The mom spends more than half the movie telling the dad that he needs to get over her, that she will never take him back.  But then on Thanksgiving day, the doorbell at his house rings and...you guessed it....the mom is there asking for another chance.  Good thing he's been setting a place for her at the table for 3 years.  Cue the sappy music.2.  The film was slow.  Many times I was tempted to fast-forward.  At times I found myself checking my e-mail while watching it.3.  Too many plotlines:  The marriage problems with the mom and dad, the son's girlfriend who has a drug problem, the daughter who is afraid to fall in love, the daughter's book being published caused son to be envious, the neighbor who jogs over to the dad's house daily to have sex with him, the daughter's boyfriend's mom dying of cancer.  Too much was crammed into a single movie.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, but not one that I certainly recommend.",2,"Slow, unbelievable, predictable and too many storylines.....",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,1966,"['wanted', 'love', 'film', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'had', 'several', 'issues', 'movie', 'particular', 'order', ':1', 'So', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'unbelievable', 'father', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'anything', 'published', '2', 'years', 'yet', 'sprawling', '3-story', 'beachhouse', 'wife', 'left', '3', 'years', 'ago', ""'ll"", 'return', 'still', 'place', 'dinner', 'table', 'night', 'Really', 'also', 'new', 'house', 'peeks', 'windows', 'Are', 'supposed', 'find', 'endearing', 'rather', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'kids', 'are', 'writers', '23', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'published', '16', 'year', 'old', 'wrote', 'piece', 'was', 'so', 'awe-inspiring', 'Stephen', 'King', 'called', 'phone', 'said', 'loved', 'Yeah', 'right', 'daughter', 'cynical', 'b*tch', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'bar', 'how', 'absolutely', 'chance', 'ever', 'dating', ""n't"", 'believe', 'love', 'out', 'mom', 'dying', 'cancer', 'sudden', 'love', 'him.The', 'mom', 'more', 'movie', 'telling', 'dad', 'get', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'back', 'then', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'doorbell', 'house', 'rings', 'guessed', '.the', 'mom', 'there', 'asking', 'chance', 'Good', 'thing', 'been', 'setting', 'place', 'table', '3', 'years', 'Cue', 'sappy', 'music.2', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'Many', 'times', 'was', 'tempted', 'fast-forward', 'times', 'found', 'checking', 'e-mail', 'watching', 'it.3', 'Too', 'many', 'plotlines', 'marriage', 'problems', 'mom', 'dad', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'drug', 'problem', 'daughter', 'who', 'afraid', 'fall', 'love', 'daughter', 'book', 'being', 'published', 'caused', 'son', 'be', 'envious', 'neighbor', 'who', 'dad', 'house', 'daily', 'have', 'sex', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'mom', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Too', 'much', 'was', 'crammed', 'single', 'movie.All', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'certainly', 'recommend']",Stuck in Love

I found some of the situations and circumstances to be a bit too contrived to be believable. While the underlying familial issues and dysfunction are obviously true-to-life, the writer does push credulity with regards to the contexts in which these issues and dysfunction emerge. For example, the daughter/writer character is way too cynical, streetwise, and worldly to be believable. Has she really experienced so much of life at the age of 22-23, that she can speak with such authority, wisdom and disrespect to her peers and her parents? I don't think so. Which makes the fact that she's written not one, but two publishable books an even greater stretch. To the writer's credit, this character undergoes a transformation-thankfully, which in the context of film, provides a dramatic turn. However, the denouement of her turn rests on another implausible and complicated situation based on the infidelity trail of her parents. Huh?

For my dollar that's what this movie was about.Here's the scoop. Bill Borgens (Greg Kinnear) is an award winning author. His 17 daughter is publishing her first novel and his son is writing poems and short stories. The daughter is promiscuous. She holds all men at arms length and uses them strictly for sexual gratification. The son has a thing for a girl with real baggage, He figures his love will get her to shake some of that baggage. Dad is divorced and waiting for his ex to reconsider. He figures he'll hold tight and one day she'll realize her mistake and return. Can these folks find their way in the world?I guess you could call this and Indy flick but with Kinnear, Jennifer Connelly, Lily Collins and Kristen Bell in attendance this is a bit closer to Hollywood than to Indy. I did enjoy it but it all seemed so obvious. And the need for the director/writer/producers to wrap it up so nice and neat at the end really irked me. Life is not art and art is not life but this could have (should have) been much more subtle. All these people trying to change those around them and all with a specific character framed from specific incidents just didn't ring true. I liked much of the dialogue and it was dotted with some nifty Indy tunes from the likes of Bon Iver and the National. It was nicely (subtly) shot and edited. It was all handled well but it suffered from a script that was too self aware.I can't tell someone to avoid this movie because, for all its faults, it was a pleasant view.

Stuck In Love Is a movie to watch.Meet Bill (Greg Kinnear): Bill is a well known author and father of two. Samantha( Lily Collins) is Bill's daughter also a writer like her dad. Rusty, (Nat Wolff) is Bill's son and also writes from time to time.The story in this movie is dramatic thanks to the many great performances by each individual actor. Each emotion the character in Stuck In Love has whether it be: happiness, sadness, loneliness, etc. you feel it right with the character. Watching this movie reminded me of why movies like Perks of Being a Wallflower, even The Descendants hit home when I watch them. The situations present in this movie feel real and are actually relatable for myself believe it or not. I will not call Stuck In Love absolutely amazing or super terrific, but it is definitely one of this years independent films that is well acted, well sequenced and very well scripted.

1633374,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEJL5LE,J. Richardson,"[1, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.As human beings, we look at love as this all-important feeling that dictates our happiness. However, in reality, love is an unfair and complex concept that isn't easily accessible. There are people who go their entire life without finding ""the one"" and there are others who seem to hit the jackpot on their first try. Still, even after all the heartbreak and all the suffering, most never give up hope. It should come as no surprise that love is a constant topic in the rich-indie Stuck In Love, but there's definitely more to it than that.Stuck In Love follows the Borgens family, a complex group of individuals with a huge passion for the literary arts. Bill Borgens (Greg Kinnear) is a novelist who's been struggling for three years after his wife Erica (Jennifer Connelly) left him. While together, Bill and Erica birthed two children; Sam (Lily Collins) and Rusty (Nat Wolff). The former is in college and is in the process of getting her first novel published. The latter, on the other hand, is a high school student who suffers from a lack of life experience. While Bill, Sam, and Rusty may each be going through their own personal issues, there is this unbreakable bond between the three of them due to their love of writing.The unique thing about this film isn't necessarily its story, but in the way that story is told. Because these three family members are living very different lives, they aren't always going to be in the same room together. Instead, the narrative is strategically organized so we follow each individual separately. For the most part, the story follows Rusty, then Bill, then Sam, and the ending ties them together. When it was all said and done, it was clear that each of them had experienced their own personal transformation and it was the result of everything we witnessed them go through.In fact, what I found most impressive about Stuck In Love was this character development. For example, at the beginning of the film Sam is very cynical about love and she considers herself to be a ""realist."" However, by the end of the story she does a complete 180. Part of this is due to her meeting Lou (Logan Lerman) and part of it is due to her learning new information about her parents' relationship. It was amazing to see such a huge change that felt both natural and genuine. No matter who you are, there are going to be events that are going to alter the way you think, and I believe this film did a wonderful job of showing that.Another thing I really loved was the way the actors made you connect with their characters. Specifically Collins and Lerman, who probably have the two most emotionally unstable characters from the entire cast. Both Sam and Lou are struggling with some heavy issues that go beyond the simplicity of Bill and Rusty's problems. Now that's not to say their problems aren't significant, but Sam and Lou's are more grand in their scope. One is suffering with severe trust issues while the other has a very ill mother. In the end, I think this is what allows the audience to connect on a deeper level and it allows these individuals to feel more three dimensional.That's not to say the film is perfect, though. The way the story is structured results in the film feeling a bit uneven and unfocused. There were times where I was watching one thing unfold, but then we jumped to another character and it broke the flow of the actual story. Also, some of the characters -- like Kate (Liana Liberato), Rusty's love interest -- were severely underdeveloped. This is another individual who seems to be going through a really tough time, but the writers never do much to expand beyond just telling you what's wrong with her. I also would have liked to have seen more from Lou, but he at least felt fleshed out in comparison to Kate.Finally, as a whole, the cast was very enjoyable. During some of the more emotional scenes things did get a little rocky, but there weren't many of those so it didn't hinder the experience too much. Also, I personally felt that each character was perfectly cast. Even the minor roles like Tricia (Kristen Bell) and Jason (Spencer Breslin) -- when was the last time you saw him in something? -- were flawless. In fact, I think this is one of my favorite roles from Bell. She may not have had a lot of screen-time, but her character was so... spunky.Overall Score: 7.9/10 - Stuck In Love is far from perfect, but it's still very enjoyable. It has a nice cast of characters and the story is well thought out, but it is a bit uneven and some of these characters could have used some more attention. With that said, though, I really enjoyed it and I think there's a lot to love if you choose to give it a chance.",4,"7.9/10 - Sweet, but a bit uneven",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,4737,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.As', 'human', 'beings', 'look', 'love', 'all-important', 'feeling', 'happiness', 'However', 'reality', 'love', 'unfair', 'complex', 'concept', ""n't"", 'easily', 'accessible', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'entire', 'life', 'finding', 'one', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'seem', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'first', 'try', 'Still', 'even', 'heartbreak', 'suffering', 'most', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'love', 'constant', 'topic', 'rich-indie', 'Stuck', 'Love', 'definitely', 'more', 'that.Stuck', 'Love', 'Borgens', 'family', 'complex', 'group', 'individuals', 'huge', 'passion', 'literary', 'arts', 'Bill', 'Borgens', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'novelist', 'who', 'been', 'struggling', 'three', 'years', 'wife', 'Erica', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'left', 'together', 'Bill', 'Erica', 'birthed', 'two', 'children', 'Sam', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Rusty', 'Nat', 'Wolff', 'former', 'college', 'process', 'getting', 'first', 'novel', 'published', 'latter', 'other', 'hand', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'lack', 'life', 'experience', 'Bill', 'Sam', 'Rusty', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'three', 'due', 'love', 'writing.The', 'unique', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'story', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'three', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'living', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'going', 'be', 'same', 'room', 'together', 'Instead', 'narrative', 'strategically', 'organized', 'so', 'follow', 'individual', 'separately', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'Rusty', 'then', 'Bill', 'then', 'Sam', 'ending', 'ties', 'together', 'When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'clear', 'had', 'experienced', 'own', 'personal', 'transformation', 'was', 'result', 'everything', 'witnessed', 'go', 'through.In', 'fact', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'impressive', 'Stuck', 'Love', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'beginning', 'film', 'Sam', 'very', 'cynical', 'love', 'be', 'realist', 'However', 'end', 'story', 'complete', '180', 'Part', 'due', 'meeting', 'Lou', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'part', 'due', 'learning', 'new', 'information', 'parents', 'relationship', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'such', 'huge', 'change', 'felt', 'natural', 'genuine', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'events', 'are', 'going', 'alter', 'way', 'think', 'believe', 'film', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'that.Another', 'thing', 'really', 'loved', 'was', 'way', 'actors', 'made', 'connect', 'characters', 'Specifically', 'Collins', 'Lerman', 'who', 'probably', 'have', 'two', 'most', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'characters', 'entire', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Lou', 'are', 'struggling', 'heavy', 'issues', 'go', 'simplicity', 'Bill', 'Rusty', 'problems', 'Now', 'not', 'say', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'significant', 'Sam', 'Lou', 'are', 'more', 'grand', 'scope', 'One', 'suffering', 'severe', 'trust', 'issues', 'other', 'very', 'ill', 'mother', 'end', 'think', 'audience', 'connect', 'deeper', 'level', 'individuals', 'feel', 'more', 'three', 'dimensional.That', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', 'though', 'way', 'story', 'structured', 'results', 'film', 'feeling', 'bit', 'uneven', 'unfocused', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'watching', 'one', 'thing', 'unfold', 'then', 'jumped', 'character', 'broke', 'flow', 'actual', 'story', 'Also', 'characters', 'Kate', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'Rusty', 'love', 'interest', 'were', 'severely', 'underdeveloped', 'individual', 'who', 'be', 'going', 'really', 'tough', 'time', 'writers', 'never', 'do', 'much', 'expand', 'just', 'telling', 'what', 'wrong', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Lou', 'least', 'felt', 'fleshed', 'out', 'comparison', 'Kate.Finally', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'things', 'did', 'get', 'little', 'rocky', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'Also', 'personally', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Even', 'minor', 'roles', 'Tricia', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Jason', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'something', 'were', 'flawless', 'fact', 'think', 'one', 'favorite', 'roles', 'Bell', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'screen-time', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'spunky.Overall', 'Score', '7.9/10', 'Stuck', 'Love', 'far', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'cast', 'characters', 'story', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'bit', 'uneven', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'attention', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'lot', 'love', 'choose', 'give', 'chance']",Stuck in Love

Apparently that is the Hollywood film industry's version of sophisticated, hip parents instead of the reality where those kind of horrible parents would be turned into social services!I found no redeeming characters in this lame film except for Louis, who is mocked by his girlfriend for having ideals and family values. The girlfriend played by Lily Collins was just vile, and I got the distinct impression that she is fairly close to that character in real life. The other thing that puzzled me in this film was the fact that Jennifer Connelly was trotted out yet again as the stunning, unattainable ideal of womanhood, as she is in so many films; I find her quite average-looking and anorexic, myself.This movie is billed as a romantic comedy, while I found nothing funny here. It's just a run-of-the-mill drama with a few sweet moments thrown in. (On a side note, Patrick Schwarzenegger has a small role in this film, which clearly his parents helped him get. He is no great shakes as an actor, and his entire part was to utter several &#34;F Bombs&#34; and shove a girl to the ground.

1633396,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEJL5LE,Paul Allaer,"[9, 12]","""Stuck In Love"" (2013 release; 96 min.) brings the story of the Borgens family. As the movie opens, we see Bill Borgens (played by Greg Kinnear) secretly looking inside the house of his ex-wife Erica (played by Jennifer Connelly), who left him a few years ago to marry a younger guy. We learn that Bill still isn't over Erica, and is ""stuck in love"". We also meet their daughter Sam (played by Lily Collins), a college student who somehow managed to publish a novel with a major publishing house, and hence following in the footsteps of her dad. Sam is all tough on the outside when it comes to love and relationships. Then there is their son Rusty, a HS kid who also aspires to become a writer and who has a crush on Kate, a seemingly unavailable girl in his class. Lastly, we get to know Tricia (played by Kirsten Bell), Bill's occasional girlfriend, and who is trying to coach Bill back into the dating scene. Will Bill and Erica get back together again? or will Bill find success in the dating scene? or both? will Rusty win the love of Kate? and what about the toughness of Sam? To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the feature debut of writer-director Josh Boone, who brings us a pleasant rom-com, even if at times it's played too safe in my opinion. In fact, the movie stands out for me for the acting performances. I almost always enjoy Greg Kinnear, and likewise for Jennifer Connelly, and I did here again. But the bigger surprise here is Lily Collins (daughter of Genesis singer Phil Collins). When she makes her first appearance in the movie, I thought for a second or two ""wow, Jennifer Connelly looks so young!"", only to then realize it was not Connelly, but Collins does in fact looks like a replica of Connelly 20 years ago. And it's not just the looks, as Collins carries a big part of the movie on her shoulders, and with ease. We surely have not seen the last of her (she also stars in the upcoming ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" in a few weeks). Last but certainly not least, the movie features a great soundtrack of indie music, scored by Mike Mogis and Nathaniel Walcott (from Bright Eyes), with some new songs and also a few older from Bright Eyes and others (at one point one of the HS kids gives a Bright Eyes CD as a Christmas gift--do teenagers really still buy CDs?).Bottom line: take this movie for what it is: a pleasant rom-com that is as utterly predictable (as to the plot) as it is enjoyable (as to the performances). This movie showed up last weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release hype or advertising. I figured this won't play very long so I went to see it today.

Holly ""piper909""","[1, 3]","A  promising cast isn't able to inspire much interest in or sympathy for their broken characters, and the essential unreality and  contrivance of this dysfunctional  family as they limp toward a fairly pat denouement  makes it a cold and distant experience for this viewer.  It's not exactly a very romantic rom-com, nor is it especially funny, so what is it?  What they used to call  a ""drawing room"" movie, I suppose.There isn't much emotion that doesn't feel forced, not much sweep, and precious little spark. Kinnear is capable of more humor than this script gives him to work with, and his compulsion to reduce all life's experiences to story-fodder is creepy in its detachment from basic humanity; Connelly mopes and looks doleful most of the time, hardly a stretch for her abilities; Wolff plays stoned even when his character isn't; pretty Lily Collins may have the most screen time and at least looks like she *could* be Connelly's daughter (nice bit of casting there), but her character is relentlessly jaded, cynical, and emotionally retarded despite her surface breeziness and sass.  Other minor characters are cyphers, and with the exception of Lerman's nice-guy boyfriend wannabe,  it's very hard to feel close to any of them.  And there seems to be more than a little wish-fulfillment fantasizing going on with this film -- I mean,  writer-director Boone actually centers this movie around an entire FAMILY of writers -- not only is dad an admired author (who seems to be able to go two years without writing anything new and still afford a large beachhouse on the seashore), but his daughter (Collins) is on the verge of publishing her first book (destined to be a big hit, obviously), her love interest Lerman is a fellow writing student, and son Wolff is an aspiring poet/novelist.  None of them seem to have agents yet they are all living in the writers' dreamworld of instant fame, success, casual flings, and the avoidance of day jobs.  Oh, were this only the case.  Stephen King's cameo voiceover is especially beyond the beyonds (""Hey, I loved your story!"" he tells Wolf over the phone) and he deserves to be pummeled with thousands of unsolicited manuscripts after this. I am wary of first-time director-writers like Boone, who regards this project as ""his baby"" and has drawn heavily from his own background for characters and incidents.  I can't help but feel some people ought to be in therapy working out their problems rather than inflicting them on the rest of us via the entertainment media. Maybe a moratorium should be proclaimed on the ""Write what you know"" approach, because we sure have way too many angst-ridden suburban-privilege stories being written and filmed by too many miserable well-off whiners.The usual heavy-handed soundtrack (oh, these tyrannical dictates to the iPod generation), with the standard ubiquitous and mostly dreary pop tunes, dominates and telegraphs, browbeating the viewer with ""serious"" moments, or ""tender"" moments, rather than the dialogue or the actors carrying these emotional peaks and valleys.  This lazy sonic shorthand is used as a crutch by far too many directors and producers and is a reason why so many of these movies wind up looking like long movie trailers or other commercials.  Despite being clearly told by the directors what and when to feel,  I never really cared about these characters, with their prickly personalities, their privilege (I don't know, maybe it's normal for today's high school  and college students to have plenty of money for clothes, cars, drugs, and not need to earn a mundane  living),  their lack of awareness, their sense of entitlement and immaturity, casual vulgarity, and empty souls.So beyond the problem of appealing to non non-struggling authors, are any of these people very engaging, interesting, or worth our involvement?  My feeling was, ""No, not very.""  The story takes the usual twists and turns, well signposted, to suggest stock character-building and formulaic development but it all comes across as forced or convenient.  Maybe there are too many plotlines to fit into a 90-minute movie -- many events seem rushed, and we never learn the fate of Rusty's girl, the troubled Kate, or how Dad disposes of his zipless-eff neighbor, or exactly what Erica has done to sever ties with her second husband -- but I was glad to reach the predictable end when it came, never mind putting up with another act.I must note the prominence here of short, two-line, nonsubstantive  glowing reviews.

Probably because it wasn't the usual feel good happy ending sort of plot but more the message that if you really believe in true love they will cheat on you, die, or both.

The acting for the most part was ok, but it felt like a very long 11/2 hours. The movie appeared to be searching for a heart and soul that it somehow just couldn't find.
