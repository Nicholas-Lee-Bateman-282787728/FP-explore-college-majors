This series presented you with a lot of drama and a lot of unexpected situations.  Season nine is a great way to celebrate the end of the series.  Dan has made it through thick and thin throughout his life on One Tree Hill, to see his life end was different.  It was nice to see that Nathan and Haley came around and let Dan back into their lives.  It is also good to see Brooke get everything that she has ever wanted.  After what she has been through in Season 5 thru 8, she deserves the happy ending.  When Xavier did come back into the picture, I was just waiting to see when he would attack her next.  I like that Brooke had a battle with the other Tree Hill Caf&eacute; owner.  To see those two come together at the end was a nice touch.  For this ending season, I wish that Lucas and Peyton would have been in the picture more.  I think that would have made the series a perfect ending.  I suggest this series to anyone.  It always keeps you wondering.  It is highly addicting.",5,Highly Addicting!,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,1109,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'first', 'season', 'Now', 'series', 'do', 'miss', 'series', 'presented', 'lot', 'drama', 'lot', 'unexpected', 'situations', 'Season', 'nine', 'great', 'way', 'celebrate', 'end', 'series', 'Dan', 'made', 'thick', 'thin', 'life', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'see', 'life', 'end', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Nathan', 'Haley', 'came', 'around', 'let', 'Dan', 'back', 'lives', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'Brooke', 'get', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'what', 'been', 'Season', '5', 'thru', '8', 'happy', 'ending', 'When', 'Xavier', 'did', 'come', 'back', 'picture', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'see', 'when', 'would', 'attack', 'next', 'like', 'Brooke', 'had', 'battle', 'other', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'see', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'ending', 'season', 'wish', 'Lucas', 'Peyton', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'picture', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'perfect', 'ending', 'suggest', 'series', 'anyone', 'always', 'wondering', 'highly', 'addicting']",One Tree Hill:S9 (DVD)
