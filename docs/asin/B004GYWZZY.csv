1407484,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004GYWZZY,Amit Talpade,"[7, 8]","BBB is a remarkable film and one of the freshest one to appear in recent times and certainly has repeat viewing value. A talented debutant director, Maneesh Sharma, a great writer Habib Faisal and two young actors put on a remarkable show with the script serving as their vehicle. BBB is about the new changes that have appeared in Indian Cinema, the star system is largely reserved for big names and releases but a younger generation of storytellers and directors are making the stories fresher and livelier. BBB captures the business of wedding planning and the essence of the drive of young entrepreneurs who are trying to make it big.Bittu ( Ranveer Singh) is in college but dreads completing it as he would have would have to go back to his village to work with his father. Shruti ( Anushka Sharma) is in the final year of college, but education is only an obstacle, she wants to put together a successful wedding planning business before getting married to any man of her parents choice. They met at a wedding and soon end up as partners in a wedding planning business. Their partnership is successful and they start getting busier. After a unusually successful wedding, they celebrate with alcohol and end up sleeping with each other. Bittu does not want a relationship but Shruti has fallen in love with him. This starts affecting their partnership and a result they part ways.BBB works because the casting is superb, Anushka and Ranveer Singh, they sizzle and burn the screen with their energy and chemistry. Most of the characters speak with a North Indian accent and the dialogue delivery and writing is flawless. Anushka shows that she is here to stay and Ranveer can be safely assumed is destined for greater things i.e. if he makes the right choice of films and does not mess things up for himself. His energy  reminded me of a young SRK in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na. The movie has a great soundtrack and each song is a blockbuster. The songs have been pictured beautifully, colorfully and capture just like the film, the euphoria of a wedding in India. Not to be missed.

Very fun and colorful, but also touching, and romantic. The on screen chemistry between the two leads is amazing and real. Premise; Typical story where she's the hard worker with the big dreams, and he the slacker who's just at college to party. She tells him she's starting a wedding planning business right after graduation. He laughs at her ideas, until his Dad comes to the school to take him home. When he realizes that he doesn't want to go back to the sugarcane fields for the rest of his life, he lies and tells his Dad that he's going into business with her. They agree to run their business honestly, just as friends -no strings-no romantic involvement. Starting out small, they quickly build up, by delivering inexpensive, cute and extremely fun weddings. Moving onto bigger and better, one night after their first bug success, they get drunk, and sleep together. (This is actually a very sensual, romantic, and beautiful scene. ) In the morning she realizes, that she loves him, but he's freaked out by the whole thing. They are already best friends, but he doesn't know how to react, and he screws it up big time. They fight, and it escalates until they split, and break up the company. As all their success came from working together, it's no big surprise that their business fails separated as they are. They are both really stubborn, and refuse to work together. A HUGE prospective client comes to them and tells them that he will only work with them if they agree to work together. As they are now in debt on their own, they agree for only this one time. The ending credit scenes with the curtain call of all the couples that they helped is really cute. Loved the fun feel in the first half, and typical Bollywood style, second half is more dramatic, and serious.
