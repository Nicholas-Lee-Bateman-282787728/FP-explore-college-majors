420201,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304414145,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 8]","""Ransom"" is one of those films that defined the late 90s. With large budgets, larger than life sets, bigger stars, and predictable situations, ""Ransom"" demonstrates that overabundant Hollywood escapism. There was no worry that a Mel Gibson movie would flop - there was no concern that ticket prices would drive audiences away - there was no worries about putting $80 million dollars on the table because this had everything late-90s cinema goers wanted to see with their popcorn and soda. This movie was melodramatic; this gave audiences an evil guy that was loved in ""Forrest Gump"", and it kept us cool for nearly two hours. It had everything. This was a time of taking risks and pushing big names into theaters - now, well, (and one could argue ""thankfully"") that recycled magic has gone. A film like this could not exist today. The ""safe"" nature of this film would be pushed aside for quirky camera footage, younger actors, and less tears with more violence. Audiences have changed, and while I have grown up beyond the ""Ransom"" excitement, I was feeling this love/hate relationship with this film.In 1996, when this film was being released, I was first being introduced to cinema. I was going to theater at any opportunity, I was being pulled into these less-than spectacular situations, and people like Gibson, Sinise, Russo, and Howard were idols because of what they could accomplish on screen. But like any child, I was pulled into the glamour, the hype, and the glitz, while in retrospect, the basics were being missed. Watching ""Ransom"", now thirteen years later, it just doesn't seem like the type of film that deserved wide release. Watching this film today, it felt more like a superimposed made-for-TV movie than a blockbuster. To begin, director Ron Howard was out of his element with this film. ""Apollo 13"", ""Blackdraft"", ""Splash"", even ""Willow"" seems to be more nature based dramas, so to feel him helming this violence-based drama, it just felt staged and unfocused. In the director commentary, Howard discusses how he attempted to use POV shots to convey the story and develop his characters, and while the idea was present, the execution just felt phony. The juggle between Gibson and Russo's perspective at times felt dizzy to the viewer. Yes, the details around a kidnapped child have that effect; it creates havoc for the viewer - ultimately missing stronger themes throughout. That isn't to say Howard didn't have some powerful shots with his cinematographer, overall ""Ransom"" just missed the strength behind the camera. Then, as if to overcompensate for this, Howard allows his actors to overpower the screen with their over-the-top characters. Gibson, a wealthy airline tycoon, goes from passive father to vengeful cynic (a la ""Payback"") in a mere instant, allowing - sadly - more drama to unfold between Russo and Sinise.Who was the central focus of this film? This is an excellent question for Mr. Howard as well as the cast. Is Gibson the main character? Is his child the main character or merely the developing plot? Is the wooden Delroy Lindo a major player, or is Sinise just trying to keep up with Gibson's anger? Valid questions that, alas, cannot be answered by this film. ""Ransom"" attempts to bring too many twists and turns into an already filled suitcase, and the end result is catastrophe. If this would have merely been a story about Gibson reacting to the capture of his son, and Sinise never being revealed until the end, then ""Ransom"" would have successfully accomplished with what it set out to do. The pivotal ending would have been more controlled and dramatic, that this would have made this normal film stand proud. Instead, Howard incorporates two ""family"" dramas together, the Gibson family, and the jumbled undeveloped Sinise family whom includes Lili Taylor, Liev Schriber, Evan Handler, and Donnie Wahlberg. Again, this would work well on paper if we would have the opportunity to see via each perspective, but we do not even within the two hours. Therefore it becomes further unfocused, and disruptive to the central conflict.Finally, the last twenty minutes were mere fluff. Not to give away plot, but it felt like it was placed there for those wishing Gibson would provide some much needed action to the screen. Nothing that developed, nothing that revealed, nothing that enhanced, merely staged action for a drunk with Hollywood money audience. It was shameful.FILM: One viewing. That is all you need with ""Ransom"". Your knowledge of the plot, what happens, and the overdramatic ways of all the actors/characters can only take one viewing, before it just becomes dull. This is not a repeat film. As mentioned, due to the high profile of the actors, this just seemed out of everyone's league - from the director to the cast - and the bombardment of plot holes (aka Jackie Brown) ensures further sales in the dollar bin.VISUAL: Another lacking department. This film (watched Special Edition DVD) felt like an old VHS with blurred images, grainy background, and dark exteriors. The transfer was extremely poor, hoping that one day a HD release of this film will happen, but again - what is the point?SOUND: Composer Howard Shore wrote and recorded a full score, which was rejected by director Ron Howard and replaced with a new one by James Horner. Enough said.EXTRAS: Decent extras on this disc. A ""What Would You Do"" segment that discusses the power of Ron Howard's ability behind the camera. Another one that takes us behind the scenes to see what it was like doing the dramatic points as well as the humor of the cast. An international trailer. Finally, director commentary by Mr. Howard himself. This is interesting and provides some technical detail, but Howard leaves gaps between information allowing us to basically watch the movie again. Not good.Overall, I disliked ""Ransom"". When I first began this review, I was in a love/hate relationship, but as I wrote I found more issues with this film. The lack of development between minor characters, the entire Jackie Brown subplot was embarrassing, and the scene in which Russo visits the church just wasted my time. The transitions between scenes and plots were lacking, which I blame directly on Howard's inability to control what was happening. He had a strong focus, but the execution is where it faultered. I do not see myself watching this film ever again - and ultimately will smile when seen on late night TV or in the dollar bin - that was the feel of ""Ransom"".Grade: ** out of *****",2,"They may take

When things go from bad to worst, Gibson takes control of the negotiation, and suddenly all hell breaks loose.This is an entertaining and quite suspenseful film, wth a terrific supporting cast that includes Rene Russo as Gibson's wife, Gary Senise as a duplicitous local cop, and Mark Wahlberg as one of the kidnappers.

420214,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6304414145,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","The year Mel Gibson was born, Glenn Ford and Donna Reed had the roles of frantic parents dealing with the abduction of their son.The original 1956 film version of ""Ransom"" was of its time, complete with docile Bible quoting servants and a mother who, while periodically confrontational with those working on the case, remains upstairs and in bed under sedation for most of the time, and the kidnappers remain unseen.But this impressive 1996 remake is very much of its time, too, and as Tom and Kate Mullen (Mel Gibson and Renee Russo), an airline executive and a former High School Science teacher,we come to view a more complex couple, and we see how a shady business deal by someone who is supposed to be viewed as a ""good guy"" has led to the incident related in this story.As young Sean Mullen, Brawley Nolte is a typical nine-year-old with an independent spirit. Abducted while at a science fair over which his mother presides, he spends much of the film bound, and blindfolded with Heavy Metal music as the main sound he hears while lying on a mattress in a dark room, occasionally being pulled into a sitting position by his captors, and making only one attempt to fight back.In trying to retrieve her son, Renee Russo is more than just a mom who lies upstairs under sedation, but as might any modern woman in the same situation, takes a more active role in retrieving her son, even confronting the kidnapper and taking a few hard knocks along the way.Delroy Lindo's Lonnie Hawkins leads the team of FBI agents working on the case in the Mullen's apartment. He monitors Tom Mullen's confrontation with an incarcerated mobster named Jackie Brown(Dan Hedaya), a suspect in the kidnapping, and a botched attempt at a money drop before having to really steel himself to deal with Mullen's most dramatic act of sabotage: Going on network TV to announce that the $2 million ransom will now become a bounty on the kidnapper's head. From there, the drama escalates.Gary Sinese plays the devious Detective Jimmy Shaker, Lili Taylor is his conflicted lover, Maris Conner, who has a connection to the Mullens. Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg play Clark and Cubby Barnes, Evan Handler is Miles Roberts, and Iraida Polanco is the Mullens' not-so-docile housekeeper, Fatima, who lends a little assistance with the case.Under Ron Howard's skillful direction, the 1950s censorship codes are lifted and viewers are presented with an intense gritty, realistic, and ultimately satisfactory drama.",5,More Meat  Than the 1956 Original,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,2486,"['year', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'born', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'had', 'roles', 'frantic', 'parents', 'dealing', 'abduction', 'son.The', 'original', '1956', 'film', 'version', 'Ransom', 'was', 'time', 'complete', 'docile', 'Bible', 'quoting', 'servants', 'mother', 'who', 'periodically', 'confrontational', 'working', 'case', 'upstairs', 'bed', 'sedation', 'most', 'time', 'kidnappers', 'remain', 'unseen.But', 'impressive', '1996', 'remake', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'too', 'Tom', 'Kate', 'Mullen', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'airline', 'executive', 'former', 'High', 'School', 'Science', 'teacher', 'come', 'view', 'more', 'complex', 'couple', 'see', 'how', 'shady', 'business', 'deal', 'someone', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'viewed', 'good', 'guy', 'led', 'incident', 'related', 'story.As', 'young', 'Sean', 'Mullen', 'Brawley', 'Nolte', 'typical', 'nine-year-old', 'independent', 'spirit', 'Abducted', 'science', 'fair', 'mother', 'presides', 'much', 'film', 'bound', 'blindfolded', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'music', 'main', 'sound', 'lying', 'mattress', 'dark', 'room', 'occasionally', 'being', 'pulled', 'sitting', 'position', 'captors', 'making', 'only', 'one', 'attempt', 'fight', 'back.In', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'son', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'more', 'just', 'mom', 'who', 'upstairs', 'sedation', 'might', 'modern', 'woman', 'same', 'situation', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'retrieving', 'son', 'even', 'confronting', 'kidnapper', 'taking', 'few', 'hard', 'knocks', 'way.Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Lonnie', 'Hawkins', 'team', 'FBI', 'agents', 'working', 'case', 'Mullen', 'apartment', 'Tom', 'Mullen', 'confrontation', 'incarcerated', 'mobster', 'named', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'suspect', 'kidnapping', 'botched', 'attempt', 'money', 'drop', 'having', 'really', 'steel', 'deal', 'Mullen', 'most', 'dramatic', 'act', 'sabotage', 'Going', 'network', 'TV', 'announce', '2', 'million', 'ransom', 'will', 'now', 'become', 'bounty', 'kidnapper', 'head', 'there', 'drama', 'escalates.Gary', 'Sinese', 'devious', 'Detective', 'Jimmy', 'Shaker', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'conflicted', 'lover', 'Maris', 'Conner', 'who', 'connection', 'Mullens', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'play', 'Clark', 'Cubby', 'Barnes', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'Miles', 'Roberts', 'Iraida', 'Polanco', 'Mullens', 'not-so-docile', 'housekeeper', 'Fatima', 'who', 'little', 'assistance', 'case.Under', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'skillful', 'direction', '1950s', 'censorship', 'codes', 'are', 'lifted', 'viewers', 'are', 'presented', 'intense', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'satisfactory', 'drama']",Ransom VHS

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","How far would you go to get your son back if he was held for ransom?From director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13&#8243;, ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Frost/Nixon""), ""Ransom"" is a crime thriller featuring an all-star cast which includes Mel Gibson (""Braveheart"", ""Signs"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""The Patriot""), Rene Russo (""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""Outbreak""), Delroy Lindo (""The Cider House Rules"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""The One""), Gary Sinise (""Apollo 13&#8243;, ""Mission to Mars""), Liev Schrieber (""Defiance"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Salt""), Donnie Wahlberg (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Blue Bloods""), Lili Taylor (""Say Anything"", ""High Fidelity"") and Evan Handler (""Sex and the City"", ""Californication"").Based on an idea from a story of an episode of ""The United States Steel Hour"" (from 1954), ""Ransom"" was released in theaters in 1996 and was a box office success earning over $309 million.VIDEO:""Ransom: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Video quality is very good as close-ups showcase the detail on the character's faces to their clothing.  Skin tones are natural, black levels and deep but the film looks like it has been cleaned up via slight DNR (which is probably going to be the case for a lot of studios in 2012, as most casual viewers have voiced their opinion against grain, versus the videophiles who prefer it).  But compared to the original LD and DVD versions, this is the best version of I have seen of ""Ransom"" by far.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Ransom: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Frenh 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Lossless audio is what I was expecting for this older film.  While there are scenes that utilize the surround channels during the more action-intense scenes towards the final arc of the film, the film is primarily front and center-channel driven due to the film being dialogue driven.  Ambiance could have been utilized much more, especially with scenes involving crowds but overall, the lossless soundtrack was good but could have been much better.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Ransom: 15th Anniversary Edition"" features the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (3:53) Featuring four deleted scenes.What Would You Do? - (13:16) Featuring interviews with Ron Howard, editor Dan Hanley and the cast and crew of ""Ransom"".Between Takes - (4:00) Ron Howard, Rene Russo and Mel Gibson having fun between takes.International Theatrical Trailer - (1:06) The international theatrical trailer for ""Ransom"".JUDGMENT CALL:Back in 1996, with the success of ""Braveheart"", seeing the reunion of ""Lethal Weapon"" stars Mel Gibson and Rene Russo, was pretty exciting.And as these two talents were becoming big stars at the time, so was the career of filmmaker Ron Howard.  As a fan of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Happy Days"", I've supported Ron Howard's filmmaking career by watching most of the films he had directed, so suffice to say, I had high hopes when I watched this film in the theater.And at the time, I loved the film.  Enjoyed it so much that I would purchase the extended edition on LaserDisc and also the DVD.Here were in 2012, 15-years-later and ""Ransom"" (the theatrical edition, not the extended version) makes its debut in HD via Blu-ray.  And while ransom films usually do well in theaters such as the more recent films such as ""Taken"", ""Munich"" ""Inside Job"" or ""Firewall"" or a classic ransom film such as Akira Kurosawa's ""High and Low"", ""Ransom"" does have its place as one of the memorable ransom films out there.Mel Gibson and Rene Russo play two parents who are taken through a  degrees of emotions as they try to save their son, but with each mistake, they feel that they are more closer to losing him and getting their own son killed.  Both have amazing chemistry and both feed off each other's emotions.  Mel Gibson's Tom Mullen is a man full of anguish, a man that wants to be a ban and not give in to the kidnappers demands but is powerless, Rene Russo is the wife, Kate, who is pushed to the brink that we see her emotions start to turn its back on her husband.These are emotions that many past ransom films do not tend to emphasize.  A lot of tears, a lot of confrontational arguments and plenty of frustration, it's what I want to see in a ransom film.  True raw emotion of despair of one trying to get a family member or a child back from kidnappers.  And both Mel Gibson and Rene Russo are effective.And on the opposite end, Gary Sinise can always play a villain.  In this case, a detective who knows the law, but is also the leader of this kidnapping group.  He is remorseful, he is deadly and he will not hesitate in killing the young Sean.We do get to see a little Mel Gibson bravado in this film, as most people are so used to seeing him in action roles back in the '90s but for the most part, director Ron Howard is able to keep a balance between emotional drama and action that even 15-years-later, this film holds up quite well.While the Blu-ray release of ""Ransom"" features the film in HD and with a lossless soundtrack, slight DNR was used but as mentioned, this is the state of Blu-rays in 2012, as some studios are now trying to find a medium to appease the videophile who want grain or the casual masses who have shown their disdain towards seeing grain on films in HD.  As for the special features, these are the same special features from the DVD release.As for ""Ransom"", as thrilling as the film was back in 1996, the film is just as exciting in 2012!  Ron Howard does an amazing job as director, the acting performance by Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise is fantastic and for fans of the film, this is probably the definitive version to own of the film right now.Overall, if you are looking for an awesome crime thriller, ""Ransom"" is one of the best ransom films made in America and worth owning on Blu!",4,"(Blu-ray) As for ""Ransom"", as

420216,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6304414145,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 4]","Mel Gibson could hardly resist doing this picture since it not only amounts to a vehicle for him, but is exactly the kind of slightly off-beat but heroic part that he likes (cf., Conspiracy Theory 1997).  He does a good job although his tendency to overact is not under consistent directorial control.  But Ron Howard directing Mel Gibson is a bit like Spike Lee directing Danny DeVito.  (Huh?)  Or how about Oprah Winfrey directing Whoopie Goldberg?  Or, John Wayne directing Clint Eastwood?Gary Sinise as Jimmy Shaker, a cop gone not just bad, but sleazy psycho bad, also does a good job although just why he is such a sickie and why nobody noticed before is not developed or even explained.  Rene Russo does her best (alas) as the suffering wife and mother condemned to a dreary role of one dimension.  I was thinking, how about some creative casting?  Instead of Lili Taylor as the bad girl, how about having her play Gibson's trophy wife and make Russo the girl gone bad?  Taylor is talented enough to pull it off with panache and Russo would be an arresting sight among the degenerates.Ron Howard clearly worked hard to hi-tech the old ransom plot with cell phones and cell phone tracers, infrared goggles, voice-distorters, helicopters and electronic homing devices.  He provides plenty of shoot 'em up and gives the tale a twist with Gibson challenging the kidnappers.  He also affords us a lot of satisfying revenge stuff at the end.I do have a couple of questions though.  Was his portrait of the FBI inspired by the real life FBI's fine work at Ruby Ridge and Waco?  I mean at no time in this movie did the FBI do anything positive.  I'm not crazy about today's FBI anymore than anyone else, but was this a fair and realistic take on how they might handle such a case?  Also what was police detective Jimmy Shaker's motivation for the kidnapping in the first place?  After x number of years on the force he suddenly gets a yen for a lot of money and balmy climes?  Finally why doesn't he just take his cleverly and murderously earned reward a couple of days down the road instead of showing up prematurely at the Mullen place and giving himself away?Bottom line: this picks up after a slow beginning, and there's some clever business along the way, but don't examine it too closely.",3,Average,1039478400,"12 10, 2002",2002,2293,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'could', 'hardly', 'resist', 'doing', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'vehicle', 'exactly', 'kind', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'heroic', 'part', 'cf.', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', '1997', 'good', 'job', 'tendency', 'overact', 'not', 'consistent', 'directorial', 'control', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'directing', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'bit', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'directing', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Huh', 'how', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'directing', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg', 'John', 'Wayne', 'directing', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Jimmy', 'Shaker', 'cop', 'gone', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'sleazy', 'psycho', 'bad', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'just', 'why', 'such', 'sickie', 'why', 'nobody', 'noticed', 'not', 'developed', 'even', 'explained', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'best', 'alas', 'suffering', 'wife', 'mother', 'condemned', 'dreary', 'role', 'one', 'dimension', 'was', 'thinking', 'how', 'creative', 'casting', 'Instead', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'bad', 'girl', 'how', 'about', 'having', 'play', 'Gibson', 'trophy', 'wife', 'make', 'Russo', 'girl', 'gone', 'bad', 'Taylor', 'talented', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'panache', 'Russo', 'would', 'be', 'arresting', 'sight', 'degenerates.Ron', 'Howard', 'clearly', 'worked', 'hard', 'hi-tech', 'old', 'ransom', 'plot', 'cell', 'phones', 'cell', 'phone', 'tracers', 'infrared', 'goggles', 'voice-distorters', 'helicopters', 'electronic', 'homing', 'devices', 'plenty', 'shoot', 'tale', 'twist', 'Gibson', 'challenging', 'kidnappers', 'also', 'lot', 'satisfying', 'revenge', 'stuff', 'end.I', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'questions', 'Was', 'portrait', 'FBI', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'FBI', 'fine', 'work', 'Ruby', 'Ridge', 'Waco', 'mean', 'time', 'movie', 'did', 'FBI', 'do', 'anything', 'positive', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'today', 'FBI', 'anymore', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'fair', 'realistic', 'take', 'how', 'might', 'handle', 'case', 'Also', 'what', 'was', 'police', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'Shaker', 'motivation', 'kidnapping', 'first', 'place', 'x', 'number', 'years', 'force', 'suddenly', 'yen', 'lot', 'money', 'balmy', 'climes', 'Finally', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'cleverly', 'murderously', 'earned', 'reward', 'couple', 'days', 'road', 'instead', 'showing', 'up', 'prematurely', 'Mullen', 'place', 'giving', 'away', 'Bottom', 'line', 'up', 'slow', 'beginning', 'clever', 'business', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'examine', 'too', 'closely']",Ransom VHS

Litton,"[5, 8]","One of the factors that keeps &quot;Ransom&quot; from being a great movie, as opposed to a good one, is that we know too much in the beginning about who's behind the crime at the center of the story. In effect, this tactic also works in the movie's favor, providing it the opportunity to create a truly suspenseful game of psychological cat-and-mouse while showcasing powerhouse performances from Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise. Once the movie draws to a conclusion, the good points of this Catch-22 plot point outweigh the bad, but there are drawbacks.Gibson is cast as wealthy airline owner Tom Mullen, living a picture-perfect life in New York City with his wife Kate (Rene Russo) and young son Sean (Brawley Nolte). All is as it should be until Sean is kidnapped from a science fair in Central Park, leaving Tom and Kate distraught and feeling helpless. Despite the kidnapper's warning that there be no police or law officials involved, Tom turns to the FBI, believing that this crime against him may have a connection to a payoff he made that landed gangster Jackie Brown in prison (the motivation behind the crime is never really cemented, but passed off as jealous rage for Tom's avoidance of prison for said payoff).On the opposite end of the threatening phone calls and emails is detective Jimmy Baker (Gary Sinise), his girlfriend Maris (Lili Taylor), hacker whiz Miles (Evan Handler), and brothers Clark and Cubby Barnes (Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg). They make a demand of two millions dollars in return for the safe delivery of Tom's son, which Tom agrees to pay at the behest of Kate and the FBI officials assigned to the case.To this day, I don't know why filmmakers even bother to include an FBI subplot in any crime thriller, given their obvious failures and mishaps in movies stretching back as far as time itself. Take, for instance, the scene in which Tom leaves to deliver the money in return for the address where his son is located. When he arrives for the exchange with Cubby, who has told his brother he will not deliver the money until Baker delivers Tom's son, the FBI helicopters fill the night sky and ruin what would have been a successful payoff. Only after this incident does it ever occur to them that there might be more than one person involved in the kidnapping.I also think the movie would benefit from keeping the identity of Sinise's character a secret until a sufficient point much later in the film, perhaps when he alerts the police to the boy's whereabouts. The presence of his fellow kidnappers is more than enough to suffice the mystery of his identity; it just seems like the old unknown mastermind plot twist would serve the movie better than knowing upfront.And that's an even bigger problem, considering that the identity of this character is intrical to the effectiveness of the movie's turn of events, in which Tom turns his promised delivery of the ransom money into a bounty for the kidnappers' identities, provided they are captured and positively identified as such, of course. Risking his son's life and the disapproval from his wife, he dives into a dangerous mind game in which he challenges his son's captors to come clean without their expected reward, and despite the fact that we can predict how this plot twist will eventually end up, there is still a great deal of tension resonating from this psychological battle of the minds.In addition to the high level of suspense, this thriller is armed with a sure-fire cast that hits all the right notes in all the right places. Tom's devotion to his son, as well as his wanting for nothing more than his safe return, is beautifully acted by Gibson, who delivers lines like &quot;Give me back my son!&quot; with a sublime mixture of fear and anger. Russo also receives high marks as a mother driven mad by all that's going on around her, and her scenes involving fits of anger and fright are hard-hitting and realistically acted. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sinise portrays Baker's gradual breakdown with savage brutality, becoming more than just an ordinary movie villain. As the quartet of kidnappers, Taylor, Handler, Schreiber and Wahlberg each have moments where they shine.Overall, I liked &quot;Ransom.&quot; I enjoyed its ability to keep me on edge while waiting for a plot twist I saw coming a mile away; I greatly enjoyed watching a wonderful cast exercising their most extreme talent; most of all, I relished the tension that centers on the mind game Tom engages in with those who wish to do his son harm. As much as I enjoyed it, I wonder how the movie would fare if Baker's identity as the mastermind were kept a secret, and whether or not the absence of the FBI from the story would make much of a difference; maybe we'll never know.",4,Flawed yet serviceable thriller with tight suspense.,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,4765,"['One', 'factors', 'keeps', 'quot', 'Ransom', 'quot', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'opposed', 'good', 'one', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'beginning', 'who', 'crime', 'center', 'story', 'effect', 'tactic', 'also', 'movie', 'favor', 'providing', 'opportunity', 'create', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'game', 'psychological', 'cat-and-mouse', 'showcasing', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'good', 'points', 'Catch-22', 'plot', 'point', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'are', 'drawbacks.Gibson', 'cast', 'wealthy', 'airline', 'owner', 'Tom', 'Mullen', 'living', 'picture-perfect', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'young', 'son', 'Sean', 'Brawley', 'Nolte', 'should', 'be', 'Sean', 'kidnapped', 'science', 'fair', 'Central', 'Park', 'leaving', 'Tom', 'Kate', 'distraught', 'feeling', 'helpless', 'kidnapper', 'warning', 'be', 'police', 'law', 'officials', 'involved', 'Tom', 'FBI', 'believing', 'crime', 'may', 'have', 'connection', 'payoff', 'made', 'landed', 'gangster', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'prison', 'motivation', 'crime', 'never', 'really', 'cemented', 'passed', 'off', 'jealous', 'rage', 'Tom', 'avoidance', 'prison', 'said', 'payoff', 'opposite', 'end', 'threatening', 'phone', 'calls', 'emails', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'Baker', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'girlfriend', 'Maris', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'hacker', 'whiz', 'Miles', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'brothers', 'Clark', 'Cubby', 'Barnes', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'make', 'demand', 'two', 'millions', 'dollars', 'return', 'safe', 'delivery', 'Tom', 'son', 'Tom', 'pay', 'behest', 'Kate', 'FBI', 'officials', 'assigned', 'case.To', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'bother', 'include', 'FBI', 'subplot', 'crime', 'thriller', 'given', 'obvious', 'failures', 'mishaps', 'movies', 'stretching', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'time', 'Take', 'instance', 'scene', 'Tom', 'deliver', 'money', 'return', 'address', 'where', 'son', 'located', 'When', 'exchange', 'Cubby', 'who', 'told', 'brother', 'will', 'not', 'deliver', 'money', 'Baker', 'delivers', 'Tom', 'son', 'FBI', 'helicopters', 'fill', 'night', 'sky', 'ruin', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'payoff', 'Only', 'incident', 'ever', 'occur', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'involved', 'kidnapping.I', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'benefit', 'keeping', 'identity', 'Sinise', 'character', 'secret', 'sufficient', 'point', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'perhaps', 'when', 'police', 'boy', 'whereabouts', 'presence', 'fellow', 'kidnappers', 'more', 'enough', 'suffice', 'mystery', 'identity', 'just', 'old', 'unknown', 'mastermind', 'plot', 'twist', 'would', 'serve', 'movie', 'better', 'knowing', 'upfront.And', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'considering', 'identity', 'character', 'intrical', 'effectiveness', 'movie', 'turn', 'events', 'Tom', 'promised', 'delivery', 'ransom', 'money', 'bounty', 'kidnappers', 'identities', 'provided', 'are', 'captured', 'positively', 'identified', 'such', 'course', 'Risking', 'son', 'life', 'disapproval', 'wife', 'dangerous', 'mind', 'game', 'son', 'captors', 'come', 'clean', 'expected', 'reward', 'fact', 'can', 'predict', 'how', 'plot', 'twist', 'will', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'tension', 'resonating', 'psychological', 'battle', 'minds.In', 'addition', 'high', 'level', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'armed', 'sure-fire', 'cast', 'right', 'notes', 'right', 'places', 'Tom', 'devotion', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'wanting', 'nothing', 'more', 'safe', 'return', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Gibson', 'who', 'lines', 'quot', 'Give', 'back', 'son', 'quot', 'sublime', 'mixture', 'fear', 'anger', 'Russo', 'also', 'high', 'marks', 'mother', 'driven', 'mad', 'going', 'scenes', 'involving', 'fits', 'anger', 'fright', 'are', 'hard-hitting', 'realistically', 'acted', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Sinise', 'Baker', 'gradual', 'breakdown', 'savage', 'brutality', 'becoming', 'more', 'just', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'villain', 'quartet', 'kidnappers', 'Taylor', 'Handler', 'Schreiber', 'Wahlberg', 'have', 'moments', 'where', 'shine.Overall', 'liked', 'quot', 'Ransom.', 'quot', 'enjoyed', 'ability', 'keep', 'edge', 'waiting', 'plot', 'twist', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'exercising', 'most', 'extreme', 'talent', 'most', 'relished', 'tension', 'mind', 'game', 'Tom', 'who', 'wish', 'do', 'son', 'harm', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'wonder', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'fare', 'Baker', 'identity', 'mastermind', 'were', 'kept', 'secret', 'not', 'absence', 'FBI', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know']",Ransom VHS

The possibilities were excellent, and these were exploited in the Mel Gibson version.  Whatever you think about Gibson's personal challenges, forget them as you watch this film because he is at his dramatic best here, as he takes an incredibly controversial stand in refusing the kidnappers' demands, at the possible expense of everything he holds dear in life.The casting for the film is truly excellent, and Gary Sinese is superlative in his role as the policeman-turned-villian.

Ron Howard directs this, for the most part, gripping story with propulsion and the ability to gain nuanced performances from a disparate cast.  The result is a tightly wound spring that coils tensely until the last fifteen minutes when the film explodes.Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy man with a strong willed wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son Sean (Brawley Nolte - yes, in life the son of actor Nick Nolte).  When Sean is kidnapped by a Detective (!)  Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) and ransom is demanded, Tom goes before national TV audiences and doubles the ransom demand  for a bounty on Shaker's life.  How this turn of events of a kidnapper becoming the victim and the resolution of the kidnapping that results is the gist of the story: it is the struggle of good vs evil, citizen vs police, and calling the bluff of a dangerous man for the sake of a father saving his child.Gibson does well as the torn father, though director Howard allows him to go a bit over the edge, acting wise.  The real shiner of this film is Gary Sinise who continues to impress with the facility with which he moves through varied character parts.  There are moments of fine expressive silences from co-stars Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, Delroy Lindo, and Donnie Wahlberg that enhance the tension because of the underplaying of their roles: Gibson could take some pointers...A good cat and mouse tale that has at its core the heinous crime of kidnapping, police corruption, and family devotion, this film is worth a view.

That is the question that director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"") leaves the audience to ponder in his action-thriller ""Ransom"", starring Mel Gibson (""Braveheart"" & `Lethal Weapon' franchise), Rene Russo (""Lethal Weapon 3""), and Gary Sinise (""Forrest Gump"").""Ransom"" is the story of multi-millionaire airline executive Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), whose charmed life is flipped upside down when a gang of criminals kidnap his only son.  Asking for a hefty ransom while threatening to kill the child if the family doesn't pay, Mullen and his wife (Rene Russo) choose to pay the ransom.  However, due to police mistakes the ransom drop is botched, leaving Tom to wonder what will happen if he continues to rely solely on the police and the F.B.I. to solve this case and return his son to him safely.  That is when this desperate father does what no one thought possible, he turns the tables on the kidnappers by placing a bounty on their heads.  Now with the kidnappers on the ropes and tensions high, it's a battle against time and fate for the kidnappers to make their decision and for Mullen to get his son back alive.This critically acclaimed box office smash had the perfect blend of action, suspense, and drama all carefully crafted by Academy Award winning director Ron Howard and his producer Brian Grazer.  With outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise who shine brightly in every scene, there is not a single weak moment in this entire film.

420238,AYQ5QOEUN2I3L,6304414145,Marie Edwards,"[3, 3]","Ok, not too many times does a movie come along and have me wondering what the heck is going on.RANSOM took me by surprise. Yes, it's a contrived ""we have your kid, you want him back, you pay"" plot and storyline. But, it's how it is played out that makes this movie good entertainment.Now, no ""fictional"" movie is ever going to depict real life. But, suspend the ""reality"" for the movie and you go along for a wild ride. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is an airline executive, built the company from the ground-up, and will do anything to protect it. Kate (Russo) is his wife, who obviously has seen the ups and downs of their life, but has honored her ""for better for worse"" marriage vows. Then, they have a talented and bright child Sean (Brawley Nolte) who isn't too neglected and seems to have adequate child/parent time with each parent.In what we should expect to happen, does indeed happen, the child is taken for ransom. But, it's in the how and the who that really grips us. He is taken from a public place which shows the kidnappers as thumbing their nose under everyone, and shows us we are too complacent in our feelings of security in public places, even during the day.Det. Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) is the ring-leader, and I think his identity coming out sooner is to me part of the whole riddle and scheme of the movie, after all, he has no motive....well he does, but we will get to that later. He seems to be functionally insane. He can function in public, do his job and then he's a psycho on top of it all. How else can you do what he did??After a botched ""money drop"" attempt, Mullen finds himself in a situation where he ponders ""would paying the money really insure my son's safe return""? And he's right. We know it wouldn't. And he attempts to convince his wife that it's not about the money, it's about getting their son back alive. Once the kidnapper has their money, they have no reassurance if the boy will come back alive, which is the whole point behind paying the ransom, now isn't it?So... since it's all about money, why not turn it into a bounty? Which is what Mullen does. Who wouldn't turn in someone they know for $2 million? Which is what he is counting on, and Shaker didn't. Now Shaker has to keep calm (which he can't do, since his scheme is coming apart at the seems along with everyone he's around) and he's going beserk, while everyone else is trying to abandon the plan.And Shaker doesn't like people ""bailing"" on him. Can anyone say ""psycho""?Shaker decides to give in, and gives the child back alive, killing all his co-horts in the process. But, it's when his greed gets the better of him he gets found out. Had he followed the plan, likely he would have been sipping margaritas in Mexico, but he had to have to money early and pays the ultimate price. Apparently his meds didn't kick in to save his brain or his life.Yes, Mel Gibson might have over-acted as the father. But since it's fiction who are we to argue with that? I did enjoy the balcony scene where for a moment we thought he was going to jump. After all, he thought he'd killed his son. I was hoping he wouldn't jump, then again Shaker wouldn't have won either, but it didn't happen, which was a good thing.Rene Russo was wonderful as the mother, she had a more realistic charm  in the role, but likely wouldn't have faired as well against Sinise.Gary Sinise was wonderful in the movie as far as the crazy bad guy. He stands out more so in the movie since you're wondering what the heck set this guy off. He can play bad guys just as well as good guys (which is why I just love him in CSI: NY).As Shaker is talking/rambling on, we realize one thing, the motive. He wonderfully explains his motive--he saw criminals everyday getting off by buying their way out of trouble. Mullen had recently done so with the Jackie Brown deal. Since Mullen didn't mind paying to stay out of jail/prison, then why not pay to get his son back?Brawley Nolte did a wonderful job as Sean, and it does tug at your heartstrings to see how he was treated and then when he recognizes his kidnapper's voice.Donnie Wahlberg did a wonderful job as the only friend the kid seemed to have in the whole ordeal, and made him a promise that was eventually carried out.The rest of the cast were wonderful, and I wish I could remember all the actors in this movie.The FBI were portrayed as neutral, they were trying to help the Mullens get their son back, while the father decided to take things into his own hands.  At least it stayed away from ""the FBI saved the day"" plot. The movie played out on it's own, and could have been directed by anyone. The cast seemed to compliment each other.If you have DVR (and you're not paying any extra to record it), record it from a movie channel once, if you like buy it; if not, then save the money, and

420239,A1LF4NXBKM5W01,6304414145,marsdaman,"[0, 0]","Either Sinise's character is one of these obsessive-compulsive, ultraconservative tight wads as far as wasting money and/or wasting financial opportunities, he is a narcissistic and prideful maniac, he is as stubborn as a dog without the desire to eat, and/or he is one of the dumbest criminal masterminds to ever call himself an officer. Either way, average criminals would have seriously considered dumping the kid(releasing or killing him) after their partner was shot and killed by policemen. After this, he knew police were involved and that Gibson didn't follow orders. But to still be holding the kid after the bounty by Gibson(which should have been more to begin with--considering he owned an airline, cheapskate) was absolutely insane! Instead of collecting a seriously compartmentalized two million, the thug henchmen could have cut out the mastermind's share altogether or one of them could have gotten paid a mastermind's salary for thug work. The thing is that the thugs should have seen this as a sinking ship(when the ransom became a bounty) enough to go collect NOW and not let Sinise get wind of the fact that they wanted to do so. For one thing, Sinise was sure to get suspicious then paranoid that one or all of them was going to collect(he did when he shot and killed them). One of the thugs lost his brother in the heist and not receiving anything for something that he could never get back should have sounded too good to pass up. What if Sinise decided--as he later did, when the bounty doubled--to go it alone?! With the scenarios that I presented, Sinise should have decided to cut his losses and run to another job and, when he did not, the thugs should have took this as a warning and collected for themselves without letting him know how they were feeling. The bounty and then increasing bounty meant that they could no longer trust one another(situation had gotten critically hot). Ultimately, the ball was in Sinise's court, he could decide to cut his losses and run and, with revenge and anger for non-payment, Gibson was not going to see his child alive again. Any other decision by Sinise(either as a result of the thugs turning on him or him turning on them and collecting everything for himself), then Gibson's child lives. Once the partner got killed, Gibson had no other options open to him(either he was going to pay fruitlessly or he was going to offer up a bounty and have a 66 2/3%(2 out of 3) chance that his kid lives. Gibson's idea would not have been a good one, if things did not go so tragically wrong. However, he had no other choice at this point. I won't spoil the ending. This movie gets 4 out of 5 stars--not bc it wasn't an alltime great watchable movie, it is that--but it's only real limitation was how Gibson was playing chess and how all of the criminals were playing checkers. Gibson--even with the bounty--did not control his own destiny, but the criminals did. If Sinise decided that it was over, it was!

Howard helms a tense, literate script, without letting its potential maudlin come through.  Mel Gibson, who has &quot;ruined&quot; his career with the 350 million dollar+ gross of THE PASSION OF CHRIST (Notice tongue in cheek, folks) shows us what a powerfully commanding actor he can be.  His role as the tortured, yet committed, father is beautifully performed.  Mel doesn't parlay his looks into establishing his popularity.  The Australian is a very good actor, and in some ways, has never been recognized for the fact.  Rene Russo is amazing, too.  Starting off in a cool, I've got things under control aura, she melts into a desperate, crazed, and passionate woman who loves her husband dearly, but can't believe he's risking their son's life.  Gary Sinise once again brings a mercurial sense of villainy to his role as the mastermind behind the kidnapping, and his coldhearted murders only enforce his psychosis; Delroy Lindo as the head FBI agent gives a sturdy, tense and compassionate portrayal; Lili Taylor is devastating to watch as she crumbles under the pressure of her part in the kidnapping, but her cold hearted willignness to kill the little boy is frightening; Liv Schrieber and Donnie Wahlberg as the brothers are convincing, in view of their relatively little time on screen.I liked this film a lot because it touched my emotions in the way a thriller of this type should.

There is NO EXCUSE for the barrage of &quot;age related&quot; nicks, chips and scratches that are all over this visual presentation. Some films from the 1950s don't look this bad!!!

Tom is an airline owner, and his top priority in life is his family that includes his wife, Kate Mullen (Rene Russo), and one son, Sean Mullen (Brawley Nolte). Soon, an enemy of Tom Mullen and his gang are after Tom's money. To get what they want, which is about a million dollars, they kidnapp Tom's son, Sean, while the family is at a district science fair in their hometown of New York City. Tom and Kate are so desparate to find Sean and bring him back home that they will do just about anything in their power to bring Sean back alive and safe. All throughout the film, the guy who kidnapps Sean (I forget his name), tries to give Tom clues on how he can get his son back and where he is.

Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"") directs this, for the most part, gripping story with propulsion and the ability to gain nuanced performances from a disparate cast. The result is a tightly wound spring that coils tensely until the last fifteen minutes when the film explodes.  Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy man with a strong willed wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son Sean (Brawley Nolte, son of actor Nick Nolte). When Sean is kidnapped by an estranged detective named Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) and ransom is demanded, Tom goes before national TV audiences and doubles the ransom demand for a bounty on Shaker's life. How this turn of events of a kidnapper becoming the victim and the resolution of the kidnapping that results is the gist of the story: it is the struggle of good versus evil, citizen versus police, and calling the bluff of a dangerous man for the sake of a father saving his child.Gibson does well as the torn father, though director Howard allows him to go a bit over the edge, acting wise. The real shiner of this film is Gary Sinise who continues to impress with the facility with which he moves through varied character parts. Russo is moderately enjoyable as the supportive wife at the side of her husband, yet Delroy Lindo is the most explosive of the excellent supporting cast (featuring Liev Schriber, Donnie Walhberg, and Lili Taylor) as the detective hot on the case.  Ron Howard is clearly a director with talent and this is a cracking story, deserving of a modern update (it was originally made in the Fifties). He draws a fine performance from his cast and keeps the film exciting and taunt. Ransom, despite its flaws, is well worth checking out even if it is only to remember Gibson's good old days before he became an over-ambitious director with delusions of religious grandeur. A good cat and mouse tale that has at its core the heinous crime of kidnapping, police corruption, and family devotion.",3,Ransom  (1996),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2286,"['Director', 'Ron', 'HowardCast', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Brawley', 'Nolte', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg.Running', 'Time', '139', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'Ransom', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'extravaganza', 'movie', 'terrors', 'crime', 'kidnapping', 'twist', 'Ron', 'Howard', '13', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'most', 'part', 'gripping', 'story', 'propulsion', 'ability', 'gain', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'disparate', 'cast', 'result', 'tightly', 'wound', 'spring', 'tensely', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'when', 'film', 'explodes', 'Tom', 'Mullen', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'wealthy', 'man', 'strong', 'willed', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'son', 'Sean', 'Brawley', 'Nolte', 'son', 'actor', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'When', 'Sean', 'kidnapped', 'estranged', 'detective', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'Shaker', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'ransom', 'demanded', 'Tom', 'national', 'TV', 'audiences', 'ransom', 'demand', 'bounty', 'Shaker', 'life', 'How', 'turn', 'events', 'kidnapper', 'becoming', 'victim', 'resolution', 'kidnapping', 'results', 'gist', 'story', 'struggle', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'citizen', 'versus', 'police', 'calling', 'bluff', 'dangerous', 'man', 'sake', 'father', 'saving', 'child.Gibson', 'well', 'torn', 'father', 'director', 'Howard', 'go', 'bit', 'edge', 'acting', 'wise', 'real', 'shiner', 'film', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'who', 'impress', 'facility', 'varied', 'character', 'parts', 'Russo', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'supportive', 'wife', 'side', 'husband', 'yet', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'most', 'explosive', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Liev', 'Schriber', 'Donnie', 'Walhberg', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'detective', 'hot', 'case', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'clearly', 'director', 'talent', 'cracking', 'story', 'deserving', 'modern', 'update', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'Fifties', 'fine', 'performance', 'cast', 'film', 'exciting', 'taunt', 'Ransom', 'flaws', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'even', 'only', 'remember', 'Gibson', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'became', 'over-ambitious', 'director', 'delusions', 'religious', 'grandeur', 'good', 'cat', 'mouse', 'tale', 'core', 'heinous', 'crime', 'kidnapping', 'police', 'corruption', 'family', 'devotion']",Ransom VHS

But when the thing he cherishes most--his young son--is abducted by desperate criminals and held for ransom, Tom's world of affluence and privilege comes crashing down. And after an FBI rescue operation fails, he engineers a dangerous countermeasure in a last chance effort to bring his boy back to safety.
