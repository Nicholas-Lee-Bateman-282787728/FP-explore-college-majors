1695168,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00IZZDZFE,ahoffoss,"[2, 2]","Wow,...where to begin?!  I can understand some of these actors doing this movie, but not the others.  I decided to check this movie out due to the fact that Lacey Chabert was in this.  I'm a fan of her's and figured worse case scenario, at least she'd keep me interested.  No such luck there.  I was on the verge of cutting this off numerous times, but continued to force myself through it.  What I didn't understand was how they convinced some pretty decent actors to be involved in this movie?  I mean, how does Billy Zane go from Titanic to this?  It's not the fact that it's a low budget movie, it's the fact that it's so terrible you'd think his agents and friends would discourage him.  Is this a comedy, is it horror?  I'll tell you:  It's NEITHER!  It IS terrible, however!  The story is at dumb as it sounds.  Ok, that's fine because there are a lot of indie (and major) films that come out with bad ""stories"" but still have pretty good final products.  The only reason I'm not giving this a ONE is because most of the acting is good in it, if nothing else.  That deserves a little credit I figure.  Not that all the acting is good, but due to the balance of comedy/horror I honestly couldn't tell if the others were supposed to be bad or not?The story goes,...Alan (Billy Zane) owes a small indie movie studio that is run out of an old renovated house.  They have recently sold the property and are on verge of moving out when they arrive one morning to find an employee dead of an apparent ""accident"".  As they begin to learn more about the house's past, they soon realize there are some past actions that are coming back to haunt them.  Now with the exits all sealed shut, they have to fight to stay alive and try and get out before it's too late.It's not really that interesting of a story and the final version shows it.  Even with some really good acting (at times), it still can't be saved.Final Verdict:  Pass!",2,"I watched it,....so you don't have to!",1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,1927,"['Wow', 'where', 'begin', 'can', 'understand', 'actors', 'doing', 'movie', 'not', 'others', 'decided', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'due', 'fact', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'was', ""'m"", 'fan', 'figured', 'worse', 'case', 'scenario', 'least', ""'d"", 'keep', 'interested', 'such', 'luck', 'there', 'was', 'verge', 'cutting', 'off', 'numerous', 'times', 'continued', 'force', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'how', 'convinced', 'pretty', 'decent', 'actors', 'be', 'involved', 'movie', 'mean', 'how', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'go', 'Titanic', 'not', 'fact', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'fact', 'so', 'terrible', ""'d"", 'think', 'agents', 'friends', 'would', 'discourage', 'comedy', 'horror', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'terrible', 'however', 'story', 'dumb', 'Ok', 'fine', 'are', 'lot', 'indie', 'major', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'bad', 'stories', 'still', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'final', 'products', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'ONE', 'most', 'acting', 'good', 'nothing', 'else', 'little', 'credit', 'figure', 'Not', 'acting', 'good', 'due', 'balance', 'comedy/horror', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'others', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'story', 'Alan', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'small', 'indie', 'movie', 'studio', 'run', 'old', 'renovated', 'house', 'have', 'recently', 'sold', 'property', 'are', 'verge', 'moving', 'out', 'when', 'arrive', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'employee', 'dead', 'apparent', 'accident', 'begin', 'learn', 'more', 'house', 'past', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'past', 'actions', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'Now', 'exits', 'sealed', 'shut', 'have', 'fight', 'stay', 'alive', 'try', 'get', 'out', 'too', 'late.It', 'not', 'really', 'interesting', 'story', 'final', 'version', 'Even', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'times', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved.Final', 'Verdict', 'Pass']",Ghost of Goodnight Lane
1695169,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B00IZZDZFE,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]",I had high expectations for the movie given there were some great names in horror like Danielle Harris and Lacey. Billy Zane is pretty good actor adding him into the fray helped. I thought the acting was good. The story was good. It's not going to rank on a list of greatest horror movies ever but I rate this above average. The last one third of the movie was awesome. This is one of Harris's better horror movies in recent memory as she has been picking poor movies and getting too small parts. Her talents aren't wasted here. Some parts were scary and other parts were funny. I liked the combo of horror and comedy.It wasn't hard for Billy Zane to pull off playing a jerk but his character at times was funny and entertaining. Lacey was kind of understated and gave a good performances. I thought all the other actors did their parts well. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but the actors keep it going. I think I would recommend this for rental first. I think it's an underrated film. Harris fans should check it out. Fans of ghost stories will enjoy this. Give this one a shot!

1695170,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00IZZDZFE,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[7, 8]","I get slagged a lot for either being too easy on films or too picky &#8211; which, at the end of the day, can only really mean that there&#8217;s no way to please all readers.  I&#8217;ve often promoted the smaller releases &#8211; exactly the kind of film that GHOST OF GOODNIGHT LANE is and tries to be &#8211; because they&#8217;re a reasonable alternative to the latest bloated-budget craptacular available for your viewing pleasure (or displeasure).  No, GHOST isn&#8217;t perfect, and here&#8217;s the dirty little secret: it probably was never meant to be.  You want to escape for 90 minutes?  Then it&#8217;s right up your alley.More after the break &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;In a Dallas film studio the actors and crew of a horror film become the victims of their own bloody horror story.  One by one, they are killed off by a vengeful ghost who seems to be re-enacting some of the scariest moments in the history of film.  As the director (Billy Zane) and his pretty actresses begin to piece together a forty year old puzzle, it may be too late for them all.  The key to their freedom is held by a creepy old woman who reveals a murder mystery with a shocking and sinister twist.&#8221;So very much of GHOST OF GOODNIGHT LANE is handled exactly the way it should be: very tongue-in-cheek.  The story as described above pokes an awful lot of fun at the conventions of mainstream horror movies, and writer/director Alin Bijan manages to imbue about fifty percent of it with what I&#8217;d call an almost &#8216;Scooby Doo&#8217; vibe: nothing is meant to make perfect sense &#8211; after all, half the fun of your average horror flick is just sitting and waiting for the most likely suspects to become the next victim &#8211; and (most definitely) none of it is meant to be taken seriously.  This is the world of ghosts and demons and old crones and creepy children and other things that go bump in the night; what you think is Billy Zane&#8217;s tired expression for contracting into yet one more direct-to-DVD release is actually Billy Zane acting like a disenfranchised direct-to-DVD film producer/director who&#8217;s about at the end of his wits with the business.To my surprise, GHOST was actually very entertaining.  If you&#8217;re paying attention, the script is smart enough to poke holes in half of the ideas it toys with visually; but &#8211; out of quintessential respect for the genre &#8211; it still manages to serve up more than a fair share of good old-fashioned scares alongside some obvious post-production camera trickery.  For example, watch for Zane to misinterpret a video snippet of the young ghost when he cracks, &#8220;Is that CGI?  I didn&#8217;t authorize that!&#8221;The rest of the cast is rounded out by a roster of familiar faces, especially ones who&#8217;ve made their mark in smaller cinema (like that that this film represents); and they each turn up, hit their marks, and (I suspect) have fun with the material.  Matt Dallas tries to be the calming force behind so much of the chaos.  Danielle Harris is the good-girl-gone-bad in order to pay the rent.  Richard Tyson shows up in the opening segment to set this grand affair in motion.  And the lovely Lacey Chabert &#8211; a gal who only grows more and more fetching with each opportunity &#8211; is the good-girl-who-stays-good hell bent on uncovering the mystery behind all of this and bringing this GHOST&#8217;s glory days to a fitting and timely end.GHOST OF GOODNIGHT LANE (2014) is produced by FTG Media, Media World Studios, and Media World Television.  DVD distribution is being handled by Inception Media Group.  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly assembled piece of work, and the producers have spared no expense in serving up some pretty high quality sights and sounds, as well as some modestly impressive digital and in-camera horror effects work.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re looking for &#8211; then prepare to be disappointed as there&#8217;s nothing extra.RECOMMENDED.  Sometimes the only way to endorse a movie these days is to pony up the simplest explanation possible: (A) it didn&#8217;t suck, and (B) it actually kept my interest.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with such quality craftsmanship with these smaller releases; that&#8217;s precisely why you&#8217;re drawn to them when you find them on the shelves of your corner video store (assuming they&#8217;re still in business), and you give &#8216;em a chance to &#8216;wow&#8217; you for 90 minutes.  Trust me: you could do far worse.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Inception Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of GHOST OF GOODNIGHT LANE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",3,Better Than Average GHOST Turns Out Some Great

Up to that point, the film looked like it might be interesting... you see that footage in the trailer, but oh boy, does it go down hill from there. None of his friends seem to care one bit that he is dead, and it's back to work as usual working on low budget films being made in their ...house?! The owner is thinking about selling but things start to happen as doors calmly close and work desk stationary begins to move a couple of inches, gripping stuff alright! Now with the movie crew and cast in a ...house... with an angry ghost, they manage to preform possibly the worst acting job of 2014!Don't be fooled by the fact that Bill Zane is in this. His acting here is terrible. I think he phones most of it in, and extremely poor at that. You can really tell he's just doing this for the money and knows the movie is going to flop. The girl from Party of 5 adds nothing, and everyone else is a virtual unknown who I will be surprised if their careers can come back after this stinker. The acting reminded me of Debbie Does Dallas in some parts, and others as bad and irritating as watching that ridiculous staff meeting thing on TMZ. The visual effects are laughable, and for those saying this film made them laugh, it's not intentional, which is why I'm not going to give this film more stars because I found it so bad it was unintentionally funny, I found it irritating as you just wanna sit back with these sorts of things and see people get picked off one by one, not be bored to death with pointless interactions by characters you could not care less about before you see a tiny special effect that was not scary in the slightest, and then more pointless dialogs rammed down your neck.Overall... it's not the most low budget film imaginable, it tried with the visual effects, but everything apart from the editing and sound department have cost this movie from being even considered half decent. Horrible script, acting, plot, pace, story and the attempt at a surprise end of whom the ghost is the daughter of... horribly executed, and I just did not care, and it did not make up for the boredom I was going through, struggling to get through this thing, hoping it will get better.Don't bother.... it's rated 4.4 of 10 on IMDB with just over 320 votes so far... so that outta tell you, the film is avoidable and not a must see, that has left most people disappointed.

The editing of the film is set in a studio located in a haunted house. One of the scenes has to be reshot which requires the dancers to come back.The ghost scenes were done very well, but the dry one liners spouted by Billy Zane kept this film from having a great scare factor, instead it had a decent comedy value. While this film was in no way a spoof, it did seem to spoof the genre in general.The worse part of the film was it didn't tie in to the woman's warning that &#34;childish games can turn ugly.&#34; There was an implication there was a hide and seek game turned bad, but that was not the case as childish games were never part of the flashbacks or the film.
