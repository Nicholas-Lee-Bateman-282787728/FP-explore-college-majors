1507802,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B0060MYMPG,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[6, 6]","""The Killing: Season Two"" (On-Demand DVD-R)(20th Century Fox, 2013)I am giving this five stars out of respect for the creative team and the show itself.  Detectives Linder and Holden are compelling, offbeat characters, and the show has a moody, deliberate tone that is great to see in an American-made TV show. If you like the ""Wallander"" series, you'll like this, too. This second season was a satisfying conclusion to the plotline of Season One... It may have gone on a little longer than necessary, but along the way we saw some interesting character development, and the second half of this season had several exciting, tense, unusual episodes. It's a quality show, and I'm glad to hear that it's been renewed for a third season.However, I agree with all the other reviews that are critical of the cheap, cheesy manufacturing of the Amazon-pressed DVD-Rs that are meant to replace a proper DVD/Blu-Ray release. Amazon and other companies are moving to a download/streaming video-only model, which provides tremendous profits for them, but is a bad deal for consumers.I do not like non-physical media, both because it takes power away from consumers and because the quality of the video streams and downloads is vastly inferior to that of physical media. I don't like it, and there are shows that I love, like ""Project Runway,"" that I have dropped because they went to a download-only format. I'm not going to pay that much money for something that only exists in the ""cloud"" and that is so inconvenient to use. The studios and Amazon are losing my business because they are charging way too much for a flawed, awkward product that I cannot easily reuse or watch with friends.I appreciate that they made this show in a format I can use, but the low quality and lack of care that went into this DVD-R release is pretty shocking. The discs themselves are fragile and scratch easily. The plastic case was incredibly flimsy, and contained no written material at all - no production notes, etc. And the discs themselves contain no special or bonus features. Personally, I don't care about behind-the-scenes material, but the lack of subtitles was a big problem. A lot of people (myself included) really need subtitles and to not include them in this day and age is simply insulting to consumers. I'm glad I got to see the conclusion of this fine show, but the careless, poorly made physical edition was disrespectful to consumers and left a bad taste in my mouth. If this becomes the norm, I won't buy it.

1507807,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0060MYMPG,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","First off, ignore the reviews on here talking about poor quality dvds and such because I just purchased this set April 2014 and the dvds are beautiful and close to bluray quality. Buy away... you won't regret it.Show review:If you like your murder-mystery-suspense television hoakie, unrealistic, contrived and relentlessly stupid, then tune into the over-hyped and baffling to me that it is still on the air, ""The Following"". If you prefer it realistic, thought-provoking and haunting than get this wrongfully shortened television series in any form and see first hand how television networks are bamboozled by ratings and misguided executives who wouldn't know quality if it crawled up their rear-end and died.Season 2 is the continuation and conclusion to the mystery that was the soul-focus of season 1; who killed Rosie Larson. Mireille Enos plays Sarah Linden, a homicide detective that is juggling being a single parent to a teenage boy and her passion and inability to release herself from the solving of the crime. Her partner Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman, Robocop), is a recovering drug addict with a tact that can only be described as brave, dirty and questionable. On their shoulders is the establishment around them. Plaguing their every move are all the things that plaque every murder case that ever happens; corruption, red tape, politicians and their grotesque desire to not look bad in any light, the public's endless desire and immediate need for answers and the media's endless desire to satisfy their needs regardless if it's the truth or not.""The Killing"" is a brilliantly thought out television show with patient story-telling that has you watching every single moment as if it may or may not be integral to the mystery. Not only that, it takes the times to dive deep into the heart of every single character, giving you insight into how they tick and it does it in a slow meticulous way that keeps you hanging on every word.When shows like ""The Killing"" are dismissed and shows like ""The Following"" are given the red carpet treatment, it is a sad day for television. While I think the rating system is a sham that favors the major networks heavily and that needs to change for the sake of intelligent quality television, we are partly to blame because we don't have to bite on the worm/hook. Bottom line though, Season 1 & 2 of ""The Killing"" are hands down some of the best television to ever grace our living rooms and there should be a documentary about who killed ""The Killing"".

I've managed to see & purchase both seasons and can't imagine stopping at season 1 for any reason because the show is SO great! As many other reviewers before me have eloquently said this show is like ""The Wire"" in that it requires an investment of time & energy to follow all the characters and story lines but the 'reward' is rich & satisfying like few shows I've ever seen.What I loved so much about this show was how nuanced and profound many of the scenes are. The show reveals the depth of character not only for the Cops investigating Rosie Larsen's murder, but it spends a great deal of time on her grieving family. The scene where Rosie's father calls her cellphone weeks after she has died to confess his shortcomings, is typical of this gut wrenching story as it unfolds. While some viewers were upset that it took 2 full seasons to reveal Rosie's killer, I found the journey rich and very satisfying and wouldn't change a thing about the show.

1507828,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0060MYMPG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[52, 55]","Note: Unfortunately, this set did not receive an official DVD release available in stores.  This offer is for MOD (manufacture-on-demand) only and the three disc set will be pressed onto DVD-R media when you order it.  There are no Special Features for this reason.When Season One of ""The Killing"" premiered on AMC, it was an instant critical darling.  An adaptation of a successful Danish television series, it was an intense and quiet show with a slow build drama that got under your skin.  Those eager for easy answers and constant action might have needed to look elsewhere because the pace of ""The Killing"" was more akin to the unraveling of a fine novel than to that of a breakneck thriller.  In the premiere episode, a young girl named Rosie Larsen was found murdered.  Each episode represented one day following three distinct story threads.  We saw the investigation progress, we examined the painful aftermath on the girl's family and friends, and we reflected on how the murder might be tied to local politicians and bigwigs.  But despite its critical praise, which included six EMMY nominations (including Lead Actress Mireille Enos and Supporting Actress Michelle Forbes), the first season ended on a note of controversy.  Fans felt betrayed that all of the answers into the mystery were not revealed and their vitriol was quite vocal!  (Strangely enough, the show was canceled and then uncanceled and Season Three is on its way to TV).Season Two, consisting of another 13 episodes, picks up directly where the first season concluded.  Enos and her partner (an invaluable Joel Kinnaman) are now at odds after the season finale revelations.  If anything, though, she is even more obsessed with finding the truth.  As she doggedly pursues the investigation, it alienates her further from the department.  Mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) is facing a new set of obstacles, also due to the events of last season.  Seemingly out of the race, he will prove that he still has the stuff to be a major political player in the city.  And the Larsen clan is in tatters, with mother (Forbes) on a spiritual sojourn and father (Brent Sexton) left to hold the family together.  The three plot strands will weave in and out of one another as Enos follows the leads.  Was Rosie a call girl? Is her death related to the suspicious activities of a local Indian casino? Was there a political motivation for her demise?  Or was it something closer to home?  This time, all will be revealed.""The Killing"" continues to take its time, and the case takes a number of false turns before arriving at its final destination.  There certainly are a lot of nefarious and unscrupulous characters in the Seattle area!  Truthfully, I don't disagree that two seasons for this one case seemed to stretch the limits of what was necessary.  But there are some tense and memorable moments throughout these episodes.  I'm glad I stuck around for Season Two.  In addition to smart scripts, the cast is absolutely first rate.  Enos is fortitude personified, Kinnaman gives a star-making performance, Campbell is surprisingly strong, and Sexton is a powerhouse.  I also liked that supporting players Kristin Lehman and Eric Ladin (as Campbell's staff) really come into their own.  Perhaps the show's most unorthodox choice, however, is with Forbes.  Continuing to explore the stages of grief, this tremendous performance is sidelined from the rest of the principle cast for most of the season.  It's a bold choice, but I could watch Forbes all day!  ""The Killing"" is an adult entertainment that requires patience and rewards it.  If you enjoyed the first season despite its inconclusiveness, I really recommend Season Two.

After AMC decided to cancel the series (a cancellation that obviously did not last) it decided not to release a season set.  Amazon basically decided to burn the series onto DVD-R discs for those who want a non-instant video version.  Unlike season one which got a DVD and Blu Ray release with special features, commentary tracks and captioning, this is just the 12 episodes on three discs.  Nothing else aside from a 4min video blog from Rosie as the only special feature.  The DVD set itself gets zero stars.As for the second season itself, it was well acted, for most of the story, well written, and brought closure to the ""Who Killed Rosie Larsen"" story.  The season starts with Linden believing Holder to be a dirty cop, Richmond suffering through the aftermath of the shooting that is teased as the cliffhanger to season 1, and the case essentially in a state of disarray.  As in the first season there is a lot of misdirection.  This is where the story can be compared to Twin Peaks in that it keeps you guessing, and all is not known until 10 min before the last episode ends.  You are meant to think that the murder was a giant conspiracy and ultimately find out is was a matter of wrong place wrong time.  My only real bone of contention with the story was the very end reveal of who actually put the car in the lake.  Although that person was teased to be involved when you looked back on how the character acted in parts of the season, the reason behind putting the car in the lake was flimsy at best.  Also, there absolutely should have been another person charged in the crime who was at the lake that was just let off entirely.  It just seemed like they were trying to go for such a shocker ending, but it came off as trying to be too clever instead.The other main part of the season revolved around Linden's personal life and the other case that was hinted to in season one and became the focus of the third season after AMC resurrected the series.  One of the stand out episodes in the season was 72 hours, in which Linden is put in a psych ward under false pretenses, and sets the ground work for that story.  Mireille Enos did a wonderful job in that episode showing just how flawed Linden is.The DVD release does not give you much of anything.  If you are one of those who only gets DVDs when there is great bonus content then you probably want to skip this and stick with the instant video.  For those of you who bought the first season either on blu ray or DVD and want this to complete the set, just know you are getting the barest of bare bones.  No features, deleted scenes, commentary, language options or close captioning.  If you can get past that however, the series is great and worth watching.",4,"Great show, awful season 2 release.",1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,3043,"['Caution', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilerish', 'material', 'season', '2', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'stop', 'now.I', 'gave', 'set', '4', 'stars', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'did', 'fall', 'love', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'misdirection', 'angle', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'bad', 'AMC', 'decided', 'cancel', 'series', 'cancellation', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'decided', 'not', 'release', 'season', 'set', 'Amazon', 'basically', 'decided', 'burn', 'series', 'DVD-R', 'discs', 'who', 'want', 'non-instant', 'video', 'version', 'season', 'one', 'got', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'captioning', 'just', '12', 'episodes', 'three', 'discs', 'Nothing', 'else', 'aside', '4min', 'video', 'blog', 'Rosie', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'set', 'zero', 'stars.As', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'brought', 'closure', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Rosie', 'Larsen', 'story', 'season', 'Linden', 'believing', 'Holder', 'be', 'dirty', 'cop', 'Richmond', 'suffering', 'aftermath', 'shooting', 'teased', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '1', 'case', 'essentially', 'state', 'disarray', 'first', 'season', 'lot', 'misdirection', 'where', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'guessing', 'not', 'known', '10', 'min', 'last', 'episode', 'ends', 'are', 'meant', 'think', 'murder', 'was', 'giant', 'conspiracy', 'ultimately', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'matter', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'only', 'real', 'bone', 'contention', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'reveal', 'who', 'actually', 'put', 'car', 'lake', 'person', 'was', 'teased', 'be', 'involved', 'when', 'looked', 'back', 'how', 'character', 'acted', 'parts', 'season', 'reason', 'putting', 'car', 'lake', 'was', 'flimsy', 'best', 'Also', 'absolutely', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'person', 'charged', 'crime', 'who', 'was', 'lake', 'was', 'just', 'let', 'off', 'entirely', 'just', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'go', 'shocker', 'ending', 'came', 'off', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'clever', 'instead.The', 'other', 'main', 'part', 'season', 'revolved', 'around', 'Linden', 'personal', 'life', 'other', 'case', 'was', 'hinted', 'season', 'one', 'became', 'focus', 'third', 'season', 'AMC', 'resurrected', 'series', 'One', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', '72', 'hours', 'Linden', 'put', 'psych', 'ward', 'false', 'pretenses', 'ground', 'work', 'story', 'Mireille', 'Enos', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'episode', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'flawed', 'Linden', 'is.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'give', 'much', 'anything', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'only', 'DVDs', 'when', 'great', 'bonus', 'content', 'then', 'probably', 'want', 'skip', 'stick', 'instant', 'video', 'who', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'either', 'blu', 'ray', 'DVD', 'want', 'complete', 'set', 'just', 'know', 'are', 'getting', 'barest', 'bare', 'bones', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'language', 'options', 'close', 'captioning', 'can', 'get', 'however', 'series', 'great', 'worth', 'watching']",The Killing: Season 2
1507832,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B0060MYMPG,ocarolan,"[0, 0]","Spoilers follow, but none that identity the killer.My problem with this series is that I found little of it believable. That starts with the two main characters, Linden and Holder: they neither looked nor behaved like real detectives. At the core of this opinion is the fact they seemed not to understand that identifying the perpetrator is only half of their job; that amassing evidence that will be admissible in court is the other half. Search warrants; chain of custody of evidence: They haven&#8217;t a clue about any of it.Neither was the plot believable. Take, for example, the absence of consequences that most assuredly would have obtained in the real world. Case in point: Holder knowingly introduced a doctored image into evidence that led to the arrest of an innocent man, a man of some political weight, which in turn led to that man&#8217;s being shot and rendered a paraplegic. What happened to Holder as a result? Nothing! Effectively, it was ignored: by the police, by the DA&#8217;s office, by Holder, and by Linden. Later, Holder was nearly beaten to death by the security goons at an Indian casino and left in a wooded area to die. A massive police search found him in time. What happened to the perpetrators, whom Holder can identify? Nada. Holder&#8217;s boss blew it off by saying that any effort to pursue charges would just have resulted in a suit by the casino. Are you kidding? A brutal assault of a police officer, and this guy is worried about a civil suit? Oh, I forgot: his boss is part of The Conspiracy. How could Holder&#8217;s boss possibly have hidden the massive search for Holder from his bosses or from the press? It&#8217;s preposterous.If that makes no sense, consider this. Linden finally got a search warrant for the casino, and during the search she found (drum roll!) The Critical Piece of Evidence. Did she alert the search team to her find, thus establishing where the evidence was found and preserving the chain of custody of the evidence? No! She kept its discovery from everyone, telling Holder about it only later; after flashing her find &#8211; in a juvenile gothcha gesture &#8211; for the security camera of the casino&#8217;s elevator. Pretty professional, eh? Yes, you found the ID card, but it means nothing, because it will never make it into a courtroom, because nobody witnessed its being found where you say it was found. If you can believe nonsense like this, you&#8217;ve come to the right series.I mentioned conspiracy. I find conspiracies often to be a contrivance of lazy writers: a writer can make just about anything happen in a story by making the conspiracy extensive enough. And in this series a lot of people, in law enforcement and in politics, are involved in the conspiracy, though their motivation for risking their careers and prison time, other than to keep the plot in motion, is never clear.Slogging through just one season of this sort of stuff to learn the identity of Rosie Larsen&#8217;s killer would have been heroic; slogging through two seasons is masochistic.",2,A review of Season Two; not the DVD format,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,3048,"['Spoilers', 'follow', 'none', 'identity', 'killer.My', 'problem', 'series', 'found', 'little', 'believable', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Linden', 'Holder', 'looked', 'behaved', 'real', 'detectives', 'core', 'opinion', 'fact', 'seemed', 'not', 'understand', 'identifying', 'perpetrator', 'only', 'half', 'job', 'amassing', 'evidence', 'will', 'be', 'admissible', 'court', 'other', 'half', 'Search', 'warrants', 'chain', 'custody', 'evidence', 'haven', '8217', 'clue', 'it.Neither', 'was', 'plot', 'believable', 'Take', 'example', 'absence', 'consequences', 'most', 'assuredly', 'would', 'have', 'obtained', 'real', 'world', 'Case', 'point', 'Holder', 'knowingly', 'introduced', 'doctored', 'image', 'evidence', 'led', 'arrest', 'innocent', 'man', 'man', 'political', 'weight', 'turn', 'led', 'man', '8217', 'being', 'shot', 'rendered', 'paraplegic', 'What', 'happened', 'Holder', 'result', 'Nothing', 'Effectively', 'was', 'ignored', 'police', 'DA', '8217', 's', 'office', 'Holder', 'Linden', 'Later', 'Holder', 'was', 'nearly', 'beaten', 'death', 'security', 'goons', 'Indian', 'casino', 'left', 'wooded', 'area', 'die', 'massive', 'police', 'search', 'found', 'time', 'What', 'happened', 'perpetrators', 'whom', 'Holder', 'can', 'identify', 'Nada', 'Holder', '8217', 'off', 'saying', 'effort', 'pursue', 'charges', 'would', 'just', 'have', 'resulted', 'suit', 'casino', 'Are', 'kidding', 'brutal', 'assault', 'police', 'officer', 'guy', 'worried', 'civil', 'suit', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'boss', 'part', 'Conspiracy', 'How', 'could', 'Holder', '8217', 'possibly', 'have', 'hidden', 'massive', 'search', 'Holder', 'bosses', 'press', '8217', 'preposterous.If', 'sense', 'consider', 'Linden', 'finally', 'got', 'search', 'warrant', 'casino', 'search', 'found', 'drum', 'roll', 'Critical', 'Piece', 'Evidence', 'Did', 'alert', 'search', 'team', 'find', 'thus', 'establishing', 'where', 'evidence', 'was', 'found', 'preserving', 'chain', 'custody', 'evidence', 'No', 'kept', 'discovery', 'everyone', 'telling', 'Holder', 'only', 'later', 'flashing', 'find', '8211', 'juvenile', 'gothcha', 'gesture', '8211', 'security', 'camera', 'casino', '8217', 's', 'elevator', 'Pretty', 'professional', 'eh', 'Yes', 'found', 'ID', 'card', 'nothing', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'courtroom', 'nobody', 'witnessed', 'being', 'found', 'where', 'say', 'was', 'found', 'can', 'believe', 'nonsense', '8217', 'come', 'right', 'series.I', 'mentioned', 'conspiracy', 'find', 'conspiracies', 'often', 'be', 'contrivance', 'lazy', 'writers', 'writer', 'can', 'make', 'just', 'anything', 'happen', 'story', 'making', 'conspiracy', 'extensive', 'enough', 'series', 'lot', 'people', 'law', 'enforcement', 'politics', 'are', 'involved', 'conspiracy', 'motivation', 'risking', 'careers', 'prison', 'time', 'other', 'keep', 'plot', 'motion', 'never', 'clear.Slogging', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'sort', 'stuff', 'learn', 'identity', 'Rosie', 'Larsen', '8217', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'heroic', 'slogging', 'two', 'seasons', 'masochistic']",The Killing: Season 2

Titles that probably wouldn't be put out on dvd on a normal retail capacity. The quality of the set is fine. Sure it might not be as polished as a normal studio release but the video quality and sound are up to par and look great. The dvds also have artwork on them so they look like a normal release. They don't have the protective layer that normal high quality dvds have so that means take extra care of them when playing them. Still I had no scratches on the discs as I take great care of my dvds.
