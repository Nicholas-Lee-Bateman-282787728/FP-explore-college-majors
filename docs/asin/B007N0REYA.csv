Most of the reviews for this one weren't kind, and I wish I could say that it's a misunderstood masterpiece, but I just can't. It lacks action, and suspense, and it doesn't seem like a Full Moon movie overall. It seems more like the kind of movie that Dark Castle would have released a decade ago. It does have good make-up and effects.

1534792,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B007N0REYA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","If The Dead Want Women is any indication, Charles Band and Full Moon should be permanently put out to pasture.  The only thing this film has going for it is the fact that the two lead actresses are attractive - everything else is just pathetic.  For starters, the prologue takes an excruciating twenty-five minutes (out of about only seventy minutes of actual movie content) to play out, and the theme of repetitive, ridiculously drawn out lines established therein continues once the movie shifts to the present day.  Second, the film star ghosts are terrible caricatures of, respectively, an old western B-star, a horror actor, and - most annoying of all - some weird combination of Fatty Arbuckle, W.C. Fields, and Curly Howard.  Rarely have such insipid lines of inane dialogue been delivered in such a wooden fashion.  The penultimate nail in the film's coffin, though, is the ending, which is a total cop-out that will make you want to throw heavy things at the screen.Back in the 1920s, silent screen goddess Rose Pettigrew liked to throw big soirees at her home - but the real action took place in a secret room where three of her film star buddies would have their way with young women.  Then the talkies came along and ended Rose's career - and she didn't take it very well.  The house has sat vacant ever since.  That's why two young female real estate agents are so excited about having finally sold the place.  Unfortunately, they soon learn that the house isn't exactly vacant after all.I'm not sure there is such a thing as an Eric Roberts fan, but you can't possibly be one after watching his atrocious performance here.  The Dead Want Women is cinematic trash.  I feel sorry for Jessica Morris and Ariana Madix because they aren't terrible actresses - but there's no way they'll ever be able to undue the stain this film will leave on their careers.",1,Charles Band hits yet another new low,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1866,"['Dead', 'Want', 'Women', 'indication', 'Charles', 'Band', 'Full', 'Moon', 'should', 'be', 'permanently', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'fact', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'are', 'attractive', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'pathetic', 'starters', 'prologue', 'excruciating', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'only', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'actual', 'movie', 'content', 'play', 'out', 'theme', 'repetitive', 'ridiculously', 'drawn', 'out', 'lines', 'established', 'therein', 'movie', 'shifts', 'present', 'day', 'Second', 'film', 'star', 'ghosts', 'are', 'terrible', 'caricatures', 'respectively', 'old', 'western', 'B-star', 'horror', 'actor', 'most', 'annoying', 'weird', 'combination', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'Rarely', 'have', 'such', 'insipid', 'lines', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'been', 'delivered', 'such', 'wooden', 'fashion', 'penultimate', 'nail', 'film', 'coffin', 'ending', 'total', 'cop-out', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'throw', 'heavy', 'things', 'screen.Back', '1920s', 'silent', 'screen', 'goddess', 'Rose', 'Pettigrew', 'liked', 'throw', 'big', 'soirees', 'home', 'real', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'secret', 'room', 'where', 'three', 'film', 'star', 'buddies', 'would', 'have', 'way', 'young', 'women', 'Then', 'talkies', 'came', 'along', 'ended', 'Rose', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'well', 'house', 'sat', 'vacant', 'ever', 'why', 'two', 'young', 'female', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'are', 'so', 'excited', 'having', 'finally', 'sold', 'place', 'Unfortunately', 'soon', 'learn', 'house', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'vacant', 'all.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'such', 'thing', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'one', 'watching', 'atrocious', 'performance', 'here', 'Dead', 'Want', 'Women', 'cinematic', 'trash', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Jessica', 'Morris', 'Ariana', 'Madix', 'are', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'actresses', 'way', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'undue', 'stain', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'careers']",N/A

So every year when October rolls around and I get even more into watching all my horror films. True I watch them all year long but Halloween time makes them just a little more special. I wish I could say that this film is just as special but sadly it is not. This for a Full Moon film is average at best, I love these types of flicks but it just fell flat most of the time.The story is about a silent movie star who is having one of the best nights of her life. Her career is going great and all her friends are at her house for a party. All of that is great until she is informed that her contract with the studio is being cancelled. The new age of talking pictures has stopped her career cold. In receiving this information she kills her entourage as well as herself condemning them to a life stuck in that house. Fast forward to the here and now and two female relaters are excited to be selling the old house. After meeting there to finalize the deal with the new buyer the women are attacked by the long thought gone inhabitants of the house. What's worse is they may be a part of something bigger.It is easy to see what director Charles Band was going for here, that old school Hollywood look and feel. As for the overall feeling of the film I think he accomplished that. Still this film just falls flat even with band accomplishing what he wanted to. The story is cool enough story but it wasn't executed correctly I guess. As for the acting it is exactly what it should have been for this type of flick but even that feels out of place in a film where it should have been right at home. Everything about this flick is cheesy B movie badness, oh how I wish it was cheesy B movie goodness. Even with Eric Roberts it is a bit of a let down.The zombie makeup is good for this kind of flick but they look more ghoul/demon like then zombie like. Still I take that as a good thing as I do with the other thing this movie did right, the ladies. Well not just the ladies but the ladies and the lack of their clothes. For a good portion of this movie it is almost a porno at one point as the silent starlet and her crew are into some very freaky things. So over this entire movie isn't all bad, I would have loved a Videozone for this. That would have been excellent, or maybe a commentary from Band himself.",3,COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER.,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2410,"['DEAD', 'WANT', 'WOMENI', 'am', 'huge', 'Full', 'Moon', 'fan', 'own', 'most', 'films', 'not', 'form', 'So', 'year', 'when', 'October', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'watching', 'horror', 'films', 'True', 'watch', 'year', 'long', 'Halloween', 'time', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'special', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'film', 'just', 'special', 'sadly', 'not', 'Full', 'Moon', 'film', 'average', 'best', 'love', 'types', 'flicks', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'most', 'time.The', 'story', 'silent', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'having', 'one', 'best', 'nights', 'life', 'career', 'going', 'great', 'friends', 'are', 'house', 'party', 'great', 'informed', 'contract', 'studio', 'being', 'cancelled', 'new', 'age', 'talking', 'pictures', 'stopped', 'career', 'cold', 'receiving', 'information', 'entourage', 'as', 'well', 'condemning', 'life', 'stuck', 'house', 'Fast', 'forward', 'here', 'now', 'two', 'female', 'relaters', 'are', 'excited', 'be', 'selling', 'old', 'house', 'meeting', 'there', 'finalize', 'deal', 'new', 'buyer', 'women', 'are', 'attacked', 'long', 'thought', 'gone', 'inhabitants', 'house', 'What', 'worse', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'bigger.It', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Charles', 'Band', 'was', 'going', 'here', 'old', 'school', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'feel', 'overall', 'feeling', 'film', 'think', 'accomplished', 'Still', 'film', 'just', 'flat', 'even', 'band', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'wanted', 'story', 'cool', 'enough', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'executed', 'correctly', 'guess', 'acting', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'type', 'flick', 'even', 'place', 'film', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'home', 'Everything', 'flick', 'cheesy', 'B', 'movie', 'badness', 'how', 'wish', 'was', 'cheesy', 'B', 'movie', 'goodness', 'Even', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'bit', 'let', 'down.The', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'good', 'kind', 'flick', 'look', 'more', 'ghoul/demon', 'then', 'zombie', 'Still', 'take', 'good', 'thing', 'do', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'right', 'ladies', 'Well', 'not', 'just', 'ladies', 'ladies', 'lack', 'clothes', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'almost', 'porno', 'one', 'point', 'silent', 'starlet', 'crew', 'are', 'very', 'freaky', 'things', 'So', 'entire', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'Videozone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'maybe', 'commentary', 'Band']",N/A

Man he went from B+ to a C- with this one. To start off the story is a very loosely tied together ghost story. The best parts of the movie was all of the nudity & sexual content. In the beginning you have porno level girl on girl (face to special place) & throughout the movie one of the girls is naked the whole time. The two real estate chicks act like they're in a porno but, you never really get to see either of them naked. Well, one of them gets their shirt torn off but, you never really get to see her boobs and later her shirt goes from being in her hand to her wearing it without holding it (should have just had her running around topless). All nudity aside, this movie was terrible. I've seen better acting in a porno which, with the lack of a workable plot & all of the nudity it would qualify for a soft-core porn.
