918623,A2O91YORQH16L5,B000A1OFYQ,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[2, 2]","During recent weekends, I had spent some leisure time to watch three action movies on cable television.The three movies shared a common thread: the principal character was more or less a lone wolf operative, with military background; trained in covert operations & skilled in weaponry.Although they did not have the plot intensity or complexity when compared with any of the recent 'Bourne' or even 'Bond' movies, they were generally entertaining.For me, entertainment comes first when I watch a movie.The first one was 'Target'.The second was 'Avenger'.The third was 'Marksman', starring my favourite action hero, Wesley Snipes.I had watched many of Wesley Snipes' action movies: '7 Seconds', the 'Blade' trilogy, 'Art of War', 'US Marshalls', 'Drop Zone', 'Money Train', 'Demolition Man', 'The Detonator', 'Murder @1600', 'Rising Sun', 'Passenger 57' & 'Unstoppable'.One of the reasons I like to watch him in action movies is because he is trained as a martial artist in real life.In 'Marksman', he played an army ranger with the code name: Painter. His job was to mark out targets on the ground in preparation for directed missile strikes.A group of Chechen rebels had taken over a supposedly decommissioned nuclear plant inside Russia. Together with a team of army rangers, his job was to go in & rescue the scientists. It was meant to be a simple extraction job. However, it turned out that there was a complex agenda behind the rescue & the mission was unexpectedly compromised.The rescue helicopter was blown up. A few rangers were killed on board. The remaining rangers were captured on the ground by the Chechen rebels, with the exception of Painter & another ranger, who managed to escape.Painter realised that the original mission would have sparked off an inadvertent thermonuclear war between Russia & the United States.The remaining segment of the movie showed how Painter, using his instincts, outsmarted & outmanoeuvred the rebels to find out the truth & also to rescue their captured buddies.The high-octane, explosive action sequences were beautifully choreographed, as Painter made a crafty manoeuvre to elude the well-armed rebels in one particular scene, & together with the other escaped ranger, mounted a daring rescue of their captured buddies near the nuclear plant, in another scene.The final ending sequence was also good as well as gripping, as Painter rushed, under extreme time pressures, to remark the target for a directed missile strike.There were some aspects of the story that intrigued me: it was hard to imagine that Russia would allow army rangers from the United States to operate inside their territory, not discounting the fact that US carrier-based aircrafts had also to navigate Russian air space to reach their targets.Nevertheless, for me, I had really enjoyed watching this action movie.

918629,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000A1OFYQ,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 2]","I haven't seen nearly every Wesley Snipes movie ever made, so I can't speak for his entire filmography, but in my experience, this is definitely the worst starring vehicle of his that I've watched. Apparently, a lot of this one's lackluster quality can be blamed on problems in production that hindered writing and shooting the flick, but I don't think it had a lot of potential to begin with. Snipes has gone the direct-to-video, shot-in-eastern-Europe track before, butother timeshe had the luck of ending up with a halfway-decent flick. As luck would have it, this time it's just a slow, dreary military-based outing that could have been made with just about anybody in the lead role.The story: an American special ops team including a mysterious ""Painter"" (Snipes) is sent into Russia to help disarm a nuclear missile launch site commandeered by a terrorist leader (Dan Badaru,Born to Raise Hell), but their mission does not go as planned...It's my opinion that action heroes like Wesley Snipes should never play parts for which they're part of a team like this, military or not: these roles tend to block their natural charisma by filling scenes with secondary characters who the movie thinks are important but who the audience couldn't care less about. This is definitely one of those cases, as absolutely no one on Snipes' team is worth remembering the name of, but the first half of the movie still tries to focus on them. It might have worked out, since early on the film teases an upcoming moral about the lone wolf tendencies of Snipes' character, but in the end, the biggest life lessons the movie can offer are ""just stand back and let Wesley work"" and ""don't trust the Russians."" Additionally, the script gives nobody a chance to truly act, including William Hope (Aliens) and soap opera sweetheart Emma Samms in their utterly thankless, action-free roles.And speaking of action... The film's title seems to indicate this movie is about a sniper (heck, that's practically our hero's name). However, while Snipes does show off a bit of precision shooting, the reason the movie is called what it is is because ""marksman"" sounds better than ""painter,"" which is what the main character is labeled. From another angle, the title gives you the impression that there's going to be a fair amount of action in the movie, but this isn't the case. The entire first half of the film is practically devoid of not only story development but also of shooting, fighting, and explosions. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's too little delivered too late: there's a moderately decent chase scene followed by minor shootouts, a jet dogfight that nobody could care about, and a single unexciting hand-to-hand fight for Snipes. Totally overlookable.Luckily, Wesley appears to have learned his lesson and to my knowledge has not returned to this level of mediocrity within the last seven years.

918631,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B000A1OFYQ,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[17, 21]","Synopsis:With terrorists holding a recently decommissioned Russian nuclear reactor hostage and the possibility of it being reactivated as a bomb, it's up to the elite US Army Rangers to go in and stop the Terrorists and save their hostages before the worst can happen.  The Rangers are joined by the Marksman (Snipes) a consummate professional loner as they go in.  But not everything is as it seems. When things go awry, only the Marksman can save the day.About the Movie:If my synopsis sounds silly, it's because this entire movie is.  I'm a fan of Wesley Snipes, so I picked this up when it came out, sight unseen. Bad idea.Unfortunately, this is by far the worst movie I've seen Wesley Snipes in.  He's been in some mediocre films, indeed, but this one takes the cake.  Filled with hammy actors and crippled by a ridiculous screenplay and ridiculously sloppy film editing, this movie screams ""B-movie.""First off, The whole plot of this movie was just plain silly.  Russians allowing the US Military to do an anti-terrorist operation at one of their own nuclear facilities, simply because US citizens were on location?  Russia would never allow such a thing any more than the US would if the situation were reversed.  Worse is the suggestion that they'd allow a military airstike on their soil.  And what was up with the air combat? There was no reason for it but to see stock footage of airplanes flying about.Secondly, the acting by many of the main characters was terrible.  Undoubtedly editing and direction had some blame in this as well, but the acting overall was just atrocious.  Snipe's female opposite (Emma Sams) was the worst offender of all, her lines delivered with all the conviction of a high school stage performer. It doesn't help that her dialog is just poorly written. Most of the movie's dialog is. And don't get me started on the attempted ""romance"" between her and Snipes.Thirdly, I hate when movies get things so ridiculously wrong. Since when have any Special Forces run around with heavy, thudding footsteps, clearly visible flashlight beams waving around and talked in full voices while behind enemy lines?  REAL special forces use night-vision, barely audible throat mikes and hand signals, and they also learn how to walk without sounding like the Spanish Inquisition. This movie had those guys running around like they were a bunch of amateurs playing paintball. Worse, their behavior towards one another was just as ridiculous. The Rangers in this movie didn't even pretend to act like a tight knit military unit.Honestly, just a little more attention to these details and the quality of this movie would have jumped up by 3 notches.Fourthly, in a number of spots in this film, the camera direction and film editing was terrible. The most notable occurrence of this was near the end during a firefight.  The camera switched from an inside view to an outside view of a window, and in each case, the actor was in different positions and worse, moving completely differently.  It was distracting and glaringly bad. This happened in a number of other places. Editing film is an art, and in this case, someone was using a preschooler's fingerpaints.Yeah, this movie was just bad.  It's the sort of movie you get a bunch of friends together to watch and make fun of the entire time.  The sad part is that this movie takes itself so seriously. Wesley Snipes must be desperate for a job to take on this garbage.  Frankly, his performance in this movie is so unmemorable, that you could have slotted in just about anyone and it would have come out the same.About the DVD:The Marksman comes in a standard plastic snap case. Overall picture and sound were decent and really I didn't notice any major issues with either.Other features included a single aternate language track and a complete lack of subtitles, something I found a little odd.  Likewise, the special features on this disk are not special at all, consisting only of theatrical trailers.Clearly there was minimum effort put into this DVD release.Bottom Line:The DVD is bare bones and the movie, well, don't bother unless you LIKE watching turkeys.  This movie is pretty bad.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

I like Snipes, especially in the Blade trilogy.  To see him in this film (though you don't see as much of him as you might think - he may have 20 lines of dialogue throughout) is really embarrassing after seeing his better work.  I guess all actors take some jobs for the money, and all I can say is that I hope he got a boatload for this one.  Emma Sams, the lead female actress, does such a poor American accent, that she almost seems as though her dialog was dubbed in.  The rest of the actors are directly out of the B-list and placed in sterotypical roles that are boring and predictable.  And the military scenes?  Ugh.  This film was written/directed/produced/advised by folks with just enough knowledge of the military and operations to be dangerous.  For example, the captain of the US aircraft carrier USS Eriske (or something like that) wears a hat that says ""SSN Eriske"" - for those in the know (and many who aren't), an SSN is a nuclear powered SUBMARINE.  Not a carrier.  Screw ups like that are prevalent throughout the movie - to include the almost total lack of hand signals during tactical movement on target by the ""Ranger"" team sent in with Snipes - everyone seems to prefer to operate by the ultra-covert ""talk in your normal tone of voice when the enemy is nearby"" tactic (haha).  And the individual Rangers seem to get to follow their own orders if they don't feel like following the orders of their senior officers (""I'm outta here!"" is one memorable line)  Oh well.  It may be worth a rental if you are a big Snipes fan, or if you have 90 minutes of your life you don't need or want back.On the one positive note - the movie location scout did a great job - the ""set"" which actually appears to be in Russia or one of the Russian republics, is actually pretty cool, and may even be the saving grace of this film.",2,An Embarrassment for Snipes...,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1928,"['movie', 'simply', 'cookie-cutter', 'straight-to-video', 'low', 'budget', 'poorly', 'acted', 'stinker', 'like', 'Snipes', 'especially', 'Blade', 'trilogy', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'think', 'may', 'have', '20', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'really', 'embarrassing', 'seeing', 'better', 'work', 'guess', 'actors', 'take', 'jobs', 'money', 'can', 'say', 'hope', 'got', 'boatload', 'one', 'Emma', 'Sams', 'lead', 'female', 'actress', 'poor', 'American', 'accent', 'almost', 'dialog', 'was', 'dubbed', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'directly', 'B-list', 'placed', 'sterotypical', 'roles', 'are', 'boring', 'predictable', 'military', 'scenes', 'Ugh', 'film', 'was', 'written/directed/produced/advised', 'folks', 'just', 'enough', 'knowledge', 'military', 'operations', 'be', 'dangerous', 'example', 'captain', 'US', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'USS', 'Eriske', 'something', 'hat', 'SSN', 'Eriske', 'know', 'many', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'SSN', 'nuclear', 'powered', 'SUBMARINE', 'Not', 'carrier', 'Screw', 'ups', 'are', 'prevalent', 'movie', 'include', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'hand', 'signals', 'tactical', 'movement', 'target', 'Ranger', 'team', 'sent', 'Snipes', 'everyone', 'prefer', 'operate', 'ultra-covert', 'talk', 'normal', 'tone', 'voice', 'when', 'enemy', 'nearby', 'tactic', 'haha', 'individual', 'Rangers', 'seem', 'get', 'follow', 'own', 'orders', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'following', 'orders', 'senior', 'officers', ""'m"", 'outta', 'here', 'one', 'memorable', 'line', 'Oh', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'rental', 'are', 'big', 'Snipes', 'fan', 'have', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'want', 'one', 'positive', 'note', 'movie', 'location', 'scout', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'set', 'actually', 'be', 'Russia', 'one', 'Russian', 'republics', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'saving', 'grace', 'film']",The Marksman
918635,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000A1OFYQ,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","`Marksman' is not as bad as you might believe after reading so many negative reviews ... well, at least, what the film is struggling to be is not that bad. The problem is, you need much more money than is spent here, to make a decent action film based on this script, which encompasses a wide variety of action film elements that have been seen in such films as `Behind Enemy Lines.'Wesley Snipes plays ""Painter,"" a laconic, sullen, and deadly special agent who is sent to a nuke plant in Russia with other elite soldiers. He must set a homing beacon for the missile attack AND save the life of the seven American scientists held as hostage there.`Marksman' is surely a slick action film, but ""slick"" here merely means it does not spend too much time on Painter's past activities in Bosnia, or the relation with his ex-lover and senior officer played by Emma Samms. Fortunately the film has no lengthy flashbacks or anything that might delay the actions, and I personally find no problem with their acting or casting. The idea of US military officers speaking with British accent is not very effective even in the direct-to-video actions, but you can just stop paying attention to it.The real problem is the film's unimpressive actions. They include several explosions, air battle, shoot-outs, and a tank running wild after a poor Russian, but none of them really works. I hate to say this, but the action sequences are mostly thrill-free, with terribly edited shots borrowed from action scenes of other better films. See for example the dogfight that tries to be as exciting as summer season blockbusters, but you know it only disappoints us when the film repeats the same footage, replaying the same cheesy explosion.Many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous plot holes and factual inaccuracies of the film. No film can be totally from goofs, I know, but the countless goofs in `Marksman' and its badly edited sequences suggest that the film company either experienced a troubled production, or they just did not know what to do with its results. Either way, it remains true that `Marksman' marks the career decline of Wesley Snipes who needs another `Blade' very quickly.",2,"Falls Below the Mark, Even by the Standard of B Action with Terribly Edited Actions",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,2191,"['Marksman', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'believe', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'well', 'least', 'what', 'film', 'struggling', 'be', 'not', 'bad', 'problem', 'need', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'spent', 'here', 'make', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'based', 'script', 'wide', 'variety', 'action', 'film', 'elements', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'such', 'films', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'Snipes', 'Painter', 'laconic', 'sullen', 'deadly', 'special', 'agent', 'who', 'sent', 'nuke', 'plant', 'Russia', 'other', 'elite', 'soldiers', 'must', 'set', 'homing', 'beacon', 'missile', 'attack', 'AND', 'save', 'life', 'seven', 'American', 'scientists', 'held', 'hostage', 'there.', 'Marksman', 'surely', 'slick', 'action', 'film', 'slick', 'here', 'merely', 'not', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Painter', 'past', 'activities', 'Bosnia', 'relation', 'ex-lover', 'senior', 'officer', 'played', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'lengthy', 'flashbacks', 'anything', 'might', 'delay', 'actions', 'personally', 'find', 'problem', 'acting', 'casting', 'idea', 'US', 'military', 'officers', 'speaking', 'British', 'accent', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'even', 'direct-to-video', 'actions', 'can', 'just', 'stop', 'paying', 'attention', 'it.The', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'unimpressive', 'actions', 'include', 'several', 'explosions', 'air', 'battle', 'shoot-outs', 'tank', 'running', 'wild', 'poor', 'Russian', 'none', 'really', 'hate', 'say', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'mostly', 'thrill-free', 'terribly', 'edited', 'shots', 'borrowed', 'action', 'scenes', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'See', 'example', 'dogfight', 'be', 'as', 'exciting', 'summer', 'season', 'blockbusters', 'know', 'only', 'when', 'film', 'same', 'footage', 'replaying', 'same', 'cheesy', 'explosion.Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes', 'factual', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'totally', 'goofs', 'know', 'countless', 'goofs', 'Marksman', 'badly', 'edited', 'sequences', 'suggest', 'film', 'company', 'either', 'experienced', 'troubled', 'production', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'results', 'way', 'true', 'Marksman', 'career', 'decline', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'who', 'Blade', 'very', 'quickly']",The Marksman
