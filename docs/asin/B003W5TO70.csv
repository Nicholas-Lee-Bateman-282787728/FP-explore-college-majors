What do writers, celebrities etc do when they are getting stale? Sensationalism.I loved the ""conspiracy"" briefs we got with the general, holyman, etc. where are those?(about half way through s3 so far). They elevated the humor of this series a lot by portraying these idiot celebrities to the role of to be feared world leaders. This season just shows typical rock band stuff with no enemies on the scale of the conspiracy group. These are much less brutal as well. Where's the extremism that made this series so good?Where are the awesomely over the top concert performances?It's too bad, this series seems to be going the way of SouthPark, I have not watched that show in years it got so desperate.

There were  a lot of times that I really laughed hard and some of the funniest scenes of the series happens in this season. It definitely is a different spin to the series since it very rarely mentions the Illuminati, but they are still there. Instead, this season does focus on character developement and shows a lot about Pickles, Toki and Skwisgaar's childhood past. It's a great season, but the biggest downfall is that the band doesn't play on every episode like they did in the previous two season. So, you don't get an awesome Metal song every story.

But that fear was completely unfounded. You'll notice a number of minor changes this season, but most of them are very much overstated in the majority of the negative reviews I've seen on this page.There are fewer episodes in this season, but the episodes are also twice as long. The curses are no longer bleeped by that awesome guitar squeeling, but there's also a great deal more cursing in this season; so I imagine that much bleeping would have just become annoying. And it's surprisingly refreshing to not have any edited language this time around. Lastly, while the storylines are as amazingly well-written as ever, the majority of the episodes don't contain new tracks or concerts. You'll notice there's plenty of musical material however, but the focus does seem to be much heavier on the story side of things within season 3.The core of the show you undoubtedly adored in seasons 1 and 2 is still very much intact. Metalocalypse is still clever, brutal, and hilarious; the way that it's always been. Some reviewers have insisted that the show took a completely different direction; leading me to believe that the band was undergoing changes to its lineup or that Ofdensen was really gone for good, in an attempt to keep the scripts fresh. But again, there's nothing like that here. This is still Metalocalypse.The only real reason I'm giving this season a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the fact that so many of the more comedy-laden tracks were incorporated here, while the metal tracks weren't given equal showcasing. Still, aside from that, season 3 was fantastic! Just like with the first two seasons, once I turned the first episode on, I didn't sleep until I'd finished them all.
