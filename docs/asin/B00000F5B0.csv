498952,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B00000F5B0,Baberufus,"[2, 4]","This is a great, often forgotten movie from 1981, a time when roots/southern themes were hot in movies, what with Urban Cowboy, Honeysuckle Rose, and this little gem all hailing from around the same time. Unlike Urban and Honeysuckle, though, this movie has not been offically rereleased on DVD. Like another review said, it appears to be a bootleg--nothing but a transfer from a VHS tape. While the quality is passable--at least the picture is as good as VHS's get--the audio is obviously a little muffled and significantly lower in quality than Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1. And that is a shame, because the music in this movie is FANTASTIC! While the acting is good overall, as for the singing, Dennis Quaid is pretty good, but Kristy McNichol is clearly an amateur. She has a decent voice, but she could have used more experience as a singer before tackling a role as a singer in a movie. Still, the songs that Quaid and McNichol sing are great tunes! As is the case with many movie soundtracks--and it's really annoying--some of the best songs in this movie are not on the soundtrack album (should you be able to find it, anyway).This movie is funny and entertaining, and the music is great! So despite the low picture/audio quality, I still recommend it highly!",5,"Great movie, but the DVD is not studio quality...",1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,1263,"['great', 'often', 'forgotten', 'movie', '1981', 'time', 'when', 'roots/southern', 'themes', 'were', 'hot', 'movies', 'what', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'Honeysuckle', 'Rose', 'little', 'gem', 'hailing', 'same', 'time', 'Urban', 'Honeysuckle', 'though', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'offically', 'rereleased', 'DVD', 'review', 'said', 'be', 'bootleg', 'nothing', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'tape', 'quality', 'passable', 'least', 'picture', 'as', 'good', 'VHS', 'get', 'audio', 'obviously', 'little', 'muffled', 'significantly', 'lower', 'quality', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS', '5.1', 'shame', 'music', 'movie', 'FANTASTIC', 'acting', 'good', 'overall', 'singing', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'pretty', 'good', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'clearly', 'amateur', 'decent', 'voice', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'experience', 'singer', 'tackling', 'role', 'singer', 'movie', 'Still', 'songs', 'Quaid', 'McNichol', 'sing', 'are', 'great', 'tunes', 'case', 'many', 'movie', 'soundtracks', 'really', 'annoying', 'best', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'anyway', '.This', 'movie', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'music', 'great', 'So', 'low', 'picture/audio', 'quality', 'still', 'recommend', 'highly']",The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia VHS

498957,A1FZOLPMDKX24B,B00000F5B0,Douglas Allen,"[25, 26]","I was obsessed with Kristy McNichol as a kid. At 37, I have found old obsessions die hard. I loved this movie when it was released in 1981, but I wasn't quite so sure it would still hold my attention in 2004. I recently purchased one of those VHS transfers to DVD and I am surprised to find this movie still as captivating today as I did when I was a kid. The thing I am most surprised by is how entertaining it is.It is a total B movie, but it's incredibly rich in its character development, or maybe that is just the acting, which is great. The editing is really amazing too; there are a lot of subtleties to this and a lot of sensitivity and I find that really surprising, when most media today is so flat, crude and one-dimensional. It is easy to tell that that this film was made by some very talented people. And I have to say, in all honesty, I really think that Kristy McNichol and Dennis Quaid can sing. This is just all-around wonderful entertainment.I hope this gets an offical DVD release sometime soon.
