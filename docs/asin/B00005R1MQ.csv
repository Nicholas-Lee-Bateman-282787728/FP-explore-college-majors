In fact, knowing what sort of monetary crimps they were under, I was actually fairly impressed with the finished product. The movie basic hinges around the premise that there are indeed demons in the world, and that these demons do indeed inflict us no matter what we think. The poor, unfortunate main character of the film, Harry Ballad, finds this out the hard way when he discovers that his books on ""uncovering frauds"" has marked him as its next victim. After discovering a package in the mail showing him the face of his adversary, he finds himself surrounded by droves of dying friends and a web of intrigue that only a female ex-cult member can help him live through. Combine this with the fact that he's being chased by an eclectic band of cultists and, better yet, a demon, and you get the portrait of a man living a very bleak life.My only complaint is that the movie hinges more on the continued threat of the demon that is stalking poor Mr. Ballad and not on shots of the demon itself. In fact, I counted only three areas with the demon actually in them, and one of those was a bit on the ""too quick to see well"" side. This was a shame, too, because one of the shots of the demon making its way down a building looked nice. Still, the mood is creepy enough to keep a person tied to it and the ending is funny, in a somewhat unexpected way. That said, it is worth checking out in my mind, but you do have to like constraints to enjoy this.",5,The Price of Calling People Frauds,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,1595,"['being', 'movie', 'obvious', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'still', 'thought', 'Irrefutable', 'Truth', 'Demons', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'fact', 'knowing', 'what', 'sort', 'monetary', 'crimps', 'were', 'was', 'actually', 'fairly', 'impressed', 'finished', 'product', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'are', 'indeed', 'demons', 'world', 'demons', 'do', 'indeed', 'inflict', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'poor', 'unfortunate', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Harry', 'Ballad', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'when', 'books', 'uncovering', 'frauds', 'marked', 'next', 'victim', 'discovering', 'package', 'mail', 'showing', 'face', 'adversary', 'surrounded', 'droves', 'dying', 'friends', 'web', 'intrigue', 'only', 'female', 'ex-cult', 'member', 'can', 'help', 'live', 'Combine', 'fact', 'being', 'chased', 'eclectic', 'band', 'cultists', 'better', 'yet', 'demon', 'get', 'portrait', 'man', 'living', 'very', 'bleak', 'life.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'more', 'continued', 'threat', 'demon', 'stalking', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Ballad', 'not', 'shots', 'demon', 'fact', 'counted', 'only', 'three', 'areas', 'demon', 'actually', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'quick', 'see', 'well', 'side', 'was', 'shame', 'too', 'one', 'shots', 'demon', 'making', 'way', 'down', 'building', 'looked', 'nice', 'Still', 'mood', 'creepy', 'enough', 'keep', 'person', 'tied', 'ending', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'way', 'said', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'mind', 'do', 'have', 'like', 'constraints', 'enjoy']",N/A
677088,A3AEWUVYMELPNG,B00005R1MQ,V. Koehler,"[4, 4]","I can only speak for myself, and I did find this movie interesting and very entertaining, though I am not sure if that's what it is meant to be or if it is because it's a New Zealand flim all the way around, the writer,director, actors and actresses and of course the location.Certainly it's not a big budget flim like here in the States, so no mind blowing special effects and the like. I didn't find this movie even a little bit scary especially considering the horror flims most of us Americans watch. No real gore to speak of, no hacking up or dismembering people alive,well until almost the end of the movie then we do get a little violence and a little bit of gore and it was kind of a nice change of pace. Though there was a part of this movie that reminded me of Mo-La-Rahm in Indinana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and speaking of Temple of Doom it has some bugs as well, the keyword being ""some"" bugs as in you can probably count them. The references to demonology are very simple as not to give anyone ideas to start their own black coven or black lodge and will not keep you up at night. It is not until you start thinking about some of the things presented here that you start questioning what was or maybe more importantly was not said. That in fact is part of what gives this movie some of its charm. And for those of you who bought it for the same reason I did Karl Urban does not in any way, shape or form disappoint. It is very cool to see just what type of movies he got his start in. And as others reviewers have said about this flick he's hot, make that totally smoking hot.
