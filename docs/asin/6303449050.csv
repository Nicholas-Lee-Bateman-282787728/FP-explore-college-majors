374999,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303449050,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","De Sica's personal favorite of his own films, and that is saying a lot considering that triumphs he put to film, `Umberto D.' is a beautifully sharp film about an elderly man who is struggling to make ends meet.  He gets minimal funds from his pension and is regarded as worthless by his landlady of twenty years who has threatened to throw him out at the end of the month unless he pays his back debts, which he cannot afford to do.  The cruelty depicted against this man, and others of his kind (a particular scene showing two children mocking their aging father's condition is quite disturbing) is a wakeup call and one that is surely poignant even today.  Yes, `Umberto D.' may have been a pointed finger at the Italian society of the 50's (and it was thus chastised upon its release in Italy) but it speaks volumes for a modern culture as well; especially here in America.  The final frames are uplifting in a subtly devastating way, for the atmospheric realities of Umberto's condition are still looming in the background, but both director De Sica and first time actor Carlo Battisti sell every single frame of this critically lauded and emotionally perfect film.",5,Respect thy elders...,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,1170,"['De', 'Sica', 'personal', 'favorite', 'own', 'films', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'triumphs', 'put', 'film', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'beautifully', 'sharp', 'film', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'minimal', 'funds', 'pension', 'regarded', 'worthless', 'landlady', 'twenty', 'years', 'who', 'threatened', 'throw', 'out', 'end', 'month', 'back', 'debts', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'do', 'cruelty', 'depicted', 'man', 'others', 'kind', 'particular', 'scene', 'showing', 'two', 'children', 'mocking', 'aging', 'father', 'condition', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'wakeup', 'call', 'one', 'surely', 'poignant', 'even', 'today', 'Yes', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'pointed', 'finger', 'Italian', 'society', '50', 'was', 'thus', 'chastised', 'release', 'Italy', 'volumes', 'modern', 'culture', 'well', 'especially', 'here', 'America', 'final', 'frames', 'are', 'uplifting', 'subtly', 'devastating', 'way', 'atmospheric', 'realities', 'Umberto', 'condition', 'are', 'still', 'looming', 'background', 'director', 'De', 'Sica', 'first', 'time', 'actor', 'Carlo', 'Battisti', 'sell', 'single', 'frame', 'critically', 'lauded', 'emotionally', 'perfect', 'film']",N/A

He is proud and stubborn and tries to keep what little dignity he has left. The only thing he has left in the world is his dog Flike. The man decides suicide is the only way out, but what to do about the dog? Literally he can't sell it, can't give it away. He finally decides to take the dog with him as he dives in front of a train, but the dog breaks loose and the man's life is saved.It's a very sad and poignant and emotional movie, illuminated by careful attention to tiny details. One of the movie's main themes is man's indifference to man. This is illustrated in many ways, big and small: a glance, a man turning in a seat as soon as it's vacated on a bus, a woman beating a rug from a fourth story window as a man unknowingly stands below, and many others.The subplot of a servant girl who is pregnant doesn't add much to the movie, although there is one scene with her that is marvelous: she goes through a morning routine in the kitchen making coffee, and we realize at the end that she is crying. The whole scene means nothing, but it's so moving in its simplicity and realism that it's startling to see.  The movie was not released in the US until 1955. Italy, understandably, was upset by the mean way the elderly are treated in the film. A beautiful masterpiece; its seeming simplicity hides a complex view of modern life underneath.

375001,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6303449050,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[5, 6]","'Umberto D.' is the detailed, meticulously presented, monochrome portrayal of an aging pensioner in Rome, who, along with his dog Flike, struggles to survive in the dispassionate atmosphere of post-war Italy.  Under the threat of eviction from his landlady over past due rent, unable to feed both himself and his dog, and with no one else to rely on, Umberto considers taking his own life.  However, in the process, he nearly loses the one thing that has any meaning to him in this harsh world, and the film's ending, while unclear and indeterminate, hints that he finds a different perspective as he renews his contest with life.Film historians generally credit the director Vittorio De Sica ('The Bicycle Thief', 'The Garden of the Fitz-Continis') as a leading figure in the Italian Neorealist trend of films after WWII, and consider 'Umberto D.' to be one the classics of the movement, as well as its finale.  Non-professional actors on location, performance of mundane tasks in a conventional manner, and reflecting the conditions of the poor all marked the traits of Neorealism, and 'Umberto D.' conforms in every way to these standards.  This was, in fact, the aspect of the film that I enjoyed most - the unvarnished look at Roman and Italian life shortly after the war.  Its concentration on the 'real' comes through splendidly, and I was impressed while watching the film that here was a depiction of a time and place that was unique to the moment, preserved for as long as the film exists.Ultimately, though, this is an austere film, as it was no doubt intended to be, and some viewers may find, as I did, that its bleak presentation drags.  Though each realist segment is without any overt flaws, linked together I thought they tended toward extraneous and tedious.  One's enjoyment of the film, therefore, will depend a lot on whether you appreciate the techniques of Neorealism in movies or not - and for those who aren't familiar with them, I think I can safely recommend 'Umberto D.' as an excellent example.  Viewers weaned on linear films that only concentrate the camera lens on the portion of real life that advances the plot may find themselves somewhat puzzled by films like 'Umberto D., though I think they can sometimes be an interesting switch.One note about the film's emotional impact - whether or not one has a fervent reaction will also have a lot to do with how well the techniques of this movement resonate.  It's even described as a tearjerker by some, but its ambiguous ending does not necessarily imply anything.  Those who are affected most may be reacting to the presentation of human dignity in a cold-blooded world, which I think the film accomplishes well, albeit slowly.  I found the ending affirming, actually, without negating the reality De Sica worked hard to portray.In the end, even though I would not consider this one of the greatest films ever, I would recommend it to those who appreciate realism in film, and who have the patience to stick with a film that is loyal only to its own pacing.",3,A Model of Realism,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,3039,"[""'Umberto"", 'D.', 'detailed', 'meticulously', 'presented', 'monochrome', 'portrayal', 'aging', 'pensioner', 'Rome', 'who', 'dog', 'Flike', 'survive', 'dispassionate', 'atmosphere', 'post-war', 'Italy', 'threat', 'eviction', 'landlady', 'past', 'due', 'rent', 'unable', 'feed', 'dog', 'one', 'else', 'rely', 'Umberto', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'However', 'process', 'nearly', 'one', 'thing', 'meaning', 'harsh', 'world', 'film', 'ending', 'unclear', 'indeterminate', 'hints', 'different', 'perspective', 'contest', 'life.Film', 'historians', 'generally', 'credit', 'director', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', ""'The"", 'Garden', 'Fitz-Continis', 'leading', 'figure', 'Italian', 'Neorealist', 'trend', 'films', 'WWII', 'consider', ""'Umberto"", 'D.', 'be', 'one', 'classics', 'movement', 'as', 'well', 'finale', 'Non-professional', 'actors', 'location', 'performance', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'conventional', 'manner', 'reflecting', 'conditions', 'poor', 'marked', 'traits', 'Neorealism', 'D.', 'conforms', 'way', 'standards', 'was', 'fact', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'unvarnished', 'look', 'Roman', 'Italian', 'life', 'shortly', 'war', 'concentration', ""'real"", 'splendidly', 'was', 'impressed', 'watching', 'film', 'here', 'was', 'depiction', 'time', 'place', 'was', 'unique', 'moment', 'preserved', 'as', 'long', 'film', 'exists.Ultimately', 'though', 'austere', 'film', 'was', 'doubt', 'intended', 'be', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'did', 'bleak', 'presentation', 'drags', 'realist', 'segment', 'overt', 'flaws', 'linked', 'together', 'thought', 'tended', 'extraneous', 'tedious', 'One', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'therefore', 'will', 'depend', 'lot', 'appreciate', 'techniques', 'Neorealism', 'movies', 'not', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'recommend', ""'Umberto"", 'D.', 'excellent', 'example', 'Viewers', 'weaned', 'linear', 'films', 'only', 'concentrate', 'camera', 'portion', 'real', 'life', 'plot', 'may', 'find', 'somewhat', 'puzzled', 'films', ""'Umberto"", 'D.', 'think', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'interesting', 'switch.One', 'note', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'not', 'one', 'fervent', 'reaction', 'will', 'also', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'how', 'well', 'techniques', 'movement', 'resonate', 'even', 'described', 'tearjerker', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'not', 'necessarily', 'imply', 'anything', 'who', 'are', 'affected', 'most', 'may', 'be', 'reacting', 'presentation', 'human', 'dignity', 'cold-blooded', 'world', 'think', 'film', 'accomplishes', 'well', 'slowly', 'found', 'ending', 'affirming', 'actually', 'negating', 'reality', 'De', 'Sica', 'worked', 'hard', 'portray.In', 'end', 'even', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'appreciate', 'realism', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'patience', 'stick', 'film', 'loyal', 'only', 'own', 'pacing']",N/A
375002,A3IY28PW12MSVN,6303449050,Christine Wong,"[22, 22]","Vittorio DeSica's wonderful ""Umberto D"" was one of the last films of the Italian neo-realism movement and by far its best one.  It is also one of my favorite movies ever.  The movie's premise is simple: it is a slice of the life of a poor lonely pensioner, Umberto.  Throughout the movie, we see Umberto struggle to find money to pay rent to his horrible landlady, love his dog Flike, and deal with the loneliness and disillusionment of the postwar era.""Umberto D"" is a character-driven film.  It works very well because of its sharp observations on loneliness and poignant gestures.  The gestures evoke powerful feelings without necessitating dialogue.  Many of the scenes, even the ones that do not necessarily advance the plot, are hypnotically beautiful in their simplicity.  Take, for example, a beautiful scene where Umberto finally needs to beg for money but cannot physically bring himself to do it.  He extends his palm up, but when a passer-by stops to give him money, Umberto quickly flips his hand over, as if testing for rain.  The film is full of these small gestures that quietly emphasize the desperate loneliness and poignancy of Umberto's situation.The acting in this film is absolutely superb.  Carlo Battisti, despite having never acted before, is wonderful as the titular character; his face is a fascinating blend of stubborn dignity and weariness of life.  Maria Pia-Casilio, who plays the maid, is just as good as evoking life's loneliness and quiet desperation.  The supporting cast is also very strong.One of the very few criticisms I have heard of this film is that it is too sentimental and borderline sappy.  While some scenes with Umberto and his dog Flike are sentimental, never is it ""too"" sentimental.  DeSica knows how far he can push his film without making it sappy, and he wisely shows it as it is.  Nothing feels forced.  The subject material itself and the simplicity in which it is presented will bring tears.  (If you don't cry in this movie, you need to have your heart professionally de-thawed.)  But ""Umberto D"" is never dumbed down into sappiness and clich&eacute;d corniness.  It is a very powerful film.""Umberto D"" is the masterpiece of the Italian neo-realist era.  Just the powerful and ambiguous ending alone is worth the price.  It's a rather bleak and very realistic movie, but it makes some fascinating commentary on the human condition, specifically the loneliness we face.

375003,A5SKEJ6QA31IP,6303449050,"C. N. Gallimore ""Reader of Great Books""","[8, 10]","The master of Italian Neo-Realist cinema, DeSica, creates with Umberto D. one of the finest films of his career (I will not say his finest because I am torn between this movie and his earlier &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;).  Set in post WWII Italy, this film follows the heartwrentching story of a retired civil servant, Umberto D., and his dog, Flike, as he tries to survive on his modest government pension in a world where traditional human values have fallen before the weight of an amoral modernistic culture.OK.  So far what I have said is basically right off of the movie's box description and no more origional than what others have said.  It's just that this movie is very difficult to describe without doing the nature of the film an extreme disservice.  This is a movie completely devoted to instilling in the audience a sense of empathy towards a character that they very likely just passed by on the street entering into the theatre without a second thought.  By attempting to convey the strong pathos of such an ordinary human being (played incedentally by a nonprofessional actor) the film offers hardly anything in the way of spectacle, just showing the realistic day to day life of forgoten humanity.  This all sounds almost silly on paper, and by virtue of the subject matter it is.  This is one of those movies that could not be a book.  It could not convey its message by means of the printed word, and takes advantage of the medium of picture in a masterful way.  One of the true greats of world cinema.Now just a few words on the Criterion Edition DVD.  As many of us have some to expect from Criterion, this DVD is presented in a sharp clear transfer and with a decently clean audio track.  It also shipped with a fair amount of extra features which help to elucidate and expand the viewing experience.  It has a very nice hour length documentary devoted to DeSica's films and a very interesting interview with the actress who played the maid.  On top of this it ships with a few written essays.  The one disappointing omission is the lack of a commentary track.  Oh well, maybe some day.

375004,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303449050,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 4]","Lost between the glare of his earlier The Bicycle Thief, and his later films with Sophia Loren, Vittorio De Sica's 1952 film Umberto D. stands as an almost forgotten masterpiece of Italian Neo-Realism, and one of the last films that could claim to be of that movement alone. It was pilloried by myopic critics upon its opening- mostly Left Wing dilettantes who thought that the formerly middle class civil servant's tale was not `socially conscious' enough for the filmmaker to waste his talents on, and a few cineastes who felt it too maudlin and weepy. They simply did not understand the chasm between true sentiment and false sentimentality. The film flopped, but has steadily risen in De Sica's pantheon to being thought of as an equal to The Bicycle Thief, or right behind it. The truth is that it is very easy to portray the struggles of the impoverished, as De Sica did in The Bicycle Thief, and Shoeshine before it, as both were laden with struggling children, but to elicit the grandeur of feelings for an old man, Umberto (Carlo Battisti, non-professional actor and retired college professor from the University of Florence), alone in the world, takes a bit more. This is especially so since the lead character is not a particularly warm man. No, he's no Ebenezer Scrooge, but he's a proud and stubborn man who keeps himself emotionally withdrawn from life. He's an everyman, in that he was a civil servant, retired with a meager pension, and has lived in the same small room for decades, harried by a bitch of a bleached blond social climbing poseur of a landlady (Lina Garrari), who loathes him for unspecified reasons- she says he's behind on the rent, but how many people have never been in such a predicament, and are not treated the way she scorns this old gentleman? She even debases him by renting out his room to horny couples while he's away, and a scene of him returning to his soiled bed after strangers have copulated in it is precious- the look of disdain on Battisti's face is utterly priceless.That some people have also misread the film to indict the old man for failing to prepare for the consequences of old age shows how out of touch with reality many critics, then and now, are. These are the same people who would deny Social Security to their grandparents who contributed to it for years, and claim the old are selfish for wanting their fair share. Yes, Umberto is behind on his rent- but he was also living in a time of runaway inflation, that would have eaten up any of his meager savings. And, despite the characterizations of Umberto as cold, at times, he is never disrespectful, not in the blatantly obvious ways the landlady is to him. Thus, when one reads criticism of the film that jab at Umberto's character, or defend the landlady's sadistic actions, one is misreading the very `realism' that this Neo-Realistic film purports. And the truth is, that just as the dilemma faced by another aging civil servant, in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, made the same year as Umberto D., has not changed in half a century or more, and across continents, neither has the dilemma this film shows really changed, and therein lies the timelessness of this tale- which will likely still be as relevant in five hundred years, albeit unfortunately. Sadly, I've known too many real life people like Umberto D., and the foolish criticisms of the film manifest flaws in the critics more so than in the film.The camera movements by Aldo Graziati never intrude on the simple tale penned by longtime De Sica collaborator and novelist Cesare Zavattini, which has some minor things in common with the more recent American film My Dog Skip, another great man and dog film. The DVD by The Criterion Collection is very crisp, and the white subtitles never are obscured, although, like the DVD release of The Bicycle Thief, an English language dubbed soundtrack should have been made, as well as a film commentary by some historian or scholar. The disk does come with a 55 minute Italian tv documentary called This is Life: Vittorio De Sica, a 12 minute interview with Maria Pia Casilio, and writings by Umberto Eco, Luisa Alessandri, and Carlo Battisti. Memories of the film by De Sica, and a new essay by film critic Stuart Klawans, are in the insert.Umberto D. is a great film, and like its kissing cousin, Ikiru, it shows that films on old people can be every bit as engaging as those about the young and beautiful, and not just run of the mill crap like the Grumpy Old Men fare Hollywood spews. Those who criticize this film and its ending are likely the same sort of cretins who find Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard films to be deep and/or moving. Neo-Realism was a movement that should never have flagged, and the world would be better off if a younger wave of filmmakers picked up the banner dropped over half a century ago, for it showed new ways to tell tales and core at the thing that is human in all things- even in the will of a small dog to live with his master, and what that will generates in return.",5,Great,1222041600,"09 22,

375005,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6303449050,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[11, 12]","Director Vittorio De Sica, the famous actor and well renown director who was a major proponent to Italian neorealism of filmmaking and introduced the world to films that would take the world by storm.  De Sica had many popular films under his belt such as ""Miracle in Milan"", ""The Children Are Watching Us"", ""Two Women"" and many more.  But it was the neorealistic films of De Spica that many remember.  Films such as ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Shoeshine"", films that epitomized showcased the poor and working class in Italy.  How one deals with poverty and when desperate, the life changing decisions that are made.But it was the 1952 film ""Umberto D."" which De Sica has said is the film which he prefers among all the films that he has made because of its ""uncompromising portrayal of the characters and incidents that are genuine and true"".But ""Umberto D."" was a film that would become noticed now more than when it first screened in theaters in Italy.  As Italy tried to move past the neorealism and wanted to show the country as healthy, ""Umberto D."" continued De Sica's dedication to showcase people living in poverty.  According to film critic, Stuart Klawans, ""Umberto D."" was a film that was despised by the Christian Democratic Part's Giulio Andreotti and it was his party who had control of the government and also the movie production loans and right for pre-censorship over scripts.  Andreotti went as far as saying De Sica was guilty of slandering Italy abroad.Needless to say, the film bombed in the box office in Italy and different parts of Europe despite winning a Bodil Award for ""Best European Film"".  But it appeared that audiences fascination with Italian neorealism was over.Meanwhile in the US, Americans had a different perspective and gave the film a New York Film Critics Circle Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and the film was nominated an Oscar for ""Best Writing, Motion Picture Story"".Before De Sica's death, if there was one thing about ""Umberto D."", its that De Sica has always believed it was his best film because it was a film made the way he wanted without compromises.""Umberto D. was a film written by Cesare Zavattini (who also wrote ""Miracle in Milan"" and ""The Bicycle Thief""), cinematography by Aldo Graziati (""Miracle in Milan"", ""Indiscretion"") and music by Alessandro Cicognini (""Miracle in Milan"", ""Tomorrow is Too Late"", ""Anna of Brooklyn"").  And the film would showcase people who have never acted before, with the exception of the trained dog who had appeared in several films prior.The film was a cineaste favorite when it was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection in 2003, but now De Sica's masterpiece was released on Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection in Sept. 2012.VIDEO:""Umberto D."" is presented in 1080p High Definition, black and white (1:37:1 aspect ratio).  This new transfer on Blu-ray looks incredible compared to its previous Criterion Collection 2003 DVD counterpart.  Picture quality is actually very good for a film created back in 1952 courtesy of the restoration done by Cineteca Nazionale-Scuola Nzionale di Cinema in collaboration with Mediaset and the original DVD transfer was quite impressive when I originally reviewed it years ago.But watching it in HD, the detail of the film is impressive.  Whites and grays were were well-contrast and black levels were nice and deep.  The picture quality is clean and contrast is stunning.  The Blu-ray release of ""Umberto D."" is fantastic and fans of the film will definitely see the improved transfer to be worth the upgrade from the original DVD to Blu-ray.According to the Criterion Collection, the high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from the original nitrate camera negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, audio is presented in Italian LPCM Monaural 1.0. Dialogue is clear and I heard no audio problems during my viewing of the film.  According to Criterion, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-Bit from a 35 mm optical track print.  Pops, crackle, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD, Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Umberto D."" comes with the following special features:That's Life: Vittorio De Sica-  (54:32) A 2001 documentary directed by Sandro Lai about Vittorio De Sica's career and behind-the-scenes footage from De Sica's past interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and more.Maria Pia Casilio Interview - (12:06) Filmed in 2003, Maria Pia Casilio talks about how a seamstress with no acting ability won the role for ""Umberto D."" and from that moment, how and why Di Spica gave her an opportunity to be in every film of his.Trailer - The original theatrical trailer for ""Umberto D."".EXTRAS:""Umberto D. - The Criterion Collection #201"" comes with an 18-page booklet with the following essays: ""Seeing Clearly Through Tears: On the Smart Sentiment of Umberto D."" by Stuart Klawans, ""De Sica on Umberto D."" and ""Am I Battisti or Umberto D.?"" by Carlo Battsti.JUDGMENT CALL:It has been nearly a decade since I have watched ""Umberto D."", one of filmmaker Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece and a classic film of Italian neorealism that many will remember long after they have watched it.  A film that resonates strongly within a viewer because of its heartfelt story, its circumstance and imagery of its time, but most importantly, a film that event today, many people experience similar situations of homelessness and being too old and relevant to others during a time where world economy is bad and one can only hope for the best.""Umberto D."" is a story about humanity, a story about hope and persevering no matter how bad things are and to protect those who you love or are close to, even when a person is unsure if they can do it or not.When I originally reviewed this film years ago, it was during at time that I took an interest in De Sica's work.  At the time I wrote, ""And fortunately, both films are not alike with the exception that you have two older men who contemplate their life as ""Ikiru"" focused on a man who doesn't have much time to live, while ""Umberto D."" is about a man who is trying to survive and knowing he has no one to depend on, but yet his dog...his only companion depends on him and several times, Umberto has disappointed his canine friend.  His stubbornness and not willing to find shelter but to see if he can prove to his landlord that he will not be kicked of his apartment can be seen as commendable, and that the old man still has enough fight in him.  In ""Ikiru"", we see the value of life.  In ""Umberto D."", we see an old man's life thrown into despair and not knowing what to do with his life.  Nor does he do much to fix it."".Watching ""Umberto D."" once again, the relationship between Umberto and canine companion is important because for many older people, one must be inspired to live.  For Umberto, the dog is his connection to life, having no family that he can depend on, no friends that he can depend on, it's his dog that needs him, depends on him and it's that relationship that captivates the viewer.  We feel sympathy for both but knowing that old age, no job, during a time of despair...you feel as if things continue to be unresolved, hope may seem to far out of reach.The film has so much relevance because I'm sure even 60-years after this film was released in theaters, I'm quite sure many people have met someone like Umberto.  Young adult or elderly, family member or friend... I'm sure that there are times we have been apathetic and also frustrated by such people. This was a time of despair economically and while families had each other, those who were elderly and could not work were not seen as productive but as expendable.And so, the message of the film was taken to heart by those who have watched it then and now.  Interesting enough that the film was criticized because it was seen as a disservice to Italy according to Giulio Andreotti, Undersecretary of Public Entertainment, who wanted to see more healthy and optimistic cinema.  But it's understandable as Italy was undergoing a tumultuous time of uncertainty.  The government wanted to rebuild Italy to a positive nation and they needed their film industry to change the mood of its people.  While De Sica and other filmmakers wanted to bring attention to social injustice and the need for social reform to help the poor.Needless to say, it was a conflict in Italy's cinematic past and in the end, more people wanted to be entertained than be shown what they know already about their country's political and social problems and sure enough, Italian Neorealism would eventually start to transition into more upbeat films via commedia all'italiana or even neorealismo rosa, which later became more in demand.Seeing the transition and changes in Vittorio de Sica's career, I look at ""Umberto D."" as a time capsule to Italy's past and grateful that the filmmaker used cinema to communicate to viewers that the people have the right to voice their displeasure towards their government and ask for social reform.""Umberto D."" and ""The Bicycle Thieves"" are important films by Vittorio De Sica, because we watch how this filmmaker wanted to see change and what best to use cinema as a powerful voice to communicate to millions.I mentioned that ""hope may seem so far out of reach"" for Umberto D., but the ending of the film can be seen by different people with different interpretations.  I tend to look at it as man's best friend giving the man a second chance at life.  Whether your optimism or pessimism comes into full gear after watching this film, just know that its relevancy then continues to be powerful even now and this classic Italian film should be seen by all cinema fans.  I would go as far to say that ""Umberto D."" is a must-watch film and for cinema fans, it's also a must-own.  I believed back then that this film was a keeper and I still hold that belief today.As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the transfer to Blu-ray is fantastic.  Back in 2003, my review was favorable because of its restoration and clarity on DVD.  But watching it on Blu-ray, the clarity, contrast and overall picture quality makes this version the one to own.  As for special features, I absolutely enjoyed the documentary about director Vittorio De Sica's life and also hearing from the actress Maria Pia Casilio and hearing how cool of a director  De Sica truly was and how he treated her so well.  You can only admire what De Sica brought to filmmaking but also when given the opportunity to create a film with no compromises.Overall, ""Umberto D."" is a masterpiece.  Cinematography was beautiful, the non-professional actors turned actors brought a wonderful performance for the film and Zavattini once again has nailed down a solid screenplay.  Sure,  ""Umberto D."" may not tug at your heart or make you cry like Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" but the despair of his characters are quite real and relevant today.It's Italian neorealism at its best and ""Umberto D."" is definitely a film that I highly recommend!",5,(4.5 stars) A classic Italian neorealism film that captures humanity in times of despair.,1354320000,"12 1,

The Criterion Collection provides a booklet with an excellent review by Stuart Klawans and a bit of an interview with director Vittorio De Sica.  What I learned was that Umberto D. was a big flop at the box office in Italy primarily because the Italian government didn't like the film because they thought it was insulting since it made Italy seem so unfeeling, poverty-stricken, and mercantile.  I was struck by this because, yes, poor Umberto and his dog are pretty much set out to pasture without so much as some grass and a bone.  But to say that such a film reflects upon an entire people is perhaps to protest too much.Italy was devastated by the failure of fascism and was just beginning to recover from the war when this film was made, and nobody wanted any downers.  Vittorio De Sica's film is perhaps not so much of a downer as the early critics thought.  The ending is ambiguous and while not hopeful for Umberto, is somewhat inspiring in the youthfulness of his dog and in the sweet humanity of the maid Maria who shoulders her situation with alacrity while showing affection and kindness toward a bitter old man.I was not moved to tears as some have been in watching this.  Umberto's troubles seem to me (from my privileged vantage point in time and place) somewhat of his own doing.  I imagined that he supported the fascists, and I saw his poverty in his old age as a direct result of that support.  Barring that, I imagined that he had planned poorly for his old age, and at any rate his values, represented by his always wearing a suit and tie and hat, and his inability to beg or to take some kind of job, disqualified him for tears.  Of course I was unfair.Even so my sympathy was with him, and I respected the decision he finally makes--although whether he will be able to carry it out is unclear.  I respect his dignity, and identify with him in his struggle with the Teutonic and utterly bourgeois landlord who holds sway over him, played with a deliberately heavy presence by Lina Gennari, whom De Sica photographs up close and low to her large body to emphasize her strength and to make it clear to us that Umberto has no chance in his struggle with her.Both Carlo Battisti who played Umberto and Maria Pia Casilio who played Maria, were considered amateur actors, very much in keeping with the neorealistic school of film; yet for me they were both excellent and natural, whereas Gennari, who was a professional, seemed artificial.  But that impression is an artifact of the neorealist school (which they say died with this film).  The very fact of no flourishes and no modeling and certainly no flights of creativity by the actors, it was believed, helped to make the film realistic, about real people in real situations.Today of course this is a celebrated film, considered one of De Sica's best.  He himself believed from the very beginning that it was one of his best even though he knew it would be hard-pressed to make any money for its producers.A word about the dog (the other professional actor in the film).  Flike is extraordinarily well-trained, so much so he becomes part of the psychology of the film and is at the very heart of the denouement.  The scene near the end where Umberto dips under the rail guard as the train approaches, Flike held close to his chest--and the scene after--is of one of the great sequences in cinema, and, ironically, as in a commercial film, stars a dog!  Umberto D. is in fact one of the greatest dog films ever made.  All dog lovers will appreciate the love that Umberto feels for his dog and the love that is returned AND the gutty realism that the dog displays.The DVD includes a documentary about De Sica that I didn't have a chance to view, excellent subtitles, and a video interview with Maria Pia Casilio.I would almost say, see this for the dog, but do see this for Vittorio De Sica, one of cinema's greats, here at his best, and for Cesare Zavattini who wrote the compelling script.",5,A masterpiece of neorealism,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,4006,"['Having', 'seen', 'film', 'read', 'bit', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'booklet', 'excellent', 'review', 'Stuart', 'Klawans', 'bit', 'interview', 'director', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'What', 'learned', 'was', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'was', 'big', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'Italy', 'primarily', 'Italian', 'government', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'insulting', 'made', 'Italy', 'seem', 'so', 'unfeeling', 'poverty-stricken', 'mercantile', 'was', 'struck', 'yes', 'poor', 'Umberto', 'dog', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'set', 'out', 'pasture', 'so', 'much', 'grass', 'bone', 'say', 'film', 'entire', 'people', 'perhaps', 'protest', 'too', 'much.Italy', 'was', 'devastated', 'failure', 'fascism', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'recover', 'war', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'downers', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'film', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'downer', 'early', 'critics', 'thought', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'hopeful', 'Umberto', 'somewhat', 'inspiring', 'youthfulness', 'dog', 'sweet', 'humanity', 'maid', 'Maria', 'who', 'situation', 'alacrity', 'showing', 'affection', 'kindness', 'bitter', 'old', 'man.I', 'was', 'not', 'moved', 'tears', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Umberto', 'troubles', 'seem', 'privileged', 'vantage', 'point', 'time', 'place', 'somewhat', 'own', 'doing', 'imagined', 'supported', 'fascists', 'saw', 'poverty', 'old', 'age', 'direct', 'result', 'support', 'Barring', 'imagined', 'had', 'planned', 'poorly', 'old', 'age', 'rate', 'values', 'represented', 'always', 'wearing', 'suit', 'tie', 'hat', 'inability', 'beg', 'take', 'kind', 'job', 'disqualified', 'tears', 'course', 'was', 'unfair.Even', 'so', 'sympathy', 'was', 'respected', 'decision', 'finally', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'carry', 'out', 'unclear', 'respect', 'dignity', 'identify', 'struggle', 'Teutonic', 'utterly', 'bourgeois', 'landlord', 'who', 'sway', 'played', 'deliberately', 'heavy', 'presence', 'Lina', 'Gennari', 'whom', 'De', 'Sica', 'up', 'close', 'low', 'large', 'body', 'emphasize', 'strength', 'make', 'clear', 'Umberto', 'chance', 'struggle', 'Carlo', 'Battisti', 'who', 'played', 'Umberto', 'Maria', 'Pia', 'Casilio', 'who', 'played', 'Maria', 'were', 'considered', 'amateur', 'actors', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'neorealistic', 'school', 'film', 'yet', 'were', 'excellent', 'natural', 'whereas', 'Gennari', 'who', 'was', 'professional', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'impression', 'artifact', 'neorealist', 'school', 'say', 'died', 'film', 'very', 'fact', 'flourishes', 'modeling', 'certainly', 'flights', 'creativity', 'actors', 'was', 'believed', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'realistic', 'about', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'situations.Today', 'course', 'celebrated', 'film', 'considered', 'one', 'De', 'Sica', 'best', 'believed', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'even', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'make', 'money', 'producers.A', 'word', 'dog', 'other', 'professional', 'actor', 'film', 'Flike', 'extraordinarily', 'well-trained', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'psychology', 'film', 'very', 'heart', 'denouement', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Umberto', 'rail', 'guard', 'train', 'approaches', 'Flike', 'held', 'close', 'chest', 'scene', 'one', 'great', 'sequences', 'cinema', 'ironically', 'commercial', 'film', 'dog', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'dog', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'dog', 'lovers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'love', 'Umberto', 'feels', 'dog', 'love', 'returned', 'gutty', 'realism', 'dog', 'displays.The', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'De', 'Sica', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'view', 'excellent', 'subtitles', 'video', 'interview', 'Maria', 'Pia', 'Casilio.I', 'would', 'almost', 'say', 'see', 'dog', 'do', 'see', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'one', 'cinema', 'greats', 'here', 'best', 'Cesare', 'Zavattini', 'who', 'wrote', 'compelling', 'script']",N/A

The landlady is more concerned about fattening her wallet than about helping the elderly gentleman. The only person who shows him kindness is Maria, the maid. She is pregnant with child and neither of the men that she has slept with wants to be a father to the baby. She is in a tight spot herself as she wonders where she will be once the landlady is married to her rich boyfriend.Umberto D. explores how people treat senior citizens. It is the elderly that we look up to and seek guidance. In this movie, the elderly, like Umberto D., are treated like they are almost nonexistent. Italy is recouperating from the losses of the war. The people are struggling to get by and the family binds start to break as men and women try to find a place for themselves in the developing country.Umberto D. who has no family, or anyone to fall back on, struggles alone to face a world that is at most, cruel to him. The only companion he has is his dog Flike. Flike is always with him. He is the only being that keeps Umberto going until Umberto has to move out of the lady's house.This movie almost reminds me of Balzac's Old Goriot, in which Goriot, now an elderly man, is living in a boarding house separated from his daughters who are married to gain social acceptance and status. The landlady represents that of Old Goriot's daughters who are trying to gain economic stability at the expense of exploiting other people such as Maria and Umberto D.Umberto D. is a timeless classic that still conveys a message as to how we treat persons of seniority.",5,A Beautiful Moving Portrait of the Elderly,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,1723,"['bittersweet', 'movie', 'story', 'elderly', 'statesman', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'lucrative', 'job', 'government', 'now', 'living', 'pension', 'can', 'barely', 'pay', 'bills', 'rent', 'landlady', 'more', 'concerned', 'fattening', 'wallet', 'helping', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'kindness', 'Maria', 'maid', 'pregnant', 'child', 'men', 'slept', 'be', 'father', 'baby', 'tight', 'spot', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'once', 'landlady', 'married', 'rich', 'boyfriend.Umberto', 'D.', 'how', 'people', 'treat', 'senior', 'citizens', 'elderly', 'look', 'up', 'seek', 'guidance', 'movie', 'elderly', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'are', 'treated', 'are', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'Italy', 'recouperating', 'losses', 'war', 'people', 'are', 'struggling', 'get', 'family', 'start', 'break', 'men', 'women', 'try', 'find', 'place', 'developing', 'country.Umberto', 'D.', 'who', 'family', 'anyone', 'fall', 'back', 'alone', 'face', 'world', 'most', 'cruel', 'only', 'companion', 'dog', 'Flike', 'Flike', 'always', 'only', 'being', 'Umberto', 'going', 'Umberto', 'move', 'lady', 'house.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'Balzac', 'Old', 'Goriot', 'Goriot', 'now', 'elderly', 'man', 'living', 'boarding', 'house', 'separated', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'gain', 'social', 'acceptance', 'status', 'landlady', 'Old', 'Goriot', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'gain', 'economic', 'stability', 'expense', 'exploiting', 'other', 'people', 'such', 'Maria', 'Umberto', 'D.Umberto', 'D.', 'timeless', 'classic', 'still', 'message', 'how', 'treat', 'persons', 'seniority']",N/A

Telling the story of the struggle with poverty in post-war Italy twice, from a changed perspective, has less of an impact. Moreover, it is less dramatic for an elderly man, with a dog being the only dependent, than another man in his thirties/forties, with a whole family to feed, not to make ends meet. Nonetheless, this film still packs enough emotional power to move its viewer. The protagonists' acting is superb though not so much so the acting in the supporting roles. All in all, leveraging non-professionals into maintaining the emotional tension, AND into borrowing the attributes of a documentary, is a concept wonderfully illustrated by the film.There is not much of a story to talk about in this film. A retired old man, former bureaucrat in the Mussolini's regime, has a hard time in keeping up with the new times: a pension smaller than the rent for a room in a house, people around him who either cannot help or do not care to, and the announced eviction. There is a mix of dignity and egotistical stubbornness that makes the viewer oscillate between empathy and reprobation towards this character. On the other hand, the young maid is representative for a new social trend: young, uneducated, compassionate, and, by comparison with the old man at least, with relaxed morals. Again, this film is about the complex emotions developing around the main character(s) and less about a story.As for the whole noise passing as commentary, coming from the left though not always, one may well ignore it. To this point, I found it interesting that, in real life, Maria Pia charged the producers 2 Mil. Lire in 1952, when she was only 15 years old, while the old man in the film could not come up with 15000 Lire for the life in him...And now a word about the director. De Sica, by catering to the mores of the up and coming Italian politics (i.e. of the left) and American cultural administrators, is the illustration of the new class while illustrating the decadence of the old.

375011,ALJWRGOANWDWJ,6303449050,Jack-O-Lantern,"[4, 8]","Many have said that this film officially ended the great era of Italian neo-realism in film.  This may or may not be so, however if true one can certainly see why after even a single viewing.  Unlike other neo-realist classics such as Visconti's &quot;La Terra Trema,&quot; this film does not work on an overtly emotional level.Umberto D. is not, shall we say, a particularly sentimental character.  He has been hardened emotionally not only by poverty, but also by the callousness of those around him, who are more interested in getting on with the business of post-war reconstruction.  As such, Umberto has virtually lost touch with humanity (with notable exceptions such as the maid, whom he can honestly count as a friend).  Umberto is thus not particularly likeable, and what's left of his better nature is lavished on his dog, rather than on people.  Umberto is also not particularly in touch with his peers, elderly pensioners who have planned well for their old age and thus are not in the same desperate situation as he.Why is Umberto 15,000 lire in debt to his landlady?  Why hasn't he paid the rent for over a year?  And as such, can we honestly fault the supposedly &quot;evil&quot; landlady for kicking this man out of her home?  After all, he's not exactly a nice guy, and neither has he paid her for his living arrangements for quite a long time.  It's thus taking the easy way out to see Umberto solely as a victim of society...he is also a victim of the mismanagement of his own life.And this, rather than any overtly sentimental issue, is what makes this film so devastatingly haunting.  While watching this film, I could only think, &quot;There but for the grace...go I.&quot;  Umberto's situation is a universal one, as many of us will eventually face the time when we must retire and rely heavily on the government to provide the income necessary to survive.  And, as we all also know,  that compensation (whether it be Italy's pension or America's social security) is rarely enough to survive, much less to lead an enriching and happy life after retirement.  Yes, Umberto is more than somewhat to blame for his situation, however the accumulation of debt is something most of us have had to deal with at one time or another.  Ultimately Umberto D. is everyman and, as such, we end up sympathizing deeply for an ostensibly unsympathetic character.Umberto's choices later in the film are deeply moving and ring true--even if we don't particularly like the man.  This basic conflict (sympathizing and identifying with a character whom we probably wouldn't associate with if we met him today) is at the core of this wonderful film.  Umberto's basic humanity is still &quot;in there&quot; somewhere--it has simply been compromised and, on many levels, eliminated by the machinations of a cold, self-focused, and unthinking world.Highly recommended, though I didn't need my handkerchief as many have noted here.  I was taken by this film to a place beyond tears, beyond sentimentality.  How refreshing.

375012,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6303449050,Jeff  Farrow,"[0, 0]","This was one of many European ""Art House"" films released in the U.S. in the middle to late 60's. It is a very simple B&W; movie, with an easy plot, no surrealism or complicated, intellectual sub-themes. Vittorio De Sica is known today as one of the great neo-realistic directors.The title UMBERTO, D (last name, first name reduced to initial only)refers to the main character, an aging male pensioner who shares a rented room with his small dog. The title sets up the backdrop of the unseen bureaucracy dealing with faceless ""clients"" (""victims"" may be more apt) like Umberto.The story opens with the end of a rally organized by elderly men (no one else bothers to attend) protesting pension cuts. The police arrive to break up the crowd (potentially breaking a few arms & legs in the process.) Umberto is one of a small group who hobble off together. It appears that he is also the only one without a shelter contingency plan. He can no longer continue to afford his rent.He goes back to his room & chats with the young cleaning woman who also lives in the house. She is the only one who's nice to him & they share the easy friendship of two poor people outside the social loop. As it happens, they have to speak on the sly because the woman who owns the house doesn't want the maid to ""waste her time"". She constantly reminds Umberto that he is behind in his rent. Additionally she hints that she is getting married and will need to have the room back so she can renovate it. The woman is a singer & acts like a middle-age yuppie with no concern for the impact her gentrification will have on others. Later the maid finds out that she (the maid) is pregnant & arranges to move back to the country with an aunt before ""the lady"" she works for tosses her out.One would expect the character of Umberto to be very sympathetic, but it's really not. He's neither positive or negative. He's just an old man. Sometimes nice, sometimes cranky, pretty much always tired. He's got a lot on his plate & needs to get organized, a lot to get gone, but without the energy to do it. Nonetheless, he tries. The only close relationship he has (other than with the young girl) is with his small dog.One day he goes out to pawn his watch & try to line-up another place to live. When he returns (unsuccessful in his efforts), he discovers that his dog has gotton out (possibly deliberately engineered by the landlady). Umberto is naturally frantic & searches for his pet. Finally he winds up at the city dog pound (not even the euphemism of ""shelter"" in this case.) He witnesses a very disturbing scene illustrating how society deals with unwanted animals--in other words, pretty much the way it treats poor & unwanted elderly men (& women).Umberto finds his little dog & takes him home--only to find that the walls of his room have literally been demolished. He bundles up his few belongings in an old suitcase, takes his dog & leaves, but with no place really to go.The final scene finds him standing in the center of a train track, holding the dog tightly to his chest, the train rushing down with whistle blowing. You want to close your eyes because you think you know what's going to happen next.But it doesn't.What does happen is even more disturbing, more tragic because it's so true.This movie has had a lasting influence on my life like no other film has. I've held back reviewing it because I wasn't sure about sharing its very personal & painful vision. Animal lovers will also find it difficult & wrenching, but they are the ones who will most appreciate what a great work of art this simple movie really is.Mamma Roma - Criterion CollectionYesterday, Today and TomorrowBicycle Thieves (Criterion Collection)Roma Citta LiberaThe Children Are Watching Us - Criterion CollectionThe Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie - Criterion CollectionFanny and Alexander (Special Edition Five-Disc Set) - Criterion CollectionAutumn SonataViolette",5,Old People & Unwanted Dogs,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,3924,"['was', 'one', 'many', 'European', 'Art', 'House', 'films', 'released', 'U.S.', 'middle', 'late', '60', 'very', 'simple', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'easy', 'plot', 'surrealism', 'complicated', 'intellectual', 'sub-themes', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'known', 'today', 'one', 'great', 'neo-realistic', 'directors.The', 'title', 'UMBERTO', 'D', 'last', 'name', 'first', 'name', 'reduced', 'initial', 'only', 'refers', 'main', 'character', 'aging', 'male', 'pensioner', 'who', 'shares', 'rented', 'room', 'small', 'dog', 'title', 'up', 'backdrop', 'unseen', 'bureaucracy', 'dealing', 'faceless', 'clients', 'victims', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'Umberto.The', 'story', 'end', 'rally', 'organized', 'elderly', 'men', 'one', 'else', 'attend', 'protesting', 'pension', 'cuts', 'police', 'arrive', 'break', 'up', 'crowd', 'potentially', 'breaking', 'few', 'arms', 'legs', 'process', 'Umberto', 'one', 'small', 'group', 'who', 'off', 'together', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'shelter', 'contingency', 'plan', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'continue', 'afford', 'rent.He', 'back', 'room', 'chats', 'young', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'house', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'nice', 'share', 'easy', 'friendship', 'two', 'poor', 'people', 'social', 'loop', 'have', 'speak', 'sly', 'woman', 'who', 'house', ""n't"", 'want', 'maid', 'waste', 'time', 'constantly', 'Umberto', 'rent', 'Additionally', 'getting', 'married', 'will', 'need', 'have', 'room', 'back', 'can', 'renovate', 'woman', 'singer', 'acts', 'middle-age', 'yuppie', 'concern', 'impact', 'gentrification', 'will', 'have', 'others', 'Later', 'maid', 'out', 'maid', 'pregnant', 'move', 'back', 'country', 'aunt', 'lady', 'tosses', 'out.One', 'would', 'expect', 'character', 'Umberto', 'be', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'really', 'not', 'positive', 'negative', 'just', 'old', 'man', 'Sometimes', 'nice', 'sometimes', 'cranky', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'tired', 'got', 'lot', 'plate', 'needs', 'get', 'organized', 'lot', 'get', 'gone', 'energy', 'do', 'Nonetheless', 'only', 'close', 'relationship', 'other', 'young', 'girl', 'small', 'dog.One', 'day', 'out', 'pawn', 'watch', 'try', 'line-up', 'place', 'live', 'When', 'unsuccessful', 'efforts', 'dog', 'gotton', 'out', 'possibly', 'deliberately', 'engineered', 'landlady', 'Umberto', 'naturally', 'frantic', 'searches', 'pet', 'Finally', 'up', 'city', 'dog', 'pound', 'not', 'even', 'euphemism', 'shelter', 'case', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'illustrating', 'how', 'society', 'deals', 'unwanted', 'animals', 'other', 'words', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'poor', 'unwanted', 'elderly', 'men', 'women', '.Umberto', 'little', 'dog', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'walls', 'room', 'have', 'literally', 'been', 'demolished', 'up', 'few', 'belongings', 'old', 'suitcase', 'dog', 'leaves', 'place', 'really', 'go.The', 'final', 'scene', 'standing', 'center', 'train', 'track', 'holding', 'dog', 'tightly', 'chest', 'train', 'rushing', 'down', 'whistle', 'blowing', 'want', 'close', 'eyes', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'happen', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'more', 'tragic', 'so', 'true.This', 'movie', 'had', 'lasting', 'influence', 'life', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'held', 'back', 'reviewing', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'sharing', 'very', 'personal', 'painful', 'vision', 'Animal', 'lovers', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'difficult', 'wrenching', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'most', 'appreciate', 'what', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'simple', 'movie', 'really', 'is.Mamma', 'Roma', 'Criterion', 'CollectionYesterday', 'Today', 'TomorrowBicycle', 'Thieves', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Roma', 'Citta', 'LiberaThe', 'Children', 'Are', 'Watching', 'Us', 'Criterion', 'CollectionThe', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', 'Criterion', 'CollectionFanny', 'Alexander', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Five-Disc', 'Set', 'Criterion', 'CollectionAutumn', 'SonataViolette']",N/A
375013,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,6303449050,J. Friday,"[3, 13]","Note: I made a review. Didn't like it. So now I'm making a new one.Umberto D is an old man struggling to make a living on the inadequate funds of his pension. That's the basic plot.*spoilers*My main problem with Umberto D is he couldn't invoke sympathy from me. He seemed like a truly resourceful man. Yet he comes across as lazy. He also comes across as trying to hard to guilt trip others. One example, he is selling his encyclopedias to the outdoor stall and in the end says, ""I give them to you because I'm sick."" And he tries to make it seem as if he's being swindled. But he has to realize street stall businessmen don't make a lot of money. Having a brick and mortar store is much better. In the street, his products are exposed to the elements like rain and wind. Plus, it's easier for people to steal when his back is turned. In addition, Italy during 1952 had around a 50% literacy rating. So there wasn't a lot of market for old, worn-out encyclopedias. The man at the stall was going out on a limb buying them in the first place.Another example: Umberto wanted change for 100 lira. The man said he didn't have. Then Umberto bought a product and got change for it. Before he left he gave the man a reproaching look. I thought that was unnecessary. Like I said, street stall businessmen don't make a lot of money. I've gone into business myself. It's annoying when you constantly get customers who pay for purchases that are around $5 or less with $20s, $50s, and even $100s. Small change goes a lot quicker than people think. There are only so many big bills for small purchases a businessman can take. He should save giving small bills to the customers, not to anyone who asks. He's not a banker.Another example: Umberto judges the adulterous woman for being deceitful. But isn't he deceitful when he feigns illness in order to find a place to sleep at the hospital? He even takes tips on how to scam the staff from the hustler in the next bed.Another example: Umberto judges his landlady for wanting to turn her rundown apartment into a luxury apartment. However, all she wants is for him to pay the rent and be a good tenant. Paying rent is tough for some people. But that's the way life works. I don't think it is wrong for the landlady to want to move from being a slum landlord to a landlord of a luxury apartment. If there's a market for it, why not? She's getting older in years and she may not have much opportunity to become rich in the future. She has been the landlady of a rundown apartment and didn't like it. So she's upgrading. What's wrong with that?Umberto couldn't ilicit sympathy from me. He was trying too hard. But he was unable to see other people are struggling as well. He tries to be sympathetic but his selfish side comes out. I would have liked to see this movie as a comedy of a man trying to swindle people and fails. It would have been funny to team him up with the hustler in the hospital. The only person who got my sympathy was the man Umberto met at the cafeteria. The man bought Umberto's watch with all his money and even threw in extra stuff. Then the man went to begging on the street. Umberto's selfishness would never allow him to give away all his funds to help another. Nor would Umberto's pride wouldn't allow him to beg on the street.

375019,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,6303449050,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[4, 14]","The story line of Umberto D. could be the story of any man in any western country caught up in old age by changes he couldn't understand without sufficient resources to survive. Urbanization had loosened family and other ties in Italy and indeed all over Europe, and many men in the post-war period found themselves alone in the city without anyone to turn to in times of personal crisis.The movie opens with a group of pensioners marching through the streets of Rome demanding an increase in their pensions. After all, a new system was in place after the defeat of the old order and rampant inflation was eating away at their pensions' value. The march was broken up gently by the police and the marchers were ordered to disperse as they had no permit.Umberto is one of these men and the film chronicles this one man's struggle with the reality of his redundancy. He eats in a soup kitchen (and gives half of his food to his dog) and his daily life revolves around trying to scrounge up enough money to bring his rent payments current by selling off his better possessions. He occasionally crosses paths with old &quot;friends&quot; from better days, but when they learn of his plight, they turn their backs on him.He can't bring himself to beg. When on the brink of success at his first begging attempt, pride causes him to turn away and refuse what is offered.He cares most for his dog Flike and for the maid in his ant-ridden penzione who befriends him. None of his half-baked attempts to come up with his rent arrears succeed including his feigning illness in order to be admitted to a charity hospital, thereby saving the meagre soup-kitchen fee for a few days. When he returns home from the hospital and finds his landlady had knocked a hole in the wall of his room, let his dog loose in the street and was planning to make his room part of a larger reception room, he fled and frantically searched for his dog at the pound where it would be put to death if unclaimed.Reunited with his dog and facing eviction, he felt the only way out was suicide. He even failed at that and momentarily lost the trust of his beloved Flike.Umberto's plight is tragic, but it is the plight of one who fails to plan for the contingency of old age. He was somewhat a victim of circumstance, but was also a victim of poor choices. When one can barely afford to live, having a pet is stupid. Umberto had no family apparently. Why did he stay in expensive Rome? Why did he not save any money when he was still working as a civil servant? Though his situation is sad, he brought many of his problems on himself. No hankies for me.What I liked most about the film is its stark aspect. Black and white film accentuates the film-maker's portrayal of the drabness of everyday life in post-war Rome. What I found most surprising is that bus and lorry drivers were prepared to run over anyone in their path who did not clear out fast enough. This was demonstrated several times, once at the beginning where the buses just scatter the pension marchers without slowing and may have been the film-maker's way of portraying man's callous indifference to man.Carlo Battisti, an untrained actor, gives an excellent performance as the pitiful Umberto. It is actually quite unforgettable. Film fans looking for action and excitement are advised to avoid Umberto D. It is certainly not for everyone, but it is a must-see for foreign film buffs.

It struck me as a movie that focussed on the eternal challenge of Hope vs. Despair.  We get the idea right from the opening scene that this is about an elderly pensioner whose fixed income is way behind the inflated Lire.  His is a shared dilemna but there doesn't seem to be too much sympathy out there.  He is determined that he will not be evicted from his apartment and spends his hours plotting, pawning, and pleading.  Along the way, we come to know Umberto, his landlady, the housemaid, and a number of other characters including his dog Flike.  Eventually, the problems come to a head.  Umberto has made his decision and is prepared to implement it but one minor problem arises.  In the end, Umberto's battle between Hope and Despair finds its' winner.I found myself thinking of the movie ""Harry and Tonto"" as I was watching ""Umberto D.""  I'm not sure why I share that here because ""Umberto D."" is clearly the superior movie.  I remember my cousin trying to describe ""Harry and Tonto"".  All she could say was it was about an old man and a cat that go on a trip.  Some may come away from ""Umberto D."" with a similar conclusion.The greatness of ""Umberto D."" is in its'direction.  The acting is good but it is the director who puts everything together in a way that leaves us feeling that we have been invited to share, for a few days, the private life of a private man.  It is that intimacy that makes us glad we were able watch this movie.  In Umberto's challenges, we come across people who don't care, people who do care and people who'd like to care but they have more pressing things to.  In our appreciation of Umberto's plight, we are given our our challenge to figure out which category of caring describes us.

The plight of the old man should remind us of how important social programs are, in particular as the baby boomers age while resources appear to be dwindling.  There is a real danger in the West of social upheaval between generations over the coming decade.The plot is about an impoverished pensioner who had worked his whole life and could not make his ends meet in retirement.  His landlady is cruel and dismissive, announcing that he must pay up or get ejected from the room he rents from her.  There is an awful scene when he arrives home, only to find that a couple had temporarily rented his room for sex.  Everywhere he turns, no one except for the live-in maid of the apartment has any sympathy for him, and she has her own problems to contend with.  Even his old friends from his former civil service bureau will not help him.  Without children or family, the only durable relationship he has is with a dog, Flike, who provides an emotional anchor for him that orders his life.Though there are some maudlin moments, for the most part this is a starkly realist film, perhaps the best of the Neo-Realist genre in post-war Italy as many say here.

He lives in an apartment with his pet dog, Flike, but is facing eviction due to his inability to keep up with the rent.  Umberto finds a sympathetic ear in Maria (Maria-Pia Casilio), the maid in his apartment complex, but he knows there is not much she can do to help him.

It follows the story of an elderly man, Umberto D. Ferrari, who is living off a pension that is running out quickly and his closest companion is his dog. His landlady is evil, demanding rent he cannot afford, rents his room out to prostitutes while he is not there, and is downright mean.The acting is extraordinary. Especially since the actors in the film has no prior training and the film is the lead actor's only film role ever. The dog is probably the only professional actor in the film. Even so, the acting is better than many films with professional actors.I find this film to be a very touching story and shows how close a bond a person can have with their animals. Umberto, though dirt poor, pays a very heavy fine to get his dog out of the pound after having run away. His dog even forgives him after a very cruel act his master committed while he was severly depressed.The DVD has some fine special features also.There is a documentary about the director titled, ""That's Life: Vittorio De Sica,"" and interview with Maria Pia Casilio, who played the role of Maria in the film and also transcripts of renarks about the film by several well-known figures including Umberto Eco.This film is a must for dog lovers!",5,One of the most touching films I have ever seen.,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,1342,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'eiditon', 'film.Umberto', 'D.', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'elderly', 'man', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'Ferrari', 'who', 'living', 'off', 'pension', 'running', 'out', 'quickly', 'closest', 'companion', 'dog', 'landlady', 'evil', 'demanding', 'rent', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'room', 'prostitutes', 'not', 'there', 'downright', 'mean.The', 'acting', 'extraordinary', 'Especially', 'actors', 'film', 'prior', 'training', 'film', 'lead', 'actor', 'only', 'film', 'role', 'ever', 'dog', 'probably', 'only', 'professional', 'actor', 'film', 'Even', 'so', 'acting', 'better', 'many', 'films', 'professional', 'actors.I', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'how', 'close', 'bond', 'person', 'can', 'have', 'animals', 'Umberto', 'dirt', 'poor', 'very', 'heavy', 'fine', 'get', 'dog', 'pound', 'having', 'run', 'away', 'dog', 'even', 'very', 'cruel', 'act', 'master', 'committed', 'was', 'severly', 'depressed.The', 'DVD', 'fine', 'special', 'features', 'documentary', 'director', 'titled', 'Life', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'interview', 'Maria', 'Pia', 'Casilio', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'Maria', 'film', 'also', 'transcripts', 'renarks', 'film', 'several', 'well-known', 'figures', 'including', 'Umberto', 'Eco.This', 'film', 'must', 'dog', 'lovers']",N/A

The film is done so well that it is hard to forget.The basic story is the struggles of a poor pensioner and his dog in war-torn post-World War II Italy.  The film is compelling largely due to De Sica's neorealist technique which involves nonprofessional actors and real on-location shots instead of studio lots.I believe it is better than Bicycle Thieves because of its emotional content.  It is basically impossible not to empathize with the old man.  Even the dog is portrayed in this manner.The only part I found fault with was the train scene.  De Sica should have stuck with the train approaching and the result without including the middle scene which was apparently artificial.,5,DE SICA'S BEST MOVIE,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,780,"['simply', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'probably', 'best', 'Italian', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'forget.The', 'basic', 'story', 'struggles', 'poor', 'pensioner', 'dog', 'war-torn', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'Italy', 'film', 'compelling', 'largely', 'due', 'De', 'Sica', 'neorealist', 'technique', 'nonprofessional', 'actors', 'real', 'on-location', 'shots', 'instead', 'studio', 'lots.I', 'believe', 'better', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'emotional', 'content', 'basically', 'impossible', 'not', 'empathize', 'old', 'man', 'Even', 'dog', 'portrayed', 'manner.The', 'only', 'part', 'found', 'fault', 'was', 'train', 'scene', 'De', 'Sica', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'train', 'approaching', 'result', 'including', 'middle', 'scene', 'was', 'apparently', 'artificial']",N/A

I like how the movie ends.(spolier alert) Umberto plans to kill himself but he wants to find a loving home for his beloved dog flag first. He first tries to give money to a man to take care of the dog but he already has a mean dog that flag seems scared of and it seems that umberto cant trust them to take care of him. Then he goes to the park and sees a little girl who he knows that always like the dog but and saids that the little girl  can have him but her parents say no. Then umberto leaves and hides but flag finds him so umberto desides to take the dog with him while he tries to kill himself by jumping in front of a train. But the dog freaks out and leaves him. Umberto then go's after him but flag feelings are hurt. Then he starts playing with flag and then flag forgives him. That is how the movie ends with a sort of happing ending. Of course Umberto still has problems but as long as he has his dog by him he would be fine. Another thing this is a great double feature with the bicycle theif why cant some company put these great movies together.,4,Have a box of tissue near by.,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,1183,"['first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'TCM', 'i', 'cried', 'ass', 'towards', 'end', 'guess', 'i', 'am', 'sucker', 'movies', 'dogs', 'how', 'movie', 'spolier', 'alert', 'Umberto', 'kill', 'find', 'loving', 'home', 'beloved', 'dog', 'flag', 'first', 'first', 'give', 'money', 'man', 'take', 'care', 'dog', 'already', 'mean', 'dog', 'flag', 'scared', 'umberto', 'cant', 'trust', 'take', 'care', 'Then', 'park', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'dog', 'saids', 'little', 'girl', 'can', 'have', 'parents', 'say', 'Then', 'umberto', 'leaves', 'hides', 'flag', 'so', 'umberto', 'desides', 'take', 'dog', 'kill', 'jumping', 'front', 'train', 'dog', 'out', 'Umberto', 'then', 'go', 'flag', 'feelings', 'are', 'hurt', 'Then', 'playing', 'flag', 'then', 'flag', 'forgives', 'how', 'movie', 'sort', 'happing', 'ending', 'course', 'Umberto', 'still', 'problems', 'as', 'long', 'dog', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'thing', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'bicycle', 'theif', 'why', 'cant', 'company', 'put', 'great', 'movies', 'together']",N/A
