1072609,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000PMGS72,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 15]","With early comparisons to ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip,"" I wasn't expecting much when I saw SURF SCHOOL in its brief theatrical run locally. Actually, I *like* mindless, escapist fluff comedies, and was prepared for one of those here. What I found was one of the most gawd-awful 90 minutes I ever spent in a theater (which, incidentally, was EMPTY except for the two of us!)The plot was simplistic but had potential: typical ""fish out of water"" scenario, with East Coast transfer student Jordan (Corey Sevier) feeling out of place in a Laguna Beach high school run by a group of championship surfers, led by Tyler (Ryan Carnes). He bands together with other misfits at the school, including a geeky punk, silent goth girl and a perpetual virgin nerd, and enrolls in a surf school prior to the high school surfing championship in Costa Rica. Got the ending figured out yet? No surprises, believe me.Most of the comic relief is provided by the alcoholic former ""surf dude"" who runs the school (overplayed beyond endurance by Harland Williams), and a couple of oversexed 60's era hippies who run the place where they are staying. Whatever funny moments there are (including a running gag by Williams inviting people for ""mahi-mahi"" and a chimp ""flirting"" with the virgin nerd) are overdone until they lose their appeal. And the film is filled with patronizing stereotypes, from three gorgeous Sweedish tourists to the illogical choice of a flaming campy gay MC at the surf championship. The dialog meanders in illogical circles, leaving the audience scratching their heads in confusion and wondering if this was mostly ad-libbed. The outtakes over the closing credits are better than some of the scenes left in the film.Only played - briefly - in a handful of theatres nationwide.  The writer/director should consider some other line of work.",1,Gets my vote as one of the WORST movies ever made!,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1840,"['early', 'comparisons', 'American', 'Pie', 'Road', 'Trip', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'saw', 'SURF', 'SCHOOL', 'brief', 'theatrical', 'run', 'locally', 'Actually', '*like*', 'mindless', 'escapist', 'fluff', 'comedies', 'was', 'prepared', 'one', 'here', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'gawd-awful', '90', 'minutes', 'ever', 'spent', 'theater', 'incidentally', 'was', 'EMPTY', 'two', 'plot', 'was', 'simplistic', 'had', 'potential', 'typical', 'fish', 'water', 'scenario', 'East', 'Coast', 'transfer', 'student', 'Jordan', 'Corey', 'Sevier', 'feeling', 'place', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'high', 'school', 'run', 'group', 'championship', 'surfers', 'led', 'Tyler', 'Ryan', 'Carnes', 'together', 'other', 'misfits', 'school', 'including', 'geeky', 'punk', 'silent', 'girl', 'perpetual', 'virgin', 'nerd', 'enrolls', 'surf', 'school', 'prior', 'high', 'school', 'surfing', 'championship', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'Got', 'ending', 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'No', 'surprises', 'believe', 'me.Most', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'alcoholic', 'former', 'surf', 'dude', 'who', 'school', 'overplayed', 'endurance', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'couple', 'oversexed', '60', 'era', 'hippies', 'who', 'run', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'staying', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'including', 'running', 'gag', 'Williams', 'inviting', 'people', 'mahi-mahi', 'chimp', 'flirting', 'virgin', 'nerd', 'are', 'overdone', 'lose', 'appeal', 'film', 'filled', 'patronizing', 'stereotypes', 'three', 'gorgeous', 'Sweedish', 'tourists', 'illogical', 'choice', 'flaming', 'campy', 'gay', 'MC', 'surf', 'championship', 'dialog', 'meanders', 'illogical', 'circles', 'leaving', 'audience', 'scratching', 'heads', 'confusion', 'wondering', 'was', 'mostly', 'ad-libbed', 'outtakes', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'better', 'scenes', 'left', 'film.Only', 'played', 'briefly', 'handful', 'theatres', 'nationwide', 'writer/director', 'should', 'consider', 'other', 'line', 'work']",Surf School

He is shirtless, but for such short snippets. This kid should be prohibited from wearing any clothing. On top of such an awesome body sits a beautiful face and hairdo. Ryan Carnes is gorgeous also, but we don't see enough of him. Corey has never made any great movies. I think producers are jealous of his assets and are intimidated. He has made some equally bad horror movies, but he wears a beard covering that pretty face and never takes his shirt off.

I like surfer movies, I like teen comedies, I like to see girls in bikinis or less: so I looked forward to watching this flick during its brief stay in the theater.  Unfortunately, this film is not funny and the characters are types that have been done to death and the actors are achingly boring to watch. The photography is technically sound (kudos to the film crew) but the surfing is put to shame by movies like Blue Crush.  So the film is boring as a comedy and as a surf film and poorly acted:  What about the girls?  Well, there are three very attractive blondes who play beach bimbos (blonde roles are such racist stereotypes) and who briefly bare their [...].  Other than that there's really nothing to see, not even any superior bikini shots.  Question for the prospective buyer:  are quick T shots worth $[...] for a used DVD and 90 minutes of your life?

Parrish,"[0, 0]","If like my granddaughter your chief interest in this movie is staring at Corey Sevier's ripped surfer's body (he was also the surfer in the short lived TV series 'North Shore') then you'll enjoy it no end, but if, like me, you like a modicum of depth to the script then you'll be bored to death.  There are lots of characters who deserved much better development in this flick (the couple who own the place where the kids stay in Costa Rica are a genuine hoot).  However if I have to hear Harlan Williams say 'Mahi Mahi' one more time I'll hurl....There's some fun stuff...there's some dull stuff...there's very very little plot development beyond the obvious...and no surprises at all...but again my granddaughter sat enraptured whenever Corey had screen time so I guess it's got some redeeming quality within a certain narrowly focused teen fantasy world.

In the history of teen/twenty-something comedies, there may never before have been a movie as clich&eacute; as Surf School. Following the genre formula to a tee, there are a ton of cheesy jokes, ridiculous situations, and good looking people wearing very very little. Three guys, Three girls, a quirky old couple, a veteran comedy actor making a cameo, it has it all, and it's absolutely as cheesy as it gets. The movie isn't funny, the story isn't good, and the acting is very bland. It was pretty much everything I expected when I added it to my queue.
