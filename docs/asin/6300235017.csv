Taegel,"[6, 6]","Although someone has been good enough to re-word the tagline on its re-release, I assure you the way I have it written in my title was the original tag for DEADLY PREY.  Required viewing for all fans of Exploitation Cinema, the world's greatest comedy writers couldn't write a better parody of 80's action flicks than DEADLY PREY.  To be clear, DEADLY PREY was not intended to be a comedy, but it's one of the most hilarious things I've ever watched in my life.  It's a mix between The Most Dangerous Game and Rambo: First Blood Part 2.  Our hero, Danton, is a former Special Forces soldier who earned his stripes in Viet Nam.  But now he lives in suburbia with his lovely wife.  Until some Mercs set up camp nearby and start hunting people as part of their training.  Sure enough, Danton gets captured.  Oiled from head to toe and wearing only in a pair of jean shorts and a mullet, soon the hunted becomes the hunter.  Hence the name of the film, DEADLY PREY.  If you have any doubts about this film, check out a trailer on youtube.  And don't think all the good stuff is in the trailer.  You really have no idea.  Deadly Prey isn't to be missed.",5,"""He was the best in Viet Nam.

224444,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6300235017,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","The 80's and 90's were two decades where action B reached new heights that still can't be duplicated to this very day. There's been plenty of attempts, they dig...they test, but the modern day action movies simple cannot compete. Thankfully there are so many of these incredible movies available via internet now that you can just about find anything now matter how obscure they may be. That is how we achieved this afternoons discovery of a surreal experience known as Deadly Prey. If there's few action movies you watch in your lifetime, make sure this is one of them. It encompasses one of the most prolific concepts in B....the human Safari. This is an idea that never gets old no matter how times we've seen it. Obviously our 1994 viewing of the masterpieceDeath Ringgave us this biased opinion which we'll never shed. Deadly Prey predated Death Ring, and we'd like to think that our favorite movie gained a lot of inspiration from a viewing this gem. Now no matter which way you slice it, Death Ring is still the superior film and will never be challenged out of the top spot. But if you were going to take a shot at the title then Deadly Prey would be a very worthy opponent. It's best defined as a crossbreed of Death Ring and Rambo....with way more mullets. If that doesn't grab your attention then we don't know what would.Deadly Prey opens up right in the middle of a human hunt where a overweight Spanish fellow is on the run for his life. After the peg him with a grenade and shoot him dead it becomes evident that these hunters mean business. Just to be clear, the grenade didn't kill him because in action B exploding grenades simply force the person to hop up in the air and fall to the ground. Apparently no shrapnel occurs and the result is a quick fall to the ground that provides nothing more than a slight inconvenience for the subject. Obviously very realistic. The team reports to their evil Colonel who decides they need to find a more worthy hunt....this right here is all Death Ring. What they then do is drive around LA searching for the right specimen and come across a golden mulleted individual named Mike Danton as he's taking out his garbage. They knock him out and throw him in a van to bring to the secret hunting grounds. This was an obvious mistake as Mike Danton encompasses the same skill set as one Matt Collins. The hunters become the hunted as Danton rigs the entire forest with multiple traps which every hunter naturally walks right into. The fights in this one are that of legend. There was even some Mike Danton slow motion machine gun action exactly like John Blackwells. Facial expressions and all. When they can't stop Danton they decided to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom in order to bait him back to the camp....Death Ring all over the place here people! Obviously this does bait him back, however with undesirable results. His wife winds up getting shot and Danton goes mental. SO mental that he finds the guy who killed her, chops off his arm with a machete, beats him to near death with his own arm, then scalps him. Oh and he screams after he scalps him...and yes it's as incredible as it sounds. For the ultimate revenge he captures the evil Colonel and forces him to be the hunted subject now. Oh and after he tells the Colonel this he yet again raises his arms and screams.As Mike Danton screams the picture stills and the credits start to roll while your inconsolably laughing. The entire last half hour was action packed insanity jam packed with Rambo style flair. It's honestly as if Death Ring and Rambo combined forces to create a direct to video entry. Now that is something you simply can't argue with. There is even a fantastic moment that Mike Denton has to eat worms and snag himself a tasty rat for sustinance. While this is happening they cue up the sad music and show flashes of his wife at home wondering where he's been taken to. It's a very touching moment. With all our years of B viewings we were quite surprised Deadly Prey had never come up in discussion before. It's a film we should have watched back in the mid 90's on the pay channels the cable company forgot to shut off. It is so indicative of that time and would have been the perfect compliment to a B fueled Saturday evening so many years ago. It's unfortunate, but later is better than never and for that we are very thankful. Deadly Prey is a film that you MUST see if your an avid fan of the 80's-90's B actions. It's a film that you could most likely watch on an annual basis and never get bored with it's B perfection.",5,The day Death Ring met Rambo,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,4564,"['80', '90', 'were', 'two', 'decades', 'where', 'action', 'B', 'reached', 'new', 'heights', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'duplicated', 'very', 'day', 'been', 'plenty', 'attempts', 'dig', 'test', 'modern', 'day', 'action', 'movies', 'simple', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'Thankfully', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'incredible', 'movies', 'available', 'internet', 'now', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'find', 'anything', 'now', 'how', 'obscure', 'may', 'be', 'how', 'achieved', 'afternoons', 'discovery', 'surreal', 'experience', 'known', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'few', 'action', 'movies', 'watch', 'lifetime', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'concepts', 'B', '.the', 'human', 'Safari', 'idea', 'never', 'old', 'matter', 'how', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Obviously', '1994', 'viewing', 'masterpieceDeath', 'Ringgave', 'biased', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'never', 'shed', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'predated', 'Death', 'Ring', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'favorite', 'movie', 'gained', 'lot', 'inspiration', 'viewing', 'gem', 'Now', 'matter', 'way', 'slice', 'Death', 'Ring', 'still', 'superior', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'challenged', 'top', 'spot', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'shot', 'title', 'then', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'best', 'defined', 'crossbreed', 'Death', 'Ring', 'Rambo', '.with', 'way', 'more', 'mullets', ""n't"", 'grab', 'attention', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would.Deadly', 'Prey', 'up', 'right', 'middle', 'human', 'hunt', 'where', 'overweight', 'Spanish', 'fellow', 'run', 'life', 'peg', 'grenade', 'shoot', 'dead', 'evident', 'hunters', 'mean', 'business', 'Just', 'be', 'clear', 'grenade', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'because', 'action', 'B', 'exploding', 'grenades', 'simply', 'force', 'person', 'hop', 'up', 'air', 'fall', 'ground', 'Apparently', 'shrapnel', 'result', 'quick', 'fall', 'ground', 'nothing', 'more', 'slight', 'inconvenience', 'subject', 'Obviously', 'very', 'realistic', 'team', 'reports', 'evil', 'Colonel', 'who', 'need', 'find', 'more', 'worthy', 'hunt', '.this', 'right', 'here', 'Death', 'Ring', 'What', 'then', 'do', 'drive', 'LA', 'searching', 'right', 'specimen', 'come', 'golden', 'mulleted', 'individual', 'named', 'Mike', 'Danton', 'taking', 'out', 'garbage', 'knock', 'out', 'throw', 'van', 'bring', 'secret', 'hunting', 'grounds', 'was', 'obvious', 'mistake', 'Mike', 'Danton', 'same', 'skill', 'set', 'one', 'Matt', 'Collins', 'hunters', 'become', 'hunted', 'Danton', 'entire', 'forest', 'multiple', 'traps', 'hunter', 'naturally', 'walks', 'right', 'fights', 'one', 'are', 'legend', 'was', 'even', 'Mike', 'Danton', 'slow', 'motion', 'machine', 'gun', 'action', 'exactly', 'John', 'Blackwells', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Danton', 'decided', 'kidnap', 'wife', 'hold', 'ransom', 'order', 'bait', 'back', 'camp', '.Death', 'Ring', 'place', 'here', 'people', 'Obviously', 'bait', 'back', 'however', 'undesirable', 'results', 'wife', 'up', 'getting', 'shot', 'Danton', 'mental', 'SO', 'mental', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'arm', 'machete', 'death', 'own', 'arm', 'then', 'Oh', 'screams', 'scalps', 'yes', 'as', 'incredible', 'ultimate', 'revenge', 'evil', 'Colonel', 'forces', 'be', 'hunted', 'subject', 'now', 'Oh', 'Colonel', 'yet', 'again', 'arms', 'screams.As', 'Mike', 'Danton', 'picture', 'stills', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'inconsolably', 'laughing', 'entire', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'insanity', 'jam', 'packed', 'Rambo', 'style', 'flair', 'honestly', 'Death', 'Ring', 'Rambo', 'combined', 'forces', 'create', 'direct', 'video', 'entry', 'Now', 'something', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'even', 'fantastic', 'moment', 'Mike', 'Denton', 'eat', 'worms', 'snag', 'tasty', 'rat', 'sustinance', 'happening', 'cue', 'up', 'sad', 'music', 'show', 'flashes', 'wife', 'home', 'wondering', 'where', 'been', 'taken', 'very', 'touching', 'moment', 'years', 'B', 'viewings', 'were', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'had', 'never', 'come', 'up', 'discussion', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'back', 'mid', '90', 'pay', 'cable', 'company', 'forgot', 'shut', 'off', 'so', 'indicative', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'B', 'fueled', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'unfortunate', 'later', 'better', 'never', 'are', 'very', 'thankful', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'film', 'MUST', 'see', 'avid', 'fan', ""80's-90"", 'B', 'actions', 'film', 'could', 'most', 'likely', 'watch', 'annual', 'basis', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'B', 'perfection']",N/A
