Slipman,"[3, 3]","Burt Lancaster plays moralistic district attorney Hank Bell empowered with the prosecution of three teenagers for a cold blooded murder in acclaimed director John Frankenheimer's ""The Young Savages"".  The teens, members of a caucasian Harlem street gang The Thunderbirds knife to death a blind Puerto Rican boy in an obviously racially motivated episode.Popular sentiment is seeking a first degree murder indictment for the accused boys.  Lancaster's boss D.A. Dan Cole played by Edward Andrews has gubernatorial aspirations.  A fast conviction would seem to cement his chances.  Unfortunately Lancaster is torn.  One of the boys happens to be the son of ex-flame Shelley Winters.  In addition, Lancaster's wife played by the attractive Dina Merrill is at odds with him over the case providing him with no solace.  Lancaster is aided in his investigation by a pre-Kojak Telly Savalas playing a similar role as the cynical Lt. Gunderson.  They are forced to hit the streets which are ruled by violent ethnic gangs to get answers.The boys go to trial where the drama is ultimately played out.  ""The Young Savages"" is based on a plot that is very similar in context to ""West Side Story"" with similar tragic sequellae.",4,New York turf war murder,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,1214,"['Burt', 'Lancaster', 'moralistic', 'district', 'attorney', 'Hank', 'Bell', 'empowered', 'prosecution', 'three', 'teenagers', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murder', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'Young', 'Savages', 'teens', 'members', 'caucasian', 'Harlem', 'street', 'gang', 'Thunderbirds', 'knife', 'death', 'blind', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'boy', 'obviously', 'racially', 'motivated', 'episode.Popular', 'sentiment', 'seeking', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'indictment', 'accused', 'boys', 'Lancaster', 'boss', 'D.A', 'Dan', 'Cole', 'played', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'gubernatorial', 'aspirations', 'fast', 'conviction', 'would', 'seem', 'cement', 'chances', 'Unfortunately', 'Lancaster', 'torn', 'One', 'boys', 'be', 'son', 'ex-flame', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'addition', 'Lancaster', 'wife', 'played', 'attractive', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'odds', 'case', 'providing', 'solace', 'Lancaster', 'aided', 'investigation', 'pre-Kojak', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'playing', 'similar', 'role', 'cynical', 'Lt.', 'Gunderson', 'are', 'forced', 'hit', 'streets', 'are', 'ruled', 'violent', 'ethnic', 'gangs', 'get', 'answers.The', 'boys', 'go', 'trial', 'where', 'drama', 'ultimately', 'played', 'out', 'Young', 'Savages', 'based', 'plot', 'very', 'similar', 'context', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'similar', 'tragic', 'sequellae']",The Young Savages VHS

425847,A7Y6AVS576M03,630449436X,gobirds2,"[0, 0]",THE YOUNG SAVAGES is visually a very stark film. I love this film's resolute perseverance for truth and its enigmatic point of view. The acting is first-rate. I saw this film when it was first released and I have never forgotten it. John Frankenheimer's films have that effect on you. It is a good one and I liked it then and I still like it now. It has stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster's performance was brilliant and very focused. I also liked David Amram's score. It fit the concrete landscape beautify as did Lionel Lindon's stark black & white cinematography.,5,A Concrete Landscape,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,570,"['YOUNG', 'SAVAGES', 'visually', 'very', 'stark', 'film', 'love', 'film', 'resolute', 'perseverance', 'truth', 'enigmatic', 'point', 'view', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'films', 'have', 'effect', 'good', 'one', 'liked', 'then', 'still', 'now', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'performance', 'was', 'brilliant', 'very', 'focused', 'also', 'liked', 'David', 'Amram', 'score', 'fit', 'concrete', 'landscape', 'beautify', 'did', 'Lionel', 'Lindon', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography']",The Young Savages VHS
425848,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,630449436X,Randy Keehn,"[8, 8]","I watched a lot of movies on TV when I was growing up.  Much of them were mediocre at best (I'm thinking of the Friday and Saturday night monster movies and the Saturday afternoon Roy Rogers Westerns).  Some of the movies I saw were great movies then and remain so today.  However, a few left an indelible impression on me yet seemed to disappear from public view as I grew older.  One such movie was ""The Young Savages"".  I was seared by the image of Puerto Rican gangs in New York where teenagers would kill with switchblades and beat people with log chains.  It was strange stuff for an adolescent growing up in Des Moines.  I was impressed with Burt Lancaster who was ""one of them"" but ready, as an Assistant District Attorney, to send these young murderers to the gas chamber.  I was fascinated as I watched his efforts to punish evolve into an effort to understand.  I remember wondering if other prosecutors ever handled a trial the way he did (I don't think so).  I would remember scenes from ""The Young Savages"" over the years and I was glad to finally have a chance to see it again the other night on TCM.The second time around was as good or better because I didn't appreciate the moral story in the movie as much as I thought I had.  The same scenes of senseless violence challenged me again (although, between then and now, I had been to New York City a number of times...and survived!).  However, I had missed the tension between DA Lancaster and his proper wife who opposed capital punishment.  It was interesting to see Lancaster fight his own beliefs and put them to the test.  His efforts to get to understand the juvenile delinquents was impressive.  Each time he felt he'd had enough of their pointless violent nature, he relent and search even deeper to understand what made them click.  The further he'd push it, the harder he'd get hurt (in a variety of ways).  The trial still comes across as something out of a Broadway play rather than a district courthouse but, by that point in the movie, Lancaster had earned the right to solve things his way.  The result of the trial had touched me as a kid and seeing it again reaffirmed my first impressions.The acting in ""The Young Savages"" was generally good to (in the case of Burt Lancaster) very good. I'll add a kudo for Telly Savalas in a supporting role.  Edward Andrews was a bit much as the ambition District Attorney who had his sights on the Governors mansion.  However, I can think of a number of current politicians who come across worse than he did.  I never really bought into Dina Merril's role (although her scene in the elevator was fairly well done).  I didn't realize that John Frankenheimer went back that far as a director but he, and the writer did very well.  I'm sorry that this movie is so seldom shown these days.  It's what we would call a ""sleeper"".  I'll watch it again the next time I can.  I just hope it isn't another 40-some years before I get the chance again.",4,A  Forgotten Morality Play,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2962,"['watched', 'lot', 'movies', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Much', 'were', 'mediocre', 'best', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'monster', 'movies', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'Westerns', 'movies', 'saw', 'were', 'great', 'movies', 'then', 'remain', 'so', 'today', 'However', 'few', 'left', 'indelible', 'impression', 'yet', 'seemed', 'disappear', 'public', 'view', 'grew', 'older', 'One', 'such', 'movie', 'was', 'Young', 'Savages', 'was', 'seared', 'image', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'gangs', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'teenagers', 'would', 'kill', 'switchblades', 'beat', 'people', 'log', 'chains', 'was', 'strange', 'stuff', 'adolescent', 'growing', 'up', 'Des', 'Moines', 'was', 'impressed', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'ready', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attorney', 'send', 'young', 'murderers', 'gas', 'chamber', 'was', 'fascinated', 'watched', 'efforts', 'punish', 'evolve', 'effort', 'understand', 'remember', 'wondering', 'other', 'prosecutors', 'ever', 'handled', 'trial', 'way', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'would', 'remember', 'scenes', 'Young', 'Savages', 'years', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'other', 'night', 'TCM.The', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'good', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'moral', 'story', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'had', 'same', 'scenes', 'senseless', 'violence', 'challenged', 'again', 'then', 'now', 'had', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'number', 'times', 'survived', 'However', 'had', 'missed', 'tension', 'DA', 'Lancaster', 'proper', 'wife', 'who', 'opposed', 'capital', 'punishment', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Lancaster', 'fight', 'own', 'beliefs', 'put', 'test', 'efforts', 'get', 'understand', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'was', 'impressive', 'time', 'felt', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'pointless', 'violent', 'nature', 'relent', 'search', 'even', 'deeper', 'understand', 'what', 'made', 'click', 'further', ""'d"", 'push', 'harder', ""'d"", 'get', 'hurt', 'variety', 'ways', 'trial', 'still', 'something', 'Broadway', 'play', 'rather', 'district', 'courthouse', 'point', 'movie', 'Lancaster', 'had', 'earned', 'right', 'solve', 'things', 'way', 'result', 'trial', 'had', 'touched', 'kid', 'seeing', 'again', 'reaffirmed', 'first', 'impressions.The', 'acting', 'Young', 'Savages', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'case', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'add', 'kudo', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'supporting', 'role', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'ambition', 'District', 'Attorney', 'who', 'had', 'sights', 'Governors', 'mansion', 'However', 'can', 'think', 'number', 'current', 'politicians', 'who', 'come', 'worse', 'did', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'Dina', 'Merril', 'role', 'scene', 'elevator', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'went', 'back', 'far', 'director', 'writer', 'did', 'very', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'movie', 'so', 'seldom', 'shown', 'days', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'sleeper', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'next', 'time', 'can', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", '40-some', 'years', 'get', 'chance', 'again']",The Young Savages VHS

It's the writers opinions of the quality of the film and certain aspects of it.  This film is one of the stand out films of the late fifties and early sixties that dealt with social commentary of the times.  Burt Lancaster who is usually considered a very good B actor, but gives a stellar A+ performance.  It is a very well done gritty crime drama of gang violence in New York City of the time.  This film has a really good story and plot, and a good twist at the end.  It ranks right up there with films of the period such as; 12 Angry Men, Inherit the Wind and many others.
