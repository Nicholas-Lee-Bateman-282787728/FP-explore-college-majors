1098852,A2LNR55TM67AU4,B000V5IP6U,&#34;Gimpy&#34; Peach Johnson,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed these films in the 1980s and 1990s when they were released, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how well they have held up. The animation is superb, the storytelling quite good, James Horner's music is incredible, and most importantly, the characters are well-developed and emotionally engaging. ""An American Tail"" and ""The Land Before Time"" are rightly becoming classics in the realm of animation. (The jury's still out on ""Balto."") Buying all three in a budget-priced DVD set for less than three bucks per movie seemed like a good buy.Why only two stars? The transfers appear somewhat ""hazy."" Perhaps I've become accustomed to Disney's squeaky-clean, bright, crisp restorations of many of their classic animated films. On DVD and Blu-ray, Disney films going back to ""Snow White"" and ""Bambi"" have all the visual clarity of a film made last year, with consistent color and well-defined lines. By comparison, these DVDs look like they are the same transfers prepared for VHS release of these films twenty and (gulp!) thirty years ago. The color isn't quite as even. What's worse, these are all FULL-FRAME, with the films cropped and modified to fit the screens of older televisions. With widescreen TVs ubiquitous these days, it's a shame these films still aren't available in their original theatrical release aspect ratio. The extras are practically nil -- most seem to be nothing but short clips from the movies with annoying voiceovers.Obviously, most children watching these won't be nearly so critical. If you're buying it for little ones, this set is a bargain and will fit the bill nicely. For older collectors and movie buffs, however, it's a disappointment. Hopefully in the near future Universal will see fit to release these in their original format on Blu-ray with proper transfers. They're marvelous films deserving of better treatment. In the meantime, this set is cheap, but you get what you pay for.",2,"Classic animated films - hazy, full-frame transfers",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1927,"['enjoyed', 'films', '1980s', '1990s', 'when', 'were', 'released', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'animation', 'superb', 'storytelling', 'quite', 'good', 'James', 'Horner', 'music', 'incredible', 'most', 'importantly', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'American', 'Tail', 'Land', 'Time', 'are', 'rightly', 'becoming', 'classics', 'realm', 'animation', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'Balto', 'Buying', 'three', 'budget-priced', 'DVD', 'set', 'less', 'three', 'bucks', 'movie', 'seemed', 'good', 'buy.Why', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'transfers', 'appear', 'somewhat', 'hazy', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'Disney', 'squeaky-clean', 'bright', 'crisp', 'restorations', 'many', 'classic', 'animated', 'films', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'Disney', 'going', 'back', 'Snow', 'White', 'Bambi', 'have', 'visual', 'clarity', 'film', 'made', 'last', 'year', 'consistent', 'color', 'well-defined', 'lines', 'comparison', 'DVDs', 'look', 'are', 'same', 'transfers', 'prepared', 'VHS', 'release', 'films', 'twenty', 'gulp', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'color', ""n't"", 'quite', 'even', 'What', 'worse', 'are', 'FULL-FRAME', 'films', 'cropped', 'modified', 'fit', 'screens', 'older', 'televisions', 'widescreen', 'TVs', 'ubiquitous', 'days', 'shame', 'films', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'available', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'extras', 'are', 'practically', 'nil', 'most', 'seem', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'clips', 'movies', 'annoying', 'voiceovers.Obviously', 'most', 'children', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'so', 'critical', ""'re"", 'buying', 'little', 'ones', 'set', 'bargain', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'nicely', 'older', 'collectors', 'movie', 'buffs', 'however', 'disappointment', 'Hopefully', 'near', 'future', 'Universal', 'will', 'see', 'fit', 'release', 'original', 'format', 'Blu-ray', 'proper', 'transfers', ""'re"", 'marvelous', 'films', 'deserving', 'better', 'treatment', 'meantime', 'set', 'cheap', 'get', 'what', 'pay']",N/A

The audience is instantly drawn in to the lovable character of Fievel who gets separated from his family and must find them once again in America. The parallel between Nazi's, cats, Jews and mice may not be grasped on the younger audience, but as an adult I appreciated it.The animation in all three holds it's ground, which is nice, as some animation movies have suffered if they weren't released by Disney. These didn't. Don Bluth is superb.I had never seen ""Balto"" (unthinkable as it may be) and I was very much pleased by what it captured. The outsider in all of us can absolutely identify with Balto, the main character, which is half-dog and half-wolf, never truly belonging anywhere. Although I predicted the ending, underdog pulls through, I found the movie engaging none the less. I was enthralled with the story and Kevin Bacon does a splendid job in capturing the essence of Balto.Lastly, ""The Land Before Time"", seen for the last time ages ago and so I remember only the main plot line and not the small details. It is the small details which make this movie truly magical. I loved finding Little Foot once again and I was surprised at how touching the movie turned out to be.
