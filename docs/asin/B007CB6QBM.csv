She's out celebrating one night and hits a guy with her shoe, all he can remember of her is that she had her hair done up in a bun like a ""poop.""Come to find out her new boss, Cha Ji Heon (Ji Sung), is this guy, who wants her to try and find the ""poop head."" He also doesn't actually want to do work.  He is much happier just being a big kid.As the story moves along his ambitious cousin, Cha Moo Won (Kim Jae Joong),is intrigued by Eun Seol and makes his moves both on her and towards taking Ji Heon's position.What really makes this drama fun are the characters.  Eun Seol is still that tough street thug. She lives with her best friend, who idolizes wrestling (who is hilarious).  Ji Heon's dad loves his son but has been unable to make him do anything-- he is a bit of a mobster though, and does whatever he can to get out of sticky situations--like pretending to be in a wheel chair.The one character who absolutely stole the screen was the second female lead, Seo Na Yoon (Wang Ji Hye). She starts off as the typical snotty princess, much like she played inPersonal Taste. Na Yoon, it turns out, really was just in need of some girl friends. She ends up foisting herself on Eun Seol and her roommate--all the time. She's pretty hilarious.Eun Seol and Ji Heon are able to learn from one another--what's great is that the character growth is not just limited to them, so the whole drama leads its viewer to feeling very good in the end.",4,Funny and Fun to Watch,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1675,"['nothing', 'too', 'box', 'kdrama', 'really', 'enjoyable.No', 'Eun', 'Seol', 'Choi', 'Kang', 'Hee', 'finally', 'managed', 'land', 'job', 'office', 'assistant', 'years', 'training', 'trying', 'out', 'grow', 'street', 'thug', 'past', 'out', 'celebrating', 'one', 'night', 'guy', 'shoe', 'can', 'remember', 'had', 'hair', 'done', 'up', 'bun', 'poop', 'Come', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'boss', 'Cha', 'Ji', 'Heon', 'Ji', 'Sung', 'guy', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'poop', 'head', 'also', ""n't"", 'actually', 'want', 'do', 'work', 'much', 'happier', 'just', 'being', 'big', 'kid.As', 'story', 'moves', 'ambitious', 'cousin', 'Cha', 'Moo', 'Won', 'Kim', 'Jae', 'Joong', 'intrigued', 'Eun', 'Seol', 'moves', 'towards', 'taking', 'Ji', 'Heon', 'position.What', 'really', 'drama', 'fun', 'are', 'characters', 'Eun', 'Seol', 'still', 'tough', 'street', 'thug', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'wrestling', 'who', 'hilarious', 'Ji', 'Heon', 'dad', 'son', 'been', 'unable', 'make', 'do', 'anything', 'bit', 'mobster', 'whatever', 'can', 'get', 'sticky', 'situations', 'pretending', 'be', 'wheel', 'chair.The', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'screen', 'was', 'second', 'female', 'lead', 'Seo', 'Na', 'Yoon', 'Wang', 'Ji', 'Hye', 'off', 'typical', 'snotty', 'princess', 'much', 'played', 'inPersonal', 'Taste', 'Na', 'Yoon', 'out', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'need', 'girl', 'friends', 'up', 'foisting', 'Eun', 'Seol', 'roommate', 'time', 'pretty', 'hilarious.Eun', 'Seol', 'Ji', 'Heon', 'are', 'able', 'learn', 'one', 'what', 'great', 'character', 'growth', 'not', 'just', 'limited', 'whole', 'drama', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'very', 'good', 'end']","Protect the Boss - Korean Drama (5dvd, 18 Episodes) All Region with English Subtitles"
