760589,A2AV7Q95QGPTO0,B0000A02WW,Diego Banducci,"[11, 11]","Country music seemed to lose its way in the late sixties when country performers increasingly began to imitate rock musicians. Beginning about ten years ago, there was a new initiative to bring it back to its authentic roots, led by Emmy Lou Harris and given real momentum by the release of the movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Even George Clooney was upstaged by the real star of the film -- the music.We enjoyed the film so much that we bought the companion DVD,Down from the Mountain (The ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Concert)which recorded a Nashville concert by the musicians from ""O Brother."" If you don't already have that DVD, buy it.Anyway, Alison Krauss and Union Station figured strongly in all of this (group member Dan Tyminski sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and the group itself was the Soggy Bottom Boys). Because ""Down From the Mountain"" featured interviews with all of the musicians involved, we became aware of what serious musicians the members of Union Station are.This concert, which takes place in a beautiful venue (the Louisville Palace -- what all auditoriums aspire to be when they grow up), simply takes up from where ""Down From the Mountain"" left off. Almost all of the music is fast and upbeat, with lots of pickin' and individual performances by members of the group. My personal favorite is Jerry Douglas who plays the dobro, a horizontal guitar that produces the sweetest sound I've heard. I now realize that it lay at the core of some of the best music in ""O Brother.""Alison herself comes across as being shy and slightly embarrassed at being the center of attention, a true Natural.Sit back and enjoy.",5,A Solid Pleasure,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1636,"['Country', 'music', 'seemed', 'lose', 'way', 'late', 'sixties', 'when', 'country', 'performers', 'increasingly', 'began', 'imitate', 'rock', 'musicians', 'Beginning', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'new', 'initiative', 'bring', 'back', 'authentic', 'roots', 'led', 'Emmy', 'Lou', 'Harris', 'given', 'real', 'momentum', 'release', 'movie', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Even', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'upstaged', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'music.We', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'companion', 'DVD', 'Down', 'Mountain', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Concert', 'recorded', 'Nashville', 'concert', 'musicians', 'O', 'Brother', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'buy', 'it.Anyway', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'Union', 'Station', 'figured', 'strongly', 'group', 'member', 'Dan', 'Tyminski', 'sang', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'group', 'was', 'Soggy', 'Bottom', 'Boys', 'Down', 'From', 'Mountain', 'featured', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'involved', 'became', 'aware', 'what', 'serious', 'members', 'Union', 'Station', 'are.This', 'concert', 'place', 'beautiful', 'venue', 'Louisville', 'Palace', 'what', 'auditoriums', 'aspire', 'be', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'simply', 'up', 'where', 'Mountain', 'left', 'off', 'Almost', 'music', 'fast', 'upbeat', 'lots', 'pickin', 'individual', 'performances', 'members', 'group', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Jerry', 'Douglas', 'who', 'dobro', 'horizontal', 'guitar', 'sweetest', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'now', 'realize', 'lay', 'core', 'best', 'music', 'O', 'Brother', 'Alison', 'across', 'being', 'shy', 'slightly', 'embarrassed', 'being', 'center', 'attention', 'true', 'Natural.Sit', 'back', 'enjoy']",N/A

The first disc of this two-DVD set is a full concert that reveals the extraordinary musicianship of Union Station (especially Jerry Douglas on dobro).  Krauss' voice is stronger and more emotive live than on her studio recordings.  Also, the concert showcases her offbeat, dry wit (a trait seemingly shared by all the members of the band).  Unfortunately, the last two numbers on the CD are dropped, but can be heard elsewhere on the disc.

760596,AI4H1QU8H214H,B0000A02WW,"J. Bellin ""analog_j""","[0, 0]","I don't know whether to start with my personal feelings about Alison Krauss or simply do the review - I guess I'll start with the former.First of all, there is something so beautiful about her face, beautiful eyes and bone structure.  But regarding her outfit for the stage, while I know she wants to be just one of the band, the skirt she wears does nothing for her.  You can see in the video for the single that came out at the time, ""New Favorite"", she is physically attractive, but she is essentially the front for the band. Minor criticism.As a fan of music in general but not huge on bluegrass (I love it when I hear it live, but not something I'd generally buy for at home listening), I love that Alison has branched out and crossed over.  I had seen her a couple of times in my life before this, though not anywhere when I bought tickets specifically to see her.  I saw her about 1993 at a Grand Ole Opry radio show in Nashville.  She was just one of the acts, and I had known about her, living up in the Boston area as I do.  She frequently performed around here, probably because her label was the Cambridge based Rounder Records. I also saw her at a big, multi-starring act show several years ago at Sanders Theater in Cambridge honoring Club Passim, an off-shoot of Club 47. At that show, in addition to Alison Krauss and Union Station, there was Dar Williams, Richard Thompson and many others.Anyway, I had read many good things about the show on this particular DVD and it did not disappoint.  The variety of music was great, and the musicianship extraordinary!  The camaraderie with the other members of the group was greatly evident, and the generous humor shared between them and the audience was infectious.Sonically, this show was extremely well-recorded.  It's about as good a sound as you're going to get for a recorded live show.  One extremely minor quibble is that you can hear the sound engineer a bit clumsily pulling back on the audience volume after each song as they are applauding.  The sonic point of view is close-up to the band, while the engineer clearly keeps the ambiance of the hall in the mix as well.  But again, you can hear that ambiance quickly pulled back after each song.  Nonetheless, the sound of the vocals and instruments are rich and full-bodied.As some have mentioned, it's the stereo PCM track that is the one to use.  PCM tracks are ALWAYS the one to go for if you want the highest fidelity.  Those are usually uncompressed (which take up for of the DVD's space), whereas you'll often get Dolby or some other limiter in the track for multi-track surround. Furthermore, most of the companies that manufacture the best amplification concentrate on 2-channel reproduction.  It's not a surprise that the best sound on the this DVD is found in the PCM track.The second disc has the video for the then single, ""New Favorite"", and it also has interviews with each of the musicians, including photos of them as children and growing up, and conversations about how they got started playing music to begin with.I understand the disappointment some have that by this time, Krauss had abandoned being solely a bluegrass band, but for a great evening of music, this DVD is hard to beat.",5,Extraordinary Evening Of Music,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,3225,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'start', 'personal', 'feelings', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'simply', 'do', 'review', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'start', 'former.First', 'something', 'so', 'beautiful', 'face', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'bone', 'structure', 'regarding', 'outfit', 'stage', 'know', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'band', 'skirt', 'nothing', 'can', 'see', 'video', 'single', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'New', 'Favorite', 'physically', 'attractive', 'essentially', 'front', 'band', 'Minor', 'criticism.As', 'fan', 'music', 'general', 'not', 'huge', 'bluegrass', 'love', 'when', 'hear', 'live', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'generally', 'buy', 'home', 'listening', 'love', 'Alison', 'branched', 'out', 'crossed', 'had', 'seen', 'couple', 'times', 'life', 'not', 'anywhere', 'when', 'bought', 'tickets', 'specifically', 'see', 'saw', '1993', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Opry', 'radio', 'show', 'Nashville', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'acts', 'had', 'known', 'living', 'up', 'Boston', 'area', 'do', 'frequently', 'performed', 'here', 'probably', 'label', 'was', 'Cambridge', 'based', 'Rounder', 'Records', 'also', 'saw', 'big', 'multi-starring', 'act', 'show', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Sanders', 'Theater', 'Cambridge', 'honoring', 'Club', 'Passim', 'off-shoot', 'Club', '47', 'show', 'addition', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'Union', 'Station', 'was', 'Dar', 'Williams', 'Richard', 'Thompson', 'many', 'others.Anyway', 'had', 'read', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'particular', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'variety', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'musicianship', 'extraordinary', 'camaraderie', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'was', 'greatly', 'evident', 'generous', 'humor', 'shared', 'audience', 'was', 'infectious.Sonically', 'show', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-recorded', 'as', 'good', 'sound', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'recorded', 'live', 'show', 'One', 'extremely', 'minor', 'quibble', 'can', 'hear', 'sound', 'bit', 'clumsily', 'pulling', 'back', 'audience', 'volume', 'song', 'are', 'applauding', 'sonic', 'point', 'view', 'close-up', 'band', 'engineer', 'clearly', 'ambiance', 'hall', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'can', 'hear', 'ambiance', 'quickly', 'pulled', 'back', 'song', 'Nonetheless', 'sound', 'vocals', 'instruments', 'are', 'rich', 'full-bodied.As', 'have', 'mentioned', 'stereo', 'PCM', 'track', 'one', 'use', 'PCM', 'tracks', 'are', 'ALWAYS', 'one', 'go', 'want', 'highest', 'fidelity', 'are', 'usually', 'uncompressed', 'take', 'up', 'DVD', 'space', ""'ll"", 'often', 'get', 'Dolby', 'other', 'limiter', 'track', 'multi-track', 'surround', 'Furthermore', 'most', 'companies', 'manufacture', 'best', 'amplification', 'concentrate', '2-channel', 'reproduction', 'not', 'surprise', 'best', 'sound', 'DVD', 'found', 'PCM', 'track.The', 'second', 'disc', 'video', 'then', 'single', 'New', 'Favorite', 'also', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'including', 'photos', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'conversations', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'playing', 'music', 'begin', 'with.I', 'disappointment', 'have', 'that', 'time', 'Krauss', 'had', 'abandoned', 'being', 'solely', 'bluegrass', 'band', 'great', 'evening', 'music', 'DVD', 'hard', 'beat']",N/A
760597,A1YTCTY24AOKMF,B0000A02WW,Josh Andrews,"[57, 58]","Along with my father, we went to see Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station perform live in El Paso, TX in early December of last year, and we were just blown away by the amazing talent of these musicians. Alison Krauss' voice sounded more beautiful and was more astonishing than any studio song I've ever heard recorded by her. Members of Union Station, Barry Bales, Jerry Douglas, Ron Block, and Dan Tyminski blew up away with their instrument playing. It's hard to believe that both my first concert, and pretty much my Dad's first concert, would pretty much turn out to be overall perfect. Alison Krauss sang beautifully and Union Station performed exceptionally.When I was thinking of a gift to buy my father for Christmas, I remembered how much he was blown away by the concert. So, I ordered the DVD version of their live concert from April 29 and 30, 2002 at The Louisville Palace in Louisville, KY. My father was so happy when he got the DVD, and he loved watching all of the artists performs. He said it was haunting to see them on screen, considering we had just seen them in concert, and he said it was just like being there all over again -- hearing them live, being blown away by their amazing talents.Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station have to be some of the best artists to have come along ever since music was first being recorded. They're talents are breath-taking and you won't have a single flaw to point out about them.I think the more special 'treats' on this 2 DVD set are the intense, instrument-only performances &quot;Choctaw Hayride&quot; and &quot;Cluck Old Hen&quot;. It's amazing watching how fast and accurate these musicians play their instruments. Not only does Alison Krauss sing, but she also plays the fiddle. If Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station ever stop if your town for a concert, here's some smart advice. GO SEE THEM. You'll get a whole lot more than your money's worth.The special features of this DVD aren't bad at all. The first disc of this 2 DVD set is of the concert, and the second is of the special features. The second disc contains a tribute to Peador O'Donnell (someone who worked closely with the group), a haunting music video for &quot;New Favorite&quot; from the album NEW FAVORITE, and other features including biographies of/interviews with Alison Krauss, Union Station, and drummer Larry Atamanuik.The Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station LIVE 2-disc CD set will make a great gift for anyone who loves pure, quality music.",5,An Incredible Experience,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,2473,"['father', 'went', 'see', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'amp', 'Union', 'Station', 'perform', 'live', 'El', 'Paso', 'TX', 'early', 'December', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'just', 'blown', 'away', 'amazing', 'talent', 'musicians', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'voice', 'sounded', 'more', 'beautiful', 'was', 'more', 'astonishing', 'studio', 'song', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'recorded', 'Members', 'Union', 'Station', 'Barry', 'Bales', 'Jerry', 'Douglas', 'Ron', 'Block', 'Dan', 'Tyminski', 'blew', 'up', 'away', 'instrument', 'playing', 'hard', 'believe', 'first', 'concert', 'pretty', 'much', 'Dad', 'first', 'concert', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'overall', 'perfect', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'sang', 'beautifully', 'Union', 'Station', 'performed', 'exceptionally.When', 'was', 'thinking', 'gift', 'buy', 'father', 'Christmas', 'remembered', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'concert', 'So', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'version', 'live', 'concert', 'April', '29', '30', '2002', 'Louisville', 'Palace', 'Louisville', 'KY.', 'My', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'got', 'DVD', 'loved', 'watching', 'artists', 'performs', 'said', 'was', 'haunting', 'see', 'screen', 'considering', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'concert', 'said', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'over', 'again', 'hearing', 'live', 'being', 'blown', 'away', 'amazing', 'talents.Alison', 'Krauss', 'amp', 'Union', 'Station', 'have', 'be', 'best', 'artists', 'have', 'come', 'ever', 'music', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'recorded', ""'re"", 'talents', 'are', 'breath-taking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'flaw', 'point', 'out', 'them.I', 'think', 'more', 'special', ""'treats"", '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'intense', 'instrument-only', 'performances', 'quot', 'Choctaw', 'Hayride', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cluck', 'Old', 'Hen', 'quot', 'amazing', 'watching', 'how', 'fast', 'accurate', 'musicians', 'play', 'instruments', 'Not', 'only', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'sing', 'also', 'fiddle', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'amp', 'Union', 'Station', 'ever', 'stop', 'town', 'concert', 'here', 'smart', 'advice', 'GO', 'SEE', 'THEM', ""'ll"", 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'worth.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', 'disc', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'concert', 'second', 'special', 'features', 'second', 'disc', 'tribute', 'Peador', ""O'Donnell"", 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'closely', 'group', 'haunting', 'music', 'video', 'quot', 'New', 'Favorite', 'quot', 'album', 'NEW', 'FAVORITE', 'other', 'features', 'including', 'biographies', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'Union', 'Station', 'drummer', 'Larry', 'Atamanuik.The', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'amp', 'Union', 'Station', 'LIVE', '2-disc', 'CD', 'set', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'gift', 'anyone', 'who', 'pure', 'quality', 'music']",N/A

That's exactly how a ""concert on DVD"" should be!.I'll talk later about the contents, but first the technical details: Outstanding high definition image (16:9 -yes!-) enhanced by the theatre and scenario settings and lights. Impeccable sound (DD, DTS or PCM), you can distinctly hear every single instrument and voices, as well as the spectators ""noise"" without being bothering at all.  No stupid region coding (hey, that's important for some of us!), and best of all, it's a true concert, from the beginning to the end (or it seems so), without interruptions with interviews or captions of the musician's family life: you also have this but in a separate disk, as it should always be. This way you can seat and relax with the twenty three songs, just as if you were at the show. It's even better because the close-up takes are excellent (not a solo is missed), and these are worth seeing it !.The accompanying disc contains the usual interviews with band members about their background and contribution, and even about their instruments, which is great (pity they forgot to ask Ron Block about his guitar, does anybody knows what is it?) as well as some nice footage of the band while travelling and rehearsing.Can it be any better ?, well, hardly, but for us, non-English speakers, English subtitles would be most welcome.Now, about the artistic merits of this edition, I'll assume that if you're considering buying it is because you like AKUS, in which case it won't deceive you. The performance is exceptional. Every member of this band is a top musician, they deserved to be heared separately and when they play together something clicks for the best (in this sense it's the same as with Crosby Stills and Nash, my favorite band of all times). Alison's voice is flawless, she don't miss a note or try to avoid it, and she's great when presenting each member (great surprise to see Larry Atamanuik, an ex-Emmylou Harris' Nash Ramblers at the drums) Ron Block, Dan Tyminski, Barry Bales, they're all great, ...and Jerry Douglas is a genius.To the people at Rounder (the editors of this DVD): Great Job!!!

The sound quality, the songs, the group are all superb.Alison Krauss has a beautiful melodic voice and she can belt them out with the best.  The group Union Station are some of the best musicans in the world.  And wnen they come together it is magic.  Each is a skilled and gifted musican in their own right.I love the song The Lucky One, and When you say nothing at all.  It is difficult to choose a favorite but those two rank near the top on my list.I'm a late comer to knowing this group.  I've heard of Union Station before, but never really knew much about them.  And I only recently discovered Alison Krauss and what a talent she is on her own having won more grammy awards than any other female artist.  And 3rd most in history.She is very versatile and can sing any song and make it sound good.  She sang two of the nominated songs for the 2006 Acadamy Awards.  She is also quite funny and down to earth having grown up in North Central Illinois.I have copied this DVD onto my computer and love to listen to the songs while working and enjoy watching the group play.

Usually the filming stinks, two much CONSTANT switching camera angles to actually ENJOY the concert and feel like you are actually THERE!  Well I'm going to tell you something.  Alison Krauss & union station were in concert in our area recently and we had a huge downpour/lighting/thunderstorm that totally cut this concert short.  We were so ticked (not their fault of course, but DAMN!), & and it was SUCH a huge disappointment.  I'm here to tell you that this concert DVD more than makes up for it because even though we were 15 rows back, which is fairly close, this DVD puts right in front of their face and keeps the camera's STEADY, only adding scene/camera angles changes were appropriate.  You actually get to ENJOY the BAND on the FRONT ROW and I mean these guys are the most incredible musicians I have EVER witnessed in my life.  WOW! 12 Stars if I could give them that many for this DVD set.  EXCELLENT.  Have I made my point clear enough?  This dvd will blow you away if you are into bluegrass, bluegrass/country crossover, or just simply stunning performing artists.  I also love how Alison talks so much during the concert.  She is completely adorable, very witty & a pleasure to listen to & watch.  Can't say enough good about this.  You won't be disappointed with it.  (Directors & cameramen should be using this as a tool to study in order to make concert DVD's that are worth a crap.)  I have very diversified tastes & I love the Cranberries, bought a live performance dvd of theirs and I'm telling you, however directed the cameramen on that had to be high on speed.

The live performance at the Louisville Palace in Kentucky is the finest that I have ever seen, the venue brought out something special in each of these fine artists.
