This doesn't seem to hurt the story as much as it would generally and this is mainly because the story is in the skillful hands of Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.Beautifully filmed from the human perspective, Hallstr&ouml;m also films part of the film from the dog's perspective, making sure that the scenes are in black and whites hues and are shot from the level the dog would see them from. The film works as a homage to the loyalty and friendship and the testament of the bond shared between the professor (played by Richard Gere) and the dog who finds him (played by a series of Akitas). Joan Allen is also quite convincing as a wife who refuses to take in a dog (in fact, Hachi spends his time ""being part of the family"" by living in a shed outside) and, later, as a grieving wife who stumbles upon the dog who still patiently waits for his master to return for nine years.The movie is done with authentic admiration and faithful devotion - the story never veers into the melodramatic; instead it receives a heartfelt and touching treatment. This means that, in the way of all good dog movies, you will laugh AND you will cry, making Hachi: A Dog's Tale a worthwhile retelling of Hachiko's story.",5,"if you ever loved a dog, you will love this film",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,1310,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'loyal', 'faithful', 'Japanese', 'dog', 'film', 'version', '1930s', 'events', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hurt', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'generally', 'mainly', 'story', 'skillful', 'hands', 'Lasse', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'm.Beautifully', 'filmed', 'human', 'perspective', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'also', 'films', 'part', 'film', 'dog', 'perspective', 'making', 'sure', 'scenes', 'are', 'black', 'whites', 'hues', 'are', 'shot', 'level', 'dog', 'would', 'see', 'film', 'homage', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'testament', 'bond', 'shared', 'professor', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'dog', 'who', 'played', 'series', 'Akitas', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'also', 'quite', 'convincing', 'wife', 'who', 'take', 'dog', 'fact', 'Hachi', 'time', 'being', 'part', 'family', 'living', 'shed', 'outside', 'later', 'grieving', 'wife', 'who', 'dog', 'who', 'still', 'patiently', 'master', 'return', 'nine', 'years.The', 'movie', 'done', 'authentic', 'admiration', 'faithful', 'devotion', 'story', 'never', 'veers', 'melodramatic', 'instead', 'heartfelt', 'touching', 'treatment', 'way', 'good', 'dog', 'movies', 'will', 'laugh', 'AND', 'will', 'cry', 'making', 'Hachi', 'Dog', 'Tale', 'worthwhile', 'retelling', 'Hachiko', 'story']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well.  It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course.  I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the ""toy"" breeds, although they can be cute).  It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness.  Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog.  Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi.  And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station(everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him.  Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie.The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will.  Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and ""cheap sentiment.""  (Funsuckers).  If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized.  That's okay.  The story still hits home.  And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors!  The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's persepective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on.  I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work ""The Cider House Rules,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" etc).  This is no exception.

1317387,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B0031RAOVY,buru buru piggu,"[2, 3]","Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a modernized and Americanized remake of Hachiko Monogatari (""Hachiko's Story""), a 1987 hit film from Japan based on the inspirational story of real life dog, Hachiko. Hachiko is immortalized in the hearts of millions of people around the world for his devotion to his master in addition to being immortalized in actual physical form: a bronze statue of him stands in front of Shinjuku Station in Tokyo where he used to wait, and at the National Science Museum in Ueno, he has been stuffed and mounted for display.Hachi is Richard Gere's second Japanese remake, afterShall We Dance? (Widescreen Edition). It's refreshing to see this version remain largely faithful to the source material instead of being completely butchered like so many remakes. Some detail changes were made to make it more accessible to American audiences, but the overall story structure, plot progression, and spirit are the same (mostly). A word of warning before you watch this: it tugs at heart strings and can leave you a sobbing, emotional mess. If you're the sort to cry at these kinds of movies, you'll be doing a lot of it here, especially towards the end.In the original, the story takes place in pre-WWII Japan, starting with the birth of a litter of pups in Odate, Akita one wintry night. One of them is then sent to Dr. Hidesaburo Ueno (given as Eisaburo in the epilogue of this film, an alternate and possibly wrong pronunciation), a professor of agricultural science at Tokyo Imperial University to replace his dog Gonsuke, who had died the previous year. His daughter accepts the pup, against the initial reluctance of Ueno and his wife. In Hachi (2009), the story begins in Japan with a pup being shipped to America from a Buddhist temple. He falls off the back of a luggage cart and is found by Parker Wilson (Gere), a professor of music and dance at a nearby college in the fictional town of Bedridge, Rhode Island.In both stories, the wife does not wish to keep the dog, but here, Cate (Joan Allen) is an architect instead of a housewife. (In the original story, the couple also had 2 servants.) From here, the two stories are mostly the same. We see Hachi and Parker bond quickly, and several of the key scenes from the original are faithfully preserved (again in spirit, if not exact details), like the bathing scene, the stormy night, and the massage. Erick Avari is a hotdog vendor instead of a yakitori seller. We see a bit of cultural exposition from Parker's friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a Japanese profesor whose Zen-like wisdom aids in helping Parker understand Hachi's name, a bit about Akita dogs, their significance in history, and Hachi's role in Parker's life. This also helps audiences appreciate a bit of Japanese culture.Things I really didn't like: The story is wrapped by Parker's grandson's retelling during show-and-tell class, called ""My Hero"". It begins with him and ends with him. The film didn't need this extra layer of removal from the intimacy of the original. Secondly, some really jarring scenes use ""dog's eye view"" where the entire scene is shown from Hachi's perspective in shaky black and white (dogs are totally color-blind?). This was totally unnecessary and distracting. Lastly, the changing of the seasons wasn't handled with nearly as much subtlety and finesse as the original did. We see a low angle three-quarters shot of Hachi with a tree behind him losing its leaves, blowing away, then growing back again, then losing its leaves, then growing back again three times, to signify the passing of the years. This was a really blunt, hit you over the head way of showing the passage of time.Overall, some intimacy is lost when translating this story to an American suburb and car culture. The spread of a small American town feels very different than the densely-packed Tokyo environs and walking culture of the original though the core message of love and loyalty still shines through. Despite these differences, this movie is still very good and worth seeing. It's suitable for the entire family and Gere and Allen both turn in fine performances. I particularly liked the understated piano music that serves as the soundtrack for many of the scenes. A very enjoyable film, but beware the tear-jerker factor.

1317390,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B0031RAOVY,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","I will be very honest.  Having seen this movie a few days ago, it's still very much on my mind, and probably won't leave for a while to come.  There are strong parallels to this story and the old Disney film, Greyfriar's Bobby, but the fact is that while the latter had something of a much happier ending, this one just had me in tears about three times.  My boyfriend was laughing because I couldn't turn off the water works.Richard Gere was the idyllic dog owner whose wife didn't essentially want Hachi after he brought the puppy home, and it was easy to see what made man and dog bond.  It reminded me a lot of the relationship between our favorite of three labs and my brother, both no longer with us by only a matter of months apart (Bucky went first because he was very old and sick).What this movie represents is the undying love and loyalty a dog has for its master--a lot better than most people have for each other--and that's saying something right there.  There is a lot of harsh criticism here about how the dog was just left loose to hang around near the train station and had nobody taking him in.  The daughter and her husband tried, but Hachi would not stay put, and I don't think he would have stayed put if anyone else had tried either.  He was too devoted to the memory and reunion with his master which (I hope this isn't considered a spoiler) he inevitably got.  As one of the characters said to the dog, ""You have to do what you have to do.""  Nobody bothered him, and people didn't exactly neglect him.  He was never discouraged from his mission, and it wouldn't have been right to deny him his choice.The problem with this story is that it shows a dog who spends the rest of his life sadly waiting for something he wasn't going to get in this life, and that was what was so difficult to take.  That poor thing!  I also didn't care for the professor's wife, because it was obvious she was only putting up with Hachi for her husband's sake, and it made me angry that she didn't keep him in honor of his memory.  True, the kids liked and wanted him, but I wanted to slap her one when she moved away without seeming to think about it twice until returning to the town years later to encounter and old Hachi still sitting at the train station.  Maybe she couldn't handle the memories if she'd kept the dog, but I have a hard time swallowing that one.  We tried to keep my brother's other lab, Boomer, for over a year after he died, but he was just too big and energetic for us, and we had the breeder he got him from help us find a very good home for him.  Believe me, it was hard to do, but he's got a family that just loves him, and he's not bored like he was with us.  We called them and asked how he was doing a few times, and I'll always be glad we did the right thing in that way.While the idea of love and loyalty lasting a lifetime is a very romantic gesture, somehow putting a dog in the picture makes it twice as hard a subject to deal with, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I just don't know if I could watch this again because it was so painful, but at least it taught the grandson a good lesson about love and loyalty, and I like that touch at the end.  If you like movies that are guaranteed to make you cry, this is definitely a good one.  If you love dogs a bit too avidly, you may only want to view this once, because it will definitely get to you and stay with you for a long time to come.",4,A Heartbreaking Testimony of Love and Loyalty.,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,3427,"['will', 'be', 'very', 'honest', 'Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'mind', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'while', 'come', 'are', 'strong', 'parallels', 'story', 'old', 'Disney', 'film', 'Greyfriar', 'Bobby', 'fact', 'latter', 'had', 'something', 'much', 'happier', 'ending', 'one', 'just', 'had', 'tears', 'three', 'times', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'laughing', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'water', 'works.Richard', 'Gere', 'was', 'idyllic', 'dog', 'owner', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'essentially', 'want', 'Hachi', 'brought', 'puppy', 'home', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'man', 'dog', 'bond', 'reminded', 'lot', 'relationship', 'favorite', 'three', 'labs', 'brother', 'no', 'longer', 'only', 'matter', 'months', 'apart', 'Bucky', 'went', 'first', 'was', 'very', 'old', 'sick', '.What', 'movie', 'undying', 'love', 'loyalty', 'dog', 'master', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'other', 'saying', 'something', 'right', 'there', 'lot', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'here', 'how', 'dog', 'was', 'just', 'left', 'loose', 'hang', 'train', 'station', 'had', 'nobody', 'taking', 'daughter', 'husband', 'tried', 'Hachi', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'put', 'anyone', 'else', 'had', 'tried', 'either', 'was', 'too', 'devoted', 'memory', 'reunion', 'master', 'hope', ""n't"", 'considered', 'spoiler', 'inevitably', 'got', 'one', 'characters', 'said', 'dog', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'Nobody', 'bothered', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'neglect', 'was', 'never', 'discouraged', 'mission', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'right', 'deny', 'choice.The', 'problem', 'story', 'dog', 'who', 'rest', 'life', 'sadly', 'waiting', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'life', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'take', 'poor', 'thing', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'professor', 'wife', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'only', 'putting', 'up', 'Hachi', 'husband', 'sake', 'made', 'angry', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'honor', 'memory', 'True', 'kids', 'liked', 'wanted', 'wanted', 'slap', 'one', 'when', 'moved', 'away', 'seeming', 'think', 'twice', 'returning', 'town', 'years', 'later', 'encounter', 'old', 'Hachi', 'still', 'sitting', 'train', 'station', 'Maybe', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'memories', ""'d"", 'kept', 'dog', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'one', 'tried', 'keep', 'brother', 'other', 'lab', 'Boomer', 'year', 'died', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'energetic', 'had', 'breeder', 'got', 'help', 'find', 'very', 'good', 'home', 'Believe', 'was', 'hard', 'do', 'got', 'family', 'just', 'not', 'bored', 'was', 'called', 'asked', 'how', 'was', 'doing', 'few', 'times', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'way.While', 'idea', 'love', 'loyalty', 'lasting', 'lifetime', 'very', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'somehow', 'putting', 'dog', 'picture', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'subject', 'deal', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'painful', 'least', 'taught', 'grandson', 'good', 'lesson', 'love', 'loyalty', 'like', 'touch', 'end', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'cry', 'definitely', 'good', 'one', 'love', 'dogs', 'bit', 'too', 'avidly', 'may', 'only', 'want', 'view', 'once', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'come']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

1317430,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0031RAOVY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[20, 22]","When I first visited Tokyo, Japan, one of the stories that intrigued me before my trip was the story of Hachiko, a dog who would wait outside Shibuya Station back in the 1930's.  [Note: Although the story is quite popular and well-known for those who gone to Japan, I won't spoil the details of the actual tale].The story of Hachiko touched producer Vicki Shikeguni Wong during her trip to Tokyo and inspired to make a film titled ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" based on the true Japanese story for American audiences.  Directed by Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (""Chocolat"", ""Cider House Rules"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") and a screenplay by Stephen P. Lindsey (""When they Could Fly"", ""The Secret of Fireflies""), the film would feature cinematography by Ron Fortunato (""Gossip Girl"", ""Catch a Fire"", ""Brotherhood"") and music composed by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek (""Get Low"", ""Horsemen"", ""Unfaithful"").The film revolves around college professor Parker Wilson (played by Richard Gere, ""Pretty Woman"", ""Chicago"", ""Unfaithful"", ""Primal Fear"") who was coming home from a trip and a small Akita who was accidentally left behind walks up to Parker who then takes the dog back home.Unfortunately, his wife Cate (played by Joan Allen, ""The Bourne Identity"" films, ""Face/Off"", ""The Contender"") is not thrilled to see a dog in the house, even when their daughter Andy (played by Sarah Roemer, ""Disturbia"", ""Fired Up!"", ""The Grudge"") pleads with the mother to keep it.Parker then learns from his friend Ken (played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, ""The Art of War"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") that the dog's name is ""Hachi"" and is an Akita that were popular in feudal Japan. But as Parker tries to find its owner and tries to give the dog away, he finds himself loving the dog and Cate just notices how he is really loving his company with the dog and thus, allows him to keep it.Fast forward year(s) later and Hachi is a grown dog who is loyal to his owner.  He goes home when Parker tells him to and when he hears the incoming train whistling, Hachi knows that his master is coming home and runs to the station and greets him near the station exit.  Among the people who are familiar with Hachi's routine is Carl (played by Jason Alexander, ""Pretty Woman"", ""Seinfeld"") who works at the station, Jess (played by Erick Avari, ""Heroes"", ""Dragnet"") who runs a hot dog concessions stand outside of the station and often gives food to Hachi and a few other business owners around the area.And throughout the seasons, Hachi has repeated his routine of waiting for his master through warm and cold, heavy snow days and has always been loyal to Parker by waiting for him when he returns to the station.  But one day, Parker has a stroke and for Hachi, his loyal dog continues to wait for him.VIDEO:""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray as it manages to capture the seasons as Hachi waits for his master.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail from the fur of Hachi to detail on Parker's wool suits.  Skin tones are natural and again, the detail from the various seasons of trees with leaves and without, snowy conditions, everything looks beautiful in this film. Interesting use of muted colors when the film shifts to Hachi's perspective, as the filmmaker tries to show things through Hachi's eyes.  Overall, very good picture quality for this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is features an English 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  The majority of the film is dialogue driven and thus front and center channel driven but there are a few moments in the film such as a cold windstorm in which you hear rickety noises and wood and object clanging in the background that utilizes the surround channels.  Also, scenes that feature the train running through the train tracks by Hachi is also captured quite well through the surround channels.  Overall, a satisfactory lossless soundtrack for this type of film.Subtitles are in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Hachi"" comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo:* A Bondy of Loyalty - The Making of Hachi: A Dog's Tale - (17:50) A featurette on the making of the film.  Interviews with the talents and why Richard Gere took the role, working with the dogs that played Hachi and more.* Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers* BD-Live EnabledJUDGMENT CALL:""Hachi"" definitely caught my attention when I first saw the trailer.  I've always been interested in the story of Hachiko and it was definitely one of my priorities during my first trip to Tokyo and wanting to see the actual bronze statue of the dog.  Needless to say, when I first heard an American adaptation to the Hachiko tale, especially when there was the film""Hachiko Monogatari"" in 1987 which was a very good film, I was not sure what to expect from ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"".But after watching the film, I was very touched and I have to say that they captured that bond between an owner and a dog, the love for a dog by its owner and most of all, that touching loyalty of the original Hachiko story in this film.It's quite interesting to see Richard Gere in such a film, because you don't expect him in this type of film.  You expect him to take on romantic lead roles or authoritative figures but to see him as a dog lover/owner definitely shows a new light for him as an actor and also, I found it quite intriguing to see the reunion of Gere and Jason Alexander since their pairing back in the 1990 film ""Pretty Woman"".  But the film also features star talents such as Joan Allen, Erick Avari, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and you have a talented director with Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.  But more surprising to me that Sony gave this film a very limited release despite having a well-known director and talent behind the film and pretty much made ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" a direct-to-video release.  I wish they would have given this film a chance because it's a very good film with a solid performance by Richard Gere especially with his interaction with Hachi (you're not going to see many films with Richard Gere with a tennis ball in his mouth, while trying to teach a dog how to play fetch).Granted, when it comes to canine films especially with a well-known story about Hachiko the dog, I can understand if people are hesitant after seeing tearjerkers such as ""Quill"" or even ""Marley & Me"".  It's a very touching film and pays its respect quite well to the original Japanese story based on the real story about Professor Hidesaburo Ueno and his Akita, Hachiko.Overall, ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is an enjoyable and touching film that will make you laugh and cry and a film definitely worth watching!",5,"Blu-ray: A film that will make you laugh and cry, ""Hacki: A Dog's Tale"" is a film worth

I had always heard about the tale of Chuken Hachiko (""faithful Hachiko"") as a child from my mother, essentially a Japanese version of the Scottish Greyfriars Bobby.  I eagerly bought the DVD and planned to have this as a cherished dog film for my collection.  (Spoilers ahead.)My husband and I sat down to watch, eager to see a heart-warming tale.  At first, we were aghast when Hachi was forced to sleep in a shed outside the family home!  No cushion for a bed, no dog sleeping indoors by the hearth.  So much for showing the family dog affection.  After the professor dies, loyal Hachi keeps waiting at the train statiOn for him to return home.  When the dog is finally found by the professor's wife, if I recall, I was hoping she would take him home and keep him in a secure home or yard.  And then she leaves him to run loose as a stray!  Not even an attempt to bring him home!  The final straw for me was with the professor's son and daughter-in-law, who really did not care about the dog. (Or was it a daughter and son-in-law?  The film was not memorable for me.  I chose to forget.)Maybe this was the true story of Hachiko, and his family who let him run loose as a stray dog, only to die in streets of cancer and worms, but I was looking for (because of the contemporary American setting and cast) a modern take on a loyal dog.  I wanted some revisionism and a happy, bittersweet ending.This film was really a missed opportunity to show just how to love and care for a dog.  Hachi's love and loyalty were repaid with neglect and abandonment.After watching this film, I was thoroughly disturbed and disgusted as a dog lover.  It was not about Hachi, but about his self-absorbed family who really didn't care about him.",1,Shocking and disappointing,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1823,"['When', 'heard', 'was', 'DVD', 'be', 'released', 'famous', 'Japanese', 'dog', 'Hachiko', 'was', 'elated', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'tale', 'Chuken', 'Hachiko', 'faithful', 'Hachiko', 'child', 'mother', 'essentially', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Scottish', 'Greyfriars', 'Bobby', 'eagerly', 'bought', 'DVD', 'planned', 'have', 'cherished', 'dog', 'film', 'collection', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'husband', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'eager', 'see', 'heart-warming', 'tale', 'first', 'were', 'aghast', 'when', 'Hachi', 'was', 'forced', 'sleep', 'shed', 'family', 'home', 'cushion', 'bed', 'dog', 'sleeping', 'indoors', 'hearth', 'So', 'much', 'showing', 'family', 'dog', 'affection', 'professor', 'loyal', 'Hachi', 'waiting', 'train', 'statiOn', 'return', 'home', 'When', 'dog', 'finally', 'found', 'professor', 'wife', 'recall', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'take', 'home', 'keep', 'secure', 'home', 'yard', 'then', 'run', 'loose', 'stray', 'Not', 'even', 'attempt', 'bring', 'home', 'final', 'straw', 'was', 'professor', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'dog', 'was', 'daughter', 'son-in-law', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'memorable', 'chose', 'forget', 'Maybe', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'Hachiko', 'family', 'who', 'let', 'run', 'loose', 'stray', 'dog', 'only', 'die', 'streets', 'cancer', 'worms', 'was', 'looking', 'contemporary', 'American', 'setting', 'cast', 'modern', 'take', 'loyal', 'dog', 'wanted', 'revisionism', 'happy', 'bittersweet', 'ending.This', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'love', 'care', 'dog', 'Hachi', 'love', 'loyalty', 'were', 'repaid', 'neglect', 'abandonment.After', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'disturbed', 'disgusted', 'dog', 'lover', 'was', 'not', 'Hachi', 'self-absorbed', 'family', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

1317446,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B0031RAOVY,Edmonson,"[116, 120]","""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules), and is based loosely on the real life story of a dog, named Hachiko, who was born in Odate, Japan in 1923. His master, Dr. Eisaburg Ueno, was a professor at the University of Tokyo who died in 1925. Hachiko returned to the Shibuya train station the next day, and every day for the next nine years until he died in 1934. Today, outside the Shibuya train station, where Hachiko waited, is a bronze statue of Hachiko.In this particular movie we have a similar story, only the dog is in transport to the United States, where he escapes, and ends up in Parker Wilson's (Richard Gere) possession. Parker eventually decides to keep the dog since the owner cannot be found. Hachiko, or Hachi, as he is usually called here, at one point breaks free of his yard, and follows Parker to the train station. Eventually Hachi is allowed to accompany Paker to the train station everyday. But at one point Parker never returns to the train station, since he has died at the university.The movie then becomes a tale of a loyalty that reaches far into the bonds of memory. Hachiko never realizes that his master has died, and even though he never sees his master again, he never forgets him. What is Hachi's purpose now that his master has died? His purpose seems to be to wait for his master who will never return. It is at once moving and heartrending, as it is a tragedy of sorts, and one that is only resolved once Hachiko also dies. This is a beautifully told tale that makes one think about the things that are important for us to go on living, even after those that we have loved have died.",4,The bonds of memory,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,1658,"['Hachiko', 'Dog', 'Tale', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'based', 'loosely', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'dog', 'named', 'Hachiko', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Odate', 'Japan', '1923', 'master', 'Dr.', 'Eisaburg', 'Ueno', 'was', 'professor', 'University', 'Tokyo', 'who', 'died', '1925', 'Hachiko', 'returned', 'Shibuya', 'train', 'station', 'next', 'day', 'day', 'next', 'nine', 'years', 'died', '1934', 'Today', 'Shibuya', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'Hachiko', 'waited', 'bronze', 'statue', 'Hachiko.In', 'particular', 'movie', 'have', 'similar', 'story', 'only', 'dog', 'transport', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'up', 'Parker', 'Wilson', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'possession', 'Parker', 'eventually', 'keep', 'dog', 'owner', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'Hachiko', 'Hachi', 'usually', 'called', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'breaks', 'free', 'yard', 'Parker', 'train', 'station', 'Eventually', 'Hachi', 'allowed', 'accompany', 'Paker', 'train', 'station', 'everyday', 'one', 'point', 'Parker', 'never', 'train', 'station', 'died', 'university.The', 'movie', 'then', 'tale', 'loyalty', 'far', 'bonds', 'memory', 'Hachiko', 'never', 'master', 'died', 'even', 'never', 'master', 'again', 'never', 'What', 'Hachi', 'purpose', 'now', 'master', 'died', 'purpose', 'be', 'wait', 'master', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'return', 'once', 'moving', 'heartrending', 'tragedy', 'sorts', 'one', 'only', 'resolved', 'once', 'Hachiko', 'also', 'beautifully', 'told', 'tale', 'one', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'go', 'living', 'even', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'died']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

Hachi is just that. A film about that strong relationship among a dog and his person, which is as strong as the one among a parent and child.  And if you are a loving dog owner, you can't bear to see how sad your dog will be if you can't be with him or her anymore.

1317456,AY12DBB0U420B,B0031RAOVY,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night I wanted to take a break in my movie watching. Too many of my movies of late have been crime stories, action movies, war stories, and things of that sort. Murder, mayhem, gunfire, explosions and  foul language seem to dominate. I have nothing against this type of entertainment, in fact, I njoy it. However I needed a break. I found ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" on a five-dollar DVD rack and bought it. The movie was rated G and I only seldom watch G-rated movies.Okay, this is a really  simple dog story that originated in Japan in the 30s and was brought and adapted to the US. It might be simple, but keep your hanky within reach. An Akita puppy was sent to a railway station, probably in New England,  the shipping crate was broken and the small dog wandered about the station until discovered by a professor (Richard Gere). It was late and Gere tried to fix things but couldn't so he  took the dog home on a temporary basis. The next day he continued to try and rid himself of the puppy, but you all can probably guess what happened. He ended up adopting the beautiful little dog.Well, the first half of the movie consists of the lost dog, the finding of the dog and the adoption and the gradual assimilation of the dog (Hachi) into the lives of Gere, his wife (Joan Allen) and their family. Not much excitement. The man and dog bond became stronger and stronger. To best understand and enjoy the story, it would probably be best if you had such a bond at some time in your life, but that isn't necessary. At about the mid-point in the movie, Gere suddenly died in his classroom. From there on Hachi is the leading actor. It's a simple story of deep love and devotion, and remember, keep that box of tissues handy.This is a really simple, really well done film that packs an emotional wallop second to none. I'm amazed it hasn't gathered more attention. It's the best  dog story I've ever watched.Gary Peterson",5,Best Dog Story I've Ever Watched.

Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental until it becomes clear that this is 'a dog's tale' and dogs see in black and white!), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers.  Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both  Kaneto Shind and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale).  The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen).  But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs.And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal.

Then I read the cover--and then I remembered. It wasn't the first time I had read this story. I was stationed in Japan during my days in the military and I saw the statue of the real Hachiko at Shibuya Station in Tokyo then.Overall, although the story loses something in its translation from 1920s Japan to 1990s America, the movie is really good, a tale of loyalty that will bring a lump to your throat.And it also brings to the table some unique cinematography that I've never seen in any other animal movies.

If Hachiko had made it into the theaters, it surely would have won a few awards. This movie has to be one of the best adaptations of a true life story I have ever watched.Hachiko is based on an Akita Inu dog named Hachiko, who was owned by a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo in 1924 and how Hachiko would wait for him to come home from the train station even after his master died.Hachiko: A Dog's Story is told in near perfection. Hachi arrives all the way from Japan as a puppy to the United States, but is lost and found walking around the train station by Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Parker takes the puppy home until he can find the owner. His wife Cate, played by Joan Allen, is not pleased. But after a few days, the little Hachi brings laughs and joy into their household. Parker tries to teach Hachi to play fetch, but Hachi refuses, because Parker's associate, Ken (Cary-Hiruki Tagawa) explains how Hachi is a proud and regal dog. He goes on to say how the bond between Parker and Hachi will never be broken.Months go by, and before Hachi turns one, he has a new trick. He has figured out how to go back and forth to the train station as Parker goes into work everyday. For the next year, Hachi escorts Parker to the train station, then at 4:55pm, he is there waiting for Parker to come home. Carl, the ticket booth conductor, played by Jason Alexander, is not amused, but most of the commuters, as well as the hot dog vendor and bookstore owner across the street from the station think it's delightful.And then one day, Parker doesn't return home. And Hachi waits and waits for his master everyday at 4:55pm for the next ten years to be reunited with him. Years go by, through snow, rain and wind, Hachi waits for Parker until that moment when they will be reunited.I sobbed liked a baby to the point where I had a massive headache through most of Hachiko. Talk about a heartbreaking and moving experience, especially since it is all true. Richard Gere, as Parker, plays a wonderful and a loving husband, father and dog owner. The love and bond shown between Parker and Hachi lasts forever and regardless if you are a pet owner or don't really care for animals, this movie will break your heart.Hachiko is the best family entertainment out there and will make your heart swell. This is the perfect example about how the power of love can last, even in death. There haven't been many movies in recent years that had such a profound effect on me. Hachiko certainly did and one I whole heartedly recommend you watch as soon as you can. I really can't find anything wrong about this movie. You may also want to have a box of tissues handy, because while you watch and for hours after, you will cry your eyes out.*The legend of Hachiko lives on. His remains are kept at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. In April 1934, a bronze statue in his likeness was erected at Shibuya Station. The statue still stands there to this day.*Katiebabs",5,Amazing Movie of Loyalty and Frienship That Will Make You Sob (A+ Grade),1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3344,"['First', 'was', 'Seabiscuit', 'then', 'was', 'Marley', 'Me', 'Now', 'recent', 'movie', 'bonds', 'love', 'loyalty', 'owner', 'dog', 'had', 'balling', 'eyes', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'never', 'ever', 'cry', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'mess', 'Hachiko', 'Dog', 'Tale', '2009', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Hachiko', 'had', 'made', 'theaters', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'few', 'awards', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.Hachiko', 'based', 'Akita', 'Inu', 'dog', 'named', 'Hachiko', 'who', 'was', 'owned', 'professor', 'agriculture', 'University', 'Tokyo', '1924', 'how', 'Hachiko', 'would', 'wait', 'come', 'home', 'train', 'station', 'even', 'master', 'died.Hachiko', 'Dog', 'Story', 'told', 'near', 'perfection', 'Hachi', 'way', 'Japan', 'puppy', 'United', 'States', 'lost', 'found', 'walking', 'train', 'station', 'Parker', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Parker', 'puppy', 'home', 'can', 'find', 'owner', 'wife', 'Cate', 'played', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'not', 'pleased', 'few', 'days', 'little', 'Hachi', 'laughs', 'joy', 'household', 'Parker', 'teach', 'Hachi', 'play', 'fetch', 'Hachi', 'Parker', 'associate', 'Ken', 'Cary-Hiruki', 'Tagawa', 'how', 'Hachi', 'proud', 'regal', 'dog', 'say', 'how', 'bond', 'Parker', 'Hachi', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'broken.Months', 'go', 'Hachi', 'one', 'new', 'trick', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'train', 'station', 'Parker', 'work', 'everyday', 'next', 'year', 'Hachi', 'Parker', 'train', 'station', 'then', '4:55pm', 'there', 'waiting', 'Parker', 'come', 'home', 'Carl', 'ticket', 'conductor', 'played', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'not', 'amused', 'most', 'commuters', 'as', 'well', 'hot', 'dog', 'vendor', 'bookstore', 'owner', 'street', 'station', 'think', 'delightful.And', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'return', 'home', 'Hachi', 'waits', 'waits', 'master', 'everyday', '4:55pm', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'be', 'reunited', 'Years', 'go', 'snow', 'rain', 'wind', 'Hachi', 'Parker', 'moment', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'reunited.I', 'sobbed', 'liked', 'baby', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'massive', 'headache', 'most', 'Hachiko', 'Talk', 'heartbreaking', 'moving', 'experience', 'especially', 'true', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Parker', 'wonderful', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'dog', 'owner', 'love', 'bond', 'shown', 'Parker', 'Hachi', 'forever', 'regardless', 'are', 'pet', 'owner', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'animals', 'movie', 'will', 'break', 'heart.Hachiko', 'best', 'family', 'entertainment', 'there', 'will', 'make', 'heart', 'swell', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'power', 'love', 'can', 'last', 'even', 'death', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'had', 'profound', 'effect', 'Hachiko', 'certainly', 'did', 'one', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'wrong', 'movie', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'have', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'watch', 'hours', 'will', 'cry', 'eyes', 'out', '*The', 'legend', 'Hachiko', 'remains', 'are', 'kept', 'National', 'Science', 'Museum', 'Japan', 'Ueno', 'Tokyo', 'April', '1934', 'bronze', 'statue', 'likeness', 'was', 'erected', 'Shibuya', 'Station', 'statue', 'still', 'there', 'day', '*Katiebabs']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

Be sure, however, that you've stocked up on Kleenex in advance.""Hachi"" is based on a true story that is known to every Japanese schoolchild. Transposed to modern-day New England, it is the story of an Akita puppy, lost in transit from Japan to a new owner in America, who is found and rescued in a train station by a music professor (Richard Gere). Over the initial opposition of the professor's wife (Joan Allen), Hachi moves into the professor's home, and he and the professor become inseparable. Hachi accompanies the professor as he walks to the station to catch the train to work, and is always there to greet him when he returns home.The mostly expository first hour of ""Hachi"" is pleasant enough but slightly dull, except for the sequences in which the action is shown through Hachi's eyes. Frankly, I don't find Richard Gere a terribly interesting actor when he's not playing a viilain or a con man, and here, of course, he's a sweetheart. But that doesn't matter in the end, because ""Hachi"" really is the dog's tale, and Hachi--or, more to the point, the various Akitas who play Hachi as a puppy, an adult dog, and finally an old dog--is the true star. Furthermore, the first hour is vital to setting up the final half-hour, when the story--now fully focused on Hachi--achieves sublimity. If you're a firm believer in the love and loyalty of dogs--or even if you aren't--the last half-hour of ""Hachi"" will move you to the core of your being.I only hope ""Hachi"" doesn't motivate novice or unprepared dog owners to buy an Akita. If the ""making-of"" documentary on this DVD doesn't give you the hint, every book and TV program on Akitas will: Akitas are proud, stubborn, fiercely loyal dogs that regard anyone outside the immediate family as an interloper. Having an Akita in your house is like having a samurai in your house, and I mean a samurai who is half-wolf. But the Akitas in ""Hachi"" are magnficent dogs by any standard.

1317563,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0031RAOVY,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Director Lasse Hallstom (""Cider House Rules"") recreates a 1987 Japanese film (""Hachiko Monogatari"") which was based on a true story from the late 1920's.  Richard Gere stars as Parker Wilson, a middle aged college music professor.  He lives in a bucolic small town in what appears to be New England and commutes on the train to work.  One day he arrives home to find an Akita puppy wondering the train station platform.  He takes the dog home and tries to find the owner but alas no luck. With the reluctant approval of his wife (Joan Allen), he adopts the dog.From this point, it's just a matter of time to determine what unfortunate fate will strike the dog (Hachi) or the Wilson family.  And since this is really a movie about a man and his dog's love and loyalty, the ""G"" rating should give away the answer.  Yes there is a goodly amount of sentimentality but not enough to make the movie overly schmaltzy.  Ultimately it has a good story, some decent acting and is heartwarming and modest enough for the entire family.The Blu ray version of this film is just fine.  Shot on video, it comes with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  Although not of demo quality, it was always accurate and clear.  The  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack likewise is perfectly fine.  Most of the action is up front and the dialog is clear and distinctive.

1317571,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B0031RAOVY,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[2, 2]","Well I definitely shed a few tears at this movie.  Ok, maybe more than a few, but give me a break, it's a touching story about a dog.  Who wouldn't cry?  And even better, it's loosely based on a true story.When Parker finds a puppy on his way home from the train station, he doesn't intend to keep it.  But when no owner turns up, and he develops an attachment for the Akita dog, he adopts himself a pet.  Hachi is very close to Parker and as he grows he begins finding ways to see him off and meet him at the train station everyday for Parker's commute.  But Hachi's loyalty is put to the test when one day, Parker doesn't come off the train.Characters:Hachi: Played by Chico, Layla and ForrestRichard Gere: Parker WilsonJoan Allen: Cate WilsonCary Hiroyuki Tagawa: Ken FujiyoshiSarah Roemer: Andy WilsonJason Alexander: Carl BoilinsErick Avari: JasjeetI think each person (and dog) was picked appropriately for their role.  The dogs were all marvelously trained and wonderfully cute, and I could feel the stirring and want for a dog as a result.  Alas, I would only adopt an adult dog rather than buy a puppy because of how I feel about rescues, but they were undeniably cute and my cats would never forgive me anyway.  So no dog for now.  Richard Gere as Parker was also very good and I could really identify with him and his love for Hachi.  They shared a very close bond and you couldn't really tell it was a movie relationship instead of a real one.  The other characters don't feature as much, but I did really like Jasjeet and his concern and care for Hachi.  A very redeeming person and he was played well by Avari.There isn't a lot of action in this film.  No intrigue, suspense, etc.  It was a story of loyalty and that's all that was needed.  Simply seeing Hachi's life was enough.  And they even filmed it as though some of it was through his eyes without trying to make it seem from a human's perspective.  It was just Hachi, as a dog, seeing what he was seeing and reacting to it.  And I liked that.  But I also liked the family and their interaction with Hachi, and Parker's devotion to him.  The fact that I used up half a box of tissues isn't even a problem.  If a movie is good enough to make me cry then there is no way I'm not going to adore it.  That being said, if you can't handle hard topics, you may not want to watch this movie.  But any animal lover will be able to understand and relate to it.As said before, this movie is sometimes shot from Hachi's view, which is interesting.  It's not quite black and white, but there is an absence of color but it seems realistic.  Not that I know what a dog sees, but this could definitely be plausible.  The rest is standard filming and it wasn't too shaky or anything, it was just there to capture the film.  And the music was also in the background.  Parker was a professor of music, but it's mostly light calming music and it fits into the background to set a backdrop, not to be the main focus.Fantastic movie that really captured the life of a wonderful dog.  Even though it was only loosely based on a real story, the themes of loyalty and love are well presented.Review by M.

This movie deserved and still deserves more attention !So on to the movie itself ...A tough guy like me does not usually get choked up over movies, but here is one I can recommend to you that will probably touch you.It is based on a true story from Japan ... although this version with Richard Gere has been shifted to USA.Basically this is the story if you don't already know it.WARNING SPOILER BELOW .......................................A college professor had a dog that was loyal to him.Each day it would follow him to the train station where he left for work.The dog would run around and do whatever all day long.But at 5:00 in the evening the dog was always back at the train station to meet his owner.This went on for years,One day the dog was waiting at the train station, but the professor never showed up.The professor had died of a heart attack at the school campus that day.For the next 9 years, the dog kept waiting and looking for it's owner at the train station everyday.Other people would try to take the dog home, but every time the dog would run away and return to the train station trying to wait for the professor.He became a local legend and the other people at the train station each day would bring the dog food and water to take care of him since the dog refused to leave his post.Eventually 9 years later the dog died, still sitting at the train station watching the people get off every train, looking for his owner.Today in Japan where this really happened they have a bronze statue of the dog sitting in the train station as a tribute to that kind of loyalty......................................END OF SPOILERI suppose the reason I found this particular story touching enough to even put a lump in my throat was two reasons ..1)  I have always thought there is something innocent and pure about an animals loyalty and affections that is rare in humans.2)  When I was young and walking to elementary school, my friend had a dog named Pal.He would follow us when we walked the 2 miles to school.He would wait for us all day long.I can remember sitting in classes and looking out the window and seeing that dog under a tree looking at the school building and waiting for us to get out.When we got out of class in the afternoon he would be all excited and come running to meet us and follow us home again.This went on for around 2 years as I recall.But one day when we got out of school, the dog was all excited to see us and came running across the parking lot.We started yelling ""NO PAL. STOP""But it did not help.Pal ran in front of a school bus in the parking lot.Now being older and wiser, I look back at this story from childhood and think ..........Yes, it is a cute story about boys and their dogs growing up together.But the real world is not the 1800 or early 1900s of farmhouses, dirt roads and horse & buggies anymore.The world is an urban , mechanized jungle that is dangerous for loosely roaming animals.If people really care about their animals they should not let them run around loose all day long to get hit by cars or other dangers.This is one of those rare movies you see in life that will leave an impression.Well done to everybody who worked on this project !",5,All the more special because it is based on true story,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,4302,"['film',

I greatly fell in love with the story and since then always wanted an Akita. I have never seen this movie but I love animals and greatly enjoy animal movies, and the reviews were positive so I bought. Within seven minutes into this movie I already was crying. By the time this movie was over I was a complete mess. I have never cried this much ever. I am not an emotional person so this movie got to me. The last seven minutes of the movie, my cat Logan, (who never likes to cuddle or be smothered with love, unless its on his own terms), actually let me hold his paw and cry the entire time. This movie is so powerful. You need to have a box of kleenex on hand because this movie is incredibly powerful. It breaks your heart how he stays there waiting. My dad has an outdoor cat in his neighborhood that everyone lends a hand and takes care of, feeding him, letting him stay inside their house, etc, but he will never just stay in one place or be an inside cat. He wants out. So I can understand Hachi needing to  leave his home and be there waiting at the train station. Even Richard Gere stated that when he read the script he kept crying and was a mess. If you love animals dearly and enjoy the unconditional love they give you, watch this movie.

All movies whether good or bad have moments in them that are high marks or passing scenes which are branded in memory. Hachi, for me has that moment- Everytime Professor Parker returned Hachi to his little backyard shed he would peek through the crooked wood pickets and simply---- look up to see his master and just look. We as the audience would see Hachis eye looking up. Oh that short scene just got to me. The entire movie transcends the boy and his dog (man and his dog) relationship to a spiritual one of total oneness. Hachi loved his master so much he that he never ever gave up waiting for his arrival. He was in fact waiting for him too in Heaven of course as we see at the end. This film is for all people period. Such a fine piece of movie making. I am glad Lasse H. directed as he was the perfect choice. This movie should be rated A for ALL Audiences!!!

1317595,AXPIKH59MI942,B0031RAOVY,R. A. Cardenas,"[3, 3]","The original 1987 Japanese version was filled with many ironies and trajectories that seemed to focus more on Hachi's private struggles. In the beginning, after a long train journey in the winter in which he almost dies, from inside the small cage in which he is transported from the breeder to his new home, Hachi as a small 2 month old pup opens his eyes to the hands of the one who would eventually become his sole friend and loyal master. He is fated for yet another journey, a life-long journey filled with much struggle for survival, but again culminating in the hands of his master. Ironies surround the name chosen for him, Hachi, which in Japanese is the number 8 and one which signifies promise and good fortune, even divine favor. It also turns out that Hachi is the 5th of 5 Akita breds that his master had tried to raise. The first four did not survive 2 years, Hachi the 5th is the one that does. The twist is that though Hachi survives well beyond 2 years, his master does not which puts him on multiple trajectories of life-threatening struggle. Eventually abandoned to the streets, one thing keeps him focused in his long journey, his love for and loyalty to his master. His  9 yr search for his deceased master (which actually occurred in the true historical biography of Hachi) drives him into the hearts of a few compassionate people, but mostly into the ire of others. And this is how the original version played out, finally ending in Hachi's dramatic reunion with his master and release from this world with its hardships and betrayals. His loyalty is fulfilled.This later American version is similar on some fronts but different on others: fewer ironies I believe. It focuses more on simplicity, family and community. The film's slow metabolism gravitates more towards Hachi's experience that we might understand and experience how he experienced events and relationships, such that in his simple black and white world salted with simple acts of giving and receiving, the simple truth and sincerity of those acts reveal themselves forming into lasting bonds of friendship, commitment and loyalty. These transactions  eventually extend into the larger community in his daily vigils at the town square so that something very uncommon begins to flow out of something that appears very common. The film achieves in depth what it lacks in surface.To illustrate further, at his master's funeral service, words of Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass_Songs To Myself"" are read aloud by his university associate and friend Ken Fujiyoshi. Ken reads: ""  I hear and behold God in every object.........I find letters from God dropped in the street, .......And I leave them where they are for I know that others will punctually come forever and ever"". For purposes of this film, this might allude to the divine nature of the number 8 (Hachi) in Japanese culture, signifying something rising to and coming down from Heaven to earth,  but also to the notion that there is nothing `common', that all is commonly uncommon, that everything has impact from a solitary snow flake descending to earth upon heavenly currents and existing for not more than a moment to a pup that sees and hears in black and white.As the trains themselves are currents in the daily life of the community, Hachi himself becomes a quiet but impactful undercurrent at the station....a memo to  the community about the importance of family, faith, friendship, relationships, commitment  and loyalty, vitals to the human spirit and social body. And this is where I believe the original Japanese film and the American version contrast. In this version, Hachi's life has more impact in the community. Today a monument to Hachi stands in his honor at the Shibuya station and is one of the most attended sites in Tokyo. The simple but grounded image of the faithful companion resides there an anachronism to the modern time-driven world encouraging pedestrians, viewers and visitors to be more attentive to relationships and things of the human spirit, past and future, with all of their perplexities and uncertainties. Whispers though they be become loud when finally acknowledged.A brief summary of this film's final moments follows:After 10 years, his mistress finally came to terms with her husband's death and returned to visit her daughter, son-in-law and grandson. It was at the end of the year, during the Christmas season, a time for giving. Before going to her family's home, while it was still daytime, she visited her former home, and then her husband's grave. From there she passed by the station where she found Hachiko waiting at his spot, now a much older version, weaker, heavier and in fading colors, but his loyalty never diminishing.  He looked tired, even sad, but recognized his mistress and welcomed her. His mistress, surprised, gave to him the affection she had withheld when they were together in those earlier years. In so doing, she was not only embracing Hachi, but also loving her husband. She stayed by his side for the next train after which she departed to her daughter's home. With their family reunited, the circle was now complete, the stage set.Hachi would find Home that evening dying peacefully in his master's arms while faithfully waiting in the same place he had all these years. The sun had set, Christmas lights illumined the station, the air was crisp, and a light snow began to fall as it did 11 years earlier when he found his master. Hachi, having worked his way to the station for the evening arrival, laid at his spot at the front of the circle's edge ( a small circular island overlayed with flowers and a park bench at its center), hoping but with dimming vision. The station, except for a few people departing, appeared empty. Hachi, not finding his master among them fell asleep from exhaustion and began to dream: He saw a brightly lit Train arriving at the station while at the same time began re-living memories of some of his most cherished moments. He saw himself running and walking with his master as they enjoyed their companionship on paths to his home. It was in a warm and brightly lit world cognizant of no end. His master now disembarking the Train as he had always done emerged through the doors into Hachi's Heart where he faithfully gave himself one last time. The circle complete, Hachi found him as he did 11 years earlier, at the station in the colors of beginnings, without mystery. Lunging from himself into his master's arms he freely gave himself as a gift without age borne out of an uncommon bond of companionship, trust and loyalty. Hachi passed on separating quietly, peacefully and seamlessly where he lay. As the falling snow sank into his now still and hollow brow, the Train quietly departed with its lamps fading into the silent cold mists of the night.....This is a very well acted film with a very good script, highly recommended for animal lovers and the sensitive of heart. This is not really a Richard Gere type of film but he demonstrated his versatility with an award level performance. Watch both the Japanese and American versions to compare and contrast. Both are well done...",5,The Commonly Uncommon,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,7137,"['original', '1987', 'Japanese', 'version', 'was', 'filled', 'many', 'ironies', 'trajectories', 'seemed', 'focus',

Attila ""If honest work and justice are not...","[62, 93]","Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing.

Zen proverbHachi chose music professor Parker Wilson at a train station returning from a trip. Parker's wife welcomes Parker home with ""I missed you"" but Hachi is secreted in the living room since Cate doesn't want another dog in the house after their last dog Luke passed. The loving relationship of a couple married for 25 years is touching ""we've been together longer than we've been apart."" Cate gently reminds Parker they agreed no more dogs.Married People: Staying Together in the Age of DivorceParker's ""I hear you"" acknowledges to Cate marital communication: Parker knew when he brought the dog home their prior agreement.Marley & Me (Three-Disc Bad Dog Edition) [Blu-ray]Parker leaves a light on in the garage so Hachi won't be alone in the dark.The tag on the crate carrying Hachiko says Yamashita central Japan. Dog collar has number 8 Hachi for the connection between earth and heaven and back to earth. So Parker names the dog Hachi. Akitas were first domesticated 4000 years ago connecting with humans for combat training. Akitas are working dogs who act only with purpose and meaning. Akitas cannot be bought and do not fetch, instead they are noble and dignified.The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)Hachi tries to keep the professor from leaving on the train when he senses the professor is not well by offering Luke's ball for fetch. It is Hachi's way of trying to stop the Professor from leaving, not an attempt to play with or please the Professor. Hachi understands duty, responsibility, loyalty, devotion, protection.Hachi is given the deceased Luke's toys, ball and sock monkey. But Hachi is dutiful only to his master Parker, he is not a people pleasing friend.The movie quietly insinuates itself into the heart with the comfort of friendliness, kindness, generosity, humility. Hachi does what he needs to do because he needs to do it. Not to please others, not to be praised or petted or given treats. Hachi has no ego, only dedication.This movie celebrates love, marriage, parenting, bond between dog and man.""Life cannot be kept captive, the heart cannot be kept captive, creation is fleeting and we can only know that others will punctually keep coming for ever and ever.""The awkward moment of Michael's meeting Andy's parents for the first time is honored by Richard Gere's ""do you love my daughter?  Then remember that during the hard times."" Tiny bit of advice offered with lovingkindness to a sustain marriage through the long haul.Milton and Myra butcher shop owners, Jasjeet hot dog vendor and Mary Anne owner of Antonia the cat and bookshop across the street from the train station are touched by the unconditional love offered by Hachi for the Professor.When the real Professor Ueno passed away at school in Tokyo Hachi continued his vigil at the train station each evening for 10years. Numerous people tried to take him in; he always broke away to tend to his duty at the station each evening. Hachi became a street dog. The station master created a small room for him to sleep in so he could roam freely in the station. The gardener to the professor offered Hachiko shelter and a home as well. Local vendors tried to keep him fed and cared for.Hachiko became so famous that a year before his death a bronze statue was erected at Shibuya Station in his honor. Hachiko attended the unveiling. There is another statue at Odate train station where Hachiko was born in 1923. Throngs of crowds came to visit Hachi, who, as he aged, became less tolerant of children pulling on his ears, distracting him from his duty. He began avoiding the station except at the appointed hour.When Hachiko died he was found a block away from the station not able to make his last journey of duty. Autopsy revealed chicken bones piercing his stomach, evidence of his life on the streets.Hachiko could not be contained or kept from his responsibility by people who tried to adopt him.Movie Hachi ""You do what you have to do."" Hachi comes and goes, does without, must tend his vigil. ""If Hachi wants to wait, he must wait.""Daughter Andy tries to incarcerate Hachi in her yard where he is safe fed clean. Hachi needs to leave, his soul is fed by his devotion and Andy respects Hachi's autonomy enough to let him do what he has to do and not crush his soul with restricting safety.10years later widow Cate visits Parker's grave and finds Hachi waiting at the station.  Respectful of the dog's dignified meeting of his obligation Cate asks ""do you mind if I wait with you?""Never forget anyone you love.10 stars for warming the heart to humility and devotion.Also see

People who aren't into dogs may not get this film and will probably find it dull, but for folks who are dog lovers, you'll totally get into it. Anyone who owns a dog knows how loyal they are so it didn't even surprise me that Hachiko kept coming to the train station to meet his master, Parker (played by Richard Gere), after he died. What surprised me was that he did it for nine years. Wow, now that's dedication. I was happy that nobody bothered the dog the entire time he just kept coming back. This dog was all kinds of cute. From a puppy on, when I wasn't sniffling while watching a heartbroken dog, I was awe-ing at how absolutely adorable the puppy was. He wasn't too shabby as a full-grown dog either, but as a puppy, I wanted to bury my face in his fur.This is probably the only film I've ever seen with someone who outshined Richard Gere.

I was so pleased that they kept the story simple; one of a man and his dog, of forging bonds of unconditional love and devotion. And, even though I knew the story very well and, prepared myself in advance, the tears were inevitable.Going straight to DVD, this film will not be a big money maker, therefore, I consider it a timeless gift and treasure, from all involved with the project.  It was not easy, taking a year to complete, clearly becoming a labor of love.  Watching Gere interact with the dogs, you can tell he is truly in his element. The joy on his face makes you believe that Hachi really is his devoted companion. I truly thank and respect Gere for joining such a challenging endeavor and I can't think of anyone more perfect for the role of the sensitive Professor.Throughout the film, it was made fairly clear, that Akitas are not typical dogs. This was further evidenced in the 'Making of the Film.'  The trainers thought they had met their match, when two months into the project, the dogs simply would not perform.  They found that Akitas are no trick-ponies; they are stubborn and don't suffer foolish tasks.  With much patience, the project was eventually successful. You will also find a comment following the credits about how Akitas are NOT for everyone.  I consider these additions to the film to represent responsible education regarding Akita ownership, and, I applaud them for the inclusions.I must add, that although I dearly love Akitas, they are not the only breed with histories of bravery and devotion.  Given proper training and bonding, some mixed breed dogs that we unfortunately see chained in backyards, might show the same call of duty. It's not so much about the breed, but creating the connection---opening one's heart, and truly letting that furry creature in, which Gere lovingly demonstrates in the film.I think Hachiko's story is a good reminder, that ALL dogs have thinking, emotive minds; that they are, family, not something to be possessed. That said, Hachi will continue to educate us from the grave, for generations to come.  I can't think of a more profound legacy.This is a beautifully rendered, family film---one that, once watched, will never be forgotten. It is destined to become a classic.  I can't recommend it highly enough; just have tissues at hand.",5,"Watch through credits and 'Making of the Film,' for full impact.",1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,2504,"['owner', 'Akita', 'almost', '12', 'years', 'now', ""'The"", 'Bridge', 'have', 'been', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'Hachiko', 'Monogatari', '1987', 'Japanese', 'production', 'be', 'adapted', 'American', 'audience', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'kept', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'man', 'dog', 'forging', 'bonds', 'unconditional', 'love', 'devotion', 'even', 'knew', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'prepared', 'advance', 'tears', 'were', 'inevitable.Going', 'straight', 'DVD', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'money', 'maker', 'therefore', 'consider', 'timeless', 'gift', 'treasure', 'involved', 'project', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'taking', 'year', 'complete', 'clearly', 'becoming', 'labor', 'love', 'Watching', 'Gere', 'interact', 'dogs', 'can', 'tell', 'truly', 'element', 'joy', 'face', 'believe', 'Hachi', 'really', 'devoted', 'companion', 'truly', 'thank', 'respect', 'Gere', 'joining', 'challenging', 'endeavor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'more', 'perfect', 'role', 'sensitive', 'Professor.Throughout', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'fairly', 'clear', 'Akitas', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'dogs', 'was', 'further', 'evidenced', ""'Making"", 'Film', 'trainers', 'thought', 'had', 'met', 'match', 'when', 'two', 'months', 'project', 'dogs', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'perform', 'found', 'Akitas', 'are', 'trick-ponies', 'are', 'stubborn', 'do', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'foolish', 'tasks', 'much', 'patience', 'project', 'was', 'eventually', 'successful', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'comment', 'following', 'credits', 'how', 'Akitas', 'are', 'NOT', 'everyone', 'consider', 'additions', 'film', 'represent', 'responsible', 'education', 'regarding', 'Akita', 'ownership', 'applaud', 'inclusions.I', 'must', 'add', 'dearly', 'love', 'Akitas', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'breed', 'histories', 'bravery', 'devotion', 'Given', 'proper', 'training', 'bonding', 'mixed', 'breed', 'dogs', 'unfortunately', 'see', 'chained', 'backyards', 'might', 'show', 'same', 'call', 'duty', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'breed', 'creating', 'connection', '-opening', 'one', 'heart', 'truly', 'letting', 'furry', 'creature', 'Gere', 'lovingly', 'film.I', 'think', 'Hachiko', 'story', 'good', 'reminder', 'ALL', 'dogs', 'have', 'thinking', 'emotive', 'minds', 'are', 'family', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'possessed', 'said', 'Hachi', 'will', 'continue', 'educate', 'grave', 'generations', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'profound', 'legacy.This', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'family', 'film', '-one', 'once', 'watched', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'just', 'have', 'tissues', 'hand']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

After the awful experience I had watching this movie, I went back and read the one-star reviews. I sure wish I'd read them FIRST, because it would have spared me the experience of watching this horrible movie.If you want to spend a solid hour sobbing your face off, this is the movie for you! If you want to see a cute movie about a special relationship between a dog and a human, this movie will just depress you for the rest of the day.SPOILER ALERT: This review contains detailed descriptions of the plot of this movie.It starts out with a classroom scene where kids are discussing their heroes. The first kid is talking about how Christopher Columbus (famous for genocide) is her hero. I should have turned it off right then.Then the little boy starts talking about how Hachi, his grandfather's dog, is his hero. And then we get the story of Hachi.Hachi is a Japanese dog found by a professor (played by Richard Gere) in the United States. The original true story of this dog took place in Japan, but I suppose Hollywood felt white people would be more lucrative as protagonists and so in the movie Hachi goes through a random convoluted journey for the sole purpose of making sure that the story was set in America, where the dog is found by a white guy.Then the dog and the professor bond for awhile. Then the professor dies. We overhear the professor's wife comforting her crying daughter, saying, &#34;It's okay. It's okay.&#34; That was ridiculous. Who tries to tell someone &#34;It's okay&#34; when a family member dies? It's not at all &#34;okay,&#34; and the widow is the last person who'd say it's okay. That line was just an insult to the intelligence of anyone who's ever lost a loved one.So the dog then goes home with the professor's daughter, who basically sets him free because he keeps wanting to go to the train station where he used to await the professor (who never came home, the day he died). Really irresponsible toward that dog who had been her father's dog. Appalling, really.Then we get to watch the dog wait for the professor for more than a decade, until he dies alone in the snow. What's that? You somehow thought the little boy would factor into this? Um, no. For almost the little boy's entire life, the dog has been sitting at the train station alone, while the boy's parents neglect Hachi. The boy and the dog have no relationship.This is a story about grief and pain. You get to watch this poor dog experience terrible grief and longing. It's really upsetting.Then at the end, when the dog finally dies alone in the snow, the professor kind of comes back and escorts the dog to Heaven, I guess is what's supposed to be happening in that brief scene. So if you were hoping all this time for some kind of happy ending, you'll have to be satisfied with that.Pointless, racist, and depressing.",1,Read the One-Star Reviews FIRST,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2924,"['saw', 'high', 'rating', 'film', 'VERY', 'high', 'rating', 'foolishly', 'let', 'be', 'guide', 'awful', 'experience', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'read', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'sure', 'wish', ""'d"", 'read', 'FIRST', 'would', 'have', 'spared', 'experience', 'watching', 'horrible', 'movie.If', 'want', 'spend', 'solid', 'hour', 'sobbing', 'face', 'off', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'cute', 'movie', 'special', 'relationship', 'dog', 'human', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'depress', 'rest', 'day.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'review', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'plot', 'movie.It', 'out', 'classroom', 'scene', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'discussing', 'heroes', 'first', 'kid', 'talking', 'how', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'famous', 'genocide', 'hero', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'right', 'then.Then', 'little', 'boy', 'talking', 'how', 'Hachi', 'grandfather', 'dog', 'hero', 'then', 'get', 'story', 'Hachi.Hachi', 'Japanese', 'dog', 'found', 'professor', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'United', 'States', 'original', 'true', 'story', 'dog', 'took', 'place', 'Japan', 'suppose', 'Hollywood', 'felt', 'white', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'lucrative', 'protagonists', 'so', 'movie', 'Hachi', 'random', 'convoluted', 'journey', 'sole', 'purpose', 'making', 'sure', 'story', 'was', 'set', 'America', 'where', 'dog', 'found', 'white', 'guy.Then', 'dog', 'professor', 'bond', 'awhile', 'Then', 'professor', 'overhear', 'professor', 'wife', 'comforting', 'crying', 'daughter', 'saying', '34', 'okay', 'okay.', '34', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Who', 'tell', 'someone', '34', 'okay', '34', 'when', 'family', 'member', 'dies', 'not', '34', 'okay', '34', 'widow', 'last', 'person', 'who', ""'d"", 'say', 'okay', 'line', 'was', 'just', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'lost', 'loved', 'dog', 'then', 'home', 'professor', 'daughter', 'who', 'basically', 'free', 'wanting', 'go', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'used', 'await', 'professor', 'who', 'never', 'came', 'home', 'day', 'died', 'Really', 'irresponsible', 'dog', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'father', 'dog', 'Appalling', 'really.Then', 'get', 'watch', 'dog', 'wait', 'professor', 'more', 'decade', 'alone', 'snow', 'What', 'somehow', 'thought', 'little', 'boy', 'would', 'factor', 'Um', 'almost', 'little', 'boy', 'entire', 'life', 'dog', 'been', 'sitting', 'train', 'station', 'alone', 'boy', 'parents', 'neglect', 'Hachi', 'boy', 'dog', 'have', 'relationship.This', 'story', 'grief', 'pain', 'get', 'watch', 'poor', 'dog', 'experience', 'terrible', 'grief', 'longing', 'really', 'upsetting.Then', 'end', 'when', 'dog', 'finally', 'alone', 'snow', 'professor', 'kind', 'back', 'dog', 'Heaven', 'guess', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'happening', 'brief', 'scene', 'So', 'were', 'hoping', 'time', 'kind', 'happy', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'satisfied', 'that.Pointless', 'racist', 'depressing']",Hachi: A Dog's Tale

1317663,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0031RAOVY,Tsuyoshi,"[51, 54]","This is a story everyone in Japan knows. Based on the true story of a dog called ""Chuken-Hachiko (meaning ""A loyal dog Hachiko"") that lived in Shibuya, Tokyo, ""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is a moving tale about friendship and loyalty between a man and a dog.In ""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" Richard Gere plays Parker Wilson, a college professor teaching music. One evening Parker finds a lost puppy at the station of fictional east coast town Bedridge, where he lives with his wife Cate (Joan Allen) and daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer). (The film was actually shot in Rhode Island.) No one at the station knows why the puppy is there, so the professor takes the dog home and keeps him. The puppy's name is Hachi, which means ""eight"" in Japanese.Hachi grows up and it becomes his custom to wait for the professor at the station every day at 5 pm. Hachi becomes a fixture of the station and a favorite of the commuters. When they think their happy times last forever, however, something happens, and Hachi has to wait Parker much longer than he used to do.Richard Gere (who also co-produced the film) turns in a solid performance as usual, as a family man who reluctantly takes care of a lost puppy, but the real star of the film is, not surprising, Hachi himself as the faithful dog. Among the supports, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Parker's friend, Jason Alexander as the station master and Erick Avari as a hot dog vendor are memorable, but unfortunately female supports including Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer and Davenia McFadden are a bit wasted in this comparatively short film.""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is an American remake of ""Hachiko monogatari"" (1987) directed by Seijir Kyama. The Japanese film's story is inspired by the true story of an Akita dog Hachiko (1923-35) and the professor of Tokyo Imperial University (today's The University of Tokyo) Hidesabur' Ueno (1871-1925). Those who have visited Tokyo may remember the bronze stature of the dog at JR Shibuya station where Hachi was once seen.Helmed by the director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" ""My Life as a Dog""), the film is a good example of a simple story well told.

1317681,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0031RAOVY,zeus,"[1, 2]","Great movie all around! Based on a true story.The acting is fantastic...as far as the dogs are concerned. I cannot imagine what took to have the dogs play the role of Hachi and go through all the emotions. Some of the work is explained in the extras. Make sure you watch the extras AFTER you watch the movie. Richard Gere is OK but because of his previous roles and his usual mediocre acting (when was the last time that Richard Gere got an award for his acting?) it is hard to imagine him in this role of a dog lover/owner who suddenly carries a ball in his mouth to teach the dog how to fetch. And of course he is a music teacher, not a stock broker from New Jersey or an agricultural scientist like the real owner of Hachi. That is the reason for the four stars. Bruce Willis, Bobby DeNiro or Chuck Norris would be a more credible choice for this type of movie. Especially since it doesn't require much acting since the principal character of the movie is Hachi (the dog). The real Hachi died in 1935 in Japan and his owner, who died from a hemorrhagic stroke in 1925 while lecturing, was an agricultural scientist (not a ...music teacher) at the Imperial University in Tokyo. But of course for a Swedish liberal director/producer who directed all promotional films for the group ABBA, a music teacher is better, more classy(?), and doesn't have dirt on his hands. And of course he is playing the piano! That is exactly why Richard Gere was a poor choice. Don't you hate when liberal directors (mostly from Hollywood) take the freedom to change a true story? This is NOT fiction people, it should be left as is!Simple story, very complicated emotions. A professor adopts a puppy in spite of the complaining of his wife (I think his wife is not represented well by Joan Allen who is quite cold and emotionless throughout the movie). It happens to be a very smart dog that has a huge bonding with his owner and waits for him every day at the train station. When the owner dies suddenly, it keeps coming back at the train station every day for nine years to wait for him. The last third part of the movie (the better part of the movie less people more Hachi) follows the dog's life after the owner dies.Very well done and you will definitely get emotional because of the behavior of Hachi. As a dog lover/owner myself I can tell you that a dog is by far worth any human friend you can have.
