1544715,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0082CE6XK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[5, 5]","We are making our way through the gauntlet. We have gone from funny pregnant teenager to funny new born mom. Kim (Krysten Ritter) and Deena (Kate Bosworth) are liberated college women. The next thing we know Kim has a son Max. The pair share a house with Laura (Rachel Bilson) who is proud of her virginity, but accepts jobs that pay well which make you question it. She was a great character for what little time she was on the screen.Marc (Rhys Coiro) the father of the child is also a surfer which allows him to leave the picture. The film works on the theme that having a baby is a ""buzz kill."" It is worse than the plague. In an early scene they drove the point home so much, it managed to bring the film down to where I didn't think it could recover to be a comedy again. Kristen Johnston plays Kim's flaky boss who is far from understanding.When Kim meets Nicholas (Geoff Stults) they have an attraction for each other. Kim lies to Nicholas about the baby, claiming it is Deena's, which later resulted in a funny barbed filled double date, the comedy highlight of the film. The plot is predictable and I don't think it would have worked any other way.Krysten Ritter looked exceedingly pale in this film, as a new born mom, i.e. a mom that just dropped the kid an hour ago. She kept that look for much of the film, perhaps to drive home the point. Justin Kirk plays an educated perv friend of Nicholas. He had a funny character that should have been used more. The film has some laughs and is a worth while date night rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex? no nudity.",4,IS THAT A BABY ON YOUR BACK?,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,1570,"['are', 'making', 'way', 'gauntlet', 'have', 'gone', 'funny', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'funny', 'new', 'born', 'mom', 'Kim', 'Krysten', 'Ritter', 'Deena', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'are', 'liberated', 'college', 'women', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Kim', 'son', 'Max', 'pair', 'share', 'house', 'Laura', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'who', 'proud', 'virginity', 'jobs', 'pay', 'well', 'make', 'question', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'was', 'screen.Marc', 'Rhys', 'Coiro', 'father', 'child', 'also', 'surfer', 'leave', 'picture', 'film', 'theme', 'having', 'baby', 'buzz', 'kill', 'worse', 'plague', 'early', 'scene', 'drove', 'point', 'home', 'so', 'much', 'managed', 'bring', 'film', 'down', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'recover', 'be', 'comedy', 'again', 'Kristen', 'Johnston', 'Kim', 'flaky', 'boss', 'who', 'far', 'understanding.When', 'Kim', 'meets', 'Nicholas', 'Geoff', 'Stults', 'have', 'attraction', 'other', 'Kim', 'Nicholas', 'baby', 'claiming', 'Deena', 'later', 'resulted', 'funny', 'barbed', 'filled', 'double', 'date', 'comedy', 'highlight', 'film', 'plot', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'other', 'way.Krysten', 'Ritter', 'looked', 'exceedingly', 'pale', 'film', 'new', 'born', 'mom', 'i.e', 'mom', 'just', 'dropped', 'kid', 'hour', 'ago', 'kept', 'look', 'much', 'film', 'perhaps', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'educated', 'perv', 'friend', 'Nicholas', 'had', 'funny', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'film', 'laughs', 'worth', 'date', 'night', 'rental.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity']",Life Happens

Kim (Ritter) and Deena (Bosworth) are best friends. They do everything together. One night when both bring home a guy they discover a problem. One year later they are still best friends but now Kim has a baby. Trying to balance work, friends and her love life all around being a single mother turns out to be harder then she expects. This is a very funny movie that is almost done like an Apatow movie. The dialog is very witty and hilarious and keeps you laughing throughout. The beginning of the movie made me feel (as a parent) a little annoyed at Kim. It felt like she considered the baby a burden and that she didn't really want him. Her feelings did change but that part did bug me a little. Other then that and the movie being a little predictable this was very very funny and I recommend this. You will not be disappointed. I do have to say that this is more on the ""chick-flick"" side of comedies this will appeal to both men and women. I laughed all the way through. Overall, if you like the Apatow movies you will like this one too. I give it a B+.",4,A very very funny movie that is a lot like an Apatow movie. A little chick-flicky but men will like too. I did.
