1270970,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B002IW8V1S,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 1]","Mike Epps had me concerned at the beginning of the movie. I think he's pretty funny in movies, but a relative told me his stand-up was terrible. He said Mike got to the point where he'd mumble, ""That wasn't funny"" and try again. I was surprised by his opinion because I couldn't believe I wouldn't like Mike in stand-up. Then I watched the beginning of this DVD. He used the b-word and the n-word more times than the entire hip-hop community for 2011. At some points I was thinking, ""Okay, take a break. Call them something else."" But every time he got the crowd to laugh, he'd repeat the same joke two or three times (ex. the leg kick). I was ready to turn the DVD off, but when he got to politics and Obama, the DVD started to pick up the pace. It took me far too long to laugh, but when he got to politics, I smiled. From then on, it was pretty good. Mike Epps is funny, but some of his vocabulary can be so disrespectful that it distracts you from the punchline. Ironically the funniest part of the DVD was not the stand-up; it was him going through Detroit to meet the people. I watched them and the smile never left my face. Watching this DVD confirms that I'd never pay to see him perform live, but I'll definitely continue to watch movies he's in.",3,Started off rough but had some good moments,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,1255,"['Mike', 'Epps', 'had', 'concerned', 'beginning', 'movie', 'think', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movies', 'relative', 'told', 'stand-up', 'was', 'terrible', 'said', 'Mike', 'got', 'point', 'where', ""'d"", 'mumble', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'try', 'again', 'was', 'surprised', 'opinion', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mike', 'stand-up', 'Then', 'watched', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'used', 'b-word', 'n-word', 'more', 'times', 'entire', 'hip-hop', 'community', '2011', 'points', 'was', 'thinking', 'Okay', 'take', 'break', 'Call', 'something', 'else', 'time', 'got', 'crowd', 'laugh', ""'d"", 'repeat', 'same', 'joke', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'ex', 'leg', 'kick', 'was', 'ready', 'turn', 'DVD', 'off', 'when', 'got', 'politics', 'Obama', 'DVD', 'started', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'took', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'laugh', 'when', 'got', 'politics', 'smiled', 'then', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'funny', 'vocabulary', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'disrespectful', 'punchline', 'Ironically', 'funniest', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'stand-up', 'was', 'going', 'Detroit', 'meet', 'people', 'watched', 'smile', 'never', 'left', 'face', 'Watching', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'never', 'pay', 'see', 'perform', 'live', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'continue', 'watch', 'movies']",Mike Epps: Under Rated & Never Faded
