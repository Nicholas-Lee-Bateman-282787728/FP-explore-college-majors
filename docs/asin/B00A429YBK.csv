1605571,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00A429YBK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","THE HAUNTING HOUR: THE SERIES is similar to R.L. Stine's mid-1990's series, GOOSEBUMPS. However, THE HAUNTING HOUR is darker in both tone and content and the production values are usually notches above those of GOOSEBUMPS. THE HAUNTING HOUR Volume 3 contains five episodes from the series. Each episode is about 22 minutes in length, including the show intro and the credits. The episodes are:""Fear Never Knocks"" - While their grandfather (Matthew Walker) is out receiving an award for his work in psychiatry, his grandchildren, Jenny (Ariel Winter from MODERN FAMILY) and Jack (Quinn Lord)  sneak into his office and pretend to be psychiatrists themselves. However, when they start using their grandfather's recorder, they discover that the device actually takes people's fears and stores them inside. It's a type of Pandora's box that will cause nothing but trouble if it falls into the wrong hands.""Best Friend Forever"" - Jack is a science geek who really wants a dog for a pet. While conducting a science experiment with electricity in the ground with some worms, Jack raises a zombie from the grave. Instead of seeking help, Jack keeps the zombie as a pet and tries to keep it from eating his mom and friends.""Black Mask"" - a group of friends sneak into the house of an eccentric collector who has recently died and discover a black mask that appears to show them the past. They feel attached to the children they seem through the mask and attempt to send a note to them to prevent a tragedy from having.""My Sister the Witch"" - Pete is excited to spend some time with his teenage sister Alice when she arrives home from boarding school for a visit. However, the reunion isn't what Pete expects and Alice starts acting strange. He and his friend Reggie soon believe that Alice might now be a witch.""Catching Cold"" - One day Marty hears the haunting melody of an ice cream truck. He attempts to catch the truck to buy some ice cream, but to no avail. However, no one else saw or heard the truck. When the mailman tells Marty and his friend about a boy named Jimmy Jeffries who said he heard and seen the same truck, it strengthens Marty's resolve to catch the truck and get him some Kreemy Kold ice cream. But there's something very strange about the truck.It's quite easy to watch R.L. STINE'S THE HAUNTING HOUR: THE SERIES, VOL. 3. The acting is rather good for a half-hour tv show aimed at older children. The production values are much better than GOOSEBUMPS; the cheap rubber masks that were often used in GOOSEBUMPS are gone and replaced by much more realistic and life-like make-up. However, this is still a lower budget tv show, so the shows do tend to skimp a little on expensive props, plenty of extra actors, and fancy sets.Personally, I found ""Catching Cold"" to be the most unusual and frightening episode of this collection. The episode is actually based upon a short story by Neal Shusterman and can be found in his bookDarkness Creeping: Twenty Twisted Tales.The extras on the DVD are some original promos and a ""Behind the Screams"" of a few of the episodes.",4,"Facing Your Fears, Raising Zombies, and More",1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,3076,"['HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'similar', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'mid-1990', 'series', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'However', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'darker', 'tone', 'content', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'usually', 'notches', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'Volume', '3', 'contains', 'five', 'episodes', 'series', 'episode', '22', 'minutes', 'length', 'including', 'show', 'intro', 'credits', 'episodes', 'are', 'Fear', 'Never', 'Knocks', 'grandfather', 'Matthew', 'Walker', 'out', 'receiving', 'award', 'work', 'psychiatry', 'grandchildren', 'Jenny', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'MODERN', 'FAMILY', 'Jack', 'Quinn', 'Lord', 'sneak', 'office', 'pretend', 'be', 'psychiatrists', 'However', 'when', 'start', 'using', 'grandfather', 'recorder', 'discover', 'device', 'actually', 'people', 'fears', 'stores', 'inside', 'type', 'Pandora', 'box', 'will', 'cause', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Forever', 'Jack', 'science', 'geek', 'who', 'really', 'dog', 'pet', 'conducting', 'science', 'experiment', 'electricity', 'ground', 'worms', 'Jack', 'zombie', 'grave', 'Instead', 'seeking', 'help', 'Jack', 'zombie', 'pet', 'tries', 'keep', 'eating', 'mom', 'friends', 'Black', 'Mask', 'group', 'friends', 'sneak', 'house', 'eccentric', 'collector', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'discover', 'black', 'mask', 'show', 'past', 'feel', 'attached', 'children', 'seem', 'mask', 'attempt', 'send', 'note', 'prevent', 'tragedy', 'having', 'Sister', 'Witch', 'Pete', 'excited', 'spend', 'time', 'teenage', 'sister', 'Alice', 'when', 'home', 'boarding', 'school', 'visit', 'However', 'reunion', ""n't"", 'what', 'Pete', 'Alice', 'acting', 'strange', 'friend', 'Reggie', 'soon', 'believe', 'Alice', 'might', 'now', 'be', 'witch', 'Catching', 'Cold', 'One', 'day', 'Marty', 'haunting', 'melody', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'catch', 'truck', 'buy', 'ice', 'cream', 'avail', 'However', 'one', 'else', 'saw', 'heard', 'truck', 'When', 'mailman', 'Marty', 'friend', 'boy', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'Jeffries', 'who', 'said', 'heard', 'seen', 'same', 'truck', 'Marty', 'resolve', 'catch', 'truck', 'get', 'Kreemy', 'Kold', 'ice', 'cream', 'something', 'very', 'strange', 'truck.It', 'quite', 'easy', 'watch', 'R.L', 'STINE', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'VOL', '3', 'acting', 'rather', 'good', 'half-hour', 'tv', 'show', 'aimed', 'older', 'children', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'cheap', 'rubber', 'masks', 'were', 'often', 'used', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'are', 'gone', 'replaced', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'life-like', 'make-up', 'However', 'still', 'lower', 'budget', 'tv', 'show', 'shows', 'do', 'tend', 'skimp', 'little', 'expensive', 'props', 'plenty', 'extra', 'actors', 'fancy', 'sets.Personally', 'found', 'Catching', 'Cold', 'be', 'most', 'unusual', 'frightening', 'episode', 'collection', 'episode', 'actually', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Neal', 'Shusterman', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bookDarkness', 'Creeping', 'Twenty', 'Twisted', 'Tales.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'original', 'promos', 'Screams', 'few', 'episodes']",N/A
1605572,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00A429YBK,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","This series will appeal to children who enjoyed reading R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series of books, and have an appreciation for spooky stories. My eight-year-old who has read most of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series of books has recently discovered The Haunting Hour TV series and I've been checking out the DVDs from the public library. The stories are surprisingly well-made though allowances need to be made for a high cheese quotient :-) There are five episodes on this DVD:Fear Never KnocksThe grandchildren of a renowned psychiatrist accidentally unleash Fear when they play with an antique recorder in their grandfather's office. This was an interesting take on the Pandora myth.Best Friends ForeverJack (Nolan Gould) is a geeky kid who yearns for a pet dog but when he inadvertently awakens the corpse of a man at a cemetery, he decides to make it his pet. As with the other stories in this series, there's always an element of twist and in this instance, things take a turn for the worse.Black MaskWhen two children Julie (Madison Pettis) and Bill (Ricardo Hoyos) discover a mask, they discover it holds a dark secret. But they discover that what they thought the mask revealed was something different entirely.My Sister the WitchBoy scout Pete (Uriah Shelton) is at home with his good friend Reggie when his sister Alice (Jodelle Ferland) returns from boarding school. The boys think Alice is a witch, but she is actually the victim of a curse and must do battle with the forces of evil in order to be saved. Both my daughter and I enjoyed the ending where the villain gets his just desserts.Catching ColdDiary of a Wimpy Kid's Robert Capron plays Marty, a kid who gets obsessed with tracking down an elusive ice cream truck that magically appears and disappears in his neighborhood. Even Marty's good friend refuses to believe in the existence of the ice cream truck. Later, Marty finds out that there used to be another kid in his neighborhood who was similarly obsessed only to mysteriously disappear one day. When Marty eventually gets into the ice cream truck, he discovers that it was perhaps better not to have developed a taste for the Kreamy Kold treat, after all.In addition there are two bonus features, i.e. A Look Behind the Screams and Original Promos. The total running time is approx. 132 minutes in full color.",5,My eight-year-old daughter enjoys this show immensely!,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2333,"['series', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'books', 'have', 'appreciation', 'spooky', 'stories', 'eight-year-old', 'who', 'read', 'most', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'books', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'checking', 'DVDs', 'public', 'library', 'stories', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well-made', 'allowances', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'high', 'cheese', 'quotient', 'are', 'five', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Fear', 'KnocksThe', 'grandchildren', 'renowned', 'psychiatrist', 'accidentally', 'unleash', 'Fear', 'when', 'play', 'antique', 'recorder', 'grandfather', 'office', 'was', 'interesting', 'take', 'Pandora', 'myth.Best', 'Friends', 'ForeverJack', 'Nolan', 'Gould', 'geeky', 'kid', 'who', 'pet', 'dog', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'corpse', 'man', 'cemetery', 'make', 'pet', 'other', 'stories', 'series', 'always', 'element', 'twist', 'instance', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse.Black', 'MaskWhen', 'two', 'children', 'Julie', 'Madison', 'Pettis', 'Bill', 'Ricardo', 'Hoyos', 'mask', 'discover', 'dark', 'secret', 'discover', 'what', 'thought', 'mask', 'revealed', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'entirely.My', 'Sister', 'WitchBoy', 'scout', 'Pete', 'Uriah', 'Shelton', 'home', 'good', 'friend', 'Reggie', 'when', 'sister', 'Alice', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'boarding', 'school', 'boys', 'think', 'Alice', 'witch', 'actually', 'victim', 'curse', 'must', 'do', 'battle', 'forces', 'evil', 'order', 'be', 'saved', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'where', 'villain', 'just', 'desserts.Catching', 'ColdDiary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'Marty', 'kid', 'who', 'obsessed', 'tracking', 'down', 'elusive', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'magically', 'neighborhood', 'Even', 'Marty', 'good', 'friend', 'believe', 'existence', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'Later', 'Marty', 'out', 'there', 'used', 'be', 'kid', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'was', 'similarly', 'obsessed', 'only', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'one', 'day', 'When', 'Marty', 'eventually', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'was', 'perhaps', 'better', 'not', 'have', 'developed', 'taste', 'Kreamy', 'Kold', 'treat', 'all.In', 'addition', 'are', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'i.e', 'Look', 'Screams', 'Original', 'Promos', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'approx', '132', 'minutes', 'full', 'color']",N/A
