1455206,AZW0WZUDE365,B005DDN51A,"Arun Singh ""arun singh""","[54, 54]","This is a very endearing and lovable series which is all about funny things that happen in Ma and Pa Kettle's home and all the mischiefs that their fifteen offspring's are up to.The series started with The Egg and I (1947) starring my favourite actress Claudette Colbert.Her Husband  Fred MacMurray buys a property in the suburbs which actually is a village with the idea of setting up a Egg Farm and earning profit from it.But all his efforts fall apart as one misfortune after another follows and Claudette Colbert's patience is umpteenth time tested.Ma and Pa Kettle are their neighbour played by MARJORIE MAIN and PERCY KILBRIDE.After this movie Ma and Pa Kettle series started which continued for 9 more movies which still delight audience with their riotous humour and crazy antics.Marjorie Main is tall heavy built and powerful,she is the brainy and decisive one.Percy Kilbride is thin unassuming,lazy and speaks in dragging voice.Their are two Red Indians too who work on their farm.Most remarkable is the dinner time when Ma shouts ""come and get it"" and all fifteen kids rush in to the dinner table.There's a old radio which change channels whenever Pa jumps on his rocking chair.Then there are those hens who keep laying eggs in unimaginable places especially in guest's hats.Once they are shown in a really modern house with all kinds of innovative gadgets beating even those new James Bond movies.They keep taking part in various contests and keep winning strange prizes.Once a convict hoodwinks them to stay in the house and look after children while they are gone.But kids prove to be too much for him.A bit of TinTin like adventure here too when a guy a asks Pa to deliver an envelope to himself in Paris but gets killed on arrival in his hotel room.Pa and Ma with their sensible friend manage to outsmart crooks.Marjorie Main was famous for talking on the set to her dead husband! In some cases, they'd have to re-shoot scenes because she'd just start having conversations with him out of the blue!

1455223,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B005DDN51A,D. Fowler,"[23, 24]","Many people have fond memories of Ma and Pa Kettle, a wonderfully hick, but somehow hip comedy team.  Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa, (Percy Kilbride) were laid back parents of fifteen youngsters.  In 1947 they co-starred with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray in ""The Egg and I,"" the first film in this series.  Their outlandish personalities drew in an audience that launched their careers.  In this particular set there are two movies on each DVD.  If you are old enough to have actually seen them at the movies when you were a kid you'll love seeing them as much as those who saw the reruns every now and then in future decades.My only disappointment was when Parker Fennelly was cast as Pa in ""The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm.""  No doubt his performance was stellar, but the ""real"" Pa was inimitable and somehow irreplaceable.  Regardless, this madcap post Vaudevillian comedy series is great entertainment and I enjoyed going back in time to watch the unforgettable team of Ma and Pa Kettle.THE MOVIES:(1) The Egg and I (1 hr. 48 minutes, 1947)Two newly weds, Betty (Claudette Colbert) and Bob (Fred MacMurray) try their hand at chicken farming.  This is the first time Ma and Pa Kettle are seen on the screen.(2) Ma and Pa Kettle (1 hr. 16 minutes, 1949)The Kettles, who live in a dilapidated farmhouse, end up living in a futuristic home when Pa wins the King Henry Tobacco Company slogan contest.(3)  Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1 hr. 20 minutes, 1950)Pa simple doesn't settle for winning the ""house-of-the-future,"" he decides to enter another contest held by the Bubble-Ola company.  An all expenses paid trip to New York City is on the agenda, but who will take care of the kids?(4)  Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm ( 1 hr., 21 minutes, 1951)Once Ma and Pa get back from New York they find there will be a new addition to the family.  Just who is going to have a new baby?  It's not Ma, but when they have Boston blue blood come to visit, all heck breaks loose.(5)  Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1 hr. 19 minutes, 1952)Rosie has to go to college, but somehow Ma and Pa Kettle have to come up with the money.  Ma is going to enter some contests at the fair trying to beat out the old bat, Birdie Hicks.  Pa buys an old nag pawned off to him as a race horse.  Who was going to bring home enough money to pay Rosie's college tuition?(6) Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation (1 hr., 16 minutes, 1953)Ma and Pa Kettle are heading to Paris with their in-laws, Jonathan and Elizabeth Parker (Ray Collins and Barbara Brown).  On the way to Paris a shady character asks Pa to carry an envelope for him and give it back to them at the hotel.  A bit of murder and mayhem await the Kettles in Paris!(7)  Ma and Pa Kettle at Home (1 hr., 22 minutes, 1954)Ma and Pa's son Elwin (Brett Halsey) writes an essay about their thoroughly modern farm in order to win a scholarship from a national magazine.  What's going to happen when the judges come and find out the place is a dump?(8)  Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1 hr., 19 minutes, 1955)Cousin Rodney Kettle lives in Waikiki and is having business trouble on his pineapple plantation.  The only one who can possibly save the business is his cousin, Pa Kettle.  (This is the last episode for Percy Kilbride as he became ill during the filming).(9)  The Kettles in the Ozarks (1 hr. 21 minutes, 1956)Ma and the kids head out to help Pa's brother, Sedgewick, who isn't a much better farmer than Pa.  He also has that ""don't wanna work"" attitude and when some shady characters want to rent his barn he's all for it.  Just what are they up to?(10)  The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm (1 hr., 21 minutes, 1957)Ma and Pa (Parker Fennelly) Sally and Brad when they get married.  Sally, who has no idea how difficult farm life can be, is in for one big surprise when everything seems to go wrong.",5,"""Howdy!""

She took me with her to see it when I was only 3 or 4 years old. I don't remember the movie, but my mother always said it was one of the funniest movies she had seen. Thus, 67 years later, I bought this set of the Kettle movies, just to get The Egg and I. Great movie, still, with Fred MacMurray and Claudett Cobert. And, t is hilarious in places, but it is also a good romance.

1455227,A1NPV2WWC90SWQ,B005DDN51A,forrie lowell,"[122, 123]","In 1946 Author Betty MacDonald wrote a Best Seller ""The Egg and I"".  In 1947 Universal Pictures made it into one of the most popular movies starring Oscar Winner Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurray as a newly wed city folk gone country chicken farmers.  And Majorie Main & Percy Kilbride as; ""MA & PA KETTLE"" the mad cap country neighbors with 15 kids.  ""The Egg and I"" and the Kettles were so popular that Universal Pictures made a sequel starring the ""Kettles"" in ""The Further Adventures of Ma Aand Pa Kettle"" IN 1949. Again so successful were the Kettles 9 more hilarious films followed. Main & Kilbride were the perfect team & the first Beverly Hillbilly type comedies.All 10 films on 5 disks are Standard Format and in Black & White remastered pisture and sound (Excellent quality even on a blu-ray player).The original release of the series was released on DVD in 2004 in 2 volumes with 4 films per set.  NOTE: the last 2 films; The Kettles  in the Ozarks and The Kettles on Old MacDonalds Farm weren't included in the original since Percy Kilbride (due to illness he was absent from them). (Kettles vs Ma & Pa).Summary: Disk 1 ""The Egg and I""* - (1947) has newly weds Bob & Betty MacDonald (Colbert & MacMurray) giving up the city life for the life of chicken farmers ""EGGS"" in the state of Washington.  Their 40 acre run down farm becomes the a real challenge along with their scatterbrained/madcap nighbors the destitute Kettle clan (with 15 kids).This is an Outstanding story, perfect ensemble cast with hilarious results. The perfect launch title for the ""Kettles"". Next came; ""MA & PA Kettle"" (1949) - The procrastinating PA's (Kilbride) obsession to enter contests proves to be a winner. The fun really begins now, the Grand prize is a new hi-tech style house of the future.  Disk 2 ""Ma & Pa Kettle Go to Town""* (1950) - Pa wins another contest. A trip to New York City.  Who will babysit their 15 helluns so they can go?  ""Ma & Pa Kettle Back on the Farm"" (1951) - Ma & Pa are to become Grandparents and the rich high society in-laws are coming to stay with the Kettles to visit their Grand Son.  Disk 3 ""Ma & Pa Kettle At the Fair""* (1952) - Pa enters a harness race.  ""Ma & Pa Kettle On Vacation""* (1953) - The Kettles in Paris, France involved with espionage & Spies.  Disk 4 ""Ma & Pa Kettle At Home"" (1954) - The House of the future is needing repairs from neglect.  ""Ma & Pa Kettle At Waikiki""* (1955) - Pa cons a visit to rich cousin Pineapple plantation. (Kilbrides last appearance as Pa due to illness).  Disk 5 These last 2 films are finally added to complete the Kettles Series Collection.  ""The Kettles in the Ozarks"" (1955) - Ma and the kids visit relatives in the Ozarks.  ""The Kettles on Old MacDonalds Farm"" (1957) - This is the last film and Parker Fennelly plays PA KETTLE. This is kind of an appropiate conclusion to this series since Bob & Betty MacDonald (from ""The Egg and I"") was the introduction of the Kettle clan and now we say good bye.  * Includes Theatrical Trailer.This Complete Collection is loaded with pure fun and laughter.  Allows us to revisit the comedies of the 1940's & 50's and see how the simplest situations creates the gift of laughter..  A must have family fun time!!!!
