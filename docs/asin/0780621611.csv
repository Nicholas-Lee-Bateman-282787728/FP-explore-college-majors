30338,A30AO422P01XK0,0780621611,,"[0, 7]","The main value I found in this quirky but well-cast movie was the insight it offers into psychotherapy with a delusional person.  The therapist, played by Brando, showed compassion, commitment, vulnerability, and open-mindedness, which is exactly what it takes to do this kind of work.  (I'll address his flaws later.)  But what made the movie most realistic for me - I am a therapist - is the feeling of frustration I experienced at never really knowing what was and wasn't reality in the life of Johnny Depp's character.  Although the movie used this as a tease, which was annoying, it nevertheless captured just how difficult and confusing it can be to engage with a delusional person.  It can leave the best therapist scratching his head, especially when (as in the case of Depp's character) some of the delusional material IS reality-based!The movie also captures - however simplistically - the hyper-medication focus of the modern mental health field.  They want to put anyone who doesn't fit into the box on drugs.  On the flip side, this movie has a fanciful idea of just how much therapy psychotic people get nowadays, even when they're trapped inpatient.  Forget hour-long individual sessions five days a week:  in reality try little or none in a whole year!  Most therapists (like the clueless therapist ""Bill"" in the movie) have no idea where to start with psychotic patients; thus they drug them.A few final points:1) One of the basic themes of the movie involves the patient emotionally rescuing the lost therapist - and restoring value to his life.  This backward fantasy is based on the not uncommon idea of the child giving value to the life of his lost parent.  If a therapist leans on the patient to the degree Brando's character did (especially at the end of the movie), it is malpractice.2) Although the movie portrays Johnny Depp's character as a master of romantic love, he comes across more as a compulsive sex addict.

Marlon Brando, who you need subtitles for just to understand him? I don't think so! The storyline is a pile of nonsense, especially when 'Don Juan' is actually in the mental hospital.

30348,A27A3AZA7L12N6,0780621611,,"[1, 3]","Here's a light, charming little romantic comedy-fantasy from Frances Ford Coppola.  A young man (played by Johnny Depp), who says his name is Don Juan Demarco is suffering from delusions that he is Don Juan, the greatest lover in history.  With this confident belief in his identity, his looks and his costumes, he successfully seduces every woman he applies his charms to.  He eventually gets committed to a mental hospital as a result of a suicide attempt (because his honor was disgraced).Marlon Brando plays the psychiatrist  assigned to his case.  He is the best clinician the hospital has ever had.  Don Juan thinks Marlon Brando is Don Octavio de Flores, a Spanish nobleman from the same era as the original Don Juan.  Marlon Brando plays a very open, warm-fuzzy character, very different from any other role I've seen him in.  He is 10 days from retirement.  This will be his last patient.Marlon is intrigued and charmed by the Don Juan's fantasy world and wants to explore it.  Marlon's boss, the head of the hospital wants Don Juan put on medication right away.  Marlon refuses because he's enjoying the Don Juan's fantasies too much.  In their sessions Don Juan talks about his life, all of which is an elaborate fantasy, but all the while he is preaching the romance of seduction, honor and the beauty of women to Marlon.Don Juan has a Don Quixote like effect on most every one around him.  The female nurses fall all over him.  Best of all, Marlon Brando adopts Don Juan's philosophy and starts, ""Don Juaning,"" his wife, played by Faye Dunaway.  This is all quite a surprise to her.  Their long-cold relationship comes alive.  He takes her to romantic dinners, buys her diamond earrings, buys flowers, and on and on.  He tells his wife of 32 years that he wants to her to know her!  He says he wants to know what she was thinking and feeling all those years he was thinking about himself.  She laughs.  She says she thought he'd never ask.  Marlon Brando starts to consider that Don Juan Demarco is the real Don Juan.It is hinted that if Don Juan is put on medication, he will end up staying in the hospital for the rest of his life.  Marlon Brando confidently feels he will have him out in 10 days.  Marlon only gives him his medicine right before he has to go before the judge who will decide his fate.  Brought back to reality before the judge, by the drug he comes across as close enough to normal, and the judge releases him, to Marlon's pleasure and the militant disapproval of the head of the hospital.As Don Juan is being released, Marlo Brando announces to himself, in his mind,  ""I am Don Octavio de Flores the world's greatest psychiatrist!  I have cured 1,000 patients.""All three fly to the Greek island of Eros for a vacation.  In his mind, to the viewer, he announces, ""Yes, Don Juan was incurable.  He was infected with incurable Romanticism and, and it is very contagious.""

30356,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,0780621611,Andre Dursin,"[4, 4]","Though not a big box-office success, the enchanting, fanciful romantic-comedy DON JUAN DeMARCO has always been a personal favorite of mine. Writer-director Jeremy Leven's film offers Johnny Depp in one of his most satisfying performances as a young psychiatric patient who believes himself to be the great lover - and Marlon Brando as the veteran shrink who watches and he and his staff are touched by the unlikely ""Don Juan""'s charms.Produced by Francis Ford Coppola, ""Don Juan DeMarco"" is a particularly interesting film as it falls between two different cinematic eras: Brando, who at least seems more alive here than he did in most of his late-career appearances, and Depp - on the verge of genuine ""super-stardom"" after several years essaying mostly character-driven parts in ""Ed Wood"" and ""Gilbert Grape"" - who shows a glimmer of the Jack Sparrow-esque leading man he'd eventually become as the charismatic, contemporary Don Juan.Leven's original story is funny and endearing - a bona-fide romantic souffle of a film - with a gorgeous, Latin-flavored, melodic Michael Kamen score that's one of the late composer's finest works. Even the requisite pop song Kamen wrote with long-time collaborator R.J. ""Mutt"" Lange, ""Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman,"" is a good one, offering another `90s hit single for crooner Bryan Adams. With Ralf Bode's cinematography and a bevy of lovely ladies (Talisa Soto, Rachel Ticotin, Geraldine Pailhas among them) supporting Depp, Brando and Faye Dunaway (as Brando's long-suffering wife), ""Don Juan DeMarco"" is a thoroughly delightful, winning film that makes its long overdue debut in high-definition this week.Warner's Blu-Ray does not disappoint either, thanks to a clear, crisp 1080p HD transfer that enhances the picture's gorgeous use of primary colors while resisting the temptation to cover the material with DNR. The original trailer and Adams' music video comprise a supplemental section that also houses a treat: Kamen's original isolated score, a carry-over from the old DVD release and a testament to the composer's legacy of writing some of the downright joyous music the medium had ever seen, when coupled with the proper project.",5,Don Juan DeMarco on Blu-Ray,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2184,"['not', 'big', 'box-office', 'success', 'enchanting', 'fanciful', 'romantic-comedy', 'DON', 'JUAN', 'DeMARCO', 'always', 'been', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Writer-director', 'Jeremy', 'Leven', 'film', 'offers', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'performances', 'young', 'psychiatric', 'patient', 'who', 'be', 'great', 'lover', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'veteran', 'shrink', 'who', 'staff', 'are', 'touched', 'unlikely', 'Don', 'Juan', 'charms.Produced', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Don', 'Juan', 'DeMarco', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'film', 'two', 'different', 'cinematic', 'eras', 'Brando', 'who', 'least', 'more', 'alive', 'here', 'did', 'most', 'late-career', 'appearances', 'Depp', 'verge', 'genuine', 'super-stardom', 'several', 'years', 'essaying', 'mostly', 'character-driven', 'parts', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'who', 'glimmer', 'Jack', 'Sparrow-esque', 'leading', 'man', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'become', 'charismatic', 'contemporary', 'Don', 'Juan.Leven', 'original', 'story', 'funny', 'endearing', 'bona-fide', 'romantic', 'souffle', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'Latin-flavored', 'melodic', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'score', 'one', 'late', 'composer', 'finest', 'works', 'Even', 'requisite', 'pop', 'song', 'Kamen', 'wrote', 'long-time', 'collaborator', 'R.J.', 'Mutt', 'Lange', 'Have', 'Ever', 'Really', 'Loved', 'Woman', 'good', 'one', 'offering', '90s', 'hit', 'single', 'crooner', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'Ralf', 'Bode', 'cinematography', 'bevy', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'Geraldine', 'Pailhas', 'supporting', 'Depp', 'Brando', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Brando', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Don', 'Juan', 'DeMarco', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'winning', 'film', 'long', 'overdue', 'debut', 'high-definition', 'week.Warner', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'disappoint', 'either', 'thanks', 'clear', 'crisp', '1080p', 'HD', 'transfer', 'picture', 'gorgeous', 'use', 'primary', 'colors', 'resisting', 'temptation', 'cover', 'material', 'DNR', 'original', 'trailer', 'Adams', 'music', 'video', 'comprise', 'supplemental', 'section', 'also', 'houses', 'treat', 'Kamen', 'original', 'isolated', 'score', 'carry-over', 'old', 'DVD', 'release', 'testament', 'composer', 'legacy', 'writing', 'downright', 'joyous', 'music', 'medium', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'when', 'coupled', 'proper', 'project']",N/A

Without their massive talents, this movie very well may not have made it onto video.The movie revolves around a 21 year old man (Johnny Depp) who swears that he is the Don Juan from Byron's poem, having loved 1052 women and satisfied every last one of them. Of course, the only one who mattered rejected him, so he has decided to commit suicide. Phyciatrist Jack Michler (Brando) arrived on the scene to talk Don Juan off of the ledge is his on by pretending he is Don Octavio. Don Juan is brought to a menaal hospital where Michler has 10 days, due to the fact that he is retiring and must make a prognosis by then, to decided whether he believes Don Juan's story or not. The rest of the movie is split between Don Juan telling Dr. Michler the story of his life and Michler rekindling the romance with his wife, Marilyn (Dunaway)-due to the fact that Don Juan's romanicism is highly contageous.Although the styoryline is nothing special, and the script is even less, the performances turned out by each lead is superb. Depp as the world's greatest lover is sweet and sentimental, looking and sounding (he is said to have fashioned his accent after Ricardo Montabond in &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;) the part to perfection. Dunaway, although given a comparably smaller part than the others, gets everything she possibly can out of her screentime. The physical chemistry bwtween she and Brando is surprisingly great, as you really can believe they have been married for 30-someodd years. The real gem in this movie, however, is the great one himself. This performance is Brando at his best. He doesn't mugg through the movie (as with the Score) and he isn't off the walls eccentric (The Island of Dr. Moreau). His blue eyes have that boyish, mischevious twinkle they did so many years ago, and alhtough he is quite heavy, he does a good deal of moving around and full body shots compared to all other recent film appearances. No matter what his physical appearance is, Brando's facial exressions, subtle mannerisms and gestures, and most of all his humanity add so much to this mediocre film.When you take 3 very talented entertainers and let them loose on an iffy script, Don Juan DeMarco is the end result. Bottom line, the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun playing off of one another (look for Brando and Dunaway's bed scenes for some great laughs and obvious improvisation)and anyone who enjoys any of the 3 leads should deffinatly see this film!!",3,The power of star power,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2640,"['weak', 'script', 'often', 'flat', 'boring', 'storyline', 'movie', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'due', 'solely', 'performances', '3', 'leads', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'massive', 'talents', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'video.The', 'movie', '21', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Byron', 'poem', 'having', 'loved', '1052', 'women', 'satisfied', 'last', 'one', 'course', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'mattered', 'rejected', 'so', 'decided', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Phyciatrist', 'Jack', 'Michler', 'Brando', 'arrived', 'scene', 'talk', 'Don', 'Juan', 'ledge', 'pretending', 'Don', 'Octavio', 'Don', 'Juan', 'brought', 'menaal', 'hospital', 'where', 'Michler', '10', 'days', 'due', 'fact', 'retiring', 'must', 'make', 'prognosis', 'then', 'decided', 'Don', 'Juan', 'story', 'not', 'rest', 'movie', 'split', 'Don', 'Juan', 'telling', 'Dr.', 'Michler', 'story', 'life', 'Michler', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'Dunaway', '-due', 'fact', 'Don', 'Juan', 'romanicism', 'highly', 'contageous.Although', 'styoryline', 'nothing', 'special', 'script', 'even', 'less', 'performances', 'turned', 'out', 'lead', 'superb', 'Depp', 'world', 'greatest', 'lover', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'looking', 'sounding', 'said', 'have', 'fashioned', 'accent', 'Ricardo', 'Montabond', 'quot', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'quot', 'part', 'perfection', 'Dunaway', 'given', 'comparably', 'smaller', 'part', 'others', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'screentime', 'physical', 'chemistry', 'bwtween', 'Brando', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'really', 'can', 'believe', 'have', 'been', 'married', '30-someodd', 'years', 'real', 'gem', 'movie', 'however', 'great', 'one', 'performance', 'Brando', 'best', ""n't"", 'mugg', 'movie', 'Score', ""n't"", 'walls', 'eccentric', 'Island', 'Dr.', 'Moreau', 'blue', 'eyes', 'have', 'boyish', 'mischevious', 'twinkle', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'quite', 'heavy', 'good', 'deal', 'moving', 'around', 'full', 'body', 'shots', 'compared', 'other', 'recent', 'film', 'appearances', 'matter', 'what', 'physical', 'appearance', 'Brando', 'facial', 'exressions', 'subtle', 'mannerisms', 'gestures', 'most', 'humanity', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'mediocre', 'film.When', 'take', '3', 'very', 'talented', 'entertainers', 'let', 'loose', 'iffy', 'script', 'Don', 'Juan', 'DeMarco', 'end', 'result', 'Bottom', 'line', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'playing', 'one', 'look', 'Brando', 'Dunaway', 'bed', 'scenes', 'great', 'laughs', 'obvious', 'improvisation', 'anyone', 'who', '3', 'leads', 'should', 'deffinatly', 'see', 'film']",N/A

Marlon Brando, as Don Juan's psychiatrist, becomes completely entranced by Don Juan de Marco and his story of his life.  Who wouldn't?  Don Juan spent his life wooing women.  But it isn't just his suaveness or his gorgeous face; there is an aura about him, something that makes everyone around him aware of how sensitive and sensual a man he is.

Since it's Johnny Depp we are talking about here, the good news is they failed. Instead, as Marlon Brando says at the end, ""Romanticism is not only incurable, it is highly contagious.""Marlon Brando plays a shrink who is about to retire, and Don Juan De Marco (Johnny Depp) is his last patient. He first met him high above a billboard where De Marco was poised to jump. Using a ""cherry picker"" crane, Brando goes up to the top of the billboard (which depicts a model with whom De Marco is obsessed) and persuades him to come down. The hospital wants to assign a younger, more conventional therapist, but Brando insists.What is fantasy or delusion, and what is ""reality?"" And what, after all, IS reality? The movie never makes it clear, quite intentionally. De Marco's whole point is that you can choose to live your fantasy, make it reality, and who am I to argue with Johnny Depp when he says he is the world's greatest lover? Fact is, in his dashing Zorro-like costume and with his charming Mexican accent, he is indeed able to fascinate women wherever he goes. The entire female staff of the hospital falls for him, just as naturally as they would for Johnny Depp.You see why fantasy and reality get so mixed up here? And as Brando catches the romanticism ""disease"" from Depp, Faye Dunaway, playing Brando's wife, gets caught up in the romance herself. Well, Brando is still charming, for all he's grown old and fat.The theme song, ""Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?"" makes the point that we are talking about love here, not just sexuality. He is a romantic through and through, not simply a seducer.

His characterization of Don Juan (the world's greatest lover) is great. He is very good at adapting accents into his characters and this one is no exception. You would think that two legendary stars like Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway who have had very successful careers for more than three decades would steal scenes from Johnny Depp but it is him who ends stealing scenes from the two of them. This film is very good and I enjoyed it very much, it is one of my favorites. It's a simple movie with a simple plot. There are no twists and turns and no surprises.

How many comedies has he made?  In Don Juan de Marco, I enjoyed watching him be part of an ensemble cast, which has never really been his modus operandi on other sets.  As much as he derided acting as a profession, his performance in this movie seemed to argue that he still liked doing it.It is a very funny, sexy flight of notions about fantasy and reality, much like Harvey starring Jimmy Stewart did decades ago. Johnny Depp, Brando, Faye Dunaway and company, to paraphrase a line from the movie, really have a way of putting the story in touch with what is real. With Mexican ballads and exotic settings, Don Juan is like a male Sheherazad, buying time and confounding the truth.  As a lovesick worshipper of romance, he asks why we even bother to call it love any more in a modern world rushing past emotion for the carrots at the end of the stick in our lives.Just an aside, in the commentary for The Usual Suspects, the director mentioned that, after the filming of a street scene, Gabriel Bryne and company heard that Don Juan de Marco was filming at a location near there.  The whole set was reputed to be filled with nude women bathing. They all rushed over to check it out.  I tell this story to my guy friends who are quick to dismiss it on the grounds that it is a chick flick.  It got the Usual Suspects anecdote of approval. They might argue that all the beautiful nude and/or scantily clad women would have made them watch, but they are acting like Rocco, the male nurse in the hospital  I mean at Don Octavio de Flores villa, and you know what happened to Rocco  if not watch this movie.The people in the audience that saw it with me back in 1995 enjoyed it enough to not just applaud afterward but to come out chatting and politely flirting while filing out of the theater. The ushers standing by the exit mentioned that Don Juan de Marco &Ograve;thawed everybody out&Oacute; in a way they had not seen by other movies. Watching it on DVD with friends can be just as fun.

The film is a romantic comedy revolving around the overwhelming romantic effect Don Juan Demarco has just simply being around women and on his doctor (Jack Mickler played by Marlon Brando).  As Don Juan relates his fantasy-like life and romantic awakening he influences his doctor to romance his wife, played by Faye Dunaway.  It may be a bit of a stretch to see Marlon Brando as romantic at a weight of 300 plus pounds but there is a playful chemistry between Dunaway and Brando that is charming.  The story of Don Juan's life is fantastic, including his duel with the father of the woman he has fallen in love with, being sold into slavery to a Sultana and living in a harem surrounded by women.  What tension there is in the film centers on if Don Juan will be committed or released before his 10 days of observation lapse.  In this, Dr. Mickler is certain that he will be released but faces opposition from all of the other staff doctors who would prefer to see Don Juan on medication.The supporting cast turns in fine performances and includes Rachel Ticotin as Don Juan's mother.

And he does this with such conviction that to men who are open (which is only Marlon Brando's character in this case) it's also contagious.  Brando does a great job portraying a character who must maintain the rational perspective of a psychiatrist, but who is also a man - a husband - complete with his own needs and regrets.Every woman with a significant man in their lives who doesn't &#34;get&#34; women, should watch this film with their man.

30391,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0780621611,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","""Don Juan Demarco"" isn't a masterpiece and it's not bound to top a viewers Favorite Movies list...But it is a fun and enjoyable little movie that you can get for 5 bucks at your neighborhood Wal-Mart. The movie has a great cast with Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, 'Finding Neverland') and Oscar winners Marlon Brando (Best Actor, 'The Godfather') and Faye Dunaway (Best Actress, 'Network'). The movie opens with a man claiming to be Don Juan Demarco (Depp, of course), the world's greatest lover. He explains to us that he has had over a thousand women and the only one that rejected him is the only one that mattered. In that respect, he is going to kill himself...But not after one last conquest. After we watch Don Juan work his magic, we see him next atop a billboard and about to jump off. His suicide is brought to a halt when a psychiatrist named Jack Mickler (Brando) intervenes and then takes Don Juan to his care facility. The nurses are immediately smitten with the man, while most of the doctors fear treating him. After Jack begins treating Don Juan, we learn more about Don Juan's background and watch as he helps Jack rekindle his love with his wife Marilyn (Dunaway). Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Don Juan; He's a charming actor that can play anyone, but this role is perfect for him. He plays it with the same charisma and flamboyancy that he later would lend to Captain Jack Sparrow.Marlon Brando doesn't seem like the kind of person who would take a role like this unless he was in need of money, but he's actually quite good as well. Dunaway (who I hadn't seen in a movie made past the 70s) looks beautiful...This is also the nicest character I think I've seen her play (the only other films I've seen with her in it were Network and Chinatown). One of the big things that make this film so good is that by the end of the film, you don't really care if Don Juan really is Don Juan. Some films are incapable of giving you that mindset, but this film pulls it off. As I said, it's no cinematic masterpiece but it's one of those movies that Saturday nights were tailor-made for.GRADE: A",5,Don Juan Demarco,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,2115,"['Don', 'Juan', 'Demarco', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'not', 'bound', 'top', 'viewers', 'Favorite', 'Movies', 'list', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie', 'can', 'get', '5', 'bucks', 'neighborhood', 'Wal-Mart', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Best', 'Actor', ""'Finding"", 'Neverland', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Godfather', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Network"", 'movie', 'man', 'claiming', 'be', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Demarco', 'Depp', 'course', 'world', 'greatest', 'lover', 'had', 'thousand', 'women', 'only', 'one', 'rejected', 'only', 'one', 'mattered', 'respect', 'going', 'kill', 'not', 'one', 'last', 'conquest', 'watch', 'Don', 'Juan', 'work', 'magic', 'see', 'next', 'atop', 'billboard', 'jump', 'off', 'suicide', 'brought', 'halt', 'when', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Jack', 'Mickler', 'Brando', 'intervenes', 'then', 'Don', 'Juan', 'care', 'facility', 'nurses', 'are', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'man', 'most', 'doctors', 'fear', 'treating', 'Jack', 'treating', 'Don', 'Juan', 'learn', 'more', 'Don', 'Juan', 'background', 'watch', 'Jack', 'rekindle', 'love', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'Dunaway', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Don', 'Juan', 'charming', 'actor', 'can', 'play', 'anyone', 'role', 'perfect', 'same', 'charisma', 'flamboyancy', 'later', 'would', 'lend', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow.Marlon', 'Brando', ""n't"", 'seem', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'role', 'was', 'need', 'money', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Dunaway', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'made', '70s', 'beautiful', 'also', 'nicest', 'character', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'only', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'Network', 'Chinatown', 'One', 'big', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Don', 'Juan', 'really', 'Don', 'Juan', 'films', 'are', 'incapable', 'giving', 'mindset', 'film', 'off', 'said', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'movies', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'were', 'tailor-made', 'for.GRADE']",N/A
30392,A35L81CBN2Z8C0,0780621611,J. R. Neumiller,"[1, 1]","Depp is the strongest presence here - accurately realizing a very challenging and charismatic personality in Don Juan DeMarco. He is very focused, committed, and realistic. (You think about how difficult it is to realize this character and you appreciate the work Depp has done here.) He is marvelously talented, and this work portends his greater works later in his career.The box office draw here is his teaming with iconic and legendary performer, Marlon Brando, (who, you realize, really likes Depp and the whole ""lost lover"" scenario.) Brando is a notoriously difficult actor to get anything decent out of, so for him to take this work seriously says a lot about his appreciation of it. His performance is ""not bad,"" but nothing close to his greater works of the Godfather or On The Waterfront.Dunaway is Brando's wife, and is competent with the role - its interesting to see what kind of ""zing"" these two veterans generate with each other. The answer: s'okay. Nothing scintillating or noteworthy, but competent and acceptable.The story resolution leaves you a bit flat. Its kind of an interesting twist - the mental patient who ""deprograms"" his shrink, instead of the other way around. Half fantasy, half reality - although you don't know whose reality is real.Highlights - seeing Depp and Brando work together. Not ""magical,"" but good work on both sides. You can tell Brando wanted Depp to get the focus, rather than try to go toe-to-toe, (although he didn't have that much to work with.)Brando's Spanish accent, matching Depp's at the beginning, is very entertaining, because he's so good at it. (A real shrink's would have been highly lacking.)The Don Juan backstory, (based on the real Don Juan story,) is pretty good, (although unbelievable as an actual location in 1970's Mexico, no matter how ""isolated"" it may have been.)Depp's narration of his appreciation of women in general - very good and helpful. (His 2-minute seduction of a women at the restaurant is actually very believable. I believe Depp could actually pull this off.)Overall story was not so strong. Produced by FF Coppola, the premise had more potential than the movie realized. Not a stinker, but not a classic, either.

After he tries to kill himself he is sent to a mental hospital where he begings to tell his story to his doctor, Marlon Brando. Brando is about to retire and he takes on Depp as a last case in more ways then one. Brando is seemingly having troubles of his own and in an odd way these two characters end up helping each other.From that description, you would never guess it, but this is a comedy. So now that we are past that, it is the relationship between Depp and Brando is the real charm of Don Juan DeMarco. They seem to really enjoy working together. The diologue Depp delivers in this film is enormously cheesy, but he is so great he pulls it off. Certainly for Brando this is the most substancial role(as far as screen time goes) he has played in twenty something years. I find his role amusing and it is always good to see Brando having a good time.Don Juan DeMarco is a fun little movie. It is kind of light though.

Others, like John Wayne, left behind a lot of clunkers in between the really good stuff.  Brando has had a mixed bag of films but I am putting ""Don Juan DeMarco"" in the winning column because it's such an upbeat movie.  The plot appears to border on the ridiculous but the manner in which it stretches reality leaves us quite content with the flim's conclusion.  Everyone but the most cynical viewers comes away with a good feeling.  There's lots of good acting along with a rather subdued performance by Brando.  Instead of the emotional extremes he's been good at, we get a man who quietly and seriously tries to find the truth only to discover it in himself.

Don Juan only enjoys the chase; once he has captured the female, he abandons her.  Casanova adored women, all women and found in them spiritual and physical perfection.  This last describes Johnny Depp's role.The movie opens with a gloriously romantic seduction of a modern day young woman by a masked, 18th century Spanish aristocrat.  He leaves her stunned and ecstatic with joy while he dashes (cape swirling) to a building top to ---- commit suicide?  It appears he has disgraced his true love.  Marlon Brando, a psychiatrist, is called to the scene to &quot;talk him down.&quot;  No ordinary stairs or elevators to reach the rooftop for Mr. Brando.  In a memorable scene, the portly gentleman grandly rides to the top in a cherry picker for his first meeting with Don Juan reincarnated.  Their rapport is instantaneous (Depp identifies Brando as Don Ottavio de Flores,) and they ride down to street level together.The real world intervenes.  Don Juan is detained for psychiatric observation for his delusions and attempted suicide.  Brando, about to retire, wants Depp to be his last case.  Their meetings are florid reconstructions by Don Juan of his history (he was even as an infant enchanted by the ladies, seduced a gorgeous unhappy wife at 14, dueled with her husband, was sold in slavery to a Turkish caliph and not too surprisingly found himself in a harem).  Brando becomes increasingly intrigued and gradually their positions are reversed.  He is learning from Don Juan.  He wants this romance in his own life as well. At home, he woos the bewildered Faye Dunaway with the strains of Mozart's magnificent &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in the background.The movie is a froth of visions---it is worth the price of admission to see Brando dancing a chiffon-clad Faye Dunaway on an exotic beach.  They are touchingly in love.  Johnny Depp never once steps out of character (or his well-done accent) and you almost conclude he is indeed the real Don Juan.

We had missed the beginning of the movie we wanted to see but the usher suggested we see Don Juan de Marco.  It sounded like a swashbuckle movie to me but it would be fun for my husband - after all it was only 2 hours and I could rest and nap if it was not a good movie.I have never forgotten this movie.  I was never a Brando fan and knew nothing of Johnny Depp - at all - but before the movie was over I was totally in love with Brando and Depp.  Truly Brando was closer to my age so I settled for him.  This has been our favorite love story movie ever.  We loved it.  The theater was not full but the people there, weekday afternoon, were all older people and they felt the same way!  There was a Standing O when the movie closed.All the older people were leaving at once with wonderful smiles on their faces.  We all had fallen very much in love again and went home for a little nap.Don't miss this.  I am 80 now and still love to watch this movie.  Marlon is gone and so is my husband.  Johnny is too young for me but I have wonderful memories and now I own the movie.
