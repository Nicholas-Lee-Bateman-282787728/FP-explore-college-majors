271283,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,6301873238,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[3, 3]","Recently I learned that a friend of mine had become HIV+. So I decided to rent this movie I'd had been looking at for a long time but thought it might be too depressing for casual viewing. But I decided to see it anyway. Purely as a film it's greatly better than I expected,that is in terms of acting and plot construction. I was born in 1980 so some of the earlier years depicted in this film don't come to my memory. The general story is based in New York where a group of gay people,from different backrounds and walks of life who are forced to contend with AIDS,even before it had an official name. The story spans the entire decade of the 80's;from 1981 to 89 and different segments of the movie take place during a different year in the decade. It all starts out when the friends are rather casually discussing an newspaper article about a mysterious ""gay cancer"". It's really interesting to see the historical context from where these men are all summering at Fire Island and taking the whole situation very casually to something very different. At first it's taken for granted as being a disease effecting heavy drug users or those with a huge amount of sexual partners. That is,until one of these friends fall ill. Over the course of the film these men,one by one become sick and die. Some of them have become romantically involved and their intertwining stories play out all the tensions,dilemas,fear and misinformation that was a huge part of the early years of the AIDS epidemic. From this fact alone you can easily see how sad this film could be. But it's deeper than just the depressing subject of AIDS. Over the course of the film you really begin to like a number of the characters,whose own personel concerns give way to a great sense of sympathy,concern and kindness. And even for them you have to watch them all succomb to AIDS.In the end only two of them and their female friend whose been by their side since the very beginning have survived. The metaphorical scene in the end,which is too important to me for a spoiler is really the part the effected me most emotionally. Personally I found the movie more upsetting at first,since so much of the film strongly emphasizes the feeling of hysteria regarding AIDS before there was a lot of knowledge about the disease. Some of the knowledge in the early days in fact was totally based on hysteria in fact. Another sad fact about this is you really see how AIDS was effecting gay people just at the same time they were beginning to gain acceptance in a society that had long cruelly condemn them. After all,we all remember how both situations intertwined in real life with Rock Hudson. This is actually an excellent slice of life story for those interested in this particular subject matter,whether or gay or not. I would recommend that the sensative and highly bummed out might want to avoid this. But that doesn't take away from how important this movie was and still is even today.",5,A Brilliant Crier Movie,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,2951,"['Recently', 'learned', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'become', 'HIV+', 'decided', 'rent', 'movie', ""'d"", 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'long', 'time', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'depressing', 'casual', 'viewing', 'decided', 'see', 'anyway', 'Purely', 'film', 'greatly', 'better', 'expected', 'terms', 'acting', 'plot', 'construction', 'was', 'born', '1980', 'earlier', 'years', 'depicted', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'memory', 'general', 'story', 'based', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'group', 'gay', 'people', 'different', 'backrounds', 'walks', 'life', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'contend', 'AIDS', 'even', 'had', 'official', 'name', 'story', 'entire', 'decade', '80', '1981', '89', 'different', 'segments', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'different', 'year', 'decade', 'out', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'rather', 'casually', 'discussing', 'newspaper', 'article', 'mysterious', 'gay', 'cancer', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'historical', 'context', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'summering', 'Fire', 'Island', 'taking', 'whole', 'situation', 'very', 'casually', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'first', 'taken', 'granted', 'being', 'disease', 'effecting', 'heavy', 'drug', 'users', 'huge', 'amount', 'sexual', 'partners', 'one', 'friends', 'fall', 'ill.', 'course', 'film', 'men', 'one', 'one', 'become', 'sick', 'die', 'have', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'intertwining', 'stories', 'play', 'out', 'tensions', 'dilemas', 'fear', 'misinformation', 'was', 'huge', 'part', 'early', 'years', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'fact', 'alone', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'sad', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'deeper', 'just', 'depressing', 'subject', 'AIDS', 'course', 'film', 'really', 'begin', 'like', 'number', 'characters', 'own', 'personel', 'concerns', 'give', 'way', 'great', 'sense', 'sympathy', 'concern', 'kindness', 'even', 'have', 'watch', 'succomb', 'AIDS.In', 'end', 'only', 'two', 'female', 'friend', 'been', 'side', 'very', 'beginning', 'have', 'survived', 'metaphorical', 'scene', 'end', 'too', 'important', 'spoiler', 'really', 'part', 'effected', 'most', 'emotionally', 'Personally', 'found', 'movie', 'more', 'upsetting', 'first', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'strongly', 'feeling', 'hysteria', 'regarding', 'AIDS', 'was', 'lot', 'knowledge', 'disease', 'knowledge', 'early', 'days', 'fact', 'was', 'totally', 'based', 'hysteria', 'fact', 'sad', 'fact', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'AIDS', 'was', 'effecting', 'gay', 'people', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'beginning', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'society', 'had', 'long', 'cruelly', 'condemn', 'remember', 'how', 'situations', 'intertwined', 'real', 'life', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'actually', 'excellent', 'slice', 'life', 'story', 'interested', 'particular', 'subject', 'matter', 'gay', 'not', 'would', 'recommend', 'sensative', 'highly', 'bummed', 'out', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'how', 'important', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'even', 'today']",N/A
271284,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301873238,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","To say that I'm shocked that a film like `Longtime Companion' was even made in the time that it was made (1990) is an understatement.  The very idea of a film about homosexuality that focuses on the plight of the AIDS epidemic seems almost too taboo for a film made over twenty years ago.  Then, to actually see it and see how genuine and realistic and `human' the film is; well that's an even bigger shock.  I went into this film (especially after the first scene) expecting this to be a total stereotype with flamboyance and nearsighted ignorance splashed all over every frame.  What I got was something far more tender and true.You can `feel' this movie.`Longtime Companion' tells the story of a group of gay men living during the AIDS scare of the 80's.  Spanning the entire decade, we open with a newspaper article about `gay cancer' that is startling some and making others roll their eyes.  To some, the idea of a gay cancer is a joke, but to others it soon becomes a reality.  Having no known cure and really no known distributor, the friends start to change their lifestyles and second guess every action; for fear that they may catch this disease.  Soon, AIDS starts to take its toll on the friends, and some actually lose their lives to the disease.The script is semi-genius in the way it really fleshes out these characters without saying too much.  Just the situations and the facial expressions (bravo to the ENTIRE cast) help tell a story of internal conflictions without feeling the need to spell everything out for us (I hate it when a script insists on having the actions speak their every thought).  It has such graceful subtlety, despite dealing with ingrown flamboyance from time to time.  Like I said, I would have never imagined a film dealing with this subject made so long ago would have the class that this film possesses, but it does.  That class is thanks, in large part, to the extraordinary cast who really digs deep into these men and finds such strength and humanity.  Campbell Scott, Stephen Caffrey, Mark Lamos and especially Bruce Davison all deliver strong and effecting performances.  It's no surprise that Davison was singled out though.  His character has such personality, and he really develops over the course of the film.  His final scene with Lamos is especially `real'.  You can feel the emotions being withdrawn in his speech, and you know he's fighting back with everything he has.  It's a tremendously subtle and haunting performance.With the great combination of subject, script and performances, `Longtime Companion' was a big surprise for me, a film that really understood its purpose and serves as a landmark (in entirely `good' ways) in film today.  That closing scene, with the harsh reality as if waking from a dream, is eternally etched in my mind.Heading on down to the post-mortem bar.",5,I'll remember you for longtime...,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,2843,"['say', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'film', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'time', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'understatement', 'very', 'idea', 'film', 'homosexuality', 'plight', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'almost', 'too', 'taboo', 'film', 'made', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Then', 'actually', 'see', 'see', 'how', 'genuine', 'realistic', 'human', 'film', 'well', 'even', 'bigger', 'shock', 'went', 'film', 'especially', 'first', 'scene', 'expecting', 'be', 'total', 'stereotype', 'flamboyance', 'nearsighted', 'ignorance', 'splashed', 'frame', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'tender', 'true.You', 'can', 'feel', 'movie.', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'tells', 'story', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'living', 'AIDS', 'scare', '80', 'Spanning', 'entire', 'decade', 'open', 'newspaper', 'article', 'gay', 'cancer', 'startling', 'making', 'others', 'roll', 'eyes', 'idea', 'gay', 'cancer', 'joke', 'others', 'soon', 'reality', 'Having', 'known', 'cure', 'really', 'known', 'distributor', 'friends', 'start', 'change', 'lifestyles', 'second', 'guess', 'action', 'fear', 'may', 'catch', 'disease', 'Soon', 'AIDS', 'take', 'toll', 'friends', 'actually', 'lose', 'lives', 'disease.The', 'script', 'semi-genius', 'way', 'really', 'out', 'characters', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'Just', 'situations', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bravo', 'ENTIRE', 'cast', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'internal', 'conflictions', 'feeling', 'need', 'spell', 'everything', 'out', 'hate', 'when', 'script', 'having', 'actions', 'speak', 'thought', 'such', 'graceful', 'subtlety', 'dealing', 'ingrown', 'flamboyance', 'time', 'time', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'film', 'dealing', 'subject', 'made', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'class', 'film', 'class', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'who', 'really', 'deep', 'men', 'finds', 'such', 'strength', 'humanity', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Stephen', 'Caffrey', 'Mark', 'Lamos', 'especially', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'deliver', 'strong', 'effecting', 'performances', 'surprise', 'Davison', 'was', 'singled', 'out', 'character', 'such', 'personality', 'really', 'course', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'Lamos', 'especially', 'real', 'can', 'feel', 'emotions', 'being', 'withdrawn', 'speech', 'know', 'fighting', 'back', 'everything', 'tremendously', 'subtle', 'haunting', 'performance.With', 'great', 'combination', 'subject', 'script', 'performances', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'was', 'big', 'surprise', 'film', 'really', 'understood', 'purpose', 'landmark', 'entirely', 'good', 'ways', 'film', 'today', 'closing', 'scene', 'harsh', 'reality', 'waking', 'dream', 'eternally', 'etched', 'mind.Heading', 'post-mortem', 'bar']",N/A
271285,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301873238,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/14Rate: 83/14: Longtime Companion is a terrific period picture about the nascent AIDS crisis. In fact, it's the very first mainstream picture to touch the topic. What's really interesting about the film is that there is a preservation of the initial fears and misconceptions about the disease. One can see how it was once marked as a ""gay cancer"" and that people thought its contagiousness was spread by non-sexual contact via physical touch, kiss, and air. Remember, this is the very early stuff that people, even the doctors, did not know or understand the epidemic well enough. Seeing the scenes involving homosexuality in Longtime Companion, I am surprised, although it is unfair to say, that these actors risked their careers to do it. Regardless, the performances of the cast are outstanding, and Bruce Davison earns his nomination, which is a well-deserved one, for playing David. I like to think of his to be a representative of the cast because everybody is more or less as good as he. As for the victims of the deadly disease, it's just too bad and unfortunate. For the film as a whole, I am knocking a couple of points off because it can be a little uneven, struggling to keep up with the many characters at once, and moves forward somewhat quickly without tying up some loose ends. Yet it's never melodramatic but real enough. All in all, Longtime Companion is still an outstanding picture that I've enjoyed very much, and it is indeed a sad story.",4,A Very Sad Story.,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1470,"['Viewed', '3/14Rate', '83/14', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'terrific', 'period', 'picture', 'nascent', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'fact', 'very', 'first', 'mainstream', 'picture', 'touch', 'topic', 'What', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'preservation', 'initial', 'fears', 'misconceptions', 'disease', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'once', 'marked', 'gay', 'cancer', 'people', 'thought', 'contagiousness', 'was', 'spread', 'non-sexual', 'contact', 'physical', 'touch', 'kiss', 'air', 'Remember', 'very', 'early', 'stuff', 'people', 'even', 'doctors', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'understand', 'epidemic', 'well', 'enough', 'Seeing', 'scenes', 'involving', 'homosexuality', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'am', 'surprised', 'unfair', 'say', 'actors', 'risked', 'careers', 'do', 'Regardless', 'performances', 'cast', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'nomination', 'well-deserved', 'one', 'playing', 'David', 'like', 'think', 'be', 'representative', 'cast', 'everybody', 'more', 'as', 'good', 'victims', 'deadly', 'disease', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'whole', 'am', 'knocking', 'couple', 'points', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'uneven', 'struggling', 'keep', 'up', 'many', 'characters', 'once', 'forward', 'somewhat', 'quickly', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'never', 'melodramatic', 'real', 'enough', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'still', 'outstanding', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'indeed', 'sad', 'story']",N/A

Great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time--when AIDS was first being diagnosed as ""the gay cancer,"" up through the mid-eighties, when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends. Though HIV/AIDS had been around for a decade when this movie was made, there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past. They not only show the ugliness of the disease, they show the ugliness of people's response to it. Even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint, accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves, or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs. There was fear of contamination, reluctance to touch or kiss, and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered. People reached deperately for New Age cures, and Louise Haye was the reigning goddess of self-healing. By choosing to depict a five-year period, the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen. Some of course succumb to the disease and die, others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives. In the end, the survivors try to become part of the solution; they become visiting volunteers and political activists. For all its authenticity, the film is not depressing. This is incredible ensemble acting at its best. Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison, and Mark Lamos give especially moving performances, but there are no slackers in this cast.By the time the movie was released, the face of AIDS was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims. I felt then, and I continue to believe, this is a misplaced criticism. All fiction is self-limited. LONGTIME COMPANION is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease; and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them. Yes, they were wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together on Fire Island. But LONGTIME COMPANION is not a celebration of their insular lives. In fact, by the end of the film, one of this insular group, Campbell Scott's character, is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a Latino man. I think the filmmakers, like GMHC at the time, were aware that things were starting to change. It seems to me that the film's critics, even in 1990, had forgotten that AIDS was first announced in the New York Times as ""gay cancer"" and later as ""Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" before being called AIDS. But that said, we need to remember that there are many other people's stories that are worth telling, including those of people living and coping with AIDS in Africa. My only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of LONGTIME COMPANION.The DVD has no significant ""extras,"" but the transfer is excellent.",5,The way it was,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,3064,"['thing', 'remember', 'most', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', '1990', 'was', 'honesty', 'level', 'Great', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'accurately', 'depict', 'one', 'particular', 'community', 'one', 'particular', 'time', 'when', 'AIDS', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'gay', 'cancer', 'up', 'mid-eighties', 'when', 'attending', 'monthly', 'funerals', 'was', 'commonplace', 'gay', 'men', 'friends', 'HIV/AIDS', 'had', 'been', 'around', 'decade', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'effort', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'whitewash', 'past', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'ugliness', 'disease', 'show', 'ugliness', 'people', 'response', 'Even', 'gay', 'community', 'there', 'was', 'tendency', 'people', 'fingerpoint', 'accusing', 'first', 'victims', 'being', 'more', 'promiscuous', 'more', 'excessive', 'users', 'amyl', 'nitrate', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'was', 'fear', 'contamination', 'reluctance', 'touch', 'kiss', 'even', 'intimacy', 'monogomous', 'relationships', 'was', 'hampered', 'People', 'reached', 'deperately', 'New', 'Age', 'Louise', 'Haye', 'was', 'reigning', 'goddess', 'self-healing', 'choosing', 'depict', 'five-year', 'period', 'filmmakers', 'allow', 'viewer', 'see', 'lives', 'group', 'friends', 'evolve', 'deepen', 'course', 'succumb', 'disease', 'die', 'others', 'wrestle', 'losses', 'rethink', 'lives', 'end', 'survivors', 'try', 'become', 'part', 'solution', 'become', 'visiting', 'volunteers', 'political', 'activists', 'authenticity', 'film', 'not', 'depressing', 'incredible', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'best', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Mark', 'Lamos', 'give', 'especially', 'moving', 'performances', 'are', 'slackers', 'cast.By', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'face', 'AIDS', 'was', 'already', 'changing', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'criticized', 'focusing', 'exclusively', 'gay', 'victims', 'felt', 'then', 'continue', 'believe', 'misplaced', 'criticism', 'fiction', 'self-limited', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'story', 'one', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'affected', 'unknown', 'dreadful', 'disease', 'how', 'challenges', 'thrown', 'Yes', 'were', 'wealthy', 'middle-class', 'white', 'men', 'who', 'spent', 'summers', 'together', 'Fire', 'Island', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'not', 'celebration', 'insular', 'lives', 'fact', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'insular', 'group', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'character', 'shown', 'working', 'home', 'care', 'volunteer', 'who', 'Latino', 'man', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'GMHC', 'time', 'were', 'aware', 'things', 'were', 'starting', 'change', 'film', 'critics', 'even', '1990', 'had', 'forgotten', 'AIDS', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'gay', 'cancer', 'later', 'Gay', 'Related', 'Immune', 'Deficiency', 'Syndrome', 'being', 'called', 'AIDS', 'said', 'need', 'remember', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'worth', 'telling', 'including', 'people', 'living', 'coping', 'AIDS', 'Africa', 'only', 'hope', 'stories', 'will', 'be', 'told', 'accuracy', 'sensitivity', 'went', 'making', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION.The', 'DVD', 'significant', 'extras', 'transfer', 'excellent']",N/A

The first scene that will just leave you numb is Bruce Davison's character at his lover's side urging him to 'just rest,' as he essentially begs him to die.  It is quietly and poigniantly stoic and will break your heart.

Longtime Companion (which derives its title from the term that showed up in so many obituaries at the height of AIDS--""...survived by his longtime companion..."") lacks a plot that runs deeper than a showcase of deaths and ruined lives, and its characters are basic stereotypes: the hot young guy, the co-habiting couple, the rich, older type, etc. Overall, it doesn't have a lot to it except a single message, and single message films normally don't work that well, especially when there is as little depth as there is here.",3,Dreary And Not All That Watchable,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,1032,"['respect', 'ultra-realism', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'have', 'doubt', 'landmark', 'production', 'accurately', 'conveys', 'horror', 'HIV/AIDS', 'how', 'plague', 'arrived', 'unforeseen', '1980', 'ending', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'golden', 'age', 'American', 'gay', 'existence', 'taking', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'causing', 'so', 'much', 'misery', 'community', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'portrayal', 'tragedy', 'make', 'dreary', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Longtime', 'Companion', ""n't"", 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'central', 'message', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'title', 'term', 'showed', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'obituaries', 'height', 'AIDS', 'survived', 'longtime', 'companion', 'plot', 'deeper', 'showcase', 'deaths', 'ruined', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'basic', 'stereotypes', 'hot', 'young', 'guy', 'co-habiting', 'couple', 'rich', 'older', 'type', 'etc', 'Overall', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'single', 'message', 'single', 'message', 'films', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'as', 'little', 'depth', 'here']",N/A

Luckily for me, Longtime Companion turned out to be a quality movie that deals with the subject matter in a sensitive and realisitic manner.We first encounter the characters in Longtime Companion during the 'gay heyday' of the early 80's. Fun was seemingly had by all, and the acceptance of gay men was at an all time high. Then we see news filtering out through the newspapers about a 'gay cancer'.The rest of the plot is obvious - the 'crisis' gets worse and people die.Longtime Companion seemingly recreates those first few years in accurate detail, which is of particular interest to those of us who were too young to experience it. But one theme that this movie really hons in on is the uncertainty of that time and the fear resulting from that uncertainty. No one really knew where all this was heading-  so called experts constantly giving false claims as to what was causing the 'gay cancer' certainly didn't help. We take it for granted that at the time of writing this, a huge amount of information is readily available to us concerning HIV and AIDS. Gay men in the early 80's were not that lucky and had to experience the onset of AIDS, with not only the health and mortality concerns, but also the associated negative stigma. This is what Longtime Companion deals with in a wonderfully sensitive and emotive way. Once you see the final scene - a truely emotive experience, you will realise how wonderful this movie really is.The performance of the cast is simply breathtaking. There are no stereotypical characterisations of the gay man - the characters have been well flushed out and we get an eclectic, three dimensional group of gay men.The DVD itself has the movie with excellent picture quality, a trailer and nothing else. It is a shame that no extras were included - even static screens of texts with additional information would have been welcome. But we have such a wonderful movie available to us on our favourite media, and that is something to be thankful for.Longtime Companion is a sad movie, but one that is very important in the history of homosexuality. You will feel sad and need a box of tissues handy, but you will also get to see how these brave men came face to face with something that would turn out to be so devastating to our community. The gay men of the AIDS era as is depicted in Longtime Companion need to be historically acknowledged and I have yet to see a movie that does this as well as Longtime Companion.

Bruce Davison received a well-deserved Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in ""Longtime Companion,"" the term that was sometimes used to name the ""next of kin"" in these gay families under attack by AIDS.

The news paper articles, called it ""gay cancer"", and we joked at what seemed to be yet another attempt to disparage homosexual lifestyles. This movie has perfectly depicted the gay scene during that period, and absolutely captured the nature of groups of gay friends - male and female - as we lost dozens of our friends to this disease. The actors are absolutely wonderful, this movie is perfectly cast. The beauty of devotion and friendship, the ugliness of bigotry and lack of action to stop this disease are a perfect combination of the conflicts involed as AIDS began it's tragic invasion of America. As the ""it can't happen to me"" gave way to the fear, hysteria and blame, shining through was the indomitable spirit of the wonderful human beings who make up our gay community in unity, love, support and care.  As a lesbian fully active in the gay community during the onset of AIDS, I lived this experience, it is absolutely spot on.

271305,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301873238,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","A historical film from the time when AIDS struck New York City right in the core of the big apple, its artistic community. It follows the plague from July 3, 1981 to July 19, 1889 and it shows how the community was disoriented and panicked by this unknown and unheard of disease.It took two years for the word AIDS to become common and to have the first gay kiss on a TV soap opera. They came out on the TV screen and caused more fear than surprise. Surprise would have been good in a way since people would have woken up without a hangover, but fear was the hangover.The film concentrates on the gay community and people close to it not on the people around, the rest of the society that did not behold but stigmatized. So we do not get the horrible rejection that the gay community lived through at the time. We only follow it from behind gay eyelids.Compassion at first meant there was some hope it could be stopped or cured with antibiotics or something. Then paranoia started settling in the minds like a real cancer in the psyche. It ate the souls and the thinking ability of everyone or nearly because it no longer was a disease but a disease that killed with certainty.The next stop was hypochondria. Gay men started checking themselves and believing they were every single one of them the next victims. They were the hosts of a morbid fascination that injected the death process of their friends into themselves. Morbid empathy that could kill the living spirit of anyone in no time. And yet little by little the tools of some resistance came up from the minds and hands of some volunteers. And It was needed because people with AIDS started being fired because they had no insurance and they found themselves in overcrowded hospitals that did not know how to cope with the problem and only checked more or less the insurance coverage every patient had or did not have and Medicaid was by far not enough even to accompany the beneficiaries to the end.And the absolute blank in which the gay community was for several years made most people unable to see how it was propagated, made them believe it was some kind of punishment or curse on the gay community from ... What did he say Ronald Reagan at the time? It is not quoted in the film. So they punished themselves with ""No sex please we may have AIDS."" Or even worse ""No kiss please, we may have the virus in our saliva.""At this point the film goes down to rock bottom and touches it with the death of Sean slowly hypnotized into letting everything go and dying in peace, with no cry, without resisting, though not without tears and suffering at the loss this death meant for him and for the one he left behind. And David who accompanied him through his last night is buried in his turn fifteen months later and his friends tell him good bye in the church of his affiliation. And we are in June 1987. What the friends say from the pulpit is the first step out of the quagmire, the first step forward in the minds of the gay members of this gay community. And now they can start resisting and fighting back and requiring the treatment, health care, and that is necessary for the still living ones to be able to learn how to live with AIDS.Shows are organized to gather support for the sick people and the community, demonstrations are set up targeting the health services and the city hall of New York, the Mayor in particular. And they clash with the police, and they demonstrate again. ""It seems inconceivable, does it? That there was ever a time before all this."" When you start forgetting what the past was you start becoming able to look at the future and they did. Remembering is important but certainly not to nostalgically regret what it was.Three survivors are on the Atlantic beach and they get ready for the next demonstration and they speak of a cure and they want to be there when it happens. Then a vision of the whole crowd they used to be runs down onto the beach and they are all there, here, with the three survivors. The ghosts of course of those who have gone away, or maybe the three survivors are already ghosts meeting with those who went before them? A last shot comes back to the three survivors. They want to be there when a cure is found, and 25 years later a cure is still not found but you can live with AIDS, and rather quite many years now. Thanks to that first generation of pioneers.The film is from 1989. It was sad but also full of hope then and today it is still sad and still full of hope but we are convinced that even in catastrophic situations death is not the only one to win and it can even be defeated.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,They were the pioneering victims and trailblazers,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,4626,"['historical', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'AIDS', 'struck', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'right', 'core', 'big', 'apple', 'artistic', 'community', 'plague', 'July', '3', '1981', 'July', '19', '1889', 'how', 'community', 'was', 'disoriented', 'panicked', 'unknown', 'unheard', 'disease.It', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'word', 'AIDS', 'become', 'common', 'have', 'first', 'gay', 'kiss', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'came', 'out', 'TV', 'screen', 'caused', 'more', 'fear', 'surprise', 'Surprise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'way', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'woken', 'up', 'hangover', 'fear', 'was', 'hangover.The', 'film', 'concentrates', 'gay', 'community', 'people', 'close', 'not', 'people', 'rest', 'society', 'did', 'not', 'behold', 'stigmatized', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'horrible', 'rejection', 'gay', 'community', 'lived', 'time', 'only', 'follow', 'gay', 'eyelids.Compassion', 'first', 'meant', 'was', 'hope', 'could', 'be', 'stopped', 'cured', 'antibiotics', 'something', 'Then', 'paranoia', 'started', 'settling', 'minds', 'real', 'cancer', 'psyche', 'ate', 'souls', 'thinking', 'ability', 'everyone', 'nearly', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'disease', 'disease', 'killed', 'certainty.The', 'next', 'stop', 'was', 'hypochondria', 'Gay', 'men', 'started', 'checking', 'believing', 'were', 'single', 'one', 'next', 'victims', 'were', 'hosts', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'injected', 'death', 'process', 'friends', 'Morbid', 'could', 'kill', 'living', 'spirit', 'anyone', 'time', 'yet', 'little', 'little', 'tools', 'resistance', 'came', 'up', 'minds', 'hands', 'volunteers', 'was', 'needed', 'because', 'people', 'AIDS', 'started', 'being', 'fired', 'had', 'insurance', 'found', 'overcrowded', 'hospitals', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'cope', 'problem', 'only', 'checked', 'more', 'less', 'insurance', 'coverage', 'patient', 'had', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Medicaid', 'was', 'far', 'not', 'enough', 'even', 'accompany', 'beneficiaries', 'end.And', 'absolute', 'blank', 'gay', 'community', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'made', 'most', 'people', 'unable', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'propagated', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'kind', 'punishment', 'curse', 'gay', 'community', 'What', 'did', 'say', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'time', 'not', 'quoted', 'film', 'punished', 'No', 'sex', 'please', 'may', 'have', 'AIDS', 'even', 'worse', 'kiss', 'please', 'may', 'have', 'virus', 'saliva', 'point', 'film', 'down', 'rock', 'bottom', 'touches', 'death', 'Sean', 'slowly', 'hypnotized', 'letting', 'everything', 'go', 'dying', 'peace', 'cry', 'resisting', 'not', 'tears', 'suffering', 'loss', 'death', 'meant', 'one', 'left', 'behind', 'David', 'who', 'accompanied', 'last', 'night', 'buried', 'turn', 'fifteen', 'months', 'later', 'friends', 'tell', 'good', 'bye', 'church', 'affiliation', 'are', 'June', '1987', 'What', 'friends', 'say', 'pulpit', 'first', 'step', 'quagmire', 'first', 'step', 'forward', 'minds', 'gay', 'members', 'gay', 'community', 'now', 'can', 'start', 'resisting', 'fighting', 'back', 'requiring', 'treatment', 'health', 'care', 'necessary', 'still', 'living', 'ones', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'how', 'live', 'AIDS.Shows', 'are', 'organized', 'gather', 'support', 'sick', 'people', 'community', 'demonstrations', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'targeting', 'health', 'services', 'city', 'hall', 'New', 'York', 'Mayor', 'particular', 'clash', 'police', 'demonstrate', 'again', 'inconceivable', 'was', 'ever', 'time', 'When', 'start', 'forgetting', 'what', 'past', 'was', 'start', 'becoming', 'able', 'look', 'future', 'did', 'Remembering', 'important', 'certainly', 'not', 'nostalgically', 'regret', 'what', 'was.Three', 'survivors', 'are', 'Atlantic', 'beach', 'get', 'ready', 'next', 'demonstration', 'speak', 'cure', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'Then', 'vision', 'whole', 'crowd', 'used', 'be', 'runs', 'down', 'beach', 'are', 'there', 'here', 'three', 'survivors', 'ghosts', 'course', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'away', 'maybe', 'three', 'survivors', 'are', 'already', 'ghosts', 'meeting', 'who', 'went', 'last', 'shot', 'back', 'three', 'survivors', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'cure', 'found', '25', 'years', 'later', 'cure', 'still', 'not', 'found', 'can', 'live', 'AIDS', 'rather', 'quite', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'Thanks', 'first', 'generation', 'pioneers.The', 'film', '1989', 'was', 'sad', 'also', 'full', 'hope', 'then', 'today', 'still', 'sad', 'still', 'full', 'hope', 'are', 'convinced', 'even', 'catastrophic', 'situations', 'death', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'win', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'defeated.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The limitations evident when the movie debuted are still there: yes, the men (with the obligatory wise-cracking straight female friend) are all rich yuppies, and they're all white. They seem to exist on their own without any family members--though perhaps this is realistic; many gays and lesbians are indeed estranged from close relatives. More seriously, the omission of the latest news available then about the HIV virus and how safer sex could reduce transmission makes the health picture appear more dark than it in fact was, even in 1990.Ultimately none of this lessens the emotional impact of the intertwined stories of these characters, due to a quality script and superb acting. There are scenes that overwhelm even now with their power and truth, notably that of Bruce Davison gently helping his lover Mark Lamos let go of life, and the conclusion, that slips momentarily into fantasy in a most moving way. The promiscuous gay lifestyle is given its due, but so are stable, long-term relationships.

This films is about a cluster of friends, dying one by one from AIDS during the 80's.The movie opens in 1980, with this particular circle of friends.  Everyone is healthy and dandy.  One man meets a hairy guy and they've maintained a relationship throughout the film.  This movie immediately opens with all of them reading about this mysterious virus that seems to be attacking gay men.  At first, it seemed to be associated with gay men who do poppers.  This virus has earned a nickname, ""gay cancer"".  It wasn't until a couple of years later that this virus was finally termed AIDS.The whole AIDS was not still not clear to people, including gay men.  In this film, you'll see how some gay men are uncomfortable with AIDS and especially those afflicted.  You'll see men afraid to have sex.  Afraid to kiss.  Heck, you'll even see one washing his hands and face vigorously after greeting his friend who is dying from AIDS.The time frame between the death of one friend to another friend having AIDS is quick.  The movie jumps one year to another that surrounds an afflicted friends.  You'll think that the movie doesn't build up enough for you to get emotional.  Not true.  You'll cry!  So, have a box of Kleenex ready.I love this movie and I cannot believe that I haven't seen it earlier.  I often hear about older gay men retelling stories of the 70's and 80's on how gay life use to be as well as witnessing the deaths of their close friends to AIDS.  Today, those affliced with HIV/AIDS are living longer, thanks to modern medicine.  However, I cannot imagine what it was like, living in fear of a virus that seemed to be targeting gay men and the doctors could not seem to treat it.Overall, it's a good movie that's worth your time.

271315,AFOK05KDCHSHL,6301873238,Libretio,"[27, 30]","LONGTIME COMPANION(USA - 1990)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoInitially conceived as a response to Hollywood's hypocritical reluctance to depict the AIDS crisis within mainstream cinema, LONGTIME COMPANION limped into production in 1989 on half the projected $3 million budget, generously donated by producer Lindsay Law and the American Playhouse company, only to face another uphill struggle as soon as the movie was completed. Until the Samuel Goldwyn company bought worldwide distribution rights (somewhat reluctantly, it must be said), most mainstream and independent distributors were disinclined to tackle a movie which concentrates exclusively on the devastating effects of AIDS on a group of middle-class gay men from the years 1981 to 1988. Apparently, it's OK if the drama involves a cute kid who was accidentally infected by a tainted blood transfusion, or if it features a teary-eyed heterosexual mom who inadvertently 'contaminates' her big butch heterosexual husband, but not if it's about a bunch of (gays). Aware of this sickening double standard, writer Craig Lucas and debut director Norman Ren&eacute; held back on the explicit love scenes and aimed their film at the widest possible audience.That it still works is due in large part to a fantastic ensemble cast headlined by Bruce Davison as the 'mother hen' figure who holds court over a disparate group of writers, actors, businessmen, and their various friends and associates. Davison was Oscar-nominated for his strong performance, though he's matched every step of the way by Campbell Scott (son of George C.) as a young man who struggles desperately to hide from the reality of the horrors around him after his best friend (Dermot Mulroney) becomes one of the first casualties. Beefcake is provided by Patrick Cassidy and John Dossett as a loving couple whose lives are torn apart by the disease, while Mary-Louise Parker portrays one of the few straight characters in the group, a woman whose life revolves around her dwindling circle of gay friends.Lucas' insightful script uses these characters to describe the progressive response of the gay community to the unfolding crisis, from the casual dismissals which greeted the first reports of a 'gay cancer' which appeared in 1981, through to the fear and confusion which descended as the disease began to dominate daily life. Hope breeds a certain amount of naivety in some of the early scenes (one character's philosophy is basically 'think happy thoughts and everything will be fine'), until the threat is finally absorbed and accepted, culminating in militant action against an ultra-conservative Establishment which seems determined to ignore the unfolding situation.Lip service is paid to some of the important social issues which arose from the AIDS epidemic, but the film refuses to become sidelined by politics - Reagan is mentioned but not criticized, and there's a brief tirade against a health care system which seems more concerned with insurance than patient welfare - and instead focusses its attentions on people whose lives are ravaged by circumstances beyond their control. Director Ren&eacute;, who had worked almost exclusively in theatre beforehand, is reluctant to allow sentiment to prevail, to the point where even the heaviest scenes are almost drained of genuine emotion, and some of the many dialogue exchanges which make up the bulk of the film should have been tightened during the editing process. But the cast breathes life into a broad range of recognizable characters, and the film survives primarily as an invaluable record of a dark chapter in gay history.If the drama seems a little dated by subsequent advances in the treatment of HIV and AIDS, and if the subject no longer commands the same level of attention which existed when the movie first opened, its educational value remains intact. One gets the sense from this kind of movie that, even when a cure is eventually found, very little will change in the short term. Too many wonderful people have died and taken all their priceless ideosyncracies with them to the grave, and too many others have lost precious companions and loved ones for the sudden discovery of a cure to make much of a difference. But when future generations are finally released from the tyranny of AIDS, movies like LONGTIME COMPANION will always be there to remind them of a time when the world wasn't such a carefree place, and when the kindness and compassion of devoted friends was no guarantee of immunity from loss and devastation.",3,Social document recalls dark chapter in gay history,1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,4544,"['LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'USA', '1990', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'MonoInitially', 'conceived', 'response', 'Hollywood', 'hypocritical', 'reluctance', 'depict', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'limped', 'production', '1989', 'projected', '3', 'million', 'budget', 'generously', 'donated', 'producer', 'Lindsay', 'Law', 'American', 'Playhouse', 'company', 'only', 'face', 'uphill', 'struggle', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'completed', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'company', 'bought', 'worldwide', 'distribution', 'rights', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'mainstream', 'independent', 'distributors', 'were', 'disinclined', 'tackle', 'movie', 'exclusively', 'devastating', 'effects', 'AIDS', 'group', 'middle-class', 'gay', 'men', 'years', '1981', '1988', 'Apparently', 'OK', 'drama', 'cute', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'accidentally', 'infected', 'tainted', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'teary-eyed', 'heterosexual', 'mom', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'big', 'butch', 'heterosexual', 'husband', 'not', 'bunch', 'gays', 'Aware', 'sickening', 'double', 'standard', 'writer', 'Craig', 'Lucas', 'debut', 'director', 'Norman', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'held', 'back', 'explicit', 'love', 'scenes', 'aimed', 'film', 'widest', 'possible', 'still', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'headlined', 'Bruce', 'Davison', ""'mother"", 'hen', 'figure', 'who', 'court', 'disparate', 'group', 'writers', 'actors', 'businessmen', 'various', 'friends', 'associates', 'Davison', 'was', 'Oscar-nominated', 'strong', 'performance', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'son', 'George', 'C.', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'desperately', 'hide', 'reality', 'horrors', 'best', 'friend', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'one', 'first', 'casualties', 'Beefcake', 'provided', 'Patrick', 'Cassidy', 'John', 'Dossett', 'loving', 'couple', 'lives', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'disease', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'one', 'few', 'straight', 'characters', 'group', 'woman', 'life', 'dwindling', 'circle', 'gay', 'friends.Lucas', 'insightful', 'script', 'characters', 'describe', 'progressive', 'response', 'gay', 'community', 'unfolding', 'crisis', 'casual', 'dismissals', 'greeted', 'first', 'reports', ""'gay"", 'cancer', 'appeared', '1981', 'fear', 'confusion', 'descended', 'disease', 'began', 'dominate', 'daily', 'life', 'Hope', 'certain', 'amount', 'naivety', 'early', 'scenes', 'one', 'character', 'philosophy', 'basically', 'happy', 'thoughts', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'threat', 'finally', 'absorbed', 'accepted', 'culminating', 'militant', 'action', 'ultra-conservative', 'Establishment', 'determined', 'ignore', 'unfolding', 'situation.Lip', 'service', 'paid', 'important', 'social', 'issues', 'arose', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'film', 'become', 'sidelined', 'politics', 'Reagan', 'mentioned', 'not', 'criticized', 'brief', 'tirade', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'more', 'concerned', 'insurance', 'patient', 'welfare', 'instead', 'attentions', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'ravaged', 'circumstances', 'control', 'Director', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'theatre', 'beforehand', 'reluctant', 'allow', 'sentiment', 'prevail', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'heaviest', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'drained', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'many', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'editing', 'process', 'cast', 'life', 'broad', 'range', 'recognizable', 'characters', 'film', 'primarily', 'invaluable', 'record', 'dark', 'chapter', 'gay', 'history.If', 'drama', 'little', 'dated', 'subsequent', 'advances', 'treatment', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'subject', 'no', 'longer', 'same', 'level', 'attention', 'existed', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'opened', 'educational', 'value', 'intact', 'One', 'sense', 'kind', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'cure', 'eventually', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'will', 'change', 'short', 'term', 'Too', 'many', 'wonderful', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'taken', 'priceless', 'ideosyncracies', 'grave', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'lost', 'precious', 'companions', 'loved', 'ones', 'sudden', 'discovery', 'cure', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'when', 'future', 'generations', 'are', 'finally', 'released', 'tyranny', 'AIDS', 'movies', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'remind', 'time', 'when', 'world', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'carefree', 'place', 'when', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'devoted', 'friends', 'was', 'guarantee', 'immunity', 'loss', 'devastation']",N/A

For anyone, who like myself lived through this devastating period of darkness it's so much more. It's the story of what it was to be there, to see your beloved circle of friends wiped out in record numbers and record time.I was in college, living in Boston and can remember a tiny little article in the press about ""Gay Cancer"" and what was soon later refereed to as ""Grid""More than 20,000 people had perished and still the government resisted the urging of the CDC to invest in research, public education and care. It wasn't until over 35,000 young men had died in searing agony - and a heterosexual woman with AIDS made the cover of Time Magazine that Reagan mentioned for the first time the word ""AIDS"".The world owes an incredible debt of thanks to Larry Kramer who founded GMHC (the gay men's health crisis) a grass roots organization that provided meals, legal assistance to fight ( the then legal) evictions of AIDS sufferers from their homes and negotiate with insurance companies.Now an enormous entity of services and a beacon of hope GMHC remains today one of the most significant, far reaching organizations dedicated to education and prevention of the HIV virus and AIDS in the world.The film brings all this to bear, without grandstanding or blame. But rather through a glimpse in to the lives of a close group of friend whose world and relationships are shattered and how the survivors are forever changed as they rise from the ashes.The cast is sensational in every respect, Bruce Davidson who is all to often terribly under rated turns in one of his finest performances, the scenes of him caring for his ailing partner are of the most quiet beauty and yet almost to painful to watch.Cambell Scott, Dermot Mulroney, Mary - Louis- Parker are all at the top of their game. In fact, Longtime Companion has been touted as one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting there is - and it deserves that accolade.No one performance carries the film, we get to know these characters, we care about them, we laugh with them and weep with them. That's powerful film making.Director Norman Rene moves the story along with a quiet grace, peppered with great humor and equally deep pain it is without question a masterful feat.This is of course the story of how - at this time in history Gay people were ignored and left to die.It's the story of how we fought back and how we took care of our own. But the message is universal. Any person regardless of whom they love, if they have the capacity to love they will be forever moved by Longtime Companion.For I think even more than it's very subject matter, this a story of hope and the triumph of the human spirit.",5,Brilliant Unforgettable Film,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2727,"['suppose', 'many', 'would', 'consider', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'period', 'piece', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'devastating', 'period', 'darkness', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'there', 'see', 'beloved', 'circle', 'friends', 'wiped', 'out', 'record', 'numbers', 'record', 'time.I', 'was', 'college', 'living', 'Boston', 'can', 'remember', 'tiny', 'little', 'article', 'press', 'Gay', 'Cancer', 'what', 'was', 'soon', 'later', 'refereed', 'Grid', 'More', '20,000', 'people', 'had', 'perished', 'still', 'government', 'resisted', 'urging', 'CDC', 'invest', 'research', 'public', 'education', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", '35,000', 'young', 'men', 'had', 'died', 'searing', 'agony', 'heterosexual', 'woman', 'AIDS', 'made', 'cover', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'Reagan', 'mentioned', 'first', 'time', 'word', 'AIDS', '.The', 'world', 'incredible', 'debt', 'thanks', 'Larry', 'Kramer', 'who', 'founded', 'GMHC', 'gay', 'men', 'health', 'crisis', 'grass', 'roots', 'organization', 'provided', 'meals', 'legal', 'assistance', 'fight', 'then', 'legal', 'evictions', 'AIDS', 'sufferers', 'homes', 'negotiate', 'insurance', 'companies.Now', 'enormous', 'entity', 'services', 'beacon', 'hope', 'GMHC', 'today', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'far', 'reaching', 'organizations', 'dedicated', 'education', 'prevention', 'HIV', 'virus', 'AIDS', 'world.The', 'film', 'bear', 'grandstanding', 'blame', 'rather', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'close', 'group', 'friend', 'world', 'relationships', 'are', 'shattered', 'how', 'survivors', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'rise', 'ashes.The', 'cast', 'sensational', 'respect', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'who', 'often', 'terribly', 'rated', 'turns', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'scenes', 'caring', 'ailing', 'partner', 'are', 'most', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'yet', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch.Cambell', 'Scott', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Mary', 'Louis-', 'Parker', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'fact', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'been', 'touted', 'one', 'finest', 'pieces', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'accolade.No', 'one', 'performance', 'film', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'care', 'laugh', 'weep', 'powerful', 'film', 'making.Director', 'Norman', 'Rene', 'story', 'quiet', 'grace', 'peppered', 'great', 'humor', 'equally', 'deep', 'pain', 'question', 'masterful', 'feat.This', 'course', 'story', 'how', 'time', 'history', 'Gay', 'people', 'were', 'ignored', 'left', 'die.It', 'story', 'how', 'fought', 'back', 'how', 'took', 'care', 'own', 'message', 'universal', 'person', 'regardless', 'whom', 'love', 'have', 'capacity', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'moved', 'Longtime', 'Companion.For', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'very', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'hope', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

I thought before seeing the film I probably wouldn't enjoy a motion picture that depicted the lives of a bunch of gay men dealing with the early days of AIDS, but I was wrong. The film is touching, realistic, and funny and was the first Hollywood film to tackle the AIDS epidemic even before ""Philadelphia"". Critics raved over the film for both its intelligence over a controversial subject matter and its fine performances.The movie opens in July, 1981 the time when the first reported cases of a mysterious ""gay cancer"" was killing gay men. The disease didn't even have a name yet, but people were getting sick and dying by the hundreds. ""Longtime Companion"" shows how this group of gay men (a family of choice) comes to turns in dealing with this dreadful disease, how AIDS ultimately cost many of them their lives, and how the ones that did survive went on.The movie is an amazing film in that it shows how little was known about AIDS in the early days and how far, in 2011, we have come with research, prevention, and the AIDS cocktail that has led many to live normal and healthy lives.Bruce Davision, who played one of the leads, received an Academy Award for Best Actor, and is one of the few actors to receive such an honor for playing an openly gay character.Another film that deals with the AIDS epidemic is ""An Early Frost"", a TV film that aired in 1985 which also dramatizes the early years of the epidemic.",5,"""Simply A Great Film""",1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,1514,"['remember', 'going', 'movie', 'theatre', 'seeing', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'seeing', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'motion', 'picture', 'depicted', 'lives', 'bunch', 'gay', 'men', 'dealing', 'early', 'days', 'AIDS', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'touching', 'realistic', 'funny', 'was', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'tackle', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'even', 'Philadelphia', 'Critics', 'raved', 'film', 'intelligence', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'fine', 'performances.The', 'movie', 'July', '1981', 'time', 'when', 'first', 'reported', 'cases', 'mysterious', 'gay', 'cancer', 'was', 'killing', 'gay', 'men', 'disease', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'name', 'yet', 'people', 'were', 'getting', 'sick', 'dying', 'hundreds', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'how', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'family', 'choice', 'turns', 'dealing', 'dreadful', 'disease', 'how', 'AIDS', 'ultimately', 'cost', 'many', 'lives', 'how', 'ones', 'did', 'survive', 'went', 'on.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'film', 'how', 'little', 'was', 'known', 'AIDS', 'early', 'days', 'how', 'far', '2011', 'have', 'come', 'research', 'prevention', 'AIDS', 'cocktail', 'led', 'many', 'live', 'normal', 'healthy', 'lives.Bruce', 'Davision', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'leads', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'receive', 'honor', 'playing', 'openly', 'gay', 'character.Another', 'film', 'deals', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'Early', 'Frost', 'TV', 'film', 'aired', '1985', 'also', 'early', 'years', 'epidemic']",N/A
