Bram Stoker was a VERY important man--he didn't realize it at the time, but he changed the face of our culture to forever include the Vampire.

1163003,ATQDWTWVLLPFH,B0019ESNFK,Leann Harms,"[0, 0]","Dracula is perhaps one of literature's most famous monsters and although many contemporary books and movies have transformed vampires into heartthrobs and prime-time soap stars, Bram Stoker's Dracula remains a true villain. This documentary appears visually to be the work of an amateur, although the actual narrated content proves otherwise. The documentary is extremely well-researched and provides a revealing look into the life of Dracula's creator - Bram Stoker. It explores the influences of gothic and occult cultures and details how these elements appeared in other literary works as well. I think I was introduced to the novel in high school and didn't really give it much thought then. It was fascinating to learn how much time Stoker spent researching to create his legendary character.

His groundbreaking Dracula creation in 1897 was prefaced with eight years of researching European folklore.  He was dedicated to his craft and it has shown!

This film is filled with lots of great scenes and photos, mostly focusing on Bram Stoker and the novel he spent 8 years gathering information for: Dracula.  Although Mr. Stoker wasn't the one who invented the idea of vampires, he's definitely the author who is synonymous with the name Dracula.  Because of his book, written over 100 years ago, people today are as hooked on vampires as they were over a century ago.  Whether you find them intriguing or frightening--or a little of both--without Bram Stoker vampire lore may have faded into oblivion.  Diary of a Vampire also gets into occult secrets hidden in the works of authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne.  This film is a must-see for anyone interested in vampires and their history, as well as Bram Stoker and how the novel Dracula came to be born.",4,A Must-See For Vampire Lovers,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,952,"['way', 'DVD', 'started', 'opening', 'credits', 'expected', 'be', 'really', 'cheesy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'filled', 'lots', 'great', 'scenes', 'photos', 'mostly', 'focusing', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'novel', 'spent', '8', 'years', 'gathering', 'information', 'Dracula', 'Mr.', 'Stoker', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'invented', 'idea', 'vampires', 'definitely', 'author', 'who', 'synonymous', 'name', 'Dracula', 'book', 'written', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'people', 'today', 'are', 'hooked', 'vampires', 'were', 'century', 'ago', 'Whether', 'find', 'intriguing', 'frightening', 'little', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'vampire', 'lore', 'may', 'have', 'faded', 'oblivion', 'Diary', 'Vampire', 'also', 'occult', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'works', 'authors', 'such', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'film', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'vampires', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'how', 'novel', 'Dracula', 'came', 'be', 'born']",Diary of a Vampire - the Legacy of Bram Stoker
