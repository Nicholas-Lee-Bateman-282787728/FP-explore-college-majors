1291440,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B002VBWHT8,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[8, 8]","I was ecstatic to preorder Doug seasons one and two from Amazon's Made On Order DVD Create A Space. Watching the first two seasons took me right back to my childhood and reminded me how truly fun and well written children's television used to be. After watching those first two seasons I began to worry Amazon might not release the remaining seasons. I can't say how happy I am to have Doug's fourth and fifth seasons. The fourth season contains the following 22 eleven minute episodes (11 full half hour episodes altogether), and two twenty-two minute holiday specials, of those the this collection is only able to give us the two specials and 20 eleven minute episodes (10 full half hour episodes, Doug's Bum Wrap and Doug's Babysitter are marked in the list below with a * as they are NOT INCLUDED in this set.):40 Doug's Math Problem/Doug's Big Feet41 *Doug's Bum Wrap*/Doug and Patti Sittin' in a Tree42 Doug Door to Door/Doug Tips the Scale43 Doug En Vogue/Doug's Mail Order Mania44 Doug's Birthday Present/ Doug's Fan Club45 Doug Runs/Doug Clobbers Patti46 Doug's Treasure Hunt/Doug's Brainy Buddy47 Doug's Ripped Off!/*Doug's Babysitter*48 Doug's in the Money/Doug's Sister Act49 Doug Throws a Party/Doug Way Out West50 Doug Graduates/Dougs Bad Trip51 Doug's Halloween Adventure52 Doug's Christmas Story(NOTE: WITH *_* on each side means it wasn't included in this set)This is such a well written show. A lot of shows nowadays aimed at preteens focus too much on the wrong things. They still try to have a lot lessons, I'll give them credit for that, but they always make the main character's lives too perfect, more perfect than I feel your average preteen feels their life is. They've stopped trying to give the audience something to relate to and started giving a young impressionable audience something to buy into. Shows nowadays, in my opinion, are rarely about relating to the common experience most of us have of feeling like underdogs, slightly out of place and just wanting so badly for a few things to go right. Doug is such a show and deserves credit for being such, it relates to it's audience but never patronizes to us and takes every issue as seriously as we did or might have at that age.As much as I love this entire series and each individual episode in it's own way I especially love season four. The end of the series run on Nickelodeon was marked by the episode Doug Graduates. It's a great episode that brings a close to Doug's time in sixth grade with his friends and deals with the anxiety many of us feel when leaving elementary school. Then I still remember watching Doug's Halloween Adventure and Doug's Christmas Story for the first time as a child of six or seven years old with my older sister who introduced me to the show. I remember taking it all so serious and wanting to know how Doug would get out of his problems at the spooky theme park ride or with Porkchop's trouble over the holidays. They don't make holiday specials the way they used to anymore.Anyone who may be worried about the quality of these episodes because they are DVD-R, I wouldn't. Like I've stated, I own the first two seasons of this show on Amazon DVD-R and they play great on all my DVD players. On top of that I own several other Nickelodeon series released on DVD-R such as Rugrats, Hey Arnold! and Rocko's Modern Life and they all play great. I tend to be a rather uptight person about things feeling 'of quality' and have never been bothered by these sets. The episode quality is that or better of the shows when they originally aired in the nineties.That said the sets do have very simple DVD menus and come in very simple DVD cases with rather basic artwork but it all looks nice enough and gets the job done. My only issue with these Nickelodeon sets, me being a purist, is that I would prefer the option of watching the opening theme before every episode but on these sets it only plays before the first episode on each disc. I believe they do this to preserve the quality of the episodes because of compression issues that could start arising and I'm aware that most people skip show openings anyway, so that said it's forgivable (despite the fact that this shows theme is so great). The other thing is not to expect any sort of special features, just the episodes themselves.Though it is a bit of a shame to not see proper DVD sets released of such a great series, if you're like me and many others and love these episodes you'll want to be able to own them and this is a great way to do it and to possibly convince Nickelodeon there would be a market for their older series in proper sets. I still hope that one day we'll see shows like Doug and Rugrats in proper sets with possible special features and remastered quality but until then I can't recommend this product enough. FIVE STARS based on the quality of the previous sets and the quality of the episodes themselves.
