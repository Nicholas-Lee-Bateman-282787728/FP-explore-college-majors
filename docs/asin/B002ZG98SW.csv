1309226,A3PHUMOFCIFUGF,B002ZG98SW,Alexander Liu,"[5, 6]","Like the unfortunate organ re-donors in this science-fiction thriller that have been rebuilt from borrowed parts, so too does Repo Men suffer the fate of being a movie built upon the foundations of many a science fiction cult classic.This is all a truly tragic fate, considering the moments of sheer brilliance present in this all too familiar cautionary tale set amidst an all too familiar dystopian future. In 2025, top-dog Remy (Jude Law) has the thankless task of brutally repossessing the artificial organs for which their owners have defaulted payments on. He does so with surgical precision until that one day, when a fateful slice would open Remy's own heart to the plight of humanity.With a plot largely transplanted from Fahrenheit 451 into the world of Repo: The Genetic Opera, cauterized with a sprinkling of Blade Runner and more than a few stitches of Brazil, Repo Man may have become in itself a cautionary tale against a clockwork picture. Also starring Forest Whitaker and Alice Braga, Repo Men is an unapologetically gory affair, fast paced and frenetic, yet suffering from uneven heavy-handedness.While newcomer Miguel Sapochnik excels at juggling the dramatic with the sterile action set pieces with the deft hands of an early Steven Spielberg or John Carpenter, the picture ultimately suffers in his inability to skillfully suture together those crucial visual clues, thus telegraphing the ending well in advance to anyone paying attention, though having a `borrowed' ending once again does not help matters much either.Yet in spite of this, the picture remains an enjoyable, if not d&eacute;j&agrave; vu invoking thrill ride. One cannot help but root for the protagonist and empathize with the surprisingly layered, if not clich&eacute;d, antagonists. Though it may lack the explosive intensity of a Michael Bay film for example, the intimate storytelling places attention not so much on the action, but rather on the situations, allowing audiences to better connect with this character driven piece than the more visually oriented science fiction action films.As such, it should be unsurprising that the cast is mainly comprised of dramatic heavy-hitters that outperform the picture. It is a bold and unusual move, and certainly strange to see not one action marquee name among the cast, with the possible exception of Liev Schreiber. And projecting a more tortured soul than the genre would normally call for, Jude Law, who only recently joined the action scene with his debut in Sherlock Holmes, joins the cast in elevating Repo Men to a clockwork movie actually worth winding.If only it had been more original, perhaps Repo Men would have become a classic in its own right. However, for a flawed experiment, it still remains one hell of an enjoyable ride.",5,Repossessing Cinema,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,2781,"['unfortunate', 'organ', 're-donors', 'science-fiction', 'thriller', 'have', 'been', 'rebuilt', 'borrowed', 'parts', 'so', 'too', 'Repo', 'Men', 'suffer', 'fate', 'being', 'movie', 'built', 'foundations', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'cult', 'classic.This', 'truly', 'tragic', 'fate', 'considering', 'moments', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'present', 'too', 'familiar', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'set', 'amidst', 'too', 'familiar', 'dystopian', 'future', '2025', 'top-dog', 'Remy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'thankless', 'task', 'brutally', 'repossessing', 'artificial', 'organs', 'owners', 'have', 'defaulted', 'payments', 'so', 'surgical', 'precision', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'fateful', 'slice', 'would', 'open', 'Remy', 'own', 'heart', 'plight', 'humanity.With', 'plot', 'largely', 'transplanted', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'world', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'cauterized', 'sprinkling', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'more', 'few', 'stitches', 'Brazil', 'Repo', 'Man', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'clockwork', 'picture', 'Also', 'starring', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'Repo', 'Men', 'unapologetically', 'gory', 'affair', 'fast', 'paced', 'frenetic', 'yet', 'suffering', 'uneven', 'heavy-handedness.While', 'newcomer', 'Miguel', 'Sapochnik', 'excels', 'juggling', 'dramatic', 'sterile', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'deft', 'hands', 'early', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'picture', 'ultimately', 'inability', 'skillfully', 'suture', 'together', 'crucial', 'visual', 'clues', 'thus', 'telegraphing', 'ending', 'well', 'advance', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'having', 'borrowed', 'ending', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'much', 'either.Yet', 'spite', 'picture', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'd', 'eacute', 'j', 'agrave', 'vu', 'invoking', 'thrill', 'ride', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'protagonist', 'empathize', 'surprisingly', 'layered', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'antagonists', 'may', 'lack', 'explosive', 'intensity', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'film', 'example', 'intimate', 'storytelling', 'places', 'attention', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'rather', 'situations', 'allowing', 'audiences', 'better', 'connect', 'character', 'piece', 'more', 'visually', 'oriented', 'science', 'fiction', 'action', 'films.As', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'unsurprising', 'cast', 'mainly', 'comprised', 'dramatic', 'heavy-hitters', 'outperform', 'picture', 'bold', 'unusual', 'move', 'certainly', 'strange', 'see', 'not', 'one', 'action', 'marquee', 'name', 'cast', 'possible', 'exception', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'projecting', 'more', 'tortured', 'soul', 'genre', 'would', 'normally', 'call', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'only', 'recently', 'joined', 'action', 'scene', 'debut', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'cast', 'elevating', 'Repo', 'Men', 'clockwork', 'movie', 'actually', 'worth', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'original', 'perhaps', 'Repo', 'Men', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'However', 'flawed', 'experiment', 'still', 'one', 'hell', 'enjoyable', 'ride']",N/A

Hey Jude, take a sad song and make it better.... Jude Law stars as Remy, who repossesses organs for those who default on their payments. He has a son, a mousy wife who discourages him from his gruesome job, whom he basically abandons because he finds a hot night club singer.Remy is disconnected from his humanity. Forest Whitaker and Liev Schrieber (Everything Is Illuminated) provide some humanity and wry humor. Forest stars as Remy's sidekick; Liev stars as Remy's cynical boss. The organ reclamation scenes are suitably bloody, there are some good chase scenes. There are people who dress up as internal organs.

This movie had just started and i glimpsed through the first 15 minutes doing chores around the house. After those fifteen minutes I was sitting watching every second. This is one of those Gems that failed to get traction with the broad American audience.The stylized future setting, action scenes were top notch and the social commentary going to an extreme level of relevant issues facing this country in regards to health care. Though an extreme level, a level that can certainly be achieved given the current political winds. It struck me that Arizona has already lost several dozen people as they were cut off from funding for their transplants. Also stunning is how HMO's can become even more powerful corporations with plans to turn healthcare exclusively to the private sector which could very well go to this extreme.If you don't find interest in the social ramifications and relevance of todays isues, at the very least you will enjoy the action sequences and truly awesome soundtrack.

1309230,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002ZG98SW,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[50, 61]","Being summarily clobbered by movie-goers and critics alike, REPO MEN will obviously not be for everyone. But it will be a great movie for the right person, and I was obviously one of those ""right"" people.So who is this movie directed at and why? Well, it's a combination of a smart espionage thriller in a science fiction setting, with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. This might sound like a recipe for disaster, but it is anything but. But is it right for you? That's a tough call. If you're in the medical field and are concerned about healthcare insurance, it will definitely pique your interest. If you enjoyed such films asKill BillandBringing Out the Dead, this will be right up your alley.So why did I rate the film so high? Let's look at it for a minute...It's topical without being ""in your face."" It never tells you to believe that private insurance carriers are ""bad"" and simply shows us a ridiculous possible future where organs are built in factories and everyone who needs a pancreas, a liver, an ear, or whatever, can get one ...for a price. The Union is run by an unscrupulous business man named Frank (Liev Schreiber,Defiance). He's basically a used car salesman trying to get you to sign on the dotted line for organs you desperately need. But make sure you don't miss any payments after you've gotten your new kidney. Why? Because if you don't pay the exorbitant prices and interest rates, your organ will be repossessed. Oh yes, even if it's your heart. How will you survive without it? You won't.Remy (Jude Law,Closer) and Jake (Forest Whitaker,Where the Wild Things Are) are two of these Repo Men and they're very good at their jobs. With surgical precision, they can track and excise overdue organ owners with gory efficiency. But when Remy is forced to get a new heart and begins falling behind on payments, he begins to see the other side of his previous life.This sounds like a pretty straightforward premise. A sort of Darth Vader understanding where his son was coming from plot. And that is only partially true. Jude Law does an excellent job playing a tough-guy with absolutely no conscious about ending a person's life if their delinquent on their bill. He is absolutely believable as a disconnected man only interested in money and being a great contract employee for The Union. This is seen early on when we witness him retrieving a liver in a rapid manner, making a beautiful incision and ripping the organ out. He heads to the previous owner's sink, rinses it off, packs it up, and heads out while stepping over the now probably lifeless man. Impressive. The gore is essential here to show the audience exactly HOW disconnected Remy is from humanity.Jake, his partner, is even further gone than Remy. He enjoys his job so much that he's willing to do anything to anyone in order to ensure he and Remy can keep working together.In the midst of Remy's life is a relationship that's falling apart and a son who is the only thing that keeps him remotely grounded. But when Remy suddenly needs a heart replacement, things rapidly change. You can see the wheels spinning in the back of his head after he returns to work. Would a Repo Man come after him if he failed to pay? What does it mean to have a piece of metal in his chest where his heart used to be? Does this make him less human? Or, in some bizarre way, does it make him more human? These are questions that are left up to the audience to decide.The ending was telegraphed just enough to give it a fun twist without coming out of the blue. I kind of picked up on it after a significant fight sequence, and you might to if you pay attention. It is enough of an ""a-ha!"" moment that'll make some film watchers gasp.With the current, raw, political climate I think this film was excellently timed to hit the big screen.

Well, no way did that happen. As in Sherlock Holmes this another waste of two fine talents, Law and Whitaker. Anything of an edgy nature dissipated minutes after the start and plodded into a morality tale. Like Daybreakers, Repo Men seemed to want to redeem itself with a provocative or innovative ending. I didn't think it worked for Daybreakers and is even less effective here. As far as a morality play I think the laughable Parts: The Clonus Horror was better at hitting the mark. And gee, when even today a guy in India can reprogram my wireless computer or disconnect my satellite TV don't you think the need to hunt people down like a bounty hunter would be totally unnecessary.

THE GENETIC OPERA aside, REPO MEN takes an ingenious premise and just doesn't know where to go with it. It is a patchwork of many more successful films, with pieces of PULP FICTION, OPEN YOUR EYES, and FIGHT CLUB hastily strewn together. Jude Law and Forest Whitaker present a likable pair of working class heroes, who aren't without their fair share of humor as they scan the cities looking for customers who have skipped out on their responsibilities. The real problem is that REPO MEN attaches no deeper meaning to the concept of organ repossession, and simply uses it as a facet towards violence rather than establishing a true moral dilemma between any of the characters. With some biting cynicism and a few big action set pieces, however, REPO MEN is generic enough to appeal to the masses.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Repo Men,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1349,"['future', 'corporations', 'can', 'reclaim', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'house', 'car', 'Fall', 'organ', 'payments', 'will', 'repossess', 'lungs', 'Repo', 'Man', 'Remy', 'out', 'last', 'assignment', 'when', 'freak', 'accident', 'hospital', 'find', 'indebted', 'employer', 'Union', 'artificial', 'heart', 'keeping', 'alive', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'unable', 'pay', 'Union', 'forced', 'send', 'best', 'men', 'out', 'one', 'own', 'Similarities', 'REPO', 'THE', 'GENETIC', 'OPERA', 'aside', 'REPO', 'MEN', 'ingenious', 'premise', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'patchwork', 'many', 'more', 'successful', 'films', 'pieces', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'OPEN', 'YOUR', 'EYES', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'hastily', 'together', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'present', 'likable', 'pair', 'working', 'class', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fair', 'share', 'humor', 'scan', 'cities', 'looking', 'customers', 'who', 'have', 'skipped', 'out', 'responsibilities', 'real', 'problem', 'REPO', 'MEN', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'concept', 'organ', 'repossession', 'simply', 'facet', 'towards', 'violence', 'rather', 'establishing', 'true', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'biting', 'cynicism', 'few', 'big', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'however', 'REPO', 'MEN', 'generic', 'enough', 'appeal', 'masses.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

These scenes horrified me for only 10 minutes. After that, my horror was replaced with disgust.There was no human feeling here. Yes, there were some moments where love or friendship were depicted but they're so brief and badly done that they did not stir up any emotion at all.The idea was interesting. It's basically health care exploitation. In the fiction future, people could have  artificial internal organs implanted to replace their bad ones with high interest rate. When they defaulted, the organs would be reclaimed by ""Repo men"". These guys just killed people to take back the organs. The director should have concentrated on the suspense and love or friendship angles of the movie. That could have made it more enjoyable.The only intriguing thing was the twist at the last moment. It caught me off guard but it's very unsettling. This was the reason I gave it two starts.

1309241,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG98SW,C. Sawin,"[11, 17]","Repo Men seems to take the only thing I liked about Repo: The Genetic Opera (which was the concept of someone's organs being repossessed) and making it into a full-length film. Repo: The Genetic Opera was pretty terrible overall with a few moments of brilliance and it looked like Repo Men hoped to capitalize on that. I really like the concept, but it just seems like it's never been executed properly. After seeing this film, odds are that theory won't be put to rest.Jude Law and Forest Whitaker are easily the best part of the film. I've heard some people say that Law doesn't fit this role, but it seems to be the other way around. Law makes this role fit him. This is his story and he makes it worth sitting through. Whitaker shines during the scenes where he struggles with doing his job and helping his best friend. I'm not familiar with a lot of Whitaker's work, but he's one of those actors where his eyes tell the story better than his body language does.The over the top gore seems to be a big issue for a lot of people. As a horror aficionado, it didn't bother me much. In fact, it made me feel right at home. The gory scenes are the most memorable scenes in the film. The hallway scene in front of the pink door is easily my favorite. It may be because it reminds me of the far superior yet similar hallway sequence in Oldboy. And despite the theater not being very full, the film received a pretty big reaction during the film. The gore scenes, especially. People were applauding the pink door scene. So even if blood and gore may not be your thing, if you see this film, they'll probably be what you remember most when you're walking out of the theater.The film has a pretty fantastic ending. In fact, it felt like the action thriller had a fairly strong beginning and ending with a rather mediocre middle. Certain things about the story bothered me. After Remy gets his heart transplant, he can't find it within himself to be a repo man anymore. Even though it's ""just another job,"" all he can think about is the fact the person he's cutting open has a family. It leads one to believe that he can't kill anymore. Then later on, it shows him killing other repo men that work for The Union. Do they not have families, too? Could he kill these men because he knows the ins and outs of the job they perform everyday? There were several other similar inconsistencies throughout the film that stuck out like that (anyone else notice ""Repossession Mambo"" was misspelled in Remy's first draft of his novel?).Repo Men should have been one of my favorite films of the year, at least thus far. I love the idea of repo men repossessing organ transplants people can't pay for a little too much. That idea and two strong male leads should have made this film stellar. Other than the excessive gore (which I loved) and the questionable parts of the storyline, it's hard for me to pinpoint what exactly about the film didn't sit well with me. The film reminded me a bit of films like The Transporter and Underworld. Not so much in content, but in the sense that they were films that contained elements of things that I love but just weren't executed properly. I don't really think Repo Men is an awful film or as bad as all these ratings from top critics are making the film out to be. It's still worth seeing, but it just doesn't live up to expectations and is a bit disappointing.",3,Disappointing,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3383,"['Repo', 'Men', 'take', 'only', 'thing', 'liked', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'was', 'concept', 'someone', 'organs', 'being', 'repossessed', 'making', 'full-length', 'film', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'was', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'overall', 'few', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'looked', 'Repo', 'Men', 'hoped', 'capitalize', 'really', 'concept', 'just', 'never', 'been', 'executed', 'properly', 'seeing', 'film', 'odds', 'are', 'theory', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'rest.Jude', 'Law', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'are', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'film', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'Law', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'Law', 'role', 'fit', 'story', 'worth', 'sitting', 'Whitaker', 'scenes', 'where', 'doing', 'job', 'helping', 'best', 'friend', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'lot', 'Whitaker', 'work', 'one', 'actors', 'where', 'eyes', 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'body', 'language', 'does.The', 'top', 'gore', 'be', 'big', 'issue', 'lot', 'people', 'horror', 'aficionado', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'fact', 'made', 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'gory', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'hallway', 'scene', 'front', 'pink', 'door', 'easily', 'favorite', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'superior', 'yet', 'similar', 'hallway', 'sequence', 'Oldboy', 'theater', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'full', 'film', 'received', 'pretty', 'big', 'reaction', 'film', 'gore', 'scenes', 'especially', 'People', 'were', 'applauding', 'pink', 'door', 'scene', 'So', 'even', 'blood', 'gore', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thing', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'when', ""'re"", 'walking', 'theater.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'ending', 'fact', 'felt', 'action', 'thriller', 'had', 'fairly', 'strong', 'beginning', 'ending', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'middle', 'Certain', 'things', 'story', 'bothered', 'Remy', 'heart', 'transplant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'repo', 'man', 'anymore', 'Even', 'just', 'job', 'can', 'think', 'fact', 'person', 'cutting', 'family', 'one', 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anymore', 'Then', 'later', 'killing', 'other', 'repo', 'men', 'work', 'Union', 'Do', 'not', 'have', 'families', 'too', 'Could', 'kill', 'men', 'ins', 'outs', 'job', 'perform', 'everyday', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'similar', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'stuck', 'out', 'anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'Repossession', 'Mambo', 'was', 'misspelled', 'Remy', 'first', 'draft', 'novel', 'Men', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'year', 'least', 'thus', 'far', 'love', 'idea', 'repo', 'men', 'repossessing', 'organ', 'transplants', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'idea', 'two', 'strong', 'male', 'leads', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'stellar', 'Other', 'excessive', 'gore', 'loved', 'questionable', 'parts', 'storyline', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'film', 'reminded', 'bit', 'films', 'Transporter', 'Underworld', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'content', 'sense', 'were', 'films', 'contained', 'elements', 'things', 'love', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'executed', 'properly', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'Repo', 'Men', 'awful', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'ratings', 'top', 'critics', 'are', 'making', 'film', 'be', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'bit', 'disappointing']",N/A

That's just the case with Repo Men, filmed in 2007 but not released to theaters until 2010, when it was listed at #7 of box office flops for that year.Intriguing premise aside, Repo Men is simply too cold, too unfocused, too creepy, and way too malevolent to serve as the social commentary it wants us to believe it is.  Instead, you start to think that maybe they wanted this to be a full-out horror film (I'm speaking of the unrated version, which is what I watched).  At other times, you try to convince yourself that maybe it's a satire: the very notion of repossessing body parts that haven't been paid for is ludicrously funny.  But it doesn't fully go that route either.  What you're left with is this dark spiteful meandering mess populated with unlikable creeps who don't even rise to the status of caricatures.  Even when Jude Law's character has a literal change of heart, you wouldn't know it by the way he behaves.  Everyone strikes a single note barely sounded.  They didn't even let John Leguizamo cut loose in the all too brief role he was given (blink and you missed it).

The plot has some serious holes in it and I could not help but think that the writers did not have all their bills properly paid up, as a result some portions of the writing were repossessed. The biggest mystery that remains is how can Remy (Jude Law) who makes a descent living hacking out and repossessing organs, all of a sudden get such a dramatic change of heart, that while facing the risk of getting his own artificial heart repossessed absolutely refuses to do the job what he has been accustomed to for years.So, while he had his orginal heart, he behaved in a heartless manner, but when he got an artificial heart, he is now filled with compassion. This is a paradox.The film starts out on a solid footing, but when his nagging wife puts him out, because of his job, he gets lodging at Jake (Forest Whitaker), here the plot starts to fall apart. Eventually, he gets an artificial heart because of an accident. His wife is still no where to be seen throughout this traumatic time in his life. Can she hate Remy's job so much that she does not care if he lives of dies?Futher when the notices of late payments for the heart arrive at Remy's home, his wife in the most unconcerned way hands him the letters. This is also a very unrealistic reaction that is palmed off on the viewer.The ending is the real hack job in more ways than one.

1309254,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG98SW,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","REPO MEN may be worthy of a bit of interest in the novel form 'The Repossession Mambo' by Eric Garcia (who co-wrote the script with Garrett Lerner), but as a film it is simply silly.  After about fifteen minutes into the movie the greatest temptation is to turn it off, but since it is paid for you sit through it, hoping that it will have some redeeming graces. Mistake.Directed by neophyte Miguel Sapochnik whose credits are in art direction, the film for some reason has a number of outstanding actors attached to it: the payroll must have been big!  Jude Law and Forest Whitaker, two fine actors, play the men who repossess internal organs (kidneys, hearts, livers, joints, etc) sold to them by a company run by Liev Schreiber - a company more interested in time payments with very high interest rates (sound familiar?) than with cash up front payments.  If a recipient of one of these mechanical organs fails to pay the full amount in the given time, the Repo Men seek them out and take the organs back - leaving the buyer to simply die. The entire film is just that - killing and gory surgeries to take back or repossess organs.  A bit of a glitch pops up when we discover that Jude law has one of these hearts whose payments are past due and he and a singer - Alice Braga, niece of actress Sonia Braga - both house expired organs and are on the run from the company in the leadership of yes, Forest Whitaker.  It just gets worse as the chase moves into endless killings and raids and ridiculous situations. And the ending is a must miss.One wonders what attracted Jude Law and Forest Whitaker to this loser: more odd is why brilliant actress Carice van Houten agreed to the tiny minor and meaningless role of Jude Law's wife, or John Leguizamo singing on for an equally unimportant minor role.  Maybe there is an audience for this film, an audience who doesn't mind the concept of making fun of organ transplantation as a fraudulent business, and who can tolerate the gore that is on screen throughout the film.  It all seems a waste of talent trying hard to prevent this film from becoming a terrible bore - and failing.

1309257,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B002ZG98SW,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 3]","This is a mildly suspenseful and fairly entertaining piece of sci-fi action masquerading as satire. And therein lies the great tragedy of this film. If it had chosen to either be sci-fi action or satire, it might have been a much stronger and coherent film.The film starts out amusingly enough with Remy (Jude Law, redefining himself as a potential action hero with this film and SHERLOCK HOLMES) waiting in the darkness for a past-due client, and then systematically begins to remove his artificial liver with a glint in his eye and a song in his heart. Never mind that the clients end up either with half a functioning system, or none at all...Now, if that glint in his eye and that song in his heart continued throughout the film, REPO MEN could have been wonderful satire. But it doesn't. The film enters an almost DEMOLITION MAN-esque world (which, while a fun movie, isn't exactly the best film to emulate), filled with underground types that can either smuggle you out of the country away from the men and women of The Union (the greedy corporation that manufactures and supplies the artificial organs... and gets you hooked into the payment plans, because as Frank, portrayed by the wonderfully sleazy Liev Schreiber, explains that the pay-in-full customers don't make them any money; it's the high interest rates... sound familiar?) or they can provide you with black-market artificial organs.Of course, there are several concerns for Remy at the beginning of the film, as his nagging and haranguing wife threatens divorce if he doesn't get a sales job for The Union, and the passive-aggressive nagging of Jake (an interesting Forest Whitaker), Remy's partner and life-long friend who wants the two of them to start their own repo organization where the money is better. The concerns grow greater for Remy when, during what should be a routine repo of a heart, he is seriously injured by a defibrillator malfunction and awakens in the hospital weeks later to find that now HE has an artificial heart. So now he knows what it's like to be a victim of The Union.He then meets mystery woman Alice Braga, who is super-implanted and super past-due. The mission to save both himself and her becomes more and more dangerous as Jake is assigned to pursue Remy. It leads to strange and inexplicable action sequences and extremely slow-paced scenes to a climactic scene where the fight seems to somewhat copy the corridor fight scene from OLDBOY (with a great deal less effectiveness), and a finale that I should have seen coming, because is one of those twisty endings that re-introduces something that is discussed earlier in the film in some detail and then is left out until the very end... because when a deus ex machina is needed to end a film, you have to talk about it or show it in detail near the opening so that people will forget about it and then bring it back for the climax and then people say, ""Oh, yeah... now I remember. How clever!"" You know, like the cook in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, or Martin Riggs' ability to escape from strait-jackets in LETHAL WEAPON 2? I know... how original.Law is blithe and light on his feet as he always is, and brings as much out of Remy as is written for him. Whitaker is very... strange in this film. It seems like such an out-of-place role for him to take. This is not to say that he's bad; he just looks uncomfortable. Braga is pretty much useless in this film, which is a shame because she's a very talented actress. The actor that is most at-home in this film is Liev Schrieber, who is always fun as the smarmy corporate jerk who makes you laugh with how delightfully amoral he can be. This is a role that he's played before, but he's good at it. And director Miguel Sapochnik shows no real flair for giving us a world we haven't seen before, which is really what good futuristic sci-fi should include.In the final analysis, REPO MEN starts out with a great deal of promise, and fails to deliver on that specific promise, but turns out a very average futuristic actioner.",3,Tries too hard to be a different film than what it is.,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,4025,"['mildly', 'suspenseful', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'masquerading', 'satire', 'therein', 'great', 'tragedy', 'film', 'had', 'chosen', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'satire', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger', 'coherent', 'film.The', 'film', 'out', 'amusingly', 'enough', 'Remy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'redefining', 'potential', 'action', 'hero', 'film', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'waiting', 'darkness', 'past-due', 'client', 'then', 'systematically', 'remove', 'artificial', 'liver', 'glint', 'eye', 'song', 'heart', 'mind', 'clients', 'end', 'up', 'either', 'functioning', 'system', 'none', 'Now', 'glint', 'eye', 'song', 'heart', 'continued', 'film', 'REPO', 'MEN', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'satire', ""n't"", 'film', 'almost', 'DEMOLITION', 'MAN-esque', 'world', 'fun', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'film', 'emulate', 'filled', 'underground', 'types', 'can', 'either', 'smuggle', 'country', 'away', 'men', 'women', 'Union', 'greedy', 'corporation', 'artificial', 'organs', 'hooked', 'payment', 'plans', 'Frank', 'portrayed', 'wonderfully', 'sleazy', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'pay-in-full', 'customers', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'high', 'interest', 'rates', 'sound', 'familiar', 'can', 'provide', 'black-market', 'artificial', 'organs.Of', 'course', 'are', 'several', 'concerns', 'Remy', 'beginning', 'film', 'nagging', 'haranguing', 'wife', 'threatens', 'divorce', ""n't"", 'get', 'sales', 'job', 'Union', 'passive-aggressive', 'nagging', 'Jake', 'interesting', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Remy', 'partner', 'life-long', 'friend', 'who', 'two', 'start', 'own', 'repo', 'organization', 'where', 'money', 'better', 'concerns', 'grow', 'greater', 'Remy', 'when', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'routine', 'repo', 'heart', 'seriously', 'injured', 'defibrillator', 'malfunction', 'awakens', 'hospital', 'weeks', 'later', 'find', 'now', 'HE', 'artificial', 'heart', 'So', 'now', 'what', 'be', 'victim', 'Union.He', 'then', 'mystery', 'woman', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'who', 'super-implanted', 'super', 'past-due', 'mission', 'save', 'becomes', 'more', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Jake', 'assigned', 'pursue', 'Remy', 'strange', 'inexplicable', 'action', 'sequences', 'extremely', 'slow-paced', 'scenes', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'fight', 'somewhat', 'copy', 'corridor', 'fight', 'scene', 'OLDBOY', 'great', 'deal', 'less', 'effectiveness', 'finale', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'one', 'twisty', 'endings', 're-introduces', 'something', 'discussed', 'earlier', 'film', 'detail', 'then', 'left', 'out', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'needed', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'talk', 'show', 'detail', 'opening', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'forget', 'then', 'bring', 'back', 'climax', 'then', 'people', 'say', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'now', 'remember', 'How', 'clever', 'know', 'cook', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'Martin', 'Riggs', 'ability', 'escape', 'strait-jackets', 'LETHAL', 'WEAPON', '2', 'know', 'how', 'original.Law', 'blithe', 'light', 'feet', 'always', 'as', 'much', 'Remy', 'written', 'Whitaker', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'out-of-place', 'role', 'take', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'just', 'uncomfortable', 'Braga', 'pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'film', 'shame', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'actor', 'most', 'at-home', 'film', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'who', 'always', 'fun', 'smarmy', 'corporate', 'jerk', 'who', 'how', 'delightfully', 'amoral', 'can', 'be', 'role', 'played', 'good', 'director', 'Miguel', 'Sapochnik', 'real', 'flair', 'giving', 'world', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'really', 'what', 'good', 'futuristic', 'sci-fi', 'should', 'include.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'REPO', 'MEN', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'promise', 'deliver', 'specific', 'promise', 'out', 'very', 'average', 'futuristic', 'actioner']",N/A

Now apply that to the elements that compose a film.In a nutshell, this is Repo Men:  An erratic, clumsy mambo of a film that commits the worst of cinema sins - being completely unnecessary.I don't know if the production drew to a premature close, Universal cut back on their budget, or everyone's motivation came to a screeching halt amidst some crucial announcements about health care, but Miguel Sapochnik's unnecessary mix of low-brow/high-brow cinema encompasses all the grace of a drunk lumberjack dancing on a paint mixer.Lacking any real creativity aside from a few instances of intriguing cinematography and fight choreography, this is a film that can't stand to keep its tongue planted firmly in cheek for too long before it needs to deliver an unjustifiably didactic scene that succeeds in leaving a sour taste and negating its redeeming qualities.Again referring to clumsy erraticism:  I'm not subtle in my love for a movie with excellent pacing.  It keeps me comfortable, and strengthens the opportunity for multiple viewings.  Repo Men fails in this regard, and its a crucial blow that prevents me from suggesting this movie to many people.  I honestly cannot recall many of the events that ultimately draw the two protagonists to the pivotal plot points; it just lacks the necessary weight to be anything aside from something that delivers them from point A to point B, and that is unacceptable.And the destination that is point B, unfortunately, offers the audience nothing save for gratuitous violence.  It's all shock value that, for the first time in years, had me completely numb and without an ounce of exhilaration.  It was excessive long before the credits began to roll.Couple this with an absurdly pointless plot twist that shreds any feeling of satisfaction, and I'm walking out of the theatre forgetting why I came in.Sapochnik is not without his eye for the intriguing elements, and there is an argument of ""timeliness"" in regards to its premise, but there was much work to be done that was left on the cutting room floor, and the film suffers because of it.The majority of its redeeming qualities lie in some of the performances.  Law and Whitaker's bromance never really loses its authenticity, and the latter's efforts really make me feel for the guy;  Poor Forest just cannot seem to shake his box office flops, even after that well deserved academy award a few years ago.In retrospect, it does seem that the positives that accompany ""Repo Men"" are decidedly scarce.  I do not deny this matter.  Yet, for all of its stumbles, it's got vision, and you can always commend someone for that.  It's cheap, inconsistent, and altogether useless, but it's vision, just the same.

Indeed, and please add a notch to his acting credentials because he is convincing in his buffed up body.Jude Law has always exuded a bit of effeminate presence, like the refined Ashley inGone with the Wind. But here, he plays a survivor of the mean streets, then a solder returned from war with nothing to do but continue his violent behavior. However, he finds the perfect job which utilizes all his skills--as a repo man. In this bleak look at a dystopian future, the medical world has landed the perfect product--retrievable and permanent body parts. Heck, sell them to anyone because if they don't pay, the part is repossessed by the Repo Man, who wears an identifying tatoo on his neck.Although the ineffable Forest Whitaker lends strong support (as always), Law still stands on his own. Frankly, I was impressed. As for Whitaker, no matter what role he accepts, he steps into it, making that character his, fleshing him out, making him real. In the story these two characters--Law and Whitaker--grow up together, playing violence for all it is worth in making them oblivious to the pain of others. The audience watches them in flashback snippets grow to the way of violence and know they are perfectly suited to steal into homes and confiscate body parts in arrears, knowing they are causing death. Too bad. They should have paid.Moral callousness aside, Law loves his son. To keep him, he must ask for a job in sales, not repossession. His wife insists on this change. Things happen (can't be a spoiler) and Law himself is given a heart. Not knowingly, not willingly, but through happenstance,  Law is given a heart. Entendre here. He has a heart and now reconsiders his job as a repo man.Of course, he gets behind in payments because he can no longer rip out organs as he once so indifferently did. It's his turn to lose his heart. More complications. His wife forces him out, he meets a singer he admires and learns that she is a conglomeration of artificial body parts. Whitaker is assigned to take his heart.That's about all I can relate without spoilers. I was so surprised by the ending. I can say, given the setting, given the characters, it is perfect. Unexpected, but perfect. I disagree with reviewers who find this a hodge-podge of story pieces, much like the singer's body. Instead, the disjointed story line and disconnected characters work together in creating a provocative world transposed from our current world of healthcare woes and mean street hardening of character. But the underlying message is hope--there's always hope as long as we are alive.

Their bond wasn't explored very deeply, but I did like this film's tendency to show rather than tell, with the nice background plot drivers that aren't as obvious as they could have been. The sets are great, and some of the CGI future-city shots are excellent...but that subway shot with Toronto's TTC logo? They keep saying this is set in America, despite Law's Brit accent, so why leave that hanging out there? RM has a number of sloppy bits in that vein, and the ending is a little too pat.But the idea is a good one, and although it bogs down in the middle, and the love story goes too far too fast, I was entertained and even made to think, never a bad combination.If you like futuristic sci-fi, this is a decent entry in the genre.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 2025 bio-mechanical organs are nearly perfect and can replace most of real ones if need be. However those organs as so expensive that most customers buy them on credit from the Union, a corporation which seems to have the monopoly for production and instalment of those things. In this world laws are so harsh that if a customer falls behind on payments, a ""repo man"" reclaims the artificial organ, which in almost all cases results in death. This film tells the story of two of such men, considered amongst the best in the business: Remy (Jude Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker). Their Union supervisor, Frank (Live Schreiber) also plays an important role in the story. Nothing more will be said about the story.The first 10-15 minutes of the film are really excellent albeit EXTREMELY shocking and DISTURBING. It was a genuine pleasure (although of quite dark nature) to watch them. Unfortunately, after that the film took a turn in a completely different direction and mostly became just another ""standard issue"" sci-fi/action B movie, with poorly developed characters, bad dialogs and with every next development being completely predictable.The characters of Remy (a chillingly cold guy) and Jake (exuberant, extraverted and CRUEL) were initially well thought and they could be a really extraordinary team of killers (like Travolta and Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction), but very quickly in the film the story separates them and makes them change into something much lesser and more banal.When watching this film I had the same impression as in 2005 when I saw ""Island"" with Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. In both cases the initial idea was great and very, VERY dark - but then the movie makers got scared of their own courage and softened, diluted and as the result messed up their film, replacing most of the initial shock and awe with unnecessary and rather boring action scenes and concluding the film with a rather stupid ending.Bottom line, this is a rather disappointing thing, with the exception of first 15 minutes, which are indeed worth watching. Rent rather than buy.",2,Good initial idea but after like 15 minutes somebody ripped the heart out of this film - and most of other organs too...,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2248,"['was', 'very', 'eager', 'discover', 'enjoy', 'very', 'dark', 'Sci-Fi', 'thriller', 'sadly', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'more', 'impressions', 'limited', 'SPOILERS.In', '2025', 'bio-mechanical', 'organs', 'are', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'can', 'replace', 'most', 'real', 'ones', 'need', 'be', 'However', 'organs', 'so', 'expensive', 'most', 'customers', 'buy', 'credit', 'Union', 'corporation', 'have', 'monopoly', 'production', 'instalment', 'things', 'world', 'laws', 'are', 'so', 'harsh', 'customer', 'payments', 'repo', 'man', 'artificial', 'organ', 'almost', 'cases', 'results', 'death', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'such', 'men', 'considered', 'best', 'business', 'Remy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jake', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Union', 'supervisor', 'Frank', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'also', 'important', 'role', 'story', 'Nothing', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'said', 'story.The', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'excellent', 'albeit', 'EXTREMELY', 'shocking', 'DISTURBING', 'was', 'genuine', 'pleasure', 'quite', 'dark', 'nature', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'took', 'turn', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'mostly', 'became', 'just', 'standard', 'issue', 'sci-fi/action', 'B', 'movie', 'poorly', 'developed', 'characters', 'bad', 'dialogs', 'next', 'development', 'being', 'completely', 'predictable.The', 'characters', 'Remy', 'chillingly', 'cold', 'guy', 'Jake', 'exuberant', 'extraverted', 'CRUEL', 'were', 'initially', 'well', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'team', 'killers', 'Travolta', 'Jackson', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'very', 'quickly', 'film', 'story', 'change', 'something', 'much', 'lesser', 'more', 'banal.When', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'same', 'impression', '2005', 'when', 'saw', 'Island', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'cases', 'initial', 'idea', 'was', 'great', 'very', 'VERY', 'dark', 'then', 'movie', 'makers', 'got', 'scared', 'own', 'courage', 'softened', 'diluted', 'result', 'messed', 'up', 'film', 'replacing', 'most', 'initial', 'shock', 'awe', 'unnecessary', 'rather', 'boring', 'action', 'scenes', 'concluding', 'film', 'rather', 'stupid', 'ending.Bottom', 'line', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'exception', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'indeed', 'worth', 'watching', 'Rent', 'rather', 'buy']",N/A

It featured a popular star at the time (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as a working class character climbing the social ladder but stymied by the class ceiling that is his lot in life. When circumstances lead him to a new form of immersive technology, his life goes sideways.  In the end, we're not sure if he's living a fantasy or if he really did have all the adventures that made the movie so much fun.Or maybe you've seen Brazil.  Due to a clerical error, an office worker who help track down terrorists becomes caught up in the bureaucracy his job enables.  On screen the protagonist is a superhero, but in reality he is hooked up to a virtual reality interrogation device.Repo Men's a lot like that.  But instead of allowing the audience to make up its mind as to what happened to the protagonist, it punches you in the face with the truth instead.Repo Men pretends to have a higher calling - that it's actually about corporate culture, about modern issues with healthcare, about the working class and its relationship with corporate America.  And those connections are certainly there, but that hardly modernizes or differentiates Repo Men, as Total Recall and Brazil demonstrate. It's all been done before.Fortunately, Repo Men has a sense of humor about it all.  Remy's (Jude Law) narration is a welcome change of pace when Repo Men tends to drag, and his dialogue contains clues about the ending (count those numbers of knockouts carefully!). The scenes of Remy and Jake's (Forest Whitaker) misadventures are priceless.The film's saving grace is that what turns into a series of unbelievable stunts is excused by the final twist, which undoes much of what went before.  The twist doesn't cover up Repo Men's flawed plot however, which does back flips to get its oppressor into the shoes of the oppressed.In the end, Repo Men is a gory reminder that you get what you pay for.

They repossess body parts when the clients/patients are unable to pay. Inflating prices and increased interest rates  (they work for a large company whose bottom line is cold hard cash) have made the organ transplant business quite profitable.Childhood friends, Remy and Jake seem to enjoy their work (repossessing body parts without anesthesia), and go thru life kicking butt and taking body parts back. When Remy undergoes a life changing accident, he soon finds himself on the wrong side of a repo when he can no longer afford to pay for his new heart. Rejected by his wife, avoiding a greedy boss and eager co-workers, falling in love with a woman (who is more new parts than original), Remy runs for his life and hopes to bring the company down.Overall, I think RepoMen provided an interesting premise with a satisfying conclusion. There were startling revelations (that in the scheme of things made sense) and twists and turns at every turn.

Here, the most disturbing acts in The Repo Men were the removal of organs from living people or implanting organs with total disregard to the boundaries of biology. Aside from the criminal and unethical murder of people who could not pay their mortgage on time, cutting skin and missing with deep living tissue, on the fly, with the patients walking, taking, and moving with deeply opened tissues, is moronic. The risk/benefit balance of breaching the laws of biology to grip the minds of the viewers favors disgust and disdain over fear, shock, or awe.The talented and motivated actors and actresses who entrusted the movie maker to make them shine, ended up carving a foolish play that would not stand the test of consumer approval.Once you get the zest of the childish design of the story, you start asking many questions that lead to the same conclusion: the story is poorly written.  The high-tech company could design, sell, and trace its products to people through electronic tracking and remote system, yet it could not disable those sold devises when a customer defaults on payment.

This movie has a feel that this could actually happen in the future. The premise is basically a company called Union basically controls everything (Government, police, etc) and they give body parts to people who need them and allows you to make a ""good"" payment plan that fits to your needs. (Yeah these organs cost in excess of 600K). If you don't make payments for over three months they come after you and are allowed to cut you open and repossesses those organs.The story takes that idea and you follow a pair of repo men doing their ""job"" and have known each other for years. The wife of one of them wants him to go to sales because she doesn't like him being out late (Typical movie wife, controlling, married to him for a long time and all of a sudden she has a problem, blah blah blah) and it goes from there. While I love the whole repo men story, the wife thing got annoying fast.The gore is great, and in the unrated version of the movie it's so over the top it's great. With a premise of cutting people open and taking their organs, you have to have it be believable and they pull it off. This takes place in the future, but it's a not too far off future.

It's a great premise: a film about repossessing body parts when people can't pay, slick-talking salesmen that talk ""customers"" into payment plans that they can't afford with 20% interest because that's where the big money is! But you get all that within the first 15 minutes or so of the film, so I was concerned about what they were going to do with the rest of the story. I was even more concerned when they brought in the romantic relationship element to the story, nothing kills a good Sci Fi flick more than that! However, the ending.....The movie reminded me of several other movies, including ""Minority Report"", ""AI"" (which Jude Law had a part in), and ""Vanilla Sky."" I don't want to give out a spoiler here for the ending, but I didn't see it coming, and I'm usually that guy that sees these types of twists coming! Although I did recognize the beach & palm tree as being a scene on one of the subway stops that they showed when he was talking with his son on the train, so I knew something was up. But I didn't expect that!Many reviewers seem disappointed with the film, and I haven't seen Repo: The Genetic Opera that others say this movie is patterned after, so I can't comment on that. But I haven't even heard of that other film, and I doubt many others have either. So this movie seemed like new ground to me! There is a lot of gore in the film, but it didn't bother me at all. Those that have been through Med School or Biology labs will feel right at home! Though I thought most of the film was 3-stars, the surprise ending leaves me feeling it deserves 4-stars.

1309288,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B002ZG98SW,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Repo Men(released Mar/10)stars,among others,Jude Law,Forest Whitaker,Liev Schreiber and Alice Braga.If you think this is just another remake of the /84 film Repo Man,think again.This film goes beyond the simple concept of that film,whose premise about the world of the folks who repossess goods to pay back debts was both serious and funny.No this film is serious all the way,with a decidedly sharper edge to it.The film's premise here is based around the two main characters of the film,Whittaker and Law.They are a couple of guys whose relationship extends back to public school,through the service and now as Repo Men.But this isn't modern day but 2025.The two work for a huge conglomerate whose main function is to offer VERY pricey body replacement parts to clients.Law and Whittaker go after those who default in their payments by literally taking possession of the replacement organs on the spot.The fact that the person more often than not dies,is of no consequence.Also the company actually prefers a default,as they end up making more money! A company with a heart.The film follows these two amigos through their ""routine"" days.Law's marriage shows signs of severe strain and Law has openly suggested to his pal that he might be transferring off the street and into sales.However during a routine repo of a man's heart,Law's defib unit short circuits,almost killing him.When Law comes to he's laying in a hospital bed with one of his companies artificial hearts inside him.Law wants it out,but unfortunately cannot survive without it.When Law leaves the hospital and goes home his wife coldly gives him his briefcase and he is out on the street.He heads to Whittaker's for a place to crash.Soon the two are back out in the street but something has occurred with Law.It seems he no longer has the stomach to repossess organs any longer,try what he might.He tries inside sales,but cannot survive in that environment.His pal even goes to the extent one night of going to an old run down apartment complex and gets him two victims with which to extract their organs.He cannot perform his job and gets knocked out.When he comes to he finds a woman who is strung out on drugs.He takes her to a local motel and dries her out.Law,who has fallen way behind on his own organ payments due to his inability to do his job,tries to get his record expunged,but it goes nowhere.He,along with his new friend,are on the run from his own organization.The two hole up in the old apartment complex until one day one of Law's associates comes looking for him.The two set a trap for the repo man and get him but his lady pal gets hurt in the process.Law takes her to get her knee repaired at a black market facility.The two then head back to see Law's boss who is less than sympathetic to their predicament.They then flee to the airport where they are discovered and barely manage to escape,as Whittaker looks on.Whittaker tracks the two down to the apartment of an old friend of Law's gal pal.A scuffle occurs and Law goes down for the count and Whittaker gets hit by a stun gun by Law's girlfriend.Law does learn an important thing;Whittaker is the one who short circuited Law's defib unit,so he would stay a repo man!When the two awake the entire apartment complex is under a major corporate raid.The two end up in a safe room with other recalcitrant organ recipients.Law decides the only way to end the endless harassment is to go to corporate headquarters and somehow wipe out all the default accounts.It is certainly not an easy road and it takes Law and his girl a while to fight their way through overwhelming odds and into the secure room with the central accounts computer.The job now is to scan each others implants to get the ball rolling and it is painful,and both come close to death more than once.Just as it almost finished,Whittaker and his boss enter the room.The boss wants the two taken down but Whittaker takes out the boss for his old friend.Whittaker ends up putting two explosives into the computer system and blows it.Next we see,Law,his girlfriend and Whittaker relaxing on a Caribbean beach.Soon though the scene becomes unstable and we see it is all in Law's mind,as he is being taken out of the apartment complex where he and Whittaker fought.Law has been implanted with a new neural device which will keep him is his new ""world"" for the rest of his life.The major drawback to this film that I saw,lies in two areas:the length/editing which led to a clumsy and sometimes stop-start type of feeling,and the other being the violence,when organs are extracted and we see every little gory detail.More than once I just had to wince looking at it.I thought this type of gratuitous detail could have been greatly toned down and the movie wouldn't have suffered one iota.Otherwise all participants are good in their respective parts and I thought the idea to be a nice twist on an old idea.The film was shot,btw,in and around Toronto.Technically speaking it is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Both the theatrical and extended versions are on board here.Extras include commentary,a featurette,film commercials and deleted scenes.All in all a nice and well acted concept.The film could have used more judicious editing and the violence needn't have been so explicit.3 1/2- 4 stars.",4,Interesting take on the Repo Man,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,5304,"['Repo',

There are some pretty gory scenes of internal organs being ripped out of people. That is not something you want to see while eating. Now if your planning on eating while watching this movie be warned. This is your typical action movie with a moral issue. If you were into ""I Robot"" this was pretty close to that. This is more of a suspense thriller with some action compared to ""I Robot"" that had more action. There are plenty of action scenes, enough to make action fans happy. The only problem is Forrest Whitaker. You just can't get in to his character. Whitaker seems to be a great B-movie actor. Whitaker doesn't quite fit in with Jude Law as best friends. Also Jude Law's character felt a little flat and that could be because of what he was feeding off from Whitaker. This movie had the potential to be more but it is a good b-movie film. This is not a movie you would spend the price of a theater ticket on. This is your typical rental movie that you would pay a dollar on red box. This movie was just ok.

The catch is that like cars and houses, if you fall behind on payments for your organs, they will be repossessed by repo men, individuals who can legally break into your house or chase you down on the street, cut you open, and take the organs back.Remy and Jake, played by Jude Law and Forest Whitaker, are two childhood friends/army buddies who also went into the repo business together. They work for the Union Bank, where their smarmy boss talks desperate organ patients into purchasing the organs on one hand, and has Remy, Jake, and others taking the organs back on the other hand. Jake is happy working with his buddy. Remy, on the other hand, is getting pressure from his wife to switch to something that less dangerous, like organ sales. Remy and Jake debate the pros and cons of his leaving the repo live, and he continues to ply his trade until a work accident turns him from not only being a organ repossessor, but an organ owner with a brand new heart.The accident totally changes Remy's perspective. He sees his the banks clients as human beings, and not just people who no longer deserve to life because they got behind on bank payments. Soon, Remy's heart is targeted to be repossessed. He goes on the run, and runs into a young woman who has lots of organs to be repossessed. Then, they go on the run together...The performances are very good. That's not the problem. The problem is that in the audience, who has already had to deal with gore related to the organs being reharvested, is subjected to even more gore as Remy fights against his pursuers. But even more disturbing is the ending, which was probably meant to be clever, but ends up pulling the rug out from under the audience.Repo Men could have been great.

And actions in ""Repo Men"" are sometimes very violent, with characters using knuckles and knives.The story itself is rather simple. In the near future you can buy artificial organs on credit. A kidney, a lung or even a heart. But if you cannot keep up with the payment, a ""repo-man"" hired by the company are sent to you to repossess what you have purchased.  This usually means ending the purchaser's life, but Jude Law's Remy, working with his long-time partner Jake (Forest Whitaker), often seems to be enjoying himself. Maybe he is.But something happens when he is doing the final job. He changes from an efficient repo man to something else, and his life changes completely when he meets a mysterious girl named Beth (Alice Braga), a singer he had met before.The story of ""Repo Men"" is not particularly original, something you might find in films dealing with a dystopian society.

So maybe Jude moved from England but then the back story is that he has a history with his partner that goes back to childhood and includes the military. So why does he have an accent?

1309303,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B002ZG98SW,Westley,"[3, 6]","What a disappointment!  Jude Law and Forest Whitaker play partners working for ""The Union,"" a company in the near future that manufactures and sells artificial organs.  Fortunately, this medical miracle means that people no longer have to wait on donor lists for a kidney or other organ, and they can even augment their existing organs to work better.  However, these organs are extremely expensive, and The Union makes a great deal of their profits by essentially giving people a mortgage for their organs.  Of course, if they default on the loan, then there will be a price.  Repossession.  That's where Law and Whitaker come in as the titular repo men.  They're among the best in the business and make a lot of money, but harvesting artificial organs from people can eat away at one's soul.The setup is fairly intriguing, and ""Repo Men"" could have been a decent movie.  However, other than the clever scenario, almost nothing about the movie is original, and there are some very unlikeable parts as well.  Let's start with a few positives.  First, Jude Law is, as usual, a very competent if distant leading man here.  The movie effectively incorporates classic jazz songs into the soundtrack, such as ""Feelin' Good"" by Nina Simone (although some people might feel uneasy with the juxtaposition of these classics and the movie's gore).  Finally, Alice Braga makes an atypical (if rather bland) leading lady.Whatever positives the movie has are far outweighed by numerous problems.  First, the scenes of the organ harvesting are really gross, which adds absolutely nothing to the movie.  Second, the movie should have been no more than 90 minutes but drones on for just over 2 hours.  My biggest problem with the movie, though, was that we are supposed to root for Law as he fights against The Union.  However, in the process, he mostly has to fight (and kill) faceless security people who haven't done anything wrong.  That these scenes are so bloody doesn't help.  Indeed, the movie gets surprisingly gory and violent toward the end for no good reason.  The movie goes from simply boring and overlong to really terrible during the last 20 minutes or so, with a ridiculous scene set in the ""pink room.""  There are several surprise ""twists"" - none of which I saw coming.  Nor did I care.
