692151,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000062XFI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 12]","I love British comedy.  I, in fact, was having a conversation with a friend yesterday mentioning that the big difference between American comedy and British is the fact that they believe in more wit than physical humor.  I love the humor of  the BBC version of ""The Office"" as well as ""Black Books"" or ""Vicar of Dibley"" because instead of body humor or slapstick, they use their minds and command of the language.  Rowan Atkinson is an exception, but his humor defies all boundaries.  This is the reason I find myself enjoying less and less of what the major networks release, and focusing on what the BBC has to offer.  I just finished watching a great series called ""Clatterford"", which is as dry as many martinis, but still a breath of fresh air compared to things like, ""Notes from the Underbelly"", Everybody Loves Raymond"", or ""The Real Wedding Crashers"" (I realize the last doesn't quite fit, but I still need to include it among America's finest).  So, when it was presented to me to watch a BBC film release staring some of Britain's finest like Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, Dawn French, and, my favorite, Rowan Atkinson - I jumped at the chance.  I had seen through ""Nine Months"" how America took over pregnancy, now I wanted to see how the BBC would do it.  Alas, folks, all I can mention is how I wish some form of contraceptive, coupled with pain killers, were used to foil the plot and dull the pain.""Maybe Baby"" had quite a bit of potential - let me quickly list them off - a cast that is dynamite when it comes to comedy; a story that had the potential to be quite humorous, hysterical in fact; the parody of Danny Boyle could have been blown up considerably - adding to the goofiness of the plot; and finally, let me add, the cast again - Emma Thompson, Rowan Atkinson, Dawn French, and Hugh Laurie are some of the best that Britain has to offer and are typically guaranteed to make anyone in their right mind laugh.  This said, why did this film hit the ground at the fastest speed possible thoroughly, and painfully, hurting everyone in it's path.  ""Maybe Baby"" is quite possibly one of the worst films that I have seen this year because it is the biggest disappointment with such potential that I have ever witnessed.  Our story is simple to write down, but on screen it is utterly disastrous.  The BBC wants to be more cutting edge, Sam and Lucy want children but cannot conceive (does anyone see the humor yet), so we combine the pair.  Sam begins writing about his life with his wife, the trials and tribulations of medically attempting to conceive, mixed with funny jokes that somehow only make the cast members laugh.  Lucy finds out the truth, Sam grows a beard, and the end - well, is everything one would expect from an American romantic comedy.  No surprises.  No laughter.  No excitement.  Overall, I have discovered an American Hollywood film trying to pass as British intelligence.  I call it The ""Maybe Baby"" Conspiracy.I would like to begin this very negative review by saying Joely Richardson is by far one of the worst actresses I have witnessed in film.  Maybe I haven't seen enough of her work to make that sort of comment, but after seeing ""Maybe Baby"", I feel confident in my response.  Every scene was nothing but script reading and comic mis-timing.  Nothing coming from her mouth seemed worth repeating or re-watching.  She played the role of dumb blonde very, embarrassing, well.  The scenes in which she has to show emotion was like watching cardboard try to cry, and that is not an over exaggeration.  She attempts to show us a relationship with Sam (Hugh Laurie), but instead of a chemical romance, they seem to be enjoying the role of two actors playing a role.  There is nothing to evoke emotion between the two of them.  I didn't even think they were in ""love"" by the end of the film, they were a relationship of convenience and comfort.  BEWARE!  I need to add this about the remainder of the acting because this film may be misleading - Emma Thompson is in it for about three minutes, adding nothing of value or humor to the overall twist of the plot.  Rowan Atkinson is a refreshing snack, but like everyone else, adds no meat to the film (it reminded me of Robin Williams in ""Nine Months"").  Then there is Dawn French - don't get me started here because it remains pitiful and a waste of talent.  Coupled with the stagnet portrayals from the surrounding cast it just becomes a very painful moment in cinema as each minute passes.The plot is devastating.  With a clich&eacute; storyline we already know how it will end and what the characters will be doing/reacting before they probably do, I would hope the typical British wit would resonate strongly with the actor's dialogue.  That, alas, is missing from this film.  We are bombarded with characters that care nothing about money, are emotionless unless forced to be, and driven by no inner motivation outside of the paycheck.  The lyrics to this film are even painful.  There were no funny, punny, or laughable moments throughout the course of this film, which irritated me to no end.  With such a bold cast, I wanted to be rolling on the floor with hysterics, but alas, nothing happened.  The stale emotion translated well into the stale voice being heard from each of the voided characters.  I wanted charm, wit, talent, and appeal with this film.  I wanted to prove that American dictatorship over film hadn't leaked into the BBC mainstream, but again - I couldn't believe that I was that wrong.""Trainspotting"" is a film that defined a nation and brought a new wave of cinema into our theaters.  I don't think a horrid film like ""Maybe Baby"" has the right to poke fun at it.  I don't mind intelligent hobnobbery, but with this film it was just plain rude to Danny Boyle.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone even the most bland of comedy fans.  Remember, if you choose to pick up this vile cinematic sludge, this is pre- ""House"" days, so do not see Laurie as what we Americans have come to expect from him.  ""Maybe Baby"" is too big for its britches, as it tries to pack too much comedy into a nothingless film - thus transforming the comedy into a forgettable piece of garbage.  There was nothing of value in this film, and while director Ben Elton has made his name in ""Blackadder"", I don't believe he has remembered much of his upbringing.  After seeing this film, I would have to advise Elton to avoid working behind the cameras ever again.  This was a very big disappointment for me as I had big hopes for this little film with big names.The subtitle for this film should be: Never Judge A DVD By Its Cover.Grade: * out of *****",1,"""Never

I am a major Hugh Laurie fan which only happened after I discovered him in the TV series ""House"".  Now I can't get enough of this trememdously talented and very sexy actor/comedian.  I honestly wasn't even expecting much from this movie since I'd never heard of it, and I figured it was going to be a bomb that would, if nothing else, give me a couple of hours of seeing Hugh Laurie.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Not only did this movie keep me laughing throughout, but the entire cast is wonderful.  Laurie gives an outstanding performance as the insecure script writer desperately trying to conceive a baby with his wife, played by Joely Richardson who also deserves much praise for her performance.  Their relationship, though strained at times, is one of total love and devotion that is put to the test more than once by both partners.  The clever and often hysterical banter between the two is laugh out loud funny.  Rowan Atkinson, a/k/a Mr. Bean, plays Richardson's gynecologist with his usual quirky, off-the-wall style.  The actor who plays the director of Laurie's movie about their baby-making experiences (which he is having made without his wife's knowledge) will have you rolling on the floor laughing.  And, of course, there are a few tear-jerking moments here and there, but overall the movie is just plain funny.  I'm glad I discovered Hugh Laurie or I may never have seen this wonderful movie.

I chose that subject heading because that was the title that the director guy in the book of this movie wanted to call the movie that the character in the book wrote the script for. Confused? Sorry, there's no need to be. Just watch the movie and read Ben Elton's 'Inconceivable' like I did and it will all make sense!!This movie displayed fantastic English humour as well as touching romance. Not to mention tackling the sensitive subject of Infertility. You find yourself laughing at the fact that Hugh Laurie's Sam has to shove a container of man juice up his bottom to keep it warm, yet at the same time, you feel sad because no matter what they put themselves through, Sam and Lucy just can't seem to get pregnant. And to make matters worse, ignorant old Sam isn't giving Lucy the attention she deserves!!Hugh Laurie was absolutely gorgeous and Joely Richardson was stunning. It was funny yet sad, and seemed to present both a bloke's and a woman's point of view in the most honest of ways. I felt all fuzzy and lovey towards my partner afterwards, and I think it would probably have that effect mainly on people who are in a long-term relationship.The one-liners are brilliant and there are cameos from a few great English actors that we all know and love.What can I say?

Hugh Laurie is really good playing the husband Sam. He is funny, entertaining, and delivers on all his comedy scenes. The husband decides to write a script about the couple's ordeal of going through the process of conceiving. Joely Richardson is...well, delivering lines. Her acting felt more like she was reading lines rather than acting. Anyways, her character has to deal with the temptation of being with another man and also the process of trying to conceive. The movie was somewhat entertaining until my roommate asked me: &#34;If this is a comedy, why are you not laughing?&#34;. Why indeed?

There's something instantly endearing about these two, and you just want to follow along in their (at times hilarious, at times gut-wrenchingly-sad) attempts to conceive a child. This movie is written in a way that really allows you to become (perhaps reluctantly) emotionally invested in the two main characters (perfectly captured by Richardson and Laurie). I also found myself completely enamored by Hugh Laurie, not because I thought he blatantly good looking or something, but because I really felt for him as the devoted but imperfect husband.

Disproving the old adage about writing what you know, Ben Elton's horrendously arch comedy about infertility shows that only works when what you know is remotely interesting or convincing. Long before the half hour mark you'll be praying that these people be prevented from ever breeding. A string of DOA one-liners delivered by hideously OTT Britcom TV stars, Elton's direction is even worse than his script - he seems to think that because the screen is bigger than his usual sitcom turf the performances have to be too. Hugh Laurie, Adrian Lester and James Purefoy aside, it's a parade of excruciatingly unconvincing media stereotypes delivered at full volume for maximum pain, whether it's Joely Richardson proving that talent is not hereditary and demonstrating the comic timing of a whelk (and this is one of her better performances) or Rachel Stirling continuing her quest to prove herself as Britain's worst actress.
