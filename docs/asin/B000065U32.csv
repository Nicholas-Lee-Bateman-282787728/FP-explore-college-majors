700085,A3AVCOOCE94ZZ2,B000065U32,"alaskan-chatterbox ""alaskanchatterbox""","[65, 65]","Horse Crazy a delightful story of two 8 year old boys and a 7 year old girl who sneak a ride in a car to Nevada to lasso themselves three wild mustangs and ride them home.  They experience lessons of honestly, over coming fears, teamwork, and friendship that will bound them for a life time. Even the older brother (maybe 20'sh) learns how special and important his brother and sister are and a little about himself.  I don't think you have to have small children left in the house to buy this movie.  My children are grown and I still bought it.  I laughted, almost cried with delight and even found myself sitting on the edge of my seat as the kids undergone some of their adventures.  BUY IT!  I have watched it over and over again and love it even more each time I view it.I tried to rate it 5 stars but it wouldn't let me rate it.

The child actors gave strong performances and portrayed distinctive and engaging characters. The adult actors provided strong support throughout the entire movie. The scenery was fantastic and there was plenty of light humor throughout this movie. The plot wasn't quite believeable, but it wasn't so far-fetched that it wasn't enjoyable. An eight-year-old boy who dreams of owning his own horse seizes an opportunity to sneak a ride to Nevada with his older brother (who is going to visit his girl friend who he winds up dropping) in order to capture wild mustangs. Two other kids wind up sneaking along. Add a couple of horse theives into the mix and a pretty young lady to attract the interest of the older brother and things get interesting. Who would enjoy watching this movie? One audience is likely to be children under the age of ten. The pacing, humor, and action in the movie would attract this audience. The other main audience that would apprectiate this movie is adults who get a kick out of silly kid movies. This movie does a good job of presenting a captivating story without getting preachy or sappy in any way. There were a couple of moral lessons thrown in along the way, but they fit seemlessly into the plot and don't seem forced in any way. There is also a strong and appealling sub-plot in this movie involving a budding romantic relationship between two people in their early twenties which integrates quite naturally with the main plot.",4,fun and adorable,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1515,"['movie', 'was', 'fun', 'adorable', 'same', 'time', 'child', 'actors', 'gave', 'strong', 'performances', 'portrayed', 'distinctive', 'engaging', 'characters', 'adult', 'actors', 'provided', 'strong', 'support', 'entire', 'movie', 'scenery', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'plenty', 'light', 'humor', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believeable', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'far-fetched', 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'eight-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'owning', 'own', 'horse', 'opportunity', 'sneak', 'ride', 'Nevada', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'going', 'visit', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', 'up', 'dropping', 'order', 'capture', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'Two', 'other', 'kids', 'wind', 'up', 'sneaking', 'along', 'Add', 'couple', 'horse', 'theives', 'mix', 'pretty', 'young', 'lady', 'attract', 'interest', 'older', 'brother', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'One', 'audience', 'likely', 'be', 'children', 'age', 'ten', 'pacing', 'humor', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'attract', 'audience', 'other', 'main', 'audience', 'would', 'apprectiate', 'movie', 'adults', 'who', 'get', 'kick', 'silly', 'kid', 'movies', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'captivating', 'story', 'getting', 'preachy', 'sappy', 'way', 'were', 'couple', 'moral', 'lessons', 'thrown', 'way', 'fit', 'seemlessly', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'forced', 'way', 'also', 'strong', 'appealling', 'sub-plot', 'movie', 'involving', 'budding', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'early', 'twenties', 'quite', 'naturally', 'main', 'plot']",N/A

700097,A278209U4HAKKH,B000065U32,Michael Ross,"[2, 3]","Having previously viewed a full frame Allumination 2/14/2006 DVD of `Horse Crazy' from a local library, I browsed that title on Amazon.com, noticed a widescreen version was listed among the half dozen DVD versions, and wondered whether the feature was shot with the intent of being viewed at full frame or widescreen aspect. I ordered a $0.20 new DVD (plus $2.98 shipping) from an Amazon.com third party seller that was listed on the page for the 6/4/2002 full frame DVD from MTI Home Video. What I received was a DVD not described among any of the `Horse Crazy' DVDs on Amazon.com and whose cover is significantly different from any of those shown.  It arrived in a slim-pak case (half the thickness of a typical keep case) distributed by Artist View Entertainment copyrighted 2003. Neither the cover nor the disc label indicate whether it is full frame or wide screen or what its aspect ratio is. It is a 1.78:1 aspect anamorphic wide screen version of `Horse Crazy' and I was happy to see that the movie works well at that aspect. However, only about one in every four frames shows a sharp image when displayed frame-by-frame, while virtually every frame from the library's Allumination disc is sharp; still, it is worth what I paid. When its sharp frames are compared with the Allumination DVD, the top and the bottom of the Allumination image has been cropped, but it doesn't appear to add slightly more image to the sides as would be evident were it remastered from 35 mm film shot with spherical lenses. The one `Horse Crazy' wide screen DVD listed on Amazon.com lists that it was released 8/11/2009 by Good Times Home Video at 1.85:1 aspect. GoodTimes Home Video began business in 1984 distributing primarily copies of public domain titles. It expanded into GoodTimes Entertainment, but filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and its assets were sold to Gaiam (who may have rereleased the DVD Amazon.com lists).",3,Wide screen version,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,1909,"['Having', 'previously', 'viewed', 'full', 'frame', 'Allumination', '2/14/2006', 'DVD', 'Horse', 'Crazy', 'local', 'library', 'browsed', 'title', 'Amazon.com', 'noticed', 'widescreen', 'version', 'was', 'listed', 'half', 'dozen', 'DVD', 'versions', 'wondered', 'feature', 'was', 'shot', 'intent', 'being', 'viewed', 'full', 'frame', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ordered', '0.20', 'new', 'DVD', '2.98', 'shipping', 'Amazon.com', 'third', 'party', 'seller', 'was', 'listed', 'page', '6/4/2002', 'full', 'frame', 'DVD', 'MTI', 'Home', 'Video', 'What', 'received', 'was', 'DVD', 'not', 'described', 'Horse', 'Crazy', 'DVDs', 'Amazon.com', 'cover', 'significantly', 'different', 'shown', 'arrived', 'slim-pak', 'case', 'thickness', 'typical', 'keep', 'case', 'distributed', 'Artist', 'View', 'Entertainment', 'copyrighted', '2003', 'cover', 'disc', 'label', 'indicate', 'full', 'frame', 'wide', 'screen', 'what', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'anamorphic', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'Horse', 'Crazy', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'movie', 'well', 'aspect', 'However', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'frames', 'sharp', 'image', 'when', 'displayed', 'frame-by-frame', 'virtually', 'frame', 'library', 'Allumination', 'disc', 'sharp', 'still', 'what', 'paid', 'When', 'sharp', 'frames', 'are', 'compared', 'Allumination', 'DVD', 'top', 'bottom', 'Allumination', 'image', 'been', 'cropped', ""n't"", 'appear', 'add', 'slightly', 'more', 'image', 'sides', 'would', 'be', 'evident', 'were', 'remastered', '35', 'mm', 'film', 'shot', 'spherical', 'lenses', 'one', 'Horse', 'Crazy', 'wide', 'screen', 'DVD', 'listed', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'released', '8/11/2009', 'Good', 'Times', 'Home', 'Video', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'GoodTimes', 'Home', 'Video', 'began', 'business', '1984', 'distributing', 'primarily', 'copies', 'public', 'domain', 'titles', 'expanded', 'GoodTimes', 'Entertainment', 'filed', 'bankruptcy', '2005', 'assets', 'were', 'sold', 'Gaiam', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'rereleased', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com']",N/A
