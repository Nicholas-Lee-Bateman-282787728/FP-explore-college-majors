Jean Reno plays a tough, violent cop but with a lonely heart and a past.  Years before, his Japanese girlfriend left him for no obvious reason.

731491,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00007L4OM,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","`Wasabi', a film directed by Gerard Krawczyk and more importantly written by Luc Besson (`The Professional', `The Fifth Element', `La Femme Nikita') and starring Jean Reno (of many of the same films), is a French take on the American Dirty Harry / Axel Foley type of loose cannon policeman played by Jean Reno in place of Eastwood and Murphy. This may be a bit odd as Reno is much less the hot Murphy figure as he is the French equivalent of the modern Noir hero as played by Harvey Keitel. In fact, Reno and Keitel played exactly the same role in `La Femme Nikita' and the less successful American remake.The unfortunate thing is that while the plots of `Dirty Harry' and `Beverly Hills Cop' are an interesting framework on which the rogue cop struts his stuff, the plot of `Wasabi' is almost inconsequential. That doesn't mean the film is not fun to watch, as Reno and his two primary supporting characters do great jobs of bulking up their characters to fill out the absence of a meaningful plot.The story, briefly, is based on Reno's character, Hubert Fiorentini, a Paris policeman and former French intelligence agent in Tokyo is summoned to Tokyo because he is the only beneficiary in the will of a Japanese girlfriend who jilted him 19 years earlier when they both worked in the French embassy in Tokyo, Reno as an intelligence operative and girlfriend as a crypographer.In Tokyo, we meet the second of the three main characters, an operative colleague of Fiorentini both were France's covert strongarms in Tokyo. Soon, when Hubert sees the lawyer probating the will, we meet the third major character, the 19 year old daughter of the Japanese code breaker and our Hubert. Daughter does not know Hubert is her father, and threatens to kill her father when she meets him. Daughter is a chip off the old Nikita character block, slightly younger, less larcenous, and certainly less dopy, but just as manic and irresponsible.The big surprise which drives what is taken for a plot in the movie is when Hubert discovers that dead girlfriend / mother has $200,000,000 in her Japanese bank accounts in trust for soon to be legally adult daughter. It seems, however,that this money was somehow taken from a Japanese gangster who does a rather poor imitation of Italian-American gangsters as depicted by directors far less talented or imaginative than Martin Scorsese or Frances Coppela. With a combination of the fact that our Nippon scarface (yes, he has prominent scars on his face) has relatively inept bodyguards and the fact that our hero Hubert is something of especially adept at fanciful means of incapacitating bad guys, Hubert is able to keep himself and daughter out of scarface's clutches for most of Act II.In the last act, with the help of some heavy duty hardware from the French Tokyo cold war stash of weapons and Hubert's Tokyo wingman, Hubert ultimately teletransfers the money out of the bad guys' clutches and take down the whole gang with help from his long dormant network of Tokyo operatives.The fact that it is so much fun to write this review is a sure sign that the movie is fun to watch, at least once. The problem is whether or not the DVD is worth buying. The thin plot never explains how dead girlfriend got the 200 million bucks from scarface or exactly how girlfriend died or what connection a hidden notebook had to the case or even why the seeming larceny occurred many years ago, as 4/5 of the loot was interest, which could only have accrued over many years.The point of the title is based on no more than a sight gag of Reno's character eating gobs of undiluted Wasabi with no sigh that he senses the very high heat in this Japanese horseradish. The point is made when faithful henchman eats a small portion himself and is rewarded with a scorched mouth which he demonstrates clearly with mumbles and large amounts of drinking water.Very few comedies wear well after multiple viewings. Aside from Shakespeare's comedies and Woody Allen movies, there are very few I consider worth owning, and this is not one of them, although I sincerely enjoyed the experience of watching it the first time, as I am something of a Jean Reno fan.Note that like most French movies, watching with the original French soundtrack and English subtitles is superior to watching the dubbed English, as you always loose something in the inflections of the dubbed speech. And, the two translations are different, and based on my rudimentary High School French, I think the subtitled translation is better.",4,"Classic Role, Weak Plot",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,4515,"['Wasabi', 'film', 'directed', 'Gerard', 'Krawczyk', 'more', 'importantly', 'written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Professional', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'starring', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'many', 'same', 'films', 'French', 'take', 'American', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '/', 'Axel', 'Foley', 'type', 'loose', 'cannon', 'policeman', 'played', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'place', 'Eastwood', 'Murphy', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'odd', 'Reno', 'much', 'less', 'hot', 'Murphy', 'figure', 'French', 'equivalent', 'modern', 'Noir', 'hero', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'fact', 'Reno', 'Keitel', 'played', 'exactly', 'same', 'role', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'less', 'successful', 'American', 'remake.The', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'plots', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'are', 'interesting', 'framework', 'rogue', 'cop', 'stuff', 'plot', 'Wasabi', 'almost', 'inconsequential', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'not', 'fun', 'watch', 'Reno', 'two', 'primary', 'supporting', 'characters', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'bulking', 'up', 'characters', 'fill', 'out', 'absence', 'meaningful', 'plot.The', 'story', 'briefly', 'based', 'Reno', 'character', 'Hubert', 'Fiorentini', 'Paris', 'policeman', 'former', 'French', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'Tokyo', 'summoned', 'Tokyo', 'only', 'beneficiary', 'will', 'Japanese', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'jilted', '19', 'years', 'earlier', 'when', 'worked', 'French', 'embassy', 'Tokyo', 'Reno', 'intelligence', 'operative', 'girlfriend', 'crypographer.In', 'Tokyo', 'meet', 'second', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'operative', 'colleague', 'Fiorentini', 'were', 'France', 'covert', 'strongarms', 'Tokyo', 'Soon', 'when', 'Hubert', 'lawyer', 'probating', 'will', 'meet', 'third', 'major', 'character', '19', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Japanese', 'code', 'breaker', 'Hubert', 'Daughter', 'not', 'know', 'Hubert', 'father', 'kill', 'father', 'when', 'Daughter', 'chip', 'old', 'Nikita', 'character', 'block', 'slightly', 'younger', 'less', 'larcenous', 'certainly', 'less', 'dopy', 'just', 'manic', 'irresponsible.The', 'big', 'surprise', 'what', 'taken', 'plot', 'movie', 'when', 'Hubert', 'dead', 'girlfriend', '/', 'mother', '200,000,000', 'Japanese', 'bank', 'accounts', 'trust', 'soon', 'be', 'legally', 'adult', 'daughter', 'however', 'money', 'was', 'somehow', 'taken', 'Japanese', 'gangster', 'who', 'rather', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Italian-American', 'gangsters', 'depicted', 'directors', 'far', 'less', 'talented', 'imaginative', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Frances', 'Coppela', 'combination', 'fact', 'Nippon', 'scarface', 'yes', 'prominent', 'scars', 'face', 'relatively', 'inept', 'bodyguards', 'fact', 'hero', 'Hubert', 'something', 'especially', 'adept', 'fanciful', 'means', 'incapacitating', 'bad', 'guys', 'Hubert', 'able', 'keep', 'daughter', 'scarface', 'clutches', 'most', 'Act', 'II.In', 'last', 'act', 'help', 'heavy', 'duty', 'hardware', 'French', 'Tokyo', 'cold', 'war', 'stash', 'weapons', 'Hubert', 'Tokyo', 'wingman', 'Hubert', 'ultimately', 'money', 'bad', 'guys', 'clutches', 'take', 'down', 'whole', 'gang', 'help', 'long', 'dormant', 'network', 'Tokyo', 'operatives.The', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'write', 'review', 'sure', 'sign', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'problem', 'not', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'thin', 'plot', 'never', 'how', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'got', '200', 'million', 'bucks', 'scarface', 'exactly', 'how', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'what', 'connection', 'hidden', 'notebook', 'had', 'case', 'even', 'why', 'seeming', 'larceny', 'occurred', 'many', 'years', 'ago', '4/5', 'loot', 'was', 'interest', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'accrued', 'many', 'years.The', 'point', 'title', 'based', 'more', 'sight', 'gag', 'Reno', 'character', 'eating', 'gobs', 'undiluted', 'Wasabi', 'sigh', 'very', 'high', 'heat', 'Japanese', 'horseradish', 'point', 'made', 'when', 'faithful', 'henchman', 'small', 'portion', 'rewarded', 'scorched', 'mouth', 'clearly', 'mumbles', 'large', 'amounts', 'drinking', 'water.Very', 'few', 'comedies', 'wear', 'well', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Aside', 'Shakespeare', 'comedies', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'consider', 'worth', 'owning', 'not', 'one', 'sincerely', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'something', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'fan.Note', 'most', 'French', 'movies', 'watching', 'original', 'French', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'subtitles', 'superior', 'watching', 'dubbed', 'English', 'always', 'loose', 'something', 'inflections', 'dubbed', 'speech', 'two', 'translations', 'are', 'different', 'based', 'rudimentary', 'High', 'School', 'French', 'think', 'subtitled', 'translation', 'better']",Wasabi

Although not being a fan of foreign films regularly, Jean Reno and Luc Besson are obviously a winning combination. I had seen ""The Professional"" years ago, but I hadn't paid much attention to the other movies these two collaborated on. My mistake which I'm correcting. Suffice it to say I will now buy anything the two of them have made. I must say though you probably won't go wrong with anything Reno is in. I caught ""The Crimson Rivers"" last night and it was an excellent murder mystery. If you enjoy action movies like ""The Transporter"" with some comedy thrown in I think you will like ""Wasabi"". I watched the dubbed version and although other voices sounded a bit odd, Reno's voice sounded like his own to me. Next time I'm going to watch it with the foreign voices and subtitles. Be sure to catch Reno in ""The Visitors"". I bought ""Wasabi"" right after I rented it. It was like a cross between a ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Pink Panther"" movie. Very entertaining as Reno as a cop finds out his love from twenty years ago has died and named him the will executor. When he gets into trouble at the airport he is saved by a friend that he worked with in coutner-intelligence twenty years ago. Then on arrival in Japan he finds out his love not only left him her millions but a daughter as well that is being followed by the Japanese mafia. What transpires is excellent drama, action, and comedy.

731493,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00007L4OM,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[45, 48]","I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about films, but in purchasing Wasabi (2001), I had no prior knowledge about the movie other than it was written by Luc Besson and starred Jean Reno, who were both involved in Nikita (1990) and The Professional (1994), two wonderful films worth any action movie fan's time.  Given the talent involved in Wasabi, I thought it would be a pretty worth looking into, and I wasn't disappointed.Reno stars a Hubert, a retired secret government operative who is now a no nonsense French cop who seems to follow the guidelines within the Dirty Harry Law Enforcement Manual, that's to say his methods, while extreme, get results.  The films dives headfirst into the action as we see Hubert single-handedly bust up a transvestite bank robbery ring.  While Hubert is very good at what he does, his superior notes that that is all he does, as Hubert has no life.  That, along with pressures from a local politician with regards to Hubert's' old school tactics, forces Hubert's boss to put him on extended vacation, with a recommendation that he basically get a life.Soon Hubert gets word that a Japanese woman he once loved but who left him almost 20 years ago to which he still carried a torch for, has recently passed, and she has named him in her will.  He travels from France to Japan to witness the reading of the will, and see his long, lost love, but gets more than he bargained for as he learns the woman had a daughter, Hubert's daughter.  Not only that, but the woman has also left a mystery behind not only in why she left him in the first place, but why now the Yakuza is after the daughter.  Hubert must learn his now deceased lover's involvement with the Yakuza, protect himself and his daughter, named Yumi, and deal with the fact that he's an instant father, and the complications of having to try and relate to a 19 year old girl.Wasabi mixes a very genuine blend of action, comedy, and a pinch of drama pretty successfully.  The action is pretty steady throughout, and is more of the comic book variety, like what you might see in a Jackie Chan film.  The comedy comes mostly in the form of Hubert's contact in Japan, a fellow Frenchman named Momo, whom Hubert worked with many years ago when he was a government operative.  Momo reminded me of a chubbier version of Rob Schneider, except a bit funnier.  The drama, while present but not over done, comes in the form of Hubert and Yumi trying to come to terms with the fact that they are now all they have.  While the combination of these three elements doesn't allow for a whole lot of substance within the story, that mattered little as this was just a fun, exciting ride I enjoyed all the way to the end.  Certainly one who has seen the Besson/Reno film The Professional will notice similarities, but more or less these two films relate superficially.  What's really interesting is how much this French-made film looks like an American actioneer.The quality of the wide screen picture here looks great, and the audio is really excellent.  Keep in mind the dialog is in French, with English subtitles available, but there is also a dubbed English track, for those of you who don't care to read while watching a film.  I, myself, preferred to allow the original voices to come out, while reading the translation below.  The dubbed voices sound a bit weird at times, especially since I am fairly familiar with how Jean Reno's voice sounds like, and the guy hired to dub him is way off.  As far as extras go, there are some theatrical trailers available, for this film, and Formula 51 (2001), Swept Away (2002), and Trapped (2002).  While Wasabi really isn't a cinematic feast, it's definitely a satisfying appetizer, and sometimes that's all you need.Cookieman108",4,For those who take their action raw.,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,3758,"['consider', 'pretty', 'knowledgeable', 'films', 'purchasing', 'Wasabi', '2001', 'had', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'other', 'was', 'written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'starred', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'Nikita', '1990', 'Professional', '1994', 'two', 'wonderful', 'films', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'time', 'Given', 'talent', 'involved', 'Wasabi', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'worth', 'looking', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.Reno', 'stars', 'Hubert', 'retired', 'secret', 'government', 'operative', 'who', 'now', 'nonsense', 'French', 'cop', 'who', 'follow', 'guidelines', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'Manual', 'say', 'methods', 'extreme', 'get', 'results', 'films', 'dives', 'headfirst', 'action', 'see', 'Hubert', 'single-handedly', 'bust', 'up', 'transvestite', 'bank', 'robbery', 'ring', 'Hubert', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'superior', 'notes', 'Hubert', 'life', 'pressures', 'local', 'politician', 'regards', 'Hubert', 'old', 'school', 'tactics', 'forces', 'Hubert', 'boss', 'put', 'extended', 'vacation', 'recommendation', 'basically', 'get', 'life.Soon', 'Hubert', 'word', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'who', 'left', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'carried', 'torch', 'recently', 'passed', 'named', 'will', 'France', 'Japan', 'witness', 'reading', 'will', 'see', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'more', 'bargained', 'woman', 'had', 'daughter', 'Hubert', 'daughter', 'Not', 'only', 'woman', 'also', 'left', 'mystery', 'not', 'only', 'why', 'left', 'first', 'place', 'why', 'now', 'Yakuza', 'daughter', 'Hubert', 'must', 'learn', 'now', 'deceased', 'lover', 'involvement', 'Yakuza', 'protect', 'daughter', 'named', 'Yumi', 'deal', 'fact', 'instant', 'father', 'complications', 'having', 'try', 'relate', '19', 'year', 'old', 'girl.Wasabi', 'very', 'genuine', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'pinch', 'drama', 'pretty', 'successfully', 'action', 'pretty', 'steady', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'variety', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'form', 'Hubert', 'contact', 'Japan', 'fellow', 'Frenchman', 'named', 'Momo', 'whom', 'Hubert', 'worked', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'government', 'operative', 'Momo', 'reminded', 'chubbier', 'version', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'bit', 'funnier', 'drama', 'present', 'not', 'done', 'form', 'Hubert', 'Yumi', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'are', 'now', 'all', 'have', 'combination', 'three', 'elements', ""n't"", 'allow', 'whole', 'lot', 'substance', 'story', 'mattered', 'little', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'exciting', 'ride', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'end', 'Certainly', 'one', 'who', 'seen', 'Besson/Reno', 'film', 'Professional', 'will', 'notice', 'similarities', 'more', 'less', 'two', 'films', 'relate', 'superficially', 'What', 'really', 'interesting', 'how', 'much', 'French-made', 'film', 'looks', 'American', 'actioneer.The', 'quality', 'wide', 'screen', 'picture', 'here', 'great', 'audio', 'really', 'excellent', 'Keep', 'mind', 'dialog', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'available', 'also', 'dubbed', 'English', 'track', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'read', 'watching', 'film', 'preferred', 'allow', 'original', 'voices', 'come', 'out', 'reading', 'translation', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'sound', 'bit', 'weird', 'times', 'especially', 'am', 'fairly', 'familiar', 'how', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'voice', 'sounds', 'guy', 'hired', 'dub', 'way', 'off', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'go', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'available', 'film', 'Formula', '51', '2001', 'Swept', 'Away', '2002', 'Trapped', '2002', 'Wasabi', 'really', ""n't"", 'cinematic', 'feast', 'definitely', 'satisfying', 'appetizer', 'need.Cookieman108']",Wasabi

The tone of the script is very much along the lines of Besson's action-comedy, ""Taxi"", with elements of ""Leon - the Professional"" thrown in. This film does not take itself too seriously and there are some fun action set-pieces along the way (the fight scene at the golf range is particularly notable), although the film could have been improved by an increase in the number of these action scenes. Overall, I see this film as Besson-light (much like ""Bandidas"").

Reno has to protect his daughter for a few days until she comes of age from the yakuza (Japanese mafia).  The mother was working for Japanese security and had infiltrated the yakuza.  The story was interesting with lots of action.  I enjoyed the scene where Reno went to a gaming parlor with his daughter, but he can't dance or do most of the games his daughter's friends like.  Just before he's invited to play a shoot-em-up game, the yakuza arrive, and Reno shoots them all.  He apologizes to the friends for having to run out and not play the game.

731523,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00007L4OM,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","&#65533;Wasabi&#65533; is a high-spirited French action comedy with a Japanese name.  This Luc Besson production stars Jean Reno in a wonderful performance as a tough-guy French cop who is as quick to use his tongue as his overeager fists.  One day, out of the blue, Detective Fiorentino discovers that he has a 19 year-old daughter by a Japanese woman who left him almost 20 years ago, breaking his heart in the process.  The girl, Yumi, turns out to be an orange-haired free spirit who hates cops and has been led to believe that her father raped her mother.  Much of the film is spent with Hubert and Yumi getting to know one another, as they uncover secrets about her mother&#65533;s past that seem to have made the young woman the target of some rather unsavory characters.The plot is the least of the matter in this film.  As directed by Gerard Krawczyk, &#65533;Wasabi&#65533; is really all about style.  Besson&#65533;s screenplay is fitfully amusing, doling out cleverness and cutesyness in roughly equal measure.  Cinematographer Gerard Sterin brings out the colorful richness of the urban Japanese landscape and editor Yanne Herve doesn&#65533;t linger longer on the jokes and sight gags than is absolutely necessary.  These elements help to compensate for the somewhat desperate air that afflicts the screenplay from time to time.The prime asset of &#65533;Wasabi&#65533; is Jean Reno&#65533;s performance.  Reno perfectly mines the comic potential inherent in the material through the tone of weary cynicism and superiority to all around him that he conveys throughout.  As an actor who has played this type of rogue-cop character many times in his career, Reno obviously relishes this opportunity for a little good-natured self-ribbing.  And he does a splendid job.&#65533;Wasabi&#65533; is little more than a piffle when all is said and done, but Reno makes it worth seeing.",3,uneven film with a superb Reno performance,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1889,"['65533', 'Wasabi', '65533', 'high-spirited', 'French', 'action', 'comedy', 'Japanese', 'name', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'production', 'stars', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'tough-guy', 'French', 'cop', 'who', 'as', 'quick', 'use', 'tongue', 'overeager', 'fists', 'One', 'day', 'blue', 'Detective', 'Fiorentino', '19', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'breaking', 'heart', 'process', 'girl', 'Yumi', 'out', 'be', 'orange-haired', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'cops', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'father', 'raped', 'mother', 'Much', 'film', 'spent', 'Hubert', 'Yumi', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'mother', '65533', 's', 'seem', 'have', 'made', 'young', 'woman', 'target', 'rather', 'unsavory', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'least', 'matter', 'film', 'directed', 'Gerard', 'Krawczyk', '65533', 'Wasabi', '65533', 'really', 'style', 'Besson', '65533', 's', 'screenplay', 'fitfully', 'amusing', 'doling', 'out', 'cleverness', 'cutesyness', 'roughly', 'equal', 'measure', 'Cinematographer', 'Gerard', 'Sterin', 'out', 'colorful', 'richness', 'urban', 'Japanese', 'landscape', 'editor', 'Yanne', 'Herve', 'doesn', '65533', 't', 'linger', 'longer', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'elements', 'help', 'compensate', 'somewhat', 'desperate', 'air', 'screenplay', 'time', 'time.The', 'prime', 'asset', '65533', 'Wasabi', '65533', 'Jean', 'Reno', '65533', 's', 'performance', 'Reno', 'perfectly', 'comic', 'potential', 'inherent', 'material', 'tone', 'weary', 'cynicism', 'superiority', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'type', 'rogue-cop', 'character', 'many', 'times', 'career', 'Reno', 'obviously', 'opportunity', 'little', 'good-natured', 'self-ribbing', 'splendid', 'job.', '65533', 'Wasabi', '65533', 'little', 'more', 'piffle', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Reno', 'worth', 'seeing']",Wasabi

This is one fun movie, though even if you are not a fan of Reno. This is in part due to the writing credits of Luc Besson, a long-time collaborator of Reno's, famously teaming together for the brilliant Leon aka' The Professional, my all time favorite piece of cinema! While this movie doesn't have the depth and brilliant script of Leon, it is certainly a fine piece of work from both Besson and Reno. Adding to the wonderful spicy flavor of this dish, we have Hirosue Ryoko, who is an absolute gem as Hubert's surprise daughter, and Michael Muller, Hubert's longtime partner, who is hillarious when he takes a big scoop of wasabi and puts it in his mouth, the look on his face....priceless!! We should see more of him in domestic movies, he is quite a card! The cast plays off each other very well and the scene with Hubert's past love, lying in the coffin as Reno looks at her, is very touching and sweet. Bottom line, this is a sweet fun movie, plenty of action, humor and entertains divinely!!

The film takes its title from this wasabi paste (which Jean Reno actually tastes in this film), suggesting the content is sharp and spicy.Jean Reno is a marverick French cop Hubert, whose way of arresting the criminals are so outrageous that he is suspended from the job by the disgruntled police chief.  But when a detective like him uses a weapon like fists faster than Jackie Chan's, and golf clubs, who can really hate him?  And, hey, he seems to be having a dinner tonight with no other than ever gorgeous ex-Bond girl Carole Bouquet (who appears as a cameo), Hubert has nothing to complain of.But he left a very bitter memory in Japan, which he could never shake off.  And Hubert receives a ring from a lawyer telling him that his former Japanese girl-friend is dead.  But the news do not end here; it turns out that she left a daughter Yumi, and appointed Hubert as her guardian in her will.  Then Hubert flies to Japan, meets his daughter without telling the truth, but soon he finds that Japanese yakuza gangsters are aiming at Yumi for the unknown reasons.OK.  The script of Luc Besson (who also produced through his film company Europa) is as thin as you can imagine, and the tone of the film is very light.  There are many actions (including that of using games and ... er ... golf balls), but the charm of the film largely comes from understated humor of Jean Reno as laconic Hubert.  He is not as cool as the assassin in ""The Professional"" (aka ""Leon""); his relations with Yumi is not as convincing as the one with Natalie Portman.  Still, the ride goes pleasantly.  The film is good as pure entertainment.Some informantion about the production.  Besson obviously made ""Wasabi"" in French and Japanese film market in mind, and he decided to use fully the potentials.  So, French actor Jean Reno is called in, who is very popular in Japan (far more popular in Japan than in USA or UK, I can say) while Japanese popular actress Ryoko Hiroshue is cast as Yumi as his daughter.  The director is Gerard Krawczyk, whose previous action-comedy ""TAXI 2"" was a huge hit in France (more than 10 millions came to the theatre in France, where the population is much smaller than in USA).  So, you may call ""Wasabi"" a unashamed result of market research, or ""product.""  But it is defenitely better to see good product than to watch awful art, isn't it?The film is mostly shot in Japan.  You can watch briefly a temple of Kyoto (Kiyomizu Temple) and the streets of Tokyo, and will have a glimpse (just a glimpse) of how teenagers are having fun in this city (such as ""game center"" as we call it in downtown of Shibuya) though the film is fast enough not to indulge in showing these scenes.  The film's location is not as exotic as the title implies, and its camera always focuses on the two leads, both of whom are great.  I don't tell you much about super-cool Reno except that he is as good as before, and he shouldn't have been in ""Rollerball.""  About Hirosue, you may feel that her costumes and behaviors are too spanky for a Japanese girl.  In fact, some of her costumes, I admit, look too cartoon-ish, directly from Powerpuff Girls, but they are all intentional.  And as a teacher in college in Japan, I can tell that her dresses are exaggerated, but not so exceptional in downtown Tokyo.  And her frequent use of cell phone is nothing unusual among Japanese teenage girls.""Wasabi"" is too light-weight, it is true, but it gives fun certainly.  Just don't think.
