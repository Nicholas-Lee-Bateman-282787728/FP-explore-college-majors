The CNN People Profiles Documentary I thought was the best so far but it's still not released on DVD which it should be. I remember seeing this documentary as a kid on PBS prime time and it's a classic to this day. But unfortunately the VHS release is the only official and legal way to get a copy of it. Some clips in the documentary are poorly edited and dubbed and adding laugh tracks like on the Poison to Posion sketch from Sam & Friends which wasn't including in the original footage. But other then that, the interviews are great. The interviews were longer but were included in other documentaries like ""Muppet Stuff"". It's a great introduction into the life of Jim Henson and I strongly recommended it to Jim Henson historians, Muppet fans, puppetry researchers and even to people who want to learn more about him.",5,One of the best Jim Henson Documentaries EVER MADE!

How many lives did he touch with Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, his films and his unforgettable puppets who live on, today, even though he passed away over ten years ago?  This wonderful documentary takes a warm, honorable and respectful look at Jim Henson, the puppeteer, as well as Jim Henson, the visionary.We see footage from the early days of Kermit the Frog (on the Jack Paar Show in the 1950s), Jim Henson, himself, featured in sketches during the formative years of Sesame Street, his films, the Muppet Shows and movies, and interviews.  It makes all of us remember what a legacy he has left behind for children, their parents and anyone who grew up watching Sesame Street.  This man was comparable to none, and there will never be anyone like him!  Please see this film.  You will find it as entertaining as it is insightful.

510496,A3C851870WVD5Z,B00000K509,"""justbrowsing""","[18, 18]","This video, first featured on PBS some years ago (1994?) is beautifully  made, and features a great description of Henson's impact on modern  entertainment, from his association with Sesame Street to his early career  to the Muppets and his later projects. It features some delightful musical  clips from his shows (&quot;Moving Right Along&quot; from The Muppet Movie,  Cantus' song from Fraggle Rock, &quot;Visit the Moon&quot;, from Sesame  Street, &quot;It's Not Easy Being Green&quot;, and - of course - &quot;The  Rainbow Connection&quot;) Most stories about artists tend to be about their  personalities, political views, and love affairs than about how their work  evolved. This is a welcome reversal of that tendency.However, I have a  gut feeling that the producers could have made a much longer and more  in-depth documentary of his life and work, one which would be greater  inspiration to those who were/are/will be impressed by this amazing man's  life. But at 85 minutes it is the perfect length for children - not just  entertainment, but creative inspiration.",5,"A celebration, not a biography",968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,1076,"['video', 'first', 'featured', 'PBS', 'years', 'ago', '1994', 'beautifully', 'made', 'great', 'description', 'Henson', 'impact', 'modern', 'entertainment', 'association', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'early', 'career', 'Muppets', 'later', 'projects', 'delightful', 'musical', 'clips', 'shows', 'quot', 'Moving', 'Right', 'Along', 'quot', 'Muppet', 'Movie', 'Cantus', 'song', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'quot', 'Visit', 'Moon', 'quot', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'quot', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Green', 'quot', 'course', 'quot', 'Rainbow', 'Connection', 'quot', 'Most', 'stories', 'artists', 'tend', 'be', 'personalities', 'political', 'views', 'love', 'affairs', 'how', 'work', 'evolved', 'welcome', 'reversal', 'tendency.However', 'have', 'gut', 'feeling', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'longer', 'more', 'in-depth', 'documentary', 'life', 'work', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'greater', 'inspiration', 'who', 'were/are/will', 'be', 'impressed', 'amazing', 'man', 'life', '85', 'minutes', 'perfect', 'length', 'children', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', 'creative', 'inspiration']",The World of Jim Henson VHS
