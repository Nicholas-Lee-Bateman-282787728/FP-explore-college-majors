1096148,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000UR9TEQ,Aion,"[0, 1]","Hell Girl - 8-8.5/10I saw that I could import the R1 box set for 20. I did so.Prior to buying the box set, I had watched the first ten episodes; I got the first two R2 volumes for a few quid. I found the series to be very watchable simply because revenge stories are always involving and each episode provided a new story, but there wasn't enough connecting the dots for me to love it - there hadn't been any character development whatsoever for Hell Girl and her crew. The quality also went up and down a lot; as expected of an episodic title.The first half of Hell Girl focused on black and white revenge. What made the victims vengeful was shown, the victims then went on the net and entered the name of the person they wanted to die, Hell Girl then appeared and gave the victims the tool required to cast the curse, the victims then received one last push from the person they hate required to make them want to give up their own soul for revenge and, finally, Hell Girl and her servants ended the episodes by first punishing (often unintentionally comically) and then ferrying the cursed, evil people to hell on a small boat. Very repetitive; even the same dialogue was repeated by Hell Girl when giving instructions and the like.The second half mixed things up slightly by introducing a private detective (of sorts) called Hajime and his daughter; a daughter that shares a connection to Hell Girl that lets her see through Hell Girl's eyes from time to time - allowing her father to track down Hell Girl's 'clients' in each episode. Her father, as luck would have it, sees revenge as wrong and, at first, felt the need to try to stop Hell Girl. The new investigation angle did freshen up the stories, with them told from the viewpoint of Hajime rather than the victims - adding mystery. There were other changes, too, such as the revenge stories no longer being black and white; sometimes 'good' people got sent to hell in order to justify Hajime's anti-revenge/Hell Girl ramblings, these 'good' people not getting the cosplay punishment sequences. But the best thing about the introduction of Hajime and his daughter was the inclusion of recurring characters with actual development; not just faces with nothing below the surface. Hajime even got an episode to himself that explained his back-story and why he was so against revenge - it made me feel sorry for him.Ignoring the reappearances of Hell Girl, her three servants and the father and daughter duo, there weren't any connected episodes in terms of story until the last three, which were all about Hell Girl's past, finally revealing a little about her to the viewers. Until that point, she'd been no more than a doll; there to punish upon request and repeat the same lines without any emotions. Seeing her tragic background and seeing her show an emotion - anger - transformed her from a blank slate and into an actual person. And, as an added bonus, her story connected Hajime and his daughter to her, making their inclusion not as random as it appeared - I thought they were no more than characters threw in to extend the story.If not for some very poor episodes which departed from the usual formula, mixing in unnecessary extra supernatural elements - like a talking doll with control of plant monsters and Hell Boy (don't ask) - I'd have rated it higher. Those few episodes added nothing, only lowering the overall quality. There were also some standard revenge stories that weren't very good, but most of the 'normal' episodes were at least watchable, and even if they were poor there was always another, totally different story right around the corner.One non-plot/character point that deserves to be mentioned is the music. It's unique to my ears; some kind of eerie techno/rock stuff. Whatever it's classed as, it's very good, and it made the talking sections of the episodes even more watchable.Overall, providing you don't mind episodic series that aren't comedies and are forgiving enough to excuse a few drops in quality and silly punishment sequences, it's a must watch. It gets better the further you progress. It did bug me that little was revealed about Hell Girl until the end and how school girls always seemed to be playing the roles of victims (school girls sell DVDs), but I came out of the series thinking highly of it. I'll definitely be watching season two at some point.",4,"Revenge, for a price -- Care to give death a try?",1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,4362,"['Hell', 'Girl', '8-8.5/10I', 'saw', 'could', 'import', 'R1', 'box', 'set', '20', 'did', 'so.Prior', 'buying', 'box', 'set', 'had', 'watched', 'first', 'ten', 'got', 'first', 'two', 'R2', 'volumes', 'few', 'quid', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'very', 'watchable', 'simply', 'revenge', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'involving', 'episode', 'provided', 'new', 'story', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'connecting', 'dots', 'love', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'character', 'development', 'whatsoever', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'crew', 'quality', 'also', 'went', 'up', 'lot', 'expected', 'episodic', 'title.The', 'first', 'half', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'focused', 'black', 'white', 'revenge', 'What', 'made', 'victims', 'vengeful', 'was', 'shown', 'victims', 'then', 'went', 'net', 'entered', 'name', 'person', 'wanted', 'die', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'then', 'appeared', 'gave', 'victims', 'tool', 'required', 'cast', 'curse', 'victims', 'then', 'received', 'one', 'last', 'push', 'person', 'hate', 'required', 'make', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'own', 'soul', 'revenge', 'finally', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'servants', 'ended', 'episodes', 'first', 'punishing', 'often', 'unintentionally', 'comically', 'then', 'ferrying', 'cursed', 'evil', 'people', 'hell', 'small', 'boat', 'Very', 'repetitive', 'even', 'same', 'dialogue', 'was', 'repeated', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'when', 'giving', 'instructions', 'like.The', 'second', 'half', 'mixed', 'things', 'up', 'slightly', 'introducing', 'private', 'detective', 'sorts', 'called', 'Hajime', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'shares', 'connection', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'see', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'eyes', 'time', 'time', 'allowing', 'father', 'track', 'down', 'Hell', 'Girl', ""'clients"", 'episode', 'father', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'revenge', 'wrong', 'first', 'felt', 'need', 'try', 'stop', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'new', 'investigation', 'angle', 'did', 'freshen', 'up', 'stories', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'Hajime', 'rather', 'victims', 'adding', 'mystery', 'were', 'other', 'changes', 'too', 'such', 'revenge', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'black', 'white', 'sometimes', ""'good"", 'people', 'got', 'sent', 'hell', 'order', 'justify', 'Hajime', 'anti-revenge/Hell', 'Girl', 'ramblings', ""'good"", 'people', 'not', 'getting', 'cosplay', 'punishment', 'sequences', 'best', 'thing', 'introduction', 'Hajime', 'daughter', 'was', 'inclusion', 'recurring', 'characters', 'actual', 'development', 'not', 'just', 'nothing', 'surface', 'Hajime', 'even', 'got', 'episode', 'explained', 'back-story', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'revenge', 'made', 'feel', 'sorry', 'him.Ignoring', 'reappearances', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'three', 'servants', 'father', 'daughter', 'duo', 'were', ""n't"", 'connected', 'episodes', 'terms', 'story', 'last', 'three', 'were', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'past', 'finally', 'revealing', 'little', 'viewers', 'point', ""'d"", 'been', 'no', 'more', 'doll', 'there', 'punish', 'request', 'repeat', 'same', 'lines', 'emotions', 'Seeing', 'tragic', 'background', 'seeing', 'show', 'emotion', 'anger', 'transformed', 'blank', 'slate', 'actual', 'person', 'added', 'bonus', 'story', 'connected', 'Hajime', 'daughter', 'making', 'inclusion', 'not', 'as', 'random', 'appeared', 'thought', 'were', 'more', 'characters', 'threw', 'extend', 'story.If', 'not', 'very', 'poor', 'episodes', 'departed', 'usual', 'formula', 'mixing', 'unnecessary', 'extra', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'talking', 'doll', 'control', 'plant', 'monsters', 'Hell', 'Boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', ""'d"", 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'few', 'episodes', 'added', 'nothing', 'only', 'lowering', 'overall', 'quality', 'were', 'also', 'standard', 'revenge', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'most', ""'normal"", 'episodes', 'were', 'least', 'watchable', 'even', 'were', 'poor', 'was', 'always', 'totally', 'different', 'story', 'right', 'corner.One', 'non-plot/character', 'point', 'be', 'mentioned', 'music', 'unique', 'ears', 'kind', 'eerie', 'techno/rock', 'stuff', 'classed', 'very', 'good', 'made', 'talking', 'sections', 'episodes', 'even', 'more', 'watchable.Overall', 'providing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'episodic', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'comedies', 'are', 'forgiving', 'enough', 'excuse', 'few', 'drops', 'quality', 'silly', 'punishment', 'sequences', 'must', 'watch', 'better', 'further', 'progress', 'did', 'bug', 'little', 'was', 'revealed', 'about', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'end', 'how', 'school', 'girls', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'playing', 'roles', 'victims', 'school', 'girls', 'sell', 'DVDs', 'came', 'out', 'series', 'thinking', 'highly', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'season', 'two', 'point']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"
1096149,A244T2V6PVFCZ6,B000UR9TEQ,"Brett ""Reviewer""","[2, 5]","""Hell Girl"" is an anime that introduces a very interesting idea: what if, for the price of damnation (a guarantee of being sent to Hell upon your death), you could immediately send a tormentor you utterly despise to Hell? Although there are recurring characters and the back-story of the main character (Ai Enma), the heart of the show exists in an episodic format that shows different people in different situations of torment, most of whom ultimately end up making the decision to use the power of Ai. Fans of ""Paranoia Agent"" will recognize this type of format easily (as well some similar mood and feeling).This is not, in any way, a humorous show, and the anime does not shy away from showing the torment and the subsequent victims' revenges upon their tormentors. The best executed parts of each episode tend to occur when the vengeance is finally enacted, although there are exceptions (the final episode is, in particular, an emotional and well-enacted story).The main problem with this anime, one which makes it so I will not continue my patronage of the show, is that the episodes tend to be too long. The first episode, for example, draws out the scenes of torment until you reach the point of exasperation, just hoping that the tormented will finally get on with their revenge. That may be designed to reflect the difficult nature of the decision the tormented must make, but it makes for a difficult and often ponderous show. There are shows with similar formats and even themes (such as ""Paranoia Agent"", for example), which manage to make this work much better.",3,"Interesting Idea, but too slow execution",1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,1576,"['Hell', 'Girl', 'anime', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', 'what', 'price', 'damnation', 'guarantee', 'being', 'sent', 'Hell', 'death', 'could', 'immediately', 'send', 'tormentor', 'utterly', 'despise', 'Hell', 'are', 'recurring', 'characters', 'back-story', 'main', 'character', 'Ai', 'Enma', 'heart', 'show', 'episodic', 'format', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'situations', 'torment', 'most', 'whom', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'decision', 'use', 'power', 'Ai', 'Fans', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'will', 'recognize', 'type', 'format', 'easily', 'well', 'similar', 'mood', 'feeling', '.This', 'not', 'way', 'humorous', 'show', 'anime', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'torment', 'subsequent', 'victims', 'revenges', 'tormentors', 'best', 'executed', 'parts', 'episode', 'tend', 'occur', 'when', 'vengeance', 'finally', 'enacted', 'are', 'exceptions', 'final', 'episode', 'particular', 'emotional', 'well-enacted', 'story', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'anime', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'continue', 'patronage', 'show', 'episodes', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'episode', 'example', 'out', 'scenes', 'torment', 'reach', 'point', 'exasperation', 'just', 'hoping', 'tormented', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'revenge', 'may', 'be', 'designed', 'reflect', 'difficult', 'nature', 'decision', 'tormented', 'must', 'make', 'difficult', 'often', 'ponderous', 'show', 'are', 'shows', 'similar', 'formats', 'even', 'themes', 'such', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'example', 'manage', 'make', 'work', 'much', 'better']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"

About the pain and suffering of an innocent person who seeks revenge on the person who has wronged them. I had a hard time getting into it with no characters to get attached to, but about half the way through just before I was ready to give up on Hell Girl something happened. A plot began to form. A freelance journalist and his 10 year old daughter were introduced. Hajime, the freelance journalist, was investigating the Hell Girl phenomenon; and his daughter Tsugumi, who had a psychic connection with the Hell Girl, began following the people who were seeking revenge and tried to talk them out of it. Their interference was quite an annoyance to Hell Girl and her servants. After Hajime and Tsugumi got involved the story got really good. I don't think I've seen an anime that so thoroughly bummed me out in the first half, and rocked my world in the second half. His and Her Circumstances was the opposite.

1096156,A3DQDILRL74K37,B000UR9TEQ,"KMG ""Apparently I'm a Shopaholic""","[4, 8]","I don't normally review anime series because I don't consider myself a guru at it.  I watch a lot of animes and like many differnt types, but I still don't consider myself fair judge of the stuff.  But, here goes anyway.  Hope this helps a few people.We waited and waited for this series to come to the USA, in the complete first season.  The animation looked wonderful, the idea of the series sounded dark and deep, and the voice for HellGirl seemed right on.Upon entering the HellGirl realm, the animation is still really good, but the storyline needed a huge boost in script.  The first two discs were barely worth watching, but the third disc and further were really interesting and kept me hooked.  You've got to be patient with this one.Disc 1 and 2 were the introductions to the main characters, explaining situations where someone might want to exact revenge on someone else, so they log into a site that is only available at midnight, send a message to HellGirl with the person's name.  HellGirl almost instantly appears and she gives them the option to send someone to Hell- but the trade ""the price"" is that when they die, they too will be sent to Hell, so it'd better be worth it.The characters in Disc 1 + 2 were wanting.  Most were teenaged kids who didn't really comprehend what they were doing, sending a fellow classmate to Hell because they embarrassed them, or sending someone to Hell because they weren't friends anymore... (rolls eyes) kids stuff.  You almost want to laugh and say ""get over it!"" but... many teens don't understand that life goes on, so maybe it's a little truthful.  But, to be honest, I was hoping for some really dark and morbid episodes (which don't happen until about Disc 3)  You don't get to the really GOOD ""worth it"" Hell-bound stories until Disc 3, where (for example) two lovers are forbidden to see each other because her aunt says no.  The aunt plays voodoo with the male lover and is threatening his life.  The aunt is psychotic and comes after the two of them... yesh, it'd be worth it to me to send her to Hell if to get just a few years of peace.I read a different review that mentioned that there was a lot of repitition, and I want to explain that one: HellGirl had a really hard time getting picked up as a series in Japan, so it had a lot of Pilot or ""sample"" episodes while it was trying to get signed on.  This is the reason for the repitition- the repeated scenes, the repeated lines, the repeated fire chariot and sleeve/flower explosion, Hell's gate, etc.  Really.  After the first two discs, the show is really pretty good.  By disc 3, it reminds me of ""R.O.D."" and in some ways ""His and Her Circumstances"".  The artistry is pretty good, the storyline thickens as Purgatory Girl is introduced and the research/ investigation resumes.  The supporting, repeating characters really helped to boost the script.So, overall, this first season is okay.

The stories are meant to be strong and meaningful, but it's all thrown at you and predictable that it's easy to lose interest on. Some scenes are actually just repeated episode after episode, like the entire ""I am hell girl"" ...and the chariot of fire scene. It loses its flavor quickly when you know this will happen every story. What I don't get is that there is 26 episodes of this medicore anime, but great animes like Elfen Lied and The Melancholoy of Haruhi Suzumiya only have 13 episodes. It's like what you want more of, you get less of and vice versa. The good things about this Anime is that the art is drawn very well, but it clashes with things like a Dawsons Creek themed opening, and pop music playing throughout the anime, then they finish it up with more Dawsons Creek music. It just doesn't fit the idea of something called ""Hell Girl"".Not to mention that Funimation must have had everyone in the office call out sick when recording this because Laura Bailey plays almost every female character... matter of fact its like they have the same 4 people doing the voices every episode. That may work out well in an Anime that has main characters! but when every episode is baised around New characters and the events around them, why must they sound the same as the characters from the last 20 episodes?

But it should be brought into consideration, that being said most of the issues others find with Hell Girl is the episodic nature of the show. The show has its formula of a disgruntled, abused, or angry person accessing Hell Link to get vengeance on the person that wronged them. We then watch their tale play out and eventually they are sent to Hell.Those new to the show should know that the show doesn't have a true plot/point until the 8th episode, even this story is not delved into until the very end of the show. Just like people shouldn't look for Comedy in a Murder Mystery, people shouldn't expect anything beyond the self contained stories of each episode.Onto the product itself, you get 4 DVD's in a single normal size DVD case using those hanging DVD holders. The artwork on the inside of the cover is very nice and I chose to flip the DVD cover inside out because I like the inner artwork more. The Dub is there of course and is very good, the episode ""The Cracked Mask"" is funny in english. We get a roundtable interview with the main Japanese Voice Acting Cast which is nice.So if you understand the point of the show wanting to tell self contained stories then it is likely you will enjoy this show and for you a 4/5 rating is likely.If you want a continuous story there are many shows with 100's of episodes out there to enjoy, so you'll likely be a 3/5.",5,Know What You're Getting,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1498,"['First', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'reviews', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'product', 'review', 'not', 'quiet', 'opinion', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'consideration', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'issues', 'others', 'find', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'episodic', 'nature', 'show', 'show', 'formula', 'disgruntled', 'abused', 'angry', 'person', 'accessing', 'Hell', 'Link', 'get', 'vengeance', 'person', 'wronged', 'then', 'watch', 'tale', 'play', 'out', 'eventually', 'are', 'sent', 'Hell.Those', 'new', 'show', 'should', 'know', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'true', 'plot/point', '8th', 'episode', 'even', 'story', 'not', 'delved', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'Just', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'look', 'Comedy', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'self', 'contained', 'stories', 'product', 'get', '4', 'DVD', 'single', 'normal', 'size', 'DVD', 'case', 'using', 'hanging', 'DVD', 'holders', 'artwork', 'inside', 'cover', 'very', 'nice', 'chose', 'flip', 'DVD', 'cover', 'inside', 'like', 'inner', 'artwork', 'more', 'Dub', 'there', 'course', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'Cracked', 'Mask', 'funny', 'english', 'get', 'roundtable', 'interview', 'main', 'Japanese', 'Voice', 'Acting', 'Cast', 'nice.So', 'understand', 'point', 'show', 'wanting', 'tell', 'contained', 'stories', 'then', 'likely', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', '4/5', 'rating', 'likely.If', 'want', 'continuous', 'story', 'are', 'many', 'shows', '100', 'episodes', 'there', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', '3/5']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"

Silly me -- usually the S.A.V.E. sets look little better than bootleg sets (though they are much better quality, the physical set and the video quality). So just be aware, what you will get ordering new from Amazon will be a single clear-hardshell case (with decent artwork), with 4 pretty discs arranged nicely within (it is good, solid packaging). I've uploaded a customer picture so you can see what that will look like. For a S.A.V.E. set, at a killer price, the set is great, but it is not what Amazon pictures (I have given my complaints several times and it's still wrong...).On the anime:Basically, it's all about revenge. Teens (or anyone accessing the website) can request Hell Girl to terrify whomever has wronged them, and send them to Hell, but in return they allow their own souls to be ferried to Hell. Yes, a little creepy. Yes, a little dramatic.I might actually give the anime 4 stars, I'm not sure yet. I've seen the first 10 episodes or so, over the course of about 3 years. So, point -1, it's not something that will really capture you and pull you back. You won't dream about it then rush to finish it in one sitting to end the nightmares (uh, I hope).+1 The artwork is pretty. I picked up an inexpensive poster of Jigoku Shoujo at an anime convention (and I only own 3 anime posters).+1 The Japanese cast is good. I haven't tried English.+1 for the Japanese cultural aspect, you can learn interesting mythology bits from this anime.+1 It's a good anime to learn some Japanese, because of course it's mostly about school kids. You can watch (or re-watch) episodes without the subtitles and still get what is going on.Which brings me to another -1: Hell Girl is the only real character, and she's not much of a character. She's mysterious, maybe a bit tragic, but you don't get a lot of her personality (so far?).+1 You do care for the characters in the various episodes, but -- owing to the nature of the story -- they end up in Hell. It didn't take long for me to get a little tired of these people giving up their lives for revenge, although their situations were helpless enough you could believe they might resort to that.Having sampled more than 200 anime series, I would recommend you to give this series a try.

1096163,A3UDPNRN50Q56Z,B000UR9TEQ,"Ophelia ""IloveAnime""","[1, 2]","This anime is by far one of my top favorites! It really makes you think about what you would do when faced with the same situations as the characters in it. Would you be willing to damn yourself as well as the soul of your tormentor? Would you reconsider, or sacrifice your own eternity for the sake of another? You are also shown how ugly people can truly be, and that is where the thinking comes in. Hell Girl always explains things very clearly to those who summon her but never tells them they have to go through with it. The decision, as she so bluntly puts it, is ALWAYS up to the person seeking vengeance. The anime also explores several different angles, some characters experience real regret, some do not. Sometimes innocent characters are damned under misunderstanding, and some clearly deserve it (but again, that's for the viewer to think on ^_^)The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the music is quite fitting. It never feels too dramatic and sets the tone very well. The voice acting is fairly good, with Hell Girl sounding cold, distant and enigmatic. You learn some about her as the series goes on but thankfully they keep things mysterious so you never fully get what's going on (even if you think you do) I'm on the last disc of the series, and will be sad when it's over.

You enter the name of the person you want punished and then Hell Girl appears. You make a contract with her and voila! the person you curse has their soul dragged into hell! What is the price of your revenge? Only the promise that when you die your soul will also fall into hell!Hell Girl (Jigoku Shojo in Japanese) is primarily episodic in nature. Each episode is the story of someone's revenge. Sometimes, well most of the time, the person taking revenge has been horrible wronged and the law won't help them. But justice is so important to them that they sacrifice their immortal soul to get it. Over the course of the season, a reporter starts following the Hell Girl story and tries to unravel the mystery of Ai Enma's (Hell Girl) origins. At the end of the season you do get the beginnings of her story.This is a very interesting series. The art work is superb and the revenge scene is always fun to watch. This is a horror series, but it isn't very scary. It is horrifying - the things that are done to the people that makes them want to take revenge. There is one episode that I particularly disliked because it was so sad (the baseball one, just skip it). Ai isn't very discriminating in who she helps get revenge. In one episode she keeps refusing the request of one person, but another time she carries out a revenge on an innocent person.If you enjoy anime horror, then I would recommend giving this series a try.

The series is mostly dealing with people who have grudges against someone else be they truly great or simply petty it doesn't really matter to Ai Enma also known as the Hell Girl.  Ai Enma has a website that if found by someone will give them the opportunity to avenge themselves on someone they feel has wronged them or their family,  the person who wishes to curse the person who wronged them makes a pact with Enma.  Enma will indeed send the cursed person to Hell for eternal punishment but the cost to the one who makes the bargain is just as sever,  he or she after their life is over will also be cursed to Hell as punishment for making the bargain and going through with it.  The series shows with each episode situations that have both the feeling that ""Yes this person does indeed deserve to go to Hell"",  but other situations show us that while it may seem harsh that it's for the most part Life,  meaning there are situations of just standard school bullying and taunting,  and so the question for the viewer is do some of these people deserve their consignment into Hell for some of these crimes.  I also like how they show after the person has done the deed and they see the aftermath they have to wonder if what they have done is truly worth it and if it's made their life better like they thought it would.  The picture is nice and clear and as always with Funimation the cast for both the English and Japanese cast did incredibly well.

1096168,A1WC03DMROIHB5,B000UR9TEQ,S. Cowen,"[0, 1]","A great anime series about a demonic girl named Ai Enma who gets revenge for people who have been wronged. Basically she sends their tormentors to hell in exchange for the persons own soul once they die also going to hell. She has three companions who help her along the way and the series deals with all type of subjects like bullying,harassment and infidelityThe prosVery interesting premise for an anime series or series period. To be honest I find some of the story lines in some anime more interesting than some of the live action shows I watch on tv. The characters are interesting and likable,Ai Enma and her three companions,Wanyudo, Honn Onna and Ren Ichimoku are the main protagonist,but there are a few others that are likable as well. The series has great back ground music which really puts you in the mode. The animation for the characters and back grounds is good and you will enjoy the work that went into it. Great series for people who like darker subject matter dealing with real life issues like stalking,domestic abuse,bulling and slander. It's great to watch something that doesn't always have to revolve around the standard things that you see in anime like dudes with giant swords and guns. This dvd is at a good price and has a number of extra features like round table interviews with the Japanese voice actors the full version of the opening and ending songs for season 1 plus promotional material. I almost forgot that the American voice actors are very good and I especially liked the person doing AI's voice. The option to switch to the original Japanese voice actors is there as well as the ability to have the Japanese voice actors with subtitles. Loved the box art which is something I usually don't care about.The consAs you have heard the show can get a bit repetitive and that's true. It didn't really bother me all that much,but might bother some. It deals with some pretty dark issues and might not be suitable for younger children. Also it doesn't really develop some of the more interesting characters like Ai's workers who help her with her jobs. I kept wanting to know more about them. Also I would have liked a few more episodes focusing on Ai herself. I also would have liked some interview with the American voice actors as well as the Japanese crew.The conclusionALL in all a great series that's very imaginative and fresh. Likable Characters and a interesting plot. A great show that has some room for improvement,but highly enjoyable.",4,One of my favorite anime series of all time.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,2482,"['great', 'anime', 'series', 'demonic', 'girl', 'named', 'Ai', 'Enma', 'who', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'wronged', 'Basically', 'tormentors', 'hell', 'exchange', 'persons', 'own', 'soul', 'die', 'also', 'going', 'hell', 'three', 'companions', 'who', 'help', 'way', 'series', 'deals', 'type', 'subjects', 'bullying', 'harassment', 'infidelityThe', 'prosVery', 'interesting', 'premise', 'anime', 'series', 'series', 'period', 'be', 'honest', 'find', 'story', 'lines', 'anime', 'more', 'interesting', 'live', 'action', 'shows', 'watch', 'tv', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'likable', 'Ai', 'Enma', 'three', 'companions', 'Wanyudo', 'Honn', 'Onna', 'Ren', 'Ichimoku', 'are', 'main', 'protagonist', 'are', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'likable', 'well', 'series', 'great', 'back', 'ground', 'music', 'really', 'mode', 'animation', 'characters', 'back', 'grounds', 'good', 'will', 'enjoy', 'work', 'went', 'Great', 'series', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'darker', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealing', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'stalking', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'bulling', 'slander', 'great', 'watch', 'something', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'revolve', 'standard', 'things', 'see', 'anime', 'dudes', 'giant', 'swords', 'guns', 'dvd', 'good', 'price', 'number', 'extra', 'features', 'round', 'table', 'interviews', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'full', 'version', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'season', '1', 'promotional', 'material', 'almost', 'forgot', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'liked', 'person', 'doing', 'AI', 'voice', 'option', 'switch', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'have', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'subtitles', 'Loved', 'box', 'art', 'something', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about.The', 'consAs', 'have', 'heard', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'that', 'much', 'might', 'bother', 'pretty', 'dark', 'issues', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'younger', 'children', 'Also', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Ai', 'workers', 'who', 'help', 'jobs', 'kept', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'focusing', 'Ai', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'interview', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'Japanese', 'crew.The', 'conclusionALL', 'great', 'series', 'very', 'imaginative', 'fresh', 'Likable', 'Characters', 'interesting', 'plot', 'great', 'show', 'room', 'improvement', 'highly', 'enjoyable']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"
1096169,A26TTBH1QNCVSF,B000UR9TEQ,Some Guy,"[1, 2]","I will start off by saying that Hell Girl is a superb anime.  It has a deep plot, compelling characters, a wonderful soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. I was taken with episode 1 and carried until episode 26.  I'll just say it's been since Code Geass that an anime captured me like this.Now a lot of the negative reviews have noted that the anime is repetitive, that all the episodes follow the same formula and as a result the show is boring.  If these are your thoughts then you were not watching it closely enough.  I'll admit the first ten episodes don't change their formula too drastically but in my opinion they're some of the best.  But I ask you, what is wrong with this?  This anime is about revenge, and the psychological ramifications of the harsh choices the characters are presented with.  For those who claim it is too repetative I'm curious as to what they are expected when they buy an anime called Hell Girl.  Has anyone seen House, that is one of the most formulaic shows on television and it's seven seasons of awesome.This is an anime that when you watch it you should try to imagine yourself in the character's shoes.  For those who thought the characters were weak and summoning Hell Girl under pathetic reasons might think differently if they suffered as some of the characters did.  I'm not saying I would pull the red string but I'd sure as Hell want those who wronged me to pay.  When you act in the moment sometimes you don't think about the future.  In the episode Purgatory Girl, the old man talked about how his destiny to suffer in Hell had hung over his head all his life.  When he summoned Hell Girl and pulled the string, he felt justified but in the end he couldn't move on.  Some of the characters might be fine for the moment once they've made their decisions but I'm sure it will come back to bite them in the ass.I might sound defensive with this review but it ticks me off when people bash something they're unable to grasp.

1096171,A3GSWTW4PGL2XC,B000UR9TEQ,Timothy Perper,"[2, 3]","SPOILERS -- sort of.""Hell Girl"" is a series of loosely related stories about revenge by proxy and cowardice, very Japanese in its single-minded focus in the art, characters, and narrative on only a few moral themes. When is it right not merely to kill someone but to send them to scream in Hell forever? Enma Ai, the elegant and deadly demon girl of the title, warns you there is a price: YOUR soul is also forfeit if you untie the red thread that signals your contract with Hell to take your resented enemies to a dark and eternal afterlife.Each episode tells a different version of a story where someone accepts this bargain. I have read bored fans who say that ""Hell Girl"" is slow, annoyingly repetitive, and never really makes any progress. And it is true that if you want demon battles, sword-swinging monsters, and raging hormones, you shouldn't bother with ""Hell Girl."" You are likely to be bored witless by these stories of desperation - bullied schoolgirls, terrified victims of vicious psychological blackmail, helpless frightened people who see no way out - and of why each turns to the dark paths of the demons to seek a freedom they cannot see how to reach otherwise. But ""Hell Girl"" was not made for fans of sword-swinging demon-and-hero stories. It is far subtler and - make no mistake about this - a great deal creepier. These stories get under the skin of one's mind and crawl around in there. (That means ""Hell Girl"" is NOT for children.)In parallel to these stories is the story of Enma Ai herself, and of a reporter and his daughter who are trying to track her down. No spoilers here: this story is riveting and thoroughly satisfying - and in some ways much creepier than all the other stories (which is saying a lot).The animation and plotting has the curious effect of making us want to reach into the story and shake up people. So we are caught in a bind as well, trapped by the same helpless desire for revenge that we are simultaneously watching. Don't underestimate the capacity of these stories to get at you. And throughout, the same moral question: is it right to seek revenge by demonic proxy - and be sent to Hell for it - or is it better to defeat not one's enemies but one's own cowardice? Beware of the knee-jerk answer: ""Hell Girl"" quite convincingly shows us, over and over, why people do not refuse Enma Ai's offer. ""Hell Girl"" is not a horror anime - it's much too sophisticated for that. It's unique in narrative, character, animation, and moral framework - not a nice story at all, but very powerful, like Enma Ai herself.Highly recommended.",5,"Stunningly Beautiful, Elegantly Simple, Extremely Difficult",1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2581,"['SPOILERS', 'sort', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'series', 'loosely', 'related', 'stories', 'revenge', 'proxy', 'cowardice', 'very', 'Japanese', 'single-minded', 'focus', 'art', 'characters', 'narrative', 'only', 'few', 'moral', 'themes', 'When', 'right', 'not', 'merely', 'kill', 'someone', 'send', 'scream', 'Hell', 'forever', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'elegant', 'deadly', 'demon', 'girl', 'title', 'price', 'YOUR', 'soul', 'also', 'forfeit', 'untie', 'red', 'thread', 'signals', 'contract', 'Hell', 'take', 'resented', 'enemies', 'dark', 'eternal', 'afterlife.Each', 'episode', 'different', 'version', 'story', 'where', 'someone', 'bargain', 'have', 'read', 'bored', 'fans', 'who', 'say', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'slow', 'annoyingly', 'repetitive', 'never', 'really', 'progress', 'true', 'want', 'demon', 'battles', 'sword-swinging', 'monsters', 'raging', 'hormones', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'witless', 'stories', 'desperation', 'bullied', 'schoolgirls', 'terrified', 'victims', 'vicious', 'psychological', 'blackmail', 'helpless', 'frightened', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'way', 'why', 'dark', 'paths', 'demons', 'seek', 'freedom', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'reach', 'otherwise', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'fans', 'sword-swinging', 'demon-and-hero', 'stories', 'far', 'subtler', 'make', 'mistake', 'great', 'deal', 'creepier', 'stories', 'get', 'skin', 'one', 'mind', 'crawl', 'around', 'there', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'NOT', 'children', 'parallel', 'stories', 'story', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'reporter', 'daughter', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'spoilers', 'here', 'story', 'riveting', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'ways', 'much', 'creepier', 'other', 'stories', 'saying', 'lot', 'animation', 'plotting', 'curious', 'effect', 'making', 'want', 'reach', 'story', 'shake', 'up', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'bind', 'as', 'well', 'trapped', 'same', 'helpless', 'desire', 'revenge', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'watching', 'Do', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'capacity', 'stories', 'get', 'same', 'moral', 'question', 'right', 'seek', 'revenge', 'demonic', 'proxy', 'be', 'sent', 'Hell', 'better', 'defeat', 'not', 'one', 'enemies', 'one', 'own', 'cowardice', 'Beware', 'knee-jerk', 'answer', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'refuse', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'offer', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'not', 'horror', 'anime', 'much', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'unique', 'narrative', 'character', 'animation', 'moral', 'framework', 'not', 'nice', 'story', 'very', 'powerful', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'herself.Highly', 'recommended']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"

The website in question is known as The Hell Link and the grievances aired on it are observed by a rather nondescript Japanese schoolgirl, relaxing in a hot spring or perhaps playing a game of marbles by herself.  But Enma Ai is no ordinary girl.  Her home is the underworld and her profession is a high-speed escort for the souls of the damned straight to hell. Accompanying this Hell Girl on her mission is a small crew of underworld denizens who collectively investigate the validity of each request and then aid in carrying out the punishment, a sort of waking nightmare that serves as a prelude to their journey to the abyss.  When some tortured soul enters their grievance on the Hell Link, they are given a choice to send their antagonizer to Hell.  But curses always come home to roost and the one who condemns another soul to damnation is destined to join them when their own life ends.  When I first heard about ""Hell Girl"", it struck me as the first of what will probably be manyDeath Noteclones riding the coattails of that series' wild success.  But the image of Ai Enma's striking red eyes and vividly beautiful kimono proved to be irresistable to this anime fan so I gave it a try.  It turns out that the two series' have almost nothing at all in common, though this show is certainly the inferior of the two.The problem with this show's first 5 episodes is that, for at least four of them, you are watching the exact same thing over and over.  The individual stories of each episode's protagonists are quite good and varied, but Hell Girl herself is consigned to word-for-word the same dialogue in almost every single episode.  We catch glimpses of her home life, and her partners are an interesting crew, but the ridiculously formulaic nature of these episodes gets old quick.  There needs to be some character development for the main cast here for this show to remain interesting for even one more volume.That said, I really did enjoy these first episodes.  The art is beautiful, the colors are amazing to look at, and Hell Girl herself is one of the most visually striking characters I've seen in some time. The soundtrack is very cool, with the most dramatic piece featuring an operatic choir backed by driving orchestral music and Slayer-esque double bass drums.  Very effective, though the beginning and ending themes aren't very notable.  The stories behind each curse are very good, but you could set your watch to the formula used in the first 4 episodes.  The 5th deviates from that formula while still incorporating most of the same elements, but we do get a little more insight to Hell Girl's operation in that episode so hopefully that will be the series' turning point away from the inevitably boring sameness the show seems to be heading towards.In the end, this is a show that is certainly worth viewing as there is not really anything else like it out there righ now; but only time will tell if the series can break it's own mold and take itself to the next level.  If not, then this first volume will be all the ""Hell Girl"" you need.",4,"""Care to give death a try?""",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,3200,"['humans', 'rumored', 'be', 'website', 'accessed', 'midnight', 'can', 'grant', 'retribution', 'wronged', 'price', 'website', 'question', 'known', 'Hell', 'Link', 'grievances', 'aired', 'are', 'observed', 'rather', 'nondescript', 'Japanese', 'schoolgirl', 'relaxing', 'hot', 'spring', 'perhaps', 'playing', 'game', 'marbles', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'home', 'underworld', 'profession', 'high-speed', 'escort', 'souls', 'damned', 'straight', 'hell', 'Accompanying', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'mission', 'small', 'crew', 'underworld', 'denizens', 'who', 'collectively', 'investigate', 'validity', 'request', 'then', 'aid', 'carrying', 'out', 'punishment', 'sort', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'prelude', 'journey', 'abyss', 'When', 'tortured', 'soul', 'enters', 'grievance', 'Hell', 'Link', 'are', 'given', 'choice', 'send', 'antagonizer', 'Hell', 'always', 'come', 'home', 'roost', 'one', 'who', 'soul', 'damnation', 'destined', 'join', 'when', 'own', 'life', 'ends', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'struck', 'first', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'manyDeath', 'Noteclones', 'riding', 'coattails', 'series', 'wild', 'success', 'image', 'Ai', 'Enma', 'striking', 'red', 'eyes', 'vividly', 'beautiful', 'kimono', 'proved', 'be', 'irresistable', 'anime', 'fan', 'gave', 'try', 'out', 'two', 'series', 'have', 'almost', 'nothing', 'common', 'show', 'certainly', 'inferior', 'two.The', 'problem', 'show', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'least', 'four', 'are', 'watching', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'individual', 'stories', 'episode', 'protagonists', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'varied', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'consigned', 'word-for-word', 'same', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'single', 'episode', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'home', 'life', 'partners', 'are', 'interesting', 'crew', 'ridiculously', 'formulaic', 'nature', 'episodes', 'old', 'quick', 'be', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'cast', 'here', 'show', 'remain', 'interesting', 'even', 'one', 'more', 'volume.That', 'said', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'first', 'episodes', 'art', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'are', 'amazing', 'look', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'striking', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'cool', 'most', 'dramatic', 'piece', 'featuring', 'operatic', 'choir', 'backed', 'driving', 'orchestral', 'music', 'Slayer-esque', 'double', 'bass', 'drums', 'Very', 'effective', 'beginning', 'ending', 'themes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'notable', 'stories', 'curse', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'set', 'watch', 'formula', 'used', 'first', '4', 'episodes', '5th', 'deviates', 'formula', 'still', 'incorporating', 'most', 'same', 'elements', 'do', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'operation', 'episode', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'turning', 'point', 'away', 'inevitably', 'boring', 'sameness', 'show', 'be', 'heading', 'end', 'show', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'righ', 'now', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'series', 'can', 'break', 'own', 'mold', 'take', 'next', 'level', 'not', 'then', 'first', 'volume', 'will', 'be', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'need']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"

Shows likeTwilight Zone,Night Galleryand old comic series likeVault Of HorrorandTales From The Crypt, were all once hugely popular.  Although the anthology format has almost disappeared in the US, it still retains its popularity in Japan, especially with horror.""Hell Girl"" (A literal translation of the Japanese title,""Jigoku Shojo"") is a great horror anthology series, steeped in traditional Japanese folklore.  The Hell Girl herself, Enma Ai, has her name taken from Enma-O, the judge of the dead who balances the karmic scales and sends people to hell.  She rides in Wanyudo, a flaming oxcart wheel with a man's face in the center that is said to be the traditional method of transport to Hell.  Wanyudo is also one of Enma Ai's companions in meeting out vengeance, along with Hone Onna, the Bone Woman, and Ren Ichimoku who is a tsukumogami.Each episode is essentially a new story, following a standard pattern.  Someone is being victimized, and so they go to a website called ""Hell Correspondence,"" where they enter in the names of the person they want revenge on.  Enma Ai then appears, and hands them a straw doll with a red string around its neck.  She explains that if they pull the string, who ever they have a grudge against will be sent immediately to Hell, but in payment the string-puller will also go to Hell when they die naturally.  This compact is sealed by a sign upon the string-pullers chest, showing they are hell-bound.The stories range from common problems like stalking and bullying to irresponsible doctors and uncaring mothers.  Some of the episodes are cut-and-dry, but some are more complicated such as when Enma Ai refuses someone because their ""rage is not strong enough.""  Later, some of the back story of Enma Ai and her group are revealed, such as how Wanyudo came to join the group and the relationships between the Hell Group.  In Episode fourteen, Takuma Kurebayashi is introduced, who becomes a continuing character in some linked stories later on.""Hell Girl"" was a hugely popular series in Japan, with two more seasons as well as a being adapted into a comic book and a live-action TV series.  The following series still have the anthology format, but go even deeper into the Enma Ai's story.Funimation's ""Hell Girl"" release contains all 26 episodes of the first season, packaged onto four disks in slim cases.  The presentation is really beautiful, as lovely as the animation inside.  There are some nice bonus features, like a video character profile of Enma Ai that was used to promote the series, and a round-table discussion with the Japanese voice actors on what the series means.  There is also a live-action music video, a ""Making of"" that video, and a textless opening and closing.I thought ""Hell Girl"" was a great series. I love Japanese folklore, and it was great to see it so well-handled.  I hope Funimation keeps up with the series and delivers the next two seasons!",4,Straight to Hell,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,2969,"['horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'long', 'history', 'Shows', 'likeTwilight', 'Zone', 'Night', 'Galleryand', 'old', 'comic', 'series', 'likeVault', 'HorrorandTales', 'Crypt', 'were', 'once', 'hugely', 'popular', 'anthology', 'format', 'almost', 'disappeared', 'US', 'still', 'popularity', 'Japan', 'especially', 'horror', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'literal', 'translation', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Jigoku', 'Shojo', 'great', 'horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'steeped', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'name', 'taken', 'Enma-O', 'judge', 'dead', 'who', 'karmic', 'scales', 'people', 'hell', 'Wanyudo', 'flaming', 'oxcart', 'wheel', 'man', 'face', 'center', 'said', 'be', 'traditional', 'method', 'transport', 'Hell', 'Wanyudo', 'also', 'one', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'companions', 'meeting', 'out', 'vengeance', 'Hone', 'Onna', 'Bone', 'Woman', 'Ren', 'Ichimoku', 'who', 'tsukumogami.Each', 'episode', 'essentially', 'new', 'story', 'following', 'standard', 'pattern', 'Someone', 'being', 'victimized', 'so', 'go', 'website', 'called', 'Hell', 'Correspondence', 'where', 'enter', 'names', 'person', 'want', 'revenge', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'then', 'straw', 'doll', 'red', 'string', 'neck', 'pull', 'string', 'who', 'ever', 'have', 'grudge', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'immediately', 'Hell', 'payment', 'string-puller', 'will', 'also', 'go', 'Hell', 'when', 'die', 'naturally', 'compact', 'sealed', 'sign', 'string-pullers', 'chest', 'showing', 'are', 'hell-bound.The', 'stories', 'range', 'common', 'problems', 'stalking', 'bullying', 'irresponsible', 'doctors', 'uncaring', 'mothers', 'episodes', 'are', 'cut-and-dry', 'are', 'more', 'complicated', 'such', 'when', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'someone', 'rage', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'Later', 'back', 'story', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'group', 'are', 'revealed', 'such', 'how', 'Wanyudo', 'came', 'join', 'group', 'relationships', 'Hell', 'Group', 'Episode', 'fourteen', 'Takuma', 'Kurebayashi', 'introduced', 'who', 'continuing', 'character', 'linked', 'stories', 'later', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'was', 'hugely', 'popular', 'series', 'Japan', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'adapted', 'comic', 'book', 'live-action', 'TV', 'series', 'following', 'series', 'still', 'have', 'anthology', 'format', 'go', 'even', 'deeper', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'story.Funimation', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'release', '26', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'packaged', 'four', 'disks', 'slim', 'cases', 'presentation', 'really', 'beautiful', 'as', 'lovely', 'animation', 'inside', 'are', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'video', 'character', 'profile', 'Enma', 'Ai', 'was', 'used', 'promote', 'series', 'round-table', 'discussion', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'what', 'series', 'also', 'live-action', 'music', 'video', 'Making', 'video', 'textless', 'opening', 'closing.I', 'thought', 'Hell', 'Girl', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'love', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'so', 'well-handled', 'hope', 'Funimation', 'up', 'series', 'next', 'two', 'seasons']","Hell Girl, Vol. 1 - Butterfly"
