664800,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,B00005M1Z9,"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess""","[2, 4]","After getting hooked with &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and the movie &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (gifts from my beloved ^_^) I began my own venture into anime, deciding first to check out Vampire Princess Miyu as it sounded very interesting. I did, however, start with vol.'s 1 &amp; 2 of the OAV's which I recommend before watching these as it will answers many questions some might have, like how did Miyu become the guardian and why is Larva's devotion to protect her unwavering?Here is a summary of the three episodes found on vol. 1 - Initiation:On &quot;The Fang Knows&quot; several young girls keep appearing dead. Machiyama, a young man from their school stumbles upon one of them lying in the street, drained of all her blood with two puncture wounds found on her neck. He suspects it's the work of a vampire, and he believes that that vampire is Miyu. He saw her walking away from the site, mysteriously vanishing into a cloud of mist. Suddenly she's a new classmate and so he follows her around (or tries to, anyway), determined to prove that his speculations aren't just his imagination. In the meantime a teacher is being harassed by some of her students who witnessed her doing something regrettable...something they won't seem to ever let her forget...&quot;At the Next Station&quot; is my favorite of the three. Miyu has made some friends from the school she now attends and is fitting in well, but as she tries to act normal she must also deal with a shinma (stray demon) who is behind the disappearances of many beautiful women - all of whom were last seen riding on the last car of a train (can't really say much about this one without giving everything away).On &quot;The Forest Calls&quot; a young man is plagued with nightmares and his behavior becomes abnormally strange after his father receives an odd looking mask from Africa that a witch doctor might have worn in the past to cast spells. Larva, however, has come face to face with the mask once before yet he does not understand its magical powers. He was unable to defeat it then, obviously, but it's slowly taking over Kouichi's life and Miyu must put a stop to the shinma's evil reign before it destroys anyone else.The TV series for Vampire Princess Miyu is a good anime, and the music by Kawai Kenji is gorgeous and haunting, but it does not live up to the amazing OAV's. I prefer whoever did the voice and drawings for Miyu on the OAV's better for they put more emotion into her voice and expressions. Here she almost seems lifeless... Also, what ever happened to spiritualist Himiko? I haven't watched every episode yet but she hasn't been mentioned, nor seen, once. As for the fluffy, recurring character of Shiina, well I'm not too crazy about that particular addition but luckily she doesn't show up much. It's a &quot;good&quot; shinma that has the ability to sense things just before they're about to happen and can see far into the distance with its red, bloodshot eye when it's no longer being covered with its long white ear (kind of resembles a bunny). Overall, though, if you enjoyed the wonderful OAV's then I'd continue with this but expect to be a little disappointed. It's not as good but it certainly has its moments.",4,"Good, but not without its flaws",1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,3211,"['getting', 'hooked', 'quot', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quot', 'gifts', 'beloved', '^_^', 'began', 'own', 'venture', 'anime', 'deciding', 'first', 'check', 'out', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'sounded', 'very', 'interesting', 'did', 'however', 'start', 'vol', '1', 'amp', '2', 'OAV', 'recommend', 'watching', 'will', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'how', 'did', 'Miyu', 'become', 'guardian', 'why', 'Larva', 'devotion', 'protect', 'unwavering', 'Here', 'summary', 'three', 'episodes', 'found', 'vol', '1', 'Initiation', 'quot', 'Fang', 'Knows', 'quot', 'several', 'young', 'girls', 'keep', 'appearing', 'dead', 'Machiyama', 'young', 'man', 'school', 'stumbles', 'one', 'lying', 'street', 'drained', 'blood', 'two', 'puncture', 'wounds', 'found', 'neck', 'work', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'Miyu', 'saw', 'walking', 'away', 'site', 'mysteriously', 'vanishing', 'cloud', 'mist', 'Suddenly', 'new', 'classmate', 'so', 'around', 'anyway', 'determined', 'prove', 'speculations', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'imagination', 'meantime', 'teacher', 'being', 'harassed', 'students', 'who', 'witnessed', 'doing', 'something', 'regrettable', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'ever', 'let', 'forget', 'quot', 'Next', 'Station', 'quot', 'favorite', 'three', 'Miyu', 'made', 'friends', 'school', 'now', 'fitting', 'well', 'act', 'normal', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'shinma', 'stray', 'demon', 'who', 'disappearances', 'many', 'beautiful', 'women', 'whom', 'were', 'last', 'seen', 'riding', 'last', 'car', 'train', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'one', 'giving', 'everything', 'away', '.On', 'quot', 'Forest', 'Calls', 'quot', 'young', 'man', 'plagued', 'nightmares', 'behavior', 'abnormally', 'strange', 'father', 'odd', 'looking', 'mask', 'Africa', 'witch', 'doctor', 'might', 'have', 'worn', 'past', 'cast', 'spells', 'Larva', 'however', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'mask', 'once', 'before', 'yet', 'not', 'understand', 'magical', 'powers', 'was', 'unable', 'defeat', 'then', 'obviously', 'slowly', 'taking', 'over', 'Kouichi', 'life', 'Miyu', 'must', 'put', 'stop', 'shinma', 'evil', 'reign', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'TV', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'good', 'anime', 'music', 'Kawai', 'Kenji', 'gorgeous', 'haunting', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'amazing', 'OAV', 'prefer', 'whoever', 'did', 'voice', 'drawings', 'Miyu', 'OAV', 'better', 'put', 'more', 'emotion', 'voice', 'expressions', 'Here', 'almost', 'lifeless', 'Also', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'spiritualist', 'Himiko', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'episode', 'yet', ""n't"", 'been', 'mentioned', 'seen', 'once', 'fluffy', 'recurring', 'character', 'Shiina', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'crazy', 'particular', 'addition', 'luckily', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'much', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'shinma', 'ability', 'sense', 'things', 'just', ""'re"", 'happen', 'can', 'see', 'far', 'distance', 'red', 'bloodshot', 'eye', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'covered', 'long', 'white', 'ear', 'kind', 'resembles', 'bunny', 'Overall', 'though', 'enjoyed', 'wonderful', 'OAV', 'then', ""'d"", 'continue', 'expect', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'certainly', 'moments']",Vampire Princess Miyu: Initiation

The DVD has three episodes on it the first being ...THE FANG KNOWS..In this episode Miyu must find out who or what is murding people had the school she has just enrolled in....episode 2 AT THE NEXT STATION...advances the plot a bit as Miyu makes friends and must dicover who is kidnapping beautiful women riding the subway...THE FOREST CALLS...Miyu's guardian Lava steps up and must deal with a magical mask which controls the one who wears it...All in all VPM is a great series and I cannot wait for the next dvd in the series.

664805,A1TGXBJ96E9B8B,B00005M1Z9,James M. Stafford III,"[11, 12]","The Vampire Princess Miyu TV series features Miyu and Larva from the OAV series, but with some differences.  At 26 episdoes, there is ample time for character development, providing an alternate background story for both Miyu and Larva.  Beginning with Episode 2, the location of action shifts from Kyoto to Tokyo, where Miyu befriends (rather, is befriended by) three classmates in an all-girl school, yet she must keep her true identity and purpose from her friends.  Also, Miyu's rival appears occasionally throughout the series, adding another element of intrigue.  Most episodes follow a &quot;shinma of the week&quot; format, each with different abilities and most also receiving great character development.Those who enjoyed the Vampire Princess Miyu OAV series will absolutely LOVE the TV series!!!!!  While not necessarily as dark as the OAV series, the improved character development and additional character interactions are a great treat.  The music is superb, simultaneously haunting and enchanting.

I found the pace of the TV episodes a little faster than the OVAs, not really developing who each Shinma was. You get bits and pieces, then Miyu banishes them to The Dark and it is all over. But all in all it is a good buy.One thing I found kind of annoying is that it seems none of the TokyoPop staff seemed to have read AnimEigo's liner notes for the OEM to see that AnimEigo had contacted the author, Ms. Kakinouchi, to get the correct romanizations of character names such as Larva (*NOT* Lava) and Lemures (which is actually Latin to begin with).

If you have never seen the OVA, fine. If you have, you may or may not be disappointed. The OVA was pure horror at its finest. This series is mostly creepy and spooky, with a few moments of horror. It is a kind of Spooky Sailor Moon, except that Miyu and her supernatural friends are completely humorless. Larva, one of anime's most fascinating characters in the OVA, is still formidable, but his bishoujen (pretty boy) face is featured on many of the series' DVD covers as a romantic Tuxedo Mask character.&quot;Initiation&quot; has only three episodes. Later discs in the series have four or even five. But these three get the series off to a dark start, with great stories, lovely animation, and haunting music.Episode 1: The Fang Knows - Miyu enrolls in a high school. A male student suspects Miyu is more than an ordinary girl. He vows to get to the bottom of it, while having a weird crush on his teacher. This teacher is being blackmailed by vicious girls in her class. All this leads to a violent backlash.Episode 2: At the Next Station - One of the scariest in the series. Extremely chilling; harkens back to the OVA with it's pure horror.Episode 3: The Forest Calls - An African mask has a strange hold on a boy.Each DVD has an insert of great illustrated notes by the animator. Some of his Shinma are pretty out there - one is a combination of a horse and a piano. Again, reminds me so much of the Youma in Sailor Moon. But he stresses in the notes he has wanted to remain true to and emphasize Japanese culture, which he does beautifully sometimes.",4,Beginning of a Good Anime Series,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1669,"['Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'vol', '1', 'quot', 'Initiation', 'quot', 'series', 'many', 'volumes', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'OVA', 'fine', 'have', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'OVA', 'was', 'pure', 'horror', 'finest', 'series', 'mostly', 'creepy', 'spooky', 'few', 'moments', 'horror', 'kind', 'Spooky', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Miyu', 'supernatural', 'friends', 'are', 'completely', 'humorless', 'Larva', 'one', 'anime', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'OVA', 'still', 'formidable', 'bishoujen', 'pretty', 'boy', 'face', 'featured', 'many', 'series', 'DVD', 'covers', 'romantic', 'Tuxedo', 'Mask', 'character.', 'quot', 'Initiation', 'quot', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'Later', 'discs', 'series', 'have', 'four', 'even', 'five', 'three', 'get', 'series', 'dark', 'start', 'great', 'stories', 'lovely', 'animation', 'haunting', 'music.Episode', '1', 'Fang', 'Knows', 'Miyu', 'high', 'school', 'male', 'student', 'suspects', 'Miyu', 'more', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'get', 'bottom', 'having', 'weird', 'crush', 'teacher', 'teacher', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'vicious', 'girls', 'class', 'violent', 'backlash.Episode', '2', 'Next', 'Station', 'One', 'scariest', 'series', 'Extremely', 'chilling', 'back', 'OVA', 'pure', 'horror.Episode', '3', 'Forest', 'Calls', 'African', 'mask', 'strange', 'hold', 'boy.Each', 'DVD', 'insert', 'great', 'illustrated', 'notes', 'animator', 'Shinma', 'are', 'pretty', 'there', 'one', 'combination', 'horse', 'piano', 'Again', 'so', 'much', 'Youma', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'notes', 'wanted', 'remain', 'true', 'emphasize', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'beautifully', 'sometimes']",Vampire Princess Miyu: Initiation

She is accompanied by Lava, a Shinma who has left the evil ways of his kind behind and serves Miyu unquestioningly.  The series was noted for its artistic and atmospheric qualities and had a strong effect on the many vampire anime that followed it.The Fang KnowsWhen Matchiyama, a young high school student comes upon Miyu while she is investigating a murder he decides that she is the vampire behind the murderers.  But the truth is more complex than the boy suspects and will reveal a tragic element behind the deaths.  Sometimes things are even worse than they seem.At the Next StationMiyu transfers to a new high school and finds herself making friends with several fellow students. Especially Chisato Inoue, who takes an unexpected liking to the normally distant vampire.  Miyu discovers that the neighborhood has been plagued the disappearances of a series of beautiful women, all associated with the subway.  Miyu confronts the Shinma, but there is little help for the lost souls of its victims.The Forest CallsWhen an African mask has strange effects on the brother of on of Miyu's friends the vampire investigates and discovers that Lava remembers a past encounter with the Shinma behind the mask.  But this spirit is not entirely evil, just deeply angry about the ruining of the forests of its homeland.This new, made-for-TV series has been updated considerable form the original OVA.  Among the casualties of the change is the Art Nouveau flavor of the first series.  But this isn't a real loss, as the updated work is still just as compelling, but in a different way.  Lava has been tinkered with as well, sometimes appearing without a mask.  Miyu also has an additional companion, a lesser Shinma called Shiina.
