So, it is nice to have it on DVD.The plot for this movie had been filmed before, in the 1940's, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck (titled ""Remember the Night"").  Pretty good back then, but a little on the dark side by modern Christmas movie standards.  This remake, makes it lighter than air, but also takes a little of the believability out of it.  However, the leads are great, and very likable, and who's to quibble.  It's a very entertaining way to spend a Christmas time evening.By the way, this plot was used again, in ""Undercover Christmas"" with Jamie Gertz, and Tyne Daly.

1550787,AQRPH8IDODK6X,B008D1RDM6,Courtney.,"[6, 7]","The random case cover, disc & DVD menu art work that has nothing to do with the movie really bothers me. The 'chapter selection' reads ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"" ,""Chapter 3"", etc- but no pictures or titles to tell us at which point of the movie these chapters will lead too (in the movie itself there are title cards to break between scenes, but the chapter selections poorly miss them by about 5 seconds, or don't use them at all). The CD is just really unnecessary, and the movie itself looks somewhat better than if you recorded it on your DVR or even a VHS whenever it aired on TV, but I wouldn't say by much. Not to mention the movie title has always been written as ""On The 2nd Day of Christmas"" where as on this case it's written ""Second"". When you put the movie in and the title comes up, it's ""2nd"" so I think it's really obvious how quick and careless this was done.  I gave it two stars because I really love this movie and was glad people decided to release it, no matter how lacking the release is... but I advise people to, if you have it recorded or can find it online, to burn it to a disc yourself and buy a cheap case, because you aren't getting much better with this, and would cost less. I actually (with the help of my label maker) made new covers for the case&DVD with pictures from the actual movie, and quickly typed up where each chapter leads on a piece of paper to just stick in the case (like some DVDs actually come with). I also took the CD&it's holder out, it was easy enough. Unfortunately I can't change what it looks like when the DVD menu comes up on screen, but I am just glad to own the movie, so maybe I shouldn't complain so much? = )",2,"Love the movie, disappointed in release.",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,1672,"['random', 'case', 'cover', 'disc', 'DVD', 'menu', 'art', 'work', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'really', 'bothers', ""'chapter"", 'selection', 'reads', 'Chapter', '1', 'Chapter', '2', 'Chapter', '3', 'etc-', 'pictures', 'titles', 'tell', 'point', 'movie', 'chapters', 'will', 'lead', 'too', 'movie', 'are', 'title', 'cards', 'break', 'scenes', 'chapter', 'selections', 'poorly', 'miss', '5', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'CD', 'just', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'better', 'recorded', 'DVR', 'even', 'VHS', 'whenever', 'aired', 'TV', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'Not', 'mention', 'movie', 'title', 'always', 'been', 'written', '2nd', 'Day', 'Christmas', 'where', 'case', 'written', 'Second', 'When', 'put', 'movie', 'title', 'up', '2nd', 'so', 'think', 'really', 'obvious', 'how', 'quick', 'careless', 'was', 'done', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'glad', 'people', 'decided', 'release', 'matter', 'how', 'lacking', 'release', 'advise', 'people', 'have', 'recorded', 'can', 'find', 'burn', 'disc', 'yourself', 'buy', 'cheap', 'case', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'cost', 'less', 'actually', 'help', 'label', 'maker', 'made', 'new', 'covers', 'case', 'DVD', 'pictures', 'actual', 'movie', 'quickly', 'typed', 'up', 'where', 'chapter', 'piece', 'paper', 'just', 'stick', 'case', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'come', 'also', 'took', 'CD', 'holder', 'out', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'what', 'when', 'DVD', 'menu', 'up', 'screen', 'am', 'just', 'glad', 'own', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'complain', 'so', 'much', '=']",N/A

Two of our favorite actors, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mark Ruffalo(And don't forget a bit by Howard aka Johnny Fever Hesseman)in a goofy but touching, holiday flick.  It has it all: comedy, romance, kids, New York backdrop, Santa's of different sorts and, of course, a theme about what's important this time of year.Masterson plays a pick-pocket who works with her young ward, in tandem, fleecing the wealthy populace of New York City.  They don't steal from the poor, and they only take cash, no credit cards, and they mail back the wallets to the victims.  Hmm.  They get caught at a big department store by the security man, who wishes he was a  real policeman or a successful jingle tune writer, Ruffalo; however, the grumpy old owner, who wants to prosecute, decides to wait until after Christmas.  Ruffalo's character is forced to take her into his custody and home until then.  Whew, now that's a stretch of reality, but an entertaining one, as they struggle with the arrangement and each other and the growing feelings of attraction.The story's humerous and lighthearted with lots of family interactions and sentiment.  We all know where this is headed, and for those of us who love these kind of movies, we joyfully go along and are not disappointed.
