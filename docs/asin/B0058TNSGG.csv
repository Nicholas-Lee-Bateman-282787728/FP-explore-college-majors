The Album ""August and Everything After"" was an ""Awesome"" debut album from 1994, and this live concert has the Counting Crows' performing the album, live, song by song, as listed on the debut album. The lead singer Adam Duritz gets very emotional in his performances in this live concert dvd. Also, the band is fantastic. The Counting Crows consists of a relatively large rock band. Adam makes some comments during the concert, for example, he tells the story of the song ""Omaha"", and how the Mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, offered to give Adam & the band ""The Key to the City of Omaha"", then Adam states that he has never even been there. He just wrote the song about the city, Omaha, because it was in the ""middle of America"".Plus, there is a bonus feature that includes an indepth interview with Adam Duritz & Charlie Gillingham.If you like the Counting Crows & ""August and Everything After"", then you'll certainly enjoy this great concert dvd.

I have hundreds of music/concert dvds & I can think of only a few  that are worthy of 5 stars.Not a huge C.C. fan but do like their studio versions on cd.  2 flaws I noticed immediately on this dvd that un-surprisingly no one else has mentioned:1. For a blu-ray video I didn't notice anything really special about the video quality. Hard to tell the difference from standard def. Other concert blu-rays the colors & crispness really jump off the screen but not this one.2. The lead singers voice doesn't do justice to the studio versions of their songs. Some songs aren't even close to their original versions.  Maybe it was the end of a long tour or something...but kind of disappointing.Still a slightly better than average dvd...& I disagree strongly with reviewers who give this 5 stars.,3,Good but some flaws,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,888,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'easily', 'people', 'will', 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'product', 'have', 'hundreds', 'music/concert', 'dvds', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'few', 'are', 'worthy', '5', 'stars.Not', 'huge', 'C.C', 'fan', 'do', 'studio', 'versions', 'cd', '2', 'flaws', 'noticed', 'immediately', 'dvd', 'un-surprisingly', 'one', 'else', 'mentioned:1', 'blu-ray', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'really', 'special', 'video', 'quality', 'Hard', 'tell', 'difference', 'standard', 'def', 'Other', 'concert', 'blu-rays', 'colors', 'crispness', 'really', 'jump', 'off', 'screen', 'not', 'one.2', 'lead', 'singers', 'voice', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'studio', 'versions', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'original', 'versions', 'Maybe', 'was', 'end', 'long', 'tour', 'something', 'kind', 'disappointing.Still', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'dvd', 'disagree', 'strongly', 'reviewers', 'who', 'give', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1445396,AOZLTHXD6MDBJ,B0058TNSGG,Red Ball Jets,"[0, 3]","This was an interesting video.... Good but interesting?The only downside I saw was the stage was on the dark side for a home video.The singer is very passionate about his performance and decides to sing his songs in the manner that some artists choose to sing the Star Spangled Banner by improvising and putting their own &#34;touches&#34; on the song.This always has me asking myself &#34;why&#34;?There's about a dozen reasons why singers decide to go in this direction vocally and I don't have time to analyze.Anyway, the sound is good, camera work is good, music is mixed nicely, the lighting is dark.So ask yourself this... If &#34;Mr. Jones&#34; is a 4:00 minute radio song, on this DVD it may be closer to 6:00 to 8:00 minutes long.And that's just an example.If you want to hear the songs the way they play on the radio, you're not gonna hear that on this DVD. If you like the songs sung with free style vocal improvisation, this DVD may be a very good fit for you.I liked it but I'm a musician so I dig stuff like that.But there were others watching it with me that didn't like it, they thought it was overbearing, overplayed and vocally irritating?The question is...

Recorded in 2007, the original idea for this album was to have a concert at Town Hall with friends of the band who had been involved in their career somehow. As an inside joke and as Adam explains in the 40 minute documentary included as the only extra of the BD, they toyed with the idea of playing their 1993 debut album in its entirety, they ended up liking this idea better and cancelled the planned collaborations, Jakob Dylan being one of them. This is worth mentioning in case someone was expecting to listen to the band's greatest hits live, this is a live presentation of their complete first album!The album opens with an outstanding rendition of 'Round Here', in my opinion, the best version of the song I have heard from the band; the opening song is a perfect example of what to expect from the concert, the band sounding better than ever, Adam's heart-felt singing, a lot of improvisation with Adam adding lyrics on the go as well as using lyrics from other songs, specifically 'Raining in Baltimore' and 'Private Archipelago'. It is quite impressive and worth mentioning the synergy of the band, if you did not know they were improvising you couldn't really tell as it looks and sounds as if rehearsed.One after another, the band delivers incredible an updated versions of all the songs from their debut album, going sometimes as far as including bits of Springsteen's 'Thunder Road' in between the lyrics for 'Rain King'The HD video presentation is quite impressive(1080i, 1.78:1), while I did notice a few cases in which the image didn't look as good as a BD can look, those were a few and not worth worrying about. The performance looks as good as the PBS special for 'Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings' (which aired on HD and unfortunately has not been released on BD)Audio quality is just amazing, the HD audio track included (DTS HD) will blow you away if you have a good sound system, no album from the band has sounded as good as this one does. They did a great job mixing the audio, additionally LPCM stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 are included.This is a concert I know I will be watching over and over, now, bring on the VH1 Storytellers! or at least the PBS Soundstage special! If they could give the same treatment for all their released albums well, that would just be amazing and appreciated.Highly recommended!",5,The wait is over... and it was well worth it,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2478,"['20', 'years', 'being', 'around', 'Everything', 'Live', 'Town', 'Hall', 'first', 'live', 'audio/video', 'release', 'band', 'Recorded', '2007', 'original', 'idea', 'album', 'was', 'have', 'concert', 'Town', 'Hall', 'friends', 'band', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'career', 'somehow', 'inside', 'joke', 'Adam', '40', 'minute', 'documentary', 'included', 'only', 'extra', 'BD', 'toyed', 'idea', 'playing', '1993', 'debut', 'album', 'entirety', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'idea', 'better', 'cancelled', 'planned', 'collaborations', 'Jakob', 'Dylan', 'being', 'one', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'case', 'someone', 'was', 'expecting', 'listen', 'band', 'greatest', 'hits', 'live', 'live', 'presentation', 'complete', 'first', 'album', 'album', 'outstanding', 'rendition', ""'Round"", 'Here', 'opinion', 'best', 'version', 'song', 'have', 'heard', 'band', 'opening', 'song', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'expect', 'concert', 'band', 'sounding', 'better', 'ever', 'Adam', 'heart-felt', 'singing', 'lot', 'improvisation', 'Adam', 'adding', 'lyrics', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'lyrics', 'other', 'songs', 'specifically', ""'Raining"", 'Baltimore', ""'Private"", 'Archipelago', 'quite', 'impressive', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'synergy', 'band', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'were', 'improvising', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'rehearsed.One', 'band', 'delivers', 'incredible', 'updated', 'versions', 'songs', 'debut', 'album', 'going', 'sometimes', 'as', 'far', 'including', 'bits', 'Springsteen', ""'Thunder"", 'Road', 'lyrics', ""King'The"", 'HD', 'video', 'presentation', 'quite', 'impressive', '1080i', '1.78:1', 'did', 'notice', 'few', 'cases', 'image', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'good', 'BD', 'can', 'look', 'were', 'few', 'not', 'worth', 'worrying', 'performance', 'as', 'good', 'PBS', 'special', ""'Saturday"", 'Nights', 'Sunday', 'Mornings', 'aired', 'HD', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'BD', 'Audio', 'quality', 'just', 'amazing', 'HD', 'audio', 'track', 'included', 'DTS', 'HD', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'have', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'album', 'band', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'mixing', 'audio', 'additionally', 'LPCM', 'stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'are', 'included.This', 'concert', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'now', 'bring', 'VH1', 'Storytellers', 'least', 'PBS', 'Soundstage', 'special', 'could', 'give', 'same', 'treatment', 'released', 'albums', 'well', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'amazing', 'appreciated.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
