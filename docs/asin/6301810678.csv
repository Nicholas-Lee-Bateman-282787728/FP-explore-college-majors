However, that is what the producers of this TV miniseries managed to do. The acting is often sub par and the dialog weak, it ends shortly after Abraham Lincoln is assassinated. To me, the lowest point was near the end shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant. The Union soldiers are sitting around their campfires and talking about the lives that were lost in getting to that point. Suddenly, they grab torches and begin marching around singing a song. These are people who survived over four years of brutal war, they are not going to be marching around singing, any singing they would do would no doubt be drunken revelry. A challenge for the lowest point is when the Stacy Keach character has a prophetic dream that Abraham Lincoln is in danger for his life.

270184,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,6301810678,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[134, 137]","First off, yes there are a lot of problems with this as factual history.  This is not Gettysburg or Gods and General.  Don't think they ever set out for it to be.  This is for the person who wants more personalities, more emotions and less history.  So PLEASE do not judge this against the two movies based on the Shaaras' Books.  This whole intent of this was distinctive different and it achieves what it set out to do.This is not for historians, this is for the people who have a little knowledge and interest in the Civil War - and likely that is all they want.For someone looking for a more emotional view of the Civil War, with more 'people and feelings' than true history, then this is a very nice read. It is the fictionalised account of the Geyers and the Hales, cousins - one family of the South, the other from the North, that find themselves divided and fighting each other during the War Between the States in the US. The Geyers were farmers, of the land, though were not slave owners, and the story focuses around their eldest son, John, an artist who went into the war as an artist correspondent, torn by his love for both families and seeing both sides of the argument. He hates the institution of Slavery, a hatred amplified by the hanging of his black friend, a freed man for hiding fugitive slaves. The Hales were city-folk. Not only were they divided on their views, but by their styles of life. You see all the various scenes of how families were divided, how the glory of war could turn sour for the many boys simply looking for adventure.There was a real John Geyser, and he did draw a lot of pictures as his time as a soldier. But he was not a war correspondent, and not that professional of an artists. Still is immature drawing carry a power to convey the horrors of war.So take the 'history' with a grain of salt and enjoy the 'emotions' of the great conflict that ripped families and friends apart.Stacey Keech is simply marvellous as Jonas Steel, and I defy anyone not to be moved by his and Julia Duffy's Mary performance as Mary, the woman Jonas loves and loves.  Duffy, best known for Designing Women and Bob Newheart, show a charming, heart-wrenching portrayal of sweet Mary.  Peck is super as Lincoln, in a roll he really wanted to play.So pop the popcorn and sit back and enjoy the sweeping 'Gone With the Wind' Hollywood version of the Civil War.  There is fine acting and a lot of nice 'historical' touches since Bruce Catton was consultant to the film.The DVD is the full length version.

The story follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the brothers, sisters and cousins during the war.It has an outstanding cast--Stacy Keach as the dark and mysterious Jonas Steele; Lloyd Bridges as the family patriarch Ben Geyser; Warren Oates as the sadist and somewhat mad Major Welles; Rip Thorn as the unassuming Ulysses Grant; Colleen Dewhurst as devoted mother Maggie Geyser who would suffer the most lost during the war; Rory Calhoun as George Meade the aging warrior; Robert Vaughn as Senator Reynolds who wanted to make sure that his beautiful daughter Kathy played by Kathleen Beller would marry in her class and to keep her away from that newspaper  man John Geyser played with such charm and passion by John Hammond.Gregory Peck delivered one of his best performances as Abraham Lincoln.  You believe in watching him that this was the President.Paul Winfield as Jonathan Henry a freedman living on the Geyer Farm gives a brilliant performance.  What happens to him is a historical reality of the times.The love story between Jonas Steele and Mary Hale, beautifully played by Julia Duffy, is brilliantly written and acted.  Like all great love stories there are joys and sorrows.One has to comment on Sergeant O'Toole.  Gerald S. O'Loughlin gave a stellar performance as the hard as nails sergeant who had a caring heart for his men.Don't watch this min-series for historical, tactical details of the battles.  It is character driven.  You have all of the stories-a nation torn apart, romance, fear, bravery, hope, dreams shattered, death of friends, family and enemies, human misery, and psychological trauma.The Wilderness battle in the last part is truly a depiction that war is hell.

It has no point, it makes no sense and it assumes the viewer is either brain dead or simply stupid.  Imagine - in the middle of this terrible war, a southern private gets a message to his cousin in the federal army to meet him that night for something important.  Two yankee soldiers and a correspondent (southerner's brother) meet the southern private, ride in his rowboat together to get to a barn dance behind southern lines - punch and girls and music to dance to.  Southern general catches them and is going to send the yankees away as POW's.  Southern private complains because he gave his word he'd see them back to their side of the river safely.  General relents because, as his private wonders, what's the point of the war if the southerner doesn't honor his word.  Then - he offers the southern private his choice of hard labor or joining the ""balloon corps.""Awful, awful, awful.

I still have the tape after 30 years and even though this movie holds great memories for me - the casting is GREAT, better than ""North & South"" a few years later and the look, tone, way it was shot, and overall ""Feel"" of this TV movie is wonderful and honestly feels more authentic to me than anything else done on the Civil War, covering this much of the war.

270195,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6301810678,Jeffrey Leach,"[81, 87]","Once upon a time in a place far, far away, I was a Civil War buff. I couldn't read enough books about the massive war between the North and the South from 1861 to 1865. I paged through texts about ironclads, reveled in the descriptions of Shiloh, Bull Run, and Cold Harbor. I studied pictures of the movements of troops led by George McClellan and Ulysses S. Grant, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. I thrilled to the drama of Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse. And I mourned as Abraham Lincoln fell to a southern assassin's bullet at Ford's Theater. I would read books by Bruce Catton, a sort of everyman's historian of the war who churned out books by the boatload twenty or thirty years ago. Moreover, and probably most importantly, I yearned to watch shows and movies based on events during the war. I remember being presently surprised at the time to learn that a huge mini-series, called &quot;The Blue and the Gray,&quot; would soon air on television. Finally, I would see the events, people, and places I had only read about before. Yep, I vividly remember watching this series when it first premiered on television over twenty years ago. And I liked it, at the time. When I saw it coming out on DVD, I decided to watch it all over again.The passing of years can definitely modify prior assumptions. While I found parts of &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; intriguing, far too often the film descended into the deepest depths of sentimentality of the sappiest sort. The star of the picture is John Geyser (John Hammond), a young man with a knack for drawing who lives on his parents' farm in Virginia. He's got a bunch of brothers, a sister preparing to marry a successful businessman from Vicksburg, and several slaves. He yearns to head north, to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where his Uncle Jacob runs a newspaper. John figures his relative will hire him on the spot once he shows the man his drawings. Geyser gets the job when his uncle assigns him to cover the John Brown trial and the abolitionist's subsequent execution. At the proceedings, John meets Jonas Steele (Stacy Keach), a shady character with ties to the Pinkerton Agency and to the White House. A fast friendship forms between the two, with an even faster bond emerging between Steele and John's cousin Mary Hale (Julia Duffy). John heads back to his Virginia farm just in time to witness a bunch of bounty hunters commit a heinous crime against Jonathan Henry (Paul Winfield) for harboring a fugitive slave. At one point, young Geyser even meets the newly elected Abraham Lincoln (Gregory Peck).By the time the war breaks out, John Geyser's artwork covering the Brown trial lands him a job at Harper's as a war correspondent. It's just as well since John refuses to fight for the Union or the Confederacy, a position that alienates him from his pro-southern family. His anti-war views do not stop him from facing danger as he rescues the daughter of Senator Reynolds (Robert Vaughn), a girl named Kathy (Kathleen Beller), at the Battle of Bull Run. Predictably, John and Kathy become an item. So do Jonas Steele and Mary Hale when they tie the knot after Jonas joins the Union Army. We also learn Steele possesses an annoying psychic power that allows him to foresee disastrous events. Meanwhile, as Vicksburg falls to the North, John's sister loses her husband and nearly loses her child in the siege of that city. As the war grinds on and on with no end in sight, members of both branches of the family, Hale and Geyser, fall on the battlefield from bullet, disease, or both.This rather slipshod summary will have to suffice for a series that runs nearly six hours. The filmmakers did a good job covering many of the important issues of the day. John's internal conflict over whether he should fight or not, and for what side, is one many Americans faced during that conflict. Battle sequences inevitably rely on budgetary restrictions, so the only lengthy combat sequence is the Battle of Bull Run. It seems the filmmakers wished to focus on things not widely known about the Civil War, such as the use of hot air balloons for aerial surveillance, a repeating carbine, and the horrible conditions of prisoner of war camps. The movie keeps violence to a minimum, as per television standards, but a viewer does get the sense that the Civil War was no walk in the park for both soldiers and civilians. What do not work as well are the inaccuracy of the uniforms, the occasional digressions into comedy and romance, and the tendency of characters to teleport themselves across the country. I realize the whole idea of the movie is to show the war through the eyes of one man, but it gets ridiculous after a time when you see John Geyser popping up everywhere from Vicksburg to Bull Run.The cast roster is enormous. In addition to the actors listed above, you will see Sterling Hayden, Lloyd Bridges, Colleen Dewhurst, Rip Torn, Rory Calhoun, Warren Oates, and Geraldine Page filling roles both major and minor. Mr. Bentley from &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; even shows up for a minute or two! I think I can safely recommend this film to movie buffs. It's not perfect, not even close, but it would give a viewer a general idea of the issues that led to the war. You can't really hope to adequately inform through the medium of television, but what you can hope to do is get someone interested in reading more about a topic. &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; will do that, with a little luck.",4,Civil War 101,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,5478,"['Once', 'time', 'place', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'was', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'enough',

I am from Arkansas and the entire show was filmed in Arkansas.  I recognize a lot of Arkansas people in the background behind the real actors.  For instance, the University of Arkansas Athletic Director and former Razorback football coach, Frank Broyles, is the doctor who pronounces Lincoln dead near the end.  Also, a Little Rock TV reporter, Chuck Dovish, played the part of the injured soldier that John Geyser's girlfriend helped at Bull Run.  He the one who says ""God bless you, miss.""  My uncle was an extra in the movie too.  He is the tall, skinny soldier who stumbles as he gets up off the ground in the prison scene near the end when the John Geyser tries to get his brother, Luke, out of prison.  Yep, that's my Uncle Milton!  I liked the show, although it was a bit unbelievable at times.  Let's face it, John Geyser couldn't be at Gettysburg and Vicksburg at the same time.  Both happened at the same time in July of 1863.  And, Lincoln didn't give his famous speech until later on in the Fall.  He gave the speech months after Vicksburg had fallen.  And, true, the hairstyles were very early '80's on many of the soldiers.  They didn't spend as much time and money on facial hair as they did on Gettysburg years later.

Cofield,"[12, 15]","When watching this mini-series its best to keep in mind that it was made about twenty years ago and shown on television over several nights.  The over acting and the simplistic dialogue were probably a lot less cloying when spread out over many hours and interrupted by commercials.  This version of the Civil War leaves out most of the grime and blood and introduces a number of anachronisms and phoney sidetracks, among the most bizarre of which are the Stacy Keach character's numerous ""psychic episodes"" and the incident where one of the characters informs some slaves on a Mississippi plantation that they are free by letting them read the Emancipation Proclamation. (Any one care to bet how many slaves knew how to read in 1863?)Having said this, I should also point out that there are some reasonable reenactments of battles, particularly First Bull Run.  You can also get a fairly good idea of the way families were torn apart by the war and the dilemma that conflicted loyalties caused many people.  I guess my favorite character is Malachi Hale, who joins the Union Army sure that he will be a great hero, then has to deal with his terror when he comes under fire.  He eventually makes friends with a similarly frightened Confederate and ends up with a battlefield promotion!

Spotting it in DVD forum, I snatched it up. A good, solid movie/miniseries without a lot of flash, TB&TG; has a fine cast to portray both sides of the Civil War and how two intertwined families cope with their feelings and duties through the war years. Linked by two married sisters, one in VA, the other in PA, TB&TG; shows not all Southerners and Northerners were rabid for war.Stacy Keach, Lloyd Bridges [terrible Southern accent!], Colleen Dewhurst, John Hammond and Gregory Peck [as Lincoln] anchor the cast with a number of cameos by established actors and up-and-comers [Robert Vaughn, Sterling Hayden as John Brown, Paul Winfield, Warren Oates, Rip Torn and Julia Duffy - to name a few].The only jarring note in the script was the ESP factor, supposedly coming from Keach. In the 1860s, I doubt if something like that was as freely discussed and described as ""ESP"". I don't think this particular science was that widely accepted. Most likely, he would have been ""locked up as a loon"" rather than have his dreams being taken seriously.BUT that was the only quirk I found in the entire series - other than some off-note southern accents. We've lived in the South for over 18 years, and I've NEVER HEARD some of the accents that were in this show.

270211,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,6301810678,Paul J. Moade,"[41, 43]","Let me begin with a caveat. This movie is available in two versions. The full-length film (from the tv mini-series) and an abridged version. By all means, get the full length video. It's six hours long, but every scene in  the story is relevent.The film itself chronicles historical events from  a year or two prior to actual hostilities, up to the end of the war and  Lincoln's assassination. The story is related from the viewpoints of two  families (related by marriage): The Geysers from Virginia, and the Hales  from Pennsylvania.Events and happenings in the movie are generally (but  not always) seen via John Geyser's (John Hammond, IV) perspective. John is  the youngest son of a well-to-do, but not wealthy Virginia farmer who is  turned against Southern ideals by the death of a black friend. He seeks  solice and employment with his Uncle Hale's newspaper and moves to  Pennsylvania. However, John is not comfortable in the North either. He  cannot bring himself to join the military because of the possibility of  having to face his elder brothers in combat.The story is a moving one  with several themes running through it. Brother against brother is one of  the stronger themes, but also present are the price of friendship, loyalty  to one's home, family and State, and responsibility. The issue of slavery  is minimized - and probably well so, as that was not a major issue in the  outset of the actual war in any event.The cast is superbly chosen for  their parts, and play them with enthusiasm and credibility. All manner of  charactorizations are present from the young boy who thinks of the war as a  lark and adventure, to those who are committed due to home and family, and  those who believe the war will be short and can't wait to be a part of  history.Especially well done are the parts of Lincoln (Gregory Peck) and  R.E. Lee (Robert Symonds). All charactors are believeable - moving the  audience to tears at times.What's the bottom line?Well, scene for  scene this may not be the most accurate depiction of the Civil War that can  be found, but it certainly captures the flavor. I was disappointed that  Gettyburg was so glossed over (but then there's an entire movie dedicated  to that battle itself under its own title), however everything else seems  to be there. The drama and acting are some of the best you'll find anywhere  -- and the story is compelling.If you've any interest at all in what the  Civil War was about or how it impacted those living during the time, this  is the film to see.

Told primarily through the eyes of a Newspaper Artist, the story deals with all the issues of the war, such as slavery and states' rights, while presenting a good-though-fictional story framed within the four years of the war. While it tends to be melodramatic at times, and there are a few slow passages, the fine storytelling, inspired performances and terrific battle sequences make up for the film's weak points. Overall, this is a fine Civil War drama.Grade: B+Postscript: I am reviewing ""The Complete Miniseries"" 3-Disc Set.

As we see some 80's filming styles and approaches common of television come through.  This 3-DVD set is perfect for those who really don't have a general knowledge of the war.  The story follows historical timelines (most of the time) and also brings up key events to situations like John Brown's Raid, Bull Run, Vicksburg, Gettysburg,etc..  This movie includes common and popular situations that arose during the war such as an army trading coffee or tobacco with the enemy, or punishment procedures for being a coward, popular soldier and civilian life.  It is almost like the movie has taken the most popular things of the Civil War and created a 6 hour movie from it.Sometimes I thought the acting and romance was a bit &quot;sappy&quot; for the movie but I realize that it is nearly 20 years old.  As far as actors I found Gregory Peck acting as Lincoln to be more believable than most of the characters in the story.  This movie isn't a Gettysburg though it isn't a flop.  It is a perfect movie for people learning about the Civil War. Blue and Gray explores the realities of families broken up by war and how people had to ask and find themselves when choosing to fight for the North or South.  It brings a well rounded view of the war and puts it together in a fine movie.

Being a little kid, I wanted to watch it for the cool looking battles, all the guns, swords, horses, and cannons. What I didn't know when I was watching it that it opened my eyes to a whole bunch of things I had never thought about before. For example, soldiers peeing there pants and running away in the thick of battle; innocent people being shot by straying gunfire; people who were so hungery that they would eat horse meat; the non-fighting hero taking up arms to defend his family and home; were all things that had never entered my mind before. The miniseries gave me a greater appreciation of the Civil War and a beginning understanding about the grimness of war in general.Now, with that said I must admit that some of the acting is kind of lame and a lot of the dialogue is cheesy. However, keep in mind that this was a television miniseries made in the early 1980s. Computer special effects were non-existant and the film had to appeal to a huge audience of people over three different days. The whole prophetic gift of Major Steele is a bit farfetching, but other than that everything flows together fairly well. There are some fine acting performances and the battles aren't too shabby.

Of course, I loved the miltary scenes- which were done well. The historical sequences were not always accurate- but that was okay too. The series was loaded with stars- many of whom are now passed away. Gregory Peck was great as Lincoln. However, I have to say that I thought some of the acting of others seemed sub par.
