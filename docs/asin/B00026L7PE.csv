825130,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B00026L7PE,Brett D. Cullum,"[11, 11]","This is Cher's PURPLE RAIN - sort of a semibiography that lets Cher play herself struggling through some hard times.  She plays the lead character who runs the whole movie from one situation to the next until we finally get to see what she is running from in a pretty effective final breakdown sequence.  It was a flop on its release, and it's still pretty much a midnight worthy cult film without too much you could call great cinema.  But it is a peak at pre-plastic surgery Cher, and surprisingly you get the idea that yes there is a star in there.I was disappointed that all you get is a widescreen transfer of the film and a trailer.  Mono soundtrack too.  But the curious will be vindicated, and yes this is at least the R-rated version since there are a couple of fleeting scenes of Cher in the buff.  But no sex scenes to be found.CHASTITY will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is an interesting film.  Not as bad as some would lead you to believe.  It's about a troubled girl who runs away, and just keeps going.  The music is very strong.  There are some really funny lines as well.  And it's a total trip!

825133,AQXTK3B1SUZVN,B00026L7PE,P. Ambrose,"[13, 14]","This is an amazing piece of work solely for the opening piece which goes on and on and is a fascinating psychadelic shoot of a 22-year old Cher running on the beach.....there is still a bit of who she ""was"" before she became ""Cher"" - and it is touching and jarring.  The quick dish on this film as most fans know is that it was Sonny's attempt (he wrote, produced and directed and scored - quite beautifully) to make Cher an actress.  This is also where their daughter got her name - not a great legacy but the film has it's merits.  The film flopped they lost the $ they invested and...thank god...because they were forced to go on the nightclub circuit and become the 70's ""Sonny & Cher"".  Disturbing, however, to myself and those who have seen my copy - is how crass and shallow the character Cher plays reveals herself to be, scene after scene.  Cher has said in many interviews how she developed ""SBT"" - smart mouthed bitch - to protect her as she grew up.  This film takes that to a high.  For Cher fans - this is next to Moonstruck as a purchase - because you can see her vulnerability and her ""Cherness"" at such an early strage - in some scenes it is staggering.  The film never really goes anywhere which in some points is the idea Sonny was trying to convey; however it is in an odd way - eye candy - like a sour ball you can't stop sucking on.  The soundtrack = seriously folks - is brilliant.  Rhino Records released Sonny's unlistenable solo LP - THIS soundtrack should be released.  The single ""Chastity's Song (Band Of Thieves)"" didn't chart - but it is magnificent - as is Cher's vocal treatment.  There are 2 versions of this film - one that has Cher indulging in a lesbian one nighter and the ""G"" that cuts that out - oh they also cut out when she smokes a joint.  I hope this is the uncut version.  This is very amazing and for this price anyone who loves Cher for an iota should check this out.  Besides anything - it is a hoot!

825135,A1AHYCO2YWXXG5,B00026L7PE,"Privacy, Please","[0, 0]","I have seen this film a few times and agree it's not exactly Oscar-quality material, but that has nothing to do with the performances by Cher and the other actors (who do a pretty good job with mediocre lines).  Nor is this movie a series of hippie cliches like so many of the other rebellious-flower-child films of its time.  The main problem with this film is that we are accustomed to liking Cher when she appears on TV, on stage, and in movie roles, the more so in view of all of her stage and screen work that eventually followed this movie.  However, the runaway girl ""Chastity"" is a distinctly un-likable, un-nice piece of work who ends up insulting or harming everyone who shows her the least bit of niceness.  From the initial scenes you get the impression that the character has suffered some kind of past bad experience that left her distrustful and unable to connect with people, but this isn't explained until the very end of the picture and then the question is just left hanging.  The viewer isn't sure whether Chastity's repeated hostility towards people who seem to be genuinely kind or at least, pretty benign (like the young nerdy and probably virginal guy who is clearly uncomfortable on his first visit to a bordello) is because she sees some kind of dark manipulative motive under their niceness, or only because of her own demons.  Also, while Cher does a decent job of acting, she looks too tall and mature in this movie to carry off the idea of a naive, childlike teen.  Linda Blair would have done this type of movie so much better a few years later, simply because of her younger look.It's a shame that this movie only ran 83 minutes as it does seem to be, in parts, a sensitive portrayal of a runaway fleeing a bad homelife, and probably was true to the life of many young people who bum around the country finding themselves.  Which also raises the question - where are all the other street kids and runaways?  Cher seems to exist in a vacuum in that regard.  I wish it had run an extra half hour and some of the characters, such as the law student Eddie and the bordello owner, had been more fully explored.  I would guess that budget constraints may have put the kibosh on doing more with the movie but I can see where it was trying to go and it's by no means as horrible a trip as some would have you believe.

Chastity soon meets-up with a trucker who tries to seduce her, when she stays with him in his hotel room. Having none of that, Chastity leaves the hotel in a huff.Basically, Chastity roams aimlessly about, hitch-hiking for a while. She steals a car, and drives down to Mexico, where she lives in a brothel as a prostitute. She comes back to the states, when she gets bored. When Chastity finally connects with a decent guy who lets her share his apartment, she inexplicably has a nervous breakdown.Cher plays Chastity with a dour, wisecracking detachment. The character seems hollow, and two dimensional. Cher is much more talented as a singer, than an actress.

Yes, it's pre-nose-job Cher in her absolutely wretched dramatic debut, as a sullen and surly hitchhiking runaway with a heart of pressed tin. With her grating voice and punk-ass demeanor, she can often be misconstrued as acting, but do not be fooled - she is simply a marionette in the hands of producer Sonny ""Svengali"" Bono (whom one can also presume was also the never-heard-of-before and never-heard-from-again director de Paola). Chastity is a disturbed young woman who hits the road to escape her dreary, unhappy life, and finds more dreariness and unhappiness. In this turgid and lugubrious script, she takes her anger out on men by picking them up, leading them on and then ""not letting them get anything."" She works as a prostitute without ever having to give up ""the goods,"" and winds up in a Mexican whorehouse for a lesbian madam who would like Chastity to be something more than an employee. With a creepy introspective/philosophical voiceover narrative by Cher, it is hippie-age BS and you can definitely see her *Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves* period looming on the horizon. Chastity is perplexing in a way that is peculiarly unintriguing, and despite all her woes, she is supremely unsympathetic.  Her eventual confession of being abused as a child may have been shocking in 1969, but in retrospect, it is entirely predictable. There are some who will dig deeply to find some merit to this film, but it should strictly be taken as what it is: pure camp - meaning, of course, that's it's hysterically funny while it tries desperately to be serious.
