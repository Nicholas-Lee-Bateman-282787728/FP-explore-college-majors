1514171,A1GDVEPEQ9APM,B006B9XBL4,CNS,"[1, 2]","I gotta give this movie credit for its title.  It's a perfectly accurate representation of this movie:  A bland generic military romp with nothing to make it stand out.  It's just special forces.  That's it.  A simple flick about a mission to go save some reporter who is kidnapped by some bad guy and his army of generic bullet catchers.Along the way, the team runs into things that are beyond the scope of their mission, but of course they do the right thing and get involved anyway.  Pretty expected fare, but touching all the same.  Beyond that, the acting is pretty good, and the equipment is impressive too.  They certainly are decked out like a special forces squad, with a massive array of rifles, pistols, and machine guns, all of which are heavily utilized.But what really drags this down is the absurdly unrealistic battle scenes.  Our intrepid special forces members routinely fight out in the open.  They often just stand around in plain sight and blast away hoards of mindless enemies who somehow can't bring themselves to hit these large and easy targets.  I remember one battle involved absolutely no cover whatsoever.  Just this six-man special forces squad standing in open ground in shooting it out with about 50 bad guys and coming out completely unscathed.  The team also seems to fire thousands of rounds from their primary weapons, but hardly ever has to reload (though to their credit it does often show them transitioning to their pistols).Their rescued reporter also has a pretty dismal role.  She does pretty much nothing of value in the whole operation despite many chances.  Twice she's handed a pistol from one of the soldiers, and does nothing with it either time.  Talk about a letdown.  When I see someone handing her a pistol, I naturally assume it's going to be her time to shine, or that she'll at least attempt to make herself useful, but nope, no point to these scenes at all.All in all this is pretty much a standard mindless action movie with superhuman heroes vs a mindless hoard of drone enemies who serve no purpose beyond dying en mass.

1514172,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B006B9XBL4,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","I find myself not as interested in war movies these days. This is possibly because of the world we live in, there's so much war on TV that I don't particularly want to be entertained by it. Sometimes they can be pulled off effectively though, and realistically which is both impressive and scary at the same time. Films like Act of Valor and The Hurt Locker of late are examples of films so well done, so believable, that it's almost hard to enjoy. Special Forces could be one such example. Starring Diane Kruger, the film follows a group of special forces operatives in Afghanistan rescuing a journalist. The modern warfare action and real-life scenarios that we see all too much of on the news is plentiful. The drama between the characters makes us care more about what's going on rather than just taking in all of the action. The film was expertly put together as well. For a movie of its kind, it nails most attributes. However, one area that didn't pull me in was the story. The hostage-rescue scenario is quite common for these types of movies, and I didn't see a whole lot here that made it stand out. Had there been a little something unique, this film would easily stand amongst some of the best modern warfare style movies, as just about everything else was nicely executed.Source: criticnic.com 3 April 2013Disclosure: Film sent by eOne Films",3,"Well done, but nothing special",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1354,"['find', 'not', 'interested', 'war', 'movies', 'days', 'possibly', 'world', 'live', 'so', 'much', 'war', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'effectively', 'realistically', 'impressive', 'scary', 'same', 'time', 'Films', 'Act', 'Valor', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'late', 'are', 'examples', 'films', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'believable', 'almost', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'Special', 'Forces', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'Starring', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'film', 'group', 'special', 'forces', 'operatives', 'Afghanistan', 'rescuing', 'journalist', 'modern', 'warfare', 'action', 'real-life', 'scenarios', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'news', 'plentiful', 'drama', 'characters', 'care', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'rather', 'just', 'taking', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'expertly', 'put', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'kind', 'most', 'attributes', 'However', 'one', 'area', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'was', 'story', 'hostage-rescue', 'scenario', 'quite', 'common', 'types', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Had', 'been', 'little', 'something', 'unique', 'film', 'would', 'easily', 'stand', 'amongst', 'best', 'modern', 'warfare', 'style', 'movies', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'nicely', 'executed.Source', 'criticnic.com', '3', 'April', '2013Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'eOne', 'Films']",Special Forces
1514173,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B006B9XBL4,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","An article is written by a French journalist named Elsa (Diane Kruger) with the intention of exposing the Pakistani warlord named Zaief (Raz Degan) for what he really is. Seeking retribution for being called ""the butcher of Kabul,"" Zaief captures Elsa and her friend Amen (Mehdi Nebbou) and holds them both hostage. A French Special Forces team lead by Kovax (Djimon Hounsou) is sent in to rescue them, but when a stray bullet severs their only means of communication they find themselves journeying back to Afghanistan on foot.The French war adventure film opens with what is quite possibly the most ridiculous music to try and accompany soldiers or a war. There are helicopters flying in the air, soldiers scouting out the landscape, and this extremely serious tone but it doesn't feel sincere because Big Audio Dynamite is blaring in the background. It just doesn't seem to fit the tone of the film at all. In the meantime, the rest of the score is completely generic. There's this guitar heavy piece that's used literally every five minutes or so. If the inadequate music wasn't enough, the film is edited like a bad music video with constant quick cuts, flashes of light, and even slow motion.The first half of the film is nearly unbearable; there's no character development and these really lame attempts at humor. ""We need to be set up at the landing site in an hour and a half."" ""Oh, no time to go shopping then?"" It seems like ""Special Forces"" is just going through the motions at first. It's a rescue mission with no depth, but things begin to turn around once they reach the village. The action picks up and suddenly everyone realizes that, ""Oh crap, we should actually be trying to invest in people's emotions here!""Diane Kruger has the most draining performance. Elsa is put through hell and you can see the toll it takes on her both physically and emotionally. What's unfortunate about her is that she's so stubborn that it completely voids out rational thinking the majority of the time. She is given at least half a dozen signs and told just as often to leave the country, but decides to stay to try and protect her informer Maina (Morjana Alaoui) even though she never sees her after the opening scene. She's also given a gun by Lucas (Denis Menochet) and is told something along the lines of ""just in case"" and ""you'll never know."" Even when things go south, she's never seen using it. Instead she's given another gun later, which she also doesn't use. So Elsa can be a successful journalist and gain worldwide attention, but can't use basic logic even though her life in addition to eight others depends on it.Djimon Hounsou has a really passionate performance, as well. He's so devoted to his mission and his men. Benoit Magimel as Tic-Tac is able to add some awkward charm. Raphael Personnaz is the biggest bad ass. The sniper exchange at the village is just insane. Raz Degan is fairly impressive as Zaief. While the character is pretty flat, it does seem like he does the best he can with what's in front of him. His cold eyes accompanied by his loathsome actions cause him to stand out in a sea of mediocrity.""Special Forces"" is incredibly similar to ""Act of Valor"" in story and tone. On the positive side, ""Special Forces"" doesn't feel as force fed as ""Act of Valor"" and has better, more emotionally charged performances in its second half. It could have been so much more though, especially if the first half of the film was written better and had more depth. You might actually care about the events that unfold in the process. ""Special Forces"" isn't very special at all.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[10, 11]","Good military thrillers are hard-to-find, and that's probably because the field of cinema has long cultivated lesser soldier pictures masquerading as something bigger or grander than what they truly are.  For example, a reviewer for the Hollywood Reporter draws a light comparison to the Rambo films (""a body count that rivals any of the Rambo films""), and, to be honest, I think that does a disservice to SPECIAL FORCES as well as it does Rambo.  Rambo is clearly a fictional creation; sure, he's entertaining and a crowd-pleaser, but the men who make up true-life Special Forces teams have very little in common with and how Rambo goes about his job.  Rambo is bigger-than-life.  He's over-the-top.  Real soldiers lie low much of the time, and they only rush into combat when either ordered or find it absolutely necessary.It's a fine-line distinction, but it's one that should be made when discussing competent military thrillers like SPECIAL FORCES.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Elsa Casanova (played by the lovely Diane Kruger) is a war correspondent caught behind enemy lines in Afghanistan when she's taken hostage over some very unflattering pieces involving a local Taliban chieftain.  Her captors take her deep into their Pakistan-stronghold, and the French call in a squad of Special Forces led by Kovax (Djimon Hounsou) to rescue her.  A botched helicopter extraction leaves her and the soldiers with only one grim option: to brave this wild frontier on foot, trek across the mountains, and hope for friendly aide in Afghanistan!To its credit, SPECIAL FORCES is a smartly made military thriller.  There's a political undercurrent, as well, that for the most part supports the primary plot of good soldiers doing a dirty job, but the politics of the film put so much of the story in jeopardy.  For example, the Taliban chieftain would appear to be exactly what the Taliban would want from a leader (he's ruthless, forcing Elsa to watch helplessly while they strangle a man to death in front of her), but we quickly learn that the man lacks the respect of the local Taliban elders.  There's an interesting parallel running through the motion picture about how the press apparently doesn't respect the French government or its military, but, in the end, we pretty much find out that it's all been done for the sake of `character development.'  Unfortunately, there's no way to make sense of what director Stephane Rybojad was trying to saw about the world and these people, but I've no doubt Stephane thought it was all pretty high-brow.Those quibbles aside, a large portion of the rest of SPECIAL FORCES is extremely well shot, expertly choreographed, and quite thrilling.  The rescue goes mostly textbook, but the extraction leaves these folks stranded behind enemy lines and needing to salvage a botched operation.  As soldiers would, they comprise their own `game plan,' which leads to some solid action for fans of this genre.  The last quarter (or so) of the film veers into some pretty dire circumstances for all involved, and, while I'd no doubt this is the story Rybojad wanted to tell, it's all pretty downright depressing for my tastes.  Kudos for opting for realism, but, if it's realism you want, then I'd seriously question the logic of the skinny blonde waif with no body fat lasting as long as she did.SPECIAL FORCES is produced by Easy Company, Studio Canal, Canal+, TPS Star, Banque Postale Image 4, A Plus Image 2, and Sofica Manon.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (E One).  For those who might be wondering, this is `technically' listed as a French-language film which is a bit of a misnomer: yes, there's a wealth of French spoken in there, but there's an awful lot of English, as well.  There is an English-dubbing track (2.0 only) available, if you don't want any French; I watched it in French with sub-titles, and I was surprised how much English there was.  As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds magnificent - very clear and crisp images, excellent sound mix, and there's some wonderful John-Ford-esque vistas throughout the film.  As for the special features, there's a handful of deleted scenes (nothing grand) and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it three minutes feature on a real-life Special Forces soldier who participated briefly as a character in the film.  (My press materials indicates that the Blu-ray release includes an additional `making of' featurette.)RECOMMENDED.  Look, I love my patriotism just as much as the next patriot, but SPECIAL FORCES ain't no recruiting video for the French that's for sure.  Also, it ain't any work any miracles for Pakistan's tourism business.  It's a well-made, well-constructed military/political thriller for about 80% of the time, which ain't bad.  However, its politics are all over the map (Are the Taliban bad guys? Are they good guys? Are they just misunderstood? Or is it the press who are our bad guys?), and the lack of a coherent message (not the story, which is all well and good) slows the picture down a bit.  It's full of good performances and some very curious editing (way too many meaningless dissolves), but the script could've used a rescue mission itself in the last 30 minutes.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with a DVD screener copy of SPECIAL FORCES for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Some

It has some interesting moral ideas and aims to be more than the result.  Diane Kruger is perhaps the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on film.  I don't even like blondes but she is a natural wonder.  She also does a good job with her role.The main problem is that the main plot device is just totally unrealistic.  The idea that an elite French special forces unit would not have additional methods of communication (flares, smoke grenades, a laser device, even a mirror to signal) and would have a extraction point rendezvous point 20 plus klicks (kilometers) away from the position where they rescued hostages is preposterous.Another unrealistic aspect of the movie are the gun fights where both groups are standing up firing away when there is available cover.  Also, there are almost no scenes of magazine changes. Plus each SF troop would have had to have an ammo load of 2,000 rounds. One 30 round M-16 magazine weighs about a pound. No one is carrying 70 magazines into combat.  The film did have one realistic thing not seen in most movies and that is the good guys do pick up enemy weapons but they don't collect ammo or magazines.Act of Valor is not a great movie but it is generally realistic.  If this movie were set in the 70's then the communication failures would be realistic, but not the mission planning and the firefights. The movie also borrows a number of themes and clich&eacute;s from every war movie from Gunga Din to For Whom the Bell Tolls to Platoon.The cast, the viewers, and the French military all deserve a better plot and a better movie.

Women should not appear in the streets without a blood relative and without wearing a Burqa. Women must not speak loudly in public as no stranger should hear a woman's voice.

He orders her killed, but with knife to throat, Elsa taunts her captor, saying he&#8217;s not man enough to watch her being killed. He blinks and lets her live.He is chastised by those above him for not killing the woman.In the mean time, French special forces perform a bold reconnassance mission, freeing Elsa and her fellow journalist.Now Zaief is forced to find and kill all to prove himself.Set against the harsh background of Afghanistan this small sleeper film is gripping and dramatic, more so than most of its American counterparts.The film which is based on a true story, shows not only the precise nature of the French Special Forces but also the harsh brutality of Taliban fighters.This is a journey you will not soon forget.",4,Reconnaissance mission gripping and dramatic,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,1475,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MississippiThere', 'are', 'actors', 'will', 'likely', 'recognize', 'Special', 'Forces', 'shouldn', '8217', 'keep', 'watching', 'mesmerizing', 'film.It', 'French', 'film', 'voices', 'English', 'subtitles.A', 'French', 'journalist', 'Elsa', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'working', 'story', 'Maina', 'woman', 'sold', 'man', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Taliban', 'leader', 'Ahmed', 'Zaief.Taliban', 'are', 'nortorius', 'treatment', 'women', 'Women', 'should', 'not', 'appear', 'streets', 'blood', 'relative', 'wearing', 'Burqa', 'Women', 'must', 'not', 'speak', 'loudly', 'public', 'stranger', 'should', 'hear', 'woman', 'voice', 'list', 'on.So', 'when', 'Zaief', 'Elsa', '8217', 'met', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'bow', 'orders', 'killed', 'knife', 'throat', 'Elsa', 'captor', 'saying', '8217', 'not', 'man', 'enough', 'watch', 'being', 'killed', 'live.He', 'chastised', 'not', 'killing', 'woman.In', 'mean', 'time', 'French', 'special', 'forces', 'perform', 'bold', 'reconnassance', 'mission', 'freeing', 'Elsa', 'fellow', 'journalist.Now', 'Zaief', 'forced', 'find', 'kill', 'prove', 'himself.Set', 'harsh', 'background', 'Afghanistan', 'small', 'sleeper', 'film', 'gripping', 'dramatic', 'more', 'so', 'most', 'American', 'counterparts.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'precise', 'nature', 'French', 'Special', 'Forces', 'also', 'harsh', 'brutality', 'Taliban', 'fighters.This', 'journey', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",Special Forces

Interesting to note that many Israeli actors are cast as Arabs, i.e., the Arab bandit in THE MUMMY, and Saddam Hussein in the HBO mini-series was played by an Israeli whose family came to Israel from Iraq.Suffice to say, I was moved, and thrilled by this French made war movie.Last week I saw Act of Valor which also dealt with Special Forces, US...I bought a copy because the action scenes and characters were terrific. But in comparing that film, Black Hawk Down, this French film rise way above them because it makes you FEEL. And when you feel, you share in the experience that the characters on the screen are going through. And that's cinema at its best.My screenplay IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS is like that, and when it gets made with the right cast and director, it will resonate with audiences as well. I just pray it's directed and cast and shot as well as this marvelous film. I also watched EXPANDABLES this week and when I compare the two films, what a piece of garbage that was. I also saw the new Conan, and what trash that was too with all its expensive CGI action. (BTW, in Expendables, the best line is spoken by Schwarzenegger saying about a Smart car: ""My shoe is bigger than this car"". The only amusing line in the film - which does have exciting action).Talking about action, the French Special Forces has a lotta EXCELLENTLY SHOT action, but even as we're in the midst of the danger and violence, we are still connected emotionally with the characters which we cannot say about most US action films.Which is why when I run across great films like this French made Special Forces, Silver Lining Playbook, The Fighter, This Is 40, etc., I sing its praises. Special Forces will not make the mega bucks of some of our US made comic book garbage that passes for cinema...and even well intended bores like the pretentious Lincoln that made me fall asleep with its overwrought bedroom melodramatics and over-intellectualized flowered lingo, but I hope people here discover the film and see itTake my word, you will not be disappointed by this superior feature film of honor, and integrity.

1514192,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006B9XBL4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","As I sat down to watch the French film ""Special Forces,"" I was poised to enjoy a complex story of tactical operations and international politics. And in the opening scenes, that's just what the movie seemed on the precipice of serving up. However, as the primary story line came into focus, it was clear that ""Special Forces"" really wasn't about an elite military squad in anything other than title. We see a couple of missions, but nothing of any real strategy is presented. I would have enjoyed these scenes a lot more if the screenplay had delineated just what made this squad so spectacular from a technical, intelligence, or stealth point of view. But as I said, this action endeavor isn't really about a special forces team per se. It is rescue picture. If you remember the tag line for Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it stated that ""the mission was a man."" Here, the only objective is the rescue of a woman who happens to be a French war correspondent. In other words, the mission was a woman.The terrific Diane Kruger (generally underrated) seems a bit out of place as the central character. A seasoned news vet, she attracts the attention of local Taliban leaders in Afghanistan as she pursues a very personal story. Soon, she is abducted by the subject of her story (Raz Degan) and put in harm's way. This rallies the French government (we're not given too much detail behind her import) to enact a daring rescue attempt at any cost. That's when our group of heroes (led by Djimon Hounsou) arrive on scene and get her out within a couple of minutes. No big deal. The rest of the movie plays as an extended chase through the desolate country as the squad and Kruger try to evade capture and death. Along the way, we'll learn a bit about all of them, but the harrowing journey will surely promise a death toll. Who will make it out alive, if anyone? That is the central question as Degan's men are relentless.Much of ""Special Forces"" works better on a visceral level than on an intellectual one. The film's screenplay makes some dubious choices to enhance your emotional commitment to the material. The Taliban are faceless enemies represented solely by Degan. It seems surprising how personally invested in the pursuit he is, but the filmmaker is convinced the audience needs a big final confrontation with the symbolic face of evil. The men form a grudging respect for Kruger as well, but she never plays an active role in her own survival. As people are being brutally annihilated, they think she's a trooper for walking on battered feet. She never takes up a weapon and ends up being carried. She never comes across as heroic to me. And let's not get started on an ill-advised romantic connection. ""Special Forces"" was designed to be an epic and devastating war story. And some of it works, it's hard not to be swept up into the nightmare. The cast is strong but, in the end, too many false moments hamper a story that should have been absolutely unforgettable. Not a bad movie, but had so much more potential. About 3 1/2 stars.

She did not have any assets other than her good looks and that was not enough to prevent her and her companion from being taken hostage and their driver being killed.  Her captors took her to their Pakistan stronghold where they give her the third degree and want her to read a statement.  The French send in a squad of Special Forces to rescue her.

The film has all the ingredients of a great action film but one: a script.In ""Special Forces"" Diane Kruger plays a French journalist Elsa, who is kidnapped with her friend Amen (Mehdi Nebbou) by a Taliban leader Ahmed Zaief (Raz Degan) in Afghanistan. To rescue Elisa and Amen, now imprisoned in a fortress in Pakistan, the French government sends out a team of six Special Forces soldiers led by Sgt. Kovax (Djimon Hounsou).What follows is a standard war action film with fierce combat sequences and heroism. The film's story moves along fast, keeping you interested with decent action set-pieces and impressive aerial shots, but about halfway through the film, where the rescue team encounters an obstacle or two, ""Special Forces"" suddenly gets slower. The French soldiers and freed prisoners have to fight not only the Taliban soldiers chasing them, but the harsh nature of the Afghanistan / Pakistan border.Some characters are stock types, but the cast has turned in solid performances. The beautiful on-location shots (filmed in Tajikistan and Djibouti) are authentic, lending credibility to the all-too-familiar storyline. Acting and locations aside, however, the film clearly needs improvement, especially its storytelling that tends to be sluggish in the second half of the film. Also, if I am wrong, please correct me, but some part of the story (an elite military team without a backup plan, for instance) seems hardly credible.All in all ""Special Forces"" is a respectable effort, but does not break any new ground.",3,(3.5 STARS) Decent If Not Very Special French War Action,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,1836,"['immediate', 'subject', 'matter', 'stunning', 'locations', 'solid', 'acting', 'attractive', 'cast', 'including', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Benot', 'Magimel', 'cameo', 'Tch', 'eacute', 'Karyo', '2011', 'French', 'movie', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Forces', 'sp', 'eacute', 'ciales', 'potential', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'almost', 'film', 'ingredients', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'one', 'script.In', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'French', 'journalist', 'Elsa', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'friend', 'Amen', 'Mehdi', 'Nebbou', 'Taliban', 'leader', 'Ahmed', 'Zaief', 'Raz', 'Degan', 'Afghanistan', 'rescue', 'Elisa', 'Amen', 'now', 'imprisoned', 'fortress', 'Pakistan', 'French', 'government', 'out', 'team', 'six', 'Special', 'Forces', 'soldiers', 'led', 'Sgt', 'Kovax', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', '.What', 'standard', 'war', 'action', 'film', 'fierce', 'combat', 'sequences', 'heroism', 'film', 'story', 'moves', 'fast', 'keeping', 'interested', 'decent', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'impressive', 'aerial', 'shots', 'halfway', 'film', 'where', 'rescue', 'team', 'obstacle', 'two', 'Special', 'Forces', 'suddenly', 'slower', 'French', 'soldiers', 'freed', 'prisoners', 'have', 'fight', 'not', 'only', 'Taliban', 'soldiers', 'chasing', 'harsh', 'nature', 'Afghanistan', '/', 'Pakistan', 'border.Some', 'characters', 'are', 'stock', 'types', 'cast', 'turned', 'solid', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'on-location', 'shots', 'filmed', 'Tajikistan', 'Djibouti', 'are', 'authentic', 'lending', 'credibility', 'all-too-familiar', 'storyline', 'Acting', 'locations', 'aside', 'however', 'film', 'clearly', 'improvement', 'especially', 'storytelling', 'be', 'sluggish', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Also', 'am', 'wrong', 'please', 'correct', 'part', 'story', 'elite', 'military', 'team', 'backup', 'plan', 'instance', 'hardly', 'credible.All', 'Special', 'Forces', 'respectable', 'effort', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground']",Special Forces

This was made possible because of the assistance provided by the French armed forces with equipment and expertise. French journalist Elsa (Kruger) and her local colleague Amen (Nebbou) are following a story in Afghanistan when they are abducted by Taliban leader Ahmed Za (Degan) and taken to his hidden fortress in Pakistan. Faced with Elsa's imminent execution, a French special forces unit is dispatched to free her.Commander Kovax (Hounsou) and his team of SF soldiers are completing the final part of their mission when they react against the cruelty of the Taliban against local villagers who had aided the French soldiers. The team then miss their RV and play a cat-and-mouse game with their pursuers through a harsh mountainous region to complete their mission and avoid death at the hands of either man or the elements.
