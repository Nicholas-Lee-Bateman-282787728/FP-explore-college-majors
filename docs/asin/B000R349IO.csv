The oldest daughter, Iris takes over the role of the sisters' late mother, cleaning while cooking for both the family and a local bakery; May works as a maid for a rich household, but dreams of being a movie star; while Ruby spends her days selling corsets.Lilies doesn't let viewers down in its entertainment value: The script is packed with secrets, family and class conflict, forbidden love, attempted suicide, hidden desires, and much more, all taking place at a time when society was beginning to move into a new mode that was both more free and liberal. Not to mention the acting is first-rate and the characters and storylines are extremely well-developed.Don't waste a moment before you go out and get this series.

1078638,A3Q7ZXHEZBE4IJ,B000R349IO,"Judith Johnson ""JJ""","[7, 7]","Rented this 8-part mini-series and promptly became addicted to it. The film examines a neglected era, the aftershocks of WWI in England and the PTSS that abounded.  As it centers around a working class middle-aged Britisher widower and his 4 young adult children, it offers a compelling story with wonderful actors including Stephen Moyer (True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)), top-notch set design and interesting character arcs.  However, if one of the characters falls in love you can be sure it is not going anywhere as none of them are going to leave their dysfunctional family.There is a plot twist in the second episode that I didn't see coming and found rather disturbing but it probably could happen.  There are several very graphic scenes involving childbirth, miscarriage, suicide and the like.  Severely wounded veterans feature prominently in a couple of episodes and that is pretty graphic as well.  Beware the father's violent temper and after a while you start to be afraid for any domesticated animals that might be around while he is in full temper and has a meat cleaver handy.My biggest complaint is none of the loose ends are really tied up at the end, so it has a television feel to it rather than the plot resolutions that have been set-up.  Also, unless you are a native speaker of the King's English, parts of dialogue need subtitles and they are not available.  This is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

The costuming is a little off as skirts were longer than knee length inches early 20's, not rising until about 1926.  Dada was a good actor, playing the helpless bully with charm.  The two stars are for visual interest, the high concept and, well, that's it.The plot is ham fisted and if you can't guess what's going to happen then you must have been out getting a cup of tea because none of the twists are surprises.The girls aren't especially good actors, although they are watchable, so long as you are expecting a soap opera and not a drama. The accents are unintelligible in places and there are no subtitles.The thing that got to me, which was done in the name of realism, was the violence towards animals. We see a cat killed, a dog die, a rooster killed with a broom when Dada is in a temper and a total of four rabbits killed, three out of pique, in the first two episodes. Just because something is real isn't a reason to enjoy watching it. It made me feel sick and there are times when the music clearly indicates that it is supposed to be funny.I'm not even going to go into the violence at the end or the emotional incest carried on throughout the series.I expected this to be a nicer story, something I could watch when I'm feeling low but I would never watch it again.  The picture of three girls in their skivvies (never explained) on the cover should have been a clue that this series seeks only to titilate and shock, not to pleasantly entertain.I have to get the bad taste out of my mouth now.

Secrets, lies, corruption, adultery, sickness, unwanted pregnancies, hidden scars- figuratively and literally, anger, sex, suicide, lots of conniving tomfoolery and a bit of humor thrown in so we can breath until the next storm.The Moss family lives, strives, smolders and explodes in a day by day type fashion.  It highly entertaining, even addicting.  Some would say it's reality for the times.  Perhaps.  But not to this concentrated, over the top, fashion.  It's basically an extremely, well-made, English soap opera.The acting is 5 star.  Dadda is my favorite character, likable and despicable, ever volatile.  He looks a little like Charles Chaplin.  A widower, he needs to stay that way.  The three Lilies: May the maid with no sense, Ruby the feminist, maybe communist, maybe New Ager, always opinionated, and Iris the pseudo-mother Madonna, all struggle with their identities and men and each other.  Billy the only boy struggles, too, with sexual identity and household position.  Except for one episode, he is way under utilized.The sets show the dark and dismal contrast of Moss's Liverpool vs. the opulence where May gets to work and probably wished she hadn't, or where Ruby's 'friends' hang out in their political and judgmental enlightmentThe supporting cast also shines. The priest carries the torch and morals for all and languishes in his own imperfection stating ""that God (must be) imperfect since he made man in His own image.""  I quess he skipped Genesis and the Fall.  Back to catechism with you.  The policeman is sympathetic, but somewhat insipid, and the neighbors always worry about the latest gossip, epidemic, Tallyman or the Moss's bathroom.The family that stays together doesn't necessarily pray together- not if you're the Moss's.  More like rages together.  And will somebody put away the dishes before Dadda gets home.  There's no comfortable, gushy romance; nothing's comfortable; there's always something stalking around the corner ready to rip the relative calm asunder. It wears me out.

Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[88, 89]","...so addicted was I to the next turn of the plot!""Lilies"" follows the lives of the Moss family, led by Nelson ""Dadda"", comprised of son William (Billy) and daughters Iris, May, and Ruby.  Mrs. Mary Moss has been dead approximately 15 years and Iris, the eldest, has become the lady of the house.  Dadda works as an amateur veterinarian and herbalist.  Iris creates confections and sells them to a local sweets store.  May is in service to the nouveau-riche Mr. and Mrs. Brazendale.  Ruby, William's twin and the youngest, just starts into peddling women's corsets at the beginning of the series.The Mosses live in the early 1920s in Liverpool, and their lives are mirros of the times.  The influx of jazz music and the popularity of the silent films persist throughout; the beginnings of social change through contraception and women's suffrage figure into it as well.Religious differences and class distinction also play large roles.  Dadda, an Ulsterman, is vigorously Protestant, and his sons were raised in his church--elder son Walter having perished in action in World War I.The Moss daughters were raised in their mother's Roman Catholic faith (although their names would hardly have been given Baptismal approval for the era of their birth -- the 1890s -- by any Catholic priest, as none of them are saints names).  On more than one occasion the division of churches causes issues within the family.  Young Rev. Malachi Melia, the pastor of the girls' parish, plays a large role in many episodes.The daughters are the central figures in this series, given its title from a toast made by Dadda that, while the bulbs he'd planted in the little garden on Portugal Street as a newly-married (and very young) man never prospered, he'd been blessed by ""my girls, who are my lilies"".Iris is common-sensical but harbors a yearning for her own marriage and motherhood.  The unlikely-named Domingo appears the perfect match--until a secret dismantles Iris' hopes and dreams.  May, who initially seems as sensible as her elder sister, ends up in the midst of high drama with her employer, becoming pregnant by him.  Ruby, the feistiest of the trio, becomes entranced by the social movements of women's liberation and embraces vegetarianism, even as her own dreams of swimming for the British Olympic team are dashed early on in the storyline.Billy is a sad soul, having witnessed Naval action at the Battle of Jutland, only to be sent home, a victim of post-traumatic stress.  Dadda is a man desperate to keep his family together, although his own violent temperment makes for some of the clan's worst problems.  Toward the end of the series Dadda attempts to introduce his new romantic interest, Myrtle Bird, to his offspring, but she is soundly rejected--this was the only time I found Dadda sympathetic, as Miss Bird was more than appropriate for him and very clearly a good match for him.""Lilies"" truly offers it all--suicidal thoughts, adultery, bad marriages, sexual identity, class struggle, religious tension--except for a juicy murder, it covers a vast panorama of human conditions, struggles, tragedies, and, ultimately, victories.",5,I watched it all in one day...,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3139,"['so', 'addicted', 'was', 'next', 'turn', 'plot', 'Lilies', 'lives', 'Moss', 'family', 'led', 'Nelson', 'Dadda', 'comprised', 'son', 'William', 'Billy', 'daughters', 'Iris', 'May', 'Ruby', 'Mrs.', 'Mary', 'Moss', 'been', 'dead', 'approximately', '15', 'years', 'Iris', 'eldest', 'become', 'lady', 'house', 'Dadda', 'amateur', 'veterinarian', 'herbalist', 'Iris', 'confections', 'local', 'sweets', 'store', 'May', 'service', 'nouveau-riche', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Brazendale', 'Ruby', 'William', 'twin', 'youngest', 'just', 'peddling', 'women', 'corsets', 'beginning', 'series.The', 'Mosses', 'live', 'early', '1920s', 'Liverpool', 'lives', 'are', 'mirros', 'times', 'influx', 'jazz', 'music', 'popularity', 'silent', 'films', 'persist', 'beginnings', 'social', 'change', 'contraception', 'women', 'suffrage', 'figure', 'well.Religious', 'differences', 'class', 'distinction', 'also', 'play', 'large', 'roles', 'Dadda', 'Ulsterman', 'vigorously', 'Protestant', 'sons', 'were', 'raised', 'church', 'elder', 'son', 'Walter', 'having', 'perished', 'action', 'World', 'War', 'I.The', 'Moss', 'daughters', 'were', 'raised', 'mother', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'names', 'would', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Baptismal', 'approval', 'era', 'birth', '1890s', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'none', 'are', 'saints', 'names', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'division', 'churches', 'causes', 'issues', 'family', 'Young', 'Rev', 'Malachi', 'Melia', 'pastor', 'girls', 'parish', 'large', 'role', 'many', 'episodes.The', 'daughters', 'are', 'central', 'figures', 'series', 'given', 'title', 'toast', 'made', 'Dadda', 'bulbs', ""'d"", 'planted', 'little', 'garden', 'Portugal', 'Street', 'newly-married', 'very', 'young', 'man', 'never', 'prospered', ""'d"", 'been', 'blessed', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'lilies', '.Iris', 'common-sensical', 'yearning', 'own', 'marriage', 'motherhood', 'unlikely-named', 'Domingo', 'perfect', 'match', 'secret', 'dismantles', 'Iris', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'May', 'who', 'initially', 'as', 'sensible', 'elder', 'sister', 'up', 'midst', 'high', 'drama', 'employer', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'Ruby', 'feistiest', 'trio', 'becomes', 'entranced', 'social', 'movements', 'women', 'liberation', 'vegetarianism', 'even', 'own', 'dreams', 'swimming', 'British', 'Olympic', 'team', 'are', 'dashed', 'early', 'storyline.Billy', 'sad', 'soul', 'having', 'witnessed', 'Naval', 'action', 'Battle', 'Jutland', 'only', 'be', 'sent', 'home', 'victim', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'Dadda', 'man', 'desperate', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'own', 'violent', 'temperment', 'clan', 'worst', 'problems', 'Toward', 'end', 'series', 'Dadda', 'introduce', 'new', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Myrtle', 'Bird', 'offspring', 'soundly', 'rejected', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'found', 'Dadda', 'sympathetic', 'Miss', 'Bird', 'was', 'more', 'appropriate', 'very', 'clearly', 'good', 'match', 'Lilies', 'truly', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'adultery', 'bad', 'marriages', 'sexual', 'identity', 'class', 'struggle', 'religious', 'tension', 'juicy', 'murder', 'vast', 'panorama', 'human', 'conditions', 'struggles', 'tragedies', 'ultimately', 'victories']",LILIES

The family is comprised of one very volatile father, a rather subdued elder sister who is the main care-giver, a ""wild-sided"" middle sister, a bright emotional younger sister and a disturbed eldest brother just back from the war.  The storyline?  Basically, they get into all kinds of trouble, from the mundane sort to life's most difficult challenges in a tone that maintains a personal, ""non-overbearing"" quality throughout.What I like best about the series is it's periods of humor.  So many books and films about post WWII or the advance of industrialization in Europe are utterly bleak and focus on the horror of life to the exclusion of all else.  Characters are wonderful, realistic and well-developed.This miniseries makes you cry from time to time, laugh out loud and rejoice at least once in every episode.  And by that, I mean not the high-art sort of emotions so often portrayed in these things, but the day-to-day, real-life kind that keeps us all going.  It really touches you on that level.  As for history/period elements, they are presented as background - not a cultural, social or religious ""statement"" movie.  I found the treatment of the period made it easier digest and didn't distract from the storyline.So, basically I'd recommend this film to anyone who has sisters, brothers or crazy relations - anyone who has ever tried to have a deep thought and wondered why it went so horribly wrong when they tried to act on it - or just plain cared about and supported someone in spite of the cost.  Each episode will make you want to watch the next.

1078653,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000R349IO,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Lilies is a stellar period drama- the story centers around a lower income family in post WW I England. There is Dadda, the patriarch of the Moss clan, who is a widower [his wife Mary having died 15 yrs earlier], his oldest daughter Iris, second daughter May, and twins Billy and Ruby. There was another son Walter who had died during the war. Together, the Moss family live through one crisis after another.The center of the series is the lives of the three sisters - Iris is the oldest daughter who is selfless in her devotion to her family. She is the substitute mother for the Moss family, and apart from making sure the house is taken care of and meals cooked, she also works for the local bakery, making chocolates and other confectionery. But Iris secretly yearns to be a wife and mother, and have a family of her own, something that comes within her reach when she is courted by the conjurer Domingo, who appears to be the perfect suitor, but who harbors a secret that shatters Iris' dreams of domestic bliss. Iris also forms a close friendship with the parish priest who acts as confidante and friend to the Moss family, particularly Iris.The second daughter May works as a maid for the rich Brazendales. Mrs. Brazendale yearns to be a mother, but suffers one miscarriage after another. Mr. Brazendale appears to be a charming gentleman, and May, who harbors dreams of making it into the pictures finds herself drawn to him, resulting in an affair that brings initial happiness, only to result in May's shattered dreams, and tarnished reputation when she finds herself in the family way.The third daughter Ruby is feisty and fiercely opinionated. Ruby's dreams of becoming an Olympic swimmer are shattered when she suffers an injury and she then becomes a corset saleswoman. Along the way, Ruby becomes fascinated and drawn to an upper class woman whose ideas of modernization, vegetarianism, and notions on sex enthrall Ruby.Ruby's twin brother Billy finds himself having a phobia of water after narrowly escaping death in the Battle of Jutland during the war. He also suffers from survivor's guilt and battles his confusion about his sexual identity.The father Dadda Nelson is an intriguing character and played to perfection by the actor portraying him. He is at once a proud and loving dad, but can also become abusive and unyielding when his authority is challenged. Fiercely protective of his position as patriarch of the family, he detests any flaws in his children, failing to recognize the flaws in his own character.This mini-series is truly engrossing. Each episode has a well-woven plot than transports you into the lives of the Moss family and their travails, and the attention to period details [the setting is post WW I] is authentic and wonderful. The score is beautiful as is the cinematography. The cast is simply excellent, there wasn't a performance I disliked, both main and fringe characters.I have been a long-time fan of period dramas, and I have to say that Lilies truly is a gem that needs more exposure. I was very disappointed to find that there wasn't a Series 2 and hope they will come up with one soon for there are lots more stories to be told about the Moss family.
