829665,A3H6P6JIOKELT6,B0002B167S,Jennifer Wardrip,"[0, 0]","My daughter discovered Bratz about a year ago, and I immediately tried to discourage her interest. Barbies are one thing, but Bratz are simply hoochie-mamas designed to influence little girls into wearing clothes that are simply innapropriate. That being said though, I totally get the appeal for the younger girls. Fashion, a little romance--it's all very tres chic. Doesn't mean I have to like it, though.She loved it, of course, when they came out with Bratz Babyz, so we had to watch the movie. On its own merits, the movie is pretty cute. The girls lose their dog at the mall, where they're pursued by an older bully, a security guard, and the baby-care center director. Except for the plot, though, this movie loses serious points with me. The Bratz Babyz go around in belly button-baring shirts and diapers! That's it! Where the heck are their clothes? Teen hoochie-mamas are one thing; baby hoochie-mamas are just plain scary.Overall, sure, the movie is a cute one for the little girls to watch once. After that, besides just getting on your nerves, this one can go back to the video rental store.",3,"I See the Appeal, But I Sure Don't Like It",1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1105,"['daughter', 'discovered', 'Bratz', 'year', 'ago', 'immediately', 'tried', 'discourage', 'interest', 'Barbies', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'Bratz', 'are', 'simply', 'hoochie-mamas', 'designed', 'influence', 'little', 'girls', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'are', 'simply', 'innapropriate', 'being', 'said', 'totally', 'get', 'appeal', 'younger', 'girls', 'Fashion', 'little', 'romance', 'very', 'chic', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'like', 'loved', 'course', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Bratz', 'Babyz', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'movie', 'pretty', 'cute', 'girls', 'lose', 'dog', 'mall', 'where', ""'re"", 'pursued', 'older', 'bully', 'security', 'guard', 'baby-care', 'center', 'director', 'plot', 'though', 'movie', 'serious', 'points', 'Bratz', 'Babyz', 'go', 'around', 'belly', 'button-baring', 'shirts', 'diapers', 'Where', 'heck', 'are', 'clothes', 'Teen', 'hoochie-mamas', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'hoochie-mamas', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'scary.Overall', 'sure', 'movie', 'cute', 'one', 'little', 'girls', 'watch', 'once', 'just', 'getting', 'nerves', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'video', 'rental', 'store']",N/A

Needless to say, it is now a part of our collection, and is probably the most watched DVD she has...even more than the Barbie movies she loves so much.The animation is very clear and the storyline is typical teen angst...Yasmin, Jade, Cloe, and Sasha are assigned a project that may clash with their plans to get ready for the prom.  When certain Bratz secrets are revealed in the course of the assignment and published for all to see, one of them is falsely accused and the arguments begin.  Dana and Nevra also make cameo appearances during the course of the movie.I've been kind of love/hate about the Bratz because of their too sultry appearance, sexy clothes, virtual lack of noses, and feet that pop off, but my daughter is enthralled with them, and seeing as Barbie hasn't had any major lasting negative effects on my life, I'll go with the flow of the new generation of dolls!Since we've gotten the Bratz movie, she's probably watched it 3 or 4 times per week...definitely worth our investment.",5,Bratz are the new Barbies,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1160,"['five', 'year', 'old', 'been', 'Bratz', 'fan', 'was', 'practically', 'toddler', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'commercial', 'first', 'movie', 'almost', 'hyperventilated', 'Needless', 'say', 'now', 'part', 'collection', 'probably', 'most', 'watched', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'so', 'much.The', 'animation', 'very', 'clear', 'storyline', 'typical', 'teen', 'angst', 'Yasmin', 'Jade', 'Cloe', 'Sasha', 'are', 'assigned', 'project', 'may', 'clash', 'plans', 'get', 'ready', 'prom', 'When', 'certain', 'Bratz', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'course', 'assignment', 'published', 'see', 'one', 'falsely', 'accused', 'arguments', 'begin', 'Dana', 'Nevra', 'also', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'course', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kind', 'love/hate', 'Bratz', 'too', 'sultry', 'appearance', 'sexy', 'clothes', 'virtual', 'lack', 'noses', 'feet', 'pop', 'off', 'daughter', 'enthralled', 'seeing', 'Barbie', ""n't"", 'had', 'major', 'lasting', 'negative', 'effects', 'life', ""'ll"", 'go', 'flow', 'new', 'generation', 'dolls', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Bratz', 'movie', 'probably', 'watched', '3', '4', 'times', 'week', 'definitely', 'investment']",N/A

But a newly assigned school project about ""self-expression"" sticks them with a heavy load, and the girls are wondering if they'll be able to ace the project AND have a rockin' prom.  When it's finally decided that the girls will take turns filming their preparations for prom and day-to-day lives for the project, the girls are thrilled that things are working out.  Will the prom be the best ever, as the girls dream it will be?  Or will the new gossip columnist ruin the prom AND their friendships?First off, let me just say that after watching this movie, I couldn't help smiling at how odd it was to see characters that I'm so used to giving a personality to, with their own personalities.  But I still liked the personalities that were given to them!  Well, all except for Cloe, anyway.  She was conceited and a little bit stuck up sometimes.  The only personality that never sickened me once was Sasha's.  She was cool!  Anyway, this was a good movie, considering that it's based on dolls.  It was longer than the ""My Scene"" movie (a rip-off forty-some minutes) lasting for one hour and one minute.  The animation seemed lame at first, but it was better after getting used to it.  The movie was sickening in some parts (ex: Jade is afraid she's losing her ""fashion sense"") and the movie was almost more like a long episode of a T.V. show than an actual movie, but I say that it's worth renting, especially if your child, sister, etc. is not old enough to realize that some parts are cheesy, or if you don't mind, yourself.  The bonus features were cool, although I highly recommend that you don't let little ones watch the deleted scene, because it was surprisingly creepy.  (I was watching it in the dark, too!)  The dress-up game was basically just the game off the website, the karaoke looked uninteresting, and the music video was boring, but the horoscope was okay, and the trivia was sort of fun.  I guess I just think that the special features were nice because it's just a shorter-than-most-movies-and-never-been-in-theaters DVD, and to have all of those bonuses is a big extra.  Overall, I say rent the movie, like I did!  It was good, but unless you have a younger child who adores it, it's not worth buying.",4,Starrin' & Stylin',1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,2297,"['Cloe', 'Yasmin', 'Jade', 'Sasha', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'best', 'prom', 'EVER', 'newly', 'assigned', 'school', 'project', 'self-expression', 'sticks', 'heavy', 'load', 'girls', 'are', 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'ace', 'project', 'AND', 'have', 'rockin', 'prom', 'When', 'finally', 'decided', 'girls', 'will', 'take', 'turns', 'filming', 'preparations', 'prom', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'project', 'girls', 'are', 'thrilled', 'things', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'Will', 'prom', 'be', 'best', 'ever', 'girls', 'dream', 'will', 'be', 'will', 'new', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'ruin', 'prom', 'friendships', 'First', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smiling', 'how', 'odd', 'was', 'see', 'characters', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'giving', 'personality', 'own', 'personalities', 'still', 'liked', 'personalities', 'were', 'given', 'Well', 'Cloe', 'anyway', 'was', 'conceited', 'little', 'bit', 'stuck', 'up', 'sometimes', 'only', 'personality', 'never', 'sickened', 'once', 'was', 'Sasha', 'was', 'cool', 'Anyway', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'considering', 'based', 'dolls', 'was', 'longer', 'Scene', 'movie', 'rip-off', 'forty-some', 'minutes', 'lasting', 'one', 'hour', 'one', 'minute', 'animation', 'seemed', 'lame', 'first', 'was', 'better', 'getting', 'used', 'movie', 'was', 'sickening', 'parts', 'ex', 'Jade', 'afraid', 'losing', 'fashion', 'sense', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'long', 'episode', 'T.V', 'show', 'actual', 'movie', 'say', 'worth', 'renting', 'especially', 'child', 'sister', 'etc', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'realize', 'parts', 'are', 'cheesy', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'cool', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'little', 'ones', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scene', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'creepy', 'was', 'watching', 'dark', 'too', 'dress-up', 'game', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'game', 'website', 'karaoke', 'looked', 'uninteresting', 'music', 'video', 'was', 'boring', 'horoscope', 'was', 'okay', 'trivia', 'was', 'sort', 'fun', 'guess', 'just', 'think', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'nice', 'just', 'shorter-than-most-movies-and-never-been-in-theaters', 'DVD', 'have', 'bonuses', 'big', 'extra', 'Overall', 'say', 'rent', 'movie', 'did', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'younger', 'child', 'who', 'not', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A

I've been a fan of all things genie since I was a kid and first watched ""I Dream of Jeannie"", so I really love the theme. We have the whole set of dolls from this Genie Magic series.

I won't bother rehashing the plot because you can read that on the product description page, but I will say that it was a very good story and lots of fun to watch. Many of the kids DVDs and videos are not written to be enjoyed by adults, but the Bratz series is. Even friends with no kids have enjoyed this DVD with us.
