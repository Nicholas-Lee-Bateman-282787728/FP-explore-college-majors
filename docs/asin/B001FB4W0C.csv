While I cannot fault anyone for their opinion, in my opinion the shows just keeps getting better. There was a lot of talk about how the show would rebound after Dean's death in season three but I think the writers did a wonderful job. Some people do not think that angels and demons should have been explored on this show. Religion is rooted in mythology, anything that is not tangible is consider part of the supernatural world. Having read a lot of different books on angels; I know they are not like religions make them out to be. They are emotionless soldiers; who just follow Gods orders. Demons are the ones equipped with more human like attributes. Supernatural did a good job of displaying this.There were some pretty good episodes this season as well. Wishful Thinking, being one of my favorites: seeing a giant teddy bear suffering and trying to kill himself left me at a loss for words. The casting of Castiel was great, Micha has great comic and dead pan delivery. There were flaws but not enough to warrant anything less than 5 stars. I did not like the new Ruby, but I enjoyed Sam pitfall into ""demonhood."" It explored an emotional irrational side of Sam. I enjoyed how Dean came back and how hell affected him. Supernatural, in my opinion, is one of the best, well written shows out.",5,"Best Show on ""Free"" TV!!!!",1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,1390,"['love', 'lore', 'myths', 'anything', 'dealing', 'supernatural', 'own', 'prior', 'seasons', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'anyone', 'opinion', 'opinion', 'shows', 'just', 'keeps', 'getting', 'better', 'was', 'lot', 'talk', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'rebound', 'Dean', 'death', 'season', 'three', 'think', 'writers', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'angels', 'demons', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'show', 'Religion', 'rooted', 'mythology', 'anything', 'not', 'tangible', 'consider', 'part', 'supernatural', 'world', 'Having', 'read', 'lot', 'different', 'books', 'angels', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'religions', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'are', 'emotionless', 'soldiers', 'who', 'just', 'follow', 'Gods', 'orders', 'Demons', 'are', 'ones', 'equipped', 'more', 'human', 'attributes', 'Supernatural', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'displaying', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Wishful', 'Thinking', 'being', 'one', 'favorites', 'seeing', 'giant', 'teddy', 'bear', 'suffering', 'trying', 'kill', 'left', 'loss', 'words', 'casting', 'Castiel', 'was', 'great', 'Micha', 'great', 'comic', 'dead', 'pan', 'delivery', 'were', 'flaws', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'anything', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'new', 'Ruby', 'enjoyed', 'Sam', 'pitfall', 'demonhood', 'explored', 'emotional', 'irrational', 'side', 'Sam', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Dean', 'came', 'back', 'how', 'hell', 'affected', 'Supernatural', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'well', 'written', 'out']",N/A

Rydholm,"[0, 0]","With the agonizing cliffhanger of season three's finale, I could not wait to see what the writers had in store for the fans in this season. Straight from the start they had us on the edge of our seats with the return of an uncertain character and the continuation of a great story. To be honest, I was a little worried after watching season 3. I was trying to figure out what they could do to keep me watching this show. The two main actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, really work well together and keep this show fresh this season. I have always been a fan of the supernatural and spiritual warfare. This season really went above and beyond when it came to continuing the story while still giving us fun episodes. The fighting between the heavenly host and the love to hate 'em demons only made me love the direction of this season more. A few well placed plot twists, and even better episode ideas really made this season engaging. I cannot recommend this show enough. If you have not started watching this show yet, now is a great time if not the best time to start tuning in. It is much more interesting if you have followed the whole series since the season premiere is the extention of a cliffhanger, but its still more than interesting enough to start here if you do not want to go back and watch them all.",5,I couldn't have asked for a more engaging season!,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,1321,"['agonizing', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'three', 'finale', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'writers', 'had', 'store', 'fans', 'season', 'Straight', 'start', 'had', 'edge', 'seats', 'return', 'uncertain', 'character', 'continuation', 'great', 'story', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'watching', 'season', '3', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'really', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'keep', 'show', 'season', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'supernatural', 'spiritual', 'warfare', 'season', 'really', 'went', 'when', 'came', 'continuing', 'story', 'still', 'giving', 'fun', 'episodes', 'fighting', 'heavenly', 'host', 'love', 'hate', 'demons', 'only', 'made', 'love', 'direction', 'season', 'more', 'few', 'well', 'placed', 'plot', 'twists', 'even', 'better', 'episode', 'ideas', 'really', 'made', 'season', 'engaging', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'show', 'enough', 'have', 'not', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'yet', 'now', 'great', 'time', 'not', 'best', 'time', 'start', 'tuning', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'have', 'followed', 'whole', 'series', 'season', 'premiere', 'extention', 'cliffhanger', 'still', 'more', 'interesting', 'enough', 'start', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch']",N/A

Watching Sam and Dean travel the countryside, ""hunting"" all sorts of evil is a kick. This season picks up where the last one left off, Dean stuck in Hell, and Sam taking his revenge by sending the black smoke back from whence it came. This one takes on color-eyed demons, movie monster madness, and ends with the big dark cheese himself rising up.My worry about all shows like this (dare I mention The Dead Zone) is that the writers will lose their way and in turn the show will lose its freshness. Fortunately, that has not happened to Supernatural. The stories are as strong as ever. And as always, there is a blend of small monster stories mixed into a broader ""evil taking over the world"" quest. The brothers play off one another very well, each with his own strengths and weaknesses. And even though they are constantly at odds with one another (e.g. Sam doing the bump bump with Ruby), they both value family above all else.Supernatural is without a doubt the coolest show on TV.

There is a great mix of humor and scares and the interplay between all the characters is wonderful.  I especially appreciate Dean's range in acting - he has to be going places.The show's premise is pretty straight forward:  the creatures of the night do exist, vampires, werewolves, boogymen, ghosts, demons, angels etc.Dean and Sam are brothers who are ""hunters"" who go about ridding the world of these monsters of the night using all kinds of arcane and silly things like throwing salt in their faces etc.  Shotguns work too.There are several overarching ARCs to the story which makes the show quite good.Oh, they ride around the midwest in a very cool black Impala - wish I had one of those.  And yes, the flavor is pure Americana.  It's wonderful.Give it a try if you haven't.In the beginning is an episode I bought that I had missed - it's about how dean and sam got started literally.

1188792,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001FB4W0C,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[16, 17]","Even though season three of ""Supernatural"" was tragically cut short because of the writer's strike, 16 episodes instead of the usual 22, it never came up short. It ended the season with one massive cliffhanger and left it's fans and viewers wanting to race through the summer to see what happened. Dean had to beat the clock thanks to his deal with the crossroads demon, and when the season ended, it left many people wondering how in the world it could continue. What did creator Eric Kripke have up his sleeve?. Will the show ever be the same?. Season four is still currently airing as of this writing, with only one more episode to go. The big season finale. It is sure to be brilliant thanks to an already brilliant season. So, what does season four have in store?. Let's get into it(without being spoilery)....The basic premise for season 4 concerns Dean Winchester(the continually show stealing Jensen Ackles)and his reappearance out of hell. He and the others will wonder how it happened, who did it, and if it plays a bigger part in something. Brother Sam(Jared Padalecki)has his own demons, all the while the two of them still traveling the highways and back roads of America hunting down evil...with some new help along the way in the form of Castiel(Misha Collins).Season four of ""Supernatural"" displays the show at it's very best. I have been thrilled and overjoyed with each passing season, one just as great or better than the last, and season 4 has truly elevated the show to another level. The scares, humor, and brotherly drama is all there in full force, but it seems so much more epic. The writers and everyone behind the scenes have thrown everything out there to deliver a whopper of a season. So, what to expect?. The season premiere, ""Lazarus Rising"", is the best season premiere of the show by far. It answers some questions, raises some more, and has a glorious introduction to Castiel. Perfect beginning. Other highlights of season 4 include ""In The Beginning"", which features a great guest appearance by Mitch Pileggi, Skinner on ""The X Files"". It's a great 'Back To The Future-esque' type episode that reveals some new surprises of the Winchester family. And they keep a comin' this season!. A top highlight is the fantastic ""Monster Movie"", a loving homage to the horror movies of the 30's and 40's, complete with the right staging, lighting, music and, best of all, shot in black and white. ""It's The Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester"" is a very cool Halloween episode. Fans waiting for the show to do an episode on the holiday shouldn't be disappointed. ""Family Remains"" is a classic horror story with a fun twist; ""Afterschool Special"" is a wonderful flashback episode looking at the Winchester bros in, you guessed it, high school; ""Jump The Shark"" is a shocking episode that puts a new wrinkle in the Winchester family; ""The Monster At The End Of The Book"" is just great. What may seem like a stand alone, quickly veers deep into the show and it's ongoing arc this season. The first few minutes are side splitting hilarious as the show takes a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' approach at it's own self and the fans. There are many more great episodes and moments, like the return of two fan favorites in ""Are You There God?, It's Me, Dean Winchester"", radical wishes coming true in ""Wishful Thinking"", and so much more. Bigm arc heavy episodes abound in ""On The Head Of A Pin"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", and others. Not a stinker in the bunch.Season four is filled to the brim with excitement, action, scares, chills, and plenty of new unbelieveable twists, turns, and surprises. It could of all veered off course if it weren't for the incredible Eric Kripke, and all of the amazingly talented people working on the show. Of course, the shows rests on the shoulders of the Winchester boys themselves, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Ackles continues to knock it out of the park and continuously impresses with each passing season. He gets plenty to chew on here. Padalecki really came into his own as Sam in season 2 and has continued to evolve from there. He gets some juicy stuff here in season four and he takes Sam to places we haven't seen before. It turns into some tight drama, and the brother/family drama that the show is so much about is tested throughout the season. Elsewhere, Jim Beaver continues to be a strong asset to the show(and the boys)as Bobby, and Genevieve Cortese takes over the role of Ruby(replacing Katie Cassidy, who I liked better in the role). Misha Collins, as Castiel, is a wonderful new addition to the show. He has the right balance of mysteriousness with Castiel.In the end, season four shows a series that is at the top of it's game. Hitting on all cylinders. Supernatural, like Buffy, just grows and grows from season to season, deepening it's story and inner family turmoil, with plenty of shocking surprises and twists along the way. Season four of Supernatural is shocking, brave, brilliant, witty, scary, and exciting.

We all knew that Dean would not stay in hell forever, and I was very curious how he would get out.  Never did I imagine that in addition to all the demons and ghosts we would have angels too.This season the main story line revolves around the book of revelations in the bible.  The demons are breaking the 66 seals nessasary to raise Lucifer from hell, and the angels are supposedly trying to stop it.  It turns out that while Dean was in hell, he broke the first seal and put everything in motion.Dean, Sam and Bobby are working their hardest, along side the angel Castiel, to prevent the seals from breaking, but are not haveing much luck.  It turns out that some of the angels want lucifer to rise in order to force a battle that they are convinced that they can win.The entire season is not completly dedicated to the angels and demons storylines.  It would not be Supernatural if it did not include a few episodes mixed in that make us laugh.  My 2 favorites are Wishfull Thinking, and Yellow Fever.  Wishfull Thinking involves residents of a town whose every wish is being granted via a wishing well in a chinese resturant.  The only problem is that the wishes go bad.  Dean test it out, and wishes for a sandwich, only to get food poisoning from it, and a little girl wishes for her teddy bear to become real and life size, only to get life size teddy that drinks all day, steals porn, and tries to commit suicide because he feels that life has no meaning.  Yellow fever involves a new twist on the tradional ghost story.  Dean and Sam head to a town where healthy residents are droping dead of heart attacks.  It turns out that they are infected with ghost sickness, which makes them afraid of everything, extremely paranoid, and will die after 3 days unless they scare the ghost into exercising itself.  Dean winds up infected and there is an extemely entertaining moment of him running down the street in fear of his life from a small dog with a pink bow in its hair.The season finale does a grerat job of wrapping up the season and setting up the next season.  We also find out the full truth about Ruby, and she gets what has been long coming to her.  The only real sour note is the ongoing storyline of Sam being addicted to demon blood.  I thought that was a little to crazy even for this show.The dvd extras are a little thin, but I recommend that everyone pick up this season.",5,Gets even better,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,2518,"['show', 'only', 'better', 'time', 'season', 'writers', 'find', 'new', 'creative', 'ways', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'knew', 'Dean', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'hell', 'forever', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'get', 'out', 'Never', 'did', 'imagine', 'addition', 'demons', 'ghosts', 'would', 'have', 'angels', 'too.This', 'season', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'book', 'revelations', 'bible', 'demons', 'are', 'breaking', '66', 'seals', 'nessasary', 'raise', 'Lucifer', 'hell', 'angels', 'are', 'supposedly', 'trying', 'stop', 'out', 'Dean', 'was', 'hell', 'broke', 'first', 'seal', 'put', 'everything', 'motion.Dean', 'Sam', 'Bobby', 'are', 'working', 'hardest', 'angel', 'Castiel', 'prevent', 'seals', 'breaking', 'are', 'not', 'haveing', 'much', 'luck', 'out', 'angels', 'want', 'lucifer', 'rise', 'order', 'force', 'battle', 'are', 'convinced', 'can', 'win.The', 'entire', 'season', 'not', 'completly', 'dedicated', 'angels', 'demons', 'storylines', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Supernatural', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'few', 'episodes', 'mixed', 'make', '2', 'favorites', 'are', 'Wishfull', 'Thinking', 'Yellow', 'Fever', 'Wishfull', 'Thinking', 'residents', 'town', 'wish', 'being', 'granted', 'wishing', 'well', 'chinese', 'resturant', 'only', 'problem', 'wishes', 'go', 'bad', 'Dean', 'test', 'out', 'wishes', 'sandwich', 'only', 'get', 'food', 'poisoning', 'little', 'girl', 'wishes', 'teddy', 'bear', 'become', 'real', 'life', 'size', 'only', 'get', 'life', 'size', 'teddy', 'day', 'steals', 'porn', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'life', 'meaning', 'Yellow', 'fever', 'new', 'twist', 'tradional', 'ghost', 'story', 'Dean', 'Sam', 'head', 'town', 'where', 'healthy', 'residents', 'are', 'droping', 'dead', 'heart', 'attacks', 'out', 'are', 'infected', 'ghost', 'sickness', 'afraid', 'everything', 'extremely', 'paranoid', 'will', 'die', '3', 'days', 'scare', 'ghost', 'exercising', 'Dean', 'up', 'infected', 'extemely', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'fear', 'life', 'small', 'dog', 'pink', 'bow', 'hair.The', 'season', 'finale', 'grerat', 'job', 'wrapping', 'up', 'season', 'setting', 'up', 'next', 'season', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'full', 'truth', 'Ruby', 'been', 'long', 'coming', 'only', 'real', 'sour', 'note', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'Sam', 'being', 'addicted', 'demon', 'blood', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'crazy', 'even', 'show.The', 'dvd', 'extras', 'are', 'little', 'thin', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'pick', 'up', 'season']",N/A

Another bonus in this series is the awesome transfer to DVD. I'm watching these episodes on my upconverting player and a 1080-p television and the picture is almost identical to the high-def broadcasts! I haven't seen any other DVD's with this quality of video and probably won't since the folks at Sony are trying to sell Blu-Ray and transfers like these make it unnecessary to switch. The detail in the closeups is astounding, nothing like the blurry and artifacted transfers done to a lot of programs. If you haven't watched these via an HDMI upconverting player you're in for a real treat. The quality has been there since season one and I hope it is still there in season 4.

In this season, Dean is still being overly protective of Sam. He has more responsibility than just hunting monsters in this season. He's the ""chosen"" one by the angels. Yes, they introduced angels in this season. They have their own twisted agenda and the demons fear them.  Viewers also get to see ""softer"" side of Dean with his emotional scenes. Jensen is a great actor and fit for the role. Moreover Sam has changed, he's darker and more confused in this season.

1188816,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B001FB4W0C,Elisabeth,"[3, 3]","This show has always had a biblical context in that the brothers are fighting demons.  However, in Season 4, things get a lot more biblical as we're introduced to angels and God's plan.  What shocking is that, rather than depicting angels as pure of heart, they're depicted as being morally corrupt.  Pretty daring move there.This show is still copying other horror movies (there's one scene taken straight from The Changeling where a rubber ball comes bouncing down the stairs), but also copies comedies, too (there's a buttons of flair scene that references the movie ""Office Space"").  This show has too much violence against women that bugs me.  I know these women are demons, but still, it bothers me that people could become desensitized to seeing a woman get beat up.This show is still laugh-out-loud funny as always.  My favorite episode is where Dean has an overactive fear response to minor things.  I cracked up watching him run in fear from a Yorkshire Terrier.There's some unrealism to this show (besides the supernatural element) like, if these guys don't have jobs, how can they afford food, gas, and hotel rooms?  Also, how is that these guys can be in fight after fight and not have broken bones?  There's one scene where Dean gets his skull smashed (twice!) against a porcelain bathroom sink...and yet, in the next scene, he's a little groggy, but otherwise okay to keep going. No way could anyone escape that ordeal without at least getting a concussion.Included in the DVD extras is a ""gag reel"".  I was expecting this to be a blooper reel, but instead it's just the two actors fighting for camera time.  I know I'm supposed to think this is funny, but it made them seem like camera hogs (hello, they're already the leads on this show) as well as unprofessional.  I ended up feeling sorry for the people who have to work with them.Luckily, despite their unprofessional attitude between takes, the final result is very smooth.  This show gets more and more compelling each season.  And each season ends with a shocker that makes you impatient to see the next season.One final note, I appreciate that the discs come separated rather than the discs resting on top of each other like in the other box sets.",4,Getting more biblical now,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,2221,"['show', 'always', 'had', 'biblical', 'context', 'brothers', 'are', 'fighting', 'demons', 'However', 'Season', '4', 'things', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'biblical', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'angels', 'God', 'plan', 'What', 'shocking', 'rather', 'depicting', 'angels', 'pure', 'heart', ""'re"", 'depicted', 'being', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'Pretty', 'daring', 'move', 'there.This', 'show', 'still', 'copying', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'scene', 'taken', 'straight', 'Changeling', 'where', 'rubber', 'ball', 'bouncing', 'down', 'stairs', 'also', 'copies', 'comedies', 'too', 'buttons', 'flair', 'scene', 'movie', 'Office', 'Space', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'women', 'bugs', 'know', 'women', 'are', 'demons', 'still', 'people', 'could', 'become', 'desensitized', 'seeing', 'woman', 'get', 'up.This', 'show', 'still', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'always', 'favorite', 'episode', 'where', 'Dean', 'overactive', 'fear', 'response', 'minor', 'things', 'cracked', 'up', 'watching', 'run', 'fear', 'Yorkshire', 'Terrier.There', 'unrealism', 'show', 'supernatural', 'element', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'jobs', 'how', 'can', 'afford', 'food', 'gas', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'Also', 'how', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'fight', 'fight', 'not', 'have', 'broken', 'bones', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Dean', 'skull', 'smashed', 'twice', 'porcelain', 'bathroom', 'sink', 'yet', 'next', 'scene', 'little', 'groggy', 'otherwise', 'keep', 'going', 'way', 'could', 'anyone', 'escape', 'ordeal', 'least', 'getting', 'concussion.Included', 'DVD', 'extras', 'gag', 'reel', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'blooper', 'reel', 'instead', 'just', 'two', 'actors', 'fighting', 'camera', 'time', 'know', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'think', 'funny', 'made', 'seem', 'camera', 'hogs', 'hello', ""'re"", 'already', 'leads', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'unprofessional', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'work', 'them.Luckily', 'unprofessional', 'attitude', 'final', 'result', 'very', 'smooth', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'compelling', 'season', 'season', 'shocker', 'impatient', 'see', 'next', 'season.One', 'final', 'note', 'appreciate', 'discs', 'come', 'separated', 'rather', 'discs', 'resting', 'top', 'other', 'other', 'box', 'sets']",N/A

And while I'm not exactly a tv junkie, I do have a number of shows I enjoy.  But Supernatural is where my loyalty lies.  And I still continue in my devotion.  I'm a still a giddy supernatural fan girl.That being said... what was up with this season?!One of original favorites of the series was the individuality of the episodes. Mini-movies, they were.  Overarching plot line?  Sure, super, fine by me.  But this season was heading in more of the traditional serial fashion at the expense of the show's original lure:  various monsters/urban legends/folklore tidbits.I think that is my biggest complaint.  But there are others.  If a show is going to keep up a serial feel, some consistency is needed.  I've never seen so much backtracking, gotchas, and never-mind-about-thats in my life.  So they want to bring in a Biblical and religious twist to the mythology. I don't mind at all.  But pick where you are going with the mythology, keep it in my mind, and stick to it--BEFORE you start making a bunch of episodes.Half the time, I felt the story had no idea where it was going.Were the creators trying to keep the faithful and the unfaithful alike happy? I realize the aforementioned Biblical and religious twist is a dangerous road, and overall I felt like the creators were doing a pretty good job of keeping the religion and spirituality in the territory of story fodder only without preaching religion nor tearing it down.  And on a personal note, the mythology they came up with was so different from my beliefs that it was very difficult to offend me.  But there was time when I felt my beliefs were offended, and I'm sure there was a time or two when others also felt the sting of preaching.But again, it's a dangerous road, and again, I felt overall they kept it balanced.Maybe they spent too much time worrying about that, though.The beginning of the season pretty much states God has personally commanded Castiel to pull Dean from Hell.  Okay.  But then the rest of the season muddies that up.  So what's going on?  Who is good? Who is evil? Who is working for who?  Where the heck is God?  How much does he know?  Why does everyone keep saying different things?  Where is the rhyme and reason here?Religion or anything else they could have used, it's a unfocused mess of direction.Now on to the good stuff. It still is Supernatural.  The humor, storytelling, and character chemistry is alive and well.  The magic of this show is still going strong.Only a few sentences, but I like to think it sums up the wonder and charm of the show.If only this season had figured out where it was going...",3,A rather... random season,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,2717,"['must', 'put', 'out', 'table', 'Supernatural', 'ONLY', 'show', 'have', 'EVER', 'faithfully', 'watched', 'get-go', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'tv', 'junkie', 'do', 'have', 'number', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'Supernatural', 'where', 'loyalty', 'still', 'continue', 'devotion', ""'m"", 'still', 'giddy', 'supernatural', 'fan', 'girl.That', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'season', 'One', 'original', 'favorites', 'series', 'was', 'individuality', 'episodes', 'Mini-movies', 'were', 'Overarching', 'plot', 'line', 'Sure', 'super', 'fine', 'season', 'was', 'heading', 'more', 'traditional', 'serial', 'fashion', 'expense', 'show', 'original', 'lure', 'various', 'monsters/urban', 'legends/folklore', 'tidbits.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'are', 'others', 'show', 'going', 'keep', 'up', 'serial', 'feel', 'consistency', 'needed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'backtracking', 'gotchas', 'never-mind-about-thats', 'life', 'want', 'bring', 'Biblical', 'religious', 'twist', 'mythology', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'pick', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'mythology', 'keep', 'mind', 'stick', 'start', 'making', 'bunch', 'time', 'felt', 'story', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'was', 'going.Were', 'creators', 'trying', 'keep', 'faithful', 'unfaithful', 'alike', 'happy', 'realize', 'aforementioned', 'Biblical', 'religious', 'twist', 'dangerous', 'road', 'overall', 'felt', 'creators', 'were', 'doing', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'religion', 'spirituality', 'territory', 'story', 'fodder', 'only', 'preaching', 'religion', 'tearing', 'down', 'personal', 'note', 'mythology', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'beliefs', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'offend', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'felt', 'beliefs', 'were', 'offended', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'time', 'two', 'when', 'others', 'also', 'felt', 'sting', 'preaching.But', 'again', 'dangerous', 'road', 'again', 'felt', 'overall', 'kept', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'worrying', 'beginning', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'states', 'God', 'personally', 'commanded', 'Castiel', 'pull', 'Dean', 'Hell', 'Okay', 'then', 'rest', 'season', 'muddies', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'Who', 'good', 'Who', 'evil', 'Who', 'working', 'who', 'Where', 'heck', 'God', 'How', 'much', 'know', 'Why', 'everyone', 'keep', 'saying', 'different', 'things', 'Where', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'here', 'Religion', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'unfocused', 'mess', 'direction.Now', 'good', 'stuff', 'still', 'Supernatural', 'humor', 'storytelling', 'character', 'chemistry', 'alive', 'well', 'magic', 'show', 'still', 'going', 'strong.Only', 'few', 'sentences', 'like', 'think', 'up', 'wonder', 'charm', 'show.If', 'only', 'season', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'where', 'was', 'going']",N/A

I have been wondering for the first 3 seasons how come Heaven doesn't lend a hand in the fight, then along comes the angels for season 4. Castiel appears to be a truly good angel, but some of his higher-ups may not be. And I KNEW there was a reason I never trusted Ruby! Dean was right, demons are evil, period. She only helped the boys to serve her own agenda.Just two of the highlights of this season are Dean screaming like a scared little girl at a kitten, (he'd been infected with a virus) and Jensen Ackle's performance in the scene where he tearfully tells Sam about what he went through in Hell. I was glad to see Bobby back again. Basically all of the cast knocked it out of the park this season, as well as the writers and other crew on the show.So as for season 5, I have no idea how they will top Lucifer rising up from Hell, but I know they will! At the end of each season I always say they will never top this, but they always do. I'd have to say right now this is my favorite show on tv; it has the most imagination and the wildest plot twists and turns, but it's still easy to follow along. I'm glad their ratings have increased this year, they really deserve it. This is one of the most unfairly underrated shows on tv.

Hmmm. . .I want the rest of this story.As I think I've mentioned in at least one previous review somewhere, Jensen Ackles is kicking acting bohiney this year (he did a mighty fine job last year, too), and it's good that his time in ""the pit"" is finally being addressed because if anyone can blend angst, humor and soul-crushing pain in one episode, it's Ackles.Good one!",4,"solid episode, but it's a cliffhanger",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,1293,"['Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'cliffhangers', 'one', 'Winchester', 'brothers', 'encounter', 'Anna', 'woman', 'who', 'Dean', 'out', 'paraphrase', 'tuned', 'Angel', 'Radio', 'Anna', 'can', 'hear', 'angels', 'talking', 'hearing', 'chatter', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'also', 'lot', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'THE', 'Dean', 'label', 'Dean', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'Sam', 'roll', 'eyes', 'not', 'fave', 'said', 'angels', 'can', 'hear', 'angels', 'become', 'someone', 'demons', 'want', 'have', 'possession', 'what', 'better', 'own', 'personal', 'radio', 'tell', 'what', 'God', 'angels', 'are', 'planning', 'angels', 'want', 'kill', 'what', 'worse', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'reveal', 'plans', 'dark', 'side', '.The', 'part', 'episode', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'expanded', 'out', 'encounter', 'Dean', 'Alistair', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'mighty', 'fine', 'time', 'torturing', 'Dean', 'Hell', 'Hmmm', '.I', 'want', 'rest', 'story.As', 'think', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'least', 'one', 'previous', 'review', 'somewhere', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'kicking', 'acting', 'bohiney', 'year', 'did', 'mighty', 'fine', 'job', 'last', 'year', 'too', 'good', 'time', 'pit', 'finally', 'being', 'addressed', 'anyone', 'can', 'blend', 'angst', 'humor', 'soul-crushing', 'pain', 'one', 'episode', 'Ackles.Good', 'one']",N/A
1188827,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B001FB4W0C,General Zombie,"[8, 10]","Note: Obviously, this is only a review of the show, not the DVDs themselves, and readily spoils material from earlier seasons.Nowadays the trend in television is to peak early and stay on the air too long. Thus far, Supernatural has avoided these pitfalls, and has steadily improved from the show's entertaining, but hardly remarkable first season, which focused on conventional monsters, urban legends and horror film homages. Season 2 proved to be a substantial leap, where the show expanded and detailed the demonic underpinnings of the narrative, and with season 4 we see another increase in quality. While Supernatural always had individually entertaining episodes, it was only after Dean's (Jensen Ackles) Faustian bargain concluding season 2 that the central story arc came into focus. Now the mythology grows more impressive, with Dean mysteriously retrieved from hell by a disturbingly impassive, stoic angel Castiel (Misha Collins), and called to assist in the struggle against Lilith. Some are surely skeptical about the introduction of angels, as they aren't the coolest supernatural figures around, but Kripke and the host (haha) of writers provide an atypically powerful, unnerving portrayal. While wussy, friendly angels are common in modern popular culture, Supernatural draws upon a more biblical and Miltonian view of angels as fierce warriors and messengers. Moreover, the angels aren't precisely friends to humanity, but simply oppose the demonic hordes as well and will use the Winchesters as necessary to combat them. Misha Collins's Castiel, the most prominent angelic figure, is the most effective addition to the show. Collins's performance is brilliantly minimalistic, with his ragged look and deliberate movements perfectly suggesting a lack of familiarity with his body. Even better, Collins slowly inserts a subtle sense of humanity into the role as Castiel grows more conflicted about his duties, and finally creates truly intriguing character to go along with the Winchesters.Simultaneously, Supernatural complicates the central relationship between Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean. While at the show's beginning it was the loyal Dean that dragged a rebellious Sam back into the ""family business,"" the roles are now substantially shifted: Dean has, unsurprisingly, been scarred and left somewhat hesitant by his months in hell, while Sam has learned to work by himself, even expanding his demonic powers which he had sworn to forsake. (And yes, the shifty but supposedly pro-human demon Ruby has returned, though now portrayed by the less attractive Genevieve Cortese.) Using a fraternal relationship as the heart of the show proves to be the series most impressive element. While, ahem, manly bonding is hardly unheard of in pop culture, the relationship between two brothers, particularly those of similar ages, are still unique, and too often ignored in our romance-obsessed world. Dean has always been the more likable of the two, as Sam is usually too whiny, but Sam has slowly gained more depth as the show progressed. While Padalecki and Ackles both initially struck me as somewhat vapid hunks, they've both proven to be effective leads and both provide some of their best work this season. Indeed, after this season Ackles's cocky and jokey but also committed and loyal Dean has cemented his position as one of my favorite TV characters.With all the developments in the central story, the conventional monster-of-the-week and comedy episodes are still atypically strong. Previously the humorous episodes tended to be weaker, but now we have some first rate examples in the requisite B&W; horror tribute ""Monster Movie"" and the oft-hilarious malevolent wishing well episode ""Wishful Thinking."" They also find some new twists on the monster angle, including the disgusting cannibalistic manbeast the Rougarou in ""Metamorphosis,"" the murderous Siren (yes, like in Greek mythology . . . kinda) in ""Sex and Violence"" and a classic bit of magician-oriented horror in ""Criss Angel is a . . ."" Kripke and company also don't hesistate to take the show in bizarre directions, as in the ""Back to the Future"" style ""In the Beginning,"" where Dean meets his youthful parents and ""It's a Terrible Life,"" where Sam and Dean have inexplicably lost their pasts and identities, and instead work in a seemingly generic office. The season has no real throwaway episodes, always maintains the level of stylish eeriness that defined the show, and manages to step up the gruesomeness and intensity a bit from time to time. (""Family Remains"" and the vicious ghoul epic ""Jump the Shark"" are both particularly nasty.)The final few episodes concerning the central story are perhaps not as strong as I would've hoped considering how compelling the season had been previously, but the conclusion still leaves me with great expectations for season 5. I fear that it may well try and be to big, if you understand my point, but the rock solid nature of this season give me reason to hope that they can pull it off. If they can maintain this level of quality for another season and if 5 is indeed the end, Supernatural will likely vie for the title of the best supernatural/horror TV show ever.All in all, this is a terrific season from what is, with the end of The Shield, my favorite show currently on the air.

1188834,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001FB4W0C,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","To resuscitate someone who is being tortured in hell is not a simple thing, especially when this character does not even believe in God, though he believes in the devil, monsters and other demons. One could think that this resuscitation could lead him to a better understanding of what he calls the supernatural. But Dean is a very stubborn mind. He negotiated himself with some demon the deal that saved Sam's life and killed him within twelve months, and yet he does not want to believe in the existence of a good principle, good supernatural being somewhere in this vast cosmos.The authors then take the precaution to come up with a resurrection that is not too iffy that is to say unbelievable, even with a very wide fictional mind. Dean is thus gotten out of hell by an angel, Castiel, and this fourth season is the season of the angels, among other supernatural beings. The angels are new at the job here and also very difficult to understand since their logic is a logic of obedience. Don't think, just obey. God is the only one who can provide the world with anything like a logic. A resurrection that is also the beginning of the Apocalypse, as we learn that during his stay in Hell, Dean broke the first Seal and started the Apocalypse.Castiel is the angel who is attached to Dean but he sure is not well adapted to this professional unbeliever as for the divine. He is doubled with Uriel, the angel of death, who is black but who will reveal himself a traitor and Castiel will have to kill him. Then Zachariah will come as the boss of poor Castiel and this Zachariah being white cannot be a traitor, could he now, but he is a stubborn non-questioner. Obey first and don't ask question afterwards. This will lead to the disobedience of Castiel, which will not change one iota to the destiny of the world. Hence Castiel becomes himself a traitor, but not to his newly made friends, the Winchester brothers, but to his hierarchy and an absent God.There is also a fallen angel, Anna, who disobeyed and is thus rejected on earth to err and haunt but she manages to get close to the Winchesters and she manages in a fight between the Winchesters and Uriel to recapture her grace that Uriel was carrying in a glass tube around his neck and she is reinstated into her angel status. This shows, if it were necessary to show such a thing that the house of God is not particularly clean and orderly. There is quite some mess in that house, with traitors and disobedient angels and the boss, God, doing nothing about it as if he were impotent or just unaware, which is even worse than being impotent, since it is incompetence which is at stake here. But we learn that God is just not here, not willing to interfere with human affairs.But who is Castiel? That question is answered in this season, and that tells us what angels are. Angels were the first creatures created by God, whereas Demons are twisted human souls; but they do need a human body to be able to walk the Earth, without destroying everything. They are spirits that have to inhabit a human body to be able to intervene in the world's affairs and among humans. In other words they are not better than demons. Angels need the acceptance of the human they plan to inhabit before going inside him or her, whereas Demons just invade humans without asking questions. One day a simple man, Jimmy Novac from Pontiac, Illinois, is literally captured by the spirit of an angel and he becomes an angel and disappears from his family. To make sure we understand very well that fact, Castiel is removed from the body of Jimmy Novac who goes back to his life with his family. But he is the direct target of all kinds of demons and his family is at risk. So accepts a second time to go on an angel mission, driven away by Sam and Dean.But the conclusion of this angel is: ""I serve heaven. I don't serve man. And I certainly don't serve you!"" he says to Dean and Sam. He is supposed to look after Dean and yet he does not serve him. He only obeys orders from a God who ""has left the house"" as Zachariah so clearly says. And yet there is a double mission that Castiel must carry out. He must make sure that Sam is protected from Dean and Bobby who are trying to wean him from the demonic blood he has taken the habit of drinking. With his special nature and the fact that he was fed with demon blood when 6 months old (from the Yellow Eyed Demon, named Azazel, that was killed in Season 2), Sam gets stronger when he drinks demon blood, developing his psychic powers. Thinking that it is their mission to stop the Apocalypse, Sam and Castiel, and to a lesser extent Dean, are willing to do anything to destroy the Demon responsible for the breaking of the other 65 Seals (the breaking of 66 Seals should free Lucifer, the Fallen Angel, from his cage). Ruby seems to be on their side and tracks the demons for them, also giving demon blood to Sam. Yet demon blood will become an issue between the two brothers, Dean starting to feel that his brother is losing some of his humanity.On the other hand Castiel has to prepare Dean for the next mission that is revealed at the end of this season: he is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer after his liberation from his cage. What links the two missions is that Lilith is maybe a demon but she is the last seal that is to be broken before Lucifer can come out of his cage. Killing Lilith is breaking the sixty-sixth seal if that is the proper number. So Sam has to kill her, hence he has to get addicted to demon blood to be strong enough, and then when .Lucifer is out Dean is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer.That's what these angels call the wider picture, not the survival or salvation of a few people who are possessed by some demons, but the salvation of the whole humanity after it is cleaned up of all the unworthy people and after the universe is cleaned up of all its demonic forces. A beautiful program that is described in the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse, the killing of such a proportion of humanity wavering between one third and two thirds if not all of the living and the resurrection of a small proportion of those who died through the centuries. But where is the general of that war? Where is the master mind of this world?God has left the house, don't forget.That's when the two brothers get into the wider picture. We all know about the love of these two men that I would like to call boys (with flashbacks to their infancy, childhood and teenage) and yet are, let's agree to disagree on that term, young men. We all know that this love became sour little by little because of the impossibility to actually share their feelings for many and varied reasons. Since Sam has in him some demonic blood, he is different, abnormal and that abnormality was identified as wanting to go to law school and be a lawyer. He is a monster and Dean cannot admit it up to this fourth season because that would mean fighting to kill him, a brother he loves deeply.On the other hand, and this season is quite clear about the lack of communication, both Sam cannot speak of his feelings as a partially demonic being nor Dean as a resurrected person has spent four months of human time in hell, maybe four for forty years of hellish time, and he cannot tell anything to his own brother about it. In the same way Sam cannot speak to Dean because Dean is not like him since he is partly demonic, hence on the side of those who tortured his brother and thus Dean would not understand, and Dean cannot speak of his sojourn in hell because he finally, but too late, admits that he enjoyed the suffering he gave to other, being one of Hell's torturers, because it more or less justified him in his own choices, which is to hunt and kill all monsters, including his own brother.Speaking of existential dilemmas we can hardly find a better illustration and realization that this one.And if it were that simple, there would be no real problem. But both of them are haunted by supernatural events and beings. Dean is haunted by his own guardian angel, Castiel, and the boss of this being, Uriel, a traitor, and Zachariah, a blind obedient subject. And then he is haunted by all kinds of demons who try to approach him, like Ruby, who he will kill at the very end of the season after Lucifer got out of his cage, freeing his own brother at the same time. Sam is haunted by his mother, his girlfriend Jessica and their burning death. He is haunted by the demonic blood he carries. He is haunted by Ruby who has to make sure he kills Lilith and is strong enough by then to do it. He is haunted by other demons who try to push him along.And both are haunted by the fact that they have destroyed many demons and saved many potential victims but they also have killed innocent people who were possessed by demons or who became the victims of some vengeful act from Lilly, like Victor Henricksen. Sam has been hesitant on that procedure of killing demons: he has preferred for a while to exorcize the demons out of their victims, even though many did not survive their experience. You obviously cannot satisfy yourself and your brother, yourself and your guardian angel, yourself and your patronizing demon, etc. Nothing is simple in this world, not even double but multifarious and variegated.All the more complicated because not one, not even the angels know what is going to happen, except maybe at the very last minute. No one knows? Wrong. One does. The writer who is writing the story of Sam and Dean about a couple of hours, a couple of days or a couple of weeks ahead of time. He is a prophet of the lord, and as such protected by archangels, and his books will become The Winchester Gospel. But apparently no one can change what he has written. Yet at the end Castiel and Dean decide to check what he wrote to know where Sam is in order to be able to stop him breaking the seal because Lilith is the last seal.But too bad again. Dean will arrive there. In Saint Mary's convent but too late. He will see Lilith dead, Lucifer coming out and he will kill Ruby, the demon and not only the borrowed body. Because the wider image of the situation is that Ruby has betrayed them both, making sure Sam will be strong enough to destroy the last Seal and free Lucifer from his cage. Sam is finished with his mission but he can be of use later, so let him get sorry and say so to Dean, and Dean is just starting his own mission by killing a lying manipulator and accepting Sam's apology and getting him back into the chuck wagon, or should I say the Chuck Shirley wagon? We will only know in the next season. But the team is on its two feet again.

So I have been sort of playing catch up over the year. And I could not wait to see season 4 after i finished 3 and I really wanted to be able to watch s5 on TV every week like I used to with s1 so me and my brother searched the internet and found s4 online!!!!! Let me just say that was a lot of computer time to finish this season but Oh MY GOD was it worth it! Season 4 is bar far the best season in my opinion. Just the introduction of the Angels for me made it so cool and Sam and Dean trying to stop Lilith from opening the 66 seals!!! ahhhh it was just awesome. And surprisingly this was without a doubt THE FUNNIEST season of Supernatural ever. Dean is freakin hilarious this time around even more so than usual.

The stories delve into supernatural investigation from two brothers who are part of a family heritage of hunters who hunt the supernatural. The actors who play the brothers are great and you never feel like they are acting as brothers but that they are both actually related. In this season Dean returns from being sent to Hell; he made a pact with a demon in order to save his brother.

With Dean dealing with the horrendous circumstances he faced in hell and the new responsibilities that Sam feels he is responsible for, the story becomes a roller coaster ride of emotions.Many times you will see the brothers caught between their emotional inclinations as well as their duty to save people from demons, vampires, and all the other forces that go bump in the night.There is still plenty of action in this season, but what makes this season really interesting is the more complicated acting that both Jared and Jensen give to tell their troubled situations.There are definitely more times that the brothers break down during this season, so if you don't like seeing men cry on screen, this might not be for you, but I felt that the actors were playing out the roles as competently as possible given the situations they were in.If anything this was a season more focused on story-telling and emotional drama compared to the other seasons.",5,More Emotional Story-Telling,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,1027,"['seasons', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'poignant', 'one', 'Dean', 'dealing', 'horrendous', 'circumstances', 'faced', 'hell', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'Sam', 'responsible', 'story', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'emotions.Many', 'times', 'will', 'see', 'brothers', 'caught', 'emotional', 'inclinations', 'as', 'well', 'duty', 'save', 'people', 'demons', 'vampires', 'other', 'forces', 'go', 'bump', 'night.There', 'still', 'plenty', 'action', 'season', 'what', 'season', 'really', 'interesting', 'more', 'complicated', 'acting', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'give', 'tell', 'troubled', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'times', 'brothers', 'break', 'down', 'season', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'men', 'cry', 'screen', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'felt', 'actors', 'were', 'playing', 'out', 'roles', 'as', 'competently', 'possible', 'given', 'situations', 'were', 'in.If', 'anything', 'was', 'season', 'more', 'focused', 'story-telling', 'emotional', 'drama', 'compared', 'other', 'seasons']",N/A

Even when you first meet him and his actions come across as 'cold', he strikes you as a fascinating character that will soon develop into something fantastic that will become very lovable.

It's short, but it's nicely edited and well-paced with no slow or awkward moments.  First 10 min is moderated, the other 20 being mainly fan questions, with a brief interruption from Supernatural's rival show- The Ghostfacers(that show sucks! just kidding).  This is a great bonus disc for me since i didn't get to go and can now watch some of that event at any time(and i think it's worth more than just one viewing).DVD package- The packaging is different than the first 3 seasons as others have mentioned.  Gone is the fold out, panoramic style, now it's in a hard-cover case that holds all 6 discs in a plastic spindle(folks, i admit, i don't know the terminology for these things).  At first i thought this was an extremely cheap plastic spine that could fall out, but i think they made it that way on purpose in case you ever need to take the spine, with all 6 discs, out of its box for whatever reason.  The bonus disc gets it's own placeholder inside the box.  If you're going to buy season 4(and you should), the target version is the way to go with the fun bonus disc.  However, i could've sworn the ad last week said it was 45 min, not 30.  Of course, the standard extras are there as well- gag reel, 3 commentaries, 3 featurettes, and deleted scenes.Me rambling- anyway, i tried season one when i thought it was a monster-of the-week show.  I found out it was more though thanks to the story arc or theme that runs through each season.  Since the first, i've been hooked and am now a fan/collector.  The best thing about the show has to be the chemistry of the characters, especially the Winchester brothers.  You could have a down show or two, or an episode whose 'monster' you don't like or care for, but it doesn't matter.  The real reason you tune in is to see the guys and how they deal with their ongoing situation together, and being a part of that journey.  So if you enjoy shows that have a horror theme, yet dramatic with its story arc, and infuse humor when needed, while centered around some lively characters, Supernatural is for you.",5,"great show, dvds, and bonus disc",1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,2262,"['Bonus', 'disc-', 'others', 'i', 'bought', 'target', 'version', 'still', 'sale', 'second', 'straight', 'week', 'btw', '30', 'minute', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'few', 'writers', 'Q', 'A', '2008', 'Comic', 'Con', 'short', 'nicely', 'edited', 'well-paced', 'slow', 'awkward', 'moments', 'First', '10', 'min', 'moderated', 'other', '20', 'being', 'mainly', 'fan', 'questions', 'brief', 'interruption', 'Supernatural', 'rival', 'show-', 'Ghostfacers', 'show', 'just', 'kidding', 'great', 'bonus', 'disc', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'go', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'event', 'time', 'i', 'think', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', '.DVD', 'package-', 'packaging', 'different', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Gone', 'fold', 'out', 'panoramic', 'style', 'now', 'hard-cover', 'case', '6', 'discs', 'plastic', 'spindle', 'folks', 'i', 'admit', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'terminology', 'things', 'first', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'extremely', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'spine', 'could', 'fall', 'out', 'i', 'think', 'made', 'way', 'purpose', 'case', 'ever', 'need', 'take', 'spine', '6', 'discs', 'box', 'reason', 'bonus', 'disc', 'own', 'placeholder', 'box', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'season', '4', 'should', 'target', 'version', 'way', 'go', 'fun', 'bonus', 'disc', 'However', 'i', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', 'ad', 'last', 'week', 'said', 'was', '45', 'min', 'not', '30', 'course', 'standard', 'extras', 'are', 'there', 'well-', 'gag', 'reel', '3', 'commentaries', '3', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes.Me', 'rambling-', 'anyway', 'i', 'tried', 'season', 'one', 'when', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'monster-of', 'the-week', 'show', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'though', 'thanks', 'story', 'arc', 'theme', 'season', 'first', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hooked', 'am', 'now', 'fan/collector', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'be', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'especially', 'Winchester', 'brothers', 'could', 'have', 'down', 'show', 'two', 'episode', ""'monster"", 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'care', ""n't"", 'matter', 'real', 'reason', 'tune', 'see', 'guys', 'how', 'deal', 'ongoing', 'situation', 'together', 'being', 'part', 'journey', 'So', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'have', 'horror', 'theme', 'yet', 'dramatic', 'story', 'arc', 'infuse', 'humor', 'when', 'needed', 'centered', 'lively', 'characters', 'Supernatural']",N/A

Garrard ""the G-man""","[2, 2]","Though most on this forum have given the show kudos for the angels versus demons storyline, I have to give the writers their ""props"" for finally bringing Dean, wonderfully played by Jensen Ackles, to the forefront of the season. The character gets to mature, realizing his place in the ongoing battle against the forces of evil as well as being Sam's (Jared Padalecki) protector, even when the younger brother is toying with his own inner ""demon"".  Ackles shines in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Rapture"", the season opener ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean Winchester"", and the season-ending ""Lucifer Rising"".  Why he nor Padalecki have not received Emmy nominations is a further indictment against the decision makers of The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.Fine acting is also provided by Jim Beaver as the dependable and Johnny-on-the-spot Bobby Singer, Misha Collins as Castiel the angel, Genevieve Cortese as the ""is-she-a-good-demon-or-a-bad-demon"" Ruby, Robert Wisdom as Uriel, and Julie McNiven as Anna. The casting of ""The X-Files"" Mitch Pileggi as the Winchester boys' grandfather in ""In the Beginning"", as is the father-son team of John and Michael Rubenstein, along with character greats Barry Bostwick and Richard Libertini in ""Criss Angel is a Douche Bag,"" another outstanding episode.""After School Special"" features younger versions of Sam and Dean, played convincingly by Colin Ford and Brock Kelly, respectively.  The installment also makes a commentary on the cruelty of high school students against each other.""Monster Movie"" brilliantly pays homage to the classic horror films of the 30's and 40's, complete with period music, costuming, and black and white filming.As a whole, the season features excellent writing, top-knotch direction, scoring, and some true thrills.

The series is a nice cut away from the recent shows like CSI, NCIS, or Criminal Minds an the such as the main protagonists of this show aren't human criminals or murderers but supernatural spiritual enemies that you can't just shoot with a normal weapon or lock away in a normal prison and so the Winchester brothers must always come up with a mystical and sometimes unusual way to defeat their enemies.  This season will deal with the coming apocalypse and the introduction of powerful angels to join the fight this time, but as expected the brothers are highly dubious of these events since their time fighting demons an the such they have never encountered an angel before.  The show as with the other previous three seasons will be entertaining and leave you wanting for more especially with the cliffhanger of this seasons end.  The video like the rest of the season box sets is clear and sharp no distortions to worry about and the audio is great to,  the extras are some deleted scenes, a few gag reels, a documentary segment about the mythology of the afterlife more specifically Heaven and Hell, and a few commentaries on some episodes.

Supernatural is a great show and Season 4 is among the best of the best, so an easy 5 stars in that department. I don't like this style of packaging though because I find it difficult to remove the discs without flexing them. Am I missing some secret removal technique? Now I'm no expert on DVD manufacturing, but it seems that repeat bending would weaken the glue in the middle of the discs, causing them to eventually split apart (delaminate). Maybe it's an evil conspriacy to try and get everyone to buy the same product over and over again, as it wears out prematurely...I dunno.Is anyone else anal about DVD packaging like me? Everyone seems to be fine with it so far, so maybe I'm just a weirdo. I'm fully aware that I have multiple DVD reviews that mainly gripe about packaging, but it's something I think often gets overlooked.

Dean is back from hell, the angels are in town, the demons are gearing up, Lucifer is on the rise, and Sam has been taken in by Ruby's lies.  Bobby gets more screen time as the boys' surrogate father figure.  We even get to learn more about John and Mary Winchester before they were married, and how their history with Azazel goes back farther than imagined.The show also explores spirituality to a degree.  Dean asks the questions that many of us ask:  Why are we here?  Why do good people suffer while evil seems to prevail?  Is there really a god, and what is the nature of this god?  Even the angels have doubts and failings, so it's hard to believe in something higher.Fortunately, there are also some humorous episodes to take our minds off of the heavy stuff:  ""Wishful Thinking,"" featuring Ted Raimi and a giant, live teddy bear; ""It's a terrible life,"" with Dean and Sam in an alternate reality as corporate drones; and ""Yellow Fever,"" which ends with a nice little music video of Jensen Ackles lip syncing to ""Eye of the Tiger.""Can't wait for the fifth season!",5,"Still a high quality show, and bigger stakes now",1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,1253,"['not', 'easy', 'writers', 'producers', 'maintain', 'quality', 'tv', 'series', 'manage', 'do', '4th', 'season', 'entertaining', 'scary', 'funny', 'provocative', 'series', 'Dean', 'back', 'hell', 'angels', 'are', 'town', 'demons', 'are', 'gearing', 'up', 'Lucifer', 'rise', 'Sam', 'been', 'taken', 'Ruby', 'lies', 'Bobby', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'boys', 'surrogate', 'father', 'figure', 'even', 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'John', 'Mary', 'Winchester', 'were', 'married', 'how', 'history', 'Azazel', 'back', 'farther', 'imagined.The', 'show', 'also', 'spirituality', 'degree', 'Dean', 'questions', 'many', 'ask', 'Why', 'are', 'here', 'Why', 'do', 'good', 'people', 'suffer', 'evil', 'prevail', 'really', 'god', 'what', 'nature', 'god', 'Even', 'angels', 'have', 'doubts', 'failings', 'hard', 'believe', 'something', 'higher.Fortunately', 'are', 'also', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'take', 'minds', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'Wishful', 'Thinking', 'featuring', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'giant', 'live', 'teddy', 'bear', 'terrible', 'life', 'Dean', 'Sam', 'alternate', 'reality', 'corporate', 'drones', 'Yellow', 'Fever', 'nice', 'little', 'music', 'video', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'syncing', 'Eye', 'Tiger', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'fifth', 'season']",N/A

Suddenly he finds he's working for God; An angel named Castiel brings Dean back because he has a mission for him--to stop the seventh seal from being broken and allowing Satan to roam free. Dean IS on a mission from God he just doesn't know all the details yet.The fourth season saw major changes in store for Sam and Dean Winchester. Creator/producer and writer Eric Kripke begins winding up his five year story arc for the Winchester brothers and their constant battle with demons and evil. During the fourth season--one fo the best by the way--Sam and Dean have to stop something that is killing angels, have a close encounter with movie monsters that have come to life and Dean gets to meet his grandfather and grandmother when he gets thrown into the past.The direction is top notch as are the production values (in fact I can only think of one other fantasy/horror series that looks as good as ""Supernatural"" and that's ""Fringe"" which also had a strong first season). We get a trio of commentary tracks, a number of very good featurettes including one that focuses on the mythology of the series, a gag reel and deleted scenes.I had the DVD before returning it (and being able to get the Blu-ray instead). The DVD looks quite good with nice detail, colors, etc. BUT the Blu-ray looks truly stunning. The only flaw is the menu for the Blu-ray. For some reason everytime you jump past the ads you're taken to the ""special features"" menu and you can have a hard time getting back to the main menu. It's a bit sloppy in terms of the Blu-ray authoring but otherwise it is a terrific set.

It is now more serialized.  It is no longer only about two brothers driving around the country in Impala, with classic rock blasting, and fighting monster of the week.  Episodes are more interconnected as the overall story revolves tightly around the coming battle between angels and demons.The story also turns much darker as the two brothers struggle with inner demons: Sam's addiction to demon blood and power, and Dean's guilt over what he was driven to do in Hell.  The two young actors have stepped up and met the demands of the roles, though the new actress for Ruby seems bland and out of place acting at opposite side of them.The battle of angels and demons is no ordinary black and white affair.  We learn that God is forever silent, and that some angels are shady and would not hesitate a second to sacrifice human lives for a ""greater"" cause.  Lucifer was formerly an angel.  ""Fallen"" angels may or may not be ""evil"" in Supernatural's universe.  I marvel at how successfully the creator and writers of the show explore the Christian themes and myths.  There are countless references to the Bible and Milton's Paradise Lost, and echoes of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials.  In so doing, the season goes beyond popular entertainment to the realm of serious fantasy.I recommend anyone new to the series to watch the first three seasons, and then stay in sequence for season four.
