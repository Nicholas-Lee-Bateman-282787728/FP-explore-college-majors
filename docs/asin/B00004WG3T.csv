554616,AALC8WLL6Z6DU,B00004WG3T,JustMe,"[22, 25]","This film version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic remains gratifyingly true to the book. The acting is uniformly excellent. Sets, music, direction are all top notch. I actually have only two complaints - one small, one more substantial. Small complaint - Cedric's hairstyle. Larger complaint - for no reason that I can discern, they eliminated the episode where Cedric gives the crippled boy a ride into town on his pony and arranges to buy him a crutch. Since this is the first evidence the villagers have of Cedric's kind nature, it makes no sense to exclude it.  (If V. Dann's review is correct, and the original was actually much longer, this would help explain the exclusion of that scene - although I can't imagine what they'd have done with an additional two hours.  Except for the scene I mentioned, the story is fully told.) I rate this version at least as good as the Ricky Schroeder/Alec Guiness version (my personal favorite - when will that ever be available on DVD!?), better than the Mary Pickford version, and I need to see the Freddie Bartholomew version again to adequately compare.",4,Remarkably Good,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1105,"['film', 'version', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'classic', 'gratifyingly', 'true', 'book', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Sets', 'music', 'direction', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'actually', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'complaints', 'one', 'small', 'one', 'more', 'substantial', 'Small', 'complaint', 'Cedric', 'hairstyle', 'Larger', 'complaint', 'reason', 'can', 'discern', 'eliminated', 'episode', 'where', 'Cedric', 'crippled', 'boy', 'ride', 'town', 'pony', 'buy', 'crutch', 'first', 'evidence', 'villagers', 'have', 'Cedric', 'kind', 'nature', 'sense', 'exclude', 'V.', 'Dann', 'review', 'correct', 'original', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'longer', 'would', 'help', 'explain', 'exclusion', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'additional', 'two', 'hours', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'story', 'fully', 'told', 'rate', 'version', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'Ricky', 'Schroeder/Alec', 'Guiness', 'version', 'personal', 'favorite', 'when', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'better', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'version', 'need', 'see', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'version', 'again', 'adequately', 'compare']",N/A
554617,A2SRX0T9IH6MW,B00004WG3T,J.W. & S.W.,"[5, 8]","A dreadful version of the Burnett classic. The boy playing Cedric is far too old for the part - the only thing that saved Ceddie in the book from being cute enough to puke over was the fact that he was only seven years old. This kid comes off as insipid and painfully effeminate. Other boys his age would beat the snot out of him the moment they saw him, and rightfully so. I felt like giving him a few whacks myself.In addition, it takes away the punch of the Earl's redemption - this version has him sending Cedric out of the house when it looks as though his claim is false (albeit regretfully), while in the book and the other two movie versions he has come to value his grandson for who he is, not for the title he holds - a great leap considering how little he had valued Ceddie's father.Skip this version. Stick with the Freddie Bartholomew or Ricky Schroder interpretations, both of which are far superior.J.W.",1,Terrible,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,918,"['dreadful', 'version', 'Burnett', 'classic', 'boy', 'playing', 'Cedric', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'only', 'thing', 'saved', 'Ceddie', 'book', 'being', 'cute', 'enough', 'puke', 'over', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'kid', 'off', 'insipid', 'painfully', 'effeminate', 'Other', 'boys', 'age', 'would', 'beat', 'snot', 'moment', 'saw', 'rightfully', 'so', 'felt', 'giving', 'few', 'whacks', 'addition', 'away', 'punch', 'Earl', 'redemption', 'version', 'sending', 'Cedric', 'house', 'when', 'claim', 'false', 'regretfully', 'book', 'other', 'two', 'movie', 'versions', 'come', 'value', 'grandson', 'who', 'not', 'title', 'great', 'leap', 'considering', 'how', 'little', 'had', 'valued', 'Ceddie', 'father.Skip', 'version', 'Stick', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'interpretations', 'are', 'far', 'superior.J.W']",N/A
