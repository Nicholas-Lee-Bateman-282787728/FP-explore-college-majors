1046401,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B000MGBSLM,Tracy Vest,"[7, 8]","Cheryl Pollak portrays up and coming model Marla Hanson, a far too trusting novice who comes to New York in 1986 with dreams of stardom. After pounding the pavement and working at a local watering hole, her star begins to rise. Capturing the eye of photographer Eric Warner (Dale Midkiff), he invites her to his studio to create a better portfolio for her. She meets his lighting assistant, Steve Roth (a perfectly cast and very creepy Kirk Baltz), who immediately develops a fixation for the midwestern beauty with deadly consequences. She accepts a sublet room in an apartment he owns and rents out to several models not realizing what she's getting into. Soon he's stalking her and after being nice too long, she tells him to take a hike. Furious at her rejection, he arranges to have his friends attack her and slash her face with a razor. But she is attacked a second time during the trial when the defense tries to blame her for the attack.One of the better true life crime stories brought to television (it was even really filmed in New York City), it was first aired in 1991 as ""The Marla Hanson Story."" Unable to reignite her modeling career, Hanson turned to championing victim's rights.",4,Supermodel cut down in her prime,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,1197,"['Cheryl', 'Pollak', 'up', 'coming', 'model', 'Marla', 'Hanson', 'far', 'too', 'trusting', 'novice', 'who', 'New', 'York', '1986', 'dreams', 'stardom', 'pounding', 'pavement', 'working', 'local', 'watering', 'hole', 'star', 'rise', 'Capturing', 'eye', 'photographer', 'Eric', 'Warner', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'studio', 'create', 'better', 'portfolio', 'lighting', 'assistant', 'Steve', 'Roth', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'very', 'creepy', 'Kirk', 'Baltz', 'who', 'immediately', 'fixation', 'midwestern', 'beauty', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'sublet', 'room', 'apartment', 'out', 'several', 'models', 'not', 'realizing', 'what', 'getting', 'Soon', 'stalking', 'being', 'nice', 'too', 'long', 'take', 'hike', 'Furious', 'rejection', 'have', 'friends', 'attack', 'slash', 'face', 'razor', 'attacked', 'second', 'time', 'trial', 'when', 'defense', 'blame', 'attack.One', 'better', 'true', 'life', 'crime', 'stories', 'brought', 'television', 'was', 'even', 'really', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'first', 'aired', '1991', 'Marla', 'Hanson', 'Story', 'Unable', 'reignite', 'modeling', 'career', 'Hanson', 'turned', 'championing', 'victim', 'rights']",Face Value
