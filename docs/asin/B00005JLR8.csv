604101,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLR8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The more I watch this beautiful film the deeper I'm touched by its grace and elegance.  It's one of the more impressionable films to come out in quite some time, and it truly deserves a wider audience.  `In America' was actually recommended to us shortly after my wife became pregnant with our first child.  We were told it was a film that would really help you appreciate a parent's love for their children.  That said, my wife and I couldn't make it through the film with dry eyes, and even now we still tear up when we watch this movie.  `In America' beautifully captures the heart of a family, their dire devotion to each other, to their children, to their parents and the inherent need for constant care and nurturing.  Blessed with well executed delivery and fantastic acting on the parts of everyone involved `In America' quickly becomes one of the most engrossing and engaging family dramas to date.Jim Sheridan wrote and directed this masterpiece of a film with such conviction it's undeniable.  The story revolves around a poor Irish couple who move to Hells Kitchen illegally in order to give a better life to their children.  Johnny and Sarah are a loving couple who are devoted to their children.  In fact, last night at birthing class with my wife our instructor asked which movie parent we most sympathized with and or hoped to imitate and Paddy Considine's character immediately came to mind.  He is the father we should all strive to be.  He's devoted, protective, compassionate, understanding and loyal.  The film focuses on their struggle to support themselves, Johnny working hard to become an actor, as well as their struggle to fit in.  They live in a drug infested building yet they manage to keep out of harms way due to their kind hearted nature.  The real heart of this magical film is the power of forgiveness and acceptance.  Sarah and Johnny had previously lost a son, Frankie, and throughout this movie they are plagued with guilt and blame, but the uplifting and heart tugging finale will prove miracles can happen.The acting here is the biggest draw, for without powerful and convincing portrayals the film would have fallen far from its anticipated impression.  Paddy Considine gives one of my favorite performances of the year, and probably my favorite male performance of 2003.  He's convincing and relatable, controlled and so sympathetic.  We can feel his pain, his joy, his sadness, his fear, everything he feels he portrays so vividly it's amazing to watch.  Samantha Morton is one of my favorite actresses and here she again delivers a knock down drag out performance.  She can say so much with her big beautiful eyes it's uncanny.  Djimon Honsou is also brilliant as the families neighbor Mateo, the sick recluse who opens his heart to this family.  Their relationship is the crux for so much of what takes place.  But when talking about acting one must mention the Bolger sisters, Sarah and Emma, who are not only adorable but are so convincing in their performances that I'm astounded these girls are so young.The film is told through the eyes of the oldest daughter Christie and I think that helps in adding layers of sentiment and compassion.  We watch her struggle to be `grown up', fighting her feelings of guilt and pain in relation to the loss of her brother in order to be strong for her parents who obviously can't handle their own pain.  The film reaches levels of sentiment I've never witnessed before, but it's not ever so much that it comes off cheesy or propaganda.  It's realistic in every way and engaging from start to finish.  `In America' is one of the best films of the past decade and is sure to bring a tear to your eye and a smile to your face.",5,A beautiful film about the bonds of family that is sure to tug your heartstrings...,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,3709,"['more', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'film', 'deeper', ""'m"", 'touched', 'grace', 'elegance', 'one', 'more', 'impressionable', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'quite', 'time', 'truly', 'wider', 'audience', 'America', 'was', 'actually', 'recommended', 'shortly', 'wife', 'became', 'pregnant', 'first', 'child', 'were', 'told', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'really', 'help', 'appreciate', 'parent', 'love', 'children', 'said', 'wife', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'dry', 'eyes', 'even', 'now', 'still', 'tear', 'up', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'America', 'beautifully', 'heart', 'family', 'dire', 'devotion', 'other', 'children', 'parents', 'inherent', 'need', 'constant', 'care', 'nurturing', 'Blessed', 'well', 'executed', 'delivery', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'parts', 'everyone', 'involved', 'America', 'quickly', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'engaging', 'family', 'dramas', 'date.Jim', 'Sheridan', 'wrote', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'such', 'conviction', 'undeniable', 'story', 'around', 'poor', 'Irish', 'couple', 'who', 'move', 'Hells', 'Kitchen', 'illegally', 'order', 'give', 'better', 'life', 'children', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'are', 'loving', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'devoted', 'children', 'fact', 'last', 'night', 'birthing', 'class', 'wife', 'instructor', 'asked', 'movie', 'parent', 'most', 'sympathized', 'hoped', 'imitate', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'character', 'immediately', 'came', 'mind', 'father', 'should', 'strive', 'be', 'devoted', 'protective', 'compassionate', 'understanding', 'loyal', 'film', 'struggle', 'support', 'Johnny', 'working', 'hard', 'become', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'fit', 'live', 'drug', 'infested', 'building', 'yet', 'manage', 'keep', 'harms', 'way', 'due', 'kind', 'hearted', 'nature', 'real', 'heart', 'magical', 'film', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'acceptance', 'Sarah', 'Johnny', 'had', 'previously', 'lost', 'son', 'Frankie', 'movie', 'are', 'plagued', 'guilt', 'blame', 'uplifting', 'heart', 'tugging', 'finale', 'will', 'prove', 'miracles', 'can', 'happen.The', 'acting', 'here', 'biggest', 'draw', 'powerful', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'far', 'anticipated', 'impression', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'year', 'probably', 'favorite', 'male', 'performance', '2003', 'convincing', 'relatable', 'controlled', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'joy', 'sadness', 'fear', 'everything', 'so', 'vividly', 'amazing', 'watch', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'here', 'again', 'knock', 'down', 'drag', 'performance', 'can', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'big', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'uncanny', 'Djimon', 'Honsou', 'also', 'brilliant', 'families', 'neighbor', 'Mateo', 'sick', 'recluse', 'who', 'heart', 'family', 'relationship', 'crux', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'place', 'when', 'talking', 'acting', 'one', 'must', 'mention', 'Bolger', 'sisters', 'Sarah', 'Emma', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'adorable', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'performances', ""'m"", 'astounded', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'young.The', 'film', 'told', 'eyes', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Christie', 'think', 'adding', 'layers', 'sentiment', 'compassion', 'watch', 'struggle', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'fighting', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'pain', 'relation', 'loss', 'brother', 'order', 'be', 'strong', 'parents', 'who', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'own', 'pain', 'film', 'levels', 'sentiment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'witnessed', 'not', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'off', 'cheesy', 'propaganda', 'realistic', 'way', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish', 'America', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'sure', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'smile', 'face']",In America
604102,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JLR8,Andy Orrock,"[12, 12]","'In America' is a quasi-autobiographical work penned by director Jim Sheridan and daughters Naomi and Kirsten (herself a director).  I added ""quasi"" because a little research turns up that Jim Sheridan had a brother Frankie who passed away in tragic circumstances (I'm not giving anything away by telling you that).  That character woven into the 'In America' story in conjunction with the story that is obviously the current Sheridan family's own:  Irish mother and father with two young girls in tow trying to make it as immigrants in a hardscrabble NYC neighborhood in the early eighties.Real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger play what are obviously the on-screen portrayals of Sheridan siblings Kirsten and Naomi.  Emma - playing younger sister Ariel - is adorable right from the get go.  Older sister Sarah is the mature, world-weary (but still sweet) Christy.  When she tells her father ""I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year,"" believe it.  And don't miss her stark, beautiful rendering of 'Desperado.'  Perfect.In case you can't tell, I was enchanted by these two girls.  But Samantha Morton is a treat, too.

604105,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B00005JLR8,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[8, 9]","Few films paint a more uplifting and poignant picture of what the American dream can be, should be, than Jim Sheridan's heartwrenching masterpiece, 'In America.'  Nor are there many films out there that will open up the tear gates and yet leave you smiling like this one does.Jim Sheridan set out to make a tight, precise story that would resonate with many.  He succeeded in a very big way.  'In America' hits all the marks of a great film.  It entertains you, it moves you, it educates you.  You come away bleeding, but all the better for it nonetheless.Sheridan doesn't waste time.  The first scene gives you the crux.  The Sullivan family waits in their packed station wagon to cross the Canadian border into America.  Why?  To repeat the journey that all our ancestors went through.  To forget something over 'there' in hopes of starting something better and brighter over 'here.'  The Sullivans' secret from over there bubbles out during the customs check.  When the border guard asks the father, Johnny (Paddy Considine) how many children they have, he stares blankly ahead and says, 'three.'  Sarah (Samantha Morton) quickly corrects him, 'two.'  Their youngest, Frankie, died from a brain tumor, but his ghost torments the whole family.  Was it really a tumor or was it that fall down the stairs that could have been prevented?  Unresolved guilt hovers over the parents like a phantom, while their angelic girls, Christy and Ariel (Emma and Sarah Bolger) accept their brother's loss as part of the scheme of things.Starting over is full of new challenges, new joys and new pains.  Johnny and family move into a dingy tenement full of equally dingy characters.  But it is the little things that keep the coals of faith burning.  The first cold shower in a humid NYC summer, the ratty air-conditioner that Johnny drags across town to cool family and frustrations, the ice-cream sundaes, the family jaunts to the cinema (cooler than the apartment!), and all the while, Johnny struggles to find his place on the Broadway stage (How American is that!).  All tiny steps through the passage of rebirth.The costs are high and failure lurks everywhere.  Johnny meets rejection after rejection and finally ends up cabbing.  With her sparkling candor, Ariel voices the disappointment that plagues her family, 'Things aren't the same here.  I don't have any friends. And you, dad, don't play with us anymore.'  Things are indeed different as Johnny and Sarah struggle to make ends meet and to put the ghost of Frankie behind them.  Sarah becomes pregnant with their new child, a promise of a better future.  Yet, Johnny can't accept this new future because he hasn't let the past go.  His pent-up guilt and frozen pain have congealed in him, turning him into a robot of frayed nerves and cold distance.  Sarah senses the source of Johnny's failure and tries to pull it out of him. When Johnny half-heartedly touches Sarah's growing stomach, she explodes,  'You can't touch the thing you've created, and that's why you can't create something that will touch others!' In trying to survive and keep his family afloat, Johnny nearly loses his humanity.Yet, the Sullivans' are saved just in time by their odd neighbor, Mateo (Dijimon Hounsou).  An African artist locked up in his wounds and loneliness, he paints with his own blood and frightens the whole tenement with his violent screams. Christy and Ariel break into his world unawares.  In one of the film's numerous poignant scenes, they stop at his door for their first trick-or-treat and won't be denied.  Knock and you shall receive.  Two alien worlds crash together and a bond is forged.  The Sullivans' find their first 'American' friend and Mateo begins to venture out from his locked world.  And all this, the doing of Christy and Ariel.  They sense a fellow wounded heart in Mateo, yet one capable of extraordinary love.  Johnny has his doubts about this freakish neighbor, until Mateo gives him a lesson in being grateful for what he has.  And then it's all downhill to a mighty bang.  The baby's coming and the pregnancy is not without risk...Mateo passes out in the stairwell and his frig is full of medicine...The pace quickens into a crescendo that is guaranteed to leave you wet-eyed.  Resolution, sacrifice, salvation and the continuance of life.  They're all there.  Waiting to be discovered.  A lot has already been said about the superb acting in this film, and it's all true.  Not a bad apple in the bunch.  While the adults all do fine work, the prize must go to the Bolger sisters.  Ariel's impish innocence and Christy's maturity beyond her years will leave you glued.  That's not acting, it simply being yourself before the camera.More than the heart-wrenching and stellar performances, its the little stuff that Sheridan sneaks into each scene that trips you up. Some many things to identify with, to make your own. Ariel's honest query, 'But where did ET go?,' the girls first Halloween contest, 'We got a prize only because we were different.  I don't want to be different anymore!' and the family's first trip to an amusement park where Johnny must win the ball-throwing contest even if it means sacrificing their last dollar. So much that touches us on a human level, so much about what it means to be American.  A nation of 'losers,' drifters who must 'lose' something, sacrifice something in order to win it all back and more.  Take a chance on this film, I guarantee you won't fail to find something new and wonderful, 'In America.'",5,Heartbreaker!,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,5510,"['Few', 'films', 'paint', 'more',

604106,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JLR8,Benjamin,"[42, 43]","Jim Sheridan's IN AMERICA, though you may not realize it when you watch it, is a fable about wishes, dreams, good defeating bad, families growing stronger, love outlasting all adversity and America as the land of opportunity. It's a delightful film, touching without being too cute.One thing you must realize throughout the film, when it takes turns toward optimism when other films would grow darker, is that the story is told through the eyes of Christie, the 10-year-old daughter of an Irish immigrant family recently relocated to New York. She narrates the story. She speeds it up and slows it down as she needs to. She talks of her sister Ariel's fears, of her mother's strength and of her father's lost smile. And, most importantly, she puts a positive spin on each of her proud family's struggles.Another director might have taken this same story and gone in a different, darker direction with it. The elements are there, certainly. The family is poor, living in a tenement alongside beggars and drug addicts. Johnny, the girls' father, is an out-of-work actor who's uprooted his family to escape sad memories of his son Frankie, who died. Mateo, the next-door neighbor, and Sarah, the mother, are both faced with life-threatening conditions.But the atmosphere that Sheridan provides us in this film is comforting and light. The city is enchanting. The tenement is both scary and magical, depending upon the story that Christie is telling the audience. No adult problem goes unsolved for long, even ones that seem particularly bleak. Throughout these positive twists, the importance of the narrator is key. Happy endings are important to a little girl, particularly one who feels so responsible for her own family. At one point in the story, for instance, she saves the family from their latest crisis and relates to her father that she's been the family's savior for a year.Though it focuses on her entire family, it's Christie's story. And, while she's telling it, it's really moving and uplifting.The acting here is uniformly terrific. Paddy Considine, playing Johnny the father, is a revelation. He's attractive, strong, a little crazy and yet weighed down by grief.

The parents are both expertly played by a very moving Paddy Considine and an always astounding Samantha Morton.

604109,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B00005JLR8,Char,"[1, 1]","The reason that I bought this movie was because I liked the song-and-dance in ""West Side Story"" entitled ""In America,"" and I thought, ""Hmm, maybe this movie called ""In America"" is somehow a take-off on that song...""  Actually, I don't yet discern any great relatedness between that song and this movie, except that it is about a couple that emigrates to New York City and lives in poor circumstances.An impoverished Irish couple and their two young daughters move to New York, illegally, from Canada.  They are running from the sore memory of a child that died, looking for a new life and prosperity.  The only place in the City they can find to live is a ""junkie"" building in Hell's Kitchen.  The movie makers depict it as looking reminiscent of the classic popular idea of a ""haunted house,"" but in the form of a gigantic apartment building.If you ""LOVE everything that LIVES""---to borrow a phrase from the movie---I think you will love this all-for-LIFE movie.I felt it was slow to catch fire, so be patient until Halloween, when a surprising ""devil"" is revealed in the ""haunted house"" in this ""Hell.""  Then, the story becomes very beautiful and its working out becomes emotionally gripping.I had a very hard time understanding the dialogue.  The speech of the two little girls' was especially hard to comprehend.  I'm sure something was technically wrong with the film's audio.  Turning the sound up to level 45 helped a bit.If you can't understand the words of the little girl's talk at the beginning of the movie, which sets some of the groundwork for the plot, I think I can tell you with some accuracy that she says something relating to the fact that she has a deal with her deceased little brother in Heaven that he will obtain answers to three wishes for her.My DVD disc offered a choice of two versions of the movie.  I chose to watch the full-screen version on Side A that had no scenes cut.Even though the story was set in the ""mean streets"" of Hell's Kitchen, there was only one F word and no other language that might be offensive to some viewers.  There was one sex scene done in an abstract and somewhat explicit way with minimal nudity.  Except for those two incidents, it really could almost pass as a ""family film.""  ---It does deal just a little bit with explicit themes of Faith, so if you object to that, don't watch it!It seems this film was declared ""Movie of the Year"" in 2005.  In my opinion, it deserves great accolades.  It's a well-acted, moving story!  I was very touched by the character of Matteo, a big guy with a big heart, whom the movie maker compares (in a good-bye moment) with a certain famous, lovable, small movie character: ET.  I will be re-watching this movie to tap greater depth of meaning and to pick up more dialogue.  The greatest charm and beauty of this movie is the children and the child-likeness in the theme it conveys.The loss of a child often seems to produce a separative effect for a couple that undergoes that kind of emotional crisis.  Possibly this movie has the potential to offer some particular healing for people who've suffered in that way.",5,Feast in Hell's Kitchen,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,3109,"['reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'liked', 'song-and-dance', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'entitled', 'America', 'thought', 'Hmm', 'maybe', 'movie', 'called', 'America', 'somehow', 'take-off', 'song', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'discern', 'great', 'relatedness', 'song', 'movie', 'couple', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'poor', 'circumstances.An', 'impoverished', 'Irish', 'couple', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'illegally', 'Canada', 'are', 'running', 'sore', 'memory', 'child', 'died', 'looking', 'new', 'life', 'prosperity', 'only', 'place', 'City', 'can', 'find', 'live', 'junkie', 'building', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'movie', 'makers', 'depict', 'looking', 'reminiscent', 'classic', 'popular', 'idea', 'haunted', 'house', 'form', 'gigantic', 'apartment', 'building.If', 'LOVE', 'everything', 'LIVES', '-to', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'movie', '-I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'all-for-LIFE', 'movie.I', 'felt', 'was', 'slow', 'catch', 'fire', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'Halloween', 'when', 'surprising', 'devil', 'revealed', 'haunted', 'house', 'Hell', 'Then', 'story', 'very', 'beautiful', 'working', 'out', 'becomes', 'emotionally', 'gripping.I', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'speech', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'was', 'especially', 'hard', 'comprehend', ""'m"", 'sure', 'something', 'was', 'technically', 'wrong', 'film', 'audio', 'Turning', 'sound', 'up', 'level', '45', 'helped', 'bit.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'words', 'little', 'girl', 'talk', 'beginning', 'movie', 'groundwork', 'plot', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'accuracy', 'something', 'relating', 'fact', 'deal', 'deceased', 'little', 'brother', 'Heaven', 'will', 'obtain', 'answers', 'three', 'wishes', 'her.My', 'DVD', 'disc', 'offered', 'choice', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'chose', 'watch', 'full-screen', 'version', 'Side', 'A', 'had', 'scenes', 'cut.Even', 'story', 'was', 'set', 'mean', 'streets', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'F', 'word', 'other', 'language', 'might', 'be', 'offensive', 'viewers', 'was', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'done', 'abstract', 'somewhat', 'explicit', 'way', 'minimal', 'nudity', 'two', 'incidents', 'really', 'could', 'almost', 'pass', 'family', 'film', '-It', 'deal', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'explicit', 'themes', 'Faith', 'so', 'object', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'declared', 'Movie', 'Year', '2005', 'opinion', 'great', 'accolades', 'well-acted', 'moving', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'character', 'Matteo', 'big', 'guy', 'big', 'heart', 'whom', 'movie', 'maker', 'good-bye', 'moment', 'certain', 'famous', 'lovable', 'small', 'movie', 'character', 'ET', 'will', 'be', 're-watching', 'movie', 'tap', 'greater', 'depth', 'meaning', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'dialogue', 'greatest', 'charm', 'beauty', 'movie', 'children', 'child-likeness', 'theme', 'conveys.The', 'loss', 'child', 'often', 'produce', 'separative', 'effect', 'couple', 'kind', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'Possibly', 'movie', 'potential', 'offer', 'particular', 'healing', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'way']",In America

604111,A95SF04RX9G8,B00005JLR8,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[0, 0]","In America is a brilliant film about an Irish family who moves to New York in search of better opportunities for themselves. While this sounds like a cliche, the story and characters are anything but, and because of this, they resonate deeply with the viewer. Instead of a hackneyed family-getting-to-know-America story, we get people dealing with real issues, struggling not only to fit in in their new home, but also to fit in in their own family.The Sullivan family moves to New York, and they are basically flat broke and with no prospects for income. The Sullivans consist of father Johnny (Paddy Considine), mother Sarah (Samantha Morton), and their daughters Christy and Ariel (real-life Dublin sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger). They are dealing with the loss of their son Frankie, who Christy believes is watching over them, and will grant their wishes when they really need them. Johnny and Sarah have been dealing with the loss in different ways: Sarah would rather just be able to forget her son and concentrate on loving her daughters who are still alive, but Johnny has never been able to distance himself from Frankie.They move into an apartment in a house filled with junkies, and a downstairs neighbor who often screams quite loudly. They eventually meet this man, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), and discover that he's actually quite an amiable man, though Johnny is hesitant to accept him, suspicious of his motives. The girls develop a fondness for Mateo, as he plays games with them, and when Sarah becomes pregnant again, Mateo assures her that good things will come with the new baby. However, Sarah learns that if the baby will have health problems if it comes too soon, and she herself will have health problems if it's too late. However, the girls become worried when Mateo's health begins deteriorating, and when their father becomes increasingly distant as he struggles to keep his family afloat in America.Director Jim Sheridan co-wrote the screenplay with his daughter Naomi based on their own life story, and it's clear from the outset that this is a perfectly realistic portrayal of a family with hopes and dreams that often exceed their means. This is not a fairy tale story of American opportunity and success; instead it is a story of personal pain and the difficulties we have in coping with the loss of family members taken from us at an early age.The acting is phenomenal by everyone involved. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton both give wonderfully nuanced performance in difficult roles: they have to be loving parents and spouses, yet detached and melancholy at the same time, and they pull it off. The young actors are excellent as well: Emma Bolger infuses Ariel with sprightly vigor, and Sarah Bolger creates the character of Christy as a young girl who's been forced to grow up faster than she'd like, but taking it all in stride. And Djimon Hounsou, who is usually cast as some sort of African barbarian, finally gets an opportunity to play a character that is not just a stereotypical role. Mateo is at first unsettling, but Hounsou's charisma allows us to believe in the size of Mateo's heart and his raw passion for life.I cannot say enough good things about In America. It is a tale filled with wonderful characters, and it manages to bring across its theme of hope without using sentimental sap, but rather by investing its story in its characters and not the other way around. We feel their sadness and can relate to their feelings and actions, though we might not always agree with what they do or say. But that's life: we don't always want to act a certain way, but sometimes it's not up to us. You just have to trust in your loved ones to carry some of the load for you.",5,Just a beautifully heavy film,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3716,"['America', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Irish', 'family', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'search', 'better', 'opportunities', 'cliche', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'anything', 'resonate', 'deeply', 'viewer', 'Instead', 'hackneyed', 'family-getting-to-know-America', 'story', 'get', 'people', 'dealing', 'real', 'issues', 'struggling', 'not', 'only', 'fit', 'new', 'home', 'also', 'fit', 'own', 'family.The', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'moves', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'basically', 'flat', 'broke', 'prospects', 'income', 'Sullivans', 'consist', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'real-life', 'Dublin', 'sisters', 'Sarah', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'are', 'dealing', 'loss', 'son', 'Frankie', 'who', 'Christy', 'watching', 'will', 'grant', 'wishes', 'when', 'really', 'need', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'have', 'been', 'dealing', 'loss', 'different', 'ways', 'Sarah', 'would', 'rather', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'son', 'concentrate', 'loving', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'Johnny', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'distance', 'Frankie.They', 'move', 'apartment', 'house', 'filled', 'junkies', 'downstairs', 'neighbor', 'who', 'often', 'quite', 'loudly', 'eventually', 'meet', 'man', 'Mateo', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'discover', 'actually', 'quite', 'amiable', 'man', 'Johnny', 'hesitant', 'accept', 'suspicious', 'motives', 'girls', 'develop', 'fondness', 'Mateo', 'games', 'when', 'Sarah', 'pregnant', 'again', 'Mateo', 'good', 'things', 'will', 'come', 'new', 'baby', 'However', 'Sarah', 'baby', 'will', 'have', 'health', 'problems', 'too', 'soon', 'will', 'have', 'health', 'problems', 'too', 'late', 'However', 'girls', 'become', 'worried', 'when', 'Mateo', 'health', 'deteriorating', 'when', 'father', 'increasingly', 'distant', 'keep', 'family', 'afloat', 'America.Director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'daughter', 'Naomi', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'clear', 'outset', 'perfectly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'family', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'often', 'exceed', 'means', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'American', 'opportunity', 'success', 'instead', 'story', 'personal', 'pain', 'difficulties', 'have', 'coping', 'loss', 'family', 'members', 'taken', 'early', 'age.The', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'give', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'difficult', 'roles', 'have', 'be', 'loving', 'parents', 'spouses', 'yet', 'detached', 'melancholy', 'same', 'time', 'pull', 'off', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'well', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'Ariel', 'sprightly', 'vigor', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'character', 'Christy', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'faster', ""'d"", 'like', 'taking', 'stride', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'usually', 'cast', 'sort', 'African', 'barbarian', 'finally', 'opportunity', 'play', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'Mateo', 'first', 'unsettling', 'Hounsou', 'charisma', 'believe', 'size', 'Mateo', 'heart', 'raw', 'passion', 'life.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'America', 'tale', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'bring', 'across', 'theme', 'hope', 'using', 'sentimental', 'sap', 'rather', 'investing', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'feel', 'sadness', 'can', 'relate', 'feelings', 'actions', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'agree', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'want', 'act', 'certain', 'way', 'not', 'up', 'just', 'have', 'trust', 'loved', 'ones', 'carry', 'load']",In America

I found a DVD copy in the rental store's bargain bin and bought it on that reputation. While not a bad film I again must wonder why is it that critics tend to rave about merely, at best, competent films? Yes, most films, books, CDs, etc. are utter crap so I realize the standard retort would be `you've answered your own query'- yet....still when such an obviously flawed film is boostered and receives Oscar buzz I shake my head. The film was directed by Jim Sheridan, whose best-known prior film was My Left Foot, and is a mish-mash of a film that tries to be many things but fails to be what all films should strive for most- a great film.In many ways it's sort of a modern Angela's Ashes told from a female child's perspective.... The basic problem is the film simply does not know whether it wants to be a realistic slice of New York poverty/tragedy, an uplifting Frank Capran fantasy, or a mystical allegory, so it ends up a middling piece of mush that leaves the viewer wanting more. As for the DVD features- the film and sound were fine, the DVD commentary rather pedestrian though. Sheridan tends to ramble between comments on the film, the `real' biographical elements that went into the tale, and times when he seems to be speaking just to fill the track. There are deleted scenes, but nothing of any consequence, and an alternate ending that merely consists of a slight twist on the film's use of Christy's camcorder as an all-seeing eye to tell a highly condensed version of the story. Would that Sheridan had concentrated more on what he wanted to tell, rather than how he wanted to tell it, and the film would have succeeded far more than it does.

604116,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JLR8,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 4]","`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved.  The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new.  The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah & Emma Bolger).  Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition.  Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect.  In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light.That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend.  It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states.  No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed.  As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some.  They need each other.The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow.  This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness.  As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life.  This is due mostly to the impressive cast.  Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here.  I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette.  Regardless, her performance was harrowing.  She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping.Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season.  He was brilliant and deserved some recognition.  His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping.  And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting.  They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow!This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone.

Director Jim Sheridan (&quot;My Left Foot&quot;) leads the cast and crew in creating this masterpiece.  Its unique plot of an Irish family who moves to the US is brilliant.  As the film continues, more storylines combine to one another, making this film more remarkable.  The physical and emotional surroundings offer more realisms than most other modern-day films.  The family's hardships are expressed wonderfully from the writing to the acting to the environmental backgrounds.  As the parents struggle more intensively to support the family, one of the daughters, Christy, begins expressing how wishmaking, prayer, and magic affect the family and her.  It especially becomes more heartfelt once the family introduces themselves to a neighbor, a lonely man dying of AIDS.  The storyline never stops surprising audiences.Samantha Morton (&quot;Sweet And Lowdown&quot;) and Djimon Hounsou (&quot;Amistad&quot;) are triumphant in their Oscar-nominated roles (Best Actress/ Best Supporting Actor).  Both offer great heartfelt presences through every scene, Morton as the struggling mother and Hounsou as the lonely neighbor friend.  The expressions give this film the added emotional value.  Paddy Considine's role as the family father, which was highly underrated, also plays a crutial part in the film's quality.

Whereas other films may have had more technical attributes(""The Return of the King"") or star-power driven(""Mystic River"") or inexplicably critically acclaimed(the crappy ""Lost in Translation), this film had the best story and the best ensemble acting.

The five principle actors in this film are all uniformly excellent.  Samantha Morton was justifiably nominated for an Oscar as the mother and wife trying to hold together her family through harsh economic and emotional times while subordinating her own needs.  Djimon Hounsou is excellent as the bitter dying artist who takes a chance by allowing this family to enter into his life.  Paddy Considine's performance is probably the most overlooked because he plays a man who struggles to provide for his family financially but internalizes his personal pain.

My thoughts couldn't be any further from the truth - for what I saw instead, was a some hour and forty minutes of sheer boredom and falsities of this great country we call America. I kept expecting our ""heroes"" to pull out of their bastion of poverty, but what I saw instead, was a poorly conceived display of what has to be the most schizoid pretense of acting on the planet. In addition, ""In America"" is chock-full of ethnic and social stereotypes, to which there are many. This film portrays people of African descent in a negative light, in that it treats them as raving, cannabalistic maniacs, and that's just scratching the surface of this heavily flawed cinematic bombast. It also sees the U.S. as a lazy, unintelligent nation, and also fails to view the positive, humanistic side of our great nation, of which there are numerous facets. Director/writer Jim Sheridan failed to do his homework, therefore missing out in capturing the true American spirit. Also, Sheridan didn't do his own nationalists any favors, either, by insulting this particular Irish family by sticking them in an urbanized New York City ghetto, let alone leaving the children alone with a helpless mother with very little income. Seeing this family's struggle, I couldn't help but sit through the movie, thinking ""Is this family stupid, or what?"". Better yet, ""Were Jim Sheridan and his relatives sniffing toxic fumes (particularly from the chipped paint of the run-down apartment complex) when they concocted the idea for ""In America""'s storyline?"". Besides the vocal venom spewed by its two main stars, Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton throughout this horrible display of a sad plot and shoddy dramatics, the Sheridans need to burn the master reel, and kiss the famed Blarney Stone, before they return to this country to make another motion picture. Gaining furher undertanding of U.S. culture and customs would advance their cause as well, including a case study of our child labor and care laws in addition. To avoid futher cultural shock and disappointment, I would advise against seeing this indigestible piece of cinematic monstrosity, whether it be here ""In America"", or anywhere else, regardless.

There are moving moments, but overall, the film felt mechanistic and poorly realized, and the acting was only so-so.  I was charmed by Emma Bolger, the little girl who played his youngest daughter, and to a lesser extent by her sister, Sarah Bolger, who was a little on the precious side.  The adult actors were uniformly unimpressive -- Samantha Morton's character never really takes shape or emerges emotionally; male lead Paddy Considine has some interesting qualities, but consistently overacts his parts, and African actor Djimon Hounsou intones portentiously, in a rather bland and too-easy manner.  I just didn't feel like I was seeing much subtlety onscreen, and while the film has some appeal, it never really moved me.  Maybe that's only because I'm such a heartless bastard.

604127,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JLR8,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","For all its surface grittiness, this 2002 movie feels very much like a beatific fable, which I'm sure is the intention of ""My Left Foot"" director Jim Sheridan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten, based on his own life.  In fact, the movie's title doesn't feel literal but more allegorical, as America becomes a symbol for all the opportunities that have evaporated elsewhere in the world. The plot focuses on Johnny and Sarah, who along with their two young daughters, Christy and Ariel, have arrived in the United States in the early eighties from Ireland via Canada. After a dodgy border crossing, they end up in a large tenement apartment in Hell's Kitchen. We find out that they just lost a son and that the whole purpose of their moving is for Johnny to fulfill his dream of being an actor. Given their suddenly hardscrabble existence in New York, it does seem rather idealistic that he would not face any repercussion from his wife for choosing such an unstable profession. However, uplift seems to be Sheridan's agenda here, and luckily, the wondrous Samantha Morton plays Sarah with such honest conviction that the situation doesn't seem remotely contrived.There are the inevitable setbacks along the way, in particular, dwindling finances, a risky pregnancy, catastrophic hospital expenses and a crisis in faith. But random acts of kindness and sheer luck get the family through the darker passages of their existence, whether it is going to see the movie E.T. at the local air-conditioned theater when their own air conditioner breaks down, or Johnny vying for a much-sought-after E.T. doll at the arcade (a thrilling scene), or the girls meeting an unsuspecting savior in the form of an initially angry artist neighbor named Mateo. Secretly dying of AIDS, Mateo becomes an angelic figure to the family, and even though Djimon Hounsou is alternately striking and touching in the role, his dramatic transformation from anger to unmitigated joy feels much more like a plot device than an authentic change. It certainly doesn't help to have a saccharine scene of him making angels in the snow with the girls. But such lapses in credibility are forgivable given how Sheridan has otherwise created many small poignant moments that give the film a realistic edge making the immigrant experience come vitally alive. He also has the good sense to cast two wonderfully unaffected children as the girls - 11-year old Sarah Bolger plays the serious-minded Christy with her red camcorder, while seven-year old Emma Bolger is a bundle of sparkling energy as the sunny Ariel. Sarah Bolger, in particular, provides some of the most emotionally true moments in the film, whether plaintively singing ""Desperado"" at the school pageant or admitting that no one seems to recognize she lost something precious when her brother died. As Johnny, Paddy Considine bounces off the other actors effectively, but he remains the most cryptic in motive since his passion for acting is never really articulated with respect to his family. Relatively minor flaws aside, Sheridan has made an ultimately heartwarming film that perfectly captures family dynamics in a strange land.",4,Family Thrives in a Strange New Place Through Kind Acts,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3191,"['surface', 'grittiness', '2002', 'movie', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'beatific', 'fable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'intention', 'Left', 'Foot', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'two', 'daughters', 'Naomi', 'Kirsten', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'fact', 'movie', 'title', ""n't"", 'feel', 'literal', 'more', 'allegorical', 'America', 'symbol', 'opportunities', 'have', 'evaporated', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'plot', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'who', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'have', 'arrived', 'United', 'States', 'early', 'eighties', 'Ireland', 'Canada', 'dodgy', 'border', 'crossing', 'end', 'up', 'large', 'tenement', 'apartment', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'lost', 'son', 'whole', 'purpose', 'moving', 'Johnny', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'being', 'actor', 'Given', 'suddenly', 'hardscrabble', 'existence', 'New', 'York', 'seem', 'rather', 'idealistic', 'would', 'not', 'face', 'repercussion', 'wife', 'choosing', 'unstable', 'profession', 'However', 'uplift', 'be', 'Sheridan', 'agenda', 'here', 'luckily', 'wondrous', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Sarah', 'such', 'honest', 'conviction', 'situation', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remotely', 'are', 'inevitable', 'setbacks', 'way', 'particular', 'dwindling', 'finances', 'risky', 'pregnancy', 'catastrophic', 'hospital', 'expenses', 'crisis', 'faith', 'random', 'acts', 'kindness', 'sheer', 'luck', 'get', 'family', 'darker', 'passages', 'existence', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'E.T', 'local', 'air-conditioned', 'theater', 'when', 'own', 'air', 'conditioner', 'breaks', 'down', 'Johnny', 'vying', 'much-sought-after', 'E.T', 'doll', 'arcade', 'thrilling', 'scene', 'girls', 'meeting', 'unsuspecting', 'savior', 'form', 'initially', 'angry', 'artist', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Mateo', 'Secretly', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'Mateo', 'angelic', 'figure', 'family', 'even', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'alternately', 'striking', 'touching', 'role', 'dramatic', 'transformation', 'anger', 'unmitigated', 'joy', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'authentic', 'change', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'saccharine', 'scene', 'making', 'angels', 'snow', 'girls', 'such', 'lapses', 'credibility', 'are', 'forgivable', 'given', 'how', 'Sheridan', 'otherwise', 'created', 'many', 'small', 'poignant', 'moments', 'give', 'film', 'realistic', 'edge', 'making', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'come', 'vitally', 'alive', 'also', 'good', 'sense', 'cast', 'two', 'wonderfully', 'unaffected', 'children', 'girls', '11-year', 'old', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'serious-minded', 'Christy', 'red', 'camcorder', 'seven-year', 'old', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'bundle', 'sparkling', 'energy', 'sunny', 'Ariel', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'particular', 'most', 'emotionally', 'true', 'moments', 'film', 'plaintively', 'singing', 'Desperado', 'school', 'pageant', 'admitting', 'one', 'recognize', 'lost', 'something', 'precious', 'when', 'brother', 'died', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'other', 'actors', 'effectively', 'most', 'cryptic', 'motive', 'passion', 'acting', 'never', 'really', 'articulated', 'respect', 'family', 'Relatively', 'minor', 'flaws', 'aside', 'Sheridan', 'made', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'perfectly', 'family', 'dynamics', 'strange', 'land']",In America

Based on autobiographical material this screenplay was written by Jim Sheridan (who also directs with great sensitivity) and his two daughters.  The story is that of an Irish family - a man and wife and thier two daughters - who swallow their recent loss of their only son and emigrate from Canada to America.  The story is related through the tender eyes of the older daughter, who in the manner Irish holds three wishes bestowed by her brother's death.  How she uses those wishes in the Americanization of the Sullivan family forms the story line.  Against all the odds that so often impale immigrants to this country - inability to find decent housing, work, friends etc - this warm family's plight is magnified by the fact that they must learn to exist in a sleazy tenement building.  Father is a wannabe actor who ends up driving a cab at night, the girls struggle with the new way of language and living, and the mother longs for another pregnancy to help fill the void of her lost child.  They are befriended (mutually) by an African artist who lives below them and who eventually becomes a significant part of their extended family.  To tell more would be unfair, as it is the tragedy and how it turns that makes the movie glow.Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine as the parents are as fine as actors can get. The daughters are played with impeccable grace and skill by Sarah and Emma Bolger, and Mateo (their new fried) is the creation of the beautiful actor Djimon Hounsou who shines in this pivotal role.  This story is related with underplayed sensitivity and heartwarming tenderness.  Rarely has a film found an audience that is almost uniformly moved to quiet tears during the credits.

From the very beginning, where the Irish family crosses the Canadian border into the US, pretending to be ""on holidays"" but really coming to work-- the movie is instead a blend of cheerful family comedy and buried grief.  It's a combination hard to describe but I can say this is EXACTLY the film to watch if you're struggling with tough times because it will make you smile and ALSO give you some perspective, without beating you up about it... (what many people including me got for example from ""The Full Monty."")This family is so gentle and loving to each other without ever being treacly.  This is NOT the hard-drinking, disappointed, passionate Irishman-- the dad is an actor and it's quickly clear that he's a GOOD actor, though he has trouble finding and keeping work.  But he's a father and husband first, devoted to his family, and struggling with the recent death of son Frankie.  Christy takes everything in on her camcorder, and precociously ""rescues"" the family with three wishes she uses judiciously through the course of the movie.  Mom, luminously played by Samantha Morton, is radiant, loyal and supportive.  And little Emma Bolger, who plays young Ariel, practically steals the show with her ""mad moppet"" (according to director Jim Sheridan) energy, charm and joy.Yet there's a truthfulness to everything that rescues the family from the saccharine sweetness of a situation comedy-- though much of the comedy is from ""fish out of water"" situation; little Ariel's thinking the Stars Spangled Banner is about ""Jose,"" the girls standing for hours in a shower to cool off on a humid New York day...there's also an unexpected development with ""the screaming man"" who turns out to be an African artist who lives in an apartment below theirs (they live in an old, somewhat run-down building that looks to be in Washigton Heights or Harlem).This is a movie about redemption, love, and overcoming grief while sustaining the bonds that are family-- but rent it because it's FUN, and don't be put off by the heavy themes.  They may be heavy but they are handled with a light touch, and the people in this movie have so much charm you want to take them home.I liked the movie so much I immediately watched it again with the commentary and Jim Sheridan was delightful-- though repetitive once in a while he was also hilarious, rather humble and enlightening-- the movie is based on a true story, his own, with some changes of course-- it was his brother that died, when he was little, and not, as in the film, his son, just before coming to America.  And to keep the movie from being too heavy, he changed the narration to one of his daughters.  It all works gloriously, and his descriptions of some of the things that happened in auditions or while shooting are memorable.On another note, this is a GREAT movie for New Yorkers, past, present and future.  Could anything be more magical than the family's initial joy when they see Times Square with all its dazzle and light?Highly recommended. I may have to buy it!",5,"Buoyant and funny!

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[9, 10]","Jim Sheridan's &quot;In America&quot; is an autobiographical piece which he claims is his most honest and personal film to date. Although it is no &quot;My Left Foot,&quot; it can certainly hold its own with his other movies, &quot;In The Name Of The Father,&quot; &quot;The Boxer,&quot; and &quot;The Field.&quot; &quot;In America&quot; moved me deeply. I found it to be uplifting - a breath of fresh air. Sheridan and his two daughters wrote the script.The film opens with the young Irish Sullivan family, Sarah, (Samantha Morton), Johnny, (Paddy Considine) and their two small daughters, Christy and Ariel, (played by real life sisters Emma and Sarah Bolger), attempting to cross the border and enter the United States. After chatty Ariel supplies the information that Dad is out of work and they have no money, the border official scrutinizes them closely. The family is grieving over the loss of Frankie, their third child, who recently died of a brain tumor. The film centers on their tragic loss. Christy talks to her brother every night and believes he has promised her three magic wishes - &quot;but only three, so be careful what you wish for.&quot; He guarantees, from Heaven, they will come true. The little girl gets them across the border with her first wish.The Sullivans have moved to New York to start anew after the boy's death, and also so Johnny can have a serious acting career. They move into a building, in a dilapidated neighborhood. The apartment looks as if it had been condemned 10 years before. Sarah cleans and decorates with scraps and findings until the place is cheery - almost magical. The two girls make it even more so. Drug addicts, transvestites, thieves and the working poor, of all races and creeds, are their neighbors. Unlike more savvy New Yorkers, this Irish family seems to be totally unaware of the potential dangers of their surrounding. Their openness, friendliness and lack of suspicion attract those who meet them, and all four easily make an odd assortment of new friends. One, in particular, is an angry, reclusive black artist, (Djimon Hounsou gives an extraordinarily strong performance), who is often heard shouting in rage. Almost destitute, Sarah, a teacher back in Ireland, is forced to take a job as a waitress. Johnny drives a cab when not auditioning. Looming over them all is the absence of Frankie and their grief is, at times, palpable.This family's journey to come to grips with their loss while searching for meaning in a new world is enriching and beautiful. There are moments of humor and tenderness that are expressed in a totally unique and emotionally honest way. Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine give remarkable performances, and Sarah and Emma Bolger are as natural, innocent and precocious as can be. Christy is wise beyond her years. As she says at one point, she feels like she carries the family on her shoulders. Master storyteller Sheridan had the courage to bare his heart in this emotionally raw film.

There's only one: Jim Sheridan, who directed ""My Left Foot"" in 1989. Brenda Fricker won an Oscar for Best Actress. Daniel Day-Lewis was named Best Actor. And Jim Sheridan established himself as a director who could plumb deep emotion without wallowing in it.Two more films, four more Oscar nominations --- clearly, Sheridan has a way with actors. And then, in 2003, he co-authored and directed ""In America,"" starring Paddy Considine, Samantha Morton, Djimon Honsou (who went on to co-star in ""Blood Diamond"") and two sisters, 12-year-old Sarah Bolger and 8-year-old Emma. Morton was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy. Honsou was a nominee for Best Supporting Actor. The Bolger sisters were robbed.But then, so was ""In America,"" which has embedded itself in my memory as one of the wisest, most affecting films I've ever seen. I just watched it again. On second viewing, it's just as powerful.I suspect this is, in part, because ""In America"" is the kind of story that the Irish do best. There's plenty of painful, gritty realism --- there's also a rich stream of magic. They merge at the start of the film. The strands never separate.It works like this: Johnny Sullivan, his wife Sarah and their daughters sit in their old station wagon at the Canadian border, waiting to be admitted to the United States as ""tourists."" In fact, this Irish actor and his family plan to be illegal aliens in New York City. Johnny presents his documents....Immigration Officer: How many children do you have?Johnny: Three.Sarah: Two.Johnny: Two.Immigration Officer: Says three here.Johnny: We lost one.That lost child is Frankie, recently dead at 5. His legacy is grief --- grief like a lead blanket, grief so heavy there's no point talking about it because everyone feels it and no one knows what to do about it. Christy, the older daughter, has been ""talking"" to Frankie every night and believes that he has given her three wishes. Seeing that this moment could go either way, she uses one: Please let us into America....In New York, the Sullivans find an apartment in a druggie-infested slum. The girls like America. But Johnny is stymied in the land of opportunity --- his auditions are flat, he can't get a part, he becomes one of that army of actors who drives a cab. More stress: Sarah gets pregnant and learns that the baby could endanger her health. And the kids have befriended Mateo, a neighbor --- a fierce, hostile African artist who, unknown to them, is dying of AIDS.You watch all this, mouth open, as if you are watching a documentary. Credit the writing and, equally, the performances: Samantha Morton is all eyes and hope.  Paddy Considine is a tormented block of ice. And the girls --- well, here's Jim Sheridan recalling how he cast them:There was an open audition and Emma was the very first girl. I got Emma to read, and I thought she was a bit too good, so I went to get another girl, and Emma pulled my coat really hard, and I looked 'round and she just looked at me with pity, as if I'd crossed the line of etiquette, and she said, ""Is she reading my part?"" I waited and looked in her eyes, and she didn't back down, so I said, ""No, Emma, nobody's reading your part. She said, ""Good, my sister's in the car."" I said, ""What age?"" She said, ""10,"" but I thought that was too young. She said, ""Well, see her anyway."" And I went down and cast her after three minutes. So that was the first two kids out of 300 --- I never saw any others.There are scenes in this movie that will haunt you all your days. At a street fair, John bets every dollar they have in order to win an ET doll for the kids....Sarah, wild-eyed, briefly loses her mind in the maternity ward....Christy sings ""Desperado"" at a school talent show....Johnny confesses to Mateo, ""I asked God a favor --- take me instead of him. And he took the both of us."" And then there is a line that was, for me, the killer: Christy announcing, ""Don't `little girl' me --- I've been carrying this family on my back for more than a year.""Oh, the wisdom of kids. These girls find the words than no one else can say. They form the friendships that lead the family back to life. You can see some kind of happy ending coming, but you absolutely can't see how --- and then Christy uses her third and final wish.When I saw ""In America"" in a theater, people all around us were blubbering at that wish; how simple it was, and how hard. Christy's words to her father cut deep, but they cut with such love. And then there are words --- three words, and you'll never guess them --- that Johnny has to say.The catharsis, when it comes, is glorious. There's a second one, a printed line at the start of the credits --- the dedication of the film ""to the memory of my brother, Frankie."" A little research reveals that Jim Sheridan was 17 when his younger brother died. But the ages don't matter, only the emotions. And there is no director on this planet who handles emotional truth better than Jim Sheridan.As you will see in those moments when your tears don't blur the screen.",5,"Do you believe in magic?

604145,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00005JLR8,J. Michael Click,"[0, 0]","Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  DVD Extras: *****A sensitive script, intelligent direction, and phenomenal performances are the highlights of ""In America"".  The story centers around an Irish family - weighed down by unresolved tragedy - who illegally immigrates to America with very little going for them except their hopes for a better future.  They settle into a decrepit building in the brutal Hell's Kitchen area of New York City where their lives become entwined with one of their neighbors, a dying artist who has already discovered within himself some of the healing they are seeking in their own lives.Such material might easily become maudlin in the wrong hands, but co-writer and director Jim Sheridan (who based the story on incidents from his own life) keeps a tight and tasteful rein on the tale as it unfolds, never letting it drift into inappropriate sentimentality.  Proof of his skill is to be found in the Original Ending, which is included among the selection of deleted scenes.  The original ending was marred by a certain lack of emotional restraint; the revised scene is much more reserved, more in keeping with the mood of the film as a whole ... and infinitely more satisfying.Sheridan's achievements with the pen and behind the camera are enhanced by a quintet of remarkable performances.  Oscar nominees Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou are flawless in bringing to life the characters of the mother and the ailing neighbor ... but in truth, Paddy Considine as the father and real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are just as perfect in their respective roles as the father and the two young daughters.  ""In America"" is truly an ensemble acting piece, and Sheridan's casting director could not have done a better job. This an unusually honest, provocative and touching film that deserves the widest possible audience.  ""In America"" is a true winner.",5,"Loving ...

Half way through IN AMERICA, the appendage began to twitch. By the film's end, it was positively hyperactive. Perhaps it was because my expectations were so high.IN AMERICA begins as an Irish immigrant family - father Johnny (Paddy Considine), mother Sarah (Samantha Morton), daughters Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) - con their way through U.S. Immigration at the Canadian border. Ostensibly just on vacation, their true intent is to take up illegal residence in New York City. Johnny hopes for an acting gig, but ends up driving a cab between unsuccessful auditions. Sarah, a teacher, must settle for waiting on tables. Home is a derelict, drug and addict-infested apartment building which seems not to perturb in the slightest any member of the family, especially the two girls, who seem positively thrilled to be there. (The viewer might be forgiven for wondering how bad life was back in Ireland if this dump was acceptable. The question is never answered.) Downstairs lives the &quot;man whom screams&quot;, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an enraged Nigerian painter who's emblazoned &quot;Keep Away&quot; on the outside of his apartment door. As it turns out, Mateo is dying of an unspecified disease (though the script suggested to me that it was AIDS). In the meantime, Sarah becomes pregnant. Her doctor says that if she goes to term, either her life or that of the child may be endangered - again, for unspecified reasons.Sarah and Johnny previously had a third child, an infant son named Frankie, who'd died back in the Old Country after 1) taking a tumble down the stairs, and 2) developing a fatal brain tumor. Both Johnny and Sarah are wracked with guilt. In the ending credits, the film is dedicated to a real-life Frankie, who, as I understand it, was director/writer Jim Sheridan's brother and who died at 10 years of age. I think perhaps this connection, overt or otherwise, caused Sheridan to over-sentimentalize the script.At one point, the two girls go trick-or-treating on their first Halloween, and go door to door in their squalid tenement. After relentlessly pounding on Mateo's door, he opens up fit to kill. But he's immediately tamed by the girls' incorrigible sweetness and spends the rest of his screen time eating out of their hands, so to speak. The whole thing seemed too corny, and it was about then that my foot began to fidget.  Finally, toward the film's conclusion, the improbable treatment protocol of a case of apparent RH-Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn - contrived solely for maudlin effect - caused me, after thirty years' experience in blood banking, to roll my eyes and send my abused foot into overdrive.All movies manipulate the audience, but IN AMERICA went over the top, in my opinion. I've seen it touted in respectable rags as &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;. Puhleeze! Compared to such outstanding pictures as THE HUMAN STAIN, MASTER &amp; COMMANDER, MYSTIC RIVER, BARBARIAN INVASIONS, SEABISCUIT, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, VERONICA GUERIN and perhaps a couple of others I've yet to see, IN AMERICA isn't even close.Four stars is too much, three too little. 3.5 is just right for something too schmaltzy for my curmudgeonly sensitivities despite some fine acting performances, particularly those of Morton and Considine.",4,Makes slumming relatively warm and fuzzy,1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,3437,"['degree', 'discomfiture', 'film', 'indicated', 'amount', 'movement', 'foot', 'end', 'leg', 'crossed', 'other', 'knee', 'way', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'appendage', 'began', 'twitch', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'positively', 'hyperactive', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'high.IN', 'AMERICA', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'family', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'Ariel', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'con', 'way', 'U.S.', 'Immigration', 'Canadian', 'border', 'Ostensibly', 'just', 'vacation', 'true', 'intent', 'take', 'up', 'illegal', 'residence', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Johnny', 'acting', 'gig', 'up', 'driving', 'cab', 'unsuccessful', 'auditions', 'Sarah', 'teacher', 'must', 'settle', 'waiting', 'tables', 'Home', 'derelict', 'drug', 'addict-infested', 'apartment', 'building', 'not', 'perturb', 'slightest', 'member', 'family', 'especially', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'seem', 'positively', 'thrilled', 'be', 'there', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'forgiven', 'wondering', 'how', 'bad', 'life', 'was', 'back', 'Ireland', 'dump', 'was', 'acceptable', 'question', 'never', 'answered', 'quot', 'man', 'whom', 'quot', 'Mateo', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'enraged', 'Nigerian', 'painter', 'who', 'emblazoned', 'quot', 'Keep', 'Away', 'quot', 'outside', 'apartment', 'door', 'out', 'Mateo', 'dying', 'unspecified', 'disease', 'script', 'suggested', 'was', 'AIDS', 'meantime', 'Sarah', 'pregnant', 'doctor', 'term', 'life', 'child', 'may', 'be', 'endangered', 'again', 'unspecified', 'reasons.Sarah', 'Johnny', 'previously', 'had', 'third', 'child', 'infant', 'son', 'named', 'Frankie', 'who', ""'d"", 'died', 'back', 'Old', 'Country', '1', 'taking', 'tumble', 'down', 'stairs', '2', 'developing', 'fatal', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'are', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'ending', 'credits', 'film', 'dedicated', 'real-life', 'Frankie', 'who', 'understand', 'was', 'director/writer', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'brother', 'who', 'died', '10', 'years', 'age', 'think', 'perhaps', 'connection', 'overt', 'otherwise', 'caused', 'Sheridan', 'over-sentimentalize', 'script.At', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'girls', 'go', 'trick-or-treating', 'first', 'Halloween', 'go', 'door', 'door', 'squalid', 'tenement', 'relentlessly', 'pounding', 'Mateo', 'door', 'up', 'fit', 'kill', 'immediately', 'tamed', 'girls', 'incorrigible', 'sweetness', 'rest', 'screen', 'time', 'eating', 'hands', 'so', 'speak', 'whole', 'thing', 'seemed', 'too', 'corny', 'was', 'about', 'then', 'foot', 'began', 'fidget', 'Finally', 'film', 'conclusion', 'improbable', 'treatment', 'protocol', 'case', 'apparent', 'RH-Hemolytic', 'Disease', 'Newborn', 'contrived', 'solely', 'maudlin', 'effect', 'caused', 'thirty', 'years', 'experience', 'blood', 'banking', 'roll', 'eyes', 'send', 'abused', 'foot', 'overdrive.All', 'movies', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'went', 'top', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'touted', 'respectable', 'rags', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'quot', 'Puhleeze', 'Compared', 'such', 'outstanding', 'pictures', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'MASTER', 'amp', 'COMMANDER', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'BARBARIAN', 'INVASIONS', 'SEABISCUIT', 'GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'VERONICA', 'GUERIN', 'perhaps', 'couple', 'others', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'IN', 'AMERICA', ""n't"", 'even', 'close.Four', 'stars', 'too', 'much', 'three', 'too', 'little', '3.5', 'just', 'right', 'something', 'too', 'schmaltzy', 'curmudgeonly', 'sensitivities', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Morton', 'Considine']",In America

This is what we've come to independent films for since the studios began producing nothing but schlock.  This is a GOOD movie.It tells the true story of director Jim Sheridan and his family - how they came to America to live in the slums of Manhattan after the death of their little boy.  Things are tough for them at the beginning, but this movie is not so much about the sadness they experience as it is about the simple joys of making a shower work or getting an air conditioner.It's good to watch this movie at this period in history, when America is in trouble and everybody seems to hate us.  Sheridan doesn't sugar-coat the story - they don't get to America and everything magically falls into place.  However, there is a certain magic about America and the Sheridan family finds it.Some of the magic comes from the character of Mateo, wonderfully played by Amistad's Djimon Hounsou.  He's an eccentric artist who lives downstairs and befriends the family.  In America is great because it is primarily seen through the eyes of the little girl, Christy (Sarah Bolger was nominated for an Oscar for this performance).

604152,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,B00005JLR8,Kelvin H.,"[5, 5]","""In America"" does not only concern about the hardship of a family that crossed half the world to settle in a foreign land seeking a more prosperous future, but it also touches on how its remoteness is coped with. ""In America"" reveals the amount of sacrifice and amount of courage it is needed to relinquish the past in order to fare on to the future. Directed by Jim Sheridan and written by him along with his two daughters Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, ""In America"" is a spellbinding look into the life of a family who discovers more of who they are in an extrinsic territory.One of the main reasons ""In America"" is so endearing is because of this phenomenal cast. Paddy Considine is able to portray a man deep in affliction but is able to summon up a cheerful face for the children. Samantha Morton, who received an Academy Award nomination, is extremely suggestive through her countenance alone. Real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are ever delightful. Besides being there to tug at our hearts, there are instances where it reveals their significant talent. Consider when Christy snaps at her dad, ""Don't `little girl' me. I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year ever since Frankie died."" This easily could have failed and be comical, but Sarah Bolger manages to deliver it in such an honest and convincing fashion. Emma Bolger's moment comes in the ice cream parlor where she says she has no friends and no one to ""tell secrets too."" This scene may appear effortless but that's because Emma Bolger seems authentically saddened with her character.Djimon Hounsou, who was first introduced by Steven Spielberg as the slave Cinque in ""Amistad"" and has played similar characters after that, delivers his best performance as Mateo. We have seen him numerous times before as oppressed men with tough skin that are perspicuous. As Mateo, this finally allows Hounsou to reveal not only his softer side but also exhibit his range. Hounsou gives quite a well-rounded performance where he can be both intimidating and amiable, and forceful yet yielding. He received an Academy Awards nomination and it could have been a serious contender had it been taken place in another year.-Please continue my review at [...]",5,Sheridan's Most Personal Masterpiece,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,2225,"['America', 'not', 'only', 'concern', 'hardship', 'family', 'crossed', 'world', 'settle', 'foreign', 'land', 'seeking', 'more', 'prosperous', 'future', 'also', 'how', 'remoteness', 'coped', 'America', 'amount', 'sacrifice', 'amount', 'courage', 'needed', 'relinquish', 'past', 'order', 'fare', 'future', 'Directed', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'written', 'along', 'two', 'daughters', 'Naomi', 'Kirsten', 'Sheridan', 'America', 'spellbinding', 'look', 'life', 'family', 'who', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'extrinsic', 'territory.One', 'main', 'reasons', 'America', 'so', 'endearing', 'phenomenal', 'cast', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'able', 'portray', 'man', 'deep', 'affliction', 'able', 'summon', 'up', 'cheerful', 'face', 'children', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'who', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'extremely', 'suggestive', 'countenance', 'alone', 'Real', 'life', 'sisters', 'Sarah', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'are', 'ever', 'delightful', 'being', 'there', 'tug', 'hearts', 'are', 'instances', 'where', 'significant', 'talent', 'Consider', 'when', 'Christy', 'dad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'little', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'been', 'carrying', 'family', 'back', 'year', 'ever', 'Frankie', 'died', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'failed', 'be', 'comical', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'deliver', 'such', 'honest', 'convincing', 'fashion', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'moment', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'where', 'friends', 'one', 'tell', 'secrets', 'too', 'scene', 'may', 'appear', 'effortless', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'authentically', 'saddened', 'character.Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'slave', 'Cinque', 'Amistad', 'played', 'similar', 'characters', 'best', 'performance', 'Mateo', 'have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'times', 'oppressed', 'men', 'tough', 'skin', 'are', 'perspicuous', 'Mateo', 'finally', 'Hounsou', 'reveal', 'not', 'only', 'softer', 'side', 'also', 'exhibit', 'range', 'Hounsou', 'quite', 'well-rounded', 'performance', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'intimidating', 'amiable', 'forceful', 'yet', 'yielding', 'received', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'nomination', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'contender', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'place', 'year.-Please', 'continue', 'review', '[', ']']",In America
604153,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JLR8,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 7]","In America opens with a short excerpt where Christy (Sarah Bolger) is quoting her late brother Frankie while the audience can see a short scene from a home video on a digital camcorder as her Irish family is leaving a painful past behind them as they venture to United States through Canada in a beat down car in the hope of a better life.  The road leads them to the Big Apple where the father, Johnny (Paddy Considine), can pursue his dreams of becoming a successful actor on Broadway.  However, things do not go as planned as the family members face poverty, a heat wave, and the mother, Sarah (Samantha Morton) cannot get a job as a teacher due to their illegal immigrant status.  Instead, Sarah takes a job at an ice cream parlor in order for Johnny to get his acting career started, but it seems as if Johnny's artistic career never will materialize.  All of this is in the perspective of the daughter Christy's eyes and the lens of her small digital camcorder.Christy and Ariel, the two daughters, make the best of the situation as they live in a crack house with constant danger surrounding them.  However, the danger never seems to bother the girls, which supports the notion of children's resilience to environment.  On the other hand it is obvious that the children are affected by their atmosphere, for example, they are faced with a staring silence as they enter their rich Catholic school on Halloween with their home-made costumes.  Nonetheless, the children want to go trick-or-treating, which can be difficult if one lives in a crack house.  The two girls knock on every door in the apartment complex, but no one opens until they get to the door that has the words, Keep Away, painted in white.  Christy and Ariel are aware that the man living behind the door has rightfully so acquired the nickname ""the man who screams.""The man who screams, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), is an anguished Nigerian painter that has locked himself away in order to deal with his pain and suffering in solitude.  When Christy and Ariel knock on the door Mateo's screams turns into a feeble smile as the girls want to trick-or-treat him.  The girls innocent trick-or-treating seems to open an internal door into Mateo's soul, which allows him to feel the warmth, kindness, and love.  The girl's innocent kindness brings out kindness from Mateo and as a result Sarah invites him for a meal.  This leads Mateo and the family together in reciprocal friendship where their true feelings will be shared, which will end in personal growth for each family member.Jim Sheridan's story is based on a script that he and his sisters Naomi Sheridan and Kirsten Sheridan have written together in memory of their late brother who past away during childhood.  It is evident that the death has affected the Sheridan's as they deliver a complex and emotional tale of closure.  However, the Sheridan's do not focus on death, as they bring attention to life and its many difficulties.  Jim Sheridan depicts these difficulties through several small subplots such as Johnny's struggle to get an air conditioner into the apartment, which demands a lot of physical strength, humility, and patience.Jim Sheridan plays with spiritual values throughout the film through many different ways as he portrays life and death.  One of the scenes that brings strong spiritual symbolism to the film is when Christy and Ariel dress up for Halloween.  Ariel dresses as an angel, which symbolizes Christianity and a monotheistic religion, while Christy turns into a faun representing a pagan belief, which represents a polytheistic religion.  The girls are not necessary pagans or Christians, but it becomes an analogy to how differently they deal with the death of their brother.  This spiritual web covers In America from the beginning to the end, as the family never discusses what happened to Frankie, which leaves the family in some sort of emotional twilight as they go on with life.In America tackles several issues in a sincere manner, which amplifies the cinematic experience.  For example, the addition of the clips from the digital camcorder offer a genuine affection that enhances the emotional difficulties of the family.  The closure of the film offers much contemplation in the backdrop of life and the continuum of life, which will bring the audience to tears.",5,The Distant Closeness of a Painful Memory - Brilliant!!!,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,4330,"['America', 'short', 'excerpt', 'where', 'Christy', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'quoting', 'late', 'brother', 'Frankie', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'short', 'scene', 'home', 'video', 'digital', 'camcorder', 'Irish', 'family', 'leaving', 'painful', 'past', 'behind', 'venture', 'United', 'States', 'Canada', 'beat', 'down', 'car', 'hope', 'better', 'life', 'road', 'Big', 'Apple', 'where', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'can', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'successful', 'actor', 'Broadway', 'However', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'family', 'members', 'face', 'poverty', 'heat', 'wave', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'teacher', 'due', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'status', 'Instead', 'Sarah', 'job', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'order', 'Johnny', 'get', 'acting', 'career', 'started', 'Johnny', 'artistic', 'career', 'never', 'will', 'materialize', 'perspective', 'daughter', 'Christy', 'eyes', 'lens', 'small', 'digital', 'camcorder.Christy', 'Ariel', 'two', 'daughters', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'live', 'crack', 'house', 'constant', 'danger', 'surrounding', 'However', 'danger', 'never', 'bother', 'girls', 'notion', 'children', 'resilience', 'environment', 'other', 'hand', 'obvious', 'children', 'are', 'affected', 'atmosphere', 'example', 'are', 'faced', 'staring', 'silence', 'enter', 'rich', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Halloween', 'home-made', 'costumes', 'Nonetheless', 'children', 'want', 'go', 'trick-or-treating', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'one', 'crack', 'house', 'two', 'girls', 'knock', 'door', 'apartment', 'complex', 'one', 'get', 'door', 'words', 'Keep', 'Away', 'painted', 'white', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'are', 'aware', 'man', 'living', 'door', 'rightfully', 'so', 'acquired', 'nickname', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'Mateo', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'anguished', 'Nigerian', 'painter', 'locked', 'away', 'order', 'deal', 'pain', 'suffering', 'solitude', 'When', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'knock', 'door', 'Mateo', 'screams', 'feeble', 'smile', 'girls', 'want', 'trick-or-treat', 'girls', 'innocent', 'trick-or-treating', 'open', 'internal', 'door', 'Mateo', 'soul', 'feel', 'warmth', 'kindness', 'love', 'girl', 'innocent', 'kindness', 'out', 'kindness', 'Mateo', 'result', 'Sarah', 'meal', 'Mateo', 'family', 'together', 'reciprocal', 'friendship', 'where', 'true', 'feelings', 'will', 'be', 'shared', 'will', 'end', 'personal', 'growth', 'family', 'Sheridan', 'story', 'based', 'script', 'sisters', 'Naomi', 'Sheridan', 'Kirsten', 'Sheridan', 'have', 'written', 'together', 'memory', 'late', 'brother', 'who', 'away', 'childhood', 'evident', 'death', 'affected', 'Sheridan', 'deliver', 'complex', 'emotional', 'tale', 'closure', 'However', 'Sheridan', 'do', 'not', 'focus', 'death', 'bring', 'attention', 'life', 'many', 'difficulties', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'difficulties', 'several', 'small', 'subplots', 'such', 'Johnny', 'struggle', 'get', 'air', 'conditioner', 'apartment', 'lot', 'physical', 'strength', 'humility', 'patience.Jim', 'Sheridan', 'spiritual', 'values', 'film', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'life', 'death', 'One', 'scenes', 'strong', 'spiritual', 'symbolism', 'film', 'when', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'dress', 'up', 'Halloween', 'Ariel', 'angel', 'Christianity', 'monotheistic', 'religion', 'Christy', 'faun', 'representing', 'pagan', 'belief', 'polytheistic', 'religion', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'pagans', 'Christians', 'analogy', 'how', 'differently', 'deal', 'death', 'brother', 'spiritual', 'web', 'America', 'beginning', 'end', 'family', 'never', 'what', 'happened', 'Frankie', 'family', 'sort', 'emotional', 'twilight', 'go', 'life.In', 'America', 'several', 'issues', 'sincere', 'manner', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'example', 'addition', 'clips', 'digital', 'camcorder', 'offer', 'genuine', 'affection', 'emotional', 'difficulties', 'family', 'closure', 'film', 'offers', 'much', 'contemplation', 'backdrop', 'life', 'continuum', 'life', 'will', 'bring', 'audience', 'tears']",In America

Lately I have been disappointed with the movies hollywood puts forth the ones that are made for the sole purpose of money- not actually wanting to make you think or feel anything special. After, seeing ""In America"" I was moved. Breath-taking or heart-breaking are not the words that I would use to describe this rare movie.After I finished watching it I felt deeply touched by the story of the Irish family who finds peace in the States. This movie has stuck to me since, I've seen it and I guarntee it will with you too. Jim Sheridan has written and directed a master-piece that we rarely see these days- even more impressive on a low-budget.But, what made this film special is despite the tragic loss of the son the family seems to move on through their circumstances and struggles in America becoming a stronger family unit. While their daughter Christy seems to mature and thrive in the country. It was nice to see a movie that wasn't fluffed- that showed real emotions from death, to poverty, to AIDs, to being un-employed, and to re-birth. This movie touches everyone on some level and I suppose it being seen through the eyes of a young Christy makes it even more special and precious.The young girls are really make this movie shine. The girl that plays Christy acts with her whole face making the movie darker than it is while the little girl that plays Ariel adds nothing but, sunshine to the screen.

I doubt the angst of family catharsis is the trait that will give this film the greatest lasting value, although the emphasis on emotional storyline is not to be discounted.What will make this film memorable 10 years from now, in my opinion, are the performacnces of the two daughters, Christy and Ariel, played by real life sisters Sara and Emma Bolger, respectively. In particular, Christy's performance transcends all other in this lovely little film about an immigrant family coming to a new land and finding a way over its own tragedy -- the death of a son and brother.Christy's work is more than good acting; it is magical. She regularly performs magic both in the character and in the story, magic that transcends an AIDS patient into a loving neighbor and magic that helps her dad overcome his own emotional demons. Christy gets a lot of help in the movie from good lines in the script, exceptional lighting, and wonderful direction.Together with her younger sister's charm and infectious joy, they transform the residents of their ""junkie building"" into a nice group of neighbors that might be just like your own.

604157,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLR8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","At the start of &quot;In America&quot; we are introduced a family of illegal immigrants.  This is a bit surprising because Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton), along with their two young daughters, Christie (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger), are an Irish family driving across the border into the United States from Canada.  After all, we have been conditioned to think of people of color as constituting the faces of illegal immigrants and the story of Irish immigration to America was largely a 19th-century tale.However, the idea of this family being illegal immigrants is not important to the heart of the story and there is a sense in which the only reason it is brought up is so that the officials at the border can ask how many children the parents have, because one says &quot;three&quot; and the other says &quot;two.&quot;  This is how we first learn about Frankie, the young son whose tragic death haunts his parents and is never far from the thoughts of young Christie and her precious cam corder.  A gulf has been created between the two sisters, and Ariel complains that she has no one to tell her secrets to.  This is a key idea because Christie does: Frankie.The family struggles to survive in New York City.  They find an apartment in a less than savory building, which makes you wonder whether things were really worse for them in Ireland or if we are supposed to think that they have made a mistake coming to the New World.  Johnny wants to be an actor and ends up being a cab driver while Sarah, unable to teach, becomes a waitress in a ice cream shoppe, while the girls are dispatched to Catholic school.  There the national anthem has Ariel worried about a blind man named Jose and the girls stand out because their Halloween costumes are homemade.  But the debacle of Halloween and the strange American ritual of going trick-or-treat results in the family ends up with the girls making a connection with the &quot;man who screams,&quot; a tormented Nigerian artist, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs.  This relationship becomes important, especially when Sarah becomes pregnant and there are complications.For me this film boils down to a final wish.  Sarah, who provides the film's sparse narration, tells us early on that she has three wishes that she can ask of Frankie that he will grant her.  He told her this before he died and she has absolute faith that this is the case and when her first two wishes are granted we become true believers as well.  But as Jim Sheridan's film reaches its climax Sarah is faced with too many choices for that final wish and the only thing that mattered to me was what this 11-year-old girl would wish for in the end.  I think everyone who gets caught up in the decision will be surprised by the choice.Both Morton and Hounsou were nominated for Oscars, in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor categories respectively, but it was the interplay between the real life sisters playing Christie and Ariel that captivates us.  It is so natural and unaffected that its reality comes as a shock.

Today, at a re-viewing, backed up by playing the director's commentary, I have come to support it 100%.Although commentaries are not always useful, Sheridan's is completely informal, personal, and authentic.  Some of the quieter voices are hard to catch from surrounding noise, which is a shame.  The performance of the young actor Emma Bolger is enough to make adults sit up straight and re-think; her script is Sheridan's, but her assumption of the role, done bravely, is all her own.  Paddy Considine is such a charmer, but this story squeezes him until the pips squeak, and a person behind the charm can emerge.  Samantha Morton too is excellent.  Altogether a rewarding movie.

604159,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JLR8,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 9]","This story is about a Irish immigrant family in New York in the 1980s.  They have little money but there's lots of love in their household.  The father, played by Paddy Considine, is an actor who drives a cab between going on auditions.  The mother, played by Samantha Morton, used to be a teacher, but now takes a job in an ice cream parlor.  The two children, played by Sarah and Emma Bolger (two real-life sisters from Ireland) are smart and sweet and lovable.  The whole family is mourning the death of a third child who died at a young age after years of suffering with a brain tumor.The only housing they can find is a huge walk-up apartment in a run-down druggie infested building which is supposed to be East Harlem.  The family is poor but surprisingly cheerful and happy to be in America.  Some of their experiences are humorous such as when the father tries to install a cheap air conditioner.  Some made me hold my breath, such as when he tries to win the little girl a doll at a carnival and bets all the rent money.  And then there is their strange neighbor, played by Djimon Housau, a Nigerian artist who is carrying an awful burden but who lets the little girls warm his heart.The urban setting seemed almost real. And so did the family's problems.  But somewhere along the line I grew a little tired of their constant positive outlook.  And there where parts of the film where it just seemed too much like a soap opera and much too maudlin for my tastes.However, this is an uplifting film.  And it shows the sunshine side of the immigrant experience. The acting is outstandingly good.  It's well paced and has a positive message.

604160,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B00005JLR8,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[2, 2]","""In America"" was directed by Jim Sheridan, and dedicated to his brother, whom I assumed passed away, as the boy mentioned in the movie did.  The directing, acting, cinematography, tone and script of the movie grabs your heart, tears it apart and yet many moments of hope and laughter come through.  It is a story of a determined Irish family, illegally immigrating to America via the Canadian border.  They want to start a new life, and move forward after the death of their five year old son from a brain tumor.  Most families cannot make it through the death of a child, but there are deep bonds and they want to make it through the grief.  You see Johnny's (Paddy Considine) love for his wife Sarah (Samantha Morton) during a hot New York summer.  He buys an air conditioner for the family - obviously used - and carts it through rude New York's streets, carries it up three flights of stairs to plug it in and the plug does not fit.  He buys a new plug and it shorts the old building's fuse.  Instead of sadness and anger, they take the rent money and go to the movie (E.T.) and then a outdoor carnival where Paddy shows his girls (the darling, smart, unbelievably great Bolger sisters) that he can win a E.T. Doll.All the performances are top-rate.  Paddy does an amazing job as the ""Da"" - who misses his son, but tries to ""act"" like a good father to his darling daughters.  Samantha Morton (Sarah, the mother) painfully wants to move on, yet misses her son so much.  Her eyes show the soul of sadness and gentle love for her family. She is willing to take a chance at death for another baby. Her hair is cut like a young boy's, perhaps like her son's when he lost his hair because of cancer and the brain tumor?  The two young daughters, played by real sisters Sara and Emma Bolger, seem like you are looking in on children in their own home.  Amazing that they understand and played the parts, deep in meaning and gut wrenching sadness of the loss of their brother and loss of happy parents. The sweetness of Sara's question ""Why is everyone dying?"" grabs your gut.  The angry artist on the floor below is played by a wonderful African actor Djimon Hounsou.  His story and the love of a struggling Irish family make confrontation of blame, anger, strength in crisis, and hope the polish to a amazing movie.Although it is a story of family ties and innocent humor, it is not for young children.  New York characters are raw and graphic.

604161,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JLR8,Mark,"[4, 4]","Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States.  To this, I respond: We've seen that hundreds of times in films.  The same goes for sports films.  We've seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers.  They are exactly the same movie with a different team.  That's not to say that these films aren't decent sports flicks, but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre.That being said, that is exactly what Jim Sheridan does with In America.  The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph.  The basic story follows a family of Irish immigrants who come to America with the same notion that all immigrants have: to attain the American Dream.  But, as they all sooner or later find out, the American Dream is an ideology that 99.9% of people never attain.  They have trouble finding a place to stay, and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies.  The father Johnny (Paddy Considine) is a struggling actor, who hasn't been able to get a part since the death of his son Frankie, who fell down the stairs.  The mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money.  The oldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) is probably one of the smarter people in the film, and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl.  She is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon.  Her younger sister Ariel (played by Sarah Bolger's younger sister Emma) is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everything.There are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film, one especially comes to mind, where the father almost squanders away all of the family's money trying to win an E.T. doll for the youngest daughter.  There are essentially three miracles in the film, and Christy, who is also the narrator, relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother Frankie told her about before he died.  The other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below.  When they first arrive in the house, Christy calls him ""the man who screams.""  This man's name is Mateo (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou) and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems.  He is sort of the figure of ""morality"" in the film, often giving out endless amounts of advice.  Mateo has some sort of disease (we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease) and he gets sick throughout the movie.In America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen.  Every actor is perfect in every scene.  Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film, and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film.  While I do agree with one other reviewer about how Christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties, stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film.  The overall message, then, is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to America; we already know that from previous films and/or experiences.  The film has such a deeper message, relating not just to immigrants, but to every person who watches this film.  I really do not want to give the message away, but rather I will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film.  This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen.",5,One of the Best Movies I've Seen In a Long Time,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,3733,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'site', 'have', 'said', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'hardships', 'extremes', 'immigrants', 'face', 'when', 'coming', 'United', 'States', 'respond', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'times', 'films', 'same', 'sports', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Glory', 'Road', 'other', 'films', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Hoosiers', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'movie', 'different', 'team', 'not', 'say', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'decent', 'sports', 'flicks', 'film', 'industry', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'potential', 'be', 'just', 'other', 'film', 'genre.That', 'being', 'said', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'America', 'story', 'so', 'original', 'acting', 'film', 'glorious', 'triumph', 'basic', 'story', 'family', 'Irish', 'immigrants', 'who', 'come', 'America', 'same', 'notion', 'immigrants', 'have', 'attain', 'American', 'Dream', 'sooner', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'American', 'Dream', 'ideology', '99.9', '%', 'people', 'never', 'attain', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'place', 'stay', 'end', 'up', 'apartment', 'top', 'run', 'down', 'building', 'many', 'residents', 'being', 'junkies', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'get', 'part', 'death', 'son', 'Frankie', 'who', 'fell', 'down', 'stairs', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'job', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'earn', 'rent', 'money', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Christy', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'probably', 'one', 'smarter', 'people', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'flawless', 'performance', 'young', 'girl', 'stereotype', 'oldest', 'child', 'who', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'soon', 'younger', 'sister', 'Ariel', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'younger', 'sister', 'Emma', 'typical', 'naive', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'fifty', 'questions', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'scenes', 'course', 'film', 'one', 'especially', 'mind', 'where', 'father', 'almost', 'away', 'family', 'money', 'trying', 'win', 'E.T', 'doll', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'are', 'essentially', 'three', 'miracles', 'film', 'Christy', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'three', 'events', 'set', 'three', 'wishes', 'brother', 'Frankie', 'told', 'died', 'other', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'involve', 'family', 'relationship', 'man', 'one', 'floors', 'When', 'first', 'arrive', 'house', 'Christy', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'name', 'Mateo', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'brilliant', 'artist', 'bit', 'emotional', 'problems', 'sort', 'figure', 'morality', 'film', 'often', 'giving', 'out', 'endless', 'amounts', 'advice', 'Mateo', 'sort', 'disease', 'can', 'only', 'expect', 'probably', 'venerial', 'disease', 'sick', 'movie.In', 'America', 'one', 'best', 'ensembles', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'perfect', 'scene', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'entire', 'film', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'wrote', 'directed', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'film', 'do', 'agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'how', 'Christy', 'modern', 'camera', 'story', 'set', 'eighties', 'stupid', 'facts', 'should', 'not', 'detract', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'overall', 'message', 'then', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'immigrants', 'face', 'hardships', 'when', 'come', 'America', 'already', 'know', 'previous', 'films', 'and/or', 'experiences', 'film', 'deeper', 'message', 'relating', 'not', 'just', 'immigrants', 'person', 'who', 'film', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'message', 'away', 'rather', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'go', 'rent', 'buy', 'treasure', 'film', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",In America

Paddy Considine (solid and tender) and Samantha Morton (emanating subtlety) star as Irish parents of two young girls who move to New York City to pursue Paddy's acting.  The move is also a distraction from the recent loss of their young son.  The summer heat is oppressive, the living conditions are near squalor and the local residents are junkies.  Despite this gloom and terrible poverty, the family thrives happily, mostly due to the amazing resilience and resolve of the two young daughters.  The loss of their son and an impending dangerous pregnancy are set against a backdrop of constant near danger and immense naivety (yet remarkable intuition) of the girls.  Mateo, (Djimon Hounsou) the AIDS stricken painter downstairs befriends the girls and provides some of the most frightening and yet emotionally substantial moments in the film.  Sheridan can take simple scenes like gambling the families rent money on a carnival doll for his child and turn it into pure suspense.  The family is always in near crisis, yet they survive day by day, relishing everything those `in America' take for granted.  Sheridan portrays a wonderful story of loss, survival and love, but never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental.

604164,AUNHTUF4ATEJM,B00005JLR8,M. C. Crammer,"[1, 1]","How I would rate this film varied as I watched the film -- sometimes it was a 5 and other times it was so slow I was thinking ""2.""  Overall, I'd give it a four.  It certainly isn't anything like Hollywood turns out, but I really thought it was a bit uneven and slow at parts.  Still, it is well worth the not-so-good parts to watch the brilliant parts.The story is based on the life of the producer (as you learn from a bonus on the DVD).  He came to America illegally with his wife and two children in the early 80s to become a Broadway actor -- apparently not very successfully in the first year, if one is to judge from this film.  The family in this film takes a terrible apartment in the only place they can find -- a building full of characters, mostly junkies. They seem oblivious to the danger and settle in, in the process making friends with an artist who lives in the building.  The family is grieving the death of a child, and much of the film involves the struggle to come to terms with that loss.  As Sheridan emphasizes, it is the story of a loving family.  That it is.

I bought the DVD purely after seeing the trailer on another DVD. The trailer touches something deep down inside you, and the whole film sticks with you long afterwards.The two girls in this (real life sisters), Christy & Ariel are absolutely outstanding for children so young, and showed some real emotion. Look out for Christy singing the Eagles song ""Desperado"" - you need a heart of stone if you don't find this the hardest part of the movie to watch. Little Emma & Sarah Bolger called ""cut"" and ""action"" in every scene. This was decided by the director and the girls early during filming, so that it would make the acting easier for them. Jim Sheridan captured every raw emotion that could be possibly portrayed in this, and all the actors do an excellent job.There are some things that stopped me giving this movie a four star rating. The fact that it's so fast paced & disjointed, and also there's no indication of how much time is passing, so you'll be watching it and suddenly it'll be a matter of months has passed, with no explanation. And also Samantha Morton - I think it's the fact that I can't stand girls with hair that short, I'm all for the girly girls with flowing locks. It doesn't make her look good in my opinion. I also found it really difficult to understand what was wrong with their originally grumpy downstairs neighbour, Mateo, played magnificently by Djimon Hounsou. I did think it was either cancer or AIDS, but it was quite difficult. Also, it's only called a ""disease"" throughout the movie, so it's really up to the viewers to come to their own conclusions as to what is really wrong with him. (I did think Samantha Morton's character had cancer, but she didn't.) Unfortunately, there's not much integration between Mateo & the family, and this was a major selling point of the movie, if only that part could have been extended a little. That part seemed rushed to me.If you're a sucker for an Irish accent, like me (I go weak at the knees), then you'll love the accents in this, since it's predominantly spoken in thick Irish accents. If you're from outside the UK, you'll probably need subtitles.

The family comes to America after the death of a child.  The only place they can find to live is an apartment where crack addicts hang out.  The two daughters played by real life sisters (Sarah and Emma Bolger) give good performances.  The younger of the two is liable to be a fantastic actress if she keeps up with the acting business.Amoungst the other characters is one that they call the screaming man.  When the sisters go trick or treating, they bang on everyone's door but no one will open up.  Then they bang on the screaming man's door.  At first you fear for them as their strange neighbor, played by Djimon Housau, lets them enter his strange abode.  He screams because of his rage.  He is dying from aids but  when he meets the two little girls you can see that he is harmless and loves the lifeforce that they exude.Later on in the film, the mom gives birth to another child but the baby is not expected to live.  Somehow the neighbor's death and the baby's birth become entertwined but I won't give it away here.At times the hard luck issues of the family beome tiresome but this movie is still worth viewing.

Also what's with the girl's having that digital video camera when this is supposed to take place in the early eighties I believe (i.e. E.T. showing and dolls conveniently being found at the amusement park/area)?

604173,A27QLYGAM9AU3M,B00005JLR8,Mike Sobocinski,"[37, 40]","Just saw this film for the second time at the theater, and the metaphor that comes to mind is that of peeling an onion.  The first time I saw the film, the skin of the onion was removed.  After the first half of the film it started sinking in that this was no mere string of episodes about Irish immigrants in New York City.  It was clear from the first that there was good acting, and I expected only one of those European-style ""slice of life"" films, but I was delighted that the story actually built up a direction and a momentum and built to a truly impressive conclusion.  Shakily photographed opening scenes turned out to be a deliberate and very appropriate work of craftsmanship linked into the heart of the film.  The weirdly filmed sensual bedroom scene turned out NOT to have just been tossed in for its own sake, but rather was essesntial to set up symbols for the second half of the film.  Not every note of the film rings true, but in the second half, once the characters are established, we find elements of mysticism and heartbreak mixed with textures of wonder and grit.  I knew I had to go back and peel away another layer.  Upon a second viewing, the spiritual/religious references were revealed more clearly, and I was convinced that my emotional response had been no mere fluke of mood or of the actors alone, but that this is actually a work of art, carefully set up with multiple layers and levels of understanding.  Motifs and metaphors of blood, home, planets, aliens, angels, and place will be more carefully explored on my next viewing, for they all clearly have deliberate meaning.  Even the setting of the ""Hell's Kitchen"" neighborhood is significant, because the film's setting is staged as a kind of purgatory for all of its characters as their mundane world becomes repeatedly touched by transcendent observations and events, as they must all come to grips with the ways in which life and death touch each other.  This is an awesome film whose themes and emotions go well beyond what most films will even attempt, although the film repeatedly shows restraint to try to keep such portrayals from appearing over-the-top.  But the seeming restraint does not dampen its emotional impact.  For those who are comfortable with a sense of spirituality that does not stem from specific points of doctrine (indeed, for which doctrine could be seen as needlessly limiting an appreciation of experience... of reality) this is a film that can be considered authentically religious.  Religious NOT in some simple sense of simply saying ""let us pray,"" but in a real-life and complex, challenging way... in which the kingdom of heaven is within, in which God acts through people, and through imperfect people loaded with fears and doubts and pain but who must find ways to express hope and charity in spite of this.  This is a great movie...well worth repeated viewings as viewers explore its many nuances and challenges.

604174,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JLR8,Miles D. Moore,"[18, 19]","There are films that are so humane, and make us love their characters so deeply, that they make us better people (at least temporarily) just for watching them. ""In America,"" Jim Sheridan's semiautobiographical movie about about an Irish family in Manhattan in the early 1980s, is one of those films. The Sullivans--father Johnny, mother Sarah, small daughters Christie and Ariel--are still shell-shocked from the death of the family's young son from a brain tumor. They live in poverty in a Lower East Side tenement--the father, an actor, endures a futile daily grind of auditions while driving a cab to make ends meet. Told mostly from Christie's standpoint, ""In America"" is the story of how the Sullivans fare in their exciting but threatening new home, and of the friends they make--particularly Mateo, the artist dying of AIDS who lives on the floor below. Making Christie the narrator was a master stroke, for the film's touches of magic realism are all the more believable for being a child's perceptions. (One unforgettable scene makes a baseball-toss game at a street fair the subject of unbearable suspense.) ""In America"" never puts a foot wrong, in its direction, writing or acting; all the performances, unfussy and emotionally direct, seem to be lived rather than acted. The adult actors--Paddy Considine as Johnny, Samantha Morton as Sarah, and Djimon Hounsou as Mateo--give astonishingly strong, moving performances. The children--real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger as Christie and Ariel--are as enchanting as any child actors who have ever stood in front of a camera. ""In America"" isn't for the ""Little House on the Prairie"" crowd--the emotions and situations it depicts are messy, and the only sugar in the script is in the ice-cream sundaes Christie and Ariel eat. But love and forgiveness are in abundance here, as are faith, hope and charity. ""In America"" bears comparison with Elia Kazan's ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"" another, much older movie about an Irish family in a New York tenement.

With little to their names besides the clothes on their backs, Sarah (Samantha Morton), Johnny (Paddy Constantine), and their two daughters, Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger), move into a run-down tenement occupied mostly by drug addicts and misfits. The girls make the acquaintance of a reclusive African artist (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs from them, and that unusual friendship helps see the family through their grief and recover their hope for the future and for each other.""In America"" was inspired by two events in the life of its writer and director, Jim Sheridan. Sheridan's brother died when he was a child, and, as an adult, he illegally immigrated with  his family to New York in the 1980s. Sheridan has combined these two seminal events into one generation with the help of his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, who contributed their childhood memories to the screenplay. ""In America"" is the story of a family that deals with great loss by uprooting itself and making a new life in an entirely different environment. Already emotionally estranged from one another, they become strangers in a new world. Once a working class family in Ireland, they now struggle with poverty in New York. And this somehow cures their ills. While I was watching this film, I was captivated by its dreamlike quality and impressed with the terrific cast. The story is narrated by Christy, a precocious 10-year-old who documents her world and her feelings with her ever-present camcorder. The actresses who play Christy and her younger sister Ariel really are sisters, and they give some of the most charming and impressive performances by child actors that I have ever seen. Samantha Morton is also particularly good as their broken-hearted mother, Sarah. The character that serves as a catalyst for emotional change, Mateo, the artist downstairs, is little more than a clich&eacute;, although Djimon Hounsou plays him well. After I had thought about the film for a few hours, I began to realize that the story is more contrived than I had originally noticed. Mateo is far from being the only clich&eacute;, and living in destitution doesn't provide opportunities for emotional epiphanies. It is, in fact, very dangerous, exhausting, and depressing. But as I counted ""In America""'s contrivances and preposterous elements, I was also struck by the fact that I wasn't inclined to think about them as I was watching the movie. That's because ""In America""'s dreamlike quality and its engaging performances overcome its lapses in credibility. I don't know that this film is supposed to be literally believable. The family's emotional journey is poignant and rings of truth. The details are a little fantastic. But it is told through the memories of a child, which may partly explain its uneven realism. Memory is highly subjective, in any case; its only what one person noticed and clung to. I recommend ""In America"" for its fine performances and its unique and slightly fanciful perspective.",4,Fanciful but Poignant Story of Recovery.

New York City comes to represent America as a place of challenge difficult to work through poverty, difficult to cope with the cost of medical care, difficult to catch a break, but fraught with freedom and opportunity none the less.The film brilliantly turns into less of a movie about New York City slums and more about the powerful grace of the human experience, more about a family going through the grieving process and sticking together through difficult times.&quot;In America,&quot; goes directly on my top ten movie list of all times (dang it now I'm going to have to go figure how to update Listmania lists on this web site...go figure).

604185,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JLR8,Robert Morris,"[7, 8]","This film focuses on Sarah and Johnny Sullivan as they relocate with their two daughters from Ireland through Canada to New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Once in residence in a squalid tenement, they begin a new life together with high hopes and great expectations, although haunted by the death of a toddler. That loss presumably motivated Sarah (Samantha Morton) and Johnny (Paddy Considine) to make a fresh start in a strange city where so many other immigrant families have also done so for more than a century. Johnny is an aspiring actor whose ambitions are endured by his generally sullen wife. It soon becomes obvious that Sarah and (especially) Johnny are ill-prepared for the responsibilities of parenthood. Violent crime as well as alcohol and drug abuse surround the Sullivans where they live and yet the two daughters are often allowed to roam around unsupervised.Over time, the Sullivans become friends with Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), a neighbor in the tenement who eventually provides unexpected assistance when it is needed most. (The nature of that assistance is best revealed in the film.) Frankly, I still do not know what to make of the relationship between Mateo and the Sullivans. The friendship they share was more a distraction than a revelation as I struggled to understand Sheridan's purposes. Unlike Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, for example, Mateo seems a contrivance.Having seen four films which Sheridan previously directed -- My Left Foot (1989), The Field (1990), In the Name of the Father (1993), and The Boxer (1997) -- I admire so much what he has contributed to our understanding of the courage and determination which many of his characters somehow summon in response to severe hardship. They evince an integrity lacking in the adult characters in this film, with the possible exception of Mateo. As indicated, there are several reasons for my disappointment in In America. Nonetheless, the performances by Hounsou and the Bolger sisters almost -- not quite -- elevate this film above the inadequacies of its  narrative (i.e. gritty realities awkwardly juxtaposed with fantasy) as well as the disturbing questions raised about the Sullivans as parents.",4,Almost But Not Quite,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2191,"['film', 'Sarah', 'Johnny', 'Sullivan', 'relocate', 'two', 'daughters', 'Ireland', 'Canada', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'Once', 'residence', 'squalid', 'tenement', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'together', 'high', 'hopes', 'great', 'expectations', 'haunted', 'death', 'toddler', 'loss', 'presumably', 'motivated', 'Sarah', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'make', 'fresh', 'start', 'strange', 'city', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'immigrant', 'families', 'have', 'also', 'done', 'so', 'more', 'century', 'Johnny', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'ambitions', 'are', 'endured', 'generally', 'sullen', 'wife', 'soon', 'obvious', 'Sarah', 'especially', 'Johnny', 'are', 'ill-prepared', 'responsibilities', 'parenthood', 'Violent', 'crime', 'as', 'well', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'abuse', 'surround', 'Sullivans', 'where', 'live', 'yet', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'often', 'allowed', 'roam', 'unsupervised.Over', 'time', 'Sullivans', 'become', 'friends', 'Mateo', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'neighbor', 'tenement', 'who', 'eventually', 'unexpected', 'assistance', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'nature', 'assistance', 'best', 'revealed', 'film', 'Frankly', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'relationship', 'Mateo', 'Sullivans', 'friendship', 'share', 'was', 'more', 'distraction', 'revelation', 'struggled', 'understand', 'Sheridan', 'purposes', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'example', 'Mateo', 'contrivance.Having', 'seen', 'four', 'films', 'Sheridan', 'previously', 'directed', 'Left', 'Foot', '1989', 'Field', '1990', 'Name', 'Father', '1993', 'Boxer', '1997', 'admire', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'contributed', 'understanding', 'courage', 'determination', 'many', 'characters', 'somehow', 'summon', 'response', 'severe', 'hardship', 'evince', 'integrity', 'lacking', 'adult', 'characters', 'film', 'possible', 'exception', 'Mateo', 'indicated', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'disappointment', 'America', 'Nonetheless', 'performances', 'Hounsou', 'Bolger', 'sisters', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'elevate', 'film', 'inadequacies', 'narrative', 'i.e', 'gritty', 'realities', 'awkwardly', 'juxtaposed', 'fantasy', 'as', 'well', 'disturbing', 'questions', 'raised', 'Sullivans', 'parents']",In America

Sure, it could have been an over the top sentimental movie, but the suburb acting and cinematography saved it.  The movie deals with death and redemption and the hope that America offers for those who have lost all hope.  Grieving from the death of their two-year-old son, an Irish family illegally immigrates to America to make a fresh start.  Yes, the film could have easily fallen into a formula flick, but the superb performances by Samantha Morton (the mother) and Emma Bolger (the youngest daughter) save the show.  They are simply riveting.Throughout the movie we see a struggle for faith.  The lost faith of the father, the struggling faith of the mother and the persistent faith of the children, especially of Ariel, the youngest.  How does one deal with the death of a child?  Statistically most marriages do not survive a death of a child, the guilt, the accusations, the ifs become overwhelming.  The Sullivans run away from Ireland but they cannot run away from their inner demons, they must be faced.This is also a story about in America.  The Sullivans make their new home in a drug-invested ghetto in Manhattan.  Despite their poverty, they see America as hope for redemption as a family.

604187,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLR8,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Jim Sheridan's ""In America"" is so imbued with good feelings and good intentions that it comes as a bit of a surprise that the film as a whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts.The film, written by Jim, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, tells the story of an Irish immigrant family embarking on a new life in Manhattan.  The family consists of Johnny, a wannabe actor; Sarah, his wife; and their two adorable young daughters, Christy, who narrates the film, and Ariel, a sensitive, wise-beyond-her-years little girl, whose wide-eyed wonderment provides the greatest joy of the film.  (Ariel and Christy are played by real life sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger).  As with most immigrant sagas, the family in ""In America"" experiences a great deal of difficulty adjusting to life in a new land.  Complicating matters further is the fact that they recently lost another child, a young boy whose death from a fall down the stairs may or may not have been the result of Johnny's carelessness.  Some of the film's most moving moments involve the ways in which each of the family members deals with the loss, guilt and regret that comes with such a tragedy.The fifth major character is a mysterious recluse who lives in their tenement, a muscular, taciturn black man whose mystical view of life intrigues the ladies in the family while making Johnny eye him with wary, perhaps overprotective, suspicion.  Mateo is deeply embittered about life (we find out why about halfway through the film), yet is instantly softened the moment he meets these two disarming children one Halloween night.There is much to praise in this film.  The Sheridans bring a warm, heartfelt tone to the work, capturing, with both honesty and compassion, the struggles that immigrant families face no matter what their country of origin.  The family members, despite their difficulties and personal problems, obviously love and care for one another deeply and this quality draws us into their tightly knit unit.  Above all, the movie boasts fine performances from Paddy Consadine as Johnny, Samantha Morton as Sarah, Djimon Hounsou as the mysterious neighbor Mateo and, above all, the Bolger sisters who are as compelling and natural on screen as any child actors could ever possibly be.Yet, despite all these quality elements, what is that, nevertheless, keeps us from giving our heart over fully to ""In America""?  I think, at times, the film tries too hard to make its points, often sacrificing grit and believability in a bid to make the audience ""feel good"" about life. The film is set in 1982, the year in which ""'E.T.' - mania"" was sweeping the nation, and the Sheridans try to infuse some of the magic from that film into their own through the use of both direct and indirect references to Spielberg's masterpiece (at one point the family goes to see the film, and, later, in a crucial scene about filial devotion, Johnny attempts to win Ariel an E.T. doll at a carnival).  However, unlike ""E.T.,"" which was an obvious work of fantasy, ""In America"" wants to have it both ways: it aspires to be a realistic, earthy portrayal of immigrant life in the Big City, yet it also yearns to be a heartwarming fantasy filled with touches of Magic Realism.  The mixture simply doesn't jell.  Too often the plotting, in an attempt to bring it all together, feels forced, phony and contrived, relying too heavily on implausible parallel events, while piling on the melodrama and tragedy to ludicrous proportions.  The character of Mateo is also problematic.  Despite Hounsou's fine work in the role, Mateo feels like little more than a plot device employed by the filmmakers to get their points across.  He is never allowed to be a fully developed individual in his own right, but instead emerges as the stereotypical ""exotic black man,"" replete with all sorts of magical notions and pseudo-spiritual mumbo jumbo.  It is simply a given that Mateo is more noble and enlightened than everybody around him, and the movie ends up patronizing him in the process.Any movie that attempts to combine fantasy with reality has set a difficult task for itself.  That ""In America"" doesn't succeed entirely in the endeavor says more about the unevenness of the execution, perhaps, than the worthiness of the cause.  Thus, while one can enjoy the bits and pieces that make up the film, ""In America"" itself may leave the audience feeling a bit unsatisfied and frustrated in the long run.  I know it did me.",3,many fine elements but it never quite comes together,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,4453,"['Jim', 'Sheridan', 'America', 'so', 'imbued', 'good', 'feelings', 'good', 'intentions', 'bit', 'surprise', 'film', 'whole', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'film', 'written', 'Jim', 'Naomi', 'Kirsten', 'Sheridan', 'story', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'family', 'embarking', 'new', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'family', 'Johnny', 'wannabe', 'actor', 'Sarah', 'wife', 'two', 'adorable', 'young', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'who', 'film', 'Ariel', 'sensitive', 'wise-beyond-her-years', 'little', 'girl', 'wide-eyed', 'wonderment', 'greatest', 'joy', 'film', 'Ariel', 'Christy', 'are', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'sisters', 'Emma', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'most', 'immigrant', 'sagas', 'family', 'America', 'great', 'deal', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'life', 'new', 'land', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'further', 'fact', 'recently', 'lost', 'child', 'young', 'boy', 'death', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'Johnny', 'carelessness', 'film', 'most', 'moving', 'moments', 'involve', 'ways', 'family', 'members', 'deals', 'loss', 'guilt', 'regret', 'such', 'tragedy.The', 'fifth', 'major', 'character', 'mysterious', 'recluse', 'who', 'tenement', 'muscular', 'taciturn', 'black', 'man', 'mystical', 'view', 'life', 'intrigues', 'ladies', 'family', 'making', 'Johnny', 'eye', 'wary', 'perhaps', 'overprotective', 'suspicion', 'Mateo', 'deeply', 'embittered', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'halfway', 'film', 'yet', 'instantly', 'softened', 'moment', 'two', 'disarming', 'children', 'one', 'Halloween', 'night.There', 'much', 'praise', 'film', 'Sheridans', 'bring', 'warm', 'heartfelt', 'tone', 'work', 'capturing', 'honesty', 'compassion', 'struggles', 'immigrant', 'families', 'face', 'matter', 'what', 'country', 'origin', 'family', 'members', 'difficulties', 'personal', 'problems', 'obviously', 'love', 'care', 'one', 'deeply', 'quality', 'tightly', 'knit', 'unit', 'movie', 'fine', 'performances', 'Paddy', 'Consadine', 'Johnny', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Sarah', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'Mateo', 'Bolger', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'compelling', 'natural', 'screen', 'child', 'actors', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'be.Yet', 'quality', 'elements', 'what', 'nevertheless', 'giving', 'heart', 'fully', 'America', 'think', 'times', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'points', 'often', 'sacrificing', 'grit', 'believability', 'bid', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'film', 'set', '1982', 'year', 'E.T', 'mania', 'was', 'sweeping', 'nation', 'Sheridans', 'try', 'infuse', 'magic', 'film', 'own', 'use', 'direct', 'indirect', 'references', 'Spielberg', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'point', 'family', 'see', 'film', 'later', 'crucial', 'scene', 'filial', 'devotion', 'Johnny', 'win', 'Ariel', 'E.T', 'doll', 'carnival', 'However', 'E.T.', 'was', 'obvious', 'work', 'fantasy', 'America', 'have', 'ways', 'be', 'realistic', 'earthy', 'portrayal', 'immigrant', 'life', 'Big', 'City', 'yet', 'also', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'fantasy', 'filled', 'touches', 'Magic', 'Realism', 'mixture', 'simply', ""n't"", 'jell', 'Too', 'often', 'plotting', 'attempt', 'bring', 'together', 'feels', 'forced', 'phony', 'contrived', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'implausible', 'parallel', 'events', 'piling', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'ludicrous', 'proportions', 'character', 'Mateo', 'also', 'problematic', 'Hounsou', 'fine', 'work', 'role', 'Mateo', 'feels', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'employed', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'points', 'never', 'allowed', 'be', 'fully', 'developed', 'individual', 'own', 'right', 'instead', 'stereotypical', 'exotic', 'black', 'man', 'replete', 'sorts', 'magical', 'notions', 'pseudo-spiritual', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'simply', 'given', 'Mateo', 'more', 'noble', 'enlightened', 'everybody', 'movie', 'up', 'patronizing', 'process.Any', 'movie', 'combine', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'set', 'difficult', 'task', 'America', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'entirely', 'endeavor', 'more', 'unevenness', 'execution', 'perhaps', 'worthiness', 'cause', 'Thus', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'bits', 'pieces', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'America', 'may', 'leave', 'audience', 'feeling', 'bit', 'unsatisfied', 'frustrated', 'long', 'run', 'know', 'did']",In America

To complement that perfectly, the acting and direction do complete justice to the perhaps deliberately soft theme.

Having a foot on each shore, in falls flat in the middle.Recommended rental for a slow evening but I'd think twice before singing paeans to it.",3,"DAZZLING SCREENPLAY, BUT IN THE END A LACKLUSTRE TEAR-JERKER",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,1124,"['Sheridiens', 'are', 'impressive', 'script', 'writers', 'sketch', 'Irish', 'couple', 'living', 'pitfalls', 'triumphs', 'family', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'complement', 'perfectly', 'acting', 'direction', 'do', 'complete', 'justice', 'perhaps', 'deliberately', 'soft', 'theme', 'intent', 'movie', 'was', 'create', 'pointless', 'tale', 'couple', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'two', 'very', 'nice', 'mature', 'children', 'succeeded', 'admirably.But', 'bit', 'difficult', 'want', 'squander', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'time', 'watching', 'dull', 'depressing', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'create', 'own', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'Sheridien', 'never', 'seemed', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'wanted', 'make', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'film', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'showing', 'nakedly', 'circadean', 'roughness', 'urbanscapes', 'crushing', 'American', 'Dream', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'complete', 'children', 'magic', 'power', 'family', 'stay', 'united', 'general', 'happiness', 'good', 'will', 'Having', 'foot', 'shore', 'falls', 'flat', 'middle.Recommended', 'rental', 'slow', 'evening', ""'d"", 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'singing', 'paeans']",In America
604192,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005JLR8,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[13, 20]","The film opens with the narration by Christy (Sarah Bolger), talking of her family's desire to start over in America. Her father, Johnny (Paddy Considine) is an aspiring actor hoping to find his fortune on stage in New York. He and his wife Sarah (Samantha Morton) are also hoping to somehow start a new life together with their daughters Christy and Ariel (Emma Bolger) as they continue to mourn for their son, Frankie.Another important member of the cast is Christy's camcorder, which is almost like a character in of itself. Sarah is the quiet, yet strong center of this Irish family illegally entering the country in pursuit of the American dream, quietly filming documenting the important landmarks and achievements in her family's life.As the family drives from Canada into New York. As they exit the Lincoln tunnel, Johnny is scanning the radio stations and a disc jockey announces that they have the latest hits from the 70s, 80s and 90s... so the film opens up with the assumption that the timeline is current. When they view the New York skyline, the twin towers are conspicuously absent and Christy is using a small digital camcorder.The family sells their rattle-trap of a car to move into a druggie-infested tenement of an apartment house. They are on the  5th floor of a building with no working elevator, and as summer approaches, it is oppressively hot.The family works together to liven up their dank apartment and Johnny starts rehearsing for his auditions.  Sarah's sweet smile and overt love for her husband do not reveal the turmoil underneath - a man who has not yet accepted the death of his son and is almost bereft of emotions beyond a kind smile and a nod as he refuses to grieve - as though the refusal would somehow keep Frankie from dying.An angry, lonely African artist lives below them - and he comes out of his shell when he meets Christy and Ariel as they go trick or treating.  While he appears to be healthy, a refrigerator full of medicine reveals otherwise. While it is never specifically stated, it is obvious that Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) is suffering from AIDS... but the parents seem oblivious. As the story continues, the viewer starts thinking, &quot;hmmm... maybe this film is taking place in the early 80s?&quot;  Sure enough, the parents take their kids to the movies to escape the heat of their apartment to watch &quot;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.&quot; &quot;E.T.&quot; came out in 1982 - just months before AIDS was even given a name.  Then there are the posters in Times Square, showing young T.V. and film stars of today that were not even alive in 1982... and then there's that pesky digital camcorder which didn't exist back then, either.Personal camcorders were an expensive luxury in 1982 and they were almost as big as Ariel. Christy's whole camcorder is smaller than a VHS tape, which was the only medium for personal use at that time. It would have made much more sense for the girls to have an old beat-up Super 8mm film camera than an apparatus from the future.For those too young to remember, AIDS was to the 1980s what Polio was in the 1940s and 50s. It terrified people. No one really knew how you got it. People were shunned, some were fired and some were attacked. People didn't want to be in the same room with people that AIDS because no one was 100% sure how it was spread and people who had it lived very short lives after their diagnosis.  Despite the fear and panic of the rest of civilization, Johnny and Sarah welcome Mateo to their apartment and adopt him into their family. He teaches Christy to paint and helps her to decorate her room and becomes a type of faux older brother for Ariel, who still grieves deeply for Frankie.Although she was told she would never again to be able to bear children, Sarah again becomes pregnant - with complications.  Her new daughter will only survive with a blood transfusion from Christy, who proves once again that she is the family's backbone.  As the almost lifeless baby begins to open her eyes, we see Mateo closing his eyes for the last time in a Hospice - as though his spirit is somehow helping the new child to breathe... and with the birth of their new child in America, the first signs of true emotion come back to Johnny.The film has beautiful moments and the astounding acting of true-life sisters Sarah &amp; Emma Bolger will blow you away. The film is superbly acted by all and only those with a heart of granite will not have a lump in their throats during some scenes.This notwithstanding, the plot has holes-a-plenty. Not only do we have the time-traveling camcorder from the future, the whole film has almost too much sentimentality to it. It's as if every scene is a glimpse of life to be cherished, much like the moments captured on a movie camera (futuristic or otherwise). The film's intention is to be sentimental, but it goes a little to far to the point of making the whole story improbable.For the acting alone, this is a film worthwhile seeing, but unlike some of its rave reviews, I do not concur that this is the best film of the year - although the emotional roller-coaster ride can make you feel as though you are intimately connected with its characters.",4,Re-birth in America,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,5196,"['film', 'narration', 'Christy', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'talking', 'family', 'desire', 'start', 'America', 'father', 'Johnny',

604193,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B00005JLR8,Simon Crowe,"[5, 7]","IN AMERICA is the story of an Irish family that moves to New York to escape the memory of a child who has died tragically. The father (Paddy Considine) is an aspiring actor and the mother (the great Samantha Morton) is forced to take a waitressing job as the family can only afford to live in a drug infested Hell's Kitchen tenement. The two young daughters (Sarah and Emma Bolger) rely mostly on each other since the parents both seem to be numbed by grief.It's a very episodic film, filled with snatches of moments as the family settles in to their new home. Johnny, the father, can't find acting work and takes a job as a cab driver. The kids start a new school where they are inexplicably alienated from all the other students. Things go along, and a pregnancy threatens the health of Morton's character. The circumstances of the child's death, whic hovers over everything, are never explained clearly--references are made to falling down the stairs and to a brain tumor. Most predictably, the family is pulled out of the doldrums by their encounter w/ a neighbor (Djimon Hounsou, in a role so symbolic he should have had ""Life Force"" written on his clothes) who is dying of AIDS. Of course, he reminds the family what's important. (Hounsou actually performs with great warmth and makes the best of this cliched role).The movie is constructed so that just when things seem at their worst there's a moment to remind us how great life really is (a snowball fight, a bizarre scene at a street fair)... It ends on an up note, although I'm not sure it's earned. Made with great skill and affection by Jim Sheridan, who directed and cowrote the autiobiographical script with his two daughters. Morton and the kids are good, but Considine can't suggest the necessary degree of inner turmoil.

The cast play their roles to perfection and Sam Morton excels as a mother trying to hold her family together. Paddy Considine is completely authentic as the father who fights to support his family, whilst fighting his own grief at the same time. The two delightful actresses who play his daughters (sisters in real life) are a joy to watch and are incredibly natural and unaffected in front of the camera.

604197,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JLR8,S. Schell,"[2, 2]","Jim Sheridan has been called as a master storyteller, most popular for his direction of critically-lauded films such as ""My Left Foot"" and ""In The Name of the Father"" and his latest effort is no exception.  ""In America"" tells a very personal story, one that is loosely based on Sheridan's own family.  With a script co-written by his daughters Kirsten and Naomi, ""In America"" is a semi-autobiographical film that will incite joy, sadness, heartache and hope a hundred times over.The film tells the story of an Irish family moving to America for a clean slate after the death of their son Frankie.  Due to their limited means, they rent an apartment in the heart of Hell's Kitchen, the building a refuge for prostitution, drug trafficking and just plain strange denizens and happenings.  Johnny (Considine) is an aspiring actor but he can't seem to muster the feeling he needs to nail down a part - his emotional core has been numbed by Frankie's passing and it affects his ability to keep a job as well as his relationship with his wife Sarah (Morton) and their two daughters.  Everyone deals with their pain in their own way - Christy (Sarah Bolger) makes new memories among the old with her cherished camcorder and has one-way conversations with her brother to ease the pain of his absence.  Johnny chooses not to feel anything while Sarah puts on a brave face even though she is dying inside.  What no one expects to deal with is the arrival of yet another child, one that endangers Sarah's life.  Johnny beseeches her to sacrifice the baby for their well-being, not wanting their family to deal with another tragedy whilst Sarah is instantly attached to the new life inside of her, seeing it as the potential for the healing they all so desperately need.While they toil with their new way of life and the great change to come about it with the birth of a fourth child, Christy and her younger sister Ariel (Emma Bolger) go knocking about the building on Halloween and one of their strangest and most intimidating neighbors named Mateo (Hounsou) opens the door to them, much to their surprise.  They hold their breath as Mateo stares them down, not knowing what to make of him after having heard his agonizing screams behind his closed door the very day they moved in, the words ""KEEP OUT"" emblazoned in large hand-painted letters.  Instead, he is instantly charmed by Ariel's gregarious and boisterous nature and invites them in.  It is the start of a dynamic and beautiful friendship for all involved, one that makes them realize that tragedy travels in large circles and cannot be avoided no matter how far they move to escape it.  In the end, everyone learns to face their grief head on, their lives fresh with emotional wounds but also the wherewithal to remedy them.""In America"" contains bravado performances from every actor in its small and intimate cast.  Morton and Considine are quiet powerhouses, both of them flexing a dramatic muscle that needs no performance enhancement.  Hounsou doles a memorable turn as well as the tortured Mateo, a man who finds himself sustained by the strong and vibrant lifeforce of Johnny's family while his own ebbs away.  Sarah and Emma Bolger, real-life siblings, are the genuine article of child actors - nothing they give feels forced and that can be attributed to their natural abilities as well as Sheridan's superb direction.Hell's Kitchen is depicted much as Sheridan himself lived it, warts and all, the family's apartment one of the worst ever seen.  Of particular delight is Johnny's trek across several city blocks with an air conditioning unit to combat the sweltering summer temperatures, only to short circuit the entire building the moment he plugs it in.  Sheridan's small cast of characters is beautifully depicted as being poor in capital but rich in spirit.Bottom line: One of the best films you've never watched, ""In America"" will bring a tear to your eye and a warmth to your heart unlike any drama out there.

You actually get the sense that you are viewing this family's life rather than actors playing it out. Essentially, it is the story of this young Irish couple and their two daughters who move (illegally) into the slum of all slums of Manhattan in the 1980's. The purpose of their move is so the father can pursue an acting career, but most importantly, to move away from their life in Ireland where they lost their only son to a brain tumor. Though they live in the poorest conditions, the family still keeps their chins up and makes the best of their situation. Additionally, they develop a strong friendship with their strange downstairs neighbor, whom they find out latter is dying from Aids.

604199,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JLR8,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[8, 8]","Jim Sheridan's ""In America"" is a deeply personal film that boasts some of the finest ensemble acting of recent years. It is a film that chronicles the agonizing struggles experienced by immigrants new to America. It is also a film that illustrates how important it is to retain a measure of hope and faith in our lives.Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah Sullivan (Samantha Morton) are Irish immigrants who come to America with their two young daughters, Christy and Ariel (Sarah and Emma Bolger). Nothing comes easy for the new arrivals as the family is forced to live in a run-down tenement with little money for necessities. The situation becomes bleaker as Johnny can't find work as an actor, the daughters have some trouble fitting in at school, and the air conditioning unit burns out in the middle of a heat wave. Furthermore, the family has a mysterious neighbor named Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who comes to be known as ""the man who screams."" Yet even with all this adversity around them, bits and pieces of joy start to creep into the family's lives and soon they find the collective strength to come to grips with a tragedy in their past and to embrace their new lives in a new land.The performances in ""In America"" absolutely sparkle. Considine and Morton are excellent as the parents with Morton in particular further cementing her reputation as one of the best actresses working today. Hounsou finally finds a role that enables him to follow up on the potential he displayed in ""Amistad"" (1997) and he makes the most of his opportunity. But it is the Bolger sisters who steal the film. Both Sarah and Emma are astonishing in their roles and their sincerity and sweetness infuse ""In America"" with a degree of honest emotion that is so very difficult to capture on celluloid. In addition to its solid writing, directing, and acting, this film also has the surprising effect of increasing one's affection for both E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and the song ""Desperado."" Just remember that if you feel you must obtain an E.T. plush doll for yourself, avoid the drama and just buy one at a store instead of trying to win one at a game booth.",4,"""You came all the way to America to trick-or-treat?""",1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2142,"['Jim', 'Sheridan', 'America', 'deeply', 'personal', 'film', 'finest', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'agonizing', 'struggles', 'experienced', 'immigrants', 'new', 'America', 'also', 'film', 'how', 'important', 'retain', 'measure', 'hope', 'faith', 'lives.Johnny', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Sarah', 'Sullivan', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'are', 'Irish', 'immigrants', 'who', 'come', 'America', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'Sarah', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'Nothing', 'easy', 'new', 'arrivals', 'family', 'forced', 'live', 'run-down', 'tenement', 'little', 'money', 'necessities', 'situation', 'bleaker', 'Johnny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'work', 'actor', 'daughters', 'have', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'school', 'air', 'conditioning', 'unit', 'burns', 'out', 'middle', 'heat', 'wave', 'Furthermore', 'family', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Mateo', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'be', 'known', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'adversity', 'bits', 'pieces', 'joy', 'start', 'creep', 'family', 'lives', 'soon', 'find', 'collective', 'strength', 'come', 'grips', 'tragedy', 'past', 'embrace', 'new', 'lives', 'new', 'land.The', 'performances', 'America', 'absolutely', 'sparkle', 'Considine', 'Morton', 'are', 'excellent', 'parents', 'Morton', 'particular', 'further', 'cementing', 'reputation', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'Hounsou', 'finally', 'role', 'follow', 'up', 'potential', 'displayed', 'Amistad', '1997', 'most', 'opportunity', 'Bolger', 'sisters', 'who', 'steal', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Emma', 'are', 'astonishing', 'roles', 'sincerity', 'sweetness', 'infuse', 'America', 'degree', 'honest', 'emotion', 'so', 'very', 'difficult', 'capture', 'celluloid', 'addition', 'solid', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'film', 'also', 'surprising', 'effect', 'increasing', 'one', 'affection', 'E.T', 'Extra-Terrestrial', 'song', 'Desperado', 'Just', 'remember', 'feel', 'must', 'obtain', 'E.T', 'plush', 'doll', 'drama', 'just', 'buy', 'one', 'store', 'instead', 'trying', 'win', 'one', 'game', 'booth']",In America

604201,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B00005JLR8,Thayer,"[6, 7]","On the surface the movie is about an immigrant family dealing with life in America. But if we look closer which is not a hard task since it is pretty obvious that the movie's heart and soul is how the family cope (for some failure or refusal to cope) with loss and acceptance while living in a foreign land.After seeing the movie I realized that the use of a child's point of view in telling a story is very effective in stories that are potentially ""sappy"". The movie was never melodramatic, it's heartwarming and deeply moving, besides the wonderful and perceptive script of the Sheridans, I think the use of the narration and the insights of the little girl was a key factor to that.So many memorable scenes. One that quickly comes to mind is the scene with the ET stuffed toy prize in some sort of a game. At first it's just about a $30 toy, but in the end it became so much more about that. It was heartbreaking. Another notable scene was the ""Desperado"" school number of Christy (the narrator), for someone so young it's hard to believe she sang it with such depth and heart. And the ending was beautiful! It is a poignant closure to characters that are in desperate need of one.

604202,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B00005JLR8,Timothy Kearney,"[9, 9]","I missed IN AMERICA when it was in the theaters, and I vowed not to miss it when it was released in DVD. The reviews of the film were excellent, and I knew I would enjoy an Irish family moving to the United States. I decided to purchase the DVD rather than rent it, knowing that when I saw it I would enjoy it, complain about a few clich&eacute;s, and put it away to view it again in a year or so. I certainly expected it to be somewhat lighter fair, in the same category as WAKING NED DIVINE. I was hardly prepared for the dramatic intensity of the film.The story tells of a young couple, Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton respectively) who move from Ireland to New York with their two daughters after the tragic death of a younger son. The parents are too busy trying to care for the children to attend to their own grief which provides for much of the film's conflict. The two daughters Christy and Ariel, played by real life sisters Emily and Sarah Bolger, are endearing, and see a magical side to an area of New York most people would avoid at all costs. This seems to be due less to the fact that they have left rural Ireland for the big city (Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and Limerick have their share of seedy neighborhoods infested with drugs and poverty), but rather it is due to their outlook on life. The family befriends a neighbor who is dying from AIDS who allows the family to deal with its own loss and celebrate life once again.While the plot of this movie has been retold in many different ways in film and literature, IN AMERICA has many qualities that make it outstanding. Writer and director Jim Sheridan is able to capture the girls' innocence remarkably well. Johnny and Sarah are authentically Irish yet they have a universal appeal. New York City is colorful even in the midst of pain and tragedy. Family life is celebrated yet the conflicts are real. Perhaps what made this film most outstanding in my eyes is that even though I instinctively knew how the film would probably end, it still held my interest and had a degree of suspense to it. This only happens when a film captures a viewer's heart while respecting the viewer's intelligence.",5,It's Easy to Fall in Love With the Sullivan Family,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,2192,"['missed', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'vowed', 'not', 'miss', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'excellent', 'knew', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Irish', 'family', 'moving', 'United', 'States', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'rather', 'rent', 'knowing', 'when', 'saw', 'would', 'enjoy', 'complain', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'put', 'away', 'view', 'again', 'year', 'so', 'certainly', 'expected', 'be', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'fair', 'same', 'category', 'WAKING', 'NED', 'DIVINE', 'was', 'hardly', 'prepared', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'film.The', 'story', 'tells', 'young', 'couple', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'Sullivan', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'respectively', 'who', 'move', 'Ireland', 'New', 'York', 'two', 'daughters', 'tragic', 'death', 'younger', 'son', 'parents', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'care', 'children', 'attend', 'own', 'grief', 'much', 'film', 'conflict', 'two', 'daughters', 'Christy', 'Ariel', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'sisters', 'Emily', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'are', 'endearing', 'see', 'magical', 'side', 'area', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'avoid', 'costs', 'be', 'due', 'less', 'fact', 'have', 'left', 'rural', 'Ireland', 'big', 'city', 'Dublin', 'Belfast', 'Cork', 'Limerick', 'have', 'share', 'seedy', 'neighborhoods', 'infested', 'drugs', 'poverty', 'rather', 'due', 'outlook', 'life', 'family', 'neighbor', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'who', 'family', 'deal', 'own', 'loss', 'celebrate', 'life', 'once', 'plot', 'movie', 'been', 'retold', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'film', 'literature', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'many', 'qualities', 'make', 'outstanding', 'Writer', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'able', 'capture', 'girls', 'innocence', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Johnny', 'Sarah', 'are', 'authentically', 'Irish', 'yet', 'have', 'universal', 'appeal', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'colorful', 'even', 'midst', 'pain', 'tragedy', 'Family', 'life', 'celebrated', 'yet', 'conflicts', 'are', 'real', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'most', 'outstanding', 'eyes', 'even', 'instinctively', 'knew', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'end', 'still', 'held', 'interest', 'had', 'degree', 'suspense', 'only', 'when', 'film', 'viewer', 'heart', 'respecting', 'viewer', 'intelligence']",In America
604203,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00005JLR8,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[2, 3]","There are several reasons that make this movie powerful and heartbreaking but it is mainly the five incredible actors that make this a film you remember for a long time. A film that is able to give you a little hope for a better world, and a hope for immigrants or new begginers everywhere. This is a movie of a family struggling with many new beginings. New life in America and a new life without a beloved member of the family. A new life for every member of the family trying to find his new place in the world, a world without a son and a brother. The mother, played by Samantha Morton is candid and touching in every scene. One of the strongest scenes is the fight scene between wife and husband. He confronts her and asks if putting herself in risk in order to have another baby indeed protects her children as she claims to be doing...""Yes"" she answers confidently (with all her body) and with an inner logic you are able to understand after watching and learning her character throughout the movie. What she means is that having another child and trying to hang on to life is what's going to keep this family together. The husband, played by Paddy Considine is unable to understand her at this point of the story but the viewer is able to see his full torn character. We get to see bits and pieces of the way he was in the past and the inner turmoil he is undergoing. It seems that he is putting such a strong act for normality on the outside that there is not much power left for emotions he needs to ""feel"" for his acting roles. Or so I explained this to myself.Mateo played by Dijmon Hounsou looks like an Egyptian God - his strong face is powerful even in sickness and so are the words he speaks in an African accent. There is something very majestic in all his moves, especially in his final action.Emma Bolger - Arielle (""We're on Holiday and my Dad's not working..."") is sweet and lovely but I feel that the elder sister (Sarah Bolger) is the one giving the movie its added value. She is powerful even in her silence and the things she is able to say. ""In America"" is her story and is brought to us in her words. Christy is able to understand reality in full but she is unable to let go of her belief in magic and its powers. This belief is part of her inability to let go of her dead brother (whom she pleads to let go of her)  The striking difference between the way she sees the world and the reality as the adults and the viewers see it is the main ache in this movie.In spite of the emotional upheaval you undergo while watching this movie and its many strong moments, you do not feel as if you are being emotionally played with, as all seems like a normal happening.  I loved everything about this film. The script is heartbreaking and told in a way that tears you apart. The music is quite surprising as some of it is unfamiliar and the rest can seem totally out of place at times. A very happy tune is heard in the scene starting with a blooming yellow flower.. Spring is coming and the baby is born but this is not a happy moment. Great pain and worry are on the screen. ""Do not wake me up if something happens to the baby"" says the mother to her husband. The contrast between the music you hear and what happens on screen is totally striking but is able nevertheless to add to the harmony of this movie as all senses are part of the experience and the sound of the music only sharpens what you see (happy? Sad? Life is a combination).The DVD holds an additions part with scenes deleted during the editing. These parts hold no surprises as most of them are further elaboration of scenes the movie holds.

604204,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLR8,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 5]","""In America"" is a semi-autobiographical film about Jim Sheridan, acclaimed director whose works are deeply rooted in Ireland (see gripping film ""In the Name of the Father"").  But this time he sets his story in New York, telling about a family who just arrived there to start over their life, because of one unforgettable memory in the past.The film is very episodic (partly because the script is done by three people, Jim Sheridan and his daughters Naomi and Kirsten).  It mainly shows the life of the parents, father a struggling actor and the mother supporting him.  But what is really wonderful is the two daughters played by the real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger.  They live in a very dirty apartment where junkies are hunging around, but for the two girls it becomes a magical place, and the unlikely friendship between them and 'the Yelling Man' Mateo (great Djimon Hounsou, ""Amistad""). one of the tenant, is one of the touching moment.That's all you have to know.  Though the film features realiable actors like Samantha Morton (""Sweet and Lowdown"") or Paddy Considine (""Last Resort""), the film's greatest virtue lies in the incredibly delightful Bolger sisters.  They are so cute and natural that even Morton cannot steal the show from them, and you know the fact from the very first scene, where one of the sisters unwittingly says an embarrassing thing which she should never say, at the immigration checkpoint.The camera (by Declan Quinn, actor Aidan's brother) is nicely captures the hot and cold air of New York (but the interior shots are all taken in the soundstage in Dublin!).  Though sometimes the film shows a lull (especially when the little sisters are not on the screen), and some part of the story are left unexplained, ""In America"" is a strong drama about the people coming to America with dream.  And it also does not forget the reality ... in this film, though, it changes into magic realism, thanks to the two Bolgers.

The story is small and somewhat insignificant in the grand scheme of things but isn't that what life for most immigrant American's really is?The Sullivan's arrive in America illegally and find themselves living in a junkie infested tenement in New York. With the dreams of immigrants, having arrived from Ireland, they set up a home proudly and without questioning their circumstances. The apartment becomes a bohemian beauty and is filled with love between the Sullivans's despite the dire circumstances they face. The family struggles with finding jobs, maintaining pride and adapting to the openness of life in America. The two young girls who play the Sullivan daughters are absolutely adorable and seem to run through life filled with innocence and hope, something adults sorely lack most of the time. The girls befriend many of the ""strangers"" in their neighborhood and seem to adapt to all of the endless oddities that surround them. Their greatest friend comes in the form of an ailing artist, (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou), who looms over them with what soon becomes a lifelong affection. The intricacies of the relationships in this film are what make it extraordinary. All of the actors are perfectly casted and deserve attention for what they have accomplished, no one is over the top yet they have all earned stardom for their down-to-earth simplicity.If you are looking for a movie that is effortless but well-written with characters of great depth and meaning this film is for you.

Both little girls are wonderful to watch, especially when they were making friends with their eccentric neighbor(Djimon Housou).
