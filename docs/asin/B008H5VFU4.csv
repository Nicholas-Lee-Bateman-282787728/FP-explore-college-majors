It shows the dangers of taking family tragedy generated hate beyond the point of reason.  This movie is set on the international stage and does show some, but not much, Chinese government involvement mostly in the form of tacit approval of the actions of one of its private citizens.  An unusual feature of this movie is a mature female protagonist.  I enjoyed this movie.This is a two part movie with both parts coming on the same download or streaming.  The two parts may have made sense for the dramatic release but do not for a video to be seen at home.There is some actual violence in the movie and a lot of implied violence and death.

1553083,A3H3N7PQBSLBFV,B008H5VFU4,George M.,"[5, 7]","After watching the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, which was excellent, I was looking forward to a film with similar qualities. I regret that this film failed on all counts. Although the concept for the plot was good, the script, the acting and almost every aspect of the film failed to meet my expectations. I gave the film two stars and that was being generous.If all of the judges in Sweden have the same lack of common sense and intelligence as shown by the main character, the country is in serious trouble. The plot failed to meet the ""it could happen"" test in this regard. The lead police detective character has the same problem. If she is an example of the average Swedish detective, God help the victims of crime in Sweden. A judge that finds themselves in a situation where the lead detective treats the only surviving family member of a massacre in that way would be on the phone to any number of political and judicial connections to get the situation under control. The detective would have been removed from the case so fast as to make her head spin.Any person who is intelligent enough to become a judge should have the common sense to have a couple of bodyguards assigned to her instead of bumbling around and making herself an easy target for the killer. I realize that human frailty is a key ingredient in adding tension to the plot of a ""thriller"", but the way it was used in this film was ridiculous. It's on a level with those films where the character is running away from a killer but keeps falling down and tripping just to make sure the killer catches up. I won't even address the idea of the judge flying off to China to try and track down the killer herself. At least she called her soon to be ex-husband, a train conductor. All he needed to do to help her was to turn his train around and get the porters to form up a posse.",2,This Film was a Major Disappointment,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,1858,"['watching', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'trilogy', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'similar', 'qualities', 'regret', 'film', 'failed', 'counts', 'concept', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'script', 'acting', 'almost', 'aspect', 'film', 'failed', 'meet', 'expectations', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'was', 'being', 'generous.If', 'judges', 'Sweden', 'have', 'same', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'shown', 'main', 'character', 'country', 'serious', 'trouble', 'plot', 'failed', 'meet', 'could', 'happen', 'test', 'regard', 'lead', 'police', 'detective', 'character', 'same', 'problem', 'example', 'average', 'Swedish', 'detective', 'God', 'victims', 'crime', 'Sweden', 'judge', 'situation', 'where', 'lead', 'detective', 'only', 'surviving', 'family', 'member', 'massacre', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'phone', 'number', 'political', 'judicial', 'connections', 'get', 'situation', 'control', 'detective', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'case', 'so', 'fast', 'make', 'head', 'spin.Any', 'person', 'who', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'become', 'judge', 'should', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'have', 'couple', 'bodyguards', 'assigned', 'instead', 'bumbling', 'around', 'making', 'easy', 'target', 'killer', 'realize', 'human', 'frailty', 'key', 'ingredient', 'adding', 'tension', 'plot', 'thriller', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'level', 'films', 'where', 'character', 'running', 'away', 'killer', 'falling', 'down', 'tripping', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'killer', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'address', 'idea', 'judge', 'flying', 'China', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'herself', 'least', 'called', 'soon', 'be', 'ex-husband', 'train', 'conductor', 'needed', 'do', 'help', 'was', 'turn', 'train', 'around', 'get', 'porters', 'form', 'up', 'posse']",The Man from Beijing
1553084,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B008H5VFU4,Get Serious,"[1, 1]","(Some spoilers). As others have stated, this is a film about revenge. A Chinese family takes out a hit list for an entire Swedish family for injustices done by a family member 150 years before. After massacreing two entire family lines, only one woman is left. The film is made in two parts. In the first part the massacre occurs in the US and Sweden, where the film is made, in spoken Swedish with English subtitles. The second part occurs in 'China' as the sole survivor seeks out the Chinese assassin. Although filmed in Taiwan it appears to be the Chinese mainland. This is a nailbiter and well worth your time and the three hours goes quickly. What makes a severe impression is how the woman is kept under direct, video and cell phone tracking surveillance! We see how modern corrupt regimes with advanced computer and surveillance systems have created a modern p*lice state! This is a very scary thing, as it is now in place in the UK and the US. Our government has completely sold us out to the Chinese, who own our national debt, half our banks, a huge amount of real estate! Never in history have political states been this controlled, surveilled and computer-tracked as is happening now ALL OVER THE WORLD!

It is masterfully centered around great abuses that ocurred to the Chinese immigrants who came to America in the 1800s, but the revenge for the abuses are being carried out now.  The movie involves the last member of a Swedish family, the only member to have accidentally survived the revenge of a Chinese man who is well trained with the sword.  Both social realities for how to see historical abuse are represented in the story.  It is a drama that is driven along with a tension of suspense, a suspense driven by when is she going to get it.  There are many questions a viewer will take from this thought provoker.  A question that I took away from the story is how independent should my family loyalty be in light of a government's design to have all people individualized into the government's mode of behavior as defined by the terms ""an obedient citizen"".Women who enjoy watching women control the power position in social dynamics will be satisfied with this movie.  All the positions of power are controlled by women except one but that male is nixed out by a woman of authority.  Interesting.I found it an engaging dynamic that seemed pretty realistic except for one aspect that was missing.  The one aspect that was missing was the equally prone tendency of corruption that goes along with positions of power.

The Wallander TV shows have been shown on PBS and I liked them better. Tighter scripts and stronger characters. This film (2 part German TV show) is 3 hours long and should have been shorter.  That having been said I found the movie entertaining.  It moves from Sweden to China in this century and to the US in the 19th century.  I felt more atmosphere in Sweden but there is more action in China. Credibility gets stretched thin at times.  This is partly corrected by the actress who plays the lead who makes her character convincing most of the time. The Chinese actors were less convincing.  The action in the US is not subtle - villain persecuting innocents.

1553096,A2DSPA62XEGH1U,B008H5VFU4,Wolfgang Gunther,"[0, 0]","The show consists of two back-to-back TV movies based on a book by Henning Mankell  (best known from &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;). The soundtrack language is German and subtitles are in English. As a native German speaker I found the combination very easy to comprehend, just listen and do the occasional read. But the subtitles are very good all by themselves. The only thing that seemed a little strange to me was the way Swedish and Chinese actors came out with this flawless Gernan enunciation.Anyhow, I prefer not to give away too much if the plot. It involves a batch of grisly murders in a Swedish backwoods hamlet, hometown of a female judge, whose estranged parents are among the victims. Her efforts to unravel the mystery diverge from the easy local solution proposed by the various  police organizations that get involved. Bit by bit, she us able to collect evidence of a long-standing feud, stretching back more than a century to building of the transcontinental railroad in the American West, that ties together a Chinese organization and one of her ancestral relatives. In the second movie, the action shifts from what is depicted as largely rural Sweden to a dramatically modern China and leads to an eventual resolution of the mysteries. Highly recommended to watch in a single session.",5,Great double feature,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1317,"['show', 'two', 'back-to-back', 'TV', 'movies', 'based', 'book', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'best', 'known', '34', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '34', 'soundtrack', 'language', 'German', 'subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'native', 'German', 'speaker', 'found', 'combination', 'very', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'just', 'listen', 'do', 'occasional', 'read', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'thing', 'seemed', 'little', 'strange', 'was', 'way', 'Swedish', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'came', 'out', 'flawless', 'Gernan', 'enunciation.Anyhow', 'prefer', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'batch', 'grisly', 'murders', 'Swedish', 'backwoods', 'hamlet', 'hometown', 'female', 'judge', 'estranged', 'parents', 'are', 'victims', 'efforts', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'diverge', 'easy', 'local', 'solution', 'proposed', 'various', 'police', 'organizations', 'get', 'involved', 'Bit', 'bit', 'able', 'collect', 'evidence', 'long-standing', 'feud', 'stretching', 'back', 'more', 'century', 'building', 'transcontinental', 'railroad', 'American', 'West', 'together', 'Chinese', 'organization', 'one', 'ancestral', 'relatives', 'second', 'movie', 'action', 'shifts', 'what', 'depicted', 'largely', 'rural', 'Sweden', 'dramatically', 'modern', 'China', 'eventual', 'resolution', 'mysteries', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'single', 'session']",The Man from Beijing

Competent actors wasted on an absurd script; the wonderful Michael Nyquist is thrown away in practically a bit part.  Main lead Suzanne Von Brosody does her best but can't overcome the ridiculous plot in which Swedish police are colossal idiots, everyone speaks German, even in Nevada, Sweden and China, and the main character impulsively chases a Chinese mass murderer to China with no plan or resources.  Amy Cheng, as the sister of a sociopathic corrupt Chinese businessman, is compelling but ultimately she's undone by the mindless plot as well.  Almost everybody dies, but not soon enough.  Decent production values, but who cares?  The whole thing is a mess, except for some intercut flashbacks of 1800s America, which are gruesome and over the top, but at least the story is compelling.  The first half starts out well, but the whole thing is ultimately hopelessly disappointing, if you value logic in any quantity.",1,Nice production values undone by stupidity,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1030,"['Directed', 'Peter', 'Keglevic', 'greatest', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'comedy', 'magic', 'drumsticks', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Competent', 'actors', 'wasted', 'absurd', 'script', 'wonderful', 'Michael', 'Nyquist', 'thrown', 'away', 'practically', 'bit', 'part', 'Main', 'lead', 'Suzanne', 'Von', 'Brosody', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'Swedish', 'police', 'are', 'colossal', 'idiots', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'German', 'even', 'Nevada', 'Sweden', 'China', 'main', 'character', 'impulsively', 'Chinese', 'mass', 'murderer', 'China', 'plan', 'resources', 'Amy', 'Cheng', 'sister', 'sociopathic', 'corrupt', 'Chinese', 'businessman', 'compelling', 'ultimately', 'undone', 'mindless', 'plot', 'well', 'Almost', 'everybody', 'not', 'soon', 'enough', 'Decent', 'production', 'values', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'mess', 'intercut', 'flashbacks', '1800s', 'America', 'are', 'gruesome', 'top', 'least', 'story', 'compelling', 'first', 'half', 'out', 'well', 'whole', 'thing', 'ultimately', 'hopelessly', 'disappointing', 'value', 'quantity']",The Man from Beijing
