1112333,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000WW1YO2,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 2]","Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem is a DVD box set of the fifth season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains four episodes and the special features.The special features menu contains five options: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" and ""Actor Profiles.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains model sketches of the characters that appear in this DVD box set.  However, I don't know how many pages of sketches there are, because no page numbers were included in this feature (which had been the case for the previous Ranma 1/2 DVD box sets).  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.  It should be noted that, unlike some of the previous box sets, that the English names that appear in the cast list are not links to their entries in the ""Actor Profiles"" area.  In my opinion, I thought that Viz Media was putting less effort into the DVD extras in this set than they had on the previous DVD box sets.Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem is a rather ""low frills"" DVD set.  While the special features are better than what appeared on the first Ranma 1/2 DVD box set, I wish something had been done that took a little more effort, such as interviews with the English voice actors, or character profiles for the characters that appear on the box set.Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem tends to run between $40 and $50 at retail.  While this could be considered a little high-priced for what you get, the episodes are still worth the cost.  The series is very enjoyable for an older audience (16 and up), and really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",3,The fifth season of Ranma 1/2,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1880,"['Ranma', '1/2', 'Martial', 'Mayhem', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'fifth', 'season', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'set', 'total', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'contain', 'five', 'episodes', 'fifth', 'disc', 'four', 'episodes', 'special', 'features.The', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'contains', 'five', 'options', 'Line', 'Art', 'Gallery', 'Textless', 'Opening', 'Textless', 'Ending', 'Cast', 'List', 'Actor', 'Profiles', 'expected', 'textless', 'opening', 'ending', 'are', 'just', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits', 'text', 'line', 'art', 'gallery', 'model', 'sketches', 'characters', 'appear', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'pages', 'sketches', 'are', 'page', 'numbers', 'were', 'included', 'feature', 'had', 'been', 'case', 'previous', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'cast', 'list', 'list', 'English', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'character', 'actor', 'profiles', 'are', 'selected', 'filmographies', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'previous', 'box', 'sets', 'English', 'names', 'appear', 'cast', 'list', 'are', 'not', 'links', 'entries', 'Actor', 'Profiles', 'area', 'opinion', 'thought', 'Viz', 'Media', 'was', 'putting', 'less', 'effort', 'DVD', 'extras', 'set', 'had', 'previous', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets.Ranma', '1/2', 'Martial', 'Mayhem', 'rather', 'low', 'frills', 'DVD', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'better', 'what', 'appeared', 'first', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'wish', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'took', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'such', 'interviews', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'character', 'profiles', 'characters', 'appear', 'box', 'set.Ranma', '1/2', 'Martial', 'Mayhem', 'run', '40', '50', 'retail', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'little', 'high-priced', 'what', 'get', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'cost', 'series', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'older', 'audience', '16', 'up', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'anime', 'fan', 'DVD', 'collection']",Ranma 1/2: Season 5 - Martial Mayhem

The series is very light hearted as the main characters are Ranma a young teenage boy martial artist who had the unfortunate accident while training in China to fall into a cursed pool at jusenkyo that turns him into a girl when dosed with cold water and can only change back with hot water, and Akane a young teenage girl martial artist whose father is the master and owner of a martial arts dojo and is Ranma's betrothed fiancee which neither Akane or Ranma knew that their fathers had set up.  Of course sparks fly between the two betrothed at first and not love sparks especially when Akane at first thinks Ranma is a girl(Seeing him in girl form when they first meet) and than realizing what has happen to him after Ranma's father explains about the accident.  The series of course has a gaggle of other characters trying to woo Ranma and Akane to them and some of those characters have themselves been cursed by the pools of jusenkyo.  The video is decent but not as sharp and clear as recent animes have been but that's a little understandable as this series started around 1989 and finished around 1996 so most of the animation won't be as up to par as with the animes in the past ten years.  The voice cast for both the subbed and dubbed are great and memorable in their roles as they played them incredibly of course the one major change was the male voice of Ranma was changed in season four so if you have the previous three season sets you'll of course notice that one difference but no worries as that doesn't make that much of a difference.  So if you're tired of the dramatic and serious anime and are looking for a more light anime here's a great choice to check out for you home anime library...",5,The Humor and Entertainment Continue With This Great Series,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1955,"['still', 'remember', 'when', 'started', 'getting', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'thought', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'likability', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'series', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'watch', 'series', 'very', 'light', 'hearted', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Ranma', 'young', 'teenage', 'boy', 'martial', 'artist', 'who', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'training', 'China', 'fall', 'cursed', 'pool', 'jusenkyo', 'girl', 'when', 'dosed', 'cold', 'water', 'can', 'only', 'change', 'back', 'hot', 'water', 'Akane', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'martial', 'artist', 'father', 'master', 'owner', 'martial', 'arts', 'dojo', 'Ranma', 'betrothed', 'fiancee', 'Akane', 'Ranma', 'knew', 'fathers', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'course', 'sparks', 'fly', 'two', 'betrothed', 'first', 'not', 'love', 'sparks', 'especially', 'when', 'Akane', 'first', 'thinks', 'Ranma', 'girl', 'Seeing', 'girl', 'form', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'realizing', 'what', 'happen', 'Ranma', 'father', 'accident', 'series', 'course', 'gaggle', 'other', 'characters', 'trying', 'woo', 'Ranma', 'Akane', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'cursed', 'pools', 'jusenkyo', 'video', 'decent', 'not', 'sharp', 'clear', 'recent', 'animes', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'understandable', 'series', 'started', '1989', 'finished', '1996', 'most', 'animation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'up', 'par', 'animes', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'are', 'great', 'memorable', 'roles', 'played', 'incredibly', 'course', 'one', 'major', 'change', 'was', 'male', 'voice', 'Ranma', 'was', 'changed', 'season', 'four', 'so', 'have', 'previous', 'three', 'season', 'sets', ""'ll"", 'course', 'notice', 'one', 'difference', 'worries', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'So', ""'re"", 'tired', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'anime', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'light', 'anime', 'here', 'great', 'choice', 'check', 'out', 'home', 'anime', 'library']",Ranma 1/2: Season 5 - Martial Mayhem
