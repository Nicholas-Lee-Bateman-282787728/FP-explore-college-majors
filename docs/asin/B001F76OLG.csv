The premise behind the movie - that a guy meets a princess who turns out to be a magical guardian of fairy-tale animals - is cute and has potential. However, it ultimately falls short. It seemed too quick (and indeed runs less than an hour and a half) and never took full advantage of the fairy-tale creatures at its disposal. There were no magical moments with unicorns (although there was one with a fairy baby). The movie could have been extended by half an hour or so in order to play up the fairy-tale aspect. Right now, it's too similar to any other ABC love story.Another concern is the appropriateness for kids. Some reviewers have noted one of the characters uses words like gay, lesbian, and virginal. While those certainly aren't appropriate for a kids movie, I was more disturbed by the portrayal of marriage. The main character's best friend seems to constantly complain about his marriage and the responsibility of having a baby. Fortunately, at the end of the movie he seems to have forgotten about his problems, but it was still unnecessary and doesn't portray marriage well.",2,"Cute idea, poor execution",1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,1218,"['Admittedly', ""'m"", 'not', 'member', 'target', 'audience', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'did', 'see', 'recently', 'had', 'few', 'thoughts', 'premise', 'movie', 'guy', 'princess', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'magical', 'guardian', 'fairy-tale', 'animals', 'cute', 'potential', 'However', 'ultimately', 'short', 'seemed', 'too', 'quick', 'indeed', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'never', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'fairy-tale', 'creatures', 'disposal', 'were', 'magical', 'moments', 'unicorns', 'was', 'one', 'fairy', 'baby', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extended', 'hour', 'so', 'order', 'play', 'up', 'fairy-tale', 'aspect', 'Right', 'now', 'too', 'similar', 'other', 'ABC', 'love', 'story.Another', 'concern', 'appropriateness', 'kids', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'one', 'characters', 'words', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'virginal', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'kids', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'disturbed', 'portrayal', 'marriage', 'main', 'character', 'best', 'friend', 'constantly', 'complain', 'marriage', 'responsibility', 'having', 'baby', 'Fortunately', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'forgotten', 'problems', 'was', 'still', 'unnecessary', ""n't"", 'portray', 'marriage', 'well']",Princess: A Modern Fairytale

For me it just never quite acheived it. The attempt to blend the here-and-now with happily-ever-after just didn't fit this time like I felt it had in Disney's ""Enchanted.""I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be. Dialogue seemed more adult in places than necessary in a kid's movie. Some of the scary fairy tale creatures might be too much for some little ones (though most kids seem pretty jaded these days), but the princess theme is obviously geared to little girls. The immature attitude of Will's friend, Louis, toward fatherhood may have been trying to play to men, though I can't see many of them wanting to sit through this movie. In an attempt to please everyone, it pleased no one at my house.The princess is very sweet and pretty, her ""knight in shining armor"" is a nice looking average guy. There are some entertaining moments--especially the fairy baby, but overall, for me, it fell short of being a charming modern-day fairy tale.",3,Not as enchanting as I'd hoped,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,1078,"['had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'began', 'unfold', 'thought', 'had', 'potential', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'acheived', 'attempt', 'blend', 'here-and-now', 'happily-ever-after', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'time', 'felt', 'had', 'Disney', 'Enchanted', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'Dialogue', 'seemed', 'more', 'adult', 'places', 'necessary', 'kid', 'movie', 'scary', 'fairy', 'tale', 'creatures', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'ones', 'most', 'kids', 'seem', 'pretty', 'jaded', 'days', 'princess', 'theme', 'obviously', 'geared', 'little', 'girls', 'immature', 'attitude', 'Will', 'friend', 'Louis', 'fatherhood', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'play', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'wanting', 'sit', 'movie', 'attempt', 'please', 'everyone', 'pleased', 'one', 'house.The', 'princess', 'very', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'nice', 'looking', 'average', 'guy', 'are', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'especially', 'fairy', 'baby', 'overall', 'fell', 'short', 'being', 'charming', 'modern-day', 'fairy', 'tale']",Princess: A Modern Fairytale

I also thought it was quite cute and well done, especially for a made-for-tv movie. The story revolves around a mysterious princess who lives in a castle in a regular, contemporary small town, and only comes out once a year for a ball to raise money to save endangered species. A friend visiting a friend and his wife in the town attends the ball, and falls for the princess. She mistakes him for someone called the searcher and he is pulled into her mysterious life saving mythical creatures. It has heart, moves briskly, and is decently done, especially for a tv movie. Overall, a hit for sleepovers and parties, especially for girls 6-10 or so.",4,"Very Enjoyable and Different, Well Done for a Made-For-TV Movie",1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,767,"['movie', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', '4', 'kids', 'watched', 'two', 'eight-year', 'old', 'girls', 'boy/girl', 'six-year', 'old', 'twins', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'cute', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'story', 'around', 'mysterious', 'princess', 'who', 'castle', 'regular', 'contemporary', 'small', 'town', 'only', 'out', 'once', 'year', 'ball', 'raise', 'money', 'save', 'endangered', 'species', 'friend', 'visiting', 'friend', 'wife', 'town', 'ball', 'princess', 'someone', 'called', 'searcher', 'pulled', 'mysterious', 'life', 'saving', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'heart', 'moves', 'briskly', 'decently', 'done', 'especially', 'tv', 'movie', 'Overall', 'hit', 'sleepovers', 'parties', 'especially', 'girls', '6-10', 'so']",Princess: A Modern Fairytale

It even has an element of suspense and surprise that hook you up to watch past half of the movie.For five to six year old kids, it can really be scary with some of the make-ups seem to belong more on a horror flick than a fairy tale movie. The special effects with all the mythological characters are cheap and very cheesy; they move like frame by frame Gumby-like clay motion. The story and the dialogue also deteriorate when all the creatures started to appear.

1187993,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B001F76OLG,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]","If you are looking for a princess story with some mild horror elements then this might interest you. I personally didn't find it that scary and thought most of the story was rather sweet. I however would not show this movie to kids as there is a very scary monster. The basic story is that a princess lives in a castle where she heals hurt mythological creatures. There is a mermaid, a miniature dragon, a fairy who has a baby and what looks like a werewolf.No one is normally allowed in the castle so the whole situation is steeped in mystery. The problem is that the princess is about to turn 25 at which time she will lose her powers. A new princess has to be found immediately. So the story has some suspense elements in it.It is probably no spoiler to tell you that the prince ends up with the princess. However I was disappointed that there was no wedding at the end. It seemed the prince just went to live in the castle without marrying the princess. I think this sends the wrong message to kids. So as an adult I could enjoy most of the movie but the ending was a little disappointing.The highlight of the movie is when the fairy baby flies.
