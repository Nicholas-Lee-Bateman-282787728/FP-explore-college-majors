A man studies painting and wonders if he should continue? No, he is mediocre. He decides to study medicine in London. We see ""St. Bartholomew's Hospital"" (Barts?). One doctor has a brusque attitude. A boy has a club foot. Philip Carey shows his deformity to the students. One student asks another for advice on love. Philip diagnoses a young woman as anemic. Is she ill-natured? Philip says she has a nice smile. Philip sketches her portrait and makes a date with her. He orders champagne for their meal. Is she cold to him? Philip dreams of her. Is he in love with her? ""I don't mind."" Emil Miller talks to Philip and offers advice. Mildred can't go to the theater. Does she have a cruel streak? Philip reads a thick book while other students party. He keeps thinking of Mildred, and fails his exam. They meet again.The other students say Mildred isn't a good match for him (her social class). Mildred says she will marry another man (she is 24 and getting old). A fellow student advises Philip to find another woman. He meets Norah, who writes romantic stories for a pulp magazine; it's a good living with these fantasies for young woman. She insists that Philip study for his exams. Is he too sensitive about his foot? One day he finds a visitor - Mildred. Emil has left her, she is with child. Mildred has her pride. [Pride is one of the seven deadly sins.] Philip gives her money. He talks to Emil, who has a wife and child! Does Philip still love her? Mildred will do anything for him. Then Norah comes to visit him to learn why Philip hasn't seen her. ""How could you?"" Mildred delivers in a hospital. She has another boyfriend, Harry. Mildred means nothing to him, he tells Philip. They quarrel and break off their friendship when Mildred tells about a trip to Paris with Harry.But Harry rejects Mildred too! Philip meets a man in the Charity Hospital. Why is he poor? ""Fast women and slow horses."" While testing a patient he meets his daughter Sally, and later visits this large family. This man offers his opinions on life! Sally invites him back. The days pass. Philip returns, and learns about Mildred's problems. He invites her to stay with him, she has no place to go. Mildred complains about his paintings. Philip's uncle sends him money. Mildred speaks out and insults him! She slashes his paintings and burns the securities meant to pay for his education! He must leave medical school. But first they operate on his club foot. Philip can't find work. His landlady wants the past due rent and puts him out.Sally's father wants him to stay there, and finds a job for Philip. Mildred visits Philip, she is coughing all the time. Its her lungs. [TB was a fatal disease until they developed antibiotics. Note the dark make-up on Mildred's eyes.] Mildred pleads with him. A letter tells Philip his uncle has died, he will get a small inheritance. Philip now passes his exams. Philip accepts a job on a steamship line. He visits Sally, she tells of her love. When he returns he will marry Sally. Mildred is in the Charity Hospital and dying. Philip won't take that job but asks Sally to marry him.This is an educational drama that warns against using emotions as a guide to behavior. Should you love someone when this is against your best interests? Would Norah have been a better match than Sally? It depends. The comedy ""Blind Date"" has a similar warning about basing your love on looks alone.",4,A Story About Disappointment in Love,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,3490,"['Human', 'Bondage', '1934', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'view', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Paris', 'man', 'studies', 'painting', 'wonders', 'should', 'continue', 'No', 'mediocre', 'study', 'medicine', 'London', 'see', 'St.', 'Bartholomew', 'Hospital', 'Barts', 'One', 'doctor', 'brusque', 'attitude', 'boy', 'club', 'foot', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'deformity', 'students', 'One', 'student', 'advice', 'love', 'Philip', 'young', 'woman', 'anemic', 'ill-natured', 'Philip', 'nice', 'smile', 'Philip', 'portrait', 'date', 'orders', 'champagne', 'meal', 'cold', 'Philip', 'dreams', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Emil', 'Miller', 'talks', 'Philip', 'advice', 'Mildred', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'theater', 'have', 'cruel', 'streak', 'Philip', 'thick', 'book', 'other', 'students', 'party', 'thinking', 'Mildred', 'exam', 'meet', 'again.The', 'other', 'students', 'say', 'Mildred', ""n't"", 'good', 'match', 'social', 'class', 'Mildred', 'will', 'marry', 'man', '24', 'getting', 'old', 'fellow', 'student', 'Philip', 'find', 'woman', 'Norah', 'who', 'romantic', 'stories', 'pulp', 'magazine', 'good', 'living', 'fantasies', 'young', 'woman', 'Philip', 'study', 'exams', 'too', 'sensitive', 'foot', 'One', 'day', 'visitor', 'Mildred', 'Emil', 'left', 'child', 'Mildred', 'pride', '[', 'Pride', 'one', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', ']', 'Philip', 'money', 'Emil', 'who', 'wife', 'child', 'Does', 'Philip', 'still', 'love', 'Mildred', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'Then', 'Norah', 'visit', 'learn', 'why', 'Philip', ""n't"", 'seen', 'How', 'could', 'Mildred', 'delivers', 'hospital', 'boyfriend', 'Harry', 'Mildred', 'nothing', 'Philip', 'quarrel', 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'when', 'Mildred', 'trip', 'Paris', 'Harry.But', 'Harry', 'Mildred', 'too', 'Philip', 'man', 'Charity', 'Hospital', 'Why', 'poor', 'Fast', 'women', 'slow', 'horses', 'testing', 'patient', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'later', 'visits', 'large', 'family', 'man', 'opinions', 'life', 'Sally', 'back', 'days', 'pass', 'Philip', 'returns', 'about', 'Mildred', 'problems', 'stay', 'place', 'go', 'Mildred', 'paintings', 'Philip', 'uncle', 'money', 'Mildred', 'out', 'insults', 'paintings', 'securities', 'meant', 'pay', 'education', 'must', 'leave', 'medical', 'school', 'first', 'operate', 'club', 'foot', 'Philip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'work', 'landlady', 'past', 'due', 'rent', 'out.Sally', 'father', 'stay', 'there', 'job', 'Philip', 'Mildred', 'Philip', 'coughing', 'time', 'lungs', '[', 'TB', 'was', 'fatal', 'disease', 'developed', 'antibiotics', 'Note', 'dark', 'make-up', 'Mildred', 'eyes', ']', 'Mildred', 'pleads', 'letter', 'Philip', 'uncle', 'died', 'will', 'get', 'small', 'inheritance', 'Philip', 'now', 'exams', 'Philip', 'job', 'steamship', 'line', 'Sally', 'love', 'When', 'will', 'marry', 'Sally', 'Mildred', 'Charity', 'Hospital', 'dying', 'Philip', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'job', 'Sally', 'marry', 'him.This', 'educational', 'drama', 'using', 'emotions', 'guide', 'behavior', 'Should', 'love', 'someone', 'when', 'best', 'interests', 'Would', 'Norah', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'match', 'Sally', 'comedy', 'Blind', 'Date', 'similar', 'warning', 'basing', 'love', 'alone']",Of Human Bondage VHS

Over-ripe acting?Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor, but here he is an idiot.  In scene after acene after scene Davis berates him unmercifully, and the unsuspecting audience (circa 1934) shivers as they have never seen a woman like this. It is NOT Davis' finest hour, but yet glimpse of what her power could do.  Who would put up with Davis' screeching and obvious mental illness?  Leslie Howard's character.  That's who.And Davis' English accent is one that any second grader could emulate/impersonate.It is Davis' ""wipe my mouth"" avalanche of a scene that some film-mongers remember, but this one scene alone (and she's great at it) doesn't make a film.

390101,A3Y6GNHCOER58,6303934552,Billie Mann,"[8, 9]","Bette Davis became a star with her role in this first and best film adaptation of the Somerset Maughan novel of the same name (well worth a read).  This was her first nomination for an Academy Award, for her portrayal of Mildred Rogers; a tawdry, sluttish, cockney waitress who bewitches hapless Philip Carey (Leslie Howard, best known for his role as Ashley Wilkes in ""Gone With the Wind"").  She lost the award, receiving it for her role the following year for ""Dangerous"", which is generally viewed as a consolation prize.The supporting cast includes Reginald Denny, Alan Hale Sr. (father of Alan Hale Jr., who was the skipper on the TV series ""Giligan's Isle""), and a breathtakingly beautiful Frances Dee.The film starts out with Philip, a failed art student with a clubfoot of which he is highly sensitive, turning to the study of medicine after facing the fact that he has no artistic talent. Shortly thereafter he meets and quickly becomes obsessed with Mildred, despite her sneering and obvious disdain for him because of his deformity. Her standard response to his affectionate overtures is a chilly ""I don't mind."" In his dreams Mildred is sweet and kind to him; during real time she uses him, well aware of his affection for her, leaving him for other men and returning when she is down on her luck, ruining his chance for having a career or a normal life with another woman; he seems to continually finds himself inexorably drawn to her, even after his love for her has waned, until the day she finally pushes him too far, and he says, ""You disgust me.""With those words, the camera fully turns to Mildred as her facial expression shifts from suppliance to surprise to full-on b**ch in a matter of seconds, and she reacts to Philip's statement with a barrage of blood-curdling insults.  Bette Davis as Mildred never fails to raise the hair on the back of my neck and arms with her performance in this particular scene.  Below is a link to hear a very small clip from it; of course to get the full effect you really have to see and hear the film, and this scene especially, in its entirety. This is the role that made Davis a star.

390103,A14XW8BJGEBM91,6303934552,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","William Somerset Maughan (1874-1965) was a famous British playwright and novelist, and it is said that he was the highest paid writer in the 1930s. During his lifetime, as well as afterwards, many of his stories were adapted to film, such as ""The Magician"" (1926), ""Sadie Thompson"" (1928), ""Secret Agent"" (1936), `The Letter"" (1940), ""The Razor's Edge"" (1946, 1984), and ""Being Julia"" (2004). The unforgettable ""Of Human Bondage,"" another one of his adaptations, is now available in a fabulous and essential Blu-ray edition, a must for any film lover or collector.The film stars Bette Davis -- who was loaned to RKO from Warner Brothers to make this film -- as Mildred, and Leslie Howard as Philip. Philip is an aspiring artist residing in Paris, where he is told that his work is mediocre. He also has another problem: he has a deformed foot.  Having to switch careers, he returns to his native England, where he decides to go to medical school, hoping that he can get a cure for his foot. One day, a friend from college asks him to help him with a girl, who works as a waitress in a local restaurant. The girl turns out to be Mildred, an attractive and flirtatious blond. In no time, it is Philip who falls for Mildred, and pursues her without any apparent luck. Eventually, Mildred ""corresponds"" to Philip's affection in her own way. You see, Mildred is ambitious and manipulative, and knowing how to seduce men, she also knows how to play with them - at least the weak ones. She is not a bright woman in choosing her men, always looking for somebody better - there is no space for sentimentality in her life. Sadly, Philip is deeply infatuated with her and doesn't want to let her go, drastically affecting his career and life. Slowly but surely, Philip will painfully learn the hard way.Ably directed by John Cromwell, ""Of Human Bondage"" will touch your heart. I am sure that many men have meet women like Mildred, and that many women have met men like Philip, and in every case both sexes suffer a lot. It is an unpleasant experience, well documented in this remarkable film. Bette Davis shines by masterfully combining sexuality with malevolence. The Blu-ray also features the documentary ""Revealing Mr. Maughan"" (2012), about the life of the distinguished writer.

Well directed by John Cromwell, it stars Leslie Howard as a young medical student who is hopelessly infatuated with a coarse waitress, played by Bette Davis in her breakthrough performance.Ever since the advent of home video, this movie - which was allowed to lapse into public domain decades ago - has been available only in duped, murky quality. Apparently the original camera negative is long gone, and even the best surviving 35mm prints aren't perfect. That said, Kino Lorber's Blu-ray of OF HUMAN BONDAGE, which was transferred to HD from 35mm elements held by the Library of Congress, easily beats out all previous DVD editions. There's a major improvement in sharpness and gray-range stability. As a result, details not noticeable before because of burned out whites and muddy blacks, really jump out. The downside of this transfer is that the print shows a lot of wear; white specks and scratches run through the film, and the audio, while clear, still contains some background hiss. Nevertheless, I feel the overall nice contrast level and detail clarity more than make up for any imperfections.The extra features include an excellent documentary on Somerset Maugham and trailers for a few other films from Kino Lorber.This is classic, vintage Davis and I, for one, am glad I upgraded on OF HUMAN BONDAGE.

390107,A3I6OV5JILAPMJ,6303934552,Curt Surly,"[5, 5]","This film offers excellent portraits of three very different women.  Each woman is connected to the clubfoot milquetoast Philip, played exquisitely by Leslie Howard.Norah (Kay Johnson) is a striking Nordic beauty.  She writes Romance novels under a male pseudonym.  She is strong, devoted and demonstrates her love for Philip by insisting that focus on his medical studies. This means nothing to Philip because Norah's love takes on mundane characteristics.  It isn't full of histrionics or morbid devotion.Sally (Frances Dee) is quite young and fickle in her way.  She seems fascinated with Philip and appears ""fond"" of him.  However, she lacks any passion whatsoever and comes across as merely a mirror image of Philip.  She's capable and strong, but ultimately dull. She's not the kind of girl one goes mad over or that causes one to nearly flunk out of medical school because he can't stop obsessing over her.Those afflictions attack our hero because of Mildred, famously played by Bette Davis and her flickering Cockney accent.  Mildred is unencumbered by almost every affectation expected in polite society of the well-bred woman.  Mildred is ill-bred, snotty, corrosive, opportunistic and terminally bored. Philip falls into the psycic sewer for her and she gives him nothing for his troubles but frustration and heartbreak.  He stupidly loves her and she sees it all to clearly.  She sees it as a weakness and despises him for it.The clubfoot plays an interesting psychological role in this film. There is suggestion that Philip suffers from a clubfoot of the mind--something that has emotionally crippled him and turned him into a pathetic ladies blouse who is quite unmanly in his inability to cast women aside when they no longer serve any purpose.Overall, it is difficult to recognize love in this film.  There is very little affection on screen.  Sex is, of course, only implied.There is a marvellous musical sequence that comes just after one of Mildred's many betrayals.  The music fits perfectly with Philip's wan dejection.  His depression is expressed with expert clarity, and it is a stunning moment in an thoroughly enjoyable film.",4,The Joseph Goebbels story this ain't!,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,2151,"['film', 'excellent', 'portraits', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'woman', 'connected', 'clubfoot', 'milquetoast', 'Philip', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Leslie', 'Howard.Norah', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'striking', 'Nordic', 'beauty', 'Romance', 'novels', 'male', 'pseudonym', 'strong', 'devoted', 'love', 'Philip', 'insisting', 'focus', 'medical', 'studies', 'nothing', 'Philip', 'Norah', 'love', 'mundane', 'characteristics', ""n't"", 'full', 'histrionics', 'morbid', 'devotion.Sally', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'quite', 'young', 'fickle', 'way', 'fascinated', 'Philip', 'fond', 'However', 'passion', 'whatsoever', 'across', 'merely', 'mirror', 'image', 'Philip', 'capable', 'strong', 'ultimately', 'dull', 'not', 'kind', 'girl', 'one', 'mad', 'one', 'nearly', 'flunk', 'medical', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'obsessing', 'her.Those', 'afflictions', 'attack', 'hero', 'Mildred', 'famously', 'played', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'flickering', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'Mildred', 'unencumbered', 'almost', 'affectation', 'expected', 'polite', 'society', 'well-bred', 'woman', 'Mildred', 'ill-bred', 'snotty', 'corrosive', 'opportunistic', 'terminally', 'bored', 'Philip', 'psycic', 'sewer', 'nothing', 'troubles', 'frustration', 'heartbreak', 'stupidly', 'clearly', 'weakness', 'it.The', 'clubfoot', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'role', 'film', 'suggestion', 'Philip', 'suffers', 'clubfoot', 'mind', 'something', 'emotionally', 'crippled', 'turned', 'pathetic', 'ladies', 'who', 'quite', 'unmanly', 'inability', 'cast', 'women', 'aside', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'serve', 'purpose.Overall', 'difficult', 'recognize', 'love', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'affection', 'screen', 'Sex', 'course', 'only', 'marvellous', 'musical', 'sequence', 'just', 'one', 'Mildred', 'many', 'betrayals', 'music', 'perfectly', 'Philip', 'wan', 'dejection', 'depression', 'expressed', 'expert', 'clarity', 'stunning', 'moment', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film']",Of Human Bondage VHS

390109,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303934552,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[21, 21]","Of Human Bondage, based on the novel by Somerset Maugham, is a powerful but melancholy film that I find strangely mesmerizing.  Leslie Howard stars as Philip Carey, an introverted, artistic man who comes to London to study medicine after abandoning his dreams of becoming an artist in Paris.  Carey was born with a club foot, and we watch rather mortified as one of his instructors makes him show his foot to the class, revealing the embarrassment that he normally keeps contained on the outside.  One day in a nearby caf&eacute;, Carey sees waitress Mildred Rogers (played fabulously by Bette Davis), a rather ill-natured, brazenly taciturn waitress.  Her attitude is rather rude and certainly strange and cold, but Carey is immediately fascinated by her.  After inexplicably falling in love with Mildred, he succeeds in winning a few dates with her, putting up with her mind games, deception, and seeming lack of humanity.  She is frustratingly noncommittal in everything he asks her, replying ""I don't mind"" to virtually all of his questions and allowing him almost no emotional contact with her at all.  He finally resolves to ask her to marry him, but she shocks him by declaring her impending nuptials to another man.  Carey's depression grows, and his grades in medical school suffer horribly.  In time, he finds a young woman who is a bit matronly but genuinely cares for him.  Then Mildred shows up again, pregnant and alone.  He takes care of her with money he doesn't really have only to see her leave again with another man.  This trend continues throughout the story.  Whenever Carey finds happiness within his grasp, Mildred shows up unannounced, and he finds himself powerless to save himself from her debilitating influence on him.Carey and Mildred are complicated creatures.  While Mildred basically comes off as an unfeeling tramp, one can't help but believe that there is something human inside her that is genuinely attracted to Carey and the kind of gentlemanly life he can offer her, but her affections continually prove themselves fickle at best.  As for Carey, his fatalistic love for Mildred makes no sense whatsoever, as she never fails to treat him harshly.  Other women do come to love him deeply and truly, and Sally, the daughter of one of his patients, seems perfect for him, yet one strongly senses the fact that he can only truly love Mildred.  It is really that part of the story and not the tragic life of Mildred herself which makes this movie so poignant and sad.Of Human Bondage is the movie that made Bette Davis a verifiable star way back in 1934.  Her performance is certainly fantastic, but she really provides only a hint of the actress she would become.  The fact that her character is so impossibly self-serving and unfeeling makes it hard to identify with or like her (especially when she gets angry), yet Bette Davis makes her an unforgettable character of almost hypnotic fascination.  I should say that Leslie Howard is also wonderful in this movie.  The kind of aloof passive resistance he showed five years later in Gone With the Wind is a perfect match for the character of Philip Carey.  He is almost incapable of standing up to fate, allowing his life to be brought to the point of ruin, both financial and emotional, by a woman who seemingly lives to torment him.  I'm always left with a strange feeling after watching this movie, one of strange disquiet and sentimentality.  Released in 1934, Of Human Bondage remains a powerful and compelling story of human passion, and Bette Davis' performance is eternally magical.",5,The fascinating film that made Bette Davis a star,1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,3574,"['Human', 'Bondage', 'based', 'novel', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'powerful', 'melancholy', 'film', 'find', 'strangely', 'mesmerizing', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'introverted', 'artistic', 'man', 'who', 'London', 'study', 'medicine', 'abandoning', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'artist', 'Paris', 'Carey', 'was', 'born', 'club', 'foot', 'watch', 'rather', 'mortified', 'one', 'instructors', 'show', 'foot', 'class', 'revealing', 'embarrassment', 'normally', 'contained', 'outside', 'One', 'day', 'nearby', 'caf', 'eacute', 'Carey', 'waitress', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'played', 'fabulously', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'rather', 'ill-natured', 'brazenly', 'taciturn', 'waitress', 'attitude', 'rather', 'rude', 'certainly', 'strange', 'cold', 'Carey', 'immediately', 'fascinated', 'inexplicably', 'falling', 'love', 'Mildred', 'winning', 'few', 'dates', 'putting', 'up', 'mind', 'games', 'deception', 'seeming', 'lack', 'humanity', 'frustratingly', 'noncommittal', 'everything', 'replying', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'virtually', 'questions', 'allowing', 'almost', 'emotional', 'contact', 'finally', 'ask', 'marry', 'declaring', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'man', 'Carey', 'depression', 'grows', 'grades', 'medical', 'school', 'suffer', 'horribly', 'time', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'bit', 'matronly', 'genuinely', 'cares', 'Then', 'Mildred', 'up', 'again', 'pregnant', 'alone', 'care', 'money', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'only', 'see', 'leave', 'again', 'man', 'trend', 'story', 'Whenever', 'Carey', 'happiness', 'grasp', 'Mildred', 'up', 'unannounced', 'powerless', 'save', 'debilitating', 'influence', 'him.Carey', 'Mildred', 'are', 'complicated', 'creatures', 'Mildred', 'basically', 'off', 'unfeeling', 'tramp', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'something', 'human', 'genuinely', 'attracted', 'Carey', 'kind', 'gentlemanly', 'life', 'can', 'offer', 'affections', 'continually', 'prove', 'fickle', 'best', 'Carey', 'fatalistic', 'love', 'Mildred', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'never', 'treat', 'harshly', 'Other', 'women', 'do', 'come', 'love', 'deeply', 'truly', 'Sally', 'daughter', 'one', 'patients', 'perfect', 'yet', 'one', 'strongly', 'fact', 'can', 'only', 'truly', 'love', 'Mildred', 'really', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'tragic', 'life', 'Mildred', 'movie', 'so', 'poignant', 'sad.Of', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'movie', 'made', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'verifiable', 'star', 'way', 'back', '1934', 'performance', 'certainly', 'fantastic', 'really', 'only', 'hint', 'actress', 'would', 'become', 'fact', 'character', 'so', 'impossibly', 'self-serving', 'unfeeling', 'hard', 'identify', 'especially', 'when', 'angry', 'yet', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'fascination', 'should', 'say', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'also', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'kind', 'aloof', 'passive', 'resistance', 'showed', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'perfect', 'match', 'character', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'almost', 'incapable', 'standing', 'up', 'fate', 'allowing', 'life', 'be', 'brought', 'point', 'ruin', 'financial', 'emotional', 'woman', 'who', 'seemingly', 'torment', ""'m"", 'always', 'left', 'strange', 'feeling', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'strange', 'disquiet', 'sentimentality', 'Released', '1934', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'story', 'human', 'passion', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'performance', 'eternally', 'magical']",Of Human Bondage VHS
390110,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6303934552,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","For actress Bette Davis, by 1934, while having shot nearly two dozen films in the last three years, she was not yet a well-known actress.  While gaining attention for her lead role in ""The Man Who Played God"" in 1932 and eventually receiving a five-year contract from Warner Bros., the young actress still hoped for that one breakthrough role that would put her on the map.And in 1934, thanks to screenwriter Wilson Mizner who showed her a copy of W. Somerset Maugham's novel ""Of Human Bondage"", she was adamant that she wanted the part, so much that she asked Jack L. Warner to lend her to RKO who held the screen rights.There was one problem.  The part that Bette Davis wanted to play was an image of an evil woman and Warner did not want his beautiful actress playing such a part.  In fact, Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne and Ann Harding declined to play the role because of the character.  But eventually, Warner decided to let Davis plan the role of Mildred Rogers.A role that would eventually put Bette Davis on the map and the film would receive critical acclaim.  While not nominated for an Academy Award, ""The Hollywood Citizen News"" questioned her omission form nominations and even actress Norma Shearer who was nominated that year, lent her support to have Davis nominated for her role.  And because of the outcry for Davis to have a chance of nomination, in the only time of the Academy's history, they allowed any voter to write a name on the ballot of his or her personal choice for the winners but would also lead to a chance in Academy voting procedures for the following year.And now ""Of Human Bondage"" will receive it's Blu-ray release courtesy of Kino Lorber.  The film is mastered in HD from an original 35 mm print from Bette Davis's personal collection (and was donated to the Library of Congress), will be released for the first time on Blu-ray in June 2013 with another Bette Davis Blu-ray release of her earlier film ""Hell's House"" (1932).""Of Human Bondage"" is a film directed by John Cromwell (""Since You Went Away"", ""Made for Each Other"", ""The Prisoner of Zenda"") and would star Bette Davis, Leslie Howard (""Gone with the Wind"", ""Pygmalion"", ""The Petrified Forest""), Frances Dee (""Little Women"", ""Becky Sharp"", ""I Walked with a Zombie""), Kay Johnson (""Madam Satan"", ""American Madness"", ""Dynamite"") and Reginald Denny (""Rebecca"", ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"",""Cat Ballou"").The film begins with an introduction to Philip Carey (portrayed by Leslie Howard), a man with a club-foot and a man who studied painting in Paris, but told by an art teacher that his paintings are not that good.  He advises him to put his talent to something different and so, Philip goes to medical school in London.  Not having much money, he is assisted by his uncle who sends him money to attend schooling and help pay for his apartment.While a bit self-conscious about his foot, he does have time to hang out with a few of his medical buddies.  One who asks Philip to assist in telling a joke to a waitress that he fancies.When Philip and friend go to the restaurant, both are surprised to find out that the tearoom waitress, Mildred Rogers (portrayed by Bette Davis) is quite vulgar and lewd.  This turns his friend off but for Philip, he is enamored by her beauty and bluntness.And he becomes obsessed with her, so much that he keeps asking her for a date, following her, going to the restaurant and seeing how she also dates other male patrons that show up to the restaurant but for Philip, he wants her to be with him only.  No matter how cruel she is towards him (and is not even attracted to him), he is too blind by his love for her.Unfortunately, his obsession with Mildred begins to affect his medical studies and when he decides he wants to marry Mildred, she tells him that she is marrying another Emil Miller (portrayed by Alan Hale) and tells him to stop following her, insults him and his club-foot and more.As time goes on, Philip meets another woman named Norah (portrayed by Kay Johnson), a successful romance writer who truly loves him.  And just when things are going well for Philip, Mildred once again shows up in his life.  Asking for his help because Emil had left her and now she is pregnant with his baby and nowhere to go.With his feelings towards Mildred still strong, Philip breaks up with Norah and lets Mildred live with him and takes care of her financially.But the fact is that Mildred is only using Philip and her disdain towards him is still the same. But feeling that she can use him may lead to destroying Philip's life, but can this man survive this unfortunate fate?VIDEO:""Of Human Bondage"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and in black and white. or a film that is 80-years-old, I was quite pleased with the picture quality as the white and grays were well-contrast.  The black levels were good but it's the detail that looks impressive.  Having seen the public domain of this film, to watch this film in HD makes a tremendous difference.  The clarity and detail is much more evident, no blurriness or flickering.  Picture quality was very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Of Human Bondange"" is presented in LPCM 1.0 monaural. Dialogue was clear and dialogue was not difficult to understand whatsoever. I don't recall hearing any significant hissing, cracks or pops during my viewing of the film but for the most part, I was quite pleased by the lossless soundtrack and that it was not terrible, tinny, nor did it feature a lot of hiss.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Of Human Bondage"" comes with the following special feature:Revealing Mr. Maugham - (83 minutes) A feature-length 2012 documentary directed by Michael House about British playwright/novelist W. Somerset Maugham's life and career with interview with writers and fans Armisted Maupin, Pico Iyer and Alexander McCall.JUDGMENT CALL:""Of Human Bondage"" is considered to be a film that launched Bette Davis' career.Having read Bette Davis' biographies and seeing how she really fought to play a role that no one wanted, watching it today, you realize how the character role of Mildred Rogers could not be played by anyone else but ""Mother Goddam"", Bette Davis.Way before Joan Collins would play the ""mega-bitch"" character on television's ""Dynasty"" and other women who would play the role of lewd, amoral women in soap operas, going far back into early cinema, we have seen how women known as ""vamps"" were portrayed as golddiggers and amoral women who would do anything to suck out the life of an unsuspecting male.  Actress Theda Bara was a highlight of such style of cinema back in the teens, but by 1930&#8242;s, Hollywood Studios would not allow their top actresses to play such a part.  Many up-and-rising stars denied to play such a role for ""Of Human Bondage"" but for actress Bette Davis, she wanted it and she got it!While she did not receive an Academy Award for her role, the shocking role of this uncaring woman would captivate viewers.  Unlike Theda Bara in ""A Fool There Was"" who used her sexuality to get her man or even Margaret Livingston's role in ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"", sexuality was a way to show a weakness in a man.For ""Of Human Bondage"", the character of Mildred is not flirtatious or sympathetic towards Philip, she is blunt, insulting mean but also knows that his weakness for her can be used against him, anyway she sees fit.She is a femme fatale, a woman of contempt and playing him can get her free housing, free clothes and trying to play this facade of being kind to him but not afraid to unleash her emotions of contempt for the gullible medical student.For any man watching this film, one can only hope that he comes to his senses and realize that there are better women out there for him and that he would up from his curse of unrequited love.Sure, modern viewers will see Mildred as a golddigger who was able to play and capitalize on a weak man.  But back in the day, such attitude and lewdness for a woman on a big screen was a big risk for major studios, but one actress was no afraid of how Hollywood would think of her, she wanted the part and she received wonderful acclaim for it.  ""Life"" Magazine even wrote that Davis gave ""probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress"".The film is rather significant for not only Bette Davis' role in the film but how this one role led to outcry in the entertainment circles and would lead to the Academy's changing its voting procedures for the next year.  So, in American cinema, ""Of Human Bondage"" does have its place in cinema history, not much for being a great Bette Davis film but more for what it did for Bette Davis' career.  It's the film that put Bette Davis on the map and the United States would finally know her name.  It was a calculated risk by Bette Davis and Warner Bros. and it paid off.  It made this actress a star!The following year, Bette Davis would win an Academy Award for her role in ""Dangerous"" and again in 1938 for ""Jezebel"".""Of Human Bondage"" would also receive two more film adaptations (one in 1946 and another in 1964) and for author W. Somerset Maugham, many novels he had written would receive several dozen of film adaptations with the most recent films ""Being Julia"" (2004) and ""The Painted Veil"" (2006).As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic.  For anyone who had watched the terrible public domain version of the film, the Blu-ray features much better clarity and detail.  Unlike the public domain, the picture quality of this film is not scratched up, no flicker and this is the best I have ever seen ""Of Human Bondage"" ever!  I am quite pleased with how much better this film looks on Blu-ray!  And the lossless audio of the film is also very good with no major hiss, crackling, pops nor tinny vocals.  Dialogue is clear.  And Kino also included an 83-minute documentary for ""Revealing Mr. Maugham"" about W. Somerset Maugham's life and career.Overall, ""Of Human Bondage"" is a significant film in the career of Bette Davis, it's also a significant film for how it made changes with the Academy's voting procedures and it's the best looking version of the film to date.  If you are a film of classic Hollywood films or a fan of Bette Davis' work, ""Of Human Bondage"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",4,"If you are a film of classic Hollywood films or a fan of Bette

390113,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6303934552,Douglas M,"[5, 5]","""Of Human Bondage"" is a long novel which is said to contain many biographical elements from the life of its author W Somerset Maugham.  RKO filmed many such novels in the early to mid thirties.  The films were always literate and slow moving and often directed by John Cromwell. This movie focuses on a section of the novel when the disabled Philip Carey falls in lust with the sluttish waitress Mildred Rogers. For those who have read and enjoyed the novel, the film captures it very well. For those who have not, the film will seem talky and turgid.Leslie Howard is perfectly cast as Philip but Bette Davis wipes him off the celluloid as Mildred.  In 1934, Davis's style, where she acts with every pore of her body, her stance, her eyes and even her inexpert Cockney accent were a revelation which shocked the critics and public.  Nothing like this had even been seen before.  For some of the audience at the time, the film was considered ""dirty"" because Davis's character was so repellant and Howard's obsession with her was masochistic.Cromwell uses a plethora of close ups to study the faces of the cast and it is very effective.  There is also a lovely Max Steiner theme which permeates the drama. The film also benefits from a first rate supporting cast.  Kay Johnson creates a fully realised character in just a few scenes as a girl who falls for Howard in between his interludes with Davis.  There is a memorable moment when she leans against a door and delivers a piece of dialogue which makes your heart bleed.  The contrast to the raw Davis is very effective.  The young Frances Dee, the girl with whom Howard ends the film, is also very effective and breathtakingly beautiful.  The sets also capture the dreary atmosphere of grey England with small cluttered apartments and rain soaked weather.The climax of the film is the diatribe which Davis delivers to Howard.  It still resonates with the power which Davis generates.  It is shocking and perverse, an extraordinary scene for 1934 Hollywood.The DVD print I have has been digitally restored and is by far the best copy of the film I have ever seen and very good, given that the negative of the film has long been lost. The other ""so called"" extras are a short essay on Davis and her films which is so inaccurate to be hilarious.",4,Antique melodrama with ground breaking performance,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,2294,"['Human', 'Bondage', 'long', 'novel', 'said', 'contain', 'many', 'biographical', 'elements', 'life', 'author', 'W', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'RKO', 'filmed', 'many', 'such', 'novels', 'early', 'mid', 'thirties', 'films', 'were', 'always', 'literate', 'slow', 'moving', 'often', 'directed', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'movie', 'section', 'novel', 'when', 'disabled', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'lust', 'sluttish', 'waitress', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'novel', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'talky', 'turgid.Leslie', 'Howard', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Philip', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'off', 'celluloid', 'Mildred', '1934', 'Davis', 'style', 'where', 'pore', 'body', 'stance', 'eyes', 'even', 'inexpert', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'were', 'revelation', 'shocked', 'critics', 'public', 'Nothing', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'seen', 'audience', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'dirty', 'Davis', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'repellant', 'Howard', 'obsession', 'was', 'masochistic.Cromwell', 'plethora', 'close', 'ups', 'study', 'cast', 'very', 'effective', 'also', 'lovely', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'theme', 'drama', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'first', 'rate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'fully', 'realised', 'character', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'girl', 'who', 'Howard', 'interludes', 'Davis', 'memorable', 'moment', 'when', 'door', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'heart', 'bleed', 'contrast', 'raw', 'Davis', 'very', 'effective', 'young', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'girl', 'whom', 'Howard', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'also', 'capture', 'dreary', 'atmosphere', 'grey', 'England', 'small', 'cluttered', 'apartments', 'rain', 'soaked', 'weather.The', 'climax', 'film', 'diatribe', 'Davis', 'delivers', 'Howard', 'still', 'power', 'Davis', 'shocking', 'perverse', 'extraordinary', 'scene', '1934', 'Hollywood.The', 'DVD', 'print', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'restored', 'far', 'best', 'copy', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'good', 'given', 'negative', 'film', 'long', 'been', 'lost', 'other', 'so', 'called', 'extras', 'are', 'short', 'essay', 'Davis', 'films', 'so', 'inaccurate', 'be', 'hilarious']",Of Human Bondage VHS

390115,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,6303934552,.fgd,"[1, 3]","There was no way that I expected this film to come close to Somerset Maughan's wonderful novel and it didn't.  There is so much background in the novel whereas the film just plays tennis between abuser and victim between man and woman. . But I enjoyed the casting of Leslie Howard and Bette Davis. Howard is quintisentially the english gentleman and fits the part; at one point Davis gazes like a vixen over her glass of champagne and mocks him with Those Eyes like no other actress could in the same role. So perfect!!However Bette Davis had a cockney accent that jarred throughout the whole film. Even if it was a cockney accent with airs it was still horribly phoney. Consummate actress that she was, she was quite capable of giving a convincing accent; I suppose The Studios were too squeamish to allow such low-classness to be associated with the glamour of film-makingWhen she appeared in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane, there was a cockney lady in it played by the same actress they always kept digging up for the role. She wouldn't do cockney for real either; I dont even think she was english. So the genuine cockney voice was a problem,  in general , in early films. Yet Bette Davis hamming it up when Mildren opens her mouth is a true distraction.The other squeamish thing about early films is the sex thing if it wasn't done tastefully and Philip's attraction to Mildren needed some hint of sexual yearning despite his projections. Of course Mildred sees through the awardness right from the start and Davis is bold in this respect. But Leslie Howard's performance fails to hint at his subverted manhood explicitly enough. Maybe I am just projecting modern expectations onto an old film but its over-delicacy does seem dated. If it was only a romance, it would get away with it but Mildred IS ultimately an escape clause for a young toff like Philip due to her low-class because a woman of his own class would be off-limits to his fantasies; undefined to him as they are.These under-currents, tactfully handled,would have enhanced the film greatly but weren't addressed by Howard. Although a 1930's audience would no doubt have been busy filling in the omission.Lovely to see scenes of London when it was still influenced by Edwardian customs and its architecture was untouched by post-war demolition. In this way it is a rewarding period film and Lesley Howard and Bette Davis are captivating.",3,nice film but flawed,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2407,"['was', 'way', 'expected', 'film', 'come', 'close', 'Somerset', 'Maughan', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'background', 'novel', 'film', 'just', 'tennis', 'abuser', 'victim', 'man', 'woman', 'enjoyed', 'casting', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Howard', 'quintisentially', 'english', 'gentleman', 'part', 'one', 'point', 'Davis', 'vixen', 'glass', 'champagne', 'mocks', 'Eyes', 'other', 'actress', 'could', 'same', 'role', 'perfect', 'However', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'had', 'cockney', 'accent', 'jarred', 'whole', 'film', 'Even', 'was', 'cockney', 'accent', 'airs', 'was', 'still', 'horribly', 'phoney', 'Consummate', 'actress', 'was', 'was', 'quite', 'capable', 'giving', 'convincing', 'accent', 'suppose', 'Studios', 'were', 'too', 'squeamish', 'allow', 'such', 'low-classness', 'be', 'associated', 'glamour', 'film-makingWhen', 'appeared', 'What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'was', 'cockney', 'lady', 'played', 'same', 'actress', 'always', 'kept', 'digging', 'up', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'cockney', 'real', 'dont', 'even', 'think', 'was', 'english', 'genuine', 'cockney', 'voice', 'was', 'problem', 'general', 'early', 'films', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'hamming', 'up', 'when', 'Mildren', 'mouth', 'true', 'distraction.The', 'other', 'squeamish', 'thing', 'early', 'films', 'sex', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'tastefully', 'Philip', 'attraction', 'Mildren', 'needed', 'hint', 'sexual', 'yearning', 'projections', 'course', 'Mildred', 'awardness', 'right', 'start', 'Davis', 'bold', 'respect', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'performance', 'hint', 'subverted', 'manhood', 'explicitly', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'projecting', 'modern', 'expectations', 'old', 'film', 'over-delicacy', 'seem', 'dated', 'was', 'only', 'romance', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'Mildred', 'IS', 'ultimately', 'escape', 'clause', 'young', 'toff', 'Philip', 'due', 'low-class', 'woman', 'own', 'class', 'would', 'be', 'off-limits', 'fantasies', 'undefined', 'are.These', 'under-currents', 'tactfully', 'handled', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'film', 'greatly', 'were', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'Howard', '1930', 'audience', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'been', 'busy', 'filling', 'omission.Lovely', 'see', 'scenes', 'London', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'influenced', 'Edwardian', 'customs', 'architecture', 'was', 'untouched', 'post-war', 'demolition', 'way', 'rewarding', 'period', 'film', 'Lesley', 'Howard', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'are', 'captivating']",Of Human Bondage VHS

The story told here represents about one fourth of the Maugham novel, dissipating the impact immensely. This movie had to be severely edited, even more so than the disastrous ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" done earlier doing both a disservice to Maugham and his invention. Obviously here it became the star vehicle for Bette Davis; while in the novel, her character embodies all the weaknesses of her sex, vanity, selfishness, unbridled predatory sensuality into one, the character is balanced by other charming females not delineated in the film. If a literate mind had enough sense to present the ""Elephant Man"" in sympathetic treatment, surely another could transform the lengthy ""Of Human Bondage"" novel into a cinema gem. While the movie focuses on the female predicament, the driving force of the crippled orphaned character(Leslie Howard)presented here becomes nothing more than resentment or Victorian sexual frustration, which falls way short of the true driving force to the novel which contains marvelous Dickensian supporting characters who realize the single-minded charm to this cripple deserves an invisible lift in his life. In this movie there is no ascent to the lead character who's always chasing after cheapness, mired in self-loathing, so that Bette Davis's star can rise.",2,Where's the beef?

Menta, Jr.","[15, 16]","If you take into account when this film was made and that the film medium was still developing its language, you'll likely enjoy ""Of Human Bondage"".  It's well acted and- with its wide array of ""let's see what we can do"" directorial tricks and flourishes- entertainingly told.Leslie Howard gives a low-key, effective performance, but it's Bette Davis who really shines.  Ms. Davis realized correctly that it should be somewhat confusing to the other characters- and to us- why Leslie Howard's Philip character is so taken with her character, so she grounds her character with a kind of plainness and commonality.  But she also realizes that there should be SOMETHING that we as viewers can touch on, so we can at least somewhat understand what is going on inside Philip.  So Ms. Davis peppers the plainness of her character with occasional glints of edge, ice, passion, etc., things that a man would notice and be moved by, both in a positive and negative manner.  These little glints of uniqueness nicely build to an emotional explosion at the end, so the quiet waitress and schemer doesn't all of a sudden become the bitter harpy who is so memorable at the end.  It's a really effective performance, taking into account the future progression of the character right from the beginning.Now the bad news.  This particular DVD of the Bette Davis/Leslie Howard ""Of Human Bondage"" (the DVD company is called ""Westlake"") delivers a truly sub-par copy of this historic movie.  It's watchable, but- with its faded print and scratchy soundtrack- barely so.

Somerset Maugham's novel &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; receives an excellent adaptation to the screen in this 1934 film directed by John Cromwell. Leslie Howard plays sensitive, club-footed Philip Carey, the second-rate artist who turns to the study of medicine, even though he is older than his classmates. Philip becomes tragically obsessed with Mildred Rogers (Bette Davis), an illiterate waitress in a tearoom near the medical school. Although Mildred insults him for being a cripple, Philip spurns an offer of romance from Nora (Kay Johnson), an attractive woman who writes romance novels under a male pseudonym. When Philips agrees to marry Mildred when she shows up pregnant and jilted by her salesman boyfriend (Alan Hale), she runs off with another med student (Reginald Denny) at their engagement party. A friendly patient (Reginald Owen) invites Philip home to meet his sensitive daughter Sally (Frances Dee). But Mildred returns again, this time with a baby, and Philip is too weak to refuse her. The result are disastrous consequences for them both.Maugham's semi-autobiographical novel was published in 1915 and is considered his masterwork. By Hollywood standards, this film adaptation is remarkably faithful, not to mention literate and intelligent, so a lot of the credit has to go to Lester Cohen for the screenplay. Howard handles the role of the sensitive Philip well, but it is Davis who turned a lot of heads for the first time with her performance as the tawdry little waitress (Life magazine called it &quot;Probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress&quot;). Certainly this is the role that made Warner Brothers take a serious look at the young actress. What is remarkable is how much of this emotionally shattering tale is packed into 83 minutes of running time.",5,Howard and Davis in a great adaptation of Maugham's novel,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,1822,"['W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'quot', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'quot', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'screen', '1934', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'sensitive', 'club-footed', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'second-rate', 'artist', 'who', 'study', 'medicine', 'even', 'older', 'classmates', 'Philip', 'tragically', 'obsessed', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'illiterate', 'waitress', 'tearoom', 'medical', 'school', 'Mildred', 'insults', 'being', 'cripple', 'Philip', 'offer', 'romance', 'Nora', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'romance', 'novels', 'male', 'pseudonym', 'When', 'Philips', 'marry', 'Mildred', 'when', 'up', 'pregnant', 'jilted', 'salesman', 'boyfriend', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'med', 'student', 'Reginald', 'Denny', 'engagement', 'party', 'friendly', 'patient', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'Philip', 'home', 'meet', 'sensitive', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'Mildred', 'returns', 'again', 'time', 'baby', 'Philip', 'too', 'weak', 'refuse', 'result', 'are', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'both.Maugham', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'was', 'published', '1915', 'considered', 'masterwork', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'film', 'adaptation', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'not', 'mention', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'lot', 'credit', 'go', 'Lester', 'Cohen', 'screenplay', 'Howard', 'role', 'sensitive', 'Philip', 'well', 'Davis', 'who', 'turned', 'lot', 'heads', 'first', 'time', 'performance', 'tawdry', 'little', 'waitress', 'Life', 'magazine', 'called', 'quot', 'Probably', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'recorded', 'screen', 'U.S.', 'actress', 'quot', 'Certainly', 'role', 'made', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'take', 'serious', 'look', 'young', 'actress', 'What', 'remarkable', 'how', 'much', 'emotionally', 'shattering', 'tale', 'packed', '83', 'minutes', 'running', 'time']",Of Human Bondage VHS
390124,A42QN9MM6LKKM,6303934552,Lee in S.F.,"[0, 1]","In this story of twisted love, Leslie Howard's character, Philip, exudes the demeanor of a decent and kind human being.  It's like Howard was made for this role.  While the Betty Davis character, Mildred, is described in the movie notes as brash and shrill (which she is), Davis over-acts the part when we first meet her.  Her portrayal (for that part) wasn't at all believable, and I wondered why her director didn't know that.  Luckily, however, when Davis re-appears thereafter, most all of that over-acting is gone, and Davis' real talents get showcased.  Considering that this was her first movie, it's evident here already that she's the ""real deal.""Phillip falls for Mildred HARD, which mystifies the viewer.  He's seemingly undaunted by her crude treatment of him.  How baffling it is to see him dodging her insults and disrespect, only to follow up with a marriage proposal.  Does the story infer that choosing her is a form of self-punishment for desiring a career he's told he has no gift for?  Or, are we as viewers supposed to ""understand"" that his so-called deformity (club foot), has led him to regard himself as but half a man?  More than once in the movie the viewers are shown the shame Philip carries for his large, ungainly foot.Mildred is a user through and through, and scarcely tries to hide it.  She's out only for herself.  At one point, Philip describes their connection as fitting the ""usual"" case where one partner cares more about the other, than the other cares about them.  It's a declaration of refusal to confront that Mildred is incapable of caring about anyone.  He may say things which imply that he knows this, but still, Mildred gets under his skin continually, and he can't get her out.  So fixated on Mildred is he, that when a wonderful woman, Norah, makes known her love for him, he casts their connection aside for more of Mildred's abuse.All of the above unfolds fairly early in the movie.In what comes thereafter, Philip's worrisome tendencies, combined with Mildred's predatory nature, propel the plot forward with many twists and turns.  The pace of this compelling story moves along quickly enough that I didn't want to miss even a scene.  Howard and Davis are terrific performers here (such that I'd like to see such excellent acting show up more in current era movies!). The supporting players are well-cast, adding depth and interest to what happens.  Ultimately, Philip becomes aware of something that leads to a realization.  Mildred has a life-changing experience herself.Maugham is a masterful story teller and a keen observer of human nature.  Through the written word, no doubt Maugham was able to do a more substantial and nuanced job of fleshing out the evolution of Philip's inner life, than this film did.  Even so, the movie and its fine cast convey the salient elements of that story.  It's a film that's definitely worth seeing.",5,"A memorable story, masterfully acted",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2892,"['story', 'twisted', 'love', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'character', 'Philip', 'demeanor', 'decent', 'kind', 'human', 'being', 'Howard', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'character', 'Mildred', 'described', 'movie', 'notes', 'brash', 'shrill', 'Davis', 'part', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'portrayal', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'wondered', 'why', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Luckily', 'however', 'when', 'Davis', 're-appears', 'thereafter', 'most', 'over-acting', 'gone', 'Davis', 'real', 'talents', 'get', 'showcased', 'Considering', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'evident', 'here', 'already', 'real', 'deal', 'Phillip', 'Mildred', 'HARD', 'viewer', 'seemingly', 'undaunted', 'crude', 'treatment', 'How', 'baffling', 'see', 'dodging', 'insults', 'disrespect', 'only', 'follow', 'up', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'story', 'infer', 'choosing', 'form', 'self-punishment', 'desiring', 'career', 'told', 'gift', 'are', 'viewers', 'supposed', 'understand', 'so-called', 'deformity', 'club', 'foot', 'led', 'regard', 'man', 'More', 'once', 'movie', 'viewers', 'are', 'shown', 'shame', 'Philip', 'large', 'ungainly', 'foot.Mildred', 'user', 'scarcely', 'tries', 'hide', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'point', 'Philip', 'connection', 'fitting', 'usual', 'case', 'where', 'one', 'partner', 'more', 'other', 'other', 'cares', 'declaration', 'refusal', 'confront', 'Mildred', 'incapable', 'caring', 'anyone', 'may', 'say', 'things', 'imply', 'still', 'Mildred', 'skin', 'continually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'So', 'fixated', 'Mildred', 'when', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'Norah', 'known', 'love', 'connection', 'aside', 'more', 'Mildred', 'abuse.All', 'above', 'unfolds', 'fairly', 'early', 'movie.In', 'what', 'thereafter', 'Philip', 'worrisome', 'tendencies', 'combined', 'Mildred', 'predatory', 'nature', 'propel', 'plot', 'forward', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'pace', 'compelling', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'even', 'scene', 'Howard', 'Davis', 'are', 'terrific', 'performers', 'here', 'such', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'such', 'excellent', 'acting', 'show', 'up', 'more', 'current', 'era', 'movies', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'well-cast', 'adding', 'depth', 'interest', 'what', 'Ultimately', 'Philip', 'aware', 'something', 'realization', 'Mildred', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'herself.Maugham', 'masterful', 'story', 'teller', 'keen', 'observer', 'human', 'nature', 'written', 'word', 'doubt', 'Maugham', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'substantial', 'nuanced', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'evolution', 'Philip', 'inner', 'life', 'film', 'did', 'Even', 'so', 'movie', 'fine', 'cast', 'convey', 'salient', 'elements', 'story', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Of Human Bondage VHS

390129,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6303934552,Martin Asiner,"[7, 7]","Those who have read Maughm's OF HUMAN BONDAGE agree that the greatness of the book is focused on the tight yet oddly bound relation of Phillip Carey to Mildred Rogers.  The 1934 version intensifies the electricity between the club-footed Phillip (Leslie Howard) and the sluttish Mildred (Bette Davis).  It is not immediately apparent that there is a connection between them that cannot be explained away as blind infatuation on Phillip's part or mean-spirited golddigging on Mildred's.  Howard plays Phillip as a man who has suffered all his life.  He was born with a club foot for which his childhood companions unmercifully ridiculed him.  His shy, overly sensitive nature did not permit him to rebound from these rebukes.  Instead, he sought refuge in a world of dream-filled books. He knew nothing of the kind of woman that Mildred was when she stepped into his life as a cheap waitress in a cheap restaurant.  Miss Davis also plays Mildred as one who has been raked over the coals of mean-spirited men.  But in her case, her good looks combined with her low-caste breeding practically guaranteed her unchivalrous treatment by the very kind of those men who either used her or were in turn used by her.  Phillip sees in Mildred the passion that he lacks.  She sees in him yet another opportunity to lash back at a world that contained only pain for her.  Nearly as soon, as Mildred begins dating Phillip, she dates others, and does not even try to hide her infidelities.  Alan Hale and Reginald Denny sparkle in the roles of men who show no shame in lowering the already low esteem of Phillip Carey.  Most of the film details the same dreary rounds of Mildred's breaking Phillip's heart with unspeakably cruel actions, leaving him for another, getting dumped by those others, and returning contritely to Phillip.  Phillip takes her back even after he has found some happiness with other women.Director John Cromwell presents a view of two people who seem radically unlike in everything that ought to count in a relation, yet in her desire to lash out in a rage fueled by no self-esteem and in his desire to accept that abuse because of his own esteem issues, OF HUMAN BONDAGE indelibly portrays the destruction that results when one human forms a bondage with another all for the wrong reasons.",4,Mildred and Phillip: More Alike Than You Think,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,2298,"['who', 'have', 'read', 'Maughm', 'OF', 'HUMAN', 'BONDAGE', 'agree', 'greatness', 'book', 'focused', 'tight', 'yet', 'oddly', 'bound', 'relation', 'Phillip', 'Carey', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', '1934', 'version', 'electricity', 'club-footed', 'Phillip', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'sluttish', 'Mildred', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'connection', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'blind', 'infatuation', 'Phillip', 'part', 'mean-spirited', 'golddigging', 'Mildred', 'Howard', 'Phillip', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'life', 'was', 'born', 'club', 'foot', 'childhood', 'companions', 'unmercifully', 'ridiculed', 'shy', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'did', 'not', 'permit', 'rebound', 'rebukes', 'Instead', 'sought', 'refuge', 'world', 'dream-filled', 'books', 'knew', 'nothing', 'kind', 'woman', 'Mildred', 'was', 'when', 'stepped', 'life', 'cheap', 'waitress', 'cheap', 'restaurant', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'also', 'Mildred', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'raked', 'coals', 'mean-spirited', 'men', 'case', 'good', 'looks', 'combined', 'low-caste', 'breeding', 'practically', 'guaranteed', 'unchivalrous', 'treatment', 'very', 'kind', 'men', 'who', 'used', 'were', 'turn', 'used', 'Phillip', 'Mildred', 'passion', 'yet', 'opportunity', 'lash', 'back', 'world', 'contained', 'only', 'pain', 'Nearly', 'as', 'soon', 'Mildred', 'dating', 'Phillip', 'others', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'hide', 'infidelities', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Reginald', 'Denny', 'sparkle', 'roles', 'men', 'who', 'show', 'shame', 'lowering', 'already', 'low', 'esteem', 'Phillip', 'Carey', 'Most', 'film', 'details', 'same', 'dreary', 'rounds', 'Mildred', 'breaking', 'Phillip', 'heart', 'unspeakably', 'cruel', 'actions', 'leaving', 'getting', 'dumped', 'others', 'returning', 'contritely', 'Phillip', 'Phillip', 'back', 'even', 'found', 'happiness', 'other', 'women.Director', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'view', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'radically', 'everything', 'ought', 'count', 'relation', 'yet', 'desire', 'lash', 'out', 'rage', 'fueled', 'self-esteem', 'desire', 'accept', 'abuse', 'own', 'esteem', 'issues', 'OF', 'HUMAN', 'BONDAGE', 'indelibly', 'destruction', 'results', 'when', 'one', 'human', 'bondage', 'wrong', 'reasons']",Of Human Bondage VHS
390130,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6303934552,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Bette Davis and Leslie Howard star in Of Human Bondage, the screen adaptation of a novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting is thoroughly convincing throughout. As others may have told you already, Bette Davis gives a spellbinding, exceptionally good performance as the immoral, petty, cruel and manipulative Mildred Rogers. This is one movie you HAVE to see!The action starts when Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) returns to London from Paris after realizing that he is not meant to be an artist. Upon his return to his native London, he meets a waitress named Mildred Rogers (Bette Davis). Mildred is colder than ice toward Philip; but Philip has such a low self esteem because of his club foot that he actually believes that Mildred is the best woman he could ever get.As time goes by Philip truly falls in love with Mildred despite the fact the she never warms up to him. Philip is also taken advantage of by one of his medical school buddies when his friend openly flirts with Mildred when the three of them go out to dinner. Just as Philip is finally about to ask Mildred to marry him, Mildred pulls the rug right out from under him by announcing to Philip that she is engaged to someone else.Philip is crushed; and for a brief while finds a modicum of happiness with Norah, a much nicer, sophisticated woman and they begin to think of marriage. Just as this develops, Mildred pops back into Philip's life; and Philip impulsively breaks his engagement to Norah.Of course, the plot thickens very well from here on in. How do Philip and Mildred get along THIS time--she's been rejected by the man she said would marry her. There's a baby, too--how will Philip handle that? Will Norah be able to understand that Philip wants to go back to Mildred? Will Philip be able to financially afford to help Mildred?Unfortunately for Philip, the complete cycle eventually starts all over again and his new romance, this time with another young woman, is also endangered by his remarkably undying love for Mildred. What happens next could surprise you--will Mildred settle down and finally be the wife Philip has always wanted? Will Philip stay with Sally, his new girlfriend? Will Philip complete medical school after Mildred burns his inheritance money? That alone presents a huge financial problem for Philip.Believe me, I know it may seem that I've given it all away--but I didn't! This is a great film with plenty more to the plot that will keep your attention very well. The DVD doesn't come with many extras; but with this film you don't need many extras. It stands on its own very well.Of Human Bondage let Bette Davis prove that she was a great new Hollywood star. Davis uses her face, eyes and speech to convey so much that her performance becomes positively electric. Leslie Howard turns in a fine performance as Philip Carey; and look for good acting from Kay Johnson (Norah) and Frances Dee (Sally) as well.I highly recommend this film for fans of Bette Davis; and people who enjoy classic movies will not be disappointed.",5,it was enough to make her WIPE HER MOUTH !!!,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,3063,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'star', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'acting', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'told', 'already', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'spellbinding', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'performance', 'immoral', 'petty', 'cruel', 'manipulative', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'one', 'movie', 'HAVE', 'see', 'action', 'when', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'London', 'Paris', 'realizing', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'artist', 'return', 'native', 'London', 'waitress', 'named', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Mildred', 'colder', 'ice', 'Philip', 'Philip', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'club', 'foot', 'actually', 'Mildred', 'best', 'woman', 'could', 'ever', 'get.As', 'time', 'Philip', 'truly', 'love', 'Mildred', 'fact', 'never', 'up', 'Philip', 'also', 'taken', 'advantage', 'one', 'medical', 'school', 'buddies', 'when', 'friend', 'openly', 'Mildred', 'when', 'three', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'Just', 'Philip', 'finally', 'ask', 'Mildred', 'marry', 'Mildred', 'rug', 'right', 'out', 'announcing', 'Philip', 'engaged', 'someone', 'else.Philip', 'crushed', 'brief', 'modicum', 'happiness', 'Norah', 'much', 'nicer', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'begin', 'think', 'marriage', 'Just', 'Mildred', 'back', 'Philip', 'life', 'Philip', 'impulsively', 'engagement', 'Norah.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'How', 'do', 'Philip', 'Mildred', 'get', 'THIS', 'time', 'been', 'rejected', 'man', 'said', 'would', 'marry', 'baby', 'too', 'how', 'will', 'Philip', 'handle', 'Will', 'Norah', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'Philip', 'go', 'back', 'Mildred', 'Will', 'Philip', 'be', 'able', 'financially', 'afford', 'help', 'Mildred', 'Unfortunately', 'Philip', 'complete', 'cycle', 'eventually', 'over', 'again', 'new', 'romance', 'time', 'young', 'woman', 'also', 'endangered', 'remarkably', 'undying', 'love', 'Mildred', 'What', 'next', 'could', 'surprise', 'will', 'Mildred', 'settle', 'down', 'finally', 'be', 'wife', 'Philip', 'always', 'wanted', 'Will', 'Philip', 'stay', 'Sally', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Will', 'Philip', 'complete', 'medical', 'school', 'Mildred', 'inheritance', 'money', 'alone', 'huge', 'financial', 'problem', 'Philip.Believe', 'know', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'plenty', 'more', 'plot', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'many', 'extras', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'many', 'extras', 'own', 'very', 'well.Of', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'let', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'prove', 'was', 'great', 'new', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Davis', 'face', 'eyes', 'speech', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'positively', 'electric', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'fine', 'performance', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'look', 'good', 'acting', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'Norah', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'Sally', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Of Human Bondage VHS

This style was more like melodramatic 'stage-acting' and was quite prevalent in films in the early to mid-30's. As the sound era matured, so did the performances. But for it's time Bette Davis' performance was outstanding. Which is why, though Jack Warner kept her name off the ballot for the Best Actress Oscar for 1934, so many members of the Academy were so outraged by her omission, for that year only, they were allowed a write-in nominee. Coincidentally, the following year Bette Davis did win the Oscar for ""Dangerous"" a good, but less worthy performance. She even admitted that herself. It was a consolation prize for ""Bondage"". Now, about the Blu-ray disc. Although it is a great improvement over previously released dvds, is this the best they could do?

Leslie Howard and Bette Davis offer memorable performances in this drama where a medical student is attracted to a promiscuous waitress with tragic consequences. This is based on the novel of Somerset Maugham who lived in Paris until he was ten, then educated at King's School, Canterbury, and at Heidelberg University He goes to study medicine in London and then start writing novels. The lead character Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) tries to become an artist in Paris and after being turned down, he goes to London and enrolls in a medical college. Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. While at Medical school he meets a sultry waitress named, Mildred Rogers; his passion and love for her carries him to the edge of self-destruction.  He becomes an instrument in the hands of a cold-hearted woman, and finds himself snubbed, and ridiculed. Her promiscuous nature does not teach Philip anything but leads him to a path of defeat and destruction.Somerset Maugham's novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters leaves lasting impression on him. The most notable are Norah (Kay Johnson) who offers him unquestionable love and care, and the Athlneys, Sally Athlney (Frances Dee) and Thorpe Athlney (Reginald Owen) has strong positive influence on him through their goodness and simplicity of life.At the end of the movie, penniless and stricken with tuberculosis, Mildred passes away and then Philip realizes what he is missing all along his life; the sweetness of a woman like Sally. This movie gave the opportunity for Bette Davis to be a star and influential people of Movie industry ran a campaign to have her name included for Academy award in 1934. She was only 26 when the film was completed and many moviegoers began to notice Bette Davis as a leading lady of Hollywood movies. During an interview Davis recalled that she didn't like Leslie Howard's treatment on the sets.

390143,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,6303934552,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[13, 39]","First of all, the 'quality; of this DVD is reprehensible. It's a blurry, jerky print of a very dirty negative and simply will not do. It's difficult to believe this is a DVD, but there you go. Catch this movie on TV if you can, or if you're a huge Bette completist, pay as little as you can for it.Now, on with the review. To say that 'Of Human Bondage' is a silly and dull movie is an understatement of the first magnitude. It takes people's preconceptions of silly and boring and completely redefines them, creating instead new and terrible adjectives to replace them. 'Flapsnot' could be one, 'Turd-esque', another. Adapted from a well-loved W. Somerset Maugham novel, this original version of the movie (there are two others) attempts to utilise procrastinated silences and over-long facial close-ups of its leading man, Leslie Howard, to express the deep emotional turmoil and self-destructive impulses wrought on his life by Mildred The Slutty Waitress, played by the usually sublime Bette Davis. The trouble with this, however, is that Mr. Howard is, was, and ever shall be, a wooden character actor, with just one facial expression in his repertoire (see 'Gone With The Wind' for proof of this), so we can't really tell if his character, Philip Carey, is upset, bored, hungry, depressed or gassy. The result is a leading man of unprecedented blandness. We don't care about his disability, or his artist's soul, nor do we give one whit about why he finds Mildred so compelling - we don't give a damn about him in general.Running a close second to Mr. Howard's performance in terms of sheer pointlessness is that of Ms. Davis in the role of Mildred. Normally, Bette Davis is a true virtuoso, a delight to watch and a memorable character, no matter how drab her supporting cast. Sadly, in this, her first major motion picture, she comes off as totally and utterly irritating. As the wanton and manipulative Mildred, she has neither enough lines nor screen presence to pull off a convincing man-eater. She is disjointed because her character, direction and particularly her script are disjointed.  We can't believe that any man, even one as shy and ill-favoured as Carey, could find her attractive. And the accent! In all of history, there has surely never been a worse attempt at a cockney accent. Ever. We can hear that she's struggling with it - she mispronounces Champagne as something like 'Sham-paaaaaan' and her own clipped British-ish accent is clearly audible beneath it all. It's a horrible thing to see such a great actress in a terrifically demeaning role.Devoid of all human emotion, the film goes from bad to worse (and ends up at confusing and unwatchable) when Carey finally rids himself of his lust for Mildred and begins dating impoverished-but-upstanding Sally Athelny, a woman who appears to live in a calendar. In fact, it's thanks to over-ambitious and disasterously-edited 'special' effect sequences like this, prevalent from the get-go, that, by the pictures' end, we don't actually know what's going on. Mildred dies and we assume Carey gets married to Calendar-Woman. The fact that he does not see her as she dies totally negates any emotion we think he may have once felt for her. The film is full of confusing and contradictory vignettes such as this, and with such a terrible DVD transfer, it's quite likely that you'll switch off well before Bette's one fiery speech, which is itself marred by her horrible forced accent.A turgid, unappealing piece that serves only to bore, and cause great distress to fans of Bette Davis and/or Cockney people, 'Of Human Bondage' is a grossly overrated, undeserved classic.

390146,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6303934552,"""scotsladdie""","[1, 1]","Davis actually hired a cockney maid to help her get Mildred's accent down pat.  While not completely successful in coping with foreign sounds, Davis does a commendable job.  That accent remains one of the most striking things in the movie.  Mildred's whining, snarling, shrewish tones definitely linger in one's memory.  That precise, nervous voice, the pale ash-blonde hair, the popping, neurotic eyes  - they all add up to a kind of  a corrupt and rather phosphorescent kind of prettiness which is at once fascinating and repulsive.  When Davis made this movie (she was loaned to RKO) she figured it would either make her or break her. Davis doesn't let Mildred happen; she MAKES her happen, and, boy, you'd better watch! This film, however as a whole, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I find it at once fascinating and repulsive and in some respects, unbelievable. Davis, always fascinating to watch, gives a startling performance as Mildred.  I can see why the critics and the public alike took notice of her; this was a very nasty role for an ingenue to take in 1934. She does very well in what could be called a histrionic performance; what makes the movie so hard to take is just HOW or WHY Phillip could take the constant abuse this guttersnipe dishes out to him!  I find this rather unbelievable as Davis is such an OBNOXIOUS hussey and Phillip is obviously well-bred and gentle........Perhaps the book made more sense.  Frances Dee was quite good as the decent girl. There is a scene where Davis almost flubs a line refering to her &quot;gentleman friend&quot; which could have been re-shot.  I think the scene in which she first sees that Howard is club-footed is excellent; her heartless and laughing reaction was expertly delivered.  In her big, histrionic scene, her voice gets grating and rather forced during the end when she stresses &quot;cripple, cripple&quot;.  Bette did her own horrific make-up and her final scenes are realistically pathetic; Mildred looks like a corpse warmed-over!  This is a difficult review to write because Davis really was striking in her playing; it's just that Mildred is such a stinker! - you can't forgive Howard for taking her back ( or even helping her out for that matter!! ).",4,PRETTY POISON,943833600,"11 29, 1999",1999,2228,"['Davis', 'actually', 'hired', 'cockney', 'maid', 'help', 'get', 'Mildred', 'accent', 'down', 'pat', 'not', 'completely', 'successful', 'coping', 'foreign', 'sounds', 'Davis', 'commendable', 'job', 'accent', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'things', 'movie', 'Mildred', 'whining', 'snarling', 'shrewish', 'tones', 'definitely', 'linger', 'one', 'memory', 'precise', 'nervous', 'voice', 'pale', 'ash-blonde', 'hair', 'popping', 'neurotic', 'eyes', 'add', 'up', 'kind', 'corrupt', 'rather', 'phosphorescent', 'kind', 'prettiness', 'once', 'fascinating', 'repulsive', 'When', 'Davis', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'loaned', 'RKO', 'figured', 'would', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'Davis', ""n't"", 'let', 'Mildred', 'happen', 'MAKES', 'happen', 'boy', ""'d"", 'better', 'watch', 'film', 'however', 'whole', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'find', 'once', 'fascinating', 'repulsive', 'respects', 'unbelievable', 'Davis', 'always', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'startling', 'performance', 'Mildred', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'critics', 'public', 'alike', 'took', 'notice', 'was', 'very', 'nasty', 'role', 'ingenue', 'take', '1934', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'histrionic', 'performance', 'movie', 'so', 'hard', 'take', 'just', 'HOW', 'WHY', 'Phillip', 'could', 'take', 'constant', 'abuse', 'guttersnipe', 'out', 'find', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'Davis', 'such', 'OBNOXIOUS', 'hussey', 'Phillip', 'obviously', 'well-bred', 'gentle', 'book', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'decent', 'girl', 'scene', 'where', 'Davis', 'almost', 'flubs', 'line', 'refering', 'quot', 'friend', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 're-shot', 'think', 'scene', 'first', 'Howard', 'club-footed', 'excellent', 'heartless', 'laughing', 'reaction', 'was', 'expertly', 'delivered', 'big', 'histrionic', 'scene', 'voice', 'grating', 'rather', 'forced', 'end', 'when', 'quot', 'cripple', 'cripple', 'quot', 'Bette', 'did', 'own', 'horrific', 'make-up', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistically', 'pathetic', 'Mildred', 'corpse', 'warmed-over', 'difficult', 'review', 'write', 'Davis', 'really', 'was', 'striking', 'playing', 'just', 'Mildred', 'such', 'stinker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Howard', 'taking', 'back', 'even', 'helping', 'out', 'matter']",Of Human Bondage VHS
