One should not compare, I'm sure - but the second one does suffer by comparison - that is, for my taste. There was no spectacular number in the second one, such as &#34;Carmen&#34; in the first one. Soooo, if you haven't seen the first one, you will enjoy this one. Or even if you have.

Kind of like the Cirque du Soleil of ballroom dancing. Amazing dancing, but I must admit that it didn't hold my attention. There wasn't a story to it as there is with most Cirque shows. The live performance was probably worth the price of a ticket but the recorded version...not for me. Three stars for the amazing dancing.",3,Not what I expected,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,465,"['Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'description', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'dancing', 'rather', 'recorded/edited', 'live', 'performance', 'Kind', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'Amazing', 'dancing', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'most', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'live', 'performance', 'was', 'probably', 'worth', 'price', 'ticket', 'recorded', 'version', 'not', 'Three', 'stars', 'amazing', 'dancing']",N/A

The dancing in this is so pure and honest, and not gimmicky like the original. These are some of the greatest dancers I have ever seen, you won't need to be a dancer or a even know much about dancing to enjoy this DVD. The choreography is done by Jason Gilkison, the ballroom choreographer on the Australian "" So You Think You Can Dance?"" reality TV-show, so you can't go wrong--the guy's a genius! Aside from great dancing, there's alot of eye candy dancing around onstage, hot guys and girls.

It had something for everybody but with an emphasis on Latin dancing.  There were even a couple of dancers in the company who I knew from television.  If you are a fan of Dancing with the Stars you should enjoy this show.,5,Ballroom at its Best,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,344,"['am', 'fan', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'was', 'long', 'dancing', 'limited', 'spectacle', 'had', 'something', 'everybody', 'emphasis', 'Latin', 'dancing', 'were', 'even', 'couple', 'dancers', 'company', 'who', 'knew', 'television', 'are', 'fan', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'should', 'enjoy', 'show']",N/A
