708918,A32T2H8150OJLU,B00006ADFQ,ARH,"[0, 0]","A young Irish-Catholic boy living in 1970s Chicago gets the idea that he can avoid going to hell, as his Catholic School teacher suggests he will if he does not make some changes, if he is able to complete a quest to help someone else get to Heaven. So, as soon as school is out for the summer he goes in search of someone to help.  His quest leads him to a Jewish Synagogue where he meets an open-minded Rabbi.  The Rabbi agrees to let the boy set up a lemonade stand in front of the synagogue in his effort to help others.  The story progresses and the Catholic boy meets the Rabbi's son, and he agrees to take on the challenge of the quest...a modified form of a decathalon in the days when Bruce Jenner was considered the greatest athlete in the world.Time goes on, and the families of the Catholic boy and the Jewish boy face questions from their young sons about life, death, and faith.This film, though perhaps a little lacking in the current style of Hollywood blockbusters (which certainly isn't all bad)  delivers a powerful message about family, friendship, faith, and religion.The costuming, props, and presentation of the 1970s rang true to me...all the way down to the banana-seat bicycles and pick-up baseball games.  In addition, though I'm not Catholic, I grew up in a predominantly Catholic area outside of New Orleans, and some of my friends attended Catholic school.  The movie's portrayal of life in Catholic school seemed like what they used to tell me about what it was like for them.Oh, and Bonnie Hunt turns in a particularly engaging performance.  I love the scene in the car when one of her teenaged sons is swearing and she handles the situation.

708920,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006ADFQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I know absolutely *nothing* about anything even remotely related to religion so expect a terrible review on my part but... here goes anyway.Stolen Summer is about a young boy who's a Catholic, and he makes it his own personal mission to convert a Jewish boy into a Catholic because, according to the Catholic boy, Jewish people aren't accepted into heaven.  Is this true?  Beats me.  Like I said, my knowledge concerning religion is extremely limited.  I've heard of God, Jesus and Mary.  Does Goliath count?  Making the family *Irish* Catholics just confuses me even more.Anyway, the best a film like this can accomplish for a clueless person like myself concerning a subject I have no understanding of is to give me a positive message that if you pray hard enough, you too will be accepted into heaven regardless of your religion.The interaction between the two young boys is really interesting though- easily the highlight.  They go on adventures together such as skipping rocks at the beach and attempting to figure out each others religious beliefs by communicating with each other whenever the two are together.I'm not so sure it was appropriate to drag cancer into the storyline.  Seriously, that can drive ANY person (religious or not) completely crazy regardless of their beliefs, because such a thing can take a serious toll on a person.Another interesting aspect of the storyline is the father who's always defensive and demanding, especially towards the older son.  The father has huge aspirations for his oldest son and where he would like his son to work for a living, but the son constantly argues that he'd prefer a different life instead.  These segments are really good.Both the Catholic and Jewish families are very considerate and understanding towards their own family, so if there's a message here that religious people are better at raising families compared to non-religious families, well, I probably couldn't disagree there.  Of course, this is entirely assuming ALL religious people are like the ones portrayed in the movie.I don't know exactly what kind of person this film is intended for.  People who don't follow religion won't understand it, and people who attend church every Sunday will have a ""been there, done that"" feeling by its conclusion, so I dunno.",5,honest and... religious,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,2290,"['know', 'absolutely', '*nothing*', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'related', 'religion', 'so', 'expect', 'terrible', 'review', 'part', 'here', 'anyway.Stolen', 'Summer', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Catholic', 'own', 'personal', 'mission', 'convert', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'Catholic', 'according', 'Catholic', 'boy', 'Jewish', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'accepted', 'heaven', 'true', 'Beats', 'said', 'knowledge', 'concerning', 'religion', 'extremely', 'limited', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'God', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Does', 'Goliath', 'count', 'Making', 'family', '*Irish*', 'Catholics', 'just', 'confuses', 'even', 'more.Anyway', 'best', 'film', 'can', 'accomplish', 'clueless', 'person', 'concerning', 'subject', 'have', 'understanding', 'give', 'positive', 'message', 'pray', 'hard', 'enough', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'accepted', 'heaven', 'regardless', 'religion.The', 'interaction', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'really', 'interesting', 'though-', 'easily', 'highlight', 'go', 'adventures', 'together', 'such', 'skipping', 'rocks', 'beach', 'attempting', 'figure', 'out', 'others', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'communicating', 'other', 'whenever', 'two', 'are', 'together.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'was', 'appropriate', 'drag', 'cancer', 'storyline', 'Seriously', 'can', 'drive', 'ANY', 'person', 'religious', 'not', 'completely', 'crazy', 'regardless', 'beliefs', 'thing', 'can', 'take', 'serious', 'toll', 'person.Another', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'father', 'who', 'always', 'defensive', 'demanding', 'especially', 'older', 'son', 'father', 'huge', 'aspirations', 'oldest', 'son', 'where', 'would', 'like', 'son', 'work', 'living', 'son', 'constantly', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'different', 'life', 'instead', 'segments', 'are', 'really', 'good.Both', 'Catholic', 'Jewish', 'families', 'are', 'very', 'considerate', 'understanding', 'towards', 'own', 'family', 'so', 'message', 'here', 'religious', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'raising', 'families', 'compared', 'non-religious', 'families', 'well', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'there', 'course', 'entirely', 'assuming', 'ALL', 'religious', 'people', 'are', 'ones', 'portrayed', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'film', 'intended', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'religion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'attend', 'church', 'Sunday', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'feeling', 'conclusion', 'dunno']",Project Greenlight's Stolen Summer: Movie

708923,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00006ADFQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","As a native Chicagoan, from a Sephardic Jewish background and Catholic upbringing, I couldn't have settled on a lovelier film than STOLEN SUMMER. It brought back all sorts of memories, and even though the only location that brought memories were under the el and the lakeside, it still brought warm feelings to my heart.This is the story of the innocence and sweetness of faith: uncomplicated, full of decent, honest queries and hope beyond what any of us can remember from childhood. This movie just proves to old farts like me: it's never too late to have a happy childhood.2nd-grader Pete O'Malley (a wonderful Adi Stein) decides he should go on a quest: find a Jew to ""convert"", in order to help that person get into heaven. This may seem contrived, and even anti-Semitic. It is not. It is strictly through the eyes of children, and it has lessons to teach.Pete meanders his way to the neighborhood synagogue (I doubted this was a real synagogue and I've never seen it before), hoping to snag a wayward Jew there. He meets the kind, warmhearted Rabbi Jacobsen (a fantastic turn by the too-little-seen Kevin Pollack). A proposal: would the rabbi let Pete set up a lemonade stand, where he could offer free lemonade...and a trip to heaven? The rabbi is more than indulgent and admires Pete's conviction.One day a raging fire turns to an explosion. Pete and his brother follow the sirens, and they find themselves at the rabbi's house which is in flames. The rabbi's little son Danny (Mike Weinberg) is trapped inside. Pete's father (the ever-more-stunning Aidan Quinn) is the fireman who saves the boy's life. The rabbi is deeply grateful, though this film does not wallow in maudlin falsehoods.Pete and Danny become fast friends, with Pete proposing a 'decathlon' for Danny to win--if he does, Pete reasons, he must be worthy of getting into heaven. Somehow Pete has picked up the distressing idea that only Catholics get to heaven through Jesus. He figures a decathlon-winner, urged on by a person on a quest, has got to be a sure-fire winner! The only trouble is that Danny has leukemia, and seems not destined to live long.The unfolding of this wonderful story is unbelievably deep and touching. 1st-time writer/director Pete Jones was lucky his opus one did so well. Few directors this green are this successful. The topic is difficult, and Jones might have copied three dozen movies, but he doesn't copy a single one. The humor is superb without that attempt at ill-fitting slapstick or blackness. The kids are the funniest characters, next to Bonnie Hunt (Mrs. O'Malley).What the children have to teach the adults around them is too good for me to cross-section it for you. After all, this could have been a battle of the Jews vs. the Christians, but instead it's a home-run. Get this amazing film, learn about Project Greenlight, of which Jones is the first winner, thank Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for not being as useless as we always think they are.After all, they gave us this fantastic, instant classic film that will never lose its message of hope, innocence and faith in the face of intolerance, bigotry and racism.By the way, usual tag critique: what the heck is ""gay"" doing down there?

(It seems Miramax made a an enormous error holding the release of the movie up until well after the series had aired.

708925,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00006ADFQ,Michael Crane,"[21, 23]","This was the script that won the ""Project Greenlight"" contest.  First-time writer/director Pete Jones was given the opportunity to give us a tale about family and faith.  And it all takes place in Chicago.  I admit, I was a little worried at first, and was even a little doubtful of the movie being any good.  There were a lot of things that went wrong for Pete and the crew during the filming of this movie.  I guess they only showed us what went wrong because there must've been a lot of things that went right that we didn't get to see.  Because ""Stolen Summer"" is a wonderful film that's filled with humor and heart.The movie is about Pete O'Malley, a young boy in an Irish-Catholic family.  He's worried that he isn't going to Heaven and wants to find a way to assure God that he's worthy.  He gets the idea of converting the Jewish so they can go to Heaven.  He meets Rabbi Jacobson, who finds Pete's Quest to be creative and caring, despite his religious beliefs.  That is when Pete meets and befriends Rabbi Jacobson's son, Danny.  Pete wants to convert Danny in hopes that they will both make it to heaven.  It is a very emotional and sincere movie that plays on all of your emotions.I'm not a very religious person, I admit, but I found the movie to be very creative and entertaining.  The script does take risks, but the overall product is presented to us in a way that we can't help but smile and even laugh at times.  As the movie progresses, we learn it isn't just about religious differences, it's about the friendship of two boys trying to make sense of the world around them.The acting was really superb, especially from the two boys.  They did a really great job in the film.  The cast also includes Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Pollak, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Brian Dennehy.  Aidan does an awesome job playing Pete's father, who can be quite humorous in his ignorance at times.  He can be forceful, but caring at the same time.  Bonnie Hunt also fills the film with light as the mother.  Kevin Pollak is great as the Rabbi, who can show us his humorous and serious side.  Everybody did their roles justice.Pete Jones does a really great job, being that this is his first film.  Remember, this is a man who has never had any prior experience in film, or at least none that I have heard of.  Sure, there were some mistakes, but then again, what film DOESN'T have mistakes?I really enjoyed listening to the commentary, which was done by the director, co-producer and producer Chris Moore.  It was funny and informative.  They even point out some of the mistakes that happen during the film.  (If they had kept their mouths shut, I probably would've never noticed any of them!)  I usually don't listen to commentary, but after seeing the ""Project Greenlight"" series, it was almost like I had to listen to it.  I'm glad I did.Overall, ""Stolen Summer"" is a terrific film.  Pete Jones and the rest of the crew should be proud of themselves.  You don't have to be very religious to enjoy this movie, so don't let make you think you will not like it.

I mean if you saw the last season of ""Project Greenlight"" he doesn't speak highly of this first film produced by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and himself for season one of HBO's Project Greenlight. Perhaps Mr. Moore bases his feelings on how much money the movie made, which was very little. I think we all know that there are countless movies out there that bombed at the box office, but prove to be wonderful and meaningful motion pictures. I liked ""Stolen Summer"" because it asked questions we all have. It features a first rate cast including Aidan Quinn, Kevin Pollak, Eddie Kaye Thomas & Bonnie Hunt. I would have liked to see more of Bonnie Hunt, she is an absolute delight on screen. Check her out in larger roles like ""Return to Me"" & ""Only You"" also.

708929,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006ADFQ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[6, 13]","It is in some way, very refreshing to see religion being presented in a movie from 2002 and in such a positive light. Too often the religious leaders in movies are ridiculed and unless we had personally met a kind and generous teacher of spirituality, one would imagine them less than desirable people to know. Here we have a Rabbi and a Priest who make an impact on a young boys life in a positive way.This movie is obviously supposed to be a ""cute"" way to unveil the childishness we as adults possess in regards to our attitudes to various cultures and religions. In other words, the message is that we are all humans and should seek to care and love all human beings despite our insistence on choosing a particular religion for our own spiritual satisfaction.There are some strikingly true statements in this movie. For one, the Rabbi states that when people are asked to think, that is when they get angry. This is particularly true about us humans when someone confronts us with spiritual issues. The human with an open mind will listen, consider the options and make his own decision. The human with a closed mind will not want to discuss various options and generally will want to impose his/her beliefs on the individual who he feels is wrong.I prefer to think that in life you can express your beliefs in an open way and then not necessarily look for acceptance, but look for an open exchange of ideas. In my online wanderings, I've always found the most enjoyable discussions on religion are between two people who are willing to listen.In this movie, the ""pride"" the adults feel overshadows their basic human qualities like love, caring and a realization of a common human element.I liked how the Rabbi explained spiritual teaching as something you can offer freely and cannot sell. You cannot buy your way to heaven.In this movie, the way to heaven is not presented. There is no discussion as to why it is important to believe in Jesus Christ. The cross is mentioned and then there is a distinction between Judaism and Catholicism. However, the actual fact of asking Jesus to forgive our sins is not discussed.At first you will wonder why Catholic Pete O'Malley (Adi Stein) wants to convert a Jewish person. Our only clue is that his teacher (a nun) at school has asked him which path he will choose. The way to hell or to heaven? He thinks he can please his teacher by converting someone to his religion. His father tells him not to try to change the world at his age. He is eight-years old and yet has the enthusiasm of a missionary during his 1976 summer vacation.Pete's conclusions about religion end up to be very universal and open minded. They are worth thinking about. How many children take their eternal destiny that seriously, let alone the destiny of their friends.The beauty in this movie is more in the element of ""caring"" for others despite their religious beliefs. The message is not really about ""converting"" anyone to your religion. It is ""accepting"" others as Jesus would. In accepting us all, Jesus makes a way for us to enter heaven. In this fact, there is great beauty. You don't have to be a member of any particular religion to believe in Jesus Christ.I am about to listen to ""Jesus: His Life and Teachings"" by Joseph F. Girzone. Lately, I have felt a need to do more research on the life of Christ and this movie was perhaps part of my journey.I can't really agree with Pete when he says that ""anyone"" could take the place of the name of Christ. No one else gave their life for all human beings and took on the weight of our sin, nor has anyone else ever claimed to have defeated death.This movie presents the ""way to heaven"" in an almost humorous way. Good works and living a good life are emphasized. In the end, ""good"" is said to be more important than acceptance of a savior. I think the element of ""pride"" is most interesting and appears at various points during the movie.To really accept Christ, you have to give up your pride and accept the ""help"" of a God who loves you. We can't ever be ""good enough"" to make it. We can make good decisions.Interesting and thoughtful movie. It also contains some emotional elements that are interesting and the main actor is so cute. What a bright, young actor. He was like sunshine throughout the movie.He is a good example of a person filled with the love of God, but if he was a real person and not just a character in the movie, it would be interesting to see how he changed as he grew older. Perhaps it is easier to have faith when we are children.A movie you can actually watch without worrying about offending the children. It will probably offend some adults. There is the charm.

708930,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006ADFQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[18, 21]","American films deal with all aspects of every day life: work, school, marriage, family, divorce, adolescence, sexuality, crime, alcoholism, drugs, disease, death - the range of subjects is virtually endless.  Yet if you were to look to films to get some sense of what defines American culture, you would never know that religion played any kind of role at all in the lives of the common, ordinary citizen.  Spirituality seems to be the one aspect of life that never gets acknowledged even by the most incisive of filmmakers.  Of course, we do occasionally run across the serial killer who claims to be doing ""the Lord's work"" as he's butchering his victims, or the diabolical Catholic Church hierarchy plotting the deaths of hundreds to maintain its nefarious hold on its riches and power, or the sleazy evangelist who is out there bilking millions out of their life savings in exchange for a phony one way ticket to eternal glory.  But we almost never see just plain garden-variety folks who go to church, value their faith and try to make their religion an intricate part of their workaday lives.  Why is that?Well, ""Stolen Summer"" is that rare American film which actually acknowledges that religion plays a key role in many people's lives.  It's Chicago, 1976, and 8-year old Pete O'Malley, fearful of going to hell, is on a quest to assure his place in heaven by converting neighborhood Jews to the Christian faith.  As part of his effort, he enlists the aid of a local rabbi who, admiring Pete's honesty and willingness to seek for Truth, agrees to let the boy set up a lemonade-cum-salvation stand outside his temple.  The film deals with a wide array of characters, including members of Pete's family as well as the rabbi's, who have varying reactions to both Pete's stated goal and the burgeoning friendship between Pete and the rabbi's own son.""Stolen Summer"" is not afraid to confront the sectarian nature of religion that is often used as a means of dividing people of faith rather than bringing them together.  Moreover, by viewing the world through the unfiltered eyes of these two innocent young boys, writer/director Pete Jones points up the empty ritualism that often defines how we adults choose to practice our faith.  Pete and Danny, by cutting through the layers of nonsense and getting to the simple heart of the matter, force many of the grownups in the film to re-evaluate their own beliefs and practices.It's also nice to see a family in a film that, although it has problems, is not thoroughly angst-ridden and dysfunctional.  The O'Malley's are an intact Irish Catholic family whose eight children are a clear testament to the couple's adherence to papal decrees on birth control.  In an excellent, multi-layered performance, Aidan Quinn plays Pete's father, Joe, a hard-working fireman who is proud of his ethnic roots and who feels that the most important role for a man in this world is to take care of his family.  Yet, Joe has problems of his own.  For one thing, he has an excessive sense of pride that prevents him from wanting his children to have a better life than the one he has made for them.  He believes that his college-aged son should be content to work as a dutiful civil servant rather than pursue his dream of becoming a doctor.  Moreover, Joe obviously fears what he doesn't know or understand and this comes out in subtle flashes of anti-Semitism, which put him in direct conflict with the rabbi and even his own son at times.  Joe is, in many ways, the most interesting character in the film mainly because Jones is careful not to peg him as either a total hero or total villain.  Bonnie Hunt and Kevin Pollack offer strong support as Joe's levelheaded wife and the open-minded rabbi, respectively.  And young Adiel Stein scores big time as the centerpiece of the film, little Pete O'Malley.  Stein conveys an upbeat childlike innocence that is infectious without becoming cutesy or cloying.  He is utterly believable as a young boy coming-of-age in a suburban home in the 1970's.""Stolen Summer,"" because it deals gently with its people and its subject matter, may strike some as a bit too mild in tone, a bit too lacking in grit to be worth very much.  And, in a sense, they may be right.  The film does sometimes come off a bit like one of those ""good for you"" After School Specials designed to deliver an upbeat, heartwarming message about the goodness of mankind without unduly upsetting anyone in the audience.  And the movie does feel a bit contrived at times, more concerned with wringing tears or teaching a lesson than it is in capturing life in its rawest form for all of us to see.  But no matter.  It's still a pleasure to see a film at least attempting to acknowledge both that people do think about religion and God from time to time in this world and that we all don't come from families torn asunder by personal trauma.  Yes, one could perhaps wish for a bit more edginess at times - still, ""Stolen Summer"" merits praise for bringing religion back into the mainstream of American movies.",4,that rare film that deals

The script contains a good amount of surprises, and the character development is quite caringly done.A word for the acting. Though the characters get gritty on occasion, the film is paced very well. Some protagonists are young (kids) but their work is impressively natural. Bonnie Hunt in particular should have merited more screen time, she works a taut but tender magic as a straight-talking mother.If you care for meaningful cinema, I think this would make for a very worthwhile rental.",4,"GENTLE, WELL-MEANING TALE WITH A LAID BACK PACE.",1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,931,"['chanced', 'movie', 'cable', 'Stolen', 'Summer', ""n't"", 'kind', 'film', 'made', 'too', 'often', 'light', 'cute', 'balanced', 'touching', 'serious', 'side', 'universal', 'messages', 'religion', 'God', 'love', 'family', 'growing', 'up.The', 'director', 'style', 'point-and-shoot', 'variety', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'over-the-top', 'visual', 'flourishes', 'likely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'attention', 'away', 'ample', 'dialogue', 'script', 'good', 'amount', 'surprises', 'character', 'development', 'quite', 'caringly', 'done.A', 'word', 'acting', 'characters', 'get', 'gritty', 'occasion', 'film', 'paced', 'very', 'well', 'protagonists', 'are', 'young', 'kids', 'work', 'impressively', 'natural', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'particular', 'should', 'have', 'merited', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'taut', 'tender', 'magic', 'straight-talking', 'mother.If', 'care', 'meaningful', 'cinema', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'rental']",Project Greenlight's Stolen Summer: Movie

708934,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006ADFQ,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 12]","It's 1976.  8-year-old boy Pete is living with his Irish family in Chicago; his dad is a fire fighter Aidan Quinn, and his mother is Bonnie Hunt, both parents being religious Catholics.  One day Pete thinks about a very unique theory on Jewish people and the Heaven, and puts it into practice.Then he gets acquainted with a Jewish boy Danny; Pete, following his childish idea, believes that his new friend cannot go to the Heaven, and tries to ""save"" him with a decathron test.  But soon Pete must realise that the idea of going to the Heaven means not exactly what he has so far innocently envisioned.OK, as other reviewers say, this is the first film resulted from the 'Project Greenlight,' a competition held on the Net to help aspiring directors realize their dreams.  That project started in the autumn of 2000, and it is reported that as many as 12,000 scripts applied to the contest.  This film is the winner which is co-produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, supportes of the project.  But 12,000!?I say this because the charm of ""Stolen Summer"" does not in fact come from the script.  The greatest asset of the film is its veteran actors like Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Brian Dennehy, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and best of all Kevin Pollack as Danny's father.  The acting is unanimously strong; especially that of Pollack as compassionate and tender-hearted father should be long remembered, sustained by deftly expressed humor and touching pathos.Now, let me say what I have to say.  (Don't say I am a harsh guy, please.)  Strangely, and regrettably, the two leading child actors are not good.  Their facial expressions are not as convincing as they should be, and when we know that fact, we also know the very conspicuous flaw of the film: too sentimental and clithed plot.  The story looks sometimes very  contrived.  The plot concerning the religious idea is, I find, too shallow to make us really think (even considering it is uttered by a child), and the descriptions of Pete's family are actually nothing but too familiar images we have seen before, like stubborn, beer-drinking dad who loves baseball.  (Please!)  And I could not find the boy Pete so realistic as other characters to make us care him and his friend.  I know some kids have original ideas about religion, but I don't think not many would try to 'convert' other people.Clearly the film is a well-intentioned attempt of creating a family picture with some thought-provoking ideas about ethnic and religious matters, but ironically that provocative part sounds most unrealistic in the whole story.",3,"Well-Intentioned, But Deeply Flawed Film about Two Families",1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,2570,"['1976', '8-year-old', 'boy', 'Pete', 'living', 'Irish', 'family', 'Chicago', 'dad', 'fire', 'fighter', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'mother', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'parents', 'being', 'religious', 'Catholics', 'One', 'day', 'Pete', 'very', 'unique', 'theory', 'Jewish', 'people', 'Heaven', 'practice.Then', 'acquainted', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'Danny', 'Pete', 'following', 'childish', 'idea', 'new', 'friend', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'Heaven', 'tries', 'save', 'decathron', 'test', 'soon', 'Pete', 'must', 'realise', 'idea', 'going', 'Heaven', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'so', 'far', 'innocently', 'envisioned.OK', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'first', 'film', 'resulted', ""'Project"", 'Greenlight', 'competition', 'held', 'Net', 'help', 'aspiring', 'directors', 'realize', 'dreams', 'project', 'started', 'autumn', '2000', 'reported', 'as', 'many', '12,000', 'scripts', 'applied', 'contest', 'film', 'winner', 'co-produced', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'project', '12,000', 'say', 'charm', 'Stolen', 'Summer', 'not', 'fact', 'come', 'script', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'best', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'Danny', 'father', 'acting', 'unanimously', 'strong', 'especially', 'Pollack', 'compassionate', 'tender-hearted', 'father', 'should', 'be', 'long', 'remembered', 'sustained', 'deftly', 'expressed', 'humor', 'touching', 'pathos.Now', 'let', 'say', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'harsh', 'guy', 'please', 'Strangely', 'regrettably', 'two', 'leading', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'convincing', 'should', 'be', 'when', 'know', 'fact', 'also', 'know', 'very', 'conspicuous', 'flaw', 'film', 'too', 'sentimental', 'clithed', 'plot', 'story', 'sometimes', 'very', 'contrived', 'plot', 'concerning', 'religious', 'idea', 'find', 'too', 'shallow', 'make', 'really', 'think', 'even', 'considering', 'uttered', 'child', 'descriptions', 'Pete', 'family', 'are', 'actually', 'nothing', 'too', 'familiar', 'images', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'stubborn', 'beer-drinking', 'dad', 'who', 'baseball', 'Please', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'boy', 'Pete', 'so', 'realistic', 'other', 'characters', 'make', 'care', 'friend', 'know', 'kids', 'have', 'original', 'ideas', 'religion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'not', 'many', 'would', 'try', ""'convert"", 'other', 'people.Clearly', 'film', 'well-intentioned', 'attempt', 'creating', 'family', 'picture', 'thought-provoking', 'ideas', 'ethnic', 'religious', 'matters', 'ironically', 'provocative', 'part', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'whole', 'story']",Project Greenlight's Stolen Summer: Movie
