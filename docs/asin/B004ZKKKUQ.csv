1434771,AA8PK3IA7HPXK,B004ZKKKUQ,Andrew Hernandez,"[1, 3]","I hate it whenever people judge action films on merits they shouldn't be critiqued on. People complain that The Expendables had a bad plot? Please! That was all about the action. And that should have rang true for Tactical Force.Writer and director Adamo P. Cultraro has his characters talk in over-written and faux-stylish dialogue which gets grating 5 minutes into the movie. Everyone is trying so hard to sound cool and funny, but it's just painful to listen to. Especially when Michael Eklund talks.Despite playing a really annoying and stupid character in Steve Austin's Hunt to Kill, the producers must've thought that was gold and decided to bring him back and make him more annoying. Why would Austin be OK with that? He's also involved in a twist ending that makes no sense and just made me want to strangle his character.The villains spend the whole movie bickering like 9-year-olds and swearing just for the sake of swearing, while the heroes do more or less of the same thing. It was the type of stuff Troy Duffy would write today. It seems like the actors are trying to have fun with it, but the writing just hurts their performances.Darren Shahlavi decides to stretch his ""acting wings"" by playing his character like a poor man's Jerry Lewis, and he he almost as annoying as Michael Eklund. He may have been over the top in Bloodmoon and Ip Man 2, but I would take those ridiculous characters over the irritating one he plays here.The action scenes intercut with nonsense almost every ten seconds. Michael Jai White and Darren Shahlavi have a fight scene in the film that is ruined because it keeps cutting to other scenes throughout the bout. (Not to mention it's filmed in a dark room and it can't be seen clearly.) They have a much better fight in Mortal Kombat Legacy.Lexa Doig looks like she could do well in the action department, but she just gets beaten up. Steve Austin has a fight scene with UFC's Keith Jardine who is sporting a very distracting pair of cauliflower ears. Despite being a real life tough guy, he tries too hard to be tough in the movie, and comes off as a joke. The fight scene itself is decent and surprisingly doesn't cut away to any scenes.Overall, this movie is an awful waste of time. If you want action, you won't get much of it here. Instead you get some of the worst dialogue of the year in spades.",1,Action takes a backseat to awful dialogue.,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,2347,"['hate', 'whenever', 'people', 'judge', 'action', 'films', 'merits', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'critiqued', 'People', 'complain', 'Expendables', 'had', 'bad', 'plot', 'Please', 'was', 'action', 'should', 'have', 'rang', 'true', 'Tactical', 'Force.Writer', 'director', 'Adamo', 'P.', 'Cultraro', 'characters', 'talk', 'over-written', 'faux-stylish', 'dialogue', 'grating', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'sound', 'cool', 'funny', 'just', 'painful', 'listen', 'Especially', 'when', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'talks.Despite', 'playing', 'really', 'annoying', 'stupid', 'character', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Hunt', 'Kill', 'producers', 'must', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'was', 'gold', 'decided', 'bring', 'back', 'make', 'more', 'annoying', 'Why', 'would', 'Austin', 'be', 'OK', 'also', 'involved', 'twist', 'ending', 'sense', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'strangle', 'character.The', 'villains', 'spend', 'whole', 'movie', 'bickering', '9-year-olds', 'swearing', 'just', 'sake', 'swearing', 'heroes', 'do', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'type', 'stuff', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'would', 'write', 'today', 'actors', 'are', 'trying', 'have', 'fun', 'writing', 'just', 'performances.Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'stretch', 'acting', 'wings', 'playing', 'character', 'poor', 'man', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'almost', 'as', 'annoying', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'Bloodmoon', 'Ip', 'Man', '2', 'would', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'irritating', 'one', 'here.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'intercut', 'nonsense', 'almost', 'ten', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'have', 'fight', 'scene', 'film', 'ruined', 'cutting', 'other', 'scenes', 'bout', 'Not', 'mention', 'filmed', 'dark', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'clearly', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'fight', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'Legacy.Lexa', 'Doig', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'action', 'department', 'just', 'beaten', 'up', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'fight', 'scene', 'UFC', 'Keith', 'Jardine', 'who', 'sporting', 'very', 'distracting', 'pair', 'cauliflower', 'ears', 'being', 'real', 'life', 'tough', 'guy', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'tough', 'movie', 'off', 'joke', 'fight', 'scene', 'decent', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'cut', 'away', 'scenes.Overall', 'movie', 'awful', 'waste', 'time', 'want', 'action', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'here', 'Instead', 'get', 'worst', 'dialogue', 'year', 'spades']",N/A

So after the rival gangs realize that the SWAT Team is in the building but don't have any ammo, each one calls in backup as it's a hunt to not only take out the SWAT Team but also find the suitcase before the other crew does.This was one of those action movies that had the simple plot & with the action of some fist fighting & explosions.

Some have been better than others but none have been bad in my opinion. From theatrical releases like ""The Condemned"", ""The Longest Yard"", and ""The Expendables"" movies to direct to video releases like this one here. I knew going in that I would most likely enjoy this flick since not only does it star Austin but also Michael Jai White, Michael Shanks, and MMA star Keith Jardine.The story follows a group of swat team members that are a bit on the rebellious side get sent to do a training exercise. While there they get trapped without weapons between two gangs looking for something. You have the no nonsense leader, the b-b gun wielding second in command, the lone has t be tough to hang with the boys female member and of course the other guy. Did I mention that while they are on this retraining assignment they are not getting paid because of the last assignment they were on.This is a very fun movie and that is basically all that it is. It is one of those action movies that you turn the brain off on. Bad dialogue and all it all adds to over all feel of the flick. Steve Austin is as always a charismatic guy and makes for a good movie hero. He has had better to work with but the story here is interesting and he makes the best of it. Michael Jai White is excellent and proves even in this that he deserves to be in big budget flicks even still. Michael Shanks is very fun as the lead villain here and you can tell he had fun doing it. Then of course former UFC star Keith Jardine is in the mix working as a villain here, another guy you can tell had fun on this film.Over all this is one movie that I would recommend but go in knowing it is an action flick that went straight to DVD and such. Like all of Austin's other flicks I did indeed enjoy this one, not sure where it ranks but I liked it. So if you are a fan of any of the people involved in this movie or an action flick fan check this out.

1434781,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004ZKKKUQ,MadMacs,"[5, 7]","Not a strong outing for either Steve Austin or Michael Jai White, both of whom I enjoy when the productions are done right. For Stone Cold done right means 'Damage'. And for Mike that would be 'Undisputed II'.This collaboration misses on several cylinders, but chugs along okay.I'm the last film fan to go around pointing at the lack of realism of any movie. All film is a ""lie"" to one degree or another, and certainly action/adventures fall into the mythic realm of Escapism. Mind you, I love escapism, that's one of the main reasons why I enjoy watching them - to get away from the 'real'. I don't want to constantly bombard myself with daily, sometimes hourly, reports of the sick, twisted maelstrom of inhumanity against ourselves and our fellow earthly denizens. Films are a non-addictive and easy escape.But even films have to have some foundation, some kernel of truth, allowing the audience to suspend belief. 'Tactical' failed this basic premise.The first thing that strikes you is the laughable make-up of the SWAT team. Could you be more politically correct? One caucasian, one black, one hispanic and a female. All they're missing is the goofy computer guy in a wheelchair, preferably a wheelchair that has a built-in secret weapon. That would just about pacify the slobbering demographically perturbed amongst us.Anybody with even the smallest scintilla of how police officers work will notice that there are usually something like a dozen special response team members at any given scene, sometimes as many as three dozen depending on the situation. A four-person team based out of one of the largest cities in the entire US? That's strike one. And SWAT has no females, not male chauvinism, just an observation. I read all the online reports that go back to 2008. To the best of my knowledge, across the entire nation, only one single female has earned a spot on her respective team - and she's not with LAPD. Strike two. Finally, with or without live fire, you don't assign a team to some abandoned military outpost for retraining. Getting access to such locations often requires difficult to obtain permits which can take up to a year or more to process. Not to mention, police have their own MOUT sites; they wouldn't train someplace where they couldn't exert authority over their area of operations. And that's strike three.Are you telling me the writers/director couldn't come up with simple plausible explanations? Like why the team was so small? Why there was a female officer. And why they would be at an abandoned military complex? Seriously? That's like three 30-second scenes. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.I detest laziness in screenwriting and direction. Detest it with a passion.And no matter how much weight he puts on or how much facial hair he grows - I'll never see Michael Shanks as anything other than a science geek. Apologies, I don't like typecasting actors, but for some it will always be that ""one role"" for life. To be fair, I even gave him credit for this production despite watching him deliver a very similar performance on the hit tv show 'Burn Notice'.Overall: Once you accept the ridiculous, you might as well try to enjoy the ride. And to enjoy - just go with it.Two small notes. Oddly, both involve body parts. One enjoyable - the other not.- Gotta love the close-up of Keith Jardine's infamous cauliflower ear. Nice they were able to work that in. Enjoyable.- Gotta hate the now ubiquitous plastic surgery fish-face that so many women wear nowadays. Not enjoyable. In fact, what spurs a woman to do that?

1434782,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004ZKKKUQ,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","I love a good action flick. I'm not talking about a well made movie that fills the giant screen with name brand recognized stars duking it out with the latest bad guy. I'm talking about movies that eventually are released straight to DVD or that play third billing at a drive in. Some of these offer pure entertainment. And then there are movies like this one.TACTICAL FORCE features a group of S.W.A.T. type police officers who start the film off by stopping a grocery store robbery in progress. The only problem is that they use excessive force to the extreme to take down these ridiculous clowns. Between the damager to the robbers and the damage to the store, rather than receive a commendation these police men are assigned to retrain over the weekend at a special facility.Led by Tate (WWE start Steve Austin), they head to the secluded location, an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Unbeknownst to those in charge, the warehouse is also where a European mobster has taken a snitch to get back a briefcase he stole from him. But wait, there's more. The snitch has made a call to another mob guy who the case was originally stolen from and he's on his way as well.When the tactical force arrives, the European mob boss and his group hide. The tactical force makes its way through the upper floors of the building hitting targets with their paintball guns to try and improve their skills. An accidental sound downstairs leads them to check it out and one of their own is shot and killed. Weaponless they must try and find out who is down there and why.Gunfights, double crosses and more double crosses, tough talk and ample enough brawls to keep the most ardent wrestling fan happy follow. Too bad there isn't enough plot to make it work. And the plot that's there is convoluted and so coincidental that even trying to accept this world is painful.Austin has made some good movies, most direct to DVD. Co-star Michael Jai White has also done some great work (BLACK DYNAMITE is now one of my favorite films). But here they offer nothing new, extreme low budget film making and the greatest sin of all when it comes to action films, a boring flick.

The movie starts out improbable as a gang of men in masks, rob a grocery store, take hostages and issue demands. A grocery store? Now I know they get robbed, but by a gang who has to share the loot? SWAT team leader Austin ignores proper police protocol and raids the place, killing the thieves, injuring the hostages, and doing huge amounts of property damage. To their surprise they are not rewarded, but are forced to take SWAT team training again. Michael Jai White, a young Carl Weathers with a BB gun is part of the team. Lexa Doig is a third member.The upstairs of an abandoned(?) warehouse is set up with paper ""bad guys"" for the SWAT team to practice with simulation rounds. As fate would have it, two rival gangs are in the downstairs of the warehouse wanting ""a case"" which was stolen from them. One of the rival gangs learned to speak with bad Russian accents. I was waiting for one of them to say, ""What about moose and squirrel.""The dialouge was mildly humorous at times, a step up from Austin's other movies. The plot left much to be desired. There were no real plot twists except at the very end...and then it didn't make much sense.If you like Steve Austin movies, I think this was one of his better ones.F-bomb, no sex. no nudity, no moose or squirrel.",3,OMG!

After a S.W.A.T. team led by Tate (Austin) get suspended they are assigned to undergo a re-training exercise. During the training they hear something and are left to stop an actual crime, with no real weapons. This will be a hard movie to review. The movie itself is not all the bad. The action is good and it moves pretty quick. The biggest problem with the movie is the dialog. Being an action movie starring a wrestler I can usually overlook stuff like this, but the words were distractingly bad. Lines like ""Eat my grandma"" shouted before firing a gun really take away from the action and makes you laugh throughout the movie instead of wondering what is happening. This will be the worst comparison ever but the action to dialog problems are ""Star Wars"" quality. The dialog is that bad, not so much the acting, just the dialog. Overall, a pretty entertaining movie that is made worse by the talking. Action is a B, dialog is a D.

1434789,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004ZKKKUQ,trebe,"[1, 2]","Tactical Force (2011) is a severely dumbed down action/comedy, with a ridiculous story, idiot characters, bad acting, and empty dialog.  Besides some occasionally funny moments, some of which are unintentional, about all this film has going for it, is a few decently executed action sequences, and a fast pace which helps keep your mind off how weak the story really is.  There's plenty of gunplay and abundance of ridiculous talk, as some criminals attempt to eliminate a police SWAT team.Steve Austin (The Condemned) plays Captain Frank Tate, the leader of a LAPD SWAT team.  The team is suspended after breaking protocol up during a robbery, and is sent to a training facility located in a warehouse, to perform training maneuvers.  Two rival groups of criminals are already at the facility, looking for an unspecified ""item"".  After killing one of SWAT cops, the crooks band together to finish off the rest of the team.With weapons loaded with blanks, Tate, Sergeant Hunt (Michael Jai White,Spawn), and Officer Jannard (Lexa Doig) are forced to retreat.  The trio manages to take out a few of the criminals, and acquire some real weapons, but they are still severely outnumbered and unable to call for help.  Taking some desperate chances, they find themselves with a mysterious prisoner, who might provide a key to their escape.It's clear from the start that Tactical Force has no serious intentions, and with everyone overplaying their roles trying to outdo each other, the attempts at humor are seldom successful.  As mindless action flicks go, it's decent enough entertainment, but anyone seeking a suspense thriller with an iota of intelligence, is in the wrong place.
