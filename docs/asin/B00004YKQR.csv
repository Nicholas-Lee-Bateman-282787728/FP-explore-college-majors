This movie does just that.Katie Sagal gives an excellent performance as Smart House...well, the disembodied voice of Smart house.  Well, Disembodied until towards the end...Watch the movie to see what I mean.Also, Ryan Merriman (Ben Cooper), gives an superb performance was a very self-disciplined, angry young man.  His mother is dead, and he and his sister and father have done well since her passing.  Ryan is the one that keeps the family washed, feed and ready for each day.  This young Actor [merriman], is such a sight to watch.  For a young man of 17, he is a fantastic site to see on the screen.  His acting is top rate.  He could be pulling in bigger roles.

559240,A1LDIMQISH07WK,B00004YKQR,Rebecca,"[16, 17]","SMART HOUSE is a great Disney Channel Original Movie. It is about a thirteen-year-old kid, Ben Cooper (Ryan Merriman) who lives with his single father and younger sister. Ben is sort of a computer brain--he's not a genius, but he goes nuts over computerized stuff. He tries to keep the family well-organized and on track so his father won't start dating other women and make them apart of their family, he thinks they don't need a new mother since their mother died. Anyway, Ben is always entering contests...hoping that someday, he'll win one of the contests and it will help make his family better. Ben enters a contest which the winner receives a brand-new house that is totally computerized--nobody has to do anything, there is a computer that does it all for them. Ben surprisingly wins this contest, and he and his family moves into it. Sarah Barnes (Jessica Steen) is the woman who created this house invention. And when Ben's father starts dating her, Ben gets upset because he thinks that his father will marry Sarah and Ben doesn't want a new mom. Then, when the computerized home, which has a voice called P.A.T. (Katey Sagal), gets out of control, P.A.T. turns into the form of a woman who claims to be the Ben and his sister's mother and tries to take over the house and the family! Ben, his father, his sister, and Sarah Barnes must stop P.A.T. from ruining the house and the Coopers.This was a very fun movie, and LeVar Burton from ""Star Track"" fame directs it. Though kind of unrealistic, but who really cares? The acting is great, especially from Ryan Merriman and Katey Sagal. There are lots of great special effects in this movie, and the dialouge is really good.

Such as cooking dinner, cleaning the house,etc... So when there is a contest to win the worlds first ever &quot;Smart House&quot;, a house that does everything for you such as cook, clean, etc..., Ben tries with all his might to win. And he does! But it turns out to be a lot more than he's prepaired for. When Ben tries to give the house human emotions and characteristics of a mother, his plans go hay-wire, causing the house to create a digital image of a woman. When the dad falls in love, the house gets jealous and puts the family under house arrest. Literally! It's a pretty funny movie.
