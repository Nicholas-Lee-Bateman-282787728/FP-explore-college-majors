1641596,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B00C2U6IQQ,Douglas M,"[1, 1]","In 1937, Alice Faye was on the cusp of major stardom and ""You Can't have Everything"" is the best of the films which lead the way. The film may seem at first like a programmer, a typical 20th Century Fox musical of the time packed with various acts such as the Ritz Brothers and Tony Martin, but at 100 minutes, this is a beautifully crafted showcase for her, neatly directed by Norman Taurog. The plot is simple. Faye is an intense young playwrite trying to get her script produced. Ameche plays a producer who takes her ""serious"" script and turns it into musical comedy much to her disgust. He recognises her talent and she becomes the leading lady. The outcome is pleasingly predictable.Along the way, Faye creates warmth with Ameche in their first teaming, strikes obvious sparks with Tony Martin, her soon to be first husband, and spars with Louise Hovick (Gypsy Rose Lee) as her sarcastic rival. The script gave her some range as an actress and she plays her part with a delightfully wry hint of satire and her usual overwhelming personal charm. The songs are plentiful and her renditions of the title song, ""Please Pardon us, We're in Love"" and ""Danger, Love at Work"" are all highlights. Even the Ritz Brothers, contained as they are, are bearable and Harry Ritz meets his match with Hovick.The film has been released in the Fox Cinema Archives Series which means it is a very expensive bare bones release.

I've known the songs from this film for a long time but had never seen the film because it doesn't appear on TCM and was never available on VHS. The songs were totally out of context for me until this DVD was released. Finally, many of Alice's earlier films are being released and what treasures they are!The Ritz Brothers are also in this - they are, in my opinion, an acquired taste however, I think this film is one of their best. The &#34;Long Underwear&#34; routine is very funny and Harry is given a chance to do a little extra acting without his brothers.Don Ameche is as charming and suave as ever. His make-up, however, makes him look rather &#34;paste-y&#34; and not to his advantage. I'm so glad that he had a long career and that he had the chance to appear in films well into his senior years. They don't make 'em like Don Ameche any more.Like all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series, the DVD is strictly bare bones: no chapters, no extras, no fancy inserts, no trailers - just the movie.",4,Have known the songs for years - so glad this DVD is finally available,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,1102,"['Alice', 'Faye', 'favorite', 'mine', 'have', 'many', 'CDs', 'records', 'songs', 'films', ""'ve"", 'known', 'songs', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', ""n't"", 'appear', 'TCM', 'was', 'never', 'available', 'VHS', 'songs', 'were', 'totally', 'context', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'Finally', 'many', 'Alice', 'earlier', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'what', 'are', 'Ritz', 'Brothers', 'are', 'also', 'are', 'opinion', 'acquired', 'taste', 'however', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'best', '34', 'Long', 'Underwear', '34', 'routine', 'very', 'funny', 'Harry', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'little', 'extra', 'acting', 'brothers.Don', 'Ameche', 'charming', 'suave', 'ever', 'make-up', 'however', 'look', 'rather', '34', 'paste-y', '34', 'not', 'advantage', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'had', 'chance', 'appear', 'films', 'well', 'senior', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'Don', 'Ameche', 'more.Like', 'DVDs', 'Fox', 'Cinema', 'Archives', 'series', 'DVD', 'strictly', 'bare', 'bones', 'chapters', 'extras', 'fancy', 'inserts', 'trailers', 'just', 'movie']",You Can't Have Everything

1641599,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B00C2U6IQQ,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 2]","This 1937 behind-the-scenes musical comedy has all the &#34;old Hollywood&#34; elements: Appealing leads, good production numbers, good supporting cast, and a memorable title song (which gets covered several times in different ways). In true classic film tradition, Alice Faye is a down-on-her-luck playwright (her opening scene in the Italian restaurant is very similar to Julie Andrews' &#34;broke but sated&#34; meal in &#34;Victor/Victoria&#34; decades later. Coincidence?) whose encounter with tipsy but well-to-do play producer Don Ameche (looking natty but still likable) gets off on the wrong foot. Naturally, there's more obstacles in their rocky romance as the story unwinds, including stubborn pride, production problems, and an alleged marriage license (when Ameche was smashed, of course).The zany Ritz Brothers get second billing in this film, doing some of their best antics along with some amazing precision dancing. The song &#34;Long Underwear&#34; is delightfully offbeat, and brother Harry's &#34;crazy eyeballs&#34; bit (you'd swear it was CGI when you first see it, but it isn't) is always good for a laugh because it's so startling. Some may find the Ritzes annoying, but I thought them quite funny with uncanny timing.A slickly done 20th Century Fox production that pretty much gives you everything!",5,"But you can have Alice Faye, Don Ameche & the Ritz Brothers",1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1323,"['1937', 'behind-the-scenes', 'musical', 'comedy', '34', 'old', 'Hollywood', '34', 'elements', 'Appealing', 'good', 'production', 'numbers', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'memorable', 'title', 'song', 'covered', 'several', 'times', 'different', 'ways', 'true', 'classic', 'film', 'tradition', 'Alice', 'Faye', 'down-on-her-luck', 'playwright', 'opening', 'scene', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'very', 'similar', 'Julie', 'Andrews', '34', 'broke', 'sated', '34', 'meal', '34', 'Victor/Victoria', '34', 'decades', 'later', 'Coincidence', 'encounter', 'tipsy', 'well-to-do', 'play', 'producer', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'looking', 'natty', 'still', 'likable', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'Naturally', 'more', 'obstacles', 'rocky', 'romance', 'story', 'unwinds', 'including', 'stubborn', 'pride', 'production', 'problems', 'alleged', 'marriage', 'license', 'when', 'Ameche', 'was', 'smashed', 'course', 'zany', 'Ritz', 'Brothers', 'get', 'second', 'billing', 'film', 'doing', 'best', 'antics', 'amazing', 'precision', 'dancing', 'song', '34', 'Long', 'Underwear', '34', 'delightfully', 'offbeat', 'brother', 'Harry', '34', 'crazy', 'eyeballs', '34', 'bit', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'CGI', 'when', 'first', 'see', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'laugh', 'so', 'startling', 'may', 'find', 'Ritzes', 'annoying', 'thought', 'quite', 'funny', 'uncanny', 'timing.A', 'slickly', 'done', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'production', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything']",You Can't Have Everything
