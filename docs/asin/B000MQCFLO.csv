1049404,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B000MQCFLO,A. White,"[0, 0]","I only ordered season 10 the day before this review, so I haven't received it yet, but I'm a big-enough Simpsons fan to write an honest review and get it out of the way now. After skimming the other reviews I think it's safe to say that, and I agree with, the very best seasons are 4-8 with 3 and 9 being excellent as well but at a slightly lower percentage. How I personally rate a season is by the number of great episodes compared to what I feel are the mediocre/poor eps; the eps of seasons 4-8 having almost all great eps IMO! Season ten is about 50:50, which is still pretty good but simply cannot hold a candle to the writing of past years. I don't know if some or most of the really great writers started moving to bigger and better things during this season, the Simpsons is a bit of a stepping stone in regards to writers, or what the deal is here but this season is clearly the turning point in overall writing quality for this show's wonderful subtlety and satire. It sounds like I'm being a little harsh on this season and still giving it 4 stars but that's due to the enjoyment this show still gives out to this day and I will never get tired of watching it!

Not to say that America's favorite family doesn't still make us laugh , it's just not as often, generally not as loud and sometimes not for the intended reasons.Homer generates most of the chuckles this season, from his beer fueled drive through the halls of Sringfield Elementary to his stint as bodyguard to the Mayor. He gets a pet lobster, becomes Max Power, takes an introspective journey in a ""whale egg"" (according to Ralph Wiggum), discovers his middle name, and of course takes Flanders to Las Vegas in one of the season's stand-out episodes (including one of my favorite lines, something about ""Vegas doesn't take kindly to out-of-towners, take your money someplace else"")Of course the die-hards will buy this anyway and why not?

The longest running primetime cartoon, the longest running sitcom and the longest running program of any sort on television, and for good reason.Frankly, the show defined a network. The SIMPSONS broke the mold. When everybody assumed there were only 3 networks, people starting tuning to a fledgling network to watch the yellow kid and his family.As shows like Family Guy and American Dad and South Park started rolling out of the gate, following in THE SIMPSONS footsteps, many criticized the Simpsons as being too slow and too tame. Yet, that's its secret. It's not that it's too slow, it's found the perfect combination of too much and not enough. The beauty of THE SIMPSONS is that it can be enjoyed by those of all ages, colors and creeds.It uses tact and intelligence to deliver its punchlines. It takes those jokes that kids shouldn't get and delivers them in a way that they won't, but the older viewers will. While the other cartoons are in your face.

1049413,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000MQCFLO,Craig MACKINNON,"[2, 3]","In Season 10, the Simpsons are starting to show some of the faults that make more recent seasons uneven and less enjoyable.  This is not the fault of the writers per se - it's hard to keep characters and situations fresh when a show passes the decade mark.  Thus, as much as I admire the absurdity of the Simpsons' writing, starting in Season 10 the writers too often cross the border from absurd to outright silly.  For example, in this season Mr. Burns captures the Loch Ness Monster (in ""Burns Can't Buy Me Love"").  It would be okay for such an even to occur in a Hallowe'en episode, for example, but it doesn't feel right as a regular season show.  Similarly, although the 3-mini-story episode ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" the Hallowe'en episode gimmick of telling Bible stories as three short stories proliferates in later seasons, but generally they are inferior episides (especially on repeated viewings).  So, a list of the best episodes from this season is shorter than for a season between 4 and 8, but there are still some great episodes, such asTreehouse of Horrors IX - featuring Maggie as the son of the alien Kodos.  Also has Bart and Lisa teleported into an Itchy and Scratchy catoon.When You Dish Upon a Star - Homer becomes a gopher for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, who have a vacation house in Springfield.  Featuring an especially memorable guest starring performance by Ron Howard (""Homer, we're out of vodka!"")Mayored to the Mob - When Mark Hammill asks for a volunteer from the audience to help him act out a scene from Star Wars, the Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con erupts in a riot.  Homer saves both Hammill and the Mayor, leading to Homer becoming the Mayor's bodyguard.Homer to the Max - Homer has his name legally changed to Max Power (""I got it from a hair drier"").  As a result of his hip new name, he and Marge end up in Ed Beagley Jr.'s protest group, chained to old-growth forest trees.30 Minutes Over Tokyo - my favourite ""Simpsons on Vacation"" episode (so far).  They are in Tokyo (obviously) where Homer and Bart end up in jail, and the whole family suffers seizures while watching the local TV station.  Guest stars George Takei as a sadistic game show host on whom the Simpsons depend on supplying their way home.Unfortunately, many of the other episodes are marred by inconsistency - they are very funny in places, but become silly and/or cannot maintain a whole story.  I previously pointed out the appearance of the Loch Ness Monster, but we also have the Simpsons descending into Hell (and not in a Hallowe'en episode), a Godzilla attack, and a second wife for both Homer and Flanders.  There is the fortunate balance of a fantastic set of guest stars, especially the aforementioned Hammill (who also participates in the episode's audio commentary) and Stephen Hawking.  Thus, the season is well worth buying on DVD, but the ""cracks in the show's hilarious facade"" are starting to appear, and this is one of the last seasons I will be purchasing.There is the usual slate of extras - audio commentary on every episode, some layout artists demonstrating their crafts, and the all-important inclusion of deleted scenes.  Somehow the audio commentaries remain fresh and interesting, even 10 seasons into the show (a marked contrast to the commentaries on, say, ""Friends"" that are stale by the time they reach Season 5, even though they only do 3-4 a season).",4,The cracks are starting to appear!,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,3381,"['Season', '10', 'Simpsons', 'are', 'starting', 'show', 'faults', 'make', 'more', 'recent', 'seasons', 'uneven', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'fault', 'writers', 'se', 'hard', 'keep', 'characters', 'situations', 'fresh', 'when', 'show', 'decade', 'mark', 'Thus', 'as', 'much', 'admire', 'absurdity', 'Simpsons', 'writing', 'starting', 'Season', '10', 'writers', 'too', 'often', 'border', 'absurd', 'outright', 'silly', 'example', 'season', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'Burns', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'such', 'even', 'occur', ""Hallowe'en"", 'episode', 'example', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'regular', 'season', 'show', 'Similarly', '3-mini-story', 'episode', 'Simpsons', 'Bible', 'Stories', ""Hallowe'en"", 'episode', 'gimmick', 'telling', 'Bible', 'stories', 'three', 'short', 'stories', 'later', 'seasons', 'generally', 'are', 'inferior', 'episides', 'especially', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'So', 'list', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'shorter', 'season', '4', '8', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'episodes', 'such', 'asTreehouse', 'Horrors', 'IX', 'featuring', 'Maggie', 'son', 'alien', 'Kodos', 'Also', 'Bart', 'Lisa', 'teleported', 'Itchy', 'Scratchy', 'catoon.When', 'Dish', 'Star', 'Homer', 'gopher', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'who', 'have', 'vacation', 'house', 'Springfield', 'Featuring', 'especially', 'memorable', 'guest', 'starring', 'performance', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Homer', ""'re"", 'vodka', 'Mayored', 'Mob', 'When', 'Mark', 'Hammill', 'volunteer', 'audience', 'help', 'act', 'out', 'scene', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Bi-Mon', 'Sci-Fi', 'Con', 'riot', 'Homer', 'Hammill', 'Mayor', 'leading', 'Homer', 'becoming', 'Mayor', 'bodyguard.Homer', 'Max', 'Homer', 'name', 'legally', 'changed', 'Max', 'Power', 'got', 'hair', 'drier', 'result', 'hip', 'new', 'name', 'Marge', 'end', 'up', 'Ed', 'Beagley', 'Jr.', 'protest', 'group', 'chained', 'old-growth', 'forest', 'trees.30', 'Minutes', 'Tokyo', 'favourite', 'Simpsons', 'Vacation', 'episode', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'Tokyo', 'obviously', 'where', 'Homer', 'Bart', 'end', 'up', 'jail', 'whole', 'family', 'suffers', 'seizures', 'watching', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'Guest', 'George', 'Takei', 'sadistic', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'whom', 'Simpsons', 'depend', 'supplying', 'way', 'home.Unfortunately', 'many', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'marred', 'inconsistency', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'places', 'become', 'silly', 'and/or', 'can', 'not', 'maintain', 'whole', 'story', 'previously', 'pointed', 'out', 'appearance', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'also', 'have', 'Simpsons', 'descending', 'Hell', 'not', ""Hallowe'en"", 'episode', 'Godzilla', 'attack', 'second', 'wife', 'Homer', 'Flanders', 'fortunate', 'balance', 'fantastic', 'set', 'guest', 'stars', 'especially', 'aforementioned', 'Hammill', 'who', 'also', 'episode', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'Thus', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'cracks', 'show', 'hilarious', 'facade', 'are', 'starting', 'appear', 'one', 'last', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing.There', 'usual', 'slate', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'episode', 'layout', 'artists', 'demonstrating', 'crafts', 'all-important', 'inclusion', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Somehow', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'remain', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'even', '10', 'seasons', 'show', 'marked', 'contrast', 'commentaries', 'say', 'Friends', 'are', 'stale', 'time', 'reach', 'Season', '5', 'even', 'only', 'do', '3-4', 'season']",The Simpsons: Season 10

This season was nominated for 2 Emmy Awards and won 2 Annie Awards for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Program and Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television Production. Not as many as the show is use to. This is also the 2nd year Mike Schully was the show runner and who many fans believe is the guy responsible for the shows turning point. This season also has to say goodbye to a friend from the Simpson universe. Phil Hartman's last performance is in episode ""Bart the Mother"" Where Bart kills a bird with a BB gun and feels guilty for it. Resulting in him nursing the birds unhatched eggs left in the nest. Phil Hartman was shot to death by his wife a few months before the episode was to air. He was the voice of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz.Some memorable episodes from this season include episodes such as ""Sunday Cruddy Sunday"" Where Homer gets a bus load of Springfieldians and heads to Super Bowl XXXIII (33) only to find out when they get there that the tickets are counterfeit. ""Homer to the Max"" After being ridiculed due to sharing the same name as a clumsy oaf of a cop on t.v., Homer changes his name to a kick a** one, Max Power. ""30 minutes over Tokyo"" You guessed it, the Simpsons visit Japan... and of course run into trouble. ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" A refreashing episode for Treehouse of Horror fans as the Simpsons fall asleep in church and each dream is a mini story about bible stories. (A pretty good episode even though it didn't sound so great on paper.) ""Mom and Pop Art"" Homer ""accidently"" becomes an artist due to his rage. Marge is a bit envious and Homer struggles to stay a 'pop'ular artist. ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" Homer becomes a killer with a new toupee, Bart and Lisa are trapped in the t.v. and Itchy and Scratchy try to kill them, and The Simpsons appear on the Jerry Springer show because Kang is Maggie's real father!Not as many stand out episodes as the previous seasons had, but is decent.

And rightly so, apparently.I have all the first nine seasons of ""The Simpsons"", and yes, it is some of the greatest, cleverest, pointiest American television ever produced. And the first ten episodes of season ten are really funny as well, although it becomes clear that from around episode five, the characters no longer have the same depth to them; they become more cliched and, yes, cartoonish. Perhaps that's when the holdover episodes ran out or something.I'm looking at the list of season ten episodes right now, and episode ten of season ten is the last really funny, really clever episode of the season. Sorry guys, but it is. You can't honestly tell me that you think 'Marge Simpson in: ""Screaming Yellow Honkers""' and ""Mom and Pop Art"" is up there with ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" or ""Bart of Darkness"".Halfway through season ten is where the Simpsons stopped being something truly special. Surprisingly few really clever and funny episodes can still be found scattered throughout the following seasons, but season eight was the last great Simpsons season.

1049420,A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B000MQCFLO,doomsdayer520,"[4, 6]","I'm with the know-it-all longtime Simpsons fans who bellyache about how the old days were the best. Some will disagree but any impartial viewer who watched all the seasons in order would independently conclude that the show reached its greatest comedic brilliance in seasons 3 through 8 (give or take), before falling into a dark period in which subversion was replaced by slapstick and intelligent laughs fell to cheap guffaws. In more recent seasons the series has made a comeback, and this year's great motion picture proves that Matt Groening and the team are still capable of great things. The 10th season is actually not as unsatisfying as I remembered, and might even be a little better than the very inconsistent 9th season. But still, the show was definitely in the transitional period between the golden age and the dark age.Some actual new ideas in the 10th season include the winning Easter trilogy ""Simpsons Bible Stories,"" and sending the family to Japan in ""Thirty Minutes over Tokyo."" There are also some fairly significant character developments for Marge in ""...'Screaming Yellow Honkers'"" Lisa in ""Make Room for Lisa,"" and Bart in ""Bart the Mother."" Unfortunately the robust supporting cast is mostly used for window dressing with few new insights into the characters (except for Apu in ""I'm with Cupid""), and these episodes continue my most objectionable trend in the latter seasons of the series - the simplified parodying of Homer. The once dense but lovably complex Homer keeps getting dumber and dumber, with his simplistic boneheadedness being played for cheap laughs to an extent that should embarrass the show's earlier writers and producers.Homer is also at the root of the most pervasive writing problem during this period of the series - the Super Homer Syndrome. Having Homer take on a new occupation or wacky scheme practically every week, which are then never mentioned again, indicates a severe shortage of new ideas. This issue is also evident in the growing reliance on guest voice actors who play themselves, which also happens almost every week this season, bottoming out in awful slumfest ""Sunday Cruddy Sunday."" Another issue is a general lack of integration between each episode's main plotline and the side story. The most telling example is ""Lisa Gets an 'A'"" in which the main story explores an important ethical crisis for Lisa, only for the episode to be nearly ruined by the asinine side story of Homer raising a lobster. In a show that has maintained a mostly high level of quality for a whopping 18 seasons (and counting), some ups and downs are forgivable. But it would take the Simpsons a while to recover from these creeping weaknesses, which during the 10th season became more prevalent than the show's longstanding strengths.

In fact there are some really excellent episodes in this season. As someone who thinks the show should've ended after Season 11, how can I possibly reject this season. And now a brief summary.1. Lard of the Dance - For this episode, the Lisa ""A"" story with Lisa Kudrow has its laughs but for me, it's all about the Homer and Bart ""B"" story where Homer thinks he can make a fortune by selling grease. You can't go wrong with Homer and a crazy scheme.2. The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace - Written by the prolific John Schwartzwelder, this episode features Homer attempting to emulate Thomas Edison's prolific inventing after suffering a mid-life crisis.3. Bart the Mother - An episode that got too sappy IMO. Bart accidently shoots a mother bird and decides to care for the eggs she apparently left. Nice third act though.4. Treehouse of Horror IX - Funny at the time but ages real fast. I - after Snake is executed, his toupee is donated to the one man that needs it most, Homer. II - What? Bart and Lisa are trapped in an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon? How humiliating! III - Hey kids, remember Jerry Springer. Well when he's not dancing with the real dancers, he has time to give a voice-over.5. When You Dish upon a Star - What? There are celebrities who choose to live in Springfield? Specifically Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger (in happier times) not only live there but choose to hire Homer as an assistant. Also, you get the occasional pop-in by Ron Howard who is there to raid the liquor cabinet.6. D'oh-in in the Wind - After visiting the commune where his mother hid, Homer decides that he wants to be a hippie which is due to infuriate the other hippies who live there (guest voiced by Martin Mull and the great George Carlin).7. Lisa Gets an ""A"" - Lisa cheated on a test? Well its true. Again the Homer B story is better when he takes care of a misunderstood lobster named Pinchy. The first episode with that great educator State Comptroller  Atkins.8. Homer Simpson in: ""Kidney Trouble"" - Just because Homer caused Grandpa to lost functionality in both off his kidneys, that doesn't mean that Homer actually has to donate one of his own kidneys to save Grandpa's life! Does it? Written by John Schwartzwelder.9. Mayored to the Mob - This is a hilarious episode from the BiMonSciFiCon to Mark Hamill in ""Guys and Dolls"" Yes, Luke be a Jedi tonight! Also, after protecting Mayor Quimby from a horde of angry sci-fiers, Quimby decides to hire Homer as his bodyguard.10. Viva Ned Flanders - Probably because there was already a casino in Springfield, none of the Simpsons ever decided to go to Las Vegas, that is until now. When Ned Flanders decides to make up for a life of not living on the edge, he decides to call Homer. While it was a funny episode, it helped spawn that undying premise of the Vegas wives.11. Wild Barts Can't Be Broken - After a spree of wanton vandalism (caused of course by Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney) the town enacts a curfew that prevents the kids from leaving the house.12. Sunday, Cruddy Sunday - Fred Willard guest voices as the travel agent who books a large group of the Springfield gents to a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII. A note of trivia, the date that this aired was also the premiere date of Family Guy. Read into that any meaning you like.13. Homer to the Max - Written by John Schwartzwelder, this episode still makes me laugh. Homer gets a lot of respect when a cool detective on TV named Homer Simpson hits the screen. However, after the pilot, they turn Det. Homer Simpson into a lazy, dumb ignoramus forcing Homer to change his name to (drumroll) MAX POWER. Remember, nobody snuggles with Max Power, you strap yourself in and feel the Gs.14. I'm with Cupid - Apu's extravagant gifts and affection for Manjula on Valentine's day force the rest of the male Springfield population to become irate. Guest appearance by Sir Elton John.15. Marge Simpson in: ""Screaming Yellow Honkers"" - Probably the first sitcom to take on road rage (not to mention the burgeoning phenom of female SUV driving) was the Simpsons. When Homer accidentally buys a lady Canyonero (Canyonero Yeee Hah!) Marge decides to drive it causing her to develop road rage.16. Make Room for Lisa - A nice Homer-Lisa story where for the first time, Lisa explores her own insensitivity to Homer. Also, a lot of Lindsay Naegle (before she was Lindsay Neagle) as the OmniTouch rep.17. Maximum Homerdrive - After losing a steak eating contest to a truck driver who eventually dies, Homer decides to deliver the dead man's payload. BTW, who knew that those trucks could drive themselves? Written by John Schwartzwelder.18. Simpsons Bible Stories - Rather than just explore Halloween themed ideas, why not try a more scary book like....I dunno.....the Bible. I - Homer and Marge are at the Garden of Eden, II - the Jews will escape the wrath of the evil pharoah by the leadership of Milhouse? III - Bart as David who now has to face Goliath's son, who is just as tall, and angrier.19. Mom and Pop Art - Underrated episode where Homer becomes a conceptual artist by accident. But when the art community rebuffs his newer work, Homer decides to try an artistic stunt so revolutionary that the art community would have to respect him. Also some great Arizona State bashing by Ned.20. The Old Man and the ""C"" Student - After Bart pulls a stunt that forces the IOC to reject Springfield as the site of the Olympic games, he has to do community service at the old folks' home. Meanwhile, Homer is dejected when his mascot idea, the Springfield Spring, is rendered useless forcing him to come up with other ideas for using the spring.21. Monty Can't Buy Me Love - Why don't the people like Monty Burns? That's what Monty wants to know especially after the dashing billionaire Arthur Fortune comes to town. Written by John Schwartzwelder.22. They Saved Lisa's Brain - Now this is a great episode. After witnessing the crude and idiotic behavior of the townspeople, Lisa writes an op-ed which allows her to join Springfield's Mensa society. Soon they take over the town which causes an uproar. Some great Comic Book Guy lines and oh btw, did I mention that Stephen Hawking makes an appearance as the voice of reason.23. Thirty Minutes over Tokyo - The Simpsons desire for an economical vacation leads them to take a trip to Japan. Because after going to Australia, why not try their luck at another country?The DVD set inclues audio commentary on every episode (odd but the audio commentaries are funnier than the new batch of shows), animation showcases, and many other special features.",5,Another Craptacular Season of the Simpsons,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,6695,"['Mike', 'Scully', 'reign', 'terror', 'continues.Ok',

Side-splitting stuff.""Mayored to the Mob"" is another highlight. Firstly, there's the bit in Mayor Quimby's limo where Quimby is taking time to advise Homer to accord himself with the sense of duty and respect demanded by employment with the mayor's office, only to then instruct him to honk at a scantilly clad lady walking down the street (Quimby: I couldn't be happier with how that went!)And then later, when it's revealed that Fat Tony has been milking rats to honour his contract to supply Springfield Elementary's milk, he says: ""I don't get it.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[16, 21]","By the time that Matt Groening's The Simpsons reached it's tenth season, the show was still going strong, and the tenth season remains one of the last great seasons of the long running animated sitcom. In this season, Homer thinks he can make a fortune by selling grease (""Lard of the Dance""), as well as growing jealous of Thomas Edison and seeking to become an inventor (""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace""). Marge develops road rage in ""Screaming Yellow Honkers"", which satires the SUV/mother craze, Bart cares for bird eggs in ""Bart the Mother"", and striking revenge when the kids of Springfield are put on an unjust curfew in ""Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"". It's Homer though who is in the best form throughout this season, as he also chickens out in donating a kidney to Grandpa in ""Kidney Trouble"", goes to Vegas with Flanders (""Viva Ned Flanders""), and becomes a reknowned artist, well, kind of, in ""Mom and Pop Art"". Also, the season ends with the family going to Tokyo, with naturally, hilarious results.

The 10th season is another excellent season of the Simpsons, filled with new (idiotic) adventures and more character development. The best episodes are Wild Barts Can't Be Broken, Viva Ned Flanders (come... who wouldn't love seeing Ned completely wasted?, Homer Simpson In: Kidney Trouble (the ending totally makes the episode for me), I'm With Cupid, Maximum Homerdrive (the sleeping pills and the caffeine pills scene is gold), and Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo. I also have to give special note to Make Room For Lisa, which explores the strained connection between Homer and Lisa, and shows a side of Lisa that every Simpson fan knew, at heart, was there, but it was never really explored. Of course, all of the episodes are great in there own way. There are some that aren't as good as others, granted, but there aren't any mediocre episodes to be found.It's far too often that a TV show is golden during its first 3 or 4 seasons, but then declines into pretentious idiocy that tries too hard to be funny, and it shows that the writers know they can't recapture the fire that the old episodes had *COUGH* Family Guy *COUGH*. However, The Simpsons is one of those rare shows that never loses it's genius or credibility. Yes, there are some episodes that don't stand out as much as the others, but that happens in every show. Even after nearly 20 years, they still have plenty of ideas stored for new episodes. Hopefully, however, the writers and the actors who play the voices have been looking for new work.

Seems unfair to start having special edition of each family members head only to stop with one last character.In any case, I can not wait for season ten to come out, regardless of some negative comments about the later seasons, I still enjoy watching them and will collect all the seasons as the come out until the show stops.",4,Fan of the show since it came out,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,704,"['OK', ""'ve"", 'been', 'collecting', 'DVD', 'started', 'release', 'them.My', 'question', 'what', 'happened', 'specail', 'edition', 'ones', 'know', 'ones', 'plastic', 'heads', 'family', 'member', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'ine', 'missing', 'Bart', 'Why', 'did', 'stop', 'one', 'showing', 'season', 'ten', 'box', 'one', 'will', 'show', 'special', 'edition', 'one', 'when', 'out', 'Seems', 'unfair', 'start', 'having', 'special', 'edition', 'family', 'members', 'head', 'only', 'stop', 'one', 'last', 'character.In', 'case', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', 'ten', 'come', 'out', 'regardless', 'negative', 'comments', 'later', 'seasons', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'will', 'collect', 'seasons', 'come', 'show']",The Simpsons: Season 10

You can tell that they still had some great storylines, but the last show ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" on Disc 3 shows the weakness of the season. By the time you finish Disc 4 you realize you won't replace it if the disc gets scratched up. For all of the hilarity at the beginning of the season you wonder how these last five episodes were ever approved.19. Mom and Pop Art20. The Old Man and the ""C"" Student21. Monty Can't Buy Me Love22. They Saved Lisa's Brain23. Thirty Minutes over TokyoI plan on buying the Eleventh and Twelfth Seasons since they still had some great episodes, but that's pretty much it. It took three seasons for the show to find its rhythm and for six years it was at the top of its game. The Tenth Season lacks the magic that David Mirkin, Conan O'Brien, and Brad Bird brought to earlier seasons. The Tenth Season is still a must for any Simpsons fan and outshines anything the TV show has offered in the last five years. Now I just pray that the show execs have the sense to retire a classic before it resembles the Rolling Stones. Even Troy McClure would be embarrassed to be in some of the new shows.",3,The beginning of the end,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,1228,"['Simpsons', 'Seasons', 'Five', 'Nine', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'peak', 'Tenth', 'Season', 'out', 'really', 'strong', 'can', 'tell', 'still', 'had', 'great', 'storylines', 'last', 'show', 'Simpsons', 'Bible', 'Stories', 'Disc', '3', 'weakness', 'season', 'time', 'finish', '4', 'realize', 'wo', ""n't"", 'replace', 'disc', 'scratched', 'up', 'hilarity', 'beginning', 'season', 'wonder', 'how', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'were', 'ever', 'approved.19', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'Art20', 'Old', 'Man', 'C', 'Student21', 'Monty', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love22', 'Saved', 'Lisa', 'Brain23', 'Thirty', 'Minutes', 'TokyoI', 'plan', 'buying', 'Eleventh', 'Twelfth', 'Seasons', 'still', 'had', 'great', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'much', 'took', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'find', 'rhythm', 'six', 'years', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'Tenth', 'Season', 'magic', 'David', 'Mirkin', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'Brad', 'Bird', 'brought', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Tenth', 'Season', 'still', 'must', 'Simpsons', 'fan', 'outshines', 'anything', 'TV', 'show', 'offered', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'Now', 'just', 'pray', 'show', 'execs', 'have', 'sense', 'retire', 'classic', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Even', 'Troy', 'McClure', 'would', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'new', 'shows']",The Simpsons: Season 10
