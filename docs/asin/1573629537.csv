A new one (to me) by Jamie Foxx and it has Nia Long in it? I love Jamie Foxx. He's a natural talent, someone I feel like I can relate too. Nia? Whatever she's selling, I'm buying. I don't care what it is, cars, clothes, music, just send her my way and she has a customer. But this film was sad. Nia isn't even in half of the movie!!! I must admit I waited for a laugh to come. I even tried forcing one at times, only to realize I was the only one laughing...I think the other point that sold me on this was that it was less than ten bucks. Thinking back, there were a ton of these on the shelf and I even remember others standing in line snickering and shaking their heads as if too say, ""he'll figure it out"". Yep, they got me! This has to be the low point in both Nia and Jamie's careers. Low budget, low on laughs, low on making any kind of sense. I still feel duped realizing that even as I write this mild diatribe, someone is gonna get curious and check this thing out for themselves. Nay-nay I say! Go get a good book to read instead. Which reminds me, first thing tomorrow I'll take this garbage to my local library and donate it. At least that way, the next recipient won't have to pay for it!DJ Come of Age",1,Some DVDs are best left on the shelf!,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,1325,"['admit', 'got', 'had', 'already', 'finished', 'shopping', 'when', 'looked', 'up', 'shelf', 'saw', 'Wow', 'new', 'one', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Nia', 'Long', 'love', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'natural', 'talent', 'someone', 'feel', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'Nia', 'Whatever', 'selling', ""'m"", 'buying', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'cars', 'clothes', 'music', 'just', 'send', 'way', 'customer', 'film', 'was', 'sad', 'Nia', ""n't"", 'even', 'half', 'movie', 'must', 'admit', 'waited', 'laugh', 'come', 'even', 'tried', 'forcing', 'one', 'times', 'only', 'realize', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'laughing', 'think', 'other', 'point', 'sold', 'was', 'was', 'less', 'ten', 'bucks', 'Thinking', 'back', 'were', 'ton', 'shelf', 'even', 'remember', 'others', 'standing', 'line', 'snickering', 'shaking', 'heads', 'too', 'say', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'Yep', 'got', 'be', 'low', 'point', 'Nia', 'Jamie', 'careers', 'Low', 'budget', 'low', 'laughs', 'low', 'making', 'kind', 'sense', 'still', 'feel', 'duped', 'realizing', 'that', 'even', 'write', 'mild', 'diatribe', 'someone', 'gon', 'get', 'curious', 'check', 'thing', 'out', 'Nay-nay', 'say', 'Go', 'get', 'good', 'book', 'read', 'instead', 'Which', 'first', 'thing', 'tomorrow', ""'ll"", 'take', 'garbage', 'local', 'library', 'donate', 'least', 'way', 'next', 'recipient', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'DJ', 'Come', 'Age']",N/A

When the credits started to run I was so relieved because I did not like this movie.  I did not laugh, and it took all my self control not to open my DVD player, take this movie and toss it like a Frisbee!!!Michael's (Jamie Foxx) girlfriend finds out he spend their money they were saving for a house on the car they are riding in she gets angry and leaves him in the middle of now where in Nevada.  Michael's cherished car is then stolen while he is in a connivance store, and then the very story is held up by some bumbling crooks.  All Michael wants is to get his car back and find his way to the airport to make up with his girlfriend and beg her forgiveness.  Instead he is trying to negotiate with the backwards law enforcement and the crook to get out unscathed.  I really wanted to like this movie being that I'm such a huge fan of Jamie and Nia's, I even like Jake Busey, but this movie was so pathetic, there was nothing I enjoyed more then returning this movie to the rental place.Nia's talents were really wasted in this film.  She is in the very beginning, and then mostly in the end.  I don't care how much you want to get away from your man when you are angry, I do not know a single sister who would get on the back of a pick up truck with a bunch of red necks in the middle of nowhere!!!
