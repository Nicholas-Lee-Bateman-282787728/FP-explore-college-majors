I'm glad I did.As pretty much everyone has mentioned, this is an updating of the Cinderella story set in New York's Chinatown. The story was adapted well. The characters are all well realized. Yes the step sisters are nasty but they're nasty in a believable way given their station. They aren't two dimensional cartoon nasties. Likewise, ""mom"" is a great nasty. Like the step sisters there is real gravity in her character. The fact that it is alluded to that she has a drug problem puts that extra bit of scariness in her. Her lecherous brother is also interesting. He's not just a bad guy. He's more pitiful and seems he might, himself, be under the thumb of ""mom."" The hero, Johnny, is a way cool guy. A kind-hearted musician who you can't help but root for.I was a bit hesitant to see this only because of the digital roboscoping technique used in the filming. That (or a similar technique) was used in ""A Scanner Darkly"" and I found it distracting. Here however it's used to great effect. It's much more subtle and is altered throughout to enhance the mood of a given scene. At times I thought I was seeing paintings from some of the great impressionists. This is a fascinating movie to watch.I cannot say enough about this. For my money everything was just right. The plot elements were adapted well. The performances were good. The look was good. The music score was outstanding. There was nothing too cute or too maudlin. The elements were all graced with a deft touch.Having grown up on Disney, it's easy to think I couldn't go back to something like this. That fairy tales are set a certain way and that's it. Not the case here. This is a great film by any standard and deserves a wide audience.",5,Great Adaption of an Old Tale,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,1831,"[""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Kaplan', 'work', 'was', 'such', 'positive', 'outpouring', 'film', 'seemed', 'senseless', 'not', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.As', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'mentioned', 'updating', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'Chinatown', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'realized', 'Yes', 'step', 'sisters', 'are', 'nasty', ""'re"", 'nasty', 'believable', 'way', 'given', 'station', 'are', ""n't"", 'two', 'dimensional', 'cartoon', 'nasties', 'Likewise', 'mom', 'great', 'nasty', 'step', 'sisters', 'real', 'gravity', 'character', 'fact', 'alluded', 'drug', 'problem', 'extra', 'bit', 'scariness', 'lecherous', 'brother', 'also', 'interesting', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'guy', 'more', 'pitiful', 'might', 'be', 'thumb', 'mom', 'hero', 'Johnny', 'way', 'cool', 'guy', 'kind-hearted', 'musician', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'for.I', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'see', 'only', 'digital', 'roboscoping', 'technique', 'used', 'filming', 'similar', 'technique', 'was', 'used', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'found', 'distracting', 'Here', 'however', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'altered', 'enhance', 'mood', 'given', 'scene', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'seeing', 'paintings', 'great', 'impressionists', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'watch.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'money', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'plot', 'elements', 'were', 'adapted', 'well', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'look', 'was', 'good', 'music', 'score', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'nothing', 'too', 'cute', 'too', 'maudlin', 'elements', 'were', 'graced', 'deft', 'touch.Having', 'grown', 'up', 'Disney', 'easy', 'think', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'something', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'set', 'certain', 'way', 'Not', 'case', 'here', 'great', 'film', 'standard', 'wide', 'audience']",N/A

Uniquely done using the amazing Studio Artist application (one of my favorites), this is an emotionally engaging film. Although filmed, the entire film was then painted. It did not get an adequate public release, which is disappointing. I can't quite give it five stars, but I'd give it over four. Some fine acting, especially by Randall Duk Kim who played three great parts. It took me forever to find a version I could watch. I was finally able to find a rental copy through AppleTV. As far as I know, this film is unrated. Some nudity. Adult situations. No sex. Rare language. Some violence, though not close to other films. I would suggest it might be a PG-13, though a good argument could be made that it should be an R. From several perspectives, this is art.

I really enjoyed this Asian version that was filmed in NYC.As a previous reviewer wrote, it is wise to realize that &#34;Year of the Fish&#34; is filmed with a digital painting technique.  For some people, I could see how this aspect would not be appealing.  However, I found it especially touching when the director would focus distinctly upon the faces of our heroine and her &#34;prince&#34;.  This technique displayed so well the confusion, appeal and eventual realization of how the two characters connect with a gentle smile touched with tenderness.I was also especially impressed with the actress playing Mrs. Su as the &#34;stepmother&#34; element.  Her final line in the movie shows the sadness/bitterness that can come from falling in love and its real-life consequences.  It fleshes out a slight subtext beyond what lies behind her hard and cruel exterior.Ye Xian as Cinderella and Johnny as the &#34;prince&#34; have beautiful chemistry together and truly were well cast in their roles.I recommend it to &#34;Cinderella&#34; fans and for those who have interest in Asian culture.

She is employed by Mrs. Su (Tsai Chin), who runs a massage parlor in the heart of Chinatown.  Ye Xian refuses to do the sex work, so she is made into a lowly servant who must do all the laundry, cleaning, shopping, and cooking.  Her only comforts are an enchanted fish given to her by the mysterious hunchback Auntie Yaga (Randall Duk Kim) and her fleeting encounters with the handsome Johnny (Ken Leung), a struggling jazz musician.The film was shot entirely in New York City's Chinatown.
