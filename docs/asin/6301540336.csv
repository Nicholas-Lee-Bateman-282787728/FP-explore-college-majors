Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[2, 3]","Although this film should have been restored before the transfer to DVD and the subtitles are hard to read as they blend into the white areas, this is still a masterpiece of a film you can not afford not to see if you like Pasolini. ""Accattone"" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini, but by a strange coincidence it ended up being the very last of all his movies that I saw. I had seen everything he ever did, including short films by the time I got to ""Accatone"" and still found it masterful.Franco Citti stars as the title character, he is a handsome pimp in Rome's post-war lower depths, with an endearing face that speaks volumes of his street-wise upbringing in the slums. To those unaccustomed with Southern Italian culture the way he spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy may seem vile, but it is actually a well grounded tradition, as is also his support of the entire family of his imprisoned friend, Ciccio, who depend on him for survival. He is obviously a fellow mobster, and their code of honor is at stake when Accatone discovers that he is in prison as a result of his whore, Maddalena, played by Silvana Corsini, who denounced Ciccio to the authorities. Even though she is recovering from a broken leg, Accatone forces her to go on the streets, where she is used, beaten and abandoned by Accatone's pals after he tells them the story, then she is found by the police and arrested. Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income, he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his seduction act and her virile, beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense erotically-charged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men.After meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella, (Franca Pasut) he is smitten and tries to get a job, so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long.Never have I seen a more humane, direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all, and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.",5,A Passolini Must-See,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2723,"['film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'are', 'hard', 'read', 'blend', 'white', 'areas', 'still', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'not', 'see', 'like', 'Pasolini', 'Accattone', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Italian', 'neo-realist', 'Pier', 'Paolo', 'Pasolini', 'strange', 'coincidence', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'last', 'movies', 'saw', 'had', 'seen', 'everything', 'ever', 'did', 'including', 'short', 'films', 'time', 'got', 'Accatone', 'still', 'found', 'Citti', 'stars', 'title', 'character', 'handsome', 'pimp', 'Rome', 'post-war', 'lower', 'depths', 'endearing', 'face', 'volumes', 'street-wise', 'upbringing', 'slums', 'unaccustomed', 'Southern', 'Italian', 'culture', 'way', 'days', 'other', 'local', 'pimps', 'playing', 'cards', 'being', 'lazy', 'may', 'seem', 'vile', 'actually', 'well', 'grounded', 'tradition', 'also', 'support', 'entire', 'family', 'imprisoned', 'friend', 'Ciccio', 'who', 'depend', 'survival', 'obviously', 'fellow', 'mobster', 'code', 'honor', 'stake', 'when', 'Accatone', 'prison', 'result', 'whore', 'Maddalena', 'played', 'Silvana', 'Corsini', 'who', 'denounced', 'Ciccio', 'authorities', 'Even', 'recovering', 'broken', 'leg', 'Accatone', 'go', 'streets', 'where', 'used', 'beaten', 'abandoned', 'Accatone', 'pals', 'story', 'then', 'found', 'police', 'arrested', 'Accattone', 'nearly', 'death', 'total', 'lack', 'income', 'even', 'jewelry', 'get', 'reunite', 'wife', 'whom', 'fathered', 'least', 'one', 'child', 'seduction', 'act', 'virile', 'beautiful', 'brother', 'up', 'Accatone', 'intense', 'erotically-charged', 'scene', 'simulate', 'sexual', 'assault', 'as', 'much', 'violence', 'men.After', 'meeting', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'Stella', 'Franca', 'Pasut', 'smitten', 'tries', 'get', 'job', 'can', 'support', 'family', 'not', 'accustomed', 'hardship', 'lack', 'patience', 'typical', 'spoilt', 'types', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'trained', 'work', 'not', 'make', 'job', 'last', 'very', 'long.Never', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'humane', 'direct', 'simple', 'depiction', 'tragic', 'life', 'undesirables', 'society', 'Pasolini', 'master', 'painter', 'narrating', 'few', 'gestures', 'hardship', 'suffering', 'Even', 'getting', 'plate', 'food', 'world', 'memorable', 'accomplishment', 'see', 'whole', 'setting', 'sideline', 'modern', 'society', 'inability', 'function', 'properly', ""'corrections"", 'police', 'seem', 'be', 'most', 'unjust', 'Pasolini', 'panorama', 'human', 'failing', 'allegory', 'human', 'struggle', 'spiritual', 'redemption']",Accatone VHS

254891,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,6301540336,Peter Baklava,"[0, 0]","""Accatone"" is an interesting movie for the fact that it focuses on groups of young Italian men, in the manner that was adopted decades later by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese in the United States.  There is an unapologetically hard exterior to this movie, in the macho swaggerings of the young men and the flagrant denigration of women.In the title character, played by Franco Citti, the film presents a character who although he is largely unmotivated, vain and lost, still displays a latent softer side.  Though he manipulates a guileless girl named Stella into becoming a prostitute, she is so humiliated by the experience that Accatone becomes protective of her and tentatively tries to change his wayward life.With saintly music provided by a Bach-filled soundtrack, and strong Mediterranean light bleaching the daylight scenes into a kind of purity, this film has religious undertones beneath the vulgarity of the impoverished characters.  Franco Citti has a complex face that reminds me simultaneously of Michael Sarrazin and Willem Dafoe in its combination of sensitivity and cruelty.Made in the early 1960's, the toughness of this movie is in stark contrast to the rather flaccid entertainments that were the predominant product of Hollywood at the time.  Although it is not nearly so violent as the later films of Coppola and Scorcese, I believe that this film and others like it provided a blueprint for the dark, gritty realism that those directors banked on in films like ""The Godfather"", ""Raging Bull"",""Goodfellas"", and ""Mean Streets"" (...and Franco Citti in fact joined the cast of ""The Godfather"" as one of Michael Corleone's Italian bodyguards.)",4,An Influence on Coppola and Scorsese,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,1672,"['Accatone', 'interesting', 'movie', 'fact', 'groups', 'young', 'Italian', 'men', 'manner', 'was', 'adopted', 'decades', 'later', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'United', 'States', 'unapologetically', 'hard', 'exterior', 'movie', 'macho', 'swaggerings', 'young', 'men', 'flagrant', 'denigration', 'women.In', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Franco', 'Citti', 'film', 'character', 'who', 'largely', 'unmotivated', 'vain', 'lost', 'still', 'latent', 'softer', 'side', 'guileless', 'girl', 'named', 'Stella', 'becoming', 'prostitute', 'so', 'humiliated', 'experience', 'Accatone', 'protective', 'tentatively', 'tries', 'change', 'wayward', 'life.With', 'saintly', 'music', 'provided', 'Bach-filled', 'soundtrack', 'strong', 'Mediterranean', 'light', 'bleaching', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'kind', 'purity', 'film', 'religious', 'undertones', 'vulgarity', 'impoverished', 'characters', 'Franco', 'Citti', 'complex', 'face', 'simultaneously', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'combination', 'sensitivity', 'cruelty.Made', 'early', '1960', 'toughness', 'movie', 'stark', 'contrast', 'rather', 'flaccid', 'entertainments', 'were', 'predominant', 'product', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'violent', 'later', 'films', 'Coppola', 'Scorcese', 'believe', 'film', 'others', 'provided', 'blueprint', 'dark', 'gritty', 'realism', 'directors', 'banked', 'films', 'Godfather', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Goodfellas', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Franco', 'Citti', 'fact', 'joined', 'cast', 'Godfather', 'one', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Italian', 'bodyguards']",Accatone VHS
254892,A163UCXVIN6L8A,6301540336,"Rayv ""Dann""","[0, 3]","Accatone is an interesting film because Pasolini exposes to his audience a particular lifestyle and social class which would not be accurately touched on in an American picture. If Hollywood had ever discussed Accatone's subject matter they would display it with all their stereotypical adornments and falsities which most US moviegoers are accustomed to. Pasolini is not afraid to present the grittier side of the subproletariat as is epitomized in the film's main character, Accatone, who struggles with his profession of pimping and becoming more sensitive to his women and to the world. Pasolini's debut is delicately permeated with political concepts and allegories, yet we can see that he is experimenting newly with the technique of film and developing a filmic narrative structure. More of Pasolini's full-fledged sociopolitical allegories would be pursued in films like The Gospel and Hawks and Sparrows. The film stars Franco Citti who at the time of making of the film was a nonprofessional. However his performance is substantial considering him being a novice and having his voice overdubbed by another actor. Citti would soon become a Pasolini regular, starring in Oedipus Rex, Arabian Nights, and other supporting roles. However, as the film progresses the attention is centered on the female lead, who plays the naive soon-to-be callous farm worker who is duped by Accatone into prostitution. Before Pasolini ventured into the cinema he had a knack for writing. In his first two novels Pasolini had utilized the language of his mother's homeland, Friuli, for colloquial discourse amongst his characters who lived in subproletariat communities. It is not surprising that the subject of these novels would be the focal point of Accatone. In addition I believe Pasolini had rendered his ideas (from his literature) appropriately for his film, yet not becoming too carried away with fidelity and technical aspects which are profuse in films today. To this day there are apparently no film directors so consciously aware of his country and goverment as Pasolini was and that would transcend these beliefs into his art with controversy yet at the same time subtlety.",5,It all started here.,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2176,"['Accatone', 'interesting', 'film', 'Pasolini', 'audience', 'particular', 'lifestyle', 'social', 'class', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'accurately', 'touched', 'American', 'picture', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'ever', 'discussed', 'Accatone', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'display', 'stereotypical', 'adornments', 'falsities', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Pasolini', 'not', 'afraid', 'present', 'grittier', 'side', 'subproletariat', 'epitomized', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Accatone', 'who', 'profession', 'pimping', 'becoming', 'more', 'sensitive', 'women', 'world', 'Pasolini', 'debut', 'delicately', 'permeated', 'political', 'concepts', 'allegories', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'experimenting', 'newly', 'technique', 'film', 'developing', 'filmic', 'narrative', 'structure', 'More', 'Pasolini', 'full-fledged', 'sociopolitical', 'allegories', 'would', 'be', 'pursued', 'films', 'Gospel', 'Hawks', 'Sparrows', 'film', 'stars', 'Franco', 'Citti', 'who', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'nonprofessional', 'However', 'performance', 'substantial', 'considering', 'being', 'novice', 'having', 'voice', 'overdubbed', 'actor', 'Citti', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'Pasolini', 'regular', 'starring', 'Oedipus', 'Rex', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'However', 'film', 'attention', 'centered', 'female', 'lead', 'who', 'naive', 'soon-to-be', 'callous', 'farm', 'worker', 'who', 'duped', 'Accatone', 'prostitution', 'Pasolini', 'ventured', 'cinema', 'had', 'knack', 'writing', 'first', 'two', 'novels', 'Pasolini', 'had', 'utilized', 'language', 'mother', 'homeland', 'Friuli', 'colloquial', 'discourse', 'amongst', 'characters', 'who', 'lived', 'subproletariat', 'communities', 'not', 'surprising', 'subject', 'novels', 'would', 'be', 'focal', 'point', 'Accatone', 'addition', 'believe', 'Pasolini', 'had', 'rendered', 'ideas', 'literature', 'appropriately', 'film', 'yet', 'not', 'becoming', 'too', 'carried', 'away', 'fidelity', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'profuse', 'films', 'today', 'day', 'are', 'apparently', 'film', 'directors', 'so', 'consciously', 'aware', 'country', 'goverment', 'Pasolini', 'was', 'would', 'transcend', 'beliefs', 'art', 'controversy', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'subtlety']",Accatone VHS

254897,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6301540336,Westley,"[2, 3]","""Accattone"" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini.  Franco Citti stars as the title character, a small-time pimp in the slums of Rome.  He spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy.  However, when his girlfriend/prostitute (Maddalena) is arrested, Accattone nearly starves to death.  He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his act and has her brother beat up Accatonne.  He also tries to get a job, but he's clearly not willing to do menial tasks for little pay for very long.  Finally, he meets and woos the beautiful, naive Stella (Franca Pasut), and soon he professes his true love to her.  The tension builds as the audience guesses whether Accattone is simply trying to turn Stella into the next Maddalena.Few films have more accurately captured the desperation of pimps and prostitutes, and Pasolini's use of mostly non-actors works spectacularly.  Accattone does some horrible things (the scene with his young son is unforgettable), but Citti's unsentimental performance strikes all the right chords and keeps the audience almost rooting for him in a strange and somewhat sick way.  Pasolini's work here is all first-rate.  The dvd includes one interesting extra - a 30-minute documentary from 1970 chronicling Pasolini's work, which includes interviews with some of the actors with whom he's worked as well as the Italian thinkers of the day.  Pasolini was an interesting character, to say the least; not many directors have brought such a unique political perspective to film.Unfortunately, as has been noted by other reviewers, the dvd transfer is rather dismal.  The black-and-white movie is washed out here, with many of the daytime scenes overly saturated with light.  Furthermore, the subtitles are all in white and barely readable during a number of scenes.  Because of the horrendous subtitles, I had a great deal of difficulty following the movie at times.  This great film deserves a better transfer; ""Accattone"" deserves five-stars, but the four-star rating reflects the dvd quality.
