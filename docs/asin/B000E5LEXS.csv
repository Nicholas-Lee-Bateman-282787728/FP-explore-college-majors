The guy somehow gets away with ripping on every racial group and is never called out on it because he uses puppets I guess? I heard a lot about this guy and decided to watch this specific special on Comedy Central. It's effing horrible! None of the jokes or impersonations are that great or funny. I let out maybe one or two ""ha!'s"" during the whole thing. Not a laugh, just a ""ha!"", like ""Wow, this guy is so bad!"".Everyone seems to love the ""Dead Terrorist"" character who just says ""I kill you!"" over and over. It's not funny. I wonder what the families of 9/11 and those overseas fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq think about that garbage. His redneck and grumpy white guy characters are also just as lame and unfunny. If I wanted to see rednecks, I'd just watch Larry the Cable Guy. Hell, I thought that the Blue Collar Guys weren't that funny, but compared to Jeff Dunham, they are great. If I wanted to see an old guy grumble and make lewd comments, I'd just go visit my own Grandpa. He's 100 times funnier than Jeff Dunham's puppet.I heard a lot of hype about this guy, only to find out that he is a complete unfunny nerd. Maybe it's accepted widely as ""Family Comedy"" because there is not really much use of profanity, but I think that promoting every sort of racial stereotype out there with these puppets is far more offensive than the dirtiest joke, an hour of curse words and anything that Howard Stern has ever said on the radio that ""Christians"" and the FCC found so offensive.",1,Lame.

Though, honestly, I never had a chance to see any of his shows til more recently on several TV shows on TV. When I saw this first DVD, I was curious to buy it just to see how well he does in his shows. Besides, you hardly ever see DVDs of Ventriloquists performing unless they are independently done and sold & those, my friend, are hard to come by(your normal everyday joe doesn't go to alot of comedy shows). If you do see DVDs of Ventrilquists, it's usually geared more towards kids(like ""The Shari Show"" with Shari Lewis, ""Zoey's Wild Things"" with Mallory Lewis-both of which I recommend for the younger set- or something in that vein).  Up until recently; my favorite Ventriloquists were Edgar Bergen, Jimmy Nelson, Shari Lewis, and a couple more closer to my age...Mark Wade & Jay Johnson(Star of the old comedy series, ""Soap""). After seeing this DVD, I'm proud to add Jeff to the list. I tell you, I never laughed so hard for so long in my life. In this DVD, you meet Walter(a wisecracking old man who bellyaches about almost everything), Sweet Daddy D(Jeff's blunt but hilarious agent), Bubba J(a slow but surprising funny NASCAR nut)  Peanut(a wacky wacky youngster from the Micronesian Islands), and Jose the Jalapeno(a Jalapeno from Mexico- on a steeeeeek! What more can be said there..). Performing stand-up comedy with his pals, Jeff is at his peak with this show. If you don't get any other Jeff Dunham DVD, get this one.

I remember praying that I would get a chance to see this great ventriloquist again and finally my prayer's are answered. After years of getting laughs from vulgarity riddled standups from the likes of Red Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Andrew Dice Clay, I finally can have a stand up comedy that is hilarious and I can watch with my children.In this standup, Jeff introduces 2 new friends, Bubba J and Sweet Daddy Dee who are as funny as  the other 3. Bubba is a bucktoothed,beer belly redneck who is hysterically strereotyped as such, Sweet Daddy Dee is Jeffs new manager who insists he's Jeff's pimp. Though both new characters are hysterical, Walter (the grouchy old man) and Peanut (you would swear he's on speed), and Jose Jalapeno(On A Steek)are still my favorites.One of the greatest strengths of Jeff is his ability to bring forth totally different personalities as if 5 different comedians are voicing for each.

I love his facial expressions and gestures more than any of the others. I can almost forget he's just a doll, he's so accurately real for an old codger. He is definitely politically incorrect in the funniest way. I love Walter and he gave me several chuckles in this show, particularly with the improv stuff he does with the audience.I also like Jose. Sure, he's a bit 'stereotypical', but then again, I think that's the point of him too. When Jeff Dunham gets to going with two, three or four of the dolls at once, it is quite impressive... on a steeeeeek.Peanut is okay. He's funny, but he's a bit odd. I like Bubba J. But Sweet Daddy doesn't do it for me. I didn't mind the standup routine with Sweet Daddy, but I really disliked the commentary in the green room and the 'pimping' with the girls and stuff that wasn't part of the stage show. It wasn't really necessary and it wasn't really all that funny either. It was definitely racist and overtly stereotypical of a very negative type.I would have given the show a five if it had made me laugh out loud a bit more and if Sweet Daddy wasn't part of the act. Even with these things, Dunham is talented and he has a good show. He uses a little bit of crude language, but it's not really excessive, and there are some sexual innuendo, but nothing super graphic. It's mostly a humorous, clean show, with just enough edge to be 'adult' or 'grown up'. Dunham is expert at making you forget he's a ventriloquist and the cameras get good angles on the dolls to make them seem more realistic.All in all, it was a good way to spend an evening chuckling at some silly jokes and enjoying Dunham's talent.

I found him quite amusing, and I still do, but with at least one caveat: he tries too hard these days to inject his political axe-grinding into the act. Rather like Drew Carey and the creators of South Park -- two other right-wing comedians who are actually funny when they stick to comedy -- he apparently thinks he's accumulated enough of a following that he should now use his clout to promote the cause. (See the dead terrorist skit and the Prius/Hummer one.) They really aren't funny and are pretty ineffective; those who praise those two skits can't be doing so on comedic merits, because those skits have almost none. It's a pity, really, because when Dunham sticks to comedy, he's really pretty talented (see the opening monologue about the puppet and the airport screeners, as well as the ones about Bubba and his wife -- ""Where'd you meet her? At the family reunion"" -- as well as almost everything on here (Walter and the ""menstrual cycle"" is very amusing) except the pimp bit, which was rather forced. Dude... you're a comedian.

The few minutes at the start before the first puppet comes to life is average stand-up at most, but once the puppetskick in JD shines in his performance up to the end.The DVD contains a live stage show at Santa Ana that was very well shot and directed, with very good sound and picture quality.I've reduced a star for the DVD production because of:A. The total lack of subtitles. I think that a product that is aimed at such a wide audience must come with subtitles, and this should be a basic feature of every DVD, especially one that (as stated on th back of this one)pertains to ""...set the new standard for how truly awesome a comedy DVD can be."" Some titles go as far as having subtitles for the commentary track which is really great.B. There seems to be a problem with 2 bonus clips, that appear on the menu but fail to play, no matter what playback option I tried. (any comment on that would be appreciated - maybe I missed how to play it)Regarding the other extras:There are two nice outtakes with a short commentary track, running around 3 minutes each.There's also a full feature audio commentary track that is well worth hearing. It has JD (+ Walter) and Kelly Ashbury (Author of Dummy Days and co-director of Shrek 2) having a fluent free conversation about ventriloquism at general and of JD's career and show in particular.That is, of course, if you're not offended by Walter's remark at the beginning of the commentary:""...If the folks are actually listening to this audio commentary..you have no life at this point, wouldn't that be about the truth,if you have enough time to sit down and listen to this crap..""Bottom line - highly recommended if you like good non-PC comedy and have an affection to this fascinating form of art.",4,A welcome boost to a fascinating endangered art form.,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2901,"['reviewer', 'mentioned', 'was', 'also', 'introduced', 'JD', '14', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'showed', 'very', 'funny', 'Achmed', 'Dead', 'Terrorist', 'sketch', 'internet.Although', 'specific', 'DVD', 'not', 'contain', 'above', 'puppet', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'highly', 'talented', 'artist.You', 'should', 'however', 'check', 'first', 'sharing', 'fun', 'kids', 'most', 'stuff', 'adult', 'audience', 'only.It', 'many', 'sexual', 'references', 'lots', 'stuff', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'offending', 'non-PC', '.This', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'grumpy', 'old', 'bigot', 'pimp..There', 'actually', 'bleeped', 'audio', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'non-bleeped', 'one', 'audience', 'many', 'times', 'Ohhhhh', 'instead', 'simple', 'laughter', 'wherever', 'jokes', 'go', 'belt', 'One', 'beauties', 'ventriloquism', 'ease', 'such', 'stuff', 'accepted', 'audience', 'point', 'well', 'discussed', 'commentary', 'where', 'point', 'JDlaughs', 'lines', 'able', 'cross', 'puppets', 'could', 'almost', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'Personally', 'found', 'show', 'very', 'funny', 'JD', 'very', 'good', 'performer', 'few', 'minutes', 'start', 'first', 'puppet', 'life', 'average', 'stand-up', 'most', 'once', 'puppetskick', 'JD', 'shines', 'performance', 'up', 'end.The', 'DVD', 'live', 'stage', 'show', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'directed', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality.I', ""'ve"", 'reduced', 'star', 'DVD', 'production', 'total', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'think', 'product', 'aimed', 'wide', 'audience', 'must', 'come', 'subtitles', 'should', 'be', 'basic', 'feature', 'DVD', 'especially', 'one', 'stated', 'th', 'back', 'one', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'how', 'truly', 'awesome', 'comedy', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'titles', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'having', 'subtitles', 'commentary', 'track', 'really', 'great.B', 'be', 'problem', '2', 'bonus', 'clips', 'appear', 'menu', 'fail', 'play', 'matter', 'what', 'option', 'tried', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated', 'maybe', 'missed', 'how', 'play', 'Regarding', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'two', 'nice', 'outtakes', 'short', 'commentary', 'track', 'running', 'around', '3', 'minutes', 'each.There', 'also', 'full', 'feature', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'well', 'worth', 'hearing', 'JD', '+', 'Walter', 'Kelly', 'Ashbury', 'Author', 'Dummy', 'Days', 'co-director', 'Shrek', '2', 'having', 'fluent', 'free', 'conversation', 'ventriloquism', 'general', 'JD', 'career', 'show', 'particular.That', 'course', ""'re"", 'not', 'offended', 'Walter', 'remark', 'beginning', 'commentary', 'folks', 'are', 'actually', 'listening', 'audio', 'commentary..you', 'have', 'life', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'truth', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'listen', 'crap..', 'Bottom', 'line', 'highly', 'recommended', 'like', 'good', 'non-PC', 'comedy', 'have', 'affection', 'fascinating', 'form', 'art']",Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself
