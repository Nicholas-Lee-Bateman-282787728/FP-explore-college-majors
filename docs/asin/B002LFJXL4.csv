Unfortunately, mainstream reporters didn't ever ask MJ about this, just more shallow or sensationalized stuff, so this is what we do have to learn about this. I am glad it is on film, even is it is grainy quality deposition film!! I loved hearing him describe writing a song and him singing the parts too.",5,deposition was interesting to me,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,477,"['liked', 'listening', '1993', 'deposition', 'Interviews', 'vol.2', 'got', 'hear', 'Michael', 'creative', 'process', 'how', 'went', 'composing', 'songs', 'Unfortunately', 'mainstream', 'reporters', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'ask', 'MJ', 'just', 'more', 'shallow', 'sensationalized', 'stuff', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'learn', 'am', 'glad', 'film', 'even', 'grainy', 'quality', 'deposition', 'film', 'loved', 'hearing', 'describe', 'writing', 'song', 'singing', 'parts', 'too']",Michael Jackson - The Interviews Vol 2

I bought both 1 & 2 and really love the one with opera talking between clips after his death. Its heartwarming, funny, entertaining and sometimes a bit sad.

He was a spiritual advisor and I do not believe these were tapes that were meant to be heard. I did read some of the book-standing in Wal Mart and it is amazing listening to MJs take on things...however shmulley should ahve known it would be twisted by some readers and media (just see how they tore into what he said about Madonna) Another Rabbi has come out and slammed Schmulley for printing his book-counseling sessions are always recorded but they are not to break confidentiality.I don't know what this is or if it is even that-just ssyin.",3,"IF THIS IS THE ""MICHAEL JACKSON TAPES""",1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,657,"['tapes', 'Rabbi', 'Schmulley', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'Schmulley', 'lied', 'whay', 'cut', 'ties', 'MJ', 'was', 'spiritual', 'advisor', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'were', 'tapes', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'heard', 'did', 'read', 'book-standing', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'amazing', 'listening', 'MJs', 'take', 'things', 'however', 'shmulley', 'should', 'ahve', 'known', 'would', 'be', 'twisted', 'readers', 'media', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'tore', 'what', 'said', 'Madonna', 'Rabbi', 'come', 'out', 'slammed', 'Schmulley', 'printing', 'book-counseling', 'sessions', 'are', 'always', 'recorded', 'are', 'not', 'break', 'confidentiality.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'even', 'that-just', 'ssyin']",Michael Jackson - The Interviews Vol 2

Neels,"[8, 8]","i purchased this dvd included in my mega-box set that i got - i thought it was absolutely wonderful.it starts out with mj narrating home movies about himself - when he was little having snowball fights, dancing at his home, his first christmas in which elizabeth taylor surprised him and decorated the whole neverland ranch for the holidays, fun takes of him having water balloon fights and being pushed in the pool, dancing on the high dive, jumping on his trampoline, having an easter egg hunt, he scene where he receives a present from elizabeth taylor of gypsy (his elephant) and then gives her a really nice drawing in return, explains how he had a day for his father at neverland where he and janet got thier dad a boat, how his friends put on a day for him to go shopping in a regular grocery store (which is something he never gets to do since fans always end up wanting autographs) - it really was fun to watch. it's neat to see footage of mj going into hospitals as well and caring for the children.it then goes to the footage of the martin bashir interview that was captured by michael's own camera - so it is the unedited, good version of the footage. that was really cool to watch, too.then it goes to a deposition in which mj answers tons of questions about whether he actually wrote ""the girl is mine"" and ""we are the world"" or stole them from some one else - he was also questioned about ""thriller"" - which i found fascinating to watch, but felt sorry for him, too, because the lawyers questioned him for so long and were so picky on phrasing that i could tell he was getting tired - he had just had a concert the night before and was hoarse so he kept having to drink water and clear his throat a lot. it was very cool to hear him tell how he actually goes about writing songs and it was awesome to hear him give examples of that by making the noises from his seat - there was a part where he was giving an example of how he hears every part of a song in his head and he sat there and made noises for the song ""who is it"" - amazing!i am glad i purchased this as a part of the box set instead of by itself since it worked out financially better to do so.",5,really great,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,2170,"['i', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'included', 'mega-box', 'set', 'i', 'got', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful.it', 'out', 'mj', 'narrating', 'home', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'having', 'snowball', 'fights', 'dancing', 'home', 'first', 'christmas', 'elizabeth', 'taylor', 'surprised', 'decorated', 'whole', 'neverland', 'ranch', 'holidays', 'fun', 'having', 'water', 'balloon', 'fights', 'being', 'pushed', 'pool', 'dancing', 'high', 'dive', 'jumping', 'trampoline', 'having', 'easter', 'egg', 'hunt', 'where', 'present', 'elizabeth', 'taylor', 'gypsy', 'elephant', 'then', 'really', 'nice', 'drawing', 'return', 'how', 'had', 'day', 'father', 'neverland', 'where', 'janet', 'got', 'thier', 'dad', 'boat', 'how', 'friends', 'put', 'day', 'go', 'shopping', 'regular', 'grocery', 'store', 'something', 'never', 'do', 'fans', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'wanting', 'autographs', 'really', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'neat', 'see', 'footage', 'mj', 'going', 'hospitals', 'as', 'well', 'caring', 'children.it', 'then', 'footage', 'martin', 'bashir', 'interview', 'was', 'captured', 'michael', 'own', 'camera', 'unedited', 'good', 'version', 'footage', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'watch', 'too.then', 'deposition', 'mj', 'answers', 'tons', 'questions', 'actually', 'wrote', 'girl', 'mine', 'are', 'world', 'stole', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'also', 'questioned', 'thriller', 'i', 'found', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'felt', 'sorry', 'too', 'lawyers', 'questioned', 'so', 'long', 'were', 'so', 'picky', 'phrasing', 'i', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'concert', 'night', 'was', 'hoarse', 'so', 'kept', 'having', 'drink', 'water', 'clear', 'throat', 'lot', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'hear', 'tell', 'how', 'actually', 'writing', 'songs', 'was', 'awesome', 'hear', 'give', 'examples', 'making', 'noises', 'seat', 'was', 'part', 'where', 'was', 'giving', 'example', 'how', 'part', 'song', 'head', 'sat', 'made', 'noises', 'song', 'who', 'amazing', 'i', 'am', 'glad', 'i', 'purchased', 'part', 'box', 'set', 'instead', 'worked', 'out', 'financially', 'better', 'do', 'so']",Michael Jackson - The Interviews Vol 2
