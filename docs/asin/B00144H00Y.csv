1145063,A10F5UNSBD55F4,B00144H00Y,Andr Richard,"[1, 4]","I did check the review before buying this DVD set and former buyers were speaking about the DVD content being compressed. For my part, I didn't see any differences when listeneing to the DVD and I am perfectly satisfied with it's quality. I used to watch this serie when it was originaly on air in the 80's and I enjoyed Stingray very much. Maybe beaucause of the mystery surronding the main character(played by Nick Mancuso) and maybe beacause of the beautiful ""Stingray"" corvette he is driving. Just like in some other show, the vehicule is a""star"" of the show even if it is just a material object. This is an action series of course but the way the scenario was written makes it a little different and fun to watch. When you see the main charachter disapear at the end of an episode, you always think that on the next show you will finally find out who he is and why he is doing all this but.....The DVD case is neat too, all the disc are individually stored in a little pouche are held in the case by a plastic frame. This makes it very easy to retreive the disc and this arrangement  turn the case  to be not too thick but the pouch are loose  within their frame som they might fell if you turn the case while it is open so be careful!Thank's to the company who made ""Stingray"" available on DVD, for me it's a great buy.Andr&eacute; Richard",5,Just like in the good old days,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1345,"['did', 'check', 'review', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'former', 'buyers', 'were', 'speaking', 'DVD', 'content', 'being', 'compressed', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'differences', 'when', 'listeneing', 'DVD', 'am', 'perfectly', 'satisfied', 'quality', 'used', 'watch', 'serie', 'when', 'was', 'originaly', 'air', '80', 'enjoyed', 'Stingray', 'very', 'much', 'Maybe', 'beaucause', 'mystery', 'surronding', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'maybe', 'beacause', 'beautiful', 'Stingray', 'corvette', 'driving', 'Just', 'other', 'show', 'vehicule', 'star', 'show', 'even', 'just', 'material', 'object', 'action', 'series', 'course', 'way', 'scenario', 'was', 'written', 'little', 'different', 'fun', 'watch', 'When', 'see', 'main', 'charachter', 'disapear', 'end', 'episode', 'always', 'think', 'next', 'show', 'will', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'why', 'doing', '..The', 'DVD', 'case', 'neat', 'too', 'disc', 'are', 'individually', 'stored', 'little', 'pouche', 'are', 'held', 'case', 'plastic', 'frame', 'very', 'easy', 'retreive', 'disc', 'arrangement', 'turn', 'case', 'be', 'not', 'too', 'thick', 'pouch', 'are', 'loose', 'frame', 'som', 'might', 'fell', 'turn', 'case', 'open', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'Thank', 'company', 'who', 'made', 'Stingray', 'available', 'DVD', 'great', 'buy.Andr', 'eacute', 'Richard']",Stingray: The Complete Series
1145064,A2Z7OM92A5I71O,B00144H00Y,Angelo,"[5, 6]","This is a great series that was treated very shoddily by the network.  According to ""Adventures in Prime Time:  The Television Programs of Stephen J. Cannell"" by Robert J. Thompson, NBC wanted a light, comedic show, and when Stephen J. Cannell delivered the Stingray pilot, a dark, moody mystery-adventure, the network passed on the series.  However, high ratings for the pilot meant that the network reluctantly ordered eight episodes, thus resulting in Season One of Stingray.  After that, the network tried cancelling the series again, but then needed filler for a dead-end timeslot, and ordered 15 more episodes at the last minute, resulting in Season 2.  Because of how NBC buried the show, it did not survive its third cancellation, and viewers lost out on one of the most innovative, clever, and stylish shows of the 80's.Nick Mancuso is mesmerizing as Stingray.  He manages to convey a haunted compassion that elevates the character above what could have been a stereotypical womanizing loner, and the glimpses of Stingray's past are fascinating.  Mancuso also does an amazing job at the many undercover guises Ray uses to crack the case (some favourites:  Italian hairdresser, Mexican field worker, surgeon, casting agent, Greek chemist, college student).  Mancuso's only weakness seems to be the fight sequences. Having a martial arts-trained hero was innovative at the time, but the use of stunt men instead of Mancuso was rather obvious. All in all, though, Ray was a complex and charismatic hero whose mysterious past would have remained intriguing for many seasons to come.The stories were also extremely clever.  The pilot and the first season, especially, were full of complex plots and deep characterization.  The relationship between Ray and the guest stars was given proper depth, and Ray was shown to make mistakes, and have to recover from them.  Season 2 was more uneven, mostly because the shows were ordered at the last minute.  Some of the stories were obviously rushed (The Neniwa, Blood Money), or did not even match the continuity about Ray's past from the first season (Gemini, The First Time is Forever).  But the second season also introduced humour, in such fantastic episodes as Autumn (a parody of film noir) , Caper (a parody of caper movies), and Cry Wolf (where a spoiled movie star drives Ray crazy).  It is a tribute to the versatility both of the premise and Mancuso himself that these espisodes can be so hilarious, and still not undermine the inherent dignity of Ray's purpose.  It is too bad that the network squashed this show before it could fulfill its promise.Another stylish signature of the show was the embedded ""music video"" in each episode, similar to Miami Vice.  However, the songs were written especially for the show, which sometimes backfired (bad 80's pop is just hideous), but sometimes worked amazingly well.  The songs that still stand up to this day are in ""Ether"", ""Below the Line"", ""Orange Blossom"", ""The Greeter"" (this one moves me to tears), ""Echoes"", and ""Autumn"".  Since I don't have copies of the original broadcasts, I was only made aware of soundtrack substitutions after reading some of the other reviews.  It's too bad, since music contributed greately to the moodiness of the show, but I guess I have to grateful that Stingray made it to DVD at all.It is truly a shame that this show didn't get the chance it deserved.  Even having only seen a few episodes just once when I was a teenager, Stingray made such an impression on me that I remembered it vividly 20 years later when this set was released.  I am happy to say that it is even better than I remember!

1145069,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00144H00Y,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","For my wife and I, this is one of our favorite TV series of all time. Stingray managed comedy, action, spy motifs, sci-fi, social relevance, romance, and just plain fun all at the same time. Nick Mancuso brought it off with a remarkable charm that sold the show.I have read recently that the series stopped because Mancuso could not see himself being tied down to a series any longer. Having read many times of Mancuso's quirky and independent slant regarding life and career, I had no trouble believing that to be true. However, its too bad. This was the role of a lifetime for any versatile actor, and looking back, I'll bet he realized that he could have stood a few more years of a quality role such as Ray, compared to some of the weak supporting roles he was stuck with in years thereafter. Like many actors, he probably eschewed the TV bird in the hand feeling that a long string of strong leading roles was within his grasp. And like many actors, he found that future to be ultimately elusive.The show's concepts of mercenary help for barter, and a supremely mysterious main character, were very different and highly enjoyable. Mancuso's ability to mold himself into many personas ... just as enjoyable. His southern accent? Not so good, but forgivable in view of the hours of entertainment he brought otherwise. LOLThis DVD set is far better than viewing your 20+ year old VHS tapes of the series, but it is not a top quality transfer. It is a Canadian product.

I was very apprehensive about the quality as they would have to use a great deal of compression to fit that much video on to 5 discs. But I was very pleased, as I checked each disc the quality is much better than I expected! Yes there is a small amount of artifacting but very little, they did a very good compression job for 5 eps. per disc.The color looks good and accurate, the print or source material is totally clean and the picture is nice and sharp and clear.The sound is in true stereo!!!  Has most of the original music is intact -All the songs are the original up till the last 2 episodes of season one, from then on, most original songs (NOT the theme or background effect music they are all original and intact) were replaced with new dubbed material , they did in my opinion a good job, and it seemed to fit nicely with the episodes - they might have had licensing problems - which might have delayed the series from being releasedThe only problem I have encountered is there are some problems with motion. It has a look of a PAL disc converted to NTSC - the motion at times seem unnatural and not fluid - this may be a result of the rendering or capturing process that was not done correctly.When you load each disc there is a disclaimer That anomalies may be present due to source material.I wouldn't be too concerned about the motion problem, it is slight and you notice it mostly when the camera is panning a moving shot, or when people are walking in the scene.If you liked the show you will not be disappointed with the set and it is a very good quality product.Yes it could have been slightly better, but it could have been much, much worse.

It was quite a thing for me to adjust to episodes being so clear because the five shows I recorded when the show first came out had awful reception.I didn't know what so-called anomalies there were that each disk warned about because I saw none of it, and the only jerky motion I saw was when my computer went on its scans. When I halted them, all jerkiness of motion stopped.I can't understand why those who contacted Ray were so concerned about who he really was, what was his real name, why he did favors for payment, when he'll be back to collect his favor. Who cares! If you tell me your name is the Pillsbury Dough Boy why bother question it? Beats being called ""Hey You"". Who cares why he collects favors instead of money. It's so much cheaper. Who cares what his background is that made him who he is. He accepts my case, that's all that should matter. Why some of the characters seemed relieved that their favors weren't the horror they thought they'd be is mind boggling. Ray should've been trusted a little more since he helped them out of jams.I loved the writing in all but two episodes. The episode with Jeff Conaway from Taxi playing a self-absorbed actor who was such a jerk running from people trying to kill him, and the episode with the woman writer and her whining sister slowly poisoning her, listening to the horrible writing of that so-called writer typing her schlocky writing and using it as a voice over, was a bitter reminder that sometimes show writers will resort to crap when they have no good ideas because it seems better than no idea at all.Despite my complaints, I still love my Stingray CD's. I've had no problem with jerkiness of motion unless my scans come on. I got the CD's  in excellent condition and a day earlier than promised.  I love the graphics as soon as a CD is popped in with moving shots of episodes while the theme song that I can never get enough of, plays. I like that you can play a disk's episodes singly or all at once if you want to make a marathon of it. I like the liner notes about Ray's character, and of course, I like Nick Mancuso's pictures.Ray you'll always be my favorite! Now for the favor I've been waiting to collect on  for years.

For Barter Only.""Ray would tackle anything from suspicious death to drug-running to blackmail and his price was always simply ; ""a favor"", which could be any thing, any time, and would be asked in order to help Ray help someone else later on (a gimmick, incidentally, that resurfaced years later on The Equalizer and Vengeance Unlimited) A nice continuity touch was that previous clients did in fact, resurface during the series as Ray would call upon them to help others. Ray was computer savvy at a time well before the proliferation of personal computers, and kept his Stingray Client List, complete with occupations and locations of past clients on a PC which he consulted from time-to-time.One of many nice touches was that whenever anyone attempted to run Ray's fingerprints, the match would come back either as someone he clearly was not, or as ""Classified"" by the D.O.D. When his car license plate was run, it would come back as registered to the White House Motor Pool or  to the Governor of the State. The man was A CYPHER from start to finish of each episode, with only a few glimpses into his past and his life as the series progressed.Ray was an extremely competent investigator, adopting disguises that went beyond simple make-up. He could assume a complete personna instantly, complete with appropriate dialect, accent and mannerisms  whether he was posing as an effete European hair stylist or a poor, illiterate laborer. Ray was highly skilled in several martial arts and multiple weapons use.Although he never called himself ""Stingray"", the name `Ray` was apparently derived from his car, a classic black 1965 Corvette Stingray. Ray tended to favor black in his wardrobe as well.The short-lived series had smooth class and a cinematic style. A marvelous job was done matching background theme music with the action.  Nick Mancuso made a slick action/adventure hero and the plots were gripping -- if at times a bit far-fetched. The show ran for 25 episodes, and to the best of my knowledge, would have continued had Mancuso not become a ""problem"" for the production company -- supposedly because he couldn't hack the pressure of a weekly series. Too bad.Overall, an excellent series, ahead of it`s time, which still stands up as some great entertainment.Can`t wait for the dvds !",5,STINGRAY...STARRING NICK MANCUSO,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,2803,"['obviously', 'can', 'not', 'review', 'actual', 'DVD', 'set', 'yet', 'date', 'delayed', 'later', '2008', '.But', 'series', 'PR', 'Someday', ""'ll"", 'see', 'again', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'favor', 'whatever', 'must', 'do', 'Ray', 'stated', 'terms', 'assistance.STINGRAY', 'portrayed', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'was', 'former', 'American', 'Intelligence', 'Operative', 'who', 'chose', 'become', 'enigmatic', 'loner', 'helping', 'ordinary', 'people', 'problems', 'when', 'contacted', 'newspaper', 'ad', 'Stingray', 'Barter', 'Only', 'Ray', 'would', 'tackle', 'anything', 'suspicious', 'death', 'drug-running', 'blackmail', 'price', 'was', 'always', 'simply', 'favor', 'could', 'be', 'thing', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'order', 'help', 'Ray', 'help', 'someone', 'else', 'later', 'gimmick', 'incidentally', 'resurfaced', 'years', 'later', 'Equalizer', 'Vengeance', 'Unlimited', 'A', 'nice', 'continuity', 'touch', 'was', 'previous', 'clients', 'did', 'fact', 'resurface', 'series', 'Ray', 'would', 'call', 'help', 'others', 'Ray', 'was', 'computer', 'savvy', 'time', 'well', 'proliferation', 'personal', 'computers', 'kept', 'Stingray', 'Client', 'List', 'complete', 'occupations', 'locations', 'past', 'clients', 'PC', 'consulted', 'time-to-time.One', 'many', 'nice', 'touches', 'was', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'attempted', 'run', 'Ray', 'fingerprints', 'match', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'someone', 'clearly', 'was', 'not', 'Classified', 'D.O.D', 'When', 'car', 'license', 'plate', 'was', 'run', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'registered', 'White', 'House', 'Motor', 'Pool', 'Governor', 'State', 'man', 'was', 'CYPHER', 'start', 'finish', 'episode', 'only', 'few', 'glimpses', 'past', 'life', 'series', 'progressed.Ray', 'was', 'extremely', 'competent', 'investigator', 'adopting', 'disguises', 'went', 'simple', 'make-up', 'could', 'assume', 'complete', 'personna', 'instantly', 'complete', 'appropriate', 'dialect', 'accent', 'mannerisms', 'was', 'posing', 'effete', 'European', 'hair', 'stylist', 'poor', 'illiterate', 'laborer', 'Ray', 'was', 'highly', 'skilled', 'several', 'martial', 'arts', 'multiple', 'weapons', 'never', 'called', 'Stingray', 'name', 'Ray', 'was', 'apparently', 'derived', 'car', 'classic', 'black', '1965', 'Corvette', 'Stingray', 'Ray', 'tended', 'favor', 'black', 'wardrobe', 'well.The', 'short-lived', 'series', 'had', 'smooth', 'class', 'cinematic', 'style', 'marvelous', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'matching', 'background', 'theme', 'music', 'action', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'made', 'slick', 'action/adventure', 'hero', 'plots', 'were', 'gripping', 'times', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'show', 'ran', '25', 'episodes', 'best', 'knowledge', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'had', 'Mancuso', 'not', 'become', 'problem', 'production', 'company', 'supposedly', 'could', ""n't"", 'hack', 'pressure', 'weekly', 'series', 'Too', 'bad.Overall', 'excellent', 'series', 'ahead', 's', 'time', 'still', 'up', 'great', 'entertainment.Can', 't', 'wait', 'dvds']",Stingray: The Complete Series

I always liked the resourcefulness of the main character and wondered if anyone could live off out of favors... and yet be able to help others in need. The DVD set is poor packed and I guess it is so to cope with the low pricing of the set. I don't mind, I just didn't like that the pilot is somewhat a shorter version than the one I remember seeing decades ago.I will leave the technical details to the other reviewers, which pretty much covers it all.This series is really good although it was short lived and I think it was a pity. Of all the episodes, *Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues* is my favorite. A bittersweet story with great acting and an outstanding theme song. It is a very sad story about personal sacrifices you are asked to make in life for the greater good of others or the one who cares most to you - ""That's Life. And sometimes you've gotta sing the blues""; and the theme song fits in it marvelously and it goes more or less like this (don't recall the exact lyrics):""You've been waiting a life time \ even but a lucky break \ hanging on to a lifeline \ that's where you made your first mistake \ Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues \ a little looney goes a long long way \ ... \ Sometimes there's nothing but the blues \ when you got nothing there to loose \ Oh you've gotta sing the blues...""A few years ago, I contacted the singer of the song to ask if she ever recorded that song and she said no; that that song was recorded only for that particular episode. *A very cool song* as she stated. I wish she had recorded it and I would get it...A must see series that I highly recommend.

I'm not sure why it's on all the discs because other than the pilot episode the quality in my opinion is excellent. You can play the episodes individually or use the play all feature. The video transfers are crisp and clean and the colors are vibrant and sharp. The audio is really good and the opening theme song from Mike Post and the 80's style soundtrack is awesome. The five single sided discs come in a clear standard DVD case with great artwork and detail. The set is well done and Vei should be commended for their efforts.From series creator Stephen J. Cannell comes one of my favorite television shows of all time ""Stingray"". This series had it all in my opinion and it got cancelled way too soon. Former intelligence specialist ""Stingray"" or Ray as he's called is in the business of helping people out of sticky situations. Ray drives a 1965 Corvette Stingray, he is highly skilled in weapons combat and hand to hand combat and as a former intelligence specialist he can hack into any computer database. The only way to contact him is through a classified add in the newspaper and clients must agree to his terms or he won't meet them. Ray is a specialist and the best at what he does and he can assume the persona of anyone at anytime and make it all seem believable. Ray provides a service to those in need and when the job is done he tells them that they simply owe him a favor.

Sounds trivial, I know, but when Ray walks into the diner to find everybody dead, coffee still hot, jukebox playing Gale Garnett's We'll Sing In The Sunshine, it was eerie as heck! They've put some random (my guess is made-up) song on instead.  I know I'm not remembering it incorrectly because I checked on the VIDEO I'd made from the television. It takes away from an important scene and seems like a lame thing to do. Does anyone have any idea why they'd do this? I'm curious.
