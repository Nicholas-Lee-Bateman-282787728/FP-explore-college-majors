As I watched it, i couldn't decide if Karl Pilkington is kind of stupid, if he's very intolerant, or just an amiable fool.  But he sure is funny!  Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant think of evil tortures for this poor guy.  They book horrible hotels for him, introduce him to strange people and set him up with crazy adventures, e.g. 8 hour camel rides across the desert.  It was just great fun.

Karl believes that it is a show with a title like Karl Pilkington visits the Seven Wonders of the World, or some such title, however what he really becomes a part of is ""An Idiot Abroad"".  Sounds grand doesn't it?  Travel to fantastic sights across the globe....well, not quite, as you see Ricky and Stephen plan excursions for him like bull riding, wrestling, camel riding and anti terrorist training.... They are intent on making his experience as far out of his comfort zone as humanly possible.  How about a lovely 8 hour camel ride across the desert?  Or maybe a lovely dinner of toad or bull testicles and other parts for dinner?  Karl does not have top notch fancy quarters, and he has a face that truly expresses every thought he is thinking....much of which is the ""wtf""? look.....In every stop he is forced to get out of his comfort zone and learn about his surroundings.  He is a good sport, dressing in local dress, taking on local customs and trying some of the new foods that come his way, but honestly, in the China episode, having a bag of chips would have probably been where I would have started too.The photography of the series is wonderful and Karl is a bit naive and wide-eyed, so it is priceless watching him make his way through the adventures and then the calls from the office checking to see how he is doing, while they send him on yet another crackpot adventure before he actually goes to see the next wonder.Laugh out loud funny!

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 13]","Note: This particular Blu-Ray is NOT designed for most United States players.Fans of Ricky Gervais will undoubtedly be familiar with daft and mercilessly funny Karl Pilkington.  Gervais and partner Stephen Merchant have transformed Pilkington into an international superstar in previous programming--most notoriously, he is the undisputed star of their podcasts which have also been turned into ""The Ricky Gervais Show"" for HBO.  Pilkington has a precious and skewed world view which combines faulty logic with unsubstantiated facts, yet for all its absurdity--there is often a nugget of wisdom in Pilkington's ramblings.  An endless source of mockery and taunts from his co-workers, you might be inclined to feel sorry for the maligned Pilkington if he weren't so darn funny.  A certified homebody, never having traveled further than Wales, Gervais and Merchant designed a new and inspired way to torture their little buddy.  Why not send him around the world, ostensibly to view the Seven Wonders, and put him into situations that he will absolutely hate?  Thus, ""An Idiot Abroad"" was conceived.I must admit, the cruelty in the idea is apparent from the start--Gervais even relishes in it.  But Pilkington is a willing stooge, and off he goes.  Expected fish out of water hilarity ensues, but don't be surprised if Pilkington is up for the challenge.  There is very little that he refuses to do--and in those instances where he puts his foot down, I am in full agreement.  There are moments that remain fresh and absolutely memorable--cave dwelling in Jordan, a visit with cannibals along the Amazon, avoiding the dangers of a street festival in Mexico, an unexpected spiritual dip in an Indian river.  Pilkington, always reluctant if not outright resistant, generally embraces the tasks he's given with a more open mind than I felt possible.  If anything fails to impress the stalwart traveler, it's usually the attractions themselves.After a brief introductory preview (which I scanned through--I like to be surprised), there are eight full length episodes.  Each episode consists of one manmade wonder and its corresponding country (Brazil, Mexico, India, Jordan, Egypt, Peru, and China) with a wrap-up session that includes extra footage and a debrief.  A travelogue and a comedy, ""An Idiot Abroad"" is an easy recommendation for preexisting fans of this renegade band.  More subdued and serious than I thought it would be--don't fret, there is still no repressing the wonders of Pilkington's mind!  And there is no denying that the wisdom and insight of our reluctant hero can be laugh out loud funny.  If this sounds at all appealing, give it a shot--you might be a bit surprised to realize that we all have a bit of Karl within us!

X-DWithout trying, completely spontaneous and genuinely insightful - our man Karl Pilkington is hands down the funniest guy living on Planet Earth today.Certainly there have been moments - in my own life and those that come from the entertainment field - that have had me in tears, crying so hard from laughing. The first time I saw the lateSam Kinison, the moment when a friend ate his entire meal then discovered a fat cockroach at the bottom of his bowl, the combat/spear and hippo birth scenes in 'Ace Ventura, When Nature Calls'. Moments that I'll carry with me the rest of my life.But this guy Karl - this guy is beyond humorous. He's like the Dalai Lama of comedy, delivering the rawest, most truthful, insanely funny things ever uttered by man.He's added to my moments of hilarity by a hundred fold.And to be fair, everyone who 'gets' this show, owes a debt to Ricky Gervais. Despite the fact that he's a self-absorbed, cruel, arrogant smartass, the bottom line is: Without his efforts there would be no one outside of England who would understand, could possibly understand, the phenomenon of Karl Pilkington.There is NO WAY any single post or review can adequately capture the essence of Karl - the purest laughs he creates. No way.So I'll say this: Watch, listen and be in awe.I only wish there were a 17-star rating on Amazon.UPDATE 6.1.11: Fans may or may not have heard that, despite years of protests and absolute refusals (remember his famous ""nip it in the bud"" scene in Peru), Karl has agreed to a second season of 'An Idiot'. Tentatively called ""The Bucket List"", it's filming as I write this. And if you want to get an INSANELY HILARIOUS preview - check out the podcast found via several different download services. There's no video, but Ricky plays a recorded phone message of our guy stuck in Alaska! I won't say anymore. Check it out and I promise - you'll end up crying it's so funny.

Yes, in my 20's I loved world travel and adventures, but now that I've done them, backpack and thumb out on the road and all that, I'm very, very, very happy and content to watch films like this that show the confusion, depression, discomfort and loneliness of foreign travel.  Miserable hotel rooms, disgusting toilets, food one can't eat, strange harassing foreigners, weird blank faces (the Chinese), bad smells and air pollution and heat and dust:  yes, this is real travel.  Get to know the Egyptians, get up and dance with that bellydancer on the Nile Cruise by night - so that the Egyptians can have a laugh at the goofball white guy trying to boogie!  Listen to cars honking all night, ride a camel through the slums, do it all so that you can have something to think about for years to come - not to mention, laugh about, write about and tell about to those willing to listen.Karl Pilkington is married, has a wife and home, seems content in a fuddy-duddy, nonambitious, toodle-around-the-toolshed way.  He seems to be the perfect husband, who will never roam, always be handy (mending a fuse!), happy to have his dinner (chicken and chips), a beer, and not even have too much of a social life with excess drinking.  Reliable, dull, unobtrusive, inconsequential - a typical old-fashioned English working man of the most sought-after sort by women of sense:  yes, this is the man least likely to give a hoot about the Seven Wonders of the World, and for this reason he is the one sent to go looking at them, followed by a film crew and occasional translator.  He gets a paycheck out of it, and we get a great laugh.Don't forget, if you watch this series, you can avoid wasting your own time and money and aggravation on your own trip, simply by seeing the scenery, the natives, the food and the transport, and then skipping the real thing.  I have to admit that it's ""real travel"" films like this that provide my pea-sized brain with fake adventures and, at the same time, true images of life abroad.  Then, when I do meet natives of those countries, which I have to do daily as a tourguide in San Francisco, I can make up all kinds of nonsense and actually fool the denizens of India into thinking that I have seen their country and that I LIKED their country.Of course, I have never been there, but that's okay, with films like these as aids!  And will I see the tourists again? No!  But they're happy and so am I!  WE have a wonderful time!

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","AN IDIOT ABROAD is a travelogue like none you have ever seen before.Created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, this hilarious television series from BBC Video centers on their friend, Karl Pilkington, a rather laid-back guy who does not enjoy venturing out of his own limited comfort zone.Ricky and Stephen send Karl on a journey to visit the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but what they don't tell him is that, as he visits countries like China, India, Jordan, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Peru, they will also be sending him on some side trips that the average tourist would never even consider taking.In China, for example, this poor guy from Wales is assigned to walk the entire Great Wall, while in South America, he treks into the jungle where he meets a native tribe that could, possibly, be cannibals.  Karl's imagination does run overtime.Yet, none of this is really as bad as some of the things he is forced to eat during his travels, everything from bugs to toads to testicles.Gervais says that, with this series, he has played ""the most expensive practical joke"" in his life.  Certainly Pilkington's reactions to the often less than civilized worlds that he encounters are laugh-out-loud funny.For the most part, Gervais and Merchant just appear in the opening segment of each of the eight one-hour episodes (on 2-discs), leaving Pilkington to garner the vast majority of the guffaws.
