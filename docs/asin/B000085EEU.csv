733985,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,B000085EEU,A Customer,"[1, 6]","I believe that this movie was definitly thought up by a extremely creative inividual. This movie is really great if you are used to the plot line jumping every which way. Flash backs and fast forwards all add to this complicated and somewhat boring movie. Sorry if you enjoyed it but I really like to not be happy when the movie ends and to be honest I grew really restless and annoyed with this story line.It all begins with an innocent girl next door, Katie Burke, starting her final year at university. She is plunged into chaos when a detective begins to look for her asstranged boyfriend Embry Larkin. Embry had been gone and believed dead but now Katie swears he's back. He tortures her mentaly until they meet face to face, curtosy of a note left by Embry. They talk but it ultimately it ends up that Kaite is led to keep seeing him because she is still in love with him.By now Katie has already created a relationship with the charming and handsome detctive, who is a ex-alcoholic (this adds nothing to the movies plot and I don't even know how it would be coherent in this scenerio). The two engage in the relationship however it is very focused around Embry and his actions towards Katie. So as the story develops as they become ""closer"" to catching Embry when Katie is attacked by him and of course the protective boyfriend follows after.Now this is where it becomes confusing because through Katies screams at nothing the detective finally discovers that Katie has a problem and it isn't with Embry Larkin. He says the dreaded 5 words: ""You can't come with me."" and Katie is pushed over the edge killing the detective as she did her boyfriend (which you find out through a flash back). So yes this girl is a skitsofrenic murderer and the reason for which it was never found out was because at those times no one was looking for them or needed to for that matter. To top it off, the building in which they were killed is purposely collapsed for rebuilding purposes within the week so no worries.Now there are many more things that occur during the movie that make it all the more suspenceful and unexpected however by breaking it down I'm just not sure I can appreciate this film for all it is worth.",3,My senses ABANDONED me when I decided to see this movie.,1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,2211,"['believe', 'movie', 'was', 'definitly', 'thought', 'up', 'extremely', 'creative', 'inividual', 'movie', 'really', 'great', 'are', 'used', 'plot', 'line', 'jumping', 'way', 'Flash', 'backs', 'fast', 'forwards', 'add', 'complicated', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'movie', 'Sorry', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'grew', 'really', 'restless', 'annoyed', 'story', 'begins', 'innocent', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Katie', 'Burke', 'starting', 'final', 'year', 'university', 'plunged', 'chaos', 'when', 'detective', 'look', 'asstranged', 'boyfriend', 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'Embry', 'had', 'been', 'gone', 'believed', 'dead', 'now', 'Katie', 'back', 'mentaly', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'curtosy', 'note', 'left', 'Embry', 'talk', 'ultimately', 'up', 'Kaite', 'led', 'keep', 'seeing', 'still', 'love', 'him.By', 'now', 'Katie', 'already', 'created', 'relationship', 'charming', 'handsome', 'detctive', 'who', 'ex-alcoholic', 'nothing', 'movies', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'coherent', 'scenerio', 'two', 'engage', 'relationship', 'however', 'very', 'focused', 'Embry', 'actions', 'towards', 'Katie', 'So', 'story', 'become', 'closer', 'catching', 'Embry', 'when', 'Katie', 'attacked', 'course', 'protective', 'boyfriend', 'after.Now', 'where', 'confusing', 'Katies', 'screams', 'nothing', 'detective', 'finally', 'Katie', 'problem', ""n't"", 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'dreaded', '5', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'Katie', 'pushed', 'edge', 'killing', 'detective', 'did', 'boyfriend', 'find', 'out', 'flash', 'back', 'So', 'yes', 'girl', 'skitsofrenic', 'murderer', 'reason', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'because', 'times', 'one', 'was', 'looking', 'needed', 'matter', 'top', 'off', 'building', 'were', 'killed', 'purposely', 'collapsed', 'rebuilding', 'purposes', 'week', 'so', 'no', 'worries.Now', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'things', 'occur', 'movie', 'make', 'more', 'suspenceful', 'unexpected', 'however', 'breaking', 'down', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'worth']",N/A
733986,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B000085EEU,A Customer,"[2, 4]","Summary:Katie Burke (Katie Holmes) is a star student at a prestigious Ivy League university. She is supported by well-deserved scholarships and seems to be able to pick and choose whom she will date. However, when she was a young undergraduate student she wasn't quite as well known and felt somewhat lucky to be noticed by and eventually dating Embry Larkin (Charlie Hunnam), who happens to be the most popular and controversial guy on campus.Most of the information we have on their relationship comes out as backstory flashbacks. The current story is actually the meeting of Katie with Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt), a police officer who has been assigned to find Embry who disappeared several years previously.When Wade begins questioning Katie two things happen: (1) She begins seeing Embry again and he seems to be stalking her, and (2) She falls in love with Wade.But what we don't realize is that Katie's claim that Embry disappeared and she doesn't know where he is is actually a result of her having repressed the fact that she killed him when he tried to leave her. As it turns out, she does the same thing to Wade and the movie ends by setting her up to do it again. Apparently Katie, though intelligent and attractive, has a hard time being 'abandoned', thus the name of the film.My Comments:The story was kind of interesting, but not particularly convincing. The first problem is that the title which is supposedly the motivation of the killings, Katie's sense of abandonment, is very poorly developed. Supposedly it stems from her father leaving her at a young age, but this is only very briefly mentioned despite employing a psychiatrist to delve into her past. I ended up thinking it all rather silly.The other problem I had with the story is that it tried to incorporate several red herrings and other characters that never really ended up being developed satisfactorily.  Also, none of the characters were really convincing, but I'll get into that below.As for the acting, I had a major problem here.  First, though I'm not really blaming Charlie Hunnam for his portrayal of Embry Larkin, I thought the character was ridiculously portrayed and a horrible stereotype.  He tried so hard to be an artistic romantic that it came across as being pathetically cheesy.  Every time he came on the screen I wanted to scream, &quot;Please don't pretend to be some radical artist; just be yourself.&quot;  Of course it didn't work and by the end of the movie I was sick of seeing him.Katie Holmes and Benjamin Bratt weren't too bad.  But as noted above, the characters they were given to portray were too complex to be satisfactorily developed during the course of the movie.  Holmes has too many problems and too many relationships to work through them all and Bratt's combination of alcoholism and bringing his work/witnesses home to sleep with them just didn't work.  They tried pretty hard, but just by their nature they left me with an unsatisfied feeling.Overall, the movie had potential but seemed to try too hard to be artistic and it was fairly apparent that this was a first film for the director, straight out of film school.  It did make me want to see what was going to happen next, but when I found out, I wasn't very satisfied.",2,"Okay, but not memorable",1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,3250,"['Summary', 'Katie', 'Burke', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'star', 'student', 'prestigious', 'Ivy', 'League', 'university', 'supported', 'well-deserved', 'scholarships', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'choose', 'whom', 'will', 'date', 'However', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'lucky', 'be', 'noticed', 'eventually', 'dating', 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'who', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'controversial', 'guy', 'campus.Most', 'information', 'have', 'relationship', 'out', 'backstory', 'flashbacks', 'current', 'story', 'actually', 'meeting', 'Katie', 'Wade', 'Handler', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'find', 'Embry', 'who', 'disappeared', 'several', 'years', 'previously.When', 'Wade', 'begins', 'questioning', 'Katie', 'two', 'things', 'happen', '1', 'seeing', 'Embry', 'again', 'be', 'stalking', '2', 'love', 'Wade.But', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Katie', 'claim', 'Embry', 'disappeared', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'actually', 'result', 'having', 'repressed', 'fact', 'killed', 'when', 'tried', 'leave', 'out', 'same', 'thing', 'Wade', 'movie', 'setting', 'up', 'do', 'again', 'Apparently', 'Katie', 'intelligent', 'attractive', 'hard', 'time', 'being', ""'abandoned"", 'thus', 'name', 'film.My', 'Comments', 'story', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'not', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'first', 'problem', 'title', 'supposedly', 'motivation', 'killings', 'Katie', 'sense', 'abandonment', 'very', 'poorly', 'developed', 'Supposedly', 'father', 'leaving', 'young', 'age', 'only', 'very', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'employing', 'psychiatrist', 'delve', 'past', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', 'rather', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'story', 'tried', 'incorporate', 'several', 'red', 'herrings', 'other', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'developed', 'satisfactorily', 'Also', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'convincing', ""'ll"", 'get', 'below.As', 'acting', 'had', 'major', 'problem', 'here', 'First', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'blaming', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'portrayal', 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'portrayed', 'horrible', 'stereotype', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'artistic', 'romantic', 'came', 'being', 'pathetically', 'cheesy', 'time', 'came', 'screen', 'wanted', 'scream', 'quot', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'radical', 'artist', 'just', 'be', 'yourself.', 'quot', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'sick', 'seeing', 'him.Katie', 'Holmes', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'noted', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'portray', 'were', 'too', 'complex', 'be', 'satisfactorily', 'developed', 'course', 'movie', 'Holmes', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'too', 'many', 'relationships', 'work', 'Bratt', 'combination', 'alcoholism', 'bringing', 'work/witnesses', 'home', 'sleep', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'tried', 'pretty', 'hard', 'just', 'nature', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'feeling.Overall', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'seemed', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'artistic', 'was', 'fairly', 'apparent', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'straight', 'film', 'school', 'did', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'when', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfied']",N/A

This was the directorial debut of writer Stephen Gahagan, who won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for ""Traffic,"" and it is a psychological thriller about a college student under a lot of stress (Katie Holmes), and the disappearance of her ex-boyfriend (Charlie Hunnam) being investigated by a cop (Benjamin Bratt). There are numerous flashbacks that blend into the present and start to get a little jumbled, and Bratt tries to figure out who is who and what is real or imagined, as he finds himself falling in love with Holmes.Clint Mansell's score tries to heighten the tension with some eerie/spooky sounds, but instead the music becomes repetitious and annoying, and the end result of this film is that the intentions by all were good, but none of the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole.Benjamin Bratt is a magnificent specimen of the human species, and Katie Holmes has a lithe grace and an appealing vulnerability that make these two fine actors a pleasure to watch, and one hopes they both have a future full of great scripts and success.If it is on the small screen, Bratt and Holmes make this film well worth watching, but it is too contrived (and in many instances silly) a plot, even for a rental.Others in the cast include Zooey Deschanel as Samantha, Fred Ward as Lt. Stayton, Melanie Lynskey as Julie, and Gabriel Mann as Harrison.

But, I did want to see the movie anyhow, because I'm a fan of Katie Holmes. So now after watching this movie I find that it was actually enjoyable, and I can't understand why the public has decided to bash it the way they have.""Abandon"" tells the story of a young college student Embry Larkin (Charlie Hunnam) who has mysterious disappeared for the past two years. This brings forth a detective Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt). Who is now questioning all the students to find out anything he can on Embry including Katie Burke (Katie Holmes) who we find out was dating Embry. And then a lot of weird things happen. Suddenly Embry returns and starts stalking Katie! And then a friend of Katie's, Harrison (Gabriel Mann) disappears too! Is there a connection? Well, I'm not going to say.I liked ""Abandon"" because it seemed to take it's time a tell a story. It tried to create characters that would make it enjoyable for us to watch 90 minutes. The movie had some depth to it, and I like it when movies do. The acting by the cast is wonderful, and I suppose it's Holmes and Bratt who steal the movie but credit has to be given to Stephen Gaghan as well. While I admit the film rarely hits a suspenseful moment, there is a certain style to Gaghan's directing. The movie in a way is sort of a character study-ish movie that examines it's two lead characters. And I'm also pretty sure most will see the ending coming. I myself predicted 50% of it. I wasn't exactly sure. Would I tell someone to see this movie? Yes. I don't feel it's  bad movie, the way some people would have you believe. Do I think everyone will like it? Well, I think that answer is obvious. No, everyone will not like this movie. And I'm not exactly sure what the target audience is for this movie. You might guess teens because of Holmes, but, that's not to say someone over that target audience wouldn't enjoy the movie.Bottom-line: An entertaining first effort by Stephen Gaghan.

Katie Holmes is the missing guy's girlfriend! And a guy who looks a lot like the Naked Chef is the missing guy himself! Is he dead? Or did he just leave for unknown reasons?Who cares? From the writer who brought us award-winning &quot;Traffic&quot; comes this flop of a film that is neither suspenseful nor very interesting. My very first question at the beginning of the film was, why are the cops just getting around to investigating this kid's disappearance? I mean, two years is an awful long time not to look for someone. This question was never really answered, but I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is the fact that I wasted money on the rental, and an hour and a half of my time. Katie Holmes is a good actress, don't get me wrong, but she can rarely find a decent movie role (the few exceptions are &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot;). This movie here proves it. She plays Katie, a hard-working college student who seems to attract guys like flies. A couple of years ago she attracted Embry, a really talented guy, but kinda jerky. Then one day he goes missing, and no one really knows why. Enter Benjamin Bratt as the detective in search of answers. He and Katie get pretty close during his investigation, especially after Katie tells him that Embry is back in town and is stalking her. Hmm. Sounds exciting, right? Well, not really. The film ends with a twist - one that would have been really good had I not figured it out half-way through the movie.The DVD is not that much better than the film itself. It's got a couple of deleted scenes with director commentary, but they are nothing special. If you watch the trailer for the film, you'll notice a lot of clips are nowhere in the film, or in the deleted scenes. You will also notice, as I did when I first saw this trailer months ago in the theater, that the trailer practically gives everything away. So all in all, this DVD is not that great a deal. One of the few things that I somewhat liked about the film was Zooey Deschanel, who played one of Katie's friends. I adored her in &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, and she is the only interesting one in the whole film - and she's barely in it at all.

733990,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000085EEU,Andrew Ellington,"[16, 16]","I remember when I went and saw this for the first time and everyone I was with thought it was terrible.  I remember being in shock because I thought it was quite good.  Granted, at the time of its release I was in love with Katie Holmes and thought she could do no wrong.  Now, years later I decided to watch this again to see if it holds up now that my fascination with Holmes has diminished due to her insanely strange new outlook on life.  Well, it does.  I don't know what to say to all these people who find this film horrendous.  I actually really like it.  It works, it's solid and it impresses me to this day.  Sure, it's not perfect, but it's so much better than many make it out to be.The film revolves around Katie Burke, a young college student who is haunted by the memory of her ex-boyfriend Embry.  Embry has been out of her life for two years now, just up and disappearing, but suddenly he seems to be returning.  This begins to take its toll on Katie when Wade, a police detective battling his own demons, begins investigating Embry's disappearance.  Katie is struggling to complete her thesis and land a good job but the sudden reappearance of Embry is throwing a wrench in everything.  As her relationship with Wade begins to flourish her own demons come to the surface and soon we realize that Katie is not who we think she is and that Embry's reappearance may have more meaning than we could ever imagine.`Abandon' plays out like a B-movie, but a very good one at that.  It's not as polished as most Hollywood fare; it's gritty and dark, and I think this does the film a huge service (thought I was gonna say `disservice' didn't you).  `Abandon' is at moments chilling and this is thanks in large part to Holmes performance.  Katie has always had potential but it wasn't until just before she went cuckoo for Tom Cruise that she actually began to tap into it.  Her performances in this film as well as 2003's `Pieces of April' are among her finest to date.  It's a shame she has thrown it all away.The rest of the cast does a fine job as well.  Benjamin Bratt does his best to stand out but doesn't fare so well.  His scenes are smothered with Katie's commanding presence.  Zooey Daschanel is funny and witty as Katie's friend Samantha and the beautiful Gabriel Union delivers as Amanda (although I really wish she had more screen time).

E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Abandon is supposed to be about a college student (the character of Katie Holmes) whose boyfriend goes missing, and a detective goes around searching for clues concerning his whereabouts. It fails. It fails miserably in fact.Where do I start? Alright, in my experience with movies starring Katie Holmes, the storyline seems to take a back seat so we can focus on Katie Holmes and how she reacts to everything taking place around her (and of course, place MAJOR emphasis on how attractive she is). That's a problem for movie lovers expecting to witness a compelling storyline, because it means viewers can't get attached to the suspense factor of the storyline at *all*. It's impossible to get attached to a movie that doesn't even care about suspense, in fact.What makes it an even BIGGER problem is that Katie Holmes usually shows very little emotion anyway, and Abandon is no exception. So what point were the writers trying to make by focusing on the character of Katie Holmes but ignoring the actual plot development?Besides the noticeable problems with Katie Holmes, we have the disturbing matter of the detective I'd like to bring to your attention. He's *terrible*. He's not even remotely believable, and in fact, throughout the movie he basically acted like another college student the way he'd constantly downplay the situation involving a missing student.  He even felt an attachment to Katie Holmes as the story rolled along.  Ugh, it was really pathetic.Like I said above, the suspense is about as unspectacular as you can possibly imaginable. No interesting storyline, no atmosphere, and no reason to even watch Abandon unless you really really believe Katie Holmes *alone* makes a movie.

It's not a bad movie; there are some excellent twists and turns, the performances are quite good, and the Hitchcock-like climax is riveting. Everything we took for granted is revealed to be sinisterly twisted. But it still doesn't erode the fact that all of the characters are immoral. Does the movie glorify casual sex and ""high living"" or condemn it? It seems to be up to the viewer to decide.The movie opens in a prestigious college with young Katie Burke (Holmes), an intelligent student going through mental duress. With end of the year exams looming, the pressure of finding a job, and dealing with her final term paper, Katie is uncertain of where her life will lead from this point on. Her best friend Samantha encourages her to loosen up... but Katie hasn't been happy since Embry Larkin (Hunnam), her former boyfriend disappeared. Things only grow worse when Wade Handler (Bratt), a cop and recovering alcoholic, starts asking questions about Embry. The handsome young man was eccentric, wealthy, and talented. He's been missing for two years and the bureau wants closure. As Wade starts digging around in the past, he comes across a photo linking Embry with Katie, but she's reluctant to answer questions. One night, totally wasted with her friends after a Rave, Katie sees Embry's reflection in the window. At first she believes it's merely a hallucination... but then she sees him again... and again... and again. Tantalizing glimpses of the man she fell in love with. In the corridor. Peering through a shelf at her in the gloomy college library. Walking around on campus.Then the note comes, calling her to their old haunt -- the soon-to-be-demolished mansion just off campus grounds. Embry has been abroad, living off what money he can make freelancing, ""experiencing life."" But his love for Katie has drawn him back to campus. Katie refuses to reinstate their romantic relationship. In the meantime she's having to deal with her upcoming job interview, personal counseling from an overly-interested therapist, strained friendships, finishing her thesis, and the many questions of Wade Handler, whom she finds herself attracted to despite their differences -- and the gap in their ages. Past experience has proven Embry to be violent. He never liked her to have other ""male friends,"" and this time she's certain he's out to win her over... or kill her.This film has been compared to many recent movies of the same genre, which really isn't fair. The problem is that the other films came first and Abandon does try to pull a few copycat moves. But this movie has one thing going for it and that's the creepy atmosphere. Dark corridors, dusty libraries, a country cottage after dark, a mansion falling to pieces. These scenes are spliced with taunting memories as Katie relives the past. Childhood dreams of her father abandoning her. Memories of meeting Embrey, of their first kiss, their first encounter. The cinematography is beautiful but this form of filmmaking also makes the plot difficult to follow. The acting is good (Holmes and Hunnam have some real intensity between them) but the characters aren't well developed. The movie is a bit tedious at times and demands a twice-over just so you can fully understand the plot. The ending is also a cliffhanger with a sinister twist. The PG13 rating should be observed, given mostly for scenes of typical secular college life -- drinking, drugs, and casual attitudes toward sex. Language is mild, although Katie remembers Embry using the phrase ""screw you"" several times, as well as taunting God ""on his knees."" (He encourages others to shout ""I am the center of the G-d--n universe."") The scene at the Rave involves people smoking pot and taking shots of vodka.The first time she sees Embry is in a long sequence of flashing strobe lights. Wade overlooks kids in the dorms smoking marijuana. He becomes sexually involved with the girl he's investigating. Sex is implied several times, never explicit but proceeded by passionate kissing and sensual camera angles. Girls in the dorm joke about sleeping with guys. (Samantha teases Kate about ""doing"" her therapist, who tries to lure her into a relationship.) Embry remarks that Kate must be a virgin because ""no one this organized has time for sex."" We briefly see Katie in her underwear as she changes clothes. The real problem lies in the sexualized violence in the film. Embry combines advances with physical violence, slamming her around a darkened kitchen and seductively kissing her neck while describing verbal violence against one of her boyfriends. In the climax someone is struck in the head with a large rock. We briefly see the body fall to the bottom of a pool of water and the person's head covered in blood.The ending twist is more disconcerting than satisfying. On the one hand, Abandon shows how dangerous a sinful lifestyle can become. It also shows the depths of insanity and the emotional consequences of abandonment. But it also depicts the ""dirty"" side of college life graphically and doesn't give us anyone to root for. It offers some food for thought but when all is said and done more contentious viewers might want to abandon ship.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,5316,"['trailers', 'make',

734006,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000085EEU,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 4]","At the time of the release I was completely infatuated with Katie Holmes so even when my friends told me this film sucked I disagreed.  Now that she's gone completely cuckoo for Tom Cruise's puff's and I'm slowly starting to abhor her I decided to watch this film again and see if I was imagining it's greatness.  Well the verdict is in and, despite the fact that Katie is now a freak, this film is actually quite good, no where near as bad as some reviewers make it out to be.  The story follows Detective Wade Handler (Bratt) who is reopening the investigation of missing student Embry Larkin (Charlie Hunnam) that occurred two-years prior.  This involves young Kate (Holmes), Embry's ex-girlfriend, current at the time of his disappearance.  Almost as soon as the investigation begins Kate is visited by Embry and harassed by Embry to the point she begins to lose it, becoming paranoid.  On top of that Wade is slowly falling in love with Kate while growing very suspicious of her involvement in Embry's disappearance.The film follows a very dark and ominous tone, everything done in dark color schemes, voice's low and images grainy, and that adds to the mystery bound to be unlocked.  Maybe I'm nave but I don't agree that this is a predictable film.  Granted it's not utterly mind-blowing, and you may after seeing the conclusion say ""I could see that"" but I for one didn't guess the ending as so many have stated would be the case.  Regardless, this is a tightly woven thriller that, while not perfect, achieves a state of mystery that deserves to be uncovered.  Katie Holmes does wonderfully here.  She blossomed shortly after `Dawson's Creek' ended, turning out a few really decent performances (her best being `Pieces of April') and it's a shame that Cruise has taken over her mind.  Poor, poor girl.  She was better off with the loser from `American Pie'.Anyways, the supporting cast includes Zooey Deschanel, Melanie Lynskey, Gabrielle Union & Gabriel Mann, all of which do a great job, never taking away but always adding to the air of the film, Zooey Deschanel especially, an actress of which I'm also very smitten and love to see work the camera.Abandon all pre-conception and just watch it!",4,Abandon all pre-conception and just watch it!,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2206,"['time', 'release', 'was', 'completely', 'infatuated', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'so', 'even', 'when', 'friends', 'told', 'film', 'sucked', 'disagreed', 'Now', 'gone', 'completely', 'cuckoo', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'puff', ""'m"", 'slowly', 'starting', 'abhor', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'see', 'was', 'imagining', 'greatness', 'Well', 'verdict', 'fact', 'Katie', 'now', 'freak', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'make', 'be', 'story', 'Detective', 'Wade', 'Handler', 'Bratt', 'who', 'reopening', 'investigation', 'missing', 'student', 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'occurred', 'two-years', 'prior', 'young', 'Kate', 'Holmes', 'Embry', 'ex-girlfriend', 'current', 'time', 'disappearance', 'as', 'soon', 'investigation', 'Kate', 'visited', 'Embry', 'harassed', 'Embry', 'point', 'lose', 'becoming', 'paranoid', 'top', 'Wade', 'slowly', 'falling', 'love', 'Kate', 'growing', 'very', 'suspicious', 'involvement', 'Embry', 'disappearance.The', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'ominous', 'tone', 'everything', 'done', 'dark', 'color', 'schemes', 'voice', 'low', 'images', 'grainy', 'mystery', 'bound', 'be', 'unlocked', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'nave', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'predictable', 'film', 'Granted', 'not', 'utterly', 'mind-blowing', 'may', 'seeing', 'conclusion', 'say', 'could', 'see', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'guess', 'ending', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'stated', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'Regardless', 'tightly', 'woven', 'thriller', 'not', 'perfect', 'state', 'mystery', 'be', 'uncovered', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'blossomed', 'shortly', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'ended', 'turning', 'out', 'few', 'really', 'decent', 'performances', 'best', 'being', 'Pieces', 'April', 'shame', 'Cruise', 'taken', 'over', 'mind', 'Poor', 'poor', 'girl', 'was', 'better', 'off', 'loser', 'American', ""Pie'.Anyways"", 'supporting', 'cast', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'never', 'taking', 'away', 'always', 'adding', 'air', 'film', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'especially', 'actress', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'smitten', 'love', 'see', 'work', 'camera.Abandon', 'pre-conception', 'just', 'watch']",N/A
734007,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000085EEU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I tend to be rather forgiving of this kind of suspenseful thriller, even one as predictable as this one.  Abandon basically tries to accomplish what a number of other recent films have already accomplished, and that growing audience familiarity with this genre deprives Abandon of some of the shock value it might otherwise have had.  It may well pack a real punch to those who don't see the climax coming, and I think it plays rather well even to those who won't be surprised in the least, but some viewers will undoubtedly judge the film forgettable.I'm not Katie Holmes' biggest fan, and I was prepared to be unimpressed after her first few scenes, but she gradually seemed to grow into her character, and in the end I was fairly impressed by her performance.  The dark and mysterious atmosphere of the film was also a plus.  Since the story held no ultimate surprise for me, the acting and atmosphere pretty much took on the responsibility of holding my attention.  A couple of reasonably creepy scenes definitely scored this film some extra points on my scorecard.Katie Burke (Katie Holmes) seems to be all set for success.  Sure, she's having a little trouble finishing her thesis, but she's smart, meticulously organized, and a big hit at job interviews with high-paying companies.  Then the past starts to catch up with her, and everything starts to unravel.  A couple of years ago, she dated this incredibly pompous nonconformist (in all things, definitely including hairstyle) who thrived on showing up everyone around him in a desperate bid for attention.  Ol' Embry (Charlie Hunnam) up and disappeared a few weeks before graduating, though, and he hasn't been heard from since.  The guy inherited gobs of money, though, so the cops are still actively working the case.  That's where Detective Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt) comes in, as he is assigned to work the two-year-old case upon his return to active duty (following some personal problems with substance abuse).  What if Embry suddenly returns?  All Katie needs is a little more stress in her life.  And is it her fault that men seem to keep falling in love with her?Abandoned turned out to be a pretty good psychological thriller that succeeds in maintaining a dark and menacing atmosphere throughout.  I don't think its transitions between past, present, and future are handled all that smoothly, but the pathway toward the climax is a veritable funnel of emotional intensity.  It's too predictable to be great, but Abandon is more than capable of commanding your attention throughout.",4,"A satisfyingly dark, albeit predictable, psychological thriller",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,2556,"['tend', 'be', 'rather', 'forgiving', 'kind', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'even', 'one', 'as', 'predictable', 'one', 'Abandon', 'basically', 'accomplish', 'what', 'number', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'already', 'accomplished', 'growing', 'audience', 'familiarity', 'genre', 'Abandon', 'shock', 'value', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'had', 'may', 'well', 'pack', 'real', 'punch', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'climax', 'coming', 'think', 'rather', 'well', 'even', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'least', 'viewers', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'judge', 'film', 'forgettable.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'biggest', 'fan', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'unimpressed', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'gradually', 'seemed', 'grow', 'character', 'end', 'was', 'fairly', 'impressed', 'performance', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'plus', 'story', 'held', 'ultimate', 'surprise', 'acting', 'atmosphere', 'pretty', 'much', 'took', 'responsibility', 'holding', 'attention', 'couple', 'reasonably', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'scored', 'film', 'extra', 'points', 'scorecard.Katie', 'Burke', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'be', 'set', 'success', 'Sure', 'having', 'little', 'trouble', 'finishing', 'thesis', 'smart', 'meticulously', 'organized', 'big', 'hit', 'job', 'interviews', 'high-paying', 'companies', 'Then', 'past', 'starts', 'catch', 'up', 'everything', 'starts', 'unravel', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'dated', 'incredibly', 'pompous', 'nonconformist', 'things', 'definitely', 'including', 'hairstyle', 'who', 'thrived', 'showing', 'up', 'everyone', 'desperate', 'bid', 'attention', 'Ol', 'Embry', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'up', 'disappeared', 'few', 'weeks', 'graduating', ""n't"", 'been', 'heard', 'guy', 'inherited', 'gobs', 'money', 'though', 'cops', 'are', 'still', 'actively', 'working', 'case', 'where', 'Detective', 'Wade', 'Handler', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'assigned', 'work', 'two-year-old', 'case', 'return', 'active', 'duty', 'following', 'personal', 'problems', 'substance', 'abuse', 'What', 'Embry', 'suddenly', 'Katie', 'needs', 'little', 'more', 'stress', 'life', 'fault', 'men', 'seem', 'keep', 'falling', 'love', 'Abandoned', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'maintaining', 'dark', 'menacing', 'atmosphere', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'transitions', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'are', 'handled', 'smoothly', 'pathway', 'climax', 'veritable', 'funnel', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'too', 'predictable', 'be', 'great', 'Abandon', 'more', 'capable', 'commanding', 'attention']",N/A

This is the type of movie where you just have to ignore what all of the reveiwers think and just go see it if you think that it looks interesting!It stars Katie Holmes as.....Katie Burke who is in her senior year at college. Katie is under alot of stress trying to finsh her thesis and taking job interveiws. She is also just getting over the fact that her rich boyfriend Embry has been missing for two years. Embry is played by Charlie Hunnam. Since he has not spent any money or has been seen everybody thinks that he is dead. Enter Detective Wade Handler who is a recovering alcoholic and has been assigned to find out more on the Embry case. Wade's investigation leads right to Katie and he questions her to find out more. Everything is fine untill Katie starts to see a person who looks exactly like Embry. The supporting cast is also very great. The very talented Zooey Deschannel (The New Guy, Big Trouble),Gabrielle Union and Melanie Lynskey also light up the screen.The only problem with Abandon is how it is a little slow at the beginning and the scene when they are drunk or high at a party.

It's a difficult character to play but she just about makes it.The script is pretty weak but it's delivered in a deliberately empty way. We almost feel abandoned watching it.

Because her father left her when she was young and her troubled boyfriend Embry (Charlie Hunnam) disappeared a short time before she became Tom Cruise's beard, her abandonment issues are so rampant she sucks her thumb in a few deleted scenes.  Keeping her afloat are her three closest friends: slut Samantha (Zooey Deschanel), token Amanda (Gabrielle Union), and tree-hugger Harrison (Gabriel Mann).  Investigating Embry's disappearance is Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt), a man with whom Katie obviously has an instant attraction because he's significantly older, like her father...and Tom Cruise.  The plot thickens when Embry suddenly begins appearing around campus, haunting Katie from afar.Production-wise, there's nothing outstanding at all.  The cinematography is paint by the numbers predictable.  Granola on a hiking trip predictable.  The direction is above par, but uninspiring.  Holmes sideways smirks her way through the film and the others don't really do anything noteworthy.  I'm pretty sure M. Night Shyamalan wrote the script; but if he didn't, he should sue for royalties.  If you happen to labor through the lethargic pacing, you'll be treated by a Staples button ""That was easy!"" kind of ending, one hinted at early and figured out well in advance of the actual finish.  There are two subplots that go completely underdeveloped that would have completed the film.  First is the reasoning for Embry's aloofness and distance from everyone else.  Second is Wade's alcoholism, created solely to get Bratt to sign on.  Both are inconsequential precisely for the incompleteness of their storyline.The one major positive to this film is that we get to see Katie Holmes BC (Before Cruise) in her bra and panties.

Anyways, a pre-Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes plays Katie, a young college student vying to get a job at a banking company. Around this time, a cop named Wade (Benjamin Bratt) begins asking questions about her ex-boyfriend Embry Larkin (Charlie Hunnam).Embry has been missing for two years, he hasn't used his credit accounts or plan tickets he had when he went missing. But, then Katie begins to see Embry and suspects that he's spying on her...Duh. That's pretty much the plot. Zooey Deschanel, a massively underrated actress, plays Katie's friendSam who has almost all the good lines/one liners. This isn't the first movie Deschanel has made slightly better either (Failure to Launch anyone?). Anyways, Gaghan has returned to form with his last film but I don't know what happened here.

You are so great in UNDECLARED and here, in ABANDON, they must have pulled you off the set of UNDECLARED, not even giving you a moment to change your hairdo by a single curl, and wearing the same outfits you wear as the egotistical British roommate in the sitcom, and they ask you to adopt an American accent and play a driven, high modernist composer of all things, so ludicrous.  No one who watches the movie believes that Katie Holmes' character could fall for you because you're so pretentious and shallow.  And the name of your character--""Embry Larkin""!  We have a Larkin Street here in San Francisco... but mostly every time I heard the name Embry I wondered if they call you ""Embryo"" as a pet name.And Katie?  Why take a part in which your character's name is the same as your own?  Is this supposed to be a Robert Altman sort of Pirandello exercise?  You're on the screen, looking earnest, and a voice interrupts you saying, ""Katie?""  And you look up, blush, and say, ""Yes""?  Is it acting or is it real life?And watching those scenes now where Katie meets with her understanding, lecherous psychiatrist are just mindblowing now that everyone knows you and Tom are totally against psychiatrists and want to crush them!  Katie delivers a ""crushing"" putdown to Tony Goldwyn, the poor actor playing the psychiatrist, that ties right in with Hubbard's dismissal of psychiatry--was it planned that way?  Weren't you still with Chris Klein when you filmed ABANDON?  Or was this some sort of psychic pipeline into the future--a future in which the bodies of psychiatrists lie mangled, or dripping blood from lampposts?  And Tony Goldwyn of all people!

am talking here about the Detective role played by Benjamin Bratt who looks convincing in himself as an actor but he really wasn't convincing at all in the Detective's role , giving strange starings and unenthuasim performance in the very wrong places , the second mistake in casting came in the very irritating Charlie Hunnam , the problem about him was that he has been put in a role that requires some one with a haunting charisma (which he lacks completely , not the haunting charisma only but the acting charisma at well) , only Katie Holmes was great in her role but without any use because the movie itself didn't help her .Director Stephen Gaghan tried to create a semi spooky atmosphere for his movie , he seems obsessed with Steven Soderberg's style of directing and he tried to immitate it with the same shuddering distant shots he used ( very obvious in the bedroom scene between Holmes and Bratt) but his immitation was simply void , also the movie is filled with some beautiful shots and somehow good musical score , but all of these didn't help to cure it's curses .DVD FEATURES: the usual commentary from the director and the cinematographer Matthew Libatique , the usual making of , and some extended and deleted scenes with optional director's commentary with some unnecessary poorly edited scenes that actually would have made things worse if it's included in the movie , theatrical trailer for Abandon and (The Four Feathers) , so it's the usual special features , i hope they don't lose their minds and release a special edition or something like that because i think that no one is going to buy it .",1,ABANDON this movie with all the possible means,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,3344,"['was', 'very', 'rare', 'instances', 'i', 'watch', 'movie', 'almost', 'do',

Don't be fooled. It's Mr. Hunnam's presence that lights up the screen here. He has a tendency to do this in everything he's in and I rented this purely to see him. I'm sure I won't be the last person to do so. He is mesmerizing.It's a real shame his character (Embry, the missing boyfriend) couldn't be the main focus of this one (and that he wasn't discussed more on the commentary track or interviewed longer on the Making Of featurette). It would have been a more compelling film and I would have given it another star or two, I'm sure. It's definitely worth renting though to see him, if that's what you're after.It's a good film overall though I think perhaps skipping any sort of explanation of why the villain was the villain might have served it better, as the one given was a bit lame (or ""undeveloped"", as reviewers say). I don't find Katie Holmes or Benjamin Bratt compelling enough to rent or buy a movie just to see either of them, but I wouldn't say they are bad actors either. The supporting cast is solidly quirky with Zooey Deschanel as a bit of a scene stealer, as usual. Any flaws are down to the screenwriter really.That said, I didn't fast forward just to get to Charlie Hunnam's scenes. I think in this case, considering he was my only motivation for watching in the first place, that's actually a positive review.

Zwick,"[10, 12]","**1/2 ""Abandon"" is yet another in a long line of mystery films in which the audience is supposed to be thrown for a loop when it comes time for the filmmakers to unveil their ""surprise, turnabout"" ending.  Only, in this case, most reasonably intelligent filmgoers should be able to spot the outcome miles ahead of the characters.Katie Holmes stars as Katie Burke, an attractive but overstressed college student who has had serious abandonment issues ever since her father left her when she was a little girl.  It turns out that Katie was also dumped by her boyfriend, Embry Larkin, two years ago when he mysteriously vanished from school without a trace.  Benjamin Bratt plays Wade Handler, a detective sent to investigate the disappearance who believes that the boy may have met with foul play.  Suddenly, Katie starts seeing Embry popping up in various places around campus.  Has he returned or is someone playing a cruel and vicious game on the distraught young woman?""Abandon"" provides passable entertainment for undemanding mystery buffs, I suppose, but the film, as a whole, is neither particularly suspenseful nor particularly intriguing.  The details of Bratt's past, which are supposed to somehow figure into his psychology, are so sketchily filled in that we have almost no idea of what the trauma was that supposedly turned his life around.  Katie's issues are a little more clearly outlined, but her character still emerges as little more than a pop psychology clich&eacute; - as is the whole movie, in fact, when you come right down to it.""Abandon"" is not really a bad film, just an instantly forgettable one.

The story line tries so hard to be scary with dark scenes and mystery but it just doesn't cut it. It does although have a few good twists and a little humor that makes Abandon slightly bearable. I found dissatisfying about this movie was Katie's character. I found that Katie Holmes is a good actress but no person can act well when their character is severely undeveloped. Katie seemed not to have any deep thoughts through out the whole movie. She seemed to rely on everyone else to do her dirty work for her. The main thing I didn't like about Abandon was the fact that it had many scenes that were trying to be dark and mysterious. However there were so many that it just wasn't scary anymore. As well, Embry was rather dark and mysterious himself so you really only expect that he would like dark places. All in all I didn't like this movie.

At least &quot;Abandon&quot; succeeds in presenting credible characters facing the end of their days in university, and their nervous and unstable mental conditions.  The problem is, the central plot is not about them.Katie Holmes plays Katie Burke, intelligent (and a little bit icy) student preparing for the unnerving job interview with the first-rate company.  But what is more unnerving for her is the loss of her boyfriend Embry (Charlie Hunnham, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby), who has been missing for the last two years, and nobody knows whether he is dead or alive.Before her, a handsome police detective (Benjamin Bratt) appears, who is trying to locate Embry.  While trying to forget all about her past, and seeing the possibility of new love in front of her, Katie still cannot help daydreaming about her lost love.  And it seems Embry also wants to come back since she keeps on 'seeing' him on campus or in her room.  But is she just dreaming, or what?The premise is interesting, but the result is not.  We have little to find or detect from the beginning, and on the way the film starts to act as if it's not a thriller.  Without occasional episodes (like the 'eyes' staring Katie), you forget this is supposed to be a thriller.  I actually began to think that I was mistaken in supposing it's a thriller.  It is.  The thing is, it is done with a too thin material to make a  chilling thriller.The chacaters are interesting, all of them being the ones you know you see around you.  Melanie Lynskey and Zooey Deschanel give us precious support, but their characters have nothing to do with the central plot.  Their credible performance only enhances the cold atmosphere of the film, which grows more and more pretentious as it goes on.Academy-winner for the adaptaion for &quot;Traffic,&quot; Stephen Gaghan seems interested in multi-layered script.  That is nice as long as you get an interesting story, interesting enough for us to care the incidents and characters in the story.  There are many layers here, among which nothing sunstantial can be found.",2,"Abandon? Sure I Do.

734057,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000085EEU,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**Detective Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt) is the sad-sack protagonist of 'Abandon' (which should have been more aptly named 'Abandoned'). Handler has just returned to his assignment on the police force after being suspended (presumably) for a DWI or drinking on the job. Handler's supervisor won't allow him to use a squad car and wants to break him in slowly so he assigns Handler to a missing person's case. What's so unusual about this case is that the missing person in question, Embry Larkin, an artsy but rebellious college student, disappeared two years ago. It seems unlikely that a detective (even one who is returning after a suspension) would be assigned to a missing person's case (especially one that is two years old) since typically missing person's cases are not considered priority matters for a policeinvestigation.Nonetheless, Handler focuses his attention on Embry's last girlfriend at the college, Katie Burke (played by Katie Holmes). Katie at first appears to be a bright Ph.D. student who's about to finish her dissertation and apply for a high-powered corporate job at a successful consulting firm. After awhile, Katie starts believing that she's been seeing Embry pop up around campus. The film's scenarist, Stephen Gaghan (of Syriana fame), intentionally keeps you in the dark until the film's end as to whether these Embry sightings are merely figments of Katie's imagination or actual appearances by the former boyfriend.The story unfortunately drags on much too long with Katie's fleeting glimpses of Embry. Nothing much happens in terms of the plot until another one of Katie's long-term suitors, Harrison Hobart, disappears. Katie's confrontations with Embry become more aggressive as she accuses him of having a hand in Harrison's disappearance. Katie is becoming more unhinged and starts seeing a shrink to cope with the disturbing confrontations she's been having with Embry.Meanwhile, the clueless detective Handler has not been acting like a very good detective. Instead of being suspicious of all possible suspects (including Katie), he seems to accept everything she tells him at face value. As it turns out, Handler has been attending AA meetings and soon decides that police work is not for him so he hands in his badge. But just as he has resigned, he receives some important news from a crime lab buddy who informs him that a note Katie claimed she had recently received from Embry was actually two years old.Before the film's climax, Harrison pops up at the college graduation and the audience learns that his disappearance had nothing to do with foul play on Embry's part (Harrison simply lost his way while hiking in a State Park). Fortunately for him, he already decided to walk away from Katie. But former detective Handler is not so lucky. He already had an intimate moment with the psycho college co-ed. Now that it's finally dawned on him that Katie has been imagining all theseencounters with Embry, he tells her that he doesn't want to go away with her as they previously had planned.Abandon's conclusion takes place in an abandoned building near campus. In a flashback we now see what actually happened: Embry got sick of Katie and told her that he was planning to leave her so she knocked him over the head with a cement block and he falls into a pool of water, dead. The same fate awaits former Detective Handler: we see him floating dead with a bashed head in the grimy pool of water along with Embry's two year old skeleton.Abandon has some excellent cinematography, capable acting and a brooding score resulting in a nice, overall 'noirish' feel. But the story does not develop organically. It was designed primarily to showcase its 'twist ending'. Ultimately why should we really care about Katie, the film's antagonist? Does she really stand out as a unique 'femme fatale'? Not really. Sure there are a few good scenes suggesting that she's good at manipulating people (the job interview for example)but there are way too many of those clich&eacute;d childhood flashbacks suggesting parental abuse as well the aforementioned multiple 'Embry' sightings which slow the story down considerably. The same goes for Detective Handler, the protagonist, who never seems to be able to put two and two together. It's hard to like a protagonist who is so passive and pathetic.After watching Abandon for the first time, I was forced to go back and watch it again just to try and refresh my memory as to the important plot points. So many of the scenes simply are not memorable; they tend to blend into one another. Abandon's story feels more like an hour-long TV episode stretched out to fulfill the requirements of a feature film. Had it been done on TV, it would have been much more effective.",2,Better off as a one hour TV Episode,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,4778,"['**THIS', 'REVIEW', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS**Detective', 'Wade', 'Handler', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'sad-sack', 'protagonist', ""'Abandon"", 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'aptly', 'named', ""'Abandoned"", 'Handler', 'just', 'returned', 'assignment', 'police', 'force', 'being', 'suspended', 'presumably', 'DWI', 'drinking', 'job', 'Handler', 'supervisor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'use', 'squad', 'car', 'break', 'slowly', 'Handler', 'missing', 'person', 'case', 'What', 'so', 'unusual', 'case', 'missing', 'person', 'question', 'Embry', 'Larkin', 'artsy', 'rebellious', 'college', 'student', 'disappeared', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'unlikely', 'detective', 'even', 'one', 'who', 'returning', 'suspension', 'would', 'be', 'assigned', 'missing', 'person', 'case', 'especially', 'one', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'typically', 'missing', 'person', 'cases', 'are', 'not', 'considered', 'priority', 'matters', 'policeinvestigation.Nonetheless', 'Handler', 'attention', 'Embry', 'last', 'girlfriend', 'college', 'Katie', 'Burke', 'played', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Katie', 'first', 'be', 'bright', 'Ph.D.', 'student', 'who', 'finish', 'dissertation', 'apply', 'high-powered', 'corporate', 'job', 'successful', 'consulting', 'firm', 'awhile', 'Katie', 'believing', 'been', 'seeing', 'Embry', 'pop', 'up', 'campus', 'film', 'scenarist', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'Syriana', 'fame', 'intentionally', 'dark', 'film', 'end', 'Embry', 'sightings', 'are', 'merely', 'figments', 'Katie', 'imagination', 'actual', 'appearances', 'former', 'boyfriend.The', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'Katie', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'Embry', 'Nothing', 'much', 'terms', 'plot', 'one', 'Katie', 'long-term', 'suitors', 'Harrison', 'Hobart', 'Katie', 'confrontations', 'Embry', 'become', 'more', 'aggressive', 'having', 'hand', 'Harrison', 'disappearance', 'Katie', 'becoming', 'more', 'unhinged', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'cope', 'disturbing', 'confrontations', 'been', 'having', 'Embry.Meanwhile', 'clueless', 'detective', 'Handler', 'not', 'been', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'detective', 'Instead', 'being', 'suspicious', 'possible', 'suspects', 'including', 'Katie', 'accept', 'everything', 'face', 'value', 'out', 'Handler', 'been', 'attending', 'AA', 'meetings', 'soon', 'decides', 'police', 'work', 'not', 'so', 'badge', 'just', 'resigned', 'important', 'news', 'crime', 'lab', 'buddy', 'who', 'note', 'Katie', 'claimed', 'had', 'recently', 'received', 'Embry', 'was', 'actually', 'two', 'years', 'film', 'climax', 'Harrison', 'up', 'college', 'graduation', 'audience', 'disappearance', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'foul', 'play', 'Embry', 'part', 'Harrison', 'simply', 'lost', 'way', 'hiking', 'State', 'Park', 'Fortunately', 'already', 'decided', 'walk', 'away', 'Katie', 'former', 'detective', 'Handler', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'already', 'had', 'intimate', 'moment', 'psycho', 'college', 'co-ed', 'Now', 'finally', 'dawned', 'Katie', 'been', 'imagining', 'theseencounters', 'Embry', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'away', 'previously', 'had', 'planned.Abandon', 'conclusion', 'place', 'abandoned', 'building', 'campus', 'flashback', 'now', 'see', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Embry', 'got', 'sick', 'Katie', 'told', 'was', 'planning', 'leave', 'knocked', 'head', 'cement', 'block', 'pool', 'water', 'dead', 'same', 'fate', 'awaits', 'former', 'Detective', 'Handler', 'see', 'floating', 'dead', 'bashed', 'head', 'grimy', 'pool', 'water', 'Embry', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'skeleton.Abandon', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'capable', 'acting', 'brooding', 'score', 'resulting', 'nice', 'overall', 'feel', 'story', 'not', 'develop', 'organically', 'was', 'designed', 'primarily', 'showcase', ""'twist"", 'ending', 'Ultimately', 'why', 'should', 'really', 'care', 'Katie', 'film', 'antagonist', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'unique', 'fatale', 'Not', 'really', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'suggesting', 'good', 'manipulating', 'people', 'job', 'interview', 'example', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'childhood', 'flashbacks', 'suggesting', 'parental', 'abuse', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'multiple', ""'Embry"", 'sightings', 'slow', 'story', 'down', 'considerably', 'same', 'Detective', 'Handler', 'protagonist', 'who', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'hard', 'like', 'protagonist', 'who', 'so', 'passive', 'pathetic.After', 'watching', 'Abandon', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'try', 'refresh', 'memory', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'memorable', 'tend', 'blend', 'one', 'Abandon', 'story', 'more', 'hour-long', 'TV', 'episode', 'stretched', 'out', 'fulfill', 'requirements', 'feature', 'film', 'Had', 'been', 'done', 'TV', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective']",N/A
