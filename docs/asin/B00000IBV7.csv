Luke Wilson, who just got out of jail, pairs up with his friends Andy Dick, Sean Patrick Flannery, Raymond J.Barry  and Dean Cain. Flannery decides to rob a bank on the way to Wilson's  wedding and gets them all in involved in it. I haven't seen Andy Dick in  very many movies before, even though he is funny in this and I'm glad to  see him in movies because of how funny he is, it's just he plays the same  character he does in &quot;Newsradio.&quot; Some parts of this movie lag,  which is the reason it only got 4 stars but it's still good. Fred Ward  stars as Flannery's father, who just happens to be the Sheriff. Good movie,  if you have Cinemax, I believe you can watch it on there because it's not  out on video yet.

Terrell ""Merklin's Book Shop""","[5, 12]","I'm surprised after the well received TV Series &quot;Superman&quot;, Dean Cain can now only find roles in B-rated films. More suprisingly is the frequency Dean Cain plays a gay character once again. The movie as a whole was funny at times, but definitely a cable only viewing. Not once does Dean Cain even take off his shirt, which would have added to the character's development and my enjoyment. The idea of the &quot;son&quot; quoting Hamlet bored me to death. This movie needed the giant Monty Python foot to squish some characters for a good laugh thus improving the quality and rating of this film.",3,Dean Cain once again plays the &quot;gay&quot; character,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,605,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'well', 'received', 'TV', 'Series', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'can', 'now', 'only', 'find', 'roles', 'B-rated', 'films', 'More', 'suprisingly', 'frequency', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'gay', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'funny', 'times', 'definitely', 'cable', 'only', 'viewing', 'Not', 'once', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'even', 'take', 'off', 'shirt', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'character', 'development', 'enjoyment', 'idea', 'quot', 'son', 'quot', 'quoting', 'Hamlet', 'bored', 'death', 'movie', 'needed', 'giant', 'Monty', 'Python', 'foot', 'squish', 'characters', 'good', 'laugh', 'thus', 'improving', 'quality', 'rating', 'film']",Best Men VHS

A guy robs a bank. His friend walks into the bank to find out what is taking so long. He happens to be carrying a concealed weapon, so he decides to be a hero... until he realizes the robber is his friend. So he needs to rescue his friend instead of the customers, of course. Then the other friends walk in to find out what is taking so long, and suddenly they are all involved. One of the friends used to be a lawyer and says they are all accessories to the crime. Until, of course, he declares, ""I am no longer involved in this. I am now a hostage.""What?? I really didn't get the plot. So I've never been a lawyer, but I really don't see how they could all be charged in court as bank robbers just because they were friends and arrived in the same car. Why not charge the customers for not fighting back? Or the bank guard, since he gave up his gun so easily? Granted, they all got in on helping him escape, but I think that was because the dumb lawyer had them convinced they were accessories from the start.So the movie ended up being an exciting adventure/drama, with funny moments thrown in. It was just the implausible beginning that messed it up. I got this movie because I love Dean Cain, and he's pretty much the only reason I still have to give it 3 stars.",3,"Wow, depressing!",1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,1387,"['Talk', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'ever', 'was', 'movie', 'explored', 'theory', 'guy', 'bank', 'friend', 'bank', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'carrying', 'concealed', 'weapon', 'be', 'hero', 'robber', 'friend', 'rescue', 'friend', 'instead', 'customers', 'course', 'Then', 'other', 'friends', 'walk', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'suddenly', 'are', 'involved', 'One', 'friends', 'used', 'be', 'lawyer', 'are', 'accessories', 'crime', 'course', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'involved', 'am', 'now', 'hostage.', 'What', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'lawyer', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'charged', 'court', 'bank', 'robbers', 'just', 'were', 'friends', 'arrived', 'same', 'car', 'Why', 'not', 'charge', 'customers', 'not', 'fighting', 'back', 'bank', 'guard', 'gave', 'up', 'gun', 'easily', 'Granted', 'got', 'helping', 'escape', 'think', 'was', 'dumb', 'lawyer', 'had', 'convinced', 'were', 'accessories', 'start.So', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'exciting', 'adventure/drama', 'funny', 'moments', 'thrown', 'was', 'just', 'implausible', 'beginning', 'messed', 'up', 'got', 'movie', 'love', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'reason', 'still', 'have', 'give', '3', 'stars']",Best Men VHS

Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot.Luke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore).  Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks.  Billy doesn't tell his buddies that he's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy's father!  Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber).The movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale.  This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest.  Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since ""Cuckoo's Nest"" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet.  Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent.  It's the best work I've seen Cain do.The movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy!
