And that's whatHow To Make It In Americais all about -- a clever little dramedy about three different businesses that are trying to get off the ground, and the highs and lows they encounter along the way. It's a little quirky, gritty, and riddled with romantic problems.Mild-mannered Ben Epstein (Bryan Greenberg) and his street-smart buddy Cam Calderon (Victor Rasuk) decide to start a denim clothing line called Crisp, but run into a bunch of problems -- they have little money, one investor, no business plan and a disastrous sample. Even as their dreams seem to crash and burn, they discover a new business road has just opened up -- if they can keep their hands on the merchandise.In the meantime, Ben's ex-girlfriend Rachel (Lake Bell) has a wealthy new boyfriend named Darren, which might be good for her designing agency -- but bad for her personal life. And Cam's cousin Rene (Luis Guzm&aacute;n), who has just gotten out of prison, is going legit with an energy drink called Rasta Monsta -- which is encountering the same sorts of problems as Crisp.""How To Make It In America"" is all about pursuing the American Dream in the 21st century: you need opportunity, street smarts, connections, and lots of hard work. It's not quite as brilliant as some of HBO's other shows, but it does have an endearing, gritty earnestness -- and it reminds you that for every successful business that takes off, there are dozens of failed ones.Along the way, there are lots of dimly-lit New York nightclubs, shady street venders and warehouses piled high with vintage T-shirts. The writing is fun and often clever (""Edie, do you know where I can find some X?"" ""Top drawer on the left""), and the writers balance out drama and low-key comedy with an expert hand.The one downside: it feels a bit unfocused at times, with side-plots about a crazy skateboarder and Ben's new girlfriend. They don't really add anything to the main plot.Greenberg and Rasuk are a strong pair of Odd-Coupley leads: Ben is a pleasant, mild-mannered young man who's been disappointed over and over, and Cam is a fiercely ambitious, optimistic young man who pounces on every chance for success.Bell does a pretty good job as Rachel, but she honestly doesn't get to do very much for the first five episodes or so -- but her about-faces in the last few are great. Guzman is compelling as an ex-con valiantly trying to run a legit business, and Shannyn Sossamon is wildly underused as quirky trust-fund art-dealer Gingy Wu.""How to Make It In America"" is a gritty, sleek little show that might blossom into something more. All it needs is a little more oomph and a bit of the fat trimmed off.",4,"""The secret is not to get rich quick -- the secret is to get rich slow.""",1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2718,"['Starting', 'own', 'business', 'risky', 'painful', 'full', 'stumbles', 'whatHow', 'Make', 'Americais', 'about', 'clever', 'little', 'dramedy', 'three', 'different', 'businesses', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'highs', 'lows', 'encounter', 'way', 'little', 'quirky', 'gritty', 'riddled', 'romantic', 'problems.Mild-mannered', 'Ben', 'Epstein', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'street-smart', 'buddy', 'Cam', 'Calderon', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'decide', 'start', 'denim', 'clothing', 'line', 'called', 'Crisp', 'run', 'bunch', 'problems', 'have', 'little', 'money', 'one', 'investor', 'business', 'plan', 'disastrous', 'sample', 'Even', 'dreams', 'seem', 'crash', 'burn', 'discover', 'new', 'business', 'road', 'just', 'opened', 'up', 'can', 'keep', 'hands', 'merchandise.In', 'meantime', 'Ben', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'wealthy', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'named', 'Darren', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'designing', 'agency', 'bad', 'personal', 'life', 'Cam', 'cousin', 'Rene', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'who', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', 'prison', 'going', 'legit', 'energy', 'drink', 'called', 'Rasta', 'Monsta', 'encountering', 'same', 'sorts', 'problems', 'Crisp', 'How', 'Make', 'America', 'pursuing', 'American', 'Dream', '21st', 'century', 'need', 'opportunity', 'street', 'smarts', 'connections', 'lots', 'hard', 'work', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'brilliant', 'HBO', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'endearing', 'gritty', 'earnestness', 'successful', 'business', 'off', 'are', 'dozens', 'failed', 'way', 'are', 'lots', 'dimly-lit', 'New', 'York', 'nightclubs', 'shady', 'street', 'venders', 'warehouses', 'piled', 'high', 'vintage', 'T-shirts', 'writing', 'fun', 'often', 'clever', 'Edie', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'X', 'Top', 'drawer', 'left', 'writers', 'balance', 'out', 'drama', 'low-key', 'comedy', 'expert', 'hand.The', 'one', 'downside', 'bit', 'unfocused', 'times', 'side-plots', 'crazy', 'skateboarder', 'Ben', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'main', 'plot.Greenberg', 'Rasuk', 'are', 'strong', 'pair', 'Odd-Coupley', 'leads', 'Ben', 'pleasant', 'mild-mannered', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Cam', 'fiercely', 'ambitious', 'optimistic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'chance', 'success.Bell', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Rachel', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'so', 'about-faces', 'last', 'few', 'are', 'great', 'Guzman', 'compelling', 'ex-con', 'valiantly', 'trying', 'run', 'legit', 'business', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'wildly', 'underused', 'quirky', 'trust-fund', 'art-dealer', 'Gingy', 'Wu', 'How', 'Make', 'America', 'gritty', 'sleek', 'little', 'show', 'might', 'blossom', 'something', 'more', 'little', 'more', 'oomph', 'bit', 'fat', 'trimmed', 'off']",How to Make It in America: Season 1

I have seen each episode quite a few times already but it will be nice to see a whole bunch straight through instead of having to wait the usual week for the next episode.As for my view of this show, it's amazing. It's a little gritty and sometimes you really do not know what is going to happen. As much as I enjoy the mulitple story lines the only one I could of done a little less with was with Lake Bell and Martha Plimpton. I'm not saying it should of not been included at all, just a little less of it. I do find Lake Bell sexy as hell. A naturally looking beautiful woman.As for the plot lines, the writers have it right. Thank god it's on HBO because they can basically do what they want and make it sort of real. No language or content barriers to deal with make this show so much better. Luis Guzman nails his role as man just out of prison trying to make his way in a sort of, but not quite, honest way. As for they main characters, Ben & Cam, watching them struggle and everything not always coming out right keeps you wanting to see what will happen next.The new season (2nd) is about to start. It's been a real long wait. Other shows that started at the same time are already going on their 3rd seasons why 'How to..' is only on it's second. I guess the actors had to be free from other roles and scripts and locations have to be obtained. Still, if season 2 is anywhere near the 1st season it should be great. I only wish HBO would release the seasons faster. I know they want people to subscribe to their On Demand or watch their channel for it but I love being able to watch them whenever I want on blu-ray.So Amazon, please send me this ASAP.
