923014,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000A6T2BM,Cubist,"[2, 2]","Robert Rodriguez uses CGI to create one imaginative landscape after the next. It's the kind of movie kids will love because it doesn't talk down to them. They are the heroes much like in the Spy Kids movies but this one isn't nearly as inventive. Once Max, SharkBoy and LavaGirl arrive on Planet Drool, the film really opens up visually, utilizing the 3-D technology quite effectively.For example, at one point our heroes fly over a landscape of brains on the way to the World of Milk and Cookies which features rivers of milk with chocolate chip cookie rafts that transport our protagonists through this world filled with frosting capped ice cream scoop hills.The Adventures of SharkBoy and LavaGirl in 3-D is a good fantasy film for kids and should appeal to them because it imagines them as brave superheroes with great powers. Unlike most kids movies this one is filled with all kinds of clever ideas and colourful images without being an obvious feature-length ad for a toy line or video game.There is an audio commentary by director Robert Rodriguez. He made this movie with a lot of his family. His son Racer Max (who joins him for a bit) came up with the story and many of the characters. As always, the filmmaker delivers an engaging and informative commentary. One quickly gets the impression that he's an extremely creative guy and this extends to his kids.""Creating `SharkBoy and LavaGirl' with Racer Max"" features Rodriguez narrating home movies of he and his kids as they draw and talk about the movie.

923016,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000A6T2BM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Thanks to Sin City, I'm now a Robert Rodriguez fan, so I took advantage of my chance to give The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl a try.  I can't comment on the 3-D effects because I only saw the 2-D version.  I can say, however, that I really got a kick out of this movie.  I would have to disagree with those who say the story sort of loses traction in the final stages.  What you have to remember is that this story, as it is presented, is a story borne of a young boy's imagination.  It's just not in the spirit of things to go in expecting a completely logical ending to a story dreamed up by a fourth-grade kid.  I do agree that the main character's parents, played by David Arquette and Kristen Davis, are sort of flat, but I thought all of the other actors really came through pretty strongly.  OK, Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) could really get annoying at times, but that Lavagirl really lights up the screen; I fully expect to see Taylor Dooley flashing that winning smile of hers in many a film for years to come.  As for George Lopez (in a dual role), I thought he was great and played especially well to the target audience, which is, after all, youngsters (and us adults desperately trying to keep our inner child alive).Max (Cayden Boyd) is pretty easy to identify with.  His parents bicker all the time, the other kids at school pick on him and make fun of him, and he's well on his way to developing a real ""why me?"" mentality.  His only escape from the real world comes in the form of his highly imaginative dreams.  It's all there in his dream journal - how he unexpectedly discovered Sharkboy while fishing, how Lavagirl appeared and took Sharkboy back with her to Planet Drool in order to help save the planet, and how he declined to go with them because, well, he had to go back to school.  It all makes for a great story, but Max doesn't win any friends by telling the story of Lavagirl and Sharkboy in the form of his ""what I did over the summer"" oral report.  The class bully steals his journal, and it starts to look like Max won't even have the escape valve of his elaborates dreams to get him through the coming days of ridicule and general unhappiness.It's just about then that Sharkboy and Lavagirl show up unexpectedly, tell Max they need his help, and whisk him away to Planet Drool, where Mr. Electric and his power plug army are close to succeeding in bringing perpetual darkness to what should be the ultimate kids' playground of a planet.  That's when the adventure really begins, with many a wonderful setting brought to vivid, very colorful life on the screen.  Unfortunately for Max, he doesn't exactly know what to do to stop Mr. Electric (or the evil overseer who's really running the show).  He must reclaim his stolen dreams before ""remembering"" all of his unique powers.In a way, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is sort of a modern variation on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as Planet Drool is a wonderland for the eyes.  There is plenty of action as the trio of heroes fight off the forces of darkness (although I'm not clear on who taught Sharkboy martial arts, seeing as how he was raised by sharks and all), there are numerous laughs to be had by children of all ages, and some actual life lessons are imparted by the time everything is said and done.  Imagination is important, especially for a child, but you have to work to make your dreams come true rather than merely use them as an escape; your enemies aren't so bad that you can't find a common ground with them; finding your purpose in life is integral to making you happy; etc.  To me, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl qualifies as a wonderfully entertaining family-friendly film that kids (and a fair share of adults) should really enjoy.",4,"A highly imaginative, entertaining film for kids of all ages",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,3765,"['Thanks', 'Sin', 'City', ""'m"", 'now', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'fan', 'took', 'advantage', 'chance', 'give', 'Adventures', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'try', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', '3-D', 'effects', 'only', 'saw', '2-D', 'version', 'can', 'say', 'however', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'disagree', 'who', 'say', 'story', 'sort', 'loses', 'traction', 'final', 'stages', 'What', 'have', 'remember', 'story', 'presented', 'story', 'borne', 'young', 'boy', 'imagination', 'just', 'not', 'spirit', 'things', 'go', 'expecting', 'completely', 'logical', 'ending', 'story', 'dreamed', 'up', 'fourth-grade', 'kid', 'do', 'agree', 'main', 'character', 'parents', 'played', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Kristen', 'Davis', 'are', 'sort', 'flat', 'thought', 'other', 'actors', 'really', 'came', 'pretty', 'strongly', 'OK', 'Sharkboy', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'could', 'really', 'get', 'annoying', 'times', 'Lavagirl', 'really', 'up', 'screen', 'fully', 'expect', 'see', 'Taylor', 'Dooley', 'flashing', 'winning', 'smile', 'hers', 'many', 'film', 'years', 'come', 'George', 'Lopez', 'dual', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'played', 'especially', 'well', 'target', 'audience', 'youngsters', 'adults', 'desperately', 'trying', 'keep', 'inner', 'child', 'alive', '.Max', 'Cayden', 'Boyd', 'pretty', 'easy', 'identify', 'parents', 'time', 'other', 'kids', 'school', 'pick', 'make', 'fun', 'well', 'way', 'developing', 'real', 'why', 'mentality', 'only', 'escape', 'real', 'world', 'form', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'dreams', 'there', 'dream', 'journal', 'how', 'unexpectedly', 'discovered', 'Sharkboy', 'fishing', 'how', 'Lavagirl', 'appeared', 'took', 'Sharkboy', 'back', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'order', 'help', 'save', 'planet', 'how', 'declined', 'go', 'well', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'great', 'story', 'Max', ""n't"", 'win', 'friends', 'telling', 'story', 'Lavagirl', 'Sharkboy', 'form', 'what', 'did', 'summer', 'oral', 'report', 'class', 'bully', 'journal', 'look', 'Max', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'escape', 'valve', 'elaborates', 'dreams', 'get', 'coming', 'days', 'ridicule', 'general', 'unhappiness.It', 'just', 'then', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'show', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'tell', 'Max', 'need', 'help', 'whisk', 'away', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Electric', 'power', 'plug', 'army', 'are', 'close', 'succeeding', 'bringing', 'perpetual', 'darkness', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'ultimate', 'kids', 'playground', 'planet', 'when', 'adventure', 'really', 'many', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'brought', 'vivid', 'very', 'colorful', 'life', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'Max', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'stop', 'Mr.', 'Electric', 'evil', 'overseer', 'who', 'really', 'running', 'show', 'must', 'reclaim', 'stolen', 'dreams', 'remembering', 'unique', 'powers.In', 'way', 'Adventures', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'sort', 'modern', 'variation', 'Alice', 'Adventures', 'Wonderland', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'wonderland', 'eyes', 'plenty', 'action', 'trio', 'heroes', 'fight', 'off', 'forces', 'darkness', ""'m"", 'not', 'clear', 'who', 'taught', 'Sharkboy', 'martial', 'arts', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'raised', 'sharks', 'are', 'numerous', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'children', 'ages', 'actual', 'life', 'lessons', 'are', 'imparted', 'time', 'everything', 'said', 'done', 'Imagination', 'important', 'especially', 'child', 'have', 'work', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'rather', 'merely', 'use', 'escape', 'enemies', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'finding', 'purpose', 'life', 'integral', 'making', 'happy', 'etc', 'Adventures', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'qualifies', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'kids', 'fair', 'share', 'adults', 'should', 'really', 'enjoy']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

We had to buy our own version in the end as after 2 weeks they still didn't want to give it back. It's up there in their favourite top 3 films ever. It's one of those films you'll watch time and time again and it's interesting enough for adults to sit through.It is visually stunning. The bright colours and action of the computer generated scenes are way different to anything I've seen before and the story of a young boy struggling with all the day to day problems associated with parents, school, bullies, teachers etc will hit a cord with any primary school age child.This 3D version comes with 2 pairs of pink glasses and 2 pairs of blue glasses. They are the standard flimsy cardboard type but in the film the boy hero gets to wear the pink ones too so my children loved joining in. In the 3D version you do not need to wear the glasses all the time. There are 'glasses on' and 'glasses off' messages on the screen. It is mainly in the fantasy scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl they need to be worn. The fantasy aspect of the film really utilises the 3D glasses. Lava rocks coming towards you etc.There normal film version without the 3D is also available on this disk and now the novelty of the glasses has worn off this is the version my childen watch most.The characters in this film are really cool and modern. In many ways this is like an ultra modern updated 'Never Ending Story' film. There is some clever dialogue and it is a superb riot of imagination let loose on the screen.

One, how did Taylor Lautner went from lil' shrimp tobig and beefyin three years?  Two, why is Mr. ""Desperado"" Rodriguez continuing to make films meant sorely for his tikes, nevermind this movie being based on the director's kid's stories?  None of his children films represent the director at his best, and his recent ones went fancy with the 3D technology.  I don't like his approach to 3D, which the stuff he throws at the audience's face are blatantly forward and they're not well-done; I'm also astound by how gaudy the background and CGI effects of his latest kids' films are.  I can forgive that in ""Spy Kids 3-D"" since the low-quality CGI of that movie captured the look of a modern-age, fun-for-all gaming world it's going for, but here, not so much.  The visuals in ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" are so distracting, it pushed me away from the movie.Much of the look has been made by the dreams of a kid named Max.  He got picked on because he tend to confuse dreams with reality in his show-and-tells, and his family didn't approved his warped view of reality.  But then one night he dreamed of a world he wanted to escape, and the next day his dream became a reality when the titular characters crashed into his school class and took him to Planet Drool, where he must stop a great evil from shutting down the planet and ridding the world of dreams.  The world is just one, big, green-screen effect and the kids are just going from point A to point B.  I won't complain about the movie lacking in imagination (heck, the spark plug monsters were creative), but I will complain about a certain character in the film: Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley) and her incessant smile.As I mentioned before, characters who almost always smile chill down my spine, and Dooley's character does it so frequently and in a very picturesque way.  She's not as creepy in smiling as Nia Vardalos, but it's nevertheless felt unnatural.There are films that cater to both adults and kids, and this movie isn't one of them.  It's strongly meant for kids, considering the name 'Planet Drool', a land of milk & cookies, girls and boys wearing specifically in gender-preferred colors, and how the adults of the film talk immaturely.  The movie's too childish to reach the child within me.  I'm sure kids themselves are gonna enjoy this for the colorful adventure, so I'm willing to call this a decent timewaste, though I won't be surprised if the kids grow out of this film once they hit puberty.",3,"""Kids Only"" Affair",1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2560,"['Two', 'questions', 'came', 'mind', 'watching', 'Adventures', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'only', '2D', 'One', 'how', 'did', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'went', 'lil', 'shrimp', 'tobig', 'beefyin', 'three', 'years', 'Two', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Desperado', 'Rodriguez', 'continuing', 'make', 'films', 'meant', 'sorely', 'tikes', 'movie', 'being', 'based', 'director', 'kid', 'stories', 'None', 'children', 'films', 'represent', 'director', 'best', 'recent', 'ones', 'went', 'fancy', '3D', 'technology', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'approach', '3D', 'stuff', 'audience', 'face', 'are', 'blatantly', 'forward', ""'re"", 'not', 'well-done', ""'m"", 'also', 'astound', 'how', 'gaudy', 'background', 'CGI', 'effects', 'latest', 'kids', 'films', 'are', 'can', 'forgive', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3-D', 'low-quality', 'CGI', 'movie', 'captured', 'look', 'modern-age', 'fun-for-all', 'gaming', 'world', 'going', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'visuals', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'are', 'so', 'distracting', 'pushed', 'away', 'movie.Much', 'look', 'been', 'made', 'dreams', 'kid', 'named', 'Max', 'got', 'picked', 'tend', 'confuse', 'dreams', 'reality', 'show-and-tells', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'approved', 'warped', 'view', 'reality', 'then', 'one', 'night', 'dreamed', 'world', 'wanted', 'escape', 'next', 'day', 'dream', 'became', 'reality', 'when', 'titular', 'characters', 'crashed', 'school', 'class', 'took', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'where', 'must', 'stop', 'great', 'evil', 'shutting', 'down', 'planet', 'ridding', 'world', 'dreams', 'world', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'green-screen', 'effect', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'point', 'point', 'B.', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'movie', 'lacking', 'imagination', 'heck', 'spark', 'plug', 'monsters', 'were', 'creative', 'will', 'complain', 'certain', 'character', 'film', 'Lavagirl', 'Taylor', 'Dooley', 'incessant', 'smile.As', 'mentioned', 'characters', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'smile', 'chill', 'down', 'spine', 'Dooley', 'character', 'so', 'frequently', 'very', 'picturesque', 'way', 'not', 'creepy', 'smiling', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'nevertheless', 'felt', 'unnatural.There', 'are', 'films', 'cater', 'adults', 'kids', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one', 'strongly', 'meant', 'kids', 'considering', 'name', 'Drool', 'land', 'milk', 'cookies', 'girls', 'boys', 'wearing', 'specifically', 'gender-preferred', 'colors', 'how', 'adults', 'film', 'talk', 'immaturely', 'movie', 'too', 'childish', 'reach', 'child', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'are', 'gon', 'enjoy', 'colorful', 'adventure', ""'m"", 'willing', 'call', 'decent', 'timewaste', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'kids', 'grow', 'film', 'hit', 'puberty']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

Basically the main thread of this film is a knock off of a far superior older kids film called THE NEVER ENDING STORY which I enjoyed very much.The rest is pure Hollywood PC tripe written with a Manual and is by far the weakest of the Rodriquez family series.One major fault of the movie is that the child actors who have to carry this are just so-so in their chops. No Dakota Fannings or Drew Barrymore's here.The other big let down is that script is so busy with it's moral that the characters are just left flat and uninteresting and very humorless.The real kids viewing this were a lot funnier than the ones on screen. Adventure should have a few laughs to tone down the tension.I may be fifty two but I'm a big kid myself and really enjoyed CHICKN LITTLE 3D but this was a snore with the exception of the best red and blue 3D process so far. Very young or undemanding kids may go for it but the 12 year old I showed it to recently for the 3D was begging me to shut it off and play Monty Python instead.

923028,A1UX9XJPK7U0XU,B000A6T2BM,"Evelynne ""Evelynne""","[1, 1]","I caught this movie a few times on the Disney Channel, and I thought the whole plot was clever and appropriate for kids.  It does not make a lot of sense, but that is the whole point, isn't it?  Dreams are not supposed to be sensible, but the story itself propels through out the film.  Thus, creating an adventure where kids discover what really goes inside their minds at night.Now, for the acting.  George Lopez is hilarious as he is in many of his films, and him as an electric outlet to match his name was nearly genius.  He makes me laugh nearly all the time, and I thought he pushed his comidian persona a little bit farther in this.  That is what gave the film its spark.Taylor Lautner:  First major film role, and he definately nailed it as Sharkboy.  He is funny, and a little mean, but that is what made it good.  The thing that I observed about Lautner in this is that he is suppoosed to be ten in the film, but I can tell that he is maturing, and looks older then what he is supposed to be.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed him play the part.Camdyn Boyd:  I have to admit that although he is a cute kid(I meant that in a obsevation sense, not the other way), he was kind of annoying to me in the film.  Usually got on the friends nerves, but how he came up with the whole dream sequencw is really smart.  I just wish he did less whining, then it would have been better.Taylor Dooley:  She is very pretty, but like Lautner, looks older then the part.

Reading the other reviews, it amuses me how many people gave it 1 star because of bad acting/special effects, etc as if it can be compared to other regular films.  This is a kids movie, and if you watch it expecting something else, you WILL be disappointed.Now for the review of the movie.  This is much better than Spy Kids 3D, hands down.  The 3D effects are good, including lots of stuff flying at you or people pointing at you.  The kids in the audience were thrilled.  Even I was amused.  True, they should've used the gray 3D instead of the blue/red because it would've preserved the dazzling color we all saw in the film's trailer.  So yes, the 3D portion does have that weird purplish hue that plagued Spy Kids 3D.  But that doesn't stop you from enjoying the scenery.  Kids and adults will find this aspect of the film highly entertaining.  As expected, the 3D is what makes this film.The adult actors (most notably Kristin Davis and David Arquette) are not as into the film as we'd like, but their role in the film is very small anyways.  The kids in the film, however, are really into it!  They're not the best actors in the world, but they're very good.  I'd say they're better than any actor in the Star Wars prequels.The story is a wildly imaginative spin on The Neverending Story.  A boy, Max, is at school one day when his imaginary superheroes Sharkboy and Lavagirl come and whisk him away to Planet Drool, which he created in his dreams.  He has to save it from 'The Darkness' by dreaming it back into health.  Yes, it's been done before (Planet Drool = Fantasia, The Darkness = The Nothing), but for a new generation, it's a very neat movie!  What kid has never dreamed of being taken away by imaginary superheroes to a new world where everyone has powers?  I know I did when I was a kid.  On a side note, I found it amusing to see the old original Game Boy and an old 8-bit NES controller in the film.  Ah, nostalgia!I went to see this movie expecting something to see while I turned my brain off.  And that's exactly what I got.  It kept me entertained, and I got my money's worth.  I'd recommend anyone to take their kids to see it.",4,Fun and entertaining KIDS movie,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2222,"['really', 'wanted', 'rate', '3.5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'so', 'rounded', 'up', 'Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'gave', '1', 'star', 'bad', 'acting/special', 'effects', 'etc', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'regular', 'films', 'kids', 'movie', 'watch', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'WILL', 'be', 'disappointed.Now', 'review', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3D', 'down', '3D', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'including', 'lots', 'stuff', 'flying', 'people', 'pointing', 'kids', 'audience', 'were', 'thrilled', 'Even', 'was', 'amused', 'True', 'should', ""'ve"", 'used', 'gray', '3D', 'instead', 'blue/red', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preserved', 'dazzling', 'color', 'saw', 'film', 'trailer', 'So', 'yes', '3D', 'portion', 'have', 'weird', 'purplish', 'hue', 'plagued', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3D', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'scenery', 'Kids', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'aspect', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'expected', '3D', 'what', 'film.The', 'adult', 'actors', 'most', 'notably', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'David', 'Arquette', 'are', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'role', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'anyways', 'kids', 'film', 'however', 'are', 'really', ""'re"", 'not', 'best', 'actors', 'world', ""'re"", 'very', 'good', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'better', 'actor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels.The', 'story', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'spin', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'A', 'boy', 'Max', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'imaginary', 'superheroes', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'come', 'whisk', 'away', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'created', 'dreams', 'save', ""'The"", 'Darkness', 'dreaming', 'back', 'health', 'Yes', 'been', 'done', 'Planet', 'Drool', '=', 'Fantasia', 'Darkness', '=', 'Nothing', 'new', 'generation', 'very', 'neat', 'movie', 'What', 'kid', 'never', 'dreamed', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'imaginary', 'superheroes', 'new', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'powers', 'know', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'side', 'note', 'found', 'amusing', 'see', 'old', 'original', 'Game', 'Boy', 'old', '8-bit', 'NES', 'controller', 'film', 'Ah', 'nostalgia', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'expecting', 'something', 'see', 'turned', 'brain', 'exactly', 'what', 'got', 'kept', 'entertained', 'got', 'money', 'worth', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'take', 'kids', 'see']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

923044,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000A6T2BM,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[30, 46]","I had high expectations for this film when I sat down to watch it with my daughter.  Both she and I enjoyed watching Rodriguez' other kiddie flicks, the ""Spy Kids"" films, and we were expecting something just as entertaining.  Unfortunately, ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" just didn't hold up that well.The story revolves around a kid named Max and a world that exists only in his dreams, or so he thought.  In this world, Planet Drool, everything that Max dreams about, including daydreams, comes to life.  The two most important things are Shark Boy and Lava Girl.  They are a pair of superheroes who basically have a run of the entire dream world.When Max tells his classmates about his two favorite heroes, the class laughs at him for thinking that the duo actually exists.  However, when Shark Boy and Lava Girl come to get Max to help them save Planet Drool, the kids begin to believe him.  What follows is a computer-animated dream sequence that makes up the bulk of the film.  It includes a literal ""train of thought,"" a land of giant milk and cookies, and a nasty dude named Mr. Electric, whom Max dreamed up and based on his school teacher, Mr. Electricidad(George Lopez).  Max and his pair of superfriends have to save Planet Drool from Mr. Electric and another bad guy from the real world named Linus, who calls himself ""Minus"" in the dream world.You'd think a story filled with such vivid and bright worlds and characters would be fun to watch, but the 3-D aspect of this film muddles the colors to a bland blue and red tint.  Also, the 3-D gets pretty old very quick.  There are plenty of explosions, sneezes, spittle, etc. that fly at the screen that try to make you lean back in your seat, but fail.  There's also a lot of pointing, close-ups, and even a ""brain storm"" resulting in a brain ""sticking"" to the movie screen.The acting isn't that great either.  George Lopez just seems to be going through the motions in his dual role, and David Arquette and Kristen Davis are bland at best as Max's parents.  The kid that plays Max has some pretty garish looks on his face that I'm guessing are supposed show fear, but he just looks silly.The idea of the dream world is the best part of the flick.  Heavy on word play, a lot of things take on a literal form like the aforementioned ""train of thought.""  Shark Boy and Lava Girl aren't bad either, though Shark Boy's dance number seems way out of place in this flick.The story has a good message of always following and believing your dreams no matter how silly they may seem.  But in the end, this flick just doesn't have enough gas to keep children fully interested.  In fact, my daughter(she's four) took off her glasses just a few minutes into the story.  She enjoyed it more with her glasses off because she got to see the vibrant colors better, even though the picture was ""fuzzy"" to her.

923061,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000A6T2BM,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like ""Elf"" and ""Toy Story"" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called ""family films"" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like ""Clifford's Really Big Movie"" and ""Muppets from Space"" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.Then along comes Robert Rodriguez with ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as ""Spy Kids"", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" for 14 year olds who saw ""Spy Kids"" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.So don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.Which is not to say that only those in its target audience will  enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Yellow Submarine"". In one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make your dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is ""Max""). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other. It is entertaining just to watch kids (both girls and boys) get into it.Speaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used.

Why?1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth.  No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back.  So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh?  Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age.  In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid.  I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.3)  At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters.  However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world.  It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in.  This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.4)  Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images.  Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land.  It was nice to see.5)  I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways.  GREAT cinematography.So yeah.  Good movie.  Better than Spy Kids.What probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl.  They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best.  Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been.  These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.I can't make other people like it, but I sure do.--PolarisDiB",4,Huh...,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2261,"['liked', 'it.Yep', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'contemporary', 'children', 'movies', 'Why', '1', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'have', 'depth', 'No', 'seriously', 'superheroes', 'go', 'take', 'angst', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'adapt', 'well', 'younger', 'crowd.2', 'theme', 'imagination', 'perfect', 'fall-back', 'movie', 'stupid', 'direction', 'huh', 'Unfortunately', 'remember', 'childlike', 'imagination', 'going', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'fact', 'almost', 'stuff', 'shown', 'right', 'down', 'ending', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'type', 'random', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'come', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'related', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'usually', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'angry', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'match', 'type', 'daydreaming', 'imagination', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'spent', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'playground', 'thinking', 'random', 'child', 'superheroes', 'have', 'adventures', 'with.3', 'first', 'virtual', 'reality', 'world', 'course', 'too', 'cartoony', 'real-world', 'characters', 'However', 'what', 'up', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'interact', 'fake', 'world', 'seamless', 'while', 'forgot', 'how', 'fake', 'was', 'Much', 'more', 'beloved', 'much', 'more', 'highly', 'rated', 'films', 'have', 'CGI/special', 'effects', 'worlds', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'characters', 'are', 'moving', 'one', 'walking', 'along', ""'re"", 'really', 'there.4', 'Rodriguez', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'most', 'artistic', 'original', 'movies', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'streaming', 'together', 'line', 'images', 'Invisible', 'editing', 'conscientious', 'directing', 'kept', 'story', 'flowing', 'pretty', 'much', 'smoothly', 'milk', 'cookie', 'land', 'was', 'nice', 'see.5', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', '3-D', 'felt', 'was', '3-D', 'anyways', 'GREAT', 'cinematography.So', 'yeah', 'Good', 'movie', 'Better', 'Spy', 'Kids.What', 'probably', 'people', 'off', 'are', 'ending', 'scenes', 'barely', 'BARELY', 'worked', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', ""'re"", 'very', 'discombobulating', 'acting', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'Finally', 'Linus/Minus', ""n't"", 'best', 'child', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'developed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'reasons', 'people', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'caught', 'rest', 'movie.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'other', 'people', 'sure', 'do.', 'PolarisDiB']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

By the end we were all like, ""That was the biggest waste of my time ever!"" Seriously, my eleven year old brother (who is a very creative personnage and talented artist), could have done better than this pathetic excuse for a motion picture when he was three. ANd then I went and watched the special features, only to find that most of the movie was created by the directors four year old son! If anyone should be able to make a movie at that age it should have been my brother KYle.For one thing, everything from the plot to the dialogue was so horrible I wanted to scream.THe entire storyline was complete anarchy and made so many leaps and bounds it was nausiating.The dialogue (particularly on SHark Boy's part) seemed to me to be a cross between a badly translated Japanese samuri movie, Kung Pow, and just a hint of Tolkein for good measure or something. In the end, the result was utter garbage.I HATED how sudden elements to the story suddenly appeared or came out of nowhere. Such as Lava Girl's desperate quest for her identity. I mean really, Shark BOy is trying to get Max, who dreamed up the world their stuck on, to get them out of a situation by dreaming. THen suddenly out of the blue, Lava Girl wants to know where she came from and what her purpose is. THere was abosolutely NO mention of this before hand and was down right annoying the rest of the time.THe acting was TERRIBLE! I couldn't believe that actors that bad existed. The worst of these was the actor who did Max, it was like he had just graduated from preschool and was just repeating the lines he had heard from the directors as best he could. THere was no emotion or desireable quality in any of it.George Lopez did provide a bit of comic relief, and even though my brothe disliked the movie about as much as I did, he still quotes the line ""YOU turned me into a big, round bad guy!"" incessively. However, this sad bit of effort was like trying to prevent the world trade centers from falling by using a fishing pole.

It combines the efluscent star power of Around The World in 80 Days, the profound poignancy of Schindler's List, and the awesome production value of any Star Wars movie.  Star Cayden Boyd is one of the most talented actors of the decade, the new Spencer Tracy, a cross between Tracy and Laurence Olivier - and only eleven years old.  The plot is well plotted and the outstanding camera work just jumps right out of the screen at you - especially if you wear the 3-D glasses provided.  The script is well scripted and the lighting well lit. If there's any flaw in this movie, it's that Lava Girl is just a bit too young - she should have been played by Nicole Kidman.

923067,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000A6T2BM,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[10, 11]","Sharkboy and Lavagirl is like a painting without 3D glasses. Put on the glasses and you experience a magical reality where dreams change your world and where the challenge is to overcome the nightmares.This movie is as much about facing fears and positive thinking as it is about special effects. It is especially impressive in this regard, with witty dialogue and spontaneous and unexpected turns of event.I found Lavagirl to be a beautiful character with a loving heart and playful outlook on life. She sometimes forgets her powers and they use this for comic effect. She seems a little lost at first, as if seeking her greater purpose all while enjoying a playful combative interchange with Sharkboy.The scenes take place in a school and in a magical dream reality. The characters move from real life to dreams in an instant and you can fall asleep and dream up a new reality in your dreams. It is all very fun and I found myself laughing throughout at the innocent humor and creative surprises. I think adults will get the ""brainstorm"" joke even more than children would and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids to enjoy. I also thought there were some amazingly profound moments during the conversations and if you realize what it would take to say those lines to someone who is a bully, that in itself should impress.On the fun visual side, lands of cookies and milk present culinary adventures as Lavagirl, Sharkboy and Daydreamer Max float through a world on a huge chocolate chip cookie. Then you have a volcano and worlds of imagination reminiscent of a theme park ride. There is a mildy dark nemesis who is the bully and he aggravates the situation by appearing in Max's dreams. He steals Max's diary. I loved that Max had a dream journal and how reading through the journal/diary made his dreams come true. Changing the dreams, changed the settings and this presents the challenge.The amazing thing about this movie is how it was inspired by a child's imagination and when you watch the extras, I think you will be even more impressed. I would love to see more movies like this because it reminds me of the hope we have as children and how we can still dream our worlds into life as adults. I think this movie gives children an empowering message and to be honest, some of the issues discussed in this movie could change a child's world for the better. Max is a great role model and his actions speak of a wisdom far beyond his years. As Max learns to navigate his own imagination, he is really teaching children amazing lessons about how to navigate life.Highly Recommended along with the 3D glasses!~The Rebecca Review",5,Dreams and Magical Realities,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2640,"['Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'painting', '3D', 'glasses', 'Put', 'glasses', 'experience', 'magical', 'reality', 'where', 'dreams', 'change', 'world', 'where', 'challenge', 'overcome', 'nightmares.This', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'facing', 'fears', 'positive', 'thinking', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'impressive', 'regard', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'spontaneous', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'event.I', 'found', 'Lavagirl', 'be', 'beautiful', 'character', 'loving', 'heart', 'playful', 'outlook', 'life', 'sometimes', 'powers', 'use', 'comic', 'effect', 'little', 'lost', 'first', 'seeking', 'greater', 'purpose', 'enjoying', 'playful', 'combative', 'interchange', 'Sharkboy.The', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'school', 'magical', 'dream', 'reality', 'characters', 'move', 'real', 'life', 'dreams', 'instant', 'can', 'fall', 'asleep', 'dream', 'up', 'new', 'reality', 'dreams', 'very', 'fun', 'found', 'laughing', 'innocent', 'humor', 'creative', 'surprises', 'think', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'brainstorm', 'joke', 'even', 'more', 'children', 'would', 'plenty', 'humor', 'adults', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'also', 'thought', 'were', 'amazingly', 'profound', 'moments', 'conversations', 'realize', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'say', 'lines', 'someone', 'who', 'bully', 'should', 'impress.On', 'fun', 'visual', 'side', 'cookies', 'milk', 'present', 'culinary', 'adventures', 'Lavagirl', 'Sharkboy', 'Daydreamer', 'Max', 'float', 'world', 'huge', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'cookie', 'Then', 'have', 'volcano', 'worlds', 'imagination', 'reminiscent', 'theme', 'park', 'ride', 'mildy', 'dark', 'nemesis', 'who', 'bully', 'situation', 'appearing', 'Max', 'dreams', 'Max', 'diary', 'loved', 'Max', 'had', 'dream', 'journal', 'how', 'reading', 'journal/diary', 'made', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'Changing', 'dreams', 'changed', 'settings', 'challenge.The', 'amazing', 'thing', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'inspired', 'child', 'imagination', 'when', 'watch', 'extras', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'hope', 'have', 'children', 'how', 'can', 'still', 'dream', 'worlds', 'life', 'adults', 'think', 'movie', 'children', 'empowering', 'message', 'be', 'honest', 'issues', 'discussed', 'movie', 'could', 'change', 'child', 'world', 'better', 'Max', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'actions', 'speak', 'wisdom', 'far', 'years', 'Max', 'navigate', 'own', 'imagination', 'really', 'teaching', 'children', 'amazing', 'lessons', 'how', 'navigate', 'life.Highly', 'Recommended', '3D', 'glasses', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 1]","To be honest, I would've never watched this movie had I not been curious what other movies Taylor Lautner was in. The plot of the movie made it clearly obvious that it was for children. Why grown-ups are so critical of it and why there are so many complaints about the name ""Planet Drool"" is beyond me. It's a young boy's dream. What did you want it to be called? The Eiffel Tower Sophisticates?Anyway, the movie is about a young boy who daydreams too much and ends up creating Sharkboy and Lavagirl. He stores his dreams in a journal, but when the class bully decides to destroy his journal, all of his dreams get mixed up. When the dreams come to life, he's forced to live out his own dreams plus the other boy's. Too much of what he wants to happen can't happen because he can't remember some old dreams, he can't figure out how to get back to sleep (or daydream) initially and George Lopez's character (the antagonist) keeps trying to distract him. When the Ice Princess, Lavagirl's enemy (for temperature reasons obviously) gets involved, things get a little more creative.The film started off a little slow with the arguing between Max's parents, but after the dream became reality it picked up. I was fascinated with the boy's creations in his mind. And yes, I was amused by Lautner. All of his characters seem to have anger issues, and in this movie he had a smart mouth, was always threatening to beat somebody up (the bedtime song was hilarious) and was determined to be in charge of the ocean. He was also the voice of the bully on a Charlie Brown episode, played a bully on ""My Wife and Kids"" and by now most of you know his character as Jacob Black. Interesting how all of his characters are stronger by nature, sometimes non-human, temperamental and funny. All of the actors held their weight though, and I was pleased to see George Lopez and Taylor Lautner in a film together. I didn't know they'd ever worked together until I caught an episode of ""Lopez Tonight.""As an adult, the movie was a fun way to escape my reality for a little over an hour. I'd watch it again.

Kids who have never seen a 3D movie would really enjoy it, but those who have and those who have seen better would hate it. This sad, defensless kid writes this book of things he dreams about and takes it for granted that everything that he writes is real. Then no one believes him and so on. Then Shark boy and Lava girl break in and take the kid to some weird planet. Then random problems and drama take up most of the rest of the movie. Also, random things happen that make you disgusted like when the scene was all dramatic, Shark boy sings a little song that is like 2 minutes that must have been copied off a Nick Jr. show or something. Another one is that Lava Girl keeps dying for some reason. Why, she probably dies like 10 times in just 30 minutes. Also, shark boy gets really violent in a lot of scenes. He is always like ""Maybe I shoulf punch your brains out"" and ""Still hungery? I'll give you a knuckle sandwhich!"" Of course, this would amusing to little kids but not mature kids.At the end of this movie, don't be surprised if your child pretends to be like Lava Girl or Shark Boy and talk about the movie until you go mad.

923080,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,B000A6T2BM,SylvesterFox007,"[3, 4]","I saw some of the most highly anticipated movies of this summer.  ""Batman Begins"", ""Fantastic Four"", and, of course, ""Star Wars: Episode III.""  Ironically, I didn't leave the theater after any of those movies, even ""Star Wars"", feeling as awestruck as I did after walking out of ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl.""Wait!  I know what you're thinking.  ""I'd rather see Batman or Star Wars or the Fantastic Four.""  By all means, see those movies.  You'll get your money's worth.  Just don't overlook this movie as being some stupid kiddie movie.  I went to see it with my little brother, and I was glad I did.Of course, the thing that distinguishes this movie from all the other summer films is the 3D part.  Only the genius of Robert Rodriguez could resurrect 3D movie.  When they were first invented, the 3D was to impress adults, and the plots were preposterous in order to accommodate objects hurtling out of the screen.  It makes more sense to have a 3D kid's movie, where a preposterous plot is acceptable and where you'd expect random objects to fly at you.  The 3D element is even better this time than in Rodriguez's last attempt, ""Spy Kids 3D.""  The scenes seem to have actual depth and width and, from aerial shots, height.  The 3D becomes more and more impressive as the movie progresses.  All of the really good effects, those where you'd swear the object was actually floating just a couple of rows in front of you, are saved until the end.The movie also gives you more to think about than most summer movies, even without the 3D element.  There's a Freudian theme about what causes dreams and how fantasy can affect reality.  There's also a few messages about growing up kids can take home with them (along with their 3D glasses.)The movie has a lot in common with ""Spy Kids 3D.""  There's a 3D prologue, a 2D introduction to the characters, a 3D alternate dimension that a child travels to, and a 3D villain that makes his way into the 2D world for a final showdown.

But, I like this one the best, because the 3-D is sharp and colors are stunning.Honestly, this is one of those few times when a movie is much better looking on DVD than it was in the theaters.This movie played in theaters in Anaglyph format (red/cyan 3-D glasses), which distorted the colors and lessened the 3-D effect. I'd give it a bad review in the theaters. The other DVD release of this movie was also Red/Cyan 3-D. But, this particular DVD release is HQFS (High Quality Field Sequential), a MUCH better 3-D format .You need a 3-D viewing system (like ASIN: B00005QW5S ) to watch it. (LCS shutter glasses, not red/blue glasses.)One last important note: The description says this DVD is in Full Screen (not Wide Screen). Truth is that it actually is some form of wide screen. It is not as cropped as a real Full Screen disc. If played in full screen mode, characters are slightly thinner than usual. When I put my system in Wide Screen mode, this DVD it looks more correct. There is one viewing wide screen resize mode of my system in which it looks perfect. Normally, I wouldn't buy a DVD unless it is labelled Wide Screen, but this DVD is an exception.Certainly, if you love 3-D and haven't seen this movie in the theaters, then I'd recommend this DVD.

923085,A3UI00DVXAJLW4,B000A6T2BM,"Tony ""Ynot""","[4, 4]","Let me begin by saying that as a rule, I don't usually support movies that portray kids in the savior role.  I object to this mainly because I believe we, as a society, have elevated kids above their status by our constant portrayal of children as wiser, smarter and more cleaver than adults.  By letting them constantly view children in this role, is it any wonder that so many kids have no respect for adults.  I realize there are some adults that are not worthy of any respect... but now I am wandering off topic.  Although Sharkboy and LavaGirl's hero is a small boy, he still remains respectful of adults in the real world.  This is why I fully support this film.As a child I was the ultimate ""Day Dreamer"" (Max's title on the Dream World).  I walked around in my own little world most of the time.  As a result I was called numerous unflattering names: Dingbat, AirHead and Breezy, just name a few.  This resulted in a low self-esteem that took years to overcome.  Max helps us see that an imagination may be something that will come in handy and may even be something to be admired even though many see it as an excuse for name calling.The only thing that keeps this from being a Five Star is that in the end the kid is the only one smart enough to save the world: once again adults are portrayed as incapable, but at least the kid still remains respectful to authority figures.",4,The movie I wish they had made when I was a kid.,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1385,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'rule', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'support', 'movies', 'portray', 'kids', 'savior', 'role', 'object', 'mainly', 'believe', 'society', 'have', 'elevated', 'kids', 'status', 'constant', 'portrayal', 'children', 'wiser', 'smarter', 'more', 'cleaver', 'adults', 'letting', 'constantly', 'view', 'children', 'role', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'respect', 'adults', 'realize', 'are', 'adults', 'are', 'not', 'worthy', 'respect', 'now', 'am', 'wandering', 'off', 'topic', 'Sharkboy', 'LavaGirl', 'hero', 'small', 'boy', 'still', 'respectful', 'adults', 'real', 'world', 'why', 'fully', 'support', 'film.As', 'child', 'was', 'ultimate', 'Day', 'Dreamer', 'Max', 'title', 'Dream', 'World', 'walked', 'around', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'most', 'time', 'result', 'was', 'called', 'numerous', 'unflattering', 'names', 'Dingbat', 'AirHead', 'Breezy', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'resulted', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'took', 'years', 'overcome', 'Max', 'see', 'imagination', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'come', 'handy', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'something', 'be', 'admired', 'even', 'many', 'see', 'excuse', 'name', 'calling.The', 'only', 'thing', 'being', 'Five', 'Star', 'end', 'kid', 'only', 'one', 'smart', 'enough', 'save', 'world', 'once', 'again', 'adults', 'are', 'portrayed', 'incapable', 'least', 'kid', 'still', 'respectful', 'authority', 'figures']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version
923086,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000A6T2BM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Robert Rodriguez, definitely brilliant film director, proves with this terribly empty `Sharkboy and Lavagirl' that we need something better than CGI to make a film that deserves the name of film. `The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl' would only offer the cheap 3D images that would make you dizzy, and floundering in confusion, almost meaningless sequences that go on like your nightmare last night.We don't need summery of the plot for there is none. Like the third `Spy Kids' film, it looks like watching video games someone else is doing from behind. The only difference is that you cannot control the characters you are watching.Well, but actually, there is a story first suggested by Rodriguez's then seven-year son.  In short, young timid boy Max, always daydreaming about superhero/heroine -- Sharkboy and Lavagirl -- is tormented by his teacher and is bullied by some of the classmates. But suddenly these two fictional characters arrive in the real world, and tell Max that their home Planet Drool is in danger.So far the film fares well. But on the Planet the story gets suddenly weaker, and becomes confusing at times. The three kids keep traveling on the planet, sometimes on a huge cookie floating on the milk, sometimes chased by a minion of the Darkness (George Lopez), or sometimes attacked by electric eels. Everything happens here in a very whimsical fashion, and I finally couldn't understand why they have to roam so long.[3D... DO WE NEED IT?] Yes, I know. We cannot expect IMAX theater from this red-and-blue glasses, but unlike in `The Spy Kids: Game Over' we have to sit through the film's 3D part very long. After the second on-screen instruction `GLASSES ON,' the 3D section on Planet Drool goes on and on, never stopping for us to have a rest (probably about 3/4 of the film is shot in 3D). After staring at the screen so long, tears started to gather in my eyes. Is this only me?Perhaps the pictures of the fantasy world look better in the all-2D version, but not having seen it, I cannot tell. The only thing I can add here is this, well, it is a bit cruel to say this, but it is about the acting. Unlike his pal Quentin Tarantino (who single-handedly revamped the career of Travolta and made Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman international stars), Rodriguez has never been famous for extracting the best performances from the actors in his films. Yes, his films are fun to see, but we don't see his films for acting. But in `Sharkboy and Lavagirl' things get worse than before. The four kids are rather dull, George Lopez is over-the-top, and about the cameos from David Arquette and Kristen Davis, all I can say is that they are decent actors, and need decent characters or dialogues to do.I like Rodriguez's playful style, and really love three `The Spy Kids' films, especially the first one that is still one of my favorite family pictures, but I couldn't love this one. And we often write like `Kids would love this.' Yes, they do, (and I too often write that way, I admit), but probably the kids who love this film would love any `Spy Kids' films or animations from Pixar.",2,Like Playing Video Game: Weak Story and Characters with Whimsical Ideas,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3105,"['Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'definitely', 'brilliant', 'film', 'director', 'terribly', 'empty', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'need', 'something', 'better', 'CGI', 'make', 'film', 'name', 'film', 'Adventures', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'would', 'only', 'offer', 'cheap', '3D', 'images', 'would', 'make', 'dizzy', 'floundering', 'confusion', 'almost', 'meaningless', 'sequences', 'go', 'nightmare', 'last', 'night.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'summery', 'plot', 'none', 'third', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'film', 'watching', 'video', 'games', 'someone', 'else', 'doing', 'only', 'difference', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'characters', 'are', 'watching.Well', 'actually', 'story', 'first', 'suggested', 'Rodriguez', 'then', 'seven-year', 'son', 'short', 'young', 'timid', 'boy', 'Max', 'always', 'daydreaming', 'superhero/heroine', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'tormented', 'teacher', 'bullied', 'classmates', 'suddenly', 'two', 'fictional', 'characters', 'arrive', 'real', 'world', 'tell', 'Max', 'home', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'danger.So', 'far', 'film', 'well', 'Planet', 'story', 'suddenly', 'weaker', 'confusing', 'times', 'three', 'kids', 'keep', 'traveling', 'planet', 'sometimes', 'huge', 'cookie', 'floating', 'milk', 'sometimes', 'chased', 'minion', 'Darkness', 'George', 'Lopez', 'sometimes', 'attacked', 'electric', 'eels', 'Everything', 'here', 'very', 'whimsical', 'fashion', 'finally', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'have', 'roam', 'so', 'long.', '[', '3D', 'DO', 'WE', 'NEED', 'IT', ']', 'Yes', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'IMAX', 'theater', 'red-and-blue', 'glasses', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'Game', 'have', 'sit', 'film', '3D', 'part', 'very', 'long', 'second', 'on-screen', 'instruction', 'GLASSES', 'ON', '3D', 'section', 'Planet', 'Drool', 'never', 'stopping', 'have', 'rest', 'probably', '3/4', 'film', 'shot', '3D', 'staring', 'screen', 'so', 'long', 'tears', 'started', 'gather', 'eyes', 'only', 'Perhaps', 'pictures', 'fantasy', 'world', 'look', 'better', 'all-2D', 'version', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'add', 'here', 'well', 'bit', 'cruel', 'say', 'acting', 'pal', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'revamped', 'career', 'Travolta', 'made', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'international', 'stars', 'Rodriguez', 'never', 'been', 'famous', 'extracting', 'best', 'performances', 'actors', 'films', 'Yes', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'films', 'acting', 'Sharkboy', 'Lavagirl', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'before', 'four', 'kids', 'are', 'rather', 'dull', 'George', 'Lopez', 'over-the-top', 'cameos', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Kristen', 'Davis', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'decent', 'actors', 'need', 'decent', 'characters', 'dialogues', 'do.I', 'Rodriguez', 'playful', 'style', 'really', 'love', 'three', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'films', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'family', 'pictures', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'one', 'often', 'write', 'Kids', 'would', 'love', 'Yes', 'do', 'too', 'often', 'write', 'way', 'admit', 'probably', 'kids', 'who', 'love', 'film', 'would', 'love', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'films', 'animations', 'Pixar']",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D also includes 2d version

I was interested only in watching the feature once so I could watch it again with commentary without being distracted. It turns out the movie isn't all that bad.The setup is a little simplistic and the child actors aren't always great, but there are moments of poignance. Lava Girl's alternation between hero worship of and frustration with Max reveals a complex relationship between creation and creator. When she cries ""Why did you dream me up? Am I supposed to be evil? What's my purpose?"" there's a deep sense of anguish, surprising for a kid's movie.The 3-d effect was also fairly good on my TV, and most of the time the movie made pretty good use of it. Of course, there were also gratuitous ""let's throw things at the audience"" parts throughout.The commentary was a disappointment. Most commentary tracks from Robert Rodriguez feel very carefully prepared and delivered, with a dense flow of information not only about the production on screen, but about creativity, motivation, family, and moviemaking.
