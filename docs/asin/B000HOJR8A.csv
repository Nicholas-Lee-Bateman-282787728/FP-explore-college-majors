Most of the scientists/professors that he interviews and the quotes used in this documentary are taken entirely out of context but that context is readily available to those who are willing to read the original scientists/professors work(s). Unfortunately, for the majority of people they neither have the inclination or have the resources to do so (which is often the problem. It can be quite tedious to refute pseudo-science with point by point arguments and examples but it is often necessary to do so so that pseudo-science does not win out at the end of the figurative day).Jacobovici does generate some interesting ideas, but when an idea is based on fancy (such as the evolution of the name Egyptian Pharaoh Ahmose from the Hebrew Moses as a single example amongst many - Jacobovici proposes that the name Ahmose was perhaps given to him by his father Seqenenre Taa II because he remembered the Israelite prince he grew up with and Ahmose is simply a ""play on words"". Woah! Perhaps if you use English as the basis for the Egyptian spelling of Ahmose and then translated that to Hebrew. In other words, the ""play on words"" is based upon Jacobovici's mispronounced Pharaoh's name) then it is easy to refute such an idea with an education or even keen interest in linguistics and even proto-linguistics (there are reems of scholarly books on the subject). Although Jacobovici does stipulate this last idea as just a fanciful hypothesis, it does have a tendancy to lend credence to other ""factual"" claims that he makes further on in the documentary.I can appreciate the level of quality that went into this documentary. Large dollars were spent as attested to the involvement of James Cameron as a Producer of the piece. Just because something looks glossy doesn't mean that there is any real ""science"" going on. And this brings up another fact. Science is not written in stone, it is not hardened against other more radical ideas supplanting it. However, for a ""new"" scientific understanding, reinterpretation of the available data, or refutation of that data comes to light through the form of hypothetical processes, they must be able to stand up against scrutiny from many different scientific practices and disciplines; Exodus Decoded does not. If you're unable to take my word for it (and I grant that I've only made the most cursory arguments against a very early point in the documentary) why should you accept Jacobovici's method? He is after all, just a film-maker.There is one point that I thought Jacobovici makes which I do find to be fairly sound. Or, in other words, I've been unable to conclusively or even intelligently refute. This pertains to the Hebrew term ""Amo"", or as Jacobovici states, ""God's People"". I've read essays and dissertations on the flawed argument that ""Amo"" does in fact translate as such but it all seems rather vague. Jacobovici does point out in other mediums besides this documentary, that the Hebrew people often still refer to themselves as Amo Israel, and I cannot dispute this and so I'm left with a minor contention that Jacobovici is correct in this one assumption made on the documentary. However, this single contention does not accurately reflect or shed new scientific light on the proposed problems that are inherent within Jacobovici's hypothesis.",1,"Well produced, poor science.",1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,3410,"['single', 'case', 'one', 'refutation', 'Jacobovici', 'findings', 'are', 'matter', 'scientific', 'record', 'Most', 'scientists/professors', 'quotes', 'used', 'documentary', 'are', 'taken', 'entirely', 'context', 'context', 'readily', 'available', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'read', 'original', 'scientists/professors', 'work', 'Unfortunately', 'majority', 'people', 'have', 'inclination', 'have', 'resources', 'do', 'so', 'often', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'tedious', 'refute', 'pseudo-science', 'point', 'point', 'arguments', 'examples', 'often', 'necessary', 'do', 'so', 'so', 'pseudo-science', 'not', 'win', 'out', 'end', 'figurative', 'day', '.Jacobovici', 'generate', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'when', 'idea', 'based', 'fancy', 'such', 'evolution', 'name', 'Egyptian', 'Pharaoh', 'Ahmose', 'Hebrew', 'Moses', 'single', 'example', 'amongst', 'many', 'Jacobovici', 'name', 'Ahmose', 'was', 'perhaps', 'given', 'father', 'Seqenenre', 'Taa', 'II', 'remembered', 'Israelite', 'prince', 'grew', 'up', 'Ahmose', 'simply', 'play', 'words', 'Woah', 'Perhaps', 'use', 'English', 'basis', 'Egyptian', 'spelling', 'Ahmose', 'then', 'translated', 'Hebrew', 'other', 'words', 'play', 'words', 'based', 'Jacobovici', 'mispronounced', 'Pharaoh', 'name', 'then', 'easy', 'refute', 'such', 'idea', 'education', 'even', 'keen', 'interest', 'linguistics', 'even', 'proto-linguistics', 'are', 'reems', 'scholarly', 'books', 'subject', 'Jacobovici', 'stipulate', 'last', 'idea', 'as', 'just', 'fanciful', 'hypothesis', 'have', 'tendancy', 'lend', 'credence', 'other', 'factual', 'claims', 'further', 'documentary.I', 'can', 'appreciate', 'level', 'quality', 'went', 'documentary', 'Large', 'dollars', 'were', 'spent', 'as', 'attested', 'involvement', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Producer', 'piece', 'Just', 'something', 'looks', 'glossy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'real', 'science', 'going', 'up', 'fact', 'Science', 'not', 'written', 'stone', 'not', 'hardened', 'other', 'more', 'radical', 'ideas', 'supplanting', 'However', 'new', 'scientific', 'understanding', 'reinterpretation', 'available', 'data', 'refutation', 'data', 'light', 'form', 'hypothetical', 'processes', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'many', 'different', 'scientific', 'practices', 'disciplines', 'Exodus', 'Decoded', 'not', ""'re"", 'unable', 'take', 'word', 'grant', ""'ve"", 'only', 'made', 'most', 'cursory', 'arguments', 'very', 'early', 'point', 'documentary', 'why', 'should', 'accept', 'Jacobovici', 'method', 'just', 'film-maker.There', 'one', 'point', 'thought', 'Jacobovici', 'do', 'find', 'be', 'fairly', 'sound', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'been', 'unable', 'conclusively', 'even', 'intelligently', 'refute', 'Hebrew', 'term', 'Amo', 'Jacobovici', 'states', 'God', 'People', ""'ve"", 'read', 'essays', 'dissertations', 'flawed', 'argument', 'Amo', 'fact', 'translate', 'such', 'rather', 'vague', 'Jacobovici', 'point', 'out', 'other', 'mediums', 'documentary', 'Hebrew', 'people', 'often', 'still', 'refer', 'Amo', 'Israel', 'can', 'not', 'dispute', 'so', ""'m"", 'left', 'minor', 'contention', 'Jacobovici', 'correct', 'one', 'assumption', 'made', 'documentary', 'However', 'single', 'contention', 'not', 'accurately', 'reflect', 'shed', 'new', 'scientific', 'light', 'proposed', 'problems', 'are', 'inherent', 'Jacobovici', 'hypothesis']",The Exodus Decoded

Huber ""Addicted to books!""","[10, 15]","Exodus Decoded is titled far more assertively than it delivers - it's more ""Exodus sort of looked at in a different way than most others have done while still leaving a lot of questions and some loopholes in process.""The production values are certainly of the highest quality here - the computer graphics are whizbang, look very cool, and actually do contribute to the arguments and narrative that Jacobovici is offering.Unfortunately, the level of scientific facts do not succeed in achieving the same heights of excellence as the whizbang graphics.I'm not as willing as some other reviewers to call this entirely nonsense, but I'm also not as willing as some others to just accept everything here as absolute fact and go running around proclaiming ""See! The Bible is historically perfectly true!""The truth is, we really don't know when (or even if) the Exodus happened, and if it did happen, don't really know how. Other than the account in the Bible, there isn't much secondary proof out there of any of the biblical claims. And trying to piece together anything that far back into history is somewhat of a fool's errand.Given that we probably will never really know the details, I think Jacobovici offers some compelling stuff to think about, but not a lot to take super duper seriously, or consider as definitely ""solved"".Watch this, but watch it with a critical eye and have your hermeneutic of suspicion set on 11 and ready to use at a moment's notice. Who knows? The Exodus could very well have happened in the mid-1400s BCE, as he proposes; the stele could show bas reliefs of the crossing of the Reed See; Sinai could be where he says it is; and so on.Perhaps the best way to sum this up is to say that is worth watching, so long as you remember that everything Jacobovici says should be preceded with ""maybe"" or ""possibly"" or could end with ""but I might be wrong"".Unfortunately, Jacobovici rarely offers that kind of humility and academic honesty in this documentary, and offers his statements as finished, completely researched and proven facts.And that's why I give it three stars, and not five. If he'd said ""Here's some cool stuff I'm thinking about, and why - let me show you, and see what you think"", I'd like this a lot more. But when people say, especially about history, ""Here's what happened"", I grow weary and wary.I am buying a copy to use in my church adult education, but I will be sure to offer it as a possibility and generator of discussion, not as scientific or even scholarly fact.",3,"Eh.

1015364,AOPPHDPD830VJ,B000HOJR8A,"Holy Olio ""holy_olio""","[15, 23]","I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary, since what I'd read about it didn't have anything but the really stupid claim -- that the death of Pharaoh connected with the eruption of Thera -- which has been regurgitated over recent years.  There's no connection between Thera and Exodus, just as there's no connection between a 2nd millennium eruption and the end of Minoan civilization.  While I share the view that unusual natural events made the Exodus possible, Thera was not it; neither is there anything to the ""Mt Sinai a Volcano"" school of thought.Jacobivici and company present the case well.  The graphical manipulation of various artifacts, IOW the special effects, I found to be eye-catching and helpful.  I found the detective work which led to plausible identifications of the Sea of Passage and Mt Sinai compelling.  But the supposed connection between the Thera eruption and the so-called site of Avaris (it isn't Avaris) had already been broken by the time of the broadcast when the pumice stone was found to be from a different volcano (and a volcano which erupted 10s of 1000s of years ago, to boot).  Even the expert shown in a clip stated that he'd found forty ash grains he claimed were from Thera -- that's a mighty small number for a super-eruption.  Of course, I had the same reaction when I learned that the average layer of (supposedly) Theran ash in Crete was 5 mm.Worst of all was the blatantly false statement -- no doubt made due to overreliance on Charles Pellegrino -- that the supposed Theran super-eruption wiped out Minoan civilization.  That's been rejected for at least forty years, and during the last ten or fifteen years the drive to push the supposed super-eruption into the middle of the 17th c BC made the disconnect worse, because instead of 80 or so years for the civilization to die, it's now 150 or more.  To put that in perspective, it's as if, in 1859, Mt St Helens had erupted with three orders of magnitude more energy than it did in 1980, but US society managed to survive and thrive, only to vanish next year as a result of that eruption.Amazon reader reviewer ScienceMinded was exactly correct -- Velikovsky should have been credited, since the naos of el-Arish and the Papyrus Ipuwer are linchpins for the late Dr's ""Ages In Chaos"".  Had Jacobovici et al been familiar with that work, they'd have noted that the name of the site given in the inscription on the naos synchs with the name of the place given in the Old Testament, thus strengthening their case.  In 1945, when Velikovsky identified the Papyrus Ipuwer as an Egyptian account of the ten plagues of the Exodus, the general view of its date was Old Kingdom, with some viewing it as Middle Kingdom in date; now Jacobivici states that it is generally  seen as a 1st Intermediate Period document, which exactly agrees with Velikovsky.I liked the program's segment on the monuments from Schliemann's dig at Mycenae.  His novel interpretation of the images on those stones were interesting.  I didn't think he was right, not at all, and thought his treatment of that particular corner of his theory was sketchy at best.  Bietak excavated Tell el-Dab'a in Egypt and found Minoan frescoes.  Seagoing trade has been going on for thousands of years in the eastern Mediterranean (at least!), even into prehistoric times (the obsidian trade reached Aegean Islands and more).It is generally thought that Linear A was invented (or adapted?) by the Minoans, and it is nearly universally agreed that Linear A does not contain Greek -- unlike Linear B, which does, and probably was based on Linear A.  If Linear A conceals a Semitic language -- and there's only one scholar of whom I'm aware who thinks it does -- then Jacobovici's idea about the origin of these monuments would be strengthened.  But he doesn't develop this idea, merely -- and sensationally -- equates a cryptic gold artifact with the ever-popular Ark of the Covenant.  There's even a clip of Indy opening the crypt and finding the Ark.Jacobivici's claim that the Egyptian government doesn't like anyone trying to investigate the Exodus and kept an eye on the documentary group's activities rang true.  Anyone who calls that claim evidence of some kind of conspiracy theory is just ignorant.  Zahi Hawass has pushed his cuckoo view that ancient Egypt was slavery-free, and anyone who digs in Egypt has to toe that ridiculous party line.  In his own book, Kent Weeks, rediscoverer of KV-5, describes a problem his team had with the Egyptian government's destructive mishandling of aerial photos taken by the team in order to map the Valley of the Kings, a problem they had to circumvent by trickery in order to effectively do their job -- and the Egyptian antiquities authorities *like* the Theban Mapping Project.  Gantenbrink got banned from the Giza plateau simply for announcing his fairly modest finds in the Great Pyramid.  Some people seem to forget that nominally democratic Egypt is a police state.I didn't notice anything that would make it objectionable for those few parents who still care what their children watch.  Jacobovici even closes the show by suggesting, despite the apparent natural causes of the plagues and Pharaoh's death, that God made it happen in order to free his Chosen People.  As long as the chronology used in the show isn't taken seriously -- Ahmose was most definitely *not* the Pharaoh of the Exodus -- I think you'll enjoy this disk.  I do strongly suggest reading Immanuel Velikovsky's ""Ages In Chaos"" to get the chronology straight.",3,Baggage Train from Egypt,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,5542,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised',

But as soon as the ""documentary"" starts, I can tell these guys are way out of their league, mostly, with what the bible actually says.I could pick this ""documentary"" apart with a fine-toothed comb but I don't have alot of time and to be honest, anyone with a tiny ammount of bible knowledge wouldn't need me to.  But I'll list some probs that I can recall without even blinking:#1) Not sure what to think about their idea of what happened to the Nile (gas theory) since EVEN THE WATER IN THE BUCKETS in Egypt turned into blood also. Oops, skipped over that did we?  Exodus 7:19-20.  This, in fact, is not even MENTIONED in the documentary.  They can decipher ""red"" and ""reeds"" but not even acknowledge the obvious and THEY are the ones making the documentaries?  Scary.#2) They also don't explain how Pharoah's magicians did the same miracales Moses did at first.  Exodus 7:9-13, 7:22#3) If the water at El Balah descended into sinkholes then you have discrepancies with Psalm 78:13, Exodus 14:22 and 29 that the Jews walked specifically on DRY ground and that the water stood as a WALL to the RIGHT and LEFT of them.Need I go on?

Moreover, the documentary alleges that the Mycenaean swords found were brought to Mycenae by those same Israelites. Apart from the fact that if indeed they had been innocent slaves who just wanted to be set free they would not have been armed or carrying somebody else's gold with them which indicates that maybe they were not that ""innocent"" (and which is a different story altogether), mixing Israelites and Mycenaeans is dangerous and absurd to say the least.After watching The Exodus Decoded I headed to the Athens Archeological Museum (30 minutes' drive) to see for myself these claims regarding the three piece stonework depicting the charioteer (Pharaoh) and the artifact claimed to depict the Ark. In both cases you have to let your imagination run amuck before reaching the conclusions that this ""documentary"" is trying to sell.Presenting accurate and valid sources proving the close relations between the Minoans and the Egyptians and how the Minoans were the only people recognized by Egypt as being civilized has very little if anything to do with the topic apart from throwing in a few truths to make the tale being spun more believable.This ""History Channel"" documentary is overflowing with bias and wishful thinking in all its glory. The so-called ""passion of Jewish-Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici"" mentioned by Tom Keogh in the editorial review does nothing whatsoever to prevent Jacobovici's work and by extension himself personally from being dishonored and discredited.Is someone maybe trying to give much more significance to certain groups than is deserving or historically accurate???

1015369,A14JRNU2JVRBPA,B000HOJR8A,Robert K. Pavlick,"[15, 23]","Jacobovici presents interesting theories of possible natural causes for the 10 plagues, but like the Midas Muffler man, he ""makes it all fit"" by juggling dates and numbers. He pushes the date of the Exodus back to 1500 BC and moves the date of the Santorini eruption up 100 years from 1600 to 1500 BC to make the theory work. He claims that Jacob migrated to Egypt in 1700 BC and that they remained there for 200 years. This is a direct contradiction of Exodus 12:40 which distinctly says that they were there for 430 years which would bring the Exodus to around 1270 BC, not 1500 BC and long after the Hyksos expulsion. Also it is highly irregular to equate the Israelites, a farming and herding people who only migrated into Egypt due to famine, with the Hyksos who were a trading and warlike people who took Lower Egypt by conquest and held it for 108 years; they were not slaves in need of deliverance. The Hyksos were not freed due to the 10 plagues; they had to be driven out by the armed forces of Middle Kingdom Pharoah Ahmose who had evidence that they were forming an alliance with the Nubians to take over Egypt entirely.Jacobovici's claim that the 10th plague was caused by carbon dioxide bubbling up from the water due to seismic activity as in the case of Lake Nyos in the Camaroon in 1986 seems plausible enough, but that was a lake of standing water. Iron deposits and gasses would not normally bubble up in a fast river current as in the case of the Nile. Plus he claims that the reason that only the first-born of Egypt died was because the first-born were highly honored and slept on the first floor as opposed to servants and poor who would have slept on the roofs and thereby not have been exposed to the gas. But would not Pharoah and the royal household also have had the same honors ? and yet none of them died. And would the fact that the Israelites were standing up celebrating the first Passover have been adequate to have kept them from succumbing? Don't gasses rise?Jacobovivi uses the wall paintings in a tomb at Beni Hasan showing a seeming migration of distinctly non Egyptian peoples with non Egyptian dress and hairstyles to prove that this is evidence of Jacob and his family coming to Egypt in 1700 BC. But the inscriptions date the event to the 6th year of Sesostris II, ca. 1890 BC and are merely a caravan of Semitic traders bringing goods to Egypt for trade. He then uses mass graves of men only, near Avaris to prove the 10th plague of the first-born sons, but again, archeologists findings show that the skeletons range from 18-25 years of age and none younger and many have arrow tips imbedded in them suggesting that these were casualties of war, perhaps even Hyksos soldiers killed by the armies of Ahmose when he drove them out of Lower Egypt. Then Jacobovici goes on to postulate that along with the ""mixed company"" that left with Moses were Minoans from Avaris who may have crafted the golden Ark of the Covenant and then later sailed back to their homeland and created golden amulets accurately depicting the ark. But the Bible does not mention Minoans as being the goldsmiths who crafted the ark and the Minoans in Avaris were traders who were free to come and go at any time. There is no reason why they would have followed Moses into the Sinai for 40 years incurring the wrath of Pharoah and then return to their homeland later. Plus the amulets are not accurate depictions of the ark which had two cherubim on the lid, not two birds.And then too, one does wonder why an all creative and omnipotent God would have found it necessary to use the volcano at Santorini to destroy the entire Minoan civilization and other coastal cultures (which had no responsibility whatsoever for Israelite slavery)in order to punish Pharoah with carbon dioxide gas and tsunami's in Egypt.
