1605424,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00A2YFPXQ,a voice of reason,"[1, 1]","Reviewer John Corbett wrote the definitive review of this product, so all I want to do is add my voice to those who appreciate this great stroll down memory lane and hope that additional seasons of TWIB will be made available.I had spent the eight years prior to 1977 overseas (Army brat) and just about the only way to follow baseball at all was to buy baseball cards during the brief time that they were available at the Post Exchange each year. The 1977 season was the first season that I was truly able to follow baseball: I watched the NBC game of the week every week (loved doubleheader days), listened to every game of the 1977 Texas Rangers (their best team until 1996), and never missed This Week In Baseball. Watching these old TWIB episodes is like seeing those old baseball cards come to life and reliving part of my childhood.Due to my limited access and knowledge of MLB prior to that time, I didn't know that Mel Allen wasn't just the narrator of TWIB. For anyone who wants to hear him as a game annoncer for the Yankees, pick up a copy of the DVD of 1960's World Series Game 7 - legendary Pirates announcer Bob Prince handles the early innings and Mel Allen announces the rest. It's one of the greatest games of all-time with the game's most memorable homerun (sorry, Bobby Thomson) and two great announcers.As far as the quality of the DVD's is concerned, I had no trouble with them whatsoever - they even played perfectly on my oldest (12 years old) DVD player.",5,How About That?!,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,1479,"['Reviewer', 'John', 'Corbett', 'wrote', 'definitive', 'review', 'product', 'want', 'do', 'add', 'voice', 'who', 'appreciate', 'great', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'hope', 'additional', 'seasons', 'TWIB', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'available.I', 'had', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'prior', '1977', 'overseas', 'Army', 'brat', 'just', 'only', 'way', 'follow', 'baseball', 'was', 'buy', 'baseball', 'cards', 'brief', 'time', 'were', 'available', 'Post', 'Exchange', 'year', '1977', 'season', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'truly', 'able', 'follow', 'baseball', 'watched', 'NBC', 'game', 'week', 'week', 'loved', 'doubleheader', 'days', 'listened', 'game', '1977', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'best', 'team', '1996', 'never', 'missed', 'Week', 'Baseball', 'Watching', 'old', 'TWIB', 'seeing', 'old', 'baseball', 'cards', 'come', 'life', 'reliving', 'part', 'childhood.Due', 'limited', 'access', 'knowledge', 'MLB', 'prior', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mel', 'Allen', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'narrator', 'TWIB', 'anyone', 'who', 'hear', 'game', 'annoncer', 'Yankees', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'DVD', '1960', 'World', 'Series', 'Game', '7', 'legendary', 'Pirates', 'announcer', 'Bob', 'Prince', 'early', 'innings', 'Mel', 'Allen', 'rest', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'all-time', 'game', 'most', 'memorable', 'homerun', 'sorry', 'Bobby', 'Thomson', 'two', 'great', 'announcers.As', 'far', 'quality', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'had', 'trouble', 'even', 'played', 'perfectly', 'oldest', '12', 'years', 'old', 'DVD', 'player']",This Week in Baseball: Season 1

What memories of that season, and the players during that time!  The footage is not crystal clear (sometimes looks a bit blurry), but the content is awesome and just like I remember watching these with Mel Allen doing the narration week in and week out.  Brings back a TON of memories, and if you were someone who was in their ""teens"" or twenties during the 70's and loved baseball like I did, this is memory lane revisted!P.S.  Check out the fourth week episode in particular.  To this day, I STILL do not get tired of watching the big blowup between Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson in the dugout where Jackson half-heartedly turns a Red Sox single into a double and Martin has a coronary.

1605428,A2MI2QMF9XSG9C,B00A2YFPXQ,John Corbett,"[35, 35]","Despite the abundance of information about baseball available on the internet and on home video, there are surprisingly few ways to learn about what the cultural experience of major league baseball was actually like in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Sure, statistics are interesting, but they generally don't shed much light on the quirky characters that populate the game, exciting pennant races, broadcast technology, uniforms or ballparks of the past.Even the world series box sets, Ken Burns documentaries and blooper collections only give a hint at what it was like to follow the game in a specific year.  Not everyone followed the Yankees or the Big Red Machine.  What about fan favorites like George Scott or Richie Zisk?  How about the expansion Blue Jays or Mariners?  The summer when the Cubs and White Sox were briefly in first place at the same time?  And who really had the most unusual windup, Luis Tiant or Gene Garber?The best way to recapture the essence of the past is to experience what people followed to keep up with the game at the time.  Starting in 1977, that vehicle was This Week In Baseball.  Long before there was an internet, cable superstations or ESPN, This Week In Baseball was the principal way baseball fans could go beyond the score recaps on the nightly news or the morning paper to see what was going on around the major leagues.  If you want to learn about baseball in the late 1970s, This Week In Baseball is the best way to do it.  Indeed, as TWIB itself shows, by the middle of the 1977 season, even the players themselves were spotted watching episodes being shown on the scoreboard.  And of course, the episodes themselves are a time capsule of television style, music and technology from the late 1970s.  Many of us even remember watching specific episodes while we waited for rain-delayed ballgame telecasts to resume.MLB Productions has finally come around to understanding the immense value of its TWIB collection.  This complete first-season collection of TWIB episodes is the first of what will hopefully be a series of releases covering baseball's evolution from the multipurpose stadiums and artificial turf of the 1970s to the retro ballpark and scandal-tainted years of the 1990s.  It makes for absolutely gripping viewing.  Baseball novices will marvel at the gaudy uniforms of the 1970s and the great plays and goofs.  More devoted fans will awe at seeing forgotten players like Mike Tyson (not the boxer), Larry Biitner and Warren Cromartie in live action instead of just faded pictures on creased baseball cards.For the 1977 set, we see the season unfold week by week as the Chicago White Sox electrify Chicago, only to fall prey to the streaking Kansas City Royals.  We remember that the Yankees and Red Sox closely contested the AL East, but how many remember the Orioles, led by a young Eddie Murray, were just as much in contention?  On the North Side of Chicago, the Cubs played exciting ball, before withering to the Pirates and later the Phillies.  We get to see video of Dennis Eckersley's no hitter as a young pitcher for the Indians.  You will never see all of this together anywhere else - a 425-minute series on the 1977 season, narrated by Mel (""How 'Bout That"") Allen.As a note, this collection is on DVD-R and is manufactured on demand.  I have played it on a standard, cheap DVD player, and it worked without a hitch.  It's probably true that this collection wouldn't exist in any other form - MLB may not be willing to invest a ton of money in pre-producing a ton of traditional DVDs of an obscure series that it worries may not sell.  Let's prove those fears to be unfounded.For a baseball history buff, this is a dream come true.  I suspect a lot of other people may feel the same way.  This is an addictive box set that begs to be cotinued into 1978 and beyond.",5,An indispensible collection for baseball fans,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,3840,"['abundance', 'information', 'baseball', 'available', 'internet', 'home', 'video', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'ways', 'learn', 'what', 'cultural', 'experience', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'was', 'actually', 'late', '1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'Sure', 'statistics', 'are', 'interesting', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'shed', 'much', 'light', 'quirky', 'characters', 'populate', 'game', 'exciting', 'pennant', 'races', 'broadcast', 'technology', 'uniforms', 'ballparks', 'past.Even', 'world', 'series', 'box', 'sets', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'blooper', 'collections', 'only', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'was', 'follow', 'game', 'specific', 'year', 'Not', 'everyone', 'followed', 'Yankees', 'Big', 'Red', 'Machine', 'What', 'fan', 'favorites', 'George', 'Scott', 'Richie', 'Zisk', 'How', 'expansion', 'Blue', 'Jays', 'Mariners', 'summer', 'when', 'Cubs', 'White', 'Sox', 'were', 'briefly', 'first', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'really', 'had', 'most', 'unusual', 'windup', 'Luis', 'Tiant', 'Gene', 'Garber', 'best', 'way', 'recapture', 'essence', 'past', 'experience', 'what', 'people', 'followed', 'keep', 'up', 'game', 'time', 'Starting', '1977', 'vehicle', 'was', 'Week', 'Baseball', 'Long', 'was', 'internet', 'cable', 'superstations', 'ESPN', 'Week', 'Baseball', 'was', 'principal', 'way', 'baseball', 'fans', 'could', 'go', 'score', 'recaps', 'nightly', 'news', 'morning', 'paper', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'major', 'leagues', 'want', 'learn', 'baseball', 'late', '1970s', 'Week', 'Baseball', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'Indeed', 'TWIB', 'middle', '1977', 'season', 'even', 'players', 'were', 'spotted', 'watching', 'episodes', 'being', 'shown', 'scoreboard', 'course', 'episodes', 'are', 'time', 'capsule', 'television', 'style', 'music', 'technology', 'late', '1970s', 'Many', 'even', 'remember', 'watching', 'specific', 'episodes', 'waited', 'rain-delayed', 'ballgame', 'telecasts', 'resume.MLB', 'Productions', 'finally', 'come', 'understanding', 'immense', 'value', 'TWIB', 'collection', 'complete', 'first-season', 'collection', 'TWIB', 'episodes', 'first', 'what', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'series', 'releases', 'covering', 'baseball', 'evolution', 'multipurpose', 'stadiums', 'artificial', 'turf', '1970s', 'retro', 'ballpark', 'scandal-tainted', 'years', '1990s', 'absolutely', 'gripping', 'viewing', 'Baseball', 'novices', 'will', 'marvel', 'gaudy', 'uniforms', '1970s', 'great', 'plays', 'goofs', 'More', 'devoted', 'fans', 'will', 'awe', 'seeing', 'forgotten', 'players', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'not', 'boxer', 'Larry', 'Biitner', 'Warren', 'Cromartie', 'live', 'action', 'instead', 'just', 'faded', 'pictures', 'creased', 'baseball', '1977', 'set', 'see', 'season', 'unfold', 'week', 'week', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'electrify', 'Chicago', 'only', 'fall', 'prey', 'streaking', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Royals', 'remember', 'Yankees', 'Red', 'Sox', 'closely', 'contested', 'AL', 'East', 'how', 'many', 'remember', 'Orioles', 'led', 'young', 'Eddie', 'Murray', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'contention', 'North', 'Side', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'played', 'exciting', 'ball', 'withering', 'Pirates', 'later', 'Phillies', 'get', 'see', 'video', 'Dennis', 'Eckersley', 'hitter', 'young', 'pitcher', 'Indians', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'together', 'anywhere', 'else', '425-minute', 'series', '1977', 'season', 'narrated', 'Mel', 'How', ""'Bout"", 'Allen.As', 'note', 'collection', 'DVD-R', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'have', 'played', 'standard', 'cheap', 'DVD', 'player', 'worked', 'hitch', 'probably', 'true', 'collection', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'other', 'form', 'MLB', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'willing', 'invest', 'ton', 'money', 'pre-producing', 'ton', 'traditional', 'DVDs', 'obscure', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'sell', 'Let', 'prove', 'fears', 'be', 'unfounded.For', 'baseball', 'history', 'buff', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'suspect', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'addictive', 'box', 'set', 'begs', 'be', 'cotinued', '1978']",This Week in Baseball: Season 1

Everyone who grew up watching sports in the 80s got the benefit of watching in house productions like Steve Sabol's NFL Films or TWIB broadcasts which were a great way to catch up on highlights for the week in the pre-Sportscenter era. The real benefit of having these available season by season is that you can watch the entire thing unfold.

To me though 1987 seems like it would be an amazing season to have TWIB chronicling with the Brewers' 13-0 start,  Paul Molitor's 37 game hit streak, Juan Nieves no-hitter, the amazing rookie season of Mark McGwire, Andre Dawson and George Bell's power surge, Eric Davis' incredible 37 hr/50 sb season, Wade Boggs and Tony Gwynn knocking the cover off of the ball, standout pitching from Clemens, Ryan, Key, Saberhagen... capped off with a World Series between one of the fastest teams of the modern era, the Cardinals (Vince Coleman had 109 steals that year!) and the scrappy Twins team with Puckett, Hrbek and Viola... it was just a really amazing year.",5,Nostalgia at it's best.

I never thought that I would ever be able to see this stuff ever again.In 1977 I was 11, baseball was a major part of my life.  These guys were my heros.  It is amazingly how many Hall of Fame (classic players) played during this era.  It is amazing how much the environment at the ballpark has changed.  You see players falling out of the stands trying to get HR balls.  You see fans mob players on the field.  Love the uniforms (White Sox jerseys with collars, classic Astros, etc.) and hair styles.  Love hearing Mel Allen and watching Mark ""the Bird"" Fidrych pitch.  Still baffled by why Steve Garvey didn't get more consideration for the Hall of Fame.  He was the best player on the great Dodgers teams.  So cool watching Pete Rose, Lou Brock, Rod Carew, George Brett, Montreal Expos, etc.  Being a Detroit Tigers fan, it is great to see Ralph Houk manage some of the old players I grew up watching (Tom Veryzer, Tito Fuentes, Ben Ogilvie, Phil Mankowski, Bruce Kimm, Rusty Staub, Ron Leflore, Steve Kemp, etc) and you don't see much from the 1977 team anymore.
