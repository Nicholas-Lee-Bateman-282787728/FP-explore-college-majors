1218620,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B001MZ7L7C,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","After being pleasantly surprised withKim Kardashian: Fit In Your Jeans by Friday: Amazing Abs Body Sculpt(AABS), I was eager to try out this different workout in the series.  I definitely think that the other DVD is better, but this ""Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt"" wasn't bad at all.Like AABS, this workout isn't actually led by Kim Kardashian; she is simply a student like you.  Jennifer Galardi leads you through the various exercises and does a very good job explaining everything.  Kim also was surprisingly helpful, inserting tips that she had learned from working on these fitness moves.  The banter back and forth between Kim and Jennifer was something I enjoyed on this DVD; it made it feel like I was really in an exercise class and not just doing exercises by myself at home.If you've ever done a Jennifer Galardi workout before, don't expect her same method of working out in this video.  Usually, she's very dancey, toning ""lightly"" with bands or light hand weights; here, she is very athletic instead and tones by using compound moves, which I've never seen from her before.  I really enjoyed doing a different kind of workout with her; she is a fantastic instructor.Although the title may lead you to think that this DVD is only for the glutes, that's an incorrect assumption; you will literally work nearly every lower body muscle from your calf to your thighs, and you'll even work your abs a little bit, too.  This workout is definitely not a walk in the park, but it also isn't an extreme bootcamp class that will have your legs barely able to function by the end.  It's very doable for all fitness levels, although advanced exercisers may not be incredibly sore the next morning; I'd say that this workout isn't nearly as hard as the leg work in a Jillian Michaels DVD.The majority of the exercises are variations of lunges and squats.  Usually, there will be an upper body option (such as a shoulder press) that can include weights, if you wish to add them.  The second half of the DVD adds a step so that you will move a little bit more through each movement.Overall, while I feel like I got a better workout from AABS, I still really enjoyed this DVD and plan to do it regularly.  I think it's a great lower body workout that is tough without making me extremely sore the next morning.  I recommend to anyone looking for a good leg workout; don't let the fact that Kim Kardashian's name is on it scare you away from trying it.

The moves look deceptively easy until you are in the middle of them and just trying to catch your breath. A lot of the exercises require full-body participation. You might be working your legs and butt but you are also using hand weights and reaching above your head. I didn't have any issues with my knees or back while doing all the lunges and squats. For some reason I could do them all fairly well with a few adaptations. What I liked about this workout is how Kim gives you little tips as you go along. She helps you stay in good form while working out and stretching like a professional athlete. Jen Galardi is also excellent in this workout and keeps Kim focused on her core. Even though this workout is really challenging I felt good after I finished. If you want to work your legs and butt I can't think of a better workout.
