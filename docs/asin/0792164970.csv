If everyone posting here understood this, these posts would be a lot shorter and probably less rancorous.Pollack is a better director than Grisham is a writer.  The movie is better directed than the book is written.  The ending works for me.  I liked it.  I liked Cruise and Tripplehorn.  I liked the music.  I very much liked the entire supporting cast (this is one movie I'd add to a list of great ensemble movies).  Hackman gave one of his best performances, which is saying a lot.  Hunter and Strathairne were excellent (their last few lines together by the water were written and delivered perfectly).  Ed Harris was powerful.  Holbrook and Brimley were very good.  Brimley's little talk with Cruise over the photos was maybe the best scene in the movie, and his way with the simplest lines (&quot;I get paid to worry when there isn't anything to worry about,&quot; &quot;He's going nowhere,&quot; &quot;OK, Mitch?&quot;) is the mark of a pro.This isn't one of my favorite movies, but it does fall into another unique category--it's one of those movies I can watch almost anytime, all the way through, and enjoy it.",4,The movie (not the book),979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,1289,"[""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'opinions', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'based', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'judge', 'movie', 'book', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'book', 'everyone', 'posting', 'here', 'posts', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'shorter', 'probably', 'less', 'rancorous.Pollack', 'better', 'director', 'Grisham', 'writer', 'movie', 'better', 'directed', 'book', 'written', 'ending', 'works', 'liked', 'liked', 'Cruise', 'Tripplehorn', 'liked', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one', 'movie', ""'d"", 'add', 'list', 'great', 'ensemble', 'movies', 'Hackman', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'saying', 'lot', 'Hunter', 'Strathairne', 'were', 'excellent', 'last', 'few', 'lines', 'together', 'water', 'were', 'written', 'delivered', 'perfectly', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'was', 'powerful', 'Holbrook', 'Brimley', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Brimley', 'little', 'talk', 'Cruise', 'photos', 'was', 'maybe', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'way', 'simplest', 'lines', 'quot', 'get', 'paid', 'worry', 'when', ""n't"", 'anything', 'worry', 'quot', 'quot', 'going', 'nowhere', 'quot', 'quot', 'OK', 'Mitch', 'quot', 'mark', 'pro.This', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'fall', 'unique', 'category', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'almost', 'anytime', 'way', 'enjoy']",N/A

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 4]","I was predisposed to like this movie when it hit theatres in 1993 because it was filmed in my hometown and I worked as an extra in it.  But putting all my bias aside, the film is better than it could have been, but not as good as it should have been.  Jeanne Tripplehorn took over as Abby McDeere when a pregnant Robin Wright (Penn) dropped out, and she does well with an underwritten, stock character.  Wilford Brimley is deliciously evil, and Gene Hackman is, well, perfect as always.  Some folks balked at the different-from-the-book ending, but as director Sydney Pollack explained, the original town-to-town-chase ending would have added too much time to the film.  As for the musical score -- I was a bit taken aback by the Dave Grusin piano in what I thought would be an action/thriller genre movie.  But Pollack has used Grusin on many of his films, and soon the score grows on you.I think this was probably the best movie version of a Grisham novel.  &quot;The Client&quot; seemed kind of flat (sorry, Joel Schumacher), &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; was far from Alan Pakula's best (he did the superb &quot;Parallax View&quot; w/Warren Beatty), and &quot;John Grisham's 'The Rainmaker'&quot;, while not bad, was a step down for the masterful Francis Ford Coppola. I haven't seen &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; yet.The cast of &quot;The Firm&quot; actually did pretty well with the material given.  The book reads like a movie screenplay, but that can be a curse.  Every reader &quot;sees&quot; a different version or treatment of it in their heads as they read it, so how could the actual film ever live up to every reader's expectations?  It can't.  So the film manages to succeed in spite of all that.  Good job!

I noted that some reviewers have criticized the music, which I always thought of as being out  of place in this picture.  The two biggest problems I have with the movie  are Tom Cruise's ham-handed acting performance and an ending that strays  from that in the novel and simply is too implausible.  A previous customer  reviewer commented that Cruise's character would have been killed by the  mobsters, and I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment.  If Cruise had  been a little more restrained, and if the producers had followed Grisham's  book more faithfully, I believe that it could have been a much better movie  than the forgettable waste of time that it ended up being.",1,Implausible Ending and Overacting Ruin Grisham Novel,947462400,"01 10, 2000",2000,807,"['quot', 'Firm', 'quot', 'out', 'shining', 'example', 'why', 'one', 'should', 'read', 'novel', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'noted', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'music', 'always', 'thought', 'being', 'place', 'picture', 'two', 'biggest', 'problems', 'have', 'movie', 'are', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ham-handed', 'acting', 'performance', 'ending', 'novel', 'simply', 'too', 'implausible', 'previous', 'customer', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'Cruise', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'mobsters', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'assessment', 'Cruise', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'restrained', 'producers', 'had', 'followed', 'Grisham', 'book', 'more', 'faithfully', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'waste', 'time', 'ended', 'up', 'being']",N/A

When I read it, I remember thinking that Tom Cruise would be perfect to play Mitch, but since the story was totally butchered, it wasn't worth it to see his fine performance.  Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's SO SO SO much better  with better suspense than this pile of garbage.  It's funny to me how a lot of movies are so different than the book they supposedly are patterned after, which is an insult to the author and the viewers. This movie treats viewers like total morons.  It would be so easy to tell the story and still be true to the author.  I don't expect it to be exact, but this movie ruins so many key moments that it's not even worth explaining.
