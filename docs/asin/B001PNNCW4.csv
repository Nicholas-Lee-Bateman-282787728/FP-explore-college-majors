Known as &#34;The Queen of Suspense&#34;, Mary Higgins Clark is a &#34;master plotter&#34; who has the ability to slowly draw out the tension whether reading one of her books or watching one of her movies  making you think everyone is guilty. Her movies feature strong, independent young women who find themselves in the midst of a problem that they must solve with their own courage and intelligence. These books/movies sometimes make you think &#34;that could have happened to me, or to my daughter,&#34; to relate to the situations. I like her books/movies because she chooses not to include explicit sex or violence in her stories.",5,Love Mary Higgins Clark,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,708,"['have', 'read', 'books', 'will', 'love', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'Known', '34', 'Queen', 'Suspense', '34', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', '34', 'master', 'plotter', '34', 'who', 'ability', 'slowly', 'draw', 'out', 'tension', 'reading', 'one', 'books', 'watching', 'one', 'movies', 'making', 'think', 'everyone', 'guilty', 'movies', 'feature', 'strong', 'independent', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'midst', 'problem', 'must', 'solve', 'own', 'courage', 'intelligence', 'books/movies', 'sometimes', 'make', 'think', '34', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'daughter', '34', 'relate', 'situations', 'books/movies', 'not', 'include', 'explicit', 'sex', 'violence', 'stories']","The Mary Higgins Clark Collection - Murder, Mystery & Suspense"
