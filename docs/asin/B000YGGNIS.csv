1119719,AT1EGRXDI3NUK,B000YGGNIS,Amazon Customer,"[6, 9]","Now, I give this season 5 stars to support the show because if you've never seen Dallas before, this is a good year.  However, if you've been watching it to this point, you might find it somewhat repetitive.  Until the shocking ending, the producers were clearly trying to maintain the status quo and keep things the same since that had worked so well.  However, if you can sort of forget what happened before, you'll probably enjoy it.  Donna Reed plays Miss Ellie this year, and she is ok, just not the same.  Mandy Winger and Jamie Ewing come to town, and there is of course a big finish.  Howard Keel and Priscilla Presley get added to the main title, and the season also stars Audrey Landers, Morgan Brittany, Jared Martin as Dusty Farlow, Deborah Shelton as Mandy Winger, Jenilee Harrison as Jamie Ewing, Leigh McCloskey as Mitch Cooper, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, and Donna Reed as Ellie Ewing Farlow.  Again as a disclaimer, I am in the minority of fans in that I really love the last 5 years of the show, in particular the last 3, and don't really like this season or the dream very much, or the previous one to some extent.  I know those seasons will probably be savaged in the other reviews here while I defend them while I feel these middle ones are unfairly praised.  I did give it 5 stars, again to support the show so they'll get to my favorite years, but let it be known I pointed out they are not my favorite and there are times when I watch them when I'd rather be doing something else.",5,A Season of Dallas,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,1503,"['Now', 'give', 'season', '5', 'stars', 'support', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Dallas', 'good', 'year', 'However', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'point', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'shocking', 'ending', 'producers', 'were', 'clearly', 'trying', 'maintain', 'status', 'quo', 'keep', 'things', 'same', 'had', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'However', 'can', 'sort', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'year', 'ok', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'Mandy', 'Winger', 'Jamie', 'Ewing', 'come', 'town', 'course', 'big', 'finish', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'get', 'added', 'main', 'title', 'season', 'also', 'Audrey', 'Landers', 'Morgan', 'Brittany', 'Jared', 'Martin', 'Dusty', 'Farlow', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'Mandy', 'Winger', 'Jenilee', 'Harrison', 'Jamie', 'Ewing', 'Leigh', 'McCloskey', 'Mitch', 'Cooper', 'Dack', 'Rambo', 'Jack', 'Ewing', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Ellie', 'Ewing', 'Farlow', 'Again', 'disclaimer', 'am', 'minority', 'fans', 'really', 'love', 'last', '5', 'years', 'show', 'particular', 'last', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'season', 'dream', 'very', 'much', 'previous', 'one', 'extent', 'know', 'seasons', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'savaged', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'defend', 'feel', 'middle', 'ones', 'are', 'unfairly', 'praised', 'did', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'again', 'support', 'show', ""'ll"", 'get', 'favorite', 'years', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'favorite', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'watch', 'when', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'else']",Dallas: Season 8
1119720,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B000YGGNIS,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[12, 12]","This was another good season of ""Dallas"" that picks up where the last season set ends; Bobby's been shot and it's only a question of who did it and why. If this seems a bit familiar, it should, as 'Dallas' already did a cliffhanger about someone being shot earlier in the series. Packaging wise and quality wise, the transfer to DVD was great and the packaging is the same as the previous few seasons. Extras wise ... this area needs improvement and is part of the reason, in my opinion, this isn't a five star set. Yet again we're stuck with a pointless short feature talking about the fashion of the show which, to me, feels like we've gotten before in other sets. This was such a big season with a big event at the end of the season. Why no commentary from ANYONE? It seems like a big missed opportunity to get some insight from the cast.Another minor critique of this season was that it was longer then previous ones but little seemed to happen in each episode unlike in previous seasons. Plots felt as if they dragged on and when they were wrapped up, at times it felt rushed or over simplified. Yet, there were some changes to the show that I felt gave viewers something new to deal with. The character of Miss Ellie for this season was taken on by veteran actor Donna Reed. It felt like a reset or start-over for the character as Donna Reed took over and put her own stamp on the character. She dressed up a bit more than Barbara Bel Geddes would, she seemed more concerned with Ewing Oil and with making Clayton feel like he fit in with the Ewing clan more. Plot wise, Donna and Ray continue to have marital problems, Sue Ellen and J.R. play nice for a good portion of the season before things go back to being interesting with them dueling one another, more Ewings come into the picture and Pam and Bobby both have issues to work through. In all, though things feel slow, there's still a lot of stuff going on to keep viewers entertained.Definitely a quality t.v. series that puts many shows of today to shame.

It doesn't appear to have had the least amount of remastering done, and I shouldn't be surprised to learn that these transfers were lifted directly off of VHS tapes. That is primary, and there is really no excuse for this unless the product is barely making any profit. If that is the case, then I could also excuse the lack of commentaries and any factoids not included. If this isn't the case, Warner Bros is really treating fans like krap, which, I suppose is only to be expected by a huge corporation. Profits are important, I have to admit, which is why, I guess, any further seasons of KNOTS LANDING have been axed from the release roster.I hardly ever watched DALLAS when it originally aired, save for the finales (as I'm rather addicted to cliffhangers) but I've purchased every season on DVD so far.It's hella fun!! It's got to be said.Yes, sometimes the acting is awkwardly coquettish or OTT or unfathomably amateurish, but it often sparkles, especially when it comes to Victoria Principle's quiet demeanour exploding in either tears or rage, Patrick Duffy appears to have a gift from keeping 'the good guy' role from becoming dull (nods to the writers, too), and Ken Kercheval for being perfectly self-absorbed and idiotic with only the occasional glimpse of humanity. Donna Reed tries, but because of the new Travilla-refit, she is unable to capture the simple purity of the original Miss Ellie except for two or three scenes the entire season; fortunately, the way the rest of the cast treats her, she does manage as a place-holder for Bel Geddes. That said, Reed is really good, but she is a different Miss Ellie, just as ANY other actor who steps into another actor's shoes would be.The music keeps hitting emotional cues, for the most part.The travelogues to the Orient and the Caribbean add more dimension to the Dallas universe than the way heading to South America failed to a few seasons ago.The over-all pacing of this season is right on the money! Even tighter than last season, and with fewer inexplicable character 180s than several seasons ago (g-dammit, Sue Ellen! one week 'Never JR!' next week 'Maybe JR' then back to 'Never JR!').And then, if taken at face value, there's one of the most pathos-filled finales in soap lore.

1119728,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B000YGGNIS,HAMLET,"[0, 0]","After a shocking season ender, Season 8 picks up just where we left off, and this time, it's a doozier, sexier, more intense ride than ever. The question you want answered is resolved sooner than Who Shot J.R., but that is merely the prologue to long-lost relatives crawling out of the woodwork, a wedding, murder, separations, reunions, betrayal, a kidnapping and lawsuits. This is the most intense season of DALLAS yet, and it promises to get even better.Academy Award winner Donna Reed stepped into the role of Miss Ellie, while Barbara Bel Geddes recuperated from the surgery that caused her to miss half of season 7, and she does a very good job. After being a recurring cast member last season, Priscilla Presley is promoted to a season regular, and she also does a very good job in the role originally played by Morgan Fairchild in season 2. Newcomers Deborah Shelton and Jenilee Harrison are excellent in their respective roles (as well as being easy on the eyes). Of course, the series regulars, which now includes Howard Keel as Clayton Farlow, are excellent.Special mention goes to Charlene Tilton, Susan Howard, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Deborah Shelton, Jenilee Harrison, Academy Award winner Donna Reed and Priscilla Presley for handling their emotional scenes very well.The Storm Is Still Raging, And Slowly Stops For A Dream-Filled Season.",5,"The Most Intense Season Yet.

1119731,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000YGGNIS,Kasey G,"[4, 4]","**NOTE - This review contains SPOILERS**When we last left the Ewings, Bobby had been shot in J.R.'s office and Cliff Barnes bounced back from bankruptcy at the last minute when he struck oil in the Gulf.As a result of the shooting, Bobby is temporarily blinded. In the hospital, his recovery is almost thwarted when Katherine (Morgan Brittany channeling Glenn Close in 'Fatal Attraction') tries to inject him with poison which leads to her confessing that she pulled the trigger, and planned to frame Cliff.Priscilla Presley's lack of acting ability continues to underwhelm as Bobby's fiancee Jenna Wade (though, then 39, she looks sensational in a bikini). Duffy himself looks mighty impressive this year in his black Speedo, his physique in the best condition ever on the series. Jenna stands Bobby up at the altar and is kidnapped by her slimy ex Renaldo Marchetta who is using her annoying, whiny daughter Charlie (Shalane McCall) as leverage. It ends with murder and intrigue and Jenna in prison, with Bobby desperately trying to gather enough evidence to have her cleared. Rosemary Forsyth (""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice"") makes a few memorable appearances in this story arc.Miss Ellie returns from an extended honeymoon with Clayton (Howard Keel) a new woman--literally--as Donna Reed steps into the role vacated by Barbara Bel Geddes. It's quite jarring to see Reed and the transition takes some getting used to. She seems a little lost during her first few scenes but gets better (and more glamorous) as the season progresses. Howard Keel seems totally unfazed by the switch and actually has better chemistry with the new Miss Ellie. The producers were probably less-than-impressed as the role is slowly reduced considerably.Afton (Audrey Landers) has had enough and walks out on Cliff in the season-premiere (dressed fabulously in a get-up that would make Joan Collins proud) and Former Miss USA 1970 Deborah Shelton joins the cast as Cliff's new squeeze, fashion model Mandy Winger. When Sly (Debbie Rennard) takes a leave of absence, Cliff uses Mandy to spy on J.R. but when Mandy tires of Cliff's cheapskate ways, she jumps ship and J.R. is more than happy to spoil her. The one interesting aspect of the character is her resistance to being a kept woman or the other woman. (Her best moment comes when she yells at J.R. ""I know you're rich but I'm not for sale!""). Still, statuesque, big-eyed Shelton isn't that great an actress and I can take or leave her.The best new cast addition comes in the form of Jenilee Harrison as cousin Jamie Ewing, daughter of Jock's drifter brother Jason, who arrives from Alaska. Harrison is much better here than she was as Chrissy's klutzy cousin Cindy Snow on ""Three's Company"". Sue-Ellen takes Jamie under her wing and delights in playing dress-up and outfitting Jamie in the high-end couture befitting a Ewing. Suspicious J.R. resents Jamie and when he pushes her too hard, she drops a bomb at the annual BBQ by tossing Marylee Stone (Fern Fitzgerald) into the pool and waving a document that states both she and Cliff Barnes are entitled to 1/3 of Ewing Oil. This ignites a battle to prove exactly who owns what that lasts the remainder of the season and also introduces Dack Rambo as Jamie's estranged brother Jack Ewing. As Jamie, Harrison loses some sizzle half-way in when she gets her hair cut and marries Cliff in a small impromptu wedding. She was more interesting living at Southfork irritating J.R. by reporting his various indiscretions to Sue-Ellen.Pam walks though her own personal Twilight Zone when circumstances lead her to believe Mark Graison is still alive. She begins travelling extensively to places such as Hong Kong trying to track him down at various clinics, but learns it was a setup by J.R. to get her out of Dallas--all the while suffering in mink.Tired of being a ""poor-little-rich-girl"", Lucy (sporting tons of eye makeup this season that makes her look 10 years older) secretly takes a job at the same diner that mother Valene toiled at before moving to Knots Landing. She meets a construction worker named Eddie Cronin (Frederic Lehne) and finances a building company but Lucy has always had back luck with men, and sure enough--she gets shafted again. Things look up for her later when she reunites with Mitch in Atlanta and decides to move there and remarry him. Charlene Tilton will leave the show at the end of the season (but returns a few years later).Donna (Susan Howard) buys a small oil field and quickly starts reaping profits, which makes Ray feel inferior and causes more marriage problems for the two. They separate with Donna moving into the Southfork mansion, and later Donna discovers she's pregnant.Bobby finally realizes he can't marry Jenna when it's Pam he really loves and the two also decide to remarry. It's great to see that old spark between them return. Their happiness is short-lived when Bobby is mowed down by a car driven by the deranged Katherine (Morgan Brittany) who spent most of the season on the lam in Austria. Bobby's deathbed scene is one of the most powerful ""Dallas"" moments ever, with excellent performances by all involved.Famed designer Travilla comes on board and this season finds ""Dallas"" trying to one-up ""Dynasty"" in the fashion department. This is the era of massive shoulder pads, geometric hairdos and lots of sequins and appliqu&eacute;s. Travilla won an Emmy for his work here and it's fun to see all the excesses of the `80s in full bloom. (""Dynasty"" knocked ""Dallas"" out of the #1 spot in the Nielsen's this year and the single bonus feature is all about Travilla's work this season ""glamming up"" the series.).Perhaps the last truly great season of ""Dallas"", though Presley is still somewhat of a liability, Harrison's first appearances make up for that, and Donna Reed as Miss Ellie will grow on you. Season 8 brings some new visuals and lots of drum machines in the opening credits.Four Stars.",4,"A Year of Change For ""Dallas""",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,5937,"['**NOTE', 'review',

1119732,A2GBQRSI8FPAL,B000YGGNIS,K. O. Gibson,"[0, 0]","I'm a late `Dallas' fan, meaning I missed the first run of the series but it has become a guilty and not-so-guilty pleasure for me. I've worked my way up and just finished this season. A big-shout out also to the reviewers and major fans of this series who've posted their reviews on  Amazon for every season: you're the ones whose enthusiasm and on-the-mark reviews have helped me come back for more. I can't really add too much more than the original fans have here on this site, so here are some of my impressions in random order (no spoilers):1)Donna Reed as Miss Ellie:  The creative forces behind the show have all acknowledged that a substitute actress needed to be in place for Barbara Bel Geddes in order to keep that character as a family touchstone--and also to keep actor Howard Keel active and with a storyline. Howard Keel is a class act--that's the way for a guy to age! That being the case, I give Donna Reed her props. She was an icon from way back and while she's far more stylish and patrician than Ms. Geddes, she did her job and it can't be easy. Her portrayal takes time to mesh, but I feel she did her best. That Mrs. Reed passed away a year later is a sad forethought.2)Victoria Principal: I loved Victoria Principal as a kid from `Earthquake' and her sunny place as the sweetheart/sexy lady of this series and her many trendy hairstyles. She was popular, hot and she knew it. She delivers many strong moments in this season as she tries to make it without Bobby and give Jenna Wade her chance. By the season finale, she breaks your heart. The Bobby-Pam cliffhanger (so-to-speak) at the end of this season was a major media event at the time and a huge shock. Everyone knew Patrick Duffy was leaving the show but no one knew how his character would go. His departure and how it happens is now a pop-culture milestone and both he and Victoria Principal make it incredibly touching. Excellent work on both actors' parts.3)New cast additions of Jenilee Harrison and Deborah Shelton. Jenilee Harrison starts off as a scrappy lost relative and has a character arc that takes her from Southfork and out of the fold. It's nice to see Jenilee Harrison have more to play than the glam- screwball comedy she did so gamely on `Three's Company' two years earlier.  Deborah Shelton grows on you as the latest girlfriend of Cliff Barnes, post-Afton, and later being pursued by J.R. She's a striking presence and I thought the producers/writers did a good job in making her less one-note and actually realistic as an aspiring clothing model living on her own in a bachelorette apt. and not wanting a man to mess with her mind. Ms. Shelton gets better as the season progresses. Go Mandy!4)Priscilla Presley:  That just seven years earlier her fame was strictly as the love of Elvis's life and the keeper of his legacy, it was a huge and brave leap to star in a top-rated show as the only realistic rival for Bobby Ewing versus Victoria Principal's Pam. Priscilla is stunningly beautiful and only distracts when tearful stretches of scenes she's in yield no tears. She's a tough cookie and maybe that's why the tears don't really come. I kept wondering if menthol tears were an option. Still, for the first two-thirds of the season she's incredibly likable as the newest potential addition to Southfork.5)Travilla: The famous costume designer has some hits and misses, some of them looking quite over-the-top in hindsight---Donna Culver Krebbs (the talented Susan Howard) wearing partially backless shirts, apropos of nothing, in her basic ranch house with Ray and so on...still, it's fun to see `Dallas' stepping it up on the hair and fashion side, although comparisons to `Dynasty' still pale since `Dynasty' was uber-glam (in Denver, CO, natch) from the beginning in its depiction of estate life among the filthy rich. The commentary on this DVD season focusing on Travilla is too snarky by half but the point is made. `Dallas' did a lot for Dallas the city and they had fun crafting a fantasy image.All in all Season 8 is an enjoyable season that will have you watching an entire DVD side at a clip.

Period - end of story or at least that's how it would have made sense. Clearly this points to one of the cracks in the foundation of the format of the show: the break up of Bobby and Pam. Neither character knows what to do afterwards and subsequently wanders aimlessly until written out of the show completely.(Warning: SPOILER) This will give away the seaon's ending which is as dumb as it sounds and possibly worthy of a Batman episode.5) What about the daughter? Why is nobody looking for ""Charlie"" ? She's missing until Veronica shows up to get her $50,000 ransom. Viewers get a clear view of her license plates during the scene in Malibu which are not traced. But...we rely on Veronica's good nature to come to Dallas to testify which gets her killed which naturally just happens to be on video which just happens to reveal someone poisoning her drink and planting drug paraphanalia on her to make her look like an addict and we just happen to find this man in New York and find that he is professional hitman. Bobby pays kidnappers $50,000 ransom and the real killer's wife a hefty amount to be deposited in a Swiss bank account for his confession.  The whole story line from the beginning and the whole courtroom scenes are nonsense. We have a dead man found in a hotel room and a woman, his hostage found unconcious nearby with a gun. A guest reported the shooting but no one heard anything!!!(?)To add insult to injury, Jenna changes her mind about the wedding just in time to let Bobby get back together with Pam and just in time for Bobby to get himself killed by his sister in law (again) and to be resurrected at the end of next season.Pam's wild goose chases around the world looking for Mark Graison are also painfully dull as was the nonsense about a hand-written deed from 55 years earlier and even more monotonous is the Eddie, Lucy and Betty Lou triangle which happens when Lucy takes a job in a diner in order to meet people that like her for ""herself"" and not her ""name and money"". This, ironically turns out just the opposite from what she had planned. Clearly this is one dull, dismal disappointment from start to finish.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the season, when I started working as a teenager. It was a treat to finally get to see the entire season in its entirety.Highlights: Morgan Brittany going off in the deep end, when she finally confesses to shooting Bobby. The appearance of Donna Reed starring as Miss Ellie. Sorry, but the way she was fired from the show was wrong. Donna gave a different approach to Miss Ellie and probably would have been much better in season 9. The decision of Miss Ellie's to finally take down the portrait of Jock at Southfork to make Clayton Farlow feel more at home. The appearance of Jenilee Harrison as Jamie Ewing. Jenileeproves she has developed as an actress since she left Three's Company in 1982. The fight between Sue Ellen and Pamela Ewing at Pam's house and then,the reconcillation as the two of them both touring Hong Kong, beautiful scenary, to look for Mark Grayson. The love story of Jenna Wade and Bobby Ewing is great. However, I was disappointed when she was unable to marry Bobby due to her daughter's Charlie kidnapping. Priscilla Presley proves to be not only a beautiful lady but a gifted actress. The murder trial and the conviction makes you feel sorry for her and then finally, the decision of Bobby getting back with Pam. I always thought the two of them should have gotten married, especially since Victoria Principal ends up leaving the show two seasons from now. The return of Mitch Cooper and his remarriage to Lucy. Finally, the dream death scene of Bobby being killed and dying in the hospital. I actually started crying, when he was saying goodbye to his family. Actually, in this scene, I thought Priscilla did not do a good job when she was watching Bobby die.Personal Disappointments: The appearance of Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, conceit should have his picture in the dictionary. The boring story line of Donna and Ray fighting over Donna wanting to own her own oil company. Lucy's stint working as a waitress and finding another man to sleep with for the zillionith time. The boring story line of Deborah Shelton as Mandy Winger being woo by J.R. Ewing. Don't get me wrong Deborah Shelton is one of the most beautiful women ever on t.v. but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. The return of Sue Ellen's drinking again for the zillionith time, which may give recovered alcoholics a reason to go back to the bottle.All and all, it was hard to stop watching the dvd set.

Clayton now doesn't have a purpose on the show; she is not a patriarch; he is not a business man; he is just there.Dusty Farlow- he returns to Dallas and Sueellen asks him to be her friend and keep her from drinkingSueeellen and JR - during the first half of the season Sueellen and JR are in love.  Jamie, however, tells Sueeellen that JR is cheating on her.  Sueellen tells JR she will never have sex with him again.  JR falls in love with Mandy Winger (Cliff's current and ex-girlfriend); Sueellen starts drinking again.JR/Mandy Winger - JR feels like she is true love; she demands that Sueellen and JR get a divorce before she can devote herself to him fully.  JR decides to get Sue Ellen recommitted to a sanitariumMandy/Cliff - Cliff treated Mandy like a housemaid so she left himCliff/Jamie Barnes - Cliff decides to marry the Ewing cousin/niece so he can get her share of Ewing Oil.  When the takeover doesn't work, Cliff plots ways to get the marriage annulled.Jack Ewing - Jason Ewing's son and he acquires 10% of Ewing Oil by helping the Ewing brothers outLucy - she dates a guy that uses her for a while and then she remarries Mitch and moves to AtlantaI first watched Dallas as a child.  As an adult, these are my observations now:1. The writers had no respect for women on the show.  The women had no lives outside of the men.  Jamie Ewing even told Sue Ellen her life was boring.  Ellie was the strongest woman on the show but she had no life outside of sitting around Southfork waiting to eat. Pam was a business woman but she never conducted any business.  Donna was successful but boring because she had to cow down to Ray Krebbs, her loser husband.2. Pam and Cliff were given money solely for the purpose of fighting for Ewing Oil; they had no storylines outside of fighting for Ewing Oil3. Lucy had no storylines worth anything even though she was the cutest and youngest cast member.  A woman in her 20's should have had all types of drama in her life.  The writers clearly knew only how to write for the 40 and up cast members.Best SceneJR told John Ross to spy on his momma and John Ross looked at him like he was crazy.

1119744,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000YGGNIS,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[21, 22]","The '84-'85 season of ""Dallas"" was a pivotal one in many ways. It saw the show being somewhat overshadowed in the ratings by that ABC upstart ""Dynasty""; it was the year that Barbara Bel Geddes was replaced by Oscar/Emmy-winner Donna Reed in the role of the beloved ""Miss Ellie""; and it also saw the ""departure"" of another popular cast member at season's end. Though these developments may have been new and shocking to dedicated fans, there was enough of the old to keep 'em satisfied.J.R. (the superb Larry Hagman) is still up to his same old tricks but fids himself smitten by the new girl in town, Mandy Winger, played by Deborah Shelton. Unlike other of the oilman's conquest, Winger really appeals to J.R., not just sexually but on an ""intellectual"" level as well. He is determined to get her at all cost, including sending off-and-on spouse Sue Ellen (the magnificent Linda Gray) back to the bottle and the sanitarium.Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pam (Victoria Principal) are still in love, although Bobby is going to marry Jenna (Priscilla Presley). Pam goes on a wild-goose chase, spearheaded by you-know-who, to find beau Mark Graison (an unseen John Beck).Katherine Wentworth (Morgan Brittany) is still crazy and Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) carries on his lifelong mission to bring down Ewing Oil in honor of his ""dead daddy.""Reed brings a different take on ""Miss Ellie,"" something that didn't quite fair well with fans. However, credit must be given to the actress for stepping into a part that was so engrained in the memory of fans by Bel Geddes. It took a lot of courage for Miss Reed and she should be commended for doing an admirable job.Besides, she did look better in the Travilla clothes.Speaking of the fashion, this was the year that the producers went all out. The men, though adequately dressed, took a backseat to the glamorous attire of the ladies. In appears that every female cast member, be she main, recurrent, or having a one-shot appearance, got to wear ""the"" dress, one that really turned heads. According to the bonus feature on Travilla, the show was trying to get on the ""Dynasty"" bandwagon with the clothes. Regardless, the women look ""mah-velous,"" to borrow from Billy Crystal.The season finale, ""Swan Song,"" is, by far, the best of the season, featuring brilliant work from Duffy and Principal and an Emmy-worthy musical score by composer Lance Rubin. The final five minutes are poignant and demonstrate what the show was capable of when the writers really went to work...Now, if they just could've come up with something better for the next season's finale...but that commentary is meant for that compilation upon its release.",4,"The season of ""haute couture,"" Donna Reed, and, of course, J.R.",1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,2663,"[""'84-'85"", 'season', 'Dallas', 'was', 'pivotal', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'saw', 'show', 'being', 'somewhat', 'overshadowed', 'ratings', 'ABC', 'upstart', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'year', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'was', 'replaced', 'Oscar/Emmy-winner', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'role', 'beloved', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'also', 'saw', 'departure', 'popular', 'cast', 'member', 'season', 'end', 'developments', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'shocking', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'was', 'enough', 'old', 'keep', 'satisfied.J.R', 'superb', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'still', 'up', 'same', 'old', 'tricks', 'fids', 'smitten', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'Mandy', 'Winger', 'played', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'other', 'oilman', 'conquest', 'Winger', 'really', 'appeals', 'J.R.', 'not', 'just', 'sexually', 'intellectual', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'determined', 'get', 'cost', 'including', 'sending', 'off-and-on', 'spouse', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'magnificent', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'back', 'bottle', 'sanitarium.Bobby', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'Pam', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'are', 'still', 'love', 'Bobby', 'going', 'marry', 'Jenna', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'Pam', 'wild-goose', 'chase', 'spearheaded', 'you-know-who', 'find', 'beau', 'Mark', 'Graison', 'unseen', 'John', 'Beck', '.Katherine', 'Wentworth', 'Morgan', 'Brittany', 'still', 'crazy', 'Cliff', 'Barnes', 'Ken', 'Kercheval', 'lifelong', 'mission', 'bring', 'down', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'honor', 'dead', 'daddy', 'Reed', 'different', 'take', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fair', 'well', 'fans', 'However', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'actress', 'stepping', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'engrained', 'memory', 'fans', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'took', 'lot', 'courage', 'Miss', 'Reed', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'doing', 'admirable', 'job.Besides', 'did', 'look', 'better', 'Travilla', 'clothes.Speaking', 'fashion', 'was', 'year', 'producers', 'went', 'out', 'men', 'adequately', 'dressed', 'took', 'backseat', 'glamorous', 'attire', 'ladies', 'female', 'cast', 'member', 'be', 'main', 'recurrent', 'having', 'one-shot', 'appearance', 'got', 'wear', 'dress', 'one', 'really', 'turned', 'heads', 'According', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Travilla', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'Dynasty', 'bandwagon', 'clothes', 'Regardless', 'women', 'look', 'mah-velous', 'borrow', 'Billy', 'Crystal.The', 'season', 'finale', 'Swan', 'Song', 'far', 'best', 'season', 'featuring', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Duffy', 'Principal', 'Emmy-worthy', 'musical', 'score', 'composer', 'Lance', 'Rubin', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'poignant', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'capable', 'when', 'writers', 'really', 'went', 'work', 'Now', 'just', 'could', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'next', 'season', 'finale', 'commentary', 'meant', 'compilation', 'release']",Dallas: Season 8

Except bel geddes (who was sick and was replaced by donna reed just for this season) all other actors are here plus the beautiful priscilla who appears also in the beginning credits for the first time plus a few newcomers like jamie and jack the long lost...cousins of the ewings.Next season is the dream season in which lucy is gone and of-course bobby is considered dead so the last season which we can say has almost all the original cast is the 10nth season (86-87) in which bobby returns and also bel geddes is back on the show (from the previous dream season) and from the original cast ONLY lucy is absent so we can say the 10nth season IS THE REAL LAST DALLAS SEASON also because from there the show started to decline in the next final 4 seasons. In season 11 pam and donna left the show. In season 12 ray and the beautiful priscilla also left the show and in season 13 sue ellen and bel geddes did the same. In season 14 the final season ONLY bobby and JR left from the original cast with a few appearences from clayton but this was not enough to save the show. Dallas was not the same show after the 10nth or the 11nth season at the most BUT this season we are talking about (the 8th) is great and not to miss.Bobby and priscilla are GREAT TOGETHER and didn't got married because of jenna's past (naldo) and not because bobby loved pam. Now let me get this straight. Bobby and pam were the perfect couple and always loved each other but this was UNTIL priscilla came in season 7. Watching bobby and priscilla together was like watching romeo and juliet together. Anyways the writers decided that bobby should be with pam and that's that but i will never forget PATRICK DUFFY and PRISCILLA PRESLEY TOGETHER. They seemed as a real couple. The only other woman i liked with bobby was April.Anyways, this season has it all. plots, scemes, loves and betrayals so ALL LOYAL DALLAS FANS OUT THERE DO NOT MISS THIS SEASON.
