371920,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6303394043,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[14, 17]","Only the third movie of Tom Hanks' illustrious career, The Man With One Red Shoe is a hilarious comedy about a case of mistaken identity. With a star studded cast that includes not only Hanks, but also Dabney Coleman, James Belushi, and Carrie Fisher, The Man With One Red Shoe is a decent slapstick comedy that appears on cable television from time to time. Not exactly the greatest film in history, it is a fun and entertaining movie well worth the time involved...When top level CIA operatives Cooper (Dabney Coleman) and Ross (Charles Durning) fight out a personal turf battle, Ross sends Cooper on a wild goose chase to find a fictional witness who can clear his name of some impending charges. Using planted information from a wire tap, Cooper stakes out the local airport in an effort to find the mysterious man...Meanwhile, Richard (Tom Hanks) is wearing mismatched shoes (one of them red, thus The Man With One Red Shoe) because his friend Morris (James Belushi) played a practical joke on him. But the joke takes an odd twist when a CIA agent spies Richard's odd shoe pairing and fingers him as the target of their stakeout. In an effort to find out what the man with one red shoe knows, Cooper puts a tail on Richard, sparking a strange sequence of events which leaves the bike-riding violin player questioning his sanity.But the snafu really turns serious when Cooper assigns top agent Maddy (Lori Singer) to the case. Maddy gets close to Richard (who easily falls in love with her). Cooper thinks he's getting closer to the information he needs when the unthinkable occurs - his top agent falls for Richard...Tom Hanks plays the lead role to the best of his ability, playing the part of a character type he has totally mastered - the clueless, out-of-the-loop guy. He played similar roles in Big and Forrest Gump, but irrespective of those roles, Hanks is generally outstanding in any role which he's assigned. The Man With One Red Shoe is no exception. Hanks comes across as a genuine and likeable character, totally oblivious to the events which transpire around him.Based solely on a case of mistaken identity, The Man With One Red Shoe is an interesting concept for a film. Despite stretching the limits of reality, the film nevertheless manages to remains within the boundaries of the sane and normal. The movie isn't over the top or utterly ridiculous like so many comedies of today. Instead, the lead characters remain serious while the circumstances of their situation provide the humor. A light-hearted and fun film, providing an early glimpse of Tom Hanks' much heralded career, makes The Man With One Red Shoe a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",3,"A somewhat unknown, but charming comedy...",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2676,"['Only', 'third', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'illustrious', 'career', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'not', 'only', 'Hanks', 'also', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'James', 'Belushi', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'decent', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'cable', 'television', 'time', 'time', 'Not', 'exactly', 'greatest', 'film', 'history', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'involved', 'When', 'top', 'level', 'CIA', 'Cooper', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Ross', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'fight', 'out', 'personal', 'turf', 'battle', 'Ross', 'Cooper', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'find', 'fictional', 'witness', 'who', 'can', 'clear', 'name', 'impending', 'charges', 'Using', 'planted', 'information', 'wire', 'tap', 'Cooper', 'out', 'local', 'airport', 'effort', 'find', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Meanwhile', 'Richard', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'wearing', 'mismatched', 'shoes', 'one', 'red', 'thus', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'friend', 'Morris', 'James', 'Belushi', 'played', 'practical', 'joke', 'joke', 'odd', 'twist', 'when', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Richard', 'odd', 'shoe', 'pairing', 'fingers', 'target', 'stakeout', 'effort', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'man', 'one', 'red', 'shoe', 'knows', 'Cooper', 'tail', 'Richard', 'sparking', 'strange', 'sequence', 'events', 'bike-riding', 'violin', 'player', 'questioning', 'sanity.But', 'snafu', 'really', 'serious', 'when', 'Cooper', 'top', 'agent', 'Maddy', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'case', 'Maddy', 'close', 'Richard', 'who', 'easily', 'love', 'Cooper', 'getting', 'closer', 'information', 'when', 'unthinkable', 'top', 'agent', 'Richard', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'lead', 'role', 'best', 'ability', 'playing', 'part', 'character', 'type', 'totally', 'mastered', 'clueless', 'out-of-the-loop', 'guy', 'played', 'similar', 'roles', 'Big', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'irrespective', 'roles', 'Hanks', 'generally', 'outstanding', 'role', 'assigned', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'exception', 'Hanks', 'across', 'genuine', 'likeable', 'character', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'events', 'transpire', 'him.Based', 'solely', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'interesting', 'concept', 'film', 'stretching', 'limits', 'reality', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'remains', 'boundaries', 'sane', 'normal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'top', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'many', 'comedies', 'today', 'Instead', 'lead', 'characters', 'remain', 'serious', 'circumstances', 'situation', 'humor', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'film', 'providing', 'early', 'glimpse', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'much', 'heralded', 'career', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",The Man with One Red Shoe VHS

If I were just rating the cast members, I'd give it 5 stars for sure.  But Lori Singer does not pull off her role convincingly.  She tries too hard to ""act"" her part, and it just seems forced.  And, even though I LOVE Tom Hanks, his ability to fake play the violin is bad enough to be painful! lol... The story is alright, but there are some terrible scenes that are so bad that you can't even find the humor in them.  It does have it's funny moments, though, and if you can follow the sometimes-confusing story line, it is a pretty good movie over all.  Tom Hanks' character reminds me of him in Splash but with a different story.  When he's screaming for Maddy, he sounded exactly like he did in Splash when he was screaming for Madison.So, basically it's a great cast with a so-so story line, but it's probably one I'd watch again.  It's nothing too heavy, which is nice once in awhile.  And I loved seeing David Ogden Stiers in his small role.  He always amazes me in anything I've ever seen him in.  Same with Edward Herrmann and Tom Noonan.  It certainly could have been much better with such a great cast, although I have to say that Carrie Fisher's character got on my nerves, which was probably her intention, so her part was well acted, too.

One group sets the other up by claiming they have a spy/mole with some important information and that he's coming in on a certain plane.  They leak the information by deliberately talking into the bugs they found planted by the other team.  There is no one, but when part of their team goes to the airport, with the other team sets up with their men there to discover who the informant is, the team that has put the plan in motion, randomly picks out an unsuspecting passenger getting off a plane who just happens to be wearing one red shoe, which is Tom Hanks.  They pretend to make contact and then, Tom Hanks, completely unaware of anything unusual is now under surveilence.Tom Hanks is a musician who travels to different countries playing with a concert.  He and his friend and his friend's wife (who has the hots for him) have just returned from one of his trips.He is tracked and followed by both teams, one to spy on him and the other to try and protect him, his place is turned upside down, a beautiful agent is sent to get close to him, his friend's wife is hitting on him, wanting him to go to bed with him.  She likes to play Tarzan in bed and makes some wild noises, which is recorded by Dabney's team and later heard by the wife's husband as they play the recording in their van and he thinks she's in it, and so on...  You get the picture.  Lot of things going on all the time.  The whole time Tom Hanks is completely unaware of any of this and is falling for the beautiful blond.  Not a whole lot of depth, but a fun little movie and actually has parts in it that are quite believable in this day and age.

Macek,"[6, 11]","I had high hopes for this one when it was released; the original French movie 'The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe' is one of my favorite comedies, and hey, who doesn't like Tom Hanks?But this remake is streets apart from that - for all the mayhem in the common plot of intelligence intrigue and unwitting decoys, the remake plays it lots meaner and uglier than the original...and then is downright prudish on the sexual angles that made the original a pleasing adult comedy.Maybe if you never saw the original you can like or tolerate this one.
