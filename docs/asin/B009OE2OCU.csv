1601056,A2NSV2TIMA9EMT,B009OE2OCU,Alina Hernandez,"[2, 2]","Even though the package on the DVD indicated that this was the Complete Season One of Heat of the Night ...that isn't the case.  Due to some copyright issues ...a few of the episodes for Season one was not included ...so for a two-parter story line - you'd only get the first episode but wouldn't know the ending of the second episode because that would be the one that had copyright issues.That being said ...I always loved the series.  It brought back thoughts of a happier time and simpler time when we would rush home - so as not to miss an episode of this tv program.  I loved seeing the clothes of the times and the sense of honor in the character of Chief Gallispie and of course, the series would be what it was if it wasn't for Virgil and Bubba (who I had a big crush on - and still kinda of do).  While not really complete as the packaging says - it's still great to have it as part of my DVD collection.I think it would be more helpful if there was a disclaimer on the box saying that some of the episodes are missing due to copywrite law/issues ...this way people don't fee cheated.  True fans know when a season's series isn't complete ...we do remember the episodes we watch - after all.Of course - this didn't stop me from buying the complete eight seasons ...with TV at it's lowest point today - it's great to kick back and pop in Heat of the Night episode.",5,Season One - Heat of the Night,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1373,"['Even', 'package', 'DVD', 'indicated', 'was', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One', 'Heat', 'Night', ""n't"", 'case', 'Due', 'copyright', 'issues', 'few', 'episodes', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'so', 'two-parter', 'story', 'line', ""'d"", 'only', 'get', 'first', 'episode', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'ending', 'second', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'had', 'copyright', 'issues.That', 'being', 'said', 'always', 'loved', 'series', 'brought', 'back', 'thoughts', 'happier', 'time', 'simpler', 'time', 'when', 'would', 'rush', 'home', 'so', 'not', 'miss', 'episode', 'tv', 'program', 'loved', 'seeing', 'clothes', 'times', 'sense', 'honor', 'character', 'Chief', 'Gallispie', 'course', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'Virgil', 'Bubba', 'who', 'had', 'big', 'crush', 'still', 'kinda', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'complete', 'packaging', 'still', 'great', 'have', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection.I', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'helpful', 'was', 'disclaimer', 'box', 'saying', 'episodes', 'are', 'missing', 'due', 'copywrite', 'law/issues', 'way', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'fee', 'cheated', 'True', 'fans', 'know', 'when', 'season', 'series', ""n't"", 'complete', 'do', 'remember', 'episodes', 'watch', 'all.Of', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'buying', 'complete', 'eight', 'seasons', 'TV', 'lowest', 'point', 'today', 'great', 'kick', 'back', 'pop', 'Heat', 'Night', 'episode']",In the Heat of the Night: The Complete Season One
