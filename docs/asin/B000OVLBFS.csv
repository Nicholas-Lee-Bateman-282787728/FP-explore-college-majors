1065803,AE23DYT0RDFUV,B000OVLBFS,Brian Ridgway,"[0, 0]","THANK YOU for checking out my reviews. I recently have been looking into Tom Selleck's catalog of projects and have been pleased with the results. I am not a reader of the JS book series, so I had no idea what to expect. But after recently watching a Jesse Stone feature on CBC in 2009, I realized this was a series, and decided to go back and explore this product from the beginning. While 'NIGHT PASSAGE' is described as the official 'prequel' to the first JS movie and sets everything up (and is really a LOUSY title, so DON'T be deceived!), it wastes no time in pulling viewers into the characters world. Excellent production values, beautiful photography and exceptional acting compensate for what seem to be standard crime-noir thrillers where only slight surprises occur. The casts and characters in these stories seem to be limited, so by the end, it isn't too hard to figure out where the story is headed. But expect a small surprise or two with each chapter, as well as finely detailed character development and dialogue. Tom Selleck does an excellent SLOW BURN characterization here - unlike anything he's done so far in his varied career. The JESSE STONE series looks to be an exception adult modern-day alternative to the classic detective films of the 1940's and 1950's. They are the perfect compliment to a busy week, and make thoroughly entertaining viewing on a quiet Sunday afternoon or evening. Intelligent, thoughtful, moody and at times dryly funny, TOM SELLECK SCORES with this unique series. And at only $10. a title (sometimes even LESS!) these are great additions to your home DVD series.",4,A Terrific Start to a prime TOM SELLECK Detective Series,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,1613,"['THANK', 'YOU', 'checking', 'out', 'reviews', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'catalog', 'projects', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'results', 'am', 'not', 'reader', 'JS', 'book', 'series', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'recently', 'watching', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'feature', 'CBC', '2009', 'realized', 'was', 'series', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'explore', 'product', 'beginning', ""'NIGHT"", 'PASSAGE', 'described', 'official', ""'prequel"", 'first', 'JS', 'movie', 'sets', 'everything', 'up', 'really', 'LOUSY', 'title', 'so', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'be', 'deceived', 'time', 'pulling', 'viewers', 'characters', 'world', 'Excellent', 'production', 'values', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'compensate', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'standard', 'crime-noir', 'thrillers', 'where', 'only', 'slight', 'surprises', 'occur', 'casts', 'characters', 'stories', 'seem', 'be', 'limited', 'so', 'end', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'story', 'headed', 'expect', 'small', 'surprise', 'two', 'chapter', 'as', 'well', 'finely', 'detailed', 'character', 'development', 'dialogue', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'excellent', 'SLOW', 'BURN', 'characterization', 'here', 'anything', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'varied', 'career', 'JESSE', 'STONE', 'series', 'be', 'exception', 'adult', 'modern-day', 'alternative', 'classic', 'detective', 'films', '1940', '1950', 'are', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'busy', 'week', 'make', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'quiet', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'Intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'moody', 'times', 'dryly', 'funny', 'TOM', 'SELLECK', 'SCORES', 'unique', 'series', 'only', '10', 'title', 'sometimes', 'even', 'LESS', 'are', 'great', 'additions', 'home', 'DVD', 'series']",Jesse Stone: Night Passage

The back story of him being fired because he drank on the job shows he has a murky past. Him driving to Paradise, and us getting a chance to see character development, is good. He finds some suspicious events tied to the previous sheriff of Paradise, and a good lead as to why the sheriff is retiring early. When he handles a case of a battered wife, he finds the husband is hiding something. If that isn't enough, Jesse's dog Boomer has failing health. It is handled with a sensitive touch. Especially if you have been through it. If you enjoy this be sure to catch the other two movies ""Stone Cold"" and ""Death in Paradise"" based on Robert Parker books. You may like ""An Innocent Man"" as well. It is a drama with Selleck being falsely accused of a crime and then being sent to prison. Tom Selleck is a great actor.

His quiet but effect techniques do not make him the most popular chief of police with the town council as he continues to drink and spiral downward into depression.

We don't get anything like a story until nearly the very end, when Stone stumbles across the money-laundering scheme. Of course, part of the reason everything is so slow is that the filmmakers jettisoned the biggest part of Robert B. Parker's plotline. The money laundering is strictly secondary in the book. It's as if they did ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" without the mutiny. On the plus side, Selleck is excellent, and so is the rest of the cast, but they are torpedoed by the molasses-in-January pace and excess atmospherics.

Although Chief Stone's character is consistent throughout the series, his and the other characters' life experiences and sometimes just personal ruminations through time that we see in the stories cause these characters to mold and change consistent with their basic personalities. Even a character such as Hasty shows growth as a result of his experiences as a criminal, and one see's that his appreciation of Stone's character reflected off his own experience has changed from a simplistic burnt out drunken big city cop to a genuine appreciation of Stones fundamental morality and strength of character that keeps him going regardless of the disasters in his life and his personal weakness for Scotch whiskey.
