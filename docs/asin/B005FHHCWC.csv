1457840,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B005FHHCWC,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 2]","A lot of people tend to underestimate Weird Al. While his parodies are massively popular due to him taking the parody to professional levels. But, he has always had great original songs on his albums as well. For a comedian, he really takes music seriously. In this day and age of Britney Spears and other artists that are supposedly more ""respected"" where half their shows or more are lip synched it's great to see someone put on a show that's both entertaining and high spirited, yet totally pure. His performances are just as good if not better than his non-comedic counterparts. His performance is well choreographed and high spirited and keeps everyone on their feet. He knows how to work an audience. Weird Al's Videos  have always been great. A work of art unto themselves. They never get tiresome on repeated viewings due to the fact that you seem to always find something new. And he puts that same level of quality towards his live performances. He's the best in his field, taking pride in his craft as so few artists today can claim. Sometimes you might find his parodies sounding better than their source material. I also have the Weird Al Live! dvd (I'd purchase it again if it ended up on blu ray) and that one is great to watch too. The extras are nice, a few added performances, two music videos (Polka Face and born this way) and some interesting youtube clips. (though it's nice to have, they are rather short, but they are interesting in a weird way) I'd love to have more extras. but that's the greedy side of me. It would have been great that instead of releasing the videos for the album on a seperate blu ray to include it here. I have the cd/dvd combo, and except for born this way and Polka face everything else is the same as the blu ray. But personally I think they should have combined the two seperate blu rays into one rather than seperate, the price is fair though, so it's not that big of a deal and not big enough of a deal to take this down any stars. I'd recommend this to everyone who loves a great concert film and who loves comedy or Weird Al. It's more or less something everyone in the family can enjoy (except for a scene involving Santa) and the inclusion of the Canadian Chapter of the 501st for the two Star Wars related songs for the finale is a nice touch. Weird Al isn't bad for your kids like current artists might be, but at the same time he's no Mister Rogers so there should be (and always should be in anything) a certain amount of parental guidance. Overally it's a highly enjoyable  performance. You'll love it as much as I did.",5,Spectacular perormance,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,2582,"['lot', 'people', 'tend', 'underestimate', 'Weird', 'Al', 'parodies', 'are', 'massively', 'popular', 'due', 'taking', 'parody', 'professional', 'levels', 'always', 'had', 'great', 'original', 'songs', 'albums', 'as', 'well', 'comedian', 'really', 'music', 'seriously', 'day', 'age', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'other', 'artists', 'are', 'supposedly', 'more', 'respected', 'where', 'shows', 'more', 'are', 'lip', 'synched', 'great', 'see', 'someone', 'put', 'show', 'entertaining', 'high', 'spirited', 'yet', 'totally', 'pure', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'non-comedic', 'counterparts', 'performance', 'well', 'choreographed', 'high', 'spirited', 'everyone', 'feet', 'how', 'work', 'audience', 'Weird', 'Al', 'Videos', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'unto', 'never', 'get', 'tiresome', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'due', 'fact', 'seem', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'towards', 'live', 'performances', 'best', 'field', 'taking', 'pride', 'craft', 'so', 'few', 'artists', 'today', 'can', 'claim', 'Sometimes', 'might', 'find', 'parodies', 'sounding', 'better', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'have', 'Weird', 'Al', 'Live', 'dvd', ""'d"", 'purchase', 'again', 'ended', 'up', 'blu', 'ray', 'one', 'great', 'watch', 'too', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'few', 'added', 'performances', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'Polka', 'Face', 'born', 'way', 'interesting', 'youtube', 'clips', 'nice', 'have', 'are', 'rather', 'short', 'are', 'interesting', 'weird', 'way', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'more', 'extras', 'greedy', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'instead', 'releasing', 'videos', 'album', 'seperate', 'blu', 'ray', 'include', 'here', 'have', 'cd/dvd', 'combo', 'born', 'way', 'Polka', 'face', 'everything', 'else', 'same', 'blu', 'ray', 'personally', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'combined', 'two', 'seperate', 'blu', 'one', 'rather', 'seperate', 'price', 'fair', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'not', 'big', 'enough', 'deal', 'take', 'down', 'stars', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'everyone', 'who', 'great', 'concert', 'film', 'who', 'comedy', 'Weird', 'Al', 'more', 'less', 'something', 'everyone', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'involving', 'Santa', 'inclusion', 'Canadian', 'Chapter', '501st', 'two', 'Star', 'Wars', 'related', 'songs', 'finale', 'nice', 'touch', 'Weird', 'Al', ""n't"", 'bad', 'kids', 'current', 'artists', 'might', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'always', 'should', 'be', 'anything', 'certain', 'amount', 'parental', 'guidance', 'Overally', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'love', 'as', 'much', 'did']","""Weird Al"" Yankovic Live! - The Alpocalypse Tour"

1457845,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B005FHHCWC,GratedTopping,"[29, 35]","I saw Al in concert in Florida a few days ago and it was fantastic. However, I wasn't that pleased with this DVD.I feel that I would have enjoyed it more if it had an 'in-the-audience' view. The close-ups were okay, but I wanted to feel like I was sitting right there (but at a high-enough level to not have anybody in the way, of course). I'd wanted to have seen the audience more and be enough rows back to get Al...the band...and the screens that were above and behind the stage all at the same time. Of course, when Al went into the audience, that would have been a time to follow him closer.Frank's 2000-inch TV was played during the concert I saw, but it wasn't in this lineup. However, it is in an extra on the DVD. He doesn't do every tune in each concert but, for the most part, they are all identical.A couple differences I recall from the concert:- on the DVD, you'll see two effeminate guy-dancers during the ""Perform This Way"" number; they were not in the concert I was at- I remember two moments when Al was presenting the drummer, John ""Bermuda"" Schwartz, with a drum solo. Each time, it was just a second or two of a 'tune' and it was funny to see him all proud of his achievement. It was silly and the audience was all ready for a big solo that never happened. This isn't on the DVD. UPDATE: it's in one of the extra live performancesI was really hoping that, with the DVD, it wouldn't just be one song after another. I saw a cut-down, one-hour version of the concert on Comedy Central. During the concert, there were a lot of costume changes throughout the performance. During those moments, there were great ""Al TV"" segments and other bits. For example, he had mock interviews with Robert Plant or Eminem and they were great. Also, there were silly parts from his ""UHF"" movie...other flicks (like from the first ""Naked Gun"" movie)...and mentions of him in various TV shows. To me, these were some of the best parts of the concert that had me cracking up and I was so disappointed they were not on the DVD. I wanted to see the full thing!Ultimately, I liked seeing the concert on DVD, of course -- but it turned out that it was the stuff in between the songs that had a major impact on the enjoyment. It got me to laugh a lot, and the audience was cracking-up as well. This also built up anticipation for the next song.This DVD loses a star for me. Al's great and it's good to have, but I recommend seeing this truly live for a better experience.",4,wish it was more complete...,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,2464,"['saw', 'Al', 'concert', 'Florida', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'was', 'fantastic', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'DVD.I', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'had', ""'in-the-audience"", 'view', 'close-ups', 'were', 'okay', 'wanted', 'feel', 'was', 'sitting', 'right', 'there', 'high-enough', 'level', 'not', 'have', 'anybody', 'way', 'course', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'have', 'seen', 'audience', 'more', 'be', 'enough', 'rows', 'back', 'get', 'Al', 'band', 'screens', 'were', 'stage', 'same', 'time', 'course', 'when', 'Al', 'went', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'follow', 'closer.Frank', '2000-inch', 'TV', 'was', 'played', 'concert', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'lineup', 'However', 'extra', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'do', 'tune', 'concert', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'identical.A', 'couple', 'differences', 'recall', 'concert', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'see', 'two', 'effeminate', 'guy-dancers', 'Perform', 'Way', 'number', 'were', 'not', 'concert', 'was', 'at-', 'remember', 'two', 'moments', 'when', 'Al', 'was', 'presenting', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bermuda', 'Schwartz', 'drum', 'solo', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'second', 'two', ""'tune"", 'was', 'funny', 'see', 'proud', 'achievement', 'was', 'silly', 'audience', 'was', 'ready', 'big', 'solo', 'never', 'happened', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'UPDATE', 'one', 'extra', 'live', 'performancesI', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'one', 'song', 'saw', 'cut-down', 'one-hour', 'version', 'concert', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'concert', 'were', 'lot', 'costume', 'changes', 'performance', 'moments', 'were', 'great', 'Al', 'TV', 'segments', 'other', 'bits', 'example', 'had', 'mock', 'interviews', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'Eminem', 'were', 'great', 'Also', 'were', 'silly', 'parts', 'UHF', 'movie', 'other', 'flicks', 'first', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movie', 'mentions', 'various', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'best', 'parts', 'concert', 'had', 'cracking', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'were', 'not', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'see', 'full', 'thing', 'Ultimately', 'liked', 'seeing', 'concert', 'DVD', 'course', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'stuff', 'songs', 'had', 'major', 'impact', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'laugh', 'lot', 'audience', 'was', 'cracking-up', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'built', 'up', 'anticipation', 'next', 'song.This', 'DVD', 'star', 'Al', 'great', 'good', 'have', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'truly', 'live', 'better', 'experience']","""Weird Al"" Yankovic Live! - The Alpocalypse Tour"

1457849,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B005FHHCWC,Peter Tsang,"[10, 12]","""'Weird Al' Yankovic Live! The Alpocalypse Tour,"" blu-ray is an unusual comedic show done in parody in regard to song and performance.  Sometimes, I know  what Mr. Yankovic is parodying, but other times, I have to think, ""what is he imitating and making of?"".  I recognize the melodies, but not the original songs.There is an option to display all the lyrics to the songs on the featured concert.  The lyrics are well thought out and finely composed.  Some of the lyrics may be mildly offensive to a few people and the act is, occasionally, a little lewd, but within the limits of most people.  Some may not like the one scene where he dances suggestively in front of a lady. It has a Canadian Home Video Rating of PG (which is the same as a PG rating in the United States).  There is no foul language.  I found much of the show amusing and entertaining.The show includes a large backscreen, showing cartoons and videos.I especially like the ""Polka Face"" mash, ""Canadian Idiot"" which parodies Green Day's ""American Idiot,"" the ""Medley"" mix, and ""Amish Paradise"".  I would like to point out that Mr. Yankovic actually has a fine voice and that his acts are carefully crafted with skill and talent.The track list from the concert follows.Polka FaceTMZSmells Like NirvanaSkipper DanParty in the CIACNRLet Me Be Your HogCanadian IdiotWanna B Ur LovrMedley: Money for Nothing, Beverly Hillbillies, Whatever You Like, Another Tattoo, eBay, I Want a New Duck, Theme from Rocky XIII, Spam, My Bologna, Ode to a Superhero, Lasagna, Eat ItAmish ParadiseCraigslistPerform This WayWhite & NerdyFatThe Saga BeginsYodaThe concert is one hour and 25 minutes.
