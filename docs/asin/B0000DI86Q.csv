Britten's music has the dark orchestration of Verdi, the lushness of Puccini, but he brings it all together into his own unique and thoroughly modern sound. John Vickers is sometimes painful to watch, so deeply does he invoke the tormented soul-searching of the title character. Perhaps no opera since Otello(with the exception perhaps of Strauss' Elektra and Berg's Wozzeck) has captured alienation so well, but Peter Grimes is even more alone than Verdi's title character. Like Otello, as well as Elektra and Wozzeck, Grimes is unsympathetic in a lot of ways, but that's what makes him human, and we feel for him just the same. This production is just exquisite.",5,Peter Grimes,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,765,"['was', 'incredibly', 'moved', 'DVD', 'Peter', 'Grimes', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'operas', 'Britten', 'music', 'dark', 'orchestration', 'Verdi', 'lushness', 'Puccini', 'together', 'own', 'unique', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'sound', 'John', 'Vickers', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'watch', 'so', 'deeply', 'invoke', 'tormented', 'soul-searching', 'title', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'opera', 'Otello', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Strauss', 'Elektra', 'Berg', 'Wozzeck', 'captured', 'alienation', 'so', 'well', 'Peter', 'Grimes', 'even', 'more', 'alone', 'Verdi', 'title', 'character', 'Otello', 'as', 'well', 'Elektra', 'Wozzeck', 'Grimes', 'unsympathetic', 'lot', 'ways', 'what', 'human', 'feel', 'just', 'same', 'production', 'just', 'exquisite']","Britten - Peter Grimes / Davis, Vickers, Harper, Bailey, Royal Opera Covent Garden"

The staging is austere but very effective. The singing is excellent right down to the smallest rolls. And Vickers owns the role of Peter Grimes  probably for ever. Granted his voice is not to everyone's taste but we can say this about any major singer. Colin Davis does great by the orchestra and everyone is in stride with the drama of the piece. I hoped this doens't become an underated and under appreciated performance. It deserves much more. This dvd belongs in every one's collection  even if they don't like mid twentieth century opera.

And this opera is probably the most accessible of all Britten's works - in other words, a good place to start.  In my opinion, it's an unforgettable experience, one that only grows on you with rehearing.It's a grim story of a fisherman ill at ease with others.  He's lost an apprentice at sea and is suspected of having physcally abused the boy.  While one woman, Ellen Orford, tries to be his friend, the village gives him no room in their busy, opinionated, suspicious world.  He is a monster, unwelcome in their tight little society, a creature to be feared and shunned. When Grimes acquires a new apprentice we know the results will be tragic.In this recording, the title role is portrayed by Jon Vickers who made this one of his personal triumphs.  To see it as well as hear the magnificent singing more than doubles the satisfaction of the performance.I remember hearing the premiere radio broadcast of this piece from the Met when I was a teenager - I'm in my 70's now.  Even then its strange story mesmerized me.  Now, after many hearings, it is a joy to finally see what my imagination could not conjure up.This performance is intense, focused, brooding, in every way ""seaworthy"" for anyone who turns to opera for a musical experience that is both beautiful and terrible.

Jon Vickers is, to my taste, the finest tenor I have ever heard and his portrayal in this opera is one of his greatest performances.  I have seen him (live) in the opera on five occasions and only wish that I could have seen him perform it even more.  It is true, as another reviewer noted, that Britten himself didn't like Vickers' interpretation (Vickers being a much different type of singer than Peter Pears for whom Britten wrote the opera) and Vickers has changed a bit of the text in the second act scene in his hut.  But, with all due respect to the genius of Britten, I think Vickers' interpretation (and his text changes) are definitely for the better.  Vickers makes Peter Grimes more fearsome than Pears did (at least comparing recordings, I never saw Pears perform the opera) but in Crabbe's original poem, Grimes is a pretty fearsome person.",5,"Great Opera, Great Tenor",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,961,"['Peter', 'Grimes', 'one', 'desert', 'island', 'time', 'favorite', 'operas', 'incredible', 'piece', 'music', 'Jon', 'Vickers', 'taste', 'finest', 'tenor', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'portrayal', 'opera', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'opera', 'five', 'occasions', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'perform', 'even', 'more', 'true', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Britten', 'did', ""n't"", 'Vickers', 'interpretation', 'Vickers', 'being', 'much', 'different', 'type', 'singer', 'Peter', 'Pears', 'whom', 'Britten', 'wrote', 'opera', 'Vickers', 'changed', 'bit', 'text', 'second', 'act', 'scene', 'hut', 'due', 'respect', 'genius', 'Britten', 'think', 'Vickers', 'interpretation', 'text', 'changes', 'are', 'definitely', 'better', 'Vickers', 'Peter', 'Grimes', 'more', 'fearsome', 'Pears', 'did', 'least', 'comparing', 'recordings', 'never', 'saw', 'Pears', 'perform', 'opera', 'Crabbe', 'original', 'poem', 'Grimes', 'pretty', 'fearsome', 'person']","Britten - Peter Grimes / Davis, Vickers, Harper, Bailey, Royal Opera Covent Garden"
778692,AMVLSBP59YGNG,B0000DI86Q,"Robert Baksa ""composer""","[5, 19]","There is much that is engaging in the production, staging and singing are consistanly on a high level.  Davis is a marvelous conductor and his singers seem to embody the characters they portray.  But having known this opera rather well for nearly 40 years, I find myself less and less convinced that it is a great work.  It is certainly an effective dramatic vehicle and contains some of Britten's most striking music.  Unfortunately, most of that is in the orchestral interludes.  The vocal music, solos and ensembles suffer from a lack of direction except when Britten uses a short repeated phrase.  The libretto itself contains much very awkward writing and Britten seems to choose the most awkward way of setting it.  Many of the lines are directionless, shapeless and contrary to the shape needed to give the intended meaning to the text.  He also introduces meaningless melismas at the most inopportune times.  Since Britten was not a great melodist but rather an orchestral colorist his vocal lines do not become more natural with familiarity.  They seem to become more forced and unnatural.  This is particularily strange considering the composers prominance in the world of 20th century opera.  One suspects that his reputation might fade as time goes on.  Unquestionably a brilliant man, his work seems to emerge from a brilliant intellect rather than from a musical genius.",3,Not quite the desert island opera,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,1384,"['much', 'engaging', 'production', 'staging', 'singing', 'are', 'consistanly', 'high', 'level', 'Davis', 'marvelous', 'conductor', 'singers', 'seem', 'embody', 'characters', 'portray', 'having', 'known', 'opera', 'rather', 'well', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'find', 'less', 'less', 'convinced', 'great', 'work', 'certainly', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'vehicle', 'Britten', 'most', 'striking', 'music', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'orchestral', 'interludes', 'vocal', 'music', 'solos', 'ensembles', 'suffer', 'lack', 'direction', 'when', 'Britten', 'short', 'repeated', 'phrase', 'libretto', 'much', 'very', 'awkward', 'writing', 'Britten', 'choose', 'most', 'awkward', 'way', 'setting', 'Many', 'lines', 'are', 'directionless', 'shapeless', 'contrary', 'shape', 'needed', 'give', 'intended', 'meaning', 'text', 'also', 'meaningless', 'melismas', 'most', 'inopportune', 'times', 'Britten', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'melodist', 'rather', 'orchestral', 'colorist', 'vocal', 'lines', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'more', 'natural', 'familiarity', 'seem', 'become', 'more', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'particularily', 'strange', 'considering', 'composers', 'prominance', 'world', '20th', 'century', 'opera', 'One', 'reputation', 'might', 'fade', 'time', 'Unquestionably', 'brilliant', 'man', 'work', 'emerge', 'brilliant', 'intellect', 'rather', 'musical', 'genius']","Britten - Peter Grimes / Davis, Vickers, Harper, Bailey, Royal Opera Covent Garden"

Britten reportedly disliked the Davis/Vickers production.  No one else does, though.  Heather Harper (the superb soprano soloist on Colin Davis's 1965 Messiah on Philips) is an excellent Ellen (better than her Decca counterpart, Claire Watson) and the whole production is first-rate.  If you enjoy the opera, pick up the Decca recording too -- Britten himself conducts atmospherically, Pears is very moving in the title role -- less brutal and more vulnerable than Vickers, but both interpretations are valid.  One reviewer questioned the ""greatness"" of the opera -- for me, it's as good as the best of Puccini and Strauss, and only the greatest Mozart, Verdi, and Wagner operas surpass it.

The music is meant to accentuate the mood of a dank, musty, seaside town and Sir Colin Davis succeeds admirably but do not look for Verdi's melodic quality or Puccini's lyrical beauty here.Also does it matter that Britten wrote it for Pears and not Vickers? Or that Vickers was a homophobe? Not one of the multitude of roles Callas made her own was written specifically for her and Vickers worked amicably side by side with a bunch of openly gay men, whether he liked it or not. I'm tired of hearing both these things.The fact is the music and lyrics of Peter Grimes are not very good(though they set the mood) despite the best efforts of Sir Colin Davis,the cast,and orchestra.What makes this opera watchable, and the reason people still try to revive this piece is Jon Vickers.
