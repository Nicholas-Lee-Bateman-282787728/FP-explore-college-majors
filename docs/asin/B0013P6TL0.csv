When I saw it available I had to get it for a few memories, as it turns out I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Special feature, audio commontary is just as interesting as the picture is and helps give infromation about why this show didn't last.  But first the show begins with a movie that actually was in select theaters for a very short period of time.  Shows what miscommunication can do to a production eh?  Given the time when this movie was done and the intended audience, this is an excellent film with a message.  I recommend it to anybody.",5,A classic that didn't really get a chance,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,636,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'remember', 'Bravestarr', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'When', 'saw', 'available', 'had', 'get', 'few', 'memories', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'Special', 'feature', 'audio', 'commontary', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'picture', 'give', 'infromation', 'why', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'first', 'show', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', 'select', 'theaters', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'what', 'miscommunication', 'can', 'do', 'production', 'eh', 'Given', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'intended', 'audience', 'excellent', 'film', 'message', 'recommend', 'anybody']",Legend of Bravestarr - The Movie
