""Life Stinks"" is a Chaplinesque fable that focused on the very real problems of America's homeless.  While it was met with indifference by the moviegoing public and critics took turns hurling brickbats, practically inviting derision due to the title, there were a few perceptive reviewers who recognized that this was Brooks' most sincere and daring effort in years.  Perhaps if the title of this film had been ""Life Is Beautiful,"" it would have met a different fate.  Nevertheless, this film is an important entry into the Brooks canon.  Putting his money where his mouth is, Mel Brooks made a strong social statement as well as an entertaining film.  It's his most personal work since ""The Producers.""",5,"Right Up There With ""City Lights""",1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,898,"['being', 'criticized', 'producing', 'mostly', 'spoof', 'movies', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'departed', 'genre', 'returned', 'semi-real', 'world', 'early', 'two', 'films', 'Producers', 'Twelve', 'Chairs', 'Life', 'Stinks', 'Chaplinesque', 'fable', 'focused', 'very', 'real', 'problems', 'America', 'homeless', 'was', 'met', 'indifference', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'critics', 'took', 'turns', 'hurling', 'brickbats', 'practically', 'inviting', 'derision', 'due', 'title', 'were', 'few', 'perceptive', 'reviewers', 'who', 'recognized', 'was', 'Brooks', 'most', 'sincere', 'daring', 'effort', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'title', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'would', 'have', 'met', 'different', 'fate', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'important', 'entry', 'Brooks', 'canon', 'Putting', 'money', 'where', 'mouth', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'made', 'strong', 'social', 'statement', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'film', 'most', 'personal', 'work', 'Producers']",N/A
304594,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,6302261600,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[3, 3]","When you name your movie ""Life Stinks"", and the movie isn't a comedy classic like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"", then you get set up for harsh remarks like ""This Movie Stinks"". And that's too bad, because this is a smaller film with more heart & soul which doesn't try to BE those comedies. This one has a different tone & purpose. It's not a genre parody like Brooks' past work, but one which addresses a real life issue: That of society's division between the wealthy and that of the impoverished. Brooks casts himself as multi-millionaire Goddard Bolt, a callous, uncaring man who sets his sights on bulldozing 2 1/2 miles of Los Angeles' most destitute property--which happens to be the ""home"" of the homeless. But first, Bolt must secure the other half of ownership from his business rival, an even more unscrupulous (and sneaky) man played with controlled oiliness by Jeffrey Tambor. A bet is made based on whether Bolt can survive on these same streets for thirty days (of course, Tambor tricks Bolt out of his fortune during this time). What transpires as survival for Bolt is also a life lesson as he learns firsthand how harsh life is for these homeless people. Along the way, he befriends a feisty bag lady (Lesley Ann Warren, who made a one-note character in ""Victor/Victoria"" hilarious, and works the same magic here), a spindly old man named Sailor (a surprisingly restrained performance from Howard Morris), and a lanky, boozy bum (Teddy Wilson). The dramatic scene when Sailor is left for dead on a sidewalk--and no one seems to care--speaks volumes about society's views of the homeless. Of course, the movie isn't without some wonderful highlights: The joyous dance between Brooks & Warren in a warehouse full of rags; Brooks, having hit rock bottom, in an overcrowded hospital hallway, being repeatedly pumped full of thorazine by an absent-minded doctor; an outrageous slap fight between Brooks & Rudy DeLuca (delivering a very funny performance here as a ranting, delusional bum); Brooks, after finding his rival has broken him, tries to walk out of his former mansion with valued (and bulky) posessions; and a climactic battle between Brooks & Tambor, using cranes in a scene which plays out like a dinosaur fight.The bottom line: If you want a raucous, rowdy comedy that's belly laughs from start to finish, then watch ""Saddles""; if you want something more genteel & sweet between the laughs, then watch this one.",4,A Brooks comedy with more heart but less belly laughs,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,2448,"['When', 'name', 'movie', 'Life', 'Stinks', 'movie', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'classic', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'then', 'get', 'set', 'up', 'harsh', 'remarks', 'Movie', 'Stinks', 'too', 'bad', 'smaller', 'film', 'more', 'heart', 'soul', ""n't"", 'try', 'BE', 'comedies', 'one', 'different', 'tone', 'purpose', 'not', 'genre', 'parody', 'Brooks', 'past', 'work', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'issue', 'society', 'division', 'wealthy', 'impoverished', 'Brooks', 'multi-millionaire', 'Goddard', 'Bolt', 'callous', 'uncaring', 'man', 'who', 'sights', 'bulldozing', '2', '1/2', 'miles', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'most', 'destitute', 'property', 'be', 'home', 'homeless', 'first', 'Bolt', 'must', 'secure', 'other', 'half', 'ownership', 'business', 'rival', 'even', 'more', 'unscrupulous', 'sneaky', 'man', 'played', 'controlled', 'oiliness', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'bet', 'made', 'based', 'Bolt', 'can', 'survive', 'same', 'streets', 'thirty', 'days', 'course', 'Tambor', 'tricks', 'Bolt', 'fortune', 'time', 'What', 'survival', 'Bolt', 'also', 'life', 'lesson', 'firsthand', 'how', 'harsh', 'life', 'homeless', 'people', 'way', 'feisty', 'bag', 'lady', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'who', 'made', 'one-note', 'character', 'Victor/Victoria', 'hilarious', 'same', 'magic', 'here', 'spindly', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Sailor', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Howard', 'Morris', 'lanky', 'boozy', 'bum', 'Teddy', 'Wilson', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'when', 'Sailor', 'left', 'dead', 'sidewalk', 'one', 'care', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'society', 'views', 'homeless', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'highlights', 'joyous', 'dance', 'Brooks', 'Warren', 'warehouse', 'full', 'rags', 'Brooks', 'having', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'overcrowded', 'hospital', 'hallway', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'pumped', 'full', 'thorazine', 'absent-minded', 'doctor', 'outrageous', 'slap', 'fight', 'Brooks', 'Rudy', 'DeLuca', 'delivering', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'here', 'ranting', 'delusional', 'bum', 'Brooks', 'finding', 'rival', 'broken', 'tries', 'walk', 'former', 'mansion', 'valued', 'bulky', 'posessions', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Brooks', 'Tambor', 'using', 'cranes', 'scene', 'out', 'dinosaur', 'fight.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'want', 'raucous', 'rowdy', 'comedy', 'belly', 'laughs', 'start', 'finish', 'then', 'watch', 'Saddles', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'genteel', 'sweet', 'laughs', 'then', 'watch', 'one']",N/A
304595,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,6302261600,Ricardo C.,"[1, 5]","A witless and hollow comedy starring Mel Brooks as a billionaire who makes a bet that he could survive on the streets for 30 days. The beginning gags got a chuckle from me and some of the stuff that followed too like the bit with a piece of corn on someone's face. However, a majority of these gags you can see a mile away; You know that hand on the floor will be stepped on, you see that car will run over that puddle and splash people, and it's like this for most of the film. This is amateur hour. This came from the mind who wrote and directed The Producers '68 and Young Frankenstein ?  Trading Places, an infinitely smarter film, took their characters for granted. They reacted to the situations they were in and they delivered comedy gold.  Here Brooks' character is too lazy even to be funny, he just bums through this picture like he knows he'll get his money back and have a happy ending.What's just as bad, or possibly worse, is that the film tries to be more than what it is. At one point of the hobos Brooks meets up with dies on the sidewalk and the death is clearly emphasized for pathos. Then the next scene involves a comedic attempt to dispose of his ashes at ""sea"". The awkward nature of lumping in tradegy with comedy didn't work and it happens one too many times in film.I really am baffled by Brooks' output in the past 25 years.
