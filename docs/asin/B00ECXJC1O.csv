I almost bought the British PAL DVD set but put it off and finally SyFy put it on. I watched every episode that I could, even checked SyFy's website out,  but was never quite as impressed with the characters or storylines. The dinosaurs I saw before our friends at SyFy started broadcasting at off hours- if at all- were better than some reviews let on.Now I need to watch the DVD set to catch the episodes I missed on the viewer's marathon and to finally see the finale/ cliffhanger that I don't remember being broadcast (the trailer for it was on SyFy.com). It appears to me that the writers had a lot of loose ends (Connor Temple anyone?), too many for a good series to have.",3,"Mistreated by SyFy, not as good as early British prequel episodes were",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,812,"[""'d"", 'liked', 'British', 'Primeval', 'especially', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'when', 'heard', 'Canadian', 'sequel', 'existed', 'wanted', 'see', 'too', 'almost', 'bought', 'British', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'set', 'put', 'off', 'finally', 'SyFy', 'put', 'watched', 'episode', 'could', 'even', 'checked', 'SyFy', 'website', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'impressed', 'characters', 'storylines', 'dinosaurs', 'saw', 'friends', 'SyFy', 'started', 'broadcasting', 'hours-', 'all-', 'were', 'better', 'reviews', 'let', 'need', 'watch', 'DVD', 'set', 'catch', 'episodes', 'missed', 'viewer', 'marathon', 'finally', 'see', 'finale/', 'cliffhanger', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'broadcast', 'trailer', 'was', 'SyFy.com', 'writers', 'had', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'Connor', 'Temple', 'anyone', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'series', 'have']",N/A

Vancouver Or Washtington. As though his appearance lends credibilty to this farce which it dosent. The original series had the advantage of the British Wit and mannerisms and silliness and a great diversity of characters. Some like Danny the former cop were left in the Anomaly and never came back. One fellow who came in the show had a doppelganger that was never explained when the show ended. The producers were told that the special effects were costing too much.  What a shame.

1666872,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00ECXJC1O,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 6]","When I was a young spud, TV was more than a bit different than what it is for young spuds today.  For starters, we didn&#8217;t have a billion channels to flip through in order to find something remotely interesting.  What we did have though largely thanks to the 1960&#8217;s and early 70&#8217;s was a fair amount of fun-centric sci-fi themed shows that would tickle the young mind &#8230; especially the young boys&#8217; minds.  The space age was all the rage, and, with STAR TREK and LOST IN SPACE, every one of us wanted to be astronauts.  Those who didn&#8217;t?  Well, we could roam the depths in VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, or we could race through time in TIME TUNNEL.  These programs went a long way toward fueling our imagination, largely populating them with various monsters and other oddities that would keep us glued to those silver screens as well as keep us awake at night for fear that they were coming to eat us alive.Hats off to the folks behind PRIMEVAL: NEW WORLD for returning to those sentiments, even if it was only for a scant thirteen episodes of men, monsters, and the mayhem resulting when they met.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)New age wunderkind Evan Cross has lost the love of his life to the most curious circumstances imaginable: while exploring an abandoned building to track down a magnetic anomaly, the two lovebirds can face-to-face with a lumbering Albertosaurus who munches down his would-be bride.  Now committed more than ever, he uses knowledge and his personal wealth to put together a crack team of scientists/adventurers willing to go head-to-head with these prehistoric creatures slipping through portals in time in order to terrorize the world as we know it.For those who didn&#8217;t know, this version of PRIMEVAL is a kinda/sorta spiritual refashioning of a U.K. show of the same name.  This property was set and filmed in Vancouver (where else?), and it was graced with the guiding presence of Judith and Gar Reeves-Stevens.  (This can be good, but, with good, there also comes some bad.)  If you&#8217;ve never heard of them, then you&#8217;re probably no fan of STAR TREK fiction as they&#8217;ve cooperated with William Shatner in bringing some of the brightest and best adventures to life on the printed page.  When it comes to their work in episodic television, however, they haven&#8217;t been as fortunate.  While their contributions genuinely feel inspired, their explorations lack the massive narrative scope they&#8217;ve successfully mastered in their prose.For all its strengths &#8211; and there are plenty &#8211; PRIMEVAL never quite escapes that dead weight sensation of feeling derivative.  While I&#8217;m unfamiliar with its predecessor show, methinks I would be a comfortable waters stating that it&#8217;s probably superior in several ways; however, I&#8217;d put money that the latest digital enhancements in filmdom probably gives this modern incarnation the edge in storytelling.  Therein lies the fatal rub: as the technical grows, it becomes more and more affordable to bring special effects to television audiences, and this unfortunately has produced the net loss of creative storytelling.  After all, when you can fix everything in post-production, why start with a perfect script?  This has plague more TV shows than just PRIMEVAL, mind you, as any network executive will remind you; and I suspect it&#8217;ll continue to cause ratings&#8217; nightmares for quite a few more in the decades ahead.Don&#8217;t let that reality interfere with your giving PRIMEVAL a fair shot for your entertainment dollar.  Populating a show with a team of scientists who all look like underwear models probably wasn&#8217;t a great way to make kids want to grow up and study physics, but it will bring in that much needed teen and young adult demographic.  The show had a somewhat groovy vibe &#8211; a nifty undercurrent &#8211; that escapes most short-lived productions, especially those you&#8217;ll find on Syfy: the science was more like what you&#8217;d expect from INDIANA JONES or JURASSIC PARK and less like what you find on the National Geographic Channel &#8230; so there&#8217;s something to be said for that.You want tongue-in-cheek fun?  You could do far worse than PRIMEVAL: NEW WORLD.PRIMEVAL: NEW WORLD (THE COMPLETE SERIES) is produced by Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund and Omni Film Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (aka E One).  As for the technical specifications?  Hell yeah!  The show looks and sounds pretty awesome with some state-of-the-art CGI doing wonders where other programs have come up a bit short.  As for the special features?  It&#8217;s a slim but worthy assortment: you can &#8220;Meet the Cast,&#8221; go &#8220;Inside the Tank,&#8221; and enjoy 13 episodic behind-the-scenes features &#8211; one for each episode that made this &#8216;complete series&#8217; what it was for viewers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I&#8217;ve a history of being pretty hard on many of the series that come to the masses via Syfy, but that&#8217;s only because FARSCAPE really was the cat&#8217;s meow; everything since has been a pale imitation.  Still, it was hard not to accept PRIMEVAL: NEW WORLD as exactly as its writers, producers, and talent intended &#8211; a middle-of-the-road monster series with prehistoric creatures given central focus.  Sure, it&#8217;s probably plagued by as much saccharin writing as the next series retread / reboot, but the little kid trapped somewhere inside of me still liked it an awful lot.  Thumbs up &#8230; but modestly disappointed to learn it wasn&#8217;t picked up for more.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (aka E One) provided me with a Blu-ray DVD copy of PRIMEVAL: NEW WORLD (THE COMPLETE SERIES) by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,"Half-Baked But Fully Loaded For Flavor, PRIMEVAL:

1666873,A36CDTPDMHWMJ,B00ECXJC1O,G. M. Curtis,"[7, 9]","Hi,First let me begin by saying that I watched the British show for five seasons and really enjoye it. It was a little annoying as they kept killing off front line characters, and so you ended up in season five with only two original cast members who were both more minor roles, but you had to take the good with the bad. As you had to take the incredible scenes of empty city streets whenever a dinosaur went on the rampage.PNW is not as good. It isn't terrible but it's limited.The range of creatures battled is a long way down on what you saw in the British show. And that's important when in the original series half the fun was in working out just what the hell the team were facing in each episode. It lent the plot some twists. PNW leaves you really with just one plot - they're coming to eat you.The characters are more mundane, less individual. Not many of them have deep dark pasts,and only one of them has some overwhelming need to be doing what he's doing. This steals from the drama of the show, leaving what could be a good character driven show a little flat.There is a glaring plot problem in it in that the lead guy hunting down the anomalies is a private citizen with a personal reason for the hunt. And everybody else just falls in line with his quest for no really obvious reason. The plain fact of the matter is that if anomalies were showing up and there was proof, then the government would be everywhere. The British show covered this by having the Anomaly Research Centre as part of the government. This one just seemed to gloss over the whole problem, with only the black ops military people doing a sort of side research project and everyone else apparently just content to remain in the dark or allow a civilian to do the government's work.Having said that this was a reasonable romp.

1666877,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00ECXJC1O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[34, 39]","One thing that I've noticed in looking at television reviews is that many people feel that if they watch a show, it automatically qualifies for a five star rave.  I'm somewhat more pragmatic.  I watch a variety of TV, not all of it is spectacularly good.  In fact, I'd rate the shows I view regularly anywhere from 3 stars to 5 stars (I've even watched a few 2 or 1 star seasons when a program I liked dipped in quality).  I'm mentioning this in preface to my comments about ""Primeval: New World"" because it's a show that I genuinely enjoyed as a lark.  If you like dinosaurs, it's a bit of fun to pass the time.  If you had the opportunity to watch it for free on SyFy (where it aired), I'd say ""go for it.""  I'm a little more reticent about a full fledged DVD/Blu-ray purchase, however, because I'm not sure if you'd sit down to watch the series more than once.  On the plus side: It's fun, lightweight, has an attractive cast, and some good dinosaur effects.  Realistically, though, the monster of the week theme gets a bit repetitive.  As the show tries to expand its mythology and intrigue later in the season, it does show signs of ramping up the drama to the next level.  But just as things start to look more promising, the season comes to a close.  And as the program was canceled, we'll never have the chance to see if the story lines would have deepened and gotten more rewarding.""Primeval: New World"" was a Canadian twist on the popular British series that ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2011.  The original ""Primeval,"" which also struggled to find its initial footing, had a number of things going for it.  In tone, it could be both exceedingly dark AND ridiculously goofy.  The cast had a quirky energy and grooved together well, each playing a rather distinctive role.  As the episodes progressed, the relationships and plot strands got progressively more twisted and complex and this kept things interesting.  Not to be too harsh, but ""Primeval: New World"" is a decidedly blander affair in comparison.  In this update, the dinosaurs are the stars and they are impressively rendered from episode to episode.  Dinosaurs: FIVE STARS!  The human storylines, however, are somewhat less interesting.  Aside from the lead character (Eureka's Niall Matter), you don't get to know anyone with much depth.  Sure, everyone is likable enough.  And when things are kept at a breezy pace, this might be enough.  But I really think that the show had the potential to be more impactful with its characterizations and plotting.  The typical plot week after week is that when a dinosaur appeared, the crew faced it down and returned it home.  This might be entertaining, but it certainly lacked imagination.Andrew Lee Potts (star of the original), as Connor Temple, makes a cameo at both the beginning and end of the series and it's great to see him.  Matter plays a wealthy businessman/scientific researcher who has his life upended when his wife is killed by a dinosaur. Obsessed and driven, he has dedicated most of his time to tracking down where this beast came from and discovers a series of anomalies that create time portals to past eras.  In each episode, as I mentioned, a new creature squares off against the Canadian backdrop to create havoc and worse.  Matter's team is comprised of Sarah Canning, Danny Rahim, and Crystal Lowe.  He also has a potential love interest in Miranda Frigon, and their on-going relationship is one of the more successful elements of the series.  Also invaluable is Geoff Gustafson, an offbeat government official who may be an ally or he may be a foe.  Of all the characters, it is Gustafson who remains the most mysterious, intriguing, and gets the best lines.  Late in the season, a surprise appearance by Matter's Eureka co-star Colin Ferguson is also a big treat!Toward the end of the series, the dinosaur hunters are facing a more dire government conspiracy as well.  I really liked this angle, but it still lacks some depth.  In the end, ""Primeval: New World"" is not particularly ambitious on its own.  If you like dinosaurs, this may be just the ticket.  But if you're a fan of the original, I suspect you'll notice the more generic tone of this piece.  I enjoyed watching these episodes, but it's not a series that I would revisit and/or remember as a new TV classic.  Pleasant enough, though, at 3 1/2 stars.  13 episodes on 3 discs.

Then again, that's the case with most wonderful and creative television series. The ""Primeval"" production costs had the added burden that the show relied heavily on expensive CGI effects which led to the cancellation of the original BBC series despite a HUGE fan-base worldwide.My chief confusion is that I've heard so many negative things about Primeval: New World which have no real substance. For one thing, this series takes place in an alternate reality from the original series - an idea which goes back to what happened at the end of Season 1 of the original. In this instance, Professor Cutter returned to a reality where many things were different - including the fact that Claudia Brown had never existed, but an identical doppleganger of her did. In this case, Conner (who only appears in the first and last episodes of the new series) is not necessarily the Conner Temple we know from the original series!The one thing which brings this series down is the simple fact that we have have not just one cliffhanger (from the original series) but two which are and may forever remain unresolved.The only other show to compare this one to is probably Doctor Who. This is because the fact of alternate timelines gives a perfect premise for periodically changing the entire cast and even the direction of the story. If an actor wants to leave the show, he or she can be safely killed off because there are probably alternate versions of the same character in alternate timelines which could ""accidentally"" land in the current timeline  - even if it's just for a guest-spot in a single episode. This is a plot-tool as powerful and useful as giving the Doctor the ability to regenerate since it means the series, barring other problems, could continue for a very long time. After all, Doctor Who is not only back from the grave but more popular than ever! I think the same could happen with the Primeval franchise.By the way, I realize there could be a comparison between Primeval and the original Land of the Lost, yet the only thing they really have in common is dinosaurs in the plot. Land of the Lost is better compared to The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.Even though the story is unresolved, I would urge any fans of the original to make this boxed set part of their collection since it really is a well-produced series.The effects are as good as can be expected (by which I mean they are extremely well done) and the story, though complex, does make plenty of sense and would have made more sense if the series had continued. And if anyone complains about the difference in size and coloration of the Pteranadons between the two series, I would remind you that there were probably several species in the genus Pteranadon.

Yes, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers that this go round is a notch or two down the scale.  It starts out slowly, looking more like a rehash of the original and introducing the principle players of the story.  But it picks up steam as it goes along and develops new plot lines/conspiracies which depart  from the original British storyline.  I found that the characters grow on you in their own way and despite some other reviewer opinions, the principles' motivations are made pretty clear.  Two of the leads loose significant others to dinosaur  attacks at the get go and the two ""supporting"" leads are acting on loyalties forged to the lead hero (Evan Cross). He intervened in their lives earlier on, giving them a chance for a better life.This takes place in British Columbia, Canada, which is made quite clear, and is supposed to represent a different approach to the anomalies problem as it crops up in the Western Hemisphere with barely any contact/expertise gotten from the British handling of the same phenomenon.  Yes, Conner Temple from the original shows up in the first and last episode here to ""stir the pot""  but is around more for context than for impact on events.  Basically, a private business owner gets sucked into forming a team to understand/battle this phenomenon under cover of his company and away from outside influences for the sake of security.  But, eventually the Government learns of the goings on and tries to take over from our hero's team.  We all know how a government run anomaly program would turn out, don't we?The special effects are great.  The creatures are more limited in scope but provide some variety from the first series.  The issue of time travel paradoxes is flirted with here and adds some mystery as to why the action here was influenced so little by the British Series events/results.  This story ends with a doosey of a cliff hanger, which due to the show's cancellation, will never be resolved!  It leaves you hanging and wanting more.  That's a shame because I feel they were really hitting their stride.  None of the actors will be very familiar to American audiences, but they are good looking and do a tolerable job of acting.
