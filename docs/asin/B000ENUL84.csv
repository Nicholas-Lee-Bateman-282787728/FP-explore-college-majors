974932,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000ENUL84,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Captain Beefheart: Under Review"" is a surprisingly good British documentary about the American blues/psychedelic singer. Members of his band and producers are interviewed, his albums are individually assessed, his music is played, they show his videos- so it's shockingly good. Quite unlike the documentaryMichael Jackson: Life of a Superstar, that had hardly any music and didn't even use the videos in context (such as showing scenes from ""Billie Jean"" when talking about ""Thriller"") Captain Beefheart's sidekicks have gone onto greater fame than him. He remains an icon of outsider music, with his magnum opusTrout Mask Replica. Ry Cooder, who was in the original lineup of the Magic Band, has gone ontoBuena Vista Social ClubandTalking Timbuktu. Frank Zappa, his protege and rival, went on toStrictly Commercial: The Best Of Frank ZappaandWe're Only in It for the Money, with his ironic commentaries on pop culture. ""Captain Beefheart:Under Review"" sheds light on a lesser known talent, a true outsider musician, with his earthy voice and his theremin.To quote Jeff Bridges (Tron: The Original Classic (Two-Disc Special Edition)), ""Rest in peace, Captain Beefheart!""Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) was a luminous, enigmatic musical talent.

974933,AM2IR1V5EU55U,B000ENUL84,"Brian J. Greene ""djbrian""","[10, 12]","What keeps this from being a great documentary is simply some poor editing decisions.  Throughout the almost two hours-long program, the viewer is teased by scenes of Capt. Beefheart and His Magic Band performing - odd promos, concert snippets, and TV performances from the A&M Sessions/Safe as Milk era, all the way to Ice Cream for Crow time.  But every time one of these cool-looking clips appears on the screen, and just as you're settling in to enjoy it, someone starts talking over it and the camera cuts away to an interview segment.  Ouch.  But the interviews themselves are quite enjoyable.  Various members of the Magic Band, Beefheart's biographer, music journalists Alan Clayson and Nigel Williamson, et al, all offer interesting insights into the career of the Captain.  The musicians are upfront in describing both how wonderful and how impossible it could be to work with Beefheart, the analysts don't mind telling you awful they thought some of the records were, while also wildly praising some of the other records.  If the performances had been left to play through, and had there been just a little less talk, I would be giving this 5 stars.

The rare live clips are excellent and hopefully someday they can be compiled, uniterrupted into a DVD collection. Look at this as an audio book with snippets of tasty music. There is so little available on Beefheart on DVD if you don't have access to BBC documentaries or bootleg live films. So the 2 hour length didn't bore me at all.

I've seen him live several times and bought every album.  I've read Harkleroad's book.  I've taped a couple of interviews with him off broadcast TV.  I've also seen a limited amount of video footage of the band, and most of it was pretty poor quality.  I happened to catch the brief TV commercial that aired once in LA (channel 13? or was it 9) in the '70s, could hardly believe it, but now I have proof as it is shown in the documentary.  While as other reviewers have stated, it's unfortunate that the videos used in this documentary are not shown in their entirety, I was somewhat amazed that 1) there was as much Beefheart video that I had never seen, and 2) that the quality of it was often pretty good compared to what I have seen.  Most of the video is from European TV programs, but there's even early footage of Safe As Milk tunes and even Diddy Wah Diddy.  What's shown here is therefore the tip of the iceberg which gives a fan like me hope that someday it will be collected and released in its entirety.But the fact the music is excerpted does not diminish the value of this documentary.  Beefheart made it higher up in the charts in Europe than in the US, and had a significant following there.  This UK based documentary is just shy of 2 hours long and is primarily interviews with ex-band members recounting various aspects of their experiences in the band, and interviews with music critics who had followed Beefheart through his various stages.  Each Beefheart album is presented in turn and discussed by both musicians and critics and provides considerable insight into the workings of the various versions of the band.  Essential for any serious fan, or those curious about the phenomena.  And while there are significant excerpts of songs, presenting entire songs is not the purpose of this documentary-- though it may help you to choose which album(s) to buy if you are new to Beefheart.One thing about Beefheart that there can be no disagreement about, is that he is one of a kind.  But largely because of that he will likely never be mainstream enough to inspire big-budget documentary producers to produce something that would be acceptable on US television that could be more than about 5 minutes long.  The quality of this documentary is not bad, all things considered, and in my opinion is well worth the relatively low price.  On the other hand, skip the ""Low Yo Yo Stuff"" DVD, as that has very little to offer.",4,Better than I expected,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,2538,"['live', 'grew', 'up', 'Los', 'Angeles', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Beefheart', 'fan', 'early', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'several', 'times', 'bought', 'album', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Harkleroad', 'book', ""'ve"", 'taped', 'couple', 'interviews', 'off', 'broadcast', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'limited', 'amount', 'video', 'footage', 'band', 'most', 'was', 'pretty', 'poor', 'quality', 'happened', 'catch', 'brief', 'TV', 'commercial', 'aired', 'once', 'LA', 'channel', '13', 'was', '9', ""'70s"", 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'now', 'have', 'proof', 'shown', 'documentary', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'unfortunate', 'videos', 'used', 'documentary', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'entirety', 'was', 'somewhat', 'amazed', '1', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'Beefheart', 'video', 'had', 'never', 'seen', '2', 'quality', 'was', 'often', 'pretty', 'good', 'compared', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Most', 'video', 'European', 'TV', 'programs', 'even', 'early', 'footage', 'Safe', 'Milk', 'tunes', 'even', 'Diddy', 'Wah', 'Diddy', 'What', 'shown', 'here', 'therefore', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'fan', 'hope', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'collected', 'released', 'entirety.But', 'fact', 'music', 'excerpted', 'not', 'diminish', 'value', 'documentary', 'Beefheart', 'made', 'higher', 'up', 'charts', 'Europe', 'US', 'had', 'significant', 'following', 'there', 'UK', 'based', 'documentary', 'just', 'shy', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'primarily', 'interviews', 'ex-band', 'members', 'recounting', 'various', 'aspects', 'experiences', 'band', 'interviews', 'music', 'critics', 'who', 'had', 'followed', 'Beefheart', 'various', 'stages', 'Beefheart', 'album', 'presented', 'turn', 'discussed', 'musicians', 'critics', 'considerable', 'insight', 'workings', 'various', 'versions', 'band', 'Essential', 'serious', 'fan', 'curious', 'phenomena', 'are', 'significant', 'excerpts', 'songs', 'presenting', 'entire', 'songs', 'not', 'purpose', 'documentary', 'may', 'help', 'choose', 'album', 'buy', 'are', 'new', 'Beefheart.One', 'thing', 'Beefheart', 'can', 'be', 'disagreement', 'one', 'kind', 'largely', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'mainstream', 'enough', 'inspire', 'big-budget', 'documentary', 'producers', 'produce', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'US', 'television', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'about', '5', 'minutes', 'long', 'quality', 'documentary', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'considered', 'opinion', 'well', 'relatively', 'low', 'price', 'other', 'hand', 'skip', 'Low', 'Yo', 'Yo', 'Stuff', 'DVD', 'very', 'little', 'offer']",Captain Beefheart: Under Review
974937,AFE0AGQT50MBJ,B000ENUL84,KV Trout,"[23, 23]","Most of the complaints among reviewers here are that the performances are not long enough. Well, this is a documentary, folks, and that is the way documentaries are made. Documentaries almost never contain complete performances, go watch some and see for yourself.This is a relatively low budget documentary about a guy who is surrounded in controversy, who would not cooperate in the making of it, and whose bandmembers also did not all participate. So getting footage was not easy and getting interviews and info was limited. Combine that with the low budget, and I think the documentary makers did a very good job here!First of all, unless you are a hard-core collector, this dvd has quite a bit of rare footage, and a lot of info and opinions I had not heard before.It moves well, you don't get bored because they include snippets of music every so often, and yes, that is what music is for in a documentary. Okay, I agree, they could have left some of the performances a little longer, but for me it was about the Information, not the music. I have enough Beefheart music in my collection. This is a good overview of Beefheart and his rise to fame and his going into (intentional) obsurity.I am one of the world's original Beefheart fans, having bought Trout Mask the day it came out, (okay, I know some of you were around since Safe As Milk, but still, Trout is early...), and I consider him one of the world's living musical geniuses.I enjoyed this documentary and am glad I bought it. It's all we have unless someone comes along with more money to spend on one, and gets Don's cooperation. Unlikely.Some day you will see a documentary about Don Van Vliet, the PAINTER, as his fame and respect in the art world grows. Chances are it won't be until after he dies.

None of the musical footage is presented in its entirety, and sometimes people are talking over the music.  Also, even though a good number of Magic Band members are interviewed and a good number of anecdotes are provided, the interviews frequently contain such insights as, ""It did what it did"" (Elliot Ingber commenting on ""Alice in Blunderland"" solo).In addition, the manner of interviewing people is really tacky: John French on a telephone in a tree, Eric Drew Feldman in a toy truck, Elliot Ingber in a parked car, Gary Lucas in bed with some weird blue nightlight.  This method of marketing the Magic Band as freaks just detracts from the content of the interviews. Overall, the production is gimmicky, with annoying graphics for each band member that go on far too long.  The opening image is just so tasteless, and really says it all about this DVD: the Captain's voice issuing from a doll's head.Yet, the biggest problem is that there is simply too much talking and too little music. I found the DVD to be actually kind of boring, with many of the interview segments going on far too long.So, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this film, but rather to seek out a bootleg copy of the vastly superior BBC documentary ""The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart"" as well as a bootleg disc of actual live footage of the Captain and his Magic Bands.",2,A Waste of Money,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,1390,"['DVD', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'None', 'musical', 'footage', 'presented', 'entirety', 'sometimes', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'music', 'Also', 'even', 'good', 'number', 'Magic', 'Band', 'members', 'are', 'interviewed', 'good', 'number', 'anecdotes', 'are', 'provided', 'interviews', 'frequently', 'contain', 'such', 'insights', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Elliot', 'Ingber', 'commenting', 'Alice', 'Blunderland', 'solo', '.In', 'addition', 'manner', 'interviewing', 'people', 'really', 'tacky', 'John', 'French', 'telephone', 'tree', 'Eric', 'Drew', 'Feldman', 'toy', 'truck', 'Elliot', 'Ingber', 'parked', 'car', 'Gary', 'Lucas', 'bed', 'weird', 'blue', 'nightlight', 'method', 'marketing', 'Magic', 'Band', 'freaks', 'just', 'detracts', 'content', 'interviews', 'Overall', 'production', 'gimmicky', 'annoying', 'graphics', 'band', 'member', 'go', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'opening', 'image', 'just', 'so', 'tasteless', 'really', 'DVD', 'Captain', 'voice', 'issuing', 'doll', 'head.Yet', 'biggest', 'problem', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'too', 'little', 'music', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'actually', 'kind', 'boring', 'many', 'interview', 'going', 'far', 'too', 'long.So', 'would', ""n't"", 'advise', 'anyone', 'buy', 'film', 'rather', 'seek', 'out', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'vastly', 'superior', 'BBC', 'documentary', 'Artist', 'Formerly', 'Known', 'Captain', 'Beefheart', 'as', 'well', 'bootleg', 'disc', 'actual', 'live', 'footage', 'Captain', 'Magic', 'Bands']",Captain Beefheart: Under Review

The main problem is like many people said and the first thing I thought when I saw this DVD was, they show classic performance footage but have talking over it or show only half of the footage. Major disappointment because you get the feeling this could very well be the last word on Captain Beefheart. Any old footage will go into a vault and stay there. It is true that younger generations (hell I'm 24 myself) will continue to discover Beefheart but as the older people who were there move further away from the experience so much material is going to get lost forever. Makes ME want to get up and do something about it. Me and a friend had an idea of tracking down Don himself to see what he's up to but have heard many times that its not a good idea. Don's had 20 plus years to come back to say something or at least write some liner notes. Its heart breaking he doesn't hold his musical legacy with any regard whatsoever.This DVD, despite its obvious flaws is exactly what it says it is, a critical review. Band members and a handful of music critics tell a basic story of Captain Beefheart and His (the) Magic Band and its pretty interesting stuff. If you give it a chance you'll find it pretty rewarding and far more interesting than any crap you'll see on TV. My only thing is there is just one side to it most, I was dismayed to hear bad words about Clear Spot and Spotlight Kid, two of Beefhearts most refined albums. The two BAD albums are rightfully torn apart and the last 3 albums are great no matter what is said on this DVD. But it is what it says it is, a critical overview. It just could have used some more perspective of say some modern critics or more recent musicians, hell, talk to Tom Waits, or Mike Watt for that matter. I feel alot of the critics are just too negative.
